Alright, so I have this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. 

The question is about physics students measuring the velocity of a tennis ball. They drop it and it falls 6 meters. Then, the photogate measures the velocity. The predicted velocity is 20% higher than what was measured. I'm supposed to find out why there's such a big difference between the predicted and measured velocity.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in kinematics, the velocity of an object under constant acceleration is given by v = u + at, where u is initial velocity (which is zero if it's dropped), a is acceleration, and t is time. But wait, that's the average velocity over the distance, not the instantaneous. Oh right, the average velocity is the same as the instantaneous if it's moving at constant acceleration — because the velocity increases linearly. So, the average would be (v_initial + v_final)/2. But when using photogates, the time taken to pass through a gate is measured. 

I think the photogate measures the velocity as the ball passes through it. So the velocity measured by the photogate is the instantaneous velocity at that point. Wait, no, actually, photogates measure the time a ball passes through, and from that time and the distance, you can calculate the instantaneous velocity, which is the speed at the midpoint of the pass. But if the ball is accelerating, the velocity increases as it falls. So, perhaps the photogate measures the velocity at the point when the ball exits the gate, which is when it's moving slower than when it entered. So, the average velocity would be lower than the initial velocity, or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, let me think about the setup. The ball is dropped from 6 meters. So, it's in free fall. The photogate measures the velocity when the ball passes through it. The ball is in free fall, so the velocity increases as it falls. So, the moment the ball passes through the photogate, its velocity is higher than when it entered. Because in free fall, each subsequent moment has a higher velocity.

Wait, so if the photogate is measuring the velocity at the point when the ball is passing through, that's the same as the velocity at that particular time. But the average velocity would be the initial velocity plus final velocity divided by two. So, the photogate's measurement is the velocity at a certain point in time, which may not be the average.

Wait, maybe the photogate measures the velocity at the point when the ball passes, which is the instant velocity. So, the average velocity from the drop point to the photogate would be less than the instantaneous velocity when the ball passes. Because the average velocity is (v_initial + v_final)/2, and v_final is higher than v_initial. Wait, no, because the photogate's measurement is the instantaneous velocity at that point. So, the time it takes to pass through is based on that velocity. But the question says that the measured velocity is 20% higher than the predicted. So, let's think: the prediction is 20% higher than the actual measured value. So the actual is 100% and prediction is 120%. So the measured is lower than prediction.

Wait, let's think about the kinematic equations. Let me set up the problem. The ball is dropped, so initial velocity u=0. Distance fallen is s=6m. The photogate measures velocity v. Let's compute the predicted velocity, which is the average velocity (since it's in free fall, the average velocity would be (u + v)/2, which is v/2, since u=0). But the photogate measures v at the point when it passes, which is the same as the instantaneous velocity. So the average velocity from the drop to the gate would be (0 + v)/2 = v/2. But the photogate's measurement is v, which is higher than v/2. So the predicted (v_avg) is 50% of the measured v. But wait, the question says the predicted is 20% higher than the measured. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, wait, the question says the predicted velocity is 20% higher than the measured by the photogate. So, if the photogate's measurement is v, then the prediction was v * 1.2.

So, let's compute the actual v. The average velocity in free fall is (v_initial + v_final)/2. Since u=0, it's v/2.

Wait, but that's the average velocity from the start to the gate. So if the photogate measures v (the instantaneous velocity at gate), then the average velocity is v/2. So, the photogate's v is higher than the average. But what's the predicted velocity? The question says the prediction is higher than the measured.

Wait, perhaps the prediction is the average, and the photogate's measurement is the instantaneous. So, the measured v is higher than the average, but the prediction (which is average) is 20% less than the measured.

So, the predicted (average) velocity is v_avg = (0 + v)/2 = v/2. The measured is v. But if the prediction was higher than the measured, then v_avg = v_measured * 1.2. But that would mean v_avg is 1.2 v_measured, which contradicts the kinematic equation. So maybe I've got the setup wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the photogate measures the velocity at the point when the ball passes through, which is the same as the instantaneous velocity. The predicted velocity is the average, which is (0 + v)/2 = v/2. So the photogate's measurement is v, so v_measured = v, and the prediction is 20% higher than that. Wait, that would mean the prediction is v_measured * 1.2. So v_avg = 1.2 v_measured. But according to kinematics, v_avg = v/2. So v/2 = 1.2 v. Which would imply v is negative: v = 2.4 v. That can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scenario.

Wait, no, I think perhaps the setup is that the prediction is higher than the measured. So, the photogate measures a velocity v, and the prediction is v * 1.2. So, v_measured = v, prediction = 1.2 v.

But according to the kinematic model, the average velocity is v/2. So the prediction is 1.2 v, and the average is v/2. So 1.2 v = v/2, which would mean 1.2 = 0.5, which isn't possible. So that suggests something's wrong with my current understanding.

Maybe the photogate measures the instantaneous velocity at the point it passes through, which is the same as the velocity at that time. But the prediction is the average velocity, which would be the initial plus final velocity divided by two. Wait, initial is zero, so average is v/2.

But if the photogate's measurement is v, and the prediction is 20% higher than the measured, so prediction = 1.2 * v. But according to kinematics, prediction (average) is v/2. So v/2 = 1.2 v → which implies v=0, which is impossible. So perhaps the setup is different.

Wait, maybe I got the predicted velocity wrong. Maybe the prediction is the instantaneous velocity at the photogate, not the average. No, the question says "the predicted velocity". So perhaps the prediction is the value computed using the equations, which would be the average velocity.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. The setup is: a tennis ball is dropped from 6 meters. The photogate measures the velocity at a point in its fall. The prediction is 20% higher than the measured.

So, let's compute the actual velocity. Suppose the ball falls 6m. The time taken is t. But maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the photogate measures the velocity when the ball passes through it, which is the momentary velocity. 

But in free fall, the velocity at time t is v = gt. The distance fallen is s = (1/2) g t² = 6 meters.

So, time t can be calculated, perhaps. Let me compute t.

s = 0.5 g t^2 → t = sqrt(2s/g). g is approximately 9.8 m/s².

t = sqrt(2*6 /9.8 ) = sqrt(12/9.8) ≈ sqrt(1.2245) ≈ 1.1066 s.

Velocity at t is v = g t = 9.8 * 1.1066 ≈ 10.84 m/s.

So the ball would have a velocity of approximately 10.84 m/s when it passes the photogate.

But the prediction is 20% higher. So the prediction would be 10.84 * 1.2 = 13.008 m/s.

Wait, but that's not possible because the ball is only in free fall for s=6 meters. So the final velocity is 10.84 m/s. So the prediction is 13 m/s, which is higher than the actual. So the actual velocity is 10.84 m/s.

But wait, the question says the prediction is 20% higher than the measured. So in this case, the prediction is 13 m/s, and the measured is 10.84 m/s. So the measured is 10.84, which is about 98.5% of the prediction. So the measured is lower than the prediction. But the question says the prediction is higher than the measured. So in this case, the measured is lower, so the prediction is higher. So the answer would be that the actual velocity (photogate's measurement) is 98.5% of the predicted velocity. But why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps the ball is not in free fall. Because the acceleration varies. If the acceleration in the photogate's region isn't constant, then the velocity measured could differ.

Wait, wait, but the photogate is measuring the velocity as the ball passes through. If the ball is in a region with varying acceleration, the velocity measurement would differ from the free fall prediction. So, perhaps the ball is passing through a region where the acceleration isn't constant, like near a surface or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the ball is not in free fall. Suppose it's in a region where the acceleration isn't g, but different. Maybe it's in a region where the acceleration is lower, so the ball's velocity would be higher or lower.

Wait, but in the scenario described, the ball is dropped and falls 6 meters, then passes through the photogate. So, it's in free fall. But if the photogate is measuring a lower velocity, perhaps because the acceleration isn't constant.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows that the velocity when it passes through the photogate is around 10.84 m/s. So if the prediction is 20% higher, which would be approximately 13 m/s, that's impossible because the ball can't reach that speed in 6 meters in free fall. So that suggests the prediction is wrong. So the measured velocity is lower than the prediction. But the question says the prediction is 20% higher than the measured. That doesn't fit, unless I'm misunderstanding the scenario.

Wait, perhaps the photogate is measuring the velocity at the point when the ball passes through, but the prediction is based on some other model. Or maybe the photogate isn't in the same frame as the prediction.

Wait, another approach: the predicted velocity might be the velocity when the ball passes through, but the prediction is 20% higher than what the photogate measures. So in that case, the photogate's measurement is lower than the prediction.

But how can that be? Because in free fall, the velocity is higher than what the prediction would be. Wait, perhaps the ball is accelerating in another way, maybe with variable acceleration.

Wait, perhaps the photogate is measuring a velocity that's lower than the free fall velocity. So, if the acceleration isn't g, but maybe less, the ball would have a lower velocity at the point when it passes through.

Wait, let's think about the setup again. The ball is dropped, falls 6 meters, then passes through the photogate. The prediction is 20% higher than the measured. So, in the prediction, the photogate's measurement would be higher than the actual.

Wait, no, the prediction is the average velocity, which is 10.84 m/s, and the measured is lower. So the prediction is higher. So the prediction is 13 m/s, but the actual is 10.84 m/s. So the prediction is higher. But why would the prediction be 20% higher than the measured?

Wait, perhaps the photogate isn't measuring the velocity at the point of impact. Maybe it's measuring the velocity when the ball has passed through, but the prediction is computed based on a different scenario.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the photogate is measuring the velocity at a different point, but the ball is actually accelerating for a longer time than the free fall. Or maybe the photogate is in a region where the ball is slowing down, so the velocity measurement is lower than the free fall prediction.

Wait, but in free fall, the ball is accelerating at g. If the region where the photogate is placed is not under free fall, but perhaps with a different acceleration, the velocity would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the photogate is measuring the velocity as the ball passes through, but the ball isn't going through the entire 6 meters in free fall. But that doesn't make sense because the ball is in free fall for 1.1066 seconds, which is 6 meters.

Wait, perhaps the photogate is measuring a velocity that is different from the free fall prediction. So, the ball is accelerating for a longer time than 6 meters. For example, maybe the photogate's measurement is from a time when the ball is accelerating longer than free fall.

Wait, but the ball is dropped, so in the experiment, it's in free fall for a fixed distance. So the time is fixed. So the measurement from the photogate would be the velocity at that time. So if the prediction is based on a different model, perhaps the ball's acceleration is lower.

Wait, but the question says the predicted velocity is 20% higher. So the prediction (which might assume constant acceleration) is higher than the actual. So the actual is lower than the prediction.

But how? Because in free fall, the velocity increases with time. So the photogate's velocity would be higher than the average. But the prediction is based on the average. So if the prediction is 20% higher than the measured, that doesn't make sense because the prediction is the average. Wait, perhaps the prediction is computed as the velocity at the photogate's point, which happens to be higher than the average.

Wait, that can't be, because the average would be lower. For example, in the first part, the average is v/2, and the measured velocity is v. So the average is 50% of the measured. So the prediction is 1.2 times the measured, but the average is 0.5 times the average. That can't be. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the prediction is based on the photogate's velocity. So if the prediction is the velocity as measured by the photogate, and it's 20% lower than the actual, but the question says the prediction is higher. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the possible options. The options are about why the measured is lower than the prediction.

Option C: The ball's velocity decreased due to collision with another object.

Wait, that would mean that the ball's velocity is lower than it should be. So the predicted (based on free fall) would be higher. But if the actual velocity is lower, the photogate's measurement would be lower than the prediction. So in that case, the prediction is higher. So option C would cause the measured velocity to be lower than the prediction, which fits the scenario.

Alternatively, option E: The acceleration of gravity varies as the ball is falling. So if the acceleration isn't g, say it's less than g, then the velocity would be lower than the prediction. So the prediction would be higher, and the measurement is lower. So that would fit the scenario too.

Wait, but the question says the ball is falling 6 meters, then passes through the photogate. So the time taken is fixed. So in reality, if the acceleration is less than g, the ball would take longer to fall, maybe passing the photogate at a lower velocity. Alternatively, if acceleration is more than g, the ball would fall faster, so perhaps the time is longer, but the distance is fixed, which isn't possible. Wait, no, the distance is fixed. So if in reality, the ball's acceleration is different, that would change the time taken to fall 6m, but the photogate's measurement is based on the time it takes to pass through — but wait, the time taken to pass through would depend on the velocity, which would be different if the acceleration isn't g.

Wait, let's think about it. Let's say the ball is in a region where the acceleration isn't g. Let's say in the region under the photogate, the acceleration is a, which is different from g.

In free fall (g=9.8 m/s²), the time to pass the photogate is t. Now, in a region with a different a, the velocity when it passes the photogate would be v = a * t. But the time t for the ball to pass the gate in the region with a is calculated as the time when the velocity at that point is v.

Wait, but the time to pass through the gate depends on the velocity and the distance between gates. No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the photogate is in a region where the acceleration is lower. So the ball's velocity when it passes through is lower than it would be in free fall. So the measurement would be lower than the prediction, which is 20% higher. So the answer would be option C: the ball's velocity decreased due to collision with another object.

Another possibility is that the ball is not falling freely. So, perhaps the photogate is in a region where the ball is decelerating. So, for example, if the ball is slowing down, the velocity when it passes the photogate is lower than it would be in free fall. So the prediction is based on free fall, which would be higher, but the actual is lower. So the prediction is higher, and the actual is lower. The question says the prediction is 20% higher than the actual. So that would fit.

Alternatively, maybe the ball is in a region where the acceleration isn't constant. So, for instance, the photogate is measuring a lower acceleration, leading to a lower velocity.

Wait, but the ball is in free fall. So unless the photogate is measuring a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the ball is not in free fall because the photogate is in a region with a different acceleration. So the ball, when it falls, would have a different acceleration, causing it to pass the photogate at a lower velocity than it would in free fall. So the measured velocity is lower than the prediction. But the question says the prediction is 20% higher than the measured. So prediction (120% of measured) would be lower than the prediction if the measured is lower.

Wait, let's think. If the prediction is the velocity in free fall, which is 10.84 m/s, and the actual is 8.67 m/s — so the prediction is 120% of the actual. Then the prediction is higher than the actual. But the question says the prediction is higher than the measured. So the measured is lower than the prediction, which implies that the prediction is higher than the actual. But if the prediction is based on free fall, and the actual is lower, that would be a problem.

Wait, perhaps the photogate isn't measuring in the same frame. So, if the ball is in a region where the acceleration is lower, the velocity when it passes the photogate is lower than it would be in free fall. So, the prediction is 10.84 m/s in free fall, but the actual is 8.67 m/s. So the prediction is higher than the actual. But according to the question, the prediction is higher than the measured. So the prediction is 20% higher than the measured, so the measured is lower than the prediction.

Wait, perhaps the photogate is measuring the velocity when the ball passes through a region where the acceleration is lower. So the ball would have a lower velocity, leading to a lower measured value. But how does that affect the prediction.

Alternatively, perhaps the ball is not in free fall because the photogate is in a region with a different acceleration. So the ball, when it falls, would have a different acceleration, causing it to pass the photogate at a lower velocity than it would in free fall. So the measured velocity is lower than the prediction. But the question says the prediction is 20% higher than the measured. So prediction (120% of measured) would be lower than the prediction if the measured is lower.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach the possible options.

Option C: The ball's velocity decreased due to collision with another object.

If this happened, the velocity would decrease, so the photogate's measurement would be lower than in free fall. So the prediction (based on free fall) would be higher than the actual. So the question says the prediction is 20% higher than the measured. So the prediction is higher. So the actual is lower. So the prediction is higher than actual, which is lower than the prediction. So this fits.

Option E: The acceleration of gravity varies as the ball is falling.

If the acceleration is less than g, then the ball would fall faster, so the time to pass the photogate would be shorter. So the velocity when it passes the photogate would be lower than in free fall. So the prediction is higher than actual, which is lower than prediction. So the question says the prediction is higher than measured, which is correct in this scenario. So both options C and E could fit.

But wait, the question says the ball is in free fall. So unless the photogate is in a region where the ball is decelerating, which happens if the photogate is in a region where the ball is coming from a different direction, like the ball is on the other side of the photogate, so the ball is decelerating.

Wait, but the ball is a tennis ball, which is a solid sphere. So when it's in free fall, it's symmetric. But if the ball is on the other side of the photogate, which is a sensor, then the ball would be decelerating.

So, perhaps the ball is in a region where it's decelerating because of being on the other side of the photogate. So, in that case, the ball's velocity is lower than in free fall, leading to a lower measured velocity, which is lower than the prediction. So the prediction is higher than the actual, which is lower than prediction. Hence, the question says the prediction is 20% higher than the measured, which is correct.

So, the reason is that the ball is on the other side of the photogate, leading to deceleration, which lowers the measured velocity, which is lower than the prediction. Therefore, the answer is option C.

Alternatively, if the ball is in a region where the acceleration is lower, causing the velocity to be lower, then the measured velocity is lower than the prediction. So the scenario is that the ball is not in free fall but is decelerating.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, the ball was in free fall. So perhaps the question is referring to a case where the ball is not in free fall due to the photogate being in a region where the ball is decelerating, thus the velocity measured is lower than it would be in free fall. Hence, the prediction is higher than the measured.

So the correct answer would be option C.
</think>

The question involves a tennis ball falling 6 meters and passing through a photogate, where the predicted velocity is 20% higher than the measured velocity. The task is to determine why the measured velocity is lower than the predicted one.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Free Fall Velocity Calculation**:  
   The ball falls 6 meters. Using the equation \( s = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \), where \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), the time \( t \) is approximately \( 1.1066 \, \text{s} \). The velocity at this time is \( v = g t = 10.84 \, \text{m/s} \).

2. **Measured Velocity**:  
   The photogate measures the velocity as the ball passes through. If the ball is decelerating due to being on the other side of the photogate, the velocity measured would be lower than \( 10.84 \, \text{m/s} \).

3. **Prediction and Measurement Relationship**:  
   The prediction is based on free fall, which predicts a velocity of \( 10.84 \, \text{m/s} \). If the ball is decelerating, the measured velocity would be lower, say \( 8.67 \, \text{m/s} \). The prediction is 20% higher than the measured velocity because \( 10.84 \times 1.2 = 13.008 \), which is incorrect. Instead, \( 8.67 \, \text{m/s} \) is 20% lower than \( 10.84 \, \text{m/s} \) because \( 10.84 \times 0.8 = 8.67 \, \text{m/s} \).

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The ball is decelerating due to being on the other side of the photogate, causing the measured velocity to be lower than the prediction. This results in the prediction being 20% higher than the measured velocity.

### Correct Answer:
C) The ball's velocity decreased due to collision with another object.
