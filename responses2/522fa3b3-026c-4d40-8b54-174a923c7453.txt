Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to eliminate evaluation apprehension in social psychology experiments. Hmm, evaluation apprehension is when participants feel anxious about being evaluated, right? That can lead to poor performance or even negative behaviors. So, I need to think about ways to reduce that.

Looking at the options, option A suggests using peers as participants. I'm not sure about that. If I use peers, maybe I can control for the evaluation, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe using neutral participants would be better because they aren't subjecting others to the same fears.

Option B is about offering financial incentives. I remember hearing that money can reduce stress. If subjects feel better about participating, they might perform better. That sounds plausible because financial rewards can provide a sense of control and make the experiment more enjoyable.

Option C talks about making participants aware they're being observed. If they know they'll be watched, they might feel less anxious. But I'm not sure if that's a common practice. Sometimes it's about ethics, but maybe it's more about the control of the experiment itself.

Option D is about using field experimentation and nonobtrusive methods. Field experiments are in the real world, which reduces the influence of the experimenters' expectations. Nonobtrusive means they don't stand out or intrusive. This could help in minimizing the impact of observers.

Option E is about providing false feedback. If participants get incorrect information, they might think they're doing something wrong and avoid it. Maybe that reduces anxiety.

Option F is about increasing the number of observers. More observers can make the experiment less noticeable, which might help reduce anxiety.

Option G is about a double-blind procedure. If both participants and experimenter don't know each other's goals, it could reduce bias and make the experiment more controlled, which might lower evaluation.

Option H is about a familiar environment. If the setting is known, participants might feel more secure, which could decrease anxiety.

Let me think about each option. The question is about eliminating evaluation. So, the goal is to ensure that participants feel safe and don't worry about being evaluated.

Option A: Using peers as subjects. If the experiment is with neutral participants, maybe less fear. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Option B: Financial incentives. Yes, I've heard of experiments where cash rewards reduce stress. It's a common technique to make the experiment more enjoyable for the participants.

Option C: Making them aware. Well, if they know they'll be watched, maybe they'll stay more composed. But sometimes that's about the control of the experiment itself rather than the participants.

Option D: Field vs. controlled. Field experiments are done in real settings, so less controlled, but not necessarily less anxious. Maybe in the real world, they can observe others without feeling watched. Nonobtrusive methods ensure that only one person is observed, which might reduce the influence of others.

Option E: False feedback. If subjects get incorrect feedback, they might think they're not doing well and avoid the task, which reduces anxiety.

Option G: Double-blind. This can reduce bias, making the experiment more objective, which might lower the anxiety of participants.

Option H: Familiar environment. A known environment might make participants feel more secure, less anxious.

So, which method is best? The question is about eliminating evaluation, so methods that reduce the fear of being evaluated are better. 

Option D and E both involve reducing the observer's influence. Field experiments and nonobtrusive methods are about minimizing the effect of observers. Alternatively, using a double-blind procedure (G) also reduces bias, which might reduce anxiety.

Wait, but the question is asking about eliminating evaluation apprehension. So, perhaps the most effective methods are field experiments (D), nonobtrusive observation (C), or double-blind (G), or financial incentives (B).

Option E is about false feedback, which could make participants think they're not doing well, thus reducing anxiety. So, maybe financial incentives or false feedback are effective.

Alternatively, making them aware (C) might also help, but I'm not sure if that's a common approach.

Another thought: when you conduct experiments with participants who are aware they're being watched, do they become more anxious? Or are they more cautious? I think they might feel more anxious, which is the opposite of what we want.

So, perhaps using a double-blind procedure (G) or field experiments (D) would be better, as they reduce the impact of the experimenters' intent.

Alternatively, offering financial incentives (B) directly addresses the anxiety by reducing the need for fear.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between options B, D, E, and G.

Another point: some experiments can have higher rates of evaluation because of the expectation of being watched. So, perhaps using non-intrusive methods (like option C) would help in this.

Wait, but the question is about eliminating evaluation, not reducing it. So, if you have an experiment where participants are aware (C), they might feel more anxious, which is bad. So option C isn't the way to eliminate, but to reduce it.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to eliminate the reason for the anxiety. So, if you avoid the anxiety itself, like making the experiment more neutral, then you can reduce the fear.

So, which option is about making the experiment less about evaluation? Option D is about using field experiments, which are in the real world and less controlled. That might reduce the fear because the experimenters have less to worry about, and participants don't have to worry about being watched.

Alternatively, making the experiment less about observation (C) would be the opposite; but that's not an option.

Alternatively, using a double-blind (G) could prevent bias, but not necessarily directly reduce anxiety.

Option E is about providing false feedback, which might reduce the fear of being evaluated because participants think they're doing poorly.

So, which of these is the best way to eliminate evaluation? The options that directly prevent participants from worrying about being watched.

Option D says using field experimentation and nonobtrusive approaches, which likely reduces the influence of observers, thus reducing anxiety.

Option E is about false feedback, but it's about the feedback given, not the fact that they're being watched.

So, the best answer would be either D or E.

Wait, another point: in some experiments, participants are allowed to observe others, but they might not feel watched. Nonobtrusive methods (option C) ensure that only one person is observed, which could reduce the perception of being watched. But that's not exactly the same as eliminating evaluation.

Alternatively, making the experiment more neutral (option C) but is that an option? Looking back, option C isn't present. The options are A to H.

So, among the provided options, the correct answer would be D: Through field experimentation and 'nonobtrusive' approaches. Because field experiments are in the real world, which reduces the experiment's control and the influence of observers. Nonobtrusive means only one person is observed, so it's easier to ensure that the focus is on the participant, not the observer.

Alternatively, option E: By providing false feedback. If participants don't realize they're being evaluated, they might think they're not doing well, thus reducing anxiety.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. The main issue is participants feeling anxious about being watched. So, methods to reduce that.

Option E: False feedback. If the feedback is wrong, maybe participants think they're not doing well, thus avoid the experiment. That might reduce anxiety. Alternatively, making the experiment more neutral (C), but that's not an option.

So, the options given don't include making the experiment neutral, but D and E are about reducing the observer's influence.

Between D and E, which one is correct?

Another approach is to think about the impact of each option. Option E is about the feedback, not the presence of observers. So, if the experiment is done in a real environment, people might feel more secure, less concerned about being watched. That could reduce evaluation.

Option D is about field experiments and nonobtrusive methods, which also reduces the presence of observers. So both options D and E could be correct, but the question is about eliminating the evaluation apprehension.

Wait, the question is about eliminating the anxiety. So, perhaps the best way is to remove the reason for the anxiety. So, making the experiment more neutral, perhaps by not having observers present, which would be option C. But option C isn't an option here. So, among the provided options, D and E are the most relevant.

Alternatively, financial incentives (B) could help, but perhaps the best is making them aware (C), which isn't an option.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think: When you conduct experiments, participants might worry about being watched. So, methods to reduce that.

Option A: Using peers. If you don't have other participants, maybe it's less of a problem. But if you have peers, perhaps the anxiety is reduced. But I'm not sure.

Option B: Financial incentives. Yes, I've heard that. It's a common technique to reduce fear of being evaluated.

Option C: Making them aware. If they know they're being watched, maybe their anxiety is reduced. But I think they might feel more anxious, not less. So that's the opposite of what we want.

Option D: Field and nonobtrusive. That's about the experiment being in real settings, so less controlled, so less observers. That could reduce anxiety.

Option E: False feedback. If they get incorrect feedback, they might avoid the task, reducing anxiety.

So, between B, D, E.

Option B is about a financial incentive, which is a direct way to reduce anxiety.

Option D is about field experiments and nonobtrusive methods. So, the field approach would make the experiment less in the controlled lab, which might reduce the impact of observers.

But which is better? I'm not sure. I think the question is about the best method, and the most effective is D. Or perhaps E.

Alternatively, I remember that in some experiments, providing false feedback can reduce anxiety because participants might think they're not doing well, avoiding the task. So, E is a possible correct answer.

Wait, the options: E says "By offering subjects with false feedback on their performance." So, if subjects get incorrect information, they might think they're not performing well and avoid the task. That reduces anxiety.

So, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If you have a real-world experiment, you're not in a controlled setting, so less control, less observers, and less fear. That would help reduce evaluation.

So, the correct answer would be D: Through field experimentation and 'nonobtrusive' approaches.

Alternatively, making them aware (C) is a way to prevent being watched, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the best is D.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. The question is about eliminating evaluation apprehension, which is about reducing the fear of being watched.

The best way is to make the environment less about observation and more about the task at hand. So, using field experiments (D) or making the experiment more neutral (C). But since C isn't an option, perhaps D is the way.

Alternatively, making them aware (C) would also help, but it's not an option.

So, the answer is D: Through field experimentation and 'nonobtrusive' approaches. Because field experiments are done in real settings, making the experiment less about observers and more about the task itself, thus reducing the presence of observers and the fear of being watched.

To eliminate evaluation apprehension in social psychology experiments, the goal is to reduce the anxiety participants feel about being observed or evaluated. Among the provided options, the most effective approach is to ensure the experiment is conducted in a real-world setting (field experimentation) and to use nonobtrusive methods. This reduces the influence of observers and the presence of controlled conditions, thereby minimizing the fear of being evaluated. 

Answer: D
