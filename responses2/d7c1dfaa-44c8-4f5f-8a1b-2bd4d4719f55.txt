Okay, so I have this question about inventory turnover rate. I'm a bit rusty on my financial concepts, but let's try to work through it.

The question is asking what procedure determines the inventory turnover rate. The options are A to J, each with a different formula. I remember that inventory turnover measures how many times a company sells and replaces its stock of goods during a period. So, a higher turnover rate means the company is selling and restocking its products quickly.

I think the key here is to find the formula that involves both the cost of goods sold and the average inventory. Because turnover is about how efficiently inventory is used, it's about the ratio of how much inventory you sell versus how much you have on hand.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Divide total inventory by cost of goods sold. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Total inventory might not be the same as the average. Also, cost of goods sold is part of the calculation, but I'm not sure how that would relate directly.

Option B: Add beginning and ending inventory, divide by ending. No, I don't think that's right. The average inventory is usually calculated by averaging the beginning and ending inventory, not adding them.

Option C: Add cost of goods sold to ending inventory, then divide by beginning. That doesn't seem right either. The formula for average inventory is (beginning + ending)/2, not adding and then dividing.

Option D: Divide cost of goods sold by average inventory. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because turnover is a ratio, but I think the correct ratio is COGS divided by average inventory. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Because the formula is (COGS / Average Inventory), but looking at the options, none of them seem to match that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A. Total inventory / COGS → No.

B. (Beginning + Ending) / Ending → No, average isn't the average.

C. COGS + Ending / Beginning → No, that would be (COGS + E) / B.

D. COGS / Average → So (B + E)/2. So COGS / ((B+E)/2) = 2 COGS / (B+E). That's not the standard formula. I thought the standard is COGS / Average Inventory. But none of the options seems to match that.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the terms. Another way: Average inventory is (B + E)/2. Then, inventory turnover is COGS divided by average inventory. So the formula is COGS / ( (B + E)/2 ) → which is 2 COGS / (B + E). But looking at the options, is any of them that?

Looking at the options, let me see which one matches 2 COGS / (B + E). Hmm, none of the options seem to match that. Let's read the options again.

Option D is COGS divided by average inventory. So that would be COGS / [(B+E)/2] = 2 COGS/(B+E). So yes, that's the same as 2 multiplied by COGS divided by the sum. So which option is that? None of the options seem to present that formula.

Wait, looking again at the options in the given list:

Option D: Divide the cost of goods sold by the average inventory.

Yes, that's exactly COGS divided by average inventory. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait another moment. I thought the formula was COGS divided by average inventory, which is the same as 2 COGS / (B + E). So if the question is asking for the correct formula, then the correct answer is D.

Wait, but another option: Option G is Divide the cost of goods sold by the average inventory. So yes, that's the same as D. So D is the correct formula.

Wait, but what about option E: Subtract COGS from average inventory. That doesn't make sense. It's more of a subtraction.

Option F: Multiply COGS by average inventory. That's a different calculation altogether.

Option H: Subtract average inventory from COGS. No, that doesn't make sense.

Option I: Multiply ending inventory by COGS and divide by beginning? That seems off. I don't think that's the right formula.

Option J: Add COGS to average inventory. No, that doesn't make sense.

So the correct formula is D. The correct answer should be D.

The correct procedure to determine inventory turnover rate involves dividing the cost of goods sold by the average inventory. The average inventory is calculated by averaging the beginning and ending inventory levels. Therefore, the formula is:

D: Divide the cost of goods sold by the average inventory.

Answer: D
