Question:

A man and a woman were passengers on a plane. They were seated next to one another in the first- class section of the plane. Midway through the flight, the woman excused herself and went to the restroom. While she was gone, the man rummaged through the woman's purse and stole $100 in cash. Unknown to the man, a flight attendant saw him steal the money. As is customary in such situations, the flight attendant radioed ahead, and police officers arrested the man when the plane landed. The man was subsequently charged with violating an applicable federal larceny statute. During the trial, the prosecuting attorney called the man's wife as a willing witness against her husband. She proposed to testify that the man confided to her that he did steal the woman's money during the flight. The man's attorney objected on the grounds of hearsay and privilege. The wife's proposed testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because it is privileged, though it is not hearsay.
B: admissible, because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.
C: admissible, because it is hearsay within a recognized exception and not privileged.
D: inadmissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
E: admissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
F: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception, and it discloses a privileged communication.
G: inadmissible, because it discloses a privileged communication, though it is not hearsay.
H: admissible, both because it does not disclose a privileged communication and because it is hearsay within a recognized exception.
I: inadmissible, because it is hearsay within a recognized exception, though it is not privileged.
J: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception, though it is not privileged.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the wife's statement is admissible as a defense in this case. Let's break down the scenario.

So, a man and a woman are in first-class on a plane. The woman exits midway, and the man steals $100 in cash by rummaging through her purse. The flight attendant noticed him and radioed ahead, and the police arrested him. Now, the man is charged with a larceny statute.

The prosecuting attorney called his wife as a witness. The wife claims he confessed to stealing the money. The man's attorney objects because the wife's statement is hearsay and privilege. Now, the question is whether the wife's statement is admissible.

I remember that hearsay is any statement that is made to another person, except in certain cases. Privilege applies when the speaker is in a position of privilege, like being a witness. But in some cases, statements made while in a position of privilege are protected by privilege, so they're not hearsay.

In this case, the man was a passenger. When the woman exited midway, he was in front of her. He then went to the restroom and stole the money. The flight attendant noticed him while he was going through the purse. So, when he confessed, was he in a position of privilege? Well, he was in front of her, which is a privilege. So, the statement that he confessed is protected by privilege.

But the wife's statement is about him confiding to her. So that's hearsay because it's a statement made to a person. However, if the statement was made in a position of privilege, the hearsay would be invalid because the privilege protects the statement.

Wait, but the issue here is whether the statement is hearsay or not. So, the fact that he confessed is hearsay, but since he was in a position of privilege (being in front of her), the privilege protects the statement from being hearsay. So, the hearsay objection is invalid because the statement is protected.

But wait, that's only if the hearsay was made in a privilege position. So, the wife's statement is hearsay, but because it was made in a privilege position, it's not hearsay. So, the hearsay objection is not valid. So the statement isn't hearsay.

Therefore, the wife's statement is admissible because it's not hearsay and it's protected by privilege. But the issue is whether it's hearsay in the first place. Since it's a statement to a friend (the wife), it's hearsay. But the privilege (being in front of her) protects it from being hearsay.

So, the statement is hearsay but protected by privilege, so it's admissible. So, the statement is allowed because the hearsay exception is satisfied (hearsay because it's to a person, but protected), so it's admissible.

Looking at the options, the options are about whether the statement is admissible.

Option A: Admissible as privileged, not hearsay. That seems right because it's hearsay but protected.

Option B: Admissible because neither hearsay nor privileged. That doesn't make sense because it's clearly hearsay, but protected.

Option C: Admissible as hearsay within a recognized exception and not privileged. No, because it's not hearsay, so it's not hearsay, so C is wrong.

Option D: Inadmissible because it discloses a privilege and isn't hearsay. Wait, does it disclose a privilege? No, the privilege is in the circumstances, not the content of the statement. So D says it's hearsay and privilege, but I think it's hearsay and protected. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Admissible because doesn't disclose privilege and is hearsay within an exception. But E says it's inadmissible on hearsay grounds. But if it's protected, it's allowed. So E is wrong because it's allowed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.

The statement is hearsay because it's about a privilege position. But the privilege protects it from being hearsay. So, the hearsay objection is invalid. Therefore, the statement is admissible because it's not hearsay. So, the correct reasoning is that the statement is hearsay but protected by privilege, making it admissible.

So looking at the options, the correct one is A: admissible because it is privileged, though it is not hearsay.

Alternatively, option E says it's inadmissible because it's hearsay not within any exception, but I don't think that's correct because the hearsay exception is satisfied.

Wait, no. Let me review the hearsay rules. A hearsay statement must not be made to a third party, or the statement must not be made during a privilege position.

In this case, the woman exited; the man was front of her. So, when he confessed, was he in a privilege position? He was in front of her, so yes. Therefore, the statement is hearsay, but it's made in a privilege position, so it's protected.

So, the hearsay objection is invalid because it's protected by privilege. Therefore, the statement is admissible. So the correct option is A: admissible because it is privileged, though it is not hearsay.

Wait, no, wait. Option A says it's admissible because it is privileged, though not hearsay. But I think the statement is hearsay but protected. So, the hearsay objection is invalid, so the statement is admissible.

So the correct reasoning is that the statement is hearsay but protected by privilege, making it admissible. So, the correct option is A.

Wait, but looking back, the options say:

A: admissible, because it is privileged, though it is not hearsay.

Wait, but if the statement is hearsay and protected by privilege, then it's allowed. So, the hearsay objection is not valid because of the privilege. So the statement is allowed.

Thus, option A is correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. If the statement is hearsay, it's not admissible unless it's not hearsay. But if it's hearsay but protected, then it's admissible.

So, the answer is that the statement is admissible because the hearsay exception is satisfied (it's not hearsay) and the privilege protects it from being hearsay, making it admissible.

So the correct answer is option A.
</think>

The woman exited midway, and the man, in front of her, stole the money. The flight attendant noticed him while he was in the restroom, and his confession was made during a privilege position. The wife's testimony that he confessed is hearsay because it involves a privilege position. However, the privilege protects the statement from being hearsay, making it admissible.

**Option A** correctly identifies that the statement is admissible because it is privileged, though it is not hearsay. This is because the hearsay objection is invalid due to the privilege, allowing the statement to bypass hearsay exceptions.
