Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because static friction is a tricky topic. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a coin on a turntable. The maximum distance from the center where the coin doesn't slide. Oh right, static friction is involved here. So I remember that static friction provides the necessary centripetal force for the coin to stay in place as the turntable rotates.

The given data: the coefficient of static friction (μs) is 0.30. The turntable's rotation speed is 33.3 revolutions per minute. I think I need to find the maximum distance 'r' from the center where the coin doesn't slip.

Wait, the formula I remember involves the centripetal force being provided by static friction. So, the maximum static friction force is μs * m * g, where m is the mass of the coin and g is the acceleration due to gravity. And that friction force provides the necessary centripetal force for circular motion.

Centripetal force is given by (m * v²) / r. So, setting these equal: μs * m * g = (m * v²) / r. Oh wait, the mass 'm' should cancel out, which makes sense because it's the same object.

So, rearranging for r: r = v² / (μs * g). But wait, I don't have the velocity 'v'; I have revolutions per minute. I need to convert that to meters per second.

Let me calculate the velocity. 33.3 revolutions per minute is the rotation speed. One revolution is 2π radians, so per minute it's 33.3 * 2π. But I need meters per second, so I should convert that.

So, 33.3 rev/min. Let me compute that in terms of radians per second. 

First, 1 revolution is 2π radians. So, 33.3 rev/min is 33.3 * 2π rad/min. To get radians per second, divide by 60: (33.3 * 2π) / 60.

Calculating that: 33.3 * 2 is 66.6, so 66.6 * π ≈ 210.56 radians per minute. Then, divide by 60 to get rad/s: 210.56 / 60 ≈ 3.5093 rad/s.

Wait, but wait, 33.3 rev/min — I'm not sure if the exact value is needed. Wait, 33.3 is approximately 100/3. Because 33.3 is 100/3, right? So maybe I can use exact fractions to avoid approximations.

So, 100/3 rev/min. Multiply by 2π to get radians per minute: (100/3) * 2π = (200π)/3 rad/min. Convert to rad/s by dividing by 60: (200π)/(3*60) = (200π)/(180) = (10π)/9 ≈ 3.4907 rad/s.

Wait, but maybe I should keep it as (200π)/(3*60) = (10π)/(9) rad/s. So v = (10π/9) m/s.

Wait, let me compute that again. 33.3 rev/min is the same as 33.3 * 2π rad/min. Let me compute this more accurately.

33.3 * 2 = 66.6 → 66.6 * π ≈ 210.06 radians per minute. Divided by 60: 210.06 /60 ≈ 3.501 radians per second.

Wait, but I think I should approach it using the given value. Alternatively, maybe I should leave the velocity in terms of 'n' revolutions per minute and plug in the numbers.

Wait, let's think again. Another approach: the linear speed v is related to angular velocity ω by v = ω * r. But I think I need to find ω in rad/s.

So, ω = (33.3 rev/min) * (2π rad/rev) * (1 min/60 s) ) → ω = (33.3 * 2π ) /60 rad/s.

33.3 *2 =66.6 → 66.6π /60 = (66.6/60) * π ≈ 1.11 * π ≈ 3.487 radians per second.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately.

33.3 * 2 =66.6. 66.6 /60 is 1.11. So 1.11 * π ≈ 3.487 rad/s.

So then, v = ω * r → r = v / ω.

Wait, but earlier I thought the formula is r = v²/(μs g), but according to that, v is linear speed. So, that part is correct. But v is expressed in terms of ω and r. So, substituting v:

r = (ω r)^2/(μs g) → wait, no, that's not correct. Let me re-express.

Wait, the centripetal force is μs * m * g = m v² / r → so v² = μs * g * r. So, v = sqrt( μs * g * r ). So, v squared is μs g r.

So, substituting into r = v²/(μs g) → r = (μs g r) / (μs g) → r = r → which leads me to realize that perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Hmm, that can't be right. Let me try again.

Wait, correct substitution is: from the equation μs * m g = m v² /r → the m's cancel. So, μs g = v² / r → v² = μs g r → r = v²/(μs g).

But wait, v is the linear speed, which is ω r. So, substitute v = ω r into the equation: r = ( (ω r )^2 )/( μs g ) → r = ( ω² r² )/( μs g )

Then, divide both sides by r (assuming r not zero) → 1 = ( ω² r )/( μs g ) → r = μs g / ( ω² )

Ah, okay, that makes more sense.

So, r = (μs * g ) / (ω² )

So, I need to compute ω.

Wait, earlier I calculated ω as approximately 3.487 rad/s. Let me make exact calculations.

33.3 rev/min → 33.3 * 2π rad/min = (66.6π) rad/min → divided by 60 to get rad/s:

ω = 66.6π / 60 = (66.6 /60) * π = 1.11 * π ≈ 3.487 rad/s.

But perhaps I should use the exact value for ω. Let me calculate 66.6/60 = 1.11. So, ω = 1.11 * π ≈ 3.487.

Now, plug into r = (μs * g ) / (ω² )

μs = 0.30, g ≈9.8 m/s².

So,

r = (0.30 * 9.8) / ( (1.11 * π )^2 )

Compute numerator: 0.30 *9.8=2.94.

Denominator: (1.11 * π )^2.

1.11 * π ≈ 3.487, so squared is about (3.487)^2 = approx 12.16.

So, r ≈ 2.94 / 12.16 ≈ 0.2416 m. Approximately 0.242 m.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.242 m.

But wait, let me double-check the exact calculation.

Wait, let me compute (1.11 * π )^2.

1.11 is 100/90 ≈ 1.111… but perhaps using more precise numbers.

Wait, 1.11 is 1.11 exactly, but perhaps using 1.11 is an approximation. Let me compute 1.11 * π more accurately.

1.11 * π = 1.11 * 3.1415926535 ≈ 3.49066.

So, squared is 3.49066^2 → let's compute that.

3.49066 *3.49066.

3.49 *3.49 is about 12.18, but let me compute it precisely.

3.49066 × 3.49066:

Break it down:

= (3 + 0.49066)^2 = 3^2 + 2*3*0.49066 + (0.49066)^2.

=9 + 2.94396 + 0.2407 ≈ 9 + 2.94396 is 11.94396, plus 0.2407 is 12.18466.

So denominator is 12.18466.

Numerator is 2.94.

So r = 2.94 / 12.18466 ≈ 0.2416 m.

So approximately 0.242 m, which is option E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 0.242 m. So that's the answer.

To determine the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide, we analyze the forces acting on the coin. The static friction provides the necessary centripetal force to keep the coin in circular motion. The relationship is given by:

\[
\mu_s \cdot m \cdot g = \frac{m \cdot v^2}{r}
\]

where:
- \( \mu_s \) is the coefficient of static friction (\( 0.30 \)),
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (\( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)),
- \( v \) is the linear speed of the coin,
- \( r \) is the distance from the center of the turntable.

The linear speed \( v \) is related to the angular velocity \( \omega \) by \( v = \omega \cdot r \). Substituting \( v = \omega \cdot r \) into the equation:

\[
\mu_s \cdot m \cdot g = \frac{m \cdot (\omega \cdot r)^2}{r}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\mu_s \cdot g = \omega^2 \cdot r
\]

Rearranging for \( r \):

\[
r = \frac{\mu_s \cdot g}{\omega^2}
\]

Next, calculate \( \omega \), the angular velocity, using the given rotational speed of \( 33.3 \, \text{rev/min} \):

\[
\omega = \frac{33.3 \cdot 2\pi}{60} = \frac{66.6\pi}{60} \approx 3.487 \, \text{rad/s}
\]

Substitute \( \mu_s = 0.30 \), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( \omega \approx 3.487 \, \text{rad/s} \) into the equation for \( r \):

\[
r = \frac{0.30 \cdot 9.8}{(3.487)^2}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
0.30 \cdot 9.8 = 2.94
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
(3.487)^2 \approx 12.1847
\]

Now, divide:

\[
r = \frac{2.94}{12.1847} \approx 0.242 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the maximum distance from the center at which the coin will not slide is approximately \( 0.242 \, \text{m} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**E: 0.242 m**
