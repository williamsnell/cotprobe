Question:

Two men held-up a liquor store in a city. During the robbery, one of the participants shot and killed the owner of the store. Over a year later, police detectives arrested a defendant after obtaining reliable information that the defendant was the robber who was responsible for killing the store's owner. Afterward, the defendant was taken to the station house where he was booked for the crime and then incarcerated. The next day, the prosecuting attorney made a decision to delay indictment until he could discover the identity of the defendant's accomplice. The defendant was then released from police custody. In this jurisdiction the statute of limitations for murder is five years. Five months later, the prosecuting attorney, after unsuccessfully attempting to secure information on the defendant's cohort, indicted the defendant, charging him with felony murder. Shortly before trial, the only eyewitness to the crime died. He would have testified that the defendant did not participate in the robbery. The defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment because of the delay between the date of the crime and the date of the indictment will most probably be

Options:

A: denied, because the delay did not infringe upon the defendant's rights.
B: granted, because the delay in prosecuting the defendant actually prejudiced him.
C: granted, because the defendant was not given the opportunity to confront his accuser.
D: denied, because pre-indictment delay does not violate the Constitution, as long as it does not exceed an applicable statute of limitations.
E: denied, because the delay was not excessive and was for a permissible purpose.
F: granted, because the only eyewitness to the crime died before the trial.
G: denied, because the defendant was eventually charged within the statute of limitations.
H: denied, because the prosecutor had a valid reason to delay the indictment.
I: granted, because the prosecutor failed to find the defendant's accomplice.
J: granted, because the prosecutor is constitutionally required to press charges, if at all, within a reasonable time after probable cause is established.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out this murder question. So, the scenario is two men held up a liquor store, and one shot the owner. A defendant was arrested after reliable info that he was the robber. Then he was booked and incarcerated the next day. Then the prosecuting attorney delays the indictment because they didn't get much info on the accomplice. The defendant is released, and five months later, they're indicted on felony murder. But the only eyewitness died. 

The question is about whether the defendant's motion to dismiss is granted or not. The options are A to J, with several possible answers.

So, the key points here are the statute of limitations, the delay in-indictment, and whether the delay could be considered within the statute of limitations.

The murder statute here is five years. The trial is five months after the delay. The witness died before the trial. So, the delay is five months, which is less than a year, so within the five-year statute of limitations.

But wait, the defendant was released after being booked, which I think is a default upon arrest. If the defendant was released, does that affect the possibility of an alibi or the ability to contest the delay? Because if he was released, he might have had an alibi. But the witness died before the trial, so maybe the alibi is still on him.

So, let's think about the motion to dismiss. The defendant's motion is based on the delay between the crime and the indictment. The statute of limitations for murder in this jurisdiction is five years. So, the trial is five months after delay. That's within the five-year period. So, the delay doesn't extend the statute of limitations. Therefore, the motion should be granted because the delay is within the time frame.

But another angle is whether the delay affected the defendant's ability to present evidence. Wait, the defendant was released, so perhaps there's no need to present the accomplice. But the defense is about the delay itself, not about the accomplice. The delay is about the delay in-indictment, not about the time between the crime and the trial.

So, the defendant's motion is about the delay between the crime and the indictment, not the delay between the crime and trial. So, the delay is within the five-year statute of limitations, so the motion is granted.

Looking at the options:

Option D says the motion was denied because the delay was within the statute. So, D would be correct.

Option B says the delay actually prejudiced the defendant, but that's not correct. The delay is within the time frame. The fact that the witness died only means the alibi is still on him, but the delay doesn't affect the possibility of the defendant being able to present the evidence.

Option H says the prosecutor had a valid reason to delay. That's not correct because the reason was just to delay the indictment. The defense's main point is the delay.

So, the correct answer is D. Because the delay is within the five-year statute of limitations, the motion is granted.

The defendant's motion to dismiss is granted because the delay in-indictment (five months) does not exceed the five-year statute of limitations. The witness's death before trial does not negate the defense's claim. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: denied, because pre-indictment delay does not violate the Constitution, as long as it does not exceed an applicable statute of limitations.**

ANSWER: D
