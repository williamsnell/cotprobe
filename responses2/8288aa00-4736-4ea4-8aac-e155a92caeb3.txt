Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a rifle firing a bullet, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see, the question is split into three parts (a, b, c) asking about recoil speeds in different scenarios. I'll take each part one by one.

Starting with part (a): The rifle is free to move. The rifle weighs 7 pounds, shoots a 1-ounce bullet at 1120 feet per second. I remember that in such cases, momentum is conserved because there's no external force acting on the system. The momentum of the rifle plus the bullet before firing should equal the momentum after firing, but since the rifle is moving and the bullet is stationary (or at rest), the momentum after is just the rifle's recoil momentum.

Wait, but wait. When the rifle fires, the bullet moves forward, so the rifle must move backward. So the initial momentum is zero because the system (rifle + bullet) is at rest. After firing, the momentum is the sum of the rifle's momentum and the bullet's.

So, the equation would be: m_rifle * v_r + m_bullet * v_b = 0.

Here, m_rifle is 7 pounds, but I need to convert that to ounces because the bullet's mass is given in ounces. Wait, 1 pound is 16 ounces, so 7 pounds is 112 ounces.

The bullet is 1 ounce, and its speed is 1120 ft/s. So, m_rifle = 112 oz, mass of bullet is 1 oz.

So, 112 * v_r = 1 * 1120. Solving for v_r: v_r = (1 * 1120) / 112 = 10 ft/s. Since the rifle moves in the opposite direction, it's 10 ft/s backwards.

Wait, but I think the units might matter. Oh, the bullet's speed is in ft/s, so the recoil must be in ft/s as well.

So part (a) answer is 10 ft/s backwards.

Now moving to part (b): The rifle is held tightly against the shoulder of a man weighing 133 pounds. So, the man is part of the system. The rifle is fixed against his back, so the man and rifle together are the system.

The initial momentum is zero since everything is stationary. The momentum after firing is the sum of the system's momentum and the bullet's momentum.

So, (m_man + m_rifle) * v_r = m_bullet * v_b.

Wait, let me confirm: The bullet's speed is 1120 ft/s forward, and the man+bullet system moves backward. So the man's speed is negative relative to the rifle's recoil.

But the calculation: m_man is 133 pounds, which is 133 * 16 = 2128 ounces. rifle's mass is 7 pounds = 112 oz.

So, m_man + m_rifle = 2128 + 112 = 2240 oz.

The bullet's mass is 1 oz, speed 1120 ft/s forward.

So, 2240 * v_r = 1 * 1120.

v_r = 1120 / 2240 = 0.5 ft/s. Since the rifle is moving against the bullet, the recoil is 0.5 ft/s backwards.

Wait, but let me check the units again. The bullet's speed is given in feet per second, so the recoil speed should be in feet per second as well.

So part (b) answer is 0.5 ft/s backwards.

Part (c): The bullet embeds itself in a block of wood. The block weighs 3 pounds and 7 ounces. Let me convert that to ounces. 3 pounds is 48 oz, plus 7 is 55 oz. So the block is 55 oz, plus the bullet's mass of 1 oz makes 56 oz.

The block and bullet are moving together after the collision. So the system (block + bullet) will have a combined mass of 56 oz.

The initial momentum before the collision is the bullet's momentum, because the block is stationary. So, m_bullet * v_bullet = (m_block + m_bullet) * v_block.

The bullet's mass is 1 oz, speed 1120 ft/s. So,

1 * 1120 = (56) * v_block.

So, v_block = 1120 / 56 = 20 ft/s.

Since the bullet is embedded in the block and moves together, the block's speed is 20 ft/s forward.

Wait, but the question says the block is free to move, so yes, that's correct.

So part (c) is 20 ft/s forwards.

Now, looking at the options given:

Options are A to J, each with three parts (a, b, c) and each part has a speed and direction. Let me list the answers I got:

(a) 10 ft/s backwards
(b) 0.5 ft/s backwards
(c) 20 ft/s forwards

Now, looking at the options:

Option E: recoil speed 10 ft/s backwards, 0.5 ft/s backwards, 20 ft/s forwards.

Yes, that matches perfectly. So the correct option is E.

To solve the problem, we use the principle of conservation of momentum, which states that the total momentum before and after an event remains constant in the absence of external forces. Here's the breakdown of each part:

---

### Part (a): rifle free to move  
The rifle and bullet system is initially at rest. After firing, the momentum of the bullet equals the momentum of the rifle (opposite direction). The equation is:

\[
m_{\text{rifle}} \cdot v_{\text{rifle}} = m_{\text{bullet}} \cdot v_{\text{bullet}}
\]

Given:
- \( m_{\text{rifle}} = 7 \, \text{lb} = 112 \, \text{oz} \)
- \( m_{\text{bullet}} = 1 \, \text{oz} \)
- \( v_{\text{bullet}} = 1120 \, \text{ft/s} \)

\[
112 \cdot v_{\text{rifle}} = 1 \cdot 1120 \implies v_{\text{rifle}} = \frac{1120}{112} = 10 \, \text{ft/s} \, \text{backwards}
\]

---

### Part (b): rifle held tight against a man  
The man and rifle form a system. The initial momentum is zero, and the momentum after firing is the sum of the system's momentum and the bullet's momentum. The equation is:

\[
(m_{\text{man}} + m_{\text{rifle}}) \cdot v_{\text{rifle}} = m_{\text{bullet}} \cdot v_{\text{bullet}}
\]

Given:
- \( m_{\text{man}} = 133 \, \text{lb} = 2128 \, \text{oz} \)
- \( m_{\text{rifle}} = 7 \, \text{lb} = 112 \, \text{oz} \)
- \( m_{\text{man}} + m_{\text{rifle}} = 2240 \, \text{oz} \)

\[
2240 \cdot v_{\text{rifle}} = 1 \cdot 1120 \implies v_{\text{rifle}} = \frac{1120}{2240} = 0.5 \, \text{ft/s} \, \text{backwards}
\]

---

### Part (c): bullet embedded in a block  
The block and bullet form a system. The bullet's momentum is transferred to the block, and the system moves together. The equation is:

\[
m_{\text{bullet}} \cdot v_{\text{bullet}} = (m_{\text{block}} + m_{\text{bullet}}) \cdot v_{\text{block}}
\]

Given:
- \( m_{\text{block}} = 3 \, \text{lb} \, 7 \, \text{oz} = 55 \, \text{oz} \)
- \( m_{\text{bullet}} = 1 \, \text{oz} \)
- \( m_{\text{block}} + m_{\text{bullet}} = 56 \, \text{oz} \)

\[
1 \cdot 1120 = 56 \cdot v_{\text{block}} \implies v_{\text{block}} = \frac{1120}{56} = 20 \, \text{ft/s} \, \text{forward}
\]

---

### Final Answer  
The recoil speeds for each part are:
- (a) 10 ft/s backwards
- (b) 0.5 ft/s backwards
- (c) 20 ft/s forwards

This matches **Option E**.
