Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the demand deposit multiplier and the total addition to demand deposits when $100 is deposited into a bank, given a 100% required reserve ratio. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that the required reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that a bank must keep in reserve and not lend out. If it's 100%, that means the bank has to hold all of its deposits as reserves. So, for every dollar deposited, the bank can't create any additional money because they have to keep it all. 

Wait, but wait! I've heard about the money multiplier. Oh right, the money multiplier is the inverse of the required reserve ratio. So when the reserve ratio (RR) is 100%, that's 1. So the money multiplier M would be 1/RR, which is 1/1 = 1. 

The money multiplier tells us how much the money supply can potentially expand based on the initial deposit. So if you have an initial deposit of $100, the total money supply that can be created would be 100 multiplied by the money multiplier. That would be 100 * 1 = $100. But wait, what's the difference between the money multiplier and the money created? Oh, right, the multiplier is the factor by which the initial deposit increases the money supply. So the total addition to the deposit would be $100, because that's how the multiplier works.

Wait no, hold on. Let me think again. The money multiplier is 1, so the maximum money that can be created from an initial deposit is $100. But what about the existing deposits? Oh, the question is asking for the total addition to demand deposits, which would be the amount that the banking system can create as a result of the initial deposit. So the total addition is $100. 

Looking at the options, option J says 1 and $100. But wait, I thought the money multiplier is 1. Or maybe the money created is $100, which is the same as the initial deposit. So the demand deposit multiplier is 1, and the addition is $100. 

Wait another thought: the money multiplier is 1, meaning that each dollar deposited can only be used for exactly one dollar in the economy. So the initial $100 leads to a $100 increase in the money supply. So yes, the money multiplier is 1, and the total addition is $100. 

Looking at the options, option J is 1 and $100. But wait, another option is option E: 2 and $300. No, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. 

Wait, the money multiplier is 1 in this case because the required reserve ratio is 100%. So the money supply can't expand beyond the initial deposit. So the total addition is $100. So the answer should be J: 1 and $100. 

But wait, let's check all the options again. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Option E: 2 and $300. No, that's if the required ratio is 50%, which isn't the case here.

Option A: 3 and $300. Also wrong, same ratio.

Option B: 0.8 and $80. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Option C: 1.25 and $125. Also wrong.

Option D: 1.5 and $150. Nope.

Option F: 2 and $200. No.

Option G: 0.5 and $150. No.

Option H: 1 and $200. No, because the initial deposit is $100, not $200.

Option I: 0.5 and $50. No.

Option J: 1 and $100. Yes, that's what I thought.

Wait, but wait another thing. The money multiplier is 1, so the money that can be created is exactly the initial deposit. So the total addition would be $100. So the correct answer is J.

To determine the demand deposit multiplier and the total addition to demand deposits when $100 is deposited into a bank with a 100% required reserve ratio, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Required Reserve Ratio (RR):** The bank must hold 100% of deposits as reserves, meaning it cannot lend out any money. This implies no expansion of the money supply beyond the initial deposit.

2. **Money Multiplier (M):** The money multiplier is calculated as the inverse of the required reserve ratio: 
   \[
   M = \frac{1}{RR}
   \]
   Since RR is 100% (or 1), the money multiplier is:
   \[
   M = \frac{1}{1} = 1
   \]
   This means the initial deposit of $100 cannot be used to create additional money because the bank must hold all deposited funds as reserves.

3. **Total Addition to Demand Deposits:** The total addition to demand deposits is the initial deposit multiplied by the money multiplier:
   \[
   \text{Total Addition} = \text{Initial Deposit} \times M = 100 \times 1 = 100
   \]

4. **Evaluating the Options:** Among the given options, only option J correctly states the multiplier as 1 and the total addition as $100.
