Question:

Large deficits of water can be only partly compensated for by renal conservation; drinking is the ultimate compensatory mechanism. What stimulates the subjective feeling of thirst which drives one to drink water?

Options:

A: Decreased blood sodium levels
B: Low plasma osmolarity
C: Low body temperature
D: High blood pressure
E: Low levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
F: A high intracellular fluid volume
G: A low extracellular fluid volume and a high plasma osmolarity
H: High extracellular fluid volume
I: Increased saliva production
J: High glucose levels in the blood

Okay, so I've got this question about water conservation and thirst. Hmm, I remember that when the body can't get enough water, it often relies on the kidneys to compensate. Like, the kidneys let water out when the body is dehydrated, right? So water conservation is a big part of this. 

The question is asking what stimulates the subjective feeling of thirst, which is what drives drinking water. thirst is a primary motivator for drinking, so the answer must be something related to that.

I think the main thing that causes thirst is the body's need for water. When you feel wants for water, you drink it. So what triggers thirst? I remember something about osmolarity. When the body's fluid is concentrated, thirst increases. Because when you have more salt in your blood, your body wants to get water in to keep the fluid from being too salty. That makes me think that low plasma osmolarity is a good answer. Because if the plasma osmolarity is low, water needs to be replenished, so thirst is high.

Wait, looking at the options: B is low plasma osmolarity. That sounds right. But let me think if any other options could make sense. 

Option A: Decreased sodium levels. I'm not sure. Lower sodium could affect things like potassium or maybe blood pressure, but I don't think it directly causes thirst. thirst is more about needing water, not just sodium.

Option C: Low body temperature. Lower body temp might affect sweating and thermoregulation, but I don't recall it directly causing thirst. More about body functions, not the need for water.

Option D: High blood pressure. High blood pressure can also lead to dehydration, but high pressure is more about the overall system, not the immediate need to drink.

Option E: Low ADH. ADH is the antidiuretic hormone. High ADH would cause the kidneys to retain more water, so that would reduce thirst. So if E is low, then ADH is high, meaning more water is excreted, so less thirst. So E doesn't fit.

Option F: Low extracellular fluid volume. Extracellular fluid is the total body fluid. If it's low, that's more dehydration, so thirst increases. So F would mean more thirst, which doesn't fit the question about what causes thirst.

Option G: Low extracellular fluid and high plasma osmolarity. Wait, plasma osmolarity is just the amount in the blood. If extracellular is low, it's about overall fluid, not just in the blood. High plasma osmolarity would mean more water. But this option combines two things, but the question is about the cause of thirst, which is about the body's need for water, not the fluid volume.

Option I: Increased saliva production. More saliva means more water via sweating, which would be another way to compensate, but I don't think it's the primary or immediate reason for thirst.

Option J: High glucose. High glucose can cause thirst because glucose is a primary energy source. But I'm not sure if that's the main compensatory mechanism. Maybe more about storage than water. So likely not the best answer.

So, putting it together: thirst is driven by the body needing more water, which relates to low plasma osmolarity. So the correct answer is option B.

The question asks which factor stimulates the subjective feeling of thirst, which drives drinking water. thirst is a primary motivator for drinking water, and it is driven by the body's need for water. This need is related to the body's fluid balance, specifically plasma osmolarity, which is the concentration of dissolved salts in the blood. When the plasma osmolarity is low, the body needs to replenish water to maintain fluid balance, leading to thirst. 

Analyzing the options:
- **B: Low plasma osmolarity** is correct because it directly relates to the need for water.
- Other options either relate to different physiological processes (e.g., sodium levels, blood pressure, fluid volume changes) or do not directly address the need for water.

ANSWER: B
