Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully. The question is about an object being thrown horizontally from an open window of a building. The initial speed is 20 m/s, and it hits the ground after 2.0 seconds. I need to find the height from which it was thrown. The options are given, but I'll think through it step by step.

Hmm, right. So, the object is moving horizontally when it's thrown. I remember that when an object is in projectile motion, its horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other. So, the horizontal component doesn't affect the vertical motion. That's something I should remember.

The initial speed is entirely horizontal. So, the horizontal velocity remains constant because there's no air resistance (the problem says to neglect air resistance). That's good to know. But for the vertical motion, the object will accelerate downward due to gravity. 

Wait, I think I can use the equations of motion for the vertical direction here. The vertical motion is under constant acceleration (gravity), so the equation I should use is one that relates displacement, initial velocity, acceleration, and time.

Let me jot down the relevant equation. The vertical displacement (which would be the height from which the object was thrown) can be found using the formula:

s = ut + (1/2) a t²

Where:
- s is the vertical displacement (height, but since it's thrown downward, it'll be negative, but maybe I'll just take the magnitude)
- u is the initial vertical velocity
- a is the acceleration due to gravity
- t is time

Wait, the initial vertical velocity (u) is zero because the object is thrown horizontally. So, that term drops out. So the equation simplifies to:

s = 0.5 * g * t²

Oh, right. So I need to calculate the displacement s. Let me plug in the values. 

g is approximately 9.8 m/s². Time t is 2.0 seconds.

So, s = 0.5 * 9.8 * (2)^2.

Let me compute that step by step. 

First, 2 squared is 4. Then 0.5 *9.8 is 4.9. Multiply that by 4: 4.9 *4. Hmm, 4 times 4 is 16, 4 times 0.9 is 3.6. So 16 +3.6 is 19.6. Wait, wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, 4.9 *4 is 19.6. So s is 19.6 meters. But wait, wait. Wait, is that correct? Because the object is moving downward, the displacement is 19.6 meters downward. But the question is asking for the height from which it was thrown, which would be the vertical distance. So the height is 19.6 meters. Looking at the options, option E is 19.6 m. So that would be the answer.

Wait a second, let me check if I made any mistakes. Another way to think about it is that the vertical motion under free fall with initial velocity zero would make the displacement s = 0.5 * g * t². Yes, that's the formula. So 0.5 *9.8 is 4.9, t² is 4. 4.9 *4 is 19.6. So height is 19.6 m. Which is option E.

Wait, but I'm trying to think if maybe I mixed up the formula. Let me think again. The vertical displacement is s = (1/2) a t², because u is zero. So yes, correct.

So the answer should be E.
</think>

To determine the height from which the object was thrown, we analyze the vertical motion under constant acceleration due to gravity. Since the object is thrown horizontally, its initial vertical velocity is zero. The vertical displacement (height) can be calculated using the equation:

\[
s = \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

where:
- \( s \) is the vertical displacement (height),
- \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) is the acceleration due to gravity,
- \( t = 2.0 \, \text{s} \) is the time of flight.

Substituting the values:

\[
s = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9.8 \cdot (2.0)^2
\]

\[
s = 4.9 \cdot 4.0 = 19.6 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the height from which the object was thrown is \( 19.6 \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
