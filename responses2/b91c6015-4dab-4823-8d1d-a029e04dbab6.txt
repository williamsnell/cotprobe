Okay, so I have this question about gross income and some taxes. Hmm, let me think. Let's break it down.

Johnson earned $100,000 as a salary. He also got group term life insurance at twice his salary. So that's 2 times $100,000, which is $200,000. But wait, isn't that a lot? I mean, that's a high cost for term life insurance. So, that's the first part.

Now, the IRS says the annual uniform cost of insurance is $2.76 per $1,000. Oh, wait, so per $1,000, it's $2.76. So for $200,000, that would be $2.76 multiplied by 200 (since 200,000 divided by 1,000 is 200). Let me calculate that: 2.76 * 200. 2 * 200 is 400, 0.76 * 200 is 152. So total is 400 + 152 = $552.

So the cost of the insurance is $552. But wait, is the insurance considered a fringe benefit? Yes, because it's paid as part of his benefits. So, for his gross income, he has to include this cost as part of his salary. Because, for income tax purposes, fringe benefits are generally taxable as themselves. So, he's paying $552 in taxes on that.

So, his total income would be his salary plus the cost of insurance. His salary is $100,000, and the insurance is $552. So 100k plus 552 is $100,552. Wait, but wait, looking at the options, I see option I is $100,552. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, wait. Some sources say that for group term life insurance, the cost is calculated based on the amount of the plan. But in this case, it's twice the salary, so that's $200k. So the cost is $552. So yes, that's correct. So, the total income would be $100,552. So the answer would be option I.

But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A to J, with I being $100,552. So that's one option. But wait, wait. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, another thought: sometimes group term life insurance might be treated as a deduction from the salary, but in terms of tax, the cost is considered income. So yes, the $552 is taxable, so added to his income.

So the correct answer should be $100,552, which is option I.

Johnson's gross income includes his salary plus the cost of the group term life insurance. His salary is $100,000, and the cost of the insurance is calculated as $2.76 per $1,000, resulting in $552. Therefore, his total gross income is $100,000 + $552 = $100,552.

Answer: I: $100,552
