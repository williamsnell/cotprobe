Okay, so I've got this problem about a cannonball's height over time. The height is given by the equation h(t) = -4.9t² +14t -0.4. I need to find out for how long the cannonball is above 6 meters. The answer needs to be an improper fraction. Hmm, alright, let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when the cannonball is above 6 meters, its height is greater than 6. So I should set up the inequality h(t) > 6 and solve for t. That means:

-4.9t² +14t -0.4 > 6

I'll subtract 6 from both sides to set it to zero:

-4.9t² +14t -0.4 -6 > 0
Which simplifies to:
-4.9t² +14t -6.4 > 0

Hmm, working with decimal coefficients might be a bit tricky, but maybe I can convert that to fractions. Let me see, 4.9 is 49/10, and 6.4 is 64/10. So substituting:

-49/10 t² +14t -64/10 > 0

Hmm, to make it easier, I can multiply both sides by -10 to eliminate the fractions and reverse the inequality sign. Wait, but when I multiply an inequality by a negative number, the direction flips. Let me do that carefully.

Multiplying each term by -10 (and flipping the inequality):

(-49/10)t² * (-10) = 49t²
14t * (-10) = -140t
(-64/10) * (-10) = 64

So the inequality becomes:
49t² -140t +64 < 0

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the original inequality after moving everything to one side was:

-4.9t² +14t -6.4 > 0

I multiplied both sides by -10, so the inequality flips:

49t² -140t +64 < 0

Wait, but actually, let me double-check. Let me think again. The initial inequality after moving 6 is:

-4.9t² +14t -6.4 > 0

I'll convert 4.9 to 49/10 and 6.4 to 64/10, so:

-49/10 t² +14t -64/10 > 0

Multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate denominators:

-49t² +140t -64 > 0

Wait, but that's probably better. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to work with the equation h(t) = 6 and find the times when it crosses 6 meters, then find the interval between those two times.

So, let me set h(t) equal to 6:

-4.9t² +14t -0.4 = 6

Subtract 6 from both sides:

-4.9t² +14t -6.4 = 0

Again, let me convert these decimals to fractions. 4.9 is 49/10, 6.4 is 64/10. So:

-49/10 t² +14t -64/10 = 0

Multiply through by 10 to eliminate denominators:

-49t² +140t -64 = 0

This is a quadratic equation: -49t² +140t -64 = 0

Alternatively, I can write it as 49t² -140t +64 = 0 by multiplying both sides by -1 (since the quadratic is the same equation with a negative leading coefficient). Wait, but actually, let me just proceed with the equation as is.

The quadratic equation is:

49t² -140t +64 = 0

Wait, no, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. Wait, my original equation after multiplying by 10 is:

-49t² +140t -64 = 0

To make it easier, I can multiply both sides by -1:

49t² -140t +64 = 0

So now, I have 49t² -140t +64 = 0.

This is a quadratic in t, so I can use the quadratic formula to solve for t. The quadratic formula is t = [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ] / (2a) 

Here, a=49, b=-140, c=64.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the equation I have is 49t² -140t +64 = 0.

So a is 49, b is -140, and c is 64.

So, discriminant D = b² -4ac = (-140)^2 -4*(49)(64)

Calculate that:

140 squared is 19600.

4*49 is 196, multiplied by 64: 196 *64. Let me compute that.

196 *60 = 11760, 196 *4 = 784. So total is 11760 +784 = 12544.

So D = 19600 -12544 = 7056.

Hmm, 7056 is a perfect square? Let's see. 84 squared is 7056 because 80^2=6400, 85^2=7225, so 84^2= (80+4)^2 = 6400 + 640 +16= 7056. Yes.

So sqrt(D) =84.

So t = [140 ±84 ] / (2*49) because b is -140, so in the quadratic formula, it's -b, so -(-140)=140.

So:

t = (140 ±84)/(98)

So two solutions:

t1 = (140 +84)/98 = 224/98

t2 = (140 -84)/98 = 56/98

Simplify t1 and t2:

t1 = 224/98 → divide numerator and denominator by 14: 224 ÷14=16, 98 ÷14=7 → 16/7

t2 =56/98 → divide by 14: 56/14=4, 98/14=7 →4/7

So the times when the cannonball is at 6 meters are at t=4/7 and t=16/7.

So the cannonball is at 6 meters at t=4/7 seconds and t=16/7 seconds.

Since it's a parabola opening downward (since the coefficient of t² is negative in the original equation, which when set to 6, gives a quadratic opening downward), the time between t=4/7 and t=16/7 is when the height is above 6 meters.

So the duration is (16/7 -4/7) =12/7 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that: 16/7 minus 4/7 is 12/7. So the cannonball is above 6 meters for 12/7 seconds.

Looking at the options, option D is 12/7.

Wait, but let me double-check the signs in the quadratic equation. Because in the equation after moving 6, the quadratic was -4.9t² +14t -6.4 =0. When I multiplied by 10, I got -49t² +140t -64 =0. Alternatively, I can work with the original equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when multiplying. Let me check the calculations again.

The equation is:

-4.9 t² +14t -0.4 =6

So -4.9 t² +14t -6.4 = 0.

Multiplying by -10:

49 t² -140 t +64 =0.

So correct. Then the quadratic formula: t=(140 ±84)/(2*49)= (140±84)/98.

So 140+84=224, 224/98=16/7.

140-84=56, 56/98=4/7.

So times are 4/7 and 16/7.

Time between them is 12/7. So yes, the answer is 12/7, which is option D.

The cannonball's height is above 6 meters between t=4/7 and t=16/7 seconds. The duration is 12/7 seconds.
