Question:

A six-sided die (whose faces are numbered 1 through 6, as usual) is known to be counterfeit: The probability of rolling any even number is twice the probability of rolling any odd number. What is the probability that if this die is thrown twice, the first roll will be a 5 and the second roll will be a 6?

A: 1/27
B: 2/81
C: 1/9
D: 1/18
E: 2/9
F: 3/81
G: 2/27
H: 1/81
I: 3/27
J: 2/18

Okay, so I've got this probability question about a counterfeit die. I'm a bit new to this, but let me think it through step by step. 

The die is six-sided, normally numbered 1-6. But it's counterfeitâ€”so the probabilities of rolling even and odd numbers are different. The question says that the probability of rolling any even number is twice that of rolling any odd number. Hmm, I need to figure out what the actual probabilities are for each number.

Wait, let's break it down. The die has 6 faces: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The even numbers are 2,4,6 and the odd are 1,3,5. So three evens and three odds. The probability of even is twice that of odd. Let me let P be the probability of rolling an odd number. Then, P(even) = 2P.

Since each roll is independent, the total probability should add up to 1. So, the sum of all probabilities is P_odd + P_even + ... but wait, no, each face has its own probability, but the evens are three times as likely as the odds.

Wait, no, the die has 6 faces. So, let me think again. The probability of each odd number is the same, same for each even. Let me denote P_odd as the probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll. Similarly, P_even = 2P_odd because each even has twice the probability of an odd.

Now, the total probability for all faces must be 1. So, for all six faces, the sum of their probabilities is 1. Let's count how many odd and even numbers: 3 odds and 3 evens. So, the total is 3 * P_odd + 3 * P_even = 1.

But since P_even is 2P_odd, substitute that in: 3P_odd + 3*(2P_odd) = 1 => 3P_odd + 6P_odd = 9P_odd = 1 => P_odd = 1/9.

So, each odd number has a 1/9 chance, and each even has 2/9. Let me check: 3*(1/9) + 3*(2/9) = (3 +6)/9 = 9/9 =1. Yep, that adds up.

Now, the question asks about the probability that the first roll is 5 and the second is 6. So, two independent events. The probability for the first event is P(5) = 1/9. The second is P(6) = 2/9.

Since the rolls are independent, the combined probability is P(5) * P(6) = (1/9) * (2/9) = 2/81.

Looking at the options, option B is 2/81. So the answer should be B.
</think>

The probability of rolling an odd number is 1/9 for each odd number, and the even numbers have a probability of 2/9 each. For two independent rolls, the probability of 5 on the first roll and 6 on the second is (1/9) * (2/9) = 2/81. 

Answer: B: 2/81

**Answer:** B
