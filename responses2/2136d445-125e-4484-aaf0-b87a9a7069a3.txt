Okay, so I've got this problem about a bell circuit, and I'm trying to figure out the current. Let me break it down. 

The circuit includes a 150-foot No. 18 wire with a resistance of 1 ohm. Wait, No. 18 wire usually has a certain resistance. I think the resistance per foot is around 0.01 ohms, so 150 feet would be 1.5 ohms. Oh wait, but the problem says the wire's resistance is 1 ohm. Hmm, maybe they're considering the total resistance from the wire as 1 ohm. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the units. Let me double-check: the problem states the wire's resistance is 1 ohm. Then, the bell has a resistance of 5 ohms. The battery is two dry cells, each 1.5 volts, and their resistance is negligible.

So the total resistance of the circuit is the sum of the wire resistance, the bell's resistance, and the battery's resistance. But wait, the battery's resistance is negligible. So only the wire and the bell contribute to the total resistance. 

So R_total = R_wire + R_bell = 1 ohm + 5 ohms = 6 ohms.

The battery's emf is 3 volts (since two 1.5-volt cells in series). Oh wait, no. Wait, each cell is 1.5 volts, but if they are connected in series, the total emf would be 3 volts. But wait, in this case, the circuit is a battery and the wire and bell. So it's a simple series circuit. So the current is determined by the total voltage divided by the total resistance.

Wait, but the problem says the battery's resistance is negligible. So the total resistance is R_total = 1 + 5 = 6 ohms. The battery has negligible resistance, so it's acting as a voltage source providing 3 volts (since two 1.5-volts cells in series give 3 volts). 

So the current I is V/R = 3V / 6Î© = 0.5 A. So 0.5 amp. Looking at the options, option C is 0.2 amp, D is 0.3, C is 0.5. Oh wait, the options are A:0.9, B:0.6, C:0.2, D:0.3, E:1, F:0.4, G:0.5, H:2, I:1.5, J:0.75.

Wait, so 0.5 is option G. So the current is 0.5 A, which is option G.

To determine the current through the circuit, we first calculate the total resistance. The 150-foot No. 18 wire has a resistance of 1 ohm, and the bell has a resistance of 5 ohms. The battery's resistance is negligible. Thus, the total resistance is:

\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{wire}} + R_{\text{bell}} = 1 \, \Omega + 5 \, \Omega = 6 \, \Omega.
\]

The total voltage provided by the two dry cells is:

\[
V = 2 \times 1.5 \, \text{V} = 3 \, \text{V}.
\]

Using Ohm's Law, the current \( I \) is given by:

\[
I = \frac{V}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{3 \, \text{V}}{6 \, \Omega} = 0.5 \, \text{A}.
\]

From the options provided, \( 0.5 \, \text{A} \) corresponds to option G.
