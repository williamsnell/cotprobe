Okay, so I have this problem here where Jackson and Co. are buying electric blankets for $18.75 each, and they want a markup of 40% on the cost. I need to find their selling price. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, markup is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. So, if the cost is $18.75 and the markup is 40%, I need to calculate 40% of $18.75 and add that to the original cost.

Let me write that down. The formula for markup is usually: Selling Price = Cost + (Cost × Markup Percentage). So, in this case, the markup is 40%, which is equivalent to 0.40 in decimal form.

Let me calculate 40% of $18.75. So, 0.40 multiplied by 18.75. Let me compute that. 0.4 times 18 is 7.2, and 0.4 times 0.75 is 0.3. So, 7.2 + 0.3 equals 7.5. So, 40% of $18.75 is $7.50.

Now, adding that to the original cost: $18.75 + $7.50. Let's see, $18 plus $7 is $25, and $0.75 plus $0.50 is $1.25. Adding those together gives $26.25. So, the selling price should be $26.25.

Looking at the options provided, option G is $26.25. So, that's the answer. I think that's correct.
