Question:

Rainbow Corporation has outstanding 1,000 shares of voting common stock and 1,000 shares of nonvoting preferred. The preferred has a liquidation preference equal to its par value of $100 per share plus a 3 percent noncumulative dividend. Rainbow submits to its stockholders a proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that would come ahead of the old preferred stock. At a shareholders' meeting, 700 common and 400 preferred vote in favor of the proposal. Which of the following statements is correct?

Options:

A: The proposal is invalidly approved because a unanimous vote from both classes is required.
B: The proposal is validly approved because the nonvoting preferred stock does not count towards the vote.
C: The proposal is invalidly approved because a two-thirds vote of each class is required.
D: The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because it was nonvoting stock.
E: The proposal is validly approved because the common shareholders have the majority vote.
F: The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because the proposal affects the common stock.
G: The proposal is validly approved because the preferred stockholders who voted in favor have a liquidation preference.
H: The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the outstanding shares did not approve.
I: The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.
J: The proposal is validly approved because overall a majority of the outstanding shares did approve.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stock transactions and voting rights. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a company, Rainbow Corporation, which has 1,000 shares of voting common stock and 1,000 shares of nonvoting preferred stock. The nonvoting preferred has a liquidation preference equal to its par value plus a 3% noncumulative dividend. So, each preferred share has a liquidation value of $100 plus 3% of $100, which is $3. So total liquidation value per preferred share is $103.

Now, there's a proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights, and this new one is to be submitted ahead of the old. At the shareholders' meeting, 700 common and 400 preferred votes are in favor of the proposal.

So the question is about whether the proposal is approved or not based on the votes.

The options are A to J. Let me think about each option.

First, let's understand the voting structure. Common stock is voting, so the common shareholders have voting rights. Preferred stock is nonvoting, so they don't have voting rights. But here, the proposal is about a new class of preferred stock, which is nonvoting but has better terms.

Wait, no. Let's read again. The new preferred stock is for "redemption rights" ahead of the old. So the old preferred is for liquidation, and the new one is nonvoting but for redemption. Hmm, I'm not sure if that affects voting rights. The common stock is voting, the old preferred is nonvoting, and the new preferred is nonvoting but has a different liquidation value.

At the meeting, 700 common and 400 preferred votes are in favor. So both common and preferred votes are being voted on, but the nonvoting preferred is the old one.

The question is about whether the proposal is validly approved. The options are about whether the proposal is approved because of the votes, or if it's invalidly approved for other reasons.

First, let's analyze the voting rules. In many corporate structures, voting rights are based on the type of stock. Common stock is voting, nonvoting preferred is nonvoting, and redemptive preferred is nonvoting but can be called back or redeemed.

Wait, but in some cases, the voting is weighted. Wait no, the problem states that the old preferred is nonvoting with liquidation rights, and the new preferred is also nonvoting, but it's a new class. However, the key here is whether the votes count towards approval.

The question is about whether the proposal is validly approved, considering the votes cast.

Option B: The proposal is validly approved because nonvoting preferred stock does not count towards the vote. Hmm, because the new proposal is a new class of preferred. The old preferred is nonvoting, but approval of the new class would not count as voting for the old ones.

Wait, but the vote is for the proposal, which is a new class. So does the vote count for the new class? Or only for the old?

Wait, the common shareholders have voting rights, so their vote is for the proposal as a whole. The old preferred stock is nonvoting, so their vote doesn't count for the proposal's approval. Similarly, the new proposal is a new class, which is nonvoting but perhaps is counted as a vote for the new class, not the old.

Therefore, the vote for the proposal is only considering the new class. Wait, but the common shareholders are voting for the proposal as a whole. So the common votes are for the proposal, but the preferred votes are for the proposal only if they support it. But wait, the proposal is about a new class of preferred, which is a new type. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me think again. The old preferred was nonvoting, so its votes don't count towards the proposal's approval. The new proposal is a new nonvoting preferred. So the proposal's approval would only have to consider the new class's votes.

Wait, but the old preferred's votes were nonvoting, so their votes don't count. The new class's votes would count towards approval as a new voting group. So the proposal's vote would only be based on the new class.

Wait, the old preferred's votes are nonvoting, so they don't count. The new class is a new voting class, which may require a majority of the new class's shares. But the question is about the proposal's approval.

Wait, the problem is that the new class is a nonvoting but new type, so the votes for it are nonvoting, so their votes don't count towards the common shareholders' votes. So the common shareholders (voting) are voting for the proposal, but the new class (nonvoting) would need their own votes to decide.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about what the options are.

Option B says the proposal is validly approved because the nonvoting preferred stock does not count. But wait, the proposal is about a new preferred stock, which is a new class. The old preferred is nonvoting but their votes don't matter. So the new class is a new voting class, but their votes don't count towards the common voting. Therefore, only the new class's votes are relevant. But the option says the nonvoting preferred doesn't count, which it's not. Because the new proposal is a new nonvoting class, but the old preferred's nonvoting votes don't count.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scenario. The original proposal is about a new class, but the common shareholders' votes are for the proposal, and the old preferred's votes don't matter. So the proposal's approval is based on the new class. But then, the question is whether the proposal is approved based on the votes.

Wait, the wording says "the proposal to authorize a new class... ahead of the old preferred." So the new proposal is a new class. The old preferred's nonvoting votes don't count towards the proposal's approval. The common shareholders are voting for the proposal as a whole, and the old preferred's votes don't matter.

Wait, so the proposal is only about the new class. So the votes for the proposal are only from the new class. But the problem is, the new class is nonvoting, so their votes don't count as voting for the common stock's votes. Therefore, the common shareholders' votes (700 in this case) are all for the proposal, and the new class's votes are nonvoting. So the proposal's vote is based on the new class's votes, but since the new class's votes don't count for common votes, the common's 700 votes are for the proposal.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to look at whether the votes are for nonvoting or voting.

Wait, the nonvoting preferred is a type of stock. If a nonvoting preferred is being proposed, its votes count as nonvoting, so their votes don't affect the common's votes. The common's votes are voting for the proposal, but their votes are in addition to the nonvoting preferred's, but the nonvoting preferred doesn't count.

Wait, maybe the proposal's votes count as nonvoting. So the common's votes (700) plus the new class's votes. But the new class's votes don't count towards common's votes. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the nonvoting preferred's votes don't affect the common's votes. So the proposal's vote is determined solely by the new class's votes. But the new class is nonvoting, so their votes don't count for anything. So the proposal's vote is based on the new class's votes, but since the new class is nonvoting, they don't count for the common's votes.

Wait, that can't be. So perhaps the proposal requires a majority of the new class's shares. But the new class is nonvoting, so their votes don't count for the common's votes. Therefore, the common's votes (700) are all for the proposal, and the new class's votes (which are nonvoting) don't affect the common's votes. So the proposal is approved because the common's votes are majority (700 out of 1,000, which is 70%, majority). So the proposal is validly approved because the common's votes are in favor.

Looking back at the options:

Option J says the proposal is validly approved because overall a majority of the outstanding shares did approve. Since 700 out of 1,000 is 70%, which is a majority. So yes, the proposal is approved because the common's votes are majority.

Alternatively, option B says the nonvoting preferred doesn't count. But the proposal's vote is not based on the nonvoting preferred's votes. The new class's votes don't count for the common's votes. So their votes don't count in the common's votes. So the common's votes (700) are for the proposal, making it a majority.

So the correct statement is that the proposal is validly approved because the common shareholders have the majority vote. Hence, option J.

Wait, but another angle: the proposal is about a new preferred stock. Does the new class's votes count as voting for the proposal? If so, the common's vote is 700 and the new class's are 400. But the new class is nonvoting, so their votes don't count for the common's. So the common's 700 votes are for the proposal, making it a majority. So the proposal is approved.

So the correct answer is J: The proposal is validly approved because overall a majority of the outstanding shares did approve.

Wait, but the problem states that the new proposal is for a new class ahead of the old. So the old preferred is nonvoting, so their votes don't matter. The new class's votes don't count for the common's. So the proposal is based on the new class's votes, which are nonvoting, but the proposal is an approval. So the common's votes (700) are in favor, making it a majority. So the proposal is approved.

Therefore, the correct option is either B or J. Wait, let me clarify.

Option B says the nonvoting preferred doesn't count. But the proposal's vote is for the new class, which doesn't count for the common's votes. So the common's 700 is all for the proposal. So the proposal is approved because the common's votes are in majority.

So the correct statement is option B? No. Because option B says the nonvoting preferred doesn't count, but the proposal is about the new class, which the common voters support. So the common voters' 700 votes are in favor. So the proposal is approved because the common's votes are majority.

So option J is correct: the proposal is validly approved because overall a majority of the outstanding shares did approve.

So the correct answer is J.

The question revolves around the voting rights of Rainbow Corporation's shareholders and whether the proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock is approved. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Points**:
   - **Common Shareholders**: Voting rights exist for common stock, which is relevant to the proposal.
   - **Preferred Stock**: Nonvoting preferred stock (old) is nonvoting and does not count towards voting for the proposal. The new class of preferred stock is nonvoting but is a new voting group.
   - **Votes**: 700 common votes and 400 votes in favor of the proposal were cast. The new class of preferred stock does not count towards the common votes.

2. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. A majority vote is required for a successful proposal, not just both classes.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The nonvoting preferred stock (old) does not count for the proposal's approval; the vote is based on the new class of preferred stock.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. A two-thirds vote is not required for a majority.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The proposal is not invalidly approved because it was a nonvoting stock.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The proposal is not invalidly approved because the common shareholders have the majority votes.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The vote is validly approved because the common shareholders have a majority.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The preferred stockholders who voted in favor do have a liquidation preference, but this does not make the proposal invalidly approved.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The proposal is not invalidly approved because a majority of the common shareholders approved it.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The proposal is validly approved because the common shareholders have a majority vote.
   - **Option J**: Correct. The proposal is validly approved because the common shareholders' majority vote ensures approval.

3. **Conclusion**: The proposal is validly approved because the common shareholders, who constitute a majority (700 out of 1,000), voted in favor of the proposal. The new class of preferred stock, being nonvoting, does not count towards the common votes.
