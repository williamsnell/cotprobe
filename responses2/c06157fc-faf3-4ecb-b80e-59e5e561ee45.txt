Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The question is about finding the approximate boiling point of a solution made by dissolving NaCl in water. The solution is 234 grams of NaCl dissolved in 500 grams of H2O. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that boiling points of solutions depend on their molality because water is the solvent. I think the formula for boiling point elevation is ΔT = i * Kf * m, but wait, wait. No, wait: no, I think it's ΔTb = i * K_b * m, where K_b is a constant for the solvent, which in this case is water. 

Wait, but wait, what's the exact formula? Oh right, the formula is the boiling point elevation ΔT equals i multiplied by the molal concentration (m) multiplied by the boiling point elevation constant (K_b) for the solvent. So, the formula is ΔT = i * m * K_b.

Wait, but wait again. I think K_b for water is 0.512 °C·kg/mol. And the van 't Hoff factor (i) is the number of particles the solute dissociates into. For NaCl, since it's a strong electrolyte, it should dissociate completely into Na+ and Cl- ions. So each molecule of NaCl dissolves into two ions, so i is 2.

So the plan is to calculate the molality of the solution and then plug it into the formula. Let's break it down.

First, find the moles of NaCl. The molar mass of NaCl is about 22.99 (Na) + 35.45 (Cl) = 58.44 g/mol. So, moles of NaCl = mass / molar mass = 234 g / 58.44 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 234 divided by 58.44. Hmm, 58.44 * 4 is 233.76, which is close to 234. So that's about 4 moles. Wait, 234 / 58.44 is approximately 4.008. So 4.008 moles of NaCl.

Next, find the molality. Molality (m) is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. The solvent is H2O, which is 500 grams, so 0.5 kg.

So m = 4.008 moles / 0.5 kg = 8.016 mol/kg. Wait, wait, 4.008 / 0.5 is 8.016. So the molality is 8.016 mol/kg.

Now, using the formula: ΔT = i * m * K_b. i is 2, m is 8.016, K_b is 0.512.

So ΔT = 2 * 8.016 * 0.512. Let me compute that step by step.

First, 8.016 * 0.512: 8 * 0.512 is 4.096, and 0.016*0.512 is 0.008192. So total is 4.096 + 0.008192 = 4.104192. Then multiply by 2: 4.104192 * 2 = 8.208384 °C. So the boiling point elevation is approximately 8.21°C.

But wait, the original boiling point of pure water is 100°C. So the new boiling point would be 100 + 8.21 = about 108.21°C.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option H is 108.32°C. Oh, that's very close. Another option is option J, which is 110°C. Another is option G, 115°C. So H is 108.32, which should match our calculation.

Wait, but wait. Did I make any mistakes in the calculation? Let me double-check.

Molar mass of NaCl: 22.99 + 35.45=58.44 g/mol. 234 /58.44= let me compute more accurately. 58.44 *4 = 233.76. 234-233.76 is 0.24 g. So 0.24 /58.44 = approx 0.0041 (since 58.44 * 0.0041=0.2386, which is close to 0.24). So moles are about 4.0041. So m=4.0041 / 0.5 kg = 8.0082 mol/kg. That's about 8.008 mol/kg.

Now, ΔT = 2 * 8.008 * 0.512.

Compute 8.008 * 0.512: 8 * 0.512 is 4.096, 0.008 *0.512 is 0.004096. Sum is 4.096 + 0.004096=4.100096. Multiply by 2: 8.200192°C. So boiling point is 108.20°C. So the correct answer should be around 108.2°C.

Looking at the options, option H is 108.32, which is very close. So the answer is H.

To determine the approximate boiling point of a solution prepared by dissolving 234 g of NaCl in 500 g of H₂O, we use the boiling point elevation formula:

\[
\Delta T = i \cdot m \cdot K_b
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the moles of NaCl
The molar mass of NaCl is approximately 58.44 g/mol. The number of moles of NaCl is:

\[
\text{Moles of NaCl} = \frac{\text{Mass of NaCl}}{\text{Molar mass of NaCl}} = \frac{234 \, \text{g}}{58.44 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 4.008 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the molality of the solution
Molality (\(m\)) is defined as moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. The solvent mass is 500 g, which is 0.5 kg. Thus:

\[
m = \frac{\text{Moles of NaCl}}{\text{Mass of H₂O (kg)}} = \frac{4.008 \, \text{mol}}{0.5 \, \text{kg}} \approx 8.016 \, \text{mol/kg}
\]

### Step 3: Use the boiling point elevation formula
The van 't Hoff factor (\(i\)) for NaCl is 2, as it dissociates into two ions (\(\text{Na}^+\) and \(\text{Cl}^-\)). The boiling point elevation constant (\(K_b\)) for water is 0.512 °C·kg/mol. Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta T = i \cdot m \cdot K_b = 2 \cdot 8.016 \cdot 0.512 \approx 8.208 \, \text{°C}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the new boiling point
The boiling point of pure water is 100°C. Adding the boiling point elevation:

\[
\text{New boiling point} = 100 \, \text{°C} + 8.208 \, \text{°C} \approx 108.21 \, \text{°C}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to 108.21°C is **108.32°C**, which corresponds to option H.
