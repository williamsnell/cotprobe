Okay, so I have this question about a DC motor and its efficiency. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.

The question says the motor requires 10 kilowatts to supply its full capacity of 10 horsepower to its pulley. Wait, I remember that power can be converted between horsepower and kilowatts. Oh right, 1 horsepower is about 746 watts. So 10 horsepower would be 10 * 746 = 7460 watts, which is 7.46 kilowatts. But the motor is using 10 kilowatts. Wait, that seems high. Wait, no, wait—the question says that the motor requires 10 kilowatts to supply its full capacity of 10 horsepower to the pulley. So, the 10 kilowatts is the input power, and the output is the power it's actually supplying, which is 10 horsepower.

So, the efficiency of the motor is the output power divided by the input power. Oh right, efficiency is (output power)/(input power) * 100%. 

So output power is 10 horsepower, which is 7460 watts, and input power is 10 kilowatts, which is 10,000 watts. So efficiency = (7460 / 10000) * 100% = 74.6%.

Wait, but wait—wait, are we considering whether the motor is 100% efficient or not? Or is it the other way around? Oh no, the question says it requires 10 kilowatts to supply its full capacity to the pulley. So, the input is 10kW, and the output is 10 hp (7460W). So efficiency is output over input, which is 7460/10000 *100 = 74.6%.

Looking at the options, option A is 74.6%. So the answer should be A.

The efficiency of the motor is calculated as the output power divided by the input power. The output power is 10 horsepower, which equals 7460 watts, and the input power is 10 kilowatts (10,000 watts). Efficiency = (7460 / 10000) * 100% = 74.6%. 

Answer: A
