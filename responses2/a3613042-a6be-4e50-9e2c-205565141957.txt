Okay, so I have this question about sickle-cell disease. Let me think through it. I've heard a bit about sickle-cell anemia before, so I'll try to remember. Sickle-cell disease is an inherited blood disorder, right? And it's caused by a genetic condition that's pretty serious. I think it's inherited in a particular way.

The question says a healthy man and woman are worried about having children because they're both carriers. Carriers are people who have one normal allele and one defective allele for a particular gene. So, each parent has a 50% chance of passing on the normal allele or the defective one to their offspring. 

Wait, let me make sure I remember the basics. Sickle-cell disease is an X-linked recessive disorder. That means the gene is located on the X chromosome, and the disease is only expressed when two copies (two Xs) are present, one from the mother and one from the father. So, the man and woman are carriers, which means each has one normal X and one X with the sickle-shaped band. 

So, if they have a child, what's the chance the child gets sickles? I think each child has a 50% chance of getting one X from each parent. Let me break it down. 

The man is a carrier, so his X chromosomes are normal (let's say X^N) and one has the sickle allele (X^a). The woman is also a carrier, so her X chromosomes are X^N and X^a.

When they have a child, the man can pass either X^N or X^a. The woman can do the same. Each has a 50% chance. So, the possible combinations for the child are:

- X^N from man and X^N from woman: child has X^N and X^N (normal)
- X^N from man and X^a from woman: child has X^N and X^a (carrier)
- X^a from man and X^N from woman: child has X^a and X^N (carrier)
- X^a from both: child has X^a and X^a (sickle-shaped)

So, the child has four possible outcomes, each equally likely. Out of these, one outcome results in sickle-cell (X^a X^a), and three result in normal blood (X^N X^N, X^N X^a, X^a X^N). 

So, the probability of the child getting sickle-cell is 1 out of 4, which is 25%. Wait, but wait, I've heard that carriers have a 50% chance. Oh, right! Because each parent contributes one X. For each child, each parent contributes one allele. So, the possible combinations are 25% for each possible outcome. So, the chance of the child being a carrier is 2 out of 4, which is 50%. Because half of the possibilities are carriers (either X^a from the man and N from the woman, or vice versa) and one possibility is a sickle (both X^a). 

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure I count correctly. The possible outcomes are four: NN, NA, AN, AA. But in this context, the alleles are X^N and X^a. So, the possible gametes for the man are X^N and X^a, each 50%. For the woman, same.

So, the possible combinations when making a Punnett square:

Man's gametes: X^N and X^a (each 50%)
Woman's gametes: X^N and X^a (each 50%)

So, when combining, the possibilities are:

X^N (man) and X^N (woman): X^N X^N (normal)
X^N and X^a: X^N X^a (carrier)
X^a and X^N: X^a X^N (carrier)
X^a and X^a: X^a X^a (sickle)

Each of these is 25% probability. So, the child has a 1/4 chance of being normal (only one out of four possibilities), and 3/4 chance of being a carrier (three possibilities: NA, AN, AA). 

So, the chance the child gets sickle is 3/4 or 75%, which is 75%. Wait wait, no. Because 1/4 is 25% for each. So, the chance of being a carrier is 3 in 4, which is 75%. Oh, right! Because each gamete combination is 25% of the time. So, when you get a child, the probability that the child has the disease (i.e., is a carrier) is 3/4, which is 75%. Because the only way to be sick is to get two X^a alleles. So, 1/4 chance for that. 

So, the answer is 75% chance. Looking at the options, option B is 75%.

The question involves calculating the probability that a child of two carriers (each with one normal and one sickle-shaped X chromosome) will inherit sickle-cell disease. Sickle-cell disease is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning the defective allele (X^a) must be inherited from both parents to cause the disease.

Each parent has a 50% chance of passing on either the normal allele (X^N) or the defective allele (X^a). The possible combinations for the child are:

1. **X^N (man) + X^N (woman):** Normal blood, X^N X^N.
2. **X^N (man) + X^a (woman):** Carrier, X^N X^a.
3. **X^a (man) + X^N (woman):** Carrier, X^a X^N.
4. **X^a (man) + X^a (woman):** Sickle-cell disease, X^a X^a.

There are four equally likely outcomes, with one outcome resulting in sickle-cell disease. Therefore, the probability of the child inheriting sickle-cell disease is 1/4 (25%), and the probability of being a carrier is 3/4 (75%).

The correct answer is **75%**.
