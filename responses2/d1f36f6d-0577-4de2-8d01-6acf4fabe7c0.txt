Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about price ceilings and their effects. I need to figure out which statements are accurate. Let me think through each option carefully.

First, I'll recap what a price ceiling is. It's a maximum price set by the government for a good. So, it's a regulatory measure to prevent prices from rising too high, but it's not necessarily binding.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A price ceiling won't affect the quantity supplied. Hmm. I remember that price ceilings can affect supply, but only if they're binding. If the ceiling is below equilibrium, the quantity supplied might not change because they can't set the price above equilibrium. But if the ceiling is binding (price below equilibrium), it might set a lower price, but the quantity supplied might not necessarily stop changing. Wait, no, actually, even if equilibrium is unchanged, the quantity supplied could change if supply is elastic or inelastic. But wait, the question is about whether the price ceiling affects quantity supplied. I think it does because the quantity supplied would depend on the supply curve. So A might not be correct because it could affect the quantity, depending on the context. Wait, but the question says "no effect on the quantity supplied." I think that's not true because the quantity supplied can change even with a price ceiling. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Price ceiling causes a shift in supply. No, a shift in supply occurs when factors other than price affect supply, like technology, input costs, etc. A price ceiling doesn't shift the supply curve; it just sets a maximum price. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Price ceiling always causes a surplus. Well, surplus happens when quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded. But if the price ceiling is too low, it could cause a surplus, but if it's too high, it might cause a scarcity. Wait, but a price ceiling can sometimes lead to a surplus or a shortage, depending on the situation. So C doesn't always result in a surplus; sometimes it might not. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Price ceiling increases buyer's total revenue. Total revenue is price times quantity. If the ceiling is effective, price goes down, and quantity might go down or up depending on the responsiveness of supply and demand. For example, if supply is inelastic, quantity might stay high. So buyer revenue (price * quantity) could either increase or decrease. So D isn't always correct.

Option E: Effective price ceiling must be above equilibrium. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. An effective price ceiling occurs when the ceiling is below the equilibrium price. Because then, the price can't set above equilibrium, so the ceiling is effective. So E is incorrect because an effective ceiling doesn't have to be above equilibrium; in fact, it's the opposite. The equilibrium is the point where supply and demand meet. If the price is set below equilibrium, it's effective. So E is wrong.

Option F: Price ceiling causes a shift in demand. No, a price ceiling affects supply only. Demand is a shift when factors change, like price or income. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Price ceiling leads to decrease in good's quality. Price ceilings don't directly affect quality. Quality is more about production and maintenance, not the price. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Price ceiling increases quantity supplied. Wait, price ceilings can sometimes lead to lower quantity supplied. For example, if the price ceiling is too low, the quantity supplied might decrease because producers are constrained by the price. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Price ceiling decreases seller's revenue. If the price is lower, and the quantity sold is the same, then seller's total revenue would decrease. But if the quantity decreases, it depends. Let me think: if the price is set below equilibrium, quantity supplied could decrease. So seller's revenue might go down because price is lower. So I's statement holds. So I is correct.

Option J: Price ceiling is below equilibrium. Wait, no. An effective price ceiling is when it's below equilibrium. Because if the ceiling is above equilibrium, it's not effective (since the price would go up to equilibrium). So J is incorrect because an effective price ceiling is below equilibrium.

So now, let's check which options are correct.

Which options are accurate? Let me go through again.

A: Incorrect, because price ceiling can affect quantity supplied.

B: Incorrect, because price ceiling doesn't shift supply.

C: Incorrect, because price ceiling can cause surplus or not.

D: Incorrect, buyer revenue might decrease.

E: Incorrect, because effective ceilings are below equilibrium.

H: Incorrect, price ceilings don't increase supply.

I: Correct.

J: Incorrect, because it's below equilibrium.

So the correct answer is I.
</think>

The correct answer is I: A price ceiling will decrease the total revenue of sellers.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A**: Incorrect. A price ceiling can affect the quantity supplied if it is binding (i.e., below equilibrium), but it does not always have no effect.
- **B**: Incorrect. A price ceiling does not cause a shift in the supply curve; it only sets a maximum price.
- **C**: Incorrect. A price ceiling can lead to a surplus or scarcity depending on its level, not always causing a surplus.
- **D**: Incorrect. A price ceiling does not necessarily increase buyer total revenue; it depends on the responsiveness of supply and demand.
- **E**: Incorrect. An effective price ceiling occurs when it is below equilibrium, not above.
- **F**: Incorrect. A price ceiling does not cause a shift in the demand curve.
- **G**: Incorrect. A price ceiling does not directly affect the quality of the good.
- **H**: Incorrect. A price ceiling does not increase quantity supplied; it depends on the supply curve.
- **I**: Correct. A price ceiling below equilibrium causes sellers to sell less, reducing total revenue.
- **J**: Incorrect. An effective price ceiling is below equilibrium.
