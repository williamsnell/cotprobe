Question:

Expectancy theory predicts that worker motivation depends on several factors including “valence,” which refers to:

Options:

A: the worker's beliefs about the potential negative outcomes of unsuccessful performance.
B: the employee’s beliefs about the inherent (intrinsic) value of the work itself.
C: the worker's expectations about the probability of success.
D: the employee’s beliefs about the value of rewards provided for successful performance.
E: the worker's perceived ability to perform the task successfully.
F: the duration of the worker's tenure at the organization.
G: the strength of the worker's motivation and organizational commitment.
H: the worker's beliefs about the fairness of the reward system.
I: the strength of the effort (versus ability) component of the worker’s motivation.
J: the worker's level of satisfaction with the organizational culture.

Okay, so I have this question about expectancy theory and worker motivation. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about what "valence" refers to in expectancy theory. The options are A to J. I remember that expectancy theory is about motivation and how employees perceive their own performance.

So, expecting some concepts. I think in expectancy theory, motivation is expected outcomes. The model, developed by Farnham and Taylor, says that motivation is the result of an expectation of a behavior (effort) and the expectation of positive outcomes from that behavior.

Valence is one of those expected outcomes. It refers to what the employee expects from the job. The options are A through J. Let me go through them.

Option A: worker's beliefs about negative outcomes of unsuccessful performance. That sounds like a negative outcome, but I thought valence meant positive. So maybe not A.

Option B: employee's beliefs about the inherent value of the work. Intrinsic motivation, like what makes the work interesting or fulfilling. That's another expected outcome, but not valence. So B is intrinsic, not valence.

Option C: worker's expectations about the probability of success. That sounds like probability of success, which is more of a probability theory aspect, not the outcome the employee expects.

Option D: employee's beliefs about the value of rewards for successful performance. That sounds like the expected outcome related to rewards. Oh, wait, the expected outcome is the result of their performance. So D is about what they think rewards are worth, which is a positive expectation.

Option E: perceived ability. That's about job performance, like how well they can do it, not the outcome related to their performance.

Option F: tenure. That's more about job stability, not the outcome of their performance.

Option G: motivation and commitment. That's more about the internal factors, not the external expected outcome.

Option H: beliefs about fairness. That relates to how rewards are handled, which is another aspect but not directly the expected outcome.

Option J: level of satisfaction. That's about the overall job satisfaction, not the specific expected outcome.

So going back, valence is the expected outcome related to the employee's performance. So which option is that?

Option D says "the employee’s beliefs about the value of rewards provided for successful performance." That seems to fit. Because valence is what the employee expects from their work, like what they think the rewards are worth as a result of their performance.

Wait, let me think again. In the expectancy theory, the employee's intrinsic satisfaction or extrinsic rewards are based on their expectations. So valence is the desired outcome, the expected reward or the desired result.

So D is about what they believe the reward is worth, so that's the expected outcome.

Alternatively, another way to think: the model's equation is Expected Motivation = Expectancy × Vicarious Reaction. Expectancy is the expectation of a positive outcome, Vicarious Reaction is the actual outcome.

So Vicarious Reaction is the result of the expectation. So valence is the expectation's component. So D is correct.

Wait, but I thought that one of the options might be related to the intrinsic value versus extrinsic. Maybe I'm mixing up intrinsic and extrinsic.

Intrinsic motivation is about the inherent value of the work. So like, if the work is interesting or fulfilling, that's intrinsic. Extrinsic motivation is about the rewards, like recognition, pay, etc.

So in the options, B is about intrinsic, and D is about extrinsic.

So valence is the expected outcome, which is the extrinsic part. So D.

The question asks about the concept of "valence" in the context of expectancy theory. Valence refers to the expected outcome of an employee's performance, specifically the value they believe their work contributes. 

To analyze the options:

- **A**: Refers to negative outcomes, which is not the expected outcome but a negative result.
- **B**: Pertains to intrinsic motivation, not the expected outcome.
- **C**: Relates to probability of success, which is a probability theory aspect, not the outcome related to performance.
- **D**: Correctly identifies valence as the employee's beliefs about the value of rewards provided for successful performance, the expected outcome.
- **E**: Refers to perceived ability, which is about job performance, not the expected outcome.
- **F**: Relates to tenure, which is about job stability, not the expected outcome.
- **G**: Pertains to motivation and commitment, internal factors, not the external expected outcome.
- **H**: Refers to fairness beliefs, related to reward handling, not the expected outcome.
- **J**: Refers to job satisfaction, not the specific expected outcome.

Thus, the correct answer is **D**, as it accurately describes valence as the employee's expected outcome related to rewards for successful performance.

**Answer: D**
