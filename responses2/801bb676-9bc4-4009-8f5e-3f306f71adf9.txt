Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. The question is asking which of the given molecules is a strong electrolyte when dissolved in water. Let me think.

I remember that electrolytes are substances that when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions. Strong electrolytes are the ones that completely ionize in solution, meaning they break down into the maximum possible ions. Weak electrolytes only partially ionize.

The options are A to I, each a different molecule. Let me go through each one.

Option A: CH3COOH, which is acetic acid. I think acetic acid is a weak acid, so when dissolved, it doesn't fully ionize. So it's a weak electrolyte, not strong.

Option B: CO2. Carbon dioxide is a gas, but when dissolved in water, it forms H2CO3 (carbonic acid). But since it's a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely. So it's a weak electrolyte too.

Option C: O2. Oxygen gas is a diatomic molecule. When dissolved in water, it would decompose into O^2− and H2O. Wait, but I'm not sure. Wait, when O2 is dissolved in water, it dissociates into O^2− and H2O. But O2 is already a gas. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, O2 is a strong acid? No, O2 is more of an oxidizing agent. Wait, no. Wait, O2 is a diatomic molecule. When dissolved in water, it doesn't fully break down. I think O2 doesn't ionize much. Or wait, maybe O2 is acting as a weak acid? Hmm, maybe I should think again. Alternatively, perhaps O2 doesn't have ions when dissolved. So maybe it's not an electrolyte, or weak.

Option D: H2O. Water itself is a liquid. When dissolved in water, it doesn't change much. It's the solvent, so it's not the solute. But wait, when you add something else, like a salt, water becomes a solvent and the solute is the one that dissociates. So H2O is the solvent, not an electrolyte by itself. So D isn't the answer.

Option E: NH3. Ammonia is a gas. When dissolved in water, it forms NH4+ and OH− (in solution). Wait, no. Wait, when NH3 dissolves in water, it can act as a base and produce NH4^+ and OH^- ions. But wait, ammonia is a weak base, so it doesn't fully dissociate. So it's a weak electrolyte.

Option F: CH4. Methane is a gas. When dissolved in water, it's a weak electrolyte as well. Methane doesn't fully ionize, so it's weak.

Option G: HC2H3O2. That's formic acid. I remember formic acid is a weak acid. So when dissolved in water, it doesn't fully dissociate. So it's a weak electrolyte.

Option H: HBr. Hydrobromic acid. That's a strong acid. It's a weak electrolyte because it's completely ionized in water. So when dissolved, HBr → H+ + Br−. So it's a strong electrolyte.

Option I: C6H12O6. That's glucose. Glucose is a sugar, a non-electrolyte because it doesn't dissociate into ions when dissolved in water. So it's a non-electrolyte.

Wait, looking back at the options, the question is asking which is a strong electrolyte. So the only one that fits is option H, HBr. Because it's a strong acid and fully ionized. So the correct answer should be H.

To determine which molecule is a strong electrolyte when dissolved in water, we analyze each option:

- **A: CH3COOH (Acetic Acid)**: Acetic acid is a weak electrolyte because it does not fully ionize in water.
- **B: CO2 (Carbon Dioxide)**: Carbon dioxide forms H2CO3 when dissolved in water, but it does not fully ionize, making it a weak electrolyte.
- **C: O2 (Oxygen)**: When dissolved in water, O2 dissociates into O^2− and H2O, but this process is not complete, so it is a weak electrolyte.
- **D: H2O (Water)**: Water itself is the solvent and does not contain ions when dissolved in water. It is not an electrolyte.
- **E: NH3 (Ammonia)**: Ammonia is a weak base and does not fully ionize in water, making it a weak electrolyte.
- **F: CH4 (Methane)**: Methane is a gas that dissociates weakly in water, making it a weak electrolyte.
- **G: HC2H3O2 (Formic Acid)**: Formic acid is a weak acid and does not fully ionize in water, so it is a weak electrolyte.
- **H: HBr (Hydrobromic Acid)**: Hydrobromic acid is a strong acid and fully ionizes in water (HBr → H+ + Br−). Therefore, it is a strong electrolyte.
- **I: C6H12O6 (Glucose)**: Glucose is a non-electrolyte because it does not dissociate into ions when dissolved in water.

The only strong electrolyte among the options is **H: HBr**.
