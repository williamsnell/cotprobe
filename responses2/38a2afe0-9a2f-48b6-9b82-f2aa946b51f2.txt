Question:

You are in your laboratory late one night, working with eight separate containers holding the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Three of the containers hold beetles homozygous for ebony bodies. The remaining five containers hold beetles homozygous for red bodies. Suddenly, the lights in your lab go out. You decide to remove your beetles to another lab so you can continue your work. If you can carry only one container at a time, what is the probability that the first container you select in the darkness contains homozygous ebony beetles and the second container contains homozygous red?

Options:

A: 0.438
B: 0.178
C: 0.358
D: 0.125
E: 0.375
F: 0.268
G: 0.525
H: 0.488
I: 0.225
J: 0.625

Okay, so I've got this problem here about beetles and containers. Let me try to break it down. So, the setup is that there are eight containers, three holding homozygous ebony beetles and five holding homozygous red beetles. The lab lights go out, and I need to move beetles to another lab. But the catch is I can only carry one container at a time. The question is about probability, specifically the chance that the first container I pick is ebony and the second is red.

Hmm. So, I think this is a probability problem involving dependent events because once I pick one container, the next pick will depend on what I picked first. Let me think in steps.

First, the probability that the first container I select is from the ebony group. There are 3 containers with ebony, and 8 in total. So, the probability for the first pick is 3/8.

Now, after taking one container, I'm left with 7 containers. But wait, I have to consider if I took the only available container from one group. So, if I took one from ebony, now the remaining are 2 EB and 5 red, making 7 containers. So, for the second pick, the probability would be 5/7.

So, the combined probability is the product of these two probabilities. That would be (3/8) * (5/7). Let me calculate that.

3/8 is 0.375, and 5/7 is approximately 0.7142857. Multiplying them: 0.375 * 0.7142857. Let me compute that.

0.375 * 0.7142857 ≈ 0.2679. Hmm, looking at the options, option F is 0.268, which is very close. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it exactly.

3/8 is 3/8, 5/7 is 5/7. So, their product is (3*5)/(8*7) = 15/56. Let me calculate 15 divided by 56. 56 goes into 15 zero times. 56 into 150 is 2 times (112), remainder 38. 56 into 380 is 6 times (336), remainder 44. 56 into 440 is 7 times (392), remainder 48. 56 into 480 is 8 times (448), remainder 32. 56 into 320 is 5 times (280), remainder 40. 56 into 400 is 7 times (392), remainder 8. So, 15/56 ≈ 0.267857… which rounds to approximately 0.268. So the answer would be F, 0.268.

Wait, but wait! Let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. Another approach is to consider all possible pairs of containers. But since it's a sequential selection, the first is the first pick, then the second. So the probability is indeed (number of favorable first picks) multiplied by (number of favorable second picks given the first was favorable).

So, the first pick must be from the 3 EB containers, and the second from the 5 red ones. So the formula is (3/8) * (5/7) = 15/56 ≈ 0.2679, which is 0.268. So the correct option is F.

The probability of selecting a container with homozygous ebony beetles first is 3/8, and then selecting a container with homozygous red beetles second is 5/7. Multiplying these gives (3/8) * (5/7) = 15/56 ≈ 0.2679, which rounds to 0.268. 

Answer: F
