Okay, so I've got this question about E. coli growth. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question says that the E. coli culture will grow to a limiting concentration of about 10^9 cells per cm³. And at this concentration, what percentage of the total volume is occupied by the cells? The options are from A to J, some percentages like 0.25%, 0.57%, etc.

Hmm, I remember that E. coli are spherical cells, right? So maybe I should calculate their volume and then compare that to the total volume of the medium, which is the volume of all the cells plus any extracellular fluids or space. Oh wait, but the question says the concentration is 10^9 cells per cm³. That's the number of cells per unit volume of the medium. So each cm³ of medium contains 1e9 cells.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the total volume occupied by the cells. So maybe it's the volume of all the cells divided by the total volume of the medium, but that doesn't make much sense because the total volume is the sum of the cells and the extracellular space. Oh wait no, perhaps the question is considering just the cells' volume relative to the medium's volume, but that would be cells' volume per cm³. So let's think again.

Wait, the total volume of the culture medium is the volume occupied by all the cells plus the space around them. But when calculating the percentage of the medium occupied by the cells, I think it's the volume of the cells divided by the total volume of the medium. But wait, if the concentration is 1e9 cells per cm³, each cell's volume is a sphere. So first, what's the volume of a single E. coli cell?

The cell is cylindrical, given as 2.0 μm long and 1.0 μm diameter. Wait, wait, no, wait. The description says the cell is cylindrical, but the length and diameter are given as 2.0 micrometers and 1.0 micrometers. So the diameter is 1.0 μm, so the radius is 0.5 μm. The length (height) is 2.0 μm.

The volume of a cylinder is πr²h. Plugging in the values: r = 0.5e-6 meters? Wait, no, because micrometers are 1e-6 meters. Wait, to be precise, 1 μm is 1e-6 meters. So r is 0.5e-6 m, h is 2e-6 m.

Volume = π * (0.5e-6)^2 * (2e-6) 

Let me compute that:

(0.5e-6)^2 = 0.25e-12 m²
Multiply by 2e-6: 0.5e-12 * 2e-6 = 1e-18 m³
Multiply by π: approximately 3.1416e-18 m³.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the medium's volume occupied by the cells. So each cell contributes that volume. But wait, the concentration is 1e9 cells per cm³. Let me get the total volume of the medium as V_total = 1 cm³ (so 1e-6 m³). But wait, each cm³ has 1e9 cells.

Wait, no, because 1 cm³ is 1e-6 liters, but the concentration is per cm³. So each cm³ of medium has 1e9 cells. So the total volume of all the cells is (1e9 cells/cm³) * (1 cm³) = 1e9 cells. Each cell has a volume of 3.14e-18 m³, which is 3.14e-18 * 1e12 (since 1 m³ = 1e12 cm³?), wait wait no. Wait, 1 m³ is (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³. So 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³.

Wait, let me correct the unit conversions. The cell volume is 3.14e-18 m³. How many cm³ is that? Since 1 m³ is 1e6 liters, which is 1e6 * cm³ (since 1 liter is 1 cm³). So 1 m³ is 1e6 cm³. So 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³. So 3.14e-18 m³ = 3.14e-18 * 1e6 cm³ = 3.14e-12 cm³ per cell.

Each cell contributes 3.14e-12 cm³, and the concentration is 1e9 cells per cm³. So the total volume of all the cells is (1e9 cells/cm³) * (3.14e-12 cm³/cell) ) = 1e9 * 3.14e-12 = 3.14e-3 cm³. 

But wait, 1 cm³ of medium contains 3.14e-3 cm³ of cells. So the total occupied volume by the cells is 3.14e-3 cm³, and the total volume of the medium is 1 cm³.

So the percentage occupied is (3.14e-3 / 1) * 100% = 0.314%? Wait, 3.14e-3 is 0.00314, which is 0.314% of the total. But wait, looking at the options, option C is 0.0314% and option H is .157% (which is 0.157%).

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, the cell volume: diameter is 1.0 μm, so radius is 0.5 μm. So radius is 0.5e-6 meters. Length is 2.0 μm, so 2e-6 meters.

Cell volume: π r² h = π*(0.5e-6)^2 * 2e-6.

Calculate that:

(0.5e-6)^2 = 0.25e-12 m².

Multiply by 2e-6 meters: 0.25e-12 * 2e-6 = 0.5e-18 m³.

Multiply by π: about 1.57e-18 m³.

Wait, wait, that's a mistake. So 0.25e-12 * 2e-6 = (0.25 * 2) * e^(-12-6) = 0.5 e-18. So 0.5e-18 m³.

So 0.5e-18 m³ is the cell volume.

But wait, 1 m³ is 1e12 cm³. So 0.5e-18 m³ = 0.5e-18 * 1e12 cm³ = 0.5e-6 cm³.

Wait, 0.5e-6 cm³ is 5e-7 cm³ per cell.

So each cell is 5e-7 cm³.

So 1e9 cells per cm³ would have total cell volume of 1e9 * 5e-7 = 5e2 cm³.

Wait, 1e9 *5e-7 = (1e9)*(5e-7) = 5e2 cm³, which is 500 cm³.

But wait, each cm³ of medium has 500 cm³ of cells. That can't be right because if the concentration is 1e9 per cm³, then that's 1e9 cells per cm³. Each cell is 5e-7 cm³, so 1e9 *5e-7 = 5e2 cm³ of cells per cm³. But that would mean the total volume is way too large. So perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation.

Let me think again, perhaps I messed up the cell volume.

Wait, diameter is 1.0 μm, which is 1e-6 meters; radius is 0.5e-6 m. Length is 2.0 μm, 2e-6 m.

Cell volume = π r² h.

r² = (0.5e-6)^2 = 0.25e-12 m².

r² * h = 0.25e-12 * 2e-6 = 0.5e-18 m³.

Multiply by π: approximately 1.57e-18 m³.

So 1.57e-18 m³ per cell.

But 1 cm³ is 1e-6 liters, but I'm not sure that's helpful. Alternatively, let's convert this into cm³.

1 m³ = 1e6 liters = 1e6 cm³.

Wait, no, 1 liter is 1 cm³, so 1 m³ is 1e6 cm³. So 1 m³=1e6 cm³.

So 1.57e-18 m³ = 1.57e-18 * 1e6 cm³ = 1.57e-12 cm³ per cell.

Wait, because 1e-6 m³ = 1 cm³. So 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³. So 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³. So 1.57e-18 m³ is 1.57e-18 * 1e6 cm³ = 1.57e-12 cm³ per cell.

So each cell is 1.57e-12 cm³.

So the total cell volume per cm³ is 1e9 cells * 1.57e-12 cm³/cell = 1e9 *1.57e-12 = 1.57e-3 cm³ per cm³.

So 1.57e-3 cm³ are the cells in each cm³ of medium.

The total volume of the medium is 1 cm³. The cells occupy 1.57e-3 cm³ of that. So the percentage is (1.57e-3 / 1) *100% = 0.157%. 

Wait, that's 0.157%, which is option H. But looking back at the options, option H is .157% (0.157%), option G is 25%, option D is .0157%. Oh wait, no, let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 0.25%

B:0.57%

C:0.0314%

D: .0157%

E: 1.57%

F:3.14%

G:25%

H: .157%

I: .0157% 

J:5.7%

So I have 0.157% as the percentage. Looking at the options, H is 0.157%, so the answer should be H.

But wait, wait, wait. I need to make sure I didn't mix up the conversions. Let me re-calculate cell volume:

r = 0.5 μm = 0.5e-6 m.

h =2.0 μm = 2e-6 m.

Cell volume = π r² h.

r² = (0.5e-6)^2 = 0.25e-12 m².

Multiply by h: 0.25e-12 * 2e-6 = 0.5e-18 m³.

Multiply by π: 0.5e-18 * π ≈ 1.57e-18 m³ per cell.

Convert to cm³: 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³. So 1.57e-18 m³ = 1.57e-12 cm³.

So each cell is 1.57e-12 cm³.

Concentration is 1e9 cells per cm³.

Total cell volume is 1e9 *1.57e-12 cm³ = 1.57e-3 cm³.

So percentage is (1.57e-3 / 1) *100 = 0.157%.

So the answer should be option H: .157%.

To determine the percentage of the total volume of the culture medium occupied by the cells, we start by calculating the volume of a single E. coli cell. The cell is cylindrical with a diameter of 1.0 μm (radius = 0.5 μm) and a length of 2.0 μm. The volume of a cylinder is given by:

\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
r = 0.5 \, \mu\text{m} = 0.5 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}, \quad h = 2.0 \, \mu\text{m} = 2.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

\[
V = \pi (0.5 \times 10^{-6})^2 (2.0 \times 10^{-6}) = \pi (0.25 \times 10^{-12}) (2.0 \times 10^{-6}) = \pi (0.5 \times 10^{-18}) \, \text{m}^3
\]

\[
V \approx 1.57 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{per cell}.
\]

Next, convert the cell volume to cm³. Since \(1 \, \text{m}^3 = 10^6 \, \text{cm}^3\):

\[
1.57 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{m}^3 = 1.57 \times 10^{-18} \times 10^6 \, \text{cm}^3 = 1.57 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{cm}^3 \, \text{per cell}.
\]

The concentration of cells is \(10^9 \, \text{cells/cm}^3\). Therefore, the total volume occupied by the cells is:

\[
\text{Total cell volume} = 10^9 \, \text{cells/cm}^3 \times 1.57 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{cm}^3/\text{cell} = 1.57 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{cm}^3/\text{cm}^3.
\]

This means that \(1.57 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{cm}^3\) of the medium is occupied by the cells. To find the percentage of the total volume occupied by the cells:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.57 \times 10^{-3}}{1} \right) \times 100\% = 0.157\%.
\]

Thus, the percentage of the total volume of the culture medium occupied by the cells is **0.157%**, which corresponds to option **H**.
