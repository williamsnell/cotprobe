Answer:
    <think>
<think>
Okay, so I have this question about formal grammars and generating sentences. Let me try to break it down. The question is about which string isn't generated by the given grammar rules. The options are A through F, and I need to find which one isn't a valid sentence.

The grammar is defined as a context-free grammar with the rules:

A → BC
B → x|Bx
C → B|D
D → y|Ey
E → z

Hmm, so I need to see which of these strings can't be derived from these rules. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A: "xy" — Let's see if that can be generated. Starting from A → BC. Each B and C must be generated. Let's see.

For B: B can be x or Bx. So B could be x. For C: C can be B or D. If C is B (x), then C is x. So A would be x followed by x, making "xx". But option A is "xy". Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, could B be Bx and C be something else? Let me think.

Wait, maybe B is Bx and then C is something else. Let's see. B is Bx, so that would make B become B followed by x. But then C is B or D. Wait, perhaps I should think in reverse: can "xy" be broken down into parts that fit the rules.

Alternatively, maybe "xy" is generated by another production. For example, what if B is x (since B → x or Bx, so B could be x). Then C must be y. But C is defined as B or D. So C can't be y directly. Hmm, maybe not. Or wait, perhaps C can be a series of steps. Wait, C is B or D. So if C can be a sequence of B and D steps. But how?

Wait, maybe "xy" is not possible. Because A is BC, so B and C must each be non-empty. Let's think about B and C.

If B is x (since B can be x or Bx), then B is x. Then C must be y. But C can be B or D. So C can be B (which is x) or D (which is y or Ey). So if C is y, then C could be D, which is y. So C would be D, which is y. So then A becomes BC → x followed by y → "xy", which is option A. So option A is generated. So A is a possible sentence.

Option B: "xxzy" — Let's see. A is BC. So B and C can each be generated.

B is either x or Bx. Let's see, if B is x, then C would be what? C is B or D. So C could be x (if B is x) or D. Let's try B as x and C as x. Then A is xx. But that's not "xxzy". Alternatively, maybe B is Bx, so B is B followed by x. Let's see: B would be Bx, which is B followed by x. So if B is Bx, and C is x, then A would be Bx followed by x → Bxx. But that's not the target string.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another approach. Let's build the string step by step.

We need to get to "xx zy". Wait, the string is "xxzy", so four letters.

Wait, perhaps B is x and C is xzy. No, because C can't have z. Alternatively, maybe B and C each contribute parts. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the grammar's rules:

A → BC. So B and C each must be generated by their own rules.

B → x | Bx. So B can be x, or B followed by x. So in any case, B is at least x.

C → B | D. So C can be B (which is x or more) or D (y or Ey). So C can be y, or B followed by something.

D → y | Ey. So D can be y, or Ey (which is y repeated e times).

E → z. So E is just a single z.

So, let's try to construct "xxzy".

Break it down: x x z y.

Wait, "xxzy" is four letters. So maybe:

Let me try to see how this can be built.

Option B: "xxzy"

Let me see if that can be generated.

Option B is x x z y.

Looking for the production steps:

A → BC.

So B and C each must generate.

Let me suppose B is xx. But B can't be xx because B's rules are x or Bx. So B can't be xx. So instead, perhaps B is x followed by something else.

Wait, no. Let's think: B can be x or Bx. So if B is x, then B must be x. Then, C must be x z y, but that's not possible because C is either B or D. Wait, C is built from B or D. But B is x, so C can be x (if C is B) or D (y, or Ey). So can't get into z. So this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps B is Bx, which would make B as Bx. So B is B followed by x. So B could be Bx, making it B followed by x.

Wait, but then what about C? Let me think: B is Bx, so B is (Bx) followed by x. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Alternative approach: let's try to see if "xxzy" is possible.

We need to generate B and C such that B is followed by C, and their concatenation is xxzy.

Let me think: Let me split into B and C.

Suppose B is x. Then C would have to be xx z y. But C can't be xx z y because C is either B or D.

Wait, maybe B is Bx, which would make B = Bx. So B is B followed by x. So if B is Bx, then B is B followed by x.

Wait, perhaps B is x, and then B is Bx → B = Bx → B must be B followed by x. So B as Bx is perhaps a way to build it. Let's see:

Option B is xxzy.

Wait, perhaps B is x, C is xxzy. But C can't be xxzy because C is either B or D.

Alternatively, let me think: perhaps B is Bx, which is B followed by x. So if B is Bx, then B is B followed by x.

Wait, but then what about C? Let me see: B is Bx, so B is (Bx) followed by x? No, that's not right. The way the grammar works is that each production is a string made by replacing the non-terminal with the right-hand side.

Wait, perhaps I should try to break down the string "xxzy" into B and C.

So B is part of BC. Let's think: B could be xx, but B's production can't create xx because B is either x or Bx.

So B must be x, and then C would be xx z y. But C can't be that. Alternatively, perhaps C is not being built correctly.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider the possible strings that can be generated.

Each step of the grammar depends on the rules. Let's see what each non-terminal can produce.

Starting with A → BC.

So BC must be a string that starts with B and ends with C.

Each B can be x or Bx.

So B can be x, or Bx (which is B followed by x).

Similarly, C is B or D.

D is y or Ey.

E is z.

So let's think about possible B and C combinations.

Possible Bs:

- x

- Bx (which would be B followed by x)

Possible Cs:

- B

- D

- E → z.

So for B, it's either x or Bx. For C, it's either B, D, or z.

So, let's see what can BC be.

Case 1: B is x (so B is x). Then C can be B (which is x) or D (y or Ey).

So BC would be x followed by x → xx, or x followed by D → xD.

Wait, D is y or Ey. So xD could be x y or x Ey.

Case 2: B is Bx. So B is Bx, which is B followed by x.

So BC would be (Bx) followed by C.

C can be B, D, or z.

So if B is Bx, then BC is (Bx) C.

If C is B, then BC is Bx B → BxB.

If C is D, then BxB D.

If C is z, then BxB z.

Wait, but D is y or Ey. So let's see: If C is D, then BC would be Bx D.

Hmm, all of these possibilities.

So any BC must start with B and end with C.

Let me think about the possible strings.

Wait, let's think about the possible lengths. For example, the string "xxzy" is four letters. So BC must be four letters.

So, possible B and C combinations for a four-letter string:

Let me see:

Suppose B is x (2 letters), and C is xzy (but C can't be xzy). Alternatively, B is x, C is xzy is impossible because C can't start with x and have three letters.

Wait, perhaps B is Bx (which is two letters), and C is x y z. But C can't be x y z because C is either B, D, or z.

Wait, maybe B is Bx (so Bx is two letters), and C is y z. But C is either B, D, or z. So if C is y z, that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I should list all possible BC options.

Alternatively, let me think of the possible strings generated. Maybe I can find a pattern.

Wait, the grammar seems to generate strings that are sequences of x's, y's, and z's, but with some constraints.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "xy" → possible.

Option B: "xxzy" → possible? Let me see.

Wait, can B be xx? No, because B's rule is x or Bx. So B can't be xx.

Hmm, maybe B is x, and C is xxzy. But C must be B or D or z.

Wait, no. Because B is x, C must be B (so x) or D (so y or Ey).

So C can't be xxzy. So this approach doesn't work.

Wait, maybe B is Bx, which is B followed by x. Then B is (Bx) followed by some C.

Wait, perhaps I should think about building the string step by step.

Option B is "xxzy".

Let me see: B and C such that B is part of the string before C.

If B is x, then C is xxzy. But C can't be xxzy because C must be B, D, or z.

Wait, no. So perhaps B is Bx, meaning B is (Bx) followed by x. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Another approach: let's consider each option and see if it can be generated.

Option A: "xy"

Can this be generated?

Let me try A → BC.

B and C must be generated.

Let me see:

B can be x, and C can be y. But C can only be B or D. So C can't be y directly. So maybe B is x and C is D, which is y. So BC would be x y → "xy". So yes, it's possible. So A is a valid sentence.

Option B: "xxzy"

Let me try. A → BC.

We need B followed by C to be xxzy.

Let me see what B and C could be.

Option: B is x, C is xx z y. But C can't be xx z y because it's longer than allowed. So that's impossible.

Alternative idea: Maybe B is Bx, so B is B followed by x. Then B is (Bx), and then C is something. For example, B is Bx, and then C is something that ends with z y.

Wait, perhaps B is Bx, and C is z y. But C can't be z y because C can only be B, D, or z.

Wait, but D is y or Ey. So if C is D, then C is y or Ey. So if C is D, which is y, then BC is Bx followed by D → Bx D. So Bx D is Bx followed by D. So Bx is B followed by x, and D is y or Ey. So Bx D would be (Bx) (y or Ey). So Bx is part of B, making BC as Bx D.

So for example, B is x, then C is D (y). So BC is x y → "xy", which is option A. But that's not what we're looking for.

Wait, another approach. Let me see if "xxzy" is possible.

Is there a way for B to be Bx (so B has to be at least two letters), and C to be something else.

Wait, B is Bx, so B is (B) followed by x. Then C must be something. Let's say C is D (y or Ey).

So B is Bx, and C is y.

So BC is Bx y.

But Bx is B followed by x. So Bx y is B followed by x and then y.

So for example, if B is x, then Bx is x followed by x, so Bx is xx. Then BC would be xx y → "xx y", which is "xx y", but the string is "xxzy". Hmm, but that would be "xx y z" if C is z. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Bx, and C is D (y). So BC would be Bx y. So Bx is B followed by x.

So B is Bx (so B is (B) x), but B could be x or Bx.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me see if I can find a way to build "xxzy".

Suppose B is x. Then C must be xxzy. But C can't be xxzy because C is either B, D, or z. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe B is Bx, and C is z y. But C can't be z y.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck. Let me think about other options.

Option C: "xz" → x followed by z. Can this be generated?

Yes, because A → BC, so B is x, C is z. Wait, can C be z? Because C can be B or D or z. So if C is z, then yes. So B is x (so B is x), and C is z. So BC is x z → "xz". So C is a valid sentence.

Option D: "xxxxy" → five x's followed by y.

Wait, let's see: A → BC. So B and C must be generated.

If B is x, then C must be xxxy. But C can't be xxxy because C is either B, D, or z. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Bx, and C is xxxy. But again, C can't be xxxy.

Alternatively, maybe B is Bx repeatedly. Let me try:

B could be Bx (so B is B followed by x). Then C must be xxxy. But C can't be xxxy, so that's not possible.

Wait, another approach: can BC be x followed by x followed by x followed by x followed by y.

Wait, but that's x x x x y → "xxxx y". Let's see if that can be generated.

BC would be x followed by x x x y. So B is x, C is x x x y.

But C can't be x x x y because C is either B, D, or z. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Bx, and C is x x x y. But again, C can't be that.

Hmm, perhaps "xxxxy" is not a possible string. Let me think: maybe B is Bx, and then C is x x x y. But again, C can't be xxxy.

Wait, maybe B is x, and C is x x x x y. But C can't be that. So perhaps "xxxxy" is not a possible string. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Option E: "xyz" → x y z.

Can this be generated?

Yes. Because A → BC. So B can be x, and C can be y z. But C can't be y z because C is B, D, or z. So C can't be y z. Wait, but B is x, so C would have to be something else.

Wait, maybe B is Bx, so B is B followed by x. Then C would be y z. But again, C can't be y z because C can only be B, D, or z. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps B is x, and C is y z. But C can't be y z. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is Bx, so B is B followed by x. Then C would have to be something else. Let me see, since C could be B, D, or z.

So if B is Bx, then C can be B, which would make BC as Bx B → BxB.

But BxB is (B followed by x) followed by B. So BxB is B B x B. That's not xyz. So that's not it.

Alternatively, C could be D, which is y or Ey. So if C is D, then BC would be Bx D. So Bx is (B followed by x), D is y or Ey.

So Bx D would be (B followed by x) followed by D. So for example, B is x, so Bx is x x. Then D is y. So BC is x x y → "xx y", which is option A. Hmm.

Wait, but option E is "xyz". How can that be?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again: A → BC → B and C are each generated by their own rules.

So for E: A → BC.

We need BC to be "xyz".

So B must be something, and C must be something else.

So B can be x or Bx. Let's see if B is x.

Then C must be "y z", but C can't be that. So that's not possible.

So B must be Bx, so B is B followed by x. Then C would have to be "y z", but again, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps B is x, and C is "y z" is not possible, so maybe C is not z but something else. Wait, but C can't be anything else except B, D, or z.

Wait, maybe B is x, and C is y z. But that's not allowed. So perhaps BC can't be "xyz" because C can't be "yz".

Wait, but then "xyz" would require C to be "y z", which is not allowed. So perhaps "xyz" can't be generated. So option E is not a valid sentence.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: is "xyz" a valid string that can be generated by the grammar.

Let me see: A → BC.

So B and C must each be generated.

B can be x or Bx.

C can be B, D, or z.

So for B, if B is x, then C is generated by C being B, D, or z.

So if B is x, then C can be any string that starts with x, but C can't be x followed by something because C's production is B, D, or z.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should list all possible BC combinations.

Wait, perhaps "xyz" can't be generated because C can't be "yz".

Wait, let me think again: Option E is "xyz".

We need A → BC, so B and C are such that BC is "xyz".

So B is a string, C is a string, and when you put them together, it's "xyz".

So B must be the string before C in "xyz". So B is the first part, and C is the second part.

So, B could be x, and C would have to be "y z", but C can't be "y z". So that's impossible.

Alternatively, B could be Bx, so B is B followed by x. Then C would have to be "y z", but again, C can't be "y z".

Wait, unless C is z and B is "xy". But that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps "xyz" can't be generated, so option E is not a valid sentence.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Let me see what each production can do.

For example, B can be x or Bx.

So, to get a string with x's, y's, and z's, perhaps the grammar allows it.

Wait, perhaps "xyz" is a valid string. Let me see:

A → BC.

B could be x, and then C would be y z. But C can't be y z because C can only be B, D, or z.

So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps B is Bx, so B is B followed by x. Then C would have to be "y z", but again, C can't be that.

Alternatively, perhaps C is D, which is y or Ey. So if C is D, then BC would be B followed by D.

So B is x (so B is x), D is y. So BC is x y.

But that's "xy", which is option A.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me consider each option again.

Option A: "xy" → We've already thought this is possible. So A is a valid sentence.

Option B: "xxzy" → I'm stuck. Let me think: A → BC.

Suppose B is x, then C would be xxzy. But C can't be xxzy. So that's impossible.

Alternatively, B is Bx, which is B followed by x. Then C would have to be something else.

Wait, perhaps B is Bx and C is z. So BC would be Bx z.

But Bx is generated by B followed by x. So Bx is (B) x. So Bx z is B x z.

But for example, B could be x, x, x, etc. Wait, but perhaps B is Bx, and C is z.

So BC would be (B x) z. So B is Bx, which is B followed by x. So B is B followed by x. So B is x followed by x, but B can't be that because B can only be x or Bx.

Wait, this is confusing. Let's think differently.

Maybe I should list all possible BC combinations.

Wait, another approach: Let me see what each production can contribute.

A → BC.

So BC must be a string generated in this way.

So B is a string, and C is a string.

Each B is generated by either x or Bx.

Each C is generated by B, D, or z.

So for example:

If B is x, then C can be B (x), D (y), or z.

So if B is x and C is z, then BC is x z.

Which is "xz" → which is valid (option C is "xz", so that's correct).

If B is x and C is D (y), then BC is x y → which is option A.

If B is x and C is z, then "xz" is valid.

If B is Bx, then B is B followed by x. So B is Bx, and C is B, so BC is Bx B.

Which is B followed by x, followed by B. So for example, B is x, so BC is x x x → "xxx".

Alternatively, B is Bx and C is D, which is y. So BC would be Bx D → which is B followed by x, followed by D (y or Ey). So that's "Bx y" or "Bx Ey".

Wait, but B is Bx, which is B followed by x. So BC would be Bx D.

Hmm, I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the impossible strings.

Option B: "xxzy" → Can this be generated?

Let me see: A → BC.

If B is x, then C must be xxzy. But C can't be xxzy because C can only be B, D, or z.

So that's impossible.

Alternatively, B is Bx, so B is B followed by x. Then C would have to be something else.

But then BC would be Bx C. C must be B, D, or z. So if C is z, then BC is Bx z.

Which is B followed by x, followed by z.

But B is x, so BC is x x z → "xxx z" → "xxxx z"? Wait, no. Let me count.

Wait, B is x, so BC is x x z → that's three letters: x, x, z → "xx z", but that's not possible.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the possible BC combinations.

Wait, perhaps the only possible BCs are generated by the rules.

So, for example:

If B is x, then C can be B (x), D (y), or z.

So BC would be x x (xx, zz, xz).

So possible BCs are xx, zz, xz.

If B is Bx, then B is B followed by x. So B is Bx. Then C can be B, D, or z.

So BC would be Bx B (B followed by x followed by B), Bx D (B followed by x followed by D), or Bx z.

But Bx B is B followed by x followed by B. So for example, if B is x, then Bx B is x x x → "xxx".

If B is Bx, then Bx B is B followed by x followed by B. So for example, if B is Bx, Bx B is Bx Bx B?

Wait, no, because B is Bx, so Bx B is Bx Bx B? No, that's not correct. It's Bx followed by B.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the possible BCs.

The possible BCs are:

- B is x, C is B → so BC is x x.

- B is x, C is D → so BC is x D.

- B is x, C is z → so BC is x z.

- B is Bx, C is B → so BC is Bx B.

- B is Bx, C is D → so BC is Bx D.

- B is Bx, C is z → so BC is Bx z.

So possible BCs are: x x, x D, x z, Bx B, Bx D, Bx z.

Wait, but the grammar's rules are:

A → BC.

B → x | Bx.

C → B | D | z.

So, when B is x, then C can be B, D, or z. So BC is x B, x D, x z.

When B is Bx, then C can be B, D, or z. So BC is Bx B, Bx D, Bx z.

So possible BCs are x B, x D, x z, Bx B, Bx D, Bx z.

Now, let's see what each of these can produce.

Looking at possible BCs:

1. x B: x follows B, which can be x or Bx.

So B is x → x x → "xx".

B is Bx → x Bx → x (B x) → "xBx".

2. x D: x followed by D, which can be y or Ey.

So x D is x y or x Ey.

3. x z: x followed by z → "xz".

4. Bx B: Bx followed by B. So Bx is B followed by x. So Bx B is (B x) B → which is B x B.

5. Bx D: Bx followed by D. So Bx is B x, and D is y or Ey. So Bx D is B x D.

6. Bx z: Bx followed by z → Bx z → B x z.

So possible BCs are:

- x x → "xx"

- x D → "xD" or "x Ey"

- x z → "xz"

- Bx B → "Bx B"

- Bx D → "Bx D"

- Bx z → "Bx z"

Now, let's see which of these can be generated by the grammar.

The grammar can generate:

- A → BC.

- B → x | Bx.

- C → B | D | z.

So, for example, A can be generated as BC.

Now, let's see which of the possible BCs can be generated.

Looking at each possible BC:

1. x B: x followed by B. B can be x or Bx.

So x B can be x x or x Bx.

x x → "xx"

x Bx → "xBx"

So these are possible.

2. x D: x followed by D. D is y or Ey.

So x D is "xD" or "x Ey".

3. x z: x followed by z. So "xz".

4. Bx B: Bx followed by B. Bx is B followed by x. B is x or Bx.

So Bx B is (B x) B.

Which can be:

If B is x, then Bx B is x x B → "xx B".

But B can be x or Bx.

If B is Bx, then Bx B is Bx Bx B → "Bx Bx B".

Hmm.

5. Bx D: Bx followed by D. Bx is B followed by x. D is y or Ey.

So Bx D is B x D.

6. Bx z: Bx followed by z. So Bx z.

Now, looking at the grammar rules, can any of these BCs be generated?

Yes, for example:

- A → BC.

- B → x or Bx.

- C → B, D, or z.

So, for example:

If B is x, then C can be B (x), D (y), or z. So BC would be x x, x y, or x z.

But BC can also be x B, which is x followed by B (which can be x or Bx).

But the grammar allows for x B to be generated if B is x, which would make BC as x x, but also x Bx.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again.

Let me think again about the possible BCs.

Looking for each possible BC, whether it can be generated by the grammar.

Take option B: "xxzy".

We need to see if this can be generated.

So, A → BC.

Let me see what BC could be.

If B is x, then C can be B (x), D (y), or z.

So BC would be x x, x y, or x z.

But BC is "xxzy", which is four letters: x, x, z, y.

So the BC part is "xxzy", which is four letters, but the possible BCs are of the form x followed by B, x D, x z, etc.

So for example, if B is x, then C must be x x, x y, or x z. But "xxzy" is four letters, which would require that B is x and C is x z, but then BC would be x x z.

Wait, but "xxzy" is four letters, which would require that B is x and C is x z, but then BC would be x x z, which is three letters. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Bx, so B is B followed by x. Then C would have to be something else.

But this is getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress.

Let me think of the options again.

Option B: "xxzy".

If I can't find a way to generate this, then it's the answer.

So, given that I'm stuck, perhaps the answer is option B: "xxzy" is not a valid sentence.

So, I think the answer is B.
</think>

The given grammar defines the production rules for generating sentences. The grammar is defined as follows:

- A → BC
- B → x | Bx
- C → B | D | z

To generate a sentence, the string must be formed by a series of productions according to the grammar. Let's analyze each option to determine if it can be generated by the grammar.

### Option A: "xy"
- **Production Steps:**
  1. A → BC
  2. Choose B = x and C = y (since C can be B, D, or z).
  3. BC = x y.
- **Conclusion:** This is a valid sentence.

### Option B: "xxzy"
- **Production Steps:**
  1. A → BC
