Okay, so I've got this problem about Nelson's Cycle Shop and their inventory. Let's see, I need to figure out the final inventory after January. Hmm. Let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says they started with $30,156 as the inventory on January 1. Then, during the month, they made new merchandise purchases totaling $28,300. And sales were $72,600. Oh wait, and the margin on sales is 45%. I'm a bit fuzzy on margins, but I think that refers to the profit margin. So, maybe that's the gross margin? So, sales minus... wait, no, maybe the cost of goods sold is calculated with the margin?

Wait, maybe the margin refers to the markup. So if the margin is 45%, that's the profit margin. So, for example, if the cost is $100, and the margin is 45%, then the selling price would be $100 plus 45% of $100, which is $145. Alternatively, sometimes margin is calculated as (selling price - cost)/selling price. So, 45% margin would mean that the cost is 55% of the selling price.

Wait, but in this context, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. So, the problem is about calculating the ending inventory, which I think is done using the COGS (cost of goods sold) method. So, the formula I remember is ending inventory = beginning inventory + purchases - COGS.

So, the beginning inventory is $30,156. Purchases are $28,300. But wait, purchases are part of COGS. So, the first part of the formula is 30,156 plus 28,300, which is 58,456. Then subtract COGS.

But wait, how do I find COGS? COGS is the cost of goods sold, which is calculated based on the sales and the margin. So, if the margin is 45%, that's the profit margin. So, for each dollar of sales, 45% is profit. So, the cost would be 100% - 45% = 55% of the cost. So, sales are $72,600, and that's equal to COGS plus margin (which is 45% of COGS). So, 72,600 = COGS * (1 + 0.45). So, COGS is 72,600 / 1.45. Let me calculate that.

72,600 divided by 1.45. Let's see, 72,600 / 1.45. Hmm, 1.45 times 50,000 is 72,500. So, 50,000 * 1.45=72,500. So, 72,600 is 72,600-72,500=100 over 1.45. So, that's 100/1.45 = approximately 68.9655. So, COGS is approximately 50,000 + 68.9655 = 50,068.9655. So, about $50,069.

Wait, but wait, another approach. Alternatively, since margin is 45%, then COGS = (Selling Price) / (1 + margin). So, 72,600 / 1.45. Let's compute that accurately.

Let me do the division step by step. 72,600 divided by 1.45.

First, 72,600 รท 1.45.

Well, 1.45 times 50,000 is 72,500. So, 50,000 * 1.45 = 72,500.

So, 72,600 is 100 more than 72,500. So, 100 / 1.45 = approximately 68.9655. So, 50,000 + 68.9655 = 50,068.9655. So, COGS is approximately $50,069.

So, now, the COGS is $50,069. So, the ending inventory would be beginning inventory plus purchases minus COGS.

So, beginning inventory is 30,156. Purchases are 28,300. So, 30,156 + 28,300 = 58,456.

Then, subtract COGS (50,069) from that. So, 58,456 - 50,069 = ?

Let me calculate 58,456 minus 50,069.

58,456 - 50,000 is 8,456, but then subtract 69 more. So, 8,456 - 69 = 8,387.

So, the ending inventory would be $8,387.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Hmm. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the margin calculation. Let's try again. The margin is 45%, which is the profit margin. So, the formula for COGS is usually (Selling Price) / (1 + margin). So, 72,600 / 1.45.

Wait, but 72,600 / 1.45 equals, let's calculate precisely.

1.45 * 50,000 = 72,500. So, 72,600 is 100 more. So, 100 / 1.45 = 68.9655. So, 50,000 + 68.9655 = 50,068.9655. So, COGS is approximately 50,069.

So, then the ending inventory is beginning (30,156) + purchases (28,300) - COGS (50,069) = 30,156 +28,300=58,456 -50,069=8,387.

But looking at the options, none of them is 8,387. So, I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe the margin is the cost percentage. Like, the cost is the cost of sales, and 45% is the margin on cost. Oh! That makes more sense. So, if the margin is 45% on cost, then COGS = cost, and profit is 45% of COGS. So, total sales would be COGS + (0.45 * COGS) = COGS *1.45.

Wait, but that's the same as the previous approach. So, then, that approach would still give us the same COGS as before.

But then, the ending inventory is 30,156 +28,300 -50,069=8,387. But this isn't an option, so there's something wrong here.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm not considering that the margin is on the entire sale, not on COGS. So, maybe the markup is 45%, meaning that cost is 55% of the selling price. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the sales as being 1.45 times COGS. So, 72,600 = 1.45 * COGS. So, COGS is 72,600 / 1.45=50,068.9655, as before.

But that leads to the same ending inventory as before.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the 45% margin is on the cost, not the sales. So, if the margin is 45% on cost, then COGS would be cost, and sales would be cost plus 45% of cost, so 145% of cost. So, 72,600 = 1.45 * COGS. So, COGS is 72,600 / 1.45 =50,068.97.

Same result. So, the calculation leads to COGS=50,069.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option J: $25,400, but that's about half of what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the beginning steps. Let me re-express the problem.

The question says "the margin on sales was 45%". So, margin on sales is 45%. So, that would be (sales - COGS) / sales = 45%. So, (72,600 - COGS)/72,600 =0.45. So, 72,600 - COGS = 72,600 * 0.45.

72,600 *0.45 = Let's calculate that. 70,000 *0.45=31,500. 2,600 *0.45=1,170. So, total is 31,500+1,170=32,670.

So, 72,600 - COGS =32,670. So, COGS=72,600-32,670=39,930.

Ah, that's different. So, COGS is 39,930.

So, now, the ending inventory is beginning inventory (30,156) + purchases (28,300) - COGS (39,930).

So, 30,156 +28,300 =58,456. Then, subtract 39,930.

58,456 -39,930.

58,456 minus 39,930 is 18,526.

Looking at the options, option C is 32,670, option G is 18,526. So, that's option G.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the COGS calculation.

The margin on sales is 45%. So, sales - COGS = margin on sales. So, sales is 72,600. So, COGS is 72,600 - (0.45 *72,600). Which is 72,600*(1-0.45) =72,600*0.55.

Wait, 0.55 *72,600. Let's compute that.

72,600 *0.5 =36,300.

72,600 *0.05=3,630.

So, 36,300 +3,630=39,930. So, COGS is 39,930.

So, yes, ending inventory is 30,156 +28,300 =58,456 -39,930=18,526.

So, the answer is option G: $18,526.

The problem involves estimating the final inventory for Nelson's Cycle Shop using the formula: 

**Ending Inventory = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - COGS**

### Step 1: Calculate COGS
The margin on sales is 45%, meaning that 45% of sales is the profit, and COGS is 55% of sales. 

- **Sales** = $72,600
- **COGS** = 55% of $72,600 = 0.55 * $72,600

Breaking this down:
- 50% of $72,600 = $36,300
- 5% of $72,600 = $3,630
- **COGS** = $36,300 + $3,630 = $39,930

### Step 2: Calculate Ending Inventory
- **Beginning Inventory** = $30,156
- **Purchases** = $28,300
- **COGS** = $39,930

**Ending Inventory** = $30,156 + $28,300 - $39,930  
**Ending Inventory** = $58,456 - $39,930 = $18,526

### Step 3: Match with Options
The calculated ending inventory is $18,526, which corresponds to **Option G**.
