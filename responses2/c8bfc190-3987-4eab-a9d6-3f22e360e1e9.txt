Okay, so I have this problem about reflecting a pentagon across the line y = x. I'm a bit rusty on coordinate geometry, but I think I can figure this out step by step.

First, the pentagon P has vertices at specific coordinates: (-2, -4), (-4, 1), (-1, 4), (2, 4), and (3, 0). The task is to find one of the vertices of the reflected pentagon P'. The options are given, so maybe I can figure out the reflection of one of these points.

I remember that reflecting a point across the line y = x swaps the x and y coordinates. So, for any point (a, b), its reflection across y=x would be (b, a). Let me test this with one of the points to make sure I'm right.

Let's take the first point: (-2, -4). Reflecting across y=x would make it (-4, -2). Hmm, looking at the options, D is (-4, -2), which seems to match. But wait, let me check another point to confirm.

Take the second point: (-4, 1). Reflecting across y=x would give (1, -4). Looking at the options, none of them are (1, -4). So, that point isn't an option. Let me check another one. The third point is (-1, 4), so reflection would be (4, -1). Again, not an option. The fourth point is (2,4), so reflection is (4,2). Option I is (1,4), which is different. Option F: (-1, -4) isn't either. The fifth point is (3,0), so reflection is (0,3). Not an option either.

Hmm, okay, so only the first point's reflection is an option. So the answer would be D: (-4, -2). Alternatively, maybe I should look at all the reflections to see if any others match the options.

Wait another thing: reflecting across y = x swaps x and y. So let me list all the original points and their reflections:

1. (-2, -4) → (-4, -2) → D
2. (-4, 1) → (1, -4) → Not an option.
3. (-1, 4) → (4, -1) → Not an option.
4. (2,4) → (4,2) → Not an option.
5. (3,0) → (0,3) → Not an option.

So yes, only the first point's reflection is an option, which is D: (-4, -2). Therefore, the answer is D.

The correct reflection of the point (-2, -4) across the line y = x is (-4, -2), which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
