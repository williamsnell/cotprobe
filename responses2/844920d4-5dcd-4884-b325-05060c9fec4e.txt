Okay, so I've got this problem about a projector and I need to find the size of the projected image. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but I'll take it slow.

First, the problem says the projector has a lens with a 40 cm focal length. The object is 4.0 cm long, and the image is formed 20 meters away from the lens. I'm supposed to find the size of the image.

Hmm, I remember that for projectors, the image is usually formed on a screen, so the lens must be acting as a converging lens. So I'll probably need to use the thin lens equation here. The thin lens equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.

Wait, but wait. The object is placed somewhere, but what's the object distance? Oh, right, the object is the slide, which is 4.0 cm in length. But for the thin lens equation, I think we consider the object distance as the distance from the lens to the object. So the object is 4.0 cm away from the lens? Or is it the size of the object, which is 4.0 cm?

Wait, no, the object's size is 4.0 cm. But for the thin lens equation, I think the object distance is the distance from the lens to the object, not the size. So I'll have to think about that.

Wait, but the object is a slide. So the object is placed a certain distance from the lens, which is 4 cm. So in the lens equation, do is 4 cm? Or is do the distance from the lens to the object, which is 4 cm. So the object is 4 cm in size?

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing the object's size with the object distance. The object is the slide, which is 4 cm in length. But for the thin lens equation, do is the distance from the lens to the object. So in this case, the object is placed 4 cm away from the lens, so do =4 cm.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Because the object is the slide, which is probably a small object, but the projection is made. Wait, but in the problem, the object slide is 4 cm long. So perhaps the object is a 4 cm tall object? Or maybe it's a 4 cm wide object? Because the size of the object is given as 4.0 cm.

But for the thin lens equation, do is the distance from the lens to the object, not the size. So if the object is 4 cm in length, then do is 4 cm. So that part is clear.

So f is 40 cm. So the focal length is 40 cm. Now, using the thin lens equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

Plugging in the numbers: 1/40 = 1/4 + 1/di.

Wait, 1/4 is 0.25. So 1/40 is 0.025. So 0.025 = 0.25 + 1/di. Oh wait, that can't be right. Because 0.025 is less than 0.25. So 0.25 + 1/di would be larger than 0.25. So 0.025 is less than that, which would mean that 1/di is negative. Hmm, that can't be because di is positive in a converging lens (the image is real and on the screen).

Wait, maybe I got the object distance wrong. Oh wait, no. Let me check. Wait, the object is placed 4 cm away from the lens, so do is 4 cm. So 1/40 = 1/4 + 1/di. Wait, 1/4 is 0.25. 1/40 is 0.025. So 0.025 = 0.25 + (1/di). So 1/di would be 0.025 - 0.25 = -0.225. So 1/di is negative, which would mean di is negative. But that's impossible because di should be positive for a real image (the screen is on the other side of the lens). So perhaps I got the object distance wrong.

Wait, maybe the object distance is not 4 cm. Because the object is the slide, which is 4 cm in length, but the physical object is 4 cm. So maybe the object is placed 4 cm from the lens. So that's do =4 cm. But then, the image is formed 20 meters away. Wait, 20 meters is 2000 cm. So di is 2000 cm.

Wait, but according to the thin lens equation, 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

Wait, but substituting the numbers: 1/40 = 1/4 + 1/2000.

Calculating the right-hand side: 1/4 is 0.25; 1/2000 is 0.0005. So 0.25 + 0.0005 = 0.2505. So 1/f would be 0.2505. But f is 40 cm, which means 1/f is 0.025. So the equation would be 0.025 = 0.2505. That can't be right. So something's wrong with my approach.

Wait, perhaps the object distance is not 4 cm. Oh, wait, perhaps the object is 4 cm in size, but the distance from the lens is different. Wait, but the problem states the object is 4.0 cm long, but the object distance is the distance from the lens to the object, which is 4 cm? Hmm, maybe that's correct, but the equation doesn't balance.

Wait, maybe I got the object and image distances mixed up. Let me think again. The object is 4 cm in size, but the object distance is 4 cm from the lens. The image is 20 m (2000 cm) away. So the lens is between the object and the screen. So the image is real, so di is positive.

Wait, but in that case, 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. So 1/40 cm^-1 = 1/4 cm + 1/2000 cm.

Wait, compute the right side:

1/4 is 0.25, 1/2000 is 0.0005. So sum is 0.2505. So 1/f is 0.025 (since f is 40 cm), but 0.2505 ≈ 0.2505, which is not equal to 0.025.

Wait, that's a problem. So that's impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the object distance.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the object is placed beyond the focal length, causing a real image. But in that case, the image distance would be positive. Let me recalculate.

Wait, what's the thin lens equation again? 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

I have f =40 cm, do =4 cm? But that gives:

1/40 = 1/4 + 1/di → 0.025 = 0.25 + 1/di → 1/di = 0.025 - 0.25 = -0.225 → di= -4.444 cm.

Wait, that's negative. Which would mean the image is virtual and on the same side as the object, which can't be the case because di is positive for a real image. So that can't be.

Hmm, maybe the object distance is not 4 cm. Maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read the problem again.

The problem states: "A projector with a lens of 40 cm focal length illuminates an objectslide 4.0 cm long and throws an image upon a screen 20 m from the lens." So the object is the slide (4 cm in length?), and the image is formed 20 m away.

Wait, perhaps the object is a 4 cm tall object? Because the object is 4.0 cm long. So maybe the object is 4 cm in height, not 4 cm in length. So the object's height is 4 cm, and it's placed 4 cm from the lens.

Wait, but in the thin lens equation, 'do' is the object distance (from lens to object), and for a real image, di should be positive.

Wait, let me think again. The image is formed 20 m (2000 cm) from the lens. So di is 2000 cm. So the equation is:

1/40 = 1/4 + 1/2000.

Compute 1/4 = 0.25, 1/2000 = 0.0005. Sum is 0.2505.

1/40 is 0.025. So 0.025 = 0.2505? No, that's impossible. So my approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the object is at the focal point. Because if do is f, then 1/f = 1/f + 1/di, which would give 1/di = 0. So di is infinite, which would mean the image is at infinity, which isn't the case here.

Wait, but the object is 4 cm, which is less than the focal length. So do would be less than f? No, wait, if the object is placed beyond the focal length (do > f), then the image is real and formed on the other side. If do < f, the image is virtual.

Wait, in our case, the object is 4 cm, and f is 40 cm. So do is 4 cm, which is less than f. So that's a virtual image. But wait, the image is formed on the screen, which is real. So perhaps I have the object distance wrong. Maybe the object is placed 40 cm away, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the object is 4 cm in size, and the object distance is 4 cm. But that leads to a negative di, which can't happen. So there's an inconsistency.

Wait, perhaps I should rederive the problem. Let me see.

The problem gives: object is 4.0 cm long (so perhaps the object's height is 4 cm), the object is placed 4.0 cm away from the lens, and the image is formed 20 m (2000 cm) from the lens.

Using the thin lens equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

Plugging in the numbers:

1/40 = 1/4 + 1/2000

Let me compute the right side.

1/4 is 0.25, 1/2000 is 0.0005. Sum is 0.2505.

But 1/40 is 0.025. So 0.025 = 0.2505 → which is impossible. So the equation isn't satisfied. That suggests that either the object distance is not 4 cm, or the image distance isn't 2000 cm.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the object is 4.0 cm in diameter, but the object is placed 4.0 cm away. So the object distance is 4.0 cm.

But that leads to a negative di, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm missing a key point here. Maybe the object is 4 cm in size and 4 cm in length. So object height is 4 cm, and it's placed 4 cm from the lens. So do is 4 cm.

But then, the image is formed 2000 cm from the lens. So di is 2000 cm.

So substituting in the thin lens equation:

1/40 = 1/4 + 1/2000.

Wait, 1/4 is 0.25, 1/2000 is 0.0005. Sum is 0.2505. 1/40 is 0.025, so not equal.

Hmm, that's a problem. So either I have the wrong object distance or image distance.

Alternative approach: Maybe the object is 4 cm in height, but the object is placed 40 cm away from the lens. So do =40 cm. Then using the thin lens equation:

1/40 = 1/40 + 1/di → So 1/di would be zero, which means di is infinite. But in that case, the image is at infinity, which is a real image (but not a real image). Wait, no. Wait, when do = f, it's a virtual image. Because if do > f, the image is real; if do = f, the image is virtual (infinite). But in this case, do is 40 cm, which is greater than f=40 cm. So do equals f, which would mean di is infinite (virtual image), but in the problem, the image is formed 2000 cm away, which is a real image. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the image distance differently. Let me think: perhaps the image is formed on a screen 20 m away, so di is 20 m (2000 cm) as given. So in that case, substituting into the thin lens equation, I should have a valid solution.

So 1/40 = 1/4 + 1/2000 → 1/40 = (500 + 2)/(40 * 2000) → Wait, maybe I should compute numerically.

Wait, 1/40 = 0.025. 1/4 is 0.25. 1/2000 is 0.0005. Sum is 0.2505. 0.2505 is not equal to 0.025. So the equation isn't valid. So either the image distance is wrong or the object distance is wrong.

Wait, but the image is formed 20 m from the lens. So di is 2000 cm. So that must be correct.

Hmm, maybe the object is placed 4 cm away from the lens, but the image is formed on the same side as the object, which is a virtual image. But the problem says the image is formed upon a screen, so it's a real image. So perhaps the object placement is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the object is placed at a different distance. Let me try substituting di as 2000 cm and solving for do.

So 1/f = 1/do + 1/di → 1/do = 1/f - 1/di.

Plugging in 1/40 = 1/do + 1/2000 → 1/do = (1/40) - (1/2000) → compute that.

1/40 is 0.025. 1/2000 is 0.0005. So 0.025 - 0.0005 = 0.0245. So 1/do = 0.0245 → do ≈ 40.909 cm (approximately 40.91 cm).

Wait, so if do is approximately 40.91 cm, that's more than f (40 cm), which would mean the image is real. Because for a converging lens, if do > f, the image is real and inverted, but on the opposite side. Wait, no. No, wait, when do > f, you get a real image on the opposite side. So in this case, do is 40.91 cm (just a bit more than 40 cm), so the image is real.

But the problem states that the object is 4.0 cm in length. So let's think: if the object is 4 cm in length, and the object distance is about 40.91 cm, then the image distance is 2000 cm.

Wait, but what's the image's size?

Wait, the image's height can be found using the magnification formula: m = di/do = height of image / height of object.

So m = di/do → m = 2000 cm / 40.909 cm ≈ 49. So the image is 49 times the size of the object. Since the object is 4 cm in height, the image is about 196 cm (4 * 49). But looking at the options, H is 250 cm, G is 150, D is 180, F is 175, E is 196. So E is 196 cm, which is option E.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. So when I set di =2000, and solve for do, I get do ≈40.91 cm.

Then, the magnification is di/do = 2000 /40.91 ≈49. So height of image is 4 cm *49 → 196 cm.

So the image is 196 cm high. Now, looking at the options, option E is 196 cm. So that's the answer.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use the thin lens equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

where \( f = 40 \, \text{cm} \), \( d_o \) is the object distance, and \( d_i = 2000 \, \text{cm} \). Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{40} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{2000}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( d_o \):

\[
\frac{1}{d_o} = \frac{1}{40} - \frac{1}{2000}
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{40} = 0.025 \) and \( \frac{1}{2000} = 0.0005 \). Subtracting these:

\[
\frac{1}{d_o} = 0.025 - 0.0005 = 0.0245
\]

Thus:

\[
d_o = \frac{1}{0.0245} \approx 40.91 \, \text{cm}
\]

Next, use the magnification formula to find the height of the image:

\[
m = \frac{d_i}{d_o} = \frac{2000}{40.91} \approx 49
\]

The height of the image is:

\[
h_i = m \cdot h_o = 49 \cdot 4 = 196 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the size of the image is \( 196 \, \text{cm} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
