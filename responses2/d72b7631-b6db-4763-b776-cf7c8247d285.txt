Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about utilitarianism. The question is asking what Ross claims is the essential defect of utilitarianism, and the options are from A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that utilitarianism is a theory in ethics that prioritizes the greatest good for the greatest number. The key idea is that the right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or well-being. But there are some problems or defects in this approach.

Option A says the significance of moral intentions. Hmm, I think about what I've learned. Moral intentions are about what you intend to do, like your values. Utilitarianism focuses on outcomes, not intentions. So, this might be a defect because it ignores the importance of what you actually want to do.

Option B: epistemological responsibility. Wait, epistemology is about knowledge and belief. Utilitarianism is usually about outcomes, not the process of getting there. So this seems like it's a different concern, not a defect of utilitarianism.

Option C: the role of virtue in morality. Virtue refers to character, conduct, etc. I remember that utilitarianism doesn't focus on character but on outcomes. So ignoring virtue would be a defect, but I think this is a separate issue from just ignoring intentions.

Option D: the value of pleasure. Hmm, I'm not sure. Utilitarianism does value pleasure, but I think this is more about how we perceive it rather than a defect. It's more about the end state than the process.

Option E: the importance of individual rights. Rights relate to the rights of others, which are about the rules and duties, not the outcomes. So individual rights might not be a defect of utilitarianism.

Option F: the potential consequences of actions. Consequences are about the outcomes, so this might be about outcomes rather than a defect in utilitarianism, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's more about the outcomes than the approach.

Option G: the concept of justice. Again, justice relates to the principle of fairness, which is a different aspect. Utilitarianism's defect might be more about the focus on outcome without considering the process or character.

Option H: moral obligations. Moral obligations are about what one must do, which is part of the process. But I think that's more about duties, not a defect in the theory itself.

Option I: the personal character of duty. This seems related to H, but specifically about personal character. If someone's duties aren't considered in utilitarian terms, that's a defect.

Option J: autonomy. Autonomy is about personal choice, which is a concern in certain ethical theories but not a fundamental defect of utilitarianism, I think.

So, going back to the question: Ross claims the essential defect is about ignoring something. A is about moral intentions, which I think is a key issue because utilitarianism focuses on outcomes, not the intentions that lead to them.

Also, I remember that one of the main defects of utilitarianism is that it doesn't prioritize the consequences of actions. It's more about net benefit than about the process. But wait, that's more about the consequences' net value, not the individual intentions.

Wait, another point: Utilitarianism's focus is on the overall good, so it ignores the importance of individual decisions beyond their outcomes. So if someone makes a wrong decision, the outcome might be bad, but the person prioritizes the whole. So the defect might be that it doesn't consider the intentions or the process, but I think that's not exactly an option.

Looking again at the options, the question is about what Ross claims is the essential defect. So if Ross is saying that utilitarianism ignores something, the most likely is the significance of moral intentions because that's a key aspect of how people make decisions.

So the answer should be A.

The essential defect of utilitarianism, as Ross claims, is that it ignores the significance of moral intentions. This is because utilitarianism focuses on the outcomes of actions rather than the intentions behind them. 

Answer: A
