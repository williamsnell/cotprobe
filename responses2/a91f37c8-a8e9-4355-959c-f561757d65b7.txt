Alright, so I've got this question here about how many cups of coffee people in the US drank last week in 2013. The options are A to J, each with different numbers ranging from 5 billion down to 1 billion cups per week. 

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about this number, but I know that coffee consumption in the US has been increasing, especially with the rise in awareness about caffeine and its effects. I think the number of cups per week has been growing over the years. Maybe it's in the hundreds of millions or billions.

Wait, I remember hearing that in the 2000s, the average American consumed around 2-3 cups of coffee a day. So if that's the case, then over a week, that would be about 14-21 cups. But wait, that's per person, right? So the total consumption would depend on how many people are in the US. The US population is around 313 million in 2013.

So if each person drinks an average of 15 cups a week, then 313 million people multiplied by 15 cups equals... let me do the math. 313 million times 10 is 3.13 billion, plus 313 million times 5, which is about 1.565 billion. So total would be around 4.695 billion cups per week. That's roughly 4.7 billion cups.

Looking back at the options, option H is 4 billion cups per week. So that's probably the right answer. But wait, I'm not 100% sure because I might have heard different numbers. Also, I'm not certain if the average per person is 15 cups or higher. Maybe it's higher. Let me think again. Coffee is a powerful drink, so maybe the average is higher, like 20 cups a week. Then 313 million times 20 is 6.26 billion cups. That's option J. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the trend. In 2013, the coffee consumption per capita was around 2-3 cups a day. Let's say 2.5 cups a day. Over a week, that's 17.5 cups. Multiply by 313 million people: 313 *17.5 is about 5,477.5 million cups, which is approximately 5.477 billion cups per week. So that's about 5.48 billion cups, which is close to option E, which is 6 billion. Wait, but 313 *17.5 is approximately 5,477 million, which is about 5.477 billion. So that's more than 5 billion but less than 6 billion.

Wait, so 313 million people times 17.5 cups a week is 5,477.5 million cups, which is 5,477.5 million cups per week. So that's approximately 5.48 billion cups per week, which is closer to option E (6 billion) than option J (300 million). So option E is 6 billion, which is higher, while option J is 300 million.

But wait, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. If it's 2.5 cups a day, 2.5 *7=17.5 cups a week. 313 million *17.5 =5,477.5 million cups, which is 5,477.5 million cups. So 5.4775 billion. So that's about 5.48 billion cups, which is approximately 5.5 billion. So that's more than 5 billion but less than 6 billion. So the closest option would be E (6 billion) or F (300 million) or maybe none. But looking back at the options, the choices are A to J, with E being 6 billion and J being 300 million. So 5.48 billion isn't exactly any of the options except E is 6, which is higher.

Wait, but the options include E: 6 billion cups per week, which is the closest to my calculation. So I think the correct answer is E.

The correct answer is E: 6 billion cups per week.
