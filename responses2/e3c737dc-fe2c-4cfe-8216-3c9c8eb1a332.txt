Question:

To place the first paving stone in a path, Alex starts at the crate of stones, walks three feet, places the stone, and returns to the crate. For each subsequent stone, Alex walks two feet farther each way. Alex will place the first 50 stones in a path. After returning to the crate from placing the $50^\text{th}$ stone, what is the total distance Alex walked, in feet?

Options:

A: 4950
B: 50
C: 90950
D: 7500
E: 100
F: 150
G: 10000
H: 5200
I: 2500
J: 5050

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Alex walking to place paving stones, and I need to figure out the total distance he walked after placing 50 stones. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that Alex starts at a crate of stones. For the first stone, he walks three feet, places it, and then returns to the crate. So that's a round trip. Then, for each subsequent stone, he walks two feet farther each way. So, each stone after that requires a longer round trip than the previous one.

Wait, let me make sure I understand correctly. The first time, he goes three feet each way, so that's 3 + 3 = 6 feet total. Then, for the second stone, he walks two feet farther each way. Wait, does that mean each way is two feet longer? So, each round trip becomes 5 feet each way, totaling 10 feet? Or does it mean that the total increase per stone is two feet? Maybe I need to think about how the distance increases each time.

Wait, the problem says "walks two feet farther each way." So, each way, the distance increases by two feet. So, for the first stone, each way is 3 feet, so round trip is 6 feet. For the second stone, each way is 3 + 2 = 5 feet, so round trip is 10 feet. Third stone, each way is 5 + 2 = 7 feet, round trip 14 feet, and so on.

Wait, that makes sense. So each round trip increases by 4 feet each time because each way increases by 2 feet, so 2+2=4. So the first stone is 6 feet, second 10, third 14, fourth 18, etc.

So, the pattern is that each round trip is 4 feet longer than the previous one. So the sequence is 6, 10, 14, 18, ..., up to the 50th stone.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "for each subsequent stone, Alex walks two feet farther each way." So each round trip is two feet longer than the previous. So each stone's round trip is 2 feet more than the previous's. So the first round trip is 6, second 8? Wait, wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, let me re-express the problem. The first time, he walks three feet each way, so 3+3 = 6 feet total. Then, for each subsequent stone, he walks two feet farther each way. So each way is two feet longer than the previous. So the second stone's each way is 3+2=5 feet, so round trip is 10 feet. Third stone, each way is 5+2=7, round trip 14, and so on.

So the round trip distances for each stone are:

Stone 1: 3*2 = 6 feet.

Stone 2: (3+2)*2 = 10 feet.

Stone 3: (5+2)*2 = 14 feet.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Each subsequent stone requires two feet farther each way than the previous. So, for the first stone, each way is 3 feet, so round trip is 6 feet. For the second stone, each way is 3+2=5 feet, so round trip is 10 feet. Third stone, each way is 5+2=7, so round trip is 14. So each stone's round trip is 4 feet longer than the previous. So the pattern is 6, 10, 14, 18, ..., and so on.

Wait, wait. Let's see: Stone 1: 6, Stone 2:10, Stone 3:14, yeah, so each stone adds 4 feet to the round trip. So, the sequence is an arithmetic progression where the first term is 6 and the common difference is 4.

Wait, but wait, let me check: Is the round trip for stone n equal to (3 + 2*(n-1)) * 2? Let's see. For n=1: (3+0)*2=6. For n=2: (3+2)*2=10. n=3: (3+4)*2=14. Yep, that works. So the general term is a_n = 2*(3 + 2*(n-1)) = 2*(3 + 2n - 2) = 2*(2n +1) =4n + 2. So for stone n, the round trip is (4n + 2) feet.

Wait, but wait, that would mean for stone 1: 4*1 +2 =6, correct. Stone 2:4*2+2=10, correct. Stone 3:4*3+2=14, correct. So yes, the round trip for the nth stone is (4n + 2) feet.

Wait, but for the problem, Alex places the first 50 stones. So he does 50 round trips, each of which is (4n +2) feet for n from 1 to 50. So the total distance is the sum of these 50 terms.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "After returning to the crate from placing the 50th stone, what is the total distance Alex walked?" So does that include returning each time? So each round trip is a return, so yes, each round trip is both going and returning.

So total distance is sum of all 50 round trips.

So the sum S = sum_{n=1 to 50} (4n + 2) = sum (4n) + sum (2) = 4*sum(n) + 2*50.

Sum(n) from 1 to 50 is (50*51)/2 = 1275.

So 4*1275 = 5100. Then 2*50 =100. So total sum is 5100 +100=5200 feet.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term). The first term a1=6, the last term a50=4*50+2=202. So sum is (50/2)*(6 +202)=25*208=5200. Yep, same result.

Wait, so the answer is 5200 feet. Looking at the options, option H is 5200. So the correct answer should be H.

The problem involves Alex placing 50 paving stones, each requiring a round trip that increases by 4 feet each time. The total distance is the sum of these trips.

- **Step 1:** Each round trip follows an arithmetic sequence with the first term (a1) as 6 feet and common difference (d) as 4 feet.
- **Step 2:** The nth term of the sequence is a_n = 4n + 2.
- **Step 3:** The sum of the first 50 terms is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
  - Sum = (n/2) * (2a1 + (n-1)d)
  - Sum = (50/2) * (12 + 4*49) = 25 * (12 + 196) = 25 * 208 = 5200.

**Answer: H: 5200**
