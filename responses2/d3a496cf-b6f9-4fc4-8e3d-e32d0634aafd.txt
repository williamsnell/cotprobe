Okay, so I've got this problem here about Lebesgue measure. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem is about finding the Lebesgue measure of a set E, which is defined as all points (x, y) in the unit square I = [0,1]x[0,1] such that sin(x) < 1/2 and cos(x+y) is irrational. The options are given, but I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should probably understand what the set E looks like. The set E is the set of points where two conditions are satisfied: sin(x) is less than 1/2, and cos(x + y) is irrational. 

Let me break this down into two parts: the condition on x and the condition on y. 

So, the condition sin(x) < 1/2. That's a standard trigonometric inequality. The sine function is less than 1/2 in certain intervals of x. Let me recall that sin(x) = 1/2 at x = π/6 (30 degrees) and 5π/6 (150 degrees) within the interval [0, 2π]. But since x is in [0,1], which is approximately [0, 3.1416], the relevant solutions would be in the first and second quadrants.

Wait, wait. Wait, x is between 0 and 1. Since π is about 3.1416, π/6 is about 0.5236, and 5π/6 is about 2.61799. So, for x in [0,0.5236), sin(x) is less than 1/2. And for x in (2.61799, 3.1416), sin(x) would again be less than 1/2 because sin(π) is 0, sin(3π/2) is -1, but we're considering x in [0,1], so maybe only up to 0.5236.

Wait, let me think again. The sine of x is less than 1/2 in the intervals where x is between 0 and π/6, and between 5π/6 and 2π. But since x is in [0,1], which is a subset of [0, 2π], the relevant intervals are [0, π/6] and [5π/6, π]. Wait, no, because 5π/6 is approximately 2.61799, which is less than 1? No, 1 is about 0.318, and 2.61799 is way bigger. Wait, no, x is between 0 and 1, so 5π/6 is about 2.61799, which is way larger than 1. So, in [0,1], the sine of x is less than 1/2 everywhere except in the interval [5π/6, π], but since 5π/6 is about 2.617, which is way bigger than 1, that interval doesn't exist in [0,1]. So within [0,1], the only interval where sin(x) < 1/2 is [0, π/6) ≈ [0, 0.523598776]. So the measure (length) of this interval is π/6, which is approximately 0.523598776.

Wait, but wait, sin(x) is less than 1/2 in two intervals in [0, 2π], but only the first one [0, π/6) is within [0,1]. So the length where sin(x) < 1/2 is π/6. So the set of x's satisfying sin(x) < 1/2 is [0, π/6), which has length π/6 ≈ 0.523598776.

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check. If x is in [0, π/6), then sin(x) goes from 0 to 1/2, so yes, sin(x) is less than 1/2. But what about x beyond π/6? For x in [π/6, 5π/6), sin(x) goes from 1/2 down to -1/2, so that's where sin(x) is less than 1/2 as well, but in the negative. But in [0,1], 5π/6 is about 2.617, which is beyond 1, so in [0,1], sin(x) is less than 1/2 only in [0, π/6].

So the measure of x is π/6.

Now, the second condition is that cos(x + y) is irrational. Hmm, so for each (x,y), cos(x+y) must be irrational. So, for E, the set is the product of the set of x where sin(x) <1/2 and the set of y where for each x in that set, cos(x+y) is irrational.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a subset of the unit square. So, the conditions are on x and y, but the condition on x is a function of x, and on y, it's a function of x+y.

Wait, so let's think: for a given x, what is the set of y's such that cos(x+y) is irrational.

So, for each x, cos(x+y) is irrational. Let's think about the measure of y such that cos(x + y) is irrational.

But wait, if x is fixed, then for cos(x + y), for a given x, y can vary from 0 to 1. So, the condition is that cos(x + y) is not in the set of rational numbers.

Wait, but the set of y's where cos(x + y) is rational is countable, since for each rational value q, the equation cos(x+y)=q has either no solution or a solution in y. So, for each x, the set of y where cos(x+y) is rational is a countable set, hence has measure zero.

Therefore, for each x, the set of y's where cos(x+y) is irrational has measure 1.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the measure of the set where cos(x + y) is irrational is 1, because the set where it's rational is measure zero.

Wait, for each fixed x, the set of y where cos(x + y) is irrational is a full measure set (measure 1) in y. Because the set where it's rational is a countable set, which has measure zero. So, for each x, the measure of y satisfying the condition is 1.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. The condition is that cos(x + y) is irrational. So, for each x, the set of y where cos(x + y) is irrational is all y except a countable set. So the measure is indeed 1, because the irrationals are dense and uncountable, but the exceptions are just a countable number of points, so the measure is 1.

So, for each x, the y's that satisfy the condition is the entire interval [0,1], except possibly the points where cos(x + y) is rational, which is a countable set. So, the measure is 1.

Wait, but that would mean that for each x, the measure of y satisfying the second condition is 1. But that can't be right, because if that's the case, then the set E would be the entire set of x where sin(x) < 1/2, which is [0, π/6), and y is all in [0,1], so E would have measure π/6 * 1 = π/6 ≈ 0.523598776. But that's option H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, wait. Because for each x in [0, π/6), y can be anything, because the condition on y is automatically satisfied except for a countable set. So, the measure of E is the measure of x (which is π/6) multiplied by 1 (since for each x, the measure of y is 1, as y can be anything except a measure zero set). So, the total measure is π/6 ≈ 0.523598776.

But let me check if this is correct because I might be making a mistake here.

Wait, but I'm getting 0.523598776, which is option H. But let me look at the options again.

Wait, the options are: A: 0.785..., B: 1.047..., C:1.884..., D:0.628..., E:0.261..., F:2.094..., G:1.570..., H:0.523..., I:0.392..., J:1.308...

So, option H is 0.523598776, which is π/6, as I thought. So, that would be the measure of E.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem is E is the set where sin(x) < 1/2 and cos(x+y) is irrational. So, I think I'm correct so far, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again: because for each x in [0, π/6), the condition on y is cos(x+y) is irrational. So, for each x, the y's that satisfy this are [0,1] except a countable set, which has measure zero. So, the measure of y is 1. Therefore, for each x in [0, π/6), the measure of y is 1. So, the total measure is the length of x's multiplied by 1, which is π/6 ≈ 0.523598776. 

So, that's option H. But let me check if this is correct because I might be making a mistake in the way I'm considering the sets.

Wait, perhaps I should model the set E as the product of the set of x where sin(x) < 1/2 and the set of y such that for each x in that set, cos(x + y) is irrational. But for each x, the set of y is [0,1] except for a countable number of points, so the measure is 1. So, the product measure would be the measure of x times 1, which is the measure of x, which is π/6.

But is that correct? Or am I missing a more precise consideration of the conditions?

Wait, perhaps I should think of this as a product of two conditions. The first condition is sin(x) < 1/2, which is a set of measure π/6. The second condition is that cos(x + y) is irrational. For the second condition, since cos(x + y) is a function of x + y, perhaps I should consider the set of (x, y) where x + y is such that cos(x + y) is irrational.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a subset of the unit square with certain properties.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the measure can be considered as the integral over x of the measure of y such that cos(x + y) is irrational, given x.

So, the measure is ∫_{x ∈ [0,1]} [measure of y ∈ [0,1] such that cos(x + y) is irrational} dx.

As I thought earlier, for each x, the measure is 1, because the set of y where cos(x + y) is rational is countable, hence measure zero. So, the integral becomes ∫_{x ∈ [0, π/6)} 1 dx = π/6 ≈ 0.523598776.

So, this suggests that the measure is π/6, which is option H.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that sometimes when dealing with trigonometric conditions, especially involving both x and y, the measure can be more involved. But in this case, since for each x, the measure of y is 1, the total measure is just the length of x's.

Wait, let me think of it another way. The set E is the set of (x, y) where sin(x) < 1/2, and cos(x + y) is irrational. So, E can be written as the intersection of two sets: A = { (x, y) | sin(x) < 1/2 } and B = { (x, y) | cos(x + y) is irrational }.

The measure of E is the measure of A intersect B. So, the measure of A is π/6. Now, the measure of B is 1, because for each x, the measure of y is 1. But wait, the intersection might not be as straightforward.

Wait, but B is the set where cos(x + y) is irrational. So, for each x, the condition on y is that cos(x + y) is not in Q (the rationals). So, the set where cos(x+y) is rational is a countable set in y, hence measure zero. So, for each x, the measure of y where cos(x + y) is irrational is 1.

Therefore, the intersection of A and B is A, because for each x in A, the y's in B are almost all y in [0,1], except a measure zero set. So, the measure of E is the same as the measure of A, which is π/6.

So, that would make the measure of E as π/6. Looking back at the options, that's option H.

But wait, another way to think about it: perhaps considering the entire unit square, the set where cos(x + y) is irrational might have some properties, but integrating over x would have the measure of E as the length of x's where sin(x) < 1/2, multiplied by 1, since for each x in that region, the measure of y is 1.

So, I think option H is the correct answer.

To determine the Lebesgue measure of the set \( E = \{(x, y) \in I : \sin(x) < \frac{1}{2}, \cos(x+y) \text{ is irrational}\} \), we analyze the conditions:

1. **Condition on \( x \):**  
   The inequality \( \sin(x) < \frac{1}{2} \) holds for \( x \in [0, \frac{\pi}{6}) \), which has a length of \( \frac{\pi}{6} \approx 0.5236 \).

2. **Condition on \( y \):**  
   For each fixed \( x \) in \( [0, \frac{\pi}{6}) \), \( \cos(x + y) \) is irrational for almost all \( y \in [0, 1] \). Specifically, the set of \( y \) where \( \cos(x + y) \) is rational is countable and thus has measure zero. Therefore, the measure of \( y \) satisfying the condition is \( 1 \).

3. **Measure of \( E \):**  
   The set \( E \) is the product of the set of \( x \) satisfying \( \sin(x) < \frac{1}{2} \) and the set of \( y \) satisfying \( \cos(x + y) \) is irrational. Since the measure of \( x \) is \( \frac{\pi}{6} \) and the measure of \( y \) is \( 1 \), the total measure of \( E \) is \( \frac{\pi}{6} \).

Thus, the Lebesgue measure of \( E \) is \( \frac{\pi}{6} \), which corresponds to option **H**.
