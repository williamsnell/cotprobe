Question:

Your firm is trying to decide whether to buy an e-commerce software company. The company has $100,000 in total capital assets: $60,000 in equity and $40,000 in debt. The cost of the companyâ€™s equity is 10%, while the cost of the company's debt is 5%. The corporate tax rate is 21%. What is the WACC of the company?

Options:

A: 0.0845
B: 0.0800
C: 0.0823
D: 0.0891
E: 0.0758
F: 0.0674
G: 0.0652
H: 0.0700
I: 0.0921
J: 0.0789

Okay, so I need to find the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) for this company. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my finance class. WACC is a calculation that determines a company's average cost of capital, right? It's used to evaluate the cost of financing a project or investment.

The formula for WACC is (E/V * Re) + (D/V * Rd * (1 - Tc)), where E is the market value of the company's equity, V is the total value of the firm (equity plus debt), D is the market value of debt, Re is the cost of equity, Rd is the cost of debt, and Tc is the corporate tax rate.

Wait, but in the given problem, they've given the total capital assets, but I don't think that directly affects the WACC calculation. Since WACC is based on the proportion of equity and debt, I think the total capital is given as $100,000. But wait, the formula might require the proportion of each component relative to the total capital. Oh right, because E is $60,000 and D is $40,000, so total capital is E+D=100,000.

So first, I'll compute the weights. The weight of equity is E/V, which is 60,000 / 100,000 = 0.6. The weight of debt is D/V = 40,000 / 100,000 = 0.4.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, since V is the total value, which is $100k, then E is 60k, D is 40k. So V is 100k.

So WACC = (E/V * Re) + (D/V * Rd * (1 - Tc)).

Plugging in the numbers:

Re is 10% (0.10), Rd is 5% (0.05), Tc is 21% (0.21).

So first term: (0.6 * 0.10) = 0.06.

Second term: (0.4 * 0.05) * (1 - 0.21) = (0.02) * 0.79 = 0.0158.

Adding both terms: 0.06 + 0.0158 = 0.0758.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 0.0758. So that's the WACC. But wait, wait a second. Did I get the formula right? Oh yeah, because WACC is the weighted average of the cost of each component adjusted by its proportion in the firm. Oh right, the formula seems correct.

So the answer should be E) 0.0758. Looking at the options, E is 0.0758, so that's one of the choices. So the correct option is E.

To determine the WACC, we calculate the weighted average cost of capital using the formula:

\[
WACC = \left(\frac{E}{V} \times Re\right) + \left(\frac{D}{V} \times Rd \times (1 - Tc)\right)
\]

Where:
- \(E = \$60,000\) (Equity),
- \(V = \$100,000\) (Total Capital),
- \(D = \$40,000\) (Debt),
- \(Re = 10\% = 0.10\),
- \(Rd = 5\% = 0.05\),
- \(Tc = 21\% = 0.21\).

Compute the weights:
- \( \frac{E}{V} = 0.6 \),
- \( \frac{D}{V} = 0.4 \).

Plug into the formula:
\[
WACC = (0.6 \times 0.10) + (0.4 \times 0.05 \times (1 - 0.21)) = 0.06 + 0.0158 = 0.0758
\]

The WACC is \(0.0758\), which corresponds to option E.
