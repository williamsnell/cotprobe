Okay, so I've got this problem here about an investment that grows at 320 times e raised to the power of (0.08t) dollars per year. I need to find its value after 10 years. The options are A through J, and I have to pick the right one. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the function given is the rate of growth, right? So the value of the investment over time isn't directly given, but the rate at which it's increasing is. I remember that if you have a function that describes the rate of change of something, you can find the original function by integrating it. Oh right, because the derivative of the value function gives the rate.

So the rate is 320*e^(0.08t) dollars per year. That means the rate at time t is dV/dt = 320 e^(0.08t). To find the value V(t) at any time t, I need to integrate this function with respect to t.

Let me write that out. V(t) = ∫ 320 e^(0.08t) dt + C, where C is the constant of integration. Since this is an indefinite integral, it's better to find the definite integral from t=0 to t=T, where T is the time, in this case, 10 years.

The integral of e^(kt) dt is (1/k) e^(kt) + C. So applying that here, the integral of e^(0.08t) is (1/0.08) e^(0.08t). Multiply that by 320, so 320*(1/0.08) e^(0.08t) + C.

Calculating the coefficient: 320 divided by 0.08. Let's see, 0.08 is 8/100, so 320 * (100/8) = 320*12.5 = 4000. So, V(t) = 4000 e^(0.08t) + C.

Wait, but I think I missed the integration constant. Wait, wait. Let me do that again. The integral of e^(kt) is (1/k) e^(kt). So ∫320 e^(0.08t) dt = 320 * (1/0.08) e^(0.08t) + C → 4000 e^(0.08t) + C. But wait, when t=0, V(0) should be the initial investment, which is $4000. Because the problem says the investment is $4000.

Wait, V(0) = 4000 e^(0) + C → 4000*(1) + C = 4000 + C. But V(0) is $4000, so 4000 = 4000 + C → C=0. Oh, right! So the equation simplifies to V(t) = 4000 e^(0.08t).

Wait, that's interesting. So the value of the investment at any time t is 4000 multiplied by e raised to 0.08t.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check that again. Because the problem statement says the rate is 320*e^(0.08t) dollars per year. So dV/dt = 320 e^(0.08t). So integrating that gives V(t) = 320/(0.08) e^(0.08t) + C → 4000 e^(0.08t) + C. 

To find the constant C, we plug in t=0. At t=0, V(0) should be $4000 (the initial investment). So:

V(0) = 4000 e^(0) + C → 4000*1 + C → 4000 + C = 4000 → C=0.

So V(t) = 4000 e^(0.08t). That's correct.

So after 10 years, t=10. So V(10) = 4000 e^(0.08 * 10) → 4000 e^0.8.

Now I need to compute e^0.8. Let me think about the value of e^0.8. I remember that e^0.7 ≈ 2.01375, and e^0.8 is a bit higher. Alternatively, I can use the Taylor series expansion or remember that e^0.8 is approximately 2.2255 (I think). Wait, wait, let me double-check.

Alternatively, I can compute it using logarithms or a calculator. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I can approximate it.

Wait, e^0.8 is approximately 2.2255, right? Because e^0.6931 is 2, e^0.7 is about 2.0138, and e^0.8 is a little more. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Another approach: we can use the approximation e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6.

So for x=0.8:

e^0.8 ≈ 1 + 0.8 + (0.8^2)/2 + (0.8^3)/6.

Calculating each term:

0.8^2 = 0.64 → 0.64/2 = 0.32.

0.8^3 = 0.512 → 0.512/6 ≈ 0.085333.

Adding them up: 1 + 0.8 = 1.8; 1.8 + 0.32 = 2.12; 2.12 + 0.085333 ≈ 2.2053.

But wait, that's a rough approximation, and the actual value is higher than that. Let me check more accurately.

Alternatively, I can remember that e^0.7 ≈ 2.01375, e^0.8 is about 2.2255.

So V(10) = 4000 * 2.2255 ≈ 4000 * 2.2255.

Let me compute that: 4000 * 2 = 8000, 4000 * 0.2255 = 4000 * 0.2 is 800, 4000 * 0.0255 is 102. So 800 + 102 = 902. So total is 8,000 + 902 = 8,902.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 4000 * 2.2255. 2.2255 * 4000 = 4000 * 2 + 4000 * 0.2255.

2 * 4000 = 8000.

0.2255 *4000 = 0.2 *4000 =800, 0.0255 *4000=102 → 800 +102=902. So total is 8000 +902 =8902.

Wait, that's 8,902. Let me look at the options. Option E is $8,902. But wait, another option is G: $4,902, which is close to my calculation, but maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine the V(t) function. I thought V(t) = 4000 e^0.08t. So after 10 years, it's 4000 e^(0.8) ≈ 4000 *2.2255 =8902, which is option E.

But wait, looking back at the options, E is 8,902, which is exactly what I got. So why am I confused then? Because the options include 8,902 as E, but I thought maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, but let me make sure. The rate is 320 e^(0.08t). So dV/dt is 320 e^(0.08t). Integrating that gives V(t) = (320 /0.08) e^(0.08t) + C =4000 e^(0.08t) + C.

At t=0, V(0) =4000 =4000 e^0 + C → 4000=4000 +C → C=0. So yes, V(t)=4000 e^(0.08t).

So V(10) =4000 e^(0.8) ≈8,902, which is option E.

Wait, but I initially thought maybe the answer was 4,902, but that's option G, which is half of that. Wait, perhaps I should double-check my integration. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement is different. Wait, the problem says the investment grows at the rate of 320 e^(0.08t) dollars per year. So dV/dt = 320 e^(0.08t). That's correct. So integrating that gives V(t) = 4000 e^(0.08t) + C.

At t=0, V(0)=4000, so C is zero. So yes, V(10)=4000 e^(0.8) ≈8,902. So option E is correct.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused because option E is 8,902, which is what I got. So why did I think initially about option G? Oh, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again:

Options:

A:6,300

B:10,022

C:12,902

D:7,122

E:8,902

F:5,902

G:4,902

H:10,902

I:9,500

J:11,200

So yes, option E is 8,902, which matches my calculation. So the correct answer would be E.

The investment's value after 10 years is calculated by integrating the growth rate. The rate is given as \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 320e^{0.08t} \). Integrating this gives \( V(t) = 4000e^{0.08t} \). At \( t = 10 \), \( V(10) = 4000e^{0.8} \approx 8902 \), which corresponds to option E.
