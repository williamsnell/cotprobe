Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here, and I need to find the derivative of the inverse function at a certain point. Let's see... The problem states that g(x) is the inverse of f(x) = x + cos(x), and I need to find g'(1). Hmm, right. 

I remember that if g is the inverse of f, then f(g(x)) = x and g(f(x)) = x. Also, the derivative of the inverse function, g', at a point can be found using the formula: g'(f(x)) = 1 / f'(x). So, to find g'(1), I need to find the value of x such that f(x) = 1, and then compute 1 divided by the derivative of f at that x.

Wait, let's break it down. First, find x where f(x) = x + cos(x) equals 1. So, x + cos(x) = 1. I'm not sure how to solve this algebraically, but maybe I can guess a value. Let's try x=0. Then f(0) = 0 + cos(0) = 0 + 1 = 1. Oh, that's exactly what I need. So when x=0, f(x) =1. Therefore, g(1) = 0 because g is the inverse function.

So now, to find g'(1), I use the formula. It's 1 divided by f'(x) evaluated at x=0. What's f'(x)? Let's compute that. f(x) = x + cos(x), so f'(x) = 1 - sin(x). Right, derivative of x is 1, derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x).

So f'(0) = 1 - sin(0) = 1 - 0 = 1. Therefore, g'(1) = 1 / f'(0) = 1/1 = 1. So the answer is 1, which is option C.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through it again. First, f(x) is x + cos(x). Its inverse is g(x), so f(g(x)) = x and g(f(x)) = x. To find g'(1), we use the inverse function theorem: g'(y) = 1/f'(g(y)). Here, y = 1, so g(y) = g(1) = 0. Then f'(g(1)) = f'(0) = 1 - sin(0) = 1. So 1 over 1 is 1. Yep, that's correct.

To determine \( g'(1) \), where \( g \) is the inverse of \( f(x) = x + \cos(x) \), we use the inverse function theorem. 

1. **Find \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 1 \):**  
   \( f(x) = x + \cos(x) = 1 \). Testing \( x = 0 \):  
   \( 0 + \cos(0) = 0 + 1 = 1 \). Thus, \( f(0) = 1 \) implies \( g(1) = 0 \).

2. **Compute \( f'(x) \):**  
   \( f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x + \cos(x)) = 1 - \sin(x) \).

3. **Evaluate \( f'(x) \) at \( x = 0 \):**  
   \( f'(0) = 1 - \sin(0) = 1 - 0 = 1 \).

4. **Apply the inverse function theorem:**  
   \( g'(1) = \frac{1}{f'(g(1))} = \frac{1}{f'(0)} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 \).

Thus, the answer is **C: 1**.
