Question:

Billy was charged with grand theft. The trial began on a Thursday afternoon. The jury was empaneled, sworn and released for the day. Since Friday was the Fourth of July, the judge asked the jurors to return on Monday. The trial began again on Monday morning at 8:30. By late evening the judge had instructed the jury. Due to the lateness of the hour, the jurors were sequestered for the evening to allow them to get an early start the next morning. The jurors returned Tuesday morning and were unable to reach a verdict. Unable to reach a verdict, the trial judge allowed the jurors to go home that evening. On Wednesday morning, the jury assembled and returned a verdict of guilty. On appeal, which of the following is Billy's strongest issue for seeking a reversal?

Options:

A: The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after being sworn.
B: The fact that the jurors did not begin to consider evidence until several days after they were empaneled.
C: The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after they began deliberations.
D: The fact that the trial began on a holiday weekend.
E: The fact that the jury was not given enough time to deliberate.
F: The fact that the jury was sequestered for only one night.
G: The fact that the jury took several days to return a verdict.
H: The fact that the jury returned a verdict of guilty.
I: The fact that the jury did not start deliberating until the following week.
J: The fact that the trial began late in the afternoon.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out Billy's strongest issue for a reversal of his judgment. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

Billy was charged with grand theft. The trial began on a Thursday afternoon. The jury was empaneled, sworn, and released for the day. Wait, the problem says it was Thursday afternoon and the jury was released for the day. So that suggests they were released on Thursday evening, right? Then, Friday was the Fourth of July, which is the 4th. So the judge asked them to return on Monday. But the jury wasn't returned that day. Then the trial restarted on Monday morning at 8:30. By late evening, the judge had instructed them to go home. The jurors returned Tuesday morning and couldn't make a verdict. They went home that evening. On Wednesday morning, they returned a guilty verdict. On appeal, Billy's strongest issue is which fact causes a reversal.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about each option.

Option A: The jury was allowed to go home after being sworn. Wait, the jury was sworn and released for the day. So they were sworn on Thursday, released on Thursday evening. Then they were asked to return on Monday. So they weren't returned until Monday. So A seems incorrect because they were not returned after being sworn.

Option B: They didn't begin deliberations until several days after they were empaneled. The empaneled part refers to being enqueued, but in the trial, the enqueued must be on the same day. The jury was enqueued on Thursday, released on Thursday, then asked to return on Monday. So they were enqueued, but not returned until Monday, which is several days later. So B says they didn't begin deliberating until several days after enqueued. That seems right because they were enqueued on Thursday but didn't return until Monday.

Option C: They were allowed to go home after deliberations. Well, the judge had to inform them to go home before deliberations. So if they were allowed to go home after deliberations, that might be a problem. But the question says the judge instructed them to go home because of lateness, so I'm not sure if that's the issue here.

Option D: The trial began on a holiday weekend. The trial began on Thursday afternoon, which was a Thursday, but the holiday weekend would be around the Fourth of July, which is Friday. So the trial was on the same day as the Fourth, so it's not a weekend. So D doesn't seem correct.

Option E: They were not given enough time to deliberate. The problem doesn't mention the time between enqueued and returned. But Billy's case is about a reversal, so maybe the issue is that they didn't have enough time to deliberate. But I'm not sure if the absence of a verdict was due to the time gap. The fact that they were sequestered for only one night might not be enough time, but without knowing the exact timeline, it's hard to say. The question is about the strongest issue.

Option F: They were sequestered for only one night. That's a short time. If the trial needed at least a couple of days to proceed, then that might be a problem. But again, without knowing the exact timeline, it's unclear if this is the main issue.

Option G: They took several days to return a verdict. That's similar to option E, suggesting that they didn't have enough time to deliberate, which would lead to a verdict. However, the problem doesn't specify the time between enqueued and returned, but the fact that they were sequestered for only one night is a separate issue.

Option H: They returned a guilty verdict. Hmm, but the question is about a reversal, not a guilty verdict. So this is probably not the issue.

Option I: They didn't start deliberating until the following week. So if they were enqueued on Thursday, they didn't return until Monday, which is several days later. So I think this is the correct answer because the jury was not given enough time to deliberate, which is a common issue in trials. If they didn't deliberate enough, they wouldn't reach a verdict, leading to a reversal.

Option J: They started late in the afternoon. The trial began late in the afternoon, but that's about the start time, not necessarily the issue for a reversal unless it's related to deliberation time.

So the key issue here is that the jury wasn't given enough time to deliberate, which is option I. So the correct answer should be I.
</think>

Billy's strongest issue for a reversal is that the jury was not given enough time to deliberate, which led to the trial ending without a verdict. This issue is best captured by option I.

Answer: I
