Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. A ball is released from rest at a certain height, and I need to find its velocity after falling 256 feet. The options are A to J. Hmm, I think this is about kinematics, probably using the equations of motion under gravity.

Wait, the ball is released from rest, so initial velocity is zero. The acceleration is due to gravity, which is approximately 32 ft/s² downward. Oh wait, but when we talk about acceleration due to gravity, sometimes it's just 32 ft/s². But I should make sure. 

The formula I remember for velocity when starting from rest is v = sqrt(2gh), where g is acceleration due to gravity and h is the height. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The correct formula for velocity when starting from rest is v = sqrt(2gh). But alternatively, another equation is v² = u² + 2gh. Since initial velocity u is zero, yes, v² = 2gh. So v = sqrt(2gh). 

But wait, in the problem, the height h is 256 feet. So substituting h = 256 ft, g is 32 ft/s². Let's compute that. 

v squared is 2 * 32 * 256. Let's compute 2*32 is 64. 64 * 256. Hmm, what's 64 * 256? I think 64 * 200 is 12800, and 64 *56 is 3584. So 12800 +3584 is 16384. So v squared is 16384, so v is the square root of that. 

What's the square root of 16384? Let me think. 128 squared is 16384, because 128 * 128 is 16384. So v is 128 ft/s. So looking at the options, E is 128 ft/sec. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm using g as 32 ft/s². But sometimes, in feet, the acceleration due to gravity is considered about 32 ft/s², so that's correct. But wait, sometimes in some contexts, like in problems where gravity is approximated as 10 m/s², but here it's feet, so 32 ft/s² is correct. So that's correct.

Alternatively, is there another approach? Maybe using the equation v² = u² + 2 a s. Here, u is 0, a is g (32 ft/s²), s is 256 ft. So v² = 0 + 2*32*256 = 16384. So same as before. So same result, which is 128 ft/s. So option E is correct.

To determine the velocity of a ball released from rest after falling 256 feet, we use the kinematic equation for velocity when starting from rest: 

\[
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
\]

Here, the initial velocity \( u = 0 \), the acceleration \( a = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity), and the distance fallen \( s = 256 \, \text{ft} \). Substituting these values:

\[
v^2 = 0 + 2 \cdot 32 \cdot 256
\]

\[
v^2 = 2 \cdot 32 \cdot 256 = 64 \cdot 256 = 16384
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v = \sqrt{16384} = 128 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

Thus, the velocity after falling 256 feet is **128 ft/s**, which corresponds to option **E**.

Answer: E
