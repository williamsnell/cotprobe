Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about the Buckley Amendment. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Buckley Amendment.

I remember that the Buckley Amendment was related to accessible healthcare in the UK. So, the amendment probably addressed medical records for patients with disabilities. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options, option A talks about hospitals making modifications for patients with disabilities. That sounds relevant. Option B is about parents or legal guardians inspecting medical records. That's also a point of concern for accessibility. Option C mentions schools providing "free appropriate public education," which is more about education, not necessarily medical records. Option D is about parents wanting to inspect school records, which doesn't seem directly related to Buckley's main focus. Option E is about specialized school instruction, again more about education. Option F is about employers' accommodations, which I'm not sure is connected to the Buckley Amendment. Option G is about patients accessing their own hospital records, which sounds like it's about medical records. Option H is about patients getting access to their mental health records. Option I is about employers modifying tests for applicants with disabilities.

Wait, the Buckley Amendment specifically addressed the right to access medical records. I think the amendment was about ensuring that patients with disabilities could access their own medical records. So, looking at the options, G says patients have access to their own hospital records. That must be the correct answer.

Wait a second, I should make sure. Let me try to remember any details about the amendment. The Buckley Amendment was enacted in the 1960s, I think, during thelene era. It aimed to make healthcare more accessible, which would include providing patients with their own medical records. So, option G fits this. The other options either relate to education or other services, which the amendment didn't specifically address. 

So, the correct answer should be G. I don't think I'm mixing it up with other amendments like the No Child Left Behind Act, which dealt more with schools. The Buckley Amendment was for medical records specifically.

The correct answer is G: the right of patients to have access to their own hospital records.

Answer: G
