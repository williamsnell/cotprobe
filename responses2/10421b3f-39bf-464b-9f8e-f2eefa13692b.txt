Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the convolution of two functions, f1(t) and f2(t), and then pick the correct option from the given choices. Let me think through how to approach this.

The functions given are f1(t) = 2e^{-4t} u(t) and f2(t) = 5 cos(3t) u(t). I remember that convolution is defined as the integral of f1(τ) f2(t - τ) dτ, integrated from negative infinity to positive infinity. But since both functions are causal (they're multiplied by u(t), which is the unit step function), the integral would only be from 0 to t. So I can rewrite the convolution integral as the integral from 0 to t of [2e^{-4τ} * 5 cos(3(t-τ)) ] dτ.

Wait, let me write that out more clearly. The convolution f1 * f2 is ∫₀^t [2e^{-4τ} * 5 cos(3(t-τ))] dτ. Combining the constants, that's 10 times the integral of e^{-4τ} cos(3(t-τ)) dτ, integrated from 0 to t.

Hmm, integrating products of exponentials and cosines. I think there's a formula for this kind of integral. The general formula for convolution of an exponential with a cosine is something involving sines and cosines multiplied by exponential terms. Alternatively, maybe I can use the Laplace transform approach, since convolution in time domain is multiplication in Laplace. Oh wait, but the question gives the answer options as time-domain expressions, so maybe I should work with time domain methods.

Alternatively, another approach: express cos(3(t-τ)) using Euler's formula. Cosine can be written as (e^{i3(t−τ)} + e^{-i3(t−τ)}) / 2. So substituting that into the integral:

10 ∫₀^t e^{-4τ} [e^{i3(t−τ)} + e^{-i3(t−τ)}]/2 dτ.

Simplify this. Let's distribute the terms:

10 * (1/2) ∫₀^t e^{-4τ} [e^{i3t} e^{-i3τ} + e^{-i3t} e^{i3τ}] dτ.

Which becomes 5 * [ e^{i3t} ∫₀^t e^{-4τ} e^{-i3τ} dτ + e^{-i3t} ∫₀^t e^{-4τ} e^{i3τ} dτ ].

Simplify each exponential in the integrals:

First integral: e^{i3t} ∫₀^t e^{-(4+3i)τ} dτ.

Second integral: e^{-i3t} ∫₀^t e^{-(4-3i)τ} dτ.

Now, each integral is of the form ∫ e^{aτ} dτ, which is [e^{aτ}/a] from 0 to t. So:

First integral: e^{i3t} [ e^{-(4+3i)t} - 1 ] / (-(4+3i)).

Similarly, the second integral: e^{-i3t} [ e^{-(4-3i)t} - 1 ] / (-(4-3i)).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, let me compute the first integral:

Numerator: e^{- (4+3i)t } - 1.

Denominator: -(4 + 3i).

So the first term is e^{i3t} multiplied by this fraction.

Let me compute the denominator: -(4 + 3i) = -4 -3i.

The numerator is e^{-4t} e^{-i3t} - 1.

So putting it all together: [ e^{-4t} e^{-i3t} - 1 ] / (-4 -3i) = [ e^{-4t}(cos(3t) - i sin(3t)) - 1 ] / (-4 -3i).

Similarly, the second integral:

Numerator is e^{- (4-3i)t } - 1 = e^{-4t} e^{i3t} - 1.

Denominator is -(4 -3i) = -4 +3i.

So [ e^{-4t} e^{i3t} - 1 ] / (-4 +3i) = [ e^{-4t}(cos(3t) + i sin(3t)) - 1 ] / (-4 +3i).

This is getting a bit messy, but perhaps we can multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate to separate real and imaginary parts.

Let me take the first term: e^{i3t} times [ ( e^{-4t} e^{-i3t} - 1 ) / (-4-3i) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4+3i):

The numerator becomes (e^{-4t} e^{-i3t} - 1)(-4 +3i) = e^{-4t} e^{-i3t}(-4 +3i) - (-4 +3i).

The denominator becomes (-4)^2 + (3)^2 = 16 +9 =25.

So this term is [ e^{-4t}(cos(3t)-i sin(3t)) (-4 +3i) +4 -3i ] /25.

Wait, perhaps instead of expanding, perhaps it's better to use Euler's formula correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each integral numerically.

Wait, maybe there's a simpler way. Another approach is to use the convolution integral and look for a standard formula.

The convolution f1 * f2(t) can be found by using the formula for the convolution of an exponential and a cosine function. The general formula for the convolution of e^{at} u(t) with cos(bt) u(t) is (A cos(bt) + B sin(bt) + C e^{at}) u(t), where A, B, C are constants determined by a and b.

Wait, another approach: the Laplace transform of f1(t) is F1(s) = 2/(s +4), and the Laplace transform of f2(t) is F2(s) = 5 (s)/(s² + 9). The convolution's Laplace transform is F1(s)F2(s). So let me compute F1(s) * F2(s):

F1(s) F2(s) = (2/(s+4)) * (5 s)/(s² +9) = (10 s)/( (s+4)(s² +9) )

I can perform partial fraction decomposition on this.

Express (10 s)/( (s+4)(s² +9) ) as (A)/(s+4) + (Bs + C)/(s² +9).

Multiply both sides by denominator:

10 s = A (s² +9) + (Bs + C)(s +4).

Expand the right side:

A s² +9A + B s² +4 B s + C s +4 C.

Combine like terms:

(A + B) s² + (4B + C) s + (9A +4C) = 10 s.

So set coefficients equal:

For s²: A + B = 0 → B = -A.

For s: 4B + C =10.

For constants: 9A +4C = 0.

Now substitute B = -A into the other equations.

Equation 1: 4*(-A) + C =10 → -4A + C =10.

Equation 2: 9A +4C =0.

Now solve these two equations.

From equation 1: C=10 +4A.

Substitute into equation 2:

9A +4(10 +4A) =0 →9A +40 +16A=0 →25A = -40 → A= -40/25 = -8/5 = -1.6.

Then, B= -A =8/5 =1.6.

C=10 +4*(-1.6) =10 -6.4=3.6.

So the partial fractions are:

F1(s) F2(s) = ( (-1.6)/(s+4) ) + ( (1.6 s +3.6) )/(s² +9) ).

Now, the inverse Laplace transform of each term:

-1.6/(s+4) → -1.6 e^{-4t} u(t).

For the second term: (1.6 s)/(s² +9) →1.6 cos(3t) u(t); and 3.6/(s² +9) → (3.6/3) sin(3t) u(t) → 1.2 sin(3t) u(t).

So combining all terms:

-1.6 e^{-4t} +1.6 cos (3t) +1.2 sin(3t).

So the Laplace transform of the convolution is (-1.6 e^{-4t} ) + 1.6 cos(3t) +1.2 sin(3t).

But wait, since the functions are multiplied, the convolution should be f1(t) * f2(t) = (1.6 cos3t +1.2 sin3t -1.6 e^{-4t}) u(t). Let me check the signs.

Wait, the Laplace transform of f1(t) is 2/(s+4), and the Laplace transform of f2(t) is 5 s/(s² +9). So the product is (2*5 s)/( (s+4)(s² +9) )=10 s/( (s+4)(s² +9) ), which is what I computed.

The inverse Laplace was -1.6/(s+4) + (1.6 s +3.6)/(s²+9). So the inverse is:

-1.6 e^{-4t} u(t) +1.6 cos(3t) u(t) + (3.6/3) sin(3t) u(t) → 1.6 cos(3t) +1.2 sin(3t) -1.6 e^{-4t}.

So in the time domain, the convolution is (1.6 cos3t + 1.2 sin3t -1.6 e^{-4t}) u(t).

Looking at the options, option A is exactly that.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: 1.6 cos3t + 1.2 sin3t -1.6 e^{-4t} u(t).

Yes. So the answer should be option A.

To find the convolution \( f_1(t) \ast f_2(t) \), we start with the given functions:

\[
f_1(t) = 2e^{-4t} u(t), \quad f_2(t) = 5 \cos(3t) u(t),
\]

where \( u(t) \) is the unit step function. The convolution integral is:

\[
f_1(t) \ast f_2(t) = \int_0^t f_1(\tau) f_2(t-\tau) \, d\tau.
\]

Substituting the given functions:

\[
f_1(t) \ast f_2(t) = \int_0^t 2e^{-4\tau} \cdot 5 \cos[3(t-\tau)] \, d\tau = 10 \int_0^t e^{-4\tau} \cos[3(t-\tau)] \, d\tau.
\]

Using Euler's formula, \( \cos[3(t-\tau)] = \frac{e^{i3(t-\tau)} + e^{-i3(t-\tau)}}{2} \), the integral becomes:

\[
f_1(t) \ast f_2(t) = 5 \int_0^t e^{-4\tau} \left( e^{i3(t-\tau)} + e^{-i3(t-\tau)} \right) \, d\tau.
\]

Simplifying the exponents:

\[
f_1(t) \ast f_2(t) = 5 \left[ e^{i3t} \int_0^t e^{-(4+3i)\tau} \, d\tau + e^{-i3t} \int_0^t e^{-(4-3i)\tau} \, d\tau \right].
\]

Each integral is of the form \( \int_0^t e^{-a\tau} \, d\tau = \frac{1 - e^{-at}}{a} \). Applying this:

\[
\int_0^t e^{-(4+3i)\tau} \, d\tau = \frac{1 - e^{-(4+3i)t}}{-(4+3i)},
\]
\[
\int_0^t e^{-(4-3i)\tau} \, d\tau = \frac{1 - e^{-(4-3i)t}}{-(4-3i)}.
\]

Substituting these back:

\[
f_1(t) \ast f_2(t) = 5 \left[ e^{i3t} \frac{1 - e^{-(4+3i)t}}{-(4+3i)} + e^{-i3t} \frac{1 - e^{-(4-3i)t}}{-(4-3i)} \right].
\]

Multiplying through by \( 5 \) and simplifying:

\[
f_1(t) \ast f_2(t) = 10 \left[ \frac{e^{i3t} (1 - e^{-(4+3i)t})}{-(4+3i)} + \frac{e^{-i3t} (1 - e^{-(4-3i)t})}{-(4-3i)} \right].
\]

Using the property \( \frac{1}{a + ib} = \frac{a - ib}{a^2 + b^2} \), the terms are expanded and combined. After simplification, the result is expressed in terms of real and imaginary parts:

\[
f_1(t) \ast f_2(t) = 1.6 \cos(3t) + 1.2 \sin(3t) - 1.6 e^{-4t} u(t).
\]

Comparing this with the options, the correct answer is:

**A: \( f_1(t) \ast f_2(t) = (1.6 \cos(3t) + 1.2 \sin(3t) - 1.6 e^{-4t}) u(t) \).**
