Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about vapor pressure of solutions. Hmm, let me think. The question gives me the vapor pressures of benzene and toluene at 90°C. Benzene has a vapor pressure of 1022 Torr, and toluene is 406 Torr. I need to find the composition of the solution that boils at 1 atm, which is 760 Torr, at 90°C. Oh right, and the solution is ideal, so I don't have to worry about Raoult's law or anything complicated.

Wait, wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Boiling point at 1 atm? Oh, no, wait. Wait, the boiling point is where the vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure. So, the solution's vapor pressure should equal 760 Torr. Because when the vapor pressure of the solution is higher than the solvent's, the solution will boil.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The boiling point is when the vapor pressure of the solution equals atmospheric pressure. So in this case, the vapor pressure of the solution (which is a mixture of benzene and toluene) should equal 760 Torr. Because if the vapor pressure is higher than atmospheric, the solution will boil. So the total vapor pressure should be 760 Torr.

So I need to find the mole fractions of benzene and toluene such that their partial pressures add up to 760 Torr. Oh wait, because for an ideal solution, the partial pressure of each component is just the mole fraction multiplied by their pure vapor pressure.

So, let's denote x_benzene as the mole fraction of benzene, and x_toluene as that of toluene. Since it's a solution, x_benzene + x_toluene = 1.

The partial pressures are P_benzene = x_benzene * P_benzene_pure, and P_toluene = x_toluene * P_toluene_pure.

Because the total vapor pressure P_total = P_benzene + P_toluene = 760 Torr.

So, substituting: x_benzene * 1022 + x_toluene * 406 = 760.

But since x_toluene = 1 - x_benzene, substitute:

x_benzene * 1022 + (1 - x_benzene) * 406 = 760.

Let me compute that. Let's expand the equation:

1022 x_benzene + 406(1 - x_benzene) =760

1022 x_benzene + 406 -406 x_benzene =760

Combining like terms:

(1022 -406) x_benzene +406 =760

616 x_benzene +406 =760

Subtract 406 from both sides:

616 x_benzene =760 -406 = 354.

So x_benzene =354 /616 ≈ 0.574467.

So x_benzene is approximately 0.574. Since x_toluene is 1 - 0.574 = 0.426.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is Benzene:0.574, Toluene:0.426. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but wait a moment. I think I made a mistake. Because the problem states that the solution boils at 1 atm (760 Torr). So the total vapor pressure of the solution is equal to 760 Torr. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought. Oh, wait, but the question says 'boil at 1 atm pressure and 90°C'. Wait, but the vapor pressure at 90°C for the pure substances is 1022 and 406. So when the solution is at 90°C, the vapor pressure is 760 Torr. So that's correct.

So the calculation leads to x_benzene being about 0.574, meaning benzene is about 57.4% in the solution. Looking at the options:

Option A: Benzene:0.574, Toluene:0.426. That's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, another option is G: Benzene:0.426, Toluene:0.574. Oh, that's the reverse. Because if x_benzene is 0.426, then the solution is more toluene. Wait, let me double-check the math to make sure I didn't flip anything.

Wait, let's re-calculate the x_benzene. So 354 divided by 616. Let me compute that.

354 ÷616. So 616 is approximately 600. 354/600 is 0.59, but 616 is a bit more than 600, so denominator is bigger, the value is a bit less. Let me compute:

616 x 0.574 is 616 *0.574.

Wait, 616 *0.5=308, 616 *0.074= approx 45.784. Sum is 353.784, which is close to 354. So x_benzene is approximately 0.574.

So benzene is at 57.4% in the solution (option A), toluene at 42.6% (option A as well). So the correct answer should be A.

To determine the composition of the benzene-toluene solution that boils at 1 atm (760 Torr) at 90°C, we use the concept of vapor pressure for ideal solutions. The total vapor pressure of the solution is the sum of the partial pressures of the components, which are calculated as the mole fractions multiplied by their respective pure vapor pressures.

The given data is:
- Vapor pressure of benzene at 90°C: \( P_{\text{benzene}}^{\text{pure}} = 1022 \, \text{Torr} \)
- Vapor pressure of toluene at 90°C: \( P_{\text{toluene}}^{\text{pure}} = 406 \, \text{Torr} \)
- Total vapor pressure at boiling point: \( P_{\text{total}} = 760 \, \text{Torr} \)

Let \( x_{\text{benzene}} \) be the mole fraction of benzene and \( x_{\text{toluene}} = 1 - x_{\text{benzene}} \) be the mole fraction of toluene. The partial pressures are:
\[
P_{\text{benzene}} = x_{\text{benzene}} \cdot 1022, \quad P_{\text{toluene}} = x_{\text{toluene}} \cdot 406
\]
The total vapor pressure is:
\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{benzene}} + P_{\text{toluene}}
\]
Substituting the expressions for partial pressures:
\[
x_{\text{benzene}} \cdot 1022 + (1 - x_{\text{benzene}}) \cdot 406 = 760
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
1022x_{\text{benzene}} + 406 - 406x_{\text{benzene}} = 760
\]
\[
(1022 - 406)x_{\text{benzene}} + 406 = 760
\]
\[
616x_{\text{benzene}} + 406 = 760
\]
\[
616x_{\text{benzene}} = 354
\]
\[
x_{\text{benzene}} = \frac{354}{616} \approx 0.574
\]
Thus, the mole fraction of benzene is approximately \( 0.574 \), and the mole fraction of toluene is:
\[
x_{\text{toluene}} = 1 - x_{\text{benzene}} = 1 - 0.574 = 0.426
\]

From the options provided:
- **Option A** states \( x_{\text{benzene}} = 0.574 \) and \( x_{\text{toluene}} = 0.426 \), which matches the calculated values.
