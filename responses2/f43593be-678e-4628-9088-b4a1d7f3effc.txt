Question:

TheAlforsCompany had a beginning inventory of $30,000, Jan 1, 1974. During the year, purchases amounted to $87,500, net sales to $102,000. Assuming that the gross profit rate is 40% of the net sales, what is the ending inventory using the gross profit method of inventory evaluation?

Options:

A: $50,200
B: $45,100
C: $60,400
D: $56,300
E: $58,800
F: $54,400
G: $65,500
H: $62,900
I: $48,700
J: $52,600

Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the ending inventory using the gross profit method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says: The AlforsCompany had a beginning inventory of $30,000 on Jan 1, 1974. During the year, they made purchases of $87,500, net sales of $102,000, and the gross profit rate is 40% of the net sales. I need to find the ending inventory.

Wait, the Gross Profit Method is used when you don't have the ending inventory. So, I think the formula involves calculating the cost of goods sold (COGS) and then subtracting that from the cost of goods available for sale to find ending inventory.

Let me recall the formula. The basic idea is:

Ending Inventory = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - COGS

But wait, there's another way. Since they're giving me the gross profit rate, I can calculate COGS based on that. Because COGS is usually calculated as (100% - gross profit rate) of net sales. Because if the gross profit is 40% of net sales, then COGS is 60% of net sales.

So the formula would be:

COGS = Net Sales * (1 - Gross Profit Rate)

Let me plug in the numbers. Net sales are $102,000, and the gross profit rate is 40%. So COGS is 102,000 * (1 - 0.40) = 102,000 * 0.60 = $61,200.

Now, cost of goods available for sale is the sum of beginning inventory and purchases. So beginning inventory is $30,000, and purchases are $87,500. So cost available = 30,000 + 87,500 = 117,500.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Or is COGS the cost of goods sold, which is the cost associated with selling the inventory. So to find ending inventory, it's COGS plus beginning inventory minus purchases? Wait, no, wait: COGS is the cost of goods sold, which equals beginning inventory plus purchases minus ending inventory. So to find ending inventory, it's beginning + purchases - COGS.

Wait, another approach: COGS is calculated as (100% - gross profit rate) times net sales, which we did as 61,200. Then, the cost of goods available for sale is beginning + purchases, which is 30,000 + 87,500 = 117,500.

Wait, but wait, another way: The cost of goods available for sale is beginning inventory plus purchases, right? So that's 30,000 + 87,500 = 117,500.

And if COGS is 61,200, then ending inventory would be 117,500 - 61,200 = 56,300.

Wait, but let me check. Alternatively, using the formula:

Ending Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Purchases) * (1 - (Gross Profit Rate / 100)).

Wait, no, that's not right. Because COGS is 61,200, so the ending inventory would be 117,500 - 61,200 = 56,300.

Looking at the options, I see option D is $56,300. So the answer should be D.

To calculate the ending inventory using the gross profit method, we first determine the cost of goods sold (COGS). Since the gross profit rate is 40% of net sales, COGS is 60% of net sales. 

1. **Calculate COGS:**
   \[
   \text{COGS} = \text{Net Sales} \times (1 - \text{Gross Profit Rate}) = 102,000 \times (1 - 0.40) = 102,000 \times 0.60 = 61,200
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of goods available for sale:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of Goods Available for Sale} = \text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Purchases} = 30,000 + 87,500 = 117,500
   \]

3. **Calculate ending inventory:**
   \[
   \text{Ending Inventory} = \text{Cost of Goods Available for Sale} - \text{COGS} = 117,500 - 61,200 = 56,300
   \]

The ending inventory is $56,300, which corresponds to option D.

**Answer: D**
