Okay, I've got this problem here about minimizing the cost of mimeographing copies. The cost function given is C(x) = 0.005x + (4500/x). I need to find the value of x that minimizes this cost. Hmm, I remember from my math classes that to find the minimum of a function, calculus is usually involved. Let me think about how to approach this.

So, the function C(x) is a combination of two terms: 0.005x and 4500/x. Both terms are positive, so increasing x would make the first term larger, but the second term would get smaller. There must be a point where the total cost is the lowest. That point is the minimum of the function.

I think I should find the derivative of C(x) with respect to x. The derivative will give me the slope of the function at any point x. At the minimum point, the slope should be zero. So, let's calculate C'(x).

The derivative of 0.005x is straightforward. The derivative of any term ax is just a, so 0.005x differentiates to 0.005. Now, the second term is 4500/x, which can be written as 4500 * x^(-1). The derivative of x^(-1) is -x^(-2), so applying the chain rule, the derivative of 4500/x is -4500 * x^(-2), which simplifies to -4500 / x².

Putting it all together, the derivative C'(x) is 0.005 - 4500 / x².

To find the critical points, I set this derivative equal to zero:

0.005 - 4500 / x² = 0.

Let me solve for x. Moving the second term to the other side:

0.005 = 4500 / x².

Now, let's solve for x². Multiply both sides by x²:

0.005x² = 4500.

Then, divide both sides by 0.005:

x² = 4500 / 0.005.

Let me calculate that. 4500 divided by 0.005 is the same as 4500 * 200, because 1/0.005 is 200. So, 4500 * 200 equals 900,000.

So, x² = 900,000. Taking the square root of both sides, x must be sqrt(900,000). Let me compute that. The square root of 900,000 is sqrt(9 * 100,000) = 3 * 316.227766 (since sqrt(100,000) is approximately 316.227766), which is roughly 3 * 316.23 = 948.68. Since we're dealing with copies, I can probably ignore the decimal points, so x is approximately 948.68.

Looking at the answer options, option H is 949 copies. That seems to be the closest to 948.68, so that must be the minimum point.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations. Let me verify each step again. The derivative seems right: 0.005 - 4500/x². Setting that to zero, solving for x gives the same result. So the minimal cost is indeed at x ≈ 948.68, which rounds to 949. So option H is the correct answer.

The minimal cost occurs where the derivative of the cost function is zero. Solving \( C'(x) = 0.005 - \frac{4500}{x^2} = 0 \) leads to \( x \approx 949 \) copies. This corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
