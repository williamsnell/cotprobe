Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding how many terms in the expansion of (m + n)^6 are odd, given that m and n are odd integers. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you expand a binomial expression like (m + n)^k, you get terms involving combinations of m and n. Each term's coefficient comes from the binomial coefficient, which is C(k, r) where r ranges from 0 to k. Since m and n are both odd, each term in the expansion will be m^r * n^(k-r). 

Wait, but the question is about the terms being odd, not the coefficients. So I need to figure out when the term m^r * n^(6-r) is odd.

But wait, m and n are odd, so m^r is odd for any r because an odd number raised to any power is still odd. Similarly, n^(6-r) is also odd. So when you multiply two odd numbers, the result is odd. So each term in the expansion should be odd, right? Because (odd)*(odd) = odd. So every term in the expansion of (m + n)^6 would be odd.

That would mean all 7 terms (since for (a + b)^6, the expansion has 7 terms: from r=0 to r=6) are odd. So the answer should be option C: All the terms are odd.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is there any possibility that a term could be even? Since both m and n are odd, m^r is odd, n^(6-r) is also odd. Multiplying two odds gives an odd number. So every term is indeed odd. So yes, all seven terms are odd.

The expansion of (m + n)^6 consists of 7 terms. Each term is of the form m^r * n^(6−r). Since m and n are odd integers, m^r and n^(6−r) are both odd. The product of two odd numbers is odd. Therefore, all terms in the expansion are odd.

Answer: C
