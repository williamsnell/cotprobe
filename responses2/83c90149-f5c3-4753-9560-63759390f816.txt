Question:

A husband and wife owned and operated a grocery store. The grocery store was situated in the first floor of the building in which the husband and wife occupied a second-floor apartment. Late one evening, the defendant was walking past the grocery store when he decided to steal the money he heard had been stashed in a cigar box inside the store. The defendant furtively walked to the rear of the building. He then proceeded to open the gate to the fenced-in back yard. Once inside the back yard, the defendant attempted to pry open the back window of the grocery store. Awakened by the barking of his watchdog, the husband went out onto his second- floor back porch and saw the defendant below. The husband yelled at the defendant. Startled, the defendant turned to run when he noticed a large package lying outside the rear door to the store. The defendant picked up the package, which contained baked bread that had been delivered earlier in the evening, and the defendant then ran off. Which of the following crimes will the defendant most likely be convicted of?

Options:

A: Burglary and theft.
B: Larceny and burglary.
C: Larceny.
D: Attempted burglary and theft.
E: Trespassing and attempted burglary.
F: Trespassing and larceny.
G: Burglary.
H: Attempted larceny.
I: Larceny and attempted burglary.
J: Trespassing, larceny and attempted burglary.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal law, and I need to figure out which option the defendant would be convicted of. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario: A husband and wife run a grocery store on the first floor of a second-floor apartment. Late one evening, the store owner (I think the husband) put a cigar box in a box, and that's where the stolen money was. Then the defendant comes by late at night and decides to steal. He furtively walks to the rear, opens the back gate, and enters the back yard. Then he tries to open the back window, and the husband yells. The defendant turns to run when he sees a large package lying outside the store's rear door. He picks it up and runs off.

The question is about which crime the defendant would be convicted of. The options are A to J, each a combination of crimes.

Let me think about the relevant crimes here. The main elements are burglary and larceny, but maybe some others.

Burglary requires the owner of the premises to commit the crime by entering or entering into possession. Here, the defendant entered the back yard, so that's a burglary. But wait, the store's owner is the husband, and the defendant is the defendant. Did the owner commit the burglary? Or is the defendant the one who is committing it? I think it's the latter. The husband is the owner, and the defendant is another person. So the defendant entered the premises, committing a burglary. So option G says burglary, but then it's followed by theft, which I'm not sure about yet.

Larceny is when someone with intent to permanently deprive another of their property, with the intent to permanently deprive, and the property is taken without the owner's consent. The defendant here is trying to steal the package from the store. So that's larceny.

Wait, but when the husband called and the defendant turned to run, he yelled. That's physical contact. But in terms of criminal law, that's not a crime by itself. It's just a means to an end, so maybe not a crime, but the defendant might be guilty of theft if he had access to the package.

Wait, the package was outside the store's door. So when he saw it, he took it. So if he had access, he could steal it. So that's larceny. But for larceny, the owner's consent is needed. The store's owner (husband) might not have consent for the package. So if the husband had the consent, then the defendant's larceny wouldn't be possible. But if he didn't have consent, then the larceny would be possible. I'm not sure about that.

Also, the defendant's intent: he was trying to steal the money, so he had intent to steal. But if he didn't have the owner's consent, then it's larceny. So that's a larceny.

So the options that include larceny and theft are B and I. Let me see. Looking at the options:

Option A: Burglary and theft. But the theft would require the owner's consent, which the husband may not have. Unless the package was taken without his consent, which I'm not sure. So if the package was taken without the husband's consent, then larceny is possible.

But in the scenario, the husband had the package lie outside the door. So he was probably in the store looking for something, and when he heard a noise, he went to the back, saw the package, and took it. So if he had access, that's larceny. But if he didn't have access, then it's theft.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Burglary is when someone with intent enters or enters with intent to commit a felony. Here, the defendant entered the back yard, which is the back side of the store. So that's burglary. But the store owner (husband) isn't the one committing the burglary. The owner's intent was to take money, so he might have intended to steal, but the act of the defendant is a separate burglary.

But wait, the husband is the owner. So when the defendant comes in, he's committing a burglary. But if the husband is the one who put the package in, and the husband doesn't have consent, then the theft would take place.

Wait, but the package is being taken from the store. So if the husband didn't have consent for taking it, then larceny would occur. But if the husband had consent, it's theft.

Wait, but the husband's action is just looking for the money and then taking it. If he doesn't have the owner's consent, then the theft would not be possible. So the defendant's intent is to steal, but without the owner's consent. So the theft wouldn't apply because the owner might have agreed.

Alternatively, the package was taken without the owner's consent. So the theft would be the taking of the package from the owner's property without consent. That would count as theft. But if the owner had the right to take the package, then it's larceny.

Wait, the owner is the husband, and he might have the right to take the package. So if he doesn't, then the theft is possible. But if the husband had the right, then the larceny isn't possible because the owner would have consent.

So in this case, the husband is the owner, and when the defendant sees the package, he takes it. Whether he takes it depends on whether he had consent. The husband, being the owner, might not have consent for the package, so the theft would occur. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the package was stolen from the store, and the husband didn't have consent, so it's theft.

Wait, but the scenario says that the husband, who owns the store, had the money and was about to steal it. When the defendant came in, he saw the package lying outside. So he took it. If the husband didn't have the owner's consent, then theft would be taking it without permission. But if he did have the owner's consent, then it's larceny.

But the husband is the owner, and he's the one who had the package. So when the husband saw the package outside, he might have intended to take it, which would be theft, even if the owner didn't consent. Wait, but if the owner doesn't consent, then the owner is the one who put the package in, so the theft wouldn't be possible. So the theft would be the taking of the package, but that's only possible if the owner had the right.

In this case, the husband is the one who had the package, so if he didn't have the owner's consent, then the theft of the package isn't possible because the owner wouldn't have taken it without his consent. Therefore, the theft is the taking of the package, but only if the owner had consent. So the theft wouldn't be possible because the owner didn't consent. Therefore, the theft would not occur.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the possible elements for each crime.

Burglary: requires the owner to commit the crime by entering or with intent to commit a felony. Here, the defendant entered the back yard, committing burglary. The owner is the husband, but he's the one who put the package in. So the owner is not the one committing the burglary. So the burglary is by the defendant, and the owner's decision of where to put the package doesn't affect the burglary. So the burglary is the defendant's action.

Larceny: requires intent to permanently deprive, with the intent to permanently deprive, and the property is taken without the owner's consent. So if the owner (husband) didn't consent to take the package, then larceny is possible. But if he did consent, it's theft.

But in this scenario, the husband was about to take the money. He heard a noise and went to the back. He saw the package lying outside. He took it. So if the husband had the owner's consent, then it's theft. But if he didn't, then it's larceny.

Wait, but the husband is the owner. So if he had the right to take the package, then theft is possible, because the owner was the one who had the package. But the husband is the one who's in possession, so perhaps the owner didn't consent. So the owner's consent would be lacking, so theft would not be possible. Therefore, the larceny would not be possible because the owner didn't consent. So in that case, the theft wouldn't be applicable.

Wait, but the husband was in the store looking for the money, and then when he heard a noise, he went to the back, saw the package, and took it. So if the owner didn't consent to taking the package, then the theft wouldn't be possible, and the larceny would be impossible. So the only crime the defendant could be convicted of is larceny. But wait, the husband is the owner, and when the defendant took the package, he might have had the owner's consent. But wait, the husband is the one who was going to take the money, so if he didn't consent, then theft wouldn't occur.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible options again. The options are combinations of different crimes.

The options are:

A: Burglary and theft.

B: Larceny and burglary.

C: Larceny.

D: Attempted burglary and theft.

E: Trespassing and attempted burglary.

F: Trespassing and larceny.

G: Burglary.

H: Attempted larceny.

I: Larceny and attempted burglary.

J: Trespassing, larceny, and attempted burglary.

So the options are about combinations.

The scenario involves the defendant entering the back of the store, which is a burglary. Then, he attempts to open the back window, but then he finds the package outside. The husband yells, and he then turns to run and sees the package.

But the key point is whether the theft occurred. Since the package was taken from the store, if the owner had consent, then theft is possible. But the husband is the owner, and he was in the store looking for the money. So when the defendant saw the package, he might have had the owner's consent. So theft would be possible. Alternatively, if the owner didn't consent, then it's larceny.

Wait, but the husband is the one who had the package. So if he didn't consent, theft wouldn't be possible because the owner wouldn't have taken it without his consent. So in that case, the theft wouldn't be applicable, so the only crime would be larceny.

But then, when the husband saw the package, he was in the store, and the defendant took it. So if the husband had the owner's consent, theft is possible. So the theft would apply.

So the possible crimes are larceny and theft. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the owner didn't consent, then it's larceny.

Wait, but the question is about what the defendant would be convicted of. The defendant's actions are: he committed a burglary by entering the store's back yard, and then he took the package from the store without the owner's consent. So, if the owner had consent, theft is possible. But if the owner didn't have consent, then the theft wouldn't occur, so the only crime is larceny.

Wait, but the theft would be a separate crime. So which one is it? If the owner had consent, theft is possible. But if not, larceny is possible.

Wait, but the husband is the owner. So when he saw the package, he was in the store, and the owner would have intended to take it, but if the owner didn't consent, then it's theft. So the theft would be possible, so the theft is a separate crime.

Wait no, because the theft requires the owner's consent. So the theft would require the owner's consent. So if the owner didn't have consent, then theft isn't possible. Therefore, the theft wouldn't occur, so the only crime is larceny.

Wait, but the husband was the owner. So if the owner didn't have consent, then the theft wouldn't be possible, but the theft would only occur if the owner had consent.

So in this case, the theft would not be applicable because the owner didn't consent. Therefore, the only crime is larceny.

So the options that include larceny and theft are B and I. Option B says larceny and burglary. Option I says larceny and attempted burglary.

Wait, but the options are:

I: Larceny and attempted burglary.

So the question is, are the defendant committing both larceny and attempted burglary?

Wait, the defendant went to the back yard, which is the store's back. He then tried to open the back window, then went to the back porch, saw the package, and ran off. So he committed a burglary by entering the store's back yard (a felony, probably), and then he took the package from the store ( theft).

So the items are larceny and burglary. So the options that include both would be B and I.

But wait, the option I is "Larceny and attempted burglary." So if the defendant attempted to commit a burglary, then he would also be guilty of burglary. So the possible options are B and I.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each crime again.

The main elements are:

- Burglary: Owner's entry into the premises, with intent to commit a felony. Here, the defendant committed a burglary by entering the back yard. The owner was the husband, but he's not the one committing the burglary. So the burglary is by the defendant. But the question is about what the defendant is convicted of.

- Larceny: Taking with intent to permanently deprive, without owner's consent. So if the owner had consent, theft is possible. If not, larceny is possible.

But the husband is the owner. When the defendant took the package, did the husband allow it? The husband was going to steal the money, so he would have intended to take it. So if the husband had the owner's consent, theft is possible. But if not, larceny is possible.

Wait, but the husband is the owner, so when the defendant took the package, that's theft only if the owner didn't consent. But the scenario says the husband was about to take the money. So it's possible that the husband didn't consent, so theft would occur.

Alternatively, the husband is the owner, and when the defendant took the package, he would have access. So the theft would be possible.

So the theft is possible, and the burglary is possible. So the defendant would be convicted of both larceny and burglary.

Looking at the options, that's option B: Larceny and burglary.

Alternatively, if the owner had consent, then the theft wouldn't occur, so the only crime would be larceny. But since the owner is the husband, and the husband is in the store, when the defendant took the package, it's possible that the husband had the owner's consent, so theft is possible.

Wait, maybe I should re-examine the elements. For larceny, the key is whether the owner had the right to take the property. The owner is the husband, and when the defendant took the package, he would have had access. So if he didn't consent, theft would occur. So the theft is possible, so the theft is a separate crime.

Thus, the defendant is guilty of both larceny and burglary. So option B.

Alternatively, the defendant might be guilty of larceny only because he took the package without the owner's consent, and the burglary is not the issue. But the options don't have a combination of larceny and burglary. So I'm back to thinking that the correct answer is B.

Wait, but another angle: Did the defendant commit a burglary?

Yes, because he entered the back yard, committing a felony (burglary). So he's convicted of burglary. But then, he also took the package. If the owner had the right, theft is possible. So theft is a separate crime.

Hmm.

Alternatively, the theft is not possible because the owner's consent was lacking, so the only crime is larceny. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the scenario says the husband was about to take the money, so it's possible that the husband had the owner's consent. So in that case, theft isn't applicable. Therefore, only larceny.

So the options would be option I: Larceny and attempted burglary.

Wait, but the defendant is guilty of larceny and attempted burglary. But if the owner had consent, then the theft wouldn't be possible.

Wait, I think I need to clarify the facts. The husband was in the store looking for the money. He heard a noise, went to the back, saw the package, and took it. If the husband had the owner's consent, then theft isn't possible. If he didn't, then theft is possible. But the scenario doesn't specify whether the husband was in the owner's possession.

Wait, the husband is the owner. So when the defendant took the package, he was in the store, and the owner (husband) would have intended to take it. But if the husband didn't consent, then theft isn't possible. So the theft isn't applicable, so the only crime is larceny.

But then, the available options don't have a choice that combines larceny only. The options are combinations of different crimes.

Looking again, the options are:

A: Burglary and theft.

B: Larceny and burglary.

C: Larceny.

D: Attempted larceny.

E: Trespassing and attempted burglary.

F: Trespassing and larceny.

G: Burglary.

H: Attempted larceny.

I: Larceny and attempted burglary.

J: Trespassing, larceny, and attempted burglary.

So if the theft isn't possible, the only crime is larceny, which would be option C. But that's not correct because the options combine multiple crimes.

Wait, perhaps the theft is possible because the husband didn't consent. So the theft would be possible, along with the burglary.

So the options that include both are B and I.

Wait, the options are:

B: Larceny and burglary.

I: Larceny and attempted burglary.

Wait, the options for B and I are combinations of two crimes.

So if the theft is possible, and the burglary is possible, then the defendant is convicted of both, which is option B.

If the theft isn't possible (because the husband didn't consent), then the only crime is larceny, which is option C.

But the question is about what the defendant is convicted of.

In this case, the theft would be possible if the husband didn't consent, so option B.

Alternatively, if the husband had consent, then only larceny.

Wait, the scenario says that the husband was about to take the money, so it's possible that he didn't have consent. Therefore, theft is possible, and the burglary is possible.

So the answer would be B: Larceny and burglary.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The key points for the crimes:

- Burglary: The owner committed the crime by entering or with intent to commit a felony. Here, the defendant entered the back yard, which is a felony. So the defendant is guilty of burglary.

- Larceny: Taking with intent to permanently deprive, without the owner's consent. So if the owner had consent, theft is possible. If not, larceny is possible.

But the scenario says that the husband was about to take the money. So if the husband had the owner's consent, theft is possible. If not, larceny is possible.

But the husband is the owner. So when the defendant came in, he was looking for the money. So if the husband had the owner's consent, theft is possible. But if he didn't, then larceny is possible.

Wait, but the husband is the owner, and when the defendant took the package, he would have had the owner's consent. So the theft wouldn't be possible.

Wait, no, the husband is the owner, and when the defendant took the package, he would have had the owner's consent. So the theft wouldn't be possible, so the only crime is larceny.

But that's not one of the options. The options include combinations.

Wait, perhaps the husband didn't consent, so theft is possible, and the burglary is still possible. So the defendant is guilty of both.

So the correct answer is B.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think of the possible options.

The options are:

B: Larceny and burglary.

I: Larceny and attempted burglary.

So the answer is either B or I.

If the theft is possible, then the answer is B.

If the theft isn't possible (because the husband didn't consent), then the answer is I.

But in the scenario, the husband was about to take the money, so he likely had the owner's consent. But the description says the husband was in the store looking for the money and heard a noise, went to the back, saw the package, and took it.

So perhaps the husband didn't have the owner's consent, because he was looking for the money, and when he saw the package, he took it. So if he didn't have the owner's consent, theft is possible, and the burglary is still possible.

So the answer is B: Larceny and burglary.

Wait, but the options don't have "Larceny and burglary" as a correct answer. Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: Burglary and theft.

B: Larceny and burglary.

C: Larceny.

D: Attempted larceny.

E: Trespassing and attempted burglary.

F: Trespassing and larceny.

G: Burglary.

H: Attempted larceny.

I: Larceny and attempted burglary.

J: Trespassing, larceny, and attempted burglary.

So option B is Larceny and burglary.

So the answer should be B.

Alternatively, maybe the theft is possible, so the answer is I: Larceny and attempted burglary.

Wait, but the husband was in the store, and when the defendant came in, he saw the package. He took it. So if the husband had the owner's consent, theft is possible. So the theft is a separate crime.

But the option I says Larceny and attempted burglary. So if the defendant attempted to commit a burglary, that's a different scenario.

Wait, but the options are about what the defendant is convicted of.

Wait, I'm getting too tangled up. Let me think of the possible scenarios.

The defendant is guilty of:

1. Burglary (leaving the premises as a felony).

2. Larceny (taking with intent to permanently deprive, without owner's consent).

So the options are B and I.

So the correct answer is B: Larceny and burglary.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of the possible options and pick the correct one.

The correct answer is B: Larceny and burglary.

Because the defendant is guilty of both, as he committed a burglary and took the package with intent to permanently deprive, thus committing larceny.
</think>

The defendant is guilty of both larceny and burglary. Here's why:

1. **Burglary**: The defendant committed a felony by entering the back yard of the store. This counts as burglary.

2. **Larceny**: The defendant took the package from the store without the owner's consent. Since the owner (husband) did not have the right to take the package, theft is not applicable, but larceny is possible.

Thus, the defendant is convicted of both larceny and burglary.

ANSWER: B
