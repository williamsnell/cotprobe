Question:

Define the term "learning."

Options:

A: Learning is a change in behavior that occurs without practice or experience.
B: Learning is an involuntary physiological response to environmental changes.
C: Learning is a temporary change in behavior.
D: Learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior resulting from conditions of practice or experience.
E: Learning is a decrease in the ability to respond to repeated stimuli over time.
F: Learning is a periodic shift in thinking that resets every few years.
G: Learning is the acquisition of skills through genetic inheritance.
H: Learning is a short-term adaptation to immediate stimuli without lasting effects.
I: Learning is the process of memorizing facts and information.
J: Learning is the process of downloading information directly to the brain.

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct definition of "learning" from the options provided. Let me start by going through each option carefully.

First, I remember from my psychology classes that learning is a fundamental cognitive process. It involves acquiring new information or skills. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definition, so I'll have to think this through.

Option A says learning is a change in behavior without practice or experience. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I think that's more about habituation than actual learning. Like, if you stop responding to something, it's not learning because you didn't practice it.

Option B claims it's an involuntary response to environmental changes. That's like a natural reaction, maybe instinct. But learning is more about effort and experience, not just reacting to the environment.

Option C suggests it's a temporary change. That doesn't fit because I know learning usually leads to lasting changes, especially when it's through practice or experience.

Option D says it's a permanent change due to practice or experience. That rings a bell. I remember something about how repeated practice leads to automaticity, meaning the brain can do it without conscious effort. So this seems like the right choice.

Option E says it's a decrease in responding. I'm not sure about this. Could learning cause a decrease? Maybe in some cases, like if the response is no longer effective, but that's more about adaptation than learning itself. I think learning involves more than just responding to stimuli.

Option F talks about periodic shifts in thinking. That sounds like habituation, not learning. It's more about changes that happen over time, maybe due to environmental factors, but I don't think that's the primary definition of learning.

Option G is about genetic inheritance. That's more about heredity and hard-wired abilities, not learning. Like, if someone has a learned skill, it's not from their genes.

Option H says it's a short-term adaptation without lasting effects. That's more like habituation than learning. Like, after some time, you stop responding, but that's not learning.

Option I says memorizing facts and information. That's more about what learning entails. It's not just memorizing, but also the process of acquiring it through various methods.

Option J is about downloading info directly to the brain. I'm not sure. I think information is stored in the brain, but learning itself is the process of acquiring that information, not the storage method. So I don't think J is correct.

Putting it all together: I think D is the correct answer because it accurately describes learning as a permanent change due to practice and experience. The other options either refer to temporary changes, involve other processes, or are not the primary definition.

The correct answer is D: Learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior resulting from conditions of practice or experience. This aligns with the understanding that learning involves acquiring information or skills through repeated practice or exposure to stimuli. 

Answer: D
