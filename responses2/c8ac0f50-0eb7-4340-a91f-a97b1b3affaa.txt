Question:

A purchasing agent for a women's clothing store negotiated a contract with dressmaking company to purchase a specified quantity of khaki garments at a price of $75,000. One week later, the purchasing agent received a telephone call from the vice president of the dressmaking company, who informed her that the dressmaking company's sales representative had made an error in calculating the contract price. As a result, the vice president said that unless the women's clothing store agreed to pay an additional $15,000, the garments would not be delivered. If the purchasing agent should have known that the dressmaking company's original price term of $75,000 was in error, but agreed to the contract anyway, which of the following is the most accurate statement?

Options:

A: There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the purchasing agent acted in good faith.
B: There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error.
C: There was no valid contract formed, because there was no mutuality of assent.
D: There was no valid contract formed, because the price was not agreed upon by both parties.
E: There was a valid contract formed, because the dressmaking company was responsible for their own error.
F: The contract is invalid, because the purchasing agent took advantage of the dressmaking company's error.
G: There was an enforceable contract at the revised price term, because the error was corrected before delivery.
H: There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake was unilateral.
I: There was a voidable contract, because the dressmaking company made an error.
J: There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake resulted from an error in computation, not in judgment.

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about contract law, specifically about whether a contract is enforceable when there's a mistake in the price terms. 

So, the scenario is this: A purchasing agent for a women's clothing store negotiated a contract to buy a certain quantity of khaki garments at $75,000. One week later, a vice president from the dressmaking company told the purchasing agent that their sales representative made a mistake in calculating the contract price. As a result, the vice president said that unless the store agreed to pay an additional $15,000, the garments wouldn't be delivered. 

The purchasing agent agreed to the contract anyway. The question is about whether the contract is enforceable given that the purchasing agent knew of the error but still agreed to the contract.

From what I remember about contracts and mistakes, there are a few key factors to consider. 

First, depending on whether the mistake was unilateral (one party made a mistake) or bilateral (both parties made mistakes), the contract can be affected. But in this case, the mistake was made by the dressmaking company, not the purchasing agent. So the mistake is on the vendor's side.

Now, the main point is whether the contract is enforceable when there's a mistake in the terms. If the contract is valid, it must have been created in good faith, mutual assent, and enforceable under the principles of contract law.

In contract law, when there's a contract, the parties must have intended to bind each other. However, a mistake in the contract can create a void unless it's corrected. 

Wait, but in this scenario, the purchasing agent agreed anyway. So the contract's terms were in error, but the parties agreed to the original terms. So, does that make the contract voidable?

Wait, another angle: A contract is voidable if there's a mistake in the terms and it can be shown that the mistake was a unilateral mistake that created an impossibility or that the contract was impossible to perform. But in some jurisdictions, the rule is that if a contract is in error but the parties still agree to the terms, the contract may be enforceable as a contract with a revised price. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Alternatively, the rule is that if the contract is invalid, then the parties can still have a contract with a revised price. But if the contract is valid, then it's voidable only if the mistake can't be corrected, but if it can, then it might not be voidable.

Wait, another thought: If the original contract is in error, but the parties have a good faith and mutual assent to the original terms, then the contract is enforceable. Because the mistake may have been on the vendor's part, but the parties agreed to the original price. So if they intended the original price and agreed to it, then the contract is enforceable as the original contract.

So looking at the options, option A says there was an enforceable contract at the original price term because the purchasing agent acted in good faith. That sounds right. Because the mistake was on the vendor's side, but the parties agreed to the original terms. The purchasing agent might have had some knowledge, but since the mistake was their company's, perhaps the contract is still enforceable as the original terms.

Alternatively, option B says there was a voidable contract because the purchasing agent should have known of the error. But wait, if the vendor knew of the error, would that void the contract? Or is the mistake on their side, so it's their fault, not theirs. So the vendor's mistake shouldn't void the contract. So option B might be incorrect.

Another angle: Perhaps the mistake is on the vendor's side, so the contract is voidable if the vendor can prove the mistake was unforeseeable. But if the vendor made a mistake, the contract is not voidable. So in this case, the mistake is on the vendor's side, so the contract isn't voidable. So the correct answer would be that the contract is enforceable at the original terms because the vendor's mistake was not their fault, and the parties agreed. So answer A.

Wait, but another possibility: Some jurisdictions have rules where if there's a mistake in the contract, but the parties still agree to the terms, the contract is enforceable. Because they agreed to the original terms, the vendor's mistake doesn't negate the contract. So that supports answer A.

So the correct answer should be A.
</think>

The purchasing agent negotiated a contract at a price of $75,000 but later discovered a mistake in the price term. The vendor agreed to the original terms, despite the mistake. This situation involves a contract with a mistake on the vendor's side, but the parties' mutual agreement to the original terms renders the contract enforceable. The mistake is not on the vendor's fault, so the contract remains valid at the original price. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the purchasing agent acted in good faith.**
