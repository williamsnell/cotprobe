Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me about consumer behavior and decision-making. I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is asking about an imbalance between a consumer's actual and desired state where they realize that a gap or problem needs resolving. The options include terms like self-concept, lifestyle discrepancy, etc. I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, let me think about each term. 

First, self-concept refers to a person's perception of themselves. That's more about how they see themselves and their values, not directly about problems or gaps in their desire.

Lifestyle discrepancy is a bit vague, but I think it's when someone has an expectation of how they want their life to be and then encounters a gap between that expectation and reality. That sounds like what the question is describing. So, maybe that's the answer.

Motive development is about why someone chooses one option over another. Like, internal aspects of why they feel the need to resolve a problem. Not sure if that's the term we're looking for.

Perception adjustment is when someone recalibrates their beliefs after a situation changes. That might be related to how people see things, which could relate to the idea of a gap needing resolution.

Product evaluation is about assessing the quality of a product, which doesn't seem to fit as well as the others.

Customer dissatisfaction is when a product is not meeting expectations, but that's a state after a problem was identified, not the cause.

Intrinsic satisfaction is about the internal motivation someone has, not the actual problem or state imbalance.

Cognitive dissonance is the psychological state someone is in when they hold conflicting beliefs or expectations, which could be related to the need to resolve a problem.

An attitude is more about beliefs or feelings about something, not the gap itself.

Purchase intent is about the desire to buy a product, which is more about the decision-making process than the state imbalance.

Economic dissatisfaction is a bit different, focusing on financial aspects.

Wait, so the question is about the imbalance between actual and desired state. That sounds like when a person's expectations (desired state) don't align with reality (actual state), leading to a gap that needs addressing. That's what a lifestyle discrepancy is. So option B.

Alternatively, cognitive dissonance (C) is about holding conflicting thoughts, which could reduce dissatisfaction. But the question is about the state itself, not the internal conflict.

So I think the correct answer is B: Lifestyle discrepancy.

The correct answer is B: Lifestyle discrepancy. This term refers to the gap between a consumer's desired state and their actual situation, highlighting the imbalance that requires resolution. 

Answer: B
