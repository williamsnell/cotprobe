Okay, so I've got this question about which group was converted to Christianity in the tenth century by missionaries from the Byzantine Empire. Let me try to break this down.

First, I'll read the question again to make sure I understand it. The question lists several groups, and I need to pick which one was converted to Christianity in the 10th century due to missionary efforts from the Byzantine Empire. The options are A to J, each representing different cultures.

I remember that the Byzantine Empire was a significant power in Eastern Europe, and they had various missionary groups. One of the main ones I've heard about is the Moors, though I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think the Normans might have been involved too, but I'm not certain.

Wait, what do I know about each group? Let's think:

A: Ostrogoths – I think they were a Hellenistic people, but I don't recall them being converted to Christianity much.

B: Russians – They were members of the Hellenistic people, but again, not sure about conversion.

C: Moors – I remember that the Moors, also known as the Huns, were a group that had a lot of influence in the Iberian Peninsula. They were originally spread across Spain and Portugal and expanded into the Iberian Peninsula. They had a significant impact on the Christian communities there. I think the Moors were one of the first groups to adopt Christianity, maybe by the 5th century.

D: Anglo-Saxons – These were Germanic people. I know they were converted to Christianity in the 4th century, so this isn't the right answer.

E: Visigoths – These are the Germanic people, known as the Visigoths. They were the ancestors of the Visigoths who became the Frankish people. They spread Christianity to the Iberian Peninsula around the 5th century. So maybe this is a possibility.

F: Celts – The Celtic people were originally from the Iberian Peninsula, including the Moors and Huns. They were the ones that were converted to Christianity, but I don't think the conversion was started by the Byzantine Empire. It must have been more of a gradual process over centuries.

G: Huns – These are the same as the Moors. So both G and C are about the same group, but the question lists them as separate options.

H: Vandals – These are the Germanic people, known as the Vandals. They're the ancestors of the Frankish, so they were also converted to Christianity in the 5th century.

I: Normans – The Normans were a different group. They were the result of a European conflict between the Normans and the Franks. The Normans were from the Frankish Kingdom, so similar to the Huns and Moors. They were also converted to Christianity, but I think this conversion was more a result of the Norman Conquest rather than being the result of direct missionary efforts from the Byzantine Empire. I think the Byzantine missionaries might have helped with that.

J: Franks – The Franks were the people of the Frankish Kingdom. They were the ones who received the Norman influence, but the conversion to Christianity was done by the Normans, not the Byzantines.

So, the question is about conversion via Byzantine missionaries. So the options that are related are C (Moors/G) and E (Visigoths/Huns).

Wait, the 10th century conversion. I think the Moors were converted to Christianity in the 5th century, and the Huns were converted around the 4th century. So the Moors were perhaps the first to convert towards Christianity in that period.

Alternatively, the Normans were one of the first groups to receive the conversion, but I think the Byzantine missionaries were the ones who brought Christianity to the Iberian Peninsula. The Moors were perhaps the first to adopt it, as the Byzantines were present there.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The Byzantine Empire's missionary work probably started in the 5th or 6th century. So the conversion to Christianity by them would have taken place in the 10th century. That makes sense because the 10th century is a time when many of these groups were expanding their influence.

So, the answer is the group that was first converted to Christianity by Byzantine missionaries in the 10th century. The Moors were one of the first, but I'm not sure if the conversion was directly from the Byzantine Empire. Alternatively, the Normans might have been influenced by them, but the question is about the group that was directly converted.

Wait, another thought: The Moors were the first to convert to Christianity by the Byzantine Empire? Or was it the other way around? I think the Byzantines were the ones who brought Christianity to the Iberian Peninsula. But the Moors were already a Christian group, so it's possible that they were converted by religious influence during the Byzantine period.

Alternatively, the Normans were also converted to Christianity, but I think the Moors were the first. Or maybe both C and E are correct, but the question lists them as separate options, so which one is the correct answer.

Looking at the options, the question is which group was converted by Byzantine missionaries in the 10th century. The correct answer is C: Moors or E: Visigoths. But the conversion was likely due to the influence of the Byzantine Empire, so perhaps the Moors were the ones that received it.

Wait, another angle: The Huns (G) were in the same boat as the Moors. They were the Moors. So both C and G are the same group. So the options are C and G as separate, but the question lists them as separate options. Let me check the options again.

The options are A to H. So the group is either C or G, both referring to the same people. Or are they separate? Wait, the options are:

A: Ostrogoths

B: Russians

C: Moors

D: Anglo-Saxons

E: Visigoths

F: Celts

G: Huns

H: Vandals

I: Normans

J: Franks

So C and G are the same. So the question is which group, either Moors or Huns.

The conversion by Byzantine missionaries in the 10th century. I remember that the Byzantines were present in the Iberian Peninsula around the 5th century. The Moors were probably the first to convert to Christianity there, but were they directly converted by the Byzantines or by the Christian converts?

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the Huns, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the Moors were the first to convert to Christianity in the Iberian Peninsula, but the Byzantine Empire was the one to bring it there. Alternatively, the conversion was done by the Byzantine missionaries in the 10th century, so the group that was converted by them would be the one that the Byzantines brought in.

But the question is which group was converted by them, so it's the group that received the conversion, not the one that brought it. So the group that was brought in by the Byzantines.

Wait, the Byzantine Empire's missionaries were from the 6th to 10th century. So the group that was converted in the 10th century would have been the ones that received it.

So, the options that are in the Iberian Peninsula at that time are the Moors (C) and the Huns (G). But the question lists C and G as separate options, so perhaps the correct answer is G: Huns, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The Huns were the same as the Moors. So perhaps both C and G refer to the same group, but in the options, they are listed separately.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the Visigoths (E). Because I think the Visigoths were also converted by Byzantine missionaries in the 10th century.

Wait, let's think about the timeline.

The 5th century: The Moors, Huns, and Visigoths were present.

The 6th century: The Byzantine Empire began to establish control over the Iberian Peninsula, including the Iberian Peninsula. They established missions there, which likely influenced the Christian communities.

In the 10th century, the Byzantine Empire's missionary efforts, particularly from the 6th and 7th centuries, brought Christianity to the Iberian Peninsula. So the groups that were converted by them would be the ones that were present in the 10th century.

The Huns and Moors were present in the 10th century, so perhaps the correct answer is the Huns (G), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the Normans (I) were converted in the 4th century, so that's earlier than 10th century.

Wait, but the question is about the group converted in the 10th century by Byzantine missionaries. So the correct answer is the group that was present in the 10th century and was brought in by them.

The Huns (G) and Moors (C) were present, but the question lists them as separate options. So perhaps the correct answer is the Huns (G), but I'm not certain because I think the Moors were the ones who were already converted and the conversion was done by the Byzantines.

Alternatively, the correct answer is the Visigoths (E), because the Byzantines were the ones who brought Christianity to the Iberian Peninsula, but the conversion was done by the Visigoths as well. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: The 10th century is a time when the Iberian Peninsula was being converted to Christianity. The Moors were one of the first to convert, but perhaps the conversion was more by the Huns and Visigoths. The Normans were also converted by the Byzantines, but the question is about the group converted by them, not the source.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. The question is which group was converted to Christianity by the Byzantine Empire in the 10th century. So the answer is the group that was present in the 10th century and was influenced by the Byzantines.

The Huns (G) and Moors (C) were present. The normans (I) were converted in the 4th century.

So the correct group is either C or G. But the options are separate, so the correct answer must be one of them.

Looking back, I think the Huns (G) are in the same boat as the Moors. So the correct answer is G: Huns.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: The Moors were present in the 10th century, and the Byzantine Empire was their direct influence. The conversion was done by the Byzantines, so the correct answer is the group that was converted by them, which would be the Huns (G), because the Byzantines were present there and brought Christianity.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the Visigoths (E), as they were the direct descendants of the Huns and were in the same area.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the official timeline. The Byzantine Empire was established in 559 CE, but the conversion to Christianity was done by the 10th century. So the groups that were present in the 10th century would have been the Huns (G) and the Moors (C). But the conversion was done by the Byzantines, not the Huns or Moors.

So the group that was converted to Christianity by the Byzantine Empire in the 10th century is the Huns (G), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the correct answer is the Visigoths (E), as they were the direct descendants of Huns and the Byzantines brought Christianity to them.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the timeline. The 10th century is when the Byzantines arrived and started missions. The Huns were already present in the 6th century, and the Byzantines arrived in the 7th, establishing missions in the Iberian Peninsula, which then brought Christianity to the Huns and Moors.

So the group that was converted by the Byzantine Empire in the 10th century is the Huns (G). But I'm not 100% confident, so perhaps the answer is the Visigoths (E), as they were also present and converted.

Wait, no—because the Huns were already there, and the Visigoths were the direct descendants.

Alternatively, the correct answer is the Huns (G), but I'm not sure. Another way: The correct answer is the Huns (G) because they were converted by the Byzantine Empire in the 10th century. But I think the correct answer is the Huns (G), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the correct answer is the Huns (G), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another point: The Moors were already converted in the 5th century, so the conversion in the 10th century wouldn't be by them. So the correct answer is the Huns (G).

The question asks which group was converted to Christianity in the tenth century by missionaries from the Byzantine Empire. To determine the correct answer, we analyze the timeline and the influence of the Byzantine Empire.

1. **Understanding the Options**: The groups listed include the Moors (C and G), which are Huns, and the Visigoths (E). The Byzantine Empire arrived in the 7th century and established missions in the Iberian Peninsula, influencing the Christian communities there in the 10th century.

2. **Historical Context**: The Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to the Christian communities in the Iberian Peninsula, particularly the Huns and the Moors. The Huns were already present in the 6th century, and the Byzantines arrived in the 7th century, establishing missions and converting these groups to Christianity.

3. **Conversion Timing**: The conversion of the Huns and Moors to Christianity occurred in the 10th century, as the Byzantine Empire was present in the Iberian Peninsula during this time. The conversion was done by the Byzantine missionaries, not the Huns or Moors themselves.

4. **Conclusion**: The group that was converted to Christianity by the Byzantine Empire in the 10th century is the Huns (G), as they were the ones directly influenced by the empire's missions and were the first to adopt Christianity in the Iberian Peninsula.
