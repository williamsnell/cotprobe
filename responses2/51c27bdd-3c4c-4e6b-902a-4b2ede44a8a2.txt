Question:

A woman broke her leg while skiing. She was taken to a hospital where she was treated by a doctor who determined that the woman would need surgery to set the broken bones so that they would heal properly. During the surgery, the doctor inserted several metal screws into the woman's leg to hold the bones together. Although the hospital charged the woman a substantial fee for the doctor's services, the bill did not include a separate charge for the cost of the bone screws. A few months after the surgery, the woman's leg still was not fully healed. The doctor eventually concluded that the screws that were inserted into the woman's leg had been defective. The woman was forced to have a second surgery to replace the defective screws. If the woman asserts a strict tort liability claim against the doctor and the hospital for using defective screws in her surgery, she will most likely

Options:

A: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital can argue that the defect was not apparent during the surgery.
B: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital provided a product to her that was defective and unreasonably dangerous.
C: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital failed to provide a follow-up check on the screws used.
D: prevail, because the hospital and the doctor were negligent in their duty to ensure the safety of medical devices used.
E: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital did not manufacture the screws and, therefore, the defect in the screws was not their fault.
F: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital will be treated as service providers rather than product sellers.
G: not prevail, because the hospital did not separately charge for the screws, thus they cannot be held responsible.
H: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital did not inform her about the potential risks of defective screws.
I: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital are not liable for defects in medical devices they did not manufacture.
J: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital probably would have realized the screws were defective if they had carefully examined them.

Okay, so I've got this tort law question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit nervous because torts can be tricky, especially when it comes to defective medical devices. But I'll take it slow.

The scenario is a woman who broke her leg while skiing and was taken to a hospital. The doctor inserted metal screws to help her heal. The hospital charged her, but the bill didn't include the screws' cost. She wasn't fully healed, so the screws were found defective. She had to have another surgery to fix them.

Now, the question is about her asserting strict liability against the doctor and the hospital. Strict liability means the parties are liable if they knew or should have known that their actions were harmful or dangerous. So, I need to determine if the doctor and hospital were negligent in providing defective screws.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one to see which fits best.

Option A: Not prevail because the defect wasn't apparent. This makes sense because if the defect was obvious, the doctor might have been negligent. But the question says the defect was found later, so maybe this isn't the reason.

Option B: Preceded because the doctor and hospital provided a product defective and unreasonably dangerous. That sounds plausible. Medical devices can be dangerous if they're defective. If the screws were defective, the product's safety was at risk, so the manufacturer (hospital) and the doctor might be held liable.

Option C: Preceded because they failed to follow up on the screws. Wait, the failure to follow up might not directly relate to negligence. If they didn't check, maybe it's a negligence issue, but I'm not sure. I think that's more about the doctor's negligence in not informing her, not the product's own failure.

Option D: Preceded because hospital and doctor were negligent. This seems correct. The doctor may have been negligent in not knowing the screws were defective. Or the hospital made a mistake by not testing or educating.

Option E: Not prevail because the hospital didn't manufacture the screws. Wait, the question states that the hospital did charge for the screws, but didn't mention manufacturing them. So maybe the hospital could be liable because they should have provided the screws. But if they didn't manufacture, they might not be liable for the defect in the screws. But the question is about negligence, which might involve the manufacturer as well.

Option F: Not prevail because they're service providers. I'm not sure about this; service providers are different. If the hospital is a service provider, they might not be liable for defective devices unless they were negligent in providing them. But the question says the hospital did charge for the screws, which makes me think they're product manufacturers, not service providers.

Option G: Not prevail because the hospital didn't charge for screws. Wait, the question says the hospital did charge for the screws. So maybe they are liable because they should have provided the screws. But wait, the question says the bill didn't include the cost, so perhaps the hospital was negligent in not including the cost. But the bill includes the charges, only not including the screws. Hmm, not sure about this. Maybe the cost is part of the bill, but the issue is the product's defect.

Option H: Preceded because they didn't inform her. So if the defect was discovered after the surgery, maybe the doctor's negligence in not informing her about the defect would make the doctor liable. But the question is about the strict liability claim against both doctor and hospital. So if the doctor was negligent in not informing, and the hospital failed to provide a product, perhaps the hospital is also liable.

Option I: Preceded because they didn't realize the screws were defective. Wait, maybe the doctor should have known because she knew the broken leg could heal improperly. If the defect was apparent, the doctor might have been negligent. But the defect was found later, so perhaps the doctor is not liable here.

Option J: Preceded because they would have realized the screws were defective. Oh, this makes sense. If the defect was discovered after the surgery, the doctor's negligence in not knowing would make her liable. But how does that connect to the hospital?

Wait, let me think again. The question is about the doctor and hospital's liability. So the doctor may have been negligent in not knowing the defect, while the hospital may have been negligent in not informing about the defect. Or perhaps the product itself is defective, making the manufacturer liable.

But the bill didn't include the cost of the screws. So the hospital was responsible for the charges, but the product's defect is the issue. So the product liability would apply to the screws. If the screws were defective, the product liability would be on the manufacturer, which would be the hospital, and the doctor's negligence in not knowing about the defect would also make the doctor liable.

But wait, the question is about the strict liability claim against the doctor and hospital. So if the doctor and hospital knew or should have known the defect, but didn't, then their negligence would make them liable.

Alternatively, if the defect was not apparent during the surgery, the doctor might have been negligent in not knowing, but that's not the case here.

I think the key points are: the screws were defective, the product is at risk, and the manufacturer (hospital) and the doctor made a mistake in not knowing about the defect. Or, perhaps the doctor was negligent in not informing her.

Looking back at the options, option B says the doctor and hospital provided a defective and unreasonably dangerous product. That sounds correct because the doctor and hospital both were involved in providing the product that was defective.

Option H says the doctor was negligent in not informing her. But the question is about the doctor and hospital's liability, not the doctor's fault. So if the product was defective, the product liability applies. So the hospital is liable for the product defect, and the doctor's negligence in not knowing could be a separate issue.

Wait, but the question is about a strict liability claim. So the product liability would apply, making the hospital and doctor liable.

Wait, but the options don't directly address product liability. Let me look again.

Option B: product defective and unreasonably dangerous. That's probably correct, because medical devices can be dangerous if defective. If the screws were defective, the product is at risk, so the manufacturer (hospital) and the seller (doctor) would be responsible.

Option H: The doctor was negligent in not informing her. But does that mean the doctor is liable for her injury? The question is about the doctor and the hospital's liability, not the doctor's fault. So if the doctor was negligent in not knowing about the defect, that would be negligence of duty. But in the context of strict liability, perhaps that's not the case. Strict liability is about the parties knowing the defect or being negligent in their actions.

Wait, no. Strict liability is about the parties knowing the defect. If the defect existed, the product liability would be on the manufacturer, but the doctor's negligence in not knowing about the defect doesn't directly make her liable. So I think option B is more about the product liability, which is the hospital's responsibility.

But the question is about the doctor and the hospital. So the product liability would apply, and the doctor's negligence (if she knew about the defect) would not be directly her liability, but perhaps she's responsible for not knowing.

Wait, but the question is whether the doctor and hospital are liable for the defect. So if the product is defective, then the manufacturer is liable (hospital), but the doctor's negligence in not knowing about the defect would not make her liable. So in that case, the doctor's negligence isn't a factor here. Alternatively, maybe the doctor was negligent in not informing, but that's not the same as negligence of duty.

Alternatively, perhaps the doctor's failure to inform is not a negligence but a negligence of form. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about each option again.

Option B says the doctor and hospital provided a defective product. That makes sense because the screws were defective, so the product is at risk. So the product liability would apply to the hospital and the doctor.

Option I says they didn't realize the screw was defective. If they didn't know, then the doctor might be negligent in not knowing about the defect, which would be negligence of form. But the question is about strict liability, which is about negligence of form or knowledge.

Wait, strict liability is about the parties being negligent in their actions. So negligence of form is a separate issue. So if the doctor knew the defect existed, she would be negligent in form, which isn't the same as product liability. Product liability is separate.

So I think the issue is with the product being defective. Therefore, the product liability would be on the hospital and doctor's manufacturer and seller. So the correct answer would be B or H.

Wait, but H says "the doctor and the hospital probably would have realized the screws were defective if they had carefully examined them." So if they had examined, then the defect would have been apparent. But in this case, the defect was discovered after the surgery, so maybe the doctor was negligent in not knowing.

But the question is about the strict liability claim against the doctor and the hospital. So perhaps the product liability applies, making the hospital and doctor liable.

Alternatively, perhaps the doctor was negligent in not knowing the defect existed, which is a separate issue, but that doesn't make the doctor liable for her injury.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the options again.

Option B says it's because the product was defective. Option H says the doctor was negligent in not knowing about the defect. So if the product was defective, the product liability applies. But the question is whether the doctor and hospital are liable. If the product was defective, the manufacturer (hospital) is liable, but the doctor's negligence in not knowing about the defect is not a separate issue.

So the correct answer might be option B, because the product was defective and the manufacturer and seller are responsible.

Another angle: The question is about the doctor and hospital's liability for the defect. If the defect was not apparent during the surgery, the doctor might have been negligent in not knowing, but in this case, the defect was found after. So perhaps the only liability is from the product being defective, making the hospital and the doctor liable.

Wait, but the bill didn't include the cost, so the hospital was responsible. So the correct answer would be B or H.

Wait, the options:

B: product defective and dangerous.

H: the doctor was negligent in not knowing.

But if the product is defective, the product liability is on the manufacturer and seller, so the doctor's negligence in not knowing is separate from product liability. So the correct answer would be B.

So I think the correct answer is B: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital provided a product defective and unreasonably dangerous.

To determine the most likely outcome for the woman's strict liability claim against the doctor and the hospital, we need to analyze the factors relevant to strict liability. Strict liability applies when the parties were negligent in their actions or should have known about the harm caused. The key issue is the defective screws in the surgery, which could render the product at risk.

### Analysis of Options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The defect was discovered after the surgery, so the doctor and hospital were not negligent in failing to inform her about the defect.
  
- **Option B**: Correct. The screws were defective and unreasonably dangerous, making the product defective. Medical devices can be dangerous if defective, and the manufacturer (hospital) and seller (doctor) are responsible for providing a defective product.

- **Option C**: Incorrect. Failing to follow up on the screws was not the issue here; the defect was discovered after the surgery.

- **Option D**: Incorrect. The hospital did charge for the screws, but the issue is the defect in the product, not the cost.

- **Option E**: Incorrect. The hospital did manufacture the screws, so they are not treated as service providers.

- **Option F**: Incorrect. Service providers are a different category, and the hospital is a product manufacturer.

- **Option G**: Incorrect. The hospital did charge for the screws, making them liable for the cost, but the issue is the defect in the product.

- **Option H**: Incorrect. The doctor was negligent in not knowing about the defect, but this is a form of negligence (not negligence of form), not strict liability.

- **Option I**: Incorrect. The doctor was not negligent in not knowing about the defect; the defect was apparent after the surgery.

- **Option J**: Incorrect. The defect was not apparent during the surgery; it was discovered later.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible outcome is that the doctor and hospital were negligent in providing a defective product. The screws were defective and unreasonably dangerous, making the product at risk. The manufacturer (hospital) and seller (doctor) are responsible for providing such a defective product. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: B**
