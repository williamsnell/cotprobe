Okay, so I have this question about murder trials and the law regarding prospective jurors. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through what I know.

The question says: A defendant charged with first-degree murder shall be furnished with a list containing names and addresses of all prospective jurors. The options are A to J. I'm supposed to pick the right one.

First, I remember that in criminal law, especially murder cases, there are specific procedures. I think about the right away notice or something like that. Oh right, when a defendant is tried for murder, they have to be given a list of possible jurors. This is usually done right away after the charge is filed, I believe.

So I'm thinking the correct answer is B: immediately after being charged. Let me see why the other options might not be right.

Option A says "only if the prosecutor agrees." But the question doesn't say anything about the prosecutor needing to agree; it's a standard requirement. So A is too restrictive.

Option C is about upon request and showing good cause. I think that's more about the jury's consent when considering the defendant's case, not about being given the list upfront.

Option D: upon court order. But I don't think it's ordered; it's a legal duty to provide such a notice.

Option E: under no circumstances. That's not true; it's a standard requirement in many jurisdictions.

Option F: only if the jurors give consent. But I thought the list is given before the jurors decide, not based on their consent.

Option G says at the discretion of the judge. That's not the case; the law requires a specific process.

Option H: upon payment of a fee. That doesn't ring a bell. I don't think any fee is involved in the immediate notice of jurors.

Option I: upon payment of a fee. That's unrelated; the question doesn't mention fees.

Option J: only if the defendant can prove it's necessary for their defense. That's more about the defense's involvement, not the immediate requirement.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be B: immediately after being charged. I remember something about the prosecution having to provide this notice right away because it's crucial for the trial process.

The correct answer is B: immediately after being charged. This is a standard requirement in criminal law, particularly in murder trials, where prospective jurors are provided with a list of potential candidates. This notice is crucial for the trial process and must be given promptly upon the defendant's charge.

Answer: B
