Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem using Stokes' Theorem. Let me think through it step by step.

So, the problem is to evaluate the line integral ∫C F · dr, where F(x, y, z) = xy i + yz j + zx k. The curve C is a triangle with vertices at (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1), oriented counterclockwise as viewed from above.

Stokes' Theorem relates a line integral around a closed curve to a surface integral over the surface bounded by that curve. The theorem says that the integral is equal to the flux of the curl of F through the surface S bounded by C. So, the formula is:

∫_C F · dr = ∫∫_S (∇ × F) · dS

First, I need to find the curl of F. Let's compute that.

F = xy i + yz j + zx k.

The curl is calculated as the determinant of the following matrix:

|i   j   k|
|∂/∂x ∂/∂y ∂/∂z|
|F_x F_y F_z|

So, substituting F_x, F_y, F_z:

F_x = xy, F_y = yz, F_z = zx.

The curl ∇ × F is:

i*(∂F_z/∂y - ∂F_y/∂z) - j*(∂F_z/∂x - ∂F_x/∂z) + k*(∂F_y/∂x - ∂F_x/∂y)

Let's compute each component.

First component (i):

∂F_z/∂y = ∂(zx)/∂y = 0, since zx doesn't depend on y.
∂F_y/∂z = ∂(yz)/∂z = y.
So, i*(0 - y) = -y i.

Second component (j, with a negative sign):

∂F_z/∂x = ∂(zx)/∂x = z.
∂F_x/∂z = ∂(xy)/∂z = 0.
So, -j*(z - 0) = -j*z.

Third component (k):

∂F_y/∂x = ∂(yz)/∂x = 0.
∂F_x/∂y = ∂(xy)/∂y = x.
So, k*(0 - x) = -x k.

Putting it all together, the curl ∇×F is:

(-y)i - z j - x k.

So, ∇×F = -y i - z j - x k.

Now, according to Stokes' Theorem, the line integral is equal to the surface integral over S of (∇×F) · dS.

But wait, I need to choose a surface S bounded by the triangle C. The triangle is in 3D space, so the surface could be the triangular face itself. Alternatively, perhaps it's a flat surface, but I think in this case, since the curve is a triangle, the surface is the plane containing the three points.

Let me find the equation of the plane containing (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). 

The three points are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). Let's find the equation of the plane. 

The general equation is ax + by + cz = d. Plugging in the points:

For (1,0,0): a*1 + b*0 + c*0 = d → a = d.
For (0,1,0): a*0 + b*1 + c*0 = d → b = d.
For (0,0,1): a*0 + b*0 + c*1 = d → c = d.

So, a = b = c = d. Let's let d = 1 for simplicity (since the equation can scale).

So, the plane equation is x + y + z = 1.

That's the surface S.

Now, to compute the surface integral ∫∫_S (∇×F) · dS. 

The differential vector dS can be expressed in terms of the plane's normal vector. The normal vector n is given by the coefficients of x, y, z in the plane equation. Since the plane is x + y + z = 1, the normal vector is (1,1,1). But I should make sure it's a unit vector or not. Wait, actually, the surface integral can be expressed as the dot product of the vector field (∇×F) and the differential vector dS.

Alternatively, another way to write dS is (n) * dS, where n is the unit normal vector. But perhaps, since the plane is x + y + z = 1, the normal vector is (1,1,1), and its magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(3). So the unit normal vector is (1,1,1)/sqrt(3).

Wait, but for the surface integral, the differential vector dS can be expressed as n dS, where dS is the area element. Alternatively, since the plane is flat, we can parameterize it. But perhaps another approach is easier.

Alternatively, since the surface is a flat triangle, maybe we can parameterize it with two variables and compute the integral.

But perhaps another approach is to note that the surface integral is equal to the flux of (∇×F) through S. So, the integral becomes:

∫∫ (∇×F) · n dS,

where n is the unit normal vector. But wait, another way to write dS is (n · dA), but perhaps it's better to use the parametrization.

Alternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to compute the normal vector, set up the parametrization, and compute the integral.

Alternatively, another method might be to directly compute the flux integral by parametrizing the surface.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to parametrize the surface S, which is the triangle with points (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). Let's use two parameters, say u and v.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the parametrization in terms of two variables. Let me think: the surface can be parametrized as r(u, v) = (1-u-v, u, v), where u and v are such that u >=0, v >=0, and u + v <=1. Wait, but that's perhaps not the most straightforward parametrization.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the surface as a flat triangle and compute the integral.

Wait, another approach: since the surface is planar, the surface integral can be converted into a double integral over the projected area on a plane where the normal is known.

But perhaps a better approach: since the normal vector is (1,1,1), and the surface is a flat triangle, we can compute the flux by integrating (∇×F) · n over the area of the triangle.

Wait, but n is the unit normal, so (∇×F) · n would give the integrand, and then we'd integrate over the area of the triangle.

Wait, but actually, the formula for the surface integral of a vector field F over a surface S with normal vector n is:

∫∫_S F · n dS.

But in our case, F is the curl of F, which is (-y, -z, -x). So, the integrand becomes (-y)(n_x) + (-z)(n_y) + (-x)(n_z), where n is the unit normal vector.

But n is (1,1,1)/sqrt(3), so the dot product is:

(-y)(1/sqrt(3)) + (-z)(1/sqrt(3)) + (-x)(1/sqrt(3)) )

Which simplifies to (-x - y - z)/sqrt(3).

So, the integral becomes ∫∫_S (-x - y - z)/sqrt(3) dS.

Wait, but the surface S is the plane x + y + z =1, so on S, x + y + z =1. So, substituting, the numerator becomes (-1)/sqrt(3), because x + y + z =1 on the surface.

So, the integrand simplifies to (-1)/sqrt(3) for every point on S.

So, the integral becomes (-1/sqrt(3)) times the area of S.

Because the integrand is constant over S, the integral is just (-1/sqrt(3)) multiplied by the area of the triangle.

Now, what's the area of the triangle S? The triangle has vertices at (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). The area can be found using vectors.

Compute vectors in the plane: for example, from (1,0,0) to (0,1,0) is (-1,1,0), and from (1,0,0) to (0,0,1) is (-1,0,1). The cross product of these vectors will give the area times 1/2.

Wait, let's compute the vectors:

Vector u = (-1, 1, 0)

Vector v = (-1, 0, 1)

Cross product u × v is:

|i   j   k|
|-1   1   0|
|-1   0   1|

So, i*(1*1 - 0*0) - j*(-1*1 - 0*(-1)) + k*(-1*0 - (-1)*1)

Which is i*(1) - j*(-1) + k*(1)

So, (1, 1, 1)

The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(3).

The area of the parallelogram is |u × v| = sqrt(3), so the area of the triangle is (sqrt(3))/2.

So, the surface integral is (-1/sqrt(3)) * (sqrt(3)/2) ) = (-1/sqrt(3)) * sqrt(3)/2 = (-1/2).

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that. Because the integrand is (-1/sqrt(3)), and the area is (sqrt(3)/2), so:

(-1/sqrt(3)) * (sqrt(3)/2) ) = (-1) * (1/2) ) = -1/2.

So, the integral is -1/2.

But wait, let me think: what's the orientation of the surface and the curve? The curve is oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above. The surface being the triangle in the plane x + y + z =1, which is oriented according to the right-hand rule with the normal pointing in the direction (1,1,1). But the curve's orientation is also such that when viewed from above, the curve is moving in the counterclockwise direction around the triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, I calculated the curl as (-y, -z, -x). Then, the surface integral of (∇×F) · n dS is equal to the flux of (∇×F) through S.

But wait, in the formula, the surface integral is ∫∫ (∇×F) · dS, where dS is the vector area element. Hmm, but wait, the way I approached it was using the unit normal vector. But is that correct?

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. The formula for the surface integral of a vector field F is ∫∫ F · dS, which is ∫∫ F · (n dS), where n is the unit normal vector, and dS is the scalar area element. So, yes, my approach is correct.

But in this case, F is the curl of F, which is (-y, -z, -x). Then, the dot product with n (unit vector) is:

(-y)(1/sqrt(3)) + (-z)(1/sqrt(3)) + (-x)(1/sqrt(3)) 

Which simplifies to (-x - y - z)/sqrt(3).

Since, on the surface x + y + z =1, this becomes (-1)/sqrt(3).

Thus, the integral becomes (-1/sqrt(3)) times the area of S, which is (sqrt(3)/2), giving (-1/2).

Wait, but the problem was to compute ∫ C F · dr, which by Stokes is equal to this surface integral. So, I get -1/2.

Looking at the options, option A is -1/2. So I think the answer is A.

Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the parametrization or calculations. Let me verify another approach.

Another approach: Use Stokes' theorem, and compute the line integral directly, perhaps more straightforward.

The curve C is a triangle in 3D space. Let's parametrize each edge and compute the line integral.

But considering that the curve is a triangle, maybe it's easier to compute the integral over each edge and sum them up.

But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using Stokes' theorem directly.

Wait, let's re-express the problem: Compute ∫_C F · dr.

Alternatively, perhaps the line integral can be evaluated by breaking it into three parts, each along an edge of the triangle.

But perhaps another approach: Let's compute the curl again.

∇×F = (-y, -z, -x).

Wait, but how does that interact with the surface integral? As earlier, I think I did it correctly.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me recheck the curl calculation.

F = xy i + yz j + zx k.

So:

curl F = ( ∂Fz/∂y - ∂Fy/∂z, ∂Fx/∂z - ∂Fz/∂x, ∂Fy/∂x - ∂Fx/∂y )

Compute each component:

∂Fz/∂y = ∂(zx)/∂y = 0.

∂Fy/∂z = ∂(yz)/∂z = y.

So, i component: 0 - y = -y.

∂Fx/∂z = ∂(xy)/∂z = 0.

∂Fz/∂x = ∂(zx)/∂x = z.

So, j component: 0 - z = -z.

∂Fy/∂x = ∂(yz)/∂x = 0.

∂Fx/∂y = ∂(xy)/∂y = x.

So, k component: 0 - x = -x.

So, curl F is (-y, -z, -x). That's correct.

Then, the surface integral is ∫∫ (-y - z - x) dS divided by sqrt(3), since n is (1,1,1)/sqrt(3).

But on the surface x + y + z =1, each point's x + y + z is 1, so (-x - y - z) = -1.

So, the integral becomes (-1/sqrt(3)) * (area of S).

The area of S is the area of the triangle. As before, the vectors in the triangle are u = (-1,1,0) and v = (-1,0,1). Their cross product is (1,1,1), magnitude sqrt(3). The area is (sqrt(3))/2.

So, the integral is (-1/sqrt(3)) * (sqrt(3)/2) ) = (-1/2).

So, the answer is A: -1/2.

But wait, let me check the orientation again. The triangle is oriented counterclockwise as viewed from above, which is the same as the right-hand rule for the normal vector (1,1,1). So, the direction is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the surface is parameterized differently, but I think the approach is correct.

So, the answer must be A: -1/2.
</think>

To evaluate the line integral ∫_C F · dr, where F(x, y, z) = xy i + yz j + zx k, and C is the triangle with vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1), oriented counterclockwise as viewed from above, we use Stokes' Theorem. Stokes' Theorem states:

\[
\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{S},
\]

where \( S \) is the surface bounded by \( C \).

### Step 1: Compute the curl of \( \mathbf{F} \)
The curl of \( \mathbf{F} \) is calculated as:

\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \left( \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z}, \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} \right).
\]

Substituting \( \mathbf{F} = xy \, \mathbf{i} + yz \, \mathbf{j} + zx \, \mathbf{k} \):

- \( \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial (zx)}{\partial y} = 0 \),
- \( \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial (yz)}{\partial z} = y \),
- \( \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial (xy)}{\partial z} = 0 \),
- \( \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial (zx)}{\partial x} = z \),
- \( \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial (yz)}{\partial x} = 0 \),
- \( \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial (xy)}{\partial y} = x \).

Thus, the curl is:

\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = (-y, -z, -x).
\]

### Step 2: Determine the surface \( S \)
The surface \( S \) is the triangular face bounded by the vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). The plane equation for \( S \) is:

\[
x + y + z = 1.
\]

The normal vector to \( S \) is \( \mathbf{n} = (1,1,1) \), and its magnitude is \( \sqrt{3} \). The unit normal vector is:

\[
\mathbf{\hat{n}} = \frac{(1,1,1)}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the surface integral
The surface integral becomes:

\[
\iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \iint_S (-y, -z, -x) \cdot \left( \frac{1,1,1}{\sqrt{3}} \right) dS.
\]

Since \( x + y + z = 1 \) on \( S \), the integrand simplifies to:

\[
(-y - z - x) = -1.
\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
\iint_S (-1) dS = -\iint_S dS = -\text{(Area of } S).
\]

The area of \( S \) is the area of the triangle with vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). This can be computed using the cross product of vectors in the plane. Let \( \mathbf{u} = (-1,1,0) \) and \( \mathbf{v} = (-1,0,1) \). Their cross product is:

\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = (1,1,1),
\]

with magnitude \( \sqrt{3} \). The area of the triangle is:

\[
\text{Area of } S = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Thus, the surface integral is:

\[
- \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{3} = - \frac{3}{2}.
\]

Wait, this result does not match the earlier calculation. Let me re-examine the steps.

### Step 4: Re-evaluate the surface integral
The curl is \( (-y, -z, -x) \), and the normal vector is \( (1,1,1)/\sqrt{3} \). The dot product is:

\[
(-y, -z, -x) \cdot \left( \frac{1,1,1}{\sqrt{3}} \right) = \frac{-y - z - x}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

On the surface \( x + y + z = 1 \), this becomes:

\[
\frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The surface integral is:

\[
\iint_S \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} dS = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \text{Area of } S.
\]

The area of \( S \) is \( \sqrt{3}/2 \). Substituting:

\[
\frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{-1}{2}.
\]

Thus, the surface integral is \( -1/2 \).

### Step 5: Interpret the result
The line integral \( \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} \) is equal to the surface integral by Stokes' Theorem. Therefore, the result is:

\[
\boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}.
\]
