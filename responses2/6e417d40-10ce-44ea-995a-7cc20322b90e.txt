Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the total charge of a solid nonconducting sphere. Hmm, I remember from my studies that for nonconductors, the charge can be distributed in some way, and when calculating the total charge, you might have to integrate over the volume because the charge density isn't uniform.

The problem says the volume charge density varies with radial distance r as rho = (14.1 pC/m³) * r / R. Oh wait, pC is picocoulombs, right? So I should convert that to coulombs. 1 pC is 1e-12 C, so 14.1 pC is 14.1e-12 C/m³. That's an important step because all the other values are in SI units, I think.

The radius R is given as 5.60 cm. Oh wait, I should convert that to meters. 5.60 cm is 0.056 m. So R is 0.056 m.

The formula for total charge is the integral of rho over all space. Since it's a sphere, I'll use spherical coordinates. The volume element dV in spherical coordinates is 4πr² dr, right? So integrating rho(r) * 4πr² dr from r=0 to r=R.

Putting that together, the integral would be from 0 to R of (14.1e-12 C/m³ * r/R) * 4π r² dr. Let me write that out:

Q = ∫₀^R (14.1e-12 * r / R) * 4π r² dr.

Wait, wait, I should factor out the constants. Let's factor out 14.1e-12, 4π, and 1/R from the integral.

So Q = (14.1e-12) * 4π * (1/R) * ∫₀^R r^3 dr.

Wait, the integral of r^3 dr from 0 to R is [r^4/4] from 0 to R, which is R^4 / 4. So substituting that in, we have:

Q = (14.1e-12) * 4π * (1/R) * (R^4 /4 )

Simplify this expression. Let's compute the constants step by step.

The R terms: R^4 / R = R^3.

So R^3 /4. So putting it all together:

Q = (14.1e-12) * 4π * (R^3 /4 )

Wait, the 4 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, so 4π * (R^3 /4) is π R^3.

So Q = (14.1e-12) * π * R^3.

Wait, wait, no. Let me recheck that. Oh, the 4π comes from the integral of 4π r². The integral of r^3 dr is r^4/4, so when multiplied by (1/R), it's R^3/4.

So the expression becomes:

Q = (14.1e-12) * 4π * (R^3 /4 )

The 4 in numerator and denominator cancels, so it's 14.1e-12 * π R^3.

Wait, but let me think again: 4π is multiplied by R^3/(4). So 4π * R^3/(4) is π R^3. So yes, correct.

So Q = (14.1e-12) * π * (0.056)^3.

Wait, let's compute that.

First, compute 0.056^3. Let's calculate that.

0.056 * 0.056 is 0.003136. Multiply by 0.056 again: 0.003136 * 0.056 = approx 0.000175616.

Wait, but let me compute that accurately. 0.056 * 0.056 = 0.003136. Then 0.003136 * 0.056.

Compute 0.003136 * 0.056:

0.003136 * 0.05 = 0.0001568

0.003136 * 0.006 = 0.000018816

Adding those gives 0.000175616. So 0.056^3 = 0.000175616 m³.

So Q = 14.1e-12 C/m³ * π * 0.000175616 m³.

Wait, the units: (C/m³) * m³ = C, so the units are correct.

Now compute the numerical value.

14.1e-12 * π * 0.000175616.

Let me compute 14.1e-12 * 0.000175616 first.

14.1e-12 is 1.41e-11. 1.41e-11 * 0.000175616.

Wait, 0.000175616 is 1.75616e-4.

Multiplying 1.41e-11 by 1.75616e-4: (1.41 * 1.75616) × 1e-15.

Let me compute 1.41 *1.75616.

1.41 * 1.75616:

1 * 1.75616 = 1.75616.

0.41 * 1.75616 ≈ 0.41 *1.756 = approx 0.72076.

So total is approx 1.75616 + 0.72076 = 2.47692.

Wait, let me do it more accurately:

1.41 × 1.75616.

Break 1.41 into 1 + 0.4 + 0.01.

1.75616 × 1 = 1.75616.

1.75616 × 0.4 = 0.702464.

1.75616 × 0.01 = 0.0175616.

Adding them: 1.75616 + 0.702464 = 2.458624; plus 0.0175616 gives 2.4761856.

So approximately 2.4761856.

So the product is 2.4761856e-15 C.

Wait, but wait, no: the initial 1.41e-11 is multiplied by 1.75616e-4.

So 1.41e-11 * 1.75616e-4 = (1.41 * 1.75616) * 1e-15.

Which is 2.4761856 * 1e-15 C → 2.4761856e-15 C.

Now, multiply by π: 2.4761856e-15 * 3.14159265 ≈ 7.778e-15 C.

Wait wait a second, because 2.476e-15 multiplied by π is approximately 2.476 * 3.1416 ≈ 7.777e-15 C.

So that's 7.777e-15 coulombs.

But wait, wait. Wait, what's the unit? Oh, because 1 Coulomb is 1e-9 microcoulombs. But wait, the options are given in fC (picocoulombs). So 1 fC is 1e-15 C.

So 7.777e-15 C is the same as 7.777 fC. Hmm, looking at the options, option F is 7.78 fC.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation because sometimes it's easy to miss a step.

Wait, let me redo the calculation.

Compute R^3: R is 0.056 m.

0.056^3 = 0.056 * 0.056 = 0.003136. 0.003136 * 0.056 = 0.000175616 m³.

So R^3 = 0.000175616 m³.

Then, the integral expression:

Q = (14.1e-12) * π * R^3.

So 14.1e-12 is 1.41e-11 C/m³.

Multiply by π: 1.41e-11 * 3.14159265 ≈ 4.43e-11.

Then multiply by R^3: 4.43e-11 * 0.000175616.

Wait, 0.000175616 is 1.75616e-4.

So 4.43e-11 * 1.75616e-4 = ?

Multiply 4.43 *1.75616 = ?

Well, 4 * 1.75616 is 7.02464. 0.43 *1.75616 is approx 0.7549.

Adding those gives 7.02464 + 0.7549 = 7.77954.

So 4.43 * 1.75616 ≈7.77954.

So the product is 7.77954e-15 C → 7.77954 fC.

Looking at the options, option F is 7.78 fC. So that's the closest match.

Wait, but let me see the options again:

Option F is 7.78 fC. So that's the correct answer.

To determine the total charge of the solid nonconducting sphere, we use the given volume charge density, which varies as:

\[
\rho = \left(14.1 \, \mathrm{pC}/\mathrm{m}^3\right) \frac{r}{R}.
\]

### Step 1: Convert Units
- \(1 \, \mathrm{pC} = 1 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{C}\), so \(14.1 \, \mathrm{pC} = 14.1 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{C}/\mathrm{m}^3\).
- The radius \(R = 5.60 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.056 \, \mathrm{m}\).

### Step 2: Total Charge Formula
The total charge is calculated by integrating the charge density over the volume of the sphere:

\[
Q = \int_0^R \rho(r) \, dV.
\]

For a spherical volume element, \(dV = 4\pi r^2 \, dr\). Substituting \(\rho(r)\), the integral becomes:

\[
Q = \int_0^R \left(14.1 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{C}/\mathrm{m}^3 \cdot \frac{r}{R}\right) \cdot 4\pi r^2 \, dr.
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
Q = \frac{14.1 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 4\pi}{R} \int_0^R r^3 \, dr.
\]

The integral \(\int_0^R r^3 \, dr = \frac{R^4}{4}\), so:

\[
Q = \frac{14.1 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 4\pi}{R} \cdot \frac{R^4}{4}.
\]

Simplify further:

\[
Q = 14.1 \times 10^{-12} \cdot \pi \cdot R^3.
\]

### Step 3: Substitute \(R = 0.056 \, \mathrm{m}\)
\[
R^3 = (0.056)^3 = 0.000175616 \, \mathrm{m}^3.
\]

Substitute into the equation:

\[
Q = 14.1 \times 10^{-12} \cdot \pi \cdot 0.000175616.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the Numerical Value
First, calculate \(14.1 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 0.000175616\):

\[
14.1 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 0.000175616 = 2.4761856 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C}.
\]

Multiply by \(\pi\):

\[
Q = 2.4761856 \times 10^{-15} \cdot 3.14159265 \approx 7.777 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C}.
\]

Convert to picocoulombs (\(1 \, \mathrm{fC} = 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C}\)):

\[
Q \approx 7.777 \, \mathrm{fC}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with Options
The closest option to \(7.777 \, \mathrm{fC}\) is **7.78 fC**.
