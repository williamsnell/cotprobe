Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says: The weight percent of sodium hydroxide dissolved in water is 50%. What is the mole fraction of sodium hydroxide? The options are A to I, with various decimal values.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think. Weight percent, or percent by mass, is grams of solute per 100 grams of solution. So in this case, 50% NaOH means 50 grams of NaOH in 100 grams of solution.

I need to find the mole fraction. I remember that mole fraction is the moles of the solute divided by the total moles of all substances in the solution. So, total moles = moles of NaOH + moles of water.

Wait, but I don't know the mass of water. The solution is 100g, but what's the mass of water? Oh, right, the solution is mostly water, but I need to calculate the moles accurately.

So, let's break it down. NaOH is 50g. Let's find its moles. The molar mass of NaOH. Sodium is about 23, oxygen 16, hydrogen 1. So 23 + 16 + 1 = 40 g/mol. So 50g /40g/mol = 1.25 moles of NaOH.

Now, the solution is 100g, so the mass of water is 100g - 50g =50g. Wait, but wait, isn't that an assumption? Maybe the solution is 50% by mass, so 50g NaOH and 50g H2O. Yeah, that makes sense, because 50g/100g solution would be 50% NaOH.

So the mass of water is 50g. Moles of water would be 50g / 18 g/mol (since H2O is about 18). 50 / 18 is approximately 2.777... moles.

So total moles = 1.25 + 2.777 = 4.027 moles.

So mole fraction of NaOH is moles NaOH / total moles. That's 1.25 / 4.027. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 1.25 divided by 4.027. Let me compute that. 4.027 is approximately 4.027. 1.25 ÷ 4.027 = about 0.3108. So approximately 0.3108.

Looking at the options, the closest option is A: 0.311. So the answer should be A.

Wait, did I make any mistakes? Let me double-check. Maybe the mass of water isn't 50g. Oh wait, because the solution is 50% by weight, the solution is 50g NaOH and 50g water. That makes sense because the solution's total mass is 100g.

Molar masses: NaOH is 40g/mol, H2O is 18g/mol. So 50g/40 =1.25, 50/18≈2.777. Total 4.027. 1.25/4.027 ≈0.3108, which rounds to 0.311, so option A.

But wait, another thought: could the solution be considered as 50% by weight, so each component contributes to the solution. For instance, if the solution is a mixture of water and NaOH, but maybe the way I calculated is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of water isn't exactly 50g. Wait, but the problem says the solution is 50% by weight. So yes, 50g of NaOH in 50g of H2O. Because the solution is 100g, 50% of that is the solute.

So the calculation looks correct. So the mole fraction is approximately 0.311, which is option A.

To determine the mole fraction of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in a 50% (by mass) solution, we start by noting the following:

1. **Masses in the solution**: The solution is 100 g, with 50 g of NaOH and 50 g of water.

2. **Molar masses**:
   - NaOH: Molar mass = 23 (Na) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 40 g/mol.
   - Water (H₂O): Molar mass = 2 (H) + 16 (O) = 18 g/mol.

3. **Moles of NaOH**:  
   Moles = mass / molar mass = 50 g / 40 g/mol = 1.25 mol.

4. **Moles of water**:  
   Moles = mass / molar mass = 50 g / 18 g/mol ≈ 2.777 mol.

5. **Total moles**:  
   Total moles = moles of NaOH + moles of water = 1.25 mol + 2.777 mol ≈ 4.027 mol.

6. **Mole fraction of NaOH**:  
   Mole fraction = moles of NaOH / total moles = 1.25 mol / 4.027 mol ≈ 0.3108.

7. **Approximation**:  
   Rounding to three decimal places, the mole fraction is approximately 0.311.

From the given options, the closest match is **0.311**, which corresponds to option A.
