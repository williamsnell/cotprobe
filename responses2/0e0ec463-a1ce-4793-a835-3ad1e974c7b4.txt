Question:

The second cosmic velocity (or escape velocity) is the speed required by an object to escape the gravitational field of a celestial body with mass M and radius R. Which formula correctly calculates this velocity? (G: gravitational constant)

Options:

A: v = 2sqrt(GM/R)
B: v = sqrt(GM/2R)
C: v = sqrt(2GM/R)
D: v = sqrt(GM*R)
E: v = sqrt(GM/R)
F: v = sqrt(GM)
G: v = 2GM/R
H: v = sqrt(GM/2)
I: v = 2sqrt(2GM/R)
J: v = sqrt(2GM)

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the escape velocity, the second cosmic velocity. Hmm, I remember that escape velocity is the speed needed for an object to break free from a planet's gravity. But wait, what exactly is the formula?

I think the formula involves the gravitational constant, mass, and radius. Oh right, the escape velocity is calculated as sqrt(2GM/R). Let me think where I got this from. Oh yeah, from the physics equations because escape velocity is the speed needed for the kinetic energy plus potential energy to equal zero.

Looking at the options: option I is sqrt(2GM/R), which matches that formula. Let me check the others. Option E is sqrt(GM/R), which is the square root of half the escape velocity squared. Option A is 2 times sqrt(GM/R), which would make it four times the previous one. Hmm, why would that be?

Wait, no. The escape velocity is the square root of twice GM over R. So I think option I is correct. The other options don't seem to fit. For example, option B and C have 2 in the denominator, which would make their squares bigger than I, but I think the correct formula is without the 2 in the denominator. 

So, the correct answer should be option I: v = sqrt(2GM/R).

The escape velocity is the speed needed to break free from a celestial body's gravitational influence. The correct formula for the escape velocity is derived from the balance between kinetic and gravitational potential energy. The formula is:

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$$

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I** matches this formula: \(v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}\).
- Other options either have incorrect factors (e.g., 2 in the denominator, incorrect scaling) or represent different concepts (e.g., gravitational acceleration).

Thus, the correct answer is **I: v = sqrt(2GM/R)**.

Answer: I
