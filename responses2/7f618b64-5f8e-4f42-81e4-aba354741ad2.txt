Okay, so I have this question about work management and what ensures that one individual doesn't carry the burden of a whole work task. Let me try to break it down.

The question is asking for a term that prevents a single person from taking on the entire workload of a task. The options are A to J. I remember from my studies that work management strategies are important in teams, so I'll think about each option.

Work delegation (A) is when others take on the work, which might reduce the workload on one person. Workload balancing (B) spreads tasks so different people handle parts of it. Work distribution (C) sounds like it divides tasks among team members. Work specialisation (D) is when people focus on one task, which could mean carrying more. Work rotation (E) switches who does what, so no one is overloaded. Work redundancy (F) is about having backup plans, but that's more about reliability than burden on individuals. Work shift (G) might be about time zones, not directly about burden. Work design (H) is about how tasks are planned, but I'm not sure. Work schedule (I) is about timing, but again, not directly about burden distribution. Work design (H) might refer to planning strategies, but I'm not certain.

So, the question is asking what ensures that no one carries the entire burden. Work division (B) and work distribution (C) both seem relevant, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact meaning. Work division could mean dividing tasks, which might reduce the burden. Work distribution, on the other hand, is about spreading responsibilities, perhaps more about the structure of tasks.

Wait, work division (B) might imply assigning parts of a task to different people, reducing the load on one person. Work distribution (C) could mean assigning tasks without overload. Alternatively, work rotation (E) shifts who does what, so no one is doing everything at once.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Work delegation (A) is when others do the work, so no one has to do it alone. Work division (B) is splitting a task into parts, so each part is handled by someone else. Work distribution (C) is assigning tasks to different people. Work rotation (E) is switching tasks, preventing someone from having to do everything.

Wait, the question is about ensuring that one individual doesn't carry the burden. So, perhaps work division (B) ensures that tasks are split, so each person doesn't have to do the whole task. Work distribution (C) is similar. Alternatively, work rotation (E) is a strategy to prevent someone from having to handle everything.

I'm a bit stuck between B and C. Work division might be more about structuring tasks, while work distribution is about assigning tasks without overloading. Wait, the question is about ensuring that a single person doesn't carry the burden. So, if someone is assigned to do all parts of a task, they carry the burden. Work division would split the task, so each person doesn't have to do it all. Work distribution might be about assigning tasks without someone handling everything. Alternatively, work rotation would involve switching who does what, preventing someone from being overloaded.

Wait, another angle: Work division (B) is when tasks are divided among team members. So, each member doesn't have to do the whole task. Similarly, work distribution (C) is about assigning each person a part of the task. So, both B and C seem correct, but I need to choose the best fit.

Alternatively, work rotation (E) is about rotating tasks, so no one does everything. So, that could prevent someone from carrying the entire load.

Wait, the question is about what ensures that one individual doesn't carry the burden. So, work division and work rotation both prevent someone from having to do the entire task.

But looking at the options, B is work division, C is work distribution. Wait, I think I read that work division (B) and work distribution (C) are both correct. But I need to pick the answer from A to J.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous, but I think the correct answer is work division (B) or work distribution (C). Wait, I'm trying to remember from my classes. Work division is when a task is broken into smaller parts, each handled by a different person. Work distribution is more about assigning parts of a task to different people.

Alternatively, work rotation (E) is when tasks are rotated, so no one does everything. So, that could prevent someone from carrying the entire load.

Wait, the question is about what ensures that one individual doesn't carry the burden. So, work division and work rotation both prevent that. But the options are A to J, and I need to pick the one that fits.

Wait, I think the question is about work division. Work division (B) is when a task is divided into parts, each handled by a different team member, so none of them have to do the entire task. Work distribution (C) might refer to assigning tasks without overloading, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit.

Alternatively, work rotation (E) is a strategy to prevent someone from having to do everything. So, E is a way to prevent carrying the burden.

Wait, but the question is about what ensures that. So, work division (B) and work distribution (C) both prevent carrying the burden.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think of each option. Work delegation (A) allows others to handle tasks, so no one does it. But the question is about ensuring that no one carries the burden, which is about distributing the work, not delegating.

Work division (B) divides tasks, so each person doesn't have to do everything. Work distribution (C) also divides tasks. Work rotation (E) shifts tasks, preventing someone from doing everything.

Wait, the question is asking what "ensures" that a person doesn't carry the burden. So, work division (B) and work rotation (E) both prevent that. But which is more accurate.

Alternatively, work division (B) is the process of breaking down tasks into parts, each handled by a different person. Work distribution (C) is assigning parts of a task. So, both B and C are correct in a way, but I need to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps work division (B) is the answer. Because it's about structuring tasks into parts, so each individual doesn't have to do the whole task.

Alternatively, work distribution (C) is about assigning parts, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think of other options. Work design (H) might refer to planning, but it's more about how tasks are planned, not about the distribution.

I think the correct answer is work division (B). Because it's about structuring the workload into smaller parts, which prevents any one person from carrying the entire burden. Work distribution (C) is similar, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another thought: Work division is when tasks are divided among team members. Work distribution is when tasks are assigned without overload. So, both are about distributing the work.

But perhaps the best answer is work division (B), as it's a common strategy.
</think>

The correct answer is B: Work division. Work division involves structuring tasks into smaller, manageable parts, each assigned to a different individual, which prevents any one person from carrying the entire burden of a task. This strategy ensures that the workload is distributed, reducing the potential for one person to bear the full load.

Answer: B
