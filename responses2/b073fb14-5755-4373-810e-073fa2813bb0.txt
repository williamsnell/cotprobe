Question:

In order to attract males for mating, females of many insect species secrete chemical compounds called pheromones. One compound of formula C_19H_38O (282 g/mole) is among these pheromones, 10-^12 g of it must be present to be effective. How many molecules must be present to be effective?

Options:

A: 10-^12 molecules
B: 6.02 × 10^23 molecules
C: 8.31 × 10^3 molecules
D: 5 × 10^5 molecules
E: 7.28 × 10^8 molecules
F: 9.45 × 10^11 molecules
G: 3.55 × 10-^15 molecules
H: 1.5 × 10^10 molecules
I: 2.12 × 10^9 molecules
J: 4.66 × 10^14 molecules

Okay, so I've got this question about pheromones and how many molecules are needed to be effective. Hmm, let me think. The question says that each pheromone has a formula C₁₉H₃₈O and a molar mass of 282 g/mol. They need 10⁻¹² grams of it to be effective, and I need to find out how many molecules that is.

Wait, right. So I remember that to find the number of molecules, I should use Avogadro's number. Oh yeah, Avogadro's number is about 6.022 × 10²³ molecules per mole. So the plan is to find the number of moles of the pheromone in 10⁻¹² grams, then multiply by Avogadro's number to get the number of molecules.

First, I need to find out how many moles are in 10⁻¹² grams. The formula for moles is mass divided by molar mass. So moles = (10⁻¹² g) / (282 g/mol). Let me calculate that. 10⁻¹² divided by 282. Let me write that down: 1e-12 / 282 = approximately 3.548e-15 moles. Because 1/282 is about 0.003548, so 1e-12 times that is 3.548e-15.

Now, to find the number of molecules, I multiply moles by Avogadro's number. So 3.548e-15 moles * 6.022e23 molecules/mol. Let's compute that. 3.548e-15 times 6.022e23. 

Wait, exponent rules: 1e-15 * 1e23 = 1e8. So 3.548 *6.022 is approximately 21.43. So 21.43e8, which is 2.143e9 molecules.

Looking at the options, option I is 2.12 × 10^9 molecules. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the exponent. Let me recheck. 10⁻¹² divided by 282 is about 3.548e-15. Multiply by 6.022e23 gives (3.548 *6.022) * 1e8. 3.548 *6 is about 21.288, so 21.288e8 is 2.1288e9, which rounds to 2.13e9. So option I is 2.12e9, which matches closely. So I think I is correct.

To determine the number of molecules of the pheromone (C₁₉H₃₈O with a molar mass of 282 g/mol) required to be effective (10⁻¹² g), use the following steps:

1. **Calculate moles:**  
   Moles = mass / molar mass = (10⁻¹² g) / (282 g/mol) ≈ 3.548 × 10⁻¹⁵ mol.

2. **Calculate molecules:**  
   Number of molecules = moles × Avogadro's number = (3.548 × 10⁻¹⁵ mol) × (6.022 × 10²³ molecules/mol).  
   This gives approximately 2.143 × 10⁹ molecules.

3. **Match with options:**  
   Option I corresponds to 2.12 × 10⁹ molecules, which is the closest value to the calculated result.
