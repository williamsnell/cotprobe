Okay, so I've got this question about economics, specifically about consumer choice and utility maximization. Hmm, let's think through it.

The question is asking when the total utility from sardines is maximized. The options are various economic conceptsâ€”like marginal benefit equals marginal cost, or price is zero. I remember from my studies that utility maximization happens when the last unit gives the same satisfaction as the next one. So, I think that relates to marginal utility.

Wait, marginal utility is the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit. So, the point where the marginal utility of sardines is zero would mean that the last unit doesn't add any satisfaction. But wait, if marginal utility is zero, does that mean total utility is maximized? Or is it the point where the last unit gives the same utility as the previous one?

Oh right! The point where marginal benefit equals marginal cost is the correct condition for maximizing utility. Because marginal benefit is the additional utility from one more unit, and marginal cost is the additional cost. So, when they're equal, each additional unit gives the same amount of satisfaction in terms of utility as it costs in terms of cost. That makes total utility maximized.

Looking at the options, option I says "marginal utility equals marginal cost." That sounds right. But wait, sometimes in economics, when you're talking about total utility, the condition is where the marginal utility is equal to the marginal cost. Because beyond that, you start getting diminishing returns.

Wait, another thought: total utility is maximized when the marginal utility is zero. No, that's not right. Because when marginal utility is zero, it means the last unit gives no additional satisfaction, but total utility might be higher if the previous units contributed more. So, that's not the condition for maximizing total utility.

Alternatively, when the marginal utility is equal to the marginal cost, that's when the last unit's satisfaction in terms of utility matches the cost of producing it. So, that point is where the total utility is maximized.

So the correct answer is option I: marginal utility equals marginal cost.

The correct answer is **I: marginal utility equals marginal cost**. This is because when marginal utility equals marginal cost, the last unit provides the same additional satisfaction as the cost of producing it, indicating the point where total utility is maximized.
