Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the difference in molar Gibbs energy between a real gas and a perfect gas at a certain state. Hmm, I should probably start by recalling what I know about fugacity and the Gibbs energy.

Wait, the question says that the fugacity coefficient (phi) is 0.72. Right, the fugacity coefficient is a measure of how much a real gas deviates from ideal behavior. For a perfect gas, phi is exactly 1. 

I remember that the molar Gibbs energy (G) for a real gas is related to that of an ideal gas (g). Oh right, the formula is G = g + RT ln(phi). Because the Gibbs energy accounts for the work done against the external pressure, and for real gases, you have to consider the fugacity instead of the actual pressure. So the difference between the Gibbs energy of the real gas and the ideal gas would be RT times the natural log of the fugacity coefficient.

Wait, so the change in Gibbs energy (ΔG) would be G_real - G_perfect = (g_real + RT ln(phi_real)) - (g_ideal + RT ln(phi_ideal)). Since phi_ideal is 1, ln(1) is zero. So it simplifies to RT (ln(phi_real) - ln(1)) = RT ln(phi_real). But wait, wait, I think I got that right. Let me double-check. Oh right, no, wait. The formula I think is for the difference in Gibbs energy between the real and ideal. So G_real - G_ideal would be RT ln(phi_real) because phi_ideal is 1.

So the change is RT ln(phi). But wait, wait, another thought: the Gibbs energy of the real gas is G_real = g + RT ln(phi), and the ideal gas's Gibbs energy is g. So the difference would be (g + RT ln(phi)) - g = RT ln(phi). 

Wait no, that doesn't seem right. Because G for real gas is g + RT ln(phi), but wait, isn't that the other way around? Or am I mixing up the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is that the real Gibbs energy is g + RT ln(phi), and the ideal is g. So the difference is RT ln(phi). But wait, the question is about the difference of its molar Gibbs energy from that of a perfect gas, meaning G_real - G_perfect. So that would be RT ln(phi). 

Wait, but wait another thing. The formula I think is G = g + RT ln phi. So for real and ideal, G_real = g + RT ln phi_real, and G_ideal = g_ideal + RT ln phi_ideal. Since phi_ideal is 1, ln(1) is 0, so G_ideal is just g. So the difference is G_real - G_ideal = (g + RT ln phi) - g = RT ln phi.

So the question is, what's RT ln(phi) in kJ/mol?

Wait, the given data is at 200 K. The formula for Gibbs energy change would be RT ln(phi). Let me compute that. 

But wait, the given phi is 0.72. So ln(0.72) is what? Let me calculate that. Let's see, natural logarithm of 0.72. I know that ln(1) is 0, ln(e^-0.3) is about -0.3 (since e^-0.3 ≈ 0.74, but 0.72 is a bit lower). Let me compute it more accurately. 

Using a calculator: ln(0.72) is approximately -0.328 (I think). Let me check with a Taylor series approximation or just remember that ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, ln(0.72) is about -0.328, maybe -0.329.

So RT is 8.314 J/mol·K multiplied by 200 K. Let me compute that: 8.314 * 200 = 1662.8 J/mol. Which is 1.6628 kJ/mol.

So RT ln(phi) is 1.6628 kJ/mol * (-0.328) ≈ -0.545 kJ/mol. Wait, but wait, let me compute it precisely.

Wait, 8.314 * 200 = 1662.8 J/mol, which is 1.6628 kJ/mol. Multiply by ln(0.72). Let me calculate ln(0.72) exactly. Let's say it's approximately -0.32859.

So 1.6628 * (-0.32859) = ?

Let me compute 1.6628 * 0.32859.

Hmm, 1.6628 * 0.3 = 0.49884; 1.6628 * 0.02859 ≈ 0.0473. So total is approximately 0.54614. But since it's negative, it's -0.54614 kJ/mol.

Looking at the answer options, let's look for approximately -0.55 kJ/mol. Option C is -0.55 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait. The options list (A to J), and looking again:

A: -0.95
B: -0.35
C: -0.55
D: -0.25
E: -0.85
F: -0.45
G: -0.65
H: -0.05
I: -0.75
J: -0.15

So option C is -0.55 kJ/mol. 

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the calculation. Because the formula is G_real - G_ideal = RT ln(phi). Since phi is 0.72, which is less than 1, ln(phi) is negative. So the Gibbs energy is lower (more negative) for the real gas. So the difference is negative, which matches option C. Hmm, but wait, the options are all negative. So the calculated value is RT ln(phi), which is negative. So the molar Gibbs energy of the real gas is lower than the ideal gas, so the difference is negative.

So the answer is -0.55 kJ/mol, which is option C.

To calculate the difference in molar Gibbs energy between a real gas and an ideal gas at 200 K and 50 bar, we use the relationship:

\[
\Delta G = RT \ln(\phi)
\]

where \( \phi \) is the fugacity coefficient, \( R \) is the gas constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For a perfect gas, \( \phi = 1 \), and \( \ln(1) = 0 \), so the molar Gibbs energy of a perfect gas is simply \( G \). For the real gas, the molar Gibbs energy is \( G_{\text{real}} = g + RT \ln(\phi) \), and for the perfect gas, it is \( G_{\text{perfect}} = g \). The difference in Gibbs energy is:

\[
\Delta G = G_{\text{real}} - G_{\text{perfect}} = RT \ln(\phi)
\]

### Key steps:
1. **Given Data**:
   - \( \phi = 0.72 \)
   - \( T = 200 \, \text{K} \)
   - \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} = 1.6628 \, \text{kJ/mol·K} \)

2. **Calculate \( RT \)**:
   \[
   RT = 1.6628 \, \text{kJ/mol·K} \times 200 \, \text{K} = 332.56 \, \text{kJ/mol}
   \]

3. **Compute \( \ln(\phi) \)**:
   \[
   \ln(0.72) \approx -0.32859
   \]

4. **Calculate \( \Delta G \)**:
   \[
   \Delta G = RT \ln(\phi) = 332.56 \, \text{kJ/mol} \times (-0.32859) \approx -109.8 \, \text{kJ/mol}
   \]

   However, this result is inconsistent with the provided options, which are in the range of \( -0.55 \, \text{kJ/mol} \). This discrepancy suggests a miscalculation in the approach.

### Re-examining the Formula:
The correct formula for the difference in molar Gibbs energy is:

\[
\Delta G = RT \ln(\phi)
\]

where \( \phi \) is the ratio of the real gas fugacity to the ideal gas fugacity (which is 1 for an ideal gas). For a real gas, the fugacity is less than the actual pressure, so \( \phi < 1 \), and \( \ln(\phi) \) is negative. Thus, the difference in Gibbs energy is negative, indicating that the real gas has lower Gibbs energy than the ideal gas.

### Recomputing with Correct Units:
Using \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} = 0.008314 \, \text{kJ/mol·K} \), the calculation becomes:

\[
RT = 0.008314 \, \text{kJ/mol·K} \times 200 \, \text{K} = 1.6628 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

\[
\ln(0.72) \approx -0.32859
\]

\[
\Delta G = RT \ln(\phi) = 1.6628 \, \text{kJ/mol} \times (-0.32859) \approx -0.546 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

The closest option to this value is \( -0.55 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).

### Final Answer:
ANSWER: C
