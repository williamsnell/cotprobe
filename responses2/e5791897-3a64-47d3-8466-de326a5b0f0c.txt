Question:

Suppose the market price for corn drops from $1,00per bushel to $.75 per bushel. In reaction to this, the farmers decide to sell one third less corn to the market. Has the supply of corn to the market decrease?

Options:

A: The supply of corn to the market has increased.
B: No, the supply of corn to the market has not decreased.
C: Yes, the supply of corn to the market has decreased.
D: The supply of corn to the market remained the same.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about the supply of corn when the market price drops. Let me break it down. 

The question says that the market price for corn goes from $1,00 per bushel to $0.75 per bushel. And farmers decide to sell one third less corn to the market. The question is whether this means the supply has decreased. The options are A to D, with C being the correct answer. 

Wait, what's supply? Supply is the amount of a product that producers are willing to sell at a given price. So when the price drops, I remember that usually, producers might reduce their supply because lower prices can make it more profitable for them to sell less, or they might choose to keep their prices lower.

In this case, the price went down by a significant amount. It's from $1,000 to $0.75. That's a big change. So Farmer John, for example, would probably sell less if the price is lower, but also, maybe they would adjust their quantities if the change isn't too drastic. 

The question states that farmers sell one third less corn. So if they were selling X before, now they sell (2/3)X. That's a decrease in the quantity sold. So the total amount they're selling would be less, but isn't that a decrease in supply? Or could it be a change in the price per bushel affecting their total supply?

Wait, the supply curve is about the quantity supplied at each price level. So if the price drops, the supply could decrease, but it depends on the responsiveness of farmers to the price change. If farmers are very responsive to price changes, they might adjust their quantities more.

In this scenario, the price drops a lot, and they're selling a third less. That suggests that the quantity supplied has decreased. But wait, not necessarily the entire quantity. Because when the price drops, the quantity supplied might decrease, but that's the same as the supply curve shifting left. 

Wait, but in this question, the farmers are selling less. So maybe the supply is the same? No, that doesn't make sense. Because when price goes down, supply goes down. Unless the farmers are using the lower price to reduce their amount sold. Alternatively, perhaps the supply is the same because they're still selling the same amount but just at a lower price. But that depends on whether the supply curve is vertical or horizontal. 

Wait, no. The supply curve is vertical because it's the quantity supplied at each price. So if the price drops, the farmer's quantity supplied for a given price point decreases. But if the price drops a lot, maybe the quantity supplied increases. Hmm, no, that's not right. When price goes down, assuming all else equal, quantity supplied decreases because it's the law of supply. So if the farmers are selling less, that means the quantity they are willing to sell at the new lower price is lower than before. 

Wait, but the question is about the supply of corn to the market. If the market price changes, the quantity supplied would change according to the supply curve. Let me think about this. The supply curve tells us the quantity supplied at each price. So if the market price goes down, the quantity supplied will decrease at that price. But if the farmers are selling less, that would imply that at the new lower price, they're selling less than before. 

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let's think about a specific example. Suppose originally, when the price was $1,000, farmers were willing to supply 300 bushels. Now, when the price drops to $0.75, they're willing to supply 200 bushels. So the quantity supplied has decreased. That would mean the supply has decreased. But the question is not about the quantity supplied at a specific price, but whether the total supply (the amount that will be sold at the new price) has decreased. 

In the question, the price drops, and the farmers decide to sell less. So at the new price, they're selling less. So the quantity supplied at the new price is lower than before. So the total amount that will be sold (quantity supplied) has decreased. So the supply has decreased. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. What's the difference between supply and quantity supplied? Quantity supplied is the amount a producer is willing to sell at a certain price. So if the price drops, the quantity supplied at that new price will be lower. The total amount sold would decrease because each seller is selling less.

So if the market price drops, each individual seller is selling less, which in aggregate leads to a decrease in total quantity sold. So the market supply has decreased. 

In this question, the farmers are selling less, implying that their total supply (the quantity) has decreased. So the answer would be C: Yes, supply has decreased. 

Wait, but the question is about whether the supply of corn to the market has decreased. The supply curve would reflect the quantity supplied at each price. So if the market price is now lower, the quantity that will be supplied is the amount farmers are willing to sell. So in this case, since they're selling one third less, the quantity supplied now is less. So the supply has decreased. 

So the correct answer should be C: Yes, the supply of corn to the market has decreased.

The question examines whether a drop in the market price of corn leads to a decrease in the supply of corn to the market. When the price drops, farmers typically reduce the amount of corn they are willing to sell, as lower prices make it more profitable for them to sell less or choose to keep prices lower. In this scenario, the farmers decide to sell one-third less corn, indicating a reduction in the quantity they are willing to sell at the new, lower price.

The supply curve reflects the quantity of corn that producers are willing to sell at each price. When the market price drops, the quantity supplied decreases because producers are less willing to sell at the lower price. The fact that farmers are selling one-third less corn implies that the total quantity supplied has indeed decreased.

Thus, the correct answer is that the supply of corn to the market has decreased.
