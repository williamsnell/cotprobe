Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, a stone is thrown horizontally from a bridge. I remember that when you throw something horizontally, both horizontal and vertical motions happen. Oh wait, and since air resistance is negligible, that simplifies things because I don't have to worry about any forces acting against the motion except gravity.

The question is asking how long it takes for the stone to hit the water. The bridge is 80 meters below, so I guess the vertical distance is 80 meters. The initial speed is 10 m/s, but I think that's the horizontal component. Wait, no, the initial speed is horizontal, so the horizontal velocity remains constant because there's no air resistance. The vertical motion is influenced by gravity.

Wait, no, the initial speed is horizontal, so the vertical component is zero. So the vertical motion is only due to acceleration due to gravity. I'm trying to remember how to find the time it takes to fall a certain distance.

Oh right! The formula for the distance fallen under constant acceleration (which is gravity in this case) is s = 0.5 * g * t². Because the initial vertical velocity is zero. So s is the displacement, which is 80 meters here.

Wait, so s equals 80 m equals 0.5 * g * t². Oh, wait, the standard formula is s = (1/2) g t². So I can rearrange this to solve for t.

So t squared equals 2s divided by g. Let me plug in the numbers. s is 80 m, g is approximately 9.8 m/s².

t squared = (2 * 80) / 9.8. Let me calculate that. 2 times 80 is 160. Divided by 9.8, so 160/9.8. Hmm, what's that approximately? Well, 9.8 times 16 is 156.8 (since 9.8 * 16 = 156.8). So 160-156.8=3.2. So 160/9.8 is about 16.3265. So t squared is approximately 16.3265.

Taking the square root of that: t is about sqrt(16.3265). Well, sqrt(16) is 4, sqrt(17) is about 4.123, so sqrt(16.3265) is probably around 4.04 seconds. So around 4 seconds.

Looking at the options, option E is 4 s. So the correct answer should be E.

To determine the time it takes for the stone to strike the water, we analyze the vertical motion under gravity, ignoring air resistance. The vertical displacement \( s \) is 80 m, and the initial vertical velocity \( v_{0y} \) is zero. Using the kinematic equation:

\[
s = \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

where \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), we solve for \( t \):

\[
t^2 = \frac{2s}{g} = \frac{2 \times 80}{9.8} \approx 16.3265
\]

\[
t = \sqrt{16.3265} \approx 4.04 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

The closest option to this time is **4 seconds**.
