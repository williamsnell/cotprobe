Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what deindividuation is. I'm not entirely sure, but I remember hearing about it in psychology classes. Let me think through this.

First, I'll look at the options. The question is asking which option correctly defines deindividuation and how it's been tested. The options are A to J, each with a different description.

Hmm, I think deindividuation refers to a situation where a person's sense of morality or identity is enhanced when they are in a group. Wait, let me check each option.

Option A says it's a state where moral sense is enhanced in large groups. That sounds familiar. I remember reading that in group settings, people might feel more aware of their actions and possibly feel more in control, which could contribute to a more moral sense.

Option B talks about cognitive abilities improving due to anonymity. That doesn't seem right. Deindividuation is more about feeling more connected, not necessarily cognitive functions improving.

Option C mentions less personal identity and less concern about others' thoughts. That makes sense because being in a group can lead to a sense of belonging and less self-consciousness.

Option D says becoming more conscious about societal norms. I'm not sure if that's deindividuation. Maybe it's a different concept.

Option E says individuals conform more without anonymity. That sounds like collectivism, not deindividuation.

Option F is about increased self-awareness. That doesn't seem to fit; deindividuation is more about group dynamics, not individual awareness.

Option G claims losing critical thinking due to group influence. That doesn't quite ring a bell. Deindividuation isn't about losing the ability to think critically; it's more about how group influence affects individual sense of responsibility.

Option H suggests increased responsibility in groups. That's interesting, but I'm not sure if that's the standard definition.

Option I says increased responsibility because they're in groups. That's similar to option H, but I don't think that's the primary definition.

Option J talks about heightened aggression and impulsivity in groups. That's more about social comparison and perhaps groupthink, but not deindividuation itself.

So, putting it together: deindividuation is when people feel a stronger sense of their own identity and are less concerned about others' thoughts. Looking at the options, option C fits that description. It says feeling a lessened sense of personal identity and decreased concern about what people think of him or her. That sounds correct.

Wait, I should make sure. I'm trying to remember if there's a term for this. Deindividuation, yes, is a psychological state where group dynamics lead to enhanced sense of identity and less concern about others' thoughts. So option C matches that.

The correct answer is:

C: Deindividuation is a state in which a person feels a lessened sense of personal identity and a decreased concern about what people think of him or her.
