Okay, so I have this question about a skewed smooth distribution that's left-skewed, meaning the tail is extended to the left. The question is asking which statistic has the highest value. The options are a bunch like median, interquartile range, geometric mean, quartile deviation, variance, range, standard deviation, mean, mode, etc.

Hmm, I remember that in a skewed distribution, the mean is pulled towards the tail. Since this is a left-skewed distribution, the mean would be less than the median. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let's think: in a left-skewed distribution, the tail is on the left, so the mean is to the left of the median. So the mean is less than the median. That means the median is higher than the mean.

What about the mode? I think the mode is usually the peak of the distribution. In a skewed distribution, the mode is typically on the right side. So the mode is higher than the median.

Now, the question is about which statistic is the highest. So let's look at each option.

Option A: median. Since we established the median is higher than the mean, this would be a candidate. But wait, the question is about the highest value, so what about other options?

Option B: interquartile range. That's a measure of spread, not a central tendency. So it doesn't affect the central value, so I don't think it's the highest.

Option C: geometric mean. That's another measure of central tendency. I'm not sure how it compares to the median. Maybe it's similar to the mean, but not necessarily higher.

Option D: quartile deviation. That's half the interquartile range, so again, not a central tendency.

Option E: variance. Variance measures spread as well, so it's about how spread out the data is. The question is about the value of a measure of central tendency, so not variance.

Option F: range. Range is the difference between the max and min. It can vary but is influenced by extremes, which in a left-skewed distribution could mean a lower range if the tail is on the left. But the question is about the highest value of a central tendency statistic.

Option G: standard deviation. Similar to variance, it measures spread. So not the highest.

Option H: mean. Since it's left-skewed, the mean is less than the median. So the median is higher than the mean.

Option I: mode. The mode is usually on the right, so it's higher than the median.

So, between the median and the mode, which is higher? Well, in a skewed left distribution, the mode is usually to the right of the median. So the mode is higher than the median. Wait, but that's not possible because the median is the middle value. Let me think about an example. Suppose I have a left-skewed distribution of ages. The mean would be lower than the median. The mode is the most common value. For example, imagine a distribution where most people are 30 but a few are 20. The median would be 30, the mean would be pulled to the left, say 25. The mode is 30. So the mode is higher than the median, which is higher than the mean. So in this case, the highest would be the mode.

Wait, but wait another example. Let's say the distribution is such that the mean is 10, median is 15, mode is 20, but that's not possible because in a left-skewed distribution, the mode is typically the peak. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should think about another example. Suppose the distribution is such that the mean is 10, median is 15, but the mode is 20. But wait, that can't be right because in a left-skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median. So if the mode is the peak, it's usually higher than the median. So the mode would be higher than the median.

So in the question, the options are asking which is the highest. Among the options, the mode is a central tendency measure and is higher than the median. So the highest value would be the mode.

Wait, but wait another point: wait, the mean is pulled to the left. So in a left-skewed, the mean is less than the median. The median is the middle value, so it's higher than the mean. The mode is higher than the median.

So, wait, the options are:

A: median

H: mean

I: mode

So among these, the mode is the highest value. But let me think again. How about the range? If the range is the maximum minus the minimum, and the distribution is left-skewed, the maximum could be a low value, and the minimum is a high value, so the range could be small. But the question is about the highest value of a measure of central tendency. So the highest among the options.

So the mode is higher than the median, which is higher than the mean. So the highest is the mode. So the correct answer is I: mode.
</think>

The correct answer is I: mode. 

In a left-skewed distribution, the mode is the highest value among the options provided. The mode is the peak of the distribution, typically higher than the median, which itself is higher than the mean. The mode is a measure of central tendency and is the highest among these options.
