Okay, so I have this problem here where Jerry read a 200-page book in 10 hours. The question is asking how long it will take him to read a 320-page book at the same rate. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that rates are usually calculated by dividing the amount of work by the time taken. In this case, the work is reading pages, and the time is the hours. So, Jerry reads 200 pages in 10 hours. Let me find his reading rate.

Reading rate would be pages per hour. So I can calculate that by dividing the number of pages by the time. That's 200 pages divided by 10 hours. Let me do that math: 200 / 10 equals 20. So Jerry reads 20 pages per hour.

Now, I need to find out how long it will take him to read 320 pages. Since his rate is 20 pages per hour, I can use the formula: time = total pages / rate. So that's 320 pages divided by 20 pages per hour.

Let me compute that. 320 / 20 equals 16. So it would take him 16 hours to read 320 pages.

Looking at the options provided: A is 22, B is 32, C is 26, D is 16, E is 34, F is 30, G is 24, H is 20, I is 18, J is 28. So the correct answer is D: 16 hours.
