Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about what happens when you use MgSO4·7H2O. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that MgSO4·7H2O is a hygroscopic compound, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. So when you add it to something, it probably picks up water molecules. But what does that do?

I think MgSO4 is magnesium sulfate. Magnesium is a metal, and sulfate is a polyatomic ion. So MgSO4 is magnesium sulfate. When you add water molecules to it, like in the formula MgSO4·7H2O, that's the hydrated form, right? Hydrates are compounds that have water molecules attached to the main compound.

The options are various things like painting a house, cleaning, soaking feet, making soap, etc. I need to figure out which process would most likely involve MgSO4·7H2O.

MgSO4 is commonly used as a source of magnesium, which is a metal ion. Magnesium is used in various applications, like in batteries (magnesium carbonate as an electrolyte), in water treatment (as a source of magnesium ions), and in making soap. It's also used in medicine, like in pain relievers, and in some foods.

Wait, but the compound in question is MgSO4·7H2O. So it's a solid, probably a powder, which is often used in such applications. For example, in soap production, magnesium sulfate is used as a base. So making soap would involve MgSO4, and the hydrated form would be MgSO4·7H2O.

Let's look at the options again. Option G is making soap. That makes sense because MgSO4 is a key component.

Other options: E is power a car. That's probably not related. F is blow up a building—that's obviously unrelated. J is purify water. Pure water probably doesn't involve any salts like MgSO4, so that's unlikely. D is produce electricity. That's related to batteries and such, but MgSO4 is more about ions than electrons.

So the most likely one is option G: make soap.

The compound MgSO4·7H2O, commonly known as magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, is commonly used in applications that require magnesium ions, such as making soap. Its hydrated form is often used in such processes. 

Analyzing the options, the most likely scenario is making soap, which involves MgSO4. The other options are unrelated to the properties of MgSO4·7H2O.

**Answer: G**
