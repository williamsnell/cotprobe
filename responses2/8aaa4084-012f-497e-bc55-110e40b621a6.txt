Okay, so I have this question about channel capacity for an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem states that the channel is a memoryless AWGN channel with an expected output power constraint of P=2. The channel is defined as Y = X + Z, where Z is a Gaussian noise with N(0,1). Also, Z is independent of X. The condition E(Y)^2 ≤ 2, but wait, wait—E(Y^2) is the power constraint. Oh right, because Y is the output, and its mean and variance are important. So Y is the sum of X and Z. 

I remember that for an AWGN channel, the capacity is given by the maximum mutual information between X and Y, or equivalently, the difference between the capacity of the channel without power constraints and the power constraint. The capacity formula is C = (1/2) log2(1 + SNR), where SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the details right. The channel is Y = X + Z, where Z is Gaussian with variance 1. So the noise has variance σ² = 1. The output Y has mean equal to X's mean, but since X is presumably zero-mean (because otherwise, it would complicate things without more info), we can assume X is zero-mean. So the power constraint is on Y's mean squared value. So E(Y)^2 ≤ 2. But wait, if X is zero-mean, then E(Y) is E(X) + E(Z) which is 0+0=0. So the power constraint is E(Y²) ≤ 2. Because Z is N(0,1), so E(Z²) is 1. And since X is zero-mean, the variance of Y would be Var(X) + Var(Z). So Var(Y) = Var(X) + 1.

Ah, so the power constraint is Var(Y) ≤ P = 2. So Var(Y) = E(Y²) = Var(X) + 1 ≤ 2. Thus, Var(X) ≤ 1. But since we're looking for the maximum mutual information, I think we need to find the optimal X that maximizes the mutual information given the power constraint on Y.

Alternatively, the capacity can be directly calculated using the formula C = (1/2) log2(1 + (P_X / P_Z)), but wait, perhaps I need to think about SNR in terms of the power. So the SNR is the ratio of the input power to the noise power. Oh wait, yes, because in the AWGN channel, the capacity is (1/2) log(1 + SNR), where SNR is (P_X / P_Z). So in this case, P_Z is 1 (since Z has variance 1). But wait, what about P_X? The problem states that the expected output power constraint is P=2. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is that the average power of Y is 2. Because the output power constraint is that E(Y)^2 ≤ 2, but since Y is a Gaussian variable, that's the same as saying Var(Y) ≤ 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought Var(Y) = Var(X) + Var(Z) = Var(X) + 1. So if Var(Y) ≤ 2, then Var(X) ≤ 1. So the maximum Var(X) allowed is 1 because higher than that would exceed the power constraint. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because the power constraint is on Y, not X. So in the optimal case, X would be chosen to maximize the mutual information under the constraint that Var(Y) ≤ 2.

Let me think about the mutual information. The mutual information I(X;Y) is given by I(X;Y) = 0.5 log2( (P_X (P_Y + P_X)) / (P_Y - P_X) ) ), but wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, I recall that for an AWGN channel, the capacity is achieved when P_X is chosen optimally given the constraint on Y's power. 

Wait, another approach: the capacity is (1/2) log2(1 + (P_X / P_Z)). Since P_Z is 1, the capacity becomes (1/2) log2(1 + P_X). But wait, that can't be right because in the case where P_X is 0, the SNR is 0, so the capacity would be 0, which makes sense. But that formula might not account for the constraint that P_Y = P_X + P_Z ≤ 2. Because P_Y = P_X (since Z is zero-mean and independent) + 1. So P_Y = P_X + 1 ≤ 2, so P_X ≤ 1.

Wait, but in this case, P_X is allowed up to 1 because P_Y would be 2 when P_X is 1. So the maximum allowed P_X is 1, because beyond that, P_Y would exceed 2.

Wait, but how does that affect the capacity? Let me think. Alternatively, the optimal input distribution is a Gaussian distribution due to the channel's properties. So perhaps the optimal X is Gaussian, which is the case when the input is Gaussian, and the maximum mutual information is achieved.

In that case, the optimal X is such that the input power is allocated in a way that maximizes the mutual information. The capacity formula for AWGN is (1/2) log2(1 + (P_X / P_Z)), but wait, earlier I thought that the capacity is (1/2) log2(1 + SNR), and SNR is P_X / P_Z. But in this case, since P_Y = P_X + P_Z, and P_Y ≤ 2, and P_Z =1, that gives P_X +1 ≤ 2, so P_X ≤1.

Wait, so the maximum P_X is 1. So the SNR is P_X / P_Z = 1/1 =1.

So the capacity should be (1/2) log2(1 + 1) = (1/2) log2(2) = 0.5 bits per channel use.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the options don't have 0.5 as the highest. Wait, the options start from 0.25, and options go up to 3, but 0.5 is an option, choice F.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial reasoning. Let me step back.

The channel is Y = X + Z, where Z is N(0,1), and X is zero-mean (since we're maximizing the mutual information when X is zero-mean). So E(X)=0, and Var(X)=P_X.

The output Y is then X + Z, so Y is N(0, P_X +1), because Var(Y) = Var(X) + Var(Z) = P_X + 1.

The power constraint is on Y: E(Y^2) = Var(Y) ≤ 2. So P_Y = P_X + 1 ≤ 2 => P_X ≤1.

The mutual information I(X;Y) for a AWGN channel is given by the formula:

I(X;Y) = 0.5 * log2(1 + (P_X / P_Y))

Wait, no, because P_Y = P_X + 1. So I(X;Y) = 0.5 * log2(1 + (P_X/(P_X+1))).

But since we're looking to maximize I(X;Y), we need to choose P_X within the constraint P_X ≤1.

Wait, but if I set P_X as 1, then P_Y = 2. So I(X;Y) becomes 0.5 log2(1 + (1/2)) = 0.5 log2(3/2) ≈0.5*0.58496≈ 0.2925 bits.

But wait, that's the mutual information. The channel capacity is the maximum of this, but perhaps we can find a higher value if we choose a lower P_X.

Wait, but in the case where P_X is less than 1, the mutual information would be less than when P_X is 1. So to maximize I(X;Y), P_X should be as large as possible, which is 1.

Hmm, but wait, in that case, the mutual information is 0.2925. But wait, that's the mutual information, and the channel capacity is the maximum mutual information. However, if I use P_X=0, then I(X;Y)=0, which is worse.

Wait, maybe I've confused the capacity formula. Let me think again. The capacity C is (1/2) log2(1 + SNR), where SNR is the ratio between the input power and the noise power. In this case, SNR is P_X / P_Z = P_X /1 = P_X.

But wait, but earlier I considered that the channel's capacity is (1/2) log2(1 + (P_Y / P_Z)). No, that's incorrect. The correct formula is (1/2) log2(1 + (P_X / P_Z)).

Wait, that can't be right because when P_X=1, that gives (1/2) log2(2) = 0.5 bits per channel use. Hmm, but that seems to contradict the earlier calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the capacity is (1/2) log2(1 + (P_X + P_Z)), but no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the definition. The capacity is the maximum of I(X;Y) over all input distributions with E[X^2] ≤ P_X.

In the case of AWGN channels, the optimal input distribution is Gaussian, and the capacity is (1/2) log2(1 + (P_X / P_Z)), where P_Z is the power of the noise. So in this case, P_Z is 1 (since Z is N(0,1)), and P_X is the input power.

But wait, the power constraint is on Y, which is P_Y = P_X + P_Z = P_X +1 ≤ 2. So P_X ≤1.

So the optimal P_X is 1, which gives (1/2) log2(1 + (1/1)) = (1/2) log2(2) = 0.5 bits per channel use.

But wait, that's 0.5, which is option F. However, I'm not sure because sometimes the formula is (1/2) log2(1 + (P_X + P_Z)/P_Z)}, which would be (1/2) log2(1 + (P_X +1)/1) = (1/2) log2(1 + P_X +1) = (1/2) log2(2 + P_X). But that doesn't make sense because if P_X is 1, then 2+1=3, log2(3)=1.58, *0.5 is 0.79, which is not one of the options. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the channel capacity. For an AWGN channel, the capacity is (1/2) log2(1 + SNR), where SNR is (P_X / (σ^2_Z)).

But wait, in this problem, the noise variance is 1. So SNR is P_X / 1 = P_X.

But the constraint is on the output power, which is P_Y = P_X + 1 ≤2. So P_X ≤1.

So the optimal P_X is 1, so SNR is 1, and capacity is (1/2) log2(1+1) = 0.5 bits per channel use.

Wait, but that's the same result as before. So the channel capacity is 0.5 bits, which is option F.

But wait, another approach: maybe I should compute the capacity using the formula with the power constraint. The capacity is (1/2) log2(1 + (P_X / P_Z)).

Wait, but if P_Y = P_X + P_Z, then the channel is Y = X + Z, with Z being the noise. So in terms of the SNR, it's P_X / P_Z. So the capacity formula is (1/2) log2(1 + (P_X / P_Z)).

Wait, no, that can't be right because in this case, P_Y = P_X + P_Z is the power, but SNR is (P_X)/(P_Z). So the capacity is (1/2) log2(1 + (P_X / P_Z)).

But since P_Y = P_X +1, and P_Y ≤2, then P_X ≤1.

So when P_X is 1, the capacity is 0.5 log2(2) = 0.5 bits.

But wait, earlier I thought that when P_X is 1, the capacity is 0.5. But let me check: if P_X is 1, then the input is a Gaussian with variance 1. The output is a Gaussian with variance 2. The SNR is 1/1=1. So the capacity is 0.5 log2(1+1)=0.5*1=0.5.

So I think that's correct. So the channel capacity is 0.5 bits per channel use. Looking back at the options, option F is 0.5.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the formula had the SNR in a different way. Let me think again. If the input is zero mean and Gaussian, the SNR is P_X / P_Z. So yes, that's correct. So 0.5 log2(1 + (P_X / P_Z)), which is 0.5 log2(2) = 0.5. So the answer should be F:0.5.

The problem involves an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with a power constraint on the output, \( P_Y^2 \leq 2 \). The channel is defined as \( Y = X + Z \), where \( Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \) (i.e., zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance 1), and \( X \) is assumed to be zero-mean. The goal is to determine the channel capacity.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Power Constraint on Output**:  
   The output power constraint is \( \mathbb{E}[Y^2] \leq 2 \). Since \( Y = X + Z \), the output power is \( \mathbb{E}[Y^2] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] + \mathbb{E}[Z^2] \). Given \( \mathbb{E}[Z^2] = 1 \), the constraint becomes \( \mathbb{E}[X^2] + 1 \leq 2 \), which simplifies to \( \mathbb{E}[X^2] \leq 1 \). Thus, the input power \( P_X \leq 1 \).

2. **Capacity Formula for AWGN Channel**:  
   For an AWGN channel, the capacity is given by:
   \[
   C = \frac{1}{2} \log_2\left(1 + \frac{P_X}{P_Z}\right),
   \]
   where \( P_Z = 1 \) (since \( Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \)) and \( P_X \) is the input power. Substituting \( P_X \leq 1 \), the maximum value of \( P_X \) is 1.

3. **Maximum Capacity Calculation**:  
   Substituting \( P_X = 1 \) into the formula:
   \[
   C = \frac{1}{2} \log_2\left(1 + \frac{1}{1}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \log_2(2) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = 0.5 \text{ bits per channel use}.
   \]

4. **Verification**:  
   The capacity formula assumes an optimal Gaussian input distribution, which is consistent with the properties of AWGN channels. The calculation confirms that the channel capacity is 0.5 bits per channel use when the input power is fully utilized under the given constraint.

### Conclusion:
The channel capacity is \( 0.5 \) bits per channel use, corresponding to option **F**.
