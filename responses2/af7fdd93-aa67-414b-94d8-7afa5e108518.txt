Okay, so I've got this question about DNA and the base adenine pairing. Hmm, I remember that in DNA, the bases pair in specific ways. Let me think. The bases are adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. Wait, but adenine is a nucleotide. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, adenine is actually a base, not a nucleotide. Because I think the nucleotides are the building blocks, like deoxyribose, phosphate, etc. So adenine is the base.

The question is asking what adenine normally pairs with. So I think the pairing is between adenine and thymine. Because in DNA, the structure is based on two strands, and each base pairs with its complement. Like adenine pairs with thymine. Wait, wait, but wait, another way: I remember that in DNA, the base pairing is such that adenine pairs with thymine, and thymine pairs with adenine. So adenine is the base that pairs with thymine.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. Each base has a complementary base. So, adenine is the complement of thymine, and thymine is the complement of adenine. So adenine pairs with thymine.

Looking at the options: the choices are A to J. Let me see the options again.

Options:
A: protein.
B: cytosine.
C: thymine.
D: guanine.
E: nucleotide.
F: adenine.
G: ribose.
H: phosphate.
I: deoxyribose.
J: uracil.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait a second. I'm getting confused because adenine is a base, not a nucleotide. So the question is about pairing with which base. Because adenine is a base, so when it pairs, it's with its complement, which is thymine. So the correct answer would be C: thymine.

But wait, let's double-check. Another way to think: DNA has two strands, and each base pairs with the complement. So adenine is paired with thymine, and thymine is paired with adenine. So adenine's complement is thymine. So the correct pairing is C.

Wait, but wait. Another thing: isn't adenine a base, and the question is about what it pairs with. So the correct pairing is thymine. So the answer should be C.

But wait, wait a moment. I'm a bit confused because sometimes I get mixed up with RNA and DNA. Oh, wait, in RNA, the bases are adenine, uracil, etc., but in DNA, it's thymine. But this question is about DNA. So in DNA, adenine pairs with thymine.

So the correct answer is C: thymine.

The question asks what adenine normally pairs with in DNA. In DNA, the base adenine pairs with its complement, which is thymine. This is a standard base pairing in DNA, where adenine (the base) complements thymine. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A: protein** is incorrect because adenine is a base, not a protein.
- **B: cytosine** is incorrect because cytosine pairs with uracil in RNA, not in DNA.
- **C: thymine** is correct because adenine pairs with thymine in DNA.
- **D: guanine** is incorrect because guanine pairs with cytosine in DNA.
- **E: nucleotide** is incorrect because adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine are all bases, not nucleotides.
- The other options (F to J) are unrelated to the pairing of adenine in DNA.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: thymine**.

Answer: C
