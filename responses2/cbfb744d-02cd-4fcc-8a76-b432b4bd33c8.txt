Okay, so I've got this problem here about a car's fuel efficiency and how much gasoline it needs to travel a certain distance. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says the car gets 24 miles per gallon, and I need to find out how many gallons it would need to go 144 miles. Hmm, right, miles per gallon is like how many miles the car can go on one gallon of fuel. So, if I have 24 miles per gallon, that means for every gallon, the car can drive 24 miles.

Wait, so to find out how many gallons are needed for 144 miles, I guess I should divide the total miles by the miles per gallon. That makes sense because if each gallon gets you 24 miles, then 144 miles would require 144 divided by 24 gallons.

Let me do the math: 144 divided by 24. Let me think, 24 times 6 is 144, right? Because 24 times 5 is 120, plus another 24 is 144. So 24 * 6 = 144. So 144 /24 =6. So the car would need 6 gallons.

Wait, but the options don't have 6 as an option? Let me check the options again. Oh, looking back, option B is 6.2, option D is 7, E is 5.8, F is 4.5, G is 5.5, H is 6, I is 8, J is 6. So option H is 6.

So would the correct answer be H:6 gallons? That seems right. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Oh wait, maybe I should double-check the calculation. 24 miles per gallon times 6 gallons equals 144 miles. Yep, that's correct. So 144 miles divided by 24 mi/gal equals 6 gal. So the answer is option H.
