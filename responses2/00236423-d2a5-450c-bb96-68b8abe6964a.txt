Okay, so I've got this question about ring theory, specifically about quotient rings. Let me try to break it down. The question has two statements and asks whether they're true or false. I remember that quotient rings are formed by taking a ring and dividing it by an ideal, and the result is another ring. 

Statement 1 says every quotient ring of every commutative ring is again a commutative ring. Hmm, wait. I think this is about the structure of quotient rings. Let me recall: a quotient ring R/I, where I is an ideal, is commutative if R is commutative. Wait, but is that always true? Let me think. Oh wait, no. Wait, commutative rings have commutative multiplication. So if R is commutative, then any quotient ring R/I should also be commutative. Because the multiplication in R/I is defined as (r + I)(s + I) = rs + I. Since multiplication in R is commutative, rs = sr, so the multiplication in R/I is commutative as well. So Statement 1 should be True. Because if R is commutative, then R/I is commutative.

Wait a second, but wait. Is there a case where this might not hold? Let me think. Suppose R is a commutative ring, and I is an ideal. Then R/I is a ring, and the multiplication is commutative. Because for any a, b in R, (a + I)(b + I) = ab + I, and (b + I)(a + I) = ba + I. Since R is commutative, ab = ba, so these are the same. So yes, R/I is commutative. So Statement 1 is True.

Moving on to Statement 2: An ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R if and only if 1 is in N. Wait, let's parse this. The 'if and only if' means both directions.

First, if N = R, then by definition, 1 is in N, because 1 * 1 = 1, which is in any ideal. So that's one direction. Now, the converse: if 1 is in N, then N must be R. Because an ideal containing 1 must include everything, because any element a can be written as a * 1, which is in N. So if 1 is in N, then N is R. So the statement is correct in both directions. So Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Let's say N is an ideal, and 1 is in N. Then N must be R. That's because N is an additive subgroup of R (since it's an ideal), and since 1 is in N, adding 1 multiple times (like 1 + 1 + ... +1) gives elements like 2,3,... which are in N as well. So N contains every element of R, so N = R. So yes, the statement is correct. Therefore, Statement 2 is True.

So both statements are True. Looking at the options, option F says True, True. So the answer should be F.

The analysis of the two statements leads to both being true.

**Statement 1**: Every quotient ring of a commutative ring is commutative. This is true because the multiplication in the quotient ring R/I is commutative if R is commutative.

**Statement 2**: An ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R if and only if 1 is in N. This is also true because if 1 is in N, N must be R, and conversely, if N is R, 1 is in N.

Both statements are true, so the correct option is F.

**Answer**: F
