Okay, so I have this question about the WHO recommending the maximum intake of free sugars. Hmm, I remember that the World Health Organization sets some dietary guidelines, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think through this.

The question is asking about the maximum percentage of free sugars that individuals should consume. The options are A to J, each with different percentages. I'm trying to recall what I learned in health classes. Oh right, I think the WHO has a limit for free sugars. I'm pretty sure it's not a strict limit, but there's a maximum. 

Wait, was the maximum 10-15% or something higher? Or is it a lower limit? I remember something about a minimum, not a maximum. No, the question is about maximum. So the WHO probably set a maximum allowed intake. I think it's around 15%? Or maybe 20%? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another angle: when I think about mg per kg of body weight. I remember reading that the upper limit is 20 mg/kg. But that's total sugar, right? Free sugars are a specific part. I thought it was less restrictive. Oh, but the question is about maximum intake, not total. 

Wait, I'm mixing things up. Let me try to remember the exact recommendation. I think the WHO said that the maximum free sugar intake should be less than 20%. So the option E is <5%—no, wait, no, that's probably total sugar. Wait, no, the options are for free sugars. Oh, the options are all percentages of free sugars. So the maximum free sugar intake should be under what?

Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The WHO's recommendation for free sugars is a maximum. I think the maximum is 15% or 20%. Wait, I remember that the WHO limits total sugar intake, but for free sugars, it's a lower maximum, like 15% or so. Let's see. 

Wait, no. Another approach: I think the WHO recommended that the maximum free sugar intake per day shouldn't exceed 15% of the maximum allowable intake. Wait, wait, that's not right. Or is it? No, no, perhaps it's that the total free sugars shouldn't exceed a certain amount. I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the maximum intake of free sugars is under 20%. Looking at the options, option E is <5%, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think of another way.

Wait, I'm getting this mixed up. The WHO said that the maximum intake of free sugars should be under 20%. No, that doesn't seem right because I think the maximum is 15%. So the options would have B: >20% which is probably wrong. Wait, option B is >20% which would be a higher intake than the limit. So that's probably incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to list the options again.

Options:
A: 10-15%
B: >20%
C: <10%
D: >15%
E: <5%
F: >10%
G: <15%
H: 15-20%
I: <20%
J: 5-10%

Hmm, the correct answer is probably option E: <5% or option B: >20%.

Wait, I think I've read that the maximum should be under 20% for free sugars. Or wait, no, the WHO might have set a maximum of 15% for free sugars. So the maximum is under 15%, which would be option H:15-20%—no, that's a lower limit. Wait, option H is 15-20%, which is a range. So that might not be the right answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is 10-15%, which is option A. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I remember that the WHO recommended that the maximum intake of free sugars should be under 20% of the maximum allowable intake. Or was it under 15%? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Another approach: I think the correct answer is that the maximum should be under 20% of the limit. So if the limit is 20%, then the maximum is under 20%, which would be option F: >10% or option E: <5%. Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the total and free sugars. The WHO set a maximum for total sugar intake, but for free sugars, it's a lower limit. So for free sugar intake, the maximum is under 20% of the maximum allowable intake.

So the maximum allowed for free sugars would be under 20%. Looking at the options, option E is <5%, which doesn't fit because 20% is higher. Or option F is >10%. Wait, no, that's the opposite.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is that the maximum intake of free sugars is under 20%, so the option would be <20% which is option I. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think I read that the upper limit for free sugars is 15%, so the correct option would be H:15-20%—no, that's a lower limit. So perhaps the correct option is A:10-15%.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is that the maximum intake is under 20%, which would be option F: >10% is correct? No, because 10% is the lower limit.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again. The WHO said that the maximum intake of free sugars should be under 20% of the maximum allowable intake. So the maximum is under 20%, which would mean <20%, which is option I: <20%.

But wait, looking at the options, option I is <20%, which would be correct. So the answer should be I: <20%.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: I think the WHO's recommendation is that the maximum intake of free sugars should be under 20% of the maximum allowable intake. So the maximum is under 20%, which is option I: <20%.

So the answer should be option I.

The World Health Organization (WHO) set a recommendation regarding the maximum intake of free sugars. The correct answer is that the maximum intake of free sugars should be under 20% of the maximum allowable intake. This ensures that individuals do not consume excessive free sugars in their diet. Among the provided options, the one that reflects this recommendation is:

**I: <20%**

ANSWER: I
