Okay, so I have this math problem here: find the quotient of -40 divided by -8. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you divide two negative numbers, the result is positive. But wait, I should make sure I'm applying the rules correctly.

Alright, so the problem is -40 ÷ (-8). Both numbers are negative, right? So dividing two negatives should give me a positive. Let me break it down. 

I can think of it as (-40) ÷ (-8). Now, dividing by a negative is like multiplying by its reciprocal. So maybe I can rewrite this as (-40) multiplied by (-1/8). Let's see: (-40) * (-1/8) equals... Well, the negatives cancel each other out, so it's 40 times 1/8. 

Wait, 40 divided by 8 is 5. So that would mean the result is 5. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 5 as one of the choices. Oh wait, let me check the options again. The options are A: -1, B:8, C:-8, D:-5, E:40, F:-40, G:0, H:5, I: -1 over 5, J:1 over 5. Oh, option H is 5. So that seems correct.

Wait another thought, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the division. -40 divided by -8. So 8 times 5 is 40, right? And since both are negative, the negatives should cancel. So yes, 5 is the correct answer. I think that's right. So the correct option should be H:5.

The quotient of -40 ÷ (-8) is 5. 

Answer: H: 5
