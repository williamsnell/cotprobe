Okay, so I have this question about productivity of labor in two countries, X and Z. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that Country X has an output of 30,000 units with 3,000 workers. Country Z has 40,000 units and 8,000 workers. I need to find out the productivity of labor in each country and compare them.

Productivity of labor usually refers to how much output is produced per worker. So I should calculate the output per worker for each country.

For Country X: 30,000 units divided by 3,000 workers. Let me do that division. 30,000 รท 3,000 equals 10. So X's productivity is 10 units per worker.

For Country Z: 40,000 units divided by 8,000 workers. 40,000 รท 8,000 equals 5. So Z's productivity is 5 units per worker.

Now, I need to find the percentage difference between the two. The question is about which country has higher productivity and by how much.

Let me think about the options. The options are comparing X and Z's productivity.

Option A: X is 75% higher than Z. Wait, if Z is 5, X is 10. So X is 5 units higher, which is 100% higher than Z. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X is 33% higher than Z. Wait, 10 is what percentage higher than 5? Let me calculate. The increase is 5 units. 5 is what percent of 5? (5/5)*100% = 100%. So X is 100% higher than Z. So B says 33% higher, which is wrong.

Option C: Z is 33% higher. That would mean Z's productivity is higher. But we found that X is higher, so C is incorrect.

Option D: Z is 50% higher than X. Wait, no, because X is 10, Z is 5. So 5 is half of 10, so Z is 50% lower than X. So D is saying Z is 50% higher, which is false.

Option E: X is 50% higher than Z. Since X is 10 and Z is 5, 10 is 50% higher than 5. Yes, that's correct. So E is correct.

Wait, could I have made a mistake? Let me double-check.

X: 30,000 / 3,000 = 10.

Z: 40,000 / 8,000 = 5.

X is 10, Z is 5. So X is 50% higher than Z. So E says X is 50% higher than Z, which is correct. So E is the correct option. So the answer is E.

Wait, but looking at the options, E says "The productivity of labor in country X is 50 percent higher than in country Z."

Wait, could I have confused the percentages? Let me make sure.

If Z's productivity is 5, and X's is 10, then X is 50% higher. So E is correct.

So the correct answer is E.

The productivity of labor in each country is calculated by dividing output by the number of workers. For Country X, output is 30,000 units with 3,000 workers, resulting in 10 units per worker. For Country Z, output is 40,000 units with 8,000 workers, resulting in 5 units per worker. Country X has a higher productivity of labor by 50%, as its productivity is 10 units per worker compared to 5 units per worker in Country Z. 

Evaluating the options, E states that Country X's productivity is 50% higher than Country Z's, which is correct. 

Answer: E
