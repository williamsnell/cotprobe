Okay, so I'm trying to answer this physics question about momentum and kinetic energy. Hmm, let's see. The question says that when an increase in speed doubles the momentum of a moving body, what happens to its kinetic energy? The options are from A to J, with some options about changes like doubling, increasing, etc.

Alright, I remember that momentum (p) is mass (m) times velocity (v). So p = m*v. Kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv². Wait, so if the momentum doubles, that means the velocity must have doubled, right? Because if p goes from p to 2p, then v must go from v to 2v, since m is the same.

Wait no, wait. The question says when the speed increases, it doubles the momentum. So if the initial momentum is p, then 2p is the new momentum. Since p = m*v, the new momentum is 2p, which means m*(new v) = 2 * m * old v. So new v is twice the old v. So v doubled.

Now, what about kinetic energy? KE is (1/2)mv². If v doubles, then v becomes 2v. Plugging into KE: (1/2)m*(2v)^2. Let me compute that. (2v)^2 is 4v², so KE becomes (1/2)m*4v² = 2*(1/2 m v²) = 2*(original KE). Oh wait, so the KE becomes twice as much. So it's doubled.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Let's take some numbers. Suppose initial momentum is 10 kg·m/s. So m*v = 10. Suppose m is 2kg, so v is 5 m/s (because 2*5=10). KE is (1/2)*2*(5)^2 = (1)(25) = 25 J.

Now, the speed increases. So the new momentum is double, so 20 kg·m/s. So m*v_new = 20. Since m is 2kg, v_new is 10 m/s. KE is (1/2)*2*(10)^2 = 1*100 = 100 J. So from 25 to 100, which is a fourfold increase. So KE quadruples.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. Because if the momentum doubles, KE is (1/2) m (2v)^2 = (1/2) m 4 v² = 2*(1/2 m v²) = 2 times the original KE. Hmm, so that would be a doubling. So the K.E. goes from 25 to 50 (wait no, wait no, in my example, initial KE is 25, and new is 100, which is four times. So why the discrepancy in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example. Let me try again.

Let me take m as 1 kg. So initial velocity v is 10 m/s (since p = m*v = 10). So initial KE is 0.5 * 1 * 10^2 = 50 J.

If the speed doubles, v becomes 20 m/s. New momentum is 1 * 20 = 20 kg·m/s, which is double the initial 10. So KE is 0.5 *1 * (20)^2 = 0.5 *400 = 200 J. That's four times the original 50 J, so KE quadruples. So in this case, KE increases more than double.

But wait, my initial calculation when I took m=2kg, v=5 m/s, KE was 25 J. When speed doubles to 10 m/s, KE becomes 100 J, which is four times 25, so that's four times the original. So the KE quadruples.

Wait, in the case where I considered m=1kg, v=10 gives KE 50 J. After speed doubles, v=20, KE is 200 J, which is 4x. So in both cases, the KE increases by a factor of 4, which is more than double. So the KE increases more than double. So the question was, when the momentum is doubled, what's the KE? It becomes 4 times, which is more than doubling. So the correct answer is E: quadruples.

Looking back at the options, E is "quadruples". So the answer should be E. But let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything.

Wait, another approach: the kinetic energy is proportional to v squared. So if v doubles, KE is multiplied by (2)^2 = 4. So yes, quadruples.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

When the speed of a moving body increases, its momentum doubles, which implies that the velocity is also doubled (since momentum is given by \( p = mv \)). The kinetic energy (KE) is proportional to the square of the velocity, i.e., \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). If the velocity doubles, the velocity becomes \( 2v \), and substituting this into the KE formula gives:

\[
KE_{\text{new}} = \frac{1}{2}m(2v)^2 = \frac{1}{2}m \cdot 4v^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = 4 \cdot KE_{\text{original}}
\]

Thus, the kinetic energy quadruples when the momentum doubles. Among the options provided, this corresponds to option **E: quadruples**.
