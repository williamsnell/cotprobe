Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to subtract 16.5 from 142.76. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting comfortable with decimals, but I think I can handle it.

First, I'll write down the numbers to make it clearer. 142.76 minus 16.5. Wait, I should make sure to line up the decimal points so I don't mix up the digits. Let me set it up like subtraction:

142.76  
-  16.5  
= ?

I guess I should start from the rightmost digits, just like when I subtract whole numbers. So, starting with the hundredths place: 6 minus 5, that's 1. Then the tenths place: 7 minus 6 is 1. Next, the units place: 2 minus 6. Wait, that can't be right because 2 is less than 6. Oh, right, I need to borrow from the tens place. 

Wait, so the 2 in the units place can't subtract 6, so I borrow 1 from the tens place. The 4 in the tens place becomes 3, and the 2 becomes 12. So 12 minus 6 is 6. Then, the tens place is 3 (since I borrowed 1 earlier), and I subtract 1 from that. So 3 minus 1 is 2. Then, the hundreds place is 4 minus 0, which is 4. So putting it all together: 126.26.

Wait, let me double-check. Starting with 142.76, subtracting 16.5. So 142 minus 16 is 126. But wait, I have to consider the decimal parts. 0.76 minus 0.5 is 0.26. So adding that, it's 126.26. That's option A.

But wait, wait, looking at the options, option A is 126.26, which matches what I got. So why am I doubting myself? Maybe I should try another way to subtract to confirm. Let me do it step by step.

142.76 minus 16.5. Let me break it down. 16.5 is the same as 16 and a half. So subtracting 16 from 142.76 would give me 126.76. Then I need to subtract 0.5 more. So 126.76 minus 0.5 is 126.26. Yep, same result.

Wait, another way to check is rounding. 142.76 is approximately 143, and 16.5 is about 16.5. 143 minus 16 is 127. But since I rounded 142.76 up to 143 and 16.5 up to 17, I subtracted an extra 0.5. So 127 minus 0.5 is 126.5. Hmm, but none of the options are 126.5. Wait, the options are 126.26, which is 0.26 less than 126.5. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my rounding.

Wait, perhaps I should do the exact calculation again. 142.76 minus 16.5. Let me do it digit by digit again. 

The numbers are:

142.76  
- 16.50  
= ?

Starting from the right:

6 - 0 = 6.

7 - 5 = 2, but wait, that's tenths place. Then, 2 - 6. Hmm, can't do that, so borrow 1 from the tens place. So the 2 becomes 12, and the tens place (which is 4) becomes 3.

3 - 6. Again, can't do, so borrow from the hundreds place. The 4 becomes 3, and the 2 becomes 12. Now, 12 -6 =6.

The hundreds place is now 3 (since we borrowed 1), minus 0 (since we subtracted 0 in the tens place), so 3.

So putting it all together: 126.26. That's option A.

The correct answer is A: 126.26.

Step-by-step explanation: Subtract 16.5 from 142.76 by aligning the decimal points, borrowing as needed. The result is 126.26.
