Okay, so I need to figure out where the world's first civilization developed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my history, but let me think. I remember that the concept of the world's first civilization is often linked to something ancient. Oh, right, it's often linked to the Indus Valley Civilization. But wait, where exactly? 

The options given are F, G, H, I, J. Let me go through them. Option F is Northern Africa, which could be North Africa. Option G is Northern Africa as well, so that's the same. Option H is Southern India, which is probably South Asia. Option I is Crete, which I think is a city-state. Option J is Mesopotamia, which is the area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, known for their civilization.

Wait, so the world's first civilization is the Indus Valley. I think it was in the Indus Valley, which is part of what's now modern-day Pakistan and India. So looking at the options, J is Mesopotamia, which is the same as the Indus Valley's area. But wait, does Mesopotamia count as the world's first civilization, or is it the Indus Valley specifically?

I think the Indus Valley is often called the first civilization because it's the earliest known. So J, Mesopotamia, is associated with the Indus Valley. So the correct answer would be J.

The world's first civilization, known as the Indus Valley Civilization, developed in the region of Mesopotamia.
