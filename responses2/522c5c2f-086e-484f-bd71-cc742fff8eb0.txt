Okay, so I've got this problem here about partial derivatives of a vector-valued function. Hmm, let's see. The function a is given as (u²v, u + e^v, u + v²). And I need to find the first and second partial derivatives of each component of a with respect to u and v. The question is asking for ∂a/∂u, ∂a/∂v, and ∂²a/(∂u∂v). 

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I understand the notation correctly. The problem mentions the "partial derivatives of the vector." Oh, right, it's probably the partial derivatives of each component of the vector a with respect to u and v. So, there are three components, and each of those components has their own partial derivatives.

Let me break it down. The vector a is composed of three functions:

1. a₁ = u²v
2. a₂ = u + e^v
3. a₃ = u + v²

So I need to find ∂a₁/∂u, ∂a₁/∂v, ∂a₂/∂u, ∂a₂/∂v, ∂a₃/∂u, and ∂a₃/∂v. Then, for the second partials, I think I need ∂²a₁/(∂u∂v) and ∂²a₂/(∂u∂v), but wait, the problem says 3)[(∂²a)/(∂u∂v). Wait, the question says to find three partial derivatives: (∂a/∂u), (∂a/∂v), and (∂²a)/(∂u∂v). Or wait, maybe the three are (∂a/∂u), (∂a/∂v), and (∂²a)/(∂u∂v). Let me read the question again.

Oh, wait, the question says: "Using the definition of the partial derivative of the vector, find 1)(∂a/∂u) 2)(∂a/∂v) 3)[(∂²a) / (∂u∂v)]." So, three things: the vector of partial derivatives for each component with respect to u, then the same for v, and then the mixed partial derivative ∂²a/(∂u∂v). Or perhaps each of these is a vector? No, because the definition of the partial derivative of a vector would give a vector of the partial derivatives.

Wait, the question says to find (∂a/∂u), (∂a/∂v), and (∂²a)/(∂u∂v). So perhaps each of these is a vector. But the options present them as single vectors. Hmm, wait, no. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, each option is a triplet of vectors. For example, option A is (2uv, 1, 1), (u², e^v, 2v), (2u, 1, 0). So, the first part is ∂a/∂u, the second ∂a/∂v, and the third is the mixed partial derivative ∂²a/(∂u ∂v).

Wait, but the problem says to find three things: ∂a/∂u, ∂a/∂v, and ∂²a/(∂u∂v). So, each of these is a vector.

Wait, no, the way the question is worded is a bit confusing. Let me parse the question again: "Using the definition of the partial derivative of the vector, find: 1)(∂a/∂u) 2)(∂a/∂v) 3)[(∂²a)/(∂u∂v)]."

Ah, so each of these is a vector. So, 1) is ∂a/∂u as a vector, 2) is ∂a/∂v as a vector, and 3) is the mixed partial derivative, ∂²a/(∂u∂v) as a vector.

Wait, but what does that mean for their components? Let me see.

Each component of a is a function of u and v. So, for each component, the partial derivatives would be:

For a₁ = u²v:

∂a₁/∂u = 2uv

∂a₁/∂v = u²

For a₂ = u + e^v:

∂a₂/∂u = 1

∂a₂/∂v = e^v

For a₃ = u + v²:

∂a₃/∂u = 1

∂a₃/∂v = 2v

So, the vectors would be:

∂a/∂u = (2uv, 1, 1)

∂a/∂v = (u², e^v, 2v)

Then, the mixed partial derivative ∂²a/(∂u∂v) would be the partial derivative of ∂a/∂u with respect to v, and the partial derivative of ∂a/∂v with respect to u. Wait, no, wait: ∂²a/(∂u ∂v) is the first partial derivative with respect to u, then with respect to v. Alternatively, it's the same as the mixed partial; so for each component, we'd take the derivative with respect to u first, then v.

Wait, but for the vector, each component is a function, so ∂²a/(∂u ∂v) for each component is:

For a₁: ∂/∂v (2uv) = 2u

For a₂: ∂/∂v (u²) = 0, since u² doesn't depend on v.

For a₃: ∂/∂v (1) = 0, since 1 does not depend on v.

Wait, that can't be right. Because for a₁, ∂a₁/∂u = 2uv. Then, ∂/∂v of that is 2u.

Wait, but no, wait. The mixed partial derivative of a₁ with respect to u and then v would be ∂²a₁/(∂u ∂v) = ∂/∂v (∂a₁/∂u) = ∂/∂v (2uv) = 2u.

Similarly, for a₂: ∂a₂/∂u = 1. Then ∂/∂v of 1 is 0.

For a₃: ∂a₃/∂u =1, so ∂/∂v is 0.

So, the mixed partial derivative is (2u, 0, 0).

Wait, but in the options, I don't see any option that has (2u, 0, 0) as the third component. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option B is (2u, e^v, 2v) for ∂a/∂u, (2uv, 0, 1) for ∂a/∂v, and (0, 1, 2v) for the mixed partial. Wait, that doesn't match what I just calculated. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I got the order wrong. Let me think again. The problem might be considering ∂²a/(∂u ∂v) as ∂/∂u (∂a/∂v). Let me check.

Wait, no, the mixed partial derivatives, if they exist, are equal if the function is sufficiently smooth. So, for each component, perhaps the order doesn't matter. But let me check each component.

Wait, for a₁: ∂/∂u (a₁) = 2uv, then ∂/∂v of that is 2u.

Alternatively, ∂/∂v of a₁ is u², then ∂/∂u of that is 0.

Wait, so this leads to different results depending on the order. So, the mixed partials would not be the same in this case. So, that suggests that the function doesn't satisfy the equality, but that's a different issue. So, for each component, the mixed partials would be 2u for a₁, 0 for a₂, and 0 for a₃.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at option B:

1) (2u, e^v, 2v)

2) (2uv, 0, 1)

3) (0, 1, 2v)

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, the third component of the mixed partial (for a₁) is 2u, not 0. So option B's third component is 2v. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mixed partial. Let me recheck.

For a₁:

∂a₁/∂u = 2uv → ∂²a₁/(∂u ∂v) = 2u.

For a₂:

∂a₂/∂u = 1 → ∂²a₂/(∂u ∂v) = 0.

For a₃:

∂a₃/∂u =1 → ∂²a₃/(∂u ∂v) = 0.

So, the mixed partial vector would be (2u, 0, 0).

Looking at the options, none of them have (2u, 0, 0) as the third component.

Wait, but let me look at option F.

Option F: the first vector is (2uv, 1, 0). Second vector is (u², e^v, 2v). Third vector is (2u, 0, 0).

Ah, so the third component is 2u for the first option, 0 in the second, 2v in the third, 0 in the fourth.

Wait, but our earlier calculation gave (2u,0,0). So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the order of the components. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The question says to find three things: 1) ∂a/∂u, 2) ∂a/∂v, 3) ∂²a/(∂u ∂v).

Hmm, perhaps the third component is the second partial derivative. Or maybe the notation is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Because the vector a is given as (u²v, u + e^v, u + v²). So, each component is a function of u and v.

So, the first partial derivatives are:

∂a/∂u = (2uv, 1, 1)

∂a/∂v = (u², e^v, 2v)

And the second partial derivative (the mixed) for each component is:

For a₁: ∂²a₁/(∂u ∂v) = ∂/∂u (∂a₁/∂v) = ∂/∂u (u²) = 0.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no: ∂²a/(∂u ∂v) is the partial of (partial a / partial u) with respect to v, or the partial of (partial a / partial v) with respect to u. Let me compute both approaches.

Compute ∂²a₁/(∂u ∂v):

First, compute ∂a₁/∂u = 2uv.

Then, take ∂/∂v of that: 2u.

Alternatively, compute ∂a₁/∂v = u², then ∂/∂u of that gives 0.

Wait, so the mixed partials are 2u for a₁, 0 for a₂, and 0 for a₃.

But none of the options seem to match that. Hmm. Let me look again at the options.

Looking at option B:

1) (2uv, 1, 2v)

2) (2uv, 0, 1)

3) (0, 1, 2v)

Wait, I'm getting (2u, 0, 0), which would correspond to a particular component being 2u. But none of the options have 2u as the third component.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me recheck the options.

Looking at option B: the third component is 2v. So, for a₁, 2u, for a₂, 0, and a₃, 2v. So, according to my calculation, the third component should be 2u. None of the options match that.

Looking at option F:

Third component is 2u: so for a₁, 2u; for a₂, 0; a₃, 0. So, the third component is 2u.

Wait, but in option F, the first vector is (2uv,1,0), which matches ∂a/∂u.

Second vector is (u², e^v, 2v), which matches ∂a/∂v.

Third vector is (2u, 0, 0), which would be the mixed partial.

Wait, but according to my calculations, the mixed partial for a₁ is 2u, a₂ is 0, a₃ is 0.

Ah, but none of the options have 2u as the third component. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the mixed partials. Let me re-examine.

For a₁: the partial derivatives are 2uv and u².

Wait, ∂²a/(∂u ∂v) for a₁ is ∂/∂u (∂a₁/∂v) = ∂/∂u (u²) = 0.

Wait, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to compute the second partial derivatives, not the mixed one.

Wait, the problem says 3)[(∂²a)/(∂u ∂v)]. So, that's the mixed partial. So, the third component is (2u, 0, 0) as I thought.

But looking back at the options, which one has the 2u in the third component?

Wait, option F has (2u, 0, 0) as the third component. Let me check option F again.

Option F: 1st vector: (2uv, 1, 0)

2nd vector: (u², e^v, 2v)

3rd vector: (2u, 0, 0)

So, according to that, the third vector is the mixed partial derivative. But according to my calculation, the mixed partial is (2u, 0, 0). So option F's third vector is (2u, 0, 0), which matches.

But wait, according to the earlier calculation, the mixed partial ∂²a/(∂u ∂v) would be (2u, 0, 0). So, the third component is (2u, 0, 0). So, the option F's third vector is (2u, 0, 0), which matches.

Wait, but the problem says to find the second partial derivative, not the mixed one. But sometimes, ∂²a/(∂u ∂v) is called the mixed partial, which is equal to ∂²a/(∂v ∂u) under certain conditions.

But according to my calculations, the third vector in the options is (2u, 0, 0), which matches the mixed partial. So, perhaps the correct answer is option F.

Wait, but the problem says to find the three partial derivatives: partial a over u, partial a over v, and the mixed partial.

But looking at the options, option F's third vector is (2u, 0, 0), which would be the mixed partial for a₁. So, the correct answer would be option F.

Wait, but earlier I thought the third component of the mixed partial was 0, but that's not the case. So, option F's third vector is (2u, 0, 0), which matches the computed mixed partial.

But let me double-check. For a₁, ∂/∂u (∂a₁/∂v) = ∂/∂u (u²) = 0.

Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because, ∂²a/(∂u ∂v) for each component is:

For a₁: ∂a₁/∂u = 2uv → ∂/∂v (2uv) = 2u.

But wait, no: ∂²a/(∂u ∂v) would be the second derivative, so first derivative with respect to u, then with respect to v.

Wait, for a₁: first derivative w.r. to u is 2uv. Then, derivative w.r. to v is 2u.

Wait, but that's not correct, because 2uv is a function of u and v. When you take the derivative with respect to v, you treat u as a constant. So, ∂/∂v (2uv) = 2u.

So, the mixed partial for a₁ is 2u, for a₂: 0, and a₃: 0.

Which would imply that the third component is (2u, 0, 0).

Looking at the options, option F's third vector is (2u, 0, 0). So, option F's third vector matches.

But wait, I'm confused because I thought the problem said to find the second partial derivative. So, perhaps the problem is not about the mixed partial but the second partial derivatives. So, let's reevaluate.

Wait, the problem says to find ∂a/∂u, ∂a/∂v, and ∂²a/(∂u ∂v). So, perhaps I should compute each of them.

So, for each component:

a₁: ∂a/∂u = 2uv, ∂a/∂v = u².

a₂: ∂a/∂u = 1, ∂a/∂v = e^v.

a₃: ∂a/∂u = 1, ∂a/∂v = 2v.

Then, the mixed partial ∂²a/(∂u ∂v) for each component is:

a₁: ∂/∂u (2uv) = 2v → then ∂/∂v (2uv) = 2u.

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, for a₁, the first derivative with respect to u is 2uv. Then, the derivative with respect to v would be 2u.

Wait, but the mixed partial is the derivative of the first partial derivative with respect to the second variable.

So, for a₁, the first partial with respect to u is 2uv. Then, the partial with respect to v is 2u.

Similarly, for a₂, the first partial with respect to u is 1. Then, the partial with respect to v is 0.

For a₃, first partial with respect to u is 1. Then, partial with respect to v is 0.

So, the mixed partial ∂²a/(∂u ∂v) is (2u, 0, 0).

Wait, so in the options, which one has this? Let me check option F.

Option F: the third vector is (2u, 0, 0), which matches the mixed partial.

So, according to this, the correct answer is option F.

Wait, but the problem says to find the three partial derivatives: partial a over u, partial a over v, and the mixed partial. So, perhaps the options are correct.

So, to recap:

∂a/∂u = (2uv, 1, 1)

∂a/∂v = (u², e^v, 2v)

∂²a/(∂u ∂v) = (2u, 0, 0).

Looking at the options, option F has (2u, 0, 0) as the third vector. So, the correct answer would be option F.

Wait, but the problem says to find 1)(∂a/∂u) 2)(∂a/∂v) 3)[(∂²a)/(∂u∂v)].

So, according to the options, the third vector is (2u, 0, 0), which is the mixed partial.

So, the correct answer is option F.
</think>

The correct answer is option F. Here's the reasoning:

1. Compute the first partial derivatives of the vector-valued function **a(u, v)** = (u²v, u + e^v, u + v²):
   - ∂a/∂u = (2uv, 1, 1)
   - ∂a/∂v = (u², e^v, 2v)

2. Compute the mixed partial derivative ∂²a/(∂u ∂v) for each component:
   - For a₁: ∂/∂u (2uv) = 2v; then ∂/∂v (2uv) = 2u.
   - For a₂: ∂/∂u (1) = 0; then ∂/∂v (0) = 0.
   - For a₃: ∂/∂u (1) = 0; then ∂/∂v (0) = 0.

Thus, the mixed partial derivative is (2u, 0, 0), which matches option F.

ANSWER: F
