Okay, so I've got this question here about a checking account and the reserve ratio. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the question says that $1000 is deposited into a checking account, and the excess reserves increase by $700. I need to find the reserve ratio from the options given.

Wait, what's a reserve ratio again? Oh right, the reserve ratio is the ratio of the reserves a bank holds against its deposits. It's calculated by dividing the total reserves by the total deposits. So, the formula is Reserve Ratio = (Reserves / Deposits).

In this case, the deposit is $1000, and the excess reserves are $700. Wait, but I think the excess reserves are part of the total reserves. So, the total reserves would be the required reserves plus the excess reserves. Hmm, but wait, no, maybe not. Wait, no. The question says the excess reserves increased by $700. So, if the deposit was $1000, the excess reserves are $700. So the total reserves would be the required reserves plus the excess. But wait, actually, the required reserves are another term. Let me clarify.

Reserve ratio is usually calculated as (Total Reserves) / (Total Deposits). But sometimes, people refer to the required reserves, which are a certain percentage of the deposit, and the excess reserves are the part the bank keeps. So, if the required reserve ratio is, say, 10%, then 10% of $1000 is $100 in required reserves. The remaining $900 would be the excess reserves. But in this question, the excess is $700, which is less than 10% of 1000 (which is 100). So the required ratio must be higher.

Wait, let me think again. The total reserves are the required reserves plus the excess. So if the question says the excess is $700, and the deposit is $1000, then the total reserves are required + excess. Let's denote required reserves as RR. So:

Total Reserves = RR + excess.

We know the deposit is $1000, and excess is $700. So, Total Reserves = RR + 700.

But I don't know RR yet. But I can relate RR as a percentage of the deposit. Because the reserve ratio is RR / 1000.

Wait, but without knowing the required reserve ratio, I can't compute RR. Oh wait, maybe I don't need to. Let me think differently.

If the excess is $700, and the deposit is $1000, then the required reserves would be the total reserves minus the excess. But I don't have the total reserves yet. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. If we're given the change in excess reserves. The question says that the excess increases by $700. So, the excess is the difference between the required reserves and the actual reserves. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Reserve ratio (RR) is (Reserves) / (Deposits). So, if the excess reserves are $700, and the total deposit is $1000, the excess is the difference between the required reserves and the actual reserves.

So, required reserves = RR * deposits.

But excess is required reserves minus actual reserves.

So, excess = RR * 1000 - actual reserves.

But I don't know the actual reserves. Alternatively, perhaps the excess is the amount the bank holds beyond the required. So, if the required is RR, then the actual reserves are RR - excess.

Wait, no. Wait, the actual reserves are the required plus the excess. Because the bank must hold the required (RR) and keep the excess (700). So, Total Reserves = RR + 700.

But I don't know RR. Hmm, but the question is asking for the reserve ratio, which is (Total Reserves) / 1000.

Wait, perhaps without knowing the required reserves, we have to relate the excess to the total.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. The question states that the excess increases by $700. So, the change in excess is $700. I'm trying to find the reserve ratio, which is the ratio of reserves to deposits.

Wait, but how does the excess relate to the reserve ratio? Because the reserve ratio is the ratio of the total reserves (including required and excess) to the deposits. So, if the excess is $700, and the deposits are $1000, then the total reserves are RR + 700. But I don't know RR.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to say that the excess reserves increased by $700, but perhaps that's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the excess is a fixed amount, and it's given as $700. So, the question is, with a deposit of $1000, and excess reserves of $700, what's the reserve ratio.

Ah, maybe the key is that the excess is part of the total reserves. So, the total reserves are RR plus 700. But the reserve ratio is (RR + 700)/1000.

But without knowing RR, we can't compute this. So perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the excess is a portion of the deposit. So, the excess is 700, which is 70% of 1000. But wait, that's not the reserve ratio. Because the reserve ratio is the ratio of the actual reserves (including the required plus excess) to the deposit.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about it the wrong way. Let me try another approach.

The question is about the reserve ratio, which is the ratio of the reserves (which is the required plus the excess) to the deposit.

So, if the excess is $700, and the deposit is $1000, then the required reserves must be the total reserves minus the excess.

But I don't know the total reserves. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the required reserves are a certain percentage, and the excess is the difference between that and the actual reserves.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the excess ratio, but that's not the reserve ratio. Oh wait, the question says the reserve ratio must be: so it's the ratio of the total reserves (including required and excess) to the deposit.

Wait, but without knowing the required reserves, I can't calculate the total. So perhaps the question has a typo, and it's supposed to say that the required reserves increase by $700. Or perhaps the question is phrased differently.

Wait, let me read the question again: "If $1000 is deposited into a checking account and excess reserves increase by $700 the reserve ratio must be: ..."

So, the deposit is $1000, and excess is $700. So, the total reserves are the required plus the excess. But I don't know the required. So perhaps without more data, I can't find the exact reserve ratio.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm making this more complicated. Let me think about what the reserve ratio is. It's the proportion of total deposits that the bank must keep as reserves. So, it's the ratio of required reserves to total deposits.

If the required reserves plus excess equals the total reserves, then the reserve ratio is (RR + 700)/1000.

But without knowing RR, I can't compute it. So perhaps the question is missing some information, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the excess is $700, and that the required is 30% of the deposit. Then, the total reserves would be 700 + (30% of 1000) = 700 + 300 = 1000. So, the reserve ratio would be 1000 / 1000 = 100%. But that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the required is 30%, so total reserves would be 700 + 300 = 1000. So, RR = 300, so RR is 30% of 1000. So, reserve ratio would be 300/1000 = 30%? Wait, that's 30%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the required reserves are 30% of 1000 ($300), and the excess is $700, so total reserves are 300 +700= 1000. So, reserve ratio is 1000 /1000=1, which would be 100%, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, but none of the options are 100%. Let me look back at the options:

Options are:

A:10%

B:80%

C:60%

D:70%

E:90%.

Hmm, none of these are 100% so perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the total reserves, but just the excess. So, the excess is $700, and the deposit is $1000. The reserve ratio is the ratio of the excess to the deposit. So, 700 /1000 =70%. So, 70%, which is option D.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the reserve ratio is the portion of deposits that the bank must hold as reserves, not the excess. So, if the excess is $700, and the excess is part of the deposit, then the reserve ratio would be the excess divided by the deposit. So, 700/1000=70%.

Wait, but the question says "excess reserves increase by $700" â€” so perhaps the excess is $700, but the reserve ratio is calculated based on the excess. So, the question is asking, what is the reserve ratio, given that the excess is $700. So, the reserve ratio would be 700/1000=70%.

Option D is 70%, which would be the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the reserve ratio is based on the total reserves, not the excess. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the reserve ratio as (excess) / (deposits), which would be 700/1000=70%, so option D.

Alternatively, another way: if excess is $700, and the total deposit is $1000. The required reserves would be RR = total reserves - excess. But without knowing total reserves, I can't find RR. But if the question is asking for the reserve ratio, and they've given that the excess is 700, perhaps they are asking what the reserve ratio is, which would be RR / deposits. But since the question is not clear, perhaps the correct answer is 70%.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the reserve ratio is (total reserves) / deposits, which would be (RR + 700)/1000. Without knowing RR, I can't compute. So, perhaps the question is considering that the excess is 700, and the total reserves are RR + 700. But to find the reserve ratio, I need RR.

Hmm, but perhaps the question is not asking about RR, but about the reserve ratio, which is RR / deposits. So, if excess is 700, then RR = excess + required. But without required, I can't proceed. So perhaps the question is incorrect, but since it's an exam question, I have to choose an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the reserve ratio is the ratio of the excess to the deposit. So, 700/1000=70%, which is option D.

So, the correct answer is D:70%.
</think>

The question asks for the reserve ratio when $1000 is deposited into a checking account and the excess reserves increase by $700. The reserve ratio is calculated as the ratio of total reserves to deposits. However, the question is ambiguous about whether it is referring to the excess reserves or the total reserves.

1. **If the reserve ratio is based on total reserves**:  
   - Total reserves = required reserves + excess reserves.  
   - Without knowing the required reserves, we cannot calculate the exact reserve ratio.  

2. **If the reserve ratio is based on excess reserves**:  
   - The reserve ratio could be interpreted as the ratio of excess reserves to deposits.  
   - In this case, the reserve ratio would be $700 / $1000 = 70%.

Given the options provided, the most plausible interpretation is that the question refers to the ratio of excess reserves to deposits, as this directly relates to the change in excess reserves. Therefore, the reserve ratio is 70%.
