Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the shopkeeper owns a vacant lot with a record title as a fee simple absolute. So that means the property is free and clear and without remainder, and everyone is bound to it unless something changes it. But in this case, the title is still with the shopkeeper, so no changes yet.

In 1960, the shopkeeper conveyed the property by a general warranty deed. The deed says, "The grantor (which would be the owner, the friend) conveys the property to my friend, but if the property ever is used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach 25." Hmm, so the condition is based on the property's use for church purposes, not the grantor's intent.

At the time of conveyance, the sister was single. So the condition is based on whether the property will be used for church purposes. The sister then got married, had two sons, one son died in an accident, one son's death caused the daughter to be born. Now, the question is about determining the ownership rights to the vacant lot with all minors represented. So the question is about who owns the property now, considering the children.

Wait, let me think about the conveyance. The general warranty deed usually creates a general interest in the property. The condition in the deed (if the property is used for church purposes) would create a possibility interest. But under some circumstances, a general warranty deed can have a condition that causes a fee simple to change to fee simple absolute with a possibility interest, or perhaps a fee simple with a possibility interest, or even a fee simple with a fee simple absolute.

Wait, but in this case, the condition is based on the property's use for church purposes, not on the grantor's intent. So the deed is a general warranty deed with a condition that triggers a transfer to the children of the sister upon church purposes. So the condition is a possibility interest.

Now, in terms of ownership, the general warranty deed creates a general interest. The possibility interest (if the property is used for church purposes) would create a fee simple with a possibility interest, which is a fee simple absolute. But wait, no—general interest plus a possibility interest does not make a fee simple absolute. It makes a fee simple with a possibility interest. But wait, wait. The condition is a possibility interest. So let's think about what type of interest that creates.

A possibility interest is a right to possess a property at a certain time. It doesn't transfer ownership, so it's a possibility interest that only creates ownership if the condition is met. So the general warranty deed creates a general interest, which is a right to possess the property, but if the condition is satisfied, the property is transferred to the children.

Now, if the condition is satisfied, the property is transferred to the children of the sister. So the transfer is a conveyance of the property to the children, which is a fee simple absolute. So the children would have a fee simple absolute, which means they take the property outright, and they can't transfer it back.

But wait, the condition is whether the property is used for church purposes. So if it's used for church, the children get it. But if not, they keep the property as a general interest.

Wait, but the condition isn't based on the grantor's intent. So the possibility interest is created by the deed, and if the property is used for church, the children get it. So the children's ownership is a fee simple absolute.

But what about the original grantor? The general warranty deed creates a general interest, which is a right to possess, but the possibility interest is a right to possess only if the condition is met.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The general warranty deed creates a general interest, which is a right to possess the property. But the condition in the deed (if the property is used for church purposes) would create a possibility interest. So the general interest plus a possibility interest would mean that the general interest is a fee simple, and the possibility interest is a fee simple absolute, but that doesn't sound right.

Wait, no. The general warranty deed is a general interest in fee simple. The condition creates a possibility interest that allows the property to be transferred to the children. So, for the general interest, if the condition is satisfied, the general interest is transferred to the children. So the children get the fee simple absolute.

Alternatively, if the condition is not satisfied, the general interest remains, and the property is held as a fee simple, and the children can't take it because the condition hasn't been triggered.

Wait, but the problem is about the ownership rights to the vacant lot with all minors represented. So the children are minors, so their rights are considered.

Wait, let me think again. When a general warranty deed is made, the grantor (the friend) conveys a fee simple with a general interest. Then, the condition is that if the property is used for church purposes, the general interest is transferred to the children of the sister.

So, the children would have a fee simple absolute, but only if the condition is met. But the condition is based on the property being used for church purposes. So if the property is used for church, the children take it. If not, the general interest remains, and the property is held as a fee simple with the general interest.

Wait, but the condition is not based on the grantor's intent. It's based on the property's use for church purposes. So the condition is a possibility interest.

So, the general warranty deed creates a general interest. The condition creates a possibility interest. So, the children's interest is a possibility interest—so they can take the property if the condition is satisfied.

Wait, no. The possibility interest is a right to possess at the time of the conveyance, but if satisfied, it's a transfer. So in this case, the general interest is created, the condition creates a possibility interest, which if satisfied, makes the general interest transfer to the children. So the children's interest is a transfer based on the condition.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to map it out.

Original conveyance: General warranty deed, condition based on use for church.

So, the general warranty deed creates a general interest in fee simple. Then, the condition (Church purposes) creates a possibility interest in fee simple. So the children's interest is a possibility interest.

So, the general interest is a right to possess, but if the condition is met, the general interest is transferred to the children. So, the children have a fee simple absolute (because the possibility interest is a fee simple absolute). But wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. The general interest is a fee simple absolute. The possibility interest is a fee simple absolute as well. So the general interest plus the possibility interest would mean that if the condition is met, the general interest (which is a fee simple absolute) is transferred to the children. So the children have a fee simple absolute.

But what if the condition is not met? The general interest remains, and the property is held as a general interest. So the children can't take it unless the condition is met.

Wait, but the original question is about the ownership rights to the vacant lot, considering all minors (the son, the daughter, etc.) are represented. So the children can take the property if the condition is met, but if not, they can't. So the children's interest is a fee simple absolute, but the general interest is a fee simple absolute as well.

Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because the general warranty deed would have created a general interest, which is a fee simple absolute. So the children's interest is a fee simple absolute. But that's not possible because the general warranty deed conveys a fee simple absolute. Wait, no—General warranty deed conveys a fee simple absolute, but when the condition is met, it creates a possibility interest in fee simple. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, let me think differently. The general warranty deed is a fee simple absolute, created with a general interest. Then, the condition (Church purposes) creates a possibility interest, which would allow the general interest to transfer to the children if the condition is met. So the children's interest is a transfer of the general interest, hence a fee simple absolute.

Wait, but that would mean the children have a fee simple absolute. But that's only if the condition is met. If the condition is not met, the general interest remains, so the children can't take it.

But the question is about the ownership rights to the vacant lot with all minors represented. So, the children, being minors, are considered. So, the children have a fee simple absolute upon the condition being met. So, the children take the property if the condition is triggered.

Wait, but wait. The general warranty deed conveys a fee simple absolute, so the general interest is a fee simple absolute. The possibility interest is a right to possess at the time of the transfer. So, when the condition is triggered, the general interest (fee simple absolute) is transferred to the children. So the children have a fee simple absolute. 

But, if the condition isn't met, the general interest remains, and the property is held as a fee simple absolute. So, the children don't take it, but the general interest is still a fee simple absolute.

Wait, no. Because the general warranty deed is a fee simple absolute. So, when the condition is met, the general interest is transferred to the children, making them hold a fee simple absolute. If the condition isn't met, the general interest remains, so the property is held as a fee simple absolute, and the children can't take it because they have a general interest—wait, no, because the general interest is a right to possess, so they can take it. I'm getting confused again.

Perhaps it's better to think in terms of conveyance steps. The general warranty deed conveys a fee simple absolute. The condition is a possibility interest that, if met, transfers the general interest to the children. So, upon the condition being met, the general interest (fee simple absolute) is transferred to the children, meaning the children have a fee simple absolute. But if the condition isn't met, the general interest remains, and the property is held as a fee simple, and the children can't take it unless they are minors (and they are) but in this case, the condition isn't met.

Wait, but if the condition isn't met, the general interest remains. So the property is still a fee simple absolute, and the children don't have a fee simple absolute. So perhaps the correct answer is that the children have a fee simple absolute when the condition is met. But when the condition isn't met, the general interest remains, so the children don't take the property as a fee simple absolute.

Wait, but the question is about the ownership rights to the property, considering all minors. So the children can take the property if the condition is triggered, but if not, the general interest remains, and the property isn't transferred.

Wait, perhaps the children have a fee simple absolute when the condition is met, but if the condition is not met, the general interest remains, so the property isn't transferred. So, if the condition is met, the children take the property; if not, they don't. But the question is about the ownership rights, so the children would have a fee simple absolute only if the condition is met, hence the answer would be that the children have a fee simple absolute. But wait, the question is about the ownership rights, so if the condition is met, they take the fee simple absolute. If not, they can't.

Wait, but the general warranty deed creates a general interest. Then, the condition creates a possibility interest. So, the children's interest is a possibility interest. So, upon the condition being met, they transfer the general interest to them. So, the children's right is a possibility interest—meaning they can take the property if the condition is met. But the general interest remains, so they can't take it unless the general interest is transferred.

Wait, no. A general interest is a right to possess; a possibility interest is a right to possess if the condition is met. So, the children have a possibility interest, meaning they can take the property if the condition is met. But if the condition isn't met, they can't take it. So, the children have a possibility interest, but the general interest remains. So, the general interest is a right to possess, but it's not transferred unless the condition is met.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to find another approach.

The general warranty deed conveys a fee simple absolute. The condition (Church purposes) creates a possibility interest. So, the children's interest is a possibility interest. So, the children can take the property if the condition is met, but only if the general interest is transferred. But the general interest is part of the deed, so if the condition is met, the general interest is transferred to the children, making them take the property as a fee simple absolute.

But if the condition isn't met, the general interest remains, so the children can't take it. But the general interest is a right to possess, so they can take it as a fee simple absolute if the general interest is transferred. Hmm, that seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the children's interest is a fee simple absolute. Wait, no, that can't be because the general warranty deed conveys a fee simple absolute. So the children's interest is a possibility interest, which is a fee simple absolute if the condition is met. So, if the condition is met, the children take a fee simple absolute. If not, the general interest remains, so the children can take the property as a general interest, but they can't transfer it.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the general interest is a right to possess. So, the children can take the property as a fee simple absolute. But if the condition isn't met, the general interest remains, so the children can take the property as a general interest. So perhaps the children have a fee simple absolute if the condition is met, and they can also take the general interest if the condition isn't met.

Wait, but that can't be right because the general interest is a fee simple absolute. So, the children's interest is a possibility interest, which is a fee simple absolute upon the condition being met. So, the children have a fee simple absolute upon the condition being met, and they can transfer it. If the condition isn't met, the general interest remains, so the children can take it as a general interest. But that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, the children's interest is a fee simple absolute if the condition is met, but if not, they can't take it. Because the general interest remains, so the children can't take it without the general interest being transferred.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the children's interest is a possibility interest, which is a fee simple absolute. But that would mean the children have a fee simple absolute regardless of the condition. But that doesn't fit.

I think I'm getting too stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently. The general warranty deed creates a general interest in fee simple. The condition creates a possibility interest. So, the children's interest is a possibility interest. So, the children can take the property if the condition is met, but only as a possibility interest. So, they can't take it unless the possibility interest is satisfied. 

Wait, but the condition is a possibility interest. So, the children's interest is a possibility interest in fee simple, meaning they can take the property if the condition is met. But the general interest is a fee simple absolute, so the children can't take it unless the general interest is transferred. So, the children have a transfer of the general interest if the condition is met, making them take it as a fee simple absolute. If the condition isn't met, the general interest remains, so the children can take the property as a general interest but not as a fee simple absolute.

Wait, but that seems too convoluted. Let's think about the options given in the question. The options are about who owns the property. The options include the friend, the sister, and the children.

Option J says the friend and the son and daughter. But when would that happen? The children would only be able to take it if the condition is met, but if it's not, the general interest remains, so the property isn't transferred. So, the children can't take it unless the condition is met.

Wait, but the general warranty deed is a fee simple absolute. So, the general interest remains. So, the children can't take the property unless the general interest is transferred. That would only happen if the condition is met, right?

So, if the condition is met, the general interest is transferred to the children, so they have a fee simple absolute. If not, the property remains as a general interest, and the children can't take it.

But the question is about the ownership rights to the vacant lot with all minors represented. So, if the condition is met, the children take the fee simple absolute. If not, they don't. But wait, the general warranty deed conveys a fee simple absolute. So, the children, upon the condition being met, would have a fee simple absolute, which would mean they own the property outright. If the condition isn't met, the general interest remains, so the property isn't transferred, and the children can't take it as a fee simple absolute. But they can take it as a general interest.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let's try to think about it step by step.

1. A general warranty deed creates a general interest in fee simple.
2. The condition (Church purposes) creates a possibility interest in fee simple.
3. The children's interest is a possibility interest in fee simple, meaning they can take the property if the condition is met. But, under some rules, a possibility interest in fee simple can be transferred to the grantor (friend) if the condition is met. So, when the condition is met, the general interest is transferred to the children, making them hold a fee simple absolute. If the condition isn't met, the general interest remains, so the children can take the property as a general interest, but not as a fee simple absolute. But wait, I thought the general interest is part of the deed, so the children's interest isn't just a possibility interest.

Wait, perhaps the children's interest is a fee simple absolute if the condition is met. But if the condition isn't met, the general interest remains, so the children can take the property as a general interest, but the general interest isn't transferred, so they can't take it as a fee simple absolute.

This is getting too tangled. Let me think about the possible answers.

Looking at the options, option J says friend and son and daughter. That would be the case if the children take the property when the condition is met. But under general warranty deed rules, when the condition is met, the general interest (fee simple absolute) is transferred to the children, so they have a fee simple absolute. But what about the general interest itself? It might also be considered as a fee simple absolute in this context.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: the general warranty deed creates a general interest in fee simple. The condition creates a possibility interest in fee simple. So, the possibility interest in fee simple would make the children take the property if the condition is met. But the general interest is a fee simple absolute. So, the children, if the condition is met, would have a fee simple absolute, so they take the property outright. So, the answer would be that the children own the property, but whether they are represented is another point. However, the question is about the ownership rights to the vacant lot with all minors represented. So, the children are minors, so their rights are considered.

But under general warranty deed rules, when the condition is met, the general interest is transferred to the children, making them own the property as a fee simple absolute. So, the answer would be J: the friend and the son and daughter. But wait, the son and daughter are minors, but the father's son and daughter are the children. So, the answer would be that the children are represented, so the ownership is theirs.

Wait, but the general warranty deed conveys a fee simple absolute. The condition creates a possibility interest in fee simple. So, the children's interest is a possibility interest in fee simple, which would mean they can take the property if the condition is met. But the general interest is a fee simple absolute, so the children's right is a transfer of the general interest, making them hold a fee simple absolute. So, the children have a fee simple absolute upon the condition being met.

But wait, the general interest is part of the deed, so the children's right is transferred, meaning they have a fee simple absolute. So, the answer would be that the children own the property, making the answer J.

Wait, but the general warranty deed conveys a fee simple absolute. So, the children's interest is a possibility interest in fee simple. So, they can take the property if the condition is met, but only as a possibility interest. The general interest remains as a fee simple absolute, but it's not transferred. So, the children can take it as a general interest, but not as a fee simple absolute.

Wait, no. The children's interest is a possibility interest, which is a right to possess if the condition is met. So, the children can take the property if the condition is met, but they can't take it as a fee simple absolute because the general interest is still a fee simple absolute.

So, in that case, the children can take the property if the condition is met, but the general interest remains, so the children can't take it without the general interest being transferred.

Wait, but the general warranty deed conveys a fee simple absolute. So, the children can take the property as a general interest if the condition is met. Or perhaps not. I'm getting stuck here.

Alternative approach: The general warranty deed conveys a fee simple absolute. The condition creates a possibility interest in fee simple. So, the possibility interest is a fee simple absolute. Therefore, the children, upon the condition being met, have a fee simple absolute. So, the answer would be J: the friend and the son and daughter.

Wait, but the general interest is a fee simple absolute. So, the children, upon the condition being met, have a fee simple absolute. So, they own the property as a fee simple absolute.

But the question is about the ownership rights to the vacant lot with all minors represented. So, the children are minors, so their rights are considered. So, the answer would be that the friend and the son and daughter have the property, making option J correct.

Wait, but the general warranty deed conveys a fee simple absolute. So, the general interest is already a fee simple absolute. So, when the condition is met, the children take the general interest as a fee simple absolute, making them the owners. So, the answer would be J.

But wait, the general warranty deed is a fee simple absolute. The condition creates a possibility interest in fee simple. So, the children, upon the condition being met, have a fee simple absolute. So, the answer is J.

Hmm, I think I'm getting closer. So, the correct answer would be J: the friend and the son and daughter.

The general warranty deed conveys a fee simple absolute, creating a general interest. The condition (Church purposes) creates a possibility interest in fee simple. The children's interest is a possibility interest in fee simple, meaning they can take the property if the condition is met. However, the general interest remains a fee simple absolute, and the children are minors, so their rights are considered. Therefore, the correct answer is J: the friend and the son and daughter.

ANSWER: J
