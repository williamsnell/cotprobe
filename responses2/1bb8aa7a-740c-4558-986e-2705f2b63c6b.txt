Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this question. The question is asking how many chromosomes all human somatic cells contain. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that somatic cells are the ones we can see and use, like the skin cells. 

Wait, chromosomes are the structures made up of DNA and proteins that carry the genetic information for each gene. Each chromosome has two sister chromatids attached to a centromere. Oh right, during cell division, like mitosis or meiosis, each chromosome splits into two daughter chromatids.

So, humans have 46 chromosomes. Let me think. I know that each of these 46 chromosomes consists of 24 pairs. So 46 is the total number. But wait, the question is about all human somatic cells, so including both the sperm and egg cells when they form gametes. No, wait, somatic cells are the ones we don't form gametes from. So each somatic cell has 46 chromosomes. 

Wait, what about the options? The options are A:30, B:24, C:44, D:3, E:23, F:22, G:42, H:48, I:46, J:20. Hmm. I'm pretty sure the answer is 46, which is option I. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the term 'chromosome' can be ambiguous. Like, each chromosome is a pair, so that's 46. But wait, the question says "all human somatic cells," and each cell has 46. So yes, I think the correct answer is 46.

The correct answer is **46**, which corresponds to option I. Each human somatic cell contains 46 chromosomes, as this is the standard number based on the 46 chromosomes in a human body.

Answer: I:46
