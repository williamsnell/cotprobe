Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Feinberg's work on Abraham Lincoln and his story. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question asks which option correctly describes how Feinberg's story relates to psychological egoism. So, I remember that Feinberg is a philosopher known for his work on the idea of psychological egoism. Psychological egoism is the theory that people's actions are motivated by their own desires and self-preservation, not external factors like others' feelings or abilities.

Feinberg's story, I think, involved the Lincoln story from "To Kill a Mockingbird." The story, which is actually a well-known piece of literature, might have some implications on how people view their own motivations. I recall that Feinberg's analysis of this story is meant to question psychological egoism, offering a different perspective.

Looking at the options: 

Option A says the story provides evidence against psychological egoism. That rings a bell. Feinberg's analysis suggests that people's actions are influenced by their own feelings, which goes against the idea that only self-driven actions matter.

Option B says it supports psychological altruism. I'm not so sure about that. altruism is about helping others, but Feinberg's story seems more about personal motivations rather than helping others.

Option C says it's irrelevant. No, Feinberg's story is definitely relevant to the discussion.

Option D: supports ethical egoism. Ethical egoism is that actions are motivated by self-interest because they help others, but Feinberg's story is about personal desires, so probably not.

Option E: proves psychological egoism. I don't think so; the story is about evidence against it, not proving it.

Option F: confusion between ethical and psychological egoism. Feinberg's story is about personal feelings, not about helping others, so maybe a confusion exists, but the correct answer is about evidence against.

Option G: no evidence. No, the story does provide evidence.

Option H: contradicts ethical egoism. But Feinberg's story is about personal motivations, not about helping others, so it's more about self-interest.

Option I: misinterpretation. Feinberg isn't misinterpreting; he's analyzing the story.

Option J: evidence for psychological egoism. That doesn't fit because Feinberg's analysis suggests the opposite.

So putting it all together, Feinberg's story shows that people's actions are driven by their own self-interest, which is against psychological egoism. So the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is A, as Feinberg's analysis of the Lincoln story demonstrates evidence against psychological egoism by highlighting the role of personal motivations.

Answer: A
