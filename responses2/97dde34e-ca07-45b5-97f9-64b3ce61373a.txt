Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about calculating the electromotive force, or EMF, of a mechanical device. Hmm, I remember that EMF is related to the potential difference created by the movement of charges through an electric field. 

The problem says the device moves a charge of 1.5 coulombs through a distance of 20 cm in an electric field of 2 × 10³ N/C. Wait, wait, let me make sure I get the units right. 

Electric field (E) is measured in N/C, right? So each coulomb of charge experiences a force of E multiplied by the charge. Oh wait, the formula is EMF equals E multiplied by the distance the charge moves. Wait, no, actually, I think it's EMF = E * d, but wait, isn't that when the charge is moving in a straight line perpendicular to the field? Or is it EMF = E * d * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the field and the direction of motion. 

Wait, no, wait. The electromotive force (EMF) is the potential difference generated by a source when a charge passes through it. But when a charge moves through a uniform electric field, the work done is equal to the force times distance. The force is E times the charge. So the work done per unit charge is E*d. Since EMF is the work done per unit charge, that would make EMF = E * d.

Wait, but wait—maybe I'm mixing up EMF with voltage. Oh no, EMF is the voltage generated, so yes, it's the same as voltage in a circuit. So EMF (in volts) is E (N/C) multiplied by the distance the charge moves. But wait, the distance is 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters. Oh, right.

So, E is 2000 N/C. Multiply that by 0.2 m. Let me calculate that: 2000 * 0.2 equals 400. So the EMF should be 400 volts. Looking at the options, option I is 400 volts. So that must be the answer. But wait, did I consider any other factors? Like, is the charge moving in a straight line? Oh, the question says it's a distance of 20 cm, so yes, it's perpendicular or at an angle, but the formula should still apply because it's the component of the electric field that's along the direction of motion. But wait, wait—no, if the charge is moving perpendicular to the electric field, then E*d is the work done per charge. Because electric field is in the direction of force only when the charge is moving in that direction. If it's moving perpendicularly, the force is zero. So the EMF would be zero, but wait, that's not the case here. Because the device is moving the charge through a distance, which suggests that the movement is in the direction of the electric field. Hmm, perhaps I got that wrong earlier.

Wait, no, the EMF is the potential difference, and it's the work done per unit charge. So regardless of the direction of motion, the work done is E * d, because the force is E*q, so the work is E*q * d, but for one coulomb, it's E*d. So yes, 2000 N/C * 0.2 m = 400 V. So option I is correct.

To calculate the electromotive force (EMF) of the mechanical device, we use the formula:

\[
\text{EMF} = E \cdot d
\]

where:
- \( E \) is the electric field strength in \( \text{N/C} \),
- \( d \) is the distance the charge moves in meters.

Given:
- \( E = 2 \times 10^3 \, \text{N/C} \),
- \( d = 20 \, \text{cm} = 0.2 \, \text{m} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{EMF} = (2 \times 10^3) \cdot (0.2) = 400 \, \text{volts}.
\]

Thus, the electromotive force of the device is **400 volts**, which corresponds to option **I**.
