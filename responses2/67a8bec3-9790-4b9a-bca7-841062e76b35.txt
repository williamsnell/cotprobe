Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about Kant's categorical imperative. The question is about what two general goals he's promoting. I remember that Kant's argument is about the moral duty to maximize one's own good. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

The question gives me several options, and I need to pick the correct two. Let me think. The options are A to I, and the last choice is E: promoting social harmony, F: self-sacrifice, etc.

Wait, Kant's categorical imperative is about the moral law. He argued that the best action is one that maximizes one's own self-interest. But I also remember that he considered the consequences of that action, which might relate to promoting others' ends as well because if you promote others, you might inadvertently affect your own well-being.

So, the two general goals might be promoting the ends of others and perhaps promoting personal happiness. Because he talks about the moral imperative as a maxim, which involves both self-interest and the interests of others. But wait, looking back at the options, there's an option E: promoting social harmony, which isn't directly about self-interest. Option I is attaining moral superiority, which is a different concept.

Wait, the question gives options A to I, and the correct answer is supposed to be two options. Let me think again. The first goal is promoting the ends of others. But what about the second? Does he promote personal goals (D), or self-perfection (B), or inner peace (C), or maximizing personal benefits (G), or producing happiness (H), or attaining moral superiority (I)?

Wait, Kant's original formulation, as I recall, includes promoting the ends of others as one goal, and also promoting the interests of one's own life, which might relate to personal goals. But looking at the options, the two correct answers are likely E and H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B and E.

Wait, another approach: Kant's categorical imperative is about self-interest, but he also considered the consequences, which might relate to promoting others' well-being. So the two general goals might be promoting the ends of others (which is option E) and promoting personal happiness (H), which is about maximizing personal benefits. Or, wait, the options don't have H as a separate choice, but E is promoting social harmony.

Wait, let me think again. The question states that we are obligated to adopt two very general goals: promoting the morally permissible ends of others and the goal of [something]. The options are A-E, etc.

I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall what Kant said specifically. Oh, right, in his ethical theory, he distinguishes between two kinds of ends: those of others and those of the self. The imperative is to maximize one's own ends. So the two general goals are promoting the ends of others (which is option E: promoting social harmony) and promoting the interests of one's own life (which would correspond to maximizing personal benefits, perhaps as in option G: maximizing personal benefits). But wait, the two options given must be E and H.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:
A: increasing social status
B: self-perfection
C: achieving inner peace
D: achieving personal goals
E: promoting social harmony.
F: self-sacrifice.
G: maximizing personal benefits.
H: producing happiness.
I: attaining moral superiority.

So, the first goal is promoting others' ends (E). The second goal, what's Kant's main point? He says, "from our own ends we should act, and we should also take care of our own ends." Or, perhaps, the second goal is also about personal well-being. Wait, I might have gotten this wrong before. Let me think: the first goal is promoting the ends of others, and the second is about promoting the interests of one's own life, which might be about self-interest and personal goals. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the two general goals are promoting the ends of others and promoting the interests of one's own life. But in the options, the second goal is not listed as such. Let's see:

Looking for two options from A to I. Oh, the options are E and H. Because E is promoting social harmony, which is about others' ends, and H is about producing happiness, which is about personal well-being.

Wait, but the question says "two very general goals" so perhaps:

The first is promoting the ends of others, which is E. The second is promoting the interests of one's own life, which would be about personal goals. But looking at the options, the second goal isn't listed as another option. So which of the options correspond to the two.

Wait, the options are A to I, with E and H as the last two. So, the two goals are promoting the ends of others (E) and maximizing personal benefits (G). But G is not an option, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the possible answers. The options are A to I, and the question is about two goals. I think the correct answer is E and H. Because E is promoting social harmony (which is another way of promoting others' ends), and H is about producing happiness, which is about personal well-being.

Wait, but the question may not be referring to the same as Kant's original. Let me think again. I've read that Kant's categorical imperative includes two aspects: promoting the ends of others and promoting the ends of one's own life. So among the options, the two general goals are promoting the ends of others (E) and promoting one's own well-being (maybe H).

Alternatively, the options are E: promoting social harmony (which is about others' ends), and H: producing happiness (which is about personal well-being). So the two are E and H.

Another possibility: the first goal is promoting the ends of others (E) and the second is achieving personal goals (D), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the second goal is about self-perfection (B), but that's a more specific goal.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall. Kant's categorical imperative is about the maxim of self-interest, but also about the consequences. The two general goals are promoting the ends that others would have, and promoting the ends that one's own self would have. So the two are promoting the ends of others (E) and promoting the ends of oneself (which isn't directly an option). But the options given don't include that.

Alternatively, the two general goals are promoting the ends of others and promoting the interests of one's own life. Wait, but the interests of one's own life are about personal goals or self-interest. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the two goals are promoting the ends of others and promoting the ends of one's own self. But the options don't have that. So maybe the question is referring to the two options as E and H.

Wait, the options are:

E: promoting social harmony.

H: producing happiness.

So, the answer would be E and H.

Wait, but the question is asking for the two very general goals. So the first is promoting others' ends, which is E, and the second is promoting personal well-being, which is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the second goal is self-perfection (B): self-perfection is about oneself being a good person, which is more about the self's moral standards. So the two goals might be E and H.

So the correct answer would be E and H. But looking at the options, the choices are E and H as separate options, so the answer would be E and H. But the options list E and H as separate choices, so the answer is E and H.
</think>

The correct answer is E and H. Kant's categorical imperative includes two general goals: promoting the ends of others (E) and promoting the interests of one's own life (H). These correspond to promoting social harmony and producing happiness, respectively.

Answer: E and H.
