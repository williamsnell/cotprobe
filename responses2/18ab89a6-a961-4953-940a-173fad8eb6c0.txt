Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about finding the work expended when carrying a certain amount of charge through a nonuniform electric field. The field is given as E = y a_x + x a_y + 2 a_z. So, E has components in the x, y, and z directions. 

The task is to move 2 coulombs from point B (1,0,1) to point A (0.8, 0.6, 1) along the shorter arc of a circle defined by x² + y² = 1 and z = 1. Hmm, okay. 

Wait, so the path is along the circle x² + y² =1 at z=1. The circle lies in the plane z=1, right? So the points are B and A. Let me plot these points in that plane. 

Point B is (1,0,1). Wait, wait, x² + y² =1. So x=1, y=0. That's on the edge of the circle. Point A is (0.8, 0.6, 1). Let me check: 0.8² is 0.64, 0.6² is 0.36. Sum is 1. So that's also on the circle. 

Wait, so the circle is x² + y² =1, z=1. So, the points are (1,0,1) and (0.8,0.6,1). The question is about the shorter arc between them. 

I need to find the work done. Work done by the electric field is the integral of E · dl along the path. But wait, depending on the path, the work might vary. But in electrostatics, the work done between two points is path-independent if the field is conservative. So, wait, is E a conservative field?

Oh right! E is a conservative field because the curl is zero if the field is the gradient of some scalar potential. Let me see. The curl is calculated as the determinant of the gradient operators. For E = (E_x, E_y, E_z) = (y, x, 2), the curl would be:

Components of curl E:
- (dEz/dy - dE_y/dz) = (0 - 0) = 0
- (dEx/dz - dEz/dx) = (0 - 0) = 0
- (dEy/dx - dEx/dy) = (x - y) 

Wait, wait, that's (x - y) in the z-component. So for E to be conservative, this curl must be zero everywhere. But in this case, (x - y) isn't zero everywhere. So the field isn't conservative. That means the integral depends on the path taken. So if we take different paths between A and B, the work done would differ. 

But wait, the question says to move along the shorter arc. So I need to compute the work along that specific path. 

Wait, but if the field isn't conservative, then the work depends on the path. Hmm, but maybe I can parametrize the path and compute the integral.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to relate the work done via the potential difference. But wait, only conservative fields have a potential. If the field isn't conservative, then the potential isn't a scalar function. So perhaps that approach isn't directly applicable.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the work done, which is the integral of E · dl. So perhaps I should parametrize the path and compute the integral.

Let me think about the path. The circle is x² + y² =1 at z=1. So the points are (1,0,1) and (0.8,0.6,1). The shorter arc would be the smaller of the two possible arcs. Since (1,0) is on the x-axis, and (0.8,0.6) is in the first quadrant, the angle between them can be found.

Let me compute the angle between these points on the circle. At point B, (1,0), so angle is 0 radians. At point A, (0.8, 0.6), the angle can be found using tan(theta) = y/x = 0.6/0.8 = 0.75. So theta = arctan(0.75) ≈ 36.87 degrees (pi/5 radians, since 18 degrees is pi/10, 36.87 is about pi/5, which is 36 degrees). 

Wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate that again. 0.75 is 3/4, so the opposite over adjacent is 3/4, so the angle is arctan(3/4) = approximately 36.87 degrees. So pi/5 is about 36 degrees, so that's correct. So the angle between B and A is pi/5.

So the path is a 36 degrees arc, which is the shorter path. So the length of the arc is r * theta, where r is 1 (since x² + y² =1), and theta is pi/5. So length is 1 * pi/5 = pi/5. But wait, units? Since E is given in terms of a_x, a_y, a_z, but the options are in joules. So the work done would be the integral of E · dl along this path.

Wait, but since E isn't conservative, the work depends on the path. However, in some cases, if the electric field is conservative, the work would be conservative and only depend on initial and final points. But since it's not conservative, the work depends on the path. 

Wait, but wait, another approach: If the electric field is conservative, then the work done is the potential difference multiplied by the charge. But since it's not conservative, that approach doesn't hold. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, the electric field is: E = y a_x + x a_y + 2 a_z. Let me compute the gradient of the potential. If E is the gradient of the potential, then E_x = -dV/dx, E_y = -dV/dy, E_z = -dV/dz.

Wait, let's compute the curl of E. The curl is zero? Because E has components y, x, and 2. Let me compute the curl using the formula:

curl E = (dEz/dy - dEy/dz) a_x + (dEx/dz - dEz/dx) a_y + (dEy/dx - dEx/dy) a_z.

Given E = (y, x, 2):

dEz/dy = d(2)/dy = 0. dEy/dz = d(x)/dz = 0. So first component is 0.

dEx/dz = d(y)/dz = 0. dEz/dx = d(2)/dx =0. So second component is 0.

Third component: dEy/dx = d(x)/dx =1. dEx/dy = d(y)/dy =1. So (1 -1)=0. So curl E is zero. Oh, so the field is conservative. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, wait, no, because I thought that for E to be conservative, the curl must be zero. But in this case, all three components of the curl are zero. So E is indeed a conservative field. Oh, that's a relief. So the work done is path-independent. So I can compute the work along either path, regardless of the shape.

So, this simplifies the problem significantly. So the work done only depends on the initial and final points, not on the path.

So the work done by E on the charge is the same along any path from B to A. So I can choose the simplest path, which is along the circle.

Wait, but wait, the circle would allow us to parameterize it and compute the integral. Alternatively, perhaps finding a potential function would help.

Wait, so E is conservative, so there exists a scalar potential V such that E = -∇V. Let's find V.

So E_x = y = - ∂V/∂x → ∂V/∂x = -y.

E_y = x = - ∂V/∂y → ∂V/∂y = -x.

E_z = 2 = - ∂V/∂z → ∂V/∂z = -2.

Integrate E_x: V = ∫ (-y) dx = -xy + f(y,z) 

Now, take partial derivative with respect to y:

dV/dy = -x + (∂f/∂y) = -x → (∂f/∂y) =0 → f is independent of y.

Similarly, ∂V/∂z = -2 → V = -xy -2z + C.

Wait, that's the potential function. So V = -xy -2z + C. The constant can be set to zero for simplicity.

So, the work done in moving from B to A is the negative of the potential difference (since W = q (V_initial - V_final) ), but wait, W is the work done by the field, which is q (V_initial - V_final). Wait, let me think. The work done by the electric field is equal to q (V_initial - V_final). Because when moving from point B to A, the potential decreases if V_final < V_initial.

Wait, in this case, from B to A, the potential at B is V(B) = -x_B y_B - 2 z_B. x_B =1, y_B=0, z_B=1. So V(B) = -(1)(0) -2(1)= -2.

At A, x=0.8, y=0.6, z=1. So V(A)= -(0.8)(0.6) -2(1) = -0.48 -2 = -2.48.

So the change in potential is V_A - V_B = (-2.48) - (-2) = (-0.48) J.

Now, the work done by the field is W = q (V_A - V_B) = 2 C * (-0.48 J/C) = 2 * (-0.48) = -0.96 J.

Wait, but wait, the work done by the field is negative, implying that the field is doing negative work on the charge, meaning the charge is losing potential energy. But the question is asking for the work expended, which is the work done by the field. So it's negative 0.96 J. But looking at the options, the closest is option A: 0.96 J. 

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. The work done by the field on the charge is W = q (V_initial - V_final). So when moving from B to A, the charge goes from a higher potential (V_B = -2) to a lower potential (V_A = -2.48). So the charge is going from a higher potential to a lower one, meaning it's losing potential energy. So the work done by the field is positive. Wait, no, because the potential decreases, so the work done by the field is positive. 

Wait, no, I think I got the formula wrong. The work done by the field is W = q (V_final - V_initial). Or is it negative of that? Let me think again. The potential energy of a charge in an electric field is U = q V. The work done by the field is W = -ΔU, so W = - (q (V_final - V_initial)).

Wait, that's perhaps the correct approach. Because when the charge moves from B to A, the potential changes from V_B to V_A. So the change in potential energy is U_A - U_B = q(V_A - V_B). The work done by the field is the negative of this because the field does work to move the charge against the electric field.

So, W = -(U_A - U_B) = -(q (V_A - V_B)).

So substituting the values:

W = - (2 C * ( (-2.48) - (-2) )) = - (2 * (-0.48)) = - (-0.96) )= 0.96 J.

Wait, that makes sense. So the work done by the field is positive 0.96 J, which is option A. 

But wait, earlier I thought the work done would be negative. Now I'm getting positive. So which is correct?

Wait, the work done by the field is the integral of E · dl from B to A. Since the field is conservative, this should equal q (V_initial - V_final). So W = q (V_initial - V_final).

So V_initial is the potential at B, V_final is at A.

So W = 2 [ (-2.48) - (-2) ] = 2 (-0.48) = -0.96 J. 

Wait, now I'm confused. What's the correct formula?

Wait, the work done by the electric field is W = q [V_initial - V_final]. So if V_initial is higher than V_final, then W is positive.

In this case, moving from B to A, V decreases. So V_A is less than V_B. Thus, V_initial (B) is -2, V_final (A) is -2.48. So V_initial - V_final is (-2) - (-2.48) = 0.48. So 2 * 0.48 = 0.96 J.

So the work done by the field is 0.96 J, which is positive. So the answer should be A: 0.96 J.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the integral, I was confused because the field is conservative but the path matters. But since it's conservative, the work doesn't depend on the path, so the answer is the same as the potential difference.

So the correct answer is A: 0.96 J.

To determine the work expended in carrying a charge of \( q = 2 \, \text{C} \) from point \( B(1,0,1) \) to point \( A(0.8,0.6,1) \) along the shorter arc of the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) at \( z = 1 \), we use the fact that the electric field \( \mathbf{E} = y \, \mathbf{a}_x + x \, \mathbf{a}_y + 2 \, \mathbf{a}_z \) is conservative. This allows us to calculate the work done using the potential difference between the two points.

### Step 1: Determine the potential function
The electric field is conservative, so there exists a scalar potential function \( V \) such that \( \mathbf{E} = -\nabla V \). By integrating the components of \( \mathbf{E} \), we find:
\[
V(x, y, z) = -xy - 2z + C,
\]
where \( C \) is a constant (set to zero for simplicity).

### Step 2: Calculate the potential at points \( B \) and \( A \)
- At \( B(1,0,1) \):
\[
V(B) = -(1)(0) - 2(1) = -2 \, \text{J}.
\]
- At \( A(0.8,0.6,1) \):
\[
V(A) = -(0.8)(0.6) - 2(1) = -0.48 - 2 = -2.48 \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the work done
The work done by the electric field is given by:
\[
W = q (V_B - V_A).
\]
Substituting \( q = 2 \, \text{C} \), \( V_B = -2 \, \text{J} \), and \( V_A = -2.48 \, \text{J} \):
\[
W = 2 \cdot (-2 - (-2.48)) = 2 \cdot (0.48) = 0.96 \, \text{J}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The work expended in carrying the charge is \( 0.96 \, \text{J} \).
