Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, it's about two trains approaching a stationary observer, and they're both sounding their whistles. The observer hears 5 beats per second. I need to find the speed of the second train based on the given parameters.

Let me jot down the details. The two trains are moving along parallel tracks in opposite directions. One train is moving at 50 mph. The other train's speed I don't know yet; let's call it 'v' mph. Both whistles have a frequency of 350 cycles per second, which is 350 Hz. The speed of sound in air is given as 750 mph. The observer hears 5 beats per second, which is a beat frequency of 5 Hz.

Wait, beats. Oh right, beats occur when two sound waves interfere, and the beat frequency is the absolute difference between the two frequencies. So, if one source is at 350 Hz and the other is at, say, 350 + Δf Hz, the beat frequency is Δf. But in this case, since both trains are emitting their own whistles, the observer will hear the sum of their frequencies if they are moving towards the observer in the same direction, but wait, wait. Wait no, when two objects move towards a stationary observer, the observed frequencies change based on their own speeds.

Wait, but in this problem, the two trains are moving towards each other. One is moving at 50 mph, the other at 'v' mph. So both are approaching the observer. So, the observed frequency from each train will be higher than their emitted frequency because of the Doppler effect.

Wait, the Doppler effect formula for a moving observer towards a stationary observer is f' = f * (v_sound) / (v_sound - v_observer), but wait, no, that's when the observer is moving towards the source. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the Doppler shift formula depends on whether the source is moving or the observer is moving. Since both are approaching the observer, let me think about each train's contribution to the observed beat frequency.

Wait, the observer hears two frequencies: from each train, and the beat is the difference between these two frequencies. So, the observer hears a higher frequency from the first train and a lower one from the second, or vice versa, and the beat frequency is the difference between them.

So, let me formalize this. Let's say the first train is moving towards the observer at 50 mph. The second is moving towards the observer at 'v' mph. The speed of sound is 750 mph, and the emitted frequencies are 350 Hz each.

The observed frequency from the first train (f1) would be f0 * (v_sound) / (v_sound - v1), where v1 is the speed of the first train. Similarly, the observed frequency from the second train (f2) would be f0 * (v_sound) / (v_sound - v2), where v2 is the speed of the second train.

Wait, but both are approaching, so their denominators are (v_sound - vtrain), and since they are moving towards, those denominators are less than v_sound, so f1 and f2 are higher than 350 Hz.

The beat frequency is |f1 - f2| = 5 Hz. So, the difference between these two observed frequencies is 5 Hz.

So, let me write that equation:

| (350 * 750 / (750 - 50)) ) - (350 * 750 / (750 - v)) ) | = 5

Wait, wait. But wait, let me be precise. Since the two trains are approaching, their observed frequencies are both higher than 350 Hz. So, the observer hears a higher frequency from the first train and a lower one from the second, so the beat is the difference (f1 - f2), which equals 5 Hz.

But let me compute f1 and f2.

Let me compute the speed of sound, but wait, the units are given as mph. Oh, but wait, the units are in mph, but the speed of sound is given in mph as well, so maybe I don't need to convert them.

Wait, the speed of sound is 750 mph. So, for the first train, v1 =50 mph.

f1 = 350 * 750 / (750 -50) = 350 *750 /700.

Wait, let me compute that: 350 * 750 = 262500. Divided by 700: 262500 /700 = 375 Hz.

Similarly, for the second train: f2 =350 *750/(750 - v).

The beat frequency is f1 - f2 =5 Hz.

Wait, so:

375 - [350 *750/(750 - v)] =5

Wait, let me solve for v.

So,

375 -5 = 350 *750/(750 -v)

370 = (350 *750)/(750 -v)

Multiply both sides by (750 -v):

370 * (750 -v) =350 *750

Let's compute that.

370 *750 = 277500.

370 *750 - 370 v = 277500.

Wait, 370*(750 -v) =350*750 → 370*(750 -v) = 262500.

So,

750 -v = 262500 /370.

Compute 262500 ÷370. Let me calculate that.

370 *700 = 259000. 262500 -259000=3500.

3500/370 ≈9.4595.

So 700 +9.4595= 709.4595.

So,

750 -v ≈709.4595

→ v =750 -709.4595 ≈40.5405 mph.

So approximately 40.54 mph.

Looking at the options, option B is 40.5 mph or 59.2 mph. So, would the second train be moving at 40.5 mph towards the observer, or perhaps moving away? No, wait, both are approaching. So the second train's speed would be around 40.5 mph.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the problem says the observer hears 5 beats per second, which is 5 Hz. So, the difference f1 - f2 is 5 Hz.

But wait, if the second train is moving faster, then f2 would be higher than f1. So, their observed frequencies would be f1=375 and f2=350*750/(750 -v). So f2 would be higher than f1 if the denominator (750-v) is smaller than 700 → which it is when v is positive (since v is less than 750, otherwise the denominator would be negative and f2 would be negative, which doesn't make sense). So, f2 must be higher than f1. So, f1 - f2 would be negative. So, |f1 - f2|=5 Hz → f2 - f1 =5.

Wait, I think I messed up earlier. Let me correct that.

Wait, when both are approaching, the observed frequency from the first train (f1) would be higher than the emitted frequency because the denominator (750-50) is smaller than 750. So f1 = (350 *750)/700=375 Hz.

Similarly, the second train's f2 would be (350 *750)/(750 -v). Now, if v is less than 750, because if v was more than 750, the denominator would be negative, which would make f2 negative, which is impossible. So v must be less than 750 mph.

So, if the second train is moving towards the observer, both have f2 >350 Hz, but since the first train is approaching, f1 is higher than 350.

But if the second train's speed is such that (750 -v) is less than 700 → v >50 mph (since 750 -v <700 → v>50). Wait, but since both are moving towards the observer, if the second train's speed is higher than 50, then (750 -v) would be lower, making f2 higher than f1. Which would lead to f2 > f1, so f1 -f2 would be negative, so the beat is f2 -f1 =5 Hz.

So the equation would be f2 -f1 = 5.

Wait, let me correct that. So:

f2 - f1 =5 Hz.

So,

350 *750/(750 -v) -375 =5.

So,

(350 *750)/(750 -v) =375 +5=380.

So,

(350 *750) =380*(750 -v).

Compute 350 *750 =262500.

So,

262500 =380*(750 -v).

Divide both sides by 380:

262500 /380 =750 -v.

Compute 262500 /380. Let's compute:

380 × 700 =266000. 262500 is less than that. So 700 ×380=266000. 262500 is 266000 - 3500, so 700 - (3500/380).

3500/380 ≈9.2105.

So 700 -9.2105=690.7895.

So,

750 -v ≈690.7895

→v =750 -690.7895 ≈59.2105 mph.

So v ≈59.2 mph.

So, the second train must be moving at approximately 59.2 mph towards the observer, making the beat frequency 5 Hz.

Looking at the options, option B says 40.5 mph or 59.2 mph. So, perhaps both are possible, but wait, no. Because the equation I set up led to v≈40.5 or 59.2. Wait, no, the equation after correcting for the beat direction is 59.2. But wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier because when I first did the equation, I had (375 -f2) =5, leading to f2=370 Hz. But in reality, if the second train is moving faster than the first, then f2 would be higher than f1, so the beat is f2 -f1 =5 Hz.

So the correct equation gives v=59.2105 mph.

So the correct answer is B: 40.5 mph or 59.2 mph?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, in this scenario, both are moving towards the observer. So, their observed frequencies are both higher than 350 Hz.

If the second train is moving faster than 50 mph, then (750 -v) is less than 700. So, the denominator is smaller → f2 is larger than f1.

So, if f2 > f1, then the beat is f2 -f1 =5.

So, f2 =350 *750/(750 -v) → which is larger than 350.

So, solving that equation gives v=59.2 mph.

Wait, but the first train's f1 is 375 Hz. So, if the second train's f2 is 375 +5=380 Hz, because the beat is 5 Hz.

Wait, let's compute f2.

f2 =380 Hz.

So,

380 = (350 *750)/(750 -v).

So,

350 *750 =380*(750 -v)

262500 =380 *750 -380v.

Compute 380 *750: 380 *700=266000, 380 *50=19000. So total 266000+19000=285000.

So,

262500 =285000 - 380 v.

→262500 -285000 = -380 v.

→-22500 =-380 v → v=22500/380 → approximately 59.2105 mph.

So that's approximately 59.21 mph. So v must be approximately 59.2 mph.

Looking back at the options, option B is 40.5 or 59.2. So the answer would be 59.2 mph.

Wait, but why is option B present as 40.5 or 59.2?

Ah, perhaps if the second train is moving away, but wait no. Both are moving towards the observer, so the second train's speed must be 59.2 mph.

Wait, but let me double-check. Wait, what if the second train is moving slower than 50 mph? No, because that would make the denominator bigger, so f2 would be lower than 375, making the beat f1 -f2 =5. So, f2 =375 -5=370 Hz.

Let me compute that.

f2 =370 Hz = (350 *750)/(750 -v).

So,

350 *750 =370*(750 -v).

262500 =370 *750 -370 v.

Compute 370 *750: 370*700=259000, 370*50=18500 → total 277500.

So,

262500 =277500 -370 v.

→262500 -277500= -370 v → -15000= -370 v → v=15000/370 ≈40.5405 mph.

So, v≈40.5 mph.

So, if the second train is moving slower than 50 mph, its speed would be around 40.5 mph, but wait, that's the case where the observed frequency f2 is 370 Hz, so the beat would be f1 -f2=5 Hz.

So, in this scenario, the second train's speed could be either 40.5 mph or 59.2 mph, depending on which way the beat is.

Wait, but the problem states that the observer hears 5 beats per second. The beat is the absolute difference, so either the second train is faster (59.2) or slower than the first (40.5). But wait, can the second train be moving faster than the first? Yes, because both are approaching.

So, this scenario allows two possible speeds for the second train: approximately 40.5 mph and 59.2 mph.

So, the correct options involve both, which is option B: 40.5 mph or 59.2 mph.

So, the correct answer is option B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the Doppler effect for two trains approaching a stationary observer. The observer hears a beat frequency of 5 Hz, meaning the difference between the observed frequencies of the two trains is 5 Hz. The trains are moving in opposite directions, with one traveling at 50 mph and the other at unknown speed \( v \). The speed of sound is given as 750 mph.

### Step 1: Observed Frequencies
The observed frequency from each train is given by the Doppler effect formula:
\[
f_{\text{observed}} = f_{\text{source}} \cdot \frac{v_{\text{sound}}}{v_{\text{sound}} - v_{\text{train}}}
\]
where:
- \( f_{\text{source}} = 350 \, \text{Hz} \),
- \( v_{\text{sound}} = 750 \, \text{mph} \).

For the first train (\( v_{\text{train}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \)):
\[
f_1 = \frac{350 \cdot 750}{750 - 50} = \frac{262500}{700} = 375 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

For the second train (\( v_{\text{train}} = v \)):
\[
f_2 = \frac{350 \cdot 750}{750 - v}.
\]

### Step 2: Beat Frequency Condition
The observer hears a beat frequency of 5 Hz, meaning:
\[
|f_1 - f_2| = 5 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

Since both trains are approaching the observer, \( f_1 > 350 \, \text{Hz} \) and \( f_2 > 350 \, \text{Hz} \). The beat frequency equation becomes:
\[
f_1 - f_2 = 5 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( v \)
Substitute \( f_1 = 375 \, \text{Hz} \) and \( f_2 = \frac{262500}{750 - v} \) into the equation:
\[
375 - \frac{262500}{750 - v} = 5.
\]

Rearrange:
\[
\frac{262500}{750 - v} = 375 - 5 = 370.
\]

Solve for \( 750 - v \):
\[
750 - v = \frac{262500}{370} \approx 709.4595.
\]

Solve for \( v \):
\[
v = 750 - 709.4595 = 40.5405 \, \text{mph}.
\]

Thus, the second train's speed is approximately \( 40.5 \, \text{mph} \).

### Step 4: Consider Both Directions
If the second train is faster than the first, its observed frequency \( f_2 \) would be higher than \( f_1 \), leading to a beat frequency of 5 Hz. Solving for \( v \) in this case:
\[
f_2 = 370 \, \text{Hz} = \frac{262500}{750 - v}.
\]

Rearrange:
\[
750 - v = \frac{262500}{370} \approx 709.4595.
\]

Solve for \( v \):
\[
v = 750 - 709.4595 = 59.2405 \, \text{mph}.
\]

Thus, the second train's speed could also be approximately \( 59.2 \, \text{mph} \).

### Final Answer
The second train's speed must be either \( 40.5 \, \text{mph} \) or \( 59.2 \, \text{mph} \). This corresponds to option **B**.
