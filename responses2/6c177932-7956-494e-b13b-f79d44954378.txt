Okay, so I've got this question about the work function of potassium metal. Hmm, I remember that the work function is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron from the metal's surface. Oh right, and the formula relates this to the threshold wavelength. 

The formula I think is E = hc / λ, where E is the energy, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. Oh wait, right, that's from Einstein's photoelectric equation. So I need to plug in the numbers.

The question says the threshold wavelength is 564 nm. Oh wait, nm is nanometers, so I need to convert that to meters because the other constants should be in SI units. So 564 nm is 564e-9 meters. 

Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. So multiplying h and c gives hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8. Let me calculate that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. 

Wait, but wait a second, maybe I should be more precise. Let me compute h*c. 

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s
c = 299792458 m/s (exact value)
So, h*c = 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 ≈ Let's compute that. 6.626e-34 * 3e8 is about 1.9878e-25, but maybe I should do the exact calculation. Alternatively, I can just use the exact value for now.

So hc = 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 = let's see, 6.62607015 * 2.99792458 = approximately 19.86e-26 (because 6.626e-34 *3e8 is 1.9878e-25, but let me get it right). Alternatively, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = (6.626 * 3) * 1e-34+8 = 19.878 * 1e-26 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. 

Wait, but to be precise, maybe I should calculate it with exact numbers. Let me compute 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 6.626 *3 =19.878, and exponents are 1e-34 *1e8 = 1e-26. So 19.878e-26 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. 

So hc = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Now the wavelength is 564 nm, which is 564e-9 m. So λ = 564e-9 m.

So E = hc / λ = (1.9878e-25) / (564e-9).

Let me compute that. Let's compute the denominator first: 564e-9 is 5.64e-7 m.

So 1.9878e-25 / 5.64e-7 = Let's compute 1.9878 / 5.64 first. 5.64 goes into 1.9878 how many times?

5.64 * 0.355 = approximately 2.00 (since 5.64 * 0.35 is 1.974, and 0.005 *5.64 is 0.0282, so 0.355 *5.64 is about 2.00. So 1.9878 is about 0.355 times 5.64.

Wait, 5.64 *0.355 is 5.64 * (355/1000) )= (5.64 *355)/1000. Let me compute 5.64 *355. 

5 * 355 = 1775, 0.64 *355=227.2. So total is 1775 +227.2 =2002.2. Divided by 1000 is 2.0022. So 5.64 * 0.355 = about 2.0022. But our denominator is 5.64e-7, and the numerator is 1.9878e-25. So the division is (1.9878 /5.64) * 1e-25 /1e-7 = (approx 0.355) * 1e-18 = 3.55e-19 J.

Wait, but let me be more precise. Let me compute 1.9878e-25 /5.64e-7.

Which is 1.9878 /5.64 = approximately 0.355. So 0.355e-25 /1e-7 = 0.355 *1e-18 = 3.55e-19 J.

Wait, but let me compute 1.9878 /5.64 more accurately. Let me do this division.

5.64 ) 1.9878 (0.355

5.64 * 0.355:

5 *0.355 = 1.775
0.64 *0.355=0.2272
Sum: 1.775 +0.2272=1.9982.

Wait, the numerator is 1.9878. So 0.355 *5.64 is 1.9982, which is a bit larger than 1.9878. So the actual value is a bit less than 0.355. Let's see, 1.9878 is 0.0104 less than 1.9982.

So the difference is 1.9982 -1.9878 = 0.0104.

So how much less?

Each 1 unit in 5.64 would give 0.0104 /5.64 ≈ 0.001847.

So perhaps 0.355 - 0.001847 ≈ 0.35315.

So approximately 0.35315.

So 0.35315e-18 J → 3.5315e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option F is 3.52e-19, and option G is 3.98e-19.

Wait, so 3.53e-19 is close to option F's 3.52e-19. Are the options precise? Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 4.65e-19
B: 2.78e-19
C:5.00
D:2.21
E:3.01
F:3.52
G:3.98
H:2.50
I:1.67
J:4.20.

So the calculated value is approximately 3.53e-19, which is closest to option F (3.52e-19). So the answer should be F.

To determine the work function of potassium metal, we use the formula:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 564 \, \text{nm} = 564 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) (threshold wavelength).

First, calculate \( hc \):
\[
hc = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3.00 \times 10^8 = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator \( \lambda \):
\[
\lambda = 564 \times 10^{-9} = 5.64 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
\]

Now, divide \( hc \) by \( \lambda \):
\[
E = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{5.64 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{1.9878}{5.64} \times 10^{-25 + 7} = 0.353 \times 10^{-18} = 3.53 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Comparing this result to the given options:
- Option F: \( 3.52 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) is the closest match.

Thus, the work function of potassium metal is approximately \( 3.52 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).
