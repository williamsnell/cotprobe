Alright, so I've got this problem here about Abby driving and estimating her total miles over 5 days. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the question says Abby drives 18 miles round trip each day. Round trip means going somewhere and coming back, so that's 18 miles per day. Now, she rounds this number to the nearest 5 miles each day. Then, we need to find the best estimate for the total miles she would drive in 5 days.

Hmm, round trip is 18 miles, so rounding that to the nearest 5. Let's see, 18 is between 15 and 20. The midpoint between 15 and 20 is 17.5, right? So anything 17.5 or above would round up to 20. Since 18 is just above 17.5, it would round up to 20 miles per day.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. If I have 18, is it closer to 15 or 20? The difference from 15 is 3, and from 20 is 2. So 18 is closer to 20. So yes, she would drive 20 miles each day.

Now, if she drives 20 miles each day for 5 days, the total miles would be 20 multiplied by 5. Let me calculate that. 20*5 is 100 miles. So the total would be 100 miles over 5 days.

Looking at the options, option J is 100 miles. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in rounding. Let's see: 18 is 18, which is 18-15=3, and 20-18=2. Since 3 is more than 2, it's closer to 20. So yes, 20 is correct.

Another way: 18 is 18, and to the nearest 5. 15, 20, 25, etc. 15 is 3 away, 20 is 2 away. So yes, 20 is correct.

So the daily round trip is 20 miles. Over 5 days, that's 100. So option J is 100 miles, which is the best estimate.

The correct answer is J: 100 miles.
