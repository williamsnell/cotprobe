Question:

The distribution of salaries of a county school system with 4,752 employees is known to be right skewed, with the superintendent’s salary an outlier on the higher side. A random sample of 20 employees was taken and their salaries recorded. A 95 percent t-confidence interval for the mean salary of the county school system employees is ($15,360, $32,470). The t-confidence interval is not appropriate in this situation because

Options:

A: the sample size is too large compared to the number of employees in the system to give a fair representation
B: the sample size is too small compared to the number of employees in the system to give a fair representation
C: a 95 percent t-confidence interval is not appropriate for this kind of data
D: the teacher salaries are not negotiable, but the superintendent’s salary is negotiable, so the superintendent’s salary should be excluded from the population sampled
E: the population standard deviation of the salaries of employees of this county school system is known
F: the salary distribution is not right skewed, but left skewed
G: the skewed salary distribution tells us that assumption of normality of the sampled population will not be satisfied
H: the population standard deviation of the salaries of employees of this county school system is not known
I: the superintendent's salary is not an outlier on the higher side
J: the teacher salaries are negotiable, and the superintendent’s salary is not negotiable, so the superintendent’s salary should be included in the population sampled

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about statistics, specifically dealing with confidence intervals and distributions. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that the salaries of a county school system are right-skewed. That means the distribution has a long tail on the right side. They took a random sample of 20 employees and found a 95% confidence interval for the mean salary as ($15,360, $32,470). But the question is why a t-confidence interval isn't appropriate here.

Hmm. Right-skewed distributions usually aren't normal, which is a big issue for t-tests because they assume normality. Oh wait, let's think about what the t-test requires. The t-test assumes that the data is normally distributed, especially when the sample size is small. Wait, but the sample size here is 20. I remember that for t-tests, if the data is not normal, the confidence interval might not be accurate, even if the sample size is small. Wait, but wait, isn't the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) saying that with large samples, the distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal? So a sample size of 20 is considered small, but the CLT would say that the t-test isn't appropriate even for small samples if the data isn't normal. So for the t-test to be valid, the data needs to be approximately normal. So in this case, since it's right-skewed, the data isn't normal even with a sample size of 20. So the t-interval isn't appropriate because the underlying distribution isn't normal.

Looking at the options:

Option C says a 95% t-interval isn't appropriate for right-skewed data. That sounds right because t-tests rely on normality. If the data isn't normal, even with a decent sample size, the t-test may not be appropriate.

Option A says the sample size is too large for fair representation. But that's about whether the sample size is appropriate for the population, not about the distribution. So that doesn't explain why t is not valid here.

Option B is about sample size being too small for fairness. No, that's about representativeness, not normality.

Option D talks about omitting the superintendent's salary. But the question states that the t-interval isn't appropriate because the distribution is right-skewed, so including the outlier (superintendent's salary being higher) would make the data more skewed. So D is saying it's not needed, but that's not the issue here. The issue is the distribution isn't normal, which affects the t-test.

Option E: population standard deviation known. T-test requires that the population standard deviation is known, but even then, it's okay to use t-test if the data is approximately normal. So E is a condition that's not met here because the population standard deviation is unknown, but the distribution is skew.

Option F: left skew. The question says it's right skew, so F is wrong.

Option G: skewed data tells assumption of normality isn't met. That doesn't sound right. The assumption of normality is about distribution shape, not just skew. So G is incorrect.

Option H: population standard deviation unknown. That's correct, because in a t-test, we usually have the sample standard deviation. So the issue is not with the standard deviation's knowledge.

Option I: the superintendent's salary is not an outlier. But the question says it's an outlier on the higher side, so I is incorrect.

Option J: teacher salaries are negotiable, so exclude the superintendent's salary. But the question states the superintendent's salary is an outlier, so including it would make the data more skewed, which isn't good for the t-test. So J is incorrect because it's not the right approach.

So the correct answer must be C.

The question addresses why a t-confidence interval is not appropriate for a right-skewed salary distribution. The key issue lies in the assumption of normality required for t-tests. 

- **Option C** correctly identifies that a t-confidence interval is not appropriate for right-skewed data because t-tests assume normality, and the distribution in this case is not normal. This is the correct answer.

ANSWER: C
