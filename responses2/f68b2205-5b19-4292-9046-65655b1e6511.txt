Alright, let's tackle this question step by step. The question is about the relative stability of American public policy and which factor contributes to it. The options are A through J, each representing different political and social forces.

First, I'll try to understand each option. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through each one.

Option A: Direct democracy. That's like a system where every citizen has a say, like in some countries. But I'm not sure how direct democracy affects policy stability. It might lead to more frequent changes, especially with new laws or policies.

Option B: Affirmative action programs. These are about making sure certain groups get equal treatment. I think affirmative action is about broadening opportunities, which can help reduce inequality and promote a more stable society. So this might contribute to stability.

Option C: Constitutional fragmentation. This would mean weak central authority, leading to weak governance. If power is split, it could lead to instability because policies might be more susceptible to change. So this might not be the reason for stability.

Option D: Social media influence. People use platforms to spread ideas and get opinions. But I'm not sure how much this directly affects policy stability. It might create a more polarized society, which could lead to political changes.

Option E: cooperation between major parties. The two major parties (Democrats and Republicans) often work together, which can create a stronger political base. This cooperation might prevent political swings, contributing to stable policies.

Option F: The role of the military. The military's presence might influence politics, but how stable does that make policy? Maybe it affects military spending but not necessarily the stability of policies themselves.

Option G: Use of executive orders. These are laws passed by the executive branch. They can prompt policies, but like other broad laws, they might lead to changes when new laws are introduced, so they might not directly contribute to stability.

Option H: Influence of international organizations. International bodies can influence global policies, but I'm not sure how that affects the stability of American policies. It might lead to external pressures, but not the internal stability within the U.S.

Option I: Dominance of one political party. If one party takes over, there might be less opposition, leading to more stability. But I'm not sure how much this directly affects internal policies versus external factors.

Option J: Judicial activism. This involves challenging judicial rulings, which can lead to public opinion changes. However, it might not directly stabilize policies but rather create more diverse opinions.

Putting it together, I think the options that contribute to stable policies are those that prevent political changes. Affirmative action (B) helps by giving equal treatment to different groups, which can reduce inequality and promote stability. The cooperation between major parties (E) means both sides work together, which can prevent major shifts. Direct democracy (A) might lead to frequent changes, so it's less likely. Constitutional fragmentation (C) would make governance unstable. The military (F) might influence, but not directly stabilize. Executive orders (G) might prompt changes, so they don't contribute to stability. Judicial activism (J) creates more issues, not necessarily stability. International organizations (H) can influence, but not directly stabilize U.S. policies.

So the most likely answer is either B or E. But the question is about the relative stability of the policies being achieved. The most direct factor is the cooperation between major parties (E), as they create a strong base and prevent major policy shifts.

The relative stability of American public policy is likely due to the cooperation between the two major political parties (E), which creates a strong base and prevents major policy shifts.

Answer: E
