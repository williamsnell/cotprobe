Okay, so I have this question here about two sets, X and Y. Let me read it again. X is {10, 30, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90} and Y is {10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90}. The question is asking which statement about these sets is false. The options are A, B, C, or D, where D means none of the above are false.

Hmm. I remember that medians, means, and ranges are different measures of central tendency and spread. So I need to calculate each of these for both sets to compare them.

Starting with the median. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. Both sets have 7 elements, so the median is the 4th element.

For set X: the numbers are in order, so the 4th element is 50. So median X is 50.

Set Y: same order, 7 elements. The 4th is 50. So median Y is 50. So both have the same median. So option A is true. So A is not the false statement.

Next, the mean. Mean is the average. Let's calculate both.

Set X: sum of elements is 10 +30=40, +45=85, +50=135, +55=190, +70=260, +90=350. So sum is 350. Mean is 350/7=50.

Set Y: 10+30=40, +35=75, +50=125, +65=190, +70=260, +90=350. Sum is also 350. So mean Y is 350/7=50. So both have the same mean. So option B is true. So B isn't the false statement.

Now, the range. Range is max minus min.

Set X: max is 90, min is 10. So 90-10=80.

Set Y: max 90, min 10. So 90-10=80. So range is same. So option C is true. So C isn't false.

So all three measures—median, mean, and range— are same for both sets. Wait, but the options are A, B, C, etc. So none of the options (A, B, C) are false. So the correct answer would be D: None of the above are false.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in any calculation.

Wait, for set Y, the numbers are 10,30,35,50,65,70,90. Let me sum again. 10+30=40, +35=75, +50=125, +65=190, +70=260, +90=350. Yes. So mean is 50, same as X.

Range is same 80.

Median X is 50, same as Y.

So all three are the same. So none of the options A, B, C are false. So the answer is D.

The correct answer is D: None of the above are false.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Median Calculation:**
   - Both sets have 7 elements, so the median is the 4th element.
   - For X: 50 (the 4th element).
   - For Y: 50 (the 4th element).
   - Both have the same median.

2. **Mean Calculation:**
   - Sum of X: 10 +30 +45 +50 +55 +70 +90 = 350 → Mean = 350 /7 = 50.
   - Sum of Y: Same as X, 350 → Mean = 50.
   - Both means are equal.

3. **Range Calculation:**
   - Range = Max - Min.
   - Both sets have max 90 and min 10 → Range = 80.
   - Both ranges are equal.

Since all three (median, mean, range) are identical, none of the options (A, B, C) are false. Thus, the correct answer is D.

**Answer:** D
