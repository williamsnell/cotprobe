Alright, so I've got this economics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the marginal cost of producing an item is given by the derivative y' = 3 + x + (e^(-x))/4. And the fixed cost is $4. I need to find out what it costs to produce one item.

Hmm, okay. I remember that marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit. So, to find the total cost, I need to find the antiderivative of the marginal cost function, right? Because integrating the marginal cost with respect to x will give me the total cost function, which includes both the variable and fixed costs.

So the marginal cost (MC) is given as y' = 3 + x + (e^-x)/4. To find the total cost (TC), I need to integrate each term separately.

Let me break it down:

The integral of 3 dx is 3x. 

The integral of x dx is (1/2)x².

The integral of (e^(-x))/4 dx is (1/4)*(-e^(-x)) since the integral of e^(-x) is -e^(-x). So that would be (-e^(-x))/4.

Putting it all together, the total cost function TC(x) is 3x + (1/2)x² - (e^(-x))/4 + C, where C is the constant of integration. 

But wait, the problem says the fixed cost is $4. Fixed costs are the costs that don't change with the level of production, like rent or salaries. So in the total cost function, the constant C must be the fixed cost. 

So C = $4.

So the total cost function becomes TC(x) = 3x + (1/2)x² - (e^(-x))/4 + 4.

But wait, the question is asking for the cost to produce one item. So I think that means the marginal cost at x=1. Because the marginal cost at a particular point x gives the cost to produce one more unit at that level of x. So if x is 1, that would be the cost of the first item.

So I should calculate y' when x=1.

The marginal cost is y' = 3 + x + (e^-x)/4.

Plugging x=1: y' = 3 + 1 + (e^-1)/4.

e^-1 is approximately 0.3679. So (0.3679)/4 is about 0.091975.

So 3 + 1 is 4, plus 0.091975 is 4.091975.

Wait, but that's the marginal cost at x=1. So that's approximately $4.092. But wait, the options don't have any around $4.09. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says the fixed cost is $4. Oh wait, but in the total cost function, the constant term is 4, so when we plug x=1, the total cost is 3(1) + 0.5*(1)^2 - (e^(-1))/4 + 4.

Wait, let's recalculate that.

3x = 3*1 = 3.

(1/2)x² = 0.5*(1)^2 = 0.5.

(e^-x)/4 at x=1 is (e^-1)/4 ≈ 0.3679/4 ≈ 0.091975.

So the total cost TC(1) is 3 + 0.5 - 0.091975 + 4.

Adding 3 + 0.5 = 3.5, minus 0.091975 is 3.408025, plus 4 is 7.408025.

Approximately $7.41, which is about $7.41. Looking at the options, option A is $7.45, B is $7.30, etc. So 7.408 is closest to 7.41, which is not exactly any option. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.

Wait, e^-1 is exactly 1/e ≈ 0.367879441. So (1/e)/4 = 0.367879441 /4 = 0.09196986. So adding 3 + 1 = 4, minus 0.09196986 gives 3.90803014, plus 4 is 7.90803014. Oh wait, I think I messed up the signs earlier. Wait, let me re-calculate.

Wait, the total cost function is:

TC = 3x + (1/2)x² - (e^-x)/4 + 4.

At x=1:

3*1 = 3.

(1/2)(1)^2 = 0.5.

(e^-1)/4 ≈ 0.367879441 /4 ≈ 0.09196986.

So putting it all together:

3 + 0.5 = 3.5.

3.5 - 0.09196986 = 3.40803014.

3.40803014 + 4 = 7.40803014.

Wait, but that's about 7.41, which isn't any of the options. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the integration.

Wait another thing: sometimes, when you integrate functions, you might have to consider constants properly. Let's double-check the integration steps.

The marginal cost is y' = 3 + x + (e^-x)/4.

Integrate term by term:

∫3 dx = 3x.

∫x dx = (1/2)x².

∫(e^-x)/4 dx = (1/4) * ∫e^-x dx = (1/4)*(-e^-x) + C.

So the total cost function is 3x + 0.5x² - (e^-x)/4 + C.

Fixed cost is $4, so C=4.

So TC(x) = 3x + 0.5x² - (e^-x)/4 +4.

At x=1:

3(1) =3.

0.5(1)^2=0.5.

(e^-1)/4≈0.09196986.

So 3 + 0.5=3.5.

3.5 - 0.09196986 ≈3.40803.

3.40803 +4 =7.40803.

Wait, but the options don't have 7.40. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A: $7.45

B: $7.30

C: $7.20

D: $7.55

E: $8.00

F: $7.85

G: $7.66

H: $8.25

I: $7.77

J: $7.99

Wait, the closest is 7.41, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the integration.

Wait wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the marginal cost at x=0, not x=1. Because the question says "the cost to produce one item," which is the marginal cost at x=0.

Wait, but the question says "the cost to produce one item" if the fixed cost is $4. So is it the marginal cost at x=0? Because the marginal cost at x=0 would be the cost of producing the first item.

But let me re-express the problem. The problem says the marginal cost is y' = 3 + x + e^{-x}/4. So when x=0, y' = 3 + 0 + (1)/4 = 3.25. Hmm, but that's not an option either.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the average cost, but that doesn't make sense because average cost would require fixed cost and variable cost. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the total cost when x=1, but the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I messed up the integration. Let me think again.

Wait, the marginal cost is the derivative of the total cost function. So the total cost function is the integral of the marginal cost plus the fixed cost.

So, let's integrate y' = 3 + x + e^{-x}/4.

Integral of 3 is 3x.

Integral of x is (1/2)x².

Integral of e^{-x}/4 is (-1/4) e^{-x}.

So the total cost function is TC(x) = 3x + (1/2)x² - (1/4)e^{-x} + C.

Fixed cost is $4, so C=4.

So TC(x) = 3x + 0.5x² - 0.25 e^{-x} +4.

At x=1, TC(1)=3(1) + 0.5(1)^2 -0.25 e^{-1} +4.

e^{-1} is about 0.3679, so 0.25 * 0.3679 ≈ 0.091975.

So 3+0.5=3.5.

3.5 -0.091975=3.408025.

3.408 +4=7.408025, which is approximately $7.41.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I should recheck the derivative.

Wait, the marginal cost is given as y' =3 +x + e^{-x}/4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in integration. Let me compute the integral again.

∫(3 + x + e^{-x}/4) dx.

= ∫3 dx + ∫x dx + ∫(e^{-x}/4) dx.

= 3x + (1/2)x^2 + (1/4)*∫e^{-x} dx.

∫e^{-x} dx is -e^{-x} + C.

So the integral is 3x + 0.5x^2 + (1/4)(-e^{-x}) + C.

Which is correct.

So, at x=1:

3(1) =3.

0.5*(1)^2 =0.5.

(1/4)(-e^{-1})= - (1/4)(0.3679)≈-0.091975.

So 3 + 0.5 =3.5.

3.5 -0.091975≈3.408025.

3.408025 +4=7.408025.

So approximately 7.41, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the fixed cost. Oh wait, the problem says the fixed cost is $4. Fixed cost is the cost that doesn't vary with the quantity produced. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculations. Let me compute e^{-1} more accurately.

e≈2.718281828.

e^{-1}=1/e≈0.36787944117.

So (1/4) * 0.36787944117=0.09196986029.

So 3x at x=1 is 3.

(1/2)x² is 0.5.

So 3 + 0.5 =3.5.

3.5 -0.09196986029=3.4080301397.

3.4080301397 +4=7.4080301397.

Which is approximately $7.41, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I've misunderstood the problem statement.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the average cost, not the marginal cost. Average cost is total cost divided by the number of items. But without knowing the number of items, that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the average variable cost, but that's not what's asked.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the integral was taken incorrectly. Wait, maybe the marginal cost is the derivative of the total cost. So integrating from 0 to x would give the total cost to produce x items, which includes fixed costs. Alternatively, wait, perhaps the fixed cost is the total cost when x=0.

Wait, when x=0, the marginal cost y' would be 3 +0 + (e^0)/4 = 3 + 1/4 = 3.25. So the marginal cost at x=0 is $3.25. So the total cost at x=0 would be TC(0)=0 +0 +0 + C = C=4.

So the total cost to produce x items is the integral from 0 to x of y' plus the fixed cost. Or perhaps not. Wait, no. The integral from 0 to x of y' gives the variable cost, and the fixed cost is added at the start. So the total cost is fixed cost plus the integral of marginal cost from 0 to x.

So total cost function is 4 + ∫(from 0 to x) [3 + t + e^{-t}/4] dt.

Wait, but if I integrate that from 0 to x, it's the same as integrating up to x, but perhaps that's a different approach.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the marginal cost but the average cost. Let's think differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the average cost when x=1. But the average cost would be total cost divided by x. But with fixed cost $4, which is a constant, total cost would be 4 + something.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me take a step back.

The question says: "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So, perhaps I should look for the last letter in the options, which is 'E' (E is the last character). But that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the marginal cost at x=1, which is $4.092. But that's not an option either.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the integral. Let me try again.

The integral of y' is:

∫(3 + x + e^{-x}/4) dx = 3x + (1/2)x² - (1/4)e^{-x} + C.

At x=0, the total cost is 4 (fixed cost). So:

At x=0:

3(0) + (1/2)(0)^2 - (1/4)e^{-0} + C = 0 +0 - (1/4)(1) +C = -1/4 + C =4.

So, C=4 + 1/4= 17/4=4.25.

Wait wait, that's a different approach. Because if I compute the total cost as the integral from 0 to x, then total cost would be:

[3x + (1/2)x² - (1/4)e^{-x}] - [3(0) + (1/2)(0)^2 - (1/4)e^{-0}].

Which is [3x + 0.5x² - 0.25 e^{-x}] - [0 - 0.25 *1] = 3x + 0.5x² -0.25 e^{-x} +0.25.

But fixed cost is $4, so the total cost would be the integral from 0 to x plus fixed cost.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe it's better to think that the fixed cost is the total cost when x=0. So TC(0) =4. So when x=0, the total cost is 4. 

So the integral from 0 to x of the marginal cost plus the fixed cost gives the total cost.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the marginal cost at x=1, which is y'=3+1 + e^{-1}/4=4 + 0.09196986≈4.09196986.

But that's the marginal cost at x=1, which is approximately $4.09. Looking at the options, the closest is option A: $7.45, but that's higher than what I have.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The marginal cost at x=1 is approximately $4.09, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the fixed cost is $4, and the marginal cost is the derivative of the total cost. So to get the total cost, you integrate y' plus fixed cost. But when x=1, the total cost would be:

TC(1) = ∫(from 0 to 1) y' dx + Fixed cost.

Which is [3x + 0.5x² -0.25 e^{-x}] evaluated from 0 to 1, plus 4.

Compute [3(1) + 0.5(1)^2 -0.25 e^{-1}] - [3(0) + 0.5(0)^2 -0.25 e^{0} ].

So 3 + 0.5 -0.25 e^{-1} - [0 +0 -0.25 *1].

So 3.5 - (0.25 * 0.3679) - (-0.25).

Wait, e^{-1}=0.3679, so 0.25 * e^{-1}=0.091975.

So 3.5 - 0.091975 = 3.408025.

Plus 0.25 (because it's subtracting a negative) → 3.408025 +0.25=3.658025.

Wait, but wait, that's the integral from 0 to 1 of y', which is the variable cost. Fixed cost is 4. So total cost is 3.658025 +4=7.658025, which is approximately $7.66.

Looking at the options, G is $7.66. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was approximately $7.41, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in integrating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total cost at x=1 by integrating y' from 0 to 1 and adding fixed cost.

Wait, let's re-calculate:

Integral of y' from 0 to 1 is:

∫(3 +x + e^{-x}/4) dx from 0 to1.

Which is [3x + 0.5x² - 0.25 e^{-x}] from 0 to1.

At x=1: 3 + 0.5 -0.25 e^{-1}=3.5 -0.25*(0.3679)=3.5 -0.091975=3.408025.

At x=0: 0 + 0 -0.25 e^{0}= -0.25.

So the integral from 0 to1 is 3.408025 - (-0.25)=3.658025.

Add fixed cost of $4: 3.658025 +4=7.658025, which is approximately $7.66.

So the correct answer is option G: $7.66.

Wait, but that's not what I thought earlier. So I must have made a mistake before when I thought the marginal cost at x=1 was $4.09, which was not an option.

So the correct answer is $7.66, which is option G.
</think>

The problem involves integrating the marginal cost function to find the total cost. The marginal cost is given as y' = 3 + x + (e^{-x})/4. Integrating this function and applying the fixed cost of $4 gives the total cost. After evaluating the integral and adding the fixed cost, the total cost is approximately $7.66.
