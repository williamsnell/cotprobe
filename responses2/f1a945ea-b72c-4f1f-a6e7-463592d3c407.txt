Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this question about the Upper Paleolithic. Hmm, the question is asking which of the given options indicates advances in human intellect during that time. Let me break this down.

First, I need to recall what the Upper Paleolithic was like. I think it was around 30,000 to 15,000 years ago. So, it was a time when humans had moved to new areas, spread their communities, and developed various technologies and social structures.

The question is specifically about intellectual advancement. Intellect involves thinking, reasoning, and solving problems. So, which of these options aligns with that?

Looking at the options:

A: Construction of permanent dwellings. That's more about building structures and probably related to survival, but not necessarily thinking.

B: Invention of the wheel. That's an engineering advancement, but not directly about thinking. It's more about mechanical efficiency.

C: Parietal and mobiliary art. Those terms sound technical, like the brain regions involved in thinking and motor skills. Parietal is associated with the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in executive functions like decision-making and language, so maybe this relates to intelligence.

D: Creation of writing systems. Writing is definitely a big deal in history. It allowed for communication, record-keeping, and more complex thought processes. The development of writing systems is a huge advancement in intellect because it's a form of cognition.

E: Development of pottery. Pottery is a material, not necessarily a cognitive advancement. It's more about cultural expression and material technology.

F: Domestication of plants and animals. That's a biological advancement, more about adapting to new environments than thinking.

G: New stone-tool technologies. Tools are essential for survival and daily life, but again, not directly about intelligence unless it's about tool design or the knowledge of how to use them, which is more about practical skills than abstract thinking.

H: Acquisition of non-local raw materials. This is about resource availability, which supports development but doesn't directly indicate intellectual progress.

I: Increased use of fire. Fire was a big leap in technology, allowing for warmth and cooking. It's more about practical innovation than intellectual thinking.

J: Changes in settlement patterns. This relates to population distribution and urbanization, which can be tied to social structures but not necessarily to intellectual advancements.

Putting this together, the options that involve cognitive processes or thinking are C and D. But wait, C is about art, which is more about creativity and perhaps cognitive abilities in perception, but D is about writing systems, which are directly about language and thought. Writing systems are a fundamental cognitive achievement because they require systematic thought and language comprehension.

So, the correct answer should be D: creation of writing systems.

The correct answer is **D: Creation of writing systems**, as it represents a fundamental cognitive advancement, enabling communication and thought processes through language and structured knowledge.

Answer: D
