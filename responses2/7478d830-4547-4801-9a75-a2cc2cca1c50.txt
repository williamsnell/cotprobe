Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem, so let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a mass falling a certain distance and converting its energy into yellow light photons. I need to find out how many photons are emitted.

So, the given data is: a mass of 1 gram falls through a height of 1 cm. The energy from this fall is converted into yellow light with a wavelength of 6e-5 cm. The options are from A to J, each a different number of photons.

Hmm, I remember that the energy an object gains when it falls is its gravitational potential energy. The formula for that is mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is height.

Wait, the mass is 1 gram. Oh wait, grams to kg? Yeah, because I usually work with kilograms. So 1 gram is 0.001 kg. That's important.

Gravity, g, is about 9.8 m/s², but wait, the height here is in cm. Oh, right, I should convert that to meters. So 1 cm is 0.01 meters.

So putting that into the equation: energy E = mgh = 0.001 kg * 9.8 m/s² * 0.01 m.

Let me calculate that. 0.001 * 0.01 is 0.00001, so 0.00001 * 9.8 is 0.000098 joules. That's 9.8e-5 joules. Wait, wait, wait—wait, 0.001 * 0.01 = 0.00001, which is 1e-5. Multiply by 9.8, so 9.8e-5 J? Right.

But wait, I think the units are in cm. Oh wait, no—because we converted 1 cm to 0.01 m. So the calculation is correct.

So the energy E is 0.001 kg * 9.8 m/s² * 0.01 m = 0.000098 J. Which is 9.8e-5 J.

Now, the next step is to find out how many photons this energy corresponds to when converted into yellow light. Each photon's energy is given by E_photon = hc/lambda, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and lambda is the wavelength.

Wait, right. So I need to calculate hc/lambda. Let's note down the values.

h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.
c is the speed of light, 3.0e8 m/s.
Lambda is 6e-5 cm. Wait, I need to convert that to meters. 6e-5 cm is 6e-7 meters because 1 cm is 0.01 m. So 6e-5 cm is 6e-7 m.

So hc/lambda = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (6e-7 m).

Let me compute that. Multiply 6.626e-34 by 3e8. 6.626 *3 is about 19.878, so 19.878e-26. Then divide by 6e-7.

Wait, 19.878e-26 divided by 6e-7. 19.878/6 is approximately 3.313. And exponents: 1e-26 / 1e-7 is 1e-19. So 3.313e-19 J per photon.

Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. Oh wait, 6.626e-34 times 3e8 is 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divided by 6e-7 m (which is 6e-7 m) gives 1.9878e-25 / 6e-7 = (1.9878/6)e-18 = approximately 0.3313e-18, which is 3.313e-19 J per photon.

Wait, that seems correct. So each photon has about 3.313e-19 joules of energy.

Now, the total energy from the fall is 9.8e-5 J. So the number of photons N is E_total / E_photon.

So N = 9.8e-5 J / 3.313e-19 J/photon.

Let me compute that. 9.8e-5 divided by 3.313e-19. So 9.8 / 3.313 is approximately 2.95. Then 1e-5 / 1e-19 is 1e14. So 2.95e14.

Wait, so N is approximately 2.95e14 photons.

Looking at the options, let's see:

H: 3e14 photons. So option H is 3e14, which is near what I calculated (~2.95e14, so H is the closest.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, E_photon is hc/lambda. Let me re-calculate that.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c =3e8 m/s
lambda = 6e-5 cm = 6e-7 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by lambda: 1.9878e-25 / 6e-7 m = 3.313e-19 J per photon.

So E_photon is about 3.313e-19 J.

Total energy is 9.8e-5 J. So N = 9.8e-5 / 3.313e-19 = (9.8 / 3.313 ) * 1e14.

9.8 /3.313 is approximately 2.95.

So N ≈ 2.95e14 photons.

Looking at the options, option H is 3e14. So the closest is option H.

To determine how many photons are emitted when a 1-gram mass falls through a height of 1 cm and its energy is converted to yellow light, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate the gravitational potential energy (E) of the falling mass:**
   - The mass is 1 gram, which is \( 0.001 \, \text{kg} \).
   - The height is \( 1 \, \text{cm} = 0.01 \, \text{m} \).
   - The acceleration due to gravity is \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
   - The formula for gravitational potential energy is \( E = mgh \).
   - Substituting the values:  
     \[
     E = 0.001 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 0.01 \, \text{m} = 9.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{J}.
     \]

2. **Calculate the energy per photon of yellow light:**
   - The wavelength of yellow light is \( \lambda = 6 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm} = 6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).
   - Planck's constant is \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \).
   - The speed of light is \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - The energy of one photon is given by \( E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \).
   - Substituting the values:  
     \[
     E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3 \times 10^8)}{6 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{6 \times 10^{-7}} = 3.313 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of photons emitted:**
   - The total energy available is \( E = 9.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{J} \).
   - The number of photons \( N \) is given by \( N = \frac{E}{E_{\text{photon}}} \).
   - Substituting the values:  
     \[
     N = \frac{9.8 \times 10^{-5}}{3.313 \times 10^{-19}} = \frac{9.8}{3.313} \times 10^{14} \approx 2.95 \times 10^{14}.
     \]

4. **Compare with the options:**
   - The calculated value of \( N \) is approximately \( 2.95 \times 10^{14} \), which is closest to option **H: \( 3 \times 10^{14} \, \text{photons} \)**.
