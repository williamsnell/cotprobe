Okay, so I have this matrix A here, which is a 3x3 matrix. The matrix is:

[1  2  3]
[4  5  6]
[7  8  9]

And the question is asking for the determinant of this matrix. Hmm, determinants can be a bit tricky, especially for a 3x3 matrix. I remember that determinants have something to do with scaling factors and areas/volumes, but I'm more focused on the method right now.

I think the best way to approach this is by using the rule of Sarrus or the cofactor expansion. Since the matrix isn't too big, maybe cofactor expansion is easier. Wait, but I also remember that sometimes matrices with patterns might have determinants that are zero. Like, if the rows are multiples of each other, the determinant might be zero. Let me check: Looking at the rows, the first row is [1,2,3]. The second is [4,5,6], which is 4 times the first row minus 2*(3) or something? Wait, 4*1 is 4, 2*2 is 4, so 4, but the third row is 7,8,9. Hmm, 7 isn't 4*1 + something. Wait, let me think: 4*1 + 3 = 7? No, 4*1 is 4, plus 3 is 7. Similarly, 2*2 is 4, plus 3 would be 7. Oh wait, so the third row is [4+3, 2+3, 3+3]? Because 4=1+3, 2=2+0, wait no, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe each row is a linear combination of the first row. Let me see: 4 is 1*4? But wait, 1*4 is 4, yes. 5 is 2*2.5? No, that's not a multiple. Alternatively, maybe the rows are linearly dependent. Let me see: if I take the second row minus 4 times the first row, what do I get? 4-4*1 = 0. 5-4*2=5-8=-3. 6-4*3=6-12=-6. So the second row minus 4 times the first is [0, -3, -6]. Similarly, the third row minus 7 times the first row: 7-7*1=0, 8-7*2=8-14=-6, 9-7*3=9-21=-12. So the third row minus 7 times the first is [0, -6, -12]. Now, looking at the new second and third rows: the second row is [0, -3, -6], and the third is [0, -6, -12]. That's exactly the same as multiplying the second row by 2: 0, -6, -12. So the rows are linearly dependent, which means the determinant is zero. Oh wait, so that's a quicker way to see it. So the determinant of matrix A is zero. So looking at the options, option A is 0. So the answer must be A.

The determinant of matrix A is 0 because the rows are linearly dependent (each row is a multiple of the others).
