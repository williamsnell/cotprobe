Okay, so I have this question about calculating the net present value (NPV) of a project. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that NPV takes into account the time value of money, which is why it's important to use a discount rate when evaluating investments.

The question says the discount rate is 10%, and the cash inflows are $3,000 each year for five years. There's also an initial investment of $11,000. Hmm, so first I need to calculate the present value of each of those cash inflows and then subtract the initial investment from that total.

Wait, right. The formula for NPV is the sum of the present value of all cash inflows minus the initial outlay. So NPV = PV of inflows - Initial Investment.

Each year, the cash inflow is $3,000, and it's at the end of each year for five years. So I'll need to calculate the present value for each year's $3,000 and sum them up.

I think the present value of an annuity formula would be useful here. The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity (where payments are at the end of periods) is:

PV = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

Where:
C = cash flow per period ($3,000)
r = discount rate (10% or 0.10)
n = number of periods (5 years)

Let me plug in the numbers. So C is 3000, r is 0.10, n is 5.

First, calculate the denominator, which is 0.10. Then the numerator is 1 - (1 + 0.10)^-5. Let me compute (1.10)^-5.

Wait, (1.10)^5 is approximately 1.61051. So (1.10)^-5 is 1/1.61051 ≈ 0.62092. So 1 - 0.62092 = 0.37908.

Now, 0.37908 divided by 0.10 is approximately 3.7908. Then multiply by 3000: 3000 * 3.7908 = 11,372.4.

Wait, that's the present value of the annuity. So the present value of the five cash flows is about $11,372.40.

Then subtract the initial investment of $11,000. So NPV = 11,372.40 - 11,000 = 372.40.

Looking at the options, option H is $370, which is close. But wait, maybe I should double-check the calculations for any rounding errors.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute each year's cash flow's present value individually and sum them.

Year 1: 3000 / (1.10)^1 = 3000 / 1.10 ≈2727.27
Year 2: 3000 / (1.10)^2 = 3000 / 1.21 ≈2479.34
Year 3: 3000 / (1.10)^3 ≈3000/1.331≈2253.94
Year 4: 3000 / (1.10)^4≈3000/1.4641≈2049.04
Year 5: 3000 / (1.10)^5≈3000/1.61051≈1862.79

Now add all those together:

2727.27 + 2479.34 = 5206.61
+2253.94 = 7460.55
+2049.04 = 9509.59
+1862.79 ≈11,372.38

So total PV is approximately $11,372.38. Subtract initial investment $11,000: 11,372.38 -11,000 = 372.38.

So approximately $372.40. Looking at the options, option H is $370, which is close. So the correct answer should be H: $370.

To calculate the net present value (NPV) of the project, we use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula:

\[
PV = C \times \left[ \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \right]
\]

Where:
- \( C = \$3,000 \) (annual cash inflow),
- \( r = 0.10 \) (10% discount rate),
- \( n = 5 \) (5 years).

First, calculate \( (1.10)^{-5} \):
\[
(1.10)^5 = 1.61051 \quad \text{so} \quad (1.10)^{-5} = \frac{1}{1.61051} \approx 0.62092
\]
\[
1 - 0.62092 = 0.37908
\]
\[
\frac{0.37908}{0.10} = 3.7908
\]
\[
PV = 3000 \times 3.7908 = 11,372.40
\]

Subtract the initial investment of \$11,000:
\[
NPV = 11,372.40 - 11,000 = 372.40
\]

The closest option is **H: \$370**.
