Okay, so I've got this logic problem here. The question is about translating a statement into predicate logic. The statement is: "All jellybeans are sweeter than all fruit." 

First, I need to understand each part of the statement. Let's break down the terms. 

Fx is "x is a fruit," Jx is "x is a jellybean," and Sxy is "x is sweeter than y." 

The statement is saying that every jellybean is sweeter than every fruit. So, for any jellybean, it's sweeter than any fruit. 

Let me think about how to structure this in predicate logic. The universal quantifier is used because we're talking about all jellybeans and all fruits. 

The structure should probably be: For all x, if x is a jellybean, then for all y, if y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. 

In predicate logic, this would be written as ∀x (Jx → ∀y (Fy → Sxy)). 

Looking at the options, let me check each one to see which matches this structure.

Option A: ∀x [Jx → ∀y (Jy → Sxy)]. Hmm, that's similar but instead of Fy for y, it uses Jy. Wait, the original statement says all fruits, not all jellybeans. So A says every jellybean is sweeter than every jellybean, which is not the same as being sweeter than any fruit. So A might not be correct.

Option B: ∀x [∀y (Fx • Jy) • Sxy]. Wait, that's using a conjunction. Let me parse it: for all x, for all y, if x is a fruit and y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y. That seems to be saying that every fruit is sweeter than every jellybean, which is the opposite of what we want. So B is incorrect.

Option C: ∀x [∀y (Sxy → Jx • Fy)]. No, that's saying if x is sweeter than y, then x is a jellybean and y is a fruit. That's not relevant here because our statement is about all jellybeans being sweeter than all fruits, which is a universal statement about x being a jellybean and the properties of x relative to fruits. So C doesn't seem right.

Option D: ∀x [Sxy → (Fy • Jx)]. Wait, that would mean if x is sweeter than y, then y is a fruit and x is a jellybean. That seems backwards. It's saying that for any x and y, if x is sweeter than y, then y is a fruit and x is a jellybean. That's not the same as saying all jellybeans are sweeter than all fruits. So D seems incorrect.

Option E: ∀x [Jx → ∀y (Fy → Sxy)]. This looks similar to what I thought before. E says for all x, if x is a jellybean, then for all y, if y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. So that's ∀x (Jx → ∀y (Fy → Sxy)). That's exactly the structure I came up with earlier. So E is a candidate.

Option F: ∀x [∀y (Jx • Fy) → Sxy]. This is saying for all x, if x is a jellybean and a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. But wait, Jx and Fy can't be true at the same time because a jellybean isn't a fruit. So this statement is saying that if an object is both a jellybean and a fruit (which can't happen), then it's sweeter than y. That doesn't make sense because such objects don't exist, so the implication is vacuously true. But our original statement is about all jellybeans being sweeter than all fruits. So F is incorrect.

Option G: ∀x [ (Fx • Jy) → Sxy ]. Wait, the variables are swapped here. The correct one should be Fy and Jx. So G is saying for all x, for all y, if x is a fruit and y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y. But actually, in the original problem, we have all jellybeans being sweeter than all fruits. So G is saying that all fruits are sweeter than all jellybeans, which is the inverse. So G is wrong.

Option H: ∀x [Fx → ∀y (Jy → Sxy)]. So for all x, if x is a fruit, then for all y, if y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y. That's saying all fruits are sweeter than all jellybeans. Which is the opposite of what we're supposed to say. So H is incorrect.

Option I: ∀x [Fx → ∀y (Sxy → Jy) ]. So for all x, if x is a fruit, then for all y, if x is sweeter than y, then y is a jellybean. That's saying every fruit is a jellybean, which is not the case here. So I is incorrect.

Option J: ∀x [Jx → ∀y (Sxy → Fy) ]. So for all x, if x is a jellybean, then for all y, if x is sweeter than y, then y is a fruit. That would mean all jellybeans are sweeter than all fruits, which is exactly what we want. So J is the correct option.

Wait, but wait. Let me check again. The original statement is "All jellybeans are sweeter than all fruit." So Jx is x is a jellybean, Fy is y is a fruit, Sxy is x is sweeter than y.

The structure in option J is ∀x (Jx → ∀y (Sxy → Fy)). So for any jellybean x, for any y, if x is sweeter than y, then y is a fruit. Which is exactly what the original statement is saying. Because if x is a jellybean, then all y's that x is sweeter than are fruits. So J is the correct translation.

The correct translation of the statement "All jellybeans are sweeter than all fruit" into predicate logic is:

∀x (Jx → ∀y (Sxy → Fy))
