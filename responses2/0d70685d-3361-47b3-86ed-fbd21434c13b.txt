Okay, so I've got this question about positronium. Hmm, I remember positronium is like hydrogen but with a positron and an electron instead of a proton. Right, because positrons are the antiparticles of electrons, so they have the same charge but opposite mass.

The question is about the energy of a photon emitted when positronium transitions from n=3 to n=1. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I think it's similar to the energy levels of hydrogen. Oh right, the energy levels in hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². Wait, but wait, wait—wait, right, because in hydrogen, the ground state is n=1, and it's -13.6 eV. So for positronium, which is like a hydrogen-like atom with a proton and electron, the energies are the same formula, but the mass being same, so the energy levels are same as hydrogen. So the energy for each state is E_n = -13.6 eV / n².

Wait, but wait, wait! No, wait. Positronium is the same as hydrogen in terms of energy levels, so the formula is the same. So when an electron transitions from n=3 to n=1, the energy emitted is the difference between E_3 and E_1.

So let me compute that. E_3 is -13.6 / 9 = approximately -1.511 eV. E_1 is -13.6 eV. So the difference is E_3 - E_1. Wait, but wait, no. Because when an electron goes from a higher energy level to a lower one, energy is emitted. So the photon's energy is the initial energy minus the final, so E_photon = E_initial - E_final.

Wait, the energy at n=3 is E_3 = -13.6 / 9 = -1.511 eV. Energy at n=1 is E_1 = -13.6 eV. So the energy emitted is E_initial (n=3) minus E_final (n=1): (-1.511) - (-13.6) = (-1.511) + 13.6 = 12.089 eV. So approximately 12.1 eV.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options. Option C is 12.2 eV, which matches this. Option B is 6.8 eV, which is about half of that. Option D is 13.6 eV, which is right for n=1. So the answer should be around 12.1 eV, so option C.

To determine the energy of the photon emitted when positronium transitions from \( n=3 \) to \( n=1 \), we use the energy level formula for hydrogen-like atoms: 

\[
E_n = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{n^2}.
\]

For \( n=3 \):
\[
E_3 = -\frac{13.6}{3^2} = -\frac{13.6}{9} \approx -1.511 \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( n=1 \):
\[
E_1 = -\frac{13.6}{1^2} = -13.6 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The energy of the emitted photon is the difference between the initial and final energy levels:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = E_3 - E_1 = (-1.511) - (-13.6) = 12.089 \, \text{eV}.
\]

This value is closest to \( 12.2 \, \text{eV} \), which corresponds to option C.
