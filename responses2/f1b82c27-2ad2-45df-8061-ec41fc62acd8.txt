Okay, so I've got this economics question here about budget surpluses and how they affect interest rates and the economy. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that a nation is experiencing an annual budget surplus and uses some of this surplus to pay down part of the national debt. The options are A to D, each suggesting a change in interest rates and the impact on the economy, like recession or currency depreciation, etc.

First, I need to recall how budget surpluses affect the economy. A budget surplus occurs when a government's revenue exceeds its expenses. When the government has extra money, it can use it to pay down debt, like paying off the principal of a bond or a government bond. That would reduce the national debt.

Now, paying down debt usually involves borrowing money. So when a country pays back debt, it's using its revenue to fund that debt. This might involve borrowing, which typically affects interest rates.

I remember that when a country's demand for loanable funds increases, the equilibrium interest rate increases. So if the government is borrowing more (to pay down debt), it might raise the interest rate because the demand for loanable funds goes up.

So looking at the options, if the interest rates go up, what happens to the economy? Well, higher interest rates can lead to a "crowding out" effect. Higher borrowing can reduce private investment because higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive. So private investments might decline, leading to a recession. That would mean the economy shrinks, so the economy could be in recession. 

Looking at the options, option A says "increase interest rates and throw the economy into a recession." That sounds right. Let me think about the others.

Option B says increase rates and depreciate the currency. I don't think so. Higher rates might lead to higher inflation, but is the currency supposed to depreciate? Or is it the opposite? Wait, when interest rates rise, in the foreign exchange market, investors like higher returns would want to hold foreign bonds, so the domestic currency would depreciate. But does that happen when the country is paying down debt? Maybe it's not the direct effect on the currency's value. But I'm not sure if that's the main point here. 

Option C: decrease rates and risk inflation. Maybe, but the question is about paying down debt, which might lead to higher rates, not lower ones. So this might not be correct.

Option D: decrease rates and recession. Hmmm, if the debt is paid down, perhaps the demand for loanable funds decreases, so the interest rate might not rise as much. So rates could stay the same or even go down. But does this cause the economy to be in a recession? I'm not as confident about this. Maybe some argue that lower rates could stimulate the economy, but I'm not sure. Also, higher demand for loanable funds would normally increase rates, not decrease.

So between A and D. If paying down debt leads to higher interest rates, maybe that leads to a recession because of crowding out. That would make A the correct answer. Also, if the economy is in a recession, the country's debt might be higher, leading to higher rates as more debt is settled.

So the answer should be A.

The correct answer is A: increase interest rates and throw the economy into a recession.

**Explanation:**

When a nation experiences an annual budget surplus and uses part of this surplus to pay down national debt, it reduces the country's debt burden. This reduction in debt typically increases the demand for loanable funds, which can lead to an increase in interest rates. Higher interest rates can cause a "crowding out" effect, reducing private investment and potentially leading to a recession. 

Other options are less likely:
- **B** suggests both higher interest rates and currency depreciation, but the direct effect on currency depreciation is secondary and not the primary outcome of paying down debt.
- **C** and **D** suggest changes in interest rates that are less likely, and the impact on the economy's recession is more directly tied to higher interest rates.
 

Thus, the primary effect is an increase in interest rates, which can lead to a recession. 

Answer: A
