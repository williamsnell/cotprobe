Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about rounding numbers to the nearest hundred. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question asks which two numbers both round to 1,500 when rounded to the nearest hundred. The options are A through H, and I need to pick the correct pair.

Okay, let's start by understanding rounding to the nearest hundred. When rounding a number, you look at the tens digit. If it's 5 or higher, you round up the hundreds digit by 1. If it's less than 5, you leave the hundreds digit as is.

So, any number that rounds to 1,500 must fall within a certain range. Let's think about that. The midpoint between 1,450 and 1,550 is 1,500. Wait, no, more accurately, the range is from 1,450 up to 1,549. Because, for example, 1,450 would round up to 1,500. But 1,550 would round to 1,600. So the rounding rule is: if the tens place is 5 or above, you round up. So the lower bound is 1,450 (since 1,450 is the point where it rounds up), and the upper bound is 1,549 (since anything above that, like 1,550, would round up to 1,600). 

So, both numbers in the correct pair must be between 1,450 and 1,549, inclusive. Wait, no, because 1,550 would round to 1,600. So the upper limit is 1,549.

Wait, let me double-check that. For example, 1,450: the tens digit is 5, so it rounds up to 1,500. 1,549: the tens digit is 4, which is less than 5, so it stays at 1,500. 1,550 would have a tens digit of 5, so it rounds up to 1,600. So yes, 1,549 is the upper limit.

So the numbers should be greater than or equal to 1,450 and less than or equal to 1,549. Now, looking at the options, I need to find two numbers that are within this range.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,444 and 1,555. 1,444 is below 1,450 (since 1,444 is less than 1,450). 1,555 is above 1,550, so it would round to 1,600. So neither is in the correct range. So A is out.

Option B: 1,453 and 1,563. Let's see, 1,453 is above 1,450 and below 1,550. So it's within the range. 1,563 is above 1,550, so it would round to 1,600. So B's second number is out. So B is not correct.

Option C: 1,449 and 1,549. 1,449 is below 1,450 (since it's just under). 1,549 is within the range. So the first number is below the lower bound, so it's not correct. So C is out.

Option D: 1,499 and 1,599. 1,499 is below 1,500 (wait, 1,499 is less than 1,500, but wait, the lower bound is 1,450. So 1,499 is above 1,450. So that's within the range. Wait, no, 1,499 is above 1,450. So it's within the range. 1,599 is way above, so it would round to 1,600. So only the first number is in the range. So D is out.

Option E: 1,489 and 1,589. Let's check. 1,489 is above 1,450, so within the range. 1,589 is also above 1,549, so it's above the upper limit. So 1,589 would round to 1,600. So only E's first number is in range, second is out. So E is out.

Option F: 1,457 and 1,547. 1,457 is above 1,450, so within. 1,547 is below 1,549. So both are within the range. So both are between 1,450 and 1,549. So both would round to 1,500. So F is a possible correct option.

Option G: 1,445 and 1,555. 1,445 is below 1,450, so not in range. 1,555 is above 1,550, so rounds to 1,600. So G is out.

Option H: 1,399 and 1,599. 1,399 is way below, so no. 1,599 rounds to 1,600. So H is out.

So the only option where both numbers are within the correct range is F: 1,457 and 1,547.

The correct answer is F: 1,457 and 1,547. Both numbers fall within the range of 1,450 to 1,549, ensuring they round to 1,500 when rounded to the nearest hundred.

Answer: F
