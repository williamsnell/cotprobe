Okay, so I've got this physics question about relativistic momentum. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that the total energy of a particle is twice its rest energy. And I need to find the magnitude of its relativistic momentum. The options are from A to J, each with different expressions involving mc and square roots.

Wait, I remember that in special relativity, the total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass and velocity. The formula, if I'm not mistaken, is E = gamma * mc^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Oh right, gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared), or something like that.

The rest energy is when the particle is not moving, so v is zero. So when v is zero, gamma is 1, and E equals mc^2. That matches the rest energy.

Wait, the problem says the total energy is twice the rest energy. So E = 2 mc^2.

So, E is gamma * mc^2, so 2 mc^2 = gamma * mc^2. If I divide both sides by mc^2, I get 2 = gamma. So gamma is 2.

Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh, right. So gamma equals 2, so 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Solving for v, but maybe I don't need v. Hmm. I remember that the relativistic momentum (p) is gamma * m * v. So I need to find p.

Wait, the momentum formula is p = gamma m v. But gamma is 2, so p = 2 m v.

But I don't know v yet. Alternatively, maybe I can express v in terms of gamma. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: in relativity, the energy E is related to momentum p by E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

Oh right! That's from the energy-momentum relation. So E squared equals p squared c squared plus (m c squared) squared.

So given that E is 2 mc^2, substituting in:

(2 mc²)^2 = p² c² + (mc²)^2.

Let me compute that.

(4 m² c⁴) = p² c² + m² c^4.

Subtract m² c^4 from both sides: 3 m² c^4 = p² c².

Divide both sides by c²: 3 m² c² = p².

Wait, wait, no: wait, (2 mc²)^2 is 4 m² c^4.

So 4 m² c^4 = p² c² + m² c^4.

Subtract m² c^4: 3 m² c^4 = p² c².

So p² = (3 m² c^4) / c² = 3 m² c².

Thus, p = sqrt(3 m² c²) = m c sqrt(3).

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, but the option with mc sqrt(3) is option D: (3^(1/2)) mc. Or wait, is that 3^(1/2) times m c.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D is mc/(sqrt(3)), which would be m c times (1/sqrt(3)).

Wait, wait, no, I'm getting p = sqrt(3) mc. So that would be sqrt(3) times m c.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me double-check.

Wait, the options are:

A: 2 mc

B: mc/(5^(1/2))

C: mc/(3^(1/2))

D: (3^(1/2)) mc

E: mc

F: mc/2

G: mc/(2^(1/2))

H: mc/4

I: 4mc

J: mc*(2^(1/2))

Wait, so the correct answer would be D: (3^(1/2)) mc, which is option D. Wait, but wait, wait, because when I calculated p, I got sqrt(3) mc, which is 3^(1/2) mc. So yes, that's D.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, another approach: p = gamma m v.

We have gamma = 2, so p = 2 m v.

But v can be found from gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Square both sides: 4 = 1/(1 - v²/c²).

Take reciprocal: 1 - v²/c² = 1/4.

So v²/c² = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.

v/c = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

So v = (sqrt(3)/2) c.

So p = 2 m v = 2 m (sqrt(3)/2 c) ) = m sqrt(3) c.

Which is (sqrt(3) ) mc. So option D is mc*sqrt(3), which is the same as D.

So the correct answer is D.

To determine the magnitude of the relativistic momentum of a particle with total energy equal to twice its rest energy, we start by using the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest energy (mc²). The total energy is given as:

\[
E = 2 \, mc^2
\]

The relativistic energy-momentum relation is:

\[
E^2 = p^2 c^2 + (mc^2)^2
\]

Substituting \( E = 2 \, mc^2 \) into the equation:

\[
(2 \, mc^2)^2 = p^2 c^2 + (mc^2)^2
\]

Simplify:

\[
4 \, m^2 c^4 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4
\]

Subtract \( m^2 c^4 \) from both sides:

\[
3 \, m^2 c^4 = p^2 c^2
\]

Divide through by \( c^2 \):

\[
3 \, m^2 c^2 = p^2
\]

Take the square root:

\[
p = \sqrt{3} \, mc
\]

Thus, the magnitude of the relativistic momentum is:

\[
p = \sqrt{3} \, mc
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**D: \( (3^{1/2}) \, mc \)**
