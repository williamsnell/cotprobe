Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: "They call up more every day.
"Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
"But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie."
Du Fu, "Ballad of the Army Carts," ca. 750 C.E.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a poem from Du Fu's "Ballad of the Army Carts." The question is about what the poem directly provides evidence for regarding taxation in the third stanza. Hmm, let me read through the poem carefully to understand the context.

The poem starts with the speaker walking alongside a column and asking what's going on. Then, a soldier responds. The soldier talks about a soldier from the Yellow River at age fifteen being sent north, and by forty, he's going west. They had bandannas tied to them, and when they returned, their hair was white but there was more unrest. The frontier garrisons have blood and are territorial, but the crops are everywhere. There are a lot of villages now, like ten thousand, and the soldier mentions theshan men with their reputations as fighters. They're sent home, and taxes are demanded but can't be collected from land. The speaker thinks having a son is bad because he'd have to lie on the prairie, but a son would end up lying on a distant prairie.

Wait, the question is about taxation. The third stanza is where the soldier says, "The Frontier Garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean, but the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest." So the topic is about the frontier and the government's approach to taxation there.

In the poem, the speaker is talking about the frontier garrisons: they have blood, which suggests a strong, corrupt system. But the soldier is complaining that taxes are demanded but can't be collected because they can't get blood from stones. This relates to the taxation system in the context of the frontier, perhaps indicating a system where taxes aren't collected effectively because the people are less able to pay.

Looking at the options:

A: The Tang Dynasty's large, standing professional army with no need of conscription. The poem mentions conscription but the army is large. Not directly about taxation.

B: The Tang Dynasty's fair and equitable taxation system. The poem talks about the government's stance against taxes, but it's more about the lack of collection due to blood and stones, which suggests corruption. So maybe not B.

C: Relatively advanced agricultural technologies. The poem doesn't mention any technological advancements here; it's more about the government's approach to taxation.

D: The Tang Dynasty's strong bureaucracy at the local level. The poem does discuss the military and the government's treatment of soldiers, but I'm not sure if it directly addresses the bureaucracy's role in taxation.

E: The Tang Dynasty's economic prosperity due to high taxation. The poem doesn't talk about prosperity; it's about the lack of effective collection despite taxes.

F: The Tang Dynasty's lack of regular income due to unpaid taxes. Wait, the soldier says taxes are demanded but cannot be collected because blood can't be obtained from stones. So it's about the lack of revenue, implying that taxes aren't fully collected, leading to the need for more taxes. So this might be F.

G: The Tang Dynasty's system of land distribution based on taxation. The poem doesn't discuss land distribution or how taxes are applied.

H: The Tang Dynasty's heavy reliance on conscription. The poem mentions conscription, but it's not directly about taxation.

I: The Tang Dynasty's system of forced labor in lieu of taxation. The poem doesn't mention forced labor.

J: The relatively high level of urbanization in Tang China. The poem is about frontier conditions, not urbanization.

So the question is about what the poem provides direct evidence for regarding taxation. The soldier is complaining that taxes are demanded but can't be collected because it's too "easily taken" (blood from stones). This suggests a lack of effective revenue, which implies that the government is not collecting enough. The poem doesn't explicitly state that it's a lack of regular income, but the context of the frontier and the government's approach (like not being able to collect taxes) might imply that the tang Dynasty's taxation system is not effective, leading to a lack of income. So the direct evidence would be F: The Tang Dynasty's lack of regular income due to unpaid taxes.

Wait, but the poem's focus is more on the existence of frontier garrisons with blood and the inability to collect taxes. So it's more about the system's failure, which could be seen as a lack of regular income. So F is the correct answer.
</think>

The poem discusses the challenges faced by the Tang Dynasty's frontier garrisons, where taxes are demanded but cannot be effectively collected due to a lack of regular income. This reflects a lack of effective tax collection, which the poem implies is a significant issue. 

The correct answer is:

**F: The Tang Dynasty's lack of regular income due to unpaid taxes.**

**Answer:** F
