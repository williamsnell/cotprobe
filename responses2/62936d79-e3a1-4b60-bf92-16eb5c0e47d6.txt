Okay, so I have this question about the number of diagonals in a regular octagon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on geometry, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that a regular octagon has eight sides, and all the sides and angles are equal. Diagonals are the lines connecting non-adjacent vertices. So, for each vertex, there should be some diagonals coming out of it.

Wait, I think there's a formula for the number of diagonals in a polygon. Oh right, it's n(n - 3)/2, where n is the number of sides. Let me make sure that's right. So for a triangle, n=3, 3(0)/2=0, which makes sense because a triangle has no diagonals. For a square, 4(1)/2=2, which is correct since a square has two diagonals.

So applying that to an octagon, n is 8. Plugging in, 8*(8-3)/2 = 8*5/2. 8*5 is 40, divided by 2 is 20. So the number of diagonals should be 20.

Looking at the options, option A is 20. So I think the correct answer is A.

The formula for the number of diagonals in a polygon is \( \frac{n(n - 3)}{2} \), where \( n \) is the number of sides. For an octagon (\( n = 8 \)):

\[
\frac{8(8 - 3)}{2} = \frac{8 \times 5}{2} = 20
\]

Thus, the number of diagonals is **20**.
