Okay, so I've got this logic problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident about truth tables. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about determining whether a set of propositions is consistent using an indirect truth table. Consistent means that there's at least one way to assign truth values to the variables without leading to a contradiction. So, the propositions are:

1. (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)
2. T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)
3. (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W

The options are about whether the set is consistent and what valuation makes them consistent. The options include things like all T, all U, etc.

Hmm. Let's break it down. Maybe I should try to simplify each proposition or see if any can be derived from others.

Starting with the first proposition: (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U). T implies U implies W implies U. That might be a bit tricky. Alternatively, I can think of it as (¬T ∨ U) → (¬W ∨ U). Wait, since implication is equivalent to its contrapositive. So, (¬T ∨ U) → (¬W ∨ U) is equivalent to ¬(¬T ∨ U) ∨ (¬W ∨ U), which simplifies to (T ∧ ¬U) ∨ (¬W ∨ U).

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I should tackle the second proposition first: T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X). Let's rewrite that using implication equivalence: T implies not (U implies X). U implies X is equivalent to (¬U ∨ X). So, the second proposition is T implies ~(¬U ∨ X), which is equivalent to T implies (U ∧ ¬X). So, T implies (U ∧ ¬X) can be written as (T ∧ U) → (T ∧ ¬X), which is the same as T implies (U ∧ ¬X). So, that means if T is true, then both U and not X must be true.

Alternatively, the implication T → (U ∧ ¬X) is equivalent to ¬T ∨ (U ∧ ¬X). Which can be rewritten as (¬T ∨ U) ∧ (¬T ∨ ¬X). Not sure yet.

Third proposition: (T ⊃ ~X) → W. So, (¬T ∨ ~X) → W. Which is equivalent to ¬(¬T ∨ ~X) ∨ W, which simplifies to (T ∧ X) ∨ W.

So, putting it all together, the three propositions are:

1. (T ∧ ¬U) ∨ (¬W ∨ U)
2. (¬T ∨ U) ∧ (¬T ∨ ¬X)
3. (T ∧ X) ∨ W

Wait, maybe I can approach this by trying to find a valuation (assignment of T, U, W, X as true or false) that satisfies all three.

Let me make a table for each variable. But since there are four variables, there are 16 possible combinations. That's a bit time-consuming, but perhaps manageable.

But maybe I can find some constraints quickly.

Looking at the second proposition: T → (U ∧ ¬X). So, if T is true, then U must be true and X must be false.

Let's consider if T is true. Then U must be true, and X must be false. So, in this case, from the second proposition, if T is true, then x is false.

Looking at the first proposition: (T ∧ ¬U) ∨ (¬W ∨ U). Since from the second proposition, if T is true, U is true, so the first proposition becomes true because ¬U is false, but (¬W ∨ U) is true because U is true. So the first proposition is satisfied.

Now, what about the third proposition: (T ∧ X) ∨ W. Since X is false (from the second proposition), (T ∧ X) is false. So for the third proposition to be true, W must be true.

So, if T is true, then X must be false, U must be true, and W must be true.

So, one possible valuation is T=true, U=true, X=false, W=true.

Let me check all three propositions with this assignment.

1. (T ⊃ U) is T→U which is true because U is true. Then (W ⊃ U) is T→U, which is also true. So, (T→U) → (W→U) is true.

2. T → ~(U → X). Let's compute U→X: U is true, X is false, so U→X is false. So, ~(U→X) is true. So, T→true is true.

3. (T→~X) → W. T→~X is T→true (since ~X is true because X is false). So T→true is true. So, (T→~X) is true, which makes the implication T→~X → W true only if W is true. And in our case, W is true, so yes.

So this assignment satisfies all three. So the set is consistent, and this is one possible assignment.

Wait, but the question says "if the set is consistent, choose an option with a consistent valuation." So I need to find which option (A to E) says that it's consistent and gives a specific valuation.

Looking at the options:

Option D says: Consistent. Consistent valuation when U, W, and X are true and T is false.

Wait, but in my assignment, T is true. So that's not matching option D. Option C says T, U, X are true and W is false. But in our case, W is true. So that's not correct.

Option A: Inconsistent. Valuation all false. Let me check all propositions with T=F, U=F, W=F, X=F.

1. (F→F) is T. (F→F) is T. So T→T is T. So (T→U) is T and (W→U) is T. So (T→U) → (W→U) is T→T → T, which is T.

2. F→~(U→X). U→X is F→F, which is T. So ~T is F. So F→F is T. Then T→F is F. So the second proposition is F→F, which is T. So the proposition is T → F → T. So that's T.

3. (F→~X) is F→T, which is T. So T→W is T→F, which is F. So the third proposition is F→W is F→F, which is T. So in this case, all three propositions are T, meaning that when all are F, the set is consistent. But wait, that's a problem because the options say that the set is inconsistent. But this would be a case where all are F, but the set is consistent. So am I making a mistake?

Wait no, wait. The propositions are:

1. (T→U) → (W→U)
2. T→~(U→X)
3. (T→~X) → W

So, when T=F, U=F, W=F, X=F:

Let me compute each proposition.

Proposition 1: (F→F) is T. W→U is F→F which is T. So T→T is T. So proposition 1 is T.

Proposition 2: T is F, so T→~(U→X) is F→~(F→F). U→X is F→F which is T. So ~T is F, so F→F is T. So T→F is F. So proposition 2 is F.

Wait, but in the problem, the propositions are if the set is inconsistent, but in this case, proposition 2 is F, so the assignment doesn't satisfy all three propositions. So when all are F, proposition 2 is F, so the set is inconsistent. So in this case, the set is inconsistent.

Wait, but this is a problem because when T=F, U=F, W=F, X=F, all three propositions are not satisfied.

Wait, that's a contradiction because I thought my previous assignment (T=F, U=F, W=F, X=F) didn't satisfy all propositions. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the propositions.

Let me go step by step.

Proposition 1: (T → U) → (W → U)

When T=F, T→U is T (since F→U is T only if U is T, but wait, no. T→U is equivalent to ~T ∨ U. So when T=F, it's T ∨ U, which is T (since T is true). So (T→U) is T. Similarly, (W→U) is T→U, which is T only if U is T. Wait, when U=F, W→U is F. So W→U is F. So the implication (T→U) → (W→U) is T→F, which is F. So proposition 1 is F.

Wait, so earlier I thought when T=F, U=F, W=F, X=F, all propositions are satisfied, but that's not the case. So I must have made a mistake earlier.

So perhaps the correct assignment is T=F, U=T, X=F, W=T. Let me try this.

Wait, but let's check for consistency.

Wait, maybe I should proceed step by step.

Let me try to find a consistent assignment.

Alternative approach: Let me look for a situation where all three propositions are true.

From the second proposition: T → (U ∧ ¬X). So either T is false, or U is true, or X is false.

Case 1: T is false.

If T is false, then all three propositions must be true.

Proposition 1: (¬T ∨ U) → (¬W ∨ U). Since T=F, ¬T is T, so the antecedent is T ∨ U, which is T. So the implication becomes T → (¬W ∨ U). So the implication is true as long as (¬W ∨ U) is true.

But since T is F, what about the other implications?

Proposition 2 is handled as above.

Proposition 3: (¬T ∨ ¬X) → W. Same as before, since T=F, ¬T is T, so the antecedent is T ∨ ¬X, which is T. So the implication is T → W, which is true as long as W is true.

So, if T=F, then for all three to be true, we need:

- (¬W ∨ U) must be true (from Prop. 1). Which is always true because either W=F or U is T. But if U is T, then Prop.1 is true.

- Prop.2 requires T→~(U→X). Since T=F, this is automatically true.

- Prop.3 requires W→T. Since T=F, for this to be true, W must be F.

So, to satisfy Prop.3, W=F.

So, in this case, if T=F, W=F, then Prop.1 requires (T→U) → (W→U). T=F, so T→U is T. W=F, so W→U is T. Thus, the implication is T→T which is T. So Prop.1 is satisfied.

So, with T=F, W=F, and U can be either T or F. Let's see if Prop.2 is satisfied.

Prop.2: T→~(U→X). Since T=F, this is automatically T.

But we also have Prop.3: (¬T ∨ ¬X) → W. Since T=F, this is T→¬X. So, for the implication to be true, if ¬X is T, then W must be T. If ¬X is F, then implication is T→F, which is F, so to make the implication true, we must have ¬X is T, which implies X is F.

So, in this case, X must be F.

So, with T=F, W=F, X=F, what about U?

From Prop.1: (T→U) → (W→U). T=F → U is T. W=F → U is T. So, implication is T → T, which is T. So Prop.1 is satisfied regardless of U.

So, in this case, what's the assignment? T=F, W=F, X=F. U can be anything, since it doesn't affect the propositions.

Wait, but the problem is to find a consistent valuation. So, for example, U can be T or F.

But the question is about whether the set is consistent, and which option is correct.

Wait, but let's also check if there's another case where T is true.

Case 2: T is true.

If T is true, then from Prop.2: T→~(U→X). So, since T is T, ~ (U→X) must be T. So, U→X must be F. Because ~ (A) is T only when A is F. So, U→X is F only when U is T and X is F.

So, in this case, U is T and X is F.

So, U=T, X=F, T is T.

Now, look at Prop.1: (T→U) → (W→U). T→U is T (since U=T). So, (T→U) is T. So, the implication is T → (W→U). Since (W→U) is (W→T), which is T when W is anything, since T is T.

So, T→T is T. So Prop.1 is satisfied.

Now, Prop.3: (T→~X) → W. T→~X is T→T (since X=F, ~X=T), so T→T is T. So, implication is T→W. So W must be T for the implication to be true.

So, in this case, W must be T.

So, our assignment in this case is T=T, U=T, X=F, W=T.

So, this is another consistent valuation.

So, in this case, the valuation is T, U, W, X all true except X=F and W=T.

Wait, but the options don't include this. Let me check the options.

Option D: Consistent. Consistent valuation when U, W, and X are true and T is false.

But in this case, T is true. So that's not matching.

Option C: T, U, X are true and W is false.

Wait, in this case, U is T, X is F, W is T. So, in this assignment, W is T. So, the valuation would have T, T, T, F. But the options don't mention that.

Wait, the options are about when the variables are all false or all true.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Consistent? valuation when T, U, X are true and W is false.

Wait, that would be T, U=T, X=T, W=F.

But in our second case, we have T=T, U=T, X=F, W=T.

So, that's not the same as option C's valuation.

Option D: U, W, X are true and T is false. So U=T, W=T, X=T, T=F. So, F, T, T, T.

But in that case, would all three propositions be satisfied?

Let me check:

Prop.1: (F→T) is T. W→U is T→T which is T. So, T→T is T. So prop.1 is T.

Prop.2: F→~(T→T). T→T is T. So ~T is F. So F→F is T. So prop.2 is T.

Prop.3: (F→~T) → W. ~T is T. So F→T is T. So T → W (which is T) is T. So all propositions are satisfied.

So the valuation F, T, T, T is also a consistent valuation.

But looking back at the options, none of them match this exactly. Let me look again.

Options:

A: Inconsistent. Valuation when all false.

B: Inconsistent. Valuation when all true.

C: Consistent. Val when T, U, X true and W false.

D: Consistent. Val when U, W, X true and T false.

E: Inconsistent.

Wait, in the case where T is F, U=T, X=F, W=T, that's not any of the options. But the question is to choose from the options given, regardless of whether it's the correct one. Wait, the question says "If the set is consistent, choose an option with a consistent valuation."

Wait, but if the set is consistent, then the options must include at least one correct one. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, let me go back to the two cases.

Case 1: T=F.

Then:

- From Prop.2: T→~(U→X) is T→~(U→X) which is T because T is F. So, ~ (U→X) must be T, which is always true, so U→X must be F.

So, U→X is F, which happens when U=T and X=F.

So, U=T, X=F.

From Prop.1: (T→U) → (W→U). T→U is T (since U=T). So, implication is T → (W→ U). Since U is T, W→U is T if W is T.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me reevaluate.

Prop.1: (T→U) → (W→U). When T=F, T→U is T. So, the implication becomes T → (W→U). For this to be T, it must be that (W→U) is T.

So, (W→U) is T when U=T and W=T.

Wait, but U is T. So W→U is T because W must be T (since U is T, W→U is T regardless of W).

So, Prop.1 is satisfied.

Prop.3: (T→~X) → W. T→~X is T→T (since X=F, so ~X=T), which is T. So, implication is T→W. So W must be T.

So, in this case, W must be T.

So, U can be T or F (as long as U→X is F, which requires U=T and X=F).

So, the assignment is T=F, U=T, X=F, W=T.

Now, let's check all three propositions with this assignment.

Prop.1: (F→T) is T, and (W→U) is T→T which is T. So T→T is T, so prop.1 is T.

Prop.2: F→~(T→X). T→X is T→F (since X=F), which is F. So ~F is T. So F→T is T. So prop.2 is T.

Prop.3: (F→~X) is F→T, which is T. So T→W is T→T which is T. So prop.3 is T.

So all three propositions are satisfied. Thus, the set is consistent, and this is a consistent valuation.

Looking back at the options, which one matches this assignment?

The options are:

A: Inconsistent. Valuation all F.

But in this case, the set is consistent. So A is incorrect.

B: Inconsistent. Valuation all T.

But in this case, the set is consistent, so B is incorrect.

C: Consistent. Val when T, U, X are T and W is F.

But in our case, T is F, W is T. So this is not matching.

D: Consistent. Val when U, W, X are T and T is F.

Wait, that's exactly what we have: U=T, W=T, X=F, T=F.

Wait, but in the options, D says: Consistent. Val when U, W, X are true and T is false. So, U=T, W=T, X=T, T=F. But in our case, X=F, W=T. So, the valuation in D is U=T, W=T, X=T, T=F. Wait, but in our case, X=F, not T. So the valuation in D is not a consistent valuation, but another one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

In the case where T=F, U=T, X=F, W=T.

This is a consistent valuation.

So, the options given include this case in some way.

Looking at the options:

A: Inconsistent. Valuation all F.

But in this case, the set is consistent, so A is incorrect.

B: Inconsistent. Valuation all T.

But again, in this case, the set is consistent, so B is incorrect.

C: Consistent. Val when T, U, X are T and W is F.

But in our case, T=F, not T=T. So this is not correct.

D: Consistent. Val when U, W, X are T and T is F.

Wait, that's exactly what we have. U=T, W=T, X=F, T=F. So that's a consistent valuation. So option D is correct.

But wait, looking back, the options in the problem don't include option D as correct. According to the problem, the options are:

A: Inconsistent. Valuation when all are F.

B: Inconsistent. Valuation when all are T.

C: Consistent. Val when T, U, X are T and W is F.

D: Consistent. Val when U, W, X are T and T is F.

E: Inconsistent.

Wait, but according to our analysis, the consistent valuation is when T=F, U=T, W=T, X=F. So that would be option D.

But the problem says the options are A to E, but none of them except option D matches that scenario.

But wait, looking back, the options provided in the problem are:

A: Inconsistent. Valuation when all are F.

B: Inconsistent. Valuation when all are T.

C: Consistent. Val when T, U, X are T and W is F.

D: Consistent. Val when U, W, X are T and T is F.

E: Inconsistent.

So, according to our analysis, the consistent valuation is option D's case.

Wait, but in our analysis, the consistent valuation is T=F, U=T, W=T, X=F. So that's matching option D's case.

Wait, but in the problem's options, D says "Consistent. Valuation when U, W, and X are true and T is false."

Which is exactly what we have.

Wait, but no, because in our case, U=T, W=T, X=F, and T=F.

So the valuation is U=T, W=T, X=F, T=F.

So option D is correct.

But the problem is, when looking at the options, option D's case is when U, W, and X are true, and T is false. Which is exactly what our consistent valuation is.

So the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, I thought that option C's case is when T, U, X are T and W is F. But our case is when T is F, so that's not option C.

So, the correct option is D.

Wait, but why is option C correct?

Wait, option C says: Consistent. Valuation when T, U, X are true and W is false.

Wait, but in our case, T is F, not T=T.

So, that would be incorrect.

So, the correct option is D.

Wait, but let me think again. When T is F, U is T, W is T, X is F.

So that's the valuation in option D. So it's correct.

So the answer is option D.

Wait, but the problem is that the given options don't have option D as a different case, but perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, looking back:

The problem's options are:

A: Inconsistent. Valuation all F.

B: Inconsistent. Valuation all T.

C: Consistent. Val when T, U, X are T and W is F.

D: Consistent. Val when U, W, X are T and T is F.

E: Inconsistent.

So, in our analysis, the set is consistent, and the correct valuation is when T is F, U is T, W is T, X is F. Which matches option D's case.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait. Earlier, I had another case where T is T, U is T, W is T, X is F. So that's another consistent valuation.

So the set is consistent in multiple ways.

So, the correct answer is option D.

But wait, the problem's options don't have both C and D as correct, but according to the analysis, C is correct when T is T, and D is correct when T is F.

So, the correct answer depends on the valuation.

But the problem says, "If the set is consistent, choose an option with a consistent valuation."

So, the correct answer is D, because that's the consistent valuation when T is F, U, W are T, X is F.

But wait, in the problem, the options are A to E, but D is the only option that matches the scenario when T is F.

So, the correct answer is D.

But wait, the initial analysis had two consistent valuations. So, perhaps the correct answer is either C or D, but according to the problem, the options are A to E, and the correct choice is D.

Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the valuation where T is F, and the other variables are T, T, F.

So, the correct option is D.

So, the answer is D.
</think>

The set of propositions is consistent, and one possible consistent valuation is when T is false, U is true, W is true, and X is false. This corresponds to option D. 

Answer: D
