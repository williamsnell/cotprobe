Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about contractionary monetary policy. Hmm, I remember that contractionary policies are used to reduce the money supply, which should lower the economy's growth.

The question is about the effects on the discount rate, nominal interest rate, and aggregate demand. Let me think about each part.

First, the discount rate. I think when the central bank uses contractionary measures, they might lower the discount rate. Like, the Fed might want to make borrowing cheaper so people and businesses are more encouraged to borrow money. So the discount rate probably decreases.

Next, the nominal interest rate. If the discount rate goes down, the Fed is making borrowing cheaper, so the nominal interest rate should also go down. It's the rate people pay on loans, so lower rates mean borrowing is cheaper.

Now, how does that affect aggregate demand? Aggregate demand is total spending in the economy. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, which increases planned investment and consumer spending. So yes, aggregate demand should increase when the discount rate and nominal interest rate go down.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up things. For contractionary policy, the goal is to reduce inflation. So lower interest rates would encourage saving more and investment, which would lower overall demand. So yes, the three points I thought about should all decrease.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Decreases, Decreases, Decreases. That fits what I thought. The discount rate goes down, interest rate goes down, and aggregate demand increases. Wait, no, option B says all decrease, but the question is about whether those three are either increases or decreases.

Wait, the options are about what "the discount rate", "nominal interest rate", and "aggregate demand" do (increase or decrease). So for the discount rate, it's going down, so decreases. The nominal interest rate is the rate on money, which is usually the rate on savings, so if the Fed lowers it, that rate goes down. So both discount rate and nominal interest rate decrease.

Aggregate demand increases because lower rates make borrowing cheaper, so more spending. So all three: discount rate is decreasing, nominal interest rate is decreasing, and aggregate demand increases. But the options don't have all three in the same option.

Looking at the options, let me check each one.

Option B: Decreases, Decreases, Decreases. Wait, no, the question is about whether the discount rate, the nominal interest rate, and aggregate demand are increasing or decreasing. Wait, the options are presented as three separate things. So each option (A to J) has three statements about whether each is increasing or decreasing.

Wait, the question is about the effects of contractionary policy on the discount rate, the nominal interest rate, and aggregate demand.

So the discount rate decreases (so it's a decrease). The nominal interest rate is the rate people pay, so if the discount rate is lower, the nominal interest rate is lower. So both discount rate and nominal interest rate decrease.

Aggregate demand increases because lower interest rates encourage more spending. So the three changes are: discount rate decreases, nominal interest rate decreases, and aggregate demand increases.

Looking at the options, which option has all three changes as decreases?

Looking at the options:

Option B: Decreases, Decreases, Decreases. Wait, no, because aggregate demand increases, so the last part is not a decrease. So the option would be where the discount rate and nominal interest rate decrease, and aggregate demand increases.

So let's look at the options again:

Option E: Decreases, Decreases, Increases. That would fit. The discount rate decreases, nominal interest rate decreases, aggregate demand increases.

So option E is the correct answer.

The correct answer is E. A contractionary monetary policy leads to the discount rate decreasing, the nominal interest rate also decreasing, and aggregate demand increasing.

**Answer: E**
