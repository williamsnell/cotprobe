Okay, so I've got this problem here about Tayshawn sorting marbles. Let me try to figure it out. The question says that he sorted 56 marbles into equal groups with none left over. And I need to pick which statement is true about the groups.

Hmm, so the total marbles are 56, and they're divided into groups with equal numbers. So the number of groups multiplied by the marbles per group should equal 56. That means I need to find two numbers that multiply to 56, right? One is the number of groups (like 8, 9, etc.), and the other is the number of marbles per group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 8 groups of 7 marbles each. So 8*7=56. That works since 8x7 is 56. So that's a valid option.

Option B: 9 groups of 6 marbles. 9*6 is 54. Oh wait, that's 54, which is less than 56. So that doesn't add up. So B is not correct.

Option C: 7 groups of 7. 7*7 is 49. Again, that's less than 56. So C is not right.

Option D: 10 groups of 5. 10*5 is 50. 50 is way less than 56. So D is out.

Option E: 11 groups of 5. 11*5 is 55. Still less than 56. So E isn't correct.

Option F: 6 groups of 8 marbles. 6*8 is 48. 48 is less than 56. So F isn't right.

Option G: 5 groups of 10 marbles. 5*10 is 50. Still 50, which is less than 56. So G isn't correct.

Option H: 3 groups of 18 marbles. 3*18 is 54. Again, 54 is less than 56. So H isn't correct.

Wait, so only option A adds up to 56. So the correct answer must be A.

The total marbles are 56. We need two numbers that multiply to 56. Option A (8 groups of 7 marbles) is correct because 8*7=56.

Answer: A
