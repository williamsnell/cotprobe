Okay, so I have this question about how much the money supply could expand when a bank receives a deposit and there's no required reserve ratio. Hmm. Let me think about what I remember from my economics class.

Wait, I think this has to do with the money multiplier. Right, the money multiplier is a concept that explains how a small change in the monetary base can lead to a larger change in the money supply. The formula, if I recall correctly, is 1 divided by the required reserve ratio. But wait, the question says there's no required reserve ratio. Oh, right, that would mean the required reserve ratio is zero. So plugging that into the formula, 1 divided by zero. Wait, but dividing by zero is undefined, which suggests the multiplier is infinite.

Oh, but what does that mean exactly? If the required reserve ratio is zero, that means the bank doesn't have to hold any reserves. So it can lend out the entire deposit. So when the bank receives a deposit of $1, it can lend that out, and that money gets multiplied through the banking system. Since there's no limit to how much the money can expand, the money supply can theoretically increase by as much as needed. So the answer must be E: Infinitely.

Wait, let me make sure. If the required reserve ratio is zero, the bank can lend $1, and that $1 gets multiplied by 100% each time it's lent out, right? So each dollar in the deposit leads to an infinite expansion. So yes, the money supply could expand infinitely.

The correct answer is E: Infinitely. 

When the required reserve ratio is zero, the money multiplier becomes infinite, meaning the bank can lend out the entire deposit, leading to an infinite expansion of the money supply.
