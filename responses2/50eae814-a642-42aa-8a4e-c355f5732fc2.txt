Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about pricing policies and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is asking which of the options occurs when competitors' pricing policies are almost exclusively focused on competitors rather than customers. The options are A to G, each representing a different pricing strategy.

Hmm, so the key here is that competitors are focusing their prices on each other more than on customers. That suggests a specific market strategy. Let's think about each option.

Option A: Price bundling. I remember that price bundling is when customers buy multiple products at once at a price lower than the sum of the individual prices. It's a way to increase volume, so it might be used by competitors to maximize sales. But I'm not sure how that ties into competitors focusing on each other rather than customers.

Option B: Price differentiation. That's when a company sets a different price for their product compared to others. Companies often do this to maintain a unique value proposition. But I don't think that's the main strategy here because the focus is on competitors, not on differentiating their own product.

Option C: Price skimming. Price skimming is a strategy where a company lowers its prices gradually to observe consumer behavior. It's more of a market research technique, not a pricing strategy in the sense of setting prices or differentiating products.

Option D: Price penetration. I recall that this is when a company introduces a new product or significantly lowers its price to gain market share quickly. The idea is that by lowering prices, the company can attract more customers. This seems relevant because it's about targeting customers by reducing prices, but does it involve competitors focusing on each other?

Option E: Price wars. Price wars are intense competition between competitors where they constantly lower prices to gain market share. This sounds exactly like the scenario described in the question. If competitors are focusing on each other rather than customers, they'd keep lowering prices to each other to gain market share.

Option F: Price escalation. This is when a company lowers prices to increase demand, usually to boost sales quickly. It's the opposite of price wars, so probably not the answer.

Option G: Price escalation. Wait, I think that's the same as F, so probably not.

Putting it together, price wars are when competitors simultaneously lower their prices. So when competitors are focused on each other rather than customers, it's a price wars scenario. That makes sense because price wars are a common competitive strategy where companies push prices down to attract customers, often to each other.

The correct answer is **E: Price wars**. In a price war, competitors simultaneously lower their prices to gain market share, which aligns with the scenario where competitors focus on each other rather than customers.

Answer: E
