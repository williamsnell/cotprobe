Question:

What experimental evidence indicates that genes control the aminoacid sequences in proteins?

Options:

A: The amino acid sequence in a protein is not related to genetics.
B: Direct observation of genes attaching amino acids to growing protein chains in live cells.
C: Genes have no control over aminoacid sequences in proteins.
D: Studies have shown that the removal of certain genes does not affect the amino acid sequence in proteins.
E: Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.
F: The presence of identical amino acid sequences in proteins from unrelated species.
G: Aminoacid sequences in proteins are determined by environmental factors.
H: The synthesis of amino acids in laboratory conditions without any genetic material involved.
I: Ribosome malfunction has been shown to produce identical amino acid sequences in different proteins.
J: The uniformity of amino acid sequences in proteins across all living organisms suggests genetic control.

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about gene control over amino acid sequences. Hmm, let's think through this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question is asking for experimental evidence that genes control the amino acid sequences in proteins. The options are A to J. I remember that genes are involved in protein synthesis, but I'm not exactly clear on the evidence.

I think the key here is about the relationship between genes and amino acids. I remember something called the genetic code, which is how proteins are made. Each amino acid is coded by a specific codon, which is part of the genetic code. But the question is about the control aspect.

Oh wait, I think about the experiments done in the 1970s. I remember someone named Ingram who found that mutating a gene didn't affect the protein. But that's about mutation effects, not direct control. So D says that removing certain genes doesn't affect the amino acid. Well, that's an effect, not an evidence for direct control.

Another point is the discovery of the genetic code. There was the work of Leuvenen and others... Like, they showed that the genetic code is fixed, which suggests the code is controlled by genes. Oh, that might be a point. So if the code is fixed, then gene control is confirmed.

Wait, but the options don't have a direct statement about the genetic code. Let's look at the options again. Option F says the presence of identical amino acid sequences in unrelated species. That's from the discovery that the amino acids are fixed in the genetic code. So that's evidence of gene control because the same sequence is present elsewhere.

Option G says the sequences are determined by environmental factors. No, that's the opposite. The amino acid sequences are fixed, so G is incorrect.

Option E is about mutation causing issues. That's more about the effect of mutations, not direct evidence.

Option I talks about ribosomes malfunction causing identical amino acids. That's another effect, not proof of direct control.

Looking back, I think the correct evidence is the genetic code being fixed. So option F would indicate that. But wait, let me check the options again.

Option F is: Presence of identical amino acid sequences in proteins from unrelated species. This supports that the amino acid sequence is determined by the genetic code, which is under the control of genes. So that would be the evidence.

Option A says the amino acid sequence is not related to genetics. That's the opposite of what we're looking for. If the amino acid sequence is related to genetics, it's the opposite of the question.

So the answer should be F. But wait, another thought: maybe the question refers to the work where the genetic code was fixed. Alternatively, the question about whether genes control the amino acid sequences is about whether the amino acid sequence is determined by the gene. So F shows that the same sequence is present elsewhere, which suggests that the amino acid is determined by the genes, hence confirming control.

The question asks for experimental evidence that genes control the amino acid sequences in proteins. To determine the correct answer, we analyze the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The amino acid sequences are indeed related to genetics, as genes influence amino acid sequences.
- **B**: Incorrect. The question focuses on evidence of gene control, not direct observation of gene attachment.
- **C**: Incorrect. Genes do control amino acid sequences, as evidenced by fixed coding rules.
- **D**: Incorrect. This describes an effect of mutation, not direct evidence of gene control.
- **E**: Incorrect. Mutation effects do not directly show gene control.
- **F**: Correct. The presence of identical amino acid sequences in unrelated proteins supports that the amino acid sequence is determined by the genetic code, which is under the control of genes.
- **G**: Incorrect. The amino acid sequences are not determined by environmental factors.
- **H**: Incorrect. The synthesis of amino acids in laboratory conditions indicates a fixed coding system, not the presence of genetic material.
- **I**: Incorrect. This describes a consequence of genetic control, not direct evidence.
- **J**: Correct. The uniformity of amino acid sequences across all organisms suggests genetic control.

The most accurate evidence is **F**, as it demonstrates that the same amino acid sequences are present in unrelated species, indicating a fixed genetic code controlled by genes.
