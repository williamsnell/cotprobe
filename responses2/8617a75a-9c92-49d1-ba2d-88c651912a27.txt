Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating someone's total wealth based on their income and the interest rate. Let me try to break this down step by step. I remember that total wealth in this context probably refers to the present value of their future income, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

The question says the expected annual income is $20,000 and the rate of interest is 9.8%. The options are various amounts, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I think I've heard about present value before. Present value is the current worth of a future sum of money, considering the time value of money. So, if someone's income is $20,000 per year, and the interest rate is 9.8%, I guess the question is asking for the present value of that income. But how?

Oh wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh, wait, no, the question is about total wealth, so perhaps it's the future value. Or maybe present value is being used here. Hmm. Let's clarify.

Wait, no, the question says "total wealth" and it's given as an expected annual income. So, perhaps the total wealth is the present value of that income at the interest rate. So, if I have an income of $20k per year, what's the present value of that income? But I'm not sure how that's calculated. 

Wait, maybe the question is about calculating the present value of a perpetuity. Because if someone's income is expected to continue forever, then the present value would be calculated as income divided by the interest rate. So, present value (PV) = income / rate. Let me calculate that.

So, income is $20,000, rate is 9.8% which is 0.098 in decimal. So, PV = 20,000 / 0.098. Let me compute that.

20,000 divided by 0.098. Let's see: 20,000 รท 0.1 is 200,000, but since 0.098 is slightly less than 0.1, the result will be a bit higher. Let me do the division more accurately.

0.098 * 204,082 is approximately 20,000. Let me check: 0.098 * 204,082.

Wait, 204,082 * 0.1 is 20,408.2. But 0.098 is 0.1 minus 0.002. So, 0.098 * 204,082 = 20,408.2 - (0.002 * 204,082) = 20,408.2 - 408.164 = approximately 20,000.036. That's very close to $20,000. So, the present value is approximately $204,082.

Looking at the options, option G is $204,082. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: could the question be about future value instead? The future value (FV) of an income stream would be income multiplied by (1 + rate)^number of periods. But here, the question doesn't specify the time, so I think that's not the case. It must be about present value, which is a common finance concept.

So, the answer should be G.

The question involves calculating the present value of an annual income stream. Using the present value formula, PV = income / rate, we find that the present value is approximately $204,082. This corresponds to option G.

**Answer: G: $204,082**
