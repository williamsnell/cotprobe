Question:

A man claims to have inherited property from a wealthy businessman. The man's birth certificate shows that he was born out of wedlock. The record of a proceeding for a support order shows that the businessman was adjudged to be father of the man. However, the man can establish his status as heir of the businessman only if he was legitimated by the marriage of his mother and the businessman subsequent to his birth. Thus, the man must prove that this marriage occurred. The man's attorney has not been able to discover any marriage license or certificate. However, the attorney does have a photograph that shows a couple dressed in wedding clothes. The scene is the front of a church. Bystanders are seen to be throwing rice at the couple and they seem to be responding by smiling and bowing down. The attorney was given the photograph by the man. He found it in his mother's effects following her death. The man believes that the bride in the picture is his mother. He cannot identify the groom. The attorney was informed by a former acquaintance of the businessman who has seen the snapshot that he thinks the groom is the businessman. If the attorney seeks to introduce the photograph as proof that the mother and the businessman were married, the trial judge should rule the photograph

Options:

A: inadmissible as not the best evidence.
B: admissible, only if a witness verifies that it is a correct and accurate representation of the relevant facts.
C: inadmissible as non-verbal hearsay not within any recognized exception.
D: admissible, only if a former acquaintance of the businessman can identify the groom in the photograph.
E: inadmissible, as it does not provide conclusive evidence of a marriage.
F: admissible, only if the man can provide additional evidence supporting his claim that the woman in the picture is his mother.
G: admissible, only if the photographer is available to testify concerning the circumstances under which the photograph was taken.
H: admissible, only if the church where the photograph was taken confirms it was the venue for the mother and the businessman's wedding.
I: inadmissible, as the photograph could be misinterpreted or manipulated.
J: admissible, only if the man can positively identify the groom as the businessman.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. Let's go through it step by step.

The scenario is about a trial where a man claims to inherit property from a wealthy businessman. The man's birth certificate shows he was born out of wedlock, which means he was born at a young age without the usual legal wedlock arrangement. This is important because wedlock could have implications for his inheritance status, but I'm not sure yet how it affects the trial's admissibility.

The proceeding for a support order mentioned that the businessman adjudicated him as his father. So, the support order was against him, but the man is trying to establish his heir status. To do that, he needs to prove that he was illegitimate, which he can do by showing his mother's and the businessman's subsequent marriage. So, he must prove that his mother and the businessman were married.

The man's attorney couldn't find a marriage license or certificate, but he has a photograph of a couple dressed in wedding clothes. The scene is the front of a church, and baters are throwing rice at them. They are smiling and bowing down. The attorney obtained the photo from the man's mother's effects following her death. The man believes the bride is his mother, but he can't identify the groom. However, the attorney informed a former acquaintance who saw the photo and thought the groom was the businessman.

Now, the question is about whether the photograph can be admitted as evidence. The options are A to J, each relating to admissibility rules.

I remember that evidence of marriage needs to meet certain standards. First, the photograph must be of a valid marriage. The question is whether the evidence is admissible as a photograph of a marriage.

Looking at the options:

A: Inadmissible as not the best evidence. Probably not, because best evidence requires clear and complete facts. The photograph is not completeâ€”it shows a couple, but not who they are.

B: Admissible only if a witness verifies its accuracy. That's about the credibility of the photograph, not the legal admissibility.

C: Inadmissible because it's non-verbal hearsay and within any recognized exception. I think that's not right. Non-verbal evidence can be admissible under certain exceptions, like when it's a picture or a video, but only if it was taken under circumstances that meet the exception's conditions.

D: Admissible only if a former acquaintance can identify the groom. That's about the witness. The attorney can't identify the groom, so unless he can, the photograph might not be admissible as evidence of the marriage. But wait, the attorney has that information, so maybe the witness would say that's acceptable.

E: Inadmissible as it doesn't provide conclusive evidence. Hmm. The photograph is a picture of a wedding, which should be conclusive, so this might not be the case.

F: Admissible only if the man can provide additional evidence. But the question is about the judge's ruling, not the man's ability to provide evidence. So F might not be correct.

G: Admissible only if the photographer is available to testify. The judge needs to decide based on the evidence, not the witness's ability.

H: Admissible only if the church confirms the wedding. The photograph is taken in a church. The church could be part of the proof, but I'm not sure if church involvement qualifies. In some cases, church involvement is considered part of the event, making the photograph admissible. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

J: Admissible only if the man can positively identify the groom as the businessman. The man cannot identify the groom, but the attorney knows he thinks he is the groom. So, without a witness, the judge might rule against the photograph because the evidence is not verifiable by a witness.

Alternatively, the judge could look at the circumstances under which the photograph was taken. If the church is a place where such a wedding would usually be, or if the circumstances (like the venue) support the photograph, it might be admissible.

Wait, another point: the photograph is of a couple in a church. If the church is a place where such a wedding would typically take place, the photograph could be considered as part of the event, making it admissible as a picture of a marriage. But I'm not entirely certain about the rules regarding church venues.

Alternatively, the photograph must be of a valid marriage, which it is. It shows a couple, but without names. However, the legal issue is whether the photograph is admissible. The best evidence rule requires clear and complete facts. The photograph is not complete because it doesn't specify the couple or their identities. So unless the court finds that the photograph is clear and complete, it might not be admissible.

Wait, but the photograph shows the couple dressed in wedding clothes. It's a picture, so it's a visual representation. So perhaps it meets the best evidence standard. But I'm not entirely sure if the format of the photograph (like being a picture) is sufficient. I think that if the photograph is of a marriage, it's admissible as best evidence. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the photograph might not meet the admissibility requirements because it's not a complete picture. It's a picture, but it's just a single image. The best evidence rule requires complete and clear facts. The photograph isn't complete because it's just a partial picture of a couple, not including the names of the parents or children. So perhaps it's not admissible.

Wait, but best evidence requires clear and complete facts, which the photograph doesn't provide. It's just a picture of the couple. So the photograph is not complete. So it can't be best evidence. So the judge would likely not admit it as best evidence.

Looking back at the options, option E says it's inadmissible as it doesn't provide conclusive evidence. But the photograph is a picture, which is conclusive. So E might not be correct.

Option F says it's admissible only if the man can provide additional evidence. But the judge's rule would focus on the photograph's admissibility, not on the man's ability to provide more evidence. So F is about the man's ability, not the judge's ruling.

Option G suggests it's admissible only if the photographer is available. That seems out of context. The judge would assess the photograph's admissibility based on legal principles, not on the witness's availability.

Option H says it's admissible only if the church confirms it. If the church is a place where such a marriage would normally take place, the photograph could be admissible. But I'm not sure if the judge would require the church to testify. I think the judge can rely on the fact that the photograph is of a wedding and that the venue is a place where such a wedding would typically occur.

Option J says it's admissible only if the man can positively identify the groom as the businessman. The man can't identify the groom, but the attorney knows he thinks he is. So without a witness, the photograph might not be admissible because the witness would be required to identify the groom to prove theMarriage occurred. Since the attorney has that information, perhaps the judge can rule on it as admissible. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the issue is whether the photograph is admissible as evidence. If the photograph is of a marriage, it's admissible as an image of a marriage, provided it's a picture or a video. The best evidence rule requires clear and complete facts. The photograph only shows a couple, not who they are. So it's not complete. Therefore, it's not best evidence. So the photograph can't be admitted as best evidence.

But is there a way to make it best evidence? If the photograph is of a marriage, it's admissible as evidence. But without the names, it's not complete. The issue is whether the photograph is admissible as a picture of a marriage, which it is, but without the names, it's incomplete. So unless it's a complete picture, it's not admissible.

Wait, but the photograph is a picture, so it's a visual piece of evidence. But the best evidence rule requires clear and complete facts. The photograph isn't complete; it's just a picture of a couple. So it's not admissible for best evidence. But is it admissible otherwise?

Alternatively, if the court finds that the photograph is a picture of a marriage, then it's admissible. So perhaps the photograph is admissible as a picture of a marriage, but it's not complete. But under the best evidence rule, it's not complete, so it's not admissible.

Wait, but the best evidence rule applies to evidence of a fact, not a complete picture. So the photograph is not complete, so it's not admissible as best evidence. Therefore, the photograph is not admissible as best evidence, but it's a picture of a marriage, which could be considered admissible under certain exceptions.

Wait, but the photograph is not a complete picture. It's just a single picture of a couple. So the best evidence rule doesn't apply. The photograph is not complete, so it's not best evidence. Thus, the photograph is not admissible as best evidence. However, if it's a picture of a marriage, it's admissible as a picture of marriage, but without the names, it's incomplete.

Wait, but the issue is whether the photograph is admissible. So, if the photograph is a picture of a marriage, it's admissible as a picture of marriage, but the best evidence rule requires complete and clear facts. The photograph doesn't meet that.

So which option is correct?

Option G says it's admissible only if the photographer is available. That's not correct. The judge would assess based on legal principles, not on the witness's availability.

Option H: Admissible only if the church confirms the wedding. The photograph is taken in a church. If the church is a standard venue for such a wedding, the photograph could be admissible. But I'm not sure if the church's involvement qualifies. In some cases, church involvement is considered part of the event, making the photograph admissible. So the photograph is admissible under that scenario. But the judge's rule would focus on the photograph's admissibility, not on the church's involvement.

Option J: Admissible only if the man can identify the groom. The man can't, but the attorney knows the groom is the businessman. So unless a witness identifies, the photograph might not be admissible. But the judge's rule would focus on the photograph's admissibility, not on the man's ability to provide other evidence.

So the best option seems to be E: admissible only if it's a complete picture. But wait, the photograph isn't complete. So E would not be correct.

Wait, another angle: the photograph is a picture of the couple. The best evidence rule requires clear facts. The photograph is just a picture, so it's not complete. Therefore, the photograph is not admissible as best evidence. However, it's a picture of a marriage, which is admissible as a picture of a marriage. But the issue is whether the photograph is admissible in the first place. Since it's not a complete picture, the photograph is not admissible as best evidence. But it's a picture of a marriage, so perhaps it's admissible as a picture, but only if the court finds that the photograph is complete.

Wait, but the photograph isn't complete. So perhaps it's not admissible. But the photograph is a picture of a marriage, so it could be admissible as a picture of a marriage. But the court would assess whether the photograph is admissible in that context.

Alternatively, the photograph could be considered as evidence of the marriage, but without the names. So without the parents' names, it's not complete. So the photograph is not admissible as best evidence, but it's a picture of a marriage, making it admissible under other exceptions.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the options again.

The correct answer is likely option E or option F. Option E says it's inadmissible as it doesn't provide conclusive evidence. But the photograph is a picture of a wedding. It provides complete evidence, so E would be incorrect.

Option F says it's admissible only if the man can provide additional evidence. The judge would look at the photograph's admissibility, not the man's ability to provide more evidence. So F is about the man's ability, not the judge's ruling.

Option G is about the photographer being available, which I don't think is relevant here.

Option H is about the church confirming the wedding. But I'm not sure how the church's involvement affects the photograph's admissibility.

Option J is about the man identifying the groom. He can't, but the attorney knows he is. So without a witness, perhaps the photograph can't be proven as a valid marriage.

Wait, but the best evidence rule requires clear and complete facts. The photograph is just a picture of a couple. So it's not complete. Therefore, it's not admissible as best evidence. So the photograph can't be admitted as best evidence. So the photograph is not admissible as best evidence, but it's a picture of a marriage. So perhaps the photograph can be admitted as a picture of a marriage, but the court would require it to be complete.

Wait, but the photograph is not complete. It's just a picture of a couple. So even if it's a picture of a marriage, it's not complete. Therefore, it's not admissible as best evidence. So the photograph isn't admissible as best evidence, but it's a picture of a marriage, which under some exceptions is admissible. But the question is about whether the photograph is admissible, regardless of exceptions.

So the photograph is not admissible as best evidence. Therefore, the judge would not admit it as such. However, it's a picture of a marriage, so perhaps it's admissible under certain exceptions.

Wait, but under the best evidence rule, the photograph is not admissible, so any other rule would apply. But the photograph is a picture, which is admissible as a picture of a marriage. But in that case, the photograph is not complete. So unless the court finds that the photograph is complete, it's not admissible.

But the photograph is just a picture of a couple. It's not clear who they are. So the judge would need to assess whether the photograph provides complete and clear facts. Since it's not complete, the photograph isn't admissible as best evidence.

So the correct answer is E: inadmissible as it doesn't provide conclusive evidence of a marriage, because the photograph isn't complete.

Wait, but the photograph is a picture of a marriage, not a complete picture. So it's not complete, so it's not admissible as best evidence. So the judge would not admit it as best evidence, but it's a picture of a marriage, so perhaps it's admissible under other rules.

Wait, but the question is about whether the photograph is admissible. So the judge needs to accept it as evidence. But since it's not complete, it's not admissible as best evidence. So the photograph can't be admitted.

Looking at the options, the correct one would be E: inadmissible as it doesn't provide conclusive evidence of a marriage.

Wait, but the photograph is a picture of a marriage, so it's admissible as a picture of a marriage. Therefore, it's admissible. So the correct answer would be another option.

Alternatively, perhaps the photograph is not admissible as a picture of a marriage because it's a picture of a couple, not a complete picture. So it's not admissible as best evidence but is a picture of a marriage, which is admissible as a picture. So perhaps the photograph is admissible as a picture of a marriage, making option H correct.

But the photograph is in a church, which might be a standard venue, making it admissible. So the photograph is admissible as a picture of a marriage in a church. So the correct answer would be H: admissible only if the church confirms the wedding.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the photograph is of a couple, but it's just a picture. The best evidence rule requires clear and complete facts. So the photograph isn't complete, so it's not admissible as best evidence. Therefore, the photograph can't be admitted as best evidence. But it's a picture of a marriage, so if the court can find it's a picture of a marriage, it's admissible. So the photograph is admissible as a picture of a marriage, making option H correct.

Wait, but H says it's admissible only if the church confirms it. So if the church confirms, then it's admissible. But the photograph is taken in a church. So the church's involvement would make the photograph admissible. But the judge's rule would focus on the photograph's admissibility, not on the church. So perhaps the photograph is admissible as a picture of a marriage, regardless of the church's involvement.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look for another approach.

The key points are:

- The photograph is of a couple, but not complete.
- The issue is whether the photograph is admissible as evidence of a marriage.

Under the best evidence rule, the photograph lacks complete and clear facts, so it's not admissible. Therefore, the photograph is inadmissible as best evidence. So the judge can't admit it as such. But if the photograph is a picture of a marriage, it's admissible under some exceptions. But the photograph isn't complete, so unless the court finds it's complete, it can't be admitted as best evidence. So perhaps the photograph isn't admissible as best evidence, but it might be admissible as a picture of a marriage if the court finds it's complete.

But the photograph is not complete. So the best answer is that the photograph isn't admissible as best evidence. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option E: inadmissible as it doesn't provide conclusive evidence of a marriage.

The photograph is a picture of a couple, but not complete. So it's not conclusive evidence, so E is correct. But I thought the photograph was complete, but no, it's not.

So the correct answer is E: inadmissible as it doesn't provide conclusive evidence of a marriage.
</think>

The photograph in question is of a couple but is not complete, meaning it does not provide clear and complete facts. Under the best evidence rule, a photograph must be complete and clear for it to be admissible as evidence of a fact. Since the photograph lacks completeness, it cannot meet the best evidence standard. Therefore, the photograph is inadmissible as it does not provide conclusive evidence of a marriage. 

ANSWER: E
