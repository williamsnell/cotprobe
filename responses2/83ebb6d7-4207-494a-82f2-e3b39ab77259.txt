Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the zeros of a polynomial in a finite field. The polynomial is x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x, and the field is Z_5. Z_5 means we're working modulo 5, right? So all coefficients are considered modulo 5. 

First, I remember that in a finite field, the number of zeros a polynomial can have is at most equal to its degree. Since this is a 5th-degree polynomial, it can have up to 5 zeros. But wait, the question is asking for all zeros, not just the maximum possible. So I need to check each element in Z_5 and see if they satisfy the equation.

Z_5 has elements 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So I'll plug each of these into the polynomial one by one.

Let's start with x=0. Plugging in 0 gives 0^5 + 3*0^3 + 0^2 + 2*0 = 0. So 0 is a root. So 0 is definitely one zero.

Next, x=1. Let's compute each term:

1^5 = 1
3*(1)^3 = 3*1 = 3
1^2 = 1
2*(1) = 2

Adding them up: 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7. Modulo 5, that's 2. So the result is 2, not zero. So 1 is not a root.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Oh wait, the polynomial is x^5 +3x^3 +x^2 +2x. So substituting x=1: 1 + 3*(1) + 1 + 2*(1) = 1 +3 +1 +2 = 7. 7 mod5 is 2. So yes, 2, not zero. So x=1 isn't a root.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me recalculate. Oh wait, no, that seems correct. So 1 isn't a root.

Next, x=2. Let's compute each term.

2^5 = 32. 32 mod5 is 2 (since 5*6=30, 32-30=2).
3*(2)^3 = 3*8=24 mod5. 24/5 is 4 with remainder 4. So 4.
(2)^2 =4.
2*(2)=4.

Now adding all terms: 2 +4 +4 +4 = 14. 14 mod5 is 4. So the total is 4. Not zero. So x=2 isn't a root.

Moving on to x=3.

Compute each term:

3^5: 3^2 is 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243. 243 mod5: 5*48=240, so 243-240=3. So 3^5 mod5 is 3.

3*(3)^3: 3^3 is 27, 27 mod5 is 2. So 3*2=6. 6 mod5 is 1.

(3)^2 is 9 mod5 is 4.

2*(3) is 6 mod5 is 1.

Adding them: 3 +1 +4 +1=9. 9 mod5 is 4. So total is 4. Not zero. So x=3 isn't a root.

Finally, x=4.

Compute each term:

4^5: Let's compute step by step. 4^2=16 mod5=1. 4^3=4*1=4. 4^4=4*4=16 mod5=1. 4^5=4*1=4 mod5=4.

3*(4)^3: 4^3 is 64 mod5: 64 ÷5 is 12*5=60, so 64-60=4. So 4 mod5. Multiply by 3: 3*4=12 mod5=2.

(4)^2=16 mod5=1.

2*(4)=8 mod5=3.

Adding them:4 +2 +1 +3=10. 10 mod5=0. So x=4 is a root.

So far, the roots are x=0 and x=4.

Wait, but the polynomial is of degree5, so it can have up to five roots. But in Z_5, since it's a field, the maximum number of roots is the degree. But in this case, only two roots so far found.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check each calculation again.

x=4: 4^5=4, 3*4^3=3*(64 mod5=4)=12 mod5=2, 4^2=16 mod5=1, 2*4=8 mod5=3. Sum:4+2+1+3=10 mod5=0. Correct.

So, so far, 0 and 4 are zeros.

Wait, but in the options given, option F is 0,4. So F is an option. But wait, let me see if any other x in Z_5 are roots.

Wait, another x: x=1, x=2, x=3, x=4.

Wait, any other approach? Maybe factor the polynomial.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the polynomial. Let me see if I can factor it.

Wait, but since we've found that x=0 and x=4 are roots, the polynomial can be factored as x*(x-4). Wait, but in Z_5, (x-4) is the same as (x+1), because -4 mod5 is 1. So the factor would be (x)(x+1). But wait, wait, perhaps I should factor the polynomial more carefully.

Wait, the polynomial is x^5 +3x^3 +x^2 +2x. Let me factor out an x: x(x^4 +3x^2 +x +2). So the other factor is x^4 +3x^2 +x +2.

Now, we need to check if this quartic has any roots. Let's plug in x=1 again.

x=1: 1^4=1, 3*1=3, 1, 2. Sum:1+3+1+2=7 mod5=2. Not zero.

x=2: 2^4=16 mod5=1, 3*4=12 mod5=2, 2, 2. Sum:1+2+2+2=7 mod5=2. Not zero.

x=3: 3^4=81 mod5=1, 3*(9)=27 mod5=2, 3, 2. Sum:1+2+3+2=8 mod5=3. Not zero.

x=4: 4^4=256 mod5=1, 3*(16)=48 mod5=3, 4, 2. Sum:1+3+4+2=10 mod5=0. So x=4 is a root of the quartic. So the quartic factors as (x-4)(x^3 + ... ), perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the quartic can be factored further.

Wait, the quartic is x^4 +3x^2 +x +2. Let's see if x=4 is a root again. Oh wait, x=4 is a root of both the quartic and the original polynomial, but I think I already found that.

Wait, but maybe it's better to factor the quartic. Let me think.

Wait, let me try to factor the quartic. Let me assume x=4 is a root, so perhaps (x-4) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division.

Divide x^4 +3x^2 +x +2 by (x-4). Alternatively, using synthetic division.

Wait, in Z_5, 4 is the root, so synthetic division with 4.

Wait, but for synthetic division, we consider the coefficients. The quartic is x^4 +0x^3 +3x^2 +x +2.

So the coefficients are 1 (x^4), 0 (x^3), 3 (x^2), 1 (x), and 2 (constant).

Setting up synthetic division with root 4:

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by 4 →4. Add to next coefficient: 0 +4=4.

Multiply 4 by4=16 mod5=1. Add to next coefficient: 3+1=4.

Multiply 4 by4=16 mod5=1. Add to next coefficient:1 +1=2.

Multiply 2 by4=8 mod5=3. Add to next coefficient:2+3=5 mod5=0. So no remainder, as expected.

So the quartic factors as (x-4)(x^3 +4x^2 +4x +2). Wait, no, wait, the coefficients after division are 1,4,4,2, and the last term is 0, so the quartic is (x-4)(x^3 +4x^2 +4x +2). So the quartic is (x-4)(x^3 +4x^2 +4x +2).

Wait, but I can factor the cubic further. Let me look for roots of the cubic x^3 +4x^2 +4x +2 in Z_5.

Testing x=0: 0 +0 +0 +2=2≠0.

x=1:1+4+4+2=11 mod5=1≠0.

x=2:8 (since 2^3=8 mod5=3) +4*(4)=4*4=16 mod5=1 →3+1=4; then 4*(2)=8 mod5=3; 3 +2=5 mod5=0. Oh wait, let's compute it step by step.

Wait, the cubic is x^3 +4x^2 +4x +2.

At x=2: 2^3=8 mod5=3; 4x^2=4*(4)=16 mod5=1; 4x=8 mod5=3; 2=2. Sum:3+1+3+2=9 mod5=4. So not zero.

x=3: 3^3=27 mod5=2; 4x^2=4*9=36 mod5=1; 4x=12 mod5=2; 2=2. Sum:2+1+2+2=7 mod5=2. Not zero.

x=4: 4^3=64 mod5=4; 4x^2=4*16=64 mod5=4; 4x=16 mod5=1; 2=2. Sum:4+4+1+2=11 mod5=1. Not zero.

Wait, so is there any x in Z_5 that makes the cubic zero? I haven't found any. So perhaps the cubic doesn't factor further in Z_5, meaning that the only roots of the original polynomial are 0 and 4. So the polynomial has exactly two roots in Z_5.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option F is 0,4, which would make sense. So the answer should be option F.

The problem requires finding all zeros of the polynomial \( x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). 

1. **Substitute each element of \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) into the polynomial**:
   - \( x = 0 \): The polynomial evaluates to 0, so 0 is a root.
   - \( x = 1 \): Evaluates to 2, not a root.
   - \( x = 2 \): Evaluates to 4, not a root.
   - \( x = 3 \): Evaluates to 4, not a root.
   - \( x = 4 \): Evaluates to 0, so 4 is a root.

2. **Factor the polynomial**:
   - Factor out an \( x \): \( x(x^4 + 3x^2 + x + 2) \).
   - Further factor the quartic \( x^4 + 3x^2 + x + 2 \) and find that \( x = 4 \) is a root again.
   - Perform synthetic division and find the cubic factor \( x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x + 2 \).

3. **Check the cubic for additional roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \)**:
   - Test all elements of \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) and find no additional roots.

4. **Conclusion**: The polynomial has exactly two roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), 0 and 4.
