Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because decomposition reactions are a bit tricky for me. Let me try to think through this step by step. The question is about the decomposition of sodium nitrate, NaNO3, into sodium nitrite, NaNO2, and oxygen gas, O2. And the goal is to find out how much NaNO3 is needed to produce 1.50 grams of O2.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that when NaNO3 decomposes, it breaks down into NaNO2 and O2. The balanced chemical equation should be something like this: 2 NaNO3 → 2 NaNO2 + O2. Wait, let me make sure I got the coefficients right. Sodium nitrate has Na and NO3, so the reaction might produce sodium nitrite and oxygen. Let me check the elements. Sodium is present on both sides because we have 2 Na in NaNO3 and 2 Na in NaNO2. Nitrogen: same, 1 in each. Oxygen: On the left, each NaNO3 has 3 O's, so 2 moles have 6 O. On the right, NaNO2 has 2 O each, so 2 moles give 4 O, and O2 has 2 O each. So 4 + 2 = 6 O. That works out. So the equation is balanced as 2 NaNO3 → 2 NaNO2 + O2.

Wait, wait, the coefficients: 2 NaNO3 → 2 NaNO2 + O2. So the ratio is 2 moles of NaNO3 produce 1 mole of O2. Because in the products, the O2 comes from the oxygen in NaNO3.

Now, the problem states that we need 1.50 grams of O2. I need to find how much NaNO3 is required. So first, I should probably find out how many moles of O2 that is, then use the mole ratio to find moles of NaNO3, and then convert that to grams.

Let me calculate the moles of O2. O2 has a molar mass of about 32 g/mol. So 1.50 g divided by 32 g/mol. Let me do that calculation. 1.50 /32 = 0.046875 moles of O2.

Since the mole ratio is 2 moles NaNO3 → 1 mole O2, so each mole of O2 comes from 2 moles of NaNO3. So the moles of NaNO3 needed would be 0.046875 *2 = 0.09375 moles.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. If 2 moles NaNO3 produce 1 mole O2, then x moles NaNO3 produce 0.046875 moles O2. So x = (0.046875) * (2) = 0.09375 moles.

Now, find the mass of NaNO3. Its molar mass is Na: 22.99, N:14.01, O3:3*16.00=48. So 22.99 +14.01 +48 = 85.00 g/mol.

So the mass is moles * molar mass. 0.09375 mol *85 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 0.09375 *85. Hmm, 0.09 *85=7.65, 0.00375 *85=0.31875. So total is 7.65 +0.31875 = 7.96875 grams. So approximately 7.97 grams. Looking at the options, option J is 7.97 g.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the stoichiometry. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial balanced equation. Oh, wait, the equation I wrote was 2 NaNO3 → 2 NaNO2 + O2. So yes, 2 moles of NaNO3 produce 1 mole O2. So the ratio is correct.

Alternatively, another way to approach it: moles of O2 = 1.50g /32g/mol=0.046875. Each mole of O2 comes from 2 moles NaNO3, so 0.046875 *2=0.09375 moles NaNO3. Molar mass of NaNO3 is Na:22.99, N:14.01, O3:3*16=48. So 22.99+14.01=37, plus 48 =85. So yes, 0.09375 *85=7.96875 g, which is about 7.97 g. So option J.

To determine how much NaNO3 is required to produce 1.50 g of O2, we start by writing the balanced chemical equation for the decomposition of NaNO3:

\[
2 \, \text{NaNO}_3 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{NaNO}_2 + \text{O}_2
\]

From the equation, 2 moles of NaNO3 produce 1 mole of O2. The molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol, so the moles of O2 produced are:

\[
\text{Moles of O}_2 = \frac{\text{Mass of O}_2}{\text{Molar mass of O}_2} = \frac{1.50 \, \text{g}}{32 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.046875 \, \text{mol}
\]

Using the stoichiometric ratio from the balanced equation, 2 moles of NaNO3 produce 1 mole of O2. Therefore, the moles of NaNO3 required are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaNO}_3 = 0.046875 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.09375 \, \text{mol}
\]

The molar mass of NaNO3 is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Molar mass of NaNO}_3 = 22.99 \, (\text{Na}) + 14.01 \, (\text{N}) + 3 \times 16.00 \, (\text{O}) = 85.00 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The mass of NaNO3 required is then:

\[
\text{Mass of NaNO}_3 = \text{Moles of NaNO}_3 \times \text{Molar mass of NaNO}_3 = 0.09375 \, \text{mol} \times 85.00 \, \text{g/mol} = 7.96875 \, \text{g}
\]

Rounding to the appropriate significant figures, the mass of NaNO3 required is approximately 7.97 g. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:
