Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The problem is about an automobile braking, and I need to find the resultant force decelerating it 5 seconds after the brakes are applied. The options are all in pounds, so I'm guessing the answer is in force units, probably pounds-force. Right.

First, let me parse the given information. The mass of the automobile is 50 slugs. Oh wait, slugs are a unit of mass, right? And the initial velocity is 30 ft/sec. The braking relation is given as v = v0 - kt². So v0 is 30 ft/s, and k is 0.30 ft/s³. Time t is in seconds.

So I need to find the force when t=5 seconds. Oh, and the question is about the resultant force, so I should remember Newton's second law, F = ma. But wait, in this case, the mass is given, so maybe I can use that.

Wait, the problem is about deceleration, so the acceleration (a) would be negative because it's slowing down. Since F = ma, and a is negative, the force would be negative, indicating direction. So the direction here would be opposite to the motion, hence the negative sign.

But wait, how do I find the acceleration at t=5? Oh, because the velocity is given as a function of time, I can find the acceleration by taking the derivative of velocity with respect to time. Because acceleration is dv/dt.

So v(t) = v0 - kt². Let's compute dv/dt. The derivative of v0 (a constant) is zero. The derivative of -kt² is -2kt. So acceleration a(t) = -2kt.

Wait a minute, but what is the sign here? Well, the problem states that the velocity decreases to zero. So initially, the velocity is 30 ft/s, and it's decreasing. So the acceleration should be negative, right? Because the velocity is getting smaller. So a(t) = -2kt, which would be negative if k is positive. Let me plug in the numbers.

k is 0.30 ft/s³, so a(t) = -2 * 0.30 * t = -0.60 t ft/s².

At t=5 s, a(5) = -0.60 * 5 = -3.0 ft/s². So the acceleration is -3 ft/s². Wait, but force is F = m * a. The mass is 50 slugs. So F = 50 * (-3) = -150 lb. Because force in pounds is mass times acceleration, in ft/s², since 1 slug·ft/s² is a pound-force.

So the force is -150 lb, which would mean it's a decelerating force in the opposite direction of motion. Looking at the options, option E is -150 lb. So the answer should be E.

Wait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, the problem gives me the velocity as a function of time: v = v0 - kt². So taking derivative gives a(t) = dv/dt = -2kt, which is correct. Then plugging in k=0.30 and t=5, gives a= -0.60 *5= -3, so a= -3 ft/s². Then, F=ma=50 slugs * (-3 ft/s²)= -150 lb. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the force is 150 pounds in the negative direction, which is decelerating. So the correct answer is E.

To determine the resultant force decelerating the automobile 5 seconds after the brakes are applied, we use the given velocity function and apply Newton's second law. The automobile's mass is 50 slugs, and the velocity function is \( v = v_0 - kt^2 \), where \( v_0 = 30 \, \text{ft/sec} \), \( k = 0.30 \, \text{ft/sec}^3 \), and \( t \) is the time in seconds.

1. **Find the acceleration**: The acceleration \( a(t) \) is the derivative of the velocity with respect to time:
   \[
   a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = -2kt
   \]
   Substituting \( k = 0.30 \, \text{ft/sec}^3 \) and \( t = 5 \, \text{sec} \):
   \[
   a(5) = -2(0.30)(5) = -3.0 \, \text{ft/sec}^2
   \]

2. **Calculate the force**: Using Newton's second law \( F = ma \), where \( m = 50 \, \text{slugs} \):
   \[
   F = 50 \times (-3.0) = -150 \, \text{lb}
   \]
   The negative sign indicates that the force is in the opposite direction to the motion, causing deceleration.

Thus, the resultant force decelerating the automobile 5 seconds after the brakes are applied is \( -150 \, \text{lb} \).
