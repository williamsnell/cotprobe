Okay, so I've got this question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

The question says: A household saves 10% of its income and adds three-quarters of its saving to cash balances. We need to find out the value of the loan contracts when their income is $30,000 per year.

Hmm. So, first, let's break it down. The household saves 10% of their income. Their income is $30,000. So, the saving would be 10% of 30k. Wait, 10% is easy, right? 10% of 30k is 3k. So, $3,000 saved.

But then it says they add three-quarters of their saving to cash. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me read it again. The household "chooses to save 10 percent of its income and to add three quarters of its saving to cash balances." So, their saving is 10% of income, which is $3k. Then, they take three quarters of this saving and add it to their cash. So, three quarters of $3k is 2.25k. So, they add $2,250 to their cash?

Wait, but then the question is about the loan contracts they demanded when their income was $30k. Oh, wait, wait. So, when their income is $30k, they save 10% of that, which is $3k, and then they add three quarters of their saving to cash. So, their total cash after this would be their original cash plus the added amount.

Wait, but how does this relate to their loan contracts? Oh, I think I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the question is about the total amount they have to pay in loans, which is the amount they don't keep in their savings. Wait, no. Or maybe it's about the amount they could have saved, but that doesn't make sense because they're adding to their cash, not taking from it.

Wait another thought: Maybe the household's saving is 10% of their income, which is $3,000. But they're adding three quarters of their saving to their cash. So, of the $3k savings, three quarters is $2,250. So, that $2,250 is added to their cash. So their total cash balance would be their original cash plus this, but wait, the question is about the loan contracts they demanded. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the household's income is $30k, and they set aside 10% for savings, which is $3k. Then, they take three quarters of that saving (which is $2,250) and use that to pay off loans. So, the amount they demand in loans would be the $2,250 because that's the amount they're taking from their savings to pay off the loans. So, the loan contracts would require them to pay $2,250.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The question says: "what would be the value of the loan contracts it demanded when its income totaled $30,000 per year?"

So, when their income is $30k, their saving is 10% of that, which is 3k. Then, they add 3/4 of their saving to cash. So, 3k * 3/4 = 2.25k. So, they take 2.25k from their saving and add it to cash. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because they are adding it to cash, meaning their cash increases. But the question is about the loan contracts. So perhaps the loan amount is the amount they borrow, which they can't use for other purposes. So, maybe the loan amount is the savings they have, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the household's income is $30k. They set aside 10% (so $3k) for savings. Then, they take three quarters of that $3k (which is $2,250) and use that to pay off a loan. So, the loan they're demanding is $2,250. So, the answer would be B: $2,250.

But wait, another approach: Maybe the loan is the amount they have to pay, which is the amount they don't keep in savings. Because they're taking three quarters of their savings and using it to pay off the loan. So, their saving is $3k, and they use 3/4 of that to pay off the loan. So, the loan amount is 3/4 * 3k = 2.25k, which is $2,250. So the answer is B.

Alternatively, if they had a loan that requires them to set aside 10% and then add three quarters, but that doesn't quite make sense. Wait, perhaps the household wants to have a certain amount in their savings, and that's 70% of their income. Let me think again. Because 10% is savings, and then they take three quarters of that saving (so their savings becomes 10% + 75% of 10%).

Wait, no, that's adding to their cash, not their savings. So, the household's total savings would be 10% (which is $3k) plus any additional they take from their savings. But in this question, it's said they add three quarters of their saving to cash. So, their total saving is 10% (3k) plus 75% of that, which is 2.25k. So, their total savings would be 3k + 2.25k = 5.25k. But that doesn't make sense because the question is about the loan they demanded, which they can't use for other purposes.

Wait, perhaps the household's loan is the amount they have to pay, which is the saving they have. So, when their income is $30k, their saving is 10% (3k), but then they add three quarters of their saving (2.25k) to their cash. So, their total savings would be 3k (initial) plus 2.25k (added to cash), making 5.25k. But that would mean they've over-saved and have more than their income. That doesn't make sense for a loan.

Alternatively, perhaps the household's loan is the amount they have to save beyond a certain amount. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options. The options are all in the 1k to 5k range. Let's see: 

The household's income is $30k. They save 10%, which is $3k. Then, they add three quarters of their saving to cash. So, three quarters of $3k is $2,250. So, they add $2,250 to their cash balance. So, when calculating the loan, perhaps the amount they have to pay is the $2,250 that they're using to pay off the loan. So, the loan is $2,250, which is option B.

Alternatively, another approach: The household's income is $30k. They set aside 10% (3k) for savings. Then, they take 75% of that saving (2.25k) and use it to pay off a loan. So, the loan amount is 2.25k. So, that's $2,250, which is option B. So, the correct answer should be B.

To determine the value of the loan contracts demanded by the household, we analyze the given information step by step. The household's income is $30,000 per year, and they save 10% of their income, which is $3,000. They then add three quarters of this saving to their cash balances. Calculating three quarters of $3,000 gives $2,250. This $2,250 is the amount they use to pay off the loan. 

Thus, the value of the loan contracts demanded is $2,250.
