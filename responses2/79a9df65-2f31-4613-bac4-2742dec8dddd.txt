Okay, so I'm trying to answer this branding strategy question. Let me read it again. The question is about a branding strategy that's called a multibranded policy. I remember that branding strategies vary, but I'm not exactly sure which one this is.

The question says it requires each product to be branded independently, not related to others. So it's a strategy where each product has its own brand. Hmm, what do I know about different branding strategies? I think there are some terms like multi-product branding, sub-branding, etc.

Wait, multi-product branding is when a company offers multiple products under a single brand. But that might be the opposite of what's described here because here each product is being branded separately. So maybe it's not multi-product branding.

Sub-branding is when a company creates a new brand for a specific product. So if each product is its own brand, that might mean sub-branding. But wait, another term I remember is mixed branding, which involves different strategies for different products. Or perhaps it's family branding, where a company creates multiple brands for the same product line. Or maybe it's individual branding, where each product has its own unique brand.

Wait, another term is brand extension. Brand extension is when a company creates a new brand for a different product line outside of its original brand. But that's not exactly the same as each product being a separate brand.

Oh, wait! There's also something called family branding. Family branding is when a company creates multiple brands for the same product line. For example, a car manufacturer might create a brand for sedans, another for SUVs, and another for hatchbacks. So that might not fit here.

Wait, maybe it's individual branding, where each product has its own brand name. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes terms can be confusing. Another thought: when each product is its own brand, it's called sub-branding. But the question is about a strategy where each product is branded independently, which might be called brand extension or maybe a different term.

Wait, another term is brand extension, but that's when they add a new brand to an existing one. For example, a company might extend their brand name to a new product. That's not exactly each product being its own brand.

Wait, perhaps it's called family branding, but that's more about creating multiple brands for the same product line. Or maybe it's called individual branding, where each product has its own brand.

Wait, another term is brand extension, but that's not the same. Alternatively, it could be brand extension for each product, which isn't one of the options. Let me think again.

The question is about a strategy where each product is branded independently; so each product has its own unique brand. So that's sub-branding. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's called family branding, but I thought family branding was about creating different brands for the same product line.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each option to see which fits.

Option A: Multi-product branding. That's when a single brand is used across multiple products. So not this.

Option B: Sub-branding. That's when a company creates a new brand for a specific product. So if you have multiple products, each with its own sub-brand, this could fit. So if each product is a separate sub-brand, that's exactly what the question describes.

Option C: Mixed branding. I think that's when different strategies are used for different products. Like, some products use one strategy, others another. So it's more about the approach per product rather than each being a separate brand.

Option D: Family branding. That's when a company creates multiple brands for the same product. So if I make a family brand for my car, maybe that's a brand for sedans, another for SUVs, etc. Wait, but each product would have its own family branding? Or is family branding the same as individual branding?

Option E: Corporate brands. That's when a company has its own brand name. Like Apple is Apple. Individual branding is when each product has its own brand. So this might be the same as individual branding.

Option F: Individual branding. Each product has its own brand. That sounds exactly like the question.

Wait, but I thought individual branding is when each product is its own brand. So that would fit. So options B and F are both suggesting that each product is its own brand.

Wait, but the answer options are A to J. The question is about which term describes this strategy.

Wait, the question says the strategy requires each product to be branded independently. So that's individual branding. So F is individual branding.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought family branding was a term for creating multiple brands for the same product line. So if each product is a separate family branding, then family branding would be correct.

Wait, let me check the definitions:

- Multi-product branding: Same brand across multiple products. So no, that's not it.

- Sub-branding: Create a new brand for a specific product. So that's not each product being its own brand.

- Mixed branding: Different approaches for different products. So no.

- Family branding: Create multiple brands for the same product line. So if you have multiple products under the same line, each gets a family branding. So F says each product is its own brand, which is individual branding.

Wait, I'm getting myself tangled. Let me think again. The question is about each product being a separate brand.

If each product is its own brand, it's called individual branding. So F is the answer.

But I also recall that family branding is another term for this. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing terms. Wait, family branding is when a company creates multiple brands for the same product line, which is not the same as each product being a separate brand.

Wait, perhaps individual branding is when each product has its own brand, which is what the question describes. So the correct answer is F: Individual branding.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure because sometimes family branding and individual branding are used interchangeably. Alternatively, maybe the correct term is individual branding. So I think the answer is F.

The correct term for a branding strategy where each product is branded independently of others is **individual branding**. This refers to each product having its own unique brand name, which aligns with the description given in the question.

Answer: F
