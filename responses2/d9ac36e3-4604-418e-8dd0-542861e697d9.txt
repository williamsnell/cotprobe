Question:

According to usual practice, a long-time regular customer left her car at an auto mechanic's shop with written instructions to "check and tune up the engine; make sure the brakes are good and working; examine the tires; also, check and repair all major systems because I am driving cross country next week." She did not see the mechanic or discuss with him the price or other details. When she picked up the car, there was a bill for $5,000 on the dash board. All of the services and parts were workmanlike, not defective and pertained to the areas in the instructions. She refused to pay, claiming that there was no agreement and that the mechanic should have called for advance approval. Can she be held responsible for contractual services performed?

Options:

A: No, because there is always an implication that the provider must get permission before doing work not approved.
B: No, because there was no written agreement specifying the cost of the services.
C: Yes, because she left written instructions, which can be considered a contract.
D: Yes, because she had a history of leaving her car for service without discussing price or details.
E: Yes, because the circumstances, including prior practice, showed intent to contract and a meeting of the minds.
F: No, because a contract cannot be based on implications and guess work.
G: Yes, because the circumstances and past practice established an implied-in-law contract based on mutual assent.
H: No, because the mechanic did not provide an estimate before performing the services.
I: No, because she did not explicitly agree to the price of the services.
J: Yes, because the quality of the work was satisfactory and pertained to the areas in the instructions.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the customer can be held responsible for the services she provided. Let's break down what's happening here.

First, let's look at the facts. She left her car for an auto mechanic with specific instructions. The mechanic didn't discuss the price or details, and she refused to pay. She ended up with a $5,000 bill. All the services were workmanlike, and the parts were good, but she didn't agree to the price. The question is whether she can get responsible for the services.

I remember that contracts can vary based on different factors. One key point is whether there was an explicit written agreement. The options suggest that the answer is about whether the customer had a written contract.

Option A says she can't be responsible because the mechanic must get permission before doing work not approved. But wait, she didn't have any written agreement. She just left the car, and the mechanic didn't agree to any price. So maybe she's not subject to that.

Option B says she can't be responsible because there was no written agreement for the cost. But wait, the problem says there was a bill on the dashboard, which might imply she agreed to the price. Or maybe not. Wait, sometimes a bill can indicate agreement without a written contract.

Option C says she's responsible because she left instructions, which are contracts. I think this is about implied contracts. Some states allow for implied contracts based on implied agreements, like the implied duty of care when a customer leaves.

Option D and E are about prior history. Option D says she had a history of leaving without discussing details. Option E says she didn't meet the mind of the contract. So, does that apply here? She left without discussing, which might be a red flag.

Option F says no because contracts can't be based on guesswork. That's more about whether the customer knew something, but the facts don't say that.

Option G says yes because mutual assent and past practice established an implied-in-law contract. That sounds like it's about mutual agreement and past behavior. Like, if the customer has a history of leaving without any issues, maybe the mechanic agreed to do the work, so it's implied.

Option H says no because the mechanic didn't provide an estimate. But the customer refused to pay, and the bill was there. So maybe she was informed of the cost, but the mechanic didn't agree.

Option I says she didn't agree to the price. The customer did refuse to pay, so she didn't agree to any terms.

Option J says yes because the work was satisfactory. But that's more about the quality of the service, not the contract.

So, putting it together. The key here is whether she had a written contract. There's no written agreement mentioned. She left the car, didn't discuss price, and refused to pay. But some jurisdictions allow implied contracts based on not having a written agreement and the customer's history of leaving without issues.

Wait, what's the difference between implied contract and mutual assent? The implied contract is based on the customer's implied duty of care, while mutual assent is about a formal agreement. So if the customer left without any agreement, mutual assent could be a way, but if the mechanic didn't agree, then maybe not.

In this case, she didn't discuss the price or details, but she did not agree to any terms. So, the absence of an explicit written agreement would mean there was no contract. But if the customer's history suggests she's generally a good customer, maybe it's implied.

Looking back, the options: G says yes because mutual assent and past practice. But wait, mutual assent is a formal contract, whereas leaving without agreement might be implied. So if the customer has a history of leaving without any issues, maybe the mechanic agreed to the work, making it an implied contract.

Alternatively, the absence of an agreement but the customer leaving without issues could imply a contract.

Wait, the problem is that she left without any written agreement. So, is that an implied contract? But I'm not entirely sure. I remember reading that if a customer leaves the car without any written contract, it's considered an implied contract. But that's when the customer has a history of not engaging in such behavior, which might not always apply.

Another approach: the question is whether she can be held responsible. If the customer left the car without any written contract, the mechanic may have implied that the customer agreed to the work, making it a contract based on her history.

So, looking at the options, G says yes because of mutual assent and past practice. But mutual assent is formal. Alternatively, if she had a history of not having such issues, perhaps the mechanic agreed to perform the work, leading to an implied contract.

Wait, another possibility is that she left the car without any written contract, but the mechanics didn't agree to any price, so she didn't just refuse; she was also denying a contract.

Alternatively, perhaps the fact that the work was satisfactory (J) isn't directly relevant, unless it's a separate issue.

Wait, but the bill was there, meaning she agreed to pay, but she refused. So she didn't agree to the price. So she didn't agree to the terms.

So the options are whether she can be held responsible for the services. So if there was no written contract, but the customer had a history of leaving without any issues, perhaps the mechanic agreed implicitly.

Looking at the options:

G: Yes, because mutual assent and past practice established implied-in-law contract.

Wait, mutual assent is a formal contract. So perhaps the correct answer depends on whether the absence of a written agreement implies a contract, and the customer's history supports that.

Alternatively, the customer's history is about leaving without any agreements, which sometimes can be a sign that they're generally reliable and clean, so the mechanic might have impliedly agreed.

So, in that case, the answer would be G: Yes, because mutual assent and past practice established an implied-in-law contract.

Wait, but mutual assent is formal, while leaving without agreement might be implied. So if the customer's past behavior suggests that they're generally clean and reliable, the mechanic might have implied that they agreed to the work, making it a contract.

So G's reasoning that mutual assent and past practice established an implied-in-law contract might not be entirely correct because mutual assent is formal. Alternatively, the answer could be that the absence of an agreement makes it an implied contract, hence G.

Wait, but another way: the customer didn't agree to any terms but left the car. Some jurisdictions allow for implied contracts based on not having a written agreement and a history of not engaging in such behavior, which leads to mutual assent. So in that case, the answer would be G.

Alternatively, if the absence of a written agreement and the customer's history (like past history of leaving without any issues) imply that the mechanic agreed to perform the work, then the answer would be G.

So, considering all this, the correct answer is likely option G. But I'm a bit unsure because mutual assent is a formal contract. Alternatively, leaving without agreement could be implied as acceptance, making it mutual. But I think in some cases, leaving without agreement is considered implied acceptance, which is a mutual contract.

So, in that case, the answer would be G.

The question revolves around whether a customer who left her car for an auto mechanic can be held responsible for the services performed. The key facts include the absence of a written agreement, the lack of explicit communication with the mechanic, and the customer's refusal to pay despite a bill. 

The analysis considers whether the absence of a written contract implies an implied contract. Some jurisdictions allow for implied contracts based on the customer's history of leaving without any agreements, suggesting mutual assent. However, mutual assent is typically formal, and leaving without agreement might be considered implied acceptance. The absence of a written contract and the customer's history of reliability suggest that the mechanic agreed to perform the work, making it an implied contract based on mutual assent and past practice.
