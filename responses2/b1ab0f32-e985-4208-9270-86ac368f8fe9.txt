Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve: 32 multiplied by 67. Hmm, not too bad, but let me think through it step by step. I remember that when multiplying two numbers, especially two-digit numbers, the standard algorithm is usually the way to go. 

First, I'll break down the multiplication into smaller parts. Maybe I'll use the distributive property. Let me write it out:

32  
x67  
-----  
?

Breaking it down, I can think of 67 as 60 + 7. So, 32 multiplied by 60 and then 32 multiplied by 7, and then add those two results together.

Starting with 32 x 60. Well, 32 x 6 is 192, and since it's multiplied by 10, I just add a zero at the end, making it 1920.

Next, 32 x 7. Let's see, 30 x7 is 210, and 2x7 is 14, so adding those gives 210 +14=224.

Now, adding the two results: 1920 + 224. Let me add the hundreds place first. 1920 is 1,920. 224 is 224. So 1,920 + 200 is 2,120, but wait, I added 224, so I need to add the remaining 24. So 2,120 +24 is 2,144.

Wait, so 32 x 67 equals 2,144. Let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to confirm is by using a calculator in my mind. Let me think, 32 times 60 is 1920, and 32 times 7 is 224. Adding them gives 2,144. Yeah, that seems right.

Looking at the options, option G is 2,144. So I think the answer is G.

The product of 32 x 67 is 2,144. 

Answer: G: 2,144
