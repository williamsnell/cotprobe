Okay, so I have this economics question here about why a good's tax burden falls mainly on the consumer. Hmm, I need to pick the right option. Let me think about this step by step.

The question is asking when a good is taxed, the burden is mainly on the consumer. I remember that tax incidence depends on the price elasticity of demand and supply. Elasticity measures how responsive the quantity demanded or supplied is to a change in price.

Wait, if demand is elastic and supply is inelastic, how does that affect the burden? I think when demand is more elastic, consumers are more responsive to price changes, so when a tax is imposed, they'll have to pay more. But with inelastic supply, the seller can't reduce the price much, so the tax burden might end up on the consumer. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The basic idea is that when demand is more elastic, consumers have more of it and can pass the tax onto them because they're more responsive. So the burden would fall on the consumer more if demand is elastic. On the other hand, if supply is inelastic, the seller can't reduce prices much—so the tax would have to go to the consumer.

Wait, but I think it's the other way around. How does the burden fall mainly on the consumer? The tax incidence depends on both demand and supply. I remember the concept of tax incidence: a perfectly inelastic good has zero elasticity for supply, so the entire burden falls on the consumer. But when demand is elastic, the burden on the consumer is higher because they have to pay more. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, no. I think when supply is inelastic, the burden is passed more to the consumers because the seller can't reduce prices much. Or no, actually, I'm getting it backwards. Let me think with an example.

Suppose a good has elastic demand and inelastic supply. So, when a tax is imposed, the price increases. With inelastic supply, the seller can't lower the price much—it might have to keep the price higher because the quantity supplied doesn't decrease much. So the tax is passed on to consumers as higher prices. But wait, wait, no, the tax is levied on the seller, so the burden could be on the consumers in terms of what they pay, or on the seller?

Wait, the question says "the tax burden falls mainly on the consumer." So the tax is imposed on the seller, and then the burden is on the consumer. So for that to happen, when the price increases, the difference between the new price and the original price (after tax) must be passed on to the consumer. So for that to happen, the demand must be inelastic. Because if demand is inelastic, consumers won't reduce their quantity purchased, so the price increase is more significant to them. So the tax burden falls on the consumer.

Wait, but I'm getting tangled up. Let me try another approach. The formula for the burden on the consumer is based on the price elasticity of demand. The basic formula for the amount of tax passed on is (tax rate) / (1 + (tax rate)/elasticity). So if demand is elastic (elasticity > 1), the tax burden is passed on more. But wait, if demand is elastic, consumers will reduce their purchases, so the price goes up more, which the consumers have to pay. So the burden on the consumer is higher.

But the question is about the burden mainly falling on the consumer. So the case when the demand is elastic and supply is inelastic. Because when supply is inelastic, the seller can't reduce the price much, so the entire burden goes to consumers. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should look at it this way: when consumers demand a good more when the price increases because demand is elastic, they have to pay more, so the burden is passed on. But when supply is inelastic, the seller can't lower prices much, so the tax is passed on. So if supply is inelastic, the burden falls more on the consumers.

So the situation where the demand is elastic and supply is inelastic. Because in that case, consumers have more responsiveness to price changes, but the seller can't reduce prices much, so the majority of the tax burden falls on the consumers.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think of it with numbers. Suppose the tax is $100. If demand is elastic, consumers have to pay more. If supply is inelastic, they might not reduce their quantity. So the price increases more, making the burden on consumers. Or wait, is it the opposite?

Alternatively, maybe when supply is elastic, the surplus is adjusted more, but when supply is inelastic, the quantity supplied doesn't change much, so the price has to rise more, making the burden on the consumer.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the basic concepts again.

Tax incidence: The relative elasticities of supply and demand determine how the burden is shared between the buyer and seller.

The formula for the burden on the buyer is:

(burden) = (tax rate) / (elasticity of demand + 1) * (price) 

Wait, but perhaps that's not exactly the correct formula. Alternatively, the formula is:

The proportion of the tax burden on the buyer is (Price Elasticity of Demand) / (Price Elasticity of Demand + Price Elasticity of Supply).

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. The formula is:

The burden on the buyer is (elasticity of supply / (elasticity of supply + elasticity of demand)) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the general rule. For a perfectly elastic supply, the burden falls entirely on the buyer. Because when supply is perfectly elastic, the seller can't set a price lower than the equilibrium, so the entire tax is passed on to consumers. So if supply is perfectly elastic, the burden goes to the consumer.

But when supply is inelastic, the seller can't reduce prices much, so the tax burden would be passed more to the consumer. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, when supply is inelastic, the price increases less, so the tax burden is passed on to the buyer.

Wait, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think: When supply is inelastic, sellers can't reduce prices much because the supply is limited. So when the price goes up, the consumers have to pay more, so the burden moves to the consumer.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of a real-life example. Suppose the government imposes a tax on gasoline. If the demand is elastic (consumers are sensitive to price), they'll reduce their purchase, so the price goes up more, and the burden is passed more to consumers. If supply is inelastic (gasoline producers can't reduce prices much), the price goes up more, but the burden is passed more to consumers because they have to pay a higher price.

Wait, but that's the same conclusion. So the burden falls mainly on consumers when the demand is elastic and supply is inelastic.

Looking at the options:

Option B: demand elastic, supply inelastic.

Option D: demand perfectly inelastic, supply inelastic.

Wait, wait no, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: both demand and supply are perfectly elastic.

B: demand elastic, supply inelastic.

C: demand and supply both elastic.

D: demand perfectly inelastic, supply inelastic.

E: demand unitary, supply elastic.

F: both perfectly inelastic.

G: demand inelastic, supply elastic.

H: demand inelastic, supply inelastic.

I: demand perfectly inelastic, supply perfectly elastic.

J: demand elastic, supply unitary elastic.

Wait, I'm trying to find when the burden is mainly on consumers.

In the case where demand is elastic and supply is inelastic, the entire burden falls on consumers. So that would be option B.

Wait, wait, but another way: if demand is inelastic and supply is elastic, then the consumers have less responsiveness, so the burden would fall more on the seller. Or is it the opposite?

Wait, perhaps when demand is inelastic and supply is inelastic, the burden falls equally. Or when supply is elastic and demand is inelastic, the burden falls more on the consumer.

Alternatively, the formula for the burden on the buyer is (弹性 of supply) / (elasticity of supply + elasticity of demand). So if supply is elastic (high elasticity), the numerator is high, so the proportion is larger. So the burden on the buyer is higher when supply is more elastic.

So for the burden to fall mainly on the consumer, the supply should be inelastic, so the denominator is high, making the fraction low. Therefore, the burden is mainly on the buyer when supply is inelastic.

So the correct condition is when demand is elastic and supply is inelastic. So option B.
</think>

When a good is taxed, the burden falls mainly on the consumer if the supply is inelastic and the demand is elastic. This is because consumers are more responsive to price changes when demand is elastic, while the seller cannot reduce prices much when supply is inelastic, passing the tax burden to consumers. 

To summarize, the correct condition is when demand is elastic and supply is inelastic. This corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
