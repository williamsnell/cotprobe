Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the right answer to this question about ethical psychology. Let me read the question again.

The situation is that a colleague, who's a licensed psychologist, just ended a sexual relationship with one of his clients. The colleague is sharing that with me, and I notice that the client is someone I referred to him about 18 months ago. As an ethical psychologist, what should I do?

The options are A to I, and I need to pick the best one. Let's break it down.

First, I remember that ethical psychologists have to be careful about who they report to, especially in cases of abuse or misconduct. The key here is the client's identity. The colleague is the one who ended the relationship, and the client is the one he refers to. 

I think about the ethical implications here. If I'm an ethics psychologist, I should probably report this to the right people. The client is the one involved, so I should probably contact them first. That way, they can take steps to resolve the situation. 

Looking at the options, option G suggests contacting the client, which makes sense. If I contact them, they can either handle the matter or report it to the appropriate authorities.

Option B says to contact authorities to report the colleague. That might be a way, but I think acting on the client's behalf is the priority. The colleague is the one who did the harm, not the client. So, contacting authorities to report the colleague could be a step, but contacting the client is more direct.

Option C advises apologizing to the client. That's a possibility, but I'm not sure if it's the best approach. An apology alone might not be enough if there's no immediate action, and the client might have other options.

Option D is to file a complaint against the colleague. That could be a formal step, but again, the priority is likely to fix the problem with the client first.

Option E says to ignore the matter. That's probably not ethical, because ignoring a potential issue could be a mistake.

Option F is to inform the ethics committee without notifying the colleague. Wait, but I think the ethics committee should be informed. The colleague is the one causing the problem, so they deserve to know they're being addressed.

Option I suggests discussing the matter further with the colleague. That shows empathy and understanding. It's good to have an open conversation to understand the situation and plan the next steps.

But I'm trying to remember the ethical guidelines. For psychological issues involving a client, the client's identity is crucial. The ethical psychologist should prioritize the client's interests over the colleague. So contacting the client makes sense.

So, the best answer is option G: contact the client and discuss the matter with her. That way, the client can take action, and the colleague is informed to avoid further issues.

The correct answer is G: contact the client and discuss the matter with her. 

**Answer: G**
