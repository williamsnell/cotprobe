Okay, so I need to figure out how to write 7/33 as a decimal. Hmm, I remember that to convert a fraction to a decimal, I can divide the numerator by the denominator. So, let me try that.

First, I'll set up the division: 7 divided by 33. Since 7 is smaller than 33, I know the decimal will start with 0., and then I'll add a decimal point and zeros to continue the division.

So, 7 divided by 33. Let me see, how many times does 33 go into 70? Well, 33 times 2 is 66, which is just under 70. So, 2 times. I'll write 2, subtract 66 from 70, which leaves 4. Bring down the next 0, making it 40.

Now, how many times does 33 go into 40? Just once, because 33 times 1 is 33. Subtract that from 40, we get 7. Bring down another 0, making it 70 again. Oh, this looks familiar. We're back to where we started after the first step.

So, the pattern repeats. That means the decimal is 0.212121..., where "21" repeats indefinitely. So, the decimal is 0.21 with a bar over the 21 to indicate it repeats.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.2121. That fits. So the answer should be H.

The correct decimal representation is 0.2121 repeating. 

Answer: H: 0.2121
