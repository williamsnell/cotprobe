Question:

A buyer filed a lawsuit against a seller based on a written contract allegedly executed at the time of the sale of the seller's hot dog stand to the buyer. Under the terms of the contract, the seller agreed not to open a hot dog stand for a period of two years within a distance of two miles of the old hot dog stand, now owned by the buyer. The buyer alleged in his complaint that the seller violated the contract by opening a hot dog stand one-half mile from the old location. The original contract was lost prior to trial. At trial, the buyer wants to introduce a duplicate carbon copy of the written contract. The seller objects as to the authenticity of the original written contract. The copy is

Options:

A: admissible, because the original contract was lost.
B: inadmissible, unless the seller admits to the authenticity of the duplicate.
C: inadmissible, because the seller did not sign or acknowledge the duplicate.
D: inadmissible, because the best evidence rule requires that the original contract always be used as evidence.
E: admissible, because the duplicate is a carbon copy.
F: inadmissible, because the duplicate might be a forgery.
G: admissible, only if the buyer can provide witnesses to confirm the authenticity of the duplicate.
H: admissible, if the court can confirm the fairness of the contract.
I: admissible, because the duplicate has the same legal value as the original contract.
J: inadmissible, because the seller contests the authenticity of the written contract.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this legal question. Let me read it carefully.

The buyer filed a lawsuit against the seller because there's a written contract they allegedly executed. The contract says the seller shouldn't open a hot dog stand for two years within two miles of their old location. The buyer says the seller opened one mile away, which is beyond two miles, so that's a violation. The original contract was lost before trial, so they want to bring a duplicate copy.

The seller says the original contract is invalid. The question is about whether the duplicate can be admitted at trial.

So the options are from A to J. I remember that contracts can sometimes be lost, so the original might not be available. But when you make a duplicate, what's the deal?

I think about evidence rules. There's the duplicate evidence rule. It's about whether the duplicate is a genuine copy. I remember that the best evidence rule says the original is more reliable because it's a genuine document. So if the seller says the contract is invalid, they might be lying because the duplicate might not be genuine.

Wait, but wait. There's also the concept of whether the contract is legally valid. If the contract is invalid, then the duplicate might be too. But the duplicate isn't the main issue hereâ€”the issue is the authenticity of the contract itself.

So the duplicate is supposed to be genuine. If the seller claims it's fake, that's a problem because the duplicate should be a copy. If it's a fake copy, that's another issue.

Also, the buyer is bringing a duplicate. The seller is objecting to the authenticity of the original contract. So the seller is trying to say that the contract they have is fake. If the duplicate is a copy, then the buyer's duplicate is probably genuine, but the seller's original might not be.

Wait, but if the original contract was lost, can you rely on the duplicate? The duplicate is a copy, but if the original is genuine, the duplicate should also be genuine. But if the original is lost, does that affect the duplicate?

Wait, but the contract is about the seller not opening a stand two miles from their old one. The seller opened one mile away, which is under the two-mile limit. So the contract says not to open that distance. So the violation is possible.

But under the duplicate evidence rule, the duplicate must be a genuine copy. If the original is lost, can you make a copy? Or does the fact that the contract was lost mean the original is not available, so the duplicate can't be proven?

Hmm, the duplicate evidence rule requires that the original is a genuine document. So if the original contract is lost, the seller can't make a genuine copy, because the original is not authenticated. So the duplicate would have to be authenticated, which could be difficult.

Wait, but the seller is offering the duplicate as a substitute for the original contract. If the original is lost, and the court doesn't know the original is real, then the seller might be objecting to the authenticity of the contract, which would make the duplicate's authenticity irrelevant.

Wait, but the duplicate is being presented as the contract. If the contract was lost, the original is not available. So the duplicate is supposed to be authenticated, unless the original contract was lost.

Ah, but when the contract was executed, it's a written contract. If the contract was lost, the original might be considered untraceable, making the duplicate's authenticity a question. But the contract was executed, so the original is still there, just lost.

Wait, but if the contract is lost, the original contract is still there, but they can't be shown to be genuine. So the seller can't rely on the original contract to prove that the contract is valid. Wait, but the contract was lost, so the original is not available for proof. So the duplicate is made, and the seller says the original was lost, so the duplicate is not genuine.

Wait, but under the duplicate evidence rule, the original must be genuine for the duplicate to be admitted. If the original is untraceable or lost, the duplicate can't be properly authenticated. So the seller would have to prove the original was genuine, which they can't because the contract was lost.

Wait, but in this case, the contract was supposedly executed, but then it was lost. So the original contract (the contract that's lost) is not available for proof. So the duplicate would have to be authenticated, but if the original is lost, the duplicate can't be proven to be genuine. Therefore, the duplicate can't be admitted as a genuine contract, which is needed to show the seller complied with the contract.

So the seller's argument is that the contract is invalid because they lost the original. If the original contract is untraceable, then the contract is not valid. But if the contract is still in use but untraceable, then the duplicate can't be proven to be genuine.

Wait, but the contract was executed, so it's still valid. The original contract was lost, so the seller can't rely on it to prove the contract was valid. So the duplicate can't be used to show the contract was valid because the original is not available. So the duplicate is inadmissible.

So what's the answer? The options are A to J.

Option A: admissible, because original was lost. But if the original was lost, the seller can't authenticate the contract. So the duplicate can't be admitted. So A is incorrect.

Option B: inadmissible, unless the seller admits authenticity. If the seller doesn't admit, can't use the duplicate. So B is correct.

Option C: inadmissible because seller didn't sign or acknowledge. But the seller is objecting to the authenticity of the original contract, not to the duplicate. So C is about the original, not the duplicate.

Option D: inadmissible because best evidence rule requires the original to be used. Correct. Because duplicate evidence requires the original to be genuine.

Option E: admissible if the court can confirm contract's fairness. But the issue is about authenticity, not fairness.

Option F: inadmissible because the duplicate might be a forgery. But that's about the copy's authenticity, not the contract's authenticity.

Option G: admissible only if buyer provides witnesses. Not sure. The question is about the duplicate's admissibility, not the issue of the contract's validity.

Option H: admissible if court confirms contract's fairness. Not directly relevant to the duplicate's admissibility.

Option I: admissible if the court confirms contract's validity. So if the contract was valid, but the seller says it's not, but the original was lost.

Wait, if the contract is valid, losing the original contract doesn't affect the validity of the contract. So the original contract's loss doesn't affect the contract's validity. The contract's validity is whether the contract was made. If the contract is still in use, the original is not available for proof. But the contract itself is valid. So the duplicate could be admitted because the contract's validity is determined by the contract's content, not the original.

Wait, but the issue is the authenticity of the contract. If the original contract is lost, the seller can't authenticate it. So the duplicate can't be used to prove the original's authenticity. So unless the seller can prove the original's authenticity, the duplicate can't support the contract's validity.

So the correct answer is B: inadmissible, unless the seller admits to the authenticity of the duplicate.

Wait, but the duplicate is a copy. So if the original is untraceable, can the duplicate be authenticated? Or is the duplicate's authenticity the issue?

Wait, the duplicate is a copy of the contract. If the contract was executed, then the original is valid. The contract was lost, so the original is still there but untraceable. The duplicate is a copy, so if the original is untraceable, the duplicate can't be considered authentic. So the duplicate can't be used to prove the contract's authenticity because the original isn't available. So the seller can't rely on the duplicate because the original's authenticity is untraceable.

Therefore, the duplicate is inadmissible. So the correct answer is B.

The correct answer is **B: inadmissible, unless the seller admits to the authenticity of the duplicate.**

**Explanation:**
When the original contract is lost, the duplicate cannot be properly authenticated because the original contract is untraceable. The seller's assertion that the original contract is invalid due to its unavailability means the duplicate lacks the necessary authenticity to be admitted as evidence. 

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A:** Incorrect. The duplicate cannot be admitted if the original contract is untraceable because the original is not genuine.
- **B:** Correct. The duplicate is inadmissible unless the seller admits the authenticity of the contract, as the original's authenticity is untraceable.
- **C:** Incorrect. The issue is about the original contract's authenticity, not the duplicate.
- **D:** Incorrect. The duplicate does not require the original to be used under the best evidence rule; it's about authenticity, not proof.
- **E:** Incorrect. Admissibility doesn't depend on the contract's fairness; it depends on the contract's authenticity.
- **F:** Incorrect. The issue is not about the copy being a forgery.
- **G:** Incorrect. The issue is about authenticity, not the duplicate's usage.
- **H:** Incorrect. Admissibility isn't tied to contract fairness for the duplicate.
- **I:** Incorrect. The issue isn't about the contract's validity; it's about authenticity.
- **J:** Incorrect. The issue isn't about the court's ability to confirm contract fairness.

Thus, the duplicate is inadmissible unless the seller accepts its authenticity, making **B** the correct answer.
