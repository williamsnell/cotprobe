What is the wavelength of a photon of this energy? Assume h = 6.626 × 10^-27 erg-sec and c = 2.998 × 10^10 cm/sec.

Options:

A: 2000 Å

C: 2864 \AA
D: 2200 Å
E: 4500 Å
F: 3400 Å

H: 3000 \AA
I: 4000 Å
J: 3200 \AA

Okay, so I've got this question here about the photoelectric effect. Hmm, I remember that the photoelectric effect involves photons ejecting electrons from a metal surface. The question says the work function for potassium is 4.33 eV, and we need to find the wavelength of a photon with that energy. Oh right, work function is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron.

Wait, I think the formula for the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. Right, so I need to find λ.

But wait, the units here. The given values are h in erg-sec and c in cm/sec. Oh, but energy is usually in electron volts (eV) here, so I might need to convert units to get wavelength in cm, then convert to angstroms or maybe meters, but the answer options are in Å. Let me think.

Wait, the formula E = hc/λ. So solving for λ gives λ = hc / E.

But E is 4.33 eV. However, h is given in erg-sec, and c in cm/s. I need to make sure that the units work out. Let's see, 1 eV is 1.602e-12 joules, and 1 joule is kg·m²/s². But maybe there's a simpler way. I remember that 1 eV corresponds to about 1.6e-12 joules, but perhaps more importantly, there's the relation between wavelength and energy in eV and cm.

Wait, I think the conversion factor between eV and cm is about 1 eV = 1240 angstroms, because λ (in Angstroms) = (hc)/(energy in eV) after appropriate unit conversions. Let me think.

Wait, the formula when E is in eV is λ (in Angstroms) = 1240 / E (eV). So for E = 4.33 eV, λ is 1240 / 4.33 ≈ let's calculate that.

1240 divided by 4.33. Let's see, 4.33 times 286 is around (4 * 286=1144, 0.33*286≈94.78 → 1238.78), which is close to 1240. So 286 is about right. So the wavelength is approximately 286 Angstroms.

Wait, but wait the options. Let me look at the options. Option C is 2864 Å? No, 2864 is much higher than 286. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the formula I used is λ (Angstroms) = 1240 / E (eV). So 1240 /4.33 = approximately 286. So about 286 Angstroms. Looking at the options, option C is 2864, which is much higher. So maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is λ = hc/(E). But wait, when E is in eV, the conversion factor is right. Oh wait, but I think 1240 eV·Å is the product hc. So when E is in eV, λ (in Angstroms) = 1240 / E (eV).

Wait, perhaps 1240 eV·Å is hc, where h is in eV·s and c in m/s. Let me double-check. Because hc is in eV·m when h is in eV·s and c in m/s.

Wait, but 1 eV is 1.6e-19 joules. And 1 meter is 1e10 angstroms. So let's see:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s → 6.626e-34 * (1e10 / 1.6e-19) → 6.626e-34 * (6.25e28) → (6.626 * 6.25) = 41.41, so 41.41e4 → 4.141e5? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps better to use the fact that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, and λ (in meters) = hc/(E). So let's plug in the numbers.

E =4.33 eV =4.33 * 1.602e-19 J = 6.94e-19 J.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s.

λ = (h c) / E = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (6.94e-19) → (1.9878e-25) / (6.94e-19) → 2.868e-7 meters.

Convert to Angstroms: 1 m is 1e10 Angstroms. So 2.868e-7 m * 1e10 Angstrom/m → 286.8 Angstroms.

So approximately 287 Angstroms. Looking at the options, option C is 2864, which is way higher. Option B is 2500 and A is 2000, which are lower. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be λ in Angstroms = 1240 / E (eV). Because hc in eV·Angstrom is 1240. So if E is in eV, λ in Angstroms is 1240 / E.

So 1240 /4.33 ≈ 286 Angstroms. So which option is closest? The options are:

A: 2000 → larger
B:2500 → larger
C:2864 → larger than 286
D:2200 → larger
E:4500 → larger
F:3400 → larger
G:3700 → larger
H:3000 → larger
I:4000 → larger
J:3200 → larger

Wait, none of them are 286. So perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me compute 1240 divided by 4.33 exactly.

4.33 * 286 = let's calculate 4 * 286 = 1144, 0.33 * 286 = 94.78. So 1144 +94.78 = 1238.78. But wait, 4.33 *286 = 1238.78, which is a little less than 1240. So 1240 /4.33 is approximately 286.03, which is about 286.03 Angstroms.

But wait, the options don't have 286. So maybe I should check if I used the correct formula.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the work function is given in eV, and the photon's energy is in eV, so the wavelength can be found using the formula:

λ = 1240 (in Angstroms) / (work function in eV) → 1240/4.33 ≈ 286.03 Angstroms, as before. So the answer is 286 Angstroms. Now, looking at the options, none of them is exactly 286. However, option C is 2864, which is about 10 times higher. Hmm. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, maybe I should calculate using the actual numbers.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

E = 4.33 eV = 4.33 * 1.602e-19 J = 6.94e-19 J

Compute λ: 

λ = (h * c) / E 

= (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (6.94e-19) 

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by E (6.94e-19 J):

1.9878e-25 / 6.94e-19 = (1.9878 /6.94) * 1e-6 meters.

1.9878 /6.94 ≈ 0.2867 → 0.2867e-6 m → 2.867e-7 m.

Convert meters to Angstroms: 1 meter is 1e10 Angstroms. So:

2.867e-7 m * 1e10 Angstrom/m = 286.7 Angstroms.

So 286.7 Angstroms. So the closest option is not present. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 2000 → 2000 -> 2000 Angstroms

B:2500

C:2864

D:2200

E:4500

F:3400

G:3700

H:3000

I:4000

J:3200

Wait, 286 is between 280 and 290. So none of the options exactly match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, maybe I added wrong. Let me recalculate 1240 divided by 4.33.

Wait, 1240.00 divided by 4.33.

4.33 × 286 = ?

Well, 4 *286=1144, 0.33*286=94.78. Sum 1144 +94.78 = 1238.78 → which is 1240 - 1238.78 = 1.22 left. So 1.22 /4.33 is approximately 0.28. So 286.28 → approximately 286. So that's the right calculation.

But that's not any of the options. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: 1 eV corresponds to 1240 Angstroms. So if the photon's energy is 4.33 eV, then the wavelength should be 1240 /4.33 → which is 286. So 286 Angstroms. But the options don't have 286. The closest option is C: 2864 Angstroms, which is 2864, which is way higher than 286. Alternatively, perhaps the units are in different places.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using E = hc/(lambda) but when E is in eV, lambda is in Angstroms.

Yes, exactly. So the formula is lambda (Angstroms) = 1240 / E (eV). So 1240/4.33 ≈ 286. So the correct answer isn't among the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait, wait. Another thought: sometimes the work function is given in kJ/mol, but no. The question says 4.33 eV, which is per electron. So our initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo? Or maybe I should consider that the option is 286 Angstroms, which is 28.6 nm.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 2864 Angstroms, which is 286.4 nm. That's longer than 286 nm, so it's 10 times larger. So if the correct answer is 286, but none of the options is 286, perhaps the intended answer is 2864, which is 10 times larger than our calculation. Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the work function was given in kJ/mol instead of eV. Because 4.33 kJ/mol is about 2.74 eV (since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 kJ/mol). Wait, 4.33 kJ/mol * (1 eV)/(1.602e-19 kJ/mol) ) → 4.33 / 1.602e-19 → which would be a huge number, but the question says 4.33 eV. So that doesn't apply.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the answer is 286 Angstroms, which is approximately 286.4 nm. But the options don't have that, except for option C, which is 2864 (28.64 nm). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation. Let's compute 1240 divided by 4.33.

Let me do this step by step. 4.33 * 286 = 4.33 * 200=866; 4.33 *80=346.4; 4.33 *6=25.98. Sum: 866 +346.4=1212.4 +25.98=1238.38. So 4.33 *286=1238.38. The target is 1240, so 1240 -1238.38 =1.62 left. So 1.62/4.33 ≈ 0.373. So the total is 286.373 Angstroms.

So approximately 286.4 Angstroms.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C: 2864, which is ten times larger. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the work function is 4.33 eV, but the photon must have at least that energy. So if the photon's energy is exactly 4.33 eV, the wavelength is 286.4 Angstroms. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another angle: sometimes, the formula is λ = 1240 / (E in eV) → which is what I used. So 1240 /4.33 → ≈286.4, so 286.4 Angstroms.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 2864 Angstroms, but it's ten times larger. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was wrong.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is λ = hc/(E), but E is in eV, so hc is in eV·m, and then converting to Angstroms. Let me compute it that way.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s → 6.626e-34 J·s

c =3e8 m/s → 3e8 m/s

E=4.33 eV → 4.33 eV = 4.33 * 1.602e-19 J → 6.94e-19 J.

So λ = (h c) / E = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(6.94e-19) → (1.9878e-25) / (6.94e-19) → 2.868e-7 meters.

To convert to Angstroms (1 Angstrom = 1e-10 meters), multiply by 1e10 → 286.8 Angstroms.

So again, 286.8 Angstroms. Which is approximately 287. So the closest option is none, but perhaps the intended answer is 2864, which is ten times larger, but that's not the math. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is 286 Angstroms, but maybe the options are wrong.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 2864, which is 28.64 nm. That's 10 times larger than 2.86 nm (which is 286 Angstroms). So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but that's 10 times larger. So perhaps I should choose the closest option, but since the calculations don't match any, the correct answer is 286 Ang. But since that's not an option, maybe the intended answer is option C, which is 2864, but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the calculation for 1240 / E, but perhaps E is in eV, but in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is λ = hc/(E) but E is in eV, and to compute in Angstroms, the formula is 1240/(E in eV) → 1240/4.33 ≈ 286. So the answer is not among the options. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the energy was given in kJ/mol, but no. The question states 4.33 eV, which is per electron.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the options again. The options given are:

A: 2000

B:2500

C:2864

D:2200

E:4500

F:3400

G:3700

H:3000

I:4000

J:3200

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, another approach: the wavelength in Angstroms is 1240 / energy in eV. So 1240 /4.33=286. So the answer is 286, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but it's ten times larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect, and the correct formula is λ = 1240 / (E in eV) → but that's the same formula. So the correct answer is 286 Ang, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the speed of light in a different unit. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the speed of light in meters per second, which I have. So perhaps I should double-check the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it with more precision. Let me compute 4.33 ×286.37.

4.33 * 286 = as before, 1238.78.

4.33 *0.37 → 4.33 *0.3=1.299; 4.33 *0.07=0.3031 → sum 1.299 +0.3031=1.6021. So 4.33 *286.37 = 1238.78 +1.6021 = 1240.3821. So 4.33 ×286.37 ≈ 1240.3821. Which is just a little over 1240. So 286.37 is the correct value.

So 286.37 Angstroms is the correct wavelength. Since the options don't have this, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 2864 Ang, but that's ten times larger. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but assuming that the calculation is correct, the answer would be approximately 286 Ang, which is not available. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is lambda (meters) = hc/(E (eV) * 1e-19). Let me compute this.

hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

E =4.33 eV =4.33 *1.602e-19 J =6.94e-19 J.

So lambda (meters) = 1.9878e-25 /6.94e-19 = 2.868e-7 m.

Convert to Angstroms: 1 m is 1e10 Angstroms → 2.868e-7 m *1e10 Angstrom/m = 286.8 Angstroms.

So again, same result.

So given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but that's ten times larger. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that energy in eV is E = hc/(lambda in meters) → but that's the same as the formula.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of 1240/4.33. Let me compute it more accurately.

1240 divided by 4.33:

4.33 × 286 = 4.33 ×200=866 + 4.33×86=371.78 → 866 +371.78 =1237.78.

Subtracting from 1240: 1240 -1237.78 =2.22.

So 2.22 left. 2.22 /4.33 → 0.513.

So adding to 286: 286 +0.513=286.513.

So 1240 /4.33 ≈286.513 Angstroms.

Which is approximately 286.5 Angstroms. So the correct wavelength is about 286.5 Angstroms.

Looking at the options, option C is 2864 Angstroms (286.4 nm). So that's ten times larger. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but it's incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question intended to give the wavelength in Angstroms, and the options were incorrect. But given all that, I think the correct answer is approximately 286 Angstroms, which is not present. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but with a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula should be lambda = 1240 / (E in eV). So 1240/4.33 → 286.5 Angstroms.

But looking at the options, option C is 2864, which is 10 times larger. So perhaps I should select option C, but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C, but the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check.

Let me compute 1240 divided by 4.33.

Let me do this as a long division.

4.33 into 1240.00.

First, 4.33 into 1240.00.

How many times does 4.33 go into 1240.00?

Let's compute 4.33 × 286 = 1237.78, as before. So 286 times goes into 1240.00, with a remainder of 2.22.

So 286 with a remainder of 2.22 → so 286 + 2.22 /4.33 → 286 + 0.513 → 286.513.

So 4.33 × 286.513 = 1240.00.

Thus, 1240/4.33 =286.513.

So the correct wavelength is 286.5 Angstroms.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps the intended answer is option C, but it's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I can't see it.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is lambda (meters) = hc/(E (eV) * 1.602e-19) → which is the same as before.

No, I think I've double-checked enough.

So, in conclusion, the correct wavelength is approximately 286.5 Angstroms, which is not listed among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is lambda = 1240 / (E in eV) → which is what I used earlier. So 1240 /4.33 ≈286.5 Angstroms.

So since the options don't have this, perhaps I should select the closest option, but none of the options are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the intended answer is option C, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1240/4.33. Let me compute it again.

Compute 4.33 × 286.5 = ?

4 ×286.5=1146.

0.33 ×286.5 → 0.3 ×286.5=85.95, 0.03 ×286.5=8.595 → sum 85.95 +8.595=94.545 → total 1146 +94.545=1240.545.

So 4.33 ×286.5 = 1240.545 → which is a little over 1240. So 286.5 would give 1240.545, which is over 1240. So 286.5 is just a bit over the correct value.

So 286.5 is 0.545 over for the calculation. So to get 1240, 286.5 is too high by 0.545. So perhaps the correct value is 286.5 - (0.545/4.33) → since 1240 is 0.545 over, so the delta is 0.545/(4.33) → 0.126 → 286.5 -0.126=286.374 → so 286.374 Angstroms.

Which is approximately 286.37 Angstroms, which is 286.37 Angstroms.

So approximately 286.4 Angstroms.

Again, the same result.

So given that, the correct answer is approximately 286.4 Angstroms, which is not present in the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the work function is in eV, and if the energy is higher than the work function, then the photon can eject the electron.

So, the work function is 4.33 eV, so any photon with energy higher than 4.33 eV can eject the electron. So the minimum energy photon needed is 4.33 eV.

Thus, the correct wavelength is 286.4 Angstroms.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula is lambda (meters) = hc/(E (eV)), so E is 4.33 eV.

Let me compute that:

h =6.626e-34 J·s →6.626e-34 J·s

c=3e8 m/s →3e8 m/s

E=4.33 eV →4.33 eV =4.33 *1.602e-19 J →6.94e-19 J.

So lambda (meters) = (6.626e-34 J·s *3e8 m/s) / (6.94e-19 J) → (1.9878e-25) / (6.94e-19) →2.868e-7 meters.

Convert to Angstroms: 1 m =1e10 Angstroms → 2.868e-7 m *1e10 Angstrom/m =286.8 Angstrom.

So same result.

Thus, the correct wavelength is approximately 286.8 Angstroms, which is not listed in the options.

Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula should be lambda (meters) = hc/(E (eV) * 1.602e-19) → which is the same as we have.

Thus, the correct answer is approximately 286.8 Angstroms, not present in the options.

Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but it's not correct, but perhaps I should choose it.
</think>

To determine the wavelength of a photon with a minimum energy of 4.33 eV, we use the relationship between energy and wavelength: 

\[
\lambda = \frac{hc}{E}
\]

where:
- \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)),
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( E \) is the energy of the photon (4.33 eV).

### Step 1: Convert Energy to Joules
Since 1 eV = \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), the energy in joules is:

\[
E = 4.33 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 6.94 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Wavelength
Using the formula \( \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} \), substitute the known values:

\[
\lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}) \times (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{6.94 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
hc = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8 = 1.988 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}.
\]

Now, divide by \( E \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{1.988 \times 10^{-25}}{6.94 \times 10^{-19}} = 2.868 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 3: Convert to Angstroms
Since \( 1 \, \text{m} = 10^{10} \, \text{Å} \), convert the wavelength to Angstroms:

\[
\lambda = 2.868 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \times 10^{10} \, \text{Å/m} = 286.8 \, \text{Å}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with Options
The calculated wavelength is \( 286.8 \, \text{Å} \), which does not match any of the provided options. However, if forced to choose the closest option, it would be **option C (2864 Å)**, though this result is ten times larger than the correct value. 

ANSWER: 286.8 Å
