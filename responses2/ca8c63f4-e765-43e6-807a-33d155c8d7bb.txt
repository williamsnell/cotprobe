Okay, so I've got this question here about information theory, specifically about the amount of information when a pair of dice is rolled and the sum is seven. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with information theory, the concept of entropy comes into play. Entropy measures the uncertainty or information content. The formula for entropy is H = -Σ p_i log2 p_i, where p_i is the probability of each outcome.

In this case, the possible outcomes are the sums of two dice. The question says the sum is seven. So, I need to find the probability of rolling a seven with two dice.

Wait, two dice each have 6 sides, so the total number of possible outcomes is 6*6=36. What's the number of ways to get a sum of seven? Let's list them: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). That's 6 possible combinations. So the probability of rolling a seven is 6/36, which simplifies to 1/6. So p = 1/6.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because when you roll two dice, the number of ways to get each sum varies. For seven, it's 6, but for other sums, it varies. So in this scenario, the man rolled a seven, but the question is about the information content of that event.

So the message is: "When a pair of dice were rolled, the resulting sum was a 'seven'." So the message is that the sum was seven. But the question is how much information is in this message. So I think the question is essentially asking for the entropy of this event.

Wait, but wait. The question isn't about the entropy of the sum being seven, but rather the information provided by the fact that the sum was seven. So perhaps I should think about the entropy of the event where the sum is seven. But no, maybe it's just the information given by the outcome of the dice roll.

Wait, no. The man has rolled a seven and it's given that the sum is seven. So the message's information is the amount of uncertainty about the outcome before we know it was a seven. Or wait, no, the message is that the sum was seven. So the message is the event that the sum is seven. So the information is the entropy of that event.

But wait, the question is phrased as "how much information is there in this message?" So the message is the event that the sum is seven. So the information is the entropy of that event. So the entropy H is calculated based on the probability of the event.

Wait, but in this case, the event is the sum being seven. So the probability p is 1/6. So H = - (1/6) log2(1/6) - (5/6) log2(5/6) * but wait, no, because the sum being seven is just one outcome, not multiple. So the entropy for the event that the sum is seven is H = -log2(1/6) because there's only one outcome. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, because the event is the sum being seven. So the probability of that event is 1/6. So the entropy for the event is H = - log2(1/6) = log2(6). Let me calculate that. Log2(6) is approximately 2.585 bits. Because 2^2.585 is about 6. So that's about 2.585 bits. But wait, is that the right approach?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering all possible outcomes when the sum is seven. So the message is that the sum is seven, but considering all possible outcomes that could have occurred, like the number of possible ways to get seven. But I don't think that's the way it's being measured.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The message is the event that the sum is seven. So the information is the entropy of that event. Since there's one outcome (sum=7) with probability 1/6, the entropy H is -log2(1/6) = log2(6) ≈ 2.585 bits. So the correct answer would be option C, which is 2.585 bits.

The question asks for the amount of information contained in the message "When a pair of dice were rolled, the resulting sum was a 'seven'." To determine this, we calculate the entropy of the event where the sum is seven. The probability of rolling a seven with two dice is 6/36 = 1/6. The entropy H is given by H = -log2(1/6) ≈ 2.585 bits. 

Answer: C: 2.585 bits.
