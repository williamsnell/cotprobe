Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about moral obligation as defined by Anscombe. Hmm, let me think through this. 

I remember that Anscombe wrote a series of works, probably including "Moral Relativism" or something like that. The question is asking what moral obligation specifically refers to. The options are A to J, each with different concepts.

Let me go through each option. Option A says it's the beliefs of a certain culture. I'm not sure about that. Culture's beliefs are part of it, but moral obligation is more about the framework, maybe?

Option B: the laws of a country. Hmm, laws are more about what is obligatory, but is it the definition of moral obligation? I think laws are part of the framework, but the obligation itself is more about the person's action.

Option C: the thoughts of an influential person. That doesn't sound right. Influential people might have moral standards, but the obligation is more about how they think, not their own thoughts.

Option D: the commands of God. That rings a bell. I remember that in his works, Anscombe discussed how moral obligations are a form of command given by God. So, he posited that moral obligation is a divine command.

Option E: the feelings of an individual. Feelings are emotions, but moral obligation is about actions and duties, not just feelings.

Option F: the desires of a community. Desires are more about what people want, not the obligation to act morally.

Option G: no real concept. That's probably not right; moral obligation is a real concept.

Option H: the teachings of philosophy. That's not what I'm thinking. His teachings are about ethics and morality, but the obligation itself is separate.

Option I: the norms of a society. Norms are the rules, so that's related. But I think moral obligation is a bit broader. Because norms are part of the framework, but the obligation itself is more about what is required by the culture.

Option J: the rules of a religious institution. Similar to norms, but again, the obligation is more about the framework.

Wait, but the question specifically asks what moral obligation signifies according to Anscombe. From what I remember, Anscombe's moral obligation is described as being a form of command given by God. So it's about divine command, which would be option D.

I think I'm confident now. The correct answer must be D.

The correct answer is D: the commands of God. According to Anscombe, moral obligation is a divine command, reflecting God's authority over moral duties. 

Answer: D
