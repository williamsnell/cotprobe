Okay, so I've got this question about impeachment in the U.S. Congress. I remember that impeachment is a process where a president can be removed from office if certain conditions are met. Let me think through each option one by one.

The question asks which statement is not true about impeachment. The options are A to D, each giving a different ground for impeachment. 

Option A says the grounds include high crimes and misdemeanors. I recall that impeachment can be based on crimes like abuse of power, fraud, or conspiring with the president. So high crimes and misdemeanors fit here. That sounds correct, so A is true.

Option B states that a majority vote in the House is necessary. Wait, in the impeachment process, the Senate has a majority vote for charges like impeachment. But the House does not. So majority in the House would mean you can't impeach the president. That seems contradictory. So B says a majority in the House is necessary, which is not true. But wait, I thought the House doesn't vote in impeachment. So B is not true, making it a possible answer.

Option C mentions grounds like treason and bribery. I'm pretty sure impeachment can be based on treason and bribery. For example, if someone is found guilty of bribery, the president can be impeached. So C is a correct ground and thus not the answer.

Option D says a three-fourths vote in the Senate is necessary. I remember that for impeachment, the Senate requires a two-thirds majority, not three-fourths. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The majority in the Senate is two-thirds, right? So three-fourths is more than that, more than needed. So the necessary majority is two-thirds, which is more than three-fourths. So D says three-fourths is needed, which is incorrect. So D is a true statement, so it's not the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. In impeachment, the Senate needs a two-thirds majority, which is more than three-fourths. So if the question says three-fourths, that would be incorrect. So D is a true statement, so it's not the correct answer.

Going back, the question is asking which is NOT true. So options A, C are correct grounds. B says a majority in the House is necessary, but I thought the House doesn't. So B is the incorrect statement, meaning the answer would be B.

- **Option D**: Incorrect, because a three-fourths vote in the Senate is not necessary; the Senate requires a two-thirds majority.

The statement that is not true is **B**.
