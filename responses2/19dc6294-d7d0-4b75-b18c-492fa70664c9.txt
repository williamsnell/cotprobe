Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is a long wire made of a smooth, round conductor. It runs above and parallel to the ground, which is assumed to be a large conducting plane. There's a high voltage between the conductor and the ground. The question is about where the maximum electric stress occurs.

Wait, electric stress? I'm a bit fuzzy on that term. Electric stress is probably related to the electric field in the conductor. Oh right, because in conductors, charges can redistribute when there's an electric field, moving to the surface. So, the electric field in the conductor can cause some stress, maybe stress in the material, which might be what's being referred to here.

So, conductor's electric field. I remember that in a conductor at electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. But the electric field just outside the surface is perpendicular to the surface and has a magnitude proportional to the surface charge density. Because when there's a potential difference (voltage), the electric field lines are from higher potential to lower, so near the conductor, the field would be pushing charge away from the conductor.

Wait, but the conductor is above the ground, which is a conductor itself. So the ground is a conductor, which means it has a lot of free electrons. When there's a voltage between the conductor and ground, electrons will move to the ground, right? So the conductor and the ground would have opposite charges, creating an electric field.

Wait, no. The conductor and the ground are both conductors. So when there's a voltage between them, like in a parallel setup, the charges on the conductor (positive or negative) will move to the ground's surface, right? So the charge density on the conductor's surface would be opposite to the ground's surface.

But the problem is about electric stress in the conductor. So the electric field in the conductor. The electric field just outside the surface would depend on the surface charge density. The formula I remember is E = σ/(ε₀ε_r), where σ is the surface charge density, ε₀ is vacuum permittivity, and ε_r is the relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of the conductor's material. But wait, for a conductor, ε_r is very high, so the field is much lower than in free space.

Wait, the electric field just outside a conductor is given by E = σ/(ε) where ε is the permittivity of the conductor material. But since the conductor is a good conductor (like aluminum), it has a very high σ, so E is low. But in this question, the conductor is a smooth round wire, so maybe it's a conductor like a wire, which is a good conductor, but maybe not a superconductor.

But the problem is about the maximum electric stress. So I think the maximum would occur where the electric field is strongest. Alternatively, perhaps where the field is highest in the conductor.

Wait, in a conductor, the electric field inside is zero, but the field just outside the surface is E = σ/(ε). Because the electric field inside the conductor is zero, but the field outside (at the surface) depends on the surface charge.

Wait, but if the conductor has a surface charge, then the electric field just outside is σ/ε. So the field is higher where σ is higher. Because σ is positive on the conductor's surface, negative on ground's surface. So the surface charge density is higher on the conductor (since it's a higher voltage), so σ is higher on the conductor's surface. So the electric field just outside the conductor's surface is higher where σ is higher.

So the maximum electric stress would occur where the electric field is the highest. That would be at the point with the highest σ. Since the conductor's surface has a higher σ than the ground's, the electric field there is the highest. So the maximum stress (E) occurs at the point of the conductor with the highest σ, which is the farthest from the ground.

Wait, but wait. If the conductor is a long wire, so the surface charge density σ would be highest at the farthest point from the ground. Because as you move away from the wire, the Gaussian surface (a cylinder around the wire) would enclose more charge. Assuming the voltage is uniform, the charge on the conductor's surface would be higher the further you are from the wire.

Wait, no. Because if the entire conductor is at a uniform potential, the surface charge density σ would vary with the distance from the wire. The closer you are, the higher the σ. Because the electric field from a charged cylinder decreases with distance, so higher charge density at smaller radii. So the surface charge density on the conductor would be highest at the surface if the wire is a good conductor. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Oh no wait, maybe I have it reversed.

Wait, think about a charged conductor. The electric field just outside a conductor depends on the surface charge. The higher the surface charge density, the higher the field just outside. So when the conductor is at a potential, the charge density is higher closer to the wire, because the field increases as you approach the conductor.

Wait, but if the conductor is isolated (like a sphere?), then the field inside is zero, but the field just outside depends on the charge. For a spherical conductor, the field outside is E = kQ/r², where Q is the charge. But in this problem, the conductor is a long wire. So the surface charge distribution might be more like that of a cylinder.

But when the conductor is a long cylinder, the surface charge density σ varies with r (the radial distance from the wire). The highest surface charge density would be on the surface of the conductor (r = R, where R is the radius of the conductor). Because for a cylinder, the electric field just outside is E = σ/(ε), which means higher sigma leads to higher E. So the maximum electric field should occur at the surface of the conductor. But wait, the conductor is above the ground, which is a larger conductor. So the surface of the conductor is at a certain height above the ground.

Wait, but the problem says the conductor is above and parallel to the ground. So the distance between the two conductors (conductor and ground) is fixed. Let's say the conductor is at a height h above the ground. So the surface of the conductor is at a certain point.

Wait, the electric field near the conductor is E = σ/(ε). So the higher σ, the higher E. So the maximum E would occur where σ is maximum. For the conductor, the surface charge density σ is higher where the radial distance from the wire is smaller, because the electric field from a cylinder (wire) is E = (λ)/(2π r ε₀), assuming it's a long cylinder of linear charge density λ. Wait, but wait, if the conductor is a good conductor, it's an equipotential, so sigma would be higher where the field is stronger.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently.

The electric field inside the conductor is zero. The electric field just outside a conductor is E = σ/ε. So E is proportional to σ. So, the field is highest where σ is the highest. So which point on the conductor has the highest σ?

For a conductor, the charge is distributed to maximize the electric field. Since the conductor is a good conductor, the charge will arrange so that the field is strongest at the surface. However, in the case of a uniformly charged cylinder, the surface charge density varies with r. The surface (r=R) has the highest σ, because the field there is E = σ/ε, which is higher than for a point near the wire.

Wait, but a conductor would have charge induced on the surface. If the conductor is a long, thin wire, then the charge is spread over the surface. But in this case, the conductor is above a ground plane. So the charge on the conductor would be opposite to the ground's charge.

Wait, but in the scenario where the conductor is at a higher voltage than the ground, the charges on the conductor's surface would be negative (if ground is neutral), and the ground's surface would have positive charges. So the conductor's surface has negative charge, and the ground's surface has positive. So the electric field near the conductor (just outside) would be E = σ_conductor / ε.

So, the conductor's surface has higher σ than the ground's. So the electric field just outside the conductor's surface is higher there. Therefore, the maximum electric field occurs at the point of the conductor's surface that's farthest from the ground. Because that's where σ is the highest.

Wait, but the conductor is above the ground. So the point on the conductor closest to the ground is where the electric field is highest. Wait, no. Because as you move away from the wire, the surface charge density is higher, so E is higher. So the electric field is maximum at the farthest point from the wire, which is the point on the conductor's surface closest to the ground.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the electric field in the conductor. The electric field inside the conductor is zero, but just outside, it's E = σ / ε. Since the conductor is a good conductor, the field is higher on the surface. So the surface has the highest σ, which is at the point farthest from the wire, which is closest to the ground.

Wait, no. The conductor is above the ground, so as you go away from the wire (toward the ground), the distance between the wire and the conductor's surface increases. So the surface charge density σ is higher where the wire is closer to it. So the conductor's surface would have higher σ at the point closest to the ground. Hence, the electric field E = σ/ε would be higher at that point.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So the electric field is highest at the point closest to the ground on the conductor's surface.

Wait, wait, no. Let's think about it. The electric field just outside the conductor's surface is E = σ/ε₀. Because for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field just outside the surface is given by E = σ/(ε₀ ε_r), but since ε_r is high, the field is low.

But for a conductor with a surface charge density σ, the electric field right at the surface is E = σ/(ε₀). That's because the field just outside a conducting surface is the surface's electric field.

So, if the conductor's surface charge density σ is highest at the closest point to the wire (since the wire is closer there), then E would be highest there.

Wait, but the problem says the conductor is above the ground, which is a large conducting plane. So the distance between the conductor and the ground is uniform, perhaps? Or what's given is a high voltage between them.

Wait, the setup is a long wire (conductor) above ground, and there's a voltage between the wire and ground. So the conductor and the ground are at different potentials. So the conductor has a surface charge of opposite sign to the ground's surface, but the problem is about the electric stress in the conductor.

So, the conductor's own electric field. The electric field just outside the conductor is E = σ/(ε₀ ε_r). Since the conductor is a good conductor, ε_r is high. So E is proportional to σ. So if σ is higher on the conductor's surface, then E is higher on the surface.

But the conductor's surface charge density σ is highest where the electric field due to the wire is strongest. Because the wire's charge would cause a higher σ on the conductor's surface closer to it.

Wait, no. The conductor's surface charge depends on the geometry. For example, if the wire is a perfect conductor, the charge would be uniformly distributed on the surface of the conductor. But in reality, in a real conductor, the charges would accumulate near the surface. But if the conductor is a long thin wire, then the electric field from the wire would cause the charge on the conductor's surface to be higher near the nearest point (closer to the wire) and lower as you go away.

So the surface charge density σ varies with distance from the wire. The maximum σ is at the closest point to the wire, which is the point on the conductor's surface farthest from the ground. Because the wire is in the middle, above the ground.

So, the electric field just outside the conductor's surface is E = σ/ε₀. So, the maximum E occurs at the point where σ is highest, which is the point farthest from the ground (closest to the wire).

Wait, but the electric field is strongest where the surface charge density is highest. So the conductor's surface charge is higher at the point closest to the wire, which is the point farthest from the ground.

Ah, so the maximum electric stress (which is the electric field in the conductor) occurs at the point where the conductor is farthest from the ground.

Wait, but wait. Earlier I thought that the electric field just outside the conductor's surface is E = σ/ε₀. So the higher the σ, the higher E. So the maximum E is at the point where σ is the highest, which is the point closest to the wire (so farthest from the ground).

So the maximum E occurs at the conductor's surface point that's farthest from the ground.

Looking back at the options, option A says "the point farthest from the ground on the conductor's surface."

So the answer is A.

The problem involves a long wire composed of a smooth, round conductor running above and parallel to the ground (a large conducting plane), with a high voltage existing between the conductor and the ground. The goal is to determine where the maximum electric stress occurs in the conductor.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Electric Field Inside the Conductor**: In a conductor at electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. However, just outside the surface, the electric field is given by \( E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \), where \( \sigma \) is the surface charge density on the conductor's surface and \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space.

2. **Surface Charge Density (\( \sigma \))**: The surface charge density \( \sigma \) on the conductor's surface depends on the geometry of the conductor and the distribution of charges induced by the voltage between the conductor and the ground. For a conductor above a grounded plane, the charge on the conductor's surface is opposite in sign to the ground's surface. The surface charge density is highest where the electric field due to the conductor is strongest.

3. **Electric Field at the Conductor's Surface**: The electric field just outside the conductor's surface is proportional to the surface charge density \( \sigma \). Therefore, the maximum electric field occurs at the point where \( \sigma \) is the highest.

4. **Distribution of \( \sigma \)**: For a conductor, the surface charge density \( \sigma \) is highest closer to the conductor (i.e., near the wire) and decreases as you move away from the conductor. Thus, the maximum \( \sigma \) occurs at the point on the conductor's surface farthest from the ground (closest to the wire).

5. **Conclusion**: The maximum electric field in the conductor occurs at the point farthest from the ground on the conductor's surface, where \( \sigma \) is the highest.

- **E: The point where the conductor and ground surface meet.**  
  Incorrect, as this point is at the intersection of the conductor and the ground, not where the electric field is strongest.

- **F: The ground surface.**  
  Incorrect, as the electric field is determined by the conductor's surface charge density, not the ground's surface.

- **G: Midway between the conductor and ground.**  
  Incorrect, as the electric field decreases as you move away from the wire.

- **H: The point of the conductor farthest from the ground surface.**  
  Incorrect, as the point farthest from the ground is the point where \( \sigma \) is highest.
