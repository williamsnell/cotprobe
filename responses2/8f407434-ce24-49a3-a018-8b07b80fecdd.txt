Okay, so I've got this question about forward contracts, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question says: We have a forward contract on a non-dividend paying stock that matures in 6 months. The current stock price is $50, and the 6-month interest rate is 4% per annum. We need to find the forward price F from the options given.

Hmm, forward contracts. I remember that a forward contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a specified price (the forward price) at a certain date, in this case, 6 months from now. Since the stock doesn't pay dividends, the calculation should be straightforward.

Wait, wait. So the stock doesn't pay dividends, which probably means we don't have to account for any dividend growth or anything like that. That makes it easier.

I think the formula for the forward price when there are no dividend payments is F = S * e^(rT), right? Where S is the current stock price, r is the risk-free interest rate, and T is the time to maturity in years.

But wait, sometimes people use the simple interest formula or approximate it with a linear model. Let me think. For small interest rates and short times, maybe the continuous compounding approximation is acceptable. But in finance, usually, they use the formula that accounts for the time value of money and the interest earned.

So here, the interest rate is 4% per annum. The maturity is 6 months, which is 0.5 years. So T is 0.5.

The stock price S is $50.

So plugging into the formula: F = 50 * e^(0.04 * 0.5). Let me calculate that.

First, 0.04 * 0.5 is 0.02. So e^0.02 is approximately what? I remember that e^0.02 is about 1.020202. So 50 multiplied by 1.020202 is 51.0101.

So F is approximately $51.01. Looking at the options, option B is 51.0, which seems to match.

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes in exams, they might use the simple interest formula. Let me check that.

Simple interest would be F = S*(1 + r*T). So 50*(1 + 0.04*0.5) = 50*(1.02) = 51.0. Oh, same result. So both methods give the same answer here.

So the forward price F is $51.0, which is option B.

To determine the forward price \( F \) of a non-dividend paying stock with a 6-month maturity, we use the formula:

\[
F = S \times e^{rT}
\]

Where:
- \( S = \$50 \) (current stock price),
- \( r = 4\% \) per annum (risk-free interest rate),
- \( T = 0.5 \) years (6 months).

Substituting the values:

\[
F = 50 \times e^{0.04 \times 0.5} = 50 \times e^{0.02}
\]

Approximating \( e^{0.02} \approx 1.0202 \), we get:

\[
F \approx 50 \times 1.0202 = 51.01
\]

Thus, the forward price is approximately \$51.0, which corresponds to option **B**.
