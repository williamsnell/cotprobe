Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the sum of squares from 21 squared up to 40 squared. The formula given is for the sum from 1 squared to n squared, which is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. Hmm, I remember this formula is used in some math problems. But here, I need to find the sum starting from 21, so I can't just plug in n as 40 and subtract the sum from 1 to 20, right?

Wait, let me think. If I have the sum from 1 to 40, and I subtract the sum from 1 to 20, I'll get the sum from 21 to 40. That makes sense because the difference between the two ranges would be the middle part. So, I should calculate both sums and subtract.

First, let me write down the formula for the sum up to n:

Sum = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.

So, for the sum up to 40, I'll plug in n=40.

Sum_40 = 40 * 41 * (2*40 + 1) / 6.

Let me compute that step by step. 

2*40 is 80, plus 1 is 81. So, that gives me 40 * 41 * 81.

Hmm, multiplying those numbers. Let's compute 40 * 41 first. 40*40 is 1600, plus 40 is 1640. Then, 1640 * 81. Wait, that's a big number. Maybe I should break it down.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute 40 * 41 first, which is 1640, then multiply by 81.

Wait, 1640 * 80 is 131,200, and 1640 * 1 is 1,640. Adding them gives 132,840. Then, dividing that by 6: 132,840 / 6 equals 22,140. Wait, 6*20,000 is 120,000. 132,840 -120,000 is 12,840. 6 * 2,000 is 12,000, so 12,840 -12,000 is 840. 6*140 is 840. So total is 20,000 + 2,000 + 140 = 22,140.

Wait, but I'm not sure I did that correctly. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each step again:

40 *41 is 1640. Then, 1640 *81: 1640 *80 is 131,200; 1640 *1 is 1,640. So 131,200 +1,640 = 132,840. Then divide by 6: 132,840 /6. 6*22,000 is 132,000, which leaves 840. 840 /6 is 140. So total is 22,140. So Sum_40 is 22,140.

Wait, that seems a bit high but okay. Now, I need Sum_20, which is the sum from 1 to 20.

Sum_20 = 20 *21 *41 /6.

Wait, 2n+1 when n=20 is 41.

So 20 *21 is 420. 420 *41. Hmm, 420*40 is 16,800. 420*1 is 420. So 16,800 +420 = 17,220.

Divide by 6: 17,220 /6. 6*2,870 is 17,220 because 2,800*6=16,800. 2,800*6=16,800, plus 70*6=420. 16,800 +420=17,220. So 2,870.

So Sum_20 is 2,870.

Now, the sum from 21 to 40 is Sum_40 - Sum_20.

That's 22,140 -2,870. Let me compute that. 22,140 -2,000 is 20,140. Then subtract 870: 20,140 -870 = 19,270.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 19270, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Sum_40: 40 *41 is 1640. 2*40+1=81. 1640*81= let me compute again step by step. 1640 *80= 131,200; 1640 *1=1,640. 131,200 +1,640=132,840. Divided by 6: 132,840 รท6=22,140. Yes, that's correct.

Sum_20: 20*21=420. 2*20+1=41. 420*41=17,220. 17,220 รท6=2,870. Correct.

So 22,140 -2,870=19,270, which is option J.

Wait, but looking at the options again. Let's check: option J is 19270, which matches what I got.

Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the subtraction. 22,140 minus 2,870.

Yes, 22,140 minus 2,000 is 20,140. Then subtract 870: 20,140 - 800=19,340; 19,340 -70=19,270. Correct.

So the answer is J: 19270.

The sum from 21 to 40 can be found by subtracting the sum from 1 to 20 from the sum from 1 to 40 using the given formula. After calculating both sums and subtracting, the result is 19,270.
