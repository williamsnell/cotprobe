Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the setup is that there's an observer O who's at rest mid-way between two light sources. The sources are at x=0 and x=10 meters. Both sources flash simultaneously, according to O. Now, there's another observer O' who's moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis. From O's perspective, O' is moving, so the sources should appear to flash at different times to O'.

The problem states that according to O', one source flashes 13 nanoseconds (ns) before the other. I need to find the speed of O' relative to O. The options are given, but I'm supposed to figure it out without the actual options, but wait, the user provided the options. Let me see... the options are A to J, with speeds like 0.60c, 0.10c, etc.

Hmm, I remember that when a source is moving relative to an observer, different observers will see different timings of events. This is related to the concept of time dilation in special relativity, but wait, no, that's for length contraction. Oh, right, the key here is the relativistic velocity addition and time dilation.

Wait, but in this case, since the two events are simultaneous in the rest frame (O's frame), but O' measures a time difference. So, the scenario is about the relativity of simultaneity. In O's frame, both sources are at the same time, but O' measures one as happening earlier. So, O' is moving relative to O, and due to the high speed, the two events appear to happen out of sync.

In O's frame, the two sources are at x=0 and x=10m, each emitting a flash at t=0. So the events are (x1=0, t1=0) and (x2=10, t2=0) in O's frame.

Now, in O', the source at x=0 is moving towards O' (since O' is moving towards it) and the other is moving away from O'. Wait, not necessarily; depending on the direction. Let me think: if O' is moving in the positive x-direction, then the source at x=0 is approaching O', and the other (x=10) is moving away. So O' will see the source coming towards him as faster and the one moving away as slower.

Wait no, because the sources are moving, their speeds would affect the time between the flashes as observed by O'. Since the source in front is moving towards O' and the one behind is moving away, their velocities would cause the events to be time-dilated. But since O' is moving relative to O, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the transformation of events in the two frames.

Wait, but in O's frame, the two events are simultaneous. So the time difference in O' is due to the source separation and the relative motion.

I think the approach here is to use the Lorentz transformation for time. The formula for time transformation when moving at velocity v relative to the original frame is:

t' = γ (t - (v x) / c² )

But wait, in this case, the two events are at x=0 and x=10m in O's frame, and both are at t=0. So I can compute the time in O' frame for each event.

Let me denote O' as moving at velocity v relative to O. The velocity v is positive if O' is moving in the positive x-direction, say.

So, for the first source at x=0, t=0 in O's frame.

t'_1 = γ (0 - (v * 0)/c² ) = 0

For the second source at x=10 m, t=0 in O's frame.

t'_2 = γ (0 - (v * 10) / c² ) = - γ (10 v) / c²

So the time difference in O' frame is t'_2 - t'_1 = - γ (10 v) / c².

The problem states that this time difference is 13 ns. So,

- γ (10 v) / c² = 13e-9 seconds.

Wait, but time difference in O' is 13 ns, which is 13e-9 s. So,

γ * (10 v) / c² = 13e-9.

Wait, because the time difference is negative but the magnitude is 13 ns. So the absolute value is 13e-9.

So, the equation is:

γ (10 v) / c² = 13e-9.

I can write γ as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

(10 v) / (c² sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) = 13e-9.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. But maybe I can make a substitution to simplify. Let me let u = v/c. Then v = u c, and v²/c² = u².

So substituting,

10 * u c / (c^2 * sqrt(1 - u^2)) ) = 13e-9.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

10 u c / (c² sqrt(1 - u²)) ) = 10 u / (c sqrt(1 - u²)) ) = 13e-9.

Wait, so:

10 u / (c sqrt(1 - u²)) ) = 13e-9.

Multiply both sides by c sqrt(1 - u^2):

10 u = 13e-9 * c sqrt(1 - u^2).

Hmm, but this still seems tricky. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

(10 u)^2 = [13e-9 * c sqrt(1 - u^2)]^2.

Which gives:

100 u² = (13e-9 * c)^2 * (1 - u²).

Let me compute (13e-9 * c)^2. Since c is 3e8 m/s, 13e-9 * 3e8 = 13 * 3e-1 = 39e-1 = 3.9. So,

(13e-9 * c)^2 = (3.9)^2 = 15.21.

Wait, no, wait: 13e-9 * c = 13e-9 * 3e8 m/s.

13e-9 * 3e8 = (13 *3) * (1e-9 * 1e8) ) = 39 * 1e-1 = 3.9.

So (13e-9 c )^2 = (3.9)^2 = 15.21.

So Equation becomes:

100 u² = 15.21 (1 - u² )

Expanding:

100 u² = 15.21 - 15.21 u².

Bring all terms to one side:

100 u² + 15.21 u² - 15.21 = 0.

(100 +15.21) u² =15.21.

So 115.21 u² = 15.21.

u² = 15.21 / 115.21.

Calculating that: 15.21 ÷ 115.21 ≈ 0.1317.

So u = sqrt(0.1317) ≈ 0.363 (since sqrt(0.1317) is approximately 0.363).

So u = 0.363 c.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 15.21 divided by 115.21.

15.21 / 115.21 = (15.21) / (115.21) = approximately 0.1317.

Ah, so u squared is 0.1317, so u is sqrt(0.1317) ≈ 0.363.

Wait, 0.363 squared is approximately 0.1318, which matches.

So u is approximately 0.363 c.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.36c. So that's the closest.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-calculate u squared:

u² = 15.21 / 115.21 = approx 0.1317.

√0.1317 = approx 0.363.

So 0.363 c would be option G.

Wait, but I should also consider that I squared both sides. Let me see... no, because when I squared, I got u = sqrt( (15.21)/(115.21) ) c.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure that the substitution is correct.

Wait, earlier I set u = v/c. So u is the fraction of the speed of light that O' is moving at.

In the equation:

10 u / (c sqrt(1 - u^2)) ) = 13e-9.

Wait, let me compute 10 u / (c sqrt(1 - u²) )).

Which is 10 * (u/c) / sqrt(1 - u^2) ) = 10 u / (c sqrt(1 - u^2)).

But c is 3e8 m/s, so:

10 u / (3e8 m/s * sqrt(1 - u²) )) = 13e-9 s.

So,

(10 u ) / (3e8 * sqrt(1 - u²) ) = 13e-9.

Multiply both sides by 3e8 * sqrt(1 - u²):

10 u = 13e-9 * 3e8 * sqrt(1 - u^2).

13e-9 *3e8 is (13 *3) * 1e-9 * 1e8 = 39e-1 = 3.9.

So 10 u = 3.9 * sqrt(1 - u²).

Wait, that's different from what I had earlier. Oh wait no, no! Wait a second, I think I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, earlier I wrote 10 u = 3.9 sqrt(1 - u^2). But wait, 10 u = 3.9 * sqrt(1 - u^2).

Wait, but wait, no. Let me go back.

Wait, the original equation after substitution:

10 u/(c sqrt(1 - u²)) = 13e-9.

But c is 3e8 m/s. So,

10 u = 13e-9 * 3e8 * sqrt(1 - u²) )

Wait, 13e-9 *3e8 = 3.9e-1 *3e8 = 3.9e-1 * 3e8 ?

Wait, no, 13e-9 *3e8 = (13 *3) * 1e-9 * 1e8 = 39 * 1e-1 = 3.9.

So,

10 u = 3.9 * sqrt(1 - u^2) )

So,

10 u = 3.9 sqrt(1 - u^2)

Square both sides:

(10u)^2 = (3.9)^2 (1 - u² )

100 u² = 15.21 (1 - u² )

100 u² = 15.21 - 15.21 u²

Bring terms together:

100 u² +15.21 u² =15.21

115.21 u² =15.21

u² = 15.21 /115.21 ≈ 0.1317.

So u ≈ sqrt(0.1317) ≈ 0.363.

So u = 0.363 c.

Looking at the options, 0.36c is option G.

Wait, but in the options, option G is 0.36c, so the correct answer should be G.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relativistic effects on the timing of events observed by two observers. Observer O is at rest midway between two light sources at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 10 \, \text{m} \), while observer \( O' \), moving at a constant speed \( v \) parallel to the \( x \)-axis, observes the two sources to flash 13 ns apart. The goal is to determine \( v \) relative to \( c \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Time Dilation and Length Contraction**:  
   - In O's frame, both sources flash simultaneously at \( t = 0 \).  
   - In \( O' \)'s frame, the two sources are moving relative to \( O' \), causing time dilation and relative velocity effects. The observed time difference between the flash events is due to the relative motion and is given as \( \Delta t' = 13 \, \text{ns} \).

2. **Lorentz Transformation**:  
   Using the Lorentz transformation for time:
   \[
   \Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t - \gamma \frac{v x}{c^2}
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( \Delta t = 0 \) (simultaneous events in O's frame), and \( x = 10 \, \text{m} \) (distance between the sources). For the second source, \( x = 10 \, \text{m} \), while for the first source, \( x = 0 \). The time difference in \( O' \)'s frame is:
   \[
   \Delta t' = -\gamma \frac{v x}{c^2}
   \]
   Substituting \( \Delta t' = -13 \, \text{ns} \) and \( x = 10 \, \text{m} \), we get:
   \[
   13 \, \text{ns} = \gamma \frac{v \cdot 10}{c^2}
   \]

3. **Substitute \( \gamma \)**:  
   Replace \( \gamma \) with \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), let \( u = v/c \), and rewrite the equation:
   \[
   10u / (c^2 \sqrt{1 - u^2}) = 13 \, \text{ns}
   \]
   Simplify by noting \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), so:
   \[
   10u = 13 \cdot 3 \cdot \sqrt{1 - u^2}
   \]
   \[
   10u = 39 \sqrt{1 - u^2}
   \]

4. **Square Both Sides**:  
   \[
   (10u)^2 = (39)^2 (1 - u^2)
   \]
   \[
   100u^2 = 1521 (1 - u^2)
   \]
   \[
   100u^2 + 1521u^2 = 1521
   \]
   \[
   2521u^2 = 1521
   \]
   \[
   u^2 = \frac{1521}{2521} \approx 0.1317
   \]
   \[
   u = \sqrt{0.1317} \approx 0.363
   \]

5. **Interpretation**:  
   \( u = v/c = 0.363 \), so \( v \approx 0.363c \). The closest option is **0.36c**.

### Conclusion:
The speed of \( O' \) relative to \( O \) is approximately \( 0.36c \), corresponding to **option G**.
