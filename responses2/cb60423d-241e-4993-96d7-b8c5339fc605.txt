Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what happens to the equilibrium price level and quantity of output when the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, given a Classical aggregate supply curve. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, I remember that the Classical model has two main curves: the Classical aggregate demand (or AD) and the Classical aggregate supply (AS). The AS curve is vertical in this model. Aggregate demand is what determines the price level and real output.

Wait, when the AD curve shifts to the right, that means people are willing to spend more at each price level. So, in the short run, an increase in AD would lead to higher prices and higher output. But wait, in the Classical model, the economy is usually at full employment in the long run. So the AS curve is vertical at potential GDP, which is the natural level of output.

So, if AD shifts right in the short run, the equilibrium moves along the AS curve. Let's see, if the AD curve shifts right without changing the AS curve, then in the short run, the equilibrium is at higher price and higher output. But in the long run, since AS is vertical, output will settle at the natural level, and price will adjust to match the higher AD. However, in this question, I think it's considering the short run or perhaps just the immediate effect.

Wait, the question says "the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right." It doesn't specify the time frame. But in the Classical model, the short run equilibrium is where AD shifts right, and the price level and output both rise. But the long run equilibrium would have output at full employment, but the price level would rise accordingly.

But wait, the question says "the equilibrium price level and the quantity of output." So, in the short run, the shift of AD to the right would cause both price and output to increase. But in the long run, output would adjust to natural level, but price would rise to match higher demand.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Aggregate demand (AD) curve represents the total demand for goods and services. If AD shifts to the right, at any given price level, the quantity demanded increases. So, in the short run, if the AS curve is vertical, the equilibrium will have higher output and higher price level. But in the long run, since AS is vertical, output will stay at natural level, but price will rise due to higher demand.

Wait, but the question is about the immediate shift without specifying time. If the shift is happening in the short run, output increases and price increases. But if it's in the long run, output stays the same and price increases because the economy adjusts.

Wait, the question is probably asking in the short run because the options don't seem to all have 'in the long run' or similar. The options are about the short run or maybe the long run? Let me look back.

The options are A through J, but the question says "the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium quantity of output." So, the options are about what will happen in equilibrium, which is the end point after any shifts or changes in the model.

Wait, the Aggregate Supply (AS) curve is vertical, so in the Classical model, the AS is vertical at full employment. So, the equilibrium in the short run would be at a higher price level and higher output. But in the long run, output would stay the same (since AS is vertical), but price would adjust to the higher demand.

So, the question is a bit ambiguous. If the shift is in the short run, then both price and output increase. But if it's in the long run, output stays the same and price rises.

Wait, but the question is about the shift in the aggregate demand curve. Let me think about the AD curve. If the AD curve shifts to the right, in the short run, output increases because higher AD meets the same AS. But in the long run, the economy will adjust. So, the long run equilibrium's quantity is at natural output, but price is higher.

But the question's options are about the equilibrium in the short run or the long run, or about the shifts.

Wait, but I think the question is about the effect of a shift in AD on the short-run equilibrium. Because in the Classical model, the short-run equilibrium is determined by the intersection of AD and AS. So, a right shift in AD would lead to a higher price and higher output in the short run.

But in the long run, the economy would stay at full employment, but price would rise because the AD has shifted.

So, looking at the options, the question says the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right. It's asking what happens to the equilibrium price level and quantity of output.

So, the options include possibilities, but perhaps the question is about the short run effect. Because in the short run, the model shows that AD shifts right leads to higher price and output. So, the price level increases, and output increases.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D: Price level increases, output decreases. That doesn't fit.

Option C: Price level decreases, output increases. No, that's when AD shifts left.

Option H: Both decrease. No, that's if AD and AS shift in opposite directions.

Option J: Both increase. That's the short run.

Wait, the options are:

A: no change.

B: price up, output unchanged.

C: price down, output up.

D: price up, output down.

E: price unchanged, output down.

F: price unchanged, output up.

G: price and output down.

H: price down, output decrease.

I: price down, output unchanged.

J: price up, output up.

In the short run, AD shifts right, so E: price unchanged, output down? No, in short run, output increases.

Wait no, when AD shifts right in the short run, the equilibrium output is higher, and price is higher. So, in the short run, the answer would be the price level increases and quantity increases. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again, option F is price unchanged, output increases. No, that's not correct because the AS curve is vertical. So, if AD shifts right, in the short run, the output increases, price increases.

But none of the options (A-D) say that. Looking at the options:

Option F: price unchanged, output increases. No.

Option J: price up, output up. But that would be in the long run.

Wait, but the options don't include the long run scenario.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The question says "shifts to the right," but perhaps it's in the long run.

Wait, in the long run, the AS is vertical, so output will be at natural level (full employment). So, the equilibrium quantity will be the same as the natural level, but the price level will rise because of higher AD.

So, in the long run, price level increases, quantity stays the same. So the equilibrium quantity is unchanged, but price goes up.

But the options don't have that. Let's look:

Looking at the options, J is price up and output unchanged. So that's the long run scenario.

Wait, but the question is about the shift of AD to the right. If the shift is in the short run, then output increases and price increases. But since none of the options match that except option F and J, which don't seem to fit.

Wait, the options are:

The options are about what happens when the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right.

Wait, the correct answer must be that the price level increases and output increases. But looking at the options, do any of them have that?

Wait, looking again:

Option J: Price increases, quantity unchanged. That's the long run.

Option F: Price unchanged, output increases. That's when AD shifts left.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let's reevaluate.

In the short run, AD shifts right causes higher price and higher output.

In the long run, AD shifts right causes higher price but same output as before.

So, if the question is about the short run effect, the correct answer would be higher price and higher output. But none of the options (A-J) present that. Looking at the options again:

Option F: price unchanged, output increases. No.

Option J: price up, quantity unchanged. No.

So perhaps the question is referring to the long run.

Wait, the question says the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right.

Wait, but in the short run, the shift would cause higher price and output. So the answer would be J: price increases, output remains the same. But that's the long run.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

If the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, what happens in the short run?

- The price level increases because people are demanding more at each price level.

- Output increases because higher demand meets the short-run AS.

So in the short run, both price and output rise. But the options don't have that.

Looking at the options, none of them say that. So perhaps the question is considering the long run.

In the long run, since AS is vertical, output stays at natural level (so quantity remains same), but price level increases due to higher demand.

So the equilibrium price level increases, and output remains unchanged.

Which is option J.

But the options given are A to J, and the question is asking what happens to price level and output.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the effect of the shift on the short run.

Wait, if the shift is in the AD curve, and the AS is vertical, then in the short run, the AD shifts right, so equilibrium is at higher price and higher output. So, the short run effect would be price and output both increasing.

But the question is about which option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are not considering the long run. Let me read the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: No change.

B: Price up, output same.

C: Price down, output up.

D: Price up, output down.

E: Price same, output down.

F: Price same, output up.

G: Both down.

H: Both down.

I: Price down, output same.

J: Price up, output same.

Wait, in the long run, output is at natural level, so quantity would be same as before. Price would go up because of higher demand.

So, in the long run, the price level increases, and output is same (natural level). So option J.

In the short run, the output is higher, price higher. But no option reflects that.

Wait, but the question is about the shift—so whether it's happening in the short run or long run?

Wait, the question says "the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right." So, it's a shift, which would cause the short-run effect. But perhaps in the long run, the AS curve also shifts because, at higher prices, the economy can produce more. But in the Classical model, the AS curve is vertical; it doesn't shift with the price level. So in the long run, the AS is vertical, so the equilibrium output doesn't change.

Wait, but the question is about the short run and long run effects.

Wait, but the question says "the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right." So in the short run, the AD shifts right, leading to higher price and output. So the correct short run effect.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question expects the long run effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a situation where the AD shifts to the right, and the economy is in the short run. So the correct answer would be J, but that's the long run.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from the time frame. Let me think again.

In the short run, the shift of AD to the right would cause both price and output to increase.

But looking at the options, none of them say that. So perhaps the correct answer is J, which is the long run effect.

But I'm a bit stuck, but based on the options given, the correct answer must be J because it's the only one where price level increases and output remains the same—this is the long run effect.

When the aggregate demand (AD) curve shifts to the right in the Classical model, the equilibrium changes as follows:

1. **Short Run Effect**:  
   - In the short run, an increase in AD leads to higher prices (price level increases) and higher output (quantity of output increases).  
   - However, none of the provided options reflect this exact outcome (e.g., both price and output increasing simultaneously).

2. **Long Run Effect**:  
   - In the long run, the Classical model assumes that the aggregate supply (AS) curve is vertical at the natural level of output.  
   - With the AD curve shifting right, the equilibrium price level rises to reflect the higher demand, while the quantity of output remains at the natural level (quantity unchanged).  
   - This matches option **J**: "The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases."  

Since the options do not explicitly address the short run effect, the most consistent interpretation is that the question expects the long run effect, where the price level increases and output remains unchanged.

**ANSWER: J**
