Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it again. The question is: What is the value of 5 + 2 • 15 + (12 • 4)? And then there are several options to choose from. Hmm, I remember learning the order of operations, which is often remembered by PEMDAS—Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, first, I need to identify which parts of the equation have parentheses. Looking at the expression, I see a parenthesis around (12 • 4). So that part should be calculated first. Let me compute that: 12 multiplied by 4 is 48. So now, the equation simplifies to 5 + 2 • 15 + 48.

Next, according to PEMDAS, I should handle the multiplication. The next operation is 2 multiplied by 15. Let me calculate that: 2 times 15 is 30. Now, substituting that back into the equation, it becomes 5 + 30 + 48.

Now, I just need to perform the addition from left to right. Starting with 5 + 30, which is 35. Then, add 48 to that. So, 35 plus 48. Let me do that step by step. 35 plus 40 is 75, and then plus 8 more is 83. So the total is 83.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting over: 12 *4 is 48. Then 2*15 is 30. Then 5+30 is 35, plus 48 is 83. So yes, that seems correct.

Looking back at the options provided: A is 123, which is way too big. B is 160, which is even bigger. C is 105, D is 98, E is 78, F is 120, G is 131, H is 141, I is 153, J is 83. Oh, so I got 83, which is option J. 

But wait, I need to make sure I followed the order correctly. Did I handle the parentheses first? Yes, because the expression inside the parentheses is calculated first. Then the multiplication comes next. Then the addition. So that should be right.

So the answer should be J, 83.

The correct answer is J: 83.
