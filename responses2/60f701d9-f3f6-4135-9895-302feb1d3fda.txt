Okay, so I've got this question about the Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says: A $1,000 Treasury bill purchased for $960 with a maturity of 13 weeks. We need to find the BEY and choose the closest option from A to J.

Wait, what's BEY again? I remember it's the yield that's used to compare different Treasury bills because it adjusts the yield to a common basis, usually annualized. Oh right, because different maturities have different yields, so using BEY makes it easier to compare.

So the formula for BEY, if I recall correctly, is ( (Face Value - Purchase Price) / Purchase Price ) * (365 / Maturity in Days). Wait, but wait, let me double-check the formula. I think the formula is ( (F - P) / P ) * (365 / t ), where F is face value, P is purchase price, and t is the number of days until maturity.

Wait, let's think in terms of weeks. The bill is for 13 weeks. So 13 weeks is 91 days, right? Because 13 *7 is 91.

So plugging in the numbers: F is $1000, P is $960, t is 91 days.

So the numerator is 1000 -960 = 40. So (40 / 960) is 0.0416666...

Then multiply by (365 /91). Let me calculate that.

365 ÷91 is approximately 4.010989011... So 0.0416666 * 4.010989 ≈ 0.167.

Wait, 0.0416666 *4.010989. Let me compute that more accurately.

4.010989 is approximately 4.011.

0.0416666 *4.011 = 0.167 approximately.

Wait, 0.0416666 *4 is 0.166666, and 0.0416666 *0.011 is approximately 0.00045833. So total is about 0.167124.

So approximately 16.71% when converted to a percentage.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 16.7 percent. So that's the closest.

Wait, but another thought: did I use the correct formula? I used days as 91, which is correct because 13 weeks is 91 days. So the formula is correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up with another yield method. For example, sometimes people use 360 days instead of 365 for the denominator. Oh, but in the BEY calculation, we use actual days, so 365 is correct.

So the BEY here is approximately 16.71%, which is option G.

To determine the Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY) for a $1,000 Treasury bill purchased for $960 with a 13-week maturity, we use the formula:

\[
\text{BEY} = \left( \frac{\text{Face Value} - \text{Purchase Price}}{\text{Purchase Price}} \right) \times \left( \frac{365}{\text{Maturity in Days}} \right)
\]

1. **Numerator Calculation**: $1,000 - $960 = $40.
2. **Purchase Price**: $960.
3. **Maturity in Days**: 13 weeks = 91 days.

Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{BEY} = \left( \frac{40}{960} \right) \times \left( \frac{365}{91} \right)
\]

4. **First Part**: \( \frac{40}{960} = 0.0416667 \).
5. **Second Part**: \( \frac{365}{91} \approx 4.011 \).

6. **Multiply the Two Parts**:
   \[
   0.0416667 \times 4.011 \approx 0.1671
   \]

7. **Convert to Percentage**: \( 0.1671 \times 100 = 16.71\% \).

The closest option to 16.71% is **16.7 percent**.
