Okay, so I have this question about the structure of the spinal nerves, specifically their dorsal roots. I'm a bit rusty on my neuroscience, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what the last character of the answer is. The options are A through J, each describing different types of neuronal processes in the dorsal roots. The question is about the last character, so I need to figure out what each option ends with.

Let me recall what I know about the spinal nerves. The spinal nerves run along the back of the body, and each one is divided into two halves: the medially and laterally. The medially located nerves are called the superior sagittal cords (SSCs), and the laterally located are the inferior sagittal cords (ISCs).

Dorsal roots are the terminals of these spinal nerves, right? They're the deepest parts of each nerve and are crucial for nerve sensation. So, each nerve's root has certain neuronal processes.

I remember that the motor and autonomic neuronal processes are involved in motor functions. Motor processes control movement, like opening the mouth or breathing. Autonomic processes deal with things like heart rate and digestion. Both are important for sensation and control.

Wait, but the question is about what the dorsal roots contain. Do they have both types? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think motor and autonomic are separate processes, so maybe the answer includes both.

Looking at the options:

A: motor and autonomic
B: both autonomic and motor
C: both sensory and motor
D: sensory and autonomic
E: motor
F: only autonomic
G: no processes
H: multiple processes
I: sensory only
J: autonomic only

I think the dorsal roots contain both motor and autonomic processes. So the correct choice would be A or B. Let me think again. Motor processes are those that control movement (like muscles), and auton doesn't. So both are present. So option B says both autonomic and motor. That seems correct.

Wait, but does the question say 'contain' which processes, or 'contain any' of these? I believe the answer includes both. So option A is motor and autonomic. I think motor is one part, autonomic another. So the correct answer is B.

The question asks about the neuronal processes contained in the dorsal roots of spinal nerves. Dorsal roots are the deepest parts of the spinal nerves and are crucial for sensation. The correct answer includes both motor and autonomic neuronal processes, as motor processes control movement, and autonomic processes manage involuntary functions. 

To select the correct option, we look for one that includes both motor and autonomic processes. 

**Answer: B**
