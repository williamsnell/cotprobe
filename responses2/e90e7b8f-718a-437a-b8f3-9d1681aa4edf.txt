Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about the global aging population. Let me go through each option carefully. 

The question asks which statement is correct regarding the global aging population. The options are A through G.

First, I'll review what I know about global aging trends. I remember that many developing countries are aging faster because they have lower healthcare and living standards. In contrast, wealthy nations with better healthcare and access to medical facilities tend to age slower.

Looking at each option:

Option A: Men outnumber women in older age groups. I'm not sure about this. I think the gender ratio is more balanced historically, but in recent decades, especially in many developing countries, the number of men in older ages has increased more than women. So maybe this is correct, but I'm not certain.

Option B: The rate of increase in the median age is slower in developing countries than wealthy. That sounds correct. Because in wealthy countries, the population ages more slowly, so the median age increases less rapidly. In developing countries, the rate is higher, so the median age grows faster. So B seems correct.

Option C: The global aging population is decreasing because of advancements in healthcare. Wait, no. If advancements in healthcare make people live longer, the population would be aging more, not decreasing. So C is incorrect because it says it's decreasing, which is the opposite of what happens.

Option D: By 2050, most will be under 40. That sounds unlikely. I think the majority will be older, especially in the developing countries which are aging faster. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: Men have lower mortality rates than women over the life course. I think in many countries, including some wealthier ones, men have higher mortality rates than women. However, in developing countries, women often have lower mortality rates. So this statement doesn't account for the varying rates across different regions. So E is incorrect unless it's considering the global average, which isn't the case.

Option F: The rate of increase in median age is greater in developing than wealthy. Wait, no. Because developing countries have higher mortality rates, their median age increases more slowly. So F is incorrect.

Option G: In older age groups, men and women numbers are equal. I don't think this is correct. Men still have a slight edge, especially as age increases. So G is incorrect.

So, the correct statement is B. The rate of increase in the median age is slower in developing countries compared to wealthy ones. That makes sense because wealthy countries have better healthcare, leading to slower aging.

The correct answer is **B**. The rate of increase in the median age of populations is slower in developing countries than wealthy countries. This is because developing nations often have lower healthcare, leading to faster aging and a higher median age increase.

Answer: B
