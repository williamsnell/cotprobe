Okay, so I have this problem where I need to estimate the amount of tin in a closed tin can using differentials. The can has a diameter of 8 cm and a height of 12 cm, and the tin is 0.04 cm thick. I remember that using differentials is a way to approximate small changes, maybe in volume here. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what exactly is being asked. The question is about the tin in the can, so I'm assuming it's referring to the volume of tin used to make the can. Since the can is closed, it has a top, bottom, and sides, so I think I need to calculate the volume of tin for those parts.

Wait, but the tin is 0.04 cm thick. So I'm guessing that this is the thickness of the tin on each part of the can. So, for example, the top and bottom would each have a thickness of 0.04 cm, and the sides would have a thickness of 0.04 cm as well. But wait, no— actually, the sides are a bit more complex because they're wrapped around the can. I think the sides can be considered as a rectangle when unwrapped, but the top and bottom are circles.

So maybe the volume of tin used is the surface area of the can multiplied by the thickness of the tin. That makes sense because if you think about the tin as a thin layer covering the surface, the volume would be the surface area times the thickness. So if I can calculate the surface area of the can, and then multiply by 0.04 cm, that should give me the approximate volume of tin.

Let me write down the formula for the surface area of a closed cylindrical can. The surface area (SA) is the area of the top and bottom circles plus the area of the side (which is like a rectangle when unrolled). So SA = 2πr² (for the top and bottom) + 2πrh (for the side). Alternatively, since the top and bottom are circles, each has area πr², so together that's 2πr². Then the side is 2πr times the height h. So yes, SA = 2πr² + 2πrh.

Now, the radius r can be found from the diameter, which is 8 cm. So r = 8 cm / 2 = 4 cm. The height h is given as 12 cm. So let me compute the surface area.

Calculating each part:

Top and bottom: 2πr² = 2 * π * (4)^2 = 2 * π *16 = 32π cm².

Side: 2πrh = 2π *4*12 = 96π cm².

So total surface area SA = 32π + 96π = 128π cm².

Wait, let me check that again. 2πr² is 32π, and 2πrh is 96π, so yes, 128π cm² total.

Now, if the tin is 0.04 cm thick, then the volume of tin would be approximately the surface area multiplied by the thickness. So volume V = SA * t, where t is the thickness.

So V = 128π * 0.04 cm³.

Wait, but wait—hold on. Is that correct? Because if the thickness is very small compared to the radius and height, the approximation using differentials might be okay. Because when you have a thin layer on each surface, the volume is approximately equal to the surface area times the thickness.

But let me think about this again. The can's surface area is 128π cm², and the thickness is 0.04 cm. So the volume of tin is about 128π * 0.04 cm³.

Calculating that: 128 * 0.04 is 5.12, so 5.12 * π is approximately 5.12 * 3.1416 ≈ 16.08 cm³. Hmm, but looking at the options, 16 cm³ is option I. But let me check whether that's the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using differentials for a more precise method, but I think in this case, using the surface area approach is the same as using differentials because the differential of the volume with respect to the radius and height would involve the surface area multiplied by the thickness. So maybe the initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should model the volume of the can and then take the differential. Let me try that approach too, just to see if I get the same answer.

The volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h. The differential dV would be the change in volume due to small changes in radius and height. But in this case, we're dealing with a thick can, so perhaps using differentials isn't the best approach. Wait, but the problem says "use differentials," so maybe I should proceed with that.

But wait, the can is a closed container, so maybe the volume is not being changed much with the tin layer. So perhaps the differential approach is an approximation for the surface area.

Wait, another way to think about it is: the tin is like a thin layer around the can. So the volume of tin is the surface area times the thickness. So that approach is correct, and that gives about 16.08 cm³, which is approximately 16 cm³. So that would be option I.

Looking at the options, option I is 16 cm³.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations. The radius is 4 cm, correct. Surface area is 2πr² + 2πrh = 2π(4)^2 + 2π(4)(12) = 2π(16) + 2π(48) = 32π + 96π = 128π cm². Multiply that by 0.04 cm: 128π * 0.04 = 5.12π. 5.12 * 3.1416 is approximately 16.08 cm³. So that's correct.

Wait, but another thought: when the tin is on the top and bottom, is the thickness 0.04 cm on each? Or is the tin thickness 0.04 cm around the entire can? Hmm, the question says the tin is 0.04 cm thick. So the tin on the top and bottom is 0.04 cm thick, and the tin on the sides is 0.04 cm thick as well.

Wait, let me think. If the tin is 0.04 cm thick, when you make the can, the top and bottom are each made of a thin layer of tin 0.04 cm thick. The sides are also a thin layer of tin 0.04 cm thick. So the total volume is indeed the surface area multiplied by 0.04 cm.

But another approach: perhaps model the can as a surface and consider the differential. If I model the can as a function, then the volume change is dV = (2πr h + 2πr²) dr, where dr is the change in radius or the thickness. But in this case, I think treating the can as a surface and considering the tin as a thin layer, so the volume is approximated by the surface area times the thickness.

Wait, but the surface area includes the top and bottom. The top and bottom contribute to the surface area, so each has an area of πr², so two of them make 2πr², and the sides make 2πrh. So yeah, that's correct.

So I think the correct answer is 16 cm³, which is option I. But wait, let me look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 18

B:22

C:10

D:20

E:24

F:26

G:14

H:12

I:16

J:30

So option I is 16, which is what I got. So the answer should be I, which is 16 cm³.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the surface area. With radius 4 cm, height 12 cm.

Top: πr² = π*(4)^2 = 16π.

Bottom: same, another 16π.

Sides: 2πrh = 2π*4*12 = 96π.

Total surface area: 16π +16π +96π = 128π cm².

Multiply by thickness 0.04 cm: 128π * 0.04 = 5.12π.

5.12 * 3.1416 ≈ 16.08 cm³. So that's correct.

Alternatively, let me compute 128 * 0.04 first: 128 * 0.04 = 5.12, and 5.12 * π is about 16.08. So yeah, 16 cm³.

So the answer is option I, 16 cm³.

To estimate the amount of tin in a closed tin can using differentials, we calculate the surface area of the can and multiply it by the thickness of the tin. The can has a diameter of 8 cm (radius \( r = 4 \, \text{cm} \)) and height \( h = 12 \, \text{cm} \). The surface area \( S \) of a closed cylindrical can is given by:

\[
S = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r h
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
S = 2\pi (4)^2 + 2\pi (4)(12) = 32\pi + 96\pi = 128\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

The thickness of the tin is \( t = 0.04 \, \text{cm} \). The volume of tin is approximately the surface area multiplied by the thickness:

\[
V = S \cdot t = 128\pi \cdot 0.04 = 5.12\pi
\]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):

\[
V \approx 5.12 \cdot 3.1416 \approx 16.08 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

Thus, the estimated volume of tin is approximately \( 16 \, \text{cm}^3 \), which corresponds to option I.
