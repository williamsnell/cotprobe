Okay, so I've got this question about communication and how an attitude becomes something else. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking what an attitude becomes when it's communicated. The options are a bunch of terms like behavior, stereotype, etc. 

Wait, I remember from my psychology class that an attitude is a mental image of oneself. So when you communicate it, it becomes a behavior. Like, if someone says they like coffee, their attitude is that they like coffee, and when they communicate it, they actually drink coffee, which is their behavior. 

So the options are A: behavior, which seems to fit. Let me make sure. The other options might not be correct. For example, B is a stereotypeâ€”no, that's a type of belief that's too broad. C is a point of view, but that's more like a belief, not necessarily an attitude. D is an opinion, which is more personal but not necessarily the result of communication. E is a principle, which is a general rule, not the outcome of an attitude. F is a value, which refers to a principle or belief, similar to E. G is a belief, which doesn't change as a result of communication. H is a theory, which is a set of explanations, more about how things work. I is a fact, which is an assertion, not a belief or attitude. J is a perception, which is how you see things, not necessarily a change.

So the best answer should be A: a behavior. That makes sense because when an attitude is communicated, it's transformed into the actual behavior. Like, if someone's attitude is that they support environmental conservation, they'll take action, turning their belief into a behavior.

The correct answer is A: A behavior. When an attitude is communicated, it becomes the actual behavior.
