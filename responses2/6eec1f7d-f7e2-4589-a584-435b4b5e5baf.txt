Question:

A screenwriter had just finished a screenplay for a romantic comedy. After reading the screenplay, a movie studio decided to option the screenplay for production. A lawyer for the movie studio negotiated an agreement with the screenwriter whereby the movie studio would pay the screenwriter $5,000 for the rights to the screenplay, and 10 percent of the gross receipts earned by the distribution of the movie, should the studio decide to film the screenplay. Both sides signed the agreement. Two weeks later, the screenwriter was at a birthday party for a close friend when she discovered she had forgotten to purchase a gift for her friend. She quickly grabbed a piece of paper and wrote on it:"I promise that my friend is entitled to 5 percent of the proceeds I will receive for the distribution of the movie to be made from my screenplay. "The screenwriter then signed the paper, placed it in an envelope, and handed it to the friend. The promise to pay 5 percent of the proceeds to the friend may best be interpreted as a (an)

Options:

A: conditional assignment.
B: non-binding agreement.
C: legal gift.
D: contractual obligation.
E: gratuitous assignment of future rights.
F: binding promise.

Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about contracts and what a screenwriter's promise is. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that a screenwriter signed a promise to pay 5% of the distribution proceeds to her friend. But wait, she signed it, and then the friend comes to see she forgot to buy a gift for her friend. So the screenwriter wrote on a paper, saying she'll give 5% to her friend. That seems like the friend is agreeing to get a part of the money they'd get for the screenplay. 

I think I need to figure out what kind of contract this is. Let me recall the types of contracts. There are various kinds like conditional warranties, customary duties, gifts, non-wIT, etc. 

The screenwriter wrote a promise to give 5% of the proceeds. But wait, she's the one who signed the paper. So she's making a promise to give a portion of the proceeds to her friend. But is this a legal gift? Or something else?

I remember that a legal gift is when someone gives away some property with the intention to take it back later. But here, the screenwriter is making a promise to give a portion of the proceeds, not to take it. So that's more like a contract, not a gift.

Wait, the screenwriter wrote on the paper, but didn't sign it. Oh, wait, the question says she signed the paper, so in that case, the act of writing and signing would be the signature, right? So the promise is a contract between the screenwriter and her friend.

Now, what kind of contract is a gift? A legal gift is more about giving property with the intent to take it back. For example, if someone gives you a car and you promise to return it, that's a gift. But in this case, the screenwriter is giving a portion of the proceeds, which is money, not property. So it's more like a contract where the screenwriter is agreeing to give money to her friend.

So the question is, what type of contract is a screenwriter giving 5% of the gross receipts (proceeds) to a friend? That's a contract, but I think it's a conditional contract because the amount depends on the outcome of the distribution. So the screenwriter's promise is conditional on the distribution's success. She's only giving 5% if the distribution proceeds as agreed.

But I'm not sure if it's a conditional assignment or an equitable gift. Alternatively, maybe it's a contract, which would fall under a broader category.

Wait, another thought: an equitable gift is when someone gives away property with the intent to take it back. So if the screenwriter gives 5%, that would fit that. But in this case, the screenwriter is not taking the money; she's giving a portion. So that's a gift, but not a legal gift, because the money is not property she's giving away herself. It's the distribution proceeds, which the studio gets. 

Alternatively, it's a conditional contract. The screenwriter is agreeing to a certain amount only if a condition is met. So the screenwriter has to ensure that the distribution proceeds are made, and if they're, she gives 5%, if not, maybe she doesn't.

Wait, but the screenwriter signed the paper, so the promise was made to her friend. So the screenwriter's promise is a contract. But the screenwriter's condition is whether the distribution proceeds meet the studio's agreement. But this is a non-wIT (non-warrantied interest) because the screenwriter is making a promise, not a condition.

Alternatively, the screenwriter's promise is a contract, which is option H, but wait, the options don't include that. Wait, the options are A to J, including several types.

Wait, looking back at the options, option F is "binding promise." That's what I think this is. Because a binding promise is a contract where one party agrees to do something under specific terms, and the other party agrees to do the agreed thing. So the screenwriter's promise to give 5% is a binding promise.

But wait, another option is option F. So let me think again. The screenwriter made a promise to give a portion of the proceeds, and that's a contract between two parties. So that's a binding contract, which is a binding promise. So the answer should be F: binding promise.

But wait, what about the fact that she signed the paper? Because a promise to give a portion of the proceeds is a contract, but does the screenwriter's promise have to be irrevocable? Or is it a conditional contract, which would be a conditional assignment?

Alternatively, maybe the screenwriter's promise is a non-wIT because it's a condition based on the distribution proceeding. So the screenwriter's promise is a conditional contract, which would be an assignment, but perhaps more accurately, it's a conditional agreement.

Wait, the question says that the screenwriter signed the paper, so the promise is definite. So it's a contract. So the options are either a binding promise (F) or a conditional assignment (A).

But wait, the screenwriter's promise is a contract because she agrees to give a portion of the proceeds. So that's a contract between two parties. So the answer is F: binding promise.

Wait, but another thought: I thought the screenwriter may have been given a gift, which is not a legal gift. So the screenwriter didn't give the friend a gift, but she's making a promise to give something in exchange. So that's a contract, so option F.

Wait, but wait, option H is "equitable lien," which is when someone takes property with the intent to return it. That's not applicable here because she's not taking the money; she's giving a portion.

Another angle: the screenwriter's promise is a contract. So the correct answer is F: binding promise.

But then I remember that the screenwriter's promise is a conditional contract because it's only going to happen if the distribution proceeds. So it's a conditional agreement. But the options don't have that as an option. Looking at the options: option A is conditional assignment, which would be the case if the screenwriter assigns her promise to someone else, but here she just made the promise to her friend, so it's not an assignment.

Wait, no, the screenwriter made the promise, so the friend is the receiver. So the screenwriter's promise is a contract, which is F.

Alternatively, another thought: is it a gift? Because the screenwriter gave a portion of the proceeds, which are the distribution proceeds. So she's giving a portion in exchange for the right to take it back later. That's a gift. But wait, in this case, the screenwriter is not taking the money; she's giving a portion. So it's a contract, not a gift.

So the correct interpretation is that it's a binding promise, which is F.

The screenwriter's promise to give 5% of the gross receipts to her friend is a binding promise. This is because it is a definite and agreed-upon agreement between the screenwriter and her friend, involving a mutual exchange of property with the intent to transfer the property's title. The terms of the agreement are clear, and the parties have agreed to follow them. Therefore, the best interpretation is that it is a binding promise.

Answer: F
