Okay, so I've got this question about accounting for unemployment claims. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that Boca Co. has to decide whether to reimburse the state for actual unemployment claims or pay 3% of eligible wages. They chose to reimburse. Now, they want to know the accrued liability for the year-end balance sheet.

First, I need to understand the definitions. The eligible gross wages are the first $15,000 each employee earned in the year. So for each employee, it's $15k.

Boca has four employees, each earning $20k. Wait, but each employee's eligible wages are only $15k. So each employee's eligible would be $15,000, right? Because that's the first $15k they earned.

Now, the question says that actual unemployment claims are 2% of eligible. So the cost to the state would be 2% of each employee's eligible. Let me compute that.

Each employee's 2% is 0.02 * 15,000 = $300. So four employees would be 4 * 300 = $1,200. Wait, but wait—the state is directly reimburseing, meaning the company doesn't pay the state, so the state's liability is the amount the company would have paid. So the company's liability is the amount they are not reimbursing. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says the state may reimburse the state for actual unemployment claims or pay 3% of eligible. So the state is paying 2% for each eligible. So the company is choosing to reimburse, meaning they are not paying it. So the state's liability is the amount that would have been paid, but since the company is reimbursing, the company's liability is the amount it has to pay instead.

Wait, no. The problem defines "accrued liability for unemployment claims" which I think refers to the amount the company owes. So if the state says they will reimburse, then the company doesn't have to pay it, so the liability is the amount the company would have to pay. Wait, no. Let me think again.

No, wait, the company is reimbursing the state. So the state is paying 2% of the eligible wages. That's the amount the state is going to pay. So the company is responsible for that amount. Because if the state pays 2%, then the company has to pay 2% as well? Wait, no. Wait, the question says: "Boca may reimburse the state directly for actual unemployment claims or pay 3% of eligible gross wages." So, the state can either take the actual claims (2%) or pay 3% on eligible. So if they choose to reimburse, the state is going to pay 2% of the eligible.

So the company is not reimbursing, but is instead responsible for the amount that would have been paid by the state. So the liability is the amount the state is going to pay, which is 2% of each employee's eligible. Since each employee's eligible is $15k, 2% is $300 per employee. With four employees, that's 4 * 300 = $1,200. So the accrued liability is $1,200. So the company's liability for the year is $1,200.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the terminology. The question says, "What amount should Boca report as accrued liability for unemployment claims in its year-end balance sheet?" Accrued liability refers to the amount owed at the end of the period. So since the state is paying 2%, the company is responsible for that amount. Because if the state pays 2%, the company isn't being reimbursed, so it's the amount that's still owed to the state. So the liability is $1,200.

Looking at the options, option A is $1,200. So the correct answer is A.

To determine the accrued liability for unemployment claims, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Eligible Gross Wages**: Each employee's eligible gross wages are defined as the first $15,000 earned. Since each employee earned $20,000, the eligible wages per employee are $15,000.

2. **Actual Unemployment Claims**: The state will reimburse the company for 2% of eligible wages. For each employee, this amounts to 2% of $15,000, which is $300. 

3. **Total Liability for Four Employees**: With four employees, the total liability is calculated as 4 × $300 = $1,200. This represents the amount the company is responsible for, as the state is directly paying it.

4. **Conclusion**: The accrued liability for unemployment claims is $1,200, which corresponds to option A.
