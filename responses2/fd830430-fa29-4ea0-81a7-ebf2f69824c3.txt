Okay, so I've got this physics question about forces on a man in an elevator. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the action-reaction force pair to the man's weight. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the man is standing on a platform scale in an elevator that's moving upward and speeding up. So, the elevator is accelerating upwards. When an object accelerates, there's a net force acting on it, which comes from various forces like gravity, the scale, and the elevator's tension.

Wait, forces come in action-reaction pairs. So the forces on the man must be balanced or unbalanced in some way. The man's weight is the force due to gravity pulling him down. His weight is mg, where m is his mass and g is acceleration due to gravity. Now, the elevator is accelerating upwards, so there must be an additional force pushing him upwards.

In this scenario, the scale is what measures the normal force. The scale pushes up on the man, and that's equal to his apparent weight. So the normal force (N) is greater than mg because the elevator is accelerating upward. 

The forces acting on the man are: the force of gravity (mg) downward, the normal force (N) upward, and perhaps the tension from the elevator cable, but I think the elevator cable is part of the normal force.

Wait, the normal force is the force the scale exerts on the man. So the action-reaction pair for the man's weight would be the force the scale exerts on him. But wait, the man's weight is mg, which is the force of gravity on him. So the action-reaction pair for that force would be the force the scale exerts on him, which is the normal force. 

So action-reaction pairs are always for equal and opposite forces. So if the man's weight is mg (force of gravity), then the action-reaction pair would be the force the scale exerts on him, which is N (the normal force).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is the force of the scale on the man. That's N, which is the action-reaction pair for mg (the weight). So that's the force. 

But wait, the question is about the action-reaction pair to the man’s weight. The man's weight is mg, which is the gravitational force, so the action-reaction pair is the force the scale exerts on the man, which is the N. So the pair is (N, mg), but wait, the action-reaction pairs are for each other. So the force of the scale on the man is N, and the force of the man on the scale is mg, but that's the opposite. No, wait, action-reaction pairs are mutual and opposite. So when the man's weight (mg) is the force acting on him, the reaction is the force the scale exerts on him, which is N.

Wait, no. The action-reaction pair for the man's weight (which is mg) would be the force exerted by the scale on the man. So the action is the force from the scale on the man, which is N. Then the reaction is the force from the man on the scale, which is mg. But the question is about the action-reaction pair to the man’s weight. So the force that the scale exerts on the man is N, and the force with which the man is exerted by the scale is mg. Since the question is about the pair to the man’s weight, the force is N.

Looking at the options, option A is the force of the scale on the man, which is N. So the action-reaction pair is (N, mg) but wait, no. The force of the scale on the man is N, which is the action. The reaction is the force of the man on the scale, which is mg. But the question is about the force on the man, which is N.

Wait, the question is phrased: "The action-reaction force pair to the man’s weight." So what is the action-reaction pair for the man's weight. The man's weight is mg, which is the force of gravity on him. The action-reaction pair for mg is the normal force, which is the force the scale exerts on him. So the action is the force of the scale on the man (N), the reaction is the force of the man on the scale (mg). But the question is about the force pair to the man's weight. So the force the man is exerted on by the scale is the reaction to his weight. Wait, no. The man's weight is mg, which is acting on the man. The force pair is the scale's force (N) on the man, and the man's weight on the scale. 

Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled up. Let's think again: The forces acting on the man are:

1. His weight (mg) downward.
2. The force from the scale (N) upward.

These two are the action-reaction pair. So the man's weight is mg, and the force the scale exerts on him is N, which is the action-reaction pair. So the action-reaction pair to the man's weight is the force of the scale on him, which is N. So the correct answer is A: The force of the scale on the man.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is the force of the scale on the man, which is N. So the action-reaction pair for the man's weight is A. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but another thought. The question asks for the force pair to the man’s weight. The man's weight is mg, so the action-reaction pair would be the force the scale applies on him, which is N.

So the correct answer is option A.
</think>

The question asks for the action-reaction force pair to the man’s weight. The man’s weight is the force due to gravity, which is \( mg \), acting downward. The action-reaction pair for this force is the force exerted by the scale on the man, which is the normal force \( N \) upward. This pair is mutual and opposite: the force of the scale on the man is \( N \), and the force of the man on the scale is \( mg \). 

The question specifically asks for the force pair to the man’s weight, which is \( N \). Among the options provided, the force of the scale on the man is option A.
