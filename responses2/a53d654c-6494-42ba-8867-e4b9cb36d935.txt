Okay, so I have this problem about a piano that's being bought on an installment plan. I need to find both the monthly installment and the total cost. Hmm, let me break it down.

The piano is $1250, and there's a 4.5% tax on it. Wait, so I should calculate the tax first. 4.5% of 1250. Let me do that: 1250 * 0.045 equals how much? 1250 * 0.04 is 50, and 1250 * 0.005 is 6.25, so adding them gives 56.25. So total with tax is 1250 + 56.25 = $1306.25.

Next, the payment is done through an installment plan with a down payment of 10% of the cash value. Wait, cash value here—oh, maybe cash value refers to the price after tax? Or is the cash value the original price before tax? The problem says the piano was priced at $1250, which includes tax. So maybe the cash value is $1250. Or perhaps the cash value refers to the original price, which is $1250. But I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, the problem says the down payment is 10% of the cash value. So the cash value is the price after tax. So the cash value is $1306.25. So 10% of that is $130.625. So the down payment is $130.625.

That means the balance to be paid in installments is the total price minus down payment. So 1306.25 - 130.625 = $1175.625. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because 10% of 1306.25 is 130.625, so the balance is 1306.25 - 130.625 = 1175.625? Wait, no, that can't be right because 10% of 1250 is 125, but here it's 10% of 1306.25. So correct, 10% is 130.625, so the balance is 1306.25 - 130.625 = 1175.625.

Wait, that's 1175.625, but I think I might have messed up this part. Because sometimes, cash value refers to the original price before tax. But the problem says the piano was priced at $1250, which includes tax. So the cash value, perhaps, is the pre-tax price, which is $1250. So the down payment would be 10% of $1250, which is $125. So then the balance is 1306.25 - 125 = $1181.25.

Wait, but the problem says the cash value is 10% of the cash value. Maybe the cash value here is the pre-tax price, which is $1250, and the cash value refers to the price after tax. So perhaps it's better to think that the cash value is the amount to be paid after tax, which is $1306.25. So 10% of that would be the down payment.

So down payment = 0.10 * 1306.25 = 130.625. Balance to be paid in installments is 1306.25 - 130.625 = 1175.625.

Wait, but then the problem says the payment is done on an installment plan with 18 months. So the balance is 1175.625, which will be paid over 18 months. So first, there's a service charge of 12% added to the unpaid balance. So the total amount to pay is 1175.625 plus 12% of that.

So let's calculate the service charge: 1175.625 * 0.12 = ?

1175.625 * 0.1 = 117.5625
1175.625 * 0.02 = 23.5125
Adding them gives 117.5625 +23.5125 = 141.075. So total service charge is $141.075. So the total amount to pay for the installment plan is 1175.625 + 141.075 = 1316.70.

Wait, but wait—I think I made a mistake in the order. The problem says the service charge is added to the unpaid balance. So the unpaid balance is 1175.625, so adding 12% of that to that amount gives the total amount to be paid.

So 1175.625 * 1.12 = ?

Let me calculate that:

1175.625 * 1.12:

First, 1175.625 * 1 = 1175.625

1175.625 * 0.12 = 141.075

So 1175.625 + 141.075 = 1316.70.

So the total amount paid for the installment plan is $1316.70.

Wait no, that's the amount to be paid after adding the service charge. So the balance is 1316.70.

Wait, but the initial total is 1306.25, then down payment is 130.625, balance is 1175.625, plus service charge of 141.075, so total payment is 1316.70.

Wait, but perhaps I should think of the total amount to pay as the sum of the down payment and the installment plan payments. Let me clarify the problem. The problem says the piano was purchased with an installment plan, with a down payment and 18 months to pay. The question is about the monthly installment and the total cost.

Wait, perhaps the way to model this is that the total cost is the sum of the down payment and all the monthly installments. But I'm a bit confused. Let me re-read the question.

The question is: What was the monthly installment? What was the total cost of the piano?

So, the process is: you pay a down payment, then each month you pay an installment. The total is the sum of down payment plus all installments, which equals the total amount paid in installments plus the service charge.

Wait, no, the problem states that the payment is done through an installment plan with a down payment of 10% of the cash value, with 18 months. So the down payment is 10% of the cash value, and the rest is paid in installments. The service charge is added to the unpaid balance.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as:

Total price after tax is $1306.25.

Down payment is 10% of the cash value (which is $1306.25), so 130.625.

Balance before service charge is 1306.25 - 130.625 = 1175.625.

Then, service charge is 12% added to this balance: 12% of 1175.625.

Which is 1175.625 * 0.12 = 141.075. So total to be paid is 1175.625 + 141.075 = 1316.70.

Wait, but the problem says that the payment is done through the installment plan. So the 1316.70 is the total amount paid over the 18 months. So each month's installment is 1316.70 divided by 18.

1316.70 / 18 = let's calculate.

18 x 70 = 1260. 1316.70 - 1260 = 56.70. 56.70 / 18 = 3.166666...

So approximately $73.1666 per month.

So the monthly installment is approximately $73.17.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the problem differently. Let's think about the total cost including tax and service charge.

Wait, perhaps the process is:

1. Calculate the total price after tax: 1250 * 1.045 = 1306.25.

2. Down payment is 10% of 1306.25, which is 130.625.

3. The remaining balance is 1306.25 - 130.625 = 1175.625.

4. Then, a service charge of 12% is added to the balance. So 1175.625 * 1.12 = 1316.70.

So the total amount paid in installments is 1316.70. That's the sum of the down payment and the monthly installments.

Wait, but the problem says the service charge is added to the unpaid balance. So the 12% is added to the balance after the down payment, not including the tax.

So the total to be paid is 1316.70. Wait, but that's the amount to be paid in installments plus the down payment, or is the service charge also an installment.

Wait no, the service charge is added to the balance. So the balance is 1175.625, then service charge is 12% of that, which is 141.075, making the total amount to be paid 1316.70.

But this 1316.70 is the amount paid over 18 months. So each month's payment is 1316.70 / 18 = approx 73.166, so around $73.17 per month.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see what I have.

So the monthly installment is approximately $73.17, and the total cost would be the down payment plus all installments. Wait, but the total cost is the sum of the down payment and the total installments.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, the "total cost of the piano" is the sum of the down payment and the total installments. Because the piano's original price is 1250, then tax makes it 1306.25. Then down payment 130.625, balance is 1175.625, then service charge of 141.075, making the total 1316.70, which is the total amount paid in installments. But that includes the down payment?

Wait, no, the down payment is part of the initial payment, then the installments. Let me think of the payment as:

Paying down payment (130.625) first, then 18 months of installments totaling 1316.70 - no, wait, that can't be right because the down payment is part of the initial payment. Wait, no, the total amount paid is the down payment plus the sum of all installments. Because the installments are the remaining balance plus tax, etc.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the total cost as the sum of the down payment, plus all the monthly installments.

Wait, but the problem states that the payment is done through the installment plan. So the initial down payment is part of the total cost, and the monthly payments are the installments.

Wait, no, the problem's question is: What was the monthly installment? And what was the total cost of the piano?

So total cost is the sum of the down payment plus all the monthly installments. Because the piano's price includes tax and down payment, but the installments are the rest.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: the down payment is 10% of the cash value, which is 10% of 1306.25, which is 130.625. So the down payment is $130.625.

The remaining balance is 1306.25 - 130.625 = 1175.625.

Then, 12% service charge is added to this balance: 1175.625 * 0.12 = 141.075.

So the total amount to be paid is 1175.625 + 141.075 = 1316.70.

But wait, that is the amount paid in installments. So this 1316.70 is the sum of the down payment and the monthly installments? No, the down payment was already paid upfront. So the 1316.70 is the amount paid in installments plus the service charge.

Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify.

The total amount to be paid is down payment plus all the monthly installments. But the service charge is added to the balance, which is the unpaid part of the total price. So I think the correct approach is:

Total price after tax: 1306.25

Down payment: 130.625

Balance before service charge: 1306.25 - 130.625 = 1175.625

Service charge on balance: 1175.625 * 0.12 = 141.075

Total to be paid: 1175.625 + 141.075 = 1316.70

So the total of all payments, including down payment, is 130.625 + 1316.70 = 1447.325.

Wait, but that can't be, because the options don't have that. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the 1316.70 is just the total for the installments, and the down payment is separate.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

The total cost (including tax) is 1306.25.

The down payment is 10% of that: 130.625.

The remaining balance is 1306.25 - 130.625 = 1175.625.

Then, the service charge is 12% of the balance before adding charge: 1175.625 * 1.12 = 1316.70.

So the total amount paid is down payment plus the installments, which is 130.625 + 1316.70 = 1447.325.

But none of the options have a total cost of over $1400, except option G is $1700, option D is 1422, etc. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the steps.

Alternative approach: Maybe the service charge is applied to the total amount, including tax, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, let's think again.

The piano is priced at $1250, with a 4.5% tax, so total is 1250 * 1.045 = 1306.25.

Down payment is 10% of the cash value. Wait, the cash value here is the price after tax, which is 1306.25. So 10% of that is 130.625. So down payment is $130.625.

The balance is 1306.25 - 130.625 = 1175.625.

Then, service charge is 12% of the balance, which is 12% of 1175.625. 1175.625 * 0.12 = 141.075. So the total amount paid in installments is 141.075.

Wait, but that's the service charge. So the total cost of the piano is the sum of the down payment and the installments plus the service charge?

No, wait, perhaps the total cost is the sum of the down payment plus all the monthly payments. But that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the total cost (including tax) is 1306.25, and the service charge is 12% of that, which is 156.75. So total cost after service charge is 1306.25 + 156.75 = 1463.

But the options don't have that. Let me check each option.

Looking at the options:

A: monthly installment $68.25, total $1365.

B: $70, $1400.

C: $85, $1700.

D: $71.10, $1422.

E: $75, $1500.

F: $78.90, $1578.

G: $77.50, $1550.

H: $73.40, $1448.

I: $80, $1600.

J: $65, $1300.

Wait, the options don't seem to have 1400 or 1500 except E and H.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the service charge.

Let me recalculate: balance is 1175.625. 12% of 1175.625 is 1175.625 * 0.12. Let's compute 10% is 117.5625, 20% is 235.125, so 12% is 141.075. So that's correct.

So the total amount paid in installments is 141.075. But that can't be because the down payment was already part of the initial payment.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the problem differently. Maybe the service charge is applied to the cash value, which is 10% of 1250, which is $125. Then, service charge is 12% of that $125, which is $15. So the total cost would be 1250 + 56.25 (tax) + 125 + 15 = 1416.25. But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the piano's price is 1250, which includes tax. So the down payment is 10% of 1250, which is 125. The balance is 1250 - 125 = 1125. Then, service charge is 12% of 1125, which is 135. So total cost is 1250 + 56.25 (tax) + 125 + 135 = 1516.25. No, not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the cash value is 10% of 1306.25, which is 130.625. So down payment is 130.625, balance is 1306.25 - 130.625 = 1175.625. Service charge is 12% of 1175.625, which is 141.075. So total amount paid is 1175.625 + 141.075 = 1316.70. So the monthly payments would be 1316.70 / 18 = ~73.166 per month.

So the monthly installment is approximately $73.17, and the total cost is the sum of the down payment and the installments. The down payment is 130.625, and the installments are 1316.70. So the total cost is 130.625 + 1316.70 = 1447.325.

But looking at the options, none of them have a total cost that high. The highest is G: $1700 and H: $1448.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of applying the service charge. Let me think again.

If the service charge is added to the balance, then the total amount paid in installments is 1316.70. But that's after the service charge. So the total cost of the piano (including all the installments and service charge) would be 1306.25 (original price) + 125.625 (maybe that's the installments?) No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Calculate the total price after tax: 1250 * 1.045 = 1306.25.

2. Down payment is 10% of the cash value. Wait, what's the cash value here? Cash value would be the amount you can spend after tax without considering tax? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the down payment is 10% of the price after tax. So 1306.25 * 0.1 = 130.625. Then, the remaining balance is 1306.25 - 130.625 = 1175.625.

Then, service charge is 12% on this balance: 1175.625 * 0.12 = 141.075.

So the total amount to be paid is 1175.625 + 141.075 = 1316.70. So this is the total amount paid in installments.

Thus, the monthly installment is 1316.70 / 18 = approx $73.17.

So the monthly installment is approximately $73.17, and the total cost of the piano is the sum of the down payment and the installments. So 130.625 + 1316.70 = 1447.325, which is approximately $1447.33.

But looking at the options, option H is $1448, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is H: monthly $73.40, total $1448.

Wait, let me recalculate the number of installments. Maybe the problem is that the 18 months is the time for the total amount including the service charge.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the total amount to be paid is 1316.70, which is the sum of the down payment and the installments, but I'm getting the monthly installment as 73.17, which is about $73.17.

But the options don't have 73.17, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: Let me model the problem differently, perhaps the 18 months include the service charge.

Suppose the piano is $1250. 4.5% tax: 1250 * 1.045 = 1306.25.

Down payment is 10% of the cash value: 10% of 1306.25 is 130.625.

The remaining balance is 1306.25 - 130.625 = 1175.625.

Service charge added to this balance: 1175.625 * 1.12 = 1316.70.

So the total amount to be paid is 1316.70, which is the sum of the down payment and the installments. So the down payment is 130.625, and the installments are 1316.70 - 130.625 = 1186.075.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the total amount to be paid should include the service charge. I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the 18 months is the time taken to pay the total amount, including the service charge.

So the total amount is 1316.70, which is paid over 18 months.

So the monthly installment would be 1316.70 / 18 = 73.17.

So the monthly installment is $73.17, which is approximately $73.17.

Looking at the options, none have that exactly, except for option H: $73.40, which is close.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value.

1316.70 divided by 18:

18 * 73 = 1314.

1316.70 - 1314 = 2.70.

2.70 / 18 = 0.15.

So 73 + 0.15 = 73.15 per month.

Hmm, that's $73.15, which is closer to $73.17.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the 18 months includes the service charge.

So, the total amount is 1316.70, which is the sum of the service charge and the installments.

So the installments would be 1316.70 minus the service charge, which is 1175.625.

Wait, that can't be because 1316.70 - 1175.625 = 141.075, which is the service charge. So that's not making sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the 18 months is the time to pay the total amount, including the service charge.

So the total amount is 1316.70, which is paid over 18 months.

So the monthly installment is 1316.70 / 18 = 73.17.

So that's approximately $73.17.

Looking at the options, option H is $73.40, which is very close. Option G is $77.50, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should check the total cost as the sum of the down payment and the installments.

Down payment: 130.625.

Installments: 1316.70.

So total cost: 130.625 + 1316.70 = 1447.325, which is approximately $1447.33.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option H: $1448, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the service charge.

Wait, let me re-calculate the service charge:

Balance after down payment is 1175.625.

Service charge is 12% of that: 1175.625 * 0.12 = 141.075.

So the total amount to be paid is 1175.625 + 141.075 = 1316.70.

So the monthly installment is 1316.70 /18 = 73.17.

So this would be $73.17 per month. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the 18 months includes the service charge.

In that case, the total amount is 1316.70, which is paid over 18 months, so the monthly installment is 1316.70 /18 = 73.17.

So the answer is H: $73.40, total $1448.

Wait, but 73.17 is not matching any of the options exactly, but option H is $73.40 and total $1448, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is off because of rounding.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the total cost as the sum of the down payment, plus all the monthly installments, plus the service charge.

But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The total cost is the sum of the down payment and the installments plus the service charge.

Wait, but that would be 130.625 + 1316.70 + 141.075 = 1588.40. That's way higher than any options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me consider that perhaps the correct answer is option H: $73.40, and total $1448, which is the closest to my calculation of $73.17.

But actually, 1316.70 / 18 is 73.17, which is about $73.17, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total cost as the sum of down payment, service charge, and all installments.

But that seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the service charge is applied to the total amount, including the tax and down payment. So the total is 1306.25.

Service charge is 12% of 1306.25, which is 156.75.

So total cost is 1306.25 + 156.75 = 1463.

But this isn't an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the service charge is applied to the down payment.

Down payment is 130.625.

Service charge is 12% of 130.625, which is 15.675.

So total cost is 130.625 + 15.675 = 146.30, which is not an option.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look at the options again.

Option H: monthly installment $73.40, total $1448.

So if I calculate 1316.70 /18 = 73.17, which would be $73.17 per month.

But option H says $73.40. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total amount including service charge.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the total amount to be paid is 1316.70, which is the sum of the service charge and the installments.

So the total is 1316.70, which is paid over 18 months.

So the monthly installment is 1316.70 /18 = 73.17.

Hmm, so the options don't have this, but perhaps the closest is option H.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the service charge is 12% of the balance, which is 1175.625, so 1175.625 * 0.12 = 141.075.

So the total amount to be paid is 1175.625 + 141.075 = 1316.70.

So the monthly installment is 1316.70 /18 = 73.17.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option H: $73.40, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, 1316.70 divided by 18:

18 * 70 = 1260.

1316.70 - 1260 = 56.70.

56.70 /18 = 3.15.

So 70 + 3.15 = 73.15.

So approximately $73.15 per month.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option H: $73.40.

Hmm, but this is a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 18 months is the time to pay the total amount, which is 1316.70, so the monthly installment is 1316.70 /18 = 73.17.

Wait, but none of the options have this. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option H: monthly $73.40, total $1448.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects us to calculate the total cost as the sum of the down payment and the installments, which is 130.625 + 1316.70 = 1447.325, which is approximately $1447.33.

But this isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach. Maybe the total amount is 1316.70, which is paid over 18 months, so the monthly installment is 1316.70 /18 = 73.17, as before.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps the correct answer is option H, but this seems incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the total amount.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total amount as the sum of the down payment, the service charge, and the installments.

Wait, but that seems redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the total amount is the sum of the down payment and the service charge, plus the installments.

But that's not making sense.

Hmm, I'm stuck here. I think I'll have to choose the closest option, which is option H: $73.40, total $1448.

But I'm not confident because the calculation doesn't exactly match. So perhaps the correct answer is option H.

The correct answer is option H, with a monthly installment of $73.40 and a total cost of $1448.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Calculate the Total Price After Tax:**
   - Original price: $1250.
   - Tax rate: 4.5%.
   - Total price: $1250 * 1.045 = $1306.25.

2. **Determine the Down Payment:**
   - Down payment is 10% of the cash value (cash value = $1306.25).
   - Down payment: $1306.25 * 0.10 = $130.625.

3. **Calculate the Remaining Balance:**
   - Total price after down payment: $1306.25 - $130.625 = $1175.625.

4. **Compute the Service Charge:**
   - Service charge is 12% of the remaining balance.
   - Service charge: $1175.625 * 0.12 = $141.075.

5. **Determine the Total Amount to be Paid:**
   - Total amount = Remaining balance + Service charge.
   - Total amount: $1175.625 + $141.075 = $1316.70.

6. **Calculate the Monthly installment:**
   - Number of months: 18.
   - Monthly installment: $1316.70 / 18 ≈ $73.17.

7. **Match the Calculated Monthly Installment to the Options:**
   - Option H: $73.40 (Closest to the calculated $73.17).

Therefore, the correct answer is **Option H: $73.40, total $1448**.
