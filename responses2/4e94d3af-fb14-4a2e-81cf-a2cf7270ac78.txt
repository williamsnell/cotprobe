Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the solid angle subtended by an area on a sphere. Hmm, I remember that solid angle is a measure of how large an object appears from a certain point, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

The problem says the area is 2400 cm² and the sphere has a diameter of 1.2 meters. So first, I need to convert the diameter into radius because the formula for solid angle involves the radius. Wait, solid angle Ω on a sphere is given by Ω = A / r², where A is the area on the sphere's surface and r is the radius. Yeah, I think that's right.

Wait, but wait a second. The sphere's radius is half of the diameter. So 1.2 meters is the diameter, so radius r is 1.2/2 = 0.6 meters. Oh, right, that's 60 cm.

Now, the area A is 2400 cm². But wait, the units are in cm², and the radius is in meters. Hmm, I need to make sure the units are consistent. So 2400 cm² is equal to 0.24 m² because 1 m² is 10000 cm² (since 1 m = 100 cm, so 100^2=10,000 cm²). Oh wait, no. Wait, 2400 cm² is 2400 cm² = 0.24 m²? Wait, 1 m² is 100 cm * 100 cm = 10^4 cm². So 2400 cm² / 10,000 = 0.24 m². Right.

So now, Ω = A / r². Plugging in the numbers: A is 0.24 m², r is 0.6 m. So Ω = 0.24 / (0.6)^2. Let me calculate that.

(0.6)^2 is 0.36. So 0.24 / 0.36 = 2/3. Wait, 0.24 divided by 0.36 is the same as 24/36, which reduces to 2/3. Hmm. Wait, 0.24 / 0.36 is 0.666... which is 2/3. So Ω is 2/3 steradians.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/2, D is 1/3, C is 2/3. So the correct answer is option C?

Wait, wait, wait. Let me go through again. Oh no, wait. Oh! Wait a second, no, because the formula is Ω = A / r², so A is the area on the sphere's surface. The sphere's radius is 0.6 m, so r squared is 0.36. 2400 cm² is 0.24 m². So 0.24 / 0.36 is 2/3. So the solid angle is 2/3 steradians. So the answer should be option C, which is 2/3. So option C is the right choice.

To determine the solid angle subtended by an area of 2400 cm² on the surface of a sphere with a diameter of 1.2 m, we use the formula for solid angle:

\[
\Omega = \frac{A}{r^2}
\]

where \( A \) is the area on the sphere's surface and \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. 

1. **Convert the diameter to radius**: The diameter is 1.2 m, so the radius \( r \) is \( \frac{1.2}{2} = 0.6 \, \text{m} \).

2. **Convert the area to square meters**: The given area \( A \) is 2400 cm². Since \( 1 \, \text{m}^2 = 10,000 \, \text{cm}^2 \), we have:
   \[
   A = \frac{2400}{10,000} = 0.24 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

3. **Calculate the solid angle**: Using the formula:
   \[
   \Omega = \frac{0.24}{0.6^2} = \frac{0.24}{0.36} = \frac{2}{3} \, \text{steradians}
   \]

4. **Identify the correct option**: The solid angle is \( \frac{2}{3} \), which corresponds to option C.
