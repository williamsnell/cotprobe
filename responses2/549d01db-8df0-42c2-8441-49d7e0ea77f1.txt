Okay, so I need to figure out how long Jennifer takes to run the marathon. She's splitting it into two halves, each 13.1 miles, right? She runs the first half at 8 mph and the second at 6 mph. Hmm, I think I should calculate the time for each half separately and then add them together.

Let me start with the first half. Time equals distance divided by speed. So for the first half, the distance is 13.1 miles and her speed is 8 mph. So time1 = 13.1 / 8. Let me do that division. 13 divided by 8 is 1.625, so 1.625 hours. But wait, 0.1 of an hour is 6 minutes, so 13.1/8 is exactly 1.6375 hours. Let me double-check that: 8 * 1.6375 = 13.1, so yes.

Now the second half. Again, time = distance / speed. Distance is 13.1 miles, speed 6 mph. So time2 = 13.1 / 6. Let's calculate that. 6 goes into 13 twice (12), with 1 left over. That's 2.1666... hours. Wait, wait, 13.1 divided by 6 is 2.1833... hours. Let me check: 6 * 2.1833 is approximately 13.1. So time2 is about 2.1833 hours.

Now, adding the two times together. time1 + time2 = 1.6375 + 2.1833. Let's add them. 1 + 2 is 3. 0.6375 + 0.1833 is 0.8208. So total time is approximately 3.8208 hours. That's about 3.82 hours. Let me see the options. Option D is 3.82, so that's the answer.

To determine the total time Jennifer takes to complete the marathon, calculate the time for each half:

1. **First Half:** Time = 13.1 miles / 8 mph = 1.6375 hours.
2. **Second Half:** Time = 13.1 miles / 6 mph ≈ 2.1833 hours.
3. **Total Time:** 1.6375 + 2.1833 ≈ 3.8208 hours, which rounds to 3.82 hours.

**Answer:** D: 3.82
