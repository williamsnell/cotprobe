Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about a passage from President Harry S. Truman's speech. The question is asking which policy the speech best supports, and the options are A through H.

First, I'll try to understand the passage. The passage talks about how totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want. They spread in evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when hope of a better life dies. The president says we must keep that hope alive, and mentions that great responsibilities are placed on us by swift events. He's confident that the Congress will handle these responsibilities.

Hmm, I'm trying to remember what policies or events correspond to each of these options.

Option A: Policy of containment. I think containment was a policy by the US before the Cold War. It was about keeping the US apart from other nations to prevent spread of communism. So, maybe this speech supports the idea of containing the spread of communism.

Option B: Start of Cold War. That's after the passage, I think. The Cold War began after the end of World War II, around the late '50s to early '60s. The passage is from 1947, which was during the early Cold War. So not B.

Option C: United Nations. The passage doesn't mention the UN at all. It's more about US domestic policies. So probably not C.

Option D: Atlantic Charter. That's the Framework for International Law, which is part of the UN. Again, the passage doesn't talk about it. So D is probably not the best fit.

Option E: Creation of NATO. That happened after the Cold War ended, around 1999. The passage is from 1947, so E isn't related.

Option F: Roll-back of communism. That's more of a long-term policy, like the Cold War's end. The passage doesn't discuss that; it's more about immediate responses and responsibilities.

Option G: Majorretal principle. I remember that's the UN Security Council's policy on nuclear non-compatibility. The passage doesn't mention any nuclear issues or UN Security Council actions, so G isn't the right choice.

Option H: détente policy. That's a US foreign policy during the Cold War, aimed at preventing the spread of communism. It's called "detrimental diplomacy," which involved neutralizing Soviet forces and focusing on economic and military cooperation. The passage seems to emphasize handling responsibilities and keeping hope alive, which aligns with détente.

So, the speech is about handling responsibilities placed upon the US by events, implying that the US is taking steps to prevent communism from spreading. The détente policy is about neutralizing Soviet influence, which fits with the idea of not allowing communism to spread and instead promoting cooperation.

The speech emphasizes handling responsibilities and preventing the spread of communism, particularly through the détente policy. This policy aimed at neutralizing Soviet influence, which aligns with the speech's focus on keeping hope alive and avoiding the spread of communism. The correct answer is H.
