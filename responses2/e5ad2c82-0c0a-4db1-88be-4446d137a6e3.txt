Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about angular acceleration of a turntable. Hmm, let's think through it.

The question says the turntable is accelerated from rest to 33.3 rpm in 2 seconds. Wait, what's the formula for angular acceleration? Oh right, angular acceleration (α) is the change in angular velocity over time. So α = (ω_final - ω_initial) / t.

Since it starts from rest, ω_initial is 0. So α is just ω_final divided by time. But wait, the rpm is given, so I need to convert that to radians per second.

I remember that 1 revolution is 2π radians. And 1 minute is 60 seconds. So 33.3 rpm is 33.3 revolutions per minute. Let's compute that in radians per second.

First, 33.3 rev/min multiplied by 2π radians/rev gives 33.3 * 2π. Then divide by 60 to get per second. Let's calculate that.

33.3 * 2 is 66.6, so 66.6π radians per minute, divided by 60 gives 66.6π /60 s. Simplifying that, 66.6 divided by 60 is 1.11. So 1.11π rad/s. Wait, 1.11 multiplied by π is approximately 3.498 rad/s. Oh, wait, but 33.3 rpm is roughly 3.5 rad/s. Wait, let me check that more accurately.

Wait, 33.3 rpm is 33.3 * 2π /60. So 33.3 * 2 is 66.6, then divided by 60: 66.6 /60 = 1.11. So 1.11 * π. 1.11 * 3.1416 is about 3.498 rad/s. So approximately 3.5 rad/s.

But wait, the question says 33.3 rpm. So perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute 33.3 × 2 × π /60 more accurately.

33.3 * 2 = 66.6. 66.6 /60 = 1.11. 1.11 * π ≈ 1.11 *3.1416 ≈ 3.498 rad/s, so about 3.5 rad/s. But maybe I should use a calculator approach.

Let me think again. 33.3 is 100/3 rpm. Wait, no, 33.3 is approximately 100/3, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of exact calculation.

Wait, 33.3 is 100/3. So 100/3 rev per minute. Multiply by 2π rad per rev and divide by 60 seconds.

So 100/3 * 2π / 60 = (100 * 2π) / (3 * 60) ) = 200π/(180) = (10π)/9. Because 200/180 is 10/9. So 10π/9 rad/s.

Calculating that: π is about 3.1416, so 10 * 3.1416 = 31.416; divided by 9 is approximately 3.4907 rad/s. So approximately 3.49 rad/s.

So the final angular velocity ω is about 3.49 rad/s. The initial ω is 0 because it starts from rest. The time is 2 seconds.

So α is ω / t = 3.49 / 2 ≈ 1.745 rad/s². Looking at the options, option A is 1.74 sec^-2. That's 1.74, which is about what I calculated.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the unit conversion. Because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the units.

So 33.3 rpm is 33.3 revolutions per minute. Each revolution is 2π radians. So the angular speed in rad/s is (33.3 rev/min) * (2π rad/rev) / (60 s/min) ) = (33.3 * 2π) /60.

33.3 * 2 = 66.6. 66.6 /60 is 1.11. So 1.11 * π ≈ 3.498 rad/s. So 3.498 rad/s.

Then, α is 3.498 / 2 = 1.749 rad/s². So approximately 1.75 rad/s². Which is close to option A, which is 1.74 sec^-2. So that's the answer.

To determine the angular acceleration of the turntable, we use the formula:

\[
\alpha = \frac{\omega_{\text{final}} - \omega_{\text{initial}}}{t}
\]

Since the turntable starts from rest, \(\omega_{\text{initial}} = 0\). Thus:

\[
\alpha = \frac{\omega_{\text{final}}}{t}
\]

The final angular velocity is given as 33.3 rpm. Converting this to radians per second:

\[
\omega_{\text{final}} = 33.3 \, \text{rev/min} \times \frac{2\pi \, \text{rad}}{1 \, \text{rev}} \times \frac{1 \, \text{min}}{60 \, \text{s}} = \frac{33.3 \times 2\pi}{60} \, \text{rad/s}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\omega_{\text{final}} = \frac{66.6\pi}{60} \, \text{rad/s} = 1.11\pi \, \text{rad/s} \approx 3.498 \, \text{rad/s}
\]

Now, substituting \(\omega_{\text{final}} = 3.498 \, \text{rad/s}\) and \(t = 2 \, \text{s}\):

\[
\alpha = \frac{3.498}{2} \approx 1.749 \, \text{rad/s}^2
\]

The closest option to this value is 1.74 sec\(^{-2}\), which corresponds to option A.
