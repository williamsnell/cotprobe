Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the cost of goods sold and the gross profit for McLevin'sSporting Goods. Let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the shop started the month with an inventory worth $27,300. Then, during the month, they made additional purchases. Wait, no, the initial inventory is given, then they made more purchases. So, wait, the first line says they started with $27,300, then made additional purchases of skating goods for $3,940 and ski equipment costing $6,340. Oh wait, so the total purchases are 3,940 + 6,340, which is 10,280. But then, some of the ski equipment was damaged and they returned $210 for credit. So that would reduce the total purchases by $210. So the net purchases would be 10,280 - 210 = 10,070.

Wait, no, the initial inventory is part of the cost of goods sold calculation. Because the cost of goods sold is calculated based on the cost of inventory available for sale. So the formula for COGS is COGS = beginning inventory + purchases - returns (or discounts) - ending inventory, right? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Let me think again. COGS is calculated as the cost of goods available for sale minus the ending inventory. The cost of goods available for sale is the beginning inventory plus purchases minus returns. So, the steps are:

1. Begin with beginning inventory: $27,300.

2. Add the total purchases, which were $3,940 + $6,340 = $10,280.

3. Subtract the return amount: $210. So, 10,280 - 210 = 10,070.

So, cost of goods available for sale is beginning inventory + net purchases: 27,300 + 10,070 = 37,370.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the total purchases before considering returns are 3,940 + 6,340 = 10,280. Then, they returned 210, so the net purchases are 10,280 - 210 = 10,070. So the COGS is beginning inventory plus net purchases minus ending inventory.

Wait, no, the formula is COGS = beginning inventory + purchases (net) - ending inventory.

So COGS would be 27,300 + 10,070 - 22,300. Let me compute that.

27,300 + 10,070 = 37,370. Then subtract ending inventory of 22,300: 37,370 - 22,300 = 15,070.

Wait, so the cost of goods sold is $15,070. Is that one of the options? Let me look at the options. Option A is COGS $15,070 and gross profit $11,730. Option B is 15,570 and 11,230, etc. So a) is one of them.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial inventory is 27,300. Then, during the month, they add 3,940 and 6,340, making 10,280. Then they returned 210, so the net purchases are 10,280 - 210 = 10,070.

So COGS is beginning inventory (27,300) plus net purchases (10,070) minus ending inventory (22,300). So: 27,300 + 10,070 = 37,370. 37,370 - 22,300 = 15,070. So a) is correct for the COGS.

Now, for the gross profit. Gross profit is sales minus COGS. The problem says the sales were $26,800. So gross profit is 26,800 - 15,070 = 11,730.

Looking at the options, option A is COGS 15,070 and gross profit 11,730. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the multiple-choice options again. The options are:

A: COGS: $15,070, Gross profit: $11,730

B: 15,570, 11,230

C: 16,570, 10,230

D: 14,070, 12,730

E: 13,570, 13,230

F: 15,070, 10,730

G: 16,070, 10,730

H: 14,470, 12,330

I: 14,570, 12,230

J: 17,070, 9,730

So option A is correct. So the answer should be A.

To determine the cost of goods sold (COGS) and gross profit for McLevin'sSporting Goods, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate Net Purchases:**
   - **Purchases:** $3,940 (skating goods) + $6,340 (ski equipment) = $10,280.
   - **Return:** $210.
   - **Net Purchases:** $10,280 - $210 = $10,070.

2. **Compute COGS:**
   - **Beginning Inventory:** $27,300.
   - **Net Purchases:** $10,070.
   - **Ending Inventory:** $22,300.
   - **COGS:** $27,300 + $10,070 - $22,300 = $15,070.

3. **Calculate Gross Profit:**
   - **Sales:** $26,800.
   - **Gross Profit:** $26,800 - $15,070 = $11,730.

4. **Match with Options:**
   - **COGS:** $15,070.
   - **Gross Profit:** $11,730.
   - **Option A** (Cost of goods sold: $15,070, Gross profit: $11,730) is correct.
