Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of net ionic equations. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about mixing solutions of NH4Br and AgNO3. I remember that when two ionic compounds are mixed, they can undergo a double displacement reaction if they exchange ions without any precipitation or gas formation. But wait, I also remember that some reactions might form precipitates, which would change the net ionic equation.

First, I'll write down the formulas of the compounds involved. NH4Br is ammonium bromide, which dissociates into NH4+ and Br- ions. And AgNO3 is silver nitrate, which dissociates into Ag+ and NO3- ions.

So when these two solutions are mixed, the cations and anions will swap partners. That would give me AgBr and NH4NO3. Let me think about what each of these might do.

Silver bromide, AgBr, is a known compound. I recall that silver forms precipitates with halides when in excess. But wait, in this case, are there enough Ag+ ions to form a precipitate? Let me think about their solubilities. I think nitrates are usually soluble. So NH4NO3 is definitely soluble. Bromide, on the other hand, is a halide. I think silver bromide is insoluble, so it would precipitate out of solution.

So the reaction would be between Ag+ and Br- ions. The net ionic equation would show the formation of AgBr precipitate, along with the dissociation of NH4NO3.

Wait, the reaction equation before considering ions would be: AgNO3(aq) + NH4Br(aq) → AgBr(s) + NH4NO3(aq). But the net ionic equation would just show the formation of the precipitate and the dissociations of the soluble ionic compounds.

Breaking it down, the steps are:

1. Write the balanced molecular equation, ignoring the solids and liquids for now. The reaction is between AgNO3 and NH4Br to produce AgBr and NH4NO3.

2. Split all aqueous ionic compounds into ions. So, AgNO3 → Ag+ + NO3^-; NH4Br → NH4+ + Br^-; NH4NO3 → NH4+ + NO3^-.

3. Identify which ions are spectators. In this case, Ag+ and NO3^- are on both sides. So they’ll cancel out in the net ionic equation.

So, the net ionic equation would only include the ions that participate in the reaction. So the net ionic equation is:

Ag+ (aq) + Br- (aq) → AgBr (s)

Wait, but I should make sure about the charges and whether the precipitate is correct. Silver bromide is a white precipitate, which makes sense. So the reaction is a simple exchange of ions leading to a solid.

Looking back at the options, option I is Ag+(aq) + Br-(aq) → AgBr(s). That matches what I was thinking. Another option is H, but H is AgNO3 + Br- → AgBr and NO3-. That's the overall equation, but the net ionic doesn't show the nitrate ions if they're spectators.

Option G is Ag+ + NH4+ + Br- → AgNH4Br, which is the full molecular equation, but the net ionic would be the only ions reacting, so it's just Ag+ and Br-.

So the correct net ionic equation should be option I.

The problem involves mixing solutions of NH4Br (ammonium bromide) and AgNO3 (silver nitrate). Both compounds dissociate completely in water into their respective ions: NH4Br → NH4+ (aq) + Br- (aq), and AgNO3 → Ag+ (aq) + NO3- (aq). When these solutions are mixed, a double displacement reaction occurs, swapping the cations and anions to form AgNO3 (aq), NH4Br (aq), and the potential product AgBr (s) and NH4NO3 (aq). 

To write the net ionic equation, spectator ions (Ag+ and NO3-) are removed, leaving only the reacting ions: Ag+ (aq) and Br- (aq). The resulting precipitate, AgBr (s), is formed. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option I** correctly represents the net ionic equation: **Ag+(aq) + Br-(aq) → AgBr(s)**.

Other options either include spectator ions (e.g., AgBr(aq)) or incorrect products (e.g., NH4NO3(aq)) or do not accurately represent the reaction.
