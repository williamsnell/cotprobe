Okay, so I've got this question about network security and the OSI model. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking about failed sessions allowing brute-force attacks. I remember that in computer networking, a session refers to a connection between a client and a server. If a session fails, especially a brute-force attack, it usually means the client couldn't connect to the server, probably because the password or key was incorrect.

Now, the OSI model has several layers: Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and others. Wait, the question is about the layer where this kind of attack occurs. 

I think the session layer is the right choice here. The session layer is where the client and server communicate. If the session fails, it's because the client can't establish a connection, so the session layer is involved in this process. The session layer handles things like establishing the connection, transferring data, and managing the session's lifecycle. So if the session fails, that's within the session layer.

Looking at the options, option J is the Session layer. That makes sense because the session layer is responsible for managing the communication between the client and server. If the session doesn't last, like a failed session, that's an issue at the session layer.

The question relates to the failure of a session, which occurs in a failed connection. The session layer, which handles communication between client and server, is responsible for this. 

Answer: J: Session layer
