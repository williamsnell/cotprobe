Okay, so I've got this question about the spin angular momentum of a proton. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum has something to do with rotation, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

Wait, angular momentum L is given by L = I * ω, where I is the moment of inertia and ω is the angular velocity. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Oh wait, wait, wait. Spin angular momentum might be a different thing. I think for particles with spin, the formula is similar to orbital angular momentum but uses the spin quantum number instead of mass. Oh right, the formula is L = s * ħ, where s is the spin quantum number and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Right, the spin quantum number s for a proton is 1/2. Because protons are spin-½ particles. And the reduced Planck constant ħ is h/(2π), where h is Planck's constant. Planck's constant is approximately 6.62607015 × 10^-34 J·s. So ħ would be that divided by 2π.

So let's calculate that. I'll compute 1/2 times ħ. Let's see, 6.626e-34 divided by (2 * 3.1416). Let me compute 2π: that's about 6.2832. So 6.626e-34 divided by 6.2832 is approximately 1.05457e-34 J·s. Wait, because 6.2832 * 1.05457 is about 6.626. So yeah.

Wait, but wait, the options are given in 1e-35, so I need to check the exponents. Oh wait the options are all 1e-35. So my calculation gives around 1.05e-34, but the options are 1e-35. That's a factor of 10 difference. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, let me double-check the value of ħ. Oh wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Yes. So if s is 1/2, then L = (1/2) * ħ = 5.272859e-35 J·s. Wait, that's approximately 5.27e-35. Looking at the options, option I is 5.27e-35, which is option I. So the answer should be I: 5.27e-35 J·s.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Another way to approach it: if L = sħ, s=1/2, so 0.5 * ħ = 0.5 * 1.05457e-34 = 5.27285e-35. So that's 5.27e-35, which matches option I.

To calculate the spin angular momentum of a proton, we use the formula for spin angular momentum, \( L = s \cdot \hbar \), where \( s \) is the spin quantum number and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant. For a proton, \( s = \frac{1}{2} \), and the reduced Planck constant is approximately \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \).

Substituting these values:

\[
L = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-35} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s}.
\]

This value corresponds to option **I: 5.27 \(10^{-35} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s}\)**.
