Question:

Sussman Co. prepared cash-basis financial statements for the month ended January 31. A summary of Sussman's January activities follows: Credit sales of $5600. Collections of $1900 relating to January credit sales. Accrued salaries of $1200. By what amount will Sussman's cash-basis income for the month ended January 31 increase as a result of restating these activities to the accrual basis of accounting?

Options:

A: 4900
B: $3,700
C: $6,800
D: $1,200
E: $5,600
F: $1,900
G: $2,500
H: $4,400
I: $3,100
J: $4,100

Okay, so I've got this accounting question here about cash vs accrual basis. Hmm, I remember that cash basis accounting records transactions as they happen, while accrual basis records them when they are earned or incurred. So, the question is about how a restatement from cash to accrual affects the income.

The problem says Sussman Co. has credit sales of $5600 in January. Then collections of $1900 on those credit sales. Also, they accrued salaries of $1200. Now, the question is by what amount will the cash-basis income increase as a result of restating these activities to accrual basis.

Wait, so under cash basis, when you collect money, it's cash-in, so that would be part of cash income. But under accrual, you accrue the salaries, so that's part of expenses. But wait, the question is about the change in the income, not the net income.

So, under cash basis:

- Credit sales are $5600, so that's cash inflow.
- Collections of $1900, so that's another cash inflow. So total cash inflow from these two would be 5600 + 1900 = $7500.

Under accrual basis:

- Credit sales are still $5600 as a liability. So no change in cash here.
- Accrued salaries are $1200. So that's an expense but not cash. So the income would be increased by the amount of the expense (since it's an increase in expenses, which reduces net income, but wait, the question is about the cash-basis income increasing as a result.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question is about the cash-basis income increasing. Wait, under cash basis, the income is based on cash transactions. Under accrual, the cash-basis income might not include the accrued expenses yet.

Wait, let's think: the question is about the effect of restating the activities from cash to accrual. So the change in the cash-basis income compared to the accrual basis.

Under cash basis:

- Cash sales: $5600 (from credit sales)
- Collections: $1900 (from those credit sales). So the cash inflow from sales is $5600, then collected $1900. So in terms of cash, that's $5600 + $1900 = $7500.

Under accrual basis:

- Credit sales: $5600 (as a liability, not cash)
- Accrued salaries: $1200 (an expense, so part of the cost of goods sold or something else, but not cash)

So, the cash-basis in this case would not have collected the $1900 yet. Because under cash basis, collections are just the immediate cash received, not the cash from credit sales. So the $1900 is not part of cash-basis income until they are collected.

So, under cash-basis, the income from credit sales is $5600, but under accrual, it's $5600 as a liability. But in cash-basis, the collections are $1900, so that's another cash inflow.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.

Under cash basis:

- Cash sales: $5600 (this is income)
- Collections: $1900 (this is another cash inflow)
So total for these two in cash basis is 5600 + 1900 = $7500.

Under accrual basis:

- Credit sales: $5600 (as revenue, but recognized as income when the cash is received)
- Accrued salaries: $1200 (as an expense, so reduces income)

So, under accrual, the cash-basis income from these would be $5600 (from credit sales) minus the accrued salaries. Wait, no, under cash basis, the $5600 is from credit sales, which is a liability. But under accrual, that's a revenue. So the cash-basis income from credit sales would be zero, because under cash basis, the collection hasn't been made yet.

Wait, no. Wait, for cash basis, the collection is a cash inflow. So, under cash basis, the $1900 is a cash inflow from credit sales. So, in cash basis, that would be an increase in cash income of $1900 plus $5600 (from credit sales) = $7500.

Under accrual basis:

- Credit sales are $5600 (revenue)
- Accrued salaries are $1200 (expense)
So the net income (or cash-basis income) would be $5600 (revenue) minus $1200 (expense). So $5600 - 1200 = $4400.

So, in cash basis, the total cash-basis income is $7500. Under accrual, the cash-basis would be lower by $1900 (because the $1900 was not collected yet), but wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the effect on the cash-basis income. So, under cash basis, the $1900 is part of the income. Under accrual, that's not yet collected. So the cash-basis income is higher by $1900, because in cash basis, the collection is part of the income.

Wait, no. Let's think about the actual numbers. In cash basis, the $5600 is from sales, and the $1900 is from collections, so that's two separate cash inflows. So the total cash-basis income from these two would be $5600 + 1900 = $7500.

Under accrual basis, the $5600 is a revenue, and the $1200 is an expense. So the net income would be 5600 - 1200 = $4400. But since the restatement is to accrual, the cash-basis would not have received the $1900, so the cash-basis income would be $5600 (from credit sales) - 1200 (from salaries) ... but wait, that's not right. Because under cash basis, the $5600 is from credit sales, and the $1900 is a collection from that credit. So, in cash basis, the $1900 is a separate income item, but under accrual, it's part of the revenue.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me approach it differently. The question is about the change in the cash-basis income. So, from cash to accrual.

Under cash basis, the income from credit sales is $5600, and the collections are $1900. So, total cash-basis income from these two is 5600 + 1900 = $7500.

Under accrual basis, the $5600 is a revenue, and the $1200 is an expense. So, the cash-basis would not have collected the $1900 yet, so the $1900 is not part of the cash-basis income. Therefore, the cash-basis income from these two items would be $5600 (from credit sales) minus $1200 (from salaries) because under cash basis, the salaries would be an expense and not part of the income. So, the net cash-basis income from these two would be 5600 - 1200 = $4400. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the $5600 is a liability, not income.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Wait, the question says, "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the answer is a number, and the last letter is that letter.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the difference in cash-basis income. Under cash basis, the $1900 is part of income. Under accrual, the same $1900 is part of revenue. So the change is $1900. So, the cash-basis income would increase by $1900 under the restatement.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't account for the salaries. Because under cash basis, the $1900 is part of income, but under accrual, the $1200 is an expense. So, the net cash-basis would be:

Under cash: $7500

Under accrual: $5600 (from credit) - $1200 (salaries) = 4400

So the increase in cash-basis income is 7500 - 4400 = $3100? Hmm, that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbers wrong.

Wait, maybe the question is only about the $1900 collections. Because under cash-basis, the $1900 is a cash inflow. Under accrual, the same $1900 is a collection of a credit sale, but that's a liability, not cash. So, the cash-basis would have $5600 (from credit) + $1900 (collections) = $7500. Under accrual, the $5600 is a liability, and $1200 is an expense. So the cash-basis income is $5600 (from credit) - $1200 (salaries) = $4400. So the increase is 7500 - 4400 = $3100. But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps what I'm missing is that the question is only about the restatement's effect on the cash-basis income. So the $1900 collections are part of cash-basis income, and under restatement, that's part of the cash-basis. The $1200 is an expense, so that reduces cash-basis income.

Wait, no, the question is about the cash-basis income increasing as a result of the change. So, under cash basis, the $1900 is part of income. Under accrual, the same $1900 is not part of income because it's a collection.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think about the total cash-basis income before and after.

Under cash basis:

- Credit sales: $5600. Collections: $1900. So, total cash-basis income from these two is 5600 + 1900 = $7500.

Under accrual basis:

- Credit sales: $5600. Accrued salaries: $1200. So, the cash-basis income from credit sales is $5600, but since the salaries are an expense, the net is 5600 - 1200 = $4400.

So, the difference is 7500 (cash basis) minus 4400 (accrual basis) = $3100. Wait, that's not an option. The options include some like $4,400, but I'm getting $3,100, which isn't there. So perhaps I'm not considering something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the $1200 is an expense under accrual basis, but under cash basis, it's not part of income. So the cash-basis income would be 5600 (from credit sales) - 1200 (salaries) = 4400. But under cash basis, the 1900 collections are income. So cash-basis total income is 5600 + 1900 = 7500.

So the increase in cash-basis income is 7500 (cash-basis) minus 4400 (accrual) = 3,100. So the answer would be 3,100, but that's not an option. Looking at the choices, the closest is option H, which is 4,400. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, did I miscount the numbers? Let's double-check the problem.

The problem says:
- Credit sales: $5600
- Collections: $1900 (of credit sales)
- Accrued salaries: $1200.

So, under cash basis:

Cash-basis income from credit sales: $5600
Cash-basis income from collections: $1900
Total: $7500

Under accrual basis:

Accrued salaries: $1200 (an expense)
So, cash-basis income is $5600 (from credit) minus $1200 (expense) = $4400.

So, the difference is 7500 - 4400 = $3,100. But looking at the options, the closest is H: $4,400. Hmm, that's not matching. Did I miss something?

Wait a minute, perhaps the question is not about the restatement's effect on both, but only the effect of the change in the specific items. So, the $1900 collections are a part of cash-basis income. Under accrual, the same $1900 is from collections, which is part of the liability. So, perhaps the cash-basis income for these two (collections and credit sales) would increase by $1900, and the salaries expense would reduce the net income by $1200. But since the question is about the cash-basis income, perhaps only the collections are part of the income. So, the cash-basis would have $1900, and the accrual would have $5600 - $1200 = $4400. So, the net cash-basis income is $7500, and the accrual is $4400. The difference is 3,100, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm thinking wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total cash-basis income for the month. So, under cash basis, the total income is $7500 (from credit and collections). Under accrual, it's $5600 - 1200 = 4400. So the change is 7500 - 4400 = 3100. But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest is option B: $3,700, option H: $4,400.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the change in the two items.

In cash basis, the $5600 is from credit sales, which is a liability. The $1900 is from collections, which is another liability. Under accrual, the $5600 is considered an expense, and the $1200 is an expense. So, the effect on cash-basis income would be:

Under cash-basis:

- Cash sales: $5600
- Collections: $1900
Total: $7500.

Under accrual:

- Credit sales: $5600
- Accrued salaries: $1200
So, the net is $5600 - $1200 = $4400.

So, the increase in cash-basis income is $7500 - $4400 = $3,100. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering the $1900 collections, and the $1200 salaries as a separate effect. So, the cash-basis income increases by $1900, but since the salaries are an expense, the net cash-basis income from these two items is $7500 (from cash basis) minus $4400 (from accrual) = $3,100.

But that's not an option. The options are A to J, so perhaps the answer is not in the options, which is unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is only about the effect of the restatement. So, the $1900 collections would be an increase in cash-basis income. The $1200 salaries would be an expense under accrual, but not under cash.

So, the effect is that the cash-basis income is $1900 (from collections), and the net income is $5600 - $1200 = $4400.

So, the total cash-basis income is $7500 (from cash basis), and under accrual, it's $4400. So the increase is $7500 - $4400 = $3,100. But that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. The options are:

A:4900

B:3,700

C:6,800

D:1,200

E:5,600

F:1,900

G:2,500

H:4,400

I:3,100

J:4,100.

Oh, option I is 3,100. So that must be the answer. But why?

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through it again.

Under cash basis:

- Credit sales: $5600 (total income)
- Collections: $1900 (another income item)
So, total cash-basis income for these two is 5600 + 1900 = 7500.

Under accrual basis:

- Credit sales: $5600 (revenue)
- Accrued salaries: $1200 (expense)
So, the net income is 5600 - 1200 = 4400.

The cash-basis would have 7500, the accrual would have 4400. So the net cash-basis income is 7500 - 4400=3100.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is only about the effect on the salaries. Because the $1200 is an expense in accrual, but in cash, it's a liability. So under restatement, the $1200 is an expense in accrual, but as a liability in cash. So, the cash-basis would have 5600 (from credit sales) minus 1200 (salary expense) = 4400. So, the cash-basis income is 7500 (from credit and collections) minus 4400 (from accrual) = 3100.

So, the correct answer is 3,100. But the options don't have this. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that under cash basis, the $1900 is part of the income. Under accrual basis, the same $1900 is part of the revenue. So, the difference is $1900. But in the options, the closest is H:4,400.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the fact that the $1200 is an expense in accrual but not part of the cash-basis income. So, the cash-basis would have 5600 (from credit sales) minus 1200 (from salaries) = 4400. So, the increase in cash-basis income is 7500 - 4400 = 3,100. Which is option I.

But why would the question ask for this? Because perhaps the correct answer is 3,100, which is option I. But the options don't have that. Wait, no, the options include option I as 3,100.

Ah, right, the options are:

A:4900

B:3,700

C:6,800

D:1,200

E:5,600

F:1,900

G:2,500

H:4,400

I:3,100

J:4,100.

So the correct answer is option I:3,100.

Wait, but why would the question ask for this? Because perhaps the $1900 is part of the cash-basis income, and the $1200 is an expense. So, the net cash-basis would be 5600 (from credit sales) - 1200 (salaries) = 4400. The cash-basis from collections is 1900. So, the total cash-basis income is 4400 + 1900 = 6300. But wait, that's not the case because under cash basis, the $1900 is part of the income, not the liability.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct approach is that the $1900 collections are part of the cash-basis income, and the $1200 salaries are part of the accrual basis. So, the net cash-basis income is 5600 (from credit) - 1200 (salaries) = 4400. The cash-basis income from collections is 1900. So, the total cash-basis income is 4400 + 1900 = 6300. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is 3,100, which is option I.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, and the correct answer is option H:4,400, which is the difference between the two incomes (7500 - 4400 = 3,100). But the options don't have 3,100, but option I is 3,100. Wait, option I is 3,100, which is correct. So, the answer is option I.

Wait, but another way to see this: the $1900 collections are part of cash-basis income, so it's 1900. The $1200 salaries are an expense under accrual, so it's 1200. So, the net effect is that the cash-basis income is higher by 1900, and the accrual income is lower by 1200. So, the net difference is 1900 - 1200 = 700. Wait, that's not matching any options.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for the difference between the two incomes: 7500 (cash) - 4400 (accrual) = 3,100, which is option I. So, the correct answer is option I.
</think>

The question asks for the increase in cash-basis income when transitioning from the accrual basis to the cash basis. Under the accrual basis, the $5600 credit sales and $1200 salaries are recognized as expenses. Under the cash basis, the $5600 credit sales are recognized as income, and the $1900 collections are also recognized as income. The salaries expense under the accrual basis does not affect the cash-basis income.

To calculate the effect:

1. Under the cash basis:
   - Cash-basis income from credit sales: $5600
   - Cash-basis income from collections: $1900
   - Total cash-basis income from these two: $5600 + $1900 = $7500

2. Under the accrual basis:
   - Accrued salaries: $1200 (expense)
   - Net cash-basis income from these two: $5600 - $1200 = $4400

3. The difference in cash-basis income:
   - $7500 (cash-basis) - $4400 (accrual) = $3,100

Among the options, option I (3,100) is correct.

ANSWER: I
