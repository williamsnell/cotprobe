Okay, so I've got this basketball problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about forming a starting lineup with specific numbers of guards and forwards. Hmm.

So, the team has 12 players in total. Out of these, 5 are guards and 7 are forwards. I need to form a lineup that includes 3 guards and 2 forwards. So, I guess I need to calculate how many ways there are to choose 3 guards from the 5 available and 2 forwards from the 7 available.

Wait, right. For combinations, the formula is "n choose k", which is n!/(k!(n-k)!). So for the guards, it's 5 choose 3, and for the forwards, it's 7 choose 2. Then I multiply those two numbers together to get the total number of different lineups.

Let me calculate each part. Starting with 5 choose 3: 5!/(3!*(5-3)!) = (5*4*3!)/(3!*2!) = (5*4)/2! = 20/2 = 10. Wait, no, I think I messed up the calculation. Wait, 5 choose 3 is the same as 5 choose 2, but let me compute it again. 5 choose 3 is 10. Wait no, 5*4*3/(3*2*1) is 60/6=10. Oh wait, that's correct. So 10 ways for the guards.

Now for the forwards: 7 choose 2. That's 7!/(2!*(7-2)!)= (7*6)/(2*1)=42/2=21. So 21 ways for the forwards.

Now, to get the total number of lineups, I multiply the number of ways to choose guards by the number of ways to choose forwards. So 10 * 21 = 210. 

Looking at the options, option C is 210. So the answer should be C.

The number of ways to choose 3 guards from 5 is 10, and from 7 forwards is 21. Multiplying these gives 10 * 21 = 210, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
