Question:

The color of a pixel can be represented using the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color model, which stores values for red, green, and blue, each ranging from 0 to 255. How many bits (binary digits) would be needed to represent a color in the RGB model?

Options:

A: 56
B: 16
C: 64
D: 24
E: 8
F: 48
G: 12
H: 128
I: 72
J: 32

Okay, so I've got this question about the RGB color model and how many bits are needed to represent a color. Hmm, I remember that RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue. Each of these components is an 8-bit value because each can range from 0 to 255, right? But wait, let me think more carefully.

Each color component (red, green, blue) uses 8 bits. So 8 bits for red, 8 for green, and 8 for blue. That adds up to 24 bits per color. But wait, the question is about representing a color in the RGB model. So each color is made up of three such components. 

Wait, so the total bits would be 8 * 3 = 24 bits. So each color is stored as 24 bits. So the answer should be 24, which is option D. 

Let me double-check. Oh right, each channel is 8 bits. So 8+8+8 is 24. So yeah, the correct number of bits is 24. The options don't have any other number close to 24, so I think option D is the right choice.

The RGB model uses 8 bits for each of the red, green, and blue components. Since there are three components, the total number of bits is 8 * 3 = 24. 

Answer: D
