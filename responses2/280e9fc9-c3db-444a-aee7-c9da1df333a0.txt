Okay, so I have this question about Kant's moral and legal laws. Hmm, I remember from my philosophy class that Kant's theory is all about the distinction between good and bad, and how that affects our moral and legal systems.

The question is asking about the laws of nature and laws of freedom. I think the laws of nature are about what naturally happens, and the laws of freedom are about what's right to do. 

Wait, I remember something about the distinction between necessary and contingent truths. Necessary truths are something that must be true, like "the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees." Contingent truths can be true or false depending on circumstances, like whether it will rain today.

So, for Kant, laws of nature would be necessary truths. That's what he called them, right? Because they're not contingent on anything. So the laws of nature are things that must happen, like the laws of physics. These are necessary.

Then, for the laws of freedom, Kant argued that they are contingent on the state of society. He said that certain actions are right because of the particular circumstances and interests involved. So, for example, it's right to help the elderly if it improves their quality of life. This isn't a law that's absolutely true; it depends on the situation.

Looking at the options, I need to find which two statements match this. Let's see:

Option A: nothing will happen; everything ought to happen. That seems swapped. I think it's the opposite. I thought laws of nature are necessary, not contingent, so A would be the opposite of what's correct.

Option B: both laws are contingent. No, I think laws of nature are necessary.

Option C: everything will happen; everything ought to happen. That doesn't seem right. I don't think laws of nature are about what will happen, which is contingent.

Option D: both laws are everything ought to happen. Oh, that's the laws of nature. Laws of nature are things that must happen, so that's correct. But laws of freedom are contingent, so this option says both are contingent, which I don't think is right.

Option E: nothing will happen; everything will happen. No, laws of nature are necessary, not contingent. And laws of freedom are contingent.

Option F: both nothing happens and nothing happens. That's not right. Laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.

Option G: both everything happens and everything happens. That's not correct. Laws of nature are necessary.

Option H: everything happens; nothing will happen. No, laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.

Option I: everything will happen; everything will happen. That's about contingent truths. Not right.

Option J: everything happens; nothing ought to happen. No, laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. 

Kant's distinction is between necessary (necessitation) truths and contingent ( contingency ) truths. Necessary truths are true by necessity, like "A triangle has 180 degrees." Contingent truths are true or false depending on circumstances.

For laws of nature, Kant believed they are necessary truths because they are inherent laws of the universe. For example, "It will rain tomorrow" is a contingent truth, but the law of gravity is a necessary truth because it's true regardless of the circumstances.

So, the laws of nature are necessary, and the laws of freedom are contingent. Looking at the options, that would be something like "nothing will happen" is incorrect because laws of nature are necessary. So the first part of the question's answer is about what's necessary, and the second part is about contingent.

Looking back, the options are about what the laws are according to. So:

The first blank is about the laws of nature. According to Kant, they're necessary.

The second blank is about the laws of freedom, which are contingent.

So the correct option should say: laws of nature are necessary, and laws of freedom are contingent.

Looking at the options again:

Option D says "everything ought to happen; everything will happen." No, because laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the question is about what Kant believes about the two laws.

The first part of the question is about the laws of nature: according to Kant, they are laws according to which certain things must happen. So "must" is the word. So, for example, "it will rain tomorrow" is a contingent truth, but the law of gravity is a necessary truth.

So laws of nature are necessary truths, and laws of freedom are contingent truths.

Looking for an option where the first part is about necessary, and the second part about contingent.

Looking at the options:

Option D: "everything ought to happen; everything will happen." No, because laws of nature are necessary.

Option E: "nothing will happen; everything will happen." No, laws of nature are necessary.

Option G: "everything will happen; everything will happen." No, laws of nature are necessary.

Option I: "everything will happen; everything will happen." No, same as G.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me read them again.

The options are:

A: nothing will happen; everything ought to happen.

B: everything ought to happen; everything ought to happen.

C: everything will happen; everything ought to happen.

D: everything ought to happen; everything will happen.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the options again.

The laws of nature are necessary truths—so for example, the law of gravity. So the first blank should have "something must happen."

The laws of freedom are contingent—so they depend on the situation. For example, helping the elderly is a contingent action.

Looking at the options, which of them says that the first part is about necessary, and the second part about contingent.

Looking at the options:

Option D: everything ought to happen; everything will happen. No, because laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.

Option E: nothing will happen; everything will happen. No, laws of nature are necessary.

Option G: everything will happen; everything will happen. No, laws of nature are necessary.

Option I: everything will happen; everything will happen. No, same as G.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, the options are about what Kant claims as the laws.

Option D: "everything ought to happen; everything will happen." Wait no, that can't be right because laws of nature must be necessary, not contingent.

Wait, perhaps the question is reversed.

Wait, the question says: the laws of nature are laws according to which ____, laws of freedom are laws according to which ____. So the first blank is about what the laws of nature are (they are necessary), and the second is about the laws of freedom (contingent).

Looking for an option that says the first blank is about necessary, and the second is about contingent.

Looking at the options:

Option G says "everything will happen; everything will happen." No, that's about contingent truths.

Option D says "everything ought to happen; everything will happen." No, because laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the two. Let me think again. 

Wait, the first part is about what the laws of nature are (they're necessary), and the second is about the laws of freedom (they're contingent).

So the options should have first part about necessary and second about contingent.

Looking at the options:

Option D: "everything ought to happen; everything will happen." No.

Option E: "nothing will happen; everything will happen." No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the question is about what laws are according to which. So, laws of nature are necessary, laws of freedom are contingent.

Looking for an option where the first blank is about necessary, the second about contingent.

Looking through all the options:

Option D: everything ought to happen; everything will happen. No, because laws of nature are necessary.

Option G: everything will happen; everything will happen. No.

Option H: everything happens; nothing will happen. No.

Option I: everything will happen; everything will happen. No.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the second part. Maybe the laws of freedom are contingent, meaning that they can be true or false, but they are not necessarily true. 

Wait, let's think of an example. For example, it's a contingent truth that it will rain tomorrow. So the law of nature would be that it will rain, but that's a contingent truth because it can rain or not. Wait no, that's not right. The law of nature is the necessary truth, like "it will rain tomorrow" is a contingent truth, but the law of gravity is a necessary truth.

Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. So the laws of nature are necessary truths, and the laws of freedom are contingent. So the options should reflect that the first blank is about necessary, the second about contingent.

Looking for such an option.

Wait, all the options are about two statements.

Looking at option D: "everything ought to happen; everything will happen."

No, laws of nature are necessary, so D would be incorrect.

Looking at option E: "nothing will happen; everything will happen." No, that's about contingent truths, not laws.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about it again.

Wait, the question is about the laws according to which. So, laws of nature are necessary, so the first blank should be "something must happen." The second blank is about the laws of freedom, which are contingent—so they can be true or false depending on circumstances. So, the second part is something that can happen or not.

Looking at the options, the correct one would be:

First blank: "something must happen"

Second blank: "something can happen or not"

Looking for an option where the first part is about necessary and the second about contingent.

Hmm, the options don't have that. Let's look again.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think of the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option D: everything ought to happen; everything will happen.

Wait, does that mean laws of freedom are contingent, as in they can be true or not? But that doesn't fit. The laws of freedom are contingent on the state of society.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D: "everything ought to happen; everything will happen."

No, because laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. 

The first part is about laws of nature. According to Kant, they are laws according to which something must happen. So, the first blank is filled with "something must happen."

The second part is about laws of freedom. According to Kant, they are laws according to which something can happen or not. So, the second blank is "something can happen or not."

Looking for an option where the first part is about necessary and the second about contingent.

Wait, none of the options directly say that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the first blank is "something must happen," and the second blank is "something is contingent." But looking at the options, they are presented separately.

So, the options are:

A: nothing happens; everything should happen.

B: everything should happen; everything should happen.

C: everything happens; everything should happen.

D: everything should happen; everything will happen.

E: nothing happens; everything will happen.

Wait, perhaps option D is correct. Because, according to Kant, the laws of nature are necessary, so the first part is "something must happen." Then the laws of freedom are contingent, so the second part is "something can happen or not." But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the first part is about necessary, and the second part is about contingent.

Wait, maybe the answer is D: "everything ought to happen; everything will happen." Because the first part is the law of nature (must happen), and the second part is the law of freedom (can happen or not). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: 

Kant's laws of nature are necessary truths (they must happen), and his laws of freedom are contingent (they depend on the state). So the first blank should be "something must happen" and the second blank "something can happen or not."

But looking at the options, I don't see any option that says that. So perhaps the question is reversed.

Wait, maybe the first blank is about contingent and the second about necessary. But that's not what the question says.

Alternatively, perhaps the first part is contingent, and the second is necessary? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: everything ought to happen; everything will happen.

So, the first part is "everything should happen"—which might be the laws of nature. The second part is "everything will happen," which could be the laws of freedom.

Wait, but according to Kant, the laws of nature are necessary, not contingent. So the first part can't be "everything should happen." Because that's a contingent truth.

So, perhaps the options are phrased differently. Let me go back to the question.

The question is: The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question: According to Kant, laws of nature are laws according to which __________, and laws of freedom are laws according to which __________.

So, the first blank is about what laws of nature are (they're necessary). The second blank is about what laws of freedom are (they're contingent).

So, looking for an option where the first part is "something must happen" and the second is "something can happen or not."

Looking through the options, I don't see such an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the laws of nature are contingent? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the laws of freedom are necessary. That can't be right because Kant said they're contingent.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D. Because, according to Kant, the laws of nature must happen, and the laws of freedom can happen or not.

But I'm not sure because the options don't directly present that.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G: "everything will happen; everything will happen." But that doesn't make sense because the laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the two. Let's think of the options again.

The question gives four options, and the correct one is the one where the first part is about necessary (must happen) and the second part about contingent (can happen or not).

Looking back at the options, perhaps none of them fit that. So, maybe the correct answer is D: "everything should happen; everything will happen," but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is reversed, with the first part being contingent and the second being necessary. But that's not what the question says.

Wait, perhaps the laws of freedom are contingent, so the second blank should be "something can happen or not." But none of the options have that.

I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is D, but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: the laws of nature are necessary, so the first blank should be "something must happen." The laws of freedom are contingent, so the second blank should be "something can happen or not." But since none of the options present this, perhaps the correct option is D, which uses "everything should happen" and "everything will happen," but that might be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D, because the first part is about what the laws of nature are (they are necessary), and the second part is about the laws of freedom (they are contingent). So, the correct option is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, we need to recall Kant's distinction between necessary and contingent truths. According to Kant, laws of nature are necessary truths, meaning they must occur, such as the laws of physics. Laws of freedom, on the other hand, are contingent, meaning they can occur or not occur depending on the state of society.

The question asks for the two blanks:

1. Laws of nature are laws according to which __________.
2. Laws of freedom are laws according to which __________.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: "nothing will happen; everything ought to happen." Incorrect, as laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.
- **Option B**: "everything ought to happen; everything ought to happen." Incorrect, as laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.
- **Option C**: "everything will happen; everything ought to happen." Incorrect, as laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.
- **Option D**: "everything ought to happen; everything will happen." Incorrect, as laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.
- **Option E**: "nothing will happen; everything will happen." Incorrect, as laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.
- **Option F**: "nothing will happen; nothing will happen." Incorrect, as laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.
- **Option G**: "everything will happen; everything will happen." Incorrect, as laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.
- **Option H**: "everything happens; nothing will happen." Incorrect, as laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.
- **Option I**: "everything will happen; nothing will happen." Incorrect, as laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.
- **Option J**: "everything happens; nothing ought to happen." Incorrect, as laws of nature are necessary, not contingent.

The correct answer must reflect that laws of nature are necessary truths and laws of freedom are contingent. However, none of the options directly match this description. Given the provided options, the closest match is **Option D**, which might be interpreted as incorrectly applying necessary and contingent labels, but it is the only option that attempts to align with the concepts of necessary and contingent truths.

ANSWER: D
