Okay, so I have this question here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again carefully.

John Backus will pay the Third National Bank $342.65 on July 1. The interest is $17.25. The question is asking me to find out how much he borrowed. The options are A to J, each with different amounts.

Hmm, wait a second. So, I think this is a simple interest problem. The formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where I is interest, P is principal (the amount borrowed), R is the rate, and T is time. But I'm not sure about the time here. The question doesn't specify how long the money was borrowed for. That's a bit of a problem because without the time, I can't apply the formula directly.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The question says he paid $342.65 in total, which I think includes the principal and the interest. So the total amount paid is the principal plus interest. So total amount = principal + interest. 

If that's the case, then principal = total amount - interest.

So, let's plug in the numbers. The total amount he paid is $342.65, and the interest is $17.25. So principal would be 342.65 minus 17.25.

Let me calculate that: 342.65 - 17.25 equals... 325.40.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is $325.40. That seems straightforward. But wait, why is the total amount given as $342.65? Because that's the amount he paid, which is the principal plus interest. So the principal is the amount he borrowed.

But wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-read it.

"John Backus will pay the Third National Bank $342.65 on July 1. Find the amount he borrowed, given the interest is $17.25."

Wait, maybe the $342.65 is the amount he has to pay, which includes both principal and interest. So the principal is what he borrowed. So the calculation is correct: 342.65 - 17.25 = 325.40.

Looking at the options, J is $325.40. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but why is the question even asking? Maybe I'm missing something. Oh, perhaps the time period is needed. Because simple interest is calculated over a period, and without knowing the time, I can't compute it. But the question does not provide the duration. So I think I was right initially.

Alternatively, perhaps the $342.65 is the amount owed, which includes interest. So the principal is the amount he borrowed, and the interest is $17.25 on that principal.

Wait, but that's the same as before. So the principal would be 342.65 - 17.25 = 325.40. So the answer is J.

Alternatively, maybe the $342.65 is the interest. But no, the question says he paid $342.65 in total, which includes the principal and the interest.

So, I think the correct answer is J, $325.40.

The amount borrowed is the total amount paid minus the interest. 

Principal = $342.65 - $17.25 = $325.40.

Answer: J: $325.40
