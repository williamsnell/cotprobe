Question:

What would the money rate of interest have to be at an inflation rate of 6% to induce people to hold the same proportion of their assets in the form of money as they would with stable prices, if the real rate of in-terest was 5% and was not affected by the inflation?

Options:

A: 21%
B: 1%
C: 6%
D: 10%
E: 8.5%
F: 3.5%
G: 11%
H: 16%
I: 5%
J: 15%

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the money rate of interest and how it affects the proportion of assets people hold. The scenario is that at an inflation rate of 6%, people hold the same proportion of their assets as they would if stable prices were the case. The real rate of interest is 5%, and it's not affected by inflation. I need to find the money rate of interest from the given options.

Hmm, wait, I remember something about the Fisher equation. The Fisher equation relates the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate, and the inflation rate. The formula is something like:

Nominal interest rate = Real interest rate + Inflation rate

Or wait, maybe with a different sign. Let me think. Oh right, the Fisher equation is:

r = i + π

where:
- r is the nominal interest rate
- i is the real interest rate
- π is the inflation rate

Is that correct? Or is it r = i - π? I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, the correct Fisher equation is:

i = r + π

where the signs are the same. So if inflation is π, then the nominal rate is the real rate plus inflation.

Wait no, I think I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think again. The real rate is the nominal rate minus inflation, right? So the correct formula is:

r = i - π

Where r is real, i is nominal, and π is inflation. So rearranged, the nominal rate is real rate plus inflation.

So in this case, the real rate is 5%, and the inflation rate is 6%. So plugging into the formula, the nominal rate would be 5% + 6% = 11%.

Wait, but the question says "the money rate of interest". Wait, in some contexts, the money rate is the nominal rate, but sometimes they might be confused. Or wait, maybe in some definitions, the money rate is the real rate. Let me think again.

But the question says, "the money rate of interest". I think in this context, the money rate is the same as the nominal rate, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes money rate refers to the real rate, but I think in this case, it's the nominal rate.

Wait, wait. Let's think about what the question is asking. It says, "the money rate of interest" is required to induce people to hold the same proportion of assets as with stable prices. So if the inflation is 6%, and the real rate is 5%, what's the nominal rate?

Wait, from the earlier equation, if the real rate is 5% and inflation is 6%, then the nominal rate would be 5% plus 6% = 11%, right? So that would be the nominal rate of interest.

But wait, looking at the options, option G is 11% and option C is 6%. Let me double-check the options.

Options are:

A:21%, B:1%, C:6%, D:10%, E:8.5%, F:3.5%, G:11%, H:16%, I:5%, J:15%.

So according to the calculation, the answer should be G:11%.

Wait, but another possibility is that the money rate is the real rate, but that doesn't seem right because the real rate is 5%, and the money rate would be the same as the real rate? Or perhaps the question is using "money rate" as the real rate, which would be 5% in this case. But that's not matching the calculation I did earlier, which gave 11%.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The Fisher equation is i = r + π. So with r=5% and π=6%, i=11%. So the nominal rate is 11%, so G.

But wait, another angle: do they mean the required money rate equals the real rate minus the inflation rate? Because sometimes you have to consider whether the money rate is in real terms or nominal. Wait, but the question says "money rate" is the rate, not the real rate. So the money rate is the same as the nominal rate.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the terms confused. Wait, in some contexts, the money rate refers to the real rate, but I think that's not the case here. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, the question says, "the money rate of interest" so it's the same as the nominal rate. So using the Fisher equation, I think the correct calculation is 5% +6% =11%, so G.

Wait, but wait, another thought: sometimes the Fisher equation is written as i = r + π, but in some versions, it's i = (1 + r) * (1 + π) -1. Let me check. That formula is correct as well. So with r=5% and π=6%, (1.05)(1.06)=1.05*1.06 = 1.113, so 11.3%, but the question says that the inflation is 6%, and the real rate is 5%. So the nominal rate should be 11% approximately. So the answer is G:11%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 11%, which is what I get. So the correct answer should be G.

The question asks for the money rate of interest required to hold assets in the same proportion as stable prices, given an inflation rate of 6%, a real rate of 5%, and no change in the real rate due to inflation. Using the Fisher equation, the nominal interest rate (which is the money rate in this context) is calculated as:

\[ i = r + \pi \]

where:
- \( r = 5\% \) (real rate),
- \( \pi = 6\% \) (inflation rate).

Thus, \( i = 5\% + 6\% = 11\% \).

From the options provided, the correct choice is **G: 11%**.
