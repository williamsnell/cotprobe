Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. So the question is about fluid dynamics, specifically about how the speed of a fluid changes in a pipe with varying diameters. Hmm, I remember something about the continuity equation from my studies. 

The problem says that the liquid flows at a constant flow rate through a pipe with circular cross-sections of varying diameters. Wait, wait, the flow rate is constant. Oh right, that's the key here. So the volume flow rate is the same everywhere along the pipe. 

The formula for volume flow rate is Q = A * v, where A is the cross-sectional area and v is the flow speed. Since Q is constant, when one part of the pipe changes, the area changes, which affects the speed. 

The cross-sectional area of a pipe with circular cross-section is A = πr², and since the diameter is given, we can relate radius to diameter. Radius is half the diameter. So each point in the pipe has a certain diameter and speed. 

The given values are: at one point, diameter is 2 cm and speed is 18 m/s. We need to find the speed at another point where the diameter is 3 cm. 

Let me write down the formula again: Q1 = Q2. So A1*v1 = A2*v2. 

But since A is proportional to the square of the radius (or diameter, since radius is diameter/2), maybe it's easier to use the diameters directly. Because (d1)^2 * v1 = (d2)^2 * v2. Because A = π*(d/2)^2, so A1 = π*(d1/2)^2 and A2 = π*(d2/2)^2. So when I take the ratio A1/A2, the π and (1/2) terms cancel out. So A1/A2 = (d1/d2)^2. 

So, substituting, (d1^2 * v1) = (d2^2 * v2). 

Let me plug in the numbers. d1 is 2 cm, v1 is 18 m/s. d2 is 3 cm, and I'm looking for v2. 

So, (2 cm)^2 * 18 m/s = (3 cm)^2 * v2.

Calculating the squares: (4 cm²) * 18 = (9 cm²) * v2.

So 4 * 18 = 9 * v2.

4*18 is 72. So 72 = 9 v2. Divide both sides by 9: v2 = 72 /9 = 8 m/s.

Wait, that seems low. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no—wait. Because the flow rate is constant, so if the area increases, the speed must decrease. So 8 m/s seems correct.

Looking at the options, option D is 8 m/s. So the answer should be D. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the diameter and speed. The problem states the first diameter is 2 cm, speed 18 m/s. Second diameter 3 cm, which is larger. So the area is larger, so the speed must be lower. 8 is less than 18, so that makes sense. Like, if the pipe widens, the speed decreases. Yeah, that seems right.

To solve the problem, we use the principle of continuity, which states that the volume flow rate of a fluid remains constant throughout the pipe. The volume flow rate is given by \( Q = A \cdot v \), where \( A \) is the cross-sectional area and \( v \) is the flow speed. Since \( Q \) is constant, we equate the flow rates at two points in the pipe:

\[
A_1 \cdot v_1 = A_2 \cdot v_2
\]

The cross-sectional area \( A \) of a circular pipe is proportional to the square of its diameter (\( A \propto d^2 \)). Therefore, we can write:

\[
\frac{d_1^2 \cdot v_1}{d_2^2} = v_2
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \( d_1 = 2 \, \text{cm}, \, v_1 = 18 \, \text{m/s} \)
- \( d_2 = 3 \, \text{cm} \)

\[
v_2 = \frac{d_1^2 \cdot v_1}{d_2^2} = \frac{(2)^2 \cdot 18}{(3)^2} = \frac{4 \cdot 18}{9} = \frac{72}{9} = 8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the flow speed at the second point is \( 8 \, \text{m/s} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D: 8 m/s**
