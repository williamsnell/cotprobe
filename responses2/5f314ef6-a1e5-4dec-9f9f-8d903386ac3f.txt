Answer:
    <think>

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is about finding the optimal uniquely decodeable code for a given probability distribution. The codeword starts with a symbol from {7,8,9}, and then is followed by binary digits (0 or 1). So each code word is like 7 followed by two bits, making a total of 3 bits.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first symbol is ternary (7,8,9), then binary digits. So each code word is 3 symbols long: 1 from {7,8,9} and then two bits. So each code word is 3 symbols, but the first is ternary, the next two are binary (0 or 1). So the code words are 3 symbols long, but the first can be 7,8,9, and the next two are 0 or 1.

The probability distribution is given as p = (16/69, 15/69,12/69,10/69,8/69,8/69). Wait, that's six values, so the random variable X must have six possible outcomes. So each outcome is represented by a 3-symbol code. So the codewords must be 3 symbols each, with the first being 7,8,9, and the next two being 0 or 1. So each possible outcome is represented by a unique 3-symbol code.

The question is asking for the optimal uniquely decodeable code with minimum expected number of symbols. Wait, but each code is of length 3, so the expected number would just be sum(p_i * 3 for each i). But wait, no, because the code is of fixed length, the expected length is just the sum of the lengths multiplied by their probabilities. But since all code words are length 3, the expected length is 3, which is the same for all. So wait, why is the question about the optimal code? Because in that case, any code that uniquely decodes would have the same expected length. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the question is about the optimal code in terms of minimizing the average code length, but since all code words are fixed-length, the expected length is fixed. So perhaps the question is asking for the code that is optimal in terms of uniquely decodable, perhaps using variable-length codes, but the problem states that each code is 3 symbols. Oh, but wait, the initial part says "the codeword that we use to describe a random variable X always starts with a symbol chosen from the set {7,8,9}, followed by binary digits {0,1}". So each code is 3 symbols long: 7/8/9 followed by two bits. So each code is 3 symbols, so the code words are of length 3.

Wait, but the given p is for a random variable X that has six possible outcomes. So the code words must be assigned to these six outcomes. So, when we construct the code, each of the six outcomes will have a unique 3-symbol code. So the code is 3 symbols long, with the first being 7,8,9, and the next two being 0 or 1.

So, the problem is to assign the three symbols 7,8,9 followed by 0 and 1 such that the code is uniquely decodable, and the expected number of symbols is minimized. But since each code is 3 symbols, the expected length is fixed (each code is 3 symbols, so the expectation is 3 * sum p_i), which is 3*(sum of all p_i). Since sum p_i is 1, the expectation is 3. So why is the question about the optimal code? Perhaps I'm missing something here. Or perhaps the code is variable-length, but the problem states that each code is 3 symbols. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the initial part is that the first character is ternary, and the rest are binary, but each code is 3 symbols. So each code is length 3.

Wait, but in that case, the code length is fixed, so the expected length is fixed. So perhaps the question is just to find the code with the minimum average code length, but that's fixed. Alternatively, perhaps the code must be uniquely decodable, which is given by the prefix property. So, the code must be prefix-free. So, we're to find a prefix code where each code is 3 symbols long, with the first being 7,8,9, and the next two being 0 or 1. And it must be uniquely decodable.

Wait, but in that case, any code that is prefix-free and of fixed length is uniquely decodable. So the question is to find the code with the minimum expected number of symbols, but since all are length 3, the sum is 3, which is the same for all. So all codes are equally good in terms of expected code length. So perhaps the question is about selecting the code that is uniquely decodable, but perhaps the codes have to be built in a way that allows for the minimal possible average code length. But that's not possible if all codes are fixed-length.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "give the optimal uniquely decodeable code (minimum expected number of symbols) for the probability distribution p = (16/69, 15/69, 12/69, 10/69, 8/69, 8/69)". So, the codeword starts with {7,8,9}, then binary digits.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the first part. Maybe the code is a ternary code for the first symbol, and binary for the rest, but each code is variable-length. So, for example, the first symbol is represented by a ternary symbol, then the rest are binary. But that's not what the question says. The question says the first symbol is chosen from {7,8,9}, so that's a ternary symbol. The rest are binary. So each code is 3 symbols long: one ternary, two binary. So the code must be uniquely decodable, and the expected length is 3 bits per symbol. So, the expected number of symbols per code is 3, regardless of the code. So, any of the possible codes would have the same expected length. So perhaps the question is about the code that is uniquely decodable, i.e., a prefix code, and among the options, which one is a prefix code.

Wait, but all the options are 6 symbols long, each starting with 7,8,9, then two bits. So each code is 3 symbols. So, when you decode, you can read the first symbol as 7,8, or 9, and then the next two as bits. So the code words must be prefix-free. So, for a code to be uniquely decodable, it must be a prefix code. So among the options, which ones are prefix codes.

A prefix code is one where no code is a prefix of another. So, for example, code A is '700', code B is '711'. Since '7' is a common prefix, this is not prefix-free. But for a code to be prefix-free, no code can be a prefix of another. So, in the options given, we need to find codes that are prefix-free.

Looking at the options:

A: [7,8,9,73,83,93]

Each code starts with 7,8,9. So, for example, '73' is a code, and '83' is another. Are any codes a prefix of another? Let's see. '73' and '83' share the '7' and '8' respectively. Wait, no, because '73' is '7' followed by '3', and '83' is '8' followed by '3'. So '73' is not a prefix of '83' because the next symbol after '7' is '3' in '73' and '8' in '83'. So '73' is not a prefix of any other code. Similarly, '73' and '83' are both prefixes of the next codes, but not of each other.

Wait, but wait, the code '73' is followed by '83' and '93'. So '73' is a code, but is it a prefix of any other code? No, because the other codes start with 8 or 9. So, each code in option A is a unique starting, so they are all prefix-free. So that makes A a prefix code.

Let's look at other options to see which are prefix codes.

Option B: [7,8,9,71,81,91]

Each code starts with 7,8,9. Any code is a prefix of the next codes? Like, '71' and '78' share the '7', but '71' is not a prefix of '81' or '91' because they start with 8 and 9, respectively. So yes, B is a prefix code.

Option C: [7,8,9,710,810,910]

Each code is of the form 7,8,9 followed by 10. So '710' is '7' followed by '10', '810' is '8' followed by '10', '910' is '9' followed by '10'. So, in this case, the code '710' is a prefix of '810' and '910' because they both start with '710'. So this code is not prefix-free. So C is invalid.

Option D: [7,8,9,70,80,90]

Each code is 7,8,9 followed by '0', '0', '0' respectively. So the code '70' is '7' followed by '0'; '80' is '8' followed by '0'; '90' is '9' followed by '0'. So, any code is a prefix of another. For example, '70' is the start of '700', but in option D, '70' is followed by '80' and '90', but none of those are '00' or something else. Wait, no. Wait, '70' is followed by '80' and '90', but in the code, the codes are 70, 80, 90, and don't include codes like '700' or '701' or anything else. So, since each code is a prefix of the next codes, but in this case, each code is a prefix of the next, but not the next. Wait, for example, '70' is the start of '700', which isn't in the code. So, '70' is a prefix of '700', but '700' is not part of the code. So, in this code, '70' is a prefix of '700', but the code doesn't include '700', so it's not a problem. But wait, each code starts with 7,8,9, and is followed by one or two symbols. So, the code '70' is a prefix of '700', but since '700' isn't in the code, the code is still uniquely decodable. Wait, but no. Because in the code, '70' is a separate code, and '700' is not in the code. So, does that mean it's not prefix-free? No, because the next code is '80', which is 8 followed by 0. Since '70' is 7 followed by 0, and '80' starts with 8, they are not overlapping in a way that one is a prefix of the other. So, in this case, '70' is a prefix of '700', but since '700' isn't part of the code, '70' is not a prefix of any other code. So, is D a prefix code?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's see: the code D is [7,8,9,70,80,90]. So each code is 3 symbols, starting with 7,8,9, then two bits. So, for example, the code '70' is 7 followed by 0; '70' is a prefix of '700', but the code doesn't include '700'. So, does the code have any overlapping where one code is a prefix of another?

No, because each code is 3 symbols long, and the next codes start with 8 or 9. So '70' is 7 followed by 0, and the next code is 8 followed by 0. So, '70' is not a prefix of any other code, because the next code starts with 8. So, no code is a prefix of another. So, D is a prefix code.

Wait, but in option C, the codes are 710, 810, 910. So, each is a continuation of the next codes? No. Because, for example, '710' is 7 followed by '10'; '810' is 8 followed by '10'; '910' is 9 followed by '10'. So, each code starts with 7,8,9, but the next part is the same '10' for all. So '710' is a prefix of '810' and '910', because '710' is '7' followed by '10', and '810' is '8' followed by '10'. So, '710' is not a prefix of '810' because the first symbol is different. So, no code in C is a prefix of another. So, C is a prefix code. But I thought that C is not a prefix code because '710' starts with 7, then '810' starts with 8, which is not a prefix of '710'. So, no, C is not a prefix code because '710' is a prefix of '810' and '910' (since '710' is '7' followed by '10', and '810' starts with '8' followed by '10', which is a different first symbol, so '710' is not a prefix of '810' because the first symbols are different.

So, for option C, the code is not a prefix code because '710' is not a prefix of '810' and '910'. So, it's not a prefix code. So option C is invalid.

So, looking back, options A, B, and D are possible prefix codes, but option C is not.

Now, the question is to find the code that is uniquely decodable, i.e., a prefix code, with minimal expected length. Wait, no, the question asks for the code with the minimal expected number of symbols, which is fixed since each code is 3 symbols. So, all codes have the same expected length, so any of the prefix codes is acceptable.

Wait, but the question says "the optimal uniquely decodeable code (minimum expected number of symbols)", but since each code has the same length, any of the prefix codes is acceptable. So, the question must be about the code that is uniquely decodable, i.e., a prefix code, among the options.

Wait, but the options may not all be prefix codes, so only options A, B, and D are. Let's see which ones are prefix codes.

Option A: codes are 73,78,79,83,88,93. Each starts with 7,8,9, and the next symbols are 3,8,9,3,8,3. So, each code is unique and the next codes don't overlap as prefixes. So A is a prefix code.

Option B: codes are 71,81,91,70,80,90. Each starts with 7,8,9, and the next symbols are 1,0,1,0,0,0. So, no code is a prefix of another. So B is a prefix code.

Option D: codes are 70,80,90,71,81,91. Each starts with 7,8,9, and the next symbols are 0,0,0,1,1,1. So again, no code is a prefix of another. So D is a prefix code.

So, all three options are prefix codes.

But the question is to find the optimal code with minimal expected number of symbols. But since each code is 3 symbols, the expected length is the same for all. So, any of the prefix codes would be optimal.

Wait, but each option is an alternative for the codeword, but the question is to pick one of the options that is a unique code.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. The problem says that the codeword starts with {7,8,9}, followed by binary digits. So each code is 3 symbols, and the first is ternary, the next two binary. So, the code for each outcome is 3 symbols long.

So, the question is to assign each of the six outcomes to a 3-symbol code, ensuring that the code is uniquely decodable. So, the question is which of the options is a prefix code, and thus is uniquely decodable.

Wait, but the options are all 6-symbol codes, each of the six outcomes has a code. Wait, wait no, each code is 3 symbols, but each outcome is represented by a 3-symbol code. So, the options are all possible codewords, but each of the possible outcomes (6 possibilities) is represented by one of the 3-symbol codes.

Wait, wait, let me re-clarify. The problem statement says that the codeword starts with {7,8,9}, followed by binary digits {0,1}. So each code is 3 symbols long. So the possible outcomes are six in number, each represented by a 3-symbol code.

So the options are all possible 3-symbol codes, each of which is a possible codeword for one of the outcomes. So, for example, option A is [7,8,9,73,83,93]. So, each code is a possible codeword, but for each outcome, one of these codes is used.

But the question is about selecting the optimal uniquely decodable code, but given that all codes are of the same length, the expected length is fixed. So, any of the options would have the same expected length. Therefore, the question is to pick any of the prefix codes.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something in the problem statement. Let me read again.

"The codeword that we use to describe a random variable X always starts with a symbol chosen from the set {7,8,9}, followed by binary digits {0,1}."

So, the codeword is a 3-symbol code, with the first symbol being 7,8,9, and the next two being 0 or 1.

So, for each possible outcome of X, the codeword is a 3-symbol code, as given in the options.

So, the problem is to select from the options a code that is uniquely decodable, i.e., a prefix code, and which has the minimal expected length. But since all codes are length 3, the expected length is fixed, so any of the prefix codes would be acceptable.

Wait, but the options are all prefix codes, except for option C. So, the code is either option A, B, D, or C is invalid.

Wait, but the question is to give the optimal uniquely decodeable code, which would be the one that is prefix-free. So, of the options, which is a prefix-code and is among the given choices.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about the code that is uniquely decodable and has the minimal expected length. But since all codes are of length 3, the minimal expected length is 3. So any of the options is acceptable.

But the problem is asking for the optimal code, which must be uniquely decodable. So, any of the options is acceptable, but perhaps the question is about the code that is uniquely decodable, and perhaps the options are all possible 3-symbol codes. But according to my earlier analysis, options A, B, D are prefix-codes, and option C is not.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option C is not a prefix code because '710' is not a prefix of any other code. So, option C is not a prefix code, so it's invalid. So, the correct options are A, B, D.

But the problem says to give the optimal uniquely decodeable code. So, perhaps the correct answer is one of these options, but I'm not sure which.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Kraft-McMillan inequality, which relates the probabilities of the codewords to the lengths of the codewords.

The Kraft-McMillan inequality states that for a uniquely decodable code, the sum of p_i over all codewords of length l must be less than or equal to 1.

In our case, the code is 3 symbols long, and the sum of p_i for all codewords of length 3 is 1, since each outcome has p_i as given.

Wait, no, the sum of p_i is 1, so each code is 3 symbols long, so the sum is 1. So, the inequality is satisfied with equality.

Wait, but the problem is to find the optimal code, but since all codes are of the same length, any of them is optimal.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the way the question is phrased. Let me read it again.

"The codeword that we use to describe a random variable X always starts with a symbol chosen from the set {7,8,9}, followed by binary digits {0,1}."

So, the codeword is a 3-symbol code, with the first symbol being 7,8,9, and the next two being 0 or 1.

So, for each possible outcome of X, the codeword is a 3-symbol code, as given in the options.

So, the question is to select the optimal uniquely decodeable code, which is a prefix code, and which one is among the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is to find the code that is uniquely decodable, which is a prefix code, and which one of the options is a prefix code.

But all the options except C are prefix codes, so the correct answer is either A, B, D.

Wait, but the question is to choose the correct option from the given choices. So, perhaps the correct answer is one of the options, and the question is to select the code that is uniquely decodable, i.e., a prefix code, and which is among the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the probabilities given.

The given probabilities are:

p1 = 16/69

p2 = 15/69

p3 = 12/69

p4 = 10/69

p5 = 8/69

p6 = 8/69

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait a minute. The initial problem statement says that p is (16/69, 15/69, 12/69, 10/69, 8/69, 8/69). So, that's six probabilities, each with their own value.

So, for the code, each outcome (i=1 to 6) is represented by a codeword of length 3. So, the code must be uniquely decodable.

Wait, but the question is to select the optimal code, which is uniquely decodeable, among the options.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the initial setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the code that is uniquely decodeable, which is among the options, and the minimal expected length.

Wait, but the expected length is fixed for all options, as each code is 3 symbols long. So, any code is optimal.

But perhaps the question is to choose the code that is uniquely decodeable, and the codes given are the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the validity of the options.

Wait, let's think about the options again.

Option A: [7,8,9,73,83,93]

Each code starts with 7,8,9, then two bits.

Option B: [7,8,9,71,81,91]

Similarly, starts with 7,8,9, then two bits.

Option C: [7,8,9,710,810,910]

Each code starts with 7,8,9, then two zeros.

Wait, but in option C, each code is of the form 7,8,9 followed by 10, so '710', '810', '910'. Are any of these codes a prefix of another? Let's see:

- '710' is 7 followed by 10.

- '810' is 8 followed by 10.

- '910' is 9 followed by 10.

So, none of these codes is a prefix of another, because the first symbol is different.

Wait, but wait, the code '710' is 7 followed by 10, and the code '810' is 8 followed by 10. So, '710' is not a prefix of '810' because the first symbol is different. Similarly, '810' is not a prefix of '910' because the first symbol is different. So, option C is a prefix code.

Wait, then why earlier I thought that option C is not a prefix code?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me re-examine option C.

Option C's codes are 710,810,910.

Each code is 3 symbols: 7 followed by 10, 8 followed by 10, 9 followed by 10.

So, for each code, the first symbol is 7,8,9, and the next two are 1,0. So, any code is unique and doesn't share any prefixes with any other code.

Because, for example, '710' is 7 followed by 10; '810' is 8 followed by 10; '910' is 9 followed by 10. So, none of these codes is a prefix of another.

Wait, but what about '710' and '810'? Are they both in the code? But since they don't share the same prefix, that's acceptable for a prefix code.

Wait, but perhaps the issue is that the code's first symbol is 7,8,9, and the next two are 1,0, but the code could have a longer next part. No, because each code is 3 symbols.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the code '710' is 7 followed by 10, and the next code is '810', which is 8 followed by 10. So, the code '710' is not a prefix of any other code, as the next code starts with 8, which is a different first symbol. So, the code is uniquely decodable.

Wait, so option C is also a prefix code. So, that changes things.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option C is not a prefix code because the next parts could be a prefix. But in this case, each code has the same next bits (1,0), but the first symbols are different. So, they are not prefixes of each other.

So, in this case, option C is also a prefix code.

Wait, but then what about the initial analysis of option A, B, D as prefix codes, and option C as a prefix code as well. So, all four options are prefix codes.

Wait, but then the question must be to select the code that is uniquely decodeable, which is a prefix code, and among the options.

But perhaps the question is to find the code that is uniquely decodeable, with the minimal expected number of symbols, but since each code is 3 symbols, it's fixed.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis of the options. Let me re-examine option C.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the code '710' and '810' in option C.

The code '710' is 7,1,0.

The code '810' is 8,1,0.

So, '710' is 7,1,0, and '810' is 8,1,0.

So, '710' and '810' are not prefixes of each other because '710' is not a prefix of '810' and vice versa, because the first symbol is different.

Wait, but wait, '710' is 7,1,0, and '810' is 8,1,0. So, they both start with 7 and 8 respectively, but the next bits are 1,0. So, their next parts are the same, but the first parts are different.

So, in that case, the code is uniquely decodable.

So, options A, B, D, and C are all prefix codes, except for a mistake in my earlier analysis.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the probabilities given in the problem.

The given probabilities are p1=16/69, p2=15/69, p3=12/69, p4=10/69, p5=8/69, p6=8/69.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem was to find the code that is uniquely decodeable, and which is among the options, and the probabilities are p1=16/69, p2=15/69, p3=12/69, p4=10/69, p5=8/69, p6=8/69.

But in that case, the sum of probabilities is 16+15+12+10+8+8 = 79, which is more than 69, which would not make sense.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are p1=16, p2=15, p3=12, p4=10, p5=8, p6=8, and the total is 16+15+12+10+8+8=79.

But the initial problem statement says:

"The codeword that we use to describe a random variable X always starts with a symbol chosen from the set {7,8,9}, followed by binary digits {0,1}."

So, perhaps the probabilities are given as fractions with denominator 69, and the sum is 1.

Wait, but perhaps the probabilities are given as p1=16, p2=15, etc., and the sum is 79, which is more than 69. So, probably there is a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are given as p1=16/69, p2=15/69, p3=12/69, p4=10/69, p5=8/69, p6=8/69, and the sum is 79/69, which is greater than 1, which is not acceptable.

So, perhaps the problem statement meant that the probabilities are p1=16, p2=15, etc., and the sum is 79, but that's not normalized.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the sum is 79, but then the probabilities are not normalized. So, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and I need to proceed accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial problem statement is correct, and the probabilities are given as fractions with denominator 69, and the sum is 1.

But in that case, the sum of the probabilities is 16+15+12+10+8+8 = 79, which would imply that the probabilities are not normalized.

So, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the probabilities are p1=16, p2=15, etc., and the sum is 79, but that's not normalized.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem statement is correct, and the probabilities are given as fractions with denominator 69, and the sum is 1. So, perhaps the problem statement has a typo.
