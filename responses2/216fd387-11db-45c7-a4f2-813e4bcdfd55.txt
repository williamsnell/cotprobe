Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the martian meteorite ALH84001 and which of the options wasn't cited as evidence for its existence. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me a list of ten options (A to J) and asks which was NOT cited as evidence. I remember that ALH84001 is a meteorite from the Martian asteroid 84001. The options mostly refer to various materials found in the meteorite.

Option A: Amino acids with a preferred orientation or "chirality." I recall that some meteorites have "crystalline chiral grains," like the ones on the Moon. These grains have a preferred orientation, which is related to their chirality. So A is cited, so it's not the answer.

Option B: Magnetite grains similar to those formed by bacteria on Earth. Magnetite is a magnetic material, and I think some meteorites have magnetic grains. Since magnetite is a type of iron oxide, I believe they were found in ALH84001. So B is cited, so not the answer.

Option C: Methane traces. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. I think some meteorites, especially those from explosive events, have methane. ALH84001 was ejected by a meteorite, so maybe it has methane. C is cited, so not the answer.

Option D: High levels of sulfur. Sulfur is a good indicator of volcanic activity. If a meteorite was ejected by a volcano, it would have high sulfur. ALH84001 was from an explosive event, so D is cited, so not the answer.

Option E: Detection of radio signals. I'm not sure about this one. I think radio signals from space are rare, but some meteorites might have signals. Alternatively, some meteorites might be from events that can detect them, like supernovae or other space events. But I'm not certain if E is cited as evidence.
 
Option F: Carbonate minerals indicating a thicker warmer Martian atmosphere. I'm not sure. I've read that some meteorites have mineral-rich surfaces, but I don't think they necessarily indicate a thicker, warmer atmosphere. More about the composition of the surface and maybe the presence of certain minerals. So F might not be cited, meaning it's the answer. But I need to check the other options.

Option G: Presence of water-ice. If a meteorite has water, that suggests it was from a space event. ALH84001 was ejected by an explosive event (like a meteor or asteroid), so water-ice is a strong indicator. G is cited, so not the answer.

Option H: Presence of olivine, a common mineral in Martian meteorites. I remember olivine is a common texture in many Martian meteorites. So H is cited, not the answer.

Option I: Fossilized microbial life forms. Fossils from microorganisms would indicate that the meteorite was exposed to life. But ALH84001 is ejected from a meteor (which is explosive), so it probably doesn't have any microbial life. So I is cited? Or not? Wait, the options are about whether the material was cited as evidence. If the meteorite doesn't contain such life, then I is not cited as evidence. So if I is an option, then it's the correct answer.

Option J: Complex organic molecules specifically PAHs. PAHs are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are common in some meteorites, like the ones from the early solar system. ALH84001 might have some, but I'm not certain if this is a strong evidence for its existence. Maybe it's something they found, but perhaps it's not as strong as other evidence.

Wait, going back to option E: detection of radio signals. I'm not sure if that's cited. Maybe the meteorite was observed from space, but I think that's more of a possibility. Alternatively, I'm not sure if ALH84001 was observed for radio signals. I think that's a less common piece of evidence. 

So the options are about which was NOT cited. So if E is not cited, that would be the answer. Let me think if any meteorites have radio signals. I don't remember that being a standard part of their identification. The more common pieces are the ones I've listed.

So the options that are cited are A, B, C, D, G, H, J (if PAHs are cited). The only one not cited is E. So the answer would be E: Detection of radio signals.

The question asks which piece of evidence was NOT cited for ALH84001. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **A: Amino acids with a preferred orientation** — Cited, as they are part of the "crystalline chiral grains" found in ALH84001.
- **B: Magnetite grains** — Cited, as these are typical in the meteorite.
- **C: Methane traces** — Cited, as ALH84001 may have methane due to explosive origin.
- **D: Sulfur levels** — Cited, indicating volcanic activity.
- **E: Radio signals** — Not cited, as this is less common evidence.
- **F: Carbonate minerals** — Not cited, as this is not a standard piece of evidence.
- **G: Water-ice** — Cited, as ALH84001 likely contains water.
- **H: Olivine** — Cited, as olivine is a common mineral in Martian meteorites.
- **I: Fossil microbial life** — Not cited, as the meteorite is ejected from a meteorite, not exposed to life.
- **J: PAHs** — Cited, as they are common in some meteorites.

The only option not cited is **E: Detection of radio signals**. 

**ANSWER: E**
