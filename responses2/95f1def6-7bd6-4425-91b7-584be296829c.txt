Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this question about the resynthesis time of phosphocreatine after high-intensity exercise. Hmm, I remember that resynthesis is when the muscle is rebuilt from its components, like its fibres and their enzymes. High-intensity exercise usually causes a lot of muscle damage, so the body has to repair it quickly.

Wait, I also recall that muscles, especially those that are strong and can be rebuilt, might take less time for resynthesis. Maybe it's shorter than some other tissues. I've heard that the brain also has some muscle-like tissue, so maybe the brain's resynthesis is faster. Or is it the rest of the body?

I think the resynthesis time varies. For example, in a study I remember, it took around 2 minutes for the brain. But I'm not sure about other muscles. Let me think, after exercise, the muscles are stressed, so they need a quick fix. I've heard that in some cases, the resynthesis can take about 2 minutes. So looking at the options, D is about 2 minutes, which might be the correct answer.

Wait, what about the brain? I think the brain's resynthesis takes a bit less time, maybe around 1-2 minutes. But the question is about the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine, which is a protein in muscle fibers. So it's more about the muscle parts, like the fibres and the enzymes. So perhaps it's 2 minutes, which would make D the answer.

The correct answer is D: about 2 minutes. This aligns with the typical time taken for the resynthesis of muscle components, such as phosphocreatine, after high-intensity exercise.

Answer: D
