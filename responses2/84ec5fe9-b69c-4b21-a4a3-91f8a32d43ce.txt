Okay, so I have this math problem here where I need to find 3^(3^(3^3)) mod 100. Hmm, that looks pretty intense. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I know that when dealing with exponents modulo some number, Euler's theorem can be useful. But wait, I should remember the exact conditions. Oh right, Euler's theorem says that if two numbers are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n, where φ is Euler's totient function. Since 3 and 100 are coprime (their GCD is 1), maybe I can use this.

So, φ(100) is the number of integers less than 100 that are coprime to 100. Since 100 is 2² * 5², φ(100) = 100 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 100 * 1/2 * 4/5 = 100 * 2/5 = 40. So φ(100) is 40. That means 3^40 ≡ 1 mod 100.

Now, the exponent here is 3^(3^3). Let's compute that. 3^3 is 27, so the exponent is 3^27. So the original expression is 3^(3^27) mod 100. Since φ(100) is 40, 3^40 ≡ 1 mod 100, and so any exponent can be taken modulo 40.

So, I need to compute 3^27 mod 40 because 3^40 ≡ 1 mod 100 implies that 3^k mod 100 is the same as 3^(k mod 40) mod 100. So, let's compute 3^27 mod 40.

Wait, 3^1 is 3 mod 40 is 3. 3^2 is 9. 3^3 is 27. 3^4 is 81 mod 40 is 1. Oh wait, 3^4 is 81, which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 40. So 3^4 ≡ 1 mod 40. That's a key point.

So if 3^4 ≡ 1 mod40, then 3^(4k) ≡ 1 mod40. So any exponent that's a multiple of 4 can be replaced by 1 mod40. Now, 3^27 is what? Let's see, 27 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 3. So 3^27 = 3^(4*6 +3) = (3^4)^6 * 3^3. Since 3^4 ≡1, this becomes 1^6 *27 ≡27 mod40. So 3^27 ≡27 mod40.

So now, the exponent in 3^(3^27) is 27 mod40 is 27. So the original expression is 3^27 mod100. Wait, no, because I think I got that backwards. Wait, 3^(3^27) mod100. Let me correct that.

Wait, no, the exponent 3^27 mod φ(100)=40 is 27, so 3^(3^27) mod100 is the same as 3^(27) mod100. Because 3^40≡1 mod100, so any exponent can be reduced modulo φ(100)=40. So I need to compute 3^27 mod100.

So now compute 3^27 mod100. Let me compute this step by step, perhaps using exponentiation by squaring.

3^1 =3 mod100
3^2=9 mod100
3^3=27 mod100
3^4=81 mod100
3^5=3^4 *3 =81*3=243 mod100=43
3^6=43 *3=129 mod100=29
3^7=29*3=87 mod100
3^8=87*3=261 mod100=61
3^9=61*3=183 mod100=83
3^10=83*3=249 mod100=49
3^11=49*3=147 mod100=47
3^12=47*3=141 mod100=41
3^13=41*3=123 mod100=23
3^14=23*3=69 mod100
3^15=69*3=207 mod100=7
3^16=7*3=21 mod100
3^17=21*3=63 mod100
3^18=63*3=189 mod100=89
3^19=89*3=267 mod100=67
3^20=67*3=201 mod100=1
Wait, 3^20 is 1 mod100? That's interesting. So the cycle for exponents of 3 mod100 has a period of 20. So exponents repeat every 20.

Wait, but earlier when I computed 3^4 was 1 mod40, but mod100, the period is 20. So I need to find 3^27 mod100.

But since 3^20≡1 mod100, 3^27 can be written as 3^(20 +7) = (3^20)(3^7) ≡ 1 *3^7 mod100. And from earlier, 3^7 was 87 mod100. So 3^27 ≡87 mod100.

Wait, but let me double-check that because I might have made a mistake in calculating 3^20.

Wait, I thought 3^20 mod100 is 1, but let me recompute.

3^1:3 mod100
3^2:9
3^3:27
3^4:81
3^5:81*3=243 mod100=43
3^6:43*3=129 mod100=29
3^7:29*3=87 mod100=87
3^8:87*3=261 mod100=61
3^9:61*3=183 mod100=83
3^10:83*3=249 mod100=49
3^11:49*3=147 mod100=47
3^12:47*3=141 mod100=41
3^13:41*3=123 mod100=23
3^14:23*3=69 mod100=69
3^15:69*3=207 mod100=7
3^16:7*3=21 mod100=21
3^17:21*3=63 mod100=63
3^18:63*3=189 mod100=89
3^19:89*3=267 mod100=67
3^20:67*3=201 mod100=1

Ah, so 3^20 is indeed 1 mod100. Therefore, 3^27 is 3^(20+7)= (3^20)(3^7) ≡1 *87 mod100=87.

So 3^27 mod100 is 87. Therefore, the original expression is 3^(3^27) mod100, which would be 3^27 mod100, which is 87. Wait, that can't be right because that's what I just got for 3^27 mod100. Wait, but wait, earlier I thought the exponent is 3^27, so 3^(3^27) mod100 is same as 3^(27) mod100 because 3^40≡1 mod100. So the exponent reduces mod40, which gave us 27. So the original expression is 3^27 mod100=87.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me go back.

The original expression is 3^(3^(3^3)) mod100. So, 3^3 is 27, then 3^27, then 3^27.

Wait, no, wait. 3^(3^3) is 3^27. So the exponent is 27, so the expression is 3^27 mod100. And as I said, 3^20 ≡1, so 3^27 is 3^(20 +7) = 1 * 3^7 = 87 mod100.

So the answer is 87. Looking at the options, option C is 87, so that's the answer.

The problem is to compute 3^(3^(3^3)) mod 100. By breaking it down, we find that 3^3 = 27, so the exponent becomes 3^27. Using Euler's theorem, since φ(100) = 40, we reduce the exponent 3^27 mod 40. Since 3^4 ≡ 1 mod 40, 3^27 ≡ 3^(27 mod 4) ≡ 3^3 ≡ 27 mod 40. Therefore, 3^27 mod 100 is computed. Knowing that 3^20 ≡ 1 mod 100, we find 3^27 ≡ 3^7 ≡ 87 mod 100. Thus, the result is 87.

Answer: C: 87
