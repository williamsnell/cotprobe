Okay, so I have this problem about capacitors and capacitive reactance. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my electronics class. Oh right, capacitive reactance is the opposition a capacitor has to the alternating current in a circuit.

The formula for capacitive reactance, XC, is XC = 1/(2πfC), where f is the frequency and C is the capacitance. Wait, but wait, I think there's another way to write that formula. Oh right, rearranging the formula, C equals 1/(2πfXc). That makes sense because if XC is higher, the capacitance is lower, which matches what I know. 

So the problem says the capacitor offers 25 ohms of capacitive reactance in a 400 cps (which I think is cycles per second, so that's the frequency). So f is 400 cps. I need to find C in microfarads.

Let me plug the numbers into the formula. So C equals 1 divided by (2 * π * f * Xc). Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait a second, the units. Oh, right, the formula is in hertz, not cps. Oh wait, but 400 cps is the same as 400 Hz because cps and Hz are the same unit. So no problem there.

Wait, wait, the formula is C = 1/(2 * π * f * Xc). But wait, wait, wait, no, it's XC equals 1/(2πfC), so solving for C gives me C = 1/(2πf XC). Wait, but wait, oh no, wait, no. Because XC is 1/(2πfC), so to get C, it's 1/(2πf XC). Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no, wait. Let me write the formula correctly. XC = 1/(2πf C). So solving for C: C = 1/(2πf XC). Oh wait, no. Wait, if XC = 1/(2πf C), then C = 1/(2πf XC). Wait, no, that's not right. Because if XC = 1/(2πf C), then C = 1/(2πf XC). Wait, that can't be right because if XC is large, C would be small. Wait, but if C increases, XC decreases. So higher XC means lower C.

Wait, let me make sure. Let me solve the equation step by step. 

Given: XC = 25 ohms, f = 400 Hz.

We have XC = 1/(2πf C)

So rearranged, C = 1/(2πf XC).

Wait no, wait: 25 = 1/(2 * π * 400 * C)

So solve for C: 25 = 1/(800 π C). Because 2π * 400 is 800.

So 25 = 1/(800π C)

Inverting both sides: 1/25 = 800π C

So C = 1/(25 * 800 π)

Wait, that seems really small. Let me compute that.

Wait wait, 25 * 800 is 20,000. So C is 1/(20,000 π) Farads.

Wait, but that's in farads. The options are microfarads, so I need to convert.

Wait, 1 μF is 1e-6 F. So let's compute the value.

20,000 * π ≈ 62832 (since π≈3.1416, 20,000 * 3.1416 ≈ 62,832).

So C ≈ 1 / 62,832 ≈ 1.5917e-5 F.

Convert that to microfarads: 1.5917e-5 F is 15.917 microfarads.

Looking at the options: the closest is option H, 20 microfarads? Wait, no, let me check the options.

Wait the options are:

A: 18, B:30, C:8, D:20, E:25, F:16, G:10, H:22, I:12, J:14.

Wait, 15.9 is closest to 16 microfarads. But option F is 16. But wait, wait, wait, did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I flipped the formula somewhere.

XC = 25 ohms. f=400 Hz.

XC = 1/(2πfC) → C = 1/(2πf XC)

Wait, no. Wait, 25 = 1/(2 * π * 400 * C) → 25 = 1/(800π C)

So, 800 π C = 1 /25 → C = 1/(25 *800 π ) → 1/(20,000 π ) → approximately 1/62832 ≈ 1.59e-5 F → 15.9 microFarad.

The closest option is F:16. But wait, let me check the options again. Oh, the options are A to J. Let me see:

Options:

A:18

B:30

C:8

D:20

E:25

F:16

G:10

H:22

I:12

J:14

So 15.9 is closer to 16 than to 12 or 20. So the answer should be F:16 microfarads.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the initial formula? Because I've heard that maybe the formula is sometimes written as XC = (1/(2πf)) * (1/C), which would be the same as 1/(2πf C). So that's correct.

Wait, so the calculation leads to C ≈16 μF. So the answer should be F.

To determine the capacitance of the capacitor, we use the formula for capacitive reactance:

\[
XC = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}
\]

Rearranging for \(C\), we get:

\[
C = \frac{1}{2\pi f XC}
\]

Given:
- \(XC = 25 \, \Omega\)
- \(f = 400 \, \text{Hz}\)

Substitute the values:

\[
C = \frac{1}{2\pi \cdot 400 \cdot 25}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
2\pi \cdot 400 \cdot 25 = 2 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 400 \cdot 25 = 62,832
\]

So,

\[
C = \frac{1}{62,832} \approx 1.59 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{F}
\]

Convert to microfarads (\(1 \, \mu\text{F} = 10^{-6} \, \text{F}\)):

\[
C \approx 15.9 \, \mu\text{F}
\]

The closest option to \(15.9 \, \mu\text{F}\) is \(16 \, \mu\text{F}\), which corresponds to option F.
