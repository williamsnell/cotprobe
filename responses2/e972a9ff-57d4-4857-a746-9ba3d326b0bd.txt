Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

In what ways has conflict been a concern of the environmental security agenda for strong states?

Options:

A: The concern of the environmental security agenda for strong states is not conflict but rather the preservation of resources for future generations.
B: Conflict over environmental resources is primarily a concern for weak states, not strong ones.
C: There is a direct link between environmental degradation and violent conflict, but this is not a concern for strong states due to their ability to manage resources effectively.
D: Environmental degradation can create conflict within a state, but this is not a concern for strong states as they have the resources to manage these changes.
E: Analysis of environmental violence research shows that there is a tendency among 'strong states' to be less prone to internal violent conflicts whereas states undergoing significant economic and political transitions are more prone to violent conflict. Environmental change is unlikely to be a cause of war but can be a contributory factor.
F: Strong states do not face the risk of conflict due to environmental changes, as they have the ability to mitigate the effects of these changes.
G: The environmental security agenda for strong states is not concerned with conflict, as these states have sufficient resources to manage environmental changes.
H: Common findings in research organizations investigating environmental violence have failed to find quantifiable relationships between environmental and social variables and the cause of war. Analysis of aggregated data failed to establish a common causal mechanism. The extensity of possible variables being simply too vast, mitigating any definitive relationship.
I: Population growth and its relationship to environmental degradation can lead to environmentally caused conflict. There is therefore a linear link between population growth and environmental change, and environmental change is the critical determinant in the production of violence.

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about environmental security agendas and conflict. Hmm. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking about how conflict has been a concern of the environmental security agenda for strong states. The options are A to I.

First, I should recall what environmental security agendas are. From what I remember, these are policies that aim to protect the environment from external or internal threats. Strong states would likely have such agendas because they're more established or have more resources.

Now, about conflicts. Environmental security agendas, as I understand, are concerned about environmental degradation rather than just resource preservation. So conflict as a primary concern might not be right. Looking at the options:

Option A says conflict is not a concern but preservation. That might be correct because some agendas focus on ensuring resources are available for future generations, not directly causing conflict.

Option B says conflict primarily concerns weak states. Wait, the question is about strong states. So if strong states' agendas are focused on environmental security, perhaps they are less concerned about conflict. But Option B says weak states have this, and strong don't. So B might not be correct.

Option C claims there's a direct link between environmental degradation and conflict, but this isn't a concern for strong states because they can manage resources. Hmm. But if the agenda is about environmental security, maybe they're worried that if resources are used for environmental issues, they might conflict with other areas. So this could be possible. But I'm not sure.

Option D says environmental degradation can create conflict, but strong states aren't a concern because they have resources. Wait, if strong states are part of the environment's security, wouldn't they be more worried about environmental changes leading to conflict? So D might be saying that strong states are not a concern because their focus is on resource management, not conflict.

Option E talks about strong states being less prone to conflict due to environmental issues, but the reasoning is about not being a cause of war. It says environmental change is a contributory factor but not the cause. So this is about the possibility of conflict, maybe.

Option F says strong states don't face environmental changes as a threat. Instead, they can manage it. So conflict is not a concern. That aligns with option G.

Wait, option G says the agenda isn't concerned with conflict because strong states have enough resources. So option G would be correct if that's the case.

Option H suggests that no relationships were found between environmental and social variables in causing war. So it's a finding from research that no clear causal link exists. If that's the case, then environmental changes aren't the cause of conflict, so any such conflict is not a concern.

Wait, looking back at the question, it's about whether conflict is a concern for strong states under the environmental security agenda.

So, perhaps options C and G are possibilities. Let me think again.

Option C says there's a direct link between environmental degradation and conflict, but that's not a concern for strong states. So it's not a concern, but there's a link. But the question is about concerns. So if option C is saying no, because strong states aren't a concern, then that's not the right answer.

Option G says the agenda isn't concerned with conflict because strong states have enough resources. So that would mean that the environmental security agenda doesn't include any concern for conflict. So the correct answer would be G.

Wait, but what about option E? It talks about the possibility of conflict due to environmental change, but environmental change isn't the cause. So E is not correct because the concern is about the idea that environmental change is a cause, not the direct link.

Option F says strong states don't face conflict because they can manage the changes. So F is a possibility, but the question is about the agenda's concerns.

So, the key is, which option correctly identifies that environmental security agendas don't have conflict as a primary concern because strong states can manage it.

So, looking at the options:

Option G says: The environmental security agenda for strong states is not concerned with conflict, as these states have sufficient resources to manage environmental changes.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is G.
</think>

The correct answer is G. The environmental security agenda for strong states is not concerned with conflict because these states have sufficient resources to manage environmental changes. This aligns with the understanding that strong states focus on preserving resources and ensuring future generations' needs without directly addressing environmental conflicts. 

Answer: G
