Question:

For small, slowly falling objects, the assumption made in the text that the drag force is proportional to the velocity is a good one. For larger, more rapidly falling objects, it is more accurate to assume that the drag force is proportional to the square of the velocity.  If m = 10 kg, find the drag coefficient so that the limiting velocity is 49 m/s.

Options:

A: $\frac{8}{49}$
B: $\frac{6}{49}$
C: $\frac{1}{7}$
D: $\frac{2}{49}$
E: $\frac{5}{49}$
F: $\frac{7}{49}$
G: $\frac{1}{49}$
H: $\frac{1}{98}$
I: $\frac{3}{49}$
J: $\frac{4}{49}$

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about drag force and limiting velocity. Hmm, let me think. The question says that for small objects, the drag force is proportional to velocity, and for larger ones, it's proportional to velocity squared. We're given m equals 10 kg and the limiting velocity is 49 m/s. I need to find the drag coefficient, and the options are all fractions with 49 in the denominator or something like that.

Wait, I remember that limiting velocity is when the drag force equals the gravitational force. Oh right, because at that point, the object isn't accelerating anymore. So the forces balance each other out. The gravitational force should be mg, where m is mass and g is acceleration due to gravity, I think around 9.8 m/s².

So the drag force is given by either F_d = bv or F_d = bv², depending on the size. Oh wait, the problem statement says for small objects, F_d is proportional to v, so the constant is b. For larger objects, F_d is proportional to v squared, so the constant is another, like c.

So in this problem, since the limit velocity is 49 m/s, both cases would apply, but it's given that the assumption is that for larger objects, F_d is proportional to v², so maybe we're considering the larger case here.

Wait, but the problem says for small, F_d is proportional to v. For larger, it's v squared. So in this case, the object is larger, so F_d is proportional to v squared. So, F_d is c v², and m g is mg.

Setting F_d equal to mg at the limit velocity:

c v² = m g.

So I can solve for c.

Given m is 10 kg, g is 9.8 m/s², v is 49 m/s.

So c = (m g) / (v²).

Let me calculate that.

m =10 kg, g=9.8, v=49.

So 10 *9.8 = 98. Then 49 squared is 49*49. Let me compute that: 50^2 is 2500, so 49^2 is 2401.

Wait, 49^2 is 2401, yes.

So c = 98 / (49^2) = 98 /2401.

Wait, 98 divided by 2401. Let's see. 2401 divided by 98 is 24.5, because 98 *24 = 2352, 98*24.5 = 2352 + 49 = 2401. So 98/2401 is 1/24.5. But 24.5 is 49/2. So 1/24.5 = 2/49.

Wait, because 1/(49/2) = 2/49. So c is 2/49.

Looking at the options, option D is 2/49. So the answer should be D. But wait, let me make sure I didn't get the setup wrong.

Wait, wait, wait. Because the drag force being proportional to v squared is for larger objects. So when the object is large, the drag is v². So in that case, F_d = c v².

At the limit, F_d = mg, so c = (mg)/(v²).

So with m=10kg, v=49 m/s, g=9.8, so let's plug in the numbers.

10 *9.8 = 98. 49^2 = 2401. 98 /2401 = 98/(49*49) = (2*49)/(49^2) )= 2/49.

Yes, that's correct. So the drag coefficient c is 2/49. So the correct option is D.

To determine the drag coefficient \( c \) for a larger, more rapidly falling object, we use the relationship between the limiting velocity \( v \), mass \( m \), and gravitational acceleration \( g \). At the limit of velocity, the drag force \( F_d \) equals the gravitational force \( mg \). For larger objects, the drag force is proportional to the square of the velocity, so \( F_d = c v^2 \). Setting \( F_d = mg \), we solve for \( c \):

\[
c = \frac{mg}{v^2}.
\]

Substituting the given values \( m = 10 \, \text{kg} \), \( v = 49 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \):

\[
c = \frac{10 \cdot 9.8}{49^2}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
10 \cdot 9.8 = 98.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
49^2 = 2401.
\]

Thus, \( c \) becomes:

\[
c = \frac{98}{2401}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by recognizing that \( 2401 = 49^2 \) and \( 98 = 2 \cdot 49 \):

\[
c = \frac{2 \cdot 49}{49^2} = \frac{2}{49}.
\]

Therefore, the drag coefficient \( c \) is \( \frac{2}{49} \), which corresponds to option D.
