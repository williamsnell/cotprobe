Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of car Burt Reynolds drove in the movie 'Smokey and the Bandit'. Let me think about this step by step. 

First, I remember that Burt Reynolds is a character from the movie, but I'm not exactly sure which car he drove. I think he was a famous motorcycle rider, but I'm trying to recall if he had a car in the movie as well. 

I've heard that Burt Reynolds is also a bit of a motor racing enthusiast, so maybe he had some racing cars. But I'm not sure of the exact ones. Let me think about the options provided. The options are a Lamborghini, Transam, Rolls Royce, Ferrari, Mustang, Dodge Charger, Camaro, Porsche, Aston Martin, and Corvette. 

I'm trying to remember if any of these were part of the movie. I'm pretty sure that in 'Smokey and the Bandit', Burt Reynolds is driving a motorcycle. I think he had a specific model. Oh wait, I think he had a Rolls Royce. That's one of the options, option C. I've come across references before where it's mentioned that in the movie, he uses a Rolls Royce Phantom. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I mixed up the models. Let me double-check. I recall that in the movie, Burt is driving a Rolls Royce Phantom. So yes, the correct answer should be option C: Rolls Royce. 

I don't think he used a more expensive model like a Lamborghini or a Ferrari. Those were more for racing or maybe other films. The options like AMC, Dodge Charger, or others don't ring a bell as the primary vehicle in that movie. So I'm pretty confident that the answer is C.
