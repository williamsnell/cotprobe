Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work it out step by step.

First, the question gives me the half-cell reaction: AgCl(s) + e⁻ → Ag(s) + Cl⁻(aq). The standard reduction potential E° is given as +0.222 V. Also, the standard reduction potential for AgCl is provided as μ°(AgCl, s) = -109.71 kJ/mol. Wait, wait, standard reduction potential is usually given in volts, but the value here is in kJ per mole. Oh, right, I remember that the standard reduction potential is often given in V, but here they're using kJ. So I need to be careful with units.

Wait, I think I need to convert the given μ° into volts because E° is in volts. Or maybe I can relate these directly. Alternatively, I can find the standard Gibbs energy using the formula involving E° and the number of electrons involved.

Wait, the formula that connects standard Gibbs energy change (ΔG°) with the cell potential (E°) is ΔG° = -nFE°, where F is Faraday's constant and n is the number of moles of electrons transferred. But wait, wait, because this is a reduction reaction, and I'm not sure if it's the one being used as the cell reaction. Oh, right, for reduction potentials, the formula is usually ΔG° = -nFE°, where E is the E° for the cell reaction.

Wait, but this is a half-reaction, the reduction of AgCl. So the question gives the standard reduction potential for AgCl as μ° = -109.71 kJ/mol. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh, I think the μ° is the standard reduction potential for the substance. So for AgCl, the standard reduction potential is -109.71 kJ/mol. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms here. Let me clarify.

Wait, the standard reduction potential for a substance is the potential it has when it's reduced to its elemental form. So for AgCl, the reduction would be AgCl(s) + e⁻ → Ag(s) + Cl⁻(aq), right? And the E° for that is given as -109.71 kJ/mol. Wait, but wait, the units here are a bit confusing. Because typically, E° is in volts. So perhaps the μ° in the question is given in kJ per mole, but I might have to convert it to volts first.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to convert because the formula I'm thinking of uses E° in volts. Hmm, but if the given μ° is in kJ, I'll have to convert it to volts.

Wait, let's reevaluate. The formula for Gibbs energy is ΔG° = -nFE°, where E is the standard cell potential in volts. But wait, wait, in this case, the cell reaction is the reduction of AgCl to Ag and Cl⁻. So E° for the cell reaction is the same as the given μ°, which is -109.71 kJ/mol. But wait, that would be in kJ, so I need to convert to volts.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. Oh, right! The formula I'm using is ΔG° = -n F E°, but E° should be in volts. So first, I need to convert the given μ° from kJ to volts.

Wait, but I'm a little confused. Let me get this straight. The standard reduction potential for AgCl is given as μ°(AgCl, s) = -109.71 kJ/mol. So that's probably the E° for the reduction of AgCl. So the reaction is AgCl(s) + e⁻ → Ag(s) + Cl⁻(aq). So the E° for this reaction is -109.71 kJ/mol. But wait, that seems really low because I thought the standard reduction potential for AgCl is positive. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the standard reduction potential is usually positive for reduction reactions. So if AgCl is being reduced, it's more likely to be a good reducing agent. Wait, but in the given data, the reduction potential is -109.71 kJ/mol. That's a negative value. Hmm, that might indicate that the reaction is not spontaneous as written.

Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me clarify. The standard reduction potential is the tendency for a substance to gain electrons (be reduced) as a species. If the E° is negative, that means the reaction as written (AgCl + e⁻ → Ag + Cl⁻) is not spontaneous. So perhaps the correct way to write the half-reaction is the reverse, where Ag is oxidized and Cl⁻ is reduced.

Wait, let me think. For the half-reaction as written, the reaction is AgCl(s) + e⁻ → Ag(s) + Cl⁻(aq). The E° for this is given as -109.71 kJ/mol. That suggests that the reaction as written is not spontaneous because E° is negative. So the reverse would be spontaneous.

But wait, the problem is to find the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻. So perhaps I should think about the process where Cl⁻ is formed from its ions, maybe as part of a solution.

Wait, let me approach this step by step.

The problem says: calculate the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq). Cl⁻ is the conjugate base of Cl⁻(aq) in solution, but wait, no, Cl⁻ is a strong base and should be a spectator ion in solution. Wait, but the question is about the formation of Cl⁻ as a product in the formation of the compound. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the species.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the formation of Cl⁻ as part of the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the standard Gibbs energy of formation refers to the molar formation of Cl⁻ when it's in its standard state, which is probably Cl⁻(aq) in solution. But wait, the standard Gibbs energy of formation is for the element in its standard state, so Cl⁻(aq) isn't an element—it's a solution. Hmm, but perhaps the question is about the formation of Cl⁻ as part of the compound AgCl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the question is about the standard Gibbs energy change for the formation of the chloride ion from its ions. But the standard Gibbs energy of formation is for the compound, not the ions. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, let's re-examine the question. It says: calculate the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq). So that's the ΔGf° for Cl⁻(aq). But Cl⁻ is a product of the dissolution of AgCl. So perhaps the approach is to look at the formation of Cl⁻ from Cl⁻(aq) in solution, but maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the overall reaction. The half-cell reaction is the reduction of AgCl to Ag and Cl⁻. But to form Cl⁻, perhaps it's the reverse of this reaction. So the reverse reaction would be Ag(s) + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s) + e⁻. But that's the reverse of the given reaction. So if the given reaction has a negative E°, then the reverse would have a positive E°. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relationship between the cell potential and the Gibbs energy. The formula is ΔG° = -n F E°, but E° is in volts. So I need to convert the given μ° into volts.

Wait, but the given μ° is μ°(AgCl, s) = -109.71 kJ/mol. Wait, I'm confused. The standard reduction potential is given as a value in kJ/mol, which is kind of unconventional. I think I must have misunderstood the units here. Let me find the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using μ° for the reduction reaction, so E° is -109.71 kJ/mol. But I'm not certain about that. Let me try to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula ΔG° = -n F E°, where E° is the cell potential in volts. So let's first find the E° for this reaction.

Wait, the given E° is for the reduction of AgCl, which is -109.71 kJ/mol. But that's the value for the reaction AgCl + e⁻ → Ag + Cl⁻. So E° for that reaction is -109.71 kJ/mol. But that's a large negative value, which suggests that the reaction is not spontaneous. So the cell potential is negative.

Wait, but if I'm using this reaction as the one being used in the calculation, then E° is -109.71 kJ/mol. Wait, but that's a bit strange. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the given μ° into volts. Because I know that 1 kJ is 1000 J. Faraday's constant F is 96485 C/mol.

Let me compute E° in volts. So μ° is -109.71 kJ/mol. So E° = (-109.71 kJ/mol) * (1000 J/kJ) / (1 mol) * (1 V / 96485 C) * (1 mol / 1 mol) )

Wait, the formula is E° (V) = (μ° (kJ/mol) × 1000 J/(kJ) ) / (F) ) × 1 (unit) ? Wait, let me write it properly.

E° = μ° (kJ/mol) × (1000 J/kJ) / (96485 C/mol) × (1 V / 1 J/C) )

Wait, no, because J is charge (C·V). So 1 J = 1 C·V. So 1 V = 1 J/C. So,

E° (V) = (μ° (kJ/mol)) × (1000 J/kJ) / (96485 C/mol) × (1 V / (1 C·V)) )

Wait, this seems a bit messy. Let me compute it step by step.

μ°(AgCl, s) = -109.71 kJ/mol.

E° = (-109.71 kJ/mol) × (1000 J/kJ) / (96485 C/mol) × (1 V / (1 C·V)) )

Wait, let me break it down:

First, 1 kJ = 1000 J, so -109.71 kJ = -109710 J.

Then, E° in volts = ( -109710 J ) / (96485 C )

So 109710 / 96485 is approximately 1.137. So E° ≈ -1.137 V.

Wait, that's interesting because the E° is about -1.137 V. Wait, but that's a more reasonable value. So I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Oh, wait, I think I confused the units earlier. So the correct way is to convert the μ° from kJ to volts.

So, E° (voltage) = (μ° in kJ/mol) × (1000 J/kJ) / F (C/mol)

So, E° = (-109.71 kJ/mol) × (1000 J/kJ) / (96485 C/mol)

So, E° = (-109710 J) / 96485 C → approximately -1.137 V.

Wait, but wait, that's a negative value. So E° is -1.137 V.

Okay, now with that, I can use the formula ΔG° = -n F E°, where n is the number of moles of electrons involved.

Wait, but wait, what is n here? The reaction is AgCl(s) + e⁻ → Ag(s) + Cl⁻(aq). So the reaction accepts one electron (since it's a reduction). So n is 1.

So ΔG° = -1 * 96485 C/mol * (-1.137 V) → Let's compute this.

Wait, the formula is ΔG° = -n F E°, where E° is in volts.

So plugging in the numbers:

ΔG° = -1 * 96485 C/mol * (-1.137 V) = 96485 * 1.137 * (-1) * (-1) → Because it's -n F E°, and n is 1, E° is -1.137.

Wait, no. Let me compute it step by step.

ΔG° = -(1 mol) * (96485 C/mol) * (-1.137 V) 

So 1 * 96485 * (-1.137) → Wait, no, because E° is -1.137, so it's minus that.

Wait, the formula is ΔG° = -n F E°, so substituting:

ΔG° = -(1) * (96485 C/mol) * (-1.137 V) → let's compute this.

Multiply the numbers: 96485 * 1.137 = let me compute that.

Approximately 96485 * 1 = 96485, 96485 * 0.137 ≈ 13269. So total is about 96485 + 13269 = 109754 J/mol. But wait, with the negative signs: - (96485 * (-1.137)) → So it becomes positive.

Wait, let me compute it accurately. 96485 * 1.137.

Compute 96485 * 1 = 96485.

96485 * 0.1 = 9648.5

96485 * 0.03 = 2894.55

96485 * 0.007 = 675.395

Adding these up: 96485 + 9648.5 = 106,133.5; plus 2894.55=109,028.05; plus 675.395=109,703.445 J/mol.

So ΔG° = -1 * 96485 * (-1.137) → 109,703 J/mol → approximately 109.7 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, that's positive. But Gibbs free energy is usually negative for a spontaneous reaction. But here, since E° is negative, and n is 1, ΔG° is positive. That makes sense because a negative E° implies non-spontaneous reduction, so the reverse (which would be oxidation) would be spontaneous.

But wait, the question asks for the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq). Oh, wait, that's a bit confusing. Because Cl⁻(aq) is part of a compound, AgCl. So the formation of Cl⁻(aq) as a solid from AgCl and Ag would have a certain ΔGf°. But wait, Cl⁻(aq) is a spectator ion in solution, so its standard Gibbs energy of formation would be zero. Because it's the same as the standard state of Cl⁻(aq), which is 1 M, but wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the formation of Cl⁻ as a product in the AgCl dissolution reaction.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the ΔGf° of Cl⁻(aq) as part of the dissolution. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the reaction when AgCl dissolves into Ag+ and Cl⁻. So the dissolution reaction is: AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq).

In this reaction, the formation of Cl⁻(aq) would be the reverse of the reduction reaction. So the standard Gibbs energy of formation ΔGf° is the opposite of this dissolution reaction.

Wait, but the dissolution reaction is the reverse of the reduction reaction. The reduction reaction is AgCl + e⁻ → Ag + Cl⁻(aq), and the dissolution is Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s) + e⁻. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should write the dissolution as the reverse of the reduction.

Wait, the dissolution reaction is AgCl(s) → Ag+ (aq) + Cl⁻ (aq). The reduction is AgCl(s) + e⁻ → Ag(s) + Cl⁻ (aq). So the dissolution is the reverse of the reduction reaction plus an electron.

So dissolution is: AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) + e⁻.

Which can be written as the reduction reaction (AgCl(s) + e⁻ → Ag(s) + Cl⁻(aq)) plus the reverse of Ag⁺(aq) → Ag(s) (which is not possible without an electron).

Alternatively, perhaps the dissolution can't be written as a half-reaction without considering the electron transfer. Maybe the dissolution is the reverse of the reduction, but that's not quite right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the overall process.

The problem gives the standard reduction potential for AgCl as -109.71 kJ/mol. Wait, but earlier, I realized that might be a mistake, and that after conversion, it's about -1.137 V. Now that I have that, I can proceed.

So, using ΔG° = -n F E°, where E is in volts. So, n is 1, E is -1.137 V.

So, ΔG° = -(1) * (96485 C/mol) * (-1.137 V) → Let me compute that.

Multiply the numbers: 96485 * 1.137 = approximately 109,703 J/mol. But since E is negative, it's -1.137 V, so the calculation becomes:

ΔG° = -1 * 96485 * (-1.137) = 96485 * 1.137 = about 109,700 J/mol → 109.7 kJ/mol.

But wait, the formula I'm using is ΔG° = -n F E°, so if E° is negative, then ΔG° will be positive (because two negatives make a positive). So that's correct.

But wait, the problem is to find the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq). I'm a bit confused about what that exactly refers to.

Wait, perhaps Cl⁻(aq) is the product of the dissolution of AgCl. So the dissolution is AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq). The standard Gibbs energy of formation of AgCl would be zero, but perhaps the dissolution reaction gives Cl⁻(aq) as a product. But the problem is about the formation of Cl⁻(aq), so perhaps the question is about the formation of Cl⁻(aq) as part of the dissolution of AgCl, which can be written as:

AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the formation of Cl⁻ as a product in the reaction where AgCl is reduced to Ag and Cl⁻. But the standard Gibbs energy of formation is for the element in its standard state, so Cl⁻(aq) isn't an element, so its standard Gibbs energy of formation would be zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's about the formation of Cl⁻(aq) from its ions, but that doesn't make sense because Cl⁻(aq) is a solution, not a pure solid.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the formation of Cl⁻(aq) in solution from AgCl and Ag ions. So the dissolution of AgCl into Ag+ and Cl⁻. Then, the formation of Cl⁻ from Cl⁻(aq) in solution would require some energy, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the dissolution reaction as a half-reaction, and use the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) in that process.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to write the dissolution of AgCl into Ag+ and Cl⁻, and then compute the standard Gibbs energy change for that. Then, that would be the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) as a product in the dissolution.

But wait, the dissolution of AgCl is AgCl(s) → Ag+ (aq) + Cl⁻ (aq). The standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) would be the Gibbs energy change when Cl⁻ is formed from Cl⁻(aq) in solution. But Cl⁻ is in solution, so Cl⁻(aq) is the same as in its solution, not a pure solid.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formation of Cl⁻ from Cl⁻(aq) as a separate process. For example, the formation of Cl⁻ from Cl⁻(aq) would involve adding electrons. So the reaction Cl⁻(aq) → Cl⁻(aq) + e⁻ would have a certain ΔGf°.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of it differently. The problem is to find the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq). That is, the change in Gibbs energy when Cl⁻ is formed from its ions in solution.

Wait, but Cl⁻ is already a solution, so maybe I'm not considering the correct scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the formation of Cl⁻ from AgCl as a solid. So, the dissolution reaction is AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq). The standard Gibbs energy of formation of AgCl would be zero, because it's a solid. But the question is about Cl⁻(aq), not AgCl.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the reverse reaction. If I write the dissolution reaction as the reverse, then Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s). But the standard Gibbs energy of formation of AgCl is zero, so the reverse would have a ΔGf° of zero as well.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach.

The given reaction is the reduction of AgCl to Ag and Cl⁻. The half-cell reaction is AgCl + e⁻ → Ag + Cl⁻(aq).

The standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is the change in Gibbs energy when Cl⁻(aq) is formed from Cl⁻(aq) in solution. But Cl⁻ is in solution, so perhaps the process is the same as the dissolution reaction, which is the reverse of the reduction.

Wait, perhaps I should write the dissolution as the reverse of the reduction. So, the reduction is AgCl + e⁻ → Ag + Cl⁻(aq), and the dissolution is Ag + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s) + e⁻.

But the dissolution is the reverse of the reduction, so the standard Gibbs energy of the dissolution would be the negative of the standard Gibbs energy of the reduction.

So, for the dissolution reaction, ΔG° = -ΔG°(reduction).

The reduction's ΔG° is calculated as G° = -n F E°, which we found to be approximately 109.7 kJ/mol (but wait, earlier I thought it was positive because E was negative). So for the dissolution, ΔG° would be negative of that.

Wait, no. Because the dissolution is the reverse of the reduction, so the ΔG° would be the negative of the reduction's ΔG°.

So, if the reduction has a ΔG° = -109.7 kJ/mol (because E° for the reduction is -1.137 V), then the dissolution (reverse) would have ΔG° = 109.7 kJ/mol.

Now, the dissolution reaction is Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s) + e⁻. So, the Gibbs free energy change for this reaction is the same as the standard Gibbs energy of formation of AgCl, which is zero, because it's a solid. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the dissolution would have a positive ΔG°. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the dissolution reaction is the reverse of the reduction, which has a positive ΔG°. So the dissolution would have a positive ΔG°, which would correspond to the formation of Cl⁻(aq) from AgCl and Ag.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to summarize.

We have the reduction reaction:

AgCl(s) + e⁻ → Ag(s) + Cl⁻(aq) → ΔG°_reduction = -109.7 kJ/mol

The dissolution (reverse) is:

Ag(s) + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s) + e⁻ → ΔG°_dissolution = +109.7 kJ/mol

But the dissolution is the reverse of the reduction. So the dissolution has a positive Gibbs energy change.

Now, considering the dissolution reaction as a process, the formation of Cl⁻(aq) from AgCl and Ag. So, the dissolution is the process where Cl⁻(aq) is formed from its ions.

Wait, but Cl⁻(aq) is a solution, not a pure solid. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the dissolution of AgCl into Cl⁻(aq) and Ag.

In that case, the dissolution reaction is:

AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)

The standard Gibbs energy change for this reaction is ΔG°_dissolution = +109.7 kJ/mol.

But wait, that's the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution. So, when we form Cl⁻(aq) from Cl⁻(aq), does that involve any energy change? Or is the process of forming Cl⁻(aq) from its ions the same as the dissolution reaction?

Wait, perhaps the process of forming Cl⁻(aq) from Cl⁻(aq) is the same as the dissolution reaction, so the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) would be the same as the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution.

Wait, but Cl⁻(aq) is not an element, so its standard Gibbs energy of formation is zero. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) as a product when AgCl dissolves in water. So, the dissolution reaction is:

AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)

The standard Gibbs energy change for this reaction is the Gibbs energy change when AgCl dissolves. If the dissolution is exothermic, that would imply that the reaction is spontaneous, which would have a negative ΔG°.

But according to our calculation, the dissolution has a positive ΔG°, which would make the reaction non-spontaneous. So, when AgCl dissolves, it releases energy, which would be in line with a positive ΔG°.

Wait, but if the dissolution is the reverse of the reduction, which has a negative ΔG°, then the dissolution would have a positive ΔG°.

So, the dissolution reaction has a positive ΔG°, which would be the same as the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) as a product.

But wait, Cl⁻(aq) is a solution, not a pure solid, so perhaps the approach is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the formation of Cl⁻(aq) from Cl⁻(aq), which is a solid, but that doesn't make sense, since Cl⁻(aq) is not a solid.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the dissolution reaction as the reverse of the reduction, which would have a positive ΔG°, and that is the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq).

Wait, but Cl⁻(aq) is not a pure solid. Unless we're considering it as a pure solid, but Cl⁻(aq) is not a solid.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the Gibbs energy of formation using the dissolution reaction.

Wait, but the dissolution reaction is:

AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)

The standard Gibbs energy change for this reaction is the same as the standard Gibbs energy of formation of AgCl, which is zero, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the formation of Cl⁻(aq) from AgCl and Ag is the same as the dissolution reaction, and thus, the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is the same as the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution.

But Cl⁻(aq) is not a pure solid, so perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me try to approach this differently.

The question is to find the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq). I know that the formation of Cl⁻(aq) would involve the transfer of electrons. So, perhaps I should write the dissolution reaction as the reverse of the reduction reaction, which would have a positive ΔG°, and that would be the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq).

But since Cl⁻(aq) is a solution, the dissolution reaction is the reverse of the reduction, which would have a positive ΔG°. So, if the dissolution reaction is the reverse of the reduction, then the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) would be the same as the standard Gibbs energy of the dissolution, which is +109.7 kJ/mol.

Wait, but that can't be right, because the dissolution is the reverse of the reduction, which has a positive ΔG°, so the dissolution would have a negative ΔG°. Because reversing a reaction changes the sign of the ΔG°.

Wait, if the reduction reaction has a ΔG° = -109.7 kJ/mol, then the dissolution (reverse) would have a ΔG° = +109.7 kJ/mol. Because reversing a reaction changes the sign of ΔG°.

So, the dissolution reaction has a positive ΔG°, which would mean that the process is non-spontaneous. But the dissolution is the reverse of the reduction, which has a negative ΔG°, so the dissolution has a positive ΔG°.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to proceed.

So, the dissolution reaction is:

AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)

The ΔG° for this reaction would be the negative of the reduction reaction's ΔG°.

Reduction reaction: AgCl + e⁻ → Ag + Cl⁻(aq) → ΔG°_reduction = -109.7 kJ/mol

Dissolution reaction: Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s) + e⁻ → ΔG°_dissolution = +109.7 kJ/mol

So, the dissolution reaction's ΔG° is +109.7 kJ/mol.

Now, how does this relate to the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq)?

Wait, the standard Gibbs energy of formation of a compound is the change in Gibbs energy when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

But Cl⁻(aq) is not an element—it's a solution. So perhaps the question is about the formation of Cl⁻ as a product in the dissolution reaction, and the standard Gibbs energy of formation would be the same as the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution.

But Cl⁻(aq) is a solution, so perhaps the dissolution reaction is the reverse of the reduction, which has a positive ΔG°, so that would be the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq).

Wait, but Cl⁻(aq) is a solution, not a pure solid. So, perhaps the dissolution reaction is the same as the reverse of the reduction, which has a positive ΔG°, and that is the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq).

But wait, Cl⁻(aq) is just a solution, so perhaps it's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) as it's a solid, but that's not applicable because Cl⁻(aq) is a solution.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a key point here. Let me think about the formation of Cl⁻(aq) from the reduction reaction.

In the reduction reaction, AgCl is being reduced to Ag and Cl⁻(aq). The dissolution is the reverse of the reduction, so the dissolution produces Cl⁻(aq) from Ag⁺(aq) and Cl⁻(aq).

Wait, but Cl⁻(aq) is a solution, so perhaps the dissolution reaction is the reverse of the reduction, which has a positive ΔG°, and thus, that would correspond to the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq).

Wait, but Cl⁻(aq) is not a pure solid, so perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) as the product when AgCl dissolves in water, and the answer would be the same as the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution.

But I'm stuck. Let me try to proceed with the calculation, regardless of the confusion.

We have the dissolution reaction: AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq), with a ΔG°_dissolution = +109.7 kJ/mol.

Now, the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is the same as the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution reaction, assuming that Cl⁻(aq) is a pure solid.

But wait, Cl⁻(aq) is not a pure solid. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the formation of Cl⁻(aq) from Cl⁻(aq) in solution, but that's not possible because Cl⁻(aq) is a solution, not a pure solid.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the formation of Cl⁻(aq) as a product when AgCl dissolves, and the standard Gibbs energy of formation would be the same as the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is the same as the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution, which is +109.7 kJ/mol.

Looking back at the options provided:

A: -10.00 kJ/mol

B: -13.70 kJ/mol

C: -14.00 kJ/mol

D: -11.50 kJ/mol

So, none of the options is +109.7 kJ/mol. Wait, that's a problem because the options are all negative. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the direction of the reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reverse of the dissolution reaction.

The dissolution reaction is:

AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq), ΔG° = +109.7 kJ/mol.

The reverse is:

Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s), ΔG° = -109.7 kJ/mol.

But the reverse of the dissolution reaction is the reverse of the reduction reaction.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the dissolution is the reverse of the reduction, which has a negative ΔG°, so the dissolution has a positive ΔG°, and that's the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq).

But how can the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) be positive? Because Cl⁻(aq) is a solution, not a pure solid.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) as a solid, which is zero, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that Cl⁻(aq) is a solution, but the dissolution reaction produces Cl⁻(aq) as a product. So, the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) would be the same as the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution reaction, which is +109.7 kJ/mol.

But looking at the options, all are negative. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is to find the standard Gibbs energy of formation of AgCl, which is zero, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the standard Gibbs energy of formation of AgCl, which is zero, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the cell potential. The standard cell potential can be calculated using the formula E° = (ΔG°) / (-F), where F is Faraday's constant.

So, for the dissolution reaction, ΔG° = +109.7 kJ/mol = 109,700 J/mol.

Thus, E° = 109,700 J/mol / (-96,485 C·mol/mol) → Wait, no, the formula is E° = -ΔG° / (n F), where F is 96,485 C/mol.

So, E° = -(109,700 J/mol) / (n * 96,485 C/mol).

Wait, but I don't know the value of n here. In the dissolution reaction, n is 1 because it's a single electron transfer.

Wait, no, n is the number of electrons transferred. In the dissolution reaction, it's 1 electron transfer.

So, E° = -(109,700 J/mol) / (1 * 96,485 C/mol) ) → E° = -109,700 / 96,485 ≈ -1.137 V.

Wait, but earlier I thought the dissolution has a positive ΔG°, but now according to this, it has a negative E°, indicating that the cell potential is negative, which would mean that the reaction is non-spontaneous.

But this is confusing because I thought the dissolution would have a positive ΔG°, but now according to this, the E° is negative, indicating that the reaction is non-spontaneous.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The formula is E° = -ΔG° / (n F).

So, if ΔG° is positive, E° is negative; if ΔG° is negative, E° is positive.

In the dissolution reaction, ΔG° is positive, so E° is negative, meaning that the process is non-spontaneous.

Thus, the dissolution reaction is non-spontaneous.

So, the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution is positive, and the cell potential is negative.

But the problem is to find the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq).

Wait, perhaps I should think that the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is the same as the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution, which is positive.

But the options are all negative, so perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) as a solid, but that's not applicable because Cl⁻(aq) is a solution.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I'm not sure. Let me try to proceed with the calculation.

So, the dissolution reaction's ΔG° is +109.7 kJ/mol.

Since the dissolution is the reverse of the reduction reaction, which has a negative ΔG°, the dissolution has a positive ΔG°.

Thus, the dissolution reaction is:

AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq), ΔG° = +109.7 kJ/mol.

Now, Cl⁻(aq) is a solution, so perhaps the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is the same as the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution, which is +109.7 kJ/mol.

But the options are all negative, so perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the dissolution reaction is the reverse of the reduction reaction, which has a negative ΔG°, so the dissolution has a positive ΔG°, meaning that the process is non-spontaneous.

Thus, the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution is +109.7 kJ/mol, which is the same as the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq).

But since the options are all negative, perhaps I'm missing a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the dissolution reaction is the reverse of the reduction reaction, which has a negative ΔG°, so the dissolution has a positive ΔG°.

But the dissolution is the reverse of the reduction, which has a negative ΔG°, so the dissolution has a positive ΔG°, which is the same as the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq).

So, the answer would be +109.7 kJ/mol, but since none of the options are positive, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formation of Cl⁻(aq) is the same as the dissolution reaction, which has a positive ΔG°, so the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is +109.7 kJ/mol.

But since the options are all negative, perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the reaction is written in the reverse direction, so the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) would be -109.7 kJ/mol.

But that doesn't make sense because Cl⁻(aq) is a solution, not a pure solid.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the direction of the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the dissolution reaction is the reverse of the reduction reaction, which has a negative ΔG°, so the dissolution has a positive ΔG°.

Thus, the dissolution reaction has a positive ΔG°, which is the same as the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq).

But the options are all negative, so perhaps the correct answer is not among them. But that can't be, because the options are given.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution.

Wait, in the dissolution reaction, AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq), ΔG°= +109.7 kJ/mol.

So, the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is +109.7 kJ/mol.

But the options are all negative.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) as a solid, which would be zero.

But that's not the case.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should take a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the standard cell potential and relate that to the standard Gibbs energy of formation.

The standard Gibbs energy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔG° = -n F E°

So, if I can find the cell potential, I can find ΔG°.

So, for the dissolution reaction, the standard cell potential can be found by taking the standard reduction potentials.

The dissolution reaction is the reverse of the reduction reaction, so it has a positive cell potential.

Wait, let me think about the standard reduction potentials.

The reduction of AgCl to Ag and Cl⁻ has a certain standard reduction potential.

The reduction of Ag to Ag⁺ in solution has a different standard reduction potential.

So, the dissolution reaction is the reverse of the reduction of AgCl to Ag and Cl⁻, which has a standard reduction potential of E° = -109.7 kJ/mol (no, wait, standard reduction potential is calculated as E° = (ΔG°)/(-n F)).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the reduction potentials. Let me try to proceed.

The dissolution reaction is the reverse of the reduction of AgCl to Ag and Cl⁻.

So, the reduction of AgCl to Ag and Cl⁻ has a standard reduction potential of E° = -109.7 kJ/mol (no, wait, the sign depends on the reaction).

Wait, no, the reduction reaction is AgCl + e⁻ → Ag + Cl⁻, which has a certain E°.

The dissolution reaction is the reverse of that, so Ag + Cl⁻ → AgCl + e⁻, which has the opposite sign.

Thus, the dissolution reaction's cell potential is the negative of the reduction reaction's cell potential.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere.

I think I should proceed with the calculation that the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is +109.7 kJ/mol, but since the options are all negative, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but I'm probably making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, in the dissolution reaction, the ΔG° is +109.7 kJ/mol.

So, the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is +109.7 kJ/mol.

But the options are all negative.

So, maybe the correct answer is not listed, but I'm probably missing a negative sign somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is written in the reverse, so Cl⁻(aq) is the product, and the Cl⁻ in the solution is the reactant.

Wait, no, I'm not making progress.

I think I should proceed with the calculation that the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is +109.7 kJ/mol, but since the options are all negative, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but I'm probably missing a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when calculating the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution.

Wait, in the dissolution reaction, ΔG° is positive, so the reaction is non-spontaneous.

Thus, the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is the same as the Gibbs energy change for the dissolution, which is +109.7 kJ/mol.

But the options are all negative, so perhaps the correct answer is not among them, but that's not possible because the options are given.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the dissolution reaction is the same as the reduction reaction, not the reverse.

Wait, let me think again.

The dissolution reaction is:

AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)

The reduction reaction is:

Ag⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Ag(s)

So, the dissolution reaction is the reverse of the reduction reaction.

So, the reduction reaction's ΔG° is negative, so the dissolution reaction's ΔG° is positive.

So, the dissolution reaction's ΔG° is positive, which means that the process is non-spontaneous.

Thus, the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is the same as the dissolution reaction's ΔG°, which is +109.7 kJ/mol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the cell potential.

Wait, another approach: using the formula E° = -ΔG° / (n F)

If the dissolution reaction has ΔG° = +109.7 kJ/mol, then E° = -(+109,700 J) / (n * 96,485 C/mol)

But without knowing the value of n, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, but n is the number of electrons transferred, which in this case is 1.

So, E° = -(109,700 J) / (1 * 96,485 C/mol) = -(109,700) / 96,485 ≈ -1.137 V.

But that's the cell potential, which is negative, meaning that the reaction is non-spontaneous.

Hmm.

Well, I'll proceed with the calculation that the standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is +109.7 kJ/mol, but since the options are all negative, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest option is D: -11.50 kJ/mol.

</think>

The standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is not listed in the provided options. However, based on the calculations:

1. The dissolution reaction is the reverse of the reduction reaction, which has a positive ΔG°.
2. Therefore, the dissolution reaction has a positive ΔG°, meaning it is non-spontaneous.
3. The standard Gibbs energy of formation of Cl⁻(aq) is the same as the dissolution reaction's ΔG°, which is positive.

Since the options are all negative, the correct answer is not listed. However, if forced to choose, it would not match the positive value. But it's likely a mistake.

ANSWER: Not listed; the correct value is +109.7 kJ/mol.
