Question:

Consider an example of forced convection within a pipe. The local heat transfer coefficient is valid at the point it is evaluated at, and in its immediate vicinity. When the length of pipe as a whole is of concern, the average heat transfer coefficient applies. The average temperature difference is defined as (T_s - T)_av= [{(T_s - T_in) + (T_s - T_out)} / 2] where T_s = wall surface temperature T_in = bulk fluid temperature at entrance T_out = bulk fluid temperature at exit. Derive the average heat transfer coefficienth_avin terms of the local coefficienth_x.

Options:

A: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_x(T_s - T)dx} / 2\piR^ L]
B: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_x(T_s - T)dx} / (T_s -T_av)]
C: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_xdx} / (T_s - T_av)]
D: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_x(T_s - T)^2dx} / (T_s - T_av)]
E: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_x(T_s - T)dx} / (T_s + T_av)]
F: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_x(T_s - T)dx} / (T_in - T_out)]
G: h_av= [{^L\int_0(h_x + T)dx} / (T_s - T_av)]
H: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_x(T_s - T)dx} / {(T_s - T_in) + (T_s - T_out)}]
I: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_x(T_s + T)dx} / (T_s -T_av)]
J: h_av= [{^L\int_0h_x(T_s - T)dx} / L]

Okay, so I have this question about forced convection in a pipe, and I need to find the average heat transfer coefficient, h_av. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it.

The problem says that the average temperature difference is given by (T_s - T_av), where T_av is the average wall temperature. Oh wait, I think T_av is calculated as the average of T_in and T_out, since those are the bulk fluid temperatures at the entrance and exit. Or wait, no, maybe T_av is the average surface temperature. Hmm, actually, the formula given is (T_s - T_av) averaged over the surface. So T_av is the average of T_in and T_out, right.

The question is about deriving h_av, the average coefficient. I remember that for forced convection, the average coefficient isn't just the local coefficient averaged over the entire length. But how do I relate them?

Wait, the options are a bit confusing. Let's look at them again. Option A says h_av is the integral from 0 to L of h_x times (T_s - T) dx divided by 2πR L. That seems like it's relating the integral of h_x (T_s - T) along the length to the average. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: I remember that for a flat plate or a surface with constant properties, the average Nusselt number can be related to the local Nusselt number. But in a pipe, it's a bit different because it's convective, not radiation. The formula for h_av is given in terms of h_x, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think the average heat transfer coefficient h_av is related to the local h_x in a way that depends on the temperature profile. For a pipe, perhaps the average h_av is the integral of h_x over the length multiplied by some function of (T_s-T) and the length.

Wait, another formula I vaguely remember. For forced convection in a pipe, the average Nusselt number Nu_av is given by Nu_av = 0.664 L Pr^0.4 Pr is the Prandtl number. But wait, that's for length L and Pr is the Prandtl number. But I'm not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, the average heat transfer coefficient can be expressed in terms of the local h_x and the average (T_s - T) over the surface. Wait, perhaps h_av times the surface area equals the integral of h_x (T_s - T) dx over the length L.

Wait, the question says that the average temperature difference is (T_s - T_av). So, the numerator in the average h_av formula would involve that.

Wait, another thought: the average Nusselt number Nu_av is (h_av * L) / h_0, where h_0 is the heat transfer coefficient for a flat plate or some other reference. But I'm not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, the average heat flux q_avg is equal to h_av (T_s - T_av). Because for a surface, the average heat flux is the average h times the temperature difference. But wait, that's assuming steady state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the heat transfer rate Q is h_av * A (T_s - T_av), where A is the surface area. But Q can also be expressed as the integral of h_x(x) * A (T_s - T(x)) dx from 0 to L. So Q = integral [h_x (T_s - T)] dx from 0 to L. So h_av A (T_s - T_av) = integral h_x (T_s - T) dx.

But I'm trying to find h_av in terms of h_x. So rearranging, h_av = [ integral h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / (A (T_s - T_av) ). But A is the surface area, which for a cylinder is 2πRL. So h_av = [ integral (h_x (T_s - T) dx ) ] / (2πRL (T_s - T_av) ). Looking at the options, option B is h_av = [ integral h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av). But wait, that doesn't include the 2πRL denominator. So option B is missing the denominator, which I think is necessary. So option B would be missing the 2πRL factor, but the numerator would be just the integral, so h_av would be (integral)/(T_s - T_av) times 1/(2πRL). Hmm, that's not matching any of the options, which are all in terms of h_x.

Wait, the options don't have the L in the denominator. Let me reevaluate.

Wait the question says to express h_av in terms of h_x. So perhaps the integral is over the length, but h_x is local. So maybe the integral is ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx from 0 to L. Then h_av would be [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] divided by (L (T_s - T_av) ). Because the integral is over the surface, the surface area is L (2πR), but I thought for average, perhaps the surface area is used? Alternatively, another approach: the average heat transfer coefficient is h_av = (1/L) ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx. But that's if h_x is uniform, which it's not in a pipe. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem states that the average temperature difference is (T_s - T_av), which is (T_s - ( (T_in + T_out)/2 )). But I'm not sure if that's used in the formula for h_av.

Wait, the question says to derive h_av in terms of h_x. So maybe the integral of h_x (T_s - T) over the length, divided by the average (T_s - T) over the length. So h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / ( ∫ (T_s - T) dx )

But that's not one of the options. Looking at the options, option B is [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av). But that's not correct because the denominator is the average (T_s - T) over the length. So that would be h_av times L equals the integral of h_x (T_s-T) dx.

Wait, perhaps the integral of h_x (T_s - T) dx is h_av times the integral of (T_s - T) dx. So h_av = [ integral over L of h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [ integral over L of (T_s - T) dx ].

But none of the options present this, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another angle: the average heat transfer coefficient for forced convection in a pipe. I remember that for a flat plate, the average Nusselt number is Nu_avg = 0.664 L Pr^0.4, but for a cylinder, perhaps it's similar. But I'm not sure how that relates to h_av.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av) ) multiplied by 1/(2π R L). Wait, that would make sense if h_av is the average h_x over the length. But the options don't include that.

Wait, the options have h_av equals something divided by (something else). Let me see the options again.

Looking at option B:

B: h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av )

But wait, that can't be correct because (T_s - T_av) is the average (T_s - T) over the length, while the integral is the sum of h_x (T_s-T) over x. So h_av would be [ integral h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [ L (T_s - T_av) ), but none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the correct expression is h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [ L (T_s - T_av) ].

But looking at the options, option B is [∫ h_x (T_s-T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av). That's missing the 1/L factor. So perhaps h_av is (1/L) * [ ∫ h_x (T_s-T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av). But option B is without that. So none of the options seem to match.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is option B multiplied by 1/(2 π R L). Because the integral of h_x (T_s-T) dx over L is L times the average of h_x (T_s-T). But I'm getting confused here.

Another approach: perhaps the average heat transfer coefficient is given by option B, but I don't think that's correct because the denominator in option B is the average (T_s-T) over the length, not just the integral.

Wait, but wait, another formula I found once: For a pipe, the average Nusselt number Nu_avg is (h_av * L)/(h_0 * A), where A is the surface area.

In this case, h_0 would be the heat transfer coefficient for a flat plate. But in a pipe, h_0 would be the same as h_x at the entrance, assuming uniform properties. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, in a pipe, the average Nusselt number might be different, but maybe the approach is similar.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [ (T_s - T_av) * (2 π R L) ) ].

Wait, but none of the options have 2 π R L in the denominator. The options don't include that factor. So perhaps the correct formula is option B, but in that case, the denominator isn't correct because it should also involve the length.

Wait, looking again at the options, option B is [ integral h_x (T_s-T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av).

But perhaps in this problem, the correct expression is h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av) ) * (1/(L)). Because when you have the integral of (T_s - T) over x, that's the integral of (T_s - T(x)) dx from 0 to L.

But none of the options have 1/L. So perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another way: the average temperature difference might be (T_s - T_avg), where T_avg is the average of T_in and T_out, which are bulk fluid temperatures. Wait, but in the question, T_av is the average over the surface. So T_av is the average of T_in and T_out.

So (T_s - T_av) is the average of (T_s - T_in) and (T_s - T_out), right? Because T_av = (T_in + T_out)/2.

So (T_s - T_av) = (T_s - (T_in + T_out)/2 ) = [2(T_s) - T_in - T_out ] / 2.

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, considering that the heat transfer rate Q is equal to h_av * A * (T_s - T_av), where A is the surface area.

Q is also equal to the integral over the entire length of h_x(x) (T_s - T(x)) dx.

So Q = ∫0^L h_x (T_s - T) dx = h_av * 2 π R L * (T_s - T_av).

Rearranging, h_av = [ ∫0^L h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / (2 π R L (T_s - T_av)).

Looking at the options, none of them have 2 π R L in the denominator except option G, which is [ ∫ h_x (T_s + T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av). So that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let's see. Wait, option B is [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av). But according to my calculation, the denominator should be 2 π R L (T_s - T_av), which is not present in any option except option G, which uses +T instead of (T_s-T), and also the denominator is different.

So perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, in the problem statement, the average temperature difference is (T_s - T_av) which is the average of (T_s - T_in) and (T_s - T_out), but in terms of the integral, perhaps (T_s - T) is being considered as the surface temperature, and T_in and T_out are the entrance and exit fluid temperatures.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is option B. Because in the integral, it's the integral of h_x (T_s - T) dx over the length, divided by (T_s - T_av), which is the average (T_s - T) over the length.

But wait, no, because (T_s - T_av) is the average (T_s - T) over the length, so h_av would be the integral over h_x (T_s - T) divided by (T_s - T_av) multiplied by 1/(L). Because h_av L = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [ T_s - T_av ]

So h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [ (T_s - T_av) * L ]

So none of the options have L in the denominator. So perhaps none of the options match. But since the options are given, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is option B, but without the L in the denominator. Because sometimes in these equations, the length is included as a multiplicative factor. Like, the integral of (T_s - T) over the length, which is ∫0^L (T_s - T) dx, and the surface area is 2 π R L.

Wait, but the question is about average h_av. Maybe the average of the product is [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / [ L (T_s - T_av) ) ].

Looking at the options, none have L in the denominator. So perhaps the correct option is B, but that's not the case because in option B, the denominator is (T_s - T_av), which is the average, but the numerator is the integral of h_x (T_s-T) dx, not the average. So that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Because the integral of h_x (T_s - T) dx is equal to h_av multiplied by the integral of (T_s - T) dx. So [ ∫ h_x (T_s-T) dx ] = h_av * ∫ (T_s - T) dx. Thus, h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s-T) dx ] / [ ∫ (T_s-T) dx ].

But none of the options show this. Looking at the options, option B uses (T_s - T_av) as the denominator. Which is the average (T_s - T) over the surface.

So perhaps the correct formula is option B. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is option B multiplied by 1/(2 π R L), but that would complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong and the correct formula is option B.

Another approach: when dealing with forced convection, the average coefficient h_av is related to the local coefficient h_x. For a cylinder, perhaps h_av is given by option B. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av) ) * [1/(2 π R L)].

Wait, but I don't see that in the options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct answer is option B. Because the integral of h_x (T_s-T) over L equals the average coefficient. Wait, but again, the denominator is (T_s-T_av), not the integral.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the options again.

Option B: h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s - T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av)

If the denominator is the average (T_s-T) over L, then the numerator is the integral of h_x (T_s-T) over L, which would be h_av * L * (T_s - T_av). So h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s-T) dx ] / [ L (T_s - T_av) ) ].

But looking at the options, none have L in the denominator. So perhaps the correct formula is not among the options. But that can't be, since the question expects us to select one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B. But I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is option B, but the denominator is (T_s - T_av) multiplied by L. But that's not what the options have.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is option B multiplied by (1/(2 π R L)), but that's not present.

Another thought: Maybe for a cylinder, the average Nusselt number Nu_avg is given by Nu_avg = 0.664 L Pr^0.4, where Pr is Prandtl number. But Pr is (h * L)/(c_p * (T_in - T_out)) ). But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Because the integral of h_x (T_s-T) is the h_av multiplied by the integral of (T_s-T) dx. So h_av = [ integral h_x (T_s-T) dx ] / [ integral (T_s-T) dx ].

But the integral of (T_s-T) dx is the total (T_s - T) over the length. So the average (T_s-T) over L is [ (1/L) * ∫ (T_s - T) dx ].

So [ ∫ h_x (T_s-T) dx ] = h_av * L * average(T_s-T) = h_av * L * [1/L ∫ (T_s-T) dx ] = h_av ∫ (T_s-T) dx.

So h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s-T) dx ] / ∫ (T_s-T) dx.

But none of the options have the integral of (T_s-T) in the denominator. So perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, option B's denominator is (T_s - T_av), which is the average (T_s - T) over the length. So actually, option B's expression would have h_av equal to [ ∫ h_x (T_s-T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av), which is not the same as my earlier conclusion. Because that would imply that h_av is [ ∫ h_x (T_s-T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av) = [ ∫ h_x (T_s-T) dx ] / ( (T_s - T_av) ), which would be h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s-T) dx ] / ( (T_s - T_av) ) ). 

But that makes h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s-T) dx ] / ( (T_s - T_av) ), which is incorrect because the average (T_s-T) is the denominator. So I think I made a mistake earlier.

So the correct calculation would be h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s-T) dx ] / [ L (T_s - T_av) ) ]

But none of the options have L in the denominator.

Wait, but looking again, the option B is h_av = [ ∫ h_x (T_s-T) dx ] / (T_s - T_av ). That's missing the L in the denominator, so it's incorrect unless the entire integral is over a length L. But the options don't have that.

Since the options don't have L in the denominator, perhaps the correct answer is none of them. But that's not an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is option B multiplied by 1/(2 π R L), but that's not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, another perspective: The average coefficient for forced convection in a cylinder is given by h_av = (h_x * L) / [ (T_s - T_av) * (2 π R) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

h_av = [ h_x * L ] / [ (T_s - T_av) * (2 π R) ) ]

But this is still not one of the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think that the correct answer is option B.

After all, I can't think of a better option, so I'll go with option B.
</think>

The question asks for the derivation of the average forced convection heat transfer coefficient, \( h_{\text{av}} \), in terms of the local heat transfer coefficient, \( h_x \), and other given parameters. The analysis begins by considering the relationship between the heat transfer rate, \( Q \), the local heat transfer coefficient, \( h_x \), and the surface temperature, \( T_s \). The heat transfer rate is expressed as:

\[
Q = \int_0^L h_x (T_s - T(x)) \, dx
\]

where \( T(x) \) represents the temperature distribution along the length \( L \) of the cylinder.

The average heat transfer coefficient, \( h_{\text{av}} \), is related to the average temperature difference, \( T_s - T_{\text{avg}} \), over the length of the cylinder. However, the problem specifies that \( T_{\text{avg}} \) is the average of the entrance and exit bulk fluid temperatures, \( T_{\text{in}} \) and \( T_{\text{out}} \). The temperature difference is thus:

\[
T_s - T_{\text{av}} = \frac{2(T_s - T_{\text{in}}) - (T_s - T_{\text{out}})}{2}
\]

However, the key point is to recognize that the correct expression for \( h_{\text{av}} \) must account for the integral of \( h_x (T_s - T) \) over the length \( L \), and the integral of \( (T_s - T) \) over \( L \), which is the denominator in the average \( (T_s - T) \).

After evaluating the options, it becomes evident that none of the provided options correctly represent the relationship. However, based on the reasoning, the most plausible choice aligns with the structure of the integral and the denominator, even though it does not include the length \( L \). Among the given options, **option B** is selected as the closest match, despite the omission of the length factor.

ANSWER: B
