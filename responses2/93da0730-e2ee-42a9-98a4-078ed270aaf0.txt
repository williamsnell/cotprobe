Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a study on a new drug for type 2 diabetes. Let me think through this step by step.

The setup: 1000 patients were enrolled, randomly assigned to new drug or standard treatment. Alpha is 0.05, beta is 0.20. Results show the new drug is better. Now, the question is, if the study were done with a smaller population, say 500 patients, which of the options would increase.

I remember that power is related to the probability of detecting a true effect when it exists. Power is calculated as 1 - beta. So if beta is 0.20, the power is 0.80. If the sample size is smaller, beta might increase, which would lower the power. But wait, no, wait: Wait, beta is the probability of a type II error, which is the probability of failing to reject the null when it's false. So if the new drug is better, and the study has a smaller population, the power (the ability to detect it) depends on sample size. A smaller sample might make it harder to detect the effect, so power might decrease.

Let me think again. Suppose the study has a smaller population. If the new drug is actually better, the power of the study (the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's false) depends on the sample size. A larger sample size gives more power. If it's a smaller population, perhaps the sample size is fixed, so the power might decrease. So, if the study's alpha and beta are calculated based on 1000 patients, but you have a smaller population, the power might be lower. So if you have a smaller sample, the power decreases. So in the options, D would be about power, which would decrease. But the question is, if the study is done with a smaller population, which of the options would increase.

Wait, what if the sample size is smaller, but the effect size is the same. Then, the power is lower. But if the effect size in the smaller population is larger, maybe the power increases. But the question states that the new drug is significantly better than standard treatment. So perhaps the effect size is the same. So with less patients, the power would be lower, so the chance of a type II error (beta) increases.

Wait, the options are whether the chance of a type II error (B) increases. So if the effect size is the same, but the sample size is smaller, the power would be lower. Power is the probability of not making a type II error, right? So when sample size is small, the power is lower. So the chance of a type II error would be higher. So if the study was done with a smaller population (500), the chance of a false negative result (B) would increase. Because a type II error is failure to reject the null when it's false, which corresponds to a false negative result.

Wait, let me clarify the terms:

- Type II error (beta) is failing to reject the null when it's false. So the chance of a type II error is beta. So if beta is higher, that means more type II errors, which is a false negative.

Therefore, when the sample size is smaller, power decreases. So the chance of type II error (i.e., beta) increases.

Looking back at the options, the question is which would increase. The options are A to I. Let's look at each:

Option B: Chance of a false positive result. False positives are type I errors. The probability of type I error is alpha. If in the original study, alpha is 0.05, but the question says the alpha and beta are 0.05 and 0.20. It doesn't state that the alpha would change. So the alpha (P(type I error)) would remain 0.05 regardless of sample size. So option H (probability of alpha value) is 0.05, which isn't changing. So H would not increase.

Option C: Size of the study population. If the population is smaller, the sample size is 500. I don't know if that affects the study's power. Wait, the original study's power (which is 0.8) was calculated based on sample size 1000. If you have a smaller sample, the power for the same effect size would be lower. But wait, the question says the study was done in a population of 500, but the original setup was 1000. So if the population is 500, but the sample size is 500, perhaps the same as the population. So power would be based on that, but it's just a sample from a population of 500. Hmm, but sample size is 500, same as population. So the power in this case would be 1 - beta. Since beta was 0.20, power is 0.80. So if the population is smaller, but sample size is the same as population, power remains 0.80. So C probably doesn't change.

Wait, but the question is, if the study was done in a smaller population (500), what would increase. So perhaps the sample size is fixed if it's 500. So in the original study, the sample size was 1000 (but perhaps the population is larger, but the study used 1000). So now, if the population is 500, but the sample is 500, the power remains the same, but perhaps the specific statistical power (the probability of correctly detecting the effect) remains the same because you have the same sample size as the population. So C would not change. So C is not an answer.

So, looking again at the options. The question is, if the study is done in a population of 500, which of the options would increase. Let's think about each option:

A: Chance of Type I error (alpha). That's 0.05, regardless of population. So it doesn't change. So A would not increase.

B: False positive (Type I error) chance. Still 0.05. So B doesn't increase.

C: Size of study population. If the population is smaller, but sample is same, power (0.8) remains same. So C doesn't change.

D: Power of the study. Power is 1 - beta. If beta was 0.20, power was 0.8. But if the sample size is 500 (same as population), perhaps the power could be higher if you have a larger effect. But wait, the original study's effect size was determined by the sample. If the population is smaller, but the sample size is same, the effect size might be smaller. So power could decrease if the effect is smaller. But the question states that the new drug is significantly better than standard treatment. So perhaps the effect size is the same, but the sample is smaller, leading to lower power. So D would decrease, so if it's asked which would increase, D wouldn't increase.

Option E: Sensitivity. Sensitivity is the true positive rate, which is 1 - beta. So if beta is 0.20, sensitivity is 0.8. So if the sample size is smaller, and the effect is same, power decreases, so sensitivity would decrease. So E wouldn't increase.

Option F: Specificity. Specificity is the true negative rate, which depends on the disease prevalence. Without information about whether this is a rare disease, it's hard to say. But the question doesn't provide info on that. So F probably wouldn't change.

Option G: False negative result. False negatives are type II errors, which are beta. So in the original study, it's possible that with a larger sample, the study is more likely to detect the effect, so the chance of a false negative would increase. Wait, but if the sample is smaller, and the effect size is the same, power would be lower. So the chance of type II error (false negative) would be higher. So G would increase in the case of a smaller sample.

Option H: Probability of alpha value. Alpha is the significance level, 0.05. It's fixed based on the test's significance level. So H wouldn't change.

Option I: Chance of a type I error. That's alpha, which is 0.05. So I wouldn't change.

So the question is, which of these would increase. The only option that seems to increase is G: False negative result (type II error, beta). Because with a smaller population, the power (ability to detect true effect) decreases, so the chance of failing to reject the null when it's false (beta) increases, leading to more type II errors.

So the correct answer is G.

The question involves a study assessing the effectiveness of a new drug for type 2 diabetes, conducted with 1000 patients and a sample size of 500 in another scenario. The study's parameters (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.20) remain constant. The focus is on how a smaller population size (500) affects the study's outcomes.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A: Chance of a Type I Error**  
  The probability of a Type I error (alpha) is set at 0.05, independent of the sample size. Thus, this does not increase.

- **B: Chance of a False Positive Result**  
  The chance of a false positive result corresponds to a Type I error, which remains 0.05 regardless of sample size. Hence, this does not increase.

- **C: Size of the Study Population**  
  With a smaller population (500), the sample size remains the same as the population. Therefore, the study's power (1 - beta) remains unchanged, as power is determined by sample size and effect size. This does not increase.

- **D: Power of the Study**  
  Power is calculated as 1 - beta. With a smaller sample size, if the effect size is unchanged, power decreases. Thus, this does not increase.

- **E: Sensitivity**  
  Sensitivity is the true positive rate, equal to 1 - beta. If beta decreases due to smaller sample size, sensitivity increases. However, the question does not provide information about the effect size or whether this is a rare disease, so this is speculative.

- **F: Specificity**  
  Specificity (true negative rate) depends on disease prevalence, which is not provided. Thus, this is unlikely to increase.

- **G: Chance of a False Negative Result**  
  A false negative result corresponds to a Type II error (beta). With a smaller sample size, power decreases, increasing the likelihood of Type II errors. This increases.

- **H: Probability of a Type I Error**  
  The significance level (alpha) remains 0.05. Thus, this does not increase.

- **I: Chance of a Type I Error**  
  As noted, alpha is fixed at 0.05. Thus, this does not increase.

### Conclusion:
The only option that increases is **G: Chance of a false negative result**, as the smaller sample size reduces power, increasing the probability of Type II errors.
