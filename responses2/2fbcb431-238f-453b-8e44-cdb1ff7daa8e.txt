Question:

Heteroscedasticity in a scattergram suggests that:

Options:

A: there is a restriction of range of scores on the predictor and/or the criterion.
B: the variability (range) of scores on the criterion varies for different scores on the predictor.
C: there is a statistically significant correlation between the predictor and criterion.
D: the predictor and criterion have a negative correlation.
E: there is a perfect correlation between the predictor and the criterion.
F: the predictor and criterion are independent of each other.
G: the relationship between the predictor and criterion cannot be described by a straight line.
H: the variability (range) of scores on the predictor is constant for all scores on the criterion.
I: the scores on the criterion are uniformly distributed across the range of the predictor.
J: the variability (range) of scores on the predictor varies for different scores on the criterion.

Okay, so I have this question about heteroscedasticity and scattergrams. I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but let's think this through. 

Heteroscedasticity, if I remember correctly, refers to a situation where the variance of the error terms (or residuals) in a statistical model is not constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals is not the same for all data points. 

Now, the question is about what this implies in a scattergram. A scattergram, or scatter plot, is a graph that shows how two variables relate. The x-axis is the predictor (independent variable), and the y-axis is the criterion (dependent variable). So, if there's heteroscedasticity, that means the spread of the data points isn't the same on both sides of the regression line.

Looking at the options:

Option B says: the variability (range) of scores on the criterion varies for different scores on the predictor. Hmm, wait. Heteroscedasticity is about the spread of the residuals, not the spread of the criterion scores themselves. So B might be incorrect.

Option F: the predictor and criterion are independent. That doesn't make sense. Independence would mean no relationship, but heteroscedasticity is about variability in the dependent variable due to the independent variable.

Option J: the variability of the predictor varies for different criteria. No, that's not right either. Heteroscedasticity is about the variance of the dependent variable, not the independent one.

Option G: the relationship can't be described by a straight line. Wait, if there's heteroscedasticity, the relationship isn't linear because the error terms have constant variance. So G might be the correct answer here, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another angle: H and I. Option H says the variability of the predictor's scores is constant for all scores on the criterion. That doesn't fit heteroscedasticity. Option I says variability varies, which would be the opposite of heteroscedasticity. So H is incorrect, I is correct.

Wait, another thought: Option B is about the variability in the criterion varying for different predictor scores. That's about the spread in the dependent variable. But heteroscedasticity is about the spread in the residualsâ€”so the dependent variable's variability around the regression line. So B's statement is incorrect.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The question is what heteroscedasticity suggests. Heteroscedasticity means that the variance of the error terms (residuals) is not constant. So the plot would show that the spread is different at different levels of the predictor. In a scattergram, that would look like points being more spread out at the higher or lower ends of the x-axis. So in the plot, the spread of y-values (criterion) would vary as the x-values (predictor) vary. So the variability in the criterion (y) is not constant across all x-values. So in the scattergram, the points might be more spread out on the top and bottom of the plot.

So looking again at the options, option B says that the variability of the criterion varies for different scores on the predictor. Which is exactly what heteroscedasticity implies. Because in heteroscedasticity, the variance (spread) of the dependent variable is not the same for all values of the independent variable.

Wait, but wait a second. Heteroscedasticity is the opposite of homoscedasticity. Homoscedasticity is when the variance is constant. So when it's heteroscedastic, the variance is not constant. So the plot would show higher points on one side and lower on the other, or points spread out more at the extremes.

So looking at the options again, the correct answer should be B or another option?

Wait, but another thought: Option G says the relationship can't be described by a straight line. That would actually be true if there's heteroscedasticity. Because if the relationship is nonlinear, the regression line might not capture the true relationship, but heteroscedasticity refers to the error variance, not the form of the relationship. So G would be correct if the relationship isn't linear. But the question is about what heteroscedasticity suggests about the scattergram. 

Wait, the question is about what heteroscedasticity suggests in a scattergram. So the scattergram would show that the spread of the y-values is not constant with x. So for example, if high x-values have lower y-values, the points would be spread out on the left and right. Or, maybe the points are more spread out on the top and bottom of the plot.

So the correct statement is that the variability (range) of the criterion (y) varies for different scores on the predictor (x). So that's option B.

Wait wait, option B says: the variability (range) of scores on the criterion varies for different scores on the predictor. So, the y-values (criterion) have a range that changes as x varies. That's exactly the case with heteroscedasticity. So the correct answer is B.

Heteroscedasticity refers to a situation where the variance of the error terms in a statistical model is not constant across all levels of the independent variables. This implies that the spread of the error terms (residuals) varies as the independent variable changes. In a scattergram, this is reflected in the points being more spread out on one side of the regression line compared to the other. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** correctly states that the variability (range) of scores on the criterion varies for different scores on the predictor, which is exactly what heteroscedasticity suggests. This is the correct answer.
- Other options either describe unrelated phenomena or are incorrect in their implications.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: B**
