Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the pressure exerted by 1.0 mole of Xenon gas confined to 1.0 dm³ at 25 degrees Celsius. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that this sounds related to the ideal gas law. Let me think about how to apply it here.

The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, right? So P is pressure, V is volume, n is moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin. I need to find the pressure P.

Wait, the question gives me all the values except for R. Oh, right, I need to make sure I have the correct units for R. I think R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K. Oh wait, but the volume is given in dm³. Oh right, because 1 dm³ is equal to 1 liter. So V is 1.0 L.

Temperature is 25°C, so I need to convert that to Kelvin. Kelvin is Celsius plus 273.15, so 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 K. Let me just round that to 298 K for simplicity.

Now, let's plug in the numbers. P = (nRT)/V. n is 1.0 mole, R is 0.0821, T is 298 K, V is 1.0 L.

Calculating the numerator: 1.0 * 0.0821 * 298. Let me do that. 0.0821 * 298. Hmm, 0.08 * 300 is 24, but let me calculate accurately. 0.0821 * 298 = let's compute 0.0821 * 200 = 16.42, 0.0821 * 98 = about 8.0458. Add them together: 16.42 + 8.0458 = 24.4658. So the numerator is approximately 24.47 L·atm/mol·K * 1.0 mol. Wait, no—wait, the units: R is in L·atm/(mol·K), so nRT would have units (1 mol) * (L·atm/(mol·K)) * K) = L·atm. So P is (nRT)/V, which is (24.4658 L·atm) / 1.0 L = 24.4658 atm.

Wait, but that's approximately 24.5 atm. Let me check the options. Looking back, option H is 15 atm, G is 25, F is 35, J is 10, E is 18, I is 40, etc. Wait, 24.5 is closer to 25 atm. So the answer should be H, 25 atm.

Wait a second, but let me make sure I didn't mess up the calculation. Another way to think: R is 0.0821, so 0.0821 * 298 = let me compute more accurately.

298 * 0.08 = 23.84, 298 * 0.0021 = 0.6258. So 23.84 + 0.6258 = 24.4658. Yep, same result. So P = 24.4658 atm, which is approximately 24.5 atm. So the closest option is 25 atm, which is H. 

Wait, but another thought: I sometimes mix up which units to use. Oh, wait, the question says 1.0 Xe in 1.0 dm³. Are we using R with dm³? No, R is in terms of liters. Because 1 dm³ is 1 liter. So yes, the calculation is correct.

To calculate the pressure exerted by 1.0 mole of Xenon gas confined to 1.0 dm³ at 25°C, we use the ideal gas law: 

\[
PV = nRT
\]

### Given:
- \( n = 1.0 \, \text{mol} \)
- \( V = 1.0 \, \text{dm}^3 = 1.0 \, \text{L} \)
- \( T = 25^\circ \text{C} \)
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/mol·K} \)

### Step 1: Convert temperature to Kelvin
\[
T = 25^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 298.15 \, \text{K} \approx 298 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 2: Rearrange the ideal gas law to solve for \( P \)
\[
P = \frac{nRT}{V}
\]

### Step 3: Plug in the values
\[
P = \frac{(1.0)(0.0821)(298)}{1.0} = 24.4658 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated pressure is approximately 24.5 atm, which is closest to **25 atm**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: H**
