Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about daydreams and dreams. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what each term means. The question asks how daydreams differ from dreams. The options are labeled A through J, each giving a different description.

I remember from school that dreams and daydreams are both supposed to be similar but not identical. dreams are usually more vivid and have a deeper meaning, while daydreams are just temporary visual experiences that happen during sleep.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Says dreams are during sleep, daydreams during wakefulness. That sounds right, but I'm not sure if it's the only difference or if there's more to it.

Option B: dreams are subconscious desires, daydreams entertainment. Hmm, that seems correct too. So maybe B is a good answer.

Option C: Daydreams can be remembered, dreams not. I think that's inaccurate. I thought both can be remembered, but maybe in different ways.

Option D: Daydreams occur only at night, while dreams can happen anytime. Wait, no—daydreams are typically during sleep, which is usually during the night. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Daydreams are fantasies created during waking, closely related to reality. That seems correct. I remember that daydreams are more like fantasies, not necessarily tied to reality, whereas dreams are real and tied to reality.

Option F: Dreams controlled by waking consciousness. I'm not sure. I thought both daydreams and dreams involve some level of control, but maybe in different ways. Wait, no. I think that daydreams are more controlled by the brain's awareness, because they happen during sleep. So maybe E is correct.

Option G: Daydreams are during sleep, while dreams can happen anytime. That would mean that G is incorrect because daydreams are during sleep, while daydreams are a type of dream. Wait, no—G says daydreams occur during sleep, while others (like E) say daydreams are during waking. So if a person is in the middle of the night, they're doing daydreams. So G is incorrect because daydreams are only during sleep.

Option H: Both share the same characteristics. That's probably incorrect because I know they're different types of experiences.

Option I: Daydreams are a type of dream, and involve wish fulfillment. I think that's correct. Daydreams are considered a subset of dreams, and they do involve imagining things, which could be the wish part.

Option J: Daydreams are fantastical. I don't think that's right. Daydreams are just normal visual experiences, not fantastical.

So let me reevaluate the options:

Option A: They happen during sleep and wakefulness. So correct in their occurrence but maybe not about their meaning. So A is correct but doesn't explain the difference.

Option B: Correct in saying that daydreams are entertainment, but perhaps more accurate would be that daydreams are temporary and have a deeper meaning, while dreams are more complex and tied to reality.

Option C: Daydreams can be remembered, which might not be true. I think both can be remembered but in different ways.

Option E: Daydreams are created during waking, related to reality, and dreams are more about imagination. This seems accurate because I remember that daydreams are like a temporary, visual fantasy during sleep, and they can be recalled, while dreams are more about the actual experience of reality.

Option I: That's correct. Daydreams are a type of dream, and they involve wish fulfillment, but maybe not as much as most dreams.

So, the question is about the differing aspects between daydreams and dreams.

Option E says daydreams are created during waking and related to reality, while dreams are not controlled as much and are more about imagination.

So, which is the correct answer? Let me think again.

The correct options are B and E.

Wait, the original question is: "How do they differ from dreams?"

So, the correct answer would be the one that explains the difference.

Option E says that daydreams are created during a waking state and are related to reality, while dreams are not under control and are more about imagination.

Option B says that daydreams are manifestations of subconscious desires, while dreams are just entertainment.

Wait, but I'm pretty sure that daydreams are more about a temporary visual fantasy, while dreams are more about the actual experiencing of reality.

So, the difference is that daydreams are a kind of fantasy, while dreams are real. So option J says daydreams are fantastical. But I thought that's not accurate. I think daydreams are more like normal, temporary visual experiences.

Alternatively, option E includes that daydreams are not under control, while dreams are. So that's a key difference.

So the correct answer would be E. Because it distinguishes between daydreams (not controlled, related to reality, created during awake state) and dreams (created during sleep, controlled, more about reality).

Another way, E says daydreams are created during waking and are related to reality, while dreams are not controlled and occur during sleep.

So the correct answer is E.

The correct answer is E: Daydreams are fantasies created during a waking state which are controlled and closely related to reality, while dreams are not under control and the individual does not realize that he is dreaming.

Answer: E
