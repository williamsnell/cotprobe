The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Now, we have organized a society, and we call it "Share Our Wealth Society," a society with the motto "Every Man a King."…
We propose to limit the wealth of big men in the country. There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today.
We do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality … but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.…
We will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about a historical event involving the President and a senator. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about when the President, President FDR, responded to Senator Huey Long's proposal. The proposal was to limit the maximum wealth any individual could have to $50,000,000, aiming to prevent the so-called "big men" from accumulating too much wealth, which they thought would drive poverty and inequality. 

I remember that in the context of the FDR's time, there was a push towards social welfare programs. The FDR had introduced various support measures, including Social Security, which was supposed to help the elderly and the disabled, and other welfare programs. But at the same time, the President was pushing for redistribution. 

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which response the President gave in response to Senator Long's proposal. The options are labeled A through J, with each option suggesting a different action.

Option A: Abolishing Social Security. Hmm, I don't think that was the case. FDR's Social Security was a response to the Great Depression, not a response to the senator's proposal. That's more about financial assistance for the elderly, not limiting individual wealth.

Option B: Announcing not to run for re-election. That doesn't make sense. FDR was a successful president, and he would have been defeated by other candidates. So this option doesn't seem right.

Option C: Launching the Second New Deal, which includes Social Security and other programs. Wait, that's actually a statement that the FDR was making, not a response to someone else. It's part of the broader New Deal, which was a series of programs to support the economy during a depression.

Option D: Launching a military campaign to divert public attention. That doesn't align with the senator's proposal. The military campaign was more about national security and economic recovery, not directly related to wealth limits.

Option E: Diverting people's attention by allowing the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor. That's clearly unrelated. It's about a specific event and doesn't tie into the topic.

Option F: Proposing the "Every Man a King" policy. Wait, "Every Man a King" was a movement to ensure that everyone was equal, which was the motto of the society in the question. The FDR was pushing for a more progressive approach, not implementing equality. So this might be incorrect.

Option G: Implementing a policy to limit individual wealth to $50,000,000. That's exactly what the FDR was advocating. They were limiting individual wealth to prevent inequality and poverty, as per the senator's proposal. So this sounds correct.

Option H: Opposing any form of wealth redistribution. No, the FDR was promoting redistribution, not opposing it. They were trying to create a more equitable system.

Option I: Proposing a guaranteed minimum income. I don't think that was part of the FDR's policy either. They focused more on welfare and social security.

Option J: Urging Congress to cut taxes and deregulate the economy. That doesn't fit with the senator's proposal. The senator was trying to limit individual wealth, not the federal government.

Putting it all together, the President's response would have been to implement a policy of limiting individual wealth, which is option G. So the correct answer is G.

The correct answer is G: Implementing a policy to limit individual wealth to $50,000,000.
