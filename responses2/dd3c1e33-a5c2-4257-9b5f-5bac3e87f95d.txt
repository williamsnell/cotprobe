Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question is about neutralizing H3PO4 with KOH. They're asking how many milliliters of 0.250 M KOH are needed to completely neutralize 50.0 mL of 0.150 M H3PO4. The options are from A to J, and I need to find the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve a base and an acid reacting to form a salt and water. The general equation is acid + base → salt + water. But the specifics depend on the reaction stoichiometry.

Wait, H3PO4 is phosphoric acid, which is a triprotic acid. That means it can donate three protons. So, the reaction probably involves three steps. But for neutralization, I think it's about one mole of base reacting with one mole of acid. Because KOH is a strong base and H3PO4 is a weak acid. So perhaps each mole of KOH neutralizes one mole of H3PO4.

Wait, but H3PO4 is a diprotic acid? Or triprotic? Oh right, I think phosphoric acid is triprotic, so it can donate three protons. So, each molecule of KOH can neutralize one of those protons. Wait no, actually, each mole of KOH would neutralize one mole of H3PO4. Because each OH- from KOH would react with one H+ from the acid.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. Let's see, H3PO4 has three H+ ions. So, for each mole of KOH added, it neutralizes one mole of H+ from H3PO4. So, the number of moles of H+ in 50.0 mL of 0.150 M H3PO4 is 0.05 L * 0.150 mol/L = 0.0075 mol.

Since each mole of KOH neutralizes one mole of H3PO4, we'll need 0.0075 moles of KOH. KOH is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. The concentration is 0.250 M, which is 0.250 mol/L. So, the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.0075 / 0.250 = 0.03 L, which is 30 mL.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting 30 mL, which is option E. But let me double-check. Another approach: maybe the reaction is 1:1 in terms of H+ and OH-.

Wait, the neutralization reaction for H3PO4 and KOH would be:

H3PO4 + KOH → K3PO4 + H2O.

Wait, no, because H3PO4 is triprotic. So, the reaction would involve each base molecule neutralizing one acid molecule. Because KOH is a strong base, it will donate a proton (OH-) and react with the first H+ of H3PO4. Then, the second H+ would react with the second OH-, and so on. But for each mole of KOH, it can neutralize one mole of H3PO4's H+.

So, the reaction is 1:1. So, moles H3PO4 = moles KOH.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Let's write the neutralization equation properly. The reaction between H3PO4 and KOH. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate 3 protons. KOH is a strong base, so it will donate a proton (OH-) in a neutralization reaction. So, each mole of KOH can neutralize one mole of H+ from the acid. So, for each mole of H3PO4, you need 3 moles of KOH to neutralize all three H+.

Wait, that can't be right. Because in practice, when you have a diprotic acid and a strong base, you might need two moles of KOH for each mole of acid. But for triprotic, you'd need three moles. Oh wait, but perhaps the neutralization stops at the first H+ because the acid is weak. Wait, no, that's not right. H3PO4 is a weak acid, but it's triprotic. Strong bases like KOH can fully neutralize the acid.

Wait, but when you have a triprotic acid and a strong base, you can neutralize all three H+ as long as you have enough base. So each mole of KOH can neutralize one H+.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's think of it another way. Moles of H+ in H3PO4 is 3 * 0.05 L * 0.150 M = 0.0225 mol. KOH is a 1:1 ratio with H+ (as it's neutralizing H+), so moles of KOH needed is also 0.0225 mol. KOH concentration is 0.250 M, so volume is 0.0225 / 0.250 = 0.09 L, which is 90 mL.

Wait, that's conflicting with previous conclusion. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the protic nature of the acid affects the reaction. Let me think again.

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. So, each molecule can donate three protons. So, when you add KOH, each OH- will take a proton from an H+.

So, the reaction is:

H3PO4 + 3 KOH → K3PO4 + 3 H2O.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, that's a possible equation. So, each mole of H3PO4 reacts with three moles of KOH to form K3PO4 and water.

If that's the case, then the mole ratio is 1:3.

So, moles of KOH needed = 3 * moles of H3PO4.

So, moles of H3PO4: 0.05 L * 0.150 mol/L = 0.0075 mol.

So, KOH needed: 3 * 0.0075 = 0.0225 mol.

Volume = 0.0225 / 0.250 = 0.09 L = 90 mL.

Oh, so that would make the answer 90. So option B.

Wait, that's a different approach. So which is correct? Well, I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the stoichiometry is 1:1, but in reality, for each mole of H3PO4, you need three moles of KOH.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. Let's simplify with a simpler acid. Take H2SO4 (a diprotic acid). Then, a strong base like NaOH would react in a 1:1 ratio. So, H2SO4 + 2 NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O.

So, for each mole of H2SO4, you need two moles of KOH.

Similarly, for triprotic acid, each mole would require three moles of KOH. So, H3PO4 would require 3 moles KOH per mole.

So, in this case, after the reaction, the equation is:

H3PO4 + 3 KOH → K3PO4 + 3 H2O.

So, the moles of KOH is 3 times that of H3PO4.

So, 0.05 L * 0.150 mol/L = 0.0075 mol H3PO4.

So, KOH needed is 3 * 0.0075 = 0.0225 mol.

Volume = 0.0225 mol / 0.250 mol/L = 0.09 L = 90 mL. So, 90 mL of KOH is needed.

Looking at the options: option B is 90.0 mL.

Alternatively, another way to think is the neutralization reaction, each mole of H3PO4 reacts with 3 moles of KOH.

So, yes, 90 mL.

To determine how many milliliters of 0.250 M KOH are needed to neutralize 50.0 mL of 0.150 M H₃PO₄, we analyze the reaction between a triprotic acid (H₃PO₄) and a strong base (KOH). H₃PO₄ is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons (H⁺). KOH, being a strong base, will neutralize these protons in a 1:1 ratio for each H⁺. Therefore, the reaction is:

\[
\text{H₃PO₄} + 3 \text{KOH} \rightarrow \text{K₃PO₄} + 3 \text{H₂O}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H₃PO₄
The concentration of H₃PO₄ is 0.150 M, and the volume is 50.0 mL (0.050 L). The number of moles of H₃PO₄ is:

\[
\text{Moles of H₃PO₄} = 0.050 \, \text{L} \times 0.150 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.0075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine moles of KOH required
From the balanced reaction, 1 mole of H₃PO₄ reacts with 3 moles of KOH. Therefore, the moles of KOH required are:

\[
\text{Moles of KOH} = 3 \times 0.0075 \, \text{mol} = 0.0225 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the volume of KOH solution
The concentration of KOH is 0.250 M, which is 0.250 mol/L. The volume of KOH solution required is:

\[
\text{Volume of KOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of KOH}}{\text{Concentration of KOH}} = \frac{0.0225 \, \text{mol}}{0.250 \, \text{mol/L}} = 0.090 \, \text{L} = 90.0 \, \text{mL}.
\]

### Final Answer
The correct answer is **90.0 mL**, which corresponds to option **B**.
