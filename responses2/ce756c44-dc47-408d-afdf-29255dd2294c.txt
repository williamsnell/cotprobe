Okay, I need to simplify the expression (5x + 3) - 2(2x - 4). Let me break it down step by step. 

First, I'll distribute the -2 across the terms inside the parentheses. So, -2 times 2x is -4x, and -2 times -4 is +8. That gives me -4x +8.

Now, I can rewrite the original expression with this distribution: 5x + 3 -4x +8.

Next, I'll combine like terms. The x terms are 5x and -4x. Adding those together gives me (5x -4x) which is x. 

Then, the constant terms are 3 and 8. Adding those together gives 11. So putting it all together, I have x + 11.

Looking at the options, option B is x + 11. So the correct answer should be B.

The expression simplifies as follows:
1. Distribute the -2: (5x + 3) - 4x + 8.
2. Combine like terms: (5x - 4x) = x and (3 + 8) = 11.
3. Result: x + 11.

**Answer:** B: x+11
