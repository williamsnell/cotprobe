Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about research methods. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is asking which type of research methods are designed to elicit responses to predetermined, standardized questions from many respondents. The options are A through J, each corresponding to different research methods.

First, I'll read through each option to understand what they mean. 

Option A: Non-probability. I remember that non-probability sampling isn't based on the probability of selection. It's often used when probability methods aren't feasible. Common types include convenience, snowball, and quota sampling. Not sure how this relates yet.

Option B: Cross-sectional. Cross-sectional studies collect data from a population at a specific point in time. They're useful for understanding at a moment's snapshot, but do they typically have standardized questions? Maybe, but I'm not certain if this is the best fit for the question.

Option C: Qualitative. Qualitative research is about understanding concepts, phenomena, and experiences. It often uses methods like interviews, focus groups, and coding. These focus on understanding deeper meanings and perspectives, which might involve standard questions, but I'm not sure if they're primarily for gathering a lot of responses from many people.

Option D: Ethnographic. Ethnography is a qualitative approach where researchers observe and document the social practices of a group in their natural environment. It's used to understand the culture or society deeply. Again, more about understanding the context rather than gathering responses from many people.

Option E: Longitudinal. Longitudinal studies follow the same subjects over a period of time. They can be useful for tracking changes or trends but may not be designed to get a large number of responses from many people in one go. 

Option F: Experimental. Experimental studies involve manipulating variables to test hypotheses. This might involve controlled experiments, but I don't think it's about gathering responses from many people to a predetermined question.

Option G: Probability. Probability sampling is where each individual in the population has a known chance of being selected. Common methods include simple random, stratified, and systematic sampling. This is different from non-probability, but I'm not sure how it directly relates to the question.

Option H: Observational. Observational studies watch behaviors or events without intervention. They can collect data but might not be designed to get many responses from many people unless it's a large sample.

Option I: Case Study. A case study is a research method where a specific group or case is studied in depth. It can involve many cases, each with their own set of data, but it's more about qualitative analysis and understanding the case's unique characteristics rather than standard questions.

Option J: Quantitative. Quantitative research is numerical and statistical. It often uses methods like surveys and experiments to measure variables. This is good for gathering data from many respondents and analyzing patterns or relationships. For example, a survey asking a standardized question about satisfaction.

Now, the question is about methods that elicit responses to predetermined, standardized questions from many respondents. So they're looking for a method that's likely to collect a lot of data from a large group. 

Quantitative methods (J) are designed for this. They use standardized questions and are often used in surveys. For example, a survey with a yes/no question that's asked to many people. This fits the description.

The correct answer is **J: Quantitative**. Quantitative research uses standardized questions and allows for the collection of responses from many respondents, making it suitable for the described scenario. 

Answer: J
