Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to stoichiometry, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the volume of O₂ needed to burn 50 liters of CO completely, and then determining the volume of CO₂ formed. 

First, the balanced chemical equation given is 2CO + O₂ → 2CO₂. Hmm, I remember that in a balanced equation, the coefficients represent the mole ratios. So, 2 moles of CO react with 1 mole of O₂ to produce 2 moles of CO₂. Wait, that might be important for figuring out the volumes since we're dealing with gases.

Since the problem involves gases, and assuming they're at the same temperature and pressure, I remember that the volume ratio is the same as the mole ratio. So, 2 CO molecules react with 1 O₂ molecule. So, if I have 50 liters of CO, how much O₂ do I need?

Let me think. The reaction ratio is 2 moles CO : 1 mole O₂. So for every 2 liters of CO, I need 1 liter of O₂. Wait, no. Because in reality, the reaction is 2 moles (so 2L if they're at same conditions) of CO reacting with 1 mole (1L) of O₂. So the volume of O₂ required should be half the volume of CO, right?

Wait, let me write it down. The balanced equation is 2 CO + 1 O₂ → 2 CO₂. So, the mole ratio is 2:1:2. So for every 2 moles of CO, 1 mole of O₂ is used.

But we have 50 liters of CO. So, the moles of CO is 50 L, assuming standard conditions. So, the moles of O₂ needed would be (1/2) * 50 liters because 2 moles of CO require 1 mole O₂. So that's 25 liters of O₂ needed.

Wait, but wait. Because in the problem, maybe it's 50 liters of CO, and the reaction is 2CO → O₂. So, the volume of O₂ needed is half the CO volume. So, 50 liters CO → 25 liters O₂. So the O₂ volume is 25 liters.

Now, what about the CO₂ formed? Each 2 moles of CO produce 2 moles of CO₂, so the mole ratio is 1:1. So, for every 2 liters of CO, you get 2 liters of CO₂. So, 50 liters CO would produce 50 liters CO₂.

So, putting it together: O₂ needed is 25 liters, CO₂ produced is 50 liters. Now, looking at the options, let me check.

Looking at the options:

Option H: O₂ 50, CO₂ 25 — no, that's O2 double what it should be, and CO2 is wrong.

Option J: O2 25, CO2 50 — that's exactly what I calculated. So the answer should be option J.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations. So, 2 CO + O₂ → 2 CO₂. So, per 2 CO, 1 O₂ is consumed. So, 50 CO would require (50 / 2) * 1 =25 O₂. And produces 50 CO₂. So yes, 25 and 50 liters. So option J is correct.

To determine the volume of O₂ required to burn 50 liters of CO completely and the volume of CO₂ formed, we use the balanced chemical equation: 

**2CO + O₂ → 2CO₂**

From the equation, the mole ratio of CO to O₂ is 2:1, and the mole ratio of CO to CO₂ is also 1:1. Since the volumes of gases are directly proportional to their moles at the same temperature and pressure, the same applies to the volumes.

1. **Volume of O₂ required**:  
   For every 2 liters of CO, 1 liter of O₂ is needed.  
   Given 50 liters of CO, the volume of O₂ required is:  
   \[
   \text{Volume of O₂} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ liters}.
   \]

2. **Volume of CO₂ formed**:  
   For every 2 liters of CO, 2 liters of CO₂ are produced.  
   Given 50 liters of CO, the volume of CO₂ formed is:  
   \[
   \text{Volume of CO₂} = 50 \text{ liters}.
   \]

Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct choice is **J: O₂ volume is 25 liters and CO₂ volume is 50 liters**.
