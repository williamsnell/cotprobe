Okay, so I have this question about Clarence Darrow's beliefs about life's meaning. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with Darrow, but I know he was a famous American tissues writer. I'm trying to remember what he thought about life. Let me think about his notable quotes or what people generally say about him.

I remember he was known for his humor and his views on life. He often made fun of people who tried to make the world meaningful. Wait, was he against the idea that life is meaningful? Or did he think it was? I think he was against the concept of meaning in life. He wrote a lot about the pursuit of meaning being an irrational desire.

So looking at the options, let's see. Option B says life was a gift to be cherished and enjoyed. That sounds more like a positive view, not Darrow's stance. Option C says life was hard but worthwhile. I'm not sure about that. Darrow's views were probably more about the absence of meaning rather than being hard.

Option E and F seem like they're more about the unpredictability and the lack of reward. But I don't recall Darrow being against randomness or lack of purpose. Option G says life was uncertain but ultimately rewarding. That sounds like he thought there's an end to the journey, so maybe he had a positive view of life's meaning.

Wait, I also remember that Darrow wrote about the idea that life is a struggle, and he often spoke about the meaning being elusive. He was critical of people who tried to make life meaningful. So his main point was that there's no ultimate meaning, and it's just a journey. So looking at the options, option G says life was uncertain but ultimately rewarding. That fits, because he thought there's no ultimate purpose, but life is a journey with moments of meaning.

Other options: Option I says life was not worthwhile, which I think he didn't support. Option C's "hard but worthwhile" doesn't fit. So the best answer should be G.
