Question:

Circle Electronics can produce and sell x number of calculators a month. If it costs x^2 dollars to produce x number of calculators and each calculator is sold wholesale at $100, how many calculators should Circle Electronics produce monthly to maximize its profit?

Options:

A: 110
B: 75
C: 80
D: 30
E: 25
F: 40
G: 100
H: 50
I: 60
J: 90

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Circle Electronics producing calculators to maximize profit. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, the problem says that producing x number of calculators a month costs x squared dollars. So the cost function is C(x) = x² dollars. Each calculator is sold for $100, so the revenue from selling x calculators would be R(x) = 100x dollars. 

Profit is generally calculated as total revenue minus total cost. So the profit function, P(x), would be P(x) = R(x) - C(x). Plugging in the equations I have, that makes P(x) = 100x - x². 

I remember that to find the maximum profit, I need to find the vertex of this quadratic function because the parabola opens downward (since the coefficient of x² is negative). The vertex will give the x-value where the profit is the highest.

The formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex in a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c is x = -b/(2a). In this case, a is -1 (from -x²) and b is 100 (from 100x). So plugging those in: x = -100/(2*(-1)) = -100/(-2) = 50. 

Wait, so x is 50. That means Circle Electronics should produce 50 calculators monthly to maximize their profit. Let me check the options. Option H is 50, so that should be the answer.

The profit function is derived by subtracting the cost from the revenue, resulting in P(x) = 100x - x². The vertex of this quadratic function (which opens downward) gives the maximum profit. Using the vertex formula x = -b/(2a), where a = -1 and b = 100, we find x = 50. Thus, Circle Electronics should produce 50 calculators monthly.

Answer: H
