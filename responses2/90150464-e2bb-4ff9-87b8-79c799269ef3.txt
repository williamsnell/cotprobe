Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the area bounded by the parabola y = x² and the lines y = 1 and y = 9. Hmm, let's see. I remember that to find the area between curves, I need to integrate the difference between the upper and lower functions over the interval where they intersect.

First, I should figure out the points where these curves intersect. The parabola y = x² intersects y = 1 when x² = 1, so x = ±1. Similarly, it intersects y = 9 when x² = 9, so x = ±3. So the area we're looking at is between x = -3 and x = 3.

Wait, but since the functions are symmetric about the y-axis, I can calculate the area from x=0 to x=3 and then double it. That might make the integration easier.

So, for each x between 0 and 3, the upper function is y = 9 and the lower function is y = x². Therefore, the area for one side (from 0 to 3) is the integral from 0 to 3 of (9 - x²) dx. Then, multiply by 2 to account for both sides.

Let me set up the integral:

Area = 2 * [ ∫ from 0 to 3 (9 - x²) dx ]

Now, integrate term by term. The integral of 9 dx is 9x, and the integral of x² dx is (x³)/3. So,

∫ (9 - x²) dx = [9x - (x³)/3] evaluated from 0 to 3.

Calculating at x = 3:
9*(3) = 27
(3)^3 /3 = 27/3 = 9
So 27 - 9 = 18.

At x = 0, it's 0, so the definite integral from 0 to 3 is 18.

Multiply by 2 for both sides (left and right sides of the y-axis):
2 * 18 = 36.

Wait, but let me check again. The options don't include 36. Hmm, wait perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the integral.

Wait, another approach: instead of splitting the integral into two parts, maybe it's easier to integrate from -3 to 3. But since the integrand is even (symmetric), integrating from 0 to 3 and multiplying by 2 is the same as integrating from -3 to 3. So that's correct.

Wait, but the options given are A: 32, B:84/3, C:144/3, D:8, E:128/3, F:96/3, G:72/3, H:104/3, I:64, J:64√2/3.

36 is not among the options. Did I make a mistake in the integration?

Wait, let me recalculate. The integral of (9 - x²) from 0 to 3.

The antiderivative is 9x - (x³)/3.

At 3: 9*3 = 27; (3)^3 =27, so 27/3=9. 27 -9=18.

At 0: 0. So the integral is 18.

Multiply by 2 gives 36.

Wait, but maybe I should check the limits again. The lines y=1 and y=9 are horizontal lines, so for each y between 1 and 9, the x-values range from the parabola to the lines.

Alternatively, perhaps I should integrate with respect to y instead. Let me try that.

When integrating with respect to y, I can express x in terms of y. From y = x², x = ±√y. So the area can be written as twice the integral from y=1 to y=9 of ( (3) - (1) ) dy, since at each y, the x extends from -sqrt(y) to sqrt(y), but since we're considering the area from x=1 to x=3 and x=-3 to x=-1, maybe I should compute the area as two separate integrals or perhaps think differently.

Wait, no, perhaps using horizontal slices is better. Wait, for horizontal slices, each slice at height y has width from x = -sqrt(y) to x = sqrt(y), which is 2 sqrt(y). So the area would be the integral from y=1 to y=9 of 2 sqrt(y) dy.

Wait, let's see. Wait, wait, no: when you use horizontal slices (i.e., integrating with respect to y), each horizontal strip has a height of dy and a width of (sqrt(y) - (-sqrt(y))) = 2 sqrt(y). So the area is ∫ from y=1 to y=9 of 2 sqrt(y) dy.

Compute that integral:

The integral of sqrt(y) dy is (2/3) y^(3/2). So, multiplied by 2, it's (4/3) y^(3/2).

Evaluated from 1 to 9:

At 9: (4/3)*(9)^(3/2) = (4/3)*(27) = 36.
At 1: (4/3)*(1) = 4/3.

Subtracting: 36 - 4/3 = (108/3 - 4/3) = 104/3.

Wait, but 104/3 is one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:32, B:84/3, C:144/3, D:8, E:128/3, F:96/3, G:72/3, H:104/3, I:64, J:64√2/3.

Yes, option H is 104/3. So the correct answer should be H: 104/3.

Wait, but earlier I thought I had 36, which isn't an option. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.

Wait, in the first approach, I thought the area was 36. But when integrating with respect to y, I got 104/3, which is approximately 34.666... which is indeed 36 minus 1.333 (since 104/3 = 34.666... and 36 is 36.0, so 36 - 1.333... = 34.666...). So perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.

Wait, wait, no, let me recheck the first approach. Wait, the first approach was integrating from x=0 to x=3, computing the area as 18, then multiplying by 2 to get 36.

But wait, in that approach, integrating from x=-3 to x=3, the function is (9 - x²), so the integral is 2*(the integral from 0 to 3 of (9 - x²) dx), which is 2*18=36.

But in the second approach, integrating with respect to y, I should get the same result.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Let me recompute the second approach.

Wait, the area when integrating with respect to y is ∫ from y=1 to y=9 of 2*sqrt(y) dy.

The integral of 2*sqrt(y) dy is 2*(2/3)*y^(3/2) = (4/3) y^(3/2).

Evaluated from 1 to 9:

At y=9: (4/3)*(9)^(3/2) = (4/3)*(27) = 36.

At y=1: (4/3)*(1) = 4/3.

So the area is 36 - 4/3 = (108/3 - 4/3) = 104/3. Yes, that's correct.

So why did I get 36 earlier? Oh, wait, perhaps I confused the limits. Because when I'm integrating with respect to x, I should consider that the area is between y=1 and y=9, so the integral would be from x=-3 to x=3, and for each x, the top function is y=9 and the bottom is y=x². So the integral is ∫ from x=-3 to x=3 of (9 - x²) dx.

But since (9 - x²) is even, the integral from -3 to 3 is 2 * ∫ from 0 to 3 of (9 - x²) dx, which is 2*18=36.

But when integrating with respect to y, the area is ∫ from y=1 to y=9 of 2 sqrt(y) dy = (4/3) y^(3/2) evaluated from 1 to 9, which gives 36 - 4/3 = 104/3. Wait, wait, that can't be. Because 104/3 is about 34.666, but 36 is higher, which doesn't make sense because when you integrate with respect to y, the area should be larger than integrating with respect to x.

Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you integrate with respect to y, the function is 2 sqrt(y) dy, and the integral is (4/3) y^(3/2) from 1 to 9, which is (4/3)*(27) - (4/3)*(1) = 36 - 4/3 = (108 -4)/3 = 104/3. So 104/3 ≈34.666..., which is less than 36. That doesn't make sense because the area should be larger when integrating with respect to x. Because when you integrate with respect to x, the width varies more.

Wait, but no. Wait, when integrating with respect to y, the functions are in terms of y, so the area is ∫ 2*sqrt(y) dy from y=1 to y=9. That should be larger than ∫ 2*sqrt(y) dy from y=0 to y=1, or something like that. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that when integrating with respect to y, I think I should have considered the area as integrating from y=1 to y=9, but the width at each y is 2x, which is 2 sqrt(y). So the integral of 2 sqrt(y) dy from 1 to 9 is indeed 104/3.

Wait, but when I did the x approach, I got 36, which is approximately 36, which is less than 104/3 (~34.666). That can't be. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the x approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the area using two integrals. Let me do that.

The area can be split into two parts: from x=-3 to x=-1, and from x=1 to x=3.

For x between -3 and -1, the upper function is y=9 and the lower is y=x².

Similarly for x between 1 and 3.

So for each of these intervals, the area is ∫ from x=a to x=b of (9 - x²) dx.

So the total area is 2 * ∫ from x=1 to x=3 of (9 - x²) dx.

Which is 2*( [9x - x³/3] from 1 to 3 ).

Calculating at 3: 27 - 9 = 18. At 1: 9 - 1/3 = 8.666... So 18 - 8.666 = 9.333..., multiplied by 2 gives 18.666..., which is 56/3. Wait, that's not matching anything.

Wait, but earlier, the y approach gave 104/3, which is approximately 34.666. But the x approach is giving 18.666, which is 56/3, which is larger than 36? No, 56/3 is about 18.666, which is less than 36.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. So I must have messed up the x approach.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think again.

In the x approach, when integrating from x=-3 to x=-1, the function is the same as from x=1 to x=3 because it's symmetric. So each of these regions contributes the same area. So let me compute the area from x=1 to x=3 and double it.

∫ from 1 to 3 of (9 - x²) dx = [9x - x³/3] from 1 to 3.

At 3: 27 - 9 = 18.

At 1: 9 - 1/3 = 8.666... So 18 - 8.666... = 9.333... = 28/3.

Wait, no, 8.666 is 26/3, because 8 is 24/3, so 24/3 + 2/3 = 26/3. So 18 is 54/3. So 54/3 - 26/3 = 28/3, which is about 9.333.

So the area from x=1 to x=3 is 28/3, and the same area from x=-1 to x=-3. So total area is 2*(28/3) = 56/3.

But that's different from both the x and y integrals. So now I'm confused because I have three different results: 36, 104/3, 56/3, and 64.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in my approaches.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area by subtracting the areas of the regions outside the parabola but inside the horizontal lines from the total area under y=9.

The total area under y=9 from x=-3 to x=3 is 9 * 6 = 54.

Wait, actually, the area under y=9 from x=-3 to x=3 is a rectangle with height 9 and width 6 (from -3 to 3 is 6 units), so area 54.

Now, the area under the parabola y=x² from x=-3 to x=3 is 2 * ∫ from 0 to 3 of x² dx.

Which is 2*( (x³)/3 from 0 to 3 ) = 2*(9) = 18.

So the area between y=1 and y=9 and under the parabola is the area under y=9 minus the area under parabola from x=-3 to x=3.

Wait, but wait. The area between y=1 and y=9 is the area from y=1 to y=9, which might not be the same as the area under y=9 minus the area under the parabola.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the area between the two horizontal lines y=1 and y=9, and the parabola.

Wait, perhaps the region is bounded by the parabola and the lines y=1 and y=9. So the area is the area between y=1 and y=9, under the parabola.

Wait, but the area can be found as the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola.

So the area from y=1 to y=9 under the parabola y=x² is the integral from y=1 to y=9 of 2 sqrt(y) dy.

Wait, that's exactly what I did earlier, which gives 104/3. So that's the same as the earlier result.

But wait, when I computed the area under y=9 and subtracted the area under the parabola, I got 54 - 18 = 36. Which is the same as the first approach, but that contradicts the y approach which gave 104/3.

Wait, so 104/3 is approximately 34.666, which is less than 36. That can't be right because the area should be larger than the area under the parabola but under y=9.

Wait, but the area under y=9 from x=-3 to x=3 is 54, the area under parabola is 18, so 54 - 18 = 36 is the area under the parabola, but that's the area under the parabola under y=9. Wait, but we're looking for the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola. So perhaps that's a different region.

Wait, perhaps the region is bounded by y=1, y=9, and y=x². So it's the area between the parabola and the lines y=1 and y=9.

Wait, so perhaps I should integrate from y=1 to y=9, and for each y, find the x-values. So for each y, the x ranges from -sqrt(y) to sqrt(y), but only where y is between 1 and 9.

So the area is ∫ from y=1 to y=9 of (2 sqrt(y)) dy.

Wait, that's exactly what I did earlier, which gives 104/3. So that's 34.666..., which is about 34.666.

Wait, but the area under y=9 is 54, so the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola is 104/3.

But why when I did the x-integration from 1 to 3, I got 56/3, which is about 18.666.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the x approach.

Wait, when I did the x approach, I considered the area from x=1 to x=3, multiplied by 2 because it's symmetric. So that's 2 * (28/3) = 56/3, which is approximately 18.666. But that doesn't match the y approach's 104/3.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the x approach. Let me recompute.

The area under y=9 from x=1 to x=3 is ∫ from 1 to 3 of 9 dx = 9*(3-1) = 18.

Similarly, the area from x=-3 to x=-1 is ∫ from -3 to -1 of 9 dx = 18. So total area is 18+18=36.

But that's the area under y=9, but the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola is different.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola by integrating with respect to y.

So, the area is ∫ from y=1 to y=9 of 2 sqrt(y) dy = (4/3) y^(3/2) evaluated from 1 to 9.

At y=9: (4/3)*(27) = 36.

At y=1: (4/3)*(1) = 4/3.

Subtracting: 36 - 4/3 = (108/3 - 4/3) = 104/3.

Wait, that's about 34.666, which is less than 36. That can't be right because the area under the parabola should be larger than the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The area under y=9 from x=-3 to x=3 is 54.

The area under the parabola y=x² from x=-3 to x=3 is 18.

So the area between y=1 and y=9 and under the parabola is 54 - 18 = 36, which is what I got in the first approach.

But wait, that can't be right because the area under the parabola is 18, and the area between y=1 and y=9 is 36, so that's correct. So why does the y approach give 104/3?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, when I set up the y integral, I thought of the area between the lines y=1 and y=9 and the parabola. But perhaps I made a mistake in the limits.

Wait, perhaps the correct y integral is from y=1 to y=9, and for each y, x ranges from -sqrt(y) to sqrt(y), so the area is ∫ from y=1 to y=9 of 2 sqrt(y) dy.

Which is (4/3) y^(3/2) evaluated from 1 to 9, which is (4/3)*(27) - (4/3)*(1) = 36 - 4/3 = 104/3.

But this is the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola. But the area under the parabola from x=-3 to x=3 is 18, which is less than 36. So that can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the y integration. Because integrating from y=1 to y=9 of 2 sqrt(y) dy gives 104/3, which is 34.666, which is larger than 18, which is the area under the parabola.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the area under the parabola is 18, so the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola should be larger than 18.

Wait, no, actually, no. Because the area under the parabola is 18, the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola is the area that is between the parabola and the lines y=1 and y=9. So it's the area under the parabola minus the area above the parabola but under y=9.

Wait, that makes more sense.

So the area under the parabola is 18.

The area above the parabola but under y=9 is the integral from x=-3 to x=3 of (9 - x²) dx, which is 2*( ∫ from 0 to 3 of (9 - x²) dx ).

Which is 2*( [9x - x³/3] from 0 to 3 ) = 2*(27 - 9) = 2*18 = 36.

Wait, but that can't be right because the area under the parabola is 18, and the area above the parabola is 36, which is much larger. That can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral.

Wait, let me recompute the integral of (9 - x²) from x=0 to x=3.

∫ (9 - x²) dx from 0 to 3 is [9x - (x³)/3] from 0 to 3.

At x=3: 27 - 9 = 18.

At x=0: 0 - 0 = 0.

So the integral is 18 - 0 = 18.

So the area under the parabola from x=-3 to x=3 is 2*18 = 36.

Wait, that's correct because the area under the parabola is the integral from x=-3 to x=3 of x² dx, which is 2*( ∫ from 0 to 3 of x² dx ) = 2*( (27)/3 ) = 2*9 = 18. So the area under the parabola is 18, and the area under y=9 is 54.

So the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola is 54 - 18 = 36, which is the same as the area under the parabola itself.

But that doesn't make sense because the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola should be the area that is between the parabola and the lines y=1 and y=9.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it as the integral from y=1 to y=9 of the area under the parabola at each y.

Wait, but that's the same as the area under the parabola minus the area above the parabola.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola, which is the integral from y=1 to y=9 of 2 sqrt(y) dy = 104/3.

Wait, but that would mean that the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola is 104/3, which is larger than the area under the parabola itself, which is 18.

That doesn't make sense because the area under the parabola is 18, so how can the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola be larger than that?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Wait, let me compute 104/3.

104 divided by 3 is approximately 34.666. That's correct.

Wait, but 104/3 is the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola. But the area under the parabola from x=-3 to x=3 is 18. So how can the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola be 34.666, which is larger than 18?

Wait, no, that's impossible. Because the area under the parabola is 18, so the area between the parabola and the lines y=1 and y=9 under the parabola can't be larger than 18.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the correct integral is ∫ from x=1 to x=3 of (9 - x²) dx, which is (4/3) y^(3/2) evaluated from 1 to 3, which is (4/3)*(27) - (4/3)*(1) = 36 - 4/3 = 104/3.

Wait, but that's the same as the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola, which can't be larger than the area under the parabola itself, which is 18.

So I must be making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct area is (54 - 18) = 36, which is the area under the parabola from x=-3 to x=3, which is 18, and the area under y=9 is 54, so the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola is 36. But that can't be correct because 36 is larger than 18.

Wait, but 18 is the area under the parabola, and the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola is 36, which is larger, which is impossible.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the area between the lines y=1 and y=9 and the parabola y=x².

So the area is the area under y=9 from x=-3 to x=3, minus the area under the parabola from x=-3 to x=3.

So that's 54 - 18 = 36.

But that can't be, because the area between the lines and the parabola should be less than 18, not more.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the area bounded by y=1, y=9, and y=x², which is the area between the lines y=1 and y=9 and the parabola y=x².

So the area is the area under y=9 from x=-3 to x=3, minus the area under the parabola from x=-3 to x=3.

Wait, but the area under the parabola is 18, and the area under y=9 is 54, so 54 - 18 = 36.

But that's larger than 18, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the area between y=1 and y=9 and the parabola y=x², but that area is 104/3, which is approximately 34.666.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because I'm not sure which area is the correct one.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options.

The options are:

A: 32/3

B: 84/3

C: 104/3

D: 64

So 104/3 is option C.

Hmm.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the area under the parabola is 18, so the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola is 54 - 18 = 36, which is option A.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the area is the area between y=1, y=9, and the parabola y=x².

So that area is the area under y=9 minus the area under the parabola.

Wait, but that gives 54 - 18 = 36, which is option A.

Wait, but that would be the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it as the area between the lines y=1 and y=9 and the parabola y=x².

So for each y, the area is the integral from x=-sqrt(y) to x=sqrt(y) of 1 dx, which is 2 sqrt(y).

So the area is ∫ from y=1 to y=9 of 2 sqrt(y) dy = (4/3) y^(3/2) from 1 to 9.

At y=9: (4/3)*27 = 36.

At y=1: (4/3)*1 = 4/3.

Subtracting: 36 - 4/3 = 104/3.

So that's option C.

Ah! So that's the correct approach.

So the area is 104/3, which is option C.

I think I confused myself earlier by considering the area under the parabola as 18, but that's not the case. Actually, the area under the parabola from x=-3 to x=3 is 18, but the area between y=1 and y=9 under the parabola is 104/3.

So the correct answer is option C, 104/3.
</think>

The area between the lines \( y = 1 \), \( y = 9 \), and the parabola \( y = x^2 \) can be found by integrating the horizontal slices from \( y = 1 \) to \( y = 9 \). For each \( y \), the width of the slice is \( 2\sqrt{y} \), and the area is:

\[
\int_{1}^{9} 2\sqrt{y} \, dy = \left[ \frac{4}{3} y^{3/2} \right]_{1}^{9} = \frac{4}{3} \cdot 27 - \frac{4}{3} \cdot 1 = 36 - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{104}{3}
\]

Thus, the area is \( \frac{104}{3} \), which corresponds to option C.

**Answer:** C
