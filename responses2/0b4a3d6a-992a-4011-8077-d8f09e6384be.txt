Okay, so I have this problem here: Mike sold an automobile. The cost was $12,640 and he sold it for $11,628.80. And I need to find out what percent the selling price is of the cost. The options are A to J, with various percentages. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that to find what percent one number is of another, you use the formula: (Part / Whole) * 100. In this case, the part is the selling price, and the whole is the cost price. So, the part is $11,628.80 and the whole is $12,640. 

Let me write that down: (11,628.80 / 12,640) * 100. I think that's the right formula. Now, I need to calculate that. Let me do the division first.

11,628.80 divided by 12,640. Hmm, let's see. Maybe I can simplify this. Both numbers are divisible by 16? Let me check: 11,628.80 divided by 16 is 726.8, and 12,640 divided by 16 is 790. So now it's 726.8 / 790. That seems easier to handle.

Wait, but maybe I can do it without simplifying. Alternatively, I can use a calculator approach mentally. Let's see, 12,640 goes into 11,628.80 how many times? Since 12,640 is larger than 11,628, the result will be less than 1.

Let me calculate 11,628.80 divided by 12,640. Let me compute this step by step. Let's see, 12,640 x 0.9 is 11,376. Because 12,640 * 0.1 is 1,264, so 12,640 * 0.9 is 12,640 - (12,640 * 0.1) = 12,640 - 1,264 = 11,376. 

Wait, but 11,628.80 is more than 11,376. So 0.9 gives us 11,376. The difference between 11,628.80 and 11,376 is 252.80. So how much more do we need to add to 0.9 to get to 11,628.80? 

Let me see, 252.80 divided by 12,640 is the fraction. So 252.80 / 12,640 = 0.02. So total is 0.9 + 0.02 = 0.92. Therefore, the ratio is 0.92. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 92%. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because 12,640 * 0.92 is 12,640 * (92/100) = (12,640 * 92) / 100. Let me compute that.

Compute 12,640 * 92. Let's break it down: 12,640 * 90 = 1,137,600 and 12,640 * 2 = 25,280. Adding them gives 1,137,600 + 25,280 = 1,162,880. Then, divide by 100 gives 11,628.80, which matches the selling price. So yes, 0.92 is correct.

Looking back at the options, option B is 92%, so that's the answer.

The selling price is $11,628.80 and the cost is $12,640. To find the percentage, we calculate (11,628.80 / 12,640) * 100 = 92%. 

Answer: B
