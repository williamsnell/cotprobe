Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the main purpose of licensing public relations practitioners. Let me think through what I know.

The question is asking what the main purpose of licensing is. The options are A through I, and the last character of the answer must match the chosen letter.

First, I remember that licensing is a common practice in various professions. It allows professionals to earn a salary while they become established. But the options here are about the purpose of licensing, not the act of earning.

Option A: To achieve better wages for licensed practitioners. That sounds right because licensing is often tied to income. You pay more to get your license, so that makes sense.

Option B: To create an elite of public relations practitioners. Well, creating an elite might be part of the purpose, but the main purpose is probably more about the act itself rather than creating an elite.

Option C: To regulate access to posts in the field. That's probably a part of licensing, but the main purpose is probably not about regulating access but rather about providing a pathway to professional success.

Option D: To mandate continued professional education for practitioners. Licensing is a way to encourage more education and certifications because without it, they can't proceed. So this makes sense too.

Option E: To increase government control over public relations. I'm not sure about this. I think regulating access is more about regulation. Maybe not the main purpose.

Option F: To provide a revenue stream for professional organizations. That's true, but the main purpose isn't just to make money; it's to allow professionals to work and earn.

Option G: To preserve the well-being of society. That could be a reason, but it's more about the broader societal impact rather than licensing's primary purpose.

Option H: To inflate the cost of public relations services. I don't think licensing is about inflating costs; it's about providing access and earning.

Option I: To limit competition in the field. Licensing could prevent people from entering the field, but that's more of a barrier than a primary purpose.

Option J: Not listed here, but I don't think it's an option.

So, the main purpose is likely about providing a pathway for professionals to earn money. Licensing allows them to earn a salary while they become a licensed PR professional. So, that would make option A correct.

Option D says licensing mandates continued education. That's true, but the main purpose is about earning, not just requiring education. So A seems more correct than D.

The primary purpose of licensing public relations practitioners is to provide a pathway for them to earn a salary while becoming established professionals. This makes option A correct.

Answer: A
