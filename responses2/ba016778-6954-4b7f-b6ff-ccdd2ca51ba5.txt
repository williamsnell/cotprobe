Okay, so I've got this genetics question here. Let me see what it's about. The question is about autosomal recessive traits and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Hmm, I remember from my class that Hardy-Weinberg helps predict allele frequencies, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terms.

The question says that a certain autosomal recessive trait is expressed in 1% of the population. I need to find what percent of the population are carriers but don't express the trait. Oh wait, carriers usually mean they have one dominant and one recessive allele, right? Because in recessive traits, you need two copies to show the trait.

Wait, so the trait is recessive. So the affected individuals are homozygous recessive. In Hardy-Weinberg terms, that's the aa genotype. The other genotypes are AA (homozygous dominant) and Aa (heterozygous carriers).

The frequency of the recessive phenotype is given as 1%, so that's the aa individuals. In the Hardy-Weinberg model, the frequency of the aa genotype is p squared (since both parents contribute a recessive allele). So p squared equals 0.01. To find p, I take the square root of 0.01, which is 0.1. So p is 0.1.

Wait, but what's p here? Oh wait, p is the frequency of the dominant allele. So the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 1 minus p. So q would be 0.9.

Now, the question is about carriers, which are the heterozygotes Aa. The Hardy-Weinberg formula also tells us that the frequency of Aa is 2pq. Let me plug the numbers in. So 2 * 0.1 * 0.9. Let me calculate that.

0.1 multiplied by 0.9 is 0.09, then multiplied by 2 is 0.18. So 18% of the population are carriers. So looking at the options, I need to find which letter corresponds to 18%. Let me check the options.

Options are A:27%, B:40%, C:10%, D:45%, E:60%, F:20%, G:30%, H:2%, I:50%, J:18%. So J is 18%. So the answer should be J.

To determine the percentage of the population that are carriers but do not express the trait, we use the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The trait is recessive, and it is expressed in 1% of the population, meaning the frequency of the aa genotype (recessive phenotype) is 0.01. Using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is calculated as:

\[
q^2 = 0.01 \implies q = \sqrt{0.01} = 0.1
\]

The frequency of the dominant allele (p) is:

\[
p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9
\]

Carriers are heterozygotes (Aa), and their frequency is given by:

\[
2pq = 2 \times 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.18
\]

This corresponds to 18% of the population. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: 18%**

Answer: J
