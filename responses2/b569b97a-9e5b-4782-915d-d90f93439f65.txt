Question:

Two cars were driving within the legal speed limit as they approached an intersection. There are no traffic lights, stop signs, or warnings posted at this intersection. Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously and collided. In the accident, one of the drivers suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries. Although the other driver's truck was slightly damaged, he did not suffer any physical injuries. Thereafter, the injured driver sued the city for negligence, claiming that the city failed to provide adequate warning at the intersection, which she contended was particularly dangerous and heavily traveled. At trial, the city attorney offers evidence that the intersection has been the same for 14 years, and no other accidents have occurred during that time. Upon objection by the injured driver's attorney, this evidence should be

Options:

A: excluded, because it is improper negative evidence.
B: admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence to the action.
C: admitted, as it is critical for the jury to understand the history of the intersection.
D: excluded, because the dangers of unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues may tend to mislead the jury.
E: admitted, but only if the city can prove that there have been no significant changes in traffic patterns in the last 14 years.
F: excluded, because it can potentially bias the jury against the injured driver.
G: excluded, because it is irrelevant to the current accident.
H: admitted, as it shows the city's negligence in maintaining the intersection.
I: excluded, as it is not directly related to the case at hand.
J: admitted, provided that the jury is instructed about the danger of inferential negative evidence.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about negligence at an intersection and evidence presented during a jury trial. 

The scenario is two cars collided at an intersection where no traffic lights, signs, or warnings were posted. Both entered the intersection simultaneously, and one driver suffered a broken pelvis. The other driver's truck was slightly damaged. The injured driver sued the city for negligence, claiming the city didn't provide adequate warnings, which was particularly dangerous and heavily traveled. The city attorney brings evidence about the intersection being the same for 14 years with no other accidents. The question is whether this evidence should be admitted.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in criminal law, evidence of a fact of consequence is important. A fact of consequence is something that affects the outcome of the case. So, if the city's attorney presents evidence about the intersection's history, that's probably relevant.

Wait, but what about the standard of proof for such evidence? For criminal cases, under the Federal Rules of Evidence 503(c), evidence of a fact of consequence must be admissible despite the requirement for a preponderance of the evidence. So, the city's evidence would need to meet this standard. But the issue here is about legal theory, not the legal standards of proof beyond that. So the legal standard (like preponderance vs. preponderance of the favorable interest) might not apply here.

The key here is whether the evidence is admissible as a fact of consequence. Since the question is about whether the evidence (the 14-year history) should be admitted, I think it's about whether the evidence is admissible. 

Wait, but the options are about whether the evidence is excluded or admitted. So the city's attorney is presenting the 14-year record. The question is whether this should be admitted.

I think that evidence of a fact of consequence is admissible only if it's relevant to the case. The injured driver's attorney is arguing that the evidence should be excluded because it's improper negative evidence. Wait, what's improper negative evidence? Oh, right, under Rule 504(3), negative evidence of a fact of consequence is proper if it's admissible as such. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Wait, Rule 504(3) says that a non-positive evidence of a fact of consequence, if it is "properly negative," is admissible. So if the evidence is negative and it's a fact of consequence, it's admissible if it's admissible as a fact of consequence.

So the city's 14-year history is positive or negative? Well, the city attorney's evidence would be positive â€“ that the intersection was the same for a long time. But for a fact of consequence, the evidence should be negative. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, "fact of consequence" is about something that affects the outcome. So, if the city's evidence is that the intersection was dangerous, that would be a negative fact. But the city attorney says the evidence is positive, which is the opposite.

Wait, no. The city's argument is that the intersection's history is the same for 14 years, which is a fact of consequence because it created a pattern of danger. So the city's evidence that it's dangerous is a negative fact of consequence, which would be proper under Rule 504(3) as a fact of consequence. So the city's evidence should be admissible.

Wait, but the city's attorney is presenting the 14-year history as positive evidence. But the court is evaluating whether that's proper. So the city would argue that the 14 years is a positive fact of consequence, which would make it improper. But wait, the court is probably concerned whether the evidence is admissible, regardless of its nature.

Wait, the key is that the city's argument is that the intersection was dangerous, so the 14 years is a negative fact of consequence. So if the city's evidence is that the intersection has been dangerous for 14 years, that would be a negative fact of consequence, which under Rule 504(3) is admissible only if it's a properly negative evidence of a fact of consequence. So the city's evidence should be admissible as a fact of consequence.

But wait, the options: Option A says it's improper negative evidence. Option B says it's admitted as relevant. Option C says it's admitted as critical for the jury. Option D is about unfair prejudice and confusion. Option E says it's admitted but only if the city can prove no significant changes in 14 years.

Wait, the city's attorney is bringing the evidence as part of a motion, so the issue is whether it's admissible. So, the city's argument is that the 14 years is a fact of consequence, which would be proper.

But wait, the injured driver's case is about negligence. So the city's argument is that the intersection was dangerous, leading to the accident. The injured driver's case, however, is a negligence claim. So the city's argument is admissible because the intersection was dangerous, which created a collision.

So the city's argument is that the intersection was dangerous, so the injured driver was at fault. So the city's evidence (the 14 years) is admissible as a fact of consequence.

Now, the options: option B says it's admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence. Option C says it's critical for the jury. Option A is about improper negative evidence. Wait, but if the city's argument is that the intersection is dangerous, that's a negative fact of consequence, which is proper. So the court would admit it as admissible.

But the question is whether the city's evidence should be admitted. The options are about what's excluded or admitted.

Another point: the city's evidence is of a fact of consequence, so it's admissible. So, the city's evidence is admissible as a fact of consequence. So the correct answer would be either B or C.

Wait, what's the difference between B and C? Option B: "admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence". Option C: "admitted as critical for the jury".

Well, the jury needs to understand the history of the intersection. So if the city's argument is that the intersection has been dangerous for 14 years, that would be relevant. So if the court accepts the city's evidence, the jury would know that the intersection was dangerous. So the evidence is critical.

Wait, but the city's evidence is of a fact of consequence, but does it need to be admissible as the only evidence? Or is it more relevant? But the question is about whether the evidence is admissible, not whether it's the only evidence.

So the issue is whether the evidence is admissible as a fact of consequence. Since the city's argument is that the intersection was dangerous (negative), and 14 years is a fact of consequence, then the evidence is admissible under Rule 504(3). So the court should admit it as admissible as a fact of consequence.

So the options are:

A: Excluded, because it's improper negative evidence. Wait, isn't a negative fact of consequence admissible?

B: Admitted as relevant, which could be correct because the 14 years is critical info for the jury.

C: Admitted as critical for the jury. So that's about the necessity of the evidence.

Wait, the question is whether the evidence is admissible. So the options are about what's excluded or admitted.

Option A says "improper negative evidence." I think that's incorrect, because Rule 504(3) allows for negative evidence of a fact of consequence if it's properly negative. So the city's evidence is a negative fact of consequence, which is proper. So option A is wrong.

Option B says it's admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence. That would be correct because the 14-year history is relevant.

Option C says it's admitted as critical for the jury. That's a bit more about the necessity of the evidence. But the court doesn't have to admit it as critical, but just as admissible as a fact of consequence.

Hmm, but the options are: which of the following should be admitted.

Since the city's argument is that the 14 years is a fact of consequence, and that the city's evidence is admissible, the correct answer would be B or C.

Wait, but another point: the city's attorney is bringing the 14-year history as evidence, and the injured driver's attorney is opposing. So the court is considering whether this evidence supports the case.

So the court would probably say it's admissible as a fact of consequence because it's a negative fact of consequence, and thus, the injured driver could be held responsible for the danger.

So the correct answer would be option B: admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence.

Wait, but another point: option C is that it's critical for the jury. So the court is concerned about the jury understanding the history. So if the city's evidence is 14 years, that's a fairly long time, which is a significant pattern. Thus, the jury would need to understand it. So the fact that the 14-year history is a fact of consequence is critical for the jury to understand the pattern of danger, making it critical evidence.

So the court should admit it as critical for the jury, which is option C.

Wait, but I thought that the court doesn't have to admit it as critical, but just as admissible. So the options are about whether it's relevant (B) or critical (C).

Alternatively, perhaps the fact that the 14-year history is a fact of consequence is admissible. So in the options, which one is correct.

Wait, the options are:

B: admitted as relevant fact of consequence.

C: admitted as critical for the jury.

What's the difference between B and C?

Option B is about the relevance; option C is about the necessity for the jury.

In criminal cases, the standard is that evidence of a fact of consequence must be admissible as relevant evidence. So if the court accepts the city's evidence, it's admissible as relevant.

But the issue is about whether the evidence is admissible as a fact of consequence.

So the correct standard is that if the evidence is a fact of consequence, and it's properly negative, it's admissible.

So the court should admit it as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence.

So option B is correct.

Wait, but the options are about what the evidence should be. Let me think again.

The city's evidence is that the intersection has been dangerous for 14 years, which is a negative fact of consequence. So it's admissible. That makes option B correct, but why is option C also correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the standard for the jury is that the necessity of the evidence. If the 14-year history is relevant and critical, then it's necessary for the jury to understand the pattern. So the court should admit it as critical.

So the options for the court are whether the evidence is relevant (B) or critical (C). 

Wait, the question is whether the evidence is admissible. So the court should admit it as relevant, but the fact that it's a proper negative fact of consequence is admissible regardless.

Hmm, perhaps the court should admit it as a fact of consequence because it's relevant for the case, and the fact that it's negative is proper.

So the correct answer is B: admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence.

Alternatively, the correct answer could be C for critical.

Wait, but what's the standard in criminal cases for the necessity of evidence. The court doesn't have to admit it as critical, but if it's admissible, then it's relevant.

So the court should admit it as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence, which is option B.

But I'm getting a bit confused between B and C.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B because the city's argument is about the intersection being dangerous, which is admissible as a fact of consequence. The fact that the 14 years is relevant for the jury, which is option B, but the question is whether the evidence should be admitted.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B, but I also need to consider whether the jury would need to understand that the intersection was dangerous, which is what the city's evidence is about. So the fact that the 14 years is a fact of consequence is critical for the jury to understand the pattern.

So the court should admit it as critical for the jury, which is option C.

Wait, but then again, the court only needs to admit it if it's admissible. So if the court accepts it as a fact of consequence, then the fact that it's a negative is proper, so it's admissible. But the fact that the jury needs to know about the 14 years is a necessity, but the standard is that the evidence is admissible, not that it's necessary.

So perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, another approach: looking for the correct reasoning.

Rule 504(3) states that negative evidence of a fact of consequence is admissible if it is properly negative. The proper negative is when the evidence is negative and directly affects the outcome.

In this case, the 14-year history is a fact of consequence because it affects the accident. So it's a negative fact of consequence. If the city's evidence is properly negative (i.e., stating that the intersection is dangerous), then it's admissible.

So the court should admit it as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence. So the correct answer is B.

But wait, the options also mention what the court should do. The options are:

B: admitted as relevant.

C: admitted as critical.

So, which is more correct? Let me think about the purpose of the jury. The 14-year history is a fact that the jury needs to understand to make an informed decision. So, the fact that it's a fact of consequence is necessary for the jury. Thus, this evidence is critical for the jury's understanding. So, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, but the court doesn't have to admit it as critical. The standard is that the evidence is admissible as a fact of consequence. If the court accepts it, then the jury would know about the dangerous intersection.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about which option is correct.

In conclusion, the correct answer is option B: admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence.

Wait, no, because the options are as follows: the question is whether the evidence should be admitted. So the city's argument is that the 14 years is a fact of consequence, which is necessary for the jury to understand the danger.

Wait, perhaps the court should admit it as critical for the jury because the 14-year history is the only evidence of its kind. So option C is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think of a different approach.

The city's claim is that the intersection was dangerous, which led to the accident. The injured driver's case is negligence, but the city is arguing that the intersection was dangerous, so the accident is due to the intersection's conditions, not their own actions.

Another point: the injured driver's case is a negligence claim, and the city's argument is that the intersection was dangerous, which didn't cause the accident. So the city's evidence is admissible to show that the accident was caused by the intersection's conditions, which led to the injuries.

The question is about whether the evidence is admissible. So the city's evidence is a fact of consequence (negative), and so under Rule 504(3), as a properly negative evidence, it's admissible.

Thus, the court should admit it as admissible as a fact of consequence. So the correct answer would be B: admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence.

But I think the correct choice is B because the evidence is relevant and admissible as a fact of consequence. Alternatively, option C is about criticality for the jury, which is a different standard.

But perhaps the correct answer is B because the court must admit it as relevant.

Wait, but the jury needs to understand that the intersection was dangerous, so the evidence is critical. So the court should admit it as critical.

Alternatively, the court doesn't have to admit it as critical, but it's required for the jury to understand it.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between B and C.

Wait, the question is whether the evidence is admissible. If the court accepts it as admissible, then the jury would know about the 14 years. So the necessity is more about whether the evidence is admissible, not whether it's necessary.

So, the court should admit the evidence as admissible as a fact of consequence. So option B is correct.

Wait, but the options in the problem are about whether the evidence is relevant or critical for the jury.

I think I'm getting the standard wrong. The rule about the necessity of evidence for the jury is a separate standard, but the admissibility of the evidence itself is based on being a fact of consequence.

So, the court should admit the evidence as relevant (so option B). The fact that it's a negative fact of consequence is proper, but the necessity is addressed by the court's own judgment, not the admissibility.

So, the correct answer is B.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence presented by the city's attorney at an intersection where no traffic lights, signs, or warnings were posted. The injured driver suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries, while the other driver's truck was slightly damaged. The injured driver sued the city for negligence, arguing that the city failed to provide adequate warning. The city attorney presents evidence that the intersection has been the same for 14 years, with no other accidents occurring during that time.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relevant and Admissible Evidence**: The city's evidence, which states that the intersection has been dangerous for 14 years, is a fact of consequence. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 504(3), a non-positive evidence of a fact of consequence is proper if it is "properly negative." The city's argument that the intersection is dangerous is admissible as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence.

2. **Criticality for the Jury**: While the necessity of the evidence for the jury is important, the court's standard for the admissibility of evidence of a fact of consequence is not about whether the evidence is critical for the jury. The jury needs to understand the history of the intersection, but the court does not have to admit the evidence as critical. The evidence is admissible as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence.

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A**: Incorrect. Improper negative evidence is not the standard for admissibility of evidence of a fact of consequence.
   - **B**: Correct. The evidence is relevant and admissible as a fact of consequence.
   - **C**: Incorrect. The necessity of the evidence for the jury is separate from the standard of admissibility.
   - **D**: Incorrect. Unrelated to the case at hand.
   - **E**: Incorrect. The requirement that the jury be instructed about the danger of inferential negative evidence is not relevant.
   - **F**: Incorrect. The city's argument is admissible as a fact of consequence.
   - **G**: Incorrect. The injured driver's case is a negligence claim, and the city's evidence does not directly affect that claim.

### Conclusion:
The city's evidence is admissible as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence because it is a properly negative evidence of a fact of consequence. The injured driver's case is a negligence claim, and the city's evidence does not directly affect that claim. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: B
