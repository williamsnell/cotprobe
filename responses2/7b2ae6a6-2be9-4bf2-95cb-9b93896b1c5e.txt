Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts. The first part says that a reaction proceeds five times as fast at 60°C as it does at 30°C. I need to estimate its energy of activation. The second part is about a gas reaction with a certain activation energy, and I have to estimate the change in the rate constant when the temperature changes from 1000°C to 2000°C. Then I have to pick the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that the rate of reaction depends on the Arrhenius equation. The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant k to the absolute temperature T. The equation is k = A * exp(-Ea/(R T)), where Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and A is the pre-exponential factor.

Wait, but for comparing rates at different temperatures, maybe the ratio of the rate constants can be used. Because the rate is proportional to k, right? So, if the reaction is five times faster at 60°C than at 30°C, then k1/k2 = 5. Since Ea is the same in both cases (assuming it's the same reaction), maybe I can use the Arrhenius equation for both temperatures and take the ratio.

Let me write down the equation for each temperature. Let's denote T1 as 30°C and T2 as 60°C. Wait, but wait a second, temperatures should be in Kelvin because the Arrhenius equation uses absolute temperatures. So converting 30°C to Kelvin is 303 K, and 60°C is 333 K.

So, k1 = A exp(-Ea/(R T1)) and k2 = A exp(-Ea/(R T2)). Taking the ratio, k1/k2 = exp( (Ea/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ). Because when you divide, the A's cancel.

So, the ratio is 5 = exp( Ea/(R) (1/333 - 1/303) ). Let me compute the term in the exponent.

Compute 1/333 minus 1/303. Let me calculate that. 1/333 is approximately 0.003003, and 1/303 is about 0.0033008. Subtracting them gives 0.003003 - 0.0033008 = -0.0002975. Wait, wait, no, wait: 1/303 is smaller than 1/333, so 1/303 is 0.0033008 and 1/333 is 0.003003. So, 1/303 - 1/333 = (333 - 303)/(303*333) ) = 30/(303*333). Let me compute that.

Wait, 303 * 333 is 303 * 300=90900, plus 303*33=9999. So 90900 + 9999= 100,899.

So 30/(100899) ≈ approximately 0.0002975.

So the term inside the exponential is Ea/(R) multiplied by (0.0002975).

Wait, but wait, the ratio is 5 = exp( Ea/(R) * [ (1/303) - (1/333) ] ) = exp( Ea/(R) * (0.003003 - 0.0033008) ) = exp( Ea/(R) * ( -0.0002975 ) )

So 5 = exp( -Ea/(R) * 0.0002975 )

Taking natural logs on both sides: ln(5) = -Ea/(R) * 0.0002975.

R is the gas constant. Wait, which units? Because Ea is in cal per mole, but R is usually in J/(mol·K) or cal/(mol·K). Let me think. The problem uses cal in part (2), but part (1) is in k cal per mole? Wait, no, in part (1) it's 12 k cal per mole. Actually, part (1) is in k cal per mole, but part (2) is in cal per mole.

Wait, let me clarify. Part (1) gives the rate as 5 times, and the Ea is in k cal per mole. Oh, wait no, the first question is in 1) a reaction is five times as fast at 60°C (so temp is 333 K) compared to 30°C (303 K), and the Ea is to be found. The second part is a gas reaction with Ea=40,000 cal/mole, so in k cal per mole it's 40 k cal? Because 40,000 cal is 40 k cal.

But wait, for part (1), the answer is in k cal per mole, so the Ea is in k cal per mole. So the R in the equation must be in cal/(mol·K), but the Ea is in k cal/mol. So I need to adjust.

Wait, yes. Let me think: R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) or 0.008314 kJ/(mol·K). But if Ea is in k cal/mol, I need to convert R to cal/(mol·K) for consistency.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K. 1 J = 0.001 kJ, but 1 kJ = 239 cal. So 8.314 J = 8.314 * (239 cal/kJ) * (1 kJ/1000 J) ) = 8.314 * 0.239 ≈ 1.98 cal/mol·K.

Alternatively, I can keep R as 8.314 J/mol·K, but then Ea needs to be in J/mol or k cal/mol.

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed with R as 8.314 J/mol·K, but Ea will come out in J/mol, which I can then convert to k cal/mol.

So, let me proceed step by step.

So, Ea is in k cal/mol, so Ea = Ea_kcal * 1000 cal/kcal.

Ea in J/mol is Ea_J = Ea_kcal * 1000.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

The equation:

ln(5) = (Ea / R) * (1/303 K - 1/333 K )

Wait, no, the ratio is k1/k2 = 5 = exp( (Ea/R) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, yes, because 1/T2 is 1/333 K, and 1/T1 is 1/303 K. So 1/303 - 1/333 is positive, because 303 is less than 333, so 1/303 is bigger. So 1/303 - 1/333 = (333 -303)/(303*333) ) = 30/(303*333) ≈ 0.0002975 K⁻¹.

So, ln(5) = (Ea / R) * (0.0002975) )

So, Ea = (ln(5) * R ) / (0.0002975 )

Wait, ln(5) is about 1.6094.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So, Ea = (1.6094 * 8.314) / 0.0002975

Calculate numerator: 1.6094 *8.314 ≈ approximately 13.35 J/mol.

So, Ea ≈ 13.35 J/mol.

But wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1.6094 * 8.314 = let me calculate.

1.6 *8=12.8, 1.6*0.314=0.5024, 0.0094*8=0.0752, 0.0094*0.314≈0.00295.

Adding them up:

12.8 + 0.5024 = 13.3024; plus 0.0752=13.3776; plus 0.00295=13.38055 J/mol.

So Ea is approximately 13.38 J/mol.

But since Ea is in k cal/mol, I need to convert this. 1 k cal is 4184 J. So 1 J is 1/4184 k cal. So, Ea_kcal = 13.38 J/mol / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 0.003187 k cal/mol.

Wait, that's about 0.003187 k cal/mol. Hmm, that seems really low. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the math.

Wait, let's think again. Wait, no, I think I messed up the part where I converted J to k cal. So because 1 k cal is 4184 J. So, to convert J to k cal, you divide by 4184.

So, 13.38 J/mol is 13.38 / 4184 ≈ 0.003187 k cal/mol. But this seems way too low. Because if the activation energy is like about 3 k cal/mol, that's a very small Ea, which makes sense for some reactions, but is that consistent with the given data?

Wait, but let me think about the calculation again. Perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the equation is k1/k2 = exp( (Ea/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, yes, correct. But let me make sure about the units.

Wait, perhaps I should use R in k cal/(mol·K). Because part (2) uses cal, but part (1) is in k cal.

So, R in cal/(mol·K) is 1.987 cal/(mol·K). Wait, where does that number come from? Let me think: R is approximately 8.314 J/mol·K, and 1 J = 0.000239 kcal. Wait, no, 1 kJ is 0.239 kcal. Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct value of R in cal/(mol·K).

Wait, I think R is 8.314 J/mol·K, and 1 cal is 4.184 J. So, 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 / 4.184 ≈ 2. So, 2 cal/(mol·K). Wait, no, perhaps 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 8.314 J = 8.314 /4.184 ≈ 2. So, R is approximately 2 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, but I think it's more precise to say R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 / 4.184 ≈ 2 cal/(mol·K). So, 2 cal/(mol·K) is the value of R.

So, let's redo the calculation using R in cal/(mol·K).

So, R = 2 cal/(mol·K).

So, back to the equation:

ln(5) = (Ea / R) * (1/303 - 1/333) 

Wait, no, 1/T2 is 1/333, 1/T1 is 1/303, so 1/303 - 1/333 = (333 -303)/(303 * 333) )= 30/(303*333) = 30/(100,899) ≈ 0.0002975 K^-1.

So, ln(5) = (Ea / 2) * (0.0002975) )

So, Ea = (ln(5) * 2) / 0.0002975

Compute numerator: ln(5)=1.6094. 1.6094 *2=3.2188.

Denominator: 0.0002975.

So, Ea = 3.2188 / 0.0002975 ≈ approximately 10820 cal/mol.

Wait, that's a lot higher than before. Because with R as 2 cal/(mol·K), this becomes much bigger.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but converted to cal/(mol·K), it's 2 cal/(mol·K). So, 2 cal/(mol·K) is R.

So, let me compute again:

Ea = (ln(5) * R) / (1/303 - 1/333 )

Wait, wait, the term (1/303 - 1/333) is positive because 1/303 is larger than 1/333. So, 303 is larger.

Wait, let me compute 1/303 and 1/333.

1/303 ≈ 0.00330033 K⁻¹.

1/333 ≈ 0.00300300 K⁻¹.

So, their difference is 0.00029733 K⁻¹.

So, the equation is ln(5) = (Ea/(2)) * 0.00029733.

So, 1.6094 = (Ea/(2)) * 0.00029733

Multiply both sides by 2: 3.2188 = Ea * 0.00029733.

So, Ea = 3.2188 / 0.00029733 ≈ Let me compute that.

3.2188 / 0.00029733 ≈ 3.2188 / 0.0003 ≈ approximately 10,729. But precise calculation: 0.00029733 is 2.9733e-4.

So, 3.2188 / 2.9733e-4 ≈ (3.2188 / 2.9733 ) * 1e4.

3.2188 / 2.9733 ≈ approximately 1.083.

So, 1.083 * 1e4 = 10,830 cal/mol.

Wait, that's about 10,830 cal/mol. Which is 10.83 k cal/mol. Because 10,830 cal is 10.83 k cal.

So, the activation energy Ea is approximately 10.83 k cal/mol.

Looking at the options, let's see which option has Ea around 10.8 k cal/mol.

Option B is 10.8 k cal/mol, 950 times.

Option F is 10.2 k cal/mol, 3000 times.

Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 12.0 k cal, 950

B:10.8, 950

C:9.7,2000

D:12.5,500

E:11.2,1500

F:10.2,3000

G:9.1, 1800

H:13.3,750

I:14.1,1250

J:8.6,2500

So, the correct Ea is approximately 10.8 k cal/mol, which is option B.

Now, part (2): The reaction has Ea=40,000 cal/mole. We are to find the change in the rate constant when the temperature increases from 1000°C to 2000°C.

Wait, first, I need to make sure about the units again. 40,000 cal is 40 k cal. Then, Ea is 40 k cal per mole. Wait, but the problem says the rate constant changes, so we need to find the ratio of the rate constants.

The Arrhenius equation: k = A exp(-Ea/(R T)).

So, the ratio k2/k1 is exp( (Ea/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, because k2 = A exp( -Ea/(R T2) ), and k1 = A exp( - Ea/(R T1) ).

So, k2/k1 = exp( [ -Ea/(R T2) + Ea/(R T1) ] )

= exp( Ea/(R) ( 1/T1 -1/T2 ) )

So, let me compute the term (1/T1 -1/T2) when T1 is 1000°C and T2 is 2000°C.

First, convert to Kelvin: 1000°C = 1000 + 273.15=1273.15 K.

2000°C = 2000 + 273.15=2273.15 K.

So, 1/T1=1/1273.15≈0.0007853 K⁻¹.

1/T2=1/2273.15≈0.0004404 K⁻¹.

So, 1/T1 -1/T2= 0.0007853 -0.0004404 = 0.0003449 K⁻¹.

So, the term is 0.0003449.

So, (Ea/R) * (term) = (40,000 cal/mol / R) * 0.0003449 K⁻¹.

Wait, but R is in cal/(mol·K), because 40,000 is in cal per mole. So, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 cal/(mol·K). So, R is 8.314 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, no, wait: 1 cal = 4.184 J. So, R in cal/(mol·K) is 8.314 /4.184 ≈ 2. So, I think earlier, I considered R as 2 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, but let me get exact numbers. 8.314 J/(mol·K) is 8.314 /4.184 cal/(mol·K) ≈ 2. So, R is approximately 2 cal/(mol·K).

So, Ea is 40,000 cal/mol.

So, (Ea/R ) is (40,000) / (2 ) = 20,000 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, no, because R is in cal/(mol·K), so 40,000 / R is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 cal/(mol·K) * K → cal/mol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me think again:

Ea is in cal/mol; R is in cal/(mol·K). So, Ea/R is (cal/mol)/(cal/(mol·K)) )= K.

So, the term (Ea/R) * (1/T1 -1/T2) is K * K⁻¹ = dimensionless.

So, okay, the term is 0.0003449 K⁻¹.

So, (Ea/R) * (0.0003449) )= (40,000 / 2 ) * 0.0003449 = 20,000 * 0.0003449 = 6.898 k.

So, the exponent is 6.898.

So, k2/k1 = exp(6.898) ≈ e^6.898.

Compute e^6.898:

We know that e^7 ≈ 1096, so e^6.898 ≈ e^(7 - 0.102) ≈ e^7 * e^(-0.102) ≈ 1096 * 0.904 ≈ 990.

Wait, perhaps better to compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, using calculator approximation.

Wait, e^6.898 is approximately 997. Let's say it's approximately 1000.

So, the rate constant increases by a factor of about 1000.

But the options given in part (2) are:

A: 10.8 k cal, 950 times.

Wait, the options are:

A: Ea=12.0 k cal, rate change 950 times.

B: Ea=10.8 k cal, rate change 950 times.

C: Ea=9.7 k cal, rate change 1800 times.

Wait, no, looking at the options again.

Wait, let me recheck the options provided.

The question says:

Part (2): For reaction A, Ea =40,000 cal/mole. How much is the rate change when temp increases from 1000°C to 2000°C?

So, the options are:

A: Ea=12.0 k cal, change is 950 times.

B: Ea=10.8 k cal, change is 950 times.

C: Ea=9.7, 1800.

So, I think I have to compute the rate change factor as (k2/k1) = exp( (Ea/R) (1/T1 -1/T2) )

Which is approximately exp(6.898) ≈ 997. So, the rate increases by about 997 times.

So, the change is approximately 1000 times.

Now, what's the option that has a change of about 1000 times? Looking at the options, it's option B, which has Ea=10.8 k cal, and change 950 times. Wait, no, option B says Ea=10.8 k cal, and change 950 times. Wait, if the change is 997, it's close to 1000, which would make option B incorrect because 10.8 is the Ea but the change is 950, not 1000.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute (Ea/R)*(1/T1 -1/T2).

Ea is 40,000 cal/mol.

R is 2 cal/(mol·K).

So, (Ea/R) =40,000 /2 =20,000 K.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because R is 2 cal/(mol·K), so Ea is 40,000 cal/mol. So, (Ea/R) = (40,000 cal/mol) / (2 cal/(mol·K)) )= (40,000 /2 ) ( (mol·K)/ (mol·K) ) )= 20,000 K⁻¹.

Wait, no, no, no. Let me think in terms of units.

Ea is in cal/mol.

R is in cal/(mol·K).

So, Ea/R is (cal/mol) / (cal/(mol·K)) )= K.

So, (Ea/R) is K.

So, (1/T1 -1/T2) is 1/K.

So, (Ea/R) * (1/T1 -1/T2) is K * K⁻¹ = dimensionless.

So, the exponent is dimensionless, which is correct.

So, (Ea/R) * (1/T1 -1/T2) )= (40,000 /2 ) * (0.0003449) ) = 20,000 * 0.0003449 = 6.898.

So, exp(6.898) ≈ 997.

So, the rate increases by about 997 times, which is roughly 1000 times.

Looking at the options, option B has Ea=10.8 k cal, but the change is 950 times, which is less than 1000.

Option A has Ea=12.0 k cal and change 950 times. No.

Option C: Ea=9.7 k cal, change 1800 times. No, change is 1800, but Ea is less.

Option D: Ea=12.5, change 500. No.

Option E: Ea=11.2, change 1500. No.

Option F: Ea=10.2, change 3000. No.

Option G: Ea=9.1, change 1800. No.

Option H: Ea=13.3, change 750. No.

Option I: Ea=14.1, change 1250. No.

Option J: Ea=8.6, change 2500. No.

Wait, none of the options have a change of 997 times. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the units for R are different.

Wait, wait a moment. I think I made a mistake in the value of R. Because when R is in cal/(mol·K), it's approximately 2 cal/(mol·K). But in some cases, when R is given in J/(mol·K), it's 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 /4.184 ≈ 2 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, but in reality, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 cal/(mol·K) × (1 cal = 4.184 J) → R = (8.314 × 4.184) cal/(mol·K) ≈ 35.0 cal/(mol·K). Wait, that's not possible. Because 1 cal is 4.184 J, so 1 cal/(mol·K) is 4.184 J/(mol·K). So, 1 cal/(mol·K) = 4.184 J/(mol·K). So, 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 /4.184 ≈ 1.993 cal/(mol·K). So, R ≈ 2 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, but that can't be right. Because 1 cal is 4.184 J, so 1 cal/(mol·K) =4.184 J/(mol·K). So, 1 cal/(mol·K) =4.184 J/(mol·K) = (4.184 /8.314) cal/(mol·K) ≈ 0.503 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, so 1 cal/(mol·K) = 0.503 cal/(mol·K). So, 8.314 J/(mol·K) =8.314 /4.184 ≈ 1.993 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should use R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 cal/(mol·K) × (1 cal = 4.184 J) → R =8.314 ×4.184 cal/(mol·K) = 35.0 cal/(mol·K). Wait, that's impossible because that's higher than 1 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, no, wait. 1 cal =4.184 J, so 1 cal/(mol·K) =4.184 J/(mol·K). So, R=8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 /4.184 cal/(mol·K) ≈ 2. So, R≈2 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, but let me think again. Let me check exact value.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). So, in cal/(mol·K), R is 8.314 /4.184 ≈ 1.993 ≈ 2. So, R≈2.

So, my previous calculation is correct. So, (Ea/R) is 20,000 K.

Wait, but no, wait. R is in cal/(mol·K), so 1 R =1 cal/(mol·K) =4.184 J/(mol·K).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me clarify:

If R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), then to convert to cal/(mol·K), we divide by 4.184.

So, R_cal = R_J /4.184 =8.314 /4.184 ≈2. So, R_cal=2 cal/(mol·K).

So, Ea in cal/mol is 40,000 cal/mol.

So, (Ea/R) =40,000 cal/mol / 2 cal/(mol·K) )=20,000 K⁻¹.

And (1/T1 -1/T2) is 0.0003449 K⁻¹.

So, (Ea/R)*(1/T1 -1/T2) )=20,000 *0.0003449 ≈6.898.

So, exp(6.898)≈997.

So, the rate increases by about 997 times.

Looking at the options, which option has the Ea as 10.2 k cal and a change of 3000 times?

Wait, no, the options are:

A: Ea=12.0, change 950.

B: Ea=10.8, change 950.

C: Ea=9.7, change 1800.

Wait, none of the options have a change of about 1000 times. The closest is option B, which has Ea=10.8 k cal and a change of 950 times. But the change is 950, not 1000.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exponent as (Ea/R) * (1/T1 -1/T2) in units where R is in cal/(mol·K), and (1/T1 -1/T2) is in 1/K.

So, Ea=40,000 cal/mol.

R=2 cal/(mol·K).

So, (Ea/R) =40,000 /2 =20,000 K.

(1/T1 -1/T2)=0.0003449 K.

So, (Ea/R) * (1/T1 -1/T2)=20,000 *0.0003449=6.898.

So, exp(6.898)=997.

Hmm. So, the change is 997 times.

But none of the options have this change. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the Ea is 40,000 cal/mole, but that's not right. The question says, "for reaction A, Ea=40,000 cal/mole."

Wait, but that's a typo. Because Ea is in cal/mol, so 40,000 cal/mole would make it impossible. Because 1 cal/mol is 4.184 J/mol, so 40,000 cal/mol is 40,000 *4.184 J/mol=167,360 J/mol.

Wait, that's not correct. So, perhaps the question meant to say Ea=40,000 cal/(mol·K), but that's not what it says.

Wait, the question says for reaction A, Ea=40,000 cal/mole. But that's impossible because cal/mol is not the same as cal/(mol·K).

Wait, perhaps the question meant to say Ea=40,000 cal/(mol·K), but it's written as cal/mole.

Wait, perhaps I should think of Ea=40,000 cal/(mol·K). Because then, the units make sense.

Wait, but the question says, "for reaction A, Ea=40,000 cal/mole."

Hmm.

Well, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed, even though the options do not match. But given that, perhaps I should choose the closest option.

Wait, the calculated change is approximately 997 times, which is about 1000 times. The closest option is B, which has Ea=10.8 k cal and a change of 950 times. So, perhaps the answer is B.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can compute the ratio using the Arrhenius equation's ratio.

Wait, the ratio k2/k1 is exp( (Ea/R) (1/T1 -1/T2) )

Which is exp( (Ea/R) ( (1/T1) - (1/T2) ) )

So, let me compute 1/T1 -1/T2.

1/T1 =1/(1273.15)=approximately 0.0007868 K⁻¹.

1/T2=1/(2273.15)=approximately 0.0004404 K⁻¹.

So, 1/T1 -1/T2=0.0007868 -0.0004404=0.0003464 K⁻¹.

So, (Ea/R) =40,000 /2=20,000.

So, (Ea/R)*(1/T1 -1/T2)=20,000 *0.0003464=6.928.

So, exp(6.928)= approx 1025.

So, the change is approximately 1025 times.

Looking at the options, none match. So, perhaps the intended approach is to take R=8.314 J/(mol·K).

So, let's recalculate.

Ea=40,000 cal/mol.

R=8.314 J/(mol·K).

But wait, to convert cal to J, we multiply by 4.184.

So, Ea in J/mol is 40,000 *4.184=167,360 J/mol.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

So, (Ea/R) =167,360 /8.314 ≈20,000 K.

(1/T1 -1/T2)=0.0003464 K⁻¹.

So, (Ea/R)*(1/T1 -1/T2)=20,000 *0.0003464=6.928.

Exp(6.928)= approx 1025.

So, the change is 1025 times.

Looking at the options again, the closest is option B, which has Ea=10.8 k cal and a change of 950 times. But none of the options have a change of 1025 times.

Wait, but option B is Ea=10.8 k cal and change 950 times. So, perhaps the intended answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option B, given that it's the closest to 1000.

Wait, but I'm getting 997 times, which is close to 1000, but none of the options have 1000.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question intended Ea=40,000 cal/(mol·K), but the question wrote it as cal/mole.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation when I computed (Ea/R)*(1/T1 -1/T2).

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using a calculator.

Wait, maybe I should compute it again.

(Ea/R)=40,000 /2=20,000.

(1/T1 -1/T2)=0.0003464.

Multiply them:20,000 *0.0003464=6.928.

Exp(6.928)=approx 1025.

Hmm.

Well, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the options, the closest is option B.

Wait, but the computed change is 997 times, which is close to 1000. So, perhaps option B is the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exponent as (Ea/R) * (1/T1 -1/T2).

Which is (40,000 cal/mol) / (2 cal/(mol·K)) ) * ( (1 K) (1/1273.15 K) - (1 K) (1/2273.15 K) )).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute this correctly.

(Ea/R) is in K⁻¹.

(1/T1 -1/T2) is in K⁻¹.

So, (Ea/R) * (1/T1 -1/T2) is unitless; it's a dimensionless number.

So, the exponent is (Ea/(R)) * (1/T1 -1/T2).

Which is 20,000 *0.0003464=6.928.

So, exp(6.928)= 1025.

So, the ratio is 1025.

So, the rate increases by 1025 times.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. So, the closest is option B (950 times), and option A (950 times). So, perhaps the intended answer is B.

Wait, but the change is 1025 times, which is not any of the options. So, perhaps the intended answer is option B, as the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exponent as (Ea/R) * (1/T1 -1/T2) in terms of natural logarithm.

So, let me compute ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) (1/T1 -1/T2).

Which is (40,000 /2) * (0.0003464) =20,000 *0.0003464=6.928.

So, ln(k2/k1)=6.928.

So, k2/k1 = e^6.928=1025.

So, the ratio is 1025.

But none of the options have this.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio using the Arrhenius equation's ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ratio using the formula:

k = A * exp( -Ea/(R T) )

So, the ratio k2/k1= [A2 exp( -Ea/(R T2) ) ] / [A1 exp( -Ea/(R T1) ) ]

= A2/A1 * exp( Ea/(R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Assuming A1 and A2 are the pre-exponential factors, which are the same for all reactions, so A2/A1=1.

So, k2/k1= exp( Ea/(R) (1/T1 -1/T2) )

Which is what I did earlier.

So, the same calculation.

So, the same 1025 ratio.

Hmm.

Well, perhaps I should proceed to select option B, as the closest, even though the exact calculation is 1025.

Wait, but the options provided don't include 1000, so perhaps I should look for the closest option.

So, given that, the answer would be option B: Ea=10.8 k cal, change 950 times. But I think the correct change is 1025 times, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option B, as the closest.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is option B, but with a change of 950 times, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that the Ea is 40,000 cal/(mol·K), but that's not what the question says.

Hmm.

I think I'll proceed to select option B as the answer, but I'm not entirely confident.

The reaction involves calculating the rate constant ratio using the Arrhenius equation. Here's the analysis:

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
The problem involves two reactions with different activation energies (Ea). The goal is to calculate the rate constant ratio (k2/k1) for each reaction and determine the change in rate.

### Step 2: Calculating the Rate Constant Ratio
The rate constant ratio is given by:

\[
\ln(k_2/k_1) = \frac{E_a}{R} \left( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \right)
\]

Where:
- \(E_a\) is the activation energy (cal/mol).
- \(R\) is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).
- \(T\) is the temperature in K.
- \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) are the temperatures for the two reactions.

### Step 3: Plugging in the Values
For Reaction 1 (\(k_1\)):
- \(E_a = 40,000 \, \text{cal/mol}\).
- \(R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}\).
- \(T_1 = 1273.15 \, \text{K}\) (298 K Celsius converted to Kelvin).
- \(T_2 = 2273.15 \, \text{K}\) (298 K Celsius converted to Kelvin).

For Reaction 2 (\(k_2\)):
- \(E_a = 40,000 \, \text{cal/mol}\).
- \(R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}\).
- \(T_1 = 1273.15 \, \text{K}\).
- \(T_2 = 2273.15 \, \text{K}\).

### Step 4: Calculating the Terms
1. \(E_a/R = 40,000 / 8.314 ≈ 4815 \, \text{K}\).
2. \(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} ≈ 0.0007868 - 0.0004404 = 0.0003464 \, \text{K}^{-1}\).

3. Multiplying these terms:
\[
\frac{E_a}{R} \left( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \right) ≈ 4815 \times 0.0003464 ≈ 1.683 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 5: Calculating the Exponential
\[
\ln(k_2/k_1) ≈ 1.683 \implies k_2/k_1 = e^{1.683} ≈ 5.36
\]

### Step 6: Determining the Rate Constant Ratio
The rate constant ratio \(k_2/k_1 ≈ 5.36\).

### Step 7: Calculating the Rate Constant
The rate constant \(k\) is given by:
\[
k = A \cdot e^{-E_a/(R T)}
\]
Assuming the pre-exponential factors (\(A\)) are the same for both reactions, the ratio simplifies to:
\[
k_2/k_1 = e^{(E_a/R)(1/T_1 - 1/T_2)}
\]
As calculated earlier, \(k_2/k_1 ≈ 5.36\).

### Step 8: Calculating the Rate Constant Ratio for Reaction 2
For Reaction 2:
\[
\ln(k_2/k_1) = \frac{40,000}{8.314} \left( \frac{1}{1273.15} - \frac{1}{2273.15} \right) ≈ 4815 \times 0.0003464 ≈ 1.683 \, \text{K}
\]
\[
k_2/k_1 = e^{1.683} ≈ 5.36
\]

### Step 9: Comparing the Ratios
The rate constant ratio for Reaction 2 is approximately 5.36 times that of Reaction 1.

### Step 10: Calculating the Change in Rate
The change in rate is typically expressed as the ratio of the rate constants. Here, Reaction 2 has a rate constant approximately 5.36 times that of Reaction 1.

### Step 11: Selecting the Closest Option
Looking at the options provided:
- Option A: Ea=12.0 k cal, change 950 times.
- Option B: Ea=10.8 k cal, change 950 times.
- Option C: Ea=9.7 k cal, change 1800 times.
- Option D: Ea=2.5 k cal, change 3000 times.

The calculated change in rate is approximately 5.36 times, which is closest to Option B (change 950 times). However, this is not an exact match, and the closest option is Option B.

ANSWER: B
