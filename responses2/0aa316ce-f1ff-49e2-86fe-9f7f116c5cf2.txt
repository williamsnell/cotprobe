Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question to answer about control systems and their components. Let me try to break it down.

The question is asking: "A box which tells the effect of inputs on the control subsystem is known as..." and then it gives several options. Hmm. I remember that control systems have various boxes used in different contexts.

So, I think I need to recall each component of a control system. The basic ones I remember are the input box, a processing box, an output box, a state box, and maybe a decision box. The control subsystems often involve these components arranged in a certain order.

Wait, let me think about each option. The options are Process box (A), State box (B), Input box (C), System box (D), Data Box (E), Control box (F), Output box (G), Decision box (H), Effect box (I), and Logical box (J).

I remember that in control systems, the input is typically handled by a 'Box' that receives the input signals. Then, the processing occurs in a 'Box', maybe a processing box. But the question is about the box that tells the effect of inputs on the control system. Oh wait, that would be the output box, right? Because the output box would display the results after processing.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the control subsystem's output is what's used as input to the next stage, like a regulator. So, the output box would show the effect of the inputs. Alternatively, the effect of the inputs on the output is what the output box shows. So the effect box (Option I) would be the box that tells what happens after the inputs, i.e., the output.

But wait, I might be mixing up the terms. Let me think again. The input is processed through a processing box, but the effect of the input on the output is what the output box shows. So, the output box is the one that represents the effect of the inputs on the system's output.

Alternatively, sometimes there's the 'Effect box' or 'Output box.' Or perhaps it's called the 'Output box.' Wait, I think I've heard the term 'Output box' before. For example, in control systems, the output of a controller is often displayed in an output box. So if the question is about the box that tells the effect of the inputs, that's the output.

Looking at the options, Output box is option G. So I think the correct answer is G.

The correct answer is **G: Output box**. The output box represents the effect of inputs on the control subsystem's output. 

Answer: G
