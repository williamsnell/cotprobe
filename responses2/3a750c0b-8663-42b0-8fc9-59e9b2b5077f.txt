Okay, so I've got this question about the mean translational kinetic energy of a gas molecule. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it. 

Wait, the question is asking for the mean translational kinetic energy in electron volts. I remember that the average translational kinetic energy is related to temperature somehow. Oh right! The equipartition theorem states that each degree of freedom contributes (1/2)kT to the average energy. For a monatomic gas, there are three translational degrees of freedom (x, y, z), so each contributes (1/2)kT. So the total translational kinetic energy would be (3/2)kT.

But wait, wait. I think I might be mixing up the translational and rotational kinetic energies. Oh, right, for translational, it's (3/2)kT. For rotational, it adds (2/2)kT, so 5/2 for diatomic, etc. So yeah, the translational energy is (3/2)kT.

Now, I need to convert this into electron volts. I remember that 1 eV is the energy gained by an electron accelerated through 1 volt. And I also know that 1 eV is approximately 1.602 × 10^-19 joules. 

So, I need to find k, the Boltzmann constant, in units that when multiplied by T (in Kelvin) will give me energy in joules. Oh wait, the Boltzmann constant is about 1.38 × 10^-23 J/K. So the formula I'll use is E = (3/2) * k * T.

But wait, what's the temperature being referred to? The question doesn't specify. Oh, wait, no, maybe I'm supposed to assume a standard temperature, like room temperature? I think room temperature is around 300 K. Let me check if that makes sense.

So substituting the numbers: E = (3/2) * (1.38e-23 J/K) * 300 K. Let me compute that. 3/2 is 1.5. 1.5 * 1.38e-23 is 2.07e-23. Multiply by 300 gives 6.21e-21 J.

Wait, but the question is in eV. So I need to convert 6.21e-21 J to eV. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, I divide 6.21e-21 by 1.602e-19. Let's see: 6.21e-21 / 1.602e-19 = approximately 0.0388 eV.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.038 and E is 1.20. Hmm, 0.038 is close to that. So maybe the correct answer is option D.

Wait, wait—did I make a mistake with the calculation? Let me double-check. 3/2 * 1.38e-23 * 300 is indeed (3/2)* (1.38 * 300 )e-23. 1.38 *300=414, so 3/2 * 414e-23= 621e-23, which is 6.21e-21 J. Right. 

Then 6.21e-21 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV equals approximately 0.0388 eV. So about 0.039 eV, which is option D. So the answer should be D.

To compute the mean translational kinetic energy of a single ideal gas molecule, we use the formula:

\[
E = \frac{3}{2} k T
\]

where \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), and \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin. Assuming room temperature (\( T = 300 \, \text{K} \)), the calculation proceeds as follows:

1. Substitute the values into the formula:
   \[
   E = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \cdot 300 \, \text{K}
   \]
   \[
   E = 1.5 \cdot 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \cdot 300 = 6.21 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. Convert the energy from joules to electron volts (eV) using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):
   \[
   E = \frac{6.21 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}}
   \]
   \[
   E \approx 0.0388 \, \text{eV}
   \]

3. Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest match is option D (\( 0.038 \, \text{eV} \)).
