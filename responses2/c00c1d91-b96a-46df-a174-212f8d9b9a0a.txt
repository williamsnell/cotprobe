Question:

During assigned seat-work time, Mary, a firstgrade student, sometimes leaves her seat and attempts to play with a block collection. When she leaves her seat, she fails to complete her seat work. Which of the following behavioral intervention strategies will most effectively increase the long-term likelihood that Mary will complete her seat work?

Options:

A: Instituting a class-wide reward system for staying in seats during work time
B: Giving Mary additional seat work as a consequence for leaving her seat
C: Having a one-on-one talk with Mary about the importance of discipline in class
D: Allowing Mary to read from a teacherselected book for a specific period of time before beginning her seat work
E: Removing the blocks from the classroom during the assigned seat-work time
F: Assigning a classmate to monitor Mary's behavior during seat-work time
G: Allowing Mary to play with the blocks afterward if she remains in her seat throughout the assigned seat-work time
H: Explaining to Mary the value of completing seat work in terms of the objectives of the lesson
I: Allowing Mary to play with the blocks while doing her seat work
J: Ignoring Mary when she leaves her seat to play with the blocks

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about behavioral interventions for seat-work time. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, the question is about Mary, a first-grade student, who sometimes leaves her seat and tries to play with blocks. She can't complete her seat work, and the question is asking which intervention would most effectively help her in the long term.

Looking at the options, I need to evaluate each one to see which strategy is best for increasing her completion.

Option A: Involving a reward system for staying in seats. This seems like a good idea because positive reinforcement can motivate students to do what's right. But I'm not sure how effective that would be immediately versus long-term.

Option B: Giving Mary additional seat work as a consequence for leaving. Wait, if leaving causes more work, that might make things worse. It could lead to more frustration and encourage her to leave again. So probably not the best option.

Option C: One-on-one talk about discipline. This is more about addressing the root cause, which is discipline. If the teacher is teaching the importance of discipline, maybe students will take it more seriously. But I'm not sure if it's the most direct solution.

Option D: Allowing Mary to read before seat work. This seems like it might reduce the need for sitting, but does it directly help with seat work? Maybe if she's more engaged because she's reading, but I'm not sure if that's the cause of her messing up seat work.

Option E: Removing blocks during seat time. If she's sitting and can't use blocks, maybe she's less likely to play with them. But this could also affect her seat work if she's not using blocks. It might not directly solve the issue.

Option F: Assigning a classmate to watch her. If the classmate notices she's not sitting, maybe she'll be more professional, leading to better behavior. That could help her stay on track.

Option G: Allowing Mary to play with blocks afterward. If she's sitting but not using them, maybe she'll play with them. This could help her stay engaged. But I'm not sure if it's a long-term solution.

Option H: Explaining the value of seat work. If the teacher explains why it's important, maybe she'll see the benefit and stick to it. This could motivate her to complete her work.

Option I: Allowing block play while doing seat work. If she's sitting, maybe she'll play with the blocks, thus completing her work. This seems like a positive approach because it uses a resource she's using, which might encourage her to do it.

Option J: Ignoring her. This is bad because it hurts her self-esteem and makes her more upset. It's not a solution.

Now, thinking about the long-term effect: the best strategies should encourage her to complete seat work without causing more problems. 

Option I encourages block play while she's sitting, which could make her more engaged and less likely to leave. It's a proactive approach that uses a tool she's already using, which might help her stay focused.

Option H is about explaining the importance, which could motivate her, but it's more about the motivation rather than the action. So maybe the best is to provide her with a resource she's using, which would make it more attractive.

So, between I and H, I think I is better because it's about giving her a reason to complete her work, which can lead to better behavior. But maybe I isn't the best. Alternatively, option F is monitoring, which could help her stay focused during seat work.

Wait, another thought: if Mary is sitting, but not using blocks, perhaps she's more likely to play with them. So option G might help. But is that the best approach for long-term completion?

Alternatively, if she's playing with blocks, she might not be trying to leave her seat, so maybe she'll sit more. So option I could be effective.

Wait, the question is about seat work time. So if she's sitting, she's probably not using blocks. So allowing block play while she's sitting might mean she's using blocks throughout, which could encourage her to complete them. So option I is about allowing block play while she's doing seat work. That might mean she's more engaged and not leaving her seat because she's playing with blocks.

Comparing that to option H, which is explaining the value, that's about why she should complete it. But if she's avoiding the activity because she's playing, then option I might be more effective.

So the best options are I and F.

Wait, but the question is about seat work time. If she's not using blocks, she's probably leaving the seat. So, if she's sitting, she's using blocks, which would make her more engaged, leading her to complete her seat work. So option I is about allowing block play while doing seat work, which would encourage her to use them, thus completing her seat work.

Alternatively, option F is assigning a classmate to watch, which could prevent her from leaving. But it might not directly help her use blocks.

So I think the best answer is option I, because by allowing block play while she's sitting, she's likely to be more engaged and complete her seat work.

The best strategy to increase Mary's completion of seat work is to allow her block play while she's sitting. This encourages engagement and completion as she uses the blocks, which are integral to her seat work.

Answer: I
