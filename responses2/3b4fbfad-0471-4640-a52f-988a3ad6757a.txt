Okay, so I've got this question about LeroiWilson's business and his gross revenue for the week. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let me read the question again. Leroi supplies hand-made belts to boutique chains. Each belt costs him $2.80. He works six days a week, and over that week, he made a certain number of belts each day. The task is to find his gross revenue for the week.

Alright, so I think gross revenue is just the total amount he earns from selling the products, right? Since he's selling hand-made belts, each belt brings in $2.80. So the first thing I need to do is calculate how many belts he made in total during the week. Then, multiply that by $2.80 to get the total revenue.

Let me list out the number of belts he made each day:

Monday: 56 belts
Tuesday: 126 belts
Wednesday: 130 belts
Thursday: 110 belts
Friday: 118 belts
Saturday: 56 belts

I need to add all these numbers together. Let me do this step by step to avoid mistakes.

Starting with Monday: 56
Then Tuesday: 56 + 126 = 182
Wednesday: 182 + 130 = 312
Thursday: 312 + 110 = 422
Friday: 422 + 118 = 540
Saturday: 540 + 56 = 596

Wait, let me add them again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I'll pair them for easier addition.

Monday and Saturday: 56 + 56 = 112
Tuesday and Friday: 126 + 118 = 244
Wednesday and Thursday: 130 + 110 = 240

Now add those totals: 112 + 244 = 356; 356 + 240 = 596. Yep, same result.

So he made 596 belts in total.

Now, each belt is $2.80. So total revenue is 596 * 2.80.

Hmm, let me compute that. Breaking it down, 596 * 2 is 1192, and 596 * 0.80 is 476.80. So adding those together:

1192 + 476.80 = 1668.80.

Wait, that's $1,668.80. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, E is $1,668.80. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my addition of the belts. Maybe I missed something. Let's add them again:

56 (Mon) + 126 (Tue) = 182
182 + 130 (Wed) = 312
312 + 110 (Thu) = 422
422 + 118 (Fri) = 540
540 + 56 (Sat) = 596. Yes, that's correct.

So revenue calculation: 596 * 2.80.

Alternatively, 596 * 2 = 1192, 596 * 0.8 = 476.80. Sum: 1192 + 476.80 = 1668.80. So that's $1,668.80.

Looking at the options, option E is $1,668.80. So that's the correct answer.

The correct answer is E: $1,668.80.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the number of belts made each day:**
   - Monday: 56
   - Tuesday: 126
   - Wednesday: 130
   - Thursday: 110
   - Friday: 118
   - Saturday: 56

2. **Calculate the total number of belts:**
   - Add them sequentially: 56 + 126 = 182; 182 + 130 = 312; 312 + 110 = 422; 422 + 118 = 540; 540 + 56 = 596.

3. **Compute the total revenue:**
   - Multiply the total belts by the price per belt: 596 * $2.80 = $1,668.80.

4. **Match the result with the options provided:**
   - Option E: $1,668.80.

**Answer:** E: $1,668.80
