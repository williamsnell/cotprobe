Alright, let's try to tackle this genetics problem. Okay, so the question is about red-green colorblindness, which is a sex-linked trait. I remember that X-linked recessive traits are usually passed down differently compared to autosomal ones because males have only one X chromosome. 

So the problem says: the woman is normal vision, her father is colorblind (so she must be a carrier, right?), and she marries a normal-visioned man. We need to find the probability that their first child will be colorblind.

Wait, let's break it down. Red-green colorblindness is caused by the gene 'c'. Since it's recessive, the person must have two 'c' alleles to show the phenotype. The father is colorblind, which means his genotype is XcY because he must be a carrier. Oh wait no, wait a second. Wait, if the father is colorblind, he must have the c gene. But since males have only one X, he must have Xc Y. So his genotype is Xc Y.

Now the woman is normal. She's not colorblind, so she must be a carrier. Because if she were homozygous recessive, she would be colorblind. But she's normal, so she must be heterozygous. So her genotype is Xc Y. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the father is Xc Y. The mother is normal, so her genotype must be X^C X^C, because if she were Xc X^C, then she would be colorblind. But she's normal, so she's X^C X^C. So the woman is a carrier.

So the father is Xc Y, the mother is X^C X^C.

Now, they have a child. So the next generation would have what probabilities? Let's think about the possible offspring.

The father can pass either his X chromosome to the child. Since he's Xc Y, he can give either Xc or Y. Wait, no, wait: wait, the father's gametes would be Xc (50%) and Y (50%). The mother's gametes are X^C (100%).

So the child's genotype possibilities are Xc (from father) + X^C (from mother) = X^C Xc, or Y (from father) + X^C (from mother) = X^C Y.

So the child can be either X^C Xc (which is colorblind, since Xc is recessive) or X^C Y (normal). 

What are the probabilities? Well, the father has 50% chance to pass Xc and 50% to Y. The mother is 100% X^C. So for the child:

- 50% chance of X^C Xc (colorblind)
- 50% chance of X^C Y (normal)

Wait, but wait. The mother is X^C X^C. So the child can only get X^C from her. So the options are either Xc (from father) or Y (from father). So when the father gives Xc, the child is Xc X^C (50% Xc, 50% X^C). When the father gives Y, child is X^C Y (100% X^C). 

So the possible offspring will be:

- 50% of the time, the child is X^C Xc (colorblind)
- 50% of the time, the child is X^C Y (normal)

Wait, but wait. Wait, the father can only contribute either Xc or Y. So the probability of being Xc is 50%, which results in colorblind. The other 50% is Y, which makes the child normal.

So the chance of colorblind is 50% or 1/2.

But wait, looking at the options, the choices are A:1/5, B:2/3, etc. So none of the options is 1/2. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the sex-linked nature. Wait, since the father is male and his genotype is Xc Y, the mother can pass either her X to the child. So the father can pass Xc (with 50%) or Y (50%). So the child has 50% chance of being colorblind (Xc X^C) and 50% normal (X^C Y).

But wait, the options don't include 1/2. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the parents' genotypes.

Wait, the father is colorblind, so he's Xc Y. The mother is X^C X^C. So when she has a child, she can only contribute X^C.

So, the possible children are:

- Xc (from father) + X^C (from mother) = X^C Xc (colorblind)
- Y (from father) + X^C (mother) = X^C Y (normal)

So two possible outcomes. So the probability is 50%.

But the options don't include 1/2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me read the question again.

The question is, the woman is a normal woman, whose father was colorblind. So the father's genotype is Xc Y. The mother is X^C X^C.

They have a child. So the options are from A to J, and none is 1/2. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the father's genotype is. Because if the father is Xc Y, he can only give Xc or Y.

So, the mother can only give X^C. So the child will have either X^CXc or X^CY.

So the child's genotype is either X^CXc (colorblind) or X^CY (normal). Each outcome is 50%.

Wait, but the options don't have 1/2. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the father's genotype is X^c Y, not Xc Y. Because I think sometimes the c is recessive. Wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, the father is colorblind, which means he has the recessive allele. So he must have Xc Y. Because for a colorblind man, the X must be c. So the father's genotype is Xc Y.

So the mother is X^C X^C.

So each child has 50% chance of X^C Xc (colorblind) and 50% normal.

So the probability is 1/2.

But looking at the options, option E is 1/2. So the answer should be E, 1/2.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again. The options are A:1/5, B:2/3, C:1/6, D:3/4, E:1/2, F:1/3, G:1/4, H:1/8, I:2/5, J:1/10.

So yes, option E is 1/2. So why would the correct answer be E?

Wait, but wait... Oh! Wait, I think I made a mistake in thinking about the father's genotype.

The father is colorblind (so he has Xc Y), but the mother is X^C X^C.

But perhaps the father is a carrier. Wait, no. Colorblindness is when you have two recessive alleles. So if the father is colorblind, he must have the Xc allele. So his genotype is Xc Y.

But wait, am I mixing up the terms? So colorblindness is when the person has the genotype XcXc. So the father being colorblind means he has XcY. So the mother has X^C X^C.

So the child's genotype is X^C Xc (50% chance) or X^C Y (50% chance). Therefore, the probability of being colorblind is 50% or 1/2.

So the correct answer is E) 1/2.

Wait, but looking again, the options don't have E as 1/2. Oh wait, yes, option E is 1/2. So the answer is E.

The question involves a scenario where a normal-visioned woman, whose father was colorblind, marries a normal-visioned man. Red-green colorblindness is a sex-linked recessive trait, where the gene is located on the X chromosome. The father, being colorblind, must be a carrier (XcY), while the mother, being normal, is homozygous for the dominant allele (X^C X^C). The child's genotype depends on the father's X chromosomes (Xc or Y) and the mother's X^C allele.

- If the father's X chromosome is Xc, the child will receive Xc and X^C, resulting in the genotype X^C Xc (colorblind).
- If the father's X chromosome is Y, the child will receive X^C and Y, resulting in the genotype X^C Y (normal).

Since the father has a 50% chance of passing either Xc or Y, the child has a 50% (or 1/2) probability of being colorblind and a 50% chance of being normal. Among the provided options, the correct answer is **E: 1/2**.
