Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the volume of 0.3 N base required to neutralize 3 liters of 0.01 N nitric acid. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my acid-base titrations, but let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that in neutralization reactions, the moles of acid and base must be equal for the reaction to proceed completely. That's because the reaction is a 1:1 ratio, right? Wait, is that always the case? Oh yeah, because each acid donates one proton and each base accepts one proton. So, the moles of acid (like HNO3) should equal the moles of base (like NaOH or something) because they're both 1:1 in the reaction.

Wait, but I should probably write down the reaction equation to make it easier. So, nitric acid is HNO3, and base is probably NaOH, but since the question doesn't specify the base, I think the assumption is that the base is a monobasic strong base. So the reaction would be HNO3 + NaOH → NaNO3 + H2O. So the ratio is 1:1.

Now, I need to calculate the moles of HNO3 in 3 liters of 0.01 N solution. Wait, what's the 'normality' here? Oh right, normality (N) is defined as the number of equivalents of acidic or basic species per liter of solution. For a strong acid like HNO3, which donates one H+ (and thus one equivalent of acid), the normality is the same as the molarity. But wait, sometimes for bases, it's different. Wait, no, for a monobasic strong acid, normality equals molarity. So 0.01 N HNO3 means 0.01 equivalents per liter, which is the same as 0.01 moles per liter.

So, the moles of HNO3 = N (normality) × volume (in liters). So that's 0.01 N × 3 L = 0.03 moles of HNO3.

Now, the base we're using is 0.3 N. Let me denote the volume of base as V liters. The base (let's say it's NaOH) will provide equivalents equal to its normality times volume. So the equivalents from the base are 0.3 N × V liters.

Since the acid and base must neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio, their equivalents must be equal. So:

Equivalents of acid = Equivalents of base
0.03 = 0.3 × V

So solving for V: V = 0.03 / 0.3 = 0.1 liters.

Wait, so the volume of base needed is 0.1 liters. Looking at the options, option I is 0.1 liter. So the answer should be option I.

Let me double-check. Another way: moles of acid = 0.01 N * 3 L = 0.03 mol. Since each base provides 0.3 N, the volume of base needed is (0.03 mol) / (0.3 N) ) = 0.1 L. Yep, that's correct.

To calculate the volume of 0.3 N base required to neutralize 3 liters of 0.01 N nitric acid, we use the principle that the moles of acid and base must be equal for a 1:1 reaction ratio. 

1. **Moles of HNO₃**:  
   The normality (N) of HNO₃ is 0.01 N, and the volume is 3 L.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of HNO₃} = N \times \text{Volume} = 0.01 \, \text{N} \times 3 \, \text{L} = 0.03 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

2. **Equivalents of Base Needed**:  
   The base (assumed to be NaOH) has a normality of 0.3 N. Let the volume of base be \( V \) liters. The equivalents of base are:
   \[
   \text{Equivalents of base} = 0.3 \, \text{N} \times V.
   \]

3. **Equating Moles and Equivalents**:  
   For neutralization, moles of acid must equal equivalents of base:
   \[
   0.03 = 0.3 \times V.
   \]

4. **Solving for \( V \)**:  
   \[
   V = \frac{0.03}{0.3} = 0.1 \, \text{liters}.
   \]

Thus, the volume of 0.3 N base required is **0.1 liters**, which corresponds to option **I**.
