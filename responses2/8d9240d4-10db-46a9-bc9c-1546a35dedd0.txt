Okay, so I've got this question here about an ethical psychologist's role when a mother is checking her son's progress. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is that the mother is seeing a 31-year-old client and calls to discuss her son's progress. She's concerned and wants to know what she can do to help him. The question is about what an ethical psychologist would advise her to do.

I remember that ethical psychology focuses on helping individuals at their own risk, ensuring they feel safe and respected. So, the key here is to think about how an ethical approach would guide the mother's actions.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A suggests general advice on how to help. But the ethical approach would probably involve more specific guidance rather than general advice. So probably not A.

Option B talks about regular conversation. While that's a good idea, ethical psychology might emphasize structured, non-judgmental conversations. So maybe B is a bit off.

Option C is about providing emotional support. That makes sense because a mother would want to know the son's feelings without judgment. But wait, ethical psychology might require consent. So maybe C isn't allowed because it could involve the mother making decisions about whether to share.

Option D says to tell her the psychologist can't discuss her son's condition. That doesn't make sense. The psychologist should be there to help, not tell her what's going on.

Option E is about encouraging open communication. That's a positive approach. She could ask about his sessions and maybe ask him to share more.

Option F is about reading more about his condition. That's a proactive step, but again, does ethical psychology require her to seek out information herself? Probably not; the psychologist can guide her.

Option G suggests discarding detailed info. That would be unethical because the psychologist can't take away information from the client's condition.

Option H suggests seeking her own therapy. That might be a way to better understand his condition, but again, how would that fit into ethical practices?

Option I is about making an appointment. That's a standard approach, but ethical psychology might prefer involving the client to ensure they're comfortable.

Option J suggests her to come with her son. That's a good approach, as it can provide a collaborative environment and allow the psychologist to ask specific questions about his therapy sessions.

So, the key here is to determine what the ethical psychologist would advise. The options that involve the psychologist providing guidance or involving the client directly are more likely to be correct.

Looking at the options, the best approach is probably J, because it allows for a collaborative discussion. The mother would want to involve her son, which is a core principle of ethical psychology. So, the advice would be to have her come with her son at the next appointment. That way, the psychologist can discuss the son's progress in person, ensuring they feel safe and respected.

Wait, but what about providing emotional support? The question is about what the mother can do. So the advice would be to involve the son, not necessarily provide emotional support. So option J is the correct choice.

The correct answer is **J: suggest that she come to therapy with her son at his next appointment.**

**Explanation:**
An ethical psychologist would guide the mother to involve her son in the discussion. This approach ensures that the patient feels safe and respected, aligning with ethical principles. By having the mother attend the next session, the psychologist can facilitate a collaborative environment, allowing for specific questions about his therapy sessions. This approach respects the patient's autonomy and ensures their well-being. 

Answer: J
