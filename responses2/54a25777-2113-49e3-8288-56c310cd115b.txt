Question:

This question refers to the following information.
That day the Reverend Xuanzang was chosen from among all the monks. He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.

He looked to the West and prayed, "I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal." When he had prayed he bowed again.
From Wu Chengen, Journey to the West, ca. 1590s

Okay, so I have this question about a historical text, specifically about a religious figure named Xuanzang. The question is asking which option correctly identifies how the excerpt complicates the understanding of Xuanzang's career. Let me try to break this down.

The text in question is from a book called "Journey to the West" by Wu Chengen, written around the 16th century. The excerpt describes Xuanzang as a monk who ate vegetarian food, followed by a lot of his personal details. But wait, I remember that Xuanzang was actually a famous Chinese astronomer and mathematician, known for his contributions to the study of zodiac signs. He was among the top scholars in China during the Song Dynasty, which was around the 11th to 14th centuries. 

So the text here is from 1590s, which is way later than Xuanzang's time. That makes sense because the text is fictionalizing his story. So, the excerpt is a historical fiction, right? It's not based on real events but is a story crafted by a fictional writer. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: It highly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments. That makes sense because the text doesn't reflect his real achievements. He was an astronomer, not a religious figure. His story is presented as a religious journey and prayer, which is a modern fantasy.

Option B: It was written long after Xuanzang lived. Yes, that's correct. Xuanzang lived in the 12th century, and the text is from 1590s, so it's a later time. This doesn't necessarily complicate his career, though. It's more about the timeframe of the story than the complications in his life.

Option C: It casts doubt on the actual existence of Xuanzang. Well, if the text is fictional, it's a matter of belief. But casting doubt on existence might not be the best way to phrase it. The text is just a story, so it doesn't really challenge the existence of Xuanzang as a real person. It's more of a story than a historical account.

Option D: It is widely considered by scholars to be a forgery. I'm not sure about this. I don't recall specific scholars considering this text as a forgery. The text is likely fictional because it describes a religious journey, which is a common narrative style in historical fiction. However, without specific historical sources indicating it's a forgery, it's more about the storytelling style than a historical fact.

So the main complication here is that the text is fictionalizing the story of Xuanzang, making the details of his life and achievements seem unrealistic. So option A seems correct.
</think>

The excerpt is a fictional account of Xuanzang, presenting a religious journey instead of his real-life achievements. This makes the story highly fictionalizing, as it does not reflect his actual contributions to astronomy and mathematics.
