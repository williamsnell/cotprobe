Okay, so I've got this problem about choosing balls from a box. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The box has 4 red balls, 3 green, and 2 blue. We need to choose 4 balls with the condition that at least 2 are red. Hmm, okay, so I think the best approach here is to calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 balls without any restrictions and then subtract the cases where there are fewer than 2 red balls. That way, I'll be left with the cases where there are at least 2 red balls.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, another approach is to consider all possible scenarios where red balls are 2, 3, or 4. Because the problem says "at least 2," so the red balls can be 2, 3, or 4. That might be easier because it avoids subtracting the cases where there are fewer than 2 reds.

Let me try both methods and see if I get the same result. 

First method: Total combinations without restriction minus combinations where reds are 0 or 1.

So, total number of balls is 4 red + 3 green + 2 blue = 9 balls.

The total number of ways to choose any 4 balls from 9 is C(9,4). Let me calculate that. C(9,4) is 9!/(4!5!) = (9*8*7*6)/(4*3*2*1) = 126.

Now, subtract the cases where there are 0 red or 1 red.

Case 1: 0 red. Then we're choosing all 4 balls from green and blue. There are 3 green and 2 blue, so 5 balls in total. The number of ways is C(5,4) = 5.

Case 2: 1 red. Then we choose 1 red from 4, and 3 from the remaining (5 non-red). So, C(4,1)*C(5,3). C(4,1) is 4, C(5,3) is 10. So 4*10=40.

So total bad cases are 5+40=45.

Therefore, the number of good cases is 126-45=81.

Hmm, so that's 81. Looking at the options, option G is 81. So that's one possibility.

Alternatively, let's try the second method: directly compute the cases where red is 2,3,4.

Case 1: 2 red, 2 non-red.

Red balls: C(4,2) = 6.

Non-red: 5 balls (3 green +2 blue). So C(5,2) = 10.

So 6*10=60.

Case 2: 3 red, 1 non-red.

Red: C(4,3)=4.

Non-red: C(5,1)=5. So 4*5=20.

Case 3: 4 red, 0 non-red.

Red: C(4,4)=1.

Non-red: C(5,0)=1. So 1*1=1.

Total is 60+20+1=81.

So both methods give me 81, which is option G. So the answer should be G.

The correct approach is to calculate the number of ways with at least 2 red balls by considering cases where red is 2, 3, or 4. Using the multiplication principle:

- 2 red: C(4,2) * C(5,2) = 6 * 10 = 60
- 3 red: C(4,3) * C(5,1) = 4 * 5 = 20
- 4 red: C(4,4) * C(5,0) = 1 * 1 = 1

Total: 60 + 20 + 1 = 81.
