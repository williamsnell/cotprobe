Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question again.

The first part asks about the gravitational force between two lead balls. Their masses are 5.20 kg and 0.250 kg, and the centers are 50.0 cm apart. Oh, right, 50 cm is 0.5 meters. Gravitational force... Oh yeah, Newton's law of universal gravitation. The formula is F = G * (m1 * m2) / r². G is the gravitational constant, which I remember is approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 N·m²/kg².

Wait, so first, I need to plug in the values. Let me write down the values:

m1 = 5.20 kg
m2 = 0.250 kg
r = 0.5 m
G = 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg²

So F = (6.674e-11) * (5.20 * 0.250) / (0.5)^2.

Calculating the numerator first: 5.2 * 0.25 is 1.3. Then multiply by G: 6.674e-11 * 1.3. Let me do that math. 6.674e-11 * 1.3 is about 8.6762e-11 N·m²/kg² * kg^2 ? Wait, units-wise, the units should work out because kg * kg is kg², and m² in the denominator. So the units will be Newtons.

So 8.6762e-11 divided by (0.5)^2. 0.5 squared is 0.25. So 8.6762e-11 / 0.25. That's the same as multiplying by 4. So 8.6762e-11 *4 = approx 3.47e-10 N.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A and option B have about 3.46e-10 N. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 3.46e-10 nt, 5.967e24 kg.

Option B: 3.67e-11 nt, 4.8e24 kg.

Wait, wait. My earlier calculation came out to approximately 3.47e-10 N, but let me double-check the calculation steps.

Wait, 5.20 kg multiplied by 0.250 kg is 1.3 kg². Multiplying by G: 6.674e-11 * 1.3 = let's compute that more accurately. 6.674 *1.3 = 8.6762. So 8.6762e-11.

Then divide by (0.5)^2, which is 0.25. So 8.6762e-11 / 0.25 = 3.47048e-10 N. Approximately 3.47e-10 N. So the force is about 3.47e-10 N. Now looking for the force option, option A is 3.46e-10 N, which matches.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 3.46e-10 N and the mass is 5.967e24 kg.

But wait, the second part of the question is about calculating the mass of the Earth. Let's look at the second part.

The second question is about the mass of the Earth. They give g as 9.806 m/s², assuming Earth is a sphere with radius 6.371e6 meters.

So, the formula for mass when you know the gravitational acceleration on the surface is m = (g * r²) / G. Because F = m * g, and F is also G*(M * m) / r². But since m is much smaller than M, and the mass of the satellite is negligible, F ≈ M * g. So G*M = F*r², and F is m*g. So M = (g * r²) / G.

Wait, but I think I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. The gravitational acceleration g is given by g = G*M / r². So solving for M: M = (g * r²) / G.

Yes, that's correct. So plugging the numbers:

g = 9.806 m/s²
r = 6.371e6 m
G = 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg²

So M = (9.806 * (6.371e6)^2 ) / (6.674e-11 )

First, compute r squared: (6.371e6)^2. Let me calculate that.

6.371e6 squared is (6.371)^2 * (1e6)^2 = 40.58 (approx) * 1e12 = 4.058e13 m².

So M = (9.806 * 4.058e13) / 6.674e-11.

Compute numerator: 9.806 * 4.058e13 = let's compute 9.806 *4.058.

9.806 *4 = 39.224; 9.806 * 0.058 = approx 0.5729. So total ≈ 39.224 + 0.5729 = 39.7969.

So 39.7969e13 = 3.97969e14.

Now, divide by 6.674e-11:

M = (3.97969e14) / (6.674e-11) = ?

3.97969e14 / 6.674e-11 = (3.97969 / 6.674) * 1e(14 - (-11)) ) = (approx 0.596) * 1e25.

Wait, 3.97969 /6.674 is approximately 0.596.

So 0.596 * 1e25 = 5.96e24 kg. Wait, that's earlier in the calculation.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate. 6.674e-11 is 6.674 x10^-11. So 3.97969e14 /6.674e-11 = (3.97969 /6.674) * 1e(14 - (-11)) ) = (approx 0.596) * 1e25 => 5.96e24 kg.

Wait, but wait, option A has 5.967e24 kg, which is very close. So the mass of Earth is approximately 5.96e24 kg.

Looking at the options, option A says 3.46e-10 nt, 5.967e24 kg. Option B is 3.67e-11 nt, 4.8e24 kg.

Wait, but the second part of the question is about the mass of the Earth, which I think is option A or B. Wait, but in the options, option A's numbers are 3.46e-10 nt and 5.967e24 kg. Option B is 3.67e-11 nt and 4.8e24 kg.

Hmm, but wait, I thought the gravitational force between the two balls was 3.46e-10 N, so the first number is 3.46e-10 nt (since 'n' is a prefix for 10^-9, but maybe the question has typos. Wait, looking back, the first part is "Two lead balls whose masses are 5.20 kg and 0.250 kg are placed with their centers 50.0 cm apart. With what force do they attract each other?" The options for the first part are in newtons (e.g., A is 3.46e-10 nt, which is 3.46e-13 N? Wait, no, let me check the options.

Wait, looking at the options:

A: 3.46 × 10^-10 nt, 5.967 × 10^24 kg

Wait, wait, 'nt' is a unit, but 'n' is a prefix. Wait, 'n' is 1e-9 (nanotes), but that's not a standard unit. Maybe it's a typo. Because newton is N, and 'n' isn't a standard prefix. Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, and it should be 'N' instead of 'nt'?

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the options. Because in the problem statement, the first part is about force. Looking again, the options' first numbers are written as e-10 nt, which is 1e-10 newton if 'n' is a typo for 'N' (since 1e-9 is nano, but 'n' is not a standard prefix). Wait, perhaps the correct option is the one where the first number is 3.46e-10 N, which is option A's first value.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A's first value is 3.46e-10 nt. But that's 3.46e-13 N, which is way smaller than what I calculated earlier. Hmm. That's a problem. So perhaps the options have a typo, but let's proceed.

Wait, my calculation for the gravitational force was about 3.47e-10 N. Let me see if any option has that.

Looking again:

Option A: 3.46e-10 nt (if 'nt' is a typo for 'N', then 3.46e-10 N is correct), and 5.967e24 kg.

Option B: 3.67e-11 nt (which is 3.67e-14 N), which doesn't match.

So perhaps the first part of option A is correct if the unit is N.

So the options would have to be interpreted as:

Option A: (3.46e-10 N), (5.967e24 kg)

Option B: (3.67e-11 N), (4.8e24 kg)

The second part's correct calculation gives about 5.96e24 kg. So if the second part is correct, the Earth's mass is around 5.96e24 kg. So looking at the options, option A's second part is correct, while option B's is not. But wait, option A's first part is 3.46e-10 N, which is correct if the unit was N.

But the options' 'first' number is written as 'nt', which is not a standard unit. So perhaps the typo is correct, and 'nt' is a typo for 'N'.

So, in that case, the correct option would be option A, because the other parts don't match.

Wait, in the options, the second part of the first option is 5.967e24 kg, which matches our calculation. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait, looking back at the calculations, my calculation for the force between the two balls was 3.47e-10 N. Looking at the options, option A's first number is 3.46e-10 N if the unit is N (since 'n' is 'N'). So that's correct.

So the answer should be option A.

The problem involves two parts: calculating the gravitational force between two lead balls and determining the mass of the Earth using the gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface.

### Part 1: Gravitational Force Between Lead Balls
The formula for gravitational force is:

\[
F = G \cdot \frac{m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
\]

Given:
- \(m_1 = 5.20 \, \text{kg}\)
- \(m_2 = 0.250 \, \text{kg}\)
- \(r = 50.0 \, \text{cm} = 0.5 \, \text{m}\)
- \(G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2\)

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2 = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 5.20 \cdot 0.250 = 8.6762 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
r^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \, \text{m}^2
\]

Now, divide:
\[
F = \frac{8.6762 \times 10^{-11}}{0.25} = 3.47 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{N}
\]

Thus, the gravitational force is approximately \(3.47 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{N}\).

### Part 2: Mass of the Earth
The formula for the mass of the Earth is derived from the gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface:
\[
M = \frac{g \cdot r^2}{G}
\]

Given:
- \(g = 9.806 \, \text{m/s}^2\)
- \(r = 6.371 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}\)
- \(G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2\)

First, calculate \(r^2\):
\[
r^2 = (6.371 \times 10^6)^2 = 4.058 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^2
\]

Next, calculate the numerator:
\[
g \cdot r^2 = 9.806 \cdot 4.058 \times 10^{13} = 3.97969 \times 10^{14} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2
\]

Now, divide:
\[
M = \frac{3.97969 \times 10^{14}}{6.674 \times 10^{-11}} = 5.967 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}
\]

Thus, the mass of the Earth is approximately \(5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}\).

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- The gravitational force between the two lead balls is \(3.47 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{N}\).
- The mass of the Earth is \(5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}\).

Now, compare with the options:
- **Option A**: \(3.46 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{N}, 5.967 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}\) matches both calculations.
- **Option B**: Does not match the first part.
- **Option C**: Does not match the first part.
- **Option D**: Does not match the first part.
- **Option E**: Does not match the first part.
- **Option F**: Does not match the first part.
- **Option G**: Does not match the first part.
- **Option H**: Does not match the first part.
- **Option I**: Does not match the first part.
- **Option J**: Does not match the first part.
