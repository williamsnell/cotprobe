Question:

What is wrong in the following array declaration? int my _ array (200);

Options:

A: The datatype for the array elements is not specified
B: The array is not initialized
C: The array size is too large

Okay, so I have this question about array declarations, and I need to figure out which part is wrong in the given array declaration. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the array declaration: int my_array (200); And there are several options given, A to G. I need to pick which one is wrong.

Alright, let's think about how array syntax works. I remember that when you declare an array in C++, the syntax is something like: type name [subscripts]. So the basic structure is type name[size], right? Or size is optional?

Wait, if the size is omitted, like int my_array; then that's a different case. Because in that case, the array is implicitly sized to 0. Wait no, wait, no. Wait, no. Let me think. In C++, if you don't specify the size, the array is implicitly of size 0. But wait, I'm pretty sure that for arrays, when you don't specify the size, you can't have a variable reference without a fixed size. Or can you?

Wait, no. Wait, when you have an array declaration, the syntax is type name[size], where size is optional. So the array is of that size, or if size is omitted, it's implicitly 0? Or is that not correct?

Wait, wait. No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think: when you write int my_array;, that's an array without a size specified. But in C++, that's not allowed, because the array's size must be defined. So, the array must have a size to be valid. So the syntax is type name [size], where size is optional but not required. If the size is omitted, it's a compile error. So the correct syntax must include the size unless it's specified.

Looking back at the question, the given declaration is int my_array (200); Oh, wait, that's the problem. Because the size is 200, but the syntax is wrong. Let me parse it: the parentheses are without a comma or something. Wait, the syntax is (size), but the correct is (size), so the parentheses are missing.

Wait, no, the correct syntax is int my_array [200]; So the array name, the brackets, and then the size in square brackets. So in the given code, the parentheses are missing. So the code is int my_array (200); which is incorrect because it's missing the closing parenthesis after the size.

So the problem is that the semicolon is missing at the end. Or wait, wait, the syntax is: int my_array [200]; So the brackets are [200], and the closing parenthesis is needed. So the line ends with a semicolon. Oh, no, in C++, the syntax is type [name] [subscripts], and if the subscript is optional, it's written as [subscripts], but the brackets are required. So the correct line is int my_array [200]; So the given code is missing the closing parenthesis, which is a syntax error.

So looking at the options:

Option E: The semicolon is missing at the end of the declaration. So that's correct. Because the code as given ends with a semicolon, but it should have a closing bracket and a semicolon.

Wait, no. Wait the code is int my_array (200); which ends with a semicolon. So the array declaration is correct in terms of the syntax of the variable declaration, but it's missing the closing bracket. So the error is that the semicolon is missing because the array is not closed properly.

Wait no, wait, the correct array declaration is int my_array [200]; So the given code is missing the [200] part. So the line is incorrect because it's missing the closing bracket.

Alternatively, perhaps the size is allowed to be omitted if the array is empty, but that's not allowed. Wait, no, in C++, when you have an array without a size, it's implicitly 0. But that's for an array of primitives. Wait, but wait, no, in C++, if you have an array without a size, it's not allowed. Because arrays must have a size, even for primitives. So for example, int my_array; is a syntax error. It's not allowed.

Wait, but the given code is int my_array (200); So the array is declared without a size, which is invalid because the syntax requires the size in square brackets. So the correct syntax is [size], so the given code is wrong because it's missing the [200] part, or perhaps it's missing the closing parenthesis.

Wait, no, the problem is that the array is not closed properly. Because after the size in brackets, you need to close with a semicolon. So the given code is:

int my_array (200);

Which is incorrect because the array is declared without the closing bracket. So the code is missing the semicolon after the array name and the brackets. So the semicolon is missing.

Looking at the options:

Option D: The semicolon is missing at the end of the declaration.

So that's correct. Because the declaration is incomplete.

Wait, but wait, the problem is that the semicolon is missing, which is option D.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: datatype not specified. No, because the array is declared with type.

B: array not initialized. No, because arrays are initialized when you declare them.

C: array size too large. No, because the size is correctly specified.

D: semicolon missing. So the code ends with a semicolon but is missing the closing bracket.

E: array size should be a constant expression. No, because the size is a constant, but the declaration is incorrect.

F: array size must be defined after variable name. No, because the size must be defined with the [ ].

G: number of subscripts not in brackets. No, because the size is in brackets.

So the correct answer is D.
</think>

The array declaration is incorrect because it lacks the closing parenthesis after the array size. The correct syntax should include the closing bracket.

Answer: D
