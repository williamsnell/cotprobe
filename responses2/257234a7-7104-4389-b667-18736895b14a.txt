Okay, so I have this limit problem to solve: the limit as x approaches 1 of (x - 1) multiplied by sin(π divided by (x - 1)). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that when dealing with limits, especially involving trigonometric functions like sine, it's often helpful to use some kind of substitution or approximation. The expression inside the sine is π/(x - 1), and as x approaches 1, (x - 1) approaches 0. So, the argument of the sine function is going to be π divided by a very small number, which is going to be a large number. That suggests that sin(π/(x - 1)) might oscillate rapidly as x approaches 1, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

Wait, maybe I can use a substitution to simplify this. Let's let t = x - 1. Then, as x approaches 1, t approaches 0. So, substituting that in, the expression becomes t * sin(π / t). So now, the limit is as t approaches 0 of t * sin(π/t). 

Hmm, I remember that the sine function is bounded between -1 and 1. So, sin(π/t) is always between -1 and 1, regardless of t's value (as long as t isn't zero, which it isn't because we're taking the limit as t approaches 0). So, if I have t multiplied by something that's between -1 and 1, what happens when t approaches 0? Well, t is going to zero, but it's being multiplied by a bounded function. 

I think I can use the Squeeze Theorem here. The Squeeze Theorem says that if I have three functions, f(t) ≤ g(t) ≤ h(t), and if both f(t) and h(t) approach the same limit L as t approaches a certain point, then g(t) also approaches L. So, let's define f(t) = -|t| and h(t) = |t|. Since sin(π/t) is always between -1 and 1, -|t| ≤ t sin(π/t) ≤ |t|.

So, as t approaches 0, both -|t| and |t| approach 0. Therefore, by the Squeeze Theorem, t sin(π/t) must also approach 0. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because if t approaches zero, |t| is just the absolute value, so the limit of |t| as t approaches zero is zero. So, the limit of t sin(π/t) should be zero. But I'm not sure if that's the case, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again: when t approaches zero, sin(π/t) oscillates between -1 and 1, but t is going to zero, so t multiplied by a bounded oscillating function. Since t is going to zero, the product should go to zero, right? Because even though sin oscillates, the amplitude of the product's oscillation is decreasing as t approaches zero.

Wait, but another approach: let me consider the limit of t * sin(π/t) as t approaches 0. Let me make a substitution here. Let me set u = π/t. As t approaches zero, u approaches infinity. So, t = π/u. So, substituting, the expression becomes (π/u) * sin(u). So, the limit becomes π times (sin u / u) as u approaches infinity.

Hmm, I remember that the limit of sin(u)/u as u approaches infinity is zero because the sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, and as u grows, the denominator u grows without bound. So, the product of a bounded function and something approaching zero is zero. So, the limit is zero. 

Wait, but another thought: is there any way this limit could be non-zero? Because if sin(π/t) doesn't approach zero, but instead oscillates, but multiplied by t, which is going to zero, the product should go to zero. So, regardless of the oscillation, since t is approaching zero, the entire expression should approach zero.

Alternatively, let me think about if there's any way that the limit could be non-zero. Suppose the limit is L. Then, for any ε > 0, there exists a δ such that for |t| < δ, |t sin(π/t) - L| < ε. But if L is not zero, say L = 0, then for small t, t sin(π/t) is close to zero. If L were non-zero, then for small t, the product would be close to L, but since t is small, that's not possible. So, the limit must be zero.

Wait, but I thought about substitution. So, substitution gave me the same result. So, I think the limit is zero, which is option B.

Another way to think about it: as x approaches 1, (x-1) approaches zero, and sin(π/(x-1)) oscillates between -1 and 1. So, the product of a term going to zero and a bounded term. So, the limit is zero because the zero term dominates the oscillation. So, yeah, I'm pretty confident the limit is zero.

The limit as x approaches 1 of (x - 1) sin(π/(x - 1)) is evaluated by substituting t = x - 1, leading to the expression t sin(π/t). As t approaches 0, t sin(π/t) is bounded between -|t| and |t|, both of which approach 0. Thus, by the Squeeze Theorem, the limit is 0.

Answer: B: 0
