Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about lifting a crate using an ideal pulley system. The crate weighs 100 Newtons, and I need to find out how many meters the crate rises for every meter of rope pulled down.

Wait, I remember that in pulleys, the mechanical advantage plays a big role. But wait, what's the difference between ideal and real pulleys? Oh right, an ideal pulley system is one where the rope doesn't lose any energy, so there's no friction or other losses. So the effort force (the force I apply) is related to the weight of the object.

Oh yeah, the efficiency of the system is 100% here, so the work done on the crate is equal to the work done by the effort. The effort force is 25 N, right? So the effort force times the distance it moves (downwards) should equal the weight of the crate times the distance the crate moves up.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the effort force is the force I apply, but the pulley system can change the distance. Let me think: for a single fixed pulley, if I pull the rope down by 1m, the crate rises by 1m. But with a pulley system, like a compound one, the effort might have to move a longer distance to lift the crate.

Wait, no, wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The effort force is the force I apply. The distance I pull down is the same as the distance the crate moves up, but multiplied by some factor based on the pulley setup.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me take it step by step. The ideal pulley system's mechanical advantage (MA) is the number of rope segments supporting the weight. So MA = weight / effort. So here, MA = 100 N / 25 N = 4. So MA is 4.

What does that mean? Well, if the pulley system has a mechanical advantage of 4, then the effort force (25N) is four times the force needed to lift the crate. But wait, no, the effort is the force that's applied, so the weight of the crate (100N) is equal to the effort times the distance moved multiplied by the MA? Or is it the other way around.

Wait, no, the work done on the crate is equal to the work done by the effort. The effort force times the distance I pull down (d_effort) equals the weight (100N) times the distance the crate moves up (d_crate). So, 25 N * d_effort = 100 N * d_crate.

But wait, in a simple pulley setup, if I have a single fixed pulley, then d_effort = d_crate. But when there's a pulley system, like a block and tackle, the effort distance is longer. Let me think: for a single fixed pulley, it's 1m. For a block and tackle with, say, three rope segments, the effort distance is 3 meters for each meter the crate moves.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the mechanical advantage. The mechanical advantage is the ratio of effort force to resistance force. So MA = 100 / 25 =4. So, the effort is 4 times less than the resistance. So the effort distance is 4 times the resistance distance. Because the effort has to move 4 times as far as the resistance.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The mechanical advantage is the ratio of effort force to resistance force. So MA = (resistance force) / (effort force). Wait, no, maybe I should double-check the formula.

Wait, no, MA is the resistance force divided by the effort force. So MA = F_res / F_eff. Here, F_res is 100 N. F_eff is 25 N. So MA = 100/25 =4. So the MA is 4.

Now, in terms of the distance. The effort (F_eff) moves a distance d_eff, and the resistance (F_res) moves a distance d_res. The relation is that d_eff = MA * d_res. Because for each meter the resistance moves, the effort moves MA meters. So if the pulley system is, say, a single fixed pulley, MA is 1, so d_eff = d_res (each m down, crate moves 1m up). If it's a 3-rd rope pulley system, MA is 3, so for each m the crate moves, the effort moves 3m.

So in this case, MA is 4, so the effort moves 4 times the distance the crate moves. So, for every 1m the crate moves up, the effort (25N) pulls the rope down 4 meters. Because d_eff = 4 * d_res.

So the question is, how much does the crate rise for each meter pulled down. So if I pull down 1m, the crate goes up 0.25m? Wait, no. Wait, no, let me rephrase. If d_eff is 4 times d_res, then d_res = d_eff /4. So for every 1m that the rope is pulled down (d_eff), the crate moves d_eff / 4 up. So, when d_eff is 1m, d_res is 0.25m. So for each 1m pulled down, the crate rises 0.25m.

Wait, but wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Because, for example, with a 1m rope pulled down, the crate moves up 1m, but if the pulley system is more complex, it might move less. Oh, wait, no. Let me think about a block and tackle with 4 ropes. So for each m the crate moves up, the effort moves 4m. So, if I pull down 1m, the crate goes up 0.25m. So the answer would be 0.25m, which is 25 cm.

Wait, but the options don't have 0.25 m. Let me look. The options are A: none, B:1m, C:2m, D:25 cm, E:50m, F:100 cm, G:25m, H:50 cm, I:75 cm, J:10 cm. So D is 25 cm, which is 0.25 m. So that would be option D.

Wait, but wait again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting it the other way around. Because in the setup, the rope is being pulled down, and the crate is rising. So, for each (downward) meter, the crate goes up by (downward) * (1/MA). So yes, that's 0.25 m.

Wait, but is there a mistake here? Let's think again. So, if I'm pulling down 1m, the effort force is 25N. The work done by the effort is 25N *1m=25 Nm. The work done on the crate is 100 N * d, where d is the rise. So 25*1 =100*d => d=0.25m.

Yes, that's correct. So for each 1m down, the crate goes up 0.25m. So the crate rises 25 cm for each meter of rope pulled down.

Looking back at the options, D is 25 cm. So the answer should be D.

To determine how many meters the crate rises for every meter of rope pulled down, we analyze the given setup using basic physics principles. The crate has a weight of 100 N, and an effort force of 25 N is applied. The pulley system has a mechanical advantage (MA) of 4, calculated as:

\[
\text{MA} = \frac{\text{Resistance Force}}{\text{Effort Force}} = \frac{100 \, \text{N}}{25 \, \text{N}} = 4
\]

The mechanical advantage indicates that the effort distance is four times the resistance distance. For every meter the crate rises, the effort rope must pull down four meters. Thus, the crate rises **25 cm (0.25 m)** for every meter of rope pulled down. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A: None of these** is incorrect because 25 cm is a valid answer.
- **B: 1 m** is incorrect because the crate does not rise 1 meter for each meter of rope pulled down.
- **C: 2 m** is incorrect because the crate only rises 25 cm (0.25 m) for each meter of rope pulled down.
- **D: 25 cm** is correct because it matches the calculated rise (0.25 m).
- **E: 50 m**, **F: 100 cm (1 m)**, **G: 25 m**, **H: 50 cm (0.5 m)**, **I: 75 cm**, and **J: 10 cm** are all incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **D: 25 cm**.
