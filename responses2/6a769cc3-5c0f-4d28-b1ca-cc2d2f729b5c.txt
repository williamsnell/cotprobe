Okay, so I have this question here: If there's a 70% chance it will rain on a given day, what's the chance it won't rain? Hmm, I remember from school that probabilities can sometimes add up to 100% when there are only two outcomes. Like, if it rains or it doesn't rain, those are the only two possibilities. So, if one is 70%, the other should be 100% minus 70%, which is 30%. Wait, let me think again. Oh wait, no, wait. Because probabilities are percentages, right? So 70% chance of rain means 30% chance of no rain. So the answer should be 30%. Looking at the options, option J says 30%. So I think the correct answer is option J.

The probability of no rain is 30% because 100% minus 70% (the chance of rain) equals 30%.

Answer: J
