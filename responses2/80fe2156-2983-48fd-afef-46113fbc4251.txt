Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about economics. The question is about how Monetarists stabilize economic fluctuations. I'm a bit rusty on my macroeconomics, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, first, I remember that Monetarists are a school of thought in economics that believe the central bank should control the money supply. They argue that the economy is inherently unstable and they can stabilize it by managing money more carefully. So, the key point is controlling money.

What do Monetarists do? They probably focus on the monetary policy tools. I think the main tools are increasing or decreasing the money supply, adjusting interest rates, and perhaps controlling exchange rates. But the question is about stabilization.

Option A says decreasing the money supply. Monetarists might support this as a way to reduce inflation and stabilize the economy. Lowering the money supply makes people demand less money, which can cool down the economy, making things more stable.

Option B is stabilizing the growth rate of the money supply. Wait, that doesn't sound right. If the money supply is growing too much, that can cause inflation, which isn't good. Monetarists probably don't want to increase the money supply beyond a certain point because that can lead to inflation. So maybe B isn't the way Monetarists go.

Option C is manipulating exchange rates. That's more of a foreign policy approach, not directly a monetary policy tool. Monetarists are concerned with domestic factors, so exchange rates might be handled by other means, like adjusting the balance of payments or something else.

Option D is imposing tariffs on imports. That would increase the cost of imported goods, which could reduce demand and lower prices. But does that directly stabilize the economy? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's a primary tool of Monetarists. They might focus more on the money supply and interest rates.

Option E is adjusting tax rates. That can definitely affect the economy, but again, I'm not sure if it's a primary tool for Monetarists. They focus on the money supply and interest rates, so maybe E isn't the answer.

Option F is providing direct subsidies to failing industries. That's more of a fiscal policy approach, which is different from Monetarist methods. They're more concerned with the money supply than direct aid to businesses.

Option G is using wage-price guidelines. I'm a bit vague here. I think wage-price theory is part of classical/monetarist theories. Monetarists might set wage levels or adjust prices based on inflation targets. So using wage-price guidelines could help control inflation, which is a key part of economic stability.

Option H is increasing government spending. That's a fiscal policy tool. Monetarists might not as much as focus on increased government spending, but it's possible. However, I'm not sure if that's their main approach.

Option I is implementing price controls on essential goods. Price controls can distort supply and demand, which might not be desirable for the economy. They might lead to shortages or price spikes, which could harm businesses and consumers. So I don't think that's a Monetarist approach.

Option J is increasing interest rates. That's a Monetarist tool. When interest rates rise, borrowing becomes more expensive, which reduces spending and can cool down the economy. It also makes it harder for the government to borrow, which might help stabilize the financial system.

So putting it together: Monetarists would focus on managing the money supply. Decreasing it could help reduce inflation and stabilize the economy. Stabilizing growth rate would be tricky because too high a money supply can cause inflation. So the correct answer must be either A or J.

Wait, the question is about how to stabilize fluctuations. Decreasing the money supply (A) would make the economy less prone to inflation, which is good. Alternatively, increasing interest rates (J) would also help by discouraging borrowing, which can reduce aggregate demand.

Hmm, but Monetarists are known for using the monetary policy tools, not fiscal ones. So the primary approach would be A: decreasing the money supply. Because they focus on the quantity theory of money and the money multiplier effect.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused between the quantity theory and monetary policy. The quantity theory says that money growth affects prices, while monetary policy is about the policy tools. But in this question, the options are about the tools. So if Monetarists are using monetary policy tools, they'd adjust the money supply, perhaps decreasing it. While increasing interest rates is a fiscal policy tool, but perhaps not Monetarist.

So the correct answer should be A: By decreasing the money supply.

Monetarists believe that the economy is inherently unstable and that the central bank should manage the money supply to stabilize fluctuations. They focus on tools like decreasing the money supply to reduce inflation and stabilize the economy. 

- **Option A** suggests decreasing the money supply, which aligns with Monetarist principles.
- **Option J** proposes increasing interest rates, which is a fiscal policy tool, not a primary approach of Monetarists.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A
