Alright, so I have this question about the global fertility rate in 2015. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on population stats, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, the options are A to J, with numbers ranging from 0.5 up to 6.5. I remember that the fertility rate is usually reported as the average number of children per woman. Let me think about when the global rates were around that time.

I think the 2015 data might not be the latest, but I recall some general trends. In the past, especially in the 20th century, the fertility rate was lower. For instance, the United States had a lower rate, maybe around 1.5-2.0 children per woman. Countries like Germany and the UK might have had rates around 2.5 to 3.5.

Wait, I'm not entirely certain. Let me consider the options. Option D is 0.5, which seems too low, probably not the right answer. Option B is 4, which is a common number for some countries but not sure if it's the 2015 rate.

Option E, 4.5, that's higher. I'm not sure if that was the case. I think the initial 20th-century data was lower. Option J is 6.5, which seems extremely high. Definitely not right.

Looking at the other options: C is 5.5, which might be a mid-range number for some countries, but I'm not certain. Option F is 1.5, which could be a historical rate. Option G is 3, which is lower than some other options but higher than D. Option H is 3.5, which I think was a bit higher than average.

Wait, I remember that the 2015 global fertility rate was around 2.5-3.5, but I'm not sure of the exact figure. Alternatively, maybe it's lower, like 1.5. Hmm.

Another approach: I think the median global fertility rate for 2015 was around 2.5 children per woman. That would make option H the correct answer. Alternatively, I'm a bit confused because I've heard sometimes the rate was lower. Wait, another thought: In the 2010s, some countries had rates around 2.5, but perhaps the global average was a bit lower.

Wait, maybe the 2015 rate was around 2.5, making option H correct. Alternatively, I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again. The question is asking the rate as of 2015, which I think was lower than today, but higher than some other options.

Wait, another angle: Looking up historical data, I recall that the 1980s had a higher fertility rate, but 2015 might have fallen into a lower range. Let me try to recall specific numbers. I think some sources say that the global fertility rate in 2015 was around 2.5. So option H (3.5?) or H is 3.5. Wait, no, I think it's around 2.5. So option H is 3.5, which is higher than that. No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the options again. The options are A:2, B:4, C:5.5, D:0.5, E:4.5, F:1.5, G:3, H:3.5, I:2.5, J:6.5.

If the 2015 rate was 2.5, then option I. But I'm not sure. Another thought: Maybe the global average was around 2.5. So option H is 3.5, which is higher than that. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D:0.5, but that seems too low. Alternatively, maybe the answer is I:2.5. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, I think I remember that the global fertility rate in 2015 was about 2.5. So option I would be 2.5. So the answer would be I:2.5.
