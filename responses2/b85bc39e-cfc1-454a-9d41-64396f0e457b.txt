Okay, so I've got this question about birthdays and months. Hmm, I've heard something about this before. Let me think. It's probably a problem related to the pigeonhole principle. Oh right, the pigeonhole principle is when you have more items than containers, so at least one container has more than one item. 

The question is asking, what's the minimum number of people needed in a group so that at least two share the same birthday month. Wait, but waitâ€”the question says "same month." So I think we're only considering the month as the container. So there are 12 months. 

So, if I have one person per month, that's 12 people. But if I have 13 people, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two must share a month. Because there's only 12 months, and 13 people can't all fit into 12 without overlap. So the minimum number would be 13. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option G is 13. So that must be the correct answer. Let me make sure I'm not mixing it up. Wait, another way to think about it: if you have 12 people, each in a different month, so no two share a month. So 13 would have to result in at least two sharing a month. Yeah, that makes sense.

The minimum number of people needed is 13, as per the pigeonhole principle.
