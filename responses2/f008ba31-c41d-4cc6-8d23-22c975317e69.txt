Okay, so I've got this question about capacitors. Let me think about how to approach it. 

The question says there are four capacitors, each with a capacitance of 40 microfarads (µF), and they're connected in parallel. I need to find the equivalent capacitance of the system. 

Wait, what do I remember about capacitors in parallel? Oh right, when capacitors are connected in parallel, their equivalent capacitance is just the sum of their individual capacitances. So each capacitor adds its own value to the total.

Each capacitor is 40 µF, and there are four of them. So if I add 40 four times, that should give me the total. Let me calculate: 40 + 40 is 80, plus another 40 is 120, and one more gives 160. Oh wait, no, wait. I think I made a mistake here. Each capacitor is 40, but four of them. So 4 * 40 = 160. So the equivalent capacitance is 160 µF.

Looking at the options, option F is 160 µF. So that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. Oh, in parallel, the voltage across each is the same, but the charge adds up. But for capacitance, it's just the sum. So yeah, I'm confident it's F.

The question involves calculating the equivalent capacitance of four capacitors, each with a capacitance of 40 µF, connected in parallel. When capacitors are connected in parallel, their equivalent capacitance is the sum of their individual capacitances. 

Each capacitor has a capacitance of 40 µF, and there are four such capacitors. Adding the capacitances together:  
4 * 40 µF = 160 µF.

Thus, the equivalent capacitance of the system is 160 µF. 

ANSWER: F
