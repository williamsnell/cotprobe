Alright, let's tackle this FM signal problem. So, the question is about an FM signal that ranges from 100.02 MHz to 99.98 MHz, and it's modulated by a 3 kHz sine wave. I need to find the carrier frequency, carrier swing, frequency deviation, and index of modulation. The options are labeled A through J, each with different values. Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

First, I remember that in FM, the signal is a modulated version of a carrier frequency. The carrier swing is the difference between the maximum and minimum frequencies of the modulated signal. So for part (A), the carrier frequency f_c of the signal is probably the midpoint between f_max and f_min. Let me calculate that.

f_max is 100.02 MHz and f_min is 99.98 MHz. So the midpoint would be (100.02 + 99.98)/2. Calculating that: 100.02 + 99.98 is 200 MHz, divided by 2 is 100 MHz. So f_c is 100 MHz. So that's option A, B, C, etc. Hmm, looking at the options, let's see which have f_c=100 MHz. Looking at the options, options B, C, D, F, H, I, J. Wait no, wait: A is 100.01 MHz, which is higher. So the options with f_c=100 MHz are B, C, D, F, H, I, J.

Wait, no. Option B: f_c=100 MHz. So A is 100.01 MHz, which is higher than our midpoint. So the f_c must be 100 MHz. So among the options, which have f_c=100 MHz? Let's see:

Option B: f_c=100 MHz, swing=44 kHz, deviation=22, index 7.333.

Option C: 100 MHz, swing=70, deviation=35, index 11.666.

Hmm, but wait, let's check each step.

Wait, no, let me think again. The question says the signal ranges from 100.02 to 99.98 MHz, which is a range of 0.04 MHz, or 40 kHz. So the carrier swing would be half of that, since the swing is the difference between max and min.

Wait, the swing is the maximum deviation from the carrier. So the total swing is (100.02 - 99.98) = 0.04 MHz, or 40 kHz. So the swing is 40 kHz. That would make the carrier swing 40 kHz. So looking for options where the carrier swing is 40 kHz. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option F: carrier swing=40 kHz, index=6.666. So that's one possibility.

Wait, but another point: the problem says the signal is modulated by a 3kHz sine wave. So the modulation is at 3 kHz. So the maximum deviation is equal to the frequency deviation, which is the product of the modulating frequency and the index of modulation. Wait, no. The frequency deviation (Δf) is given by β * f_m, where β is the index of modulation and f_m is the modulating frequency. So Δf = β * f_m.

In this problem, the modulating frequency f_m is 3 kHz. So if we can find Δf from the swing, then we can find β as Δf / f_m.

Wait, so first, let's think about each option.

Option B: carrier swing=44 kHz, which is more than 40. So if f_c is 100 MHz, swing is 44 kHz. Then Δf (frequency deviation) would be half the swing, because swing is the difference between the maximum and minimum, which is the twice the maximum deviation. Wait, no: the swing is the maximum deviation from the carrier. Wait, no, the swing is the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies, which would be twice the frequency deviation. Because the maximum is f_c + Δf, the minimum is f_c - Δf. So the swing is (f_c + Δf) - (f_c - Δf) = 2Δf. So swing = 2Δf.

So in option B, swing is 44 kHz. So Δf would be 22 kHz. But wait, the modulating frequency is 3 kHz. So Δf = β * f_m → 22 = β * 3 → β ≈ 7.333. Which is 7.333. Looking at option B, the index is 7.333, which matches this. So that seems correct.

Wait, but let's check other options.

Option F: carrier swing 40 kHz, which is exactly what we found. Let's compute Δf. Swing is 40 kHz. So Δf would be 20 kHz. Because swing is 2Δf.

So 20 kHz = β * 3 kHz → β = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667. Which matches option F's β of 6.667. So this also seems correct.

Wait, but wait, another point. So the problem says the signal ranges from 100.02 to 99.98 MHz. So f_c is 100 MHz. Let's see.

For option B: swing is 44 kHz. So f_c + Δf = 100 MHz + 22 kHz = 100.022 MHz. But the given max is 100.02 MHz, which is less than 100.022. Hmm, that's a problem because the maximum would be higher than the given 100.02 MHz. So option B seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Oh, no, because the maximum is 100.02 MHz, which is 100 MHz plus 2 MHz. Wait, wait, 100 MHz is 100,000 kHz. So 2 MHz is 2000 kHz. So the maximum is 100 MHz + 2000 kHz = 102 MHz. But in the problem, the maximum is 100.02 MHz, which is 100.02 MHz = 100,020 kHz. So 100 MHz is 100,000 kHz. 100.02 MHz is 100,020 kHz. So the swing would be 100.020 - 99.980 = 40 kHz. So the swing is 40 kHz.

So if the swing is 40 kHz, then the frequency deviation Δf is 20 kHz (swing = 2Δf). So Δf = 20 kHz.

Now, Δf is equal to β * f_m. So 20 kHz = β * 3 kHz → β = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

So option F's β is 6.6667, which matches. So option F has ω_c=100 MHz, swing=40 kHz, deviation=20 kHz, index=6.6667.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Looking at option H: f_c=99.99 MHz, which is incorrect because our calculation says 100 MHz. So H is f_c=99.99 MHz.

Option I: f_c=99.99 MHz, which is wrong.

Option J: f_c=99.99 MHz, no.

So the correct f_c must be 100 MHz, so options B, C, D, F, H, I, J.

Wait, wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the initial calculation: the range is 100.02 MHz to 99.98 MHz. The difference is 0.04 MHz, which is 40 kHz. So the swing is 40 kHz. So the carrier swing is 40 kHz. So only options B and F have a swing of 40 kHz.

Option B: swing=44 kHz. Doesn't match. Option F: swing=40.

So the correct option must be F. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the swing is the difference between maximum and minimum. So 100.02 MHz - 99.98 MHz = 0.04 MHz = 40 kHz. So swing is 40 kHz. So option F's swing is 40 kHz, which matches.

So that would make option F the correct answer. But let's check the other parameters.

Now, the frequency deviation is 20 kHz. Because swing is 40 kHz, so Δf is 20 kHz.

So Δf = β * f_m → 20 = β * 3 → β = 20/3 ≈6.66666667.

So option F's β is 6.6667, which is correct.

So the correct answer is option F.

Wait, but wait, looking at option F, let me recheck. The question states that the signal is modulated by a 3 kHz sine wave. So the modulating frequency is 3 kHz. So the frequency deviation is β times f_m, which is 3 kHz.

So 20 kHz is the frequency deviation, which is β *3 kHz → β is 20/3 ≈6.6667. So yes, that's correct.

So the correct options are:

f_c: 100 MHz.

Carrier swing: 40 kHz.

Frequency deviation: 20 kHz.

Index of modulation β: 6.6667.

Looking at the options, option F says:

f_c=100 MHz, swing=40 kHz, deviation=20 kHz, beta=6.667. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, another point: in FM, the maximum frequency is f_c + Δf, and the minimum is f_c - Δf. So for option F, f_c is 100 MHz, Δf is 20 kHz=20,000 Hz.

So maximum frequency is 100,000,000 + 20,000 = 100,020,000 Hz (100.02 MHz). The minimum is 100,000,000 - 20,000 = 99,980,000 Hz (99.98 MHz). Which matches the given problem's data.

So option F seems correct.

But wait, another thought: the question says "modulated by a 3 kHz sine wave." So the modulating frequency is 3 kHz. So in option F, the modulating frequency is 3 kHz, which matches. So it's correct.

So the correct option is F: f_c=100 MHz, swing=40 kHz, deviation=20 kHz, β=6.667.

Wait, but looking at option F, which says:

(f_c=100 MHz, swing=40 kHz, deviation=20 kHz, index=6.667)

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, what about the index of modulation? The index (β) is the maximum value of the envelope of the modulated signal. It's calculated as Δf divided by f_m. So in this case, 20,000 / 3,000 = 6.666..., which is 6.6667. So option F's β is correct.

Looking at other options, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me review all the options.

Option B: f_c=100 MHz, swing=44 kHz, deviation=22 kHz, β=7.333.

Wait, let's compute the swing for option B: swing is 44 kHz, which would mean Δf is 22 kHz. Then 22,000 / 3,000 = 7.3333, which is correct. But the swing is 44 kHz, but our calculation for the swing is 40 kHz. So option B is wrong because the swing isn't 40. Instead, it's 44.

So option B is incorrect.

Similarly, option F's swing is 40, which matches our calculation.

Option C: swing 70 kHz, which is wrong.

Option D: swing 20, which would imply Δf is 10. So 10 / 3 is about 3.333, but the options for D have β=3.333, which doesn't match.

Option E: f_c=100.02 MHz, which can't be correct because we found f_c is 100 MHz.

Similarly, option G, H, I, J all have f_c=99. etc., which can't be correct.

So the only correct option is F.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given FM signal with a frequency range of 100.02 MHz to 99.98 MHz, modulated by a 3 kHz sine wave. The goal is to determine the carrier frequency, carrier swing, frequency deviation, and index of modulation (β).

### Step 1: Determine the carrier frequency (f_c)
The carrier frequency is the midpoint of the signal's frequency range:
\[
f_c = \frac{100.02 \, \text{MHz} + 99.98 \, \text{MHz}}{2} = 100 \, \text{MHz}.
\]
Thus, \( f_c = 100 \, \text{MHz} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the carrier swing
The carrier swing is the difference between the maximum and minimum frequencies:
\[
\text{Carrier swing} = 100.02 \, \text{MHz} - 99.98 \, \text{MHz} = 0.04 \, \text{MHz} = 40 \, \text{kHz}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the frequency deviation (Δf)
The frequency deviation is half of the carrier swing because the swing is the total deviation from the carrier:
\[
\Delta f = \frac{\text{Carrier swing}}{2} = \frac{40 \, \text{kHz}}{2} = 20 \, \text{kHz}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the index of modulation (β)
The index of modulation is given by:
\[
\beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m},
\]
where \( f_m = 3 \, \text{kHz} \). Substituting the values:
\[
\beta = \frac{20 \, \text{kHz}}{3 \, \text{kHz}} = 6.6667.
\]

### Step 5: Verify the options
Now, we compare the calculated values with the options:
- **Option F**: \( f_c = 100 \, \text{MHz}, \, \text{carrier swing} = 40 \, \text{kHz}, \, \Delta f = 20 \, \text{kHz}, \, \beta = 6.667 \). This matches all the calculations.

Other options are incorrect because:
- Option B has a higher carrier swing (44 kHz) and β (7.333), which do not match the calculated values.
- Option C has an incorrect carrier swing (70 kHz) and β (11.667), which are inconsistent with the given data.
- Option D has a lower carrier swing (20 kHz) and β (3.333), which are also inconsistent.
- Option E has an incorrect carrier frequency (100.02 MHz), which does not match the calculated \( f_c = 100 \, \text{MHz} \).
- Options G, H, I, and J have incorrect carrier frequencies (99.98 MHz or lower), which are not supported by the calculations.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **F**: \( f_c = 100 \, \text{MHz}, \, \text{carrier swing} = 40 \, \text{kHz}, \, \Delta f = 20 \, \text{kHz}, \, \beta = 6.667 \).
