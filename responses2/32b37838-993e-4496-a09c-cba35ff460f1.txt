Okay, so I've got this problem about a gas thermometer. Let me try to understand it step by step. So, the setup is about a constant-volume perfect gas thermometer. I remember that a gas thermometer measures temperature based on the pressure of a gas. Since it's a perfect gas, I think it follows the ideal gas law.

The problem states that the temperature is the triple point of water, which is 273.16 K. At this temperature, the pressure is 6.69 kPa. They're asking what change in pressure indicates a change of 1.00 K at this temperature.

Hmm, so essentially, the question is about the relationship between pressure and temperature under constant volume. Since it's a perfect gas, I think the pressure is directly proportional to the temperature when volume is constant (since PV = nRT, and if V is constant, P ∝ T).

Wait, right! The ideal gas law for a fixed volume would mean P is directly proportional to T. So, if T increases by 1 K, P should increase by a factor related to the slope of the pressure-temperature graph.

Wait, but wait. The perfect gas thermometer doesn't have a fixed measurement range, right? Because the ideal gas law doesn't have any absolute scale. So, it's only useful between two specific points, like the triple point maybe. So, at T1 = 273.16 K, P1 = 6.69 kPa. When T increases by ΔT=1 K, what is the corresponding change in P, ΔP?

Since P is proportional to T, the change in pressure should be (P2 - P1)/(T2 - T1) = (P2 - P1)/1 K = P2 - 6.69.

But wait, wait. Wait, I'm trying to find ΔP when ΔT is 1 K. So, the change in pressure would be the slope of the P-T curve multiplied by ΔT. Since for a perfect gas, P = (nR/V) T, the slope is nR/V. But we don't know the exact n or V. Oh, but wait, the problem doesn't give us any other information, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't give us any other data points. So maybe all we can do is relate the change. Since the pressure is directly proportional to the temperature, the ratio (P2 - P1) / (T2 - T1) = (P2 - P1) / 1.

But wait, that would be the case if the change is over a small temperature interval. But since the ideal gas's P-T relationship is linear only within the range of the perfect gas. So, the slope is (P2 - P1)/(T2 - T1), and since T2 = T1 + 1, the slope is (P2 - 6.69) / 1. So, P2 = 6.69 + (slope)*1.

But without knowing the slope, how can I find the change in pressure? Wait, I might have missed something. The problem says, "what change of pressure indicates a change of 1.00 K at the latter temperature?" Oh, perhaps the setup is that the pressure is measured in a perfect gas thermometer, which implies that the pressure is directly proportional to the temperature.

So, at triple point (273.16 K, 6.69 kPa), if the temperature increases by 1 K, what's the corresponding pressure change.

Wait, but the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The question is about the change in pressure for a change in temperature. So, the change in pressure is (ΔP) = (P2 - P1), where P2 is the pressure at T2 = T1 + ΔT. Since T1 is 273.16 K, and ΔT is 1 K, so T2 is 274.16 K.

Wait, but without knowing P2, how can I calculate ΔP? Unless I'm using the ideal gas law to relate the two points. Because in a perfect gas, the pressure is directly proportional to temperature.

Wait, but without any other data, perhaps the question is just about the proportionality. So, if P is proportional to T, then (P2 - P1)/(T2 - T1) = (P2 - 6.69)/(1) = ΔP. So, ΔP = P2 - 6.69. But how do I find P2? Oh, wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the pressure is measured at the triple point, and any change in pressure corresponds to a change in temperature based on the ideal gas law.

Wait, but the question is about the change in pressure for a change of 1 K. So, if the temperature increases by 1 K, the pressure should increase by (P2 - P1), which is the same as (nR/V) * ΔT. But since I don't know n or V, I can't compute it. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but maybe the question is just about finding the slope of the P-T curve. Since at T = 273.16 K, P = 6.69 kPa. The slope is (P2 - 6.69) / (1 K). But without knowing P2, I can't compute this. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the change in pressure when the temperature changes by 1 K. So, the change in pressure is the same as the slope multiplied by the change in temperature. So, that's (delta P) = slope * 1. But the slope is (P2 - 6.69) / 1, so delta P = P2 - 6.69. But I don't know P2. Unless... perhaps the problem assumes that the pressure is measured in such a way that the change is proportional.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The problem states that it's a constant-volume perfect gas thermometer. So, the pressure is directly proportional to temperature. So, when the temperature changes, the pressure changes proportionally. The change in pressure (ΔP) is equal to (P2 - P1) = (T2 - T1) * (slope).

But since at T=273.16 K, P=6.69 kPa, and T2 = 273.16 + 1 = 274.16 K, then:

P2 = (274.16 / 273.16) * 6.69 kPa.

Then, ΔP = 6.69 kPa * (274.16 / 273.16 - 1) ≈ 6.69 * ( (274.16 - 273.16)/(273.16) ) ) = 6.69 * (1/273.16) * 1, because 274.16 - 273.16 = 1.

Wait, 1/273.16 is approximately 0.00366037. So, 6.69 * 0.00366037 ≈ ?

Let me compute that: 6.69 * 0.00366037 = let's see.

6.69 * 0.00366037 ≈ 0.02444 kPa. So, approximately 0.0244 kPa.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.0245 kPa, which is very close. So, the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because if the pressure is directly proportional to temperature, then the change would be (T2 - T1) * (P2/P1) = (1 K) * (6.69/273.16) kPa.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, because P ∝ T, so (P2 - P1) = (T2 - T1) * (P2 / T2) )? No, that's not correct. Because if P is proportional to T, then P2 = k * T2, P1 = k * T1. So, (P2 - P1) = k (T2 - T1). So, (P2 - P1) = (T2 - T1) * (P2/(T2)) ). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. If P = nRT/V, and V is constant, so P is proportional to T. So, P1 = n R T1 / V, and P2 = n R T2 / V.

So, P2 is (T2 / T1) * P1. So, (P2 - P1) = (T2 / T1 - 1) * P1 = ( (T2 - T1)/T1 ) * P1.

So, the change in pressure is ( (T2 - T1)/T1 ) * P1. In this case, T2 = T1 + 1, so (1 / 273.16) * 6.69 = 6.69 / 273.16 ≈ 0.02444 kPa.

Yes, that's about 0.024 kPa, which is option E: 0.0245 kPa. So the correct answer should be E.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relationship between pressure and temperature for a constant-volume perfect gas thermometer. Since the pressure is directly proportional to the temperature (from the ideal gas law, \( P \propto T \)), the change in pressure (\( \Delta P \)) for a small change in temperature (\( \Delta T \)) is given by:

\[
\Delta P = \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1} \cdot P_1
\]

Here:
- \( T_1 = 273.16 \, \text{K} \) (triple point temperature of water),
- \( P_1 = 6.69 \, \text{kPa} \) (corresponding pressure at \( T_1 \)),
- \( \Delta T = 1.00 \, \text{K} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P = \frac{1.00}{273.16} \cdot 6.69
\]

First, calculate the ratio:

\[
\frac{1.00}{273.16} \approx 0.003660
\]

Then, multiply by \( P_1 \):

\[
\Delta P = 0.003660 \cdot 6.69 \approx 0.02444 \, \text{kPa}
\]

This value is approximately \( 0.0245 \, \text{kPa} \), which matches option E.
