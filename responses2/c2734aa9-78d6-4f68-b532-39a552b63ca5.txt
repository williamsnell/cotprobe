Okay, so I've got this question about Motivational Interviewing (MI), and I need to figure out which of the given options is NOT used when helping a patient resolve ambivalence, build commitment, and reach a decision to change. The options are A to D.

First, I should remember what Motivational Interviewing teaches. I think MI emphasizes building self-efficacy, empathy, and commitment. Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Does not support self-efficacy for change. Wait, I thought MI does support self-efficacy. I remember something about building self-efficacy as a key goal. So if option A says it doesn't support self-efficacy, that's probably not correct. That would mean A is the answer because the question is asking which principle is NOT used.

Option B: Empathy through reflective listening. Reflective listening is a big part of MI. I've heard it's about listening with understanding and empathy. So B is a principle used, so it's not the correct answer.

Option C: Roll with resistance. I remember that rolling with resistance is part of the process. When someone is ambivalent, you let their fear or hesitation go, which builds commitment. So C is used, so it's not the answer.

Option D: Avoid direct confrontation. I think MI encourages open communication to avoid confrontation. So D is used, so it's not the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is asking which is NOT used. So if the correct answer is A, that's the one that's not used. Because MI does support self-efficacy, so A is wrong.

The correct answer is **A: Does not support self-efficacy for change**, as Motivational Interviewing (MI) does support self-efficacy. 

Answer: A
