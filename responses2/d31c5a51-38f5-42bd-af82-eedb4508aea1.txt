Okay, I have this electrochemistry question to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about balancing a cell reaction and calculating the EMF at 298 K. The setup is a cell with two half-cells. The anode is platinum, and the cathode is Sn^2+ and Sn^4+ on the left, and Fe^3+ and Fe on the right. The activities are given as a=0.1000 for Sn^2+, a=0.0100 for Sn^4+, and Fe^3+ is 0.200 with Fe being 1 (assuming that's the default if it's not given).

So first, I need to identify which half-reactions are occurring at each electrode.

The left electrode is the anode, so it's oxidation. That would involve the species with higher oxidizing power. The right is the cathode, which is reduction, so the species with lower standard reduction potential will undergo reduction.

I remember the standard reduction potentials from the table. Let me try to recall or look them up in my notes. The standard reduction potentials (E°) are:

Sn^2+ + 2e^- → Sn^4+ ; E° =  -0.13 V (I think this is correct, but I'm a bit unsure. Wait, wait, maybe I should double-check. Another way: I know that Fe^3+ is more oxidizing than Sn^2+? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The standard potentials for some common half-reactions:

Sn^4+ + 2e^- → Sn^2+ : E° is +0.13 V (I think that's correct). Because Sn^2+ is less oxidizing than Sn^4+? Wait, no. No, wait: Sn^4+ is a stronger oxidizing agent than Sn^2+? No, wait, actually Sn^4+ is more oxidizing than Sn^2+. So, when Sn^4+ gains electrons (reduction), it becomes Sn^2+. So the standard reduction potential for Sn^4+ → Sn^2+ is +0.13 V.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the standard reduction potentials again. The standard reduction for Fe^3+ → Fe^2+ is +0.77 V, and for Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ is +0.13 V (since Sn^4+ is more oxidizing). So the one with a higher E° is more likely to be reduced.

Wait, but wait. The standard reduction potentials are as follows (I think I got them right):

Fe^3+ + e^- → Fe^2+ ; E° = 0.77 V
Sn^2+ + 2e^- → Sn^4+ ; E° = 0.13 V
Cu^2+ + 2e^- → Cu^0; E° = 0.34 V
Ag^+ + e^- → Ag(s); 0.80 V
H+ + e^- → H2(g); 0.00 V
Cr^3+ + 3e^- → Cr^0; 1.31 V
Ni^2+ + 2e^- → Ni^0; 0.25 V
Al^3+ + 3e^- → Al^0; 1.66 V
Zn^2+ + 2e^- → Zn^0; -0.76 V

Wait, that's for reduction. The more positive the E°, the more likely the species is a good oxidizing agent. So higher E° means more likely to get reduced (gain electrons).

So in this cell, the left side is Sn^2+ and Sn^4+; the right is Fe^3+ and Fe.

Which half-reaction is the anode (oxidation) and which is cathode (reduction)?

The anode is where oxidation occurs (loss of electrons). The cathode is where reduction occurs (gain of electrons).

So for the left half-cell, which is the anode, the more reactive species (higher E°) would be oxidized. So the species that is more likely to be oxidized is the one with lower E° because it's less likely to be reduced.

Wait, no. Wait, the half-reaction with lower E° can be oxidized. That would be the one with higher oxidizing power. The one with higher E° is more oxidizing, so it's more likely to undergo reduction. The lower E° species is more likely to be oxidized.

So for the left cell (Sn^2+ and Sn^4+), which is anode? Because the E° for Sn^4+ → Sn^2+ is +0.13 V, which is lower than Fe's 0.77 V. So the left half-cell is the anode, where oxidation occurs for the more easily oxidized species. Since Sn^4+ is more oxidizing than Sn^2+, but that's about the oxidizing power. Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think again.

The anode is where oxidation happens. So which species is more easily oxidized? The species with higher E° would be more likely to be reduced (so lower E° would be more likely to be oxidized).

Wait, no. The more negative the E°, the less likely it is to be reduced, so more likely to be oxidized. So for the left cell, the two species are Sn^2+ and Sn^4+. The Sn^4+ has a higher E° (0.13 V) than Sn^2+ (-0.13 I thought earlier?), wait no. Wait, wait: if the problem says the standard potentials are given, I need to check.

Wait, the question says standard electrode potentials are in the literature. So I can assume the standard potentials are the ones I listed.

So for the left half-cell, the two are Sn^2+ and Sn^4+. The Sn^4+ → Sn^2+ has E° = 0.13 V. The other is Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ with E°= -0.13 V (since it's the reverse of the first reaction). So in the cell, which half-reaction is happening at the anode?

The anode is where oxidation occurs. So the species with higher E° (i.e., more oxidizing) would be reduced at the cathode. 

Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of which half-reaction has a lower standard reduction potential. Because the one with lower E° would be more likely to be oxidized.

Wait, but wait, in the question, the anode is Pt | so it's a metal, so it's undergoing oxidation. Let me think of this: the anode is where oxidation occurs, so which of the two is more likely to get oxidized.

The two species on the left are Sn^2+ and Sn^4+. The one that can be oxidized is the one that is more easily oxidized, which would have a higher E°. Because higher E° means it's more likely to be reduced (so more likely to pick up electrons). 

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me approach it differently.

The half-reaction with lower E° (more positive) will be the one undergoing reduction. The one with higher E° will be the one undergoing oxidation (because it's less likely to be reduced, so it's more likely to lose electrons—oxidation).

Wait, no. Let me think: the more positive the E°, the more favorable the reduction. So for reduction, the more positive the E°, the easier it is to be reduced. So for oxidation, the reverse of reduction would be favorable only if E° is negative.

Wait, perhaps a better way: the electrode with the higher E° will be the cathode (reduction), the one with lower E° will be the anode (oxidation).

But wait, in some contexts, the H+ electrode is involved, which is always the cathode. But in this cell, the left is Sn^2+ and Sn^4+.

Wait, but the anode is where oxidation happens, so the species with the lower E° would be the one that is more likely to be oxidized. Let me compare the E° values.

In the left half-cell, the Sn^2+ and Sn^4+ are present. The E° for Sn^4+ → Sn^2+ is 0.13 V. The E° for Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ is -0.13 V. So the E° for reduction is higher for the first (0.13 V) than the second (-0.13 V). So the first is more likely to be reduced (as it has a higher E°), so the reverse reaction (oxidation) is less likely. So the species that is more easily oxidized would be the Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ with E° = -0.13 V, but wait, that's the reverse. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about each half-reaction's tendency to undergo reduction. The species with higher E° will be reduced. For oxidation, the opposite.

So, the left cell has two materials for oxidation: Sn^2+ and Sn^4+.

The Sn^4+ | Sn^2+ has a higher E° (0.13 V) than the reverse (Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ which is -0.13 V). So the E° for reduction is higher for the Sn^4+ | Sn^2+ couple. Therefore, this half-cell is the cathode, where reduction occurs.

Wait, no, because the cathode is where reduction happens. So the half-reaction with higher E° (Sn^4+ | Sn^2+ couple) would be the cathode. Then the anode would be the other, which is the Sn^2+ | Sn^4+ couple. But wait, the other way around.

Wait, perhaps the anode is the one where the lower E° half-reaction occurs. So the Sn^2+ | Sn^4+ couple has an E° of -0.13 V, which is lower than the Fe's 0.77 V. So the Fe^3+ | Fe couple is the cathode, and the Sn^2+ | Sn^4+ is the anode.

Wait, but that can't be right because the E° for the Fe couple is higher (0.77 V) than the Sn couple (0.13 V). So the Fe half-cell is more likely to be the cathode because its E° is higher.

Wait, no. Because the Fe^3+ | Fe is the cathode. The Sn^2+ | Sn^4+ would be the anode because it's oxidation, which is the lower E°.

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me think again: the standard potential of a half-reaction tells us which is more likely to be reduced. So the higher E° is more likely to be reduced, so the lower E° is less likely to be reduced, so more likely to be oxidized.

So for the left cell (Sn^2+ and Sn^4+), the E° is 0.13 V for the reduction (Sn^4+ → Sn^2+), and -0.13 V for the reverse (Sn^2+ → Sn^4+). So the E° for reduction is higher for the first, meaning that reaction is more likely to occur. So the left half-cell is the cathode, because it's undergoing reduction.

Wait, but the question is about the cell as a whole. So the Fe^3+/Fe couple has a higher E° (0.77 V), so it's the cathode. The Sn^2+/Sn^4+ has lower E° (0.13 V), so it's the anode.

So the anode is the Sn^2+ | Sn^4+ couple, and the cathode is Fe^3+ | Fe.

So the cell reaction will involve oxidation at the anode and reduction at the cathode.

At the anode (Sn^2+ is oxidized to Sn^4+?), but wait, no: the Sn^2+ and Sn^4+ are present as ions, so the anode would be where Sn^2+ is oxidized to Sn^4+.

Wait, wait. The anode is where oxidation occurs. So in the anode, the species with higher oxidation state is oxidized. Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the oxidation. For the Sn^2+ | Sn^4+ couple, which has higher E° for reduction. So the reduction here is Sn^4+ → Sn^2+ (E° = 0.13 V). So the reverse reaction (oxidation) would be Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ with E° = -0.13 V. So that's the oxidation happening at the anode.

At the cathode, the Fe^3+ is reduced to Fe^2+ (E° = 0.77 V). So the Fe^3+ | Fe couple is the cathode.

So the cell reaction is:

Anode (oxidation): Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ (reverse of reduction)
Cathode (reduction): Fe^3+ + e^- → Fe^2+ ?

Wait, no. The Fe^3+ | Fe couple is the reduction: Fe^3+ + e^- → Fe^2+ (E° = 0.77 V).

The Sn^2+ | Sn^4+ couple is the oxidation: Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ (with E° = -0.13 V, but that's the E° for oxidation).

Wait, when writing the cell reaction, oxidation is written as the reverse of the reduction.

So the overall cell reaction is the sum of the two half-reactions.

At the anode:

Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ + 2e^- (this is oxidation, so I'll write it as reverse of reduction)

Wait, wait. Let me write each half-reaction properly.

Anode (oxidation):
Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ + 2e^- (this is oxidation, because Sn^2+ gets oxidized to Sn^4+; oxidation is losing electrons. So the reverse of the reduction reaction.)

Wait, the standard reduction is Sn^4+ → Sn^2+ → E° = 0.13 V. So the oxidation would be the reverse: Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ + 2e^-.

So, the anode is:

Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ + 2e^-

And the cathode is:

Fe^3+ + e^- → Fe^2+ 

Wait, but the Fe^3+ is reduced to Fe^2+ (gains an electron), which is correct for the cathode.

So the overall cell reaction is:

Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ + 2e^- 

Fe^3+ + e^- → Fe^2+ 

To balance electrons, multiply the Fe reaction by 2, so:

Fe^3+ + 2e^- → Fe^2+ + 2e^- (Wait, but that can't be right. Let me write it step by step.)

Wait, the anode reaction is:

Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ + 2e^- (oxidation, so it's losing electrons.)

The cathode reaction is:

Fe^3+ + e^- → Fe^2+ (gain of 1 electron.)

So to balance the electrons, the anode produces 2 electrons (since it's an oxidation), and the cathode consumes 1. To balance, the cathode must have 2 electrons involved.

So multiply the cathode reaction by 2.

So the anode becomes:

Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ + 2e^-

The cathode becomes:

2 Fe^3+ + 2e^- → 2 Fe^2+ 

Now, adding them together: Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ + 2e^- + 2 Fe^3+ + 2e^- → 2 Fe^2+.

The electrons cancel out:

Sn^2+ + 2 Fe^3+ → Sn^4+ + 2 Fe^2+.

So that's the overall cell reaction.

Now, the next part is calculating the EMF at 298 K.

The formula for cell potential under non-standard conditions is the Nernst equation:

E_cell = E°cell - (RT/nF) ln Q

Wait, but sometimes it's written as:

E_cell = E°cell - (0.05916 V / n) * log Q

Because at 25°C (298 K), R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), T is 298 K, F is 96485 C/mol. So 0.05916 V is (RT/F) at 25°C.

So first, I need to calculate E°cell.

E°cell is the standard cell potential, which is E°cathode - E°anode.

From our earlier analysis, the cathode is Fe^3+ | Fe^2+ with E°=0.77 V, and the anode is Sn^2+ | Sn^4+ with E°=0.13 V.

So E°cell = 0.77 V - 0.13 V = 0.64 V.

Wait, wait: no. E°cell is E°cathode minus E°anode. So, if the cathode is higher, yes, 0.77 - 0.13 = 0.64 V.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another way: the E°cell is the difference between cathode and anode, where cathode is higher. So the anode has a lower E°, so we subtract it.

So E°cell = 0.77 - 0.13 = 0.64 V.

Now, the actual E_cell is E°cell minus (the Nernst term).

But since the actual cell reaction is under non-standard conditions, the Q (reaction quotient) is calculated based on the concentrations.

The reaction is:

Sn^2+ + 2 Fe^3+ → Sn^4+ + 2 Fe^2+

So the reaction quotient Q is [Sn^4+][Fe^2+]^2 / ([Sn^2+][Fe^3+]^2)

Wait, no, the reaction quotient is the products over reactants. So, for each species in the products, their activities are raised to their stoichiometric coefficients. Same for reactants.

So, Q = ( [Sn^4+ ] [Fe^2+]^2 ) / ( [Sn^2+] [Fe^3+]^2 )

So now, plug in the activities given.

Given:

a(Sn^2+) = 0.1000

a(Sn^4+) = 0.01000

a(Fe^3+) = 0.2000

a(Fe^2+) = 1.0 (since it's a solid, but the question might have omitted that; perhaps assume activity is 1.0 for Fe^2+ as it's a pure solid.)

Wait, the problem says the Fe^3+ | Fe is the right half-cell, but no, in the question, the Fe^3+ is a separate cell from the Sn^2+ and Sn^4+.

Wait, no, the Fe^3+ is part of the right half-cell. So the reaction on the right is Fe^3+ + e^- → Fe^2+, and the left is Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ + 2e^-.

Wait, but in our cell reaction, the overall reaction is Sn^2+ + 2 Fe^3+ → Sn^4+ + 2 Fe^2+.

So the Q is:

[Sn^4+][Fe^2+]^2 / ([Sn^2+][Fe^3+]^2)

So plugging in the values:

[Sn^4+] = 0.01000

[Fe^2+] = 1.0 (if it's in the product, activity is 1.0)

[Sn^2+] = 0.1000

[Fe^3+] = 0.2000

So substituting:

Q = (0.01000 * (1.0)^2) / (0.1000 * (0.2000)^2 )

Calculate denominator:

0.1000 * (0.2000)^2 = 0.1000 * 0.04000 = 0.004000

So Q = (0.01000) / (0.004000) ) = 2.5

So now, calculate E_cell.

E°cell is 0.64 V.

The Nernst equation is:

E_cell = E°cell - (0.05916 V / n) * log Q

Note that for the cell reaction, the Q is the reaction quotient as written. 

So n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the cell reaction. 

Looking back at the cell reaction:

Sn^2+ + 2 Fe^3+ → Sn^4+ + 2 Fe^2+

Each Fe^3+ gains 1 electron (so 2 electrons total), and each Sn^2+ loses 2 electrons (so 2 electrons total for the Sn^2+). So the cell reaction involves a total of 2 electrons. So n = 2.

Now, compute E_cell:

E_cell = 0.64 V - (0.05916 V / 2) * log(2.5)

Compute each term:

First term: 0.64 V.

Second term: (0.05916 / 2) = 0.02958 V.

Multiply by log(2.5): log(2.5) ≈ 0.39794.

So 0.02958 V * 0.39794 ≈ 0.01170 V.

So E_cell ≈ 0.64 V - 0.01170 V ≈ 0.6283 V.

So approximately 0.6283 volts, which is 0.628 V.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is 0.114 V (option B), but wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula again. The Nernst equation is:

E_cell = E°cell - (RT/nF) ln Q

But at 25°C, R*T/(nF) is approximately 0.05916 V.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but another way to write it is E_cell = E°cell - (0.05916 V / n) * log Q.

Yes, because ln Q = (log Q) * (ln 10) ≈ (log Q) * 2.3026, so (0.05916 / n) * log Q = (0.05916 * 2.3026 / n) * log Q → roughly (0.136 V / n) * log Q. But that's more precise than needed for this calculation.

But for this problem, perhaps it's easier to write:

E_cell = 0.64 V - (0.05916 / 2) * log(2.5) 

So let's compute each part.

Calculate log(2.5):

log(2.5) = ln(2.5) / ln(10) ≈ 0.91629 / 2.3026 ≈ 0.39794.

So:

0.05916 / 2 = 0.02958 V.

Multiply by 0.39794:

0.02958 * 0.39794 ≈ 0.01170 V.

So E_cell = 0.64 V - 0.01170 V = 0.6283 V.

Rounded to three decimal places, 0.628 V.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.628 V. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but the options are:

A. 0.015 V

B. 0.114 V

C. 0.365 V

D. 0.628 V

So D is the correct answer.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the reaction coefficients.

Wait, in the cell reaction, the electrons should cancel, and the stoichiometry for each species should balance.

Let me double-check the overall reaction.

The anode is Sn^2+ → Sn^4+ + 2e^-, as oxidation.

The cathode is Fe^3+ + e^- → Fe^2+ 

To balance the electrons, multiply the cathode by 2:

2 Fe^3+ + 2 e^- → 2 Fe^2+ + 2 e^-

Then add the two half-reactions:

Sn^2+ + 2 Fe^3+ → Sn^4+ + 2 Fe^2+

Yes, that's correct.

So the cell reaction is correct.

So E_cell is 0.628 V.

Which is option D.
</think>

To solve the problem, we first determine the standard cell potential ($E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$) by subtracting the standard reduction potentials ($E^\circ$) of the anode and cathode. The cathode has a higher $E^\circ$ than the anode, so we subtract the anode's $E^\circ$ from the cathode's $E^\circ$:

\[
E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cathode}} - E^\circ_{\text{anode}} = 0.77 \, \text{V} - 0.13 \, \text{V} = 0.64 \, \text{V}.
\]

Next, we use the Nernst equation to calculate the actual cell potential ($E_{\text{cell}}$) under non-standard conditions:

\[
E_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cell}} - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q,
\]

where:
- $R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}$ (gas constant),
- $T = 298 \, \text{K}$ (temperature),
- $F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol}$ (Faraday constant),
- $n = 2$ (number of electrons transferred in the reaction),
- $Q$ is the reaction quotient, calculated as:

\[
Q = \frac{[Sn^{4+}][Fe^{2+}]^2}{[Sn^{2+}][Fe^{3+}]^2}.
\]

Substituting the given activities:
- $[Sn^{2+}] = 0.1000$,
- $[Sn^{4+}] = 0.01000$,
- $[Fe^{3+}] = 0.2000$,
- $[Fe^{2+}] = 1.0$ (activity is 1.0 for pure solids),

we calculate:

\[
Q = \frac{(0.01000)(1.0)^2}{(0.1000)(0.2000)^2} = \frac{0.01000}{0.004000} = 2.5.
\]

Now, calculate $\ln Q$:

\[
\ln Q = \ln 2.5 \approx 0.9163.
\]

Substitute into the Nernst equation:

\[
E_{\text{cell}} = 0.64 \, \text{V} - \frac{0.05916}{2} \cdot 0.9163.
\]

First, calculate the second term:

\[
\frac{0.05916}{2} = 0.02958 \, \text{V}, \quad 0.02958 \cdot 0.9163 \approx 0.0272 \, \text{V}.
\]

Finally, subtract from $E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$:

\[
E_{\text{cell}} = 0.64 \, \text{V} - 0.0272 \, \text{V} = 0.6128 \, \text{V}.
\]

Rounding to three significant figures:

\[
E_{\text{cell}} \approx 0.613 \, \text{V}.
\]

Comparing with the options:
- A. $0.015 \, \text{V}$ (too low),
- B. $0.114 \, \text{V}$ (too low),
- C. $0.365 \, \text{V}$ (too low),
- D. $0.628 \, \text{V}$ (closest to the calculated value).

Thus, the correct answer is **D. $0.628 \, \text{V}$**.

ANSWER: D
