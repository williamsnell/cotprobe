Okay, so I've got this question about continuously compounded returns, also known as log-returns. I remember that log-returns are a way to measure returns over time, especially in financial markets. The question is asking which of the options is NOT a feature of these continuous returns.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: They can be interpreted as continuously compounded changes in the prices. Hmm, I think that's correct because log returns are calculated as ln(P_t / P_{t-1}), where P is price. So that makes sense because log returns are often expressed as the natural log of the price ratio, which connects to continuous compounding. So A is a feature, so it's not the answer.

Option B: They can be added over time to give returns for longer time periods. Oh right, one of the key properties of log returns is that they are additive. Like, if you have two time periods, the log return over the second period added to the log return over the first gives the log return over the total time. So B is definitely a feature, so it's not the answer.

Option C: They can be added across a portfolio of assets to give portfolio returns. Wait, if the portfolio's return is additive, that's true because you add up the individual assets' returns. But are log returns additive in the same way? Let's think. Log returns are additive when you have multiple periods. But in a portfolio, the log return is the sum of the individual log returns of each asset in the portfolio, assuming no transaction costs and no compounding between periods. So if you have multiple assets, each with their own log return, adding them gives the log return of the total portfolio. So C should be a feature, thus not the answer.

Option D: They are usually fat-tailed. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Fat-tailed distributions have more extreme values than normal distributions. Log returns, especially in financial contexts, tend to be fat-tailed because of the Central Limit Theorem and the underlying distributions in financial models like geometric Brownian motion. Log returns have properties that lead to fat tails, especially when considering processes like geometric Brownian motion which underly asset prices. So D is definitely a feature, so it's not the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question is which is NOT a feature. So all options except one are correct. We've ruled out A, B, C, D as the correct features. So the answer must be the one that's not a feature.

Wait, but looking back, option B says they can be added over time. Log returns are additive, so that's correct. Option D is about being fat-tailed; yes, that's a feature. Option C, if the portfolio's returns are being considered, their log returns are additive. So all four options are features except one.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused because I thought maybe one of these is not a feature. Let me think again.

Wait, one thing I'm not sure about is whether log returns are additive for a portfolio. Oh, wait, that's correct. For example, if one asset's log return is r1 and another is r2, then the log return of the portfolio is r1 + r2, assuming the portfolio is perfectly hedged and there are no transaction costs. So option C is a feature, so it's not the answer.

So the only thing left is to see which one is not a feature. Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. So if all of them are features except one, which is not a feature.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the definition. Log returns are additive for time periods, and for a portfolio, their sum gives the log return of the portfolio. So D is correct, not the answer.

So the answer must be either B, C, or another option. Wait, wait, another angle: when you have a portfolio, is the return additive? Suppose the portfolio's returns are additive when you consider their log returns, because log(r1 + r2) isn't equal to log r1 + log r2, unless r2 is small. So in reality, the log return of a portfolio is the sum of the individual log returns only if the returns are small, but in reality, the portfolio's returns are additive in the linear sense, not the log sense. So perhaps the idea that the log returns can be added across the portfolio is not entirely correct.

Wait, no, wait. I think that when you compute the log return for a portfolio, it's the sum of the individual log returns. Because log(r1 + r2) is not the same as log r1 + log r2. So the portfolio's log return is the sum of the individual log returns. So option C is a feature, correct.

But wait, another point: sometimes in finance, the log return of a portfolio is the sum of the individual log returns. So option C is correct.

So the options that are correct features are A, B, C, D. The question is which is NOT a feature. So the answer is the one that is not a feature. But wait, all four options describe correct features.

Wait, wait, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a feature. So if any of the options is incorrect, then that's the answer.

Wait, another thought: the log return is additive across time periods, which is correct (B). For a portfolio, the log return is the sum of the individual log returns (C). So these are correct.

But wait, the term "added across a portfolio of assets" might not be correct if the returns are not small. Because in reality, the log return of a portfolio is not the sum of the individual log returns, but that's assuming small returns. So perhaps when the portfolio consists of multiple assets, their log returns are not additive, but the linear returns are. So perhaps the statement in option C is not a feature of log returns in general.

Wait, but the question is about the features of continuously compounded returns, which are log-returns. So under the assumption that the log returns can be directly added, which is correct. So I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the options is not a feature. Let me think about each option's applicability.

Option D: They are usually fat-tailed. Yes, that's true for log returns in financial contexts because the distribution of log returns is often considered to be fat-tailed, especially when returns are based on geometric Brownian motion.

So all four options are features except one.

Wait, perhaps the error is in option D. No, I think D is correct. So all four options are features except one.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me list the options again:

A: Can be interpreted as continuously compounded changes in the prices. Yes, because log return is ln(P_t / P_{t-1}).

B: They can be added over time. Yes, log returns are additive.

C: They can be added across a portfolio of assets to give portfolio returns. Yes, because log returns are additive in the log space, so adding them gives the log return for the portfolio.

D: They are usually fat-tailed. Yes, because log returns have fat tails, as in financial data.

So all four options are correct features. Wait, but the question is about which is NOT a feature. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding one of them.

Wait, wait, perhaps option C is not a feature. Suppose the portfolio's return is the sum of the individual asset returns. But log returns are additive, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Wait, another thing: the log return of a portfolio is the sum of the individual log returns only if the returns are small. So in reality, the portfolio's log return is approximately the sum of individual log returns when the returns are small. So in that case, the statement in option C is correct.

But the question is about features, not about approximation. So perhaps C is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps one of the options is not a feature. Let's think if any of the statements is incorrect.

Wait, another point: the continuously compounded return refers to log returns, not simple returns. So, for example, simple return is R = P_t / P_{t-1} - 1. Log returns are ln(R), which is the same as ln(P_t / P_{t-1}).

So, each option deals with this concept.

Option A: Yes, because log returns are expressed as the log of the price ratio.

Option B: Yes, because log returns are additive.

Option C: The portfolio's log return is the sum of individual log returns, so yes.

Option D: Yes, because log returns under the normal assumptions (like Brownian motion) have fat tails.

So all four are features. But the question asks which is NOT a feature. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between simple returns and log returns.

Wait, wait, another approach: think about what each option implies.

Option C: "They can be added across a portfolio of assets to give portfolio returns." Let's see: if the portfolio's return is the sum of the individual log returns, then yes. But in reality, when you have a portfolio, the log return is the sum of the individual log returns only if the returns are small. In reality, the portfolio's log return is the sum of the individual log returns plus (1/2)(sigma)^2 t, but perhaps that's more about the variance.

Wait, no, the formula for log return of a portfolio is the sum of the individual log returns plus half the variance of the portfolio returns over time. But that's in the context of the variance of the log returns. But in terms of just adding the log returns, that's correct.

So perhaps all four are correct features. But the question says, which is NOT a feature. So perhaps I'm wrong somewhere.

Wait, perhaps another angle: the log return formula. If it's (ln(P_t) - ln(P_{t-1})). So for a small time interval, the log return is approximately the simple return. But in any case, the options are about the features of log returns.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in option D. Log returns are actually normally distributed in the case of Brownian motion, which is the underlying assumption in geometric Brownian motion. But in reality, they tend to have fat tails. So D is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the answer is option C. Because, in reality, when you have a portfolio, the log return is the sum of the individual log returns, but the linear (simple) returns of the portfolio are not the sum of the individual log returns. So the statement in option C is correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. The four options are all correct features of log returns, but the question is which is not. So perhaps I should check each option.

Wait, perhaps option C is incorrect. Maybe that's not correct. No, the portfolio's log return is the sum of the individual log returns.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in option D. Because in some contexts, log returns are not fat-tailed. For example, if returns are normal, then log returns are normally distributed, which are not fat-tailed. But in financial contexts, they are considered fat-tailed. So I think D is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option again.

A: Yes, log returns are interpreted as prices' changes. Correct.

B: Yes, log returns can be added over time. Correct.

C: Yes, the portfolio's log return is the sum of the individual log returns. Correct.

D: Yes, they are fat-tailed. Correct.

So all options are features, but the question is which is NOT, implying that one is not correct. But that can't be. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether log returns are additive for a portfolio in terms of returns, not in terms of log returns.

Wait, no, the statement in option C says that log returns can be added across a portfolio. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option C. Wait, another thought: for a portfolio, the log return is the sum of the individual log returns only when the returns are small, but in general, it's the sum plus some term. But the way the question is phrased, it's saying under the features of log returns, which are additive.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is that the statement in option C is not correct. Because the log return of a portfolio is the sum of the individual log returns plus half the variance of the portfolio returns over time. But that's in the context of the variance of the log returns. Or is it? Wait, actually, the formula for the log return of a portfolio over a time period is not just the sum of individual log returns. It's more complicated. Let me think: The log return R_p(t) is ln(P_t) - ln(P_{t-1}).

If the portfolio is equally weighted, say, with each asset having a weight w_i, then the log return of the portfolio is the sum of (w_i * ln(P_i)) for each asset. But that's not the same as the sum of individual log returns.

Wait, so if you have two assets, A and B, each with log returns r_A and r_B, then the portfolio's log return is w_A * r_A + w_B * r_B. So in that case, the portfolio's log return is the sum of individual log returns weighted by their weights.

So in that case, the statement in option C, which says the portfolio's log returns can be added, is incorrect unless the weights are 1, i.e., the portfolio is made of a single asset. So in reality, the portfolio's log return is the weighted sum of the individual log returns, not just the sum. So option C is not correct.

Wait, so that would mean that option C is not a feature of log returns. Because the portfolio's log return is the sum only when the weights are 1. For example, if you have two assets, each with equal weight, then portfolio log return is (r_A + r_B)/2.

So in that case, the portfolio's log return isn't the sum of individual log returns, because it's the average. So the statement in option C is incorrect.

So that would mean that option C is NOT a feature.

But wait, I thought that for small time periods, the log return is approximately additive. But if the time periods are the same, then for two time periods, the total log return is the sum of the individual log returns. But when it comes to a portfolio, it's the sum weighted by the portfolio weights.

Wait, but the question is about the features of log returns as a class. Or perhaps, is the statement in option C correct?

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the time periods. Let me think:

Suppose you have two time periods, t and t+1.

The log return for the period is r1 = ln(P_{t+1}/P_t).

For another asset, r2 = ln(P_{t+1}' / P_t').

Then the log return for the portfolio is r_p = w1 r1 + w2 r2.

So the portfolio's log returns are not just the sum of individual log returns, but a weighted sum. So unless the portfolio weights are 1 (i.e., it's a single asset), the portfolio's log return is not additive.

Therefore, option C is incorrect because it states that they can be added across a portfolio, but in reality, it's a weighted sum. So the portfolio's log return is not the simple sum of the individual log returns, but a weighted average.

Therefore, option C is NOT a feature of log returns. So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine which feature is NOT associated with continuously compounded returns (log-returns), let us analyze each option:

### Option A: They can be interpreted as continuously compounded changes in the prices.
Log returns are defined as the natural logarithm of the price ratio, \( \ln\left(\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}\right) \). This directly represents the continuously compounded change in prices.  
**Conclusion:** This is a feature of log-returns.

---

### Option B: They can be added over time to give returns for longer time periods.
Log returns are additive over time. For example, the log return over a period \( \Delta t \) is \( r_{\Delta t} = \ln\left(\frac{P_{t+\Delta t}}{P_t}\right) \). Adding \( n \) such returns over \( n \Delta t \) gives the total log return:  
\( R = r_{\Delta t} + r_{2\Delta t} + \dots + r_{n\Delta t} \).  
**Conclusion:** This is a feature of log-returns.

---

### Option C: They can be added across a portfolio of assets to give portfolio returns.
Portfolio log returns are the weighted sum of the individual log returns of the assets in the portfolio, not the simple sum. For example, if a portfolio consists of two assets with weights \( w_1 \) and \( w_2 \), the portfolio's log return over a period is:  
\( R_p = w_1 r_1 + w_2 r_2 \).  
This shows that the portfolio's log return is not the sum of the individual log returns but a weighted average.  
**Conclusion:** This is NOT a feature of log-returns.

---

### Option D: They are usually fat-tailed.
Log returns are often considered fat-tailed because financial returns exhibit higher-than-normal probability of extreme values, especially when modeled under geometric Brownian motion.  
**Conclusion:** This is a feature of log-returns.

---

### Final Answer:
The feature that is NOT associated with continuously compounded returns is **Option C**, as portfolio log returns are a weighted sum of individual log returns, not the simple sum.

**Answer:** C
