Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the measure of AB in triangle ABC. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The problem says: In triangle ABC, AB is equal to 9x minus 1, CB is 5x minus 0.5, and AC is 4x plus 1. Also, it's given that AC equals CB. I need to find the measure of AB, and the options are A through J, with various numerical values.

Hmm, wait, so AC equals CB. That must mean that the lengths of AC and CB are the same. So I can set up an equation where 4x + 1 equals 5x - 0.5 because those are the expressions for AC and CB respectively. Let me write that down:

AC = CB
4x + 1 = 5x - 0.5

Now, I need to solve for x. Let me subtract 4x from both sides to get the x terms on one side:

4x +1 -4x = 5x - 0.5 -4x
Which simplifies to:
1 = x - 0.5

Then, I'll add 0.5 to both sides to solve for x:
1 + 0.5 = x
So, x equals 1.5 or 3/2.

Now that I have x, I can plug this value back into the expression for AB because the question is asking for AB. The expression given is AB = 9x -1.

Calculating AB:
AB = 9*(1.5) -1
First, 9 multiplied by 1.5 is 13.5. Then subtract 1:
13.5 - 1 = 12.5

Looking at the options, B is 12.5. So I think the answer is B.

Wait a second, did I do everything right? Let me check the steps again.

1. Set AC = CB: 4x +1 =5x -0.5
2. Subtract 4x: 1 = x -0.5
3. Add 0.5: x=1.5
4. AB is 9x -1: 9*(1.5)=13.5, 13.5-1=12.5. Yes, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So the correct answer should be B, 12.5.

The measure of AB is 12.5. 

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Set AC = CB: 4x +1 =5x -0.5
2. Solve for x: x=1.5
3. Substitute x into AB: AB=9*(1.5)-1=13.5-1=12.5

Answer: B
