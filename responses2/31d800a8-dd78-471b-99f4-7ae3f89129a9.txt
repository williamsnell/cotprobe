Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about standardized assessments. Let me think through it step by step. The question is asking about the first standardized measure of assessment. The options are A through J.

First, I'll try to recall what each of these tests is. I remember that the Wechsler Scale is a series of tests for assessing intelligence, and the first one was probably the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, which is option B. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me go through each option.

Option A is the Thematic Apperception Test. I think that's used for personality assessments, maybe for child intelligence or something like that. So probably not the first measure.

Option B is Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. That rings a bell as the first standardized intelligence test. It was developed in the 1940s by Jacob Wechsler. So that's the first one.

Option C is Stanford Binet. I believe that's the first test in the Binet scale, which was developed earlier, around the 1900s. So it's probably not the first overall.

Option D is Holtzman Inkblot Test. That's a visual-spatial test, used for measuring problem-solving and attention spans. I don't think it's the first.

Option E is Raven’s Progressive Matrices. I remember that's a non-verbal test used for assessing abstract reasoning and intelligence. So it's a later test compared to the Wechsler scale.

Option F is Binet–Simon Scale. That's actually the first standardized test for measuring intelligence, but wait, is it the first overall or just the first in a series? I think the Wechsler scale came out before the Binet scale. So maybe the Wechsler was the first.

Option G is Rorschach Inkblot Test. That's a famous psychological test that assesses creativity and intelligence. I don't think it's the first.

Option H is the Minnesota Clerical Test. That's a specific test from Minnesota that assesses practical skills and knowledge. It's not a measure of intelligence but rather of job readiness.

Option I is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. That's a personality test, not an intelligence measure, so it's not the first.

Option J is Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities. That's a comprehensive set of tests covering various cognitive skills. It's likely later than the Wechsler scale.

Putting it all together, the first standardized measure of intelligence assessment is the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. So the correct answer is B.
