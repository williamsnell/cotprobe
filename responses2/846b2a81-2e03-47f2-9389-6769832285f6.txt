Question:

In a certain country, a person must be at least 16 years old to drive a car and must be at least 18 years old to vote. The variable age represents the age of a person as an integer. Which of the following expressions evaluates to true if the person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote, and evaluates to false otherwise?
 I. (age ≥ 16) AND (age ≤ 18)
 II. (age ≥ 16) AND (NOT(age ≥ 18))
 III. (age < 18) AND (NOT(age < 16))

Options:

A: II only
B: I and II only
C: I and III only
D: II and III only

Alright, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about determining which of the given expressions evaluates to true or false based on a person's age. The conditions are that they must be at least 16 to drive and 18 to vote. The variable age is an integer, so it's a discrete value.

The goal is to find the correct expressions that correctly represent the condition where someone is old enough to drive but not to vote. So, the person's age must satisfy both conditions:

1. Age >= 16 (to drive)
2. Age < 18 (so they aren't old enough to vote)

Wait, but wait, I need to make sure. Let me think again. Because if someone is 17, for example, they can drive (17 >=16) and can vote (17 <18 is true). So, the person can drive and vote. But if someone is 16, they drive but not vote (16 <18 is true). So the condition is that age is >=16 and <18.

Looking at the options:

Option I: (age >=16) AND (age <=18). So, age has to be at least 16 and at most 18. But wait, if age is 17, it's true, but if age is 18, it's also true. But wait, the person must not be old enough to vote, so age must be less than 18. So option I includes age <=18, which includes 18. But the condition is that they are not old enough to vote, meaning age has to be less than 18. So option I would be true for ages 16,17,18. But the correct condition is that they are at least 16 and less than 18. So option I includes 18, which is invalid. So I's condition is not correct.

Option II: (age >=16) AND (NOT (age >=18)). So that's age >=16 and age <18. Which is exactly what we need. So II seems correct.

Option III: (age <18) AND (NOT (age <16)). Let me parse this. NOT (age <16) is the same as age >=16. So this becomes (age <18) AND (age >=16). So that's age between 16 and 17, inclusive. Wait, because age <18 is up to 17. So for example, age 16: True. Age 17: True. Age 18: age <18 is False, so overall false. So this expression would be true for 16,17, not 18. But the correct condition is 16-17. So III is also correct, but wait, no. Because if someone is 16, then condition is true. If 17, also true. If 18, false. But the correct condition is that the person must be >=16 and <18. So III would include 16,17, but not 18. So III is correct in that sense. 

Wait, but let me re-examine. The condition is that the person is old enough to drive but not to vote. So that's 16 <= age <18. So age >=16 and age <18.

So let's look at each option:

Option I: age >=16 and age <=18. So when age is 18, it's true, but that's not allowed because they can't vote. So I's condition includes 18, which is incorrect. So I is wrong.

Option II: age >=16 and (age <18). That's exactly the condition we need. So II is correct.

Option III: (age <18) and (NOT (age <16)). The NOT (age <16) is age >=16. So this is (age <18) and (age >=16) → which is 16<= age <18. So III is correct as well.

Wait, but wait. So both II and III are correct? Let me recheck.

Wait, for III: (age <18) AND (NOT (age <16)) → which is same as (age <18) AND (age >=16). So for example, age 16 → true. Age 17 → true. Age 18 → age <18 is false, so overall false. So yes, III is correct.

Wait, but then both II and III are correct? So looking at the options:

The options are:

A: II only → no, III is correct.

B: I and II only → I is incorrect.

C: I and III only → I incorrect.

D: II and III only → both correct.

Wait, but the options are about which expressions are correct. So if II and III are correct, then the correct answer would be option D (II and III only).

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure. So the condition is that age is >=16 and <18. 

So, II is (age >=16) AND (age <18) → correct.

III is (age <18) AND (NOT (age <16)).

NOT (age <16) is age >=16, so III is (age <18) AND (age >=16) → which is same as 16<=age <18 → correct.

So both II and III satisfy the condition. So the correct expressions are II and III, which is option D.
</think>

The correct expressions are II and III only because they both satisfy the condition of being at least 16 to drive and not at least 18 to vote (i.e., age must be between 16 and 17 inclusive).
