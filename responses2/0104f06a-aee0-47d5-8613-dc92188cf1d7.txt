Alright, so I've got this physics problem about the Lyman series of hydrogen and the energy levels of an electron. Hmm, okay, I remember that the Lyman series is about electron transitions to the first energy level, which is n=1. So the emitted photon comes from higher energy levels to n=1.

The question gives the wavelength as 1.03e-7 meters. Oh wait, that's 103 nanometers. Right, I think Lyman series is for transitions where the electron drops from n=2,3,4,... to n=1. The formula for energy levels in hydrogen is E_n = -13.6 eV / n². But wait, the wavelength is given, so maybe I should calculate using the energy.

The formula connecting energy and wavelength is E = hc / λ, where h is Planck's constant, c speed of light, and λ wavelength. Oh, but the energy levels are in eV, so I need to convert the wavelength into the correct units.

Wait, let me get the constants right. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is 3e8 m/s. But when working with eV and meters, it's often easier to use E in eV and λ in meters. Oh, wait, the formula E = (1240 eV·nm) / λ, where λ is in nm. Because 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so hc in these units is 1240 eV·nm. Yeah, that makes it easier.

So the wavelength here is 1.03e-7 meters. Let me convert that into nanometers. 1.03e-7 m is 103e-9 m, which is 103 nm. So plugging into the formula: E = 1240 / 103 ≈ 12.03 eV. 

Wait, no. I think I misplaced the decimal. Wait, 1240 divided by 103 is about 12.03 eV. But wait, the energy levels are negative. Oh, so the energy of the photon is 12.03 eV? Or wait, the energy difference is E = 1240 / λ. But wait, in which direction? Because the electron is transitioning to a lower energy level, so the emitted photon's energy is the difference between higher and lower levels.

Wait, but the question is about the original energy level of the electron. Hmm. Oh wait, no. The question says, "the original energy level of the electron." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because the electron starts in a higher energy level and drops to n=1. So the original energy level is higher, which is n=2 would be the next level up. So perhaps the question is asking for the principal quantum number n that the electron transitions from.

Wait, let's see. The energy levels are E_n = -13.6 / n² eV. The energy of the photon is E_photon = E_initial - E_final. Since the electron is moving from higher n to n=1, E_final is -13.6 eV. So E_photon = E_initial - (-13.6) = E_initial +13.6. So the energy of the photon equals (13.6 + E_initial) eV.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave E_photon ≈ 12.03 eV. So 13.6 + E_initial = 12.03? That would give E_initial ≈ -1.57 eV, which doesn't make sense because E_initial should be negative. Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate. The wavelength is 1.03e-7 m, so λ = 1.03e-7 m. Convert to nanometers: 1.03e-7 m = 103e-9 m = 103 nm. So E_photon = 1240 / 103 ≈ 12.03 eV (since 1240 is in eV·nm, and 103 is nm).

But wait, 12.03 eV is the energy of the photon. Since the electron is transitioning from n=2 to n=1, the energy of the photon should be E_photon = E_initial - E_final. E_final is -13.6 eV. So:

E_photon = E_initial - (-13.6) => E_photon = E_initial +13.6.

So E_initial = E_photon -13.6 eV.

E_photon is 12.03 eV. So E_initial = 12.03 -13.6 = -1.57 eV. That's negative, which doesn't make sense because E_n is negative. Hmm, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait a second, perhaps I should have used the formula E_photon = (1240 / λ) eV. Wait, 1240 is in eV·nm, so 1.03e-7 m is 103 nm. 1240 / 103 is approximately 12.03 eV. So that's correct.

Wait, but then the initial energy E_initial would be E_initial = E_photon +13.6. Because E_photon = E_initial - E_final => E_initial = E_photon + E_final. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, E_final is -13.6 eV (since n=1). So E_photon = E_initial - E_final.

Rearranged, E_initial = E_photon + E_final.

Wait, no, E_photon = E_initial - E_final => E_initial = E_photon + E_final.

Wait, plugging in, E_initial = 12.03 eV + (-13.6 eV) = -1.57 eV. That's negative, but E_initial would be negative. But that would mean that the electron is in a lower energy level than n=1. But since it's transitioning to n=1, that's impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that E_photon is the energy difference between the initial state and the final state. So E_photon = E_i - E_f.

E_i is the initial energy level (n= whatever, higher than 1), and E_f is -13.6 eV.

So E_photon = E_i +13.6 eV.

Wait, that makes E_i = E_photon -13.6 eV.

E_photon is 12.03 eV, so E_i = 12.03 -13.6 = -1.57 eV. But that can't be right because E_i can't be negative. That suggests a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for the transition. The energy of the photon is E_photon = (13.6)(1 - 1/n²) eV, where n is the final energy level. Since n is 1, that gives 13.6 eV. But wait, no, that's not correct because E_photon is the energy difference. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the Rydberg formula or the formula for wavelengths in the Lyman series.

Wait, another approach: The Rydberg formula for hydrogen is 1/λ = R (1/n1² - 1/n2²), where n1 is 1 (for the Lyman series), and n2 is the higher level. So when the electron drops from n2 to n1, the wavelength is given by 1/λ = R (1 - 1/n2²).

The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e7 m⁻¹. Let's plug in the numbers. Here, λ is 1.03e-7 m, so 1/λ is approximately 970873.8 m⁻¹.

So 970873.8 = 1.097e7 (1 - 1/n2²)

Divide both sides by 1.097e7: 970873.8 / 1.097e7 = 1 - 1/n2².

Calculate that: 970873.8 / 1097000 ≈ 0.8875.

So 0.8875 = 1 - 1/n2² => 1/n2² = 1 - 0.8875 = 0.1125.

So n2² = 1/0.1125 ≈ 8.888. Hmm, so n2 would be approximately sqrt(8.888) ≈ 2.98, which is about 3.

Wait, but n has to be an integer. So n2 is approximately 3.

Wait, but wait, the formula is 1/λ = R (1 - 1/n2²). So 1.03e-7 m is λ, so 1/λ is about 9.7e7 m⁻¹, which is correct. So 9.7e7 = (1.097e7)(1 - 1/n2²) → 1 - 1/n2² = 9.7e7 / 1.097e7 ≈ 8.88.

Wait, 1 - 1/n2² = 8.88 → 1/n2² = 1 - 8.88 → negative. That can't be right. Wait, something's wrong here.

Wait, no. 1/λ = R (1 - 1/n2²) → 1/n2² = 1 - (1/λ R). Oh wait, no, 1/λ = R (1 - 1/n2²) → 1 - 1/n2² = 1/λ R.

Wait, no, 1/lambda = R (1 - 1/n2^2). So 1/lambda is equal to R multiplied by (1 - 1/n2²).

So 1/lambda = R (1 - 1/n2²)

So 1 - 1/n2² = 1/lambda R.

So with lambda = 1.03e-7 m, R is approximately 1.097e7 m⁻¹.

So 1/lambda R = (1/(1.03e-7)) * 1.097e7 → let's compute this.

1/(1.03e-7) is approximately 9.7087e6 m⁻¹.

Multiply by 1.097e7 → (9.7087e6) * (1.097e7) = 1.065e14 m⁻¹.

So 1 - 1/n2² ≈ 1.065e14 m⁻¹.

Wait, that's way bigger than 1, which can't be, because 1 - 1/n² can't be more than 1. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the Rydberg formula should be 1/lambda = R (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2), where n1=1.

But wait, I think the Rydberg formula is 1/lambda = R (1/(n1^2) - 1/(n2^2)) ), but for n1=1 and n2>1, it's 1/lambda = R (1 - 1/n2^2).

Wait, but when I plug in the numbers, 1/lambda = 1.097e7 m⁻¹ * (1 - 1/(n2^2)).

So 1/lambda R = 9.7087e6 m⁻¹ * (1 - 1/(n2²)).

Wait, but that calculation gave 1.065e14 m⁻¹, which is way bigger than 1. That can't be possible. There's a mistake here. Oh, because lambda is 1.03e-7 meters. So 1/lambda is approximately 9.7e7 m⁻¹. But 1/lambda R would be 9.7e7 * 1.097e7.

Wait, 9.7e7 * 1.097e7 = 1.065e15 m⁻¹. But that's way larger than 1, which would make 1 - 1/n² = 1.065e15. But 1 - 1/n² can't be that big. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the Rydberg formula is 1/lambda = R*(1/(n1²) - 1/(n2²)). So for the Lyman series, n1=1, and n2 is 2,3,4,...

So 1/lambda = R (1 - 1/n2^2 )

So 1/lambda = 1.097e7 (1 - 1/n2^2 )

So solving for (1 - 1/n2^2 ) = 1/lambda / R = (1/(1.03e-7)) / 1.097e7.

Wait, 1/(1.03e-7) is approximately 9.7087e6 m⁻¹.

Divide that by 1.097e7 m⁻¹: 9.7087e6 / 1.097e7 ≈ 0.8878.

So 1 - 1/n2² = 0.8878 → 1/n2² = 1 - 0.8878 = 0.1122 → n2² = 1/0.1122 ≈ 8.91 → n2 ≈ 2.98, which is approximately 3.

So n2 is 3. So the original energy level is n=3.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking for the original energy level of the electron. So the electron was in n=3, and it transitioned to n=1.

So n=3 is the original level. So looking at the options, which is option I (5?) No, the options are A:1, B:8,..., I:5, J:3.

Wait, the options are:

A:1

B:8

C:6

D:4

E:2

F:10

G:7

H:9

I:5

J:3

So the correct n is 3, which is option J.

Wait, but wait, the options in the original question are labeled A to J, so the options are:

A:1

B:8

C:6

D:4

E:2

F:10

G:7

H:9

I:5

J:3

So the correct answer is J:3.

Wait, but wait another moment. Earlier I thought the energy of the photon was 12.03 eV, but the energy difference between n=3 and n=1 is E_initial - E_final = E_photon.

E_initial = E_3 = -13.6 / 3² = -13.6/9 ≈ -1.511 eV.

E_final = -13.6 eV.

So the energy difference is (-1.511) - (-13.6) = 12.089 eV. Which is about 12.09 eV, matching the 12.03 eV I calculated earlier. So that all fits.

Therefore, the electron was originally in level n=3, which is option J.

To solve the problem, we use the relationship between the wavelength of the photon emitted during electron transitions in the Lyman series of hydrogen and the energy levels of the electron. The Lyman series corresponds to transitions where the electron moves from a higher energy level \( n = 2, 3, 4, \dots \) to the first energy level \( n = 1 \). The wavelength of the photon is given as \( \lambda = 1.03 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), which is converted to nanometers as \( \lambda = 103 \, \text{nm} \).

The energy of the photon is related to the wavelength by the formula:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{1240 \, \text{eV·nm}}{\lambda}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda = 103 \, \text{nm} \):

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{1240}{103} \approx 12.03 \, \text{eV}
\]

For the Lyman series, the energy of the photon is also given by:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = E_{\text{initial}} - E_{\text{final}}
\]

Here, \( E_{\text{final}} \) corresponds to the energy of the electron in the first energy level (\( n = 1 \)), which is \( E_{\text{final}} = -13.6 \, \text{eV} \). Thus:

\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{photon}} + E_{\text{final}}
\]

Substituting \( E_{\text{photon}} = 12.03 \, \text{eV} \) and \( E_{\text{final}} = -13.6 \, \text{eV} \):

\[
E_{\text{initial}} = 12.03 - 13.6 = -1.57 \, \text{eV}
\]

The energy levels of hydrogen are given by:

\[
E_n = -\frac{13.6}{n^2} \, \text{eV}
\]

For \( E_{\text{initial}} = -1.57 \, \text{eV} \), we solve for \( n \):

\[
-1.57 = -\frac{13.6}{n^2} \implies n^2 = \frac{13.6}{1.57} \approx 8.77 \implies n \approx \sqrt{8.77} \approx 2.98
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, the closest value is \( n = 3 \). Therefore, the original energy level of the electron is \( n = 3 \).

The options provided are:

\[
\begin{array}{lllll}
\text{A: 1} & \text{B: 8} & \text{C: 6} & \text{D: 4} & \text{E: 2} \\
\text{F: 10} & \text{G: 7} & \text{H: 9} & \text{I: 5} & \text{J: 3} \\
\end{array}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **J: 3**.
