Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about auction rules. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about what rule applies when a bidder retracts his bid during an auction, especially in the context of Cross & Black's assets being sold to Fernandez. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I need to understand each option. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: "Such a sale is without reserve unless the goods are explicitly put up with reserve." Hmm, I think this is talking about reserve prices in auctions. A reserve price is when the seller sets a minimum price, and if the highest bid falls below that, the item's sold at the reserve. So, if the item is on reserve, the seller doesn't have to withdraw it unless there's a specific reason. But the question is about retraction of a bid, which is about the bidders when they change their bids, not necessarily the reserve price. So maybe A isn't the correct answer.

Option B: "A bidder may retract his bid at any time until the falling of the hammer." Wait, I think that's getting a bit technical. The hammer is the trigger for the process. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Reverting the bid could mean that a bidder can cancel their bid, but I remember that in some auctions, bidders might have to wait until the hammer falls (the item is sold) for the bid to be respected. But wait, the wording here says until the falling of the hammer. So, can a bidder immediately retract their bid without waiting? Or does the hammer need to fall for the bid to be considered automatically won? I'm not sure, but I think that if you retrace, the item's considered sold, but the bidders might have to wait. Alternatively, maybe this is a common misconception. I don't recall that retraction happens immediately. So B might not be the correct rule.

Option C: "The retraction of a bid by a bidder revives the previous bid." Hmm, when a bidder retracts their bid, does that mean the previous bid is still in effect? I thought that the person who bid higher wins. So, if someone lowers their bid, the higher amount remains. So the previous bid isn't revived. Instead, it's replaced by the lower bid. So C says it revives, which doesn't seem right. So probably C is incorrect.

Option D: "If the auction is without reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw the article at any time prior to the fall of the hammer." Let's think about what this means. In a reserve auction, the seller sets a minimum price. If the highest bid is below the reserve, the item goes to auction. If it's above, the seller must take the item. If it's without a reserve (maybe it's just a standard first-price auction?), then the seller can take the item at any time before it's sold. So if the auction is without reserve, the seller can sell it at any time before the item is actually sold. So the auctioneer can withdraw the article. That makes sense. 

Wait, but the question is about the rules of the auction. So, the rules here would be about what happens when a bid is retract. For example, in a first-price auction, the highest bidder wins. So when a lower bid comes in, the higher one stays. So option C is about the previous bid being revived, which isn't correct. So D is correct because in a no-reserve auction, the seller can take the item at any time before it's sold. So the rule would be that the auctioneer can withdraw the article at any time prior to the fall of the hammer (i.e., before the item is sold). 

So looking back at the options, the correct answer would be D.

The correct answer is D: "If the auction is without reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw the article at any time prior to the fall of the hammer." 

**Explanation:**
In a no-reserve auction, the auctioneer has the authority to sell the item at any time before the item is actually sold. This is because the seller can withdraw the article at any time, as it is not subject to a reserve price. The other options either relate to reserve rules (A) or incorrect behavior regarding bid retraction (C). Thus, D accurately describes the rule in question. 

Answer: D
