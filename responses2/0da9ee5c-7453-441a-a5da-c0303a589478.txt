Question:

An experiment was performed to determine the moles of carbon dioxide gas formed (collected over water) when an acid reacts with limestone. To do this, a piece of dry limestone was weighed. Then carbon dioxide was collected until the limestone disappeared. The atmospheric pressure was measured at 0.965 atm. The temperature was 295 K. The volume of CO2 was measured to the nearest mL and corrected for the vapor pressure of water. The student continuously got low results from what was expected. Can you suggest why?

Options:

A: Perhaps there was too much acid, which interfered with the results.
B: The measurement of atmospheric pressure was incorrect.
C: Carbon dioxide is rather soluble in water.
D: The temperature might have affected the reaction.
E: Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2.
F: The limestone did not fully disappear.
G: Limestone is never pure CaCO3.
H: Perhaps there was not enough acid to dissolve all the limestone.
I: The volume of CO2 was not measured correctly.
J: The vapor pressure of water was not correctly accounted for.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this chemistry question. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about an experiment where carbon dioxide gas is collected over water. They're using limestone as a reactant. The goal is to find the moles of CO2 formed. The setup involved weighing dry limestone, collecting CO2 until it's all gone, measuring the pressure, temperature, and volume. They're getting low results, so something's wrong.

The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct reason why their results are low. Let's think about each option.

Option A says too much acid interfered. If there's excess acid, then some of the limestone might not react, or maybe the reaction would produce a different product. But wait, the setup is about collecting CO2 from acid reacting with limestone. So if acid is in excess, the reaction might produce more CO2, but I'm not sure how that would affect the collected volume. Alternatively, maybe the excess acid affects the vapor pressure measurement? Not sure. This might be a possibility, but I'm not certain yet.

Option B: Measuring pressure was incorrect. The student measured atmospheric pressure as 0.965 atm. But wait, the vapor pressure of water is subtracted when determining the partial pressure of CO2. If that measurement was wrong, but the question says they measured it correctly. Or perhaps they used the wrong value? But the question doesn't mention any errors in measurement, so perhaps B isn't the issue. Unless they measured the vapor pressure incorrectly, but that's unlikely because the question states the pressure was 0.965 atm. Hmm.

Option C: CO2 is soluble in water. That doesn't make sense. CO2 is a gas, and when it's collected over water, it's because the water vapor is present. So the volume of CO2 is measured after subtracting the water vapor pressure. If CO2 were more soluble, the partial pressure would be higher, but that doesn't directly cause low CO2 moles. Or maybe if the gas was more volatile, the volume would change more, but I don't think this is the issue. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Temperature affects the reaction. The temperature here is 295 K, which is about 22°C. Normally, reactions change with temperature. But if the reaction isn't affected by temperature, then perhaps the moles would be correct. But the question says the student got low results, so maybe the reaction didn't proceed as expected. Or perhaps the reaction is exothermic, and higher temperatures made it shift to the left, producing less CO2. But I'm not sure how that would lead to low moles. Alternatively, maybe the reaction was endothermic and heat affected it. But without knowing, this is less likely. But the question is about why their results were low, so maybe D is a possibility.

Option E: Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2. Wait, that's not correct. Limestone is primarily CaCO3, sometimes with some other compounds. So if the student assumed it was Ca(HCO3)2, that's incorrect. Because Ca(HCO3)2 isn't a typical form of limestone. So if the limestone was actually CaCO3, then the reaction would proceed differently. For example, CaCO3 reacts with HCl to produce CO2 and CaCl2. So if the student thought the limestone was Ca(HCO3)2 instead, which is not the real limestone, the reaction would produce less CO2, which would lead to lower moles. That could explain the low results. So E is a possibility.

Option F: Limestone didn't fully disappear. So if some limestone remains, that means not all the reaction occurred, so less CO2 was collected. The volume would be less than expected. So if the reaction didn't go to completion, you wouldn't collect all the CO2, leading to a lower moles measurement. That's a possible reason. So F is a candidate.

Option G: Limestone is never pure CaCO3. Well, that's a red flag. If it's not pure CaCO3, then the reaction would produce less CO2. So if the limestone is not pure, the moles would be lower. So G would also cause low results. So that's another possible reason.

Option H: Not enough acid to dissolve all limestone. If the acid isn't enough, the reaction wouldn't proceed, leading to no CO2 being formed. So the moles would be zero, which is definitely low. So H is a possible issue.

Option I: Volume of CO2 was measured wrong. Maybe they used a wrong volume or miscalculated. For example, maybe they measured mL incorrectly, but the question says it was measured to the nearest mL. So perhaps the volume was miscalculated, leading to a wrong value. But that's an error in data collection, not necessarily a problem in the setup. If they thought it was 20 mL but it was actually 15, that would cause a lower value. So I could see I is a possibility. But the question says the volume was measured correctly, though; no, the question says the volume was measured to the nearest mL, so maybe that's correct. So perhaps I isn't the issue.

Option J: Vapor pressure not accounted for. The correct way is to subtract the vapor pressure of water from the total pressure. If they didn't do that, the measured pressure would be higher, leading to a higher calculated CO2 partial pressure. So the moles would be higher than expected. But the question says the student measured the atmospheric pressure correctly. So perhaps not J.

Let me go through each option again.

The problem is that the student got low results, meaning moles of CO2 were low. Why? Let's think about each option.

E: If the limestone was Ca(HCO3)2 instead of CaCO3, which is not the case. So the reaction would produce less CO2, so the student would have a lower value. For example, CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O. Ca(HCO3)2 doesn't react with HCl in the same way, maybe. Or perhaps, wait, Ca(HCO3)2 is not a standard form; maybe the reaction is different. Let's think: Ca(HCO3)2 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + 2H2O + 2CO2. So CaCO3 produces 1 mole CO2, while Ca(HCO3)2 produces 2. So if the student used Ca(HCO3)2, the moles would be double what they should be. So they'd get low results because they're using a different form of limestone, which doesn't react as much. So E is a possible reason.

F: If the limestone didn't disappear completely, so not all CO2 was collected. So the measured volume is lower than it should be. That would lead to low moles because the volume is less. So F is a possible reason.

G: If the limestone wasn't pure, then the reaction produces less CO2. So G leads to low moles.

H: If the acid wasn't enough to fully react with the limestone, the reaction doesn't proceed, giving zero or very low CO2. So H is a possible reason.

I: If the volume was measured wrong, but the question states it was measured correctly to the nearest mL. Hmm, maybe the volume was not correctly measured in mL. But the question says that the volume was measured correctly. So perhaps I isn't the issue.

J: If they didn't account for the vapor pressure, the measured pressure would be higher than the actual CO2 pressure. For example, if the total pressure measured was higher because they didn't subtract the vapor pressure. That would cause the student to calculate a higher moles of CO2 than actually present. So J would cause high moles, not low. So J isn't the issue here.

So the possible correct reasons are E, F, G, H, and maybe D.

Wait, but the question is about why the student's results were low. So the real issue is in the setup or calculation.

So, looking at the options, let me think about each possibility.

The student's approach is: collect CO2 until the limestone disappears. So if the limestone isn't completely removed, the volume is lower than expected. So F is a possible reason.

Alternatively, if the reaction didn't proceed, then volume is zero, so moles are low. So H is another possibility.

Another possibility: Maybe the reaction is exothermic. If the reaction releases a lot of heat, the temperature might change. But the temperature is 295 K, which is about 22°C. If the reaction is endothermic, heating would push the equilibrium to the left, reducing CO2 production. So if the reaction is endothermic, perhaps the student expects higher moles but found less. Alternatively, if the reaction is exothermic, higher temperature would shift to produce more CO2, but that's not the case here. Hmm, maybe not the main issue here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is reversible and the student didn't account for the mass of the limestone properly, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the question says the student continuously got low results. What if the reaction is incomplete, so the mass of CO2 collected is lower than expected. But in that case, the moles would be lower because moles are (mass)/(molar mass). Wait, but the same mass, so if you have less CO2 (because not all reacted), the moles would be lower. So if the reaction didn't go to completion, then the collected CO2 would be less than the theoretical amount. So F is a possible reason.

Another point is that the vapor pressure of water would be subtracted. If the student didn't account for it, then the measured pressure would be higher than the actual pressure of the CO2. So the partial pressure of CO2 would be higher. But how does this affect the calculation? Let's think. The total pressure is atmospheric (measured as 0.965 atm). The vapor pressure of water (P_water) is subtracted to get the partial pressure of CO2.

If the student didn't account for the vapor pressure, then the measured pressure would be higher than the actual. Let's imagine that P_total = P_CO2 + P_water. If the student doesn't subtract P_water, they calculate P_CO2 = measured P_total - 1 atm (assuming P_water is 1 atm at 25°C, but the actual value depends on temperature and pressure). Wait, but the actual P_water at 295 K is higher. Because P_water = (a) * exp( -ΔH/(R T) ), but perhaps the exact value is more than 1 atm at 295 K. Hmm, but in the question, the student measured the pressure as 0.965 atm. If the actual P_water is, say, less than 1 atm. Let me think: 295 K is 22°C, which is around 66°F. The vapor pressure of water at 22°C is about 20 mmHg, which is about 0.026 atm. So if the student thought that the vapor pressure is 1 atm, which is way higher than actual, then the student would calculate a higher partial pressure of CO2 than reality. For example, if the real P_water is 0.026 atm, then the real CO2 pressure is 0.965 - 0.026 = 0.939 atm. If the student measured it as 0.965 atm, and thought P_water was 1 atm, then the student would think the CO2 pressure is 0.965 -1 = -0.035 atm, which is impossible, so the student probably wouldn't have any CO2, which would make the volume zero. But in the question, the student is getting low but not zero. 

Wait, but if the actual P_water is about 0.026 atm, and the student's measured P_total is 0.965, then the student's calculation would be 0.965 - 1 = -0.035, which is impossible, so they wouldn't measure any CO2. So in this case, their measured CO2 would be zero, which would be a very low value. But wait, the question says the student's results are low but not zero. So perhaps the student didn't account for the vapor pressure correctly, leading to a higher calculated partial pressure of CO2 than it actually is. So the moles would be higher than expected, not lower. So that's not the issue here.

Hmm, perhaps not J.

Let me think about option G: Limestone is never pure CaCO3. So, if the limestone is not pure, the reaction produces more CO2 than expected. For example, if it's Ca(HCO3)2, which is less reactive, more CO2 is produced. So they would get higher moles than they should, not lower. So G is not the issue.

So going back, the possible problems are F, E, H, and perhaps D. Let me think again about each.

Option F: If the limestone didn't completely disappear, that means some reaction didn't happen, so less CO2 was collected. So the volume is lower than expected. So the moles would be lower, hence low. So F is correct.

Option E: If the limestone wasn't CaCO3 but Ca(HCO3)2, which has a different reaction. For example, Ca(HCO3)2 + HCl → CaCl2 + 2 H2O + 2 CO2. So for each mole of CaCO3, you get 1 mole CO2, but Ca(HCO3)2 gives 2. So if the student used the wrong form of limestone, the moles would be double what they should be. So the student's calculated moles would be higher, not lower. So E would cause high moles, not low. So E isn't the issue.

Wait, but the student's moles are low. So if the reaction produces less CO2, perhaps because the limestone didn't react, then moles would be low. So F is a possible issue.

What about H: If the acid is insufficient to react with the limestone, the reaction doesn't proceed. So no CO2 is formed, leading to zero moles, which is indeed low. So H is a possible cause.

What about G: If the limestone isn't pure, then the reaction produces more CO2. So G would cause higher moles, not lower. So not G.

So the problem could be F, H, or E. But E would cause higher moles. So F and H are more likely.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which options are available.

The options are A to J.

So, possible answers are F, H, E, and G.

Wait, the options are F, H, and G as possibilities. But the question says the student is getting low results. So the actual issue is that the pressure measurement was incorrect or not accounted for.

Wait, if the pressure was measured incorrectly. Like, maybe they thought the pressure was 1 atm, but it's actually 0.965. But the question says the atmospheric pressure was measured as 0.965 atm. So if they thought it was 1 atm, and the vapor pressure is about 0.026 atm, then the CO2 pressure would be 0.965 -0.026 = 0.939 atm, which is correct. So if they didn't account for the vapor pressure, they would think the CO2 pressure is 0.965 atm, leading to higher calculated moles. So they would get higher CO2 than they should. So that's not the issue.

So what's the correct answer?

The options are:

E: Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2.

H: Not enough acid.

F: Limestone didn't disappear.

G: Limestone is not pure CaCO3.

So the student got low results, which could be because they didn't collect enough CO2 (F) or the reaction didn't proceed (H), or they used the wrong form of limestone (G), but G would likely cause higher moles, not lower. So perhaps the issue is that the reaction didn't produce enough CO2 because the acid wasn't enough, so H is the likely answer.

Wait, but I thought F is another possibility. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says the student collected CO2 until the limestone disappeared. So if the limestone didn't disappear, that means not all CO2 was collected. So the volume is too low, leading to low moles. So F is a possible issue.

So the question is which option is the reason.

The correct answer is F: Limestone did not fully disappear. Because if the limestone didn't disappear, the reaction didn't produce all the CO2. So the volume would be less than expected, leading to low moles.

Thus, the correct answer is F.

The experiment involves determining the moles of carbon dioxide gas produced when an acid reacts with limestone. The student's results were low, prompting investigation into possible errors. Each option is analyzed as follows:

- **A: Too much acid interfering with the results.**  
  If too much acid was present, the reaction might produce more CO2, leading to higher results, not lower. This is unlikely.

- **B: Incorrect measurement of atmospheric pressure.**  
  The question states that the pressure was measured as 0.965 atm, which aligns with the setup. There is no indication of a mistake in this measurement, making this option unlikely.

- **C: CO2 is soluble in water.**  
  CO2 is a gas, and when collected over water, it is absorbed by the water vapor. The volume of CO2 measured after subtracting the vapor pressure of water is the correct method. This makes C unlikely.

- **D: Temperature affecting the reaction.**  
  The temperature was controlled at 295 K (22°C). However, if the reaction were highly exothermic, the reaction might shift left, producing less CO2. This is a possible explanation but not the most likely.

- **E: Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2.**  
  Ca(HCO3)2 is not a standard form of limestone, which is typically CaCO3. If the limestone were Ca(HCO3)2, it would react differently, potentially producing more CO2. This would result in higher moles, not lower. Thus, E is unlikely.

- **F: Limestone did not fully disappear.**  
  If the limestone did not disappear, not all the reaction occurred, leading to less CO2 being collected. This would result in lower moles, which aligns with the student's results. This is a strong candidate.

- **G: Limestone is never pure CaCO3.**  
  If the limestone were not pure, the reaction would produce more CO2 than expected. This would result in higher moles, not lower. Thus, G is unlikely.

- **H: Acid was not enough to dissolve all limestone.**  
  If the acid was insufficient to react with the limestone, the reaction would proceed minimally, resulting in a very low or zero amount of CO2. This is a strong candidate.

- **I: Volume of CO2 was measured incorrectly.**  
  The question specifies that the volume was measured to the nearest mL, so this is unlikely to be the issue.

- **J: Vapour pressure not accounted for.**  
  If the vapour pressure of water was not accounted for, the measured pressure would be higher than the actual CO2 pressure. This would result in higher moles, not lower. Thus, J is unlikely.

The most likely explanation is **F: Limestone did not fully disappear**, as this would result in less CO2 being collected and, consequently, low moles.

ANSWER: F
