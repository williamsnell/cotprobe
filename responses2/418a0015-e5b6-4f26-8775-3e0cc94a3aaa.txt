Okay, so I've got this question about Kohlberg's stages of moral development. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the second stage of the preconventional level. I remember that Kohlberg's stages are divided into three main levels: the preconventional, conventional, and preliterate stages. Each stage represents a point where children start to develop more sophisticated moral reasoning.

The first stage is preconventional, which includes the ages of around 2 to 4 years. At this stage, children might act in ways that seem reasonable but aren't necessarily consistent or moral. They might think that rules are okay to follow because, for them, it's just a way to survive, maybe. So they might follow rules because it's a practical necessity.

Then comes the second stage, which is the conventional stage. This is where children start to think about rules in more abstract terms. They start to calculate the consequences and evaluate the reasonableness of their actions. So, in this stage, children might obey rules because it's in their best interest. They might see rules as something they can control and make decisions based on the outcomes.

Looking back at the options, the question is about why they obey rules in this second stage. The options are A to J.

Option A: They are taught that rules are unbreakable. That sounds more like the third stage, perhaps, where they might think rules are absolute and can't be broken. So maybe A isn't the answer for the second stage.

Option B: They enjoy following the rules. This could be true, but I think that's more about the motivation behind obeying, not the reason for obeying in terms of their understanding of rules.

Option C: They are rewarded for following rules. Hmm, this might be about the consequence of obeying. But the question is about why they obey, not the reward for doing so.

Option D: They feel they have a personal duty to uphold rules and laws. Oh, this seems like a strong contender. In the conventional stage, children are supposed to have a personal sense of responsibility to maintain rules. So they believe they have a duty to do what's right, which might make them follow rules more because they feel they're being held responsible.

Option E: Doing so helps them satisfy their personal needs. This is more about the need to fulfill their own desires, but I think that's more about self-interest than moral duty.

Option F: They understand fairness and justice. That sounds like a later stage, probably the final stage, where they become law-abiding citizens. So F is probably not the answer for the second stage.

Option G: Doing so helps them avoid punishment. That's more about the consequences of following rules, perhaps. I'm not sure if it's about the reason for obeying, but maybe it's related.

Option H: "Everyone else is doing it." This is more about social pressure or social sanctions, which might not be the reason for obeying rules.

Option I: They believe in the inherent goodness of rules. That seems too positive and more about a personal belief, not the underlying reason.

Option J: They fear societal disapproval. That's a negative attitude, which isn't the reason for following rules, but perhaps a cause for avoiding them.

So putting it together, the second stage is about having a personal duty to uphold rules, which is option D. They believe they have a duty to follow rules because they feel responsible for them.

The correct answer is D: they feel they have a personal duty to uphold rules and laws.

Answer: D
