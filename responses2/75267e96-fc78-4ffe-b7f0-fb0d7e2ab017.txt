The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man committed a series of heinous crimes, including a kidnapping, that took him across state lines and violated federal law. He was convicted and received a life sentence. The felon, however, was pardoned by the President of the United States, who was a childhood friend. A great hue and cry ensued, and the talking heads on television proclaimed that legislation was needed to prevent such injustice again. Would such legislation be constitutional?

Options:

A: No, because the president's power to pardon can only be limited by a constitutional amendment.
B: Yes, because the Supreme Court can overrule a presidential pardon.
C: No, because the Constitution does not allow for any limitations on the presidential pardon power.
D: Yes, under Article II
E: Yes, under Article I.
F: Yes, because the president's power to pardon is not unlimited according to the Supreme Court.
G: Yes, under the Fifth Amendment.
H: Yes, because Congress can put limits on the pardon power.
I: No. While what the president did wasn't a good idea, the Constitution expressly grants the President an unqualified power to pardon.
J: No, because the Constitution gives the president the absolute power to grant pardons for federal offenses.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically related to presidential pardoning of felonies. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about whether a law would be constitutional if Congress would limit the President's power to pardon. The scenario is a man who committed heinous crimes, which led to his prison sentences, and he was pardoned by the President. The talking heads are calling for legislation to prevent such an event again. The options are A to J, each with different reasoning.

First, I need to recall the constitutional provisions related to presidential pardon power. I remember that the President has the power to pardon individuals who violate certain laws, but there are some rules about how much he can do. The Constitution does not outright limit the President's power, but there are exceptions and legal provisions.

The key law here is Article II, specifically Section 404, which outlines the President's pardon power. It says the President may pardon a person who has violated any law, except for purposes of (a) self-inculpatory crimes or (b) for the purpose of a study, school, or religious institution. But there's also the question of whether the President's pardon is limited by the Constitution.

Wait, but the Supreme Court has overruled certain aspects. I think the Court has said that the President's pardon power is not unlimited. There were cases where the Court upheld limits on the President's pardon beyond the self-inculpatory and religious purposes. For example, it's said that the President cannot pardon anyone for the purpose of a political campaign or any other organized effort. So, the Supreme Court has recognized that the President can only pardon individuals for self-inculpatory purposes, religious institutions, or school purposes. This is a constitutional exception.

So, the Constitution in Article II allows for the President to pardon beyond what the Supreme Court says, but the Court has found that the power is limited. Therefore, Congress can limit the President's pardon power if they want. But the question is, would such legislation be constitutional?

The options are:

A: No, because the president's power can only be limited by a constitutional amendment.

Hmm. So the argument here is that the President's power is limited, but the Constitution doesn't explicitly protect against unlimited pardon. So, if Congress wants to limit it, they can, but it's up to them to do so. However, the question is whether the legislation itself is constitutional. So, perhaps A is suggesting that Congress can't limit it without a constitutional amendment. That's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe A is suggesting that the President's power isn't unlimited on its own because the Constitution doesn't give it, so such legislation is not allowed. But that's not exactly right because the Constitution doesn't outright limit it, just limits the power under the Constitution.

B: Yes, because the Supreme Court can overrule a presidential pardon.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the Supreme Court can overrule the President, then Congress would be allowed to limit it. So, the argument is that the Court can say no, but that's a different option.

C: No, because the Constitution does not allow for any limitations on the presidential pardon power.

Wait, I thought the Supreme Court has found that the President's pardon power is limited beyond self-inculpatory purposes. So, if Congress wants to limit it, they can do so, but the Constitution doesn't explicitly ban it. So, the answer needs to reflect that the President's pardon isn't unlimited under the Constitution.

D: Yes, under Article II.

But no, because the Constitution doesn't explicitly restrict the President's pardon power. It's more about how the Court applies it.

E: Yes, under Article I.

No, Article I is for states' powers, and the President is a federal office. So, Article I doesn't grant him the power.

F: Yes, because the president's power to pardon is not unlimited according to the Supreme Court.

Wait, that's a possibility. The Supreme Court has established that the President can only pardon individuals for certain purposes, not all. So, if Congress wants to limit it, they can, but it's not from the Constitution. So, this option is about the Supreme Court's ruling. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the President's power is limited, so such legislation is not allowed, but the options don't explicitly state that.

G: Yes, under the Fifth Amendment.

No, the Fifth Amendment is about freedom of speech and assembly, not about the power of the President.

H: Yes, because Congress can put limits on the pardon power.

Yes, that's an option. Because the Constitution doesn't outright limit it beyond the Supreme Court's interpretation, Congress can regulate it as they see fit. So, such legislation is constitutional.

I: No. While what the president did wasn't a good idea, the Constitution expressly grants the President an unqualified power to pardon.

Hmm, this seems to suggest that Congress can't limit the President's power in any way. But I don't think that's correct because the Supreme Court has said limits exist beyond self-inculpatory and religious.

J: No, because the Constitution gives the president the absolute power to grant pardons for federal offenses.

No, that's way overstepping. The President has a specific, limited power.

So, the options are between C and H.

C: No, because the Constitution does not allow for any limitations on the presidential pardon power.

H: Yes, because Congress can put limits on the pardon power.

Wait, so the question is whether such legislation is constitutional. If Congress can limit it, then it's constitutional as long as the limits are in the Constitution or the Supreme Court. 

But the Constitution does not limit the President's pardon. It only limits it under the Supreme Court's interpretation. So, the President can only pardon for self-inculpatory, religious, or school purposes. Therefore, Congress can limit it beyond that, so such legislation would be constitutional. So, option H says yes, under the Fifth Amendment, which I don't think applies. Alternatively, H says yes because Congress can put limits on the pardon.

Wait, the options don't say anything about the Fifth Amendment, but the Supreme Court has established that the President's pardon power is limited. So, the question is whether such a law is constitutional. So, the answer would be H: Yes, because Congress can put limits on the pardon power.

Alternatively, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The Constitution allows the President to pardon for certain purposes, but the Supreme Court has found that he can only do so for self-inculpatory purposes, religious, or school. So, the President's power is limited beyond that. Therefore, Congress can limit it, which would make the law constitutional. So, option H is correct.

Another way: If Congress wants to limit the President's pardon, they can do so, but the Constitution doesn't explicitly allow that. So, the answer is H.

The question revolves around whether legislation to limit the President's pardon power, granted by him for federal offenses, is constitutional. Key legal principles include Article II, Article I, and the interpretation by the Supreme Court.

1. **Article II (Constitutional Power of the President):** The President has the power to pardon individuals for self-inculpatory purposes, religious institutions, or schools. However, the Supreme Court has established exceptions, such as self-inculpatory crimes, organized purposes (e.g., political campaigns), and religious purposes, beyond which the President's pardon is limited.

2. **Supreme Court rulings:** The Court has overruled that the President's pardon power is not unlimited, especially beyond self-inculpatory purposes. Congress, therefore, has the authority to limit this power as they see fit.

3. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **A:** Incorrect. The President's power is not unlimited on its own; it is limited by the Supreme Court's interpretation.
   - **B:** Incorrect. The Supreme Court can overrule President's pardon, allowing Congress to limit it.
   - **C:** Incorrect. The Constitution does not outright limit the President's pardon power; it limits it beyond self-inculpatory purposes.
   - **D:** Incorrect. Article II does not restrict the President's pardon; it allows for its use beyond the Court's interpretation.
   - **E:** Incorrect. Article I does not grant the President the power to grant pardons.
   - **F:** Incorrect. The Fifth Amendment concerns freedom of speech, not the power of the President.
   - **G:** Incorrect. The Fifth Amendment does not apply here.
   - **H:** Correct. Congress can regulate the President's pardon power through constitutional amendments, as the Supreme Court has established limitations.
   - **I:** Incorrect. The Supreme Court does not grant the President absolute power to grant pardons for federal offenses.
   - **J:** Incorrect. The President's power is not absolute.

**Conclusion:** Since the Supreme Court has established that the President's pardon power is limited, Congress can limit it, making such legislation constitutional. Therefore, the correct answer is **H: Yes, because Congress can put limits on the pardon power.**

ANSWER: H
