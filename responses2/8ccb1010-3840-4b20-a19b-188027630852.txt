Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that a net force F_A acts on object A, and F_B acts on object B. The mass of B is twice that of A. And the acceleration of B is twice that of A. I need to find out the relationship between F_A and F_B.

Hmm, Newton's second law comes into play here. Oh right, F = ma. So each force can be related to its mass and acceleration.

Let me write down what I know. Let's denote the mass of object A as m. So, mass of B is 2m. The acceleration of A is a, so acceleration of B is 2a.

So for object A, F_A = m * a. And for object B, F_B = (2m) * (2a). Let me calculate that. 2m times 2a is 4ma. So F_B is 4ma.

Wait, but F_A is m * a, which is just F_A = m a. So F_B is 4 times F_A. So F_B = 4 F_A. Let me check the options.

Looking back at the options, option A is F_B = 6 F_A. No, that's not right. Option F is F_B = 8 F_A. No, that's even higher. Option I is F_B = 2 F_A. No, I'm thinking F_B is four times, so that's not right either. Option B is F_B=3 F_A. No, that's 3 times, which doesn't fit. Option G is F_B = 3/2 F_A, which is 1.5 times. No. Option H is 5 times, which is 5 and F_B is 5F_A. No. Option J is 1/4 F_A. Oh wait, no, because 4 is bigger than 1.

Wait wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me re-calculate.

Object A: F_A = m * a. So m is mass, a is acceleration. So F_A = m a.

Object B: mass is 2m. Acceleration is 2a. So F_B = 2m * 2a = 4 m a. Which is 4 times F_A.

So F_B is 4 F_A. Looking at the options, option A is 6 times, no. Option F is 8 times. No. Option I is 2 times. No. So the correct option should be F_B =4 F_A, which is option I. So the answer is I.

To solve the problem, we use Newton's second law, \( F = ma \). For object A, the net force is \( F_A = m \cdot a \), where \( m \) is the mass of object A and \( a \) is its acceleration. For object B, the mass is \( 2m \) and the acceleration is \( 2a \), so the net force is \( F_B = (2m) \cdot (2a) = 4ma \). Since \( F_A = ma \), it follows that \( F_B = 4F_A \).

From the given options, the correct relationship is \( F_B = 4F_A \), which corresponds to option I.
