Okay, so I've got this question about the assumptions required for the OLS estimator to be consistent, unbiased, and efficient. Hmm, I need to think this through.

First, let's recall what OLS stands for. OLS is the ordinary least squares method used in linear regression analysis. The question is asking which assumptions are needed to show that the OLS estimator has three properties: consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency.

Let me break down each assumption:

i) E(u_t) = 0. Oh yeah, this is the assumption of strict exogeneity. It means that the error term has an expected value of zero. This is important because if the error terms weren't zero on average, then the OLS estimates might be biased.

ii) Var(u_t) = σ². This is about the variance of the error term. It's typically assumed that the error term has a constant variance, which is the classical linear regression assumption. This also helps in estimating the variance of the estimator.

iii) Cov(u_t, u_{t-j}) = 0 for all j. This is the assumption of strict exogeneity again, but more specifically, it's the assumption that the error terms are uncorrelated across different observations. This ensures that the regressors are not correlated with the error term, which is crucial for unbiasedness.

iv) u_t ~ N(0, σ²). This is the normality assumption. It tells us that the error terms are normally distributed. Normally distributed errors are important for the OLS estimator to be efficient because the Gauss-Markov theorem states that under these assumptions, OLS is the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). If the errors weren't normally distributed, the OLS estimator might not be efficient in small samples.

Now, the question is about the assumptions required to show that OLS is consistent, unbiased, and efficient. Wait, I remember that for OLS to be efficient (i.e., unbiased and efficient), the Gauss-Markov theorem applies. This requires several assumptions, including full rank design matrix (so that the X matrix is invertible and the parameters are identified), zero conditional mean (E(u_t|x) = 0), homoscedasticity (Var(u_t) is constant), and that the regressors are exogenous (meaning uncorrelated with the error term).

Wait, but in the options, the given assumptions don't include homoscedasticity or normality. So perhaps the question is considering the minimal set of assumptions, similar to the ones included in the Gauss-Markov theorem's requirements.

The Gauss-Markov theorem states that OLS is BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator) if certain assumptions hold. These include:

1. Linearity: the model is linear in parameters.
2. Strict exogeneity: E(u_t) = 0.
3. No perfect multicollinearity.
4. Homoscedasticity: Var(u_t) = σ² is constant.
5. Independence of the error terms: Cov(u_t, u_{t-j}) = 0 for all j ≠ 0.

Wait, but the question is asking which of these are required for consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency.

Wait, but OLS is unbiased and efficient under the Gauss-Markov assumptions. But in the question, the options don't include homoscedasticity or normality. Wait, let me read again.

The question: "Which of the following assumptions are required to show the consistency, unbiasedness and efficiency of the OLS estimator?"

Wait, the options don't include homoscedasticity. Hmm, this is confusing. Let's think again.

Wait, the OLS estimator is consistent if it converges in probability to the true parameter as the sample size increases. Consistency requires that the regressors are exogenous, meaning that E(u_t|x) = 0. Assumption i is that E(u_t)=0, but for exogeneity, we also need E(u_t|x) =0, which is a stronger condition. So E(u_t)=0 is part of the exogeneity assumption.

Wait, the Gauss-Markov theorem requires:

1. Linearity
2. Strict exogeneity (E(u_t)=0)
3. No perfect multicollinearity
4. Homoscedasticity (Var(u_t)=σ²)
5. Independence of errors (Cov(u_t, u_{t-j})=0)

Wait, but the question is about the assumptions required for consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency.

Wait, but in statistics, OLS is unbiased under strict exogeneity and no perfect multicollinearity. And it's efficient if the errors are homoscedastic and uncorrelated (i.e., assumption iii and iv).

Wait, but the question is about the combination of assumptions required to show that OLS is consistent, unbiased, and efficient. So let's see:

- Unbiasedness: requires strict exogeneity (i) and no perfect multicollinearity (which isn't an option in the question, but perhaps is implicitly given).

- Efficiency: requires homoscedasticity (iv) and zero covariance between errors (iii). Also, for efficiency in small samples, the errors must be uncorrelated.

Wait, but the question asks which assumptions are required for all three: consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency.

Wait, but maybe the key is that the OLS estimator is consistent, unbiased, and efficient if and only if all the Gauss-Markov assumptions are met, which includes i, ii, iii, and iv. So, then option A (all four) would be correct.

But wait, option A is (i), (ii), (iii), (iv). So that would mean all four are needed.

But looking back at the question, the options don't include an option requiring all four. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) → all four.

B: (i), (iii), (iv) only

C: (ii) and (iv) only

D: (i), (ii), (iii) only

E: (ii) and (iii) only

F: (i) and (ii) only

G: (iii) and (iv) only

H: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only

I: (i) and (iv) only

J: (i) and (iii) only

Wait, so option H is (ii), (iii), (iv) only.

Wait, but I thought that for consistency, you need assumption i (E(u)=0) and no perfect multicollinearity. But in some versions of Gauss-Markov, the "no perfect multicollinearity" is already part of the assumption ii (Var(u)=σ²), which is assumption ii. So perhaps the Gauss-Markov requires only i, ii, and iv for the OLS estimator to be BLUE (i.e., consistent and efficient).

Wait, but for consistency, you need E(u_t)=0 (i) and E(u_t|x) = 0, which is the exogeneity condition. But in some sources, the exogeneity is part of the assumption (ii) or (iii), but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that OLS is consistent if E(u_t)=0 and that the regressors are exogenous. So, assumption i is needed.

But for unbiasedness, you need E(u_t)=0 and no perfect multicollinearity, which is not an option in the question. So perhaps the question is only considering the minimal set of assumptions needed for OLS to be unbiased and efficient. Wait, but the question also mentions consistency.

Wait, another approach: the OLS estimator is consistent if the regressors are exogenous (i.e., E(u_t)=0 and E(u_t|x)=0). So, to ensure that, you need E(u_t)=0, which is i. And for the OLS to be efficient, you need homoscedasticity (iv) and that the errors are uncorrelated, which is iii.

But the question is about the combination of assumptions needed for consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency.

Wait, perhaps the answer is that all four are necessary: i) E(u_t)=0, ii) Var(u_t)=σ², iii) Cov(u_t, u_{t-j})=0, and iv) u_t ~ N(0, σ²). So the correct answer would be option A: all four.

But wait, looking at the options, option H is (ii), (iii), and (iv) only. But option H says (ii), (iii), (iv) only. Oh wait, but that's only three assumptions. So then option A has four.

Wait, but perhaps the assumption of normality (iv) is not required for the OLS estimator to be efficient. Because in the case of small samples, the Gauss-Markov theorem requires homoscedasticity and independence of errors. But if the errors are normally distributed, you can use the t-test and F-test, which rely on the normality assumption, even in small samples. So, for efficiency, you need homoscedasticity and i.i.d. errors, but not necessarily normality for the Gauss-Markov theorem.

Wait, but the question is about the assumptions required to show that OLS is consistent, unbiased, and efficient. So, for all three properties, you need all four assumptions: i, ii, iii, and iv.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think:

- Unbiasedness: requires E(u_t)=0 (i) and no perfect multicollinearity (which is not an option in the question, but perhaps another assumption is included, like E(u_t|x)=0, which is part of the exogeneity assumption). So, i is needed.

- Efficiency: requires homoscedasticity (iv) and that the errors are uncorrelated (iii).

Wait, but then when they say 'show the consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency', they all come from different sets of assumptions. So for consistency, you need E(u_t)=0 and E(u_t|x)=0 (i and iii). For unbiasedness, you need E(u_t)=0 (i) and no perfect multicollinearity (which isn't in the options). For efficiency, you need iv (homoscedasticity) and iii (uncorrelated errors).

But the question is about the set of assumptions that are required to show all three. That is, all four assumptions (i, ii, iii, iv) must hold.

Wait, but wait. The question asks which of the following assumptions are required to show. So, perhaps the answer is all four.

Looking back at the options:

A) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) → all four.

But let me think again. When it comes to the Gauss-Markov theorem, the main assumptions are:

1. Linearity: model is linear in parameters.

2. Strict exogeneity: E(u_t)=0 and E(u_t|x)=0.

3. No perfect multicollinearity: X is invertible → variables are not perfect multicollinear.

4. Homoscedasticity: Var(u_t) = σ².

5. Independence of errors: Cov(u_t, u_{t-j}) =0 for j≠0.

So, for OLS to be BLUE, you need all five? Or is it the other way around.

Wait, the Gauss-Markov theorem states that under these assumptions, the OLS estimator is the best linear unbiased estimator. So, the key assumptions are the ones listed above.

But the question is about which assumptions are required for consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency.

Wait, but for OLS to be unbiased, it's required that E(u_t|x)=0. Which includes E(u_t)=0 (i) and E(u_t|x)=0 (which is a stronger condition). So, E(u_t)=0 is part of the exogeneity.

So, to have unbiasedness, you need i) and iii). Wait, but for the OLS estimator to be efficient, you need iv) and iii). So, in the question, which is about showing all three—consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting myself confused. Let's break it down.

Consistency: requires that as n increases, the estimator converges to the true parameter. For this, you need E(u_t)=0 and E(u_t|x)=0. So, i and iii.

Unbiasedness: requires E(u_t)=0 (i) and no perfect multicollinearity (which isn't an option, but maybe the other assumptions are considered).

Efficiency: requires that the estimator is the best linear unbiased estimator, which requires that the errors are uncorrelated and have constant variance (homoscedasticity and i.i.d.), so iv and iii.

So, for all three properties, what is needed:

- Consistency: i and iii.

- Unbiasedness: i.

- Efficiency: iv and iii.

But the question asks which assumptions are required to show that OLS is consistent, unbiased, and efficient. So, all four assumptions (i, ii, iii, iv) must hold.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is (ii), (iii), and (iv) only. So that's 3 assumptions. Option A is all four.

So, which is correct?

Wait, the key here is that for OLS to have an efficient estimator, you need the Gauss-Markov assumptions, which include ii (Var(u_t)=σ²), iii (uncorrelated errors), and iv (normality). But perhaps some of these assumptions are not required for all three properties.

Wait, perhaps for the OLS estimator to be consistent and efficient, you need:

- E(u_t)=0 (i)

- E(u_t|x)=0 (which is part of the exogeneity, so i and iii)

- Var(u_t)=σ² (ii)

- Uncorrelated errors (iii)

- Normally distributed errors (iv)

Wait, but for OLS to be consistent, you need i and iii. For it to be efficient, you need iv and iii.

But for unbiasedness, you need i (E(u_t)=0) and no perfect multicollinearity (which isn't part of the given options).

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the minimal set of assumptions for the properties stated. So, to show consistency, you need only E(u_t)=0 (i). To show unbiasedness, you need E(u_t)=0 (i) and no perfect multicollinearity. But given the options, perhaps the question is only considering the minimal set that ensures all three, which would require i, ii, iii, and iv.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the Gauss-Markov assumptions, which include ii, iii, and iv, but not i (since for OLS to be unbiased, you need i). Wait, but for the OLS estimator to be efficient, you need iv and iii, not just iv.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that all four are necessary: i) E(u_t)=0, ii) Var(u_t)=σ², iii) Cov(u_t, u_{t-j})=0, and iv) u_t ~ N(0, σ²). So the correct option is A: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again.

Wait, the key point is that for OLS to be the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE), all five Gauss-Markov assumptions are needed. But if the question is only considering the minimal set of assumptions required for consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency, perhaps it's only the four. Because for consistency, you need E(u_t)=0 and E(u_t|x)=0. For unbiasedness, you need E(u_t)=0 (i) and no perfect multicollinearity (which isn't part of the options, but maybe it's already included in another assumption). For efficiency, you need homoscedasticity (iv) and the errors are uncorrelated (iii).

But if the question is asking which of the following assumptions are required, then perhaps all four are necessary: i) E(u_t)=0, ii) Var(u_t)=σ², iii) Cov(u_t, u_{t-j})=0, and iv) u_t ~ N(0, σ²). So the correct answer would be option A: all four.
</think>

To determine which assumptions are required for the consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency of the OLS estimator, we analyze each option:

1. **Assumption (i): E(u_t) = 0**  
   This is the strict exogeneity assumption, which ensures that the expected value of the error term is zero. This is necessary for both unbiasedness and consistency of the OLS estimator.

2. **Assumption (ii): Var(u_t) = σ²**  
   This is the assumption of homoscedasticity, meaning the variance of the error term is constant across observations. This is necessary for the OLS estimator to be efficient, as it requires the errors to be uncorrelated and homoscedastic.

3. **Assumption (iii): Cov(u_t, u_{t-j}) = 0 for all j ≠ 0**  
   This is the assumption of no autocorrelation, which ensures that the error terms are uncorrelated across different observations. This is necessary for the OLS estimator to be efficient.

4. **Assumption (iv): u_t ~ N(0, σ²)**  
   This is the assumption of normality of the error term. While this is not strictly necessary for the Gauss-Markov theorem to hold, it is necessary for the OLS estimator to be efficient and for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals to be valid.

### Key Considerations:
- **Consistency**: Requires E(u_t) = 0 (i) and E(u_t|x) = 0 (which is implied by E(u_t) = 0 and no perfect multicollinearity).
- **Unbiasedness**: Requires E(u_t) = 0 (i) and no perfect multicollinearity.
- **Efficiency**: Requires homoscedasticity (ii) and no autocorrelation (iii).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)**  
  This includes all four assumptions, which are necessary for the Gauss-Markov theorem to hold. However, the OLS estimator is efficient only if the errors are normally distributed (iv), homoscedastic (ii), and uncorrelated (iii). The normality assumption is not required for the Gauss-Markov theorem to hold, but it is necessary for the OLS estimator to be efficient.

- **B: (i), (iii), and (iv) only**  
  This omits assumption (ii), which is necessary for the OLS estimator to be efficient.

- **C: (ii) and (iv) only**  
  This omits assumption (i), which is necessary for the OLS estimator to be unbiased and consistent.

- **D: (i), (ii), and (iii) only**  
  This omits assumption (iv), which is necessary for the OLS estimator to be efficient.

- **E: (ii) and (iii) only**  
  This omits assumption (i), which is necessary for the OLS estimator to be unbiased and consistent.

- **F: (i) and (ii) only**  
  This omits assumptions (iii) and (iv), which are necessary for the OLS estimator to be efficient.

- **G: (iii) and (iv) only**  
  This omits assumption (i), which is necessary for the OLS estimator to be unbiased and consistent.

- **H: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only**  
  This omits assumption (i), which is necessary for the OLS estimator to be unbiased and consistent.

- **J: (i) and (iii) only**  
  This omits assumptions (ii) and (iv), which are necessary for the OLS estimator to be efficient.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **A: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)**. All four assumptions are necessary for the OLS estimator to be unbiased, consistent, and efficient. The normality assumption (iv) is required for the OLS estimator to be efficient, but it is not required for the Gauss-Markov theorem to hold. The other assumptions are required for the OLS estimator to be unbiased and consistent.
