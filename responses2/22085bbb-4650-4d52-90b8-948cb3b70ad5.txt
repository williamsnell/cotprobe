Alright, so I've got this function here: h(x) = sqrt(25 - x²) + sqrt(-(x - 2)). I need to find the domain of this function and then determine the width of the interval. Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

First, the domain of a function is all the real numbers x for which the function is defined. Since this function has two square roots, both expressions inside the square roots must be non-negative because you can't take the square root of a negative number in real numbers.

Let me tackle each square root separately. Starting with the first one: sqrt(25 - x²). For this to be defined, 25 - x² must be greater than or equal to zero. So I can write that as:

25 - x² ≥ 0

Which simplifies to:

x² ≤ 25

Taking the square root of both sides, that means:

|x| ≤ 5

So x can be between -5 and 5, inclusive. So the first part of the domain is x ∈ [-5, 5].

Now the second square root: sqrt(-(x - 2)). Let's rewrite that to make it clearer. The expression inside is -(x - 2), which can be written as (-x + 2) or (2 - x). For the square root to be defined, this must be greater than or equal to zero:

2 - x ≥ 0

Which simplifies to:

x ≤ 2

So the second part of the domain is x ≤ 2.

Now, to find the domain of the entire function h(x), I need the values of x that satisfy both conditions. That is, x has to be in the intersection of [-5,5] and (-∞, 2]. So let's visualize this.

The first interval is from -5 to 5, and the second is up to 2. The overlapping part is from -5 to 2. So the domain is x ∈ [-5, 2].

Wait, but I should double-check. The first condition is x² ≤ 25, which is correct. The second condition is x ≤ 2, so the overlapping region is indeed from -5 to 2.

Now, the width of this interval. The domain is from -5 to 2. The width is the upper bound minus the lower bound. So 2 - (-5) equals 7. But wait, the answer options don't have 7 as the correct width. Let me check.

The options are A:22, B:15, C:20, D:30, E:25, F:5, G:2, H:12, I:10, J:7.

Wait, so 7 is option J. But wait, did I do everything correctly? Let's reevaluate.

Wait, the second square root condition: sqrt(-(x - 2)) = sqrt(2 - x). So 2 - x ≥ 0 → x ≤ 2. That's correct. So the domain is x from -5 to 2. So 2 - (-5) is 7, which is the width. So why is option J the answer?

Wait, no, the question says the interval's width. The interval is from -5 to 2, so the width is 2 - (-5) = 7. So that's 7 units wide. But wait, looking back, option J is 7. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the domain.

Wait, maybe I should draw the intervals. The first condition gives x between -5 and 5, the second gives x ≤ 2. The intersection is x between -5 and 2. So the width is 2 - (-5) = 7. So the width is 7, so option J.

But wait, wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the math again.

Wait, 2 - (-5) is 7, yes. So the width is 7. So the correct answer would be option J:7.

Wait but looking back at the problem, the two square roots are sqrt(25 -x²) and sqrt(-(x -2)). So the first square root requires 25 - x² ≥0 → x² ≤25 → -5 ≤x ≤5. The second square root requires -(x-2) ≥0 → 2 -x ≥0 → x ≤2. So the domain is x ∈ [-5, 2]. So the width is 2 - (-5) = 7.

So the correct answer is J:7.
</think>

The domain of the function \( h(x) = \sqrt{25 - x^2} + \sqrt{-(x - 2)} \) is determined by ensuring both square roots are defined. 

1. For \( \sqrt{25 - x^2} \), \( 25 - x^2 \geq 0 \) leads to \( x \in [-5, 5] \).
2. For \( \sqrt{-(x - 2)} \), \( -(x - 2) \geq 0 \) simplifies to \( x \leq 2 \).

The intersection of these domains is \( x \in [-5, 2] \), giving a width of \( 2 - (-5) = 7 \).

Answer: J
