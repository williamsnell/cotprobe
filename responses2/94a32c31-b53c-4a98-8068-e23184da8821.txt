Question:

A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order

Options:

A: valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.
B: valid, because the President can repurpose federal agencies for emergency relief efforts.
C: invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.
D: invalid, because the executive order did not specify the scope of the relief operations.
E: invalid, because the executive order infringes upon the rights of federal employees.
F: invalid, because the INS does not have jurisdiction in foreign countries.
G: valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.
H: valid, because the president's executive power extends to directing federal agencies in times of crisis.
I: valid, because the President has the power to issue executive orders in times of emergency.
J: invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about an executive order by the President and whether it's valid for federal employees to comply with it. The question is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the context. The scenario is about a foreign country experiencing a devastating earthquake. The leaders of both countries are involved, with the U.S. providing aid. The President initially wanted to send troops, but they were on training. Instead, the U.S. sent federal employees to help with the relief efforts.

The key point is about the executive order's validity. The federal agency's main function is to patrol borders and prevent illegal aliens, so their role is more about border control than assisting in aid operations. The employee in question refused compliance and sued the President's order, claiming it exceeded his job responsibilities.

Now, the question is about the validity of the executive order. The options involve whether the order is valid, how much it's allowed, etc.

I remember that in the United States, federal employees typically have the authority to assist in emergencies. But I also recall something about the executive order's authority. The Constitution gives the president broad authority, but federal employees can't abuse their authority beyond what's authorized by Congress.

So, the federal agency's role is to prevent illegal immigration, not to assist in aid. Therefore, the order to send employees to help is probably outside their scope. That would make the order invalid because employees aren't supposed to be forced to do something they aren't allowed to do.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the order infringes on the rights of employees. That seems correct because the federal agency is not supposed to assist in aid operations. So employees shouldn't be required to do that.

Option F says the INS doesn't have jurisdiction, but the question is about the President, not the INS. So F is probably not the right answer.

Option G says employees can be required to perform such functions. I don't think federal employees have that authority. They have to follow orders given by Congress and the president, but they shouldn't have the power to assist in aid operations.

Option A talks about the President's authority. I thought federal employees can do that, but perhaps the executive order is over the head. Maybe the President's authority is limited.

Option C says the order is invalid without congressional authorization. That doesn't seem right because the President has authority over federal agencies. Unless the order is a threat, but it's more of a need for aid.

Option I and J are about the President's authority, but they don't address whether employees can be forced to comply.

So, the most accurate answer is E: the order is invalid because it infringes on employees' rights.

The correct answer is E: the executive order is invalid because it infringes upon the rights of federal employees. Federal employees are not allowed to be compelled to perform actions beyond their scope, which includes assisting in aid operations, as their role is to prevent illegal immigration rather than aid in emergencies. 

Answer: E
