Okay, so I've got this question about the Premack Principle and how it modifies behavior. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to think it through. Let me remember what I know about the Premack Principle.

The Premack Principle is about modifying behavior through reinforcement. I think it's part of behavioral psychology. The key idea is that when a behavior is reinforced, it's more likely to occur again. So, the reinforcer must be something that gets associated with the behavior.

Looking at the options:

A: verbal praise or encouragement. That's one of the main reinforcement types. But I'm not sure if that's the specific reinforcer in the Premack Principle. I think Premack's approach is more about the structure of the reinforcement, perhaps.

B: a behavior that occurs frequently. Hmm, that's about frequency. Premack's approach is about the structure, not just how often it happens.

C: a specific reward given after the desired behavior. That sounds familiar. I think Premack's model involves giving a specific reward after the desired behavior is achieved, which is called a reinforcer in this context. So this might be the correct answer, but I need to check the others.

D: a stimulus that is artificially created. Wait, that's more about creating stimuli. Premack's approach is about modifying existing behaviors, so I don't think it's about creating new stimuli.

E: a generalized conditioned reinforcer. That's part of the generalization theory, which is a different approach, not the Premack Principle. So probably not E.

F: a stimulus that naturally elicits the desired behavior. That's the natural reinforcement. Premack's approach is more about the structure, not the natural occurrence.

G: a behavior that occurs rarely. Hmm, maybe. Some reinforcement theories focus on the frequency, but Premack's is about the structure.

H: a negative reinforcement. That's the opposite of positive reinforcement. Premack's model is about removing or avoiding negative aspects, not reinforcing negative behavior.

I: a punishment that follows the undesired behavior. That's negative punishment, which is opposite of the Premack's approach of removing negative reinforcement.

J: applied intermittently. That's more about the schedule of reinforcement, like interval scheduling. Not the specific reinforcer in the Premack's main model.

So, the key point for Premack's Model is that the reinforcer is a specific reward given after the desired behavior. That's option C.

Wait, let me think again. Premack's model has two parts: structure and function. The structure includes the reinforcer, which is a specific reward after the desired behavior, and the function is to remove negative reinforcement. So yes, C is the correct answer.

The correct answer is C: a specific reward given after the desired behavior.

**Answer: C**
