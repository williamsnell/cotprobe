Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating how many cars the students need to sell to make a $7,000 gross profit. Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

First, I need to understand what each part of the problem contributes to the profit. The students paid $600 to rent a barn. Then, they bought cars for $250 each, and materials for each car cost $410. So, the total cost per car includes both the cost of the car and the materials. 

Gross profit is calculated by subtracting all the costs from the revenue generated from selling the cars. So, the formula for gross profit is:

Gross Profit = (Selling Price per Unit × Number of Units Sold) - Total Costs

The total costs here are the fixed cost (the barn rental) plus the variable costs (the cost per car and materials per car). Wait, but wait—each car has a variable cost. Let me think. So, for each car, the cost is $250 (car) plus $410 (materials), which totals $660 per car. But wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because per car, it's the cost of the car plus materials. So for each car, the variable cost is $250 + $410 = $660. But, wait, actually, the $600 is a fixed cost, regardless of how many cars you make. So, the total cost is $600 (fixed) + (number of cars × $660). 

But wait, wait, no. Wait, let me make sure. The problem says they paid $600 to rent the barn. That's a one-time expense. Then, for each car, the cost is $250 for the car plus $410 materials. So for each car, the variable cost is $250 + $410 = $660. So the total cost is $600 (fixed) plus (number of cars × $660). 

Now, each car is sold for $1,440. So the revenue per car is $1,440. 

The total gross profit is the total revenue minus total costs. They want this to be $7,000.

So let me set up the equation:

Revenue - Total Costs = Desired Profit

Revenue = 1,440 × Q (where Q is the number of cars sold)
Total Costs = 600 + (660 × Q)
Desired Profit = 7,000

So plugging in:

1,440Q - (600 + 660Q) = 7,000

Let me simplify this equation. 

1,440Q - 600 - 660Q = 7,000

Combine like terms:

(1,440 - 660)Q - 600 = 7,000 → 780Q - 600 = 7,000

Now, add 600 to both sides:

780Q = 7,600

Wait, 7,000 plus 600 is 7,600. So, 780Q = 7,600.

Then, Q = 7,600 / 780.

Let me compute that. Let's see, 780 × 9 is 7,020. 7,600 minus 7,020 is 580. So 9 and 580/780. Simplify 580/780: divide numerator and denominator by 10: 58/78. Then divide by 2: 29/39. So Q is 9 and 29/39. Since you can't sell a fraction of a car, you'd need to round up to the next whole number, which is 10.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I mix up variables. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the profit per car.

Profit per car = Selling Price - (Car Cost + Materials)

So per car:

$1,440 - ($250 + $410) = $1,440 - $660 = $780 per car.

So each car contributes $780 to the profit. But wait, the fixed cost is $600, so we need to cover that.

So the total profit needed is $7,000. So the equation is:

Total profit = (Number of cars × profit per car) - Fixed cost.

So,

7,000 = (Q × 780) - 600

Then,

7,000 + 600 = Q × 780 → 7,600 = 780Q → Q = 7,600 / 780.

Which is the same as before. So 7,600 divided by 780.

Let me compute 7,600 ÷ 780. Let's see:

780 × 9 = 7,020. 7,600 -7,020 = 580. 580 is 580, and 780 × 0.74 is about 580 (since 780 × 0.7 is 546, and 780 × 0.04=31.2, so 546+31.2=577.2). So approximately 0.74. So total Q is 9.74.

Since you can't sell 0.74 of a car, you round up to 10. But wait, the options don't have 10 as the correct answer. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A:12, B:15, C:11, D:7, E:16, F:13, G:8, H:9, I:10, J:14.

So 10 is option I. But wait, but wait—maybe I made a mistake in the per-car profit calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate per-car profit.

Selling price is $1,440. Cost per car is $250 + $410 = $660. So profit per car is 1440 - 660 = 780. That's correct.

So 7,000 profit. So equation is 780Q - 600 = 7,000 → 780Q = 7,600 → Q=7,600/780.

7,600 divided by 780: Let's calculate that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 760 / 78.

78 × 9 = 702, 760-702=58. So 9 and 58/78. 58/78 simplifies to 29/39, which is approximately 0.7436. So Q≈9.7436. So you need to sell 10 cars.

Wait, but wait another thing—could the fixed cost be considered differently? Or maybe I have the profit equation wrong. Let me think again.

The total cost is fixed (600) plus variable (660 per car). Revenue is 1440 per car × Q.

So profit = 1440Q - (600 + 660Q) = (1440 - 660) Q - 600 = 780 Q - 600.

Set equal to 7,000: 780 Q = 7,600 → Q=7,600/780.

Let me compute 7600 ÷ 780. Let me compute 780 × 9 = 7,020. 7,600 - 7,020 = 580. 580 ÷780 is approximately 0.7436. So total 9.7436. So, 10 cars.

Wait, but the options don't have 10 as the correct answer. Wait, looking back at the options, option I is 10. So the answer should be I:10.

But wait, the options are labeled A to J. Option I is 10. So the answer should be I:10.

Wait, but the options in the problem are A to J, right? So the options are: A:12, B:15,..., I:10, J:14.

Wait, but I'm getting 10, which is option I. So the answer is I. But looking back, the options are labeled from A to J, so the correct option is I. But the initial setup seems correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I calculate profit per car correctly? 1440 - 660 is 780. Yes. So 780 per car. So 780Q is the total revenue. Subtract fixed cost 600, so 780Q -600 = 7,000 → 780Q=7,600 → Q=7,600/780.

Wait, 7,600 divided by 780. Let me compute this step by step.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 760/78.

78 × 9 =702, 760-702=58.

So 9 with 58 left. 58 ÷78 is 0.743 approximately. So 9.743.

So Q must be 10, since you can't sell 0.74 of a car. So 10 cars. So the correct answer is I:10.

Wait, but the options are A to J, and option I is 10. So the answer is I.
