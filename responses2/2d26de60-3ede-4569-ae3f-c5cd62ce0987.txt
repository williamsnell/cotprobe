The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A witness sees a murder in the park and is called to testify in the criminal case. Can the defense attorney ask her on cross examination about her habit of feeding the pigeons? The defense knows that she was cited several times for illegally feeding the pigeons. Defense counsel tries to ask, "You have a longtime habit of feeding the pigeons, don't you? You have in fact been ticketed several times for feeding pigeons, haven't you, and yet you persisted in doing it, isn't that so?" Will the trial court likely allow the witness to be questioned on these matters?

Options:

A: Yes, because the statement indicates that the witness' attention was always focused on feeding the pigeons.
B: No, because the witness's actions outside of the crime scene have no bearing on their ability to testify.
C: Yes, because the defense has the right to question a witness about any topic.
D: No, because the defense is attempting to discredit the witness in an unrelated matter.
E: No, because a witness can never be asked about personal prior bad acts.
F: Yes, because the act of feeding pigeons could potentially distract the witness from accurately observing the events.
G: No, because the question has no probative value regarding the credibility of the witness or the guilt of the defendant.
H: Yes, because feeding pigeons in the park and persisting in it after being ticketed may show an antisocial trait of the witness.
I: Yes, because it demonstrates a pattern of breaking the law, which may affect the witness's credibility.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal evidence, specifically about a witness and cross-examination. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a witness who's been cited for feeding pigeons multiple times. The defense attorney wants to know if the witness can be questioned about her habit. The defense knows she was ticketed several times because of this behavior.

Hmm, I remember that in criminal law, witnesses can be questioned about their past actions, provided that the actions don't directly relate to the crime. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact rules here. Let me think.

So the witness was in the park, saw the murder, and is now being asked about her feeding the pigeons. The defense is trying to get her to answer about how long she's done it. The witness is cited for this, which I think means she's considered a suspect or an individual with a criminal history.

I think the key here is whether her actions are directly related to the crime. If her feeding the pigeons is about the murder, then it's relevant. But if it's unrelated, like a personal habit, maybe it's okay. Wait, but the defense is trying to get her on cross about this habit, so it's an attempt to discredit her.

Wait, but the witness can still be questioned about any topic that relates to the crime. Oh, but wait, the defense is trying to get her to answer about it. So does that count as cross-examination of a witness, which is allowed?

Another point: the defense is using this as a way to discredit her. Does that affect the trial? I think the trial court has to decide whether the witness's testimony is credible. If the witness's behavior is connected to the crime, then the defense might have a case. But the defense is trying to get her on cross about it, so is that within the bounds?

Wait, the defense's attempt to get her on cross is probably not allowed because it could be seen as an attack on her credibility. I remember something about the defense not being allowed to ask the witness about personal habits because they're personal and could be used against them.

So the options: The question is whether the defense can ask her about this habit. Since the defense is trying to get it out, it's probably not allowed. So the answer is B or E.

Looking at the options:

B: No, because the witness's actions outside the crime are irrelevant.
E: No, because the witness can't be asked about personal bad acts.

I think both B and E are correct, but the question is about the defense's intent. The defense is attempting to get her on cross, so it's probably not allowed. So the court would probably say no, because the witness's personal habits could be used against them.

So the answer is B or E. Wait, the options are:

A: Yes, because the statement indicates the attention was always on pigeons.
B: No, because actions outside the crime are irrelevant.
C: Yes, defense can question any topic.
D: No, because defense is attempting to discredit unrelated matter.
E: No, witness can't be asked about personal bad acts.
F: Yes, because pigeons could distract witness from events.
G: No, question has no probative value.
H: Yes, showing antisocial traits.
I: Yes, showing a pattern of breaking the law.

Wait, the question is whether the defense can ask about the habit, regardless of whether it's related. But the defense is trying to get her on cross about it. So the answer is likely B or E.

Wait, but another rule I remember is that the defense can't question a witness about anything personal or that's unrelated to the crime because it could be used. Oh, but the defense is trying to get her to explain her habit, which is personal. So the defense's intent is probably against the rule, so the court would say no.

So between B and E, the correct answer would be E: No, because the witness can't be asked about personal prior bad acts. But wait, another point: the defense is using this as a method to discredit her. The question is about whether the witness can be questioned on these matters. So the defense's intent is about cross-examining her about this, which is probably not allowed.

So the answer is E.

The witness's habit of feeding pigeons is being questioned in cross-examination. The defense intends to get her on cross about this behavior, which could be used to discredit her. According to legal principles, witnesses cannot be asked about personal or unrelated past activities, even if related to the crime. Therefore, the defense's intent to ask about this habit is deemed against the rules. The correct answer is:

**E: No, because a witness cannot be asked about personal prior bad acts.**

Answer:
E
