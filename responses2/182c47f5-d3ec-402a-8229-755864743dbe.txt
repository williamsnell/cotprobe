Okay, so I've got this problem here about forming a team. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The company has 8 employees: 3 managers and 5 engineers. I need to find out how many different ways there are to form a team of 4 employees that includes at least 1 manager and at least 2 engineers. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, okay. So, the team must have at least one manager and at least two engineers. Let me break this down. Since the team is 4 people, and there are 3 managers and 5 engineers, I need to make sure that the team composition meets those two conditions.

Wait, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of possible teams and then subtract the ones that don't meet the criteria. Alternatively, I can directly count the valid teams that satisfy both conditions. Let's think about which approach is more straightforward.

The problem is about combinations because the order of selection doesn't matter. So, I should use combinations here. The total number of ways to choose 4 people from 8 is C(8,4). But wait, that's the total. But I need to consider the constraints on the number of managers and engineers.

Let me think about the possible valid team compositions. Since there are 3 managers and 5 engineers, and the team needs at least 1 manager and 2 engineers, let's list the possible team sizes that satisfy these constraints.

The team has 4 members. So, the possible breakdowns are:

- 1 manager and 3 engineers: 1M, 3E
- 2 managers and 2 engineers: 2M, 2E
- 3 managers and 1 engineer: 3M, 1E

But wait, the problem says at least 1 manager and at least 2 engineers. So, the breakdowns are only the ones I listed above because 3 managers and 1 engineer would mean 3 engineers, which is acceptable since the requirement is at least 2.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. If I have 3 managers and 1 engineer, that's 4 people. 3 >=1 manager (satisfies) and 1 >=2 engineers? No, 1 is less than 2, so that's invalid. So only the first two options are valid.

Wait a minute, no—wait. The team must have at least 2 engineers. So 3M and 1E would have only 1 engineer, which doesn't meet the requirement of at least 2. So that's invalid. So the only valid breakdowns are 1M and 3E, or 2M and 2E.

Wait, no, another possibility: Could there be a 3M and 1E? No, because 1E is less than 2, so that's invalid. Similarly, 0M and 4E is invalid because there are only 3 managers. So only the two options I mentioned.

So now, I can calculate the number of ways for each valid breakdown and sum them up.

First breakdown: 1M and 3E.

The number of ways to choose 1M from 3 is C(3,1). The number of ways to choose 3E from 5 is C(5,3). So the total for this case is C(3,1)*C(5,3).

Second breakdown: 2M and 2E.

Number of ways to choose 2M from 3 is C(3,2), and 2E from 5 is C(5,2). So the total for this case is C(3,2)*C(5,2).

I'll calculate each part.

Calculating C(3,1): 3 choose 1 is 3.

C(5,3): 5 choose 3. Let me compute 5*4*3/(3*2*1) = 10.

So 3 * 10 = 30.

For the second case, C(3,2): 3 choose 2 is 3.

C(5,2): 5*4/(2*1) = 10.

So 3 * 10 = 30.

Adding both cases together: 30 + 30 = 60. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, 60 is option E.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check. Because the total for 4 people, with 3M and 5E, the possible teams are:

Option 1: 1M,3E → C(3,1)*C(5,3) = 3*10=30.

Option 2: 2M,2E → C(3,2)*C(5,2)=3*10=30.

So total is 30+30=60.

Wait, but option J is 40, and E is 60. So that would be the correct answer, which is 60.

Alternatively, maybe I missed another possible breakdown. Let me think again. Could there be a 3M and 1E? That would have 1E, which is less than 2, so it's invalid. What about 0M and 4E? No, because there are only 3M. So no.

Another possibility: 4M and ... but no, we don't have enough M's. So the only options are the two I considered. So 60 is the answer. Looking at the options, E is 60.

The correct answer is E: 60. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **1M and 3E**: C(3,1) * C(5,3) = 3 * 10 = 30.
2. **2M and 2E**: C(3,2) * C(5,2) = 3 * 10 = 30.

Total = 30 + 30 = 60.

Answer: E.60
