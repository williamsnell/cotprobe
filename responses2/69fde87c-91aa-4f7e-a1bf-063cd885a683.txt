Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about resistors and how their resistance changes when you alter their dimensions. Let's try to figure this out. I remember from my notes that resistance is related to the material of the conductor, its length, and its cross-sectional area. The formula for resistance is R = (ρ * L) / A, where ρ is the resistivity, L is the length, and A is the area.

The problem says the conductor has diameter d and length l, and its resistance is R. So initially, R = (ρ * l) / A_initial. Now, the diameter is halved and the length is doubled. So what's the new resistance?

Wait, diameter is d, so the radius would be r = d/2. Then the area A is πr², which is π(d/2)² = πd²/4. 

If the diameter is halved, the new diameter is d/2, so the new radius is (d/2)/2 = d/4. The new area would be π*(d/4)² = πd²/16. So the new area is (1/4)² times the original area. That's 1/16 of the original area.

The length is doubled, so new length L' = 2l.

Putting it into the resistance formula: R' = (ρ * L') / A' = (ρ * 2l) / ( (πd²/16) ). Wait no, wait: Initially, the area was π(d/2)^2, so the initial area A_initial is πd²/4. 

So substituting, R' = (ρ * 2l) / ( (πd²/16) ) → same as (ρ * 2l) * (16/πd²) → 32ρ l/(πd²). 

But the original R was (ρ l)/(π d²/4) → which is (ρ l * 4)/(π d²) → (4ρ l)/(π d²). So R' is (32)/(π d²) ρ l, but original R is (4ρ l)/(π d²). So R' is 32/(4) R = 8R? Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate. Original R is (ρ l) / (π (d/2)^2) → ρ l / (π d² /4) → 4ρ l / (π d²). So R is 4ρ l/(π d²).

After changing diameter to d/2 and length to 2l, the new area is π (d/2 /2)^2 → π (d/4)^2 → π d² /16. So new area is A' = π d² /16.

New length is L' = 2l.

So R' = (ρ * 2l) / (π d² /16) ) → (2ρ l *16)/(π d²) → 32 ρ l / (π d²).

Compare to R, which is 4ρ l / (π d²). So R' = (32/4) R → 8R.

Wait, but wait a second. That would mean the new resistance is 8 times the original. But let me think again.

Wait, the formula for R is R = ρ L/(A). So when you halve the diameter, the radius is halved, so area becomes (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of the original. So area decreases. Length is doubled. So R = ρ * 2L / ( (1/4) A ) → ρ * 2L *4 / (A) → 8ρ L/(A) → 8R.

So the new resistance is 8 times R, which would make option B (R/2) incorrect, E is 4R? No, E is 4R. Wait, wait. Wait, 8R is option J? Let me check the options.

Options are:

A: R/4

B: R/2

C: 1/2 R

D: 1/4 R

E: 4R

F: 2R

G: 8R

H: R

I: 1/8 R

J: 1/8 R

Wait, no, option G is 8R. So according to my calculation, R' is 8R. So the correct answer would be G, 8R. But wait, the options give J as 1/8 R. Did I get the formula wrong?

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, original R = ρ l / (π d²/4) → (ρ l *4)/(π d²) → 4ρ l/(π d²).

After changing, new R = (ρ * 2l) / ( π (d/2)^2 ) → (ρ * 2l) / ( π d²/4 ) → (ρ * 2l * 4) / ( π d² ) → 8 ρ l / ( π d² ) → which is 8R.

So yes, the new resistance is 8R.

Looking at the options, option G is 8R.

To determine how the resistance of a conductor changes when its diameter is halved and its length is doubled, we use the formula for resistance:

\[
R = \frac{\rho L}{A}
\]

where \( \rho \) is the resistivity, \( L \) is the length, and \( A \) is the cross-sectional area. The cross-sectional area of a conductor is proportional to the square of its radius (\( A \propto d^2 \)).

### Initial Conditions:
- Diameter: \( d \), so radius \( r = d/2 \)
- Cross-sectional area: \( A_{\text{initial}} = \pi r^2 = \pi (d/2)^2 = \pi d^2 / 4 \)
- Resistance: \( R = \frac{\rho l}{A_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{\rho l}{\pi d^2 / 4} = \frac{4 \rho l}{\pi d^2} \)

### After Changes:
- Diameter is halved: new diameter \( d' = d/2 \), new radius \( r' = d/4 \)
- New cross-sectional area: \( A_{\text{new}} = \pi (d/4)^2 = \pi d^2 / 16 \)
- Length is doubled: new length \( l' = 2l \)

### New Resistance:
\[
R' = \frac{\rho l'}{A_{\text{new}}} = \frac{\rho (2l)}{\pi d^2 / 16} = \frac{2 \rho l \cdot 16}{\pi d^2} = \frac{32 \rho l}{\pi d^2}
\]

### Comparison:
The original resistance is \( R = \frac{4 \rho l}{\pi d^2} \). Substituting this into the expression for \( R' \):

\[
R' = \frac{32 \rho l}{\pi d^2} = 8 \cdot \frac{4 \rho l}{\pi d^2} = 8R
\]

Thus, the new resistance is \( 8R \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **G: 8R Ω**.
