Okay, so I have this question about whether a certain encryption scheme is CPA (chosen plaintext attack) secure. Let me try to break it down.

The encryption scheme EE is defined as E(k, m) = [r ← R, output (r, F(k, r) ⊕ m)]. So for each message m, you pick a random r and output a ciphertext which is r concatenated with F(k, r) XOR m.

The question is whether this is CPA secure. So, the options involve whether the sizes of K, R, and M matter, and whether F being a strong or weak PRF affects this.

First, I remember that for a scheme to be CPA secure, it needs to prevent an attacker from choosing different plaintexts and getting the same ciphertext. Since the encryption here uses a random r for each message, the attacker can't directly get information about m by looking at the ciphertext. But let's think about the specifics.

The encryption function takes a random r and produces the ciphertext. So for each encryption, the attacker has to choose a different r each time, but the same k. Wait, no, in this case, the attacker can't choose k because k is fixed when the key is given. Or wait, in the encryption, the key is fixed (k) and the attacker can't choose it. So the attacker is trying to guess m by seeing the ciphertext.

Wait, no. Wait, no, in this case, the encryption is E(k, m) = (r, F(k, r) XOR m). So for a given k, the attacker can choose different r's to encrypt different m's. But for different m's, the same k is used. So an attacker who can see multiple encryptions can get some information.

Wait, but let me think about the CPA model. In a CPA, the adversary picks a plaintext m0 and m1, and gets its ciphertext, then tries to determine which one was encrypted. The encryption here is E(k, m) = (r, F(k, r) XOR m). So for each encryption, the attacker has to choose a new r each time. So the same r is used for the same key k.

So for each encryption, the attacker must choose a different r each time, but the same k. So for each encryption, the ciphertext is (r, F(k, r) XOR m). So when the attacker, say, gets two encryptions, m1 and m2, with the same key k, the ciphertexts would be (r1, F(k, r1) XOR m1) and (r2, F(k, r2) XOR m2). Can the attacker combine these to deduce m1 or m2?

Wait, but the attacker has to choose m0 and m1, but the encryption for m0 is (r0, F(k, r0) XOR m0). So for each encryption, the attacker has to get two different ciphertexts, each for different m's, but same key.

Alternatively, the attacker could choose m0 and m1, and get their encryptions. Then, for each, there's a chance of the ciphertexts having certain properties. But how does that help?

Wait, perhaps the question is whether the system is secure. Let's think about the case where the attacker has access to both m0 and m1, and knows their encryptions. Suppose m0 is being encrypted with r0 and m1 with r1. Then, from the encryption, the attacker can get F(k, r0) XOR m0 and F(k, r1) XOR m1. But without knowing r0 or r1, it's hard to see a pattern.

But wait, for a secure PRF F, F(k, r) is a pseudorandom function. So, for two different r's, the outputs F(k, r0) and F(k, r1) are likely to be different and unpredictable.

So, suppose an attacker, seeing two ciphertexts (r0, F(k, r0) XOR m0) and (r1, F(k, r1) XOR m1), would try to find a relationship between m0 and m1.

But since m0 and m1 are different, the attacker can't directly infer anything from the ciphertexts. So the only way the attacker can get information is if there's a way to combine the encryptions. But since the attacker doesn't know r0 or r1, and F is a strong PRF, the outputs are random.

Wait, but for the encryption, if the attacker knows both ciphertexts, they can compute the XOR of the two ciphertexts' second parts. Let's see: ciphertext1 is (r0, F(k, r0) XOR m0), ciphertext2 is (r1, F(k, r1) XOR m1). The second parts are (F(k, r0) XOR m0) and (F(k, r1) XOR m1). So XORing these gives F(k, r0) XOR F(k, r1) XOR m0 XOR m1.

But the attacker doesn't know r0 or r1, and doesn't know F(k, r0) or F(k, r1). So unless the attacker can somehow deduce m0 XOR m1, but that's not directly possible.

Wait, but let me think about the case where the attacker chooses m0 and m1, and gets their encryptions. Then, the attacker can compute F(k, r0) = cipher1[0] XOR m0, and F(k, r1) = cipher2[0] XOR m1. Then, since F(k, r0) and F(k, r1) are both outputs of the PRF, which is secure, they should be random and unpredictable. So without knowing r0 or r1, the attacker can't find a relationship between m0 and m1.

Wait, but wait, the encryption is E(k, m) = (r, F(k, r) XOR m). So for the same k, each encryption uses a different r. So the attacker has to choose different r's for different m's. Or wait, no, it's not per m; it's per encryption. So for each encryption, the attacker can choose a different r, but the same key k.

Wait, no, the attacker might have to choose a new m each time, but for each m, they have to use a specific r. So the attacker is trying to find a way to get information about m.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the encryption is E(k, m) = (r, F(k, r) XOR m). So for each message m, the encryption is done with a random r, but the same k. So for an attacker, when trying to determine m, they can get multiple ciphertexts.

But the way the encryption is constructed, each encryption is a pair (r, F(k, r) XOR m). So for different messages m, the same key k is used in F(k, r). So, if the attacker has two encryptions for m0 and m1, they can get two ciphertexts (r0, F(k, r0) XOR m0) and (r1, F(k, r1) XOR m1). The attacker can then XOR the second parts to get F(k, r0) XOR F(k, r1) XOR (m0 XOR m1).

But without knowing F(k, r0) or F(k, r1), or r0 or r1, this doesn't help. So the attacker can't directly find m0 XOR m1 from this.

Wait, but perhaps there's a way for the attacker to get m. Let's say the attacker chooses a message m' and tries to find out m. But in the encryption, the second part is F(k, r) XOR m. So if the attacker knows F(k, r) for some r, they can find m as F(k, r) XOR ciphertext_part2. But if the attacker can't find F(k, r), they can't get m.

Wait, but maybe the attacker can get enough information by choosing m0 and m1, and seeing their encryptions. Let's think: suppose m0 is being encrypted with r0, and m1 is being encrypted with r1. The ciphertexts are (r0, F(k, r0) XOR m0) and (r1, F(k, r1) XOR m1). The attacker can compute F(k, r0) XOR F(k, r1) XOR m0 XOR m1.

But what if the attacker can somehow get m0 XOR m1? That would be a big help. But I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the attacker can only get m0 XOR m1 if they know more.

Wait, but let me think about this: if the attacker can get two encryptions, can they somehow derive m0 XOR m1? Let's see: from the two ciphertexts, the attacker can compute (F(k, r0) XOR m0) and (F(k, r1) XOR m1). Then, XORing these gives F(k, r0) XOR F(k, r1) XOR m0 XOR m1. But the attacker doesn't know F(k, r0) or F(k, r1), so they can't.

So, the encryption seems to provide no information about m0 or m1. Therefore, the system is CPA secure if the random r is chosen uniformly and never repeats, because the attacker can't choose the same r for multiple encryptions. Wait, but wait, the question is whether the system is secure against an attacker who can choose plaintexts adaptively, but in this case it's not an adaptive attack, it's a CPA where the attacker can choose messages based on the ciphertexts.

Wait no, in a CPA, the attacker can choose both messages m0 and m1 after seeing the challenge ciphertext. So, the attacker can choose m0 and m1 based on the ciphertext. So, in this case, if the attacker can choose m0 and m1 based on the ciphertext, then the encryption is vulnerable if the PRF F is not strong enough.

Wait, but what's the attacker's goal? They want to determine m0 or m1. If the encryption uses a random r, the attacker can't directly get m from the ciphertext. But wait, perhaps if the attacker can get two encryptions for the same m, they can find m.

Wait, let me think again: for a message m, the encryption is E(k, m) = (r, F(k, r) XOR m). So, for the same m, the encryption uses a random r. So for each m, the attacker can get a ciphertext (r, F(k, r) XOR m). So if the attacker chooses two different m's, say m1 and m2, and gets two encryptions, (r1, F(k, r1) XOR m1) and (r2, F(k, r2) XOR m2). The attacker can compute F(k, r1) XOR m1 and F(k, r2) XOR m2. Then, by XORing these two, they get F(k, r1) XOR F(k, r2) XOR (m1 XOR m2).

But again, without knowing r1 or r2, or F(k, r1) or F(k, r2), this doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps the attacker can only get m if they can somehow find F(k, r) for some r.

Wait, but the attacker doesn't know F(k, r) for a particular r, because F is secure but not necessarily random. So, if the attacker chooses m0 and m1, and gets their encryptions, they can't directly find m0 or m1.

Ah, but wait, the encryption is E(k, m) = (r, F(k, r) XOR m). So the second part of the ciphertext is F(k, r) XOR m. If the attacker can somehow get F(k, r) for some r, then they can compute m as F(k, r) XOR ciphertext_part2.

But the attacker can't know F(k, r) because the attacker doesn't know r. So the only way is if the attacker can find r from the ciphertext.

Wait, but r is a random value. So for each encryption, r is chosen from R. If the random r is chosen from a large enough universe, the attacker can't easily find r. But the problem is, if R is small, say, R is of size 100, then there's a 1/100 chance that the attacker can guess r. But that's not a problem for a secure PRF, because the attacker can only try a certain number of possibilities.

Wait, but the question is about whether the encryption is CPA secure. So, for each encryption, the attacker must get two messages, m0 and m1, and the ciphertexts. Then, the attacker must be able to determine which of the two is the original message.

But in this encryption, the attacker can't directly find m0 or m1 because the outputs of F(k, r) are random, so the attacker can't predict m0 or m1 from the ciphertext. So, the encryption can't allow the attacker to get information about m0 or m1.

Wait, but wait. If the PRF F is a strong PRF, then the outputs F(k, r) are indistinguishable from random. So, for any m, the second part of the ciphertext is F(k, r) XOR m, which is a random value XORed with m. So, if the attacker can get two such pairs, they can get two equations:

F(k, r0) XOR m0 = c1  
F(k, r1) XOR m1 = c2

Adding these equations (XOR-wise) gives F(k, r0) XOR F(k, r1) XOR m0 XOR m1 = c1 XOR c2.

But the attacker can't find r0 or r1, nor can they find F(k, r0) or F(k, r1). So, this doesn't help the attacker determine m0 or m1.

But wait, perhaps the attacker can get m0 and m1 by making the encryption for two different m's and then somehow using the two ciphertexts. But I don't see a direct way for the attacker to get the individual m's.

Wait, here's another angle: the encryption function is E(k, m) = (r, F(k, r) XOR m). So, for each m, the same r is used, but different m's would result in different ciphertexts. The attacker can't choose different r's because the encryption for a given m uses the same r for all encryptions of that m.

Wait, no. For each m, the encryption uses the same r. So, if the attacker chooses m0 and m1, and for each, gets an encryption with a random r, then for m0, the ciphertext is (r0, F(k, r0) XOR m0), and for m1, (r1, F(k, r1) XOR m1). But the attacker doesn't know r0 or r1, so they can't get any information from this.

Wait, but perhaps the attacker can find a way to combine the two ciphertexts to get m0 or m1. Let me see: the attacker knows F(k, r0) XOR m0 and F(k, r1) XOR m1. Adding them together (XOR-wise) gives F(k, r0) XOR F(k, r1) XOR m0 XOR m1. But that's not directly helpful.

Wait, but if the attacker can find m0 XOR m1, that would be great. But the attacker doesn't know r0 or r1, so they can't compute F(k, r0) or F(k, r1). So, this approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe the attacker can get enough information to find m0 XOR m1 by some other method. Like, if the attacker can get two encryptions for m0 and m1, and somehow find a relationship between m0 and m1.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the multiple-choice options.

The options are about whether the system is CPA secure. So, the correct options are about whether the answer depends on the size of K, R, or M.

The correct answer, I think, is that the system is not necessarily CPA secure. Because the encryption uses a random r for each encryption, and the attacker can't choose r. So, the encryption is not malleable in the way that a CPA attack would exploit.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the way the encryption is done is, for each message m, the encryption uses a random r. So for a single k, the attacker can't choose the same r for multiple encryptions. So, for example, if the attacker encrypts two different messages, each with their own random r, the attacker can't reuse r for another message.

But if the attacker wants to get m from an encryption, they can't do so because they don't know F(k, r) for any r. So, the encryption is not malleable in a way that an attacker can find m from the ciphertext.

Therefore, the system is not necessarily CPA secure. It depends on the PRF's properties. Wait, but the question is whether the system is secure, so the correct answer would be that it's not necessarily secure, depending on F's properties.

Wait, but the question is: Is EE symantically secure under CPA? So, the options are about whether this is always the case, or depends on certain factors.

The correct answer is that the system is not necessarily secure. Because the attacker can't choose the same r for multiple encryptions, and thus can't get information about m from the ciphertext.

But wait, wait, the problem is whether the system is secure against an attack that can choose the message based on the ciphertext. So, the attacker can choose m0 and m1, and get their encryptions. Then, the attacker can compute F(k, r0) and F(k, r1). But since F is a secure PRF, F(k, r) is indistinguishable from a random value. So, the attacker can't find a relationship between m0 and m1.

Wait, but if F is a pseudorandom function, then it's hard to find F(k, r) for a random r. So, if the attacker has two encryptions, and they get F(k, r0) XOR m0 and F(k, r1) XOR m1, the attacker can't directly find m0 or m1. They can't compute F(k, r0) or F(k, r1), as the attacker doesn't know r0 or r1.

Wait, but what if the attacker can somehow find m0 XOR m1? Like, if the attacker can get F(k, r0) XOR m0 and F(k, r1) XOR m1, then they can compute F(k, r0) XOR F(k, r1) XOR m0 XOR m1. But the attacker doesn't know F(k, r0) or F(k, r1), so this doesn't help.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the correct answer options. The options are about whether the system is CPA secure, and whether it depends on the size of K, R, or M.

The correct answer is that the system is not necessarily secure. Because the attacker can't choose the same r for multiple encryptions, and the encryption doesn't allow the attacker to learn m from the ciphertext. So, the only way the system is secure is if the PRF F is a strong one.

Wait, but the question is about whether the system is symmetrically secure under CPA. So, the answer is that it's not necessarily secure, depending on the PRF F.

Wait, but wait: in the encryption scheme E(k, m) = (r, F(k, r) XOR m), the same k is used for all encryptions. So, for each m, the encryption uses a random r. So, the attacker can't choose the same r for multiple m's, because they're using the same k.

Wait, but in that case, the attacker can't choose the same r for two encryptions. So, the attacker can't get two encryptions with the same r, which would allow them to compute m0 XOR m1.

Wait, but no, if the attacker chooses m0 and m1, and for each, gets an encryption with a random r, then the attacker can get two ciphertexts, each with their own random r. So, the attacker can't use the same r twice, but they can use different r's for different m's.

Wait, but the question is about the encryption scheme being CPA secure, meaning that the attacker can't find the original message from the ciphertext. So, in this scheme, the attacker can't choose the same r for multiple encryptions, but can choose different r's for different m's.

Wait, no, because for each m, the encryption uses the same k, but a different r. So, for m0, the encryption uses r0, and for m1, it uses r1, which are distinct from each other.

Wait, no, because the attacker can't choose the same r for both m0 and m1, because the encryption uses a random r for each m. Wait, no, the encryption uses a random r for the message m, but the same k. So, the attacker can't choose the same r for two encryptions. But the attacker can choose m0 and m1, and for each, get an encryption with a random r. So, the attacker can get two encryptions, each with a different r.

Wait, but the attacker can't choose the same r for both m0 and m1, because each is encrypted with a different r. But in that case, the attacker can get the two encryptions, and from each, get the ciphertext parts. Then, perhaps, the attacker can find m0 and m1.

Wait, but without knowing r0 or r1, how can the attacker find m0 or m1?

Wait, but maybe the attacker can get enough information from the two ciphertexts to find m0 XOR m1. Let's see: the two ciphertexts are (r0, F(k, r0) XOR m0) and (r1, F(k, r1) XOR m1). The attacker can compute F(k, r0) and F(k, r1) from their respective ciphertexts. Then, by XORing F(k, r0) and F(k, r1), they get F(k, r0) XOR F(k, r1). Then, the attacker can compute (F(k, r0) XOR m0) XOR (F(k, r1) XOR m1) which is F(k, r0) XOR F(k, r1) XOR m0 XOR m1. But without the attacker knowing F(k, r0) or F(k, r1), they can't compute that.

Wait, but the attacker can find m0 and m1 using the two ciphertexts. Because, for example, if the attacker chooses m0 and m1, and gets their encryptions, then they can calculate F(k, r0) XOR m0 and F(k, r1) XOR m1. Then, if the attacker can find r0 and r1, they can find F(k, r0) and F(k, r1). But since the attacker can't choose the same r0 and r1 for different m's, because they're each encrypted with a different r, the attacker can't find r0 or r1 for the same m.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me think of the multiple-choice options.

The options are:

A) The system is not symmetrically secure under chosen plaintext attack, and the size of R is unimportant.

B) The system is not symmetrically secure under chosen plaintext attack, and the size of R is important.

C) The system is not symmetrically secure under chosen plaintext attack, and the size of K is unimportant.

D) The system is not symmetrically secure under chosen plaintext attack, and the size of K is important.

E) The system is not secure under chosen plaintext attack, and the size of R is important.

So, the correct answer is that the system is not symmetrically secure under chosen plaintext attack, and the size of R is important.

Wait, why? Because the encryption uses a random r for each message, so the attacker can't choose the same r for two encryptions. Therefore, the system is not secure, and the size of R matters.

Wait, but the system is secure only if the PRF F is strong enough. But the question is, does the system's security depend on the size of R?

Wait, the answer is that the system is not secure under CPA, and the size of R matters. Because the attacker can choose different r's for different m's. For example, the attacker can choose two different messages m1 and m2, and for each, choose a random r. Then, the attacker can get two ciphertexts and can attempt to find the original m's. But without knowing F(k, r) for any r, it's impossible.

Wait, but wait. The encryption for m1 uses r1, which is different from r0 used for m0. So, the attacker can get two encryptions, each with a different r. But the attacker can't choose the same r for two different encryptions, because each is encrypted with a different r.

Wait, but how does the attacker get two encryptions? They have to choose two different messages, m0 and m1, and for each, get an encryption. But the attacker must choose both m0 and m1, and for each, get an encryption. So, the attacker can choose m0 and m1, and get two encryptions.

But the encryption for m0 uses a random r0, and the encryption for m1 uses a random r1. So, the attacker can get the two ciphertexts, but without knowing r0 and r1, they can't compute F(k, r0) or F(k, r1). So, the attacker can't find m0 or m1.

But wait, the attacker can get both ciphertexts, and then XOR them to find F(k, r0) XOR F(k, r1) XOR m0 XOR m1. But the attacker can't compute F(k, r0) XOR F(k, r1) unless they know their values, which they don't.

So, the encryption is not secure against a chosen plaintext attack, because the attacker can't find the original m from the ciphertexts.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think of the system. The encryption is E(k, m) = (r, F(k, r) XOR m). For each m, a random r is used. So, the encryption for a message m is a ciphertext where the second part is F(k, r) XOR m, and the first part is r.

So, if the attacker wants to find m from the ciphertext, they can try to compute m = F(k, r) XOR ciphertext_part2. So, m = F(k, r) XOR (F(k, r) XOR m) ? Wait, that's not correct.

Wait, no, the ciphertext is (r, F(k, r) XOR m). So, if the attacker knows F(k, r) and has the ciphertext, they can compute m as F(k, r) XOR (F(k, r) XOR m) = m. Hmm, that's not helpful.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The ciphertext is (r, F(k, r) XOR m). So, if the attacker can get the ciphertext, they can get F(k, r) XOR m. So, m = (F(k, r) XOR m) XOR F(k, r). So, m = ciphertext_part2 XOR F(k, r). But since the attacker can't know F(k, r), they can't compute m.

Wait, no, that's not right. The attacker can't compute F(k, r) because it's a random function. So, the attacker can't compute m from the ciphertext.

Wait, but then the system is not secure against a chosen plaintext attack. So, the answer would be that the system is not symmetrically secure under chosen plaintext attack, and the size of R is important.

Wait, but the options are about whether the answer depends on the size of K, R, or M.

Looking back, the correct answer is that the system is not symmetrically secure under chosen plaintext attack, and the size of R is important.

Wait, because the size of R is important. Because the attacker can choose different r's for different messages, but for a fixed R, the attacker has to choose r's from a certain set. So, the size of R determines how many r's the attacker can choose from, thus affecting the security.

So, the correct answer is option E: The system is not secure under chosen plaintext attack, and the size of R is important.

Wait, but wait. Another angle: the encryption is E(k, m) = (r, F(k, r) XOR m). So, for each m, the encryption uses a random r. So, the same k is used for all m's, but the r is different for each m.

So, for the same k, the encryption is a set of (r, F(k, r) XOR m) for each m. So, the attacker can't choose the same r for multiple m's, because each is encrypted with a different r.

Wait, but the attacker can choose m0 and m1, and for each, get an encryption with a random r. So, the attacker can get two encryptions with two different r's. But without knowing r's, the attacker can't compute F(k, r) for those r's.

Wait, but maybe the attacker can find m0 XOR m1 by combining the two ciphertexts. Let's see: the first ciphertext is (r0, F(k, r0) XOR m0), the second is (r1, F(k, r1) XOR m1). So, the attacker can compute F(k, r0) = ciphertext_part2_0 XOR m0, but without knowing m0 or r0, that's not helpful.

Wait, the attacker can't find m0 or m1, because F(k, r) is random and the attacker can't compute m0 or m1 from the ciphertext.

So, the encryption is not symmetrically secure under chosen plaintext attack. Therefore, the answer is that the system is not secure, and the size of R is important.

Wait, but the options are about whether the answer depends on the size of R, K, or M.

From the analysis, the system is not secure, and the size of R is important. So, the correct answer is E.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the possibility that the attacker can find m0 XOR m1 by combining the two ciphertexts.

The attacker has two encryptions: (r0, F(k, r0) XOR m0) and (r1, F(k, r1) XOR m1). 

The attacker computes F(k, r0) and F(k, r1). Then, the attacker computes (F(k, r0) XOR m0) XOR (F(k, r1) XOR m1) = F(k, r0) XOR F(k, r1) XOR m0 XOR m1.

But without knowing F(k, r0), F(k, r1), or m0, m1, the attacker can't compute this.

Wait, but maybe the attacker has another way to find m0 XOR m1. Let me think about XORing the two ciphertexts.

The two ciphertexts are (r0, c0) and (r1, c1), where c0 = F(k, r0) XOR m0, c1 = F(k, r1) XOR m1.

The attacker can compute c0 XOR c1 = (F(k, r0) XOR m0) XOR (F(k, r1) XOR m1) = F(k, r0) XOR F(k, r1) XOR m0 XOR m1.

But the attacker can't compute m0 XOR m1, because they don't know F(k, r0) or F(k, r1).

So, the encryption is not secure under chosen plaintext attack, and the size of R is important.

So, the correct answer is option E: The system is not secure under chosen plaintext attack, and the size of R is important.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look at the multiple-choice options again.

Option E: The system is not secure under chosen plaintext attack, and the size of R is important.

So, the correct answer is E.

Another way to think about it: the encryption uses a random r for each message. So, for each message, the encryption is a ciphertext with a random r. So, the attacker can't choose the same r for multiple messages.

Therefore, the system is not secure under chosen plaintext attack, and the size of R is important.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the correct answer is E.
</think>

The correct answer is E: "The system is not secure under chosen plaintext attack, and the size of R is important." 

### Explanation:
The encryption scheme is defined as \( E(k, m) = (r, F(k, r) \oplus m) \), where \( r \) is a random value derived from the key \( k \) for each message \( m \).

   - In a chosen plaintext attack, the attacker can choose messages to encrypt and observe the resulting ciphertexts. 
   - In this scheme, for each message \( m \), the attacker must choose a random \( r \) to encrypt it. Since each encryption uses a different \( r \), the attacker cannot encrypt multiple messages with the same \( r \).
   - Without knowing the random \( r \) used for each message, the attacker cannot compute the original message \( m \) from the ciphertext. Therefore, the encryption is not secure under a chosen plaintext attack.

2. **Importance of the Size of \( R \):**
   - The size of \( R \) (the set of possible random values for \( r \)) determines how many different \( r \) values the attacker can choose for encrypting each message.
   - If the size of \( R \) is small, the attacker has fewer options for \( r \), making it easier to decrypt the message if the encryption were secure. Conversely, a larger \( R \) allows the attacker more options, reducing the security of the encryption.
   - Thus, the size of \( R \) is crucial in determining the security of the encryption scheme against a chosen plaintext attack.

### Conclusion:
The encryption scheme is not secure under a chosen plaintext attack, and the size of \( R \) is important.
