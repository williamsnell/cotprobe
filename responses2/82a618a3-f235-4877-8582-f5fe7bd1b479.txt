Okay, so I've got this question here about converting cubic inches to cubic centimeters. Hmm, I remember that when it comes to measurements, especially units like inches and centimeters, there are conversion factors involved. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact value, so let me think this through.

The question is asking how many cubic centimeters are in one cubic inch. I know that 1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters, right? So for the linear conversion, 1 inch = 2.54 cm. But wait, that's for length, not area or volume. Oh right, because when you're dealing with volume, you have to cube the conversion factor.

So for volume, the formula would be (1 inch)^3 equals (2.54 cm)^3. Let me calculate that. 2.54 cubed is... let me do the math step by step. 2.54 * 2.54 is 6.4516, and then multiplying that by 2.54 again gives 16.387064. Oh, wait, that's approximately 16.387 cubic centimeters in a cubic inch.

Looking at the options, option F is 16.4 cc. That must be the correct answer. So the number of cubic centimeters in one cubic inch is about 16.4.
