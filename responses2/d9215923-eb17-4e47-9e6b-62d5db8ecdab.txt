Okay, so I have this question here about finding the greatest odd integer that's a factor of 5 factorial, which is written as 5!. I remember that 5! means 5 multiplied by 4, then 3, 2, and 1. So let me start by calculating 5!.

5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. Let me compute that step by step. 5 × 4 is 20, then 20 × 3 is 60, 60 × 2 is 120, and 120 × 1 is still 120. So 5! equals 120. 

Now the question is asking for the greatest odd integer that's a factor of 120. Hmm, factors are numbers that divide into 120 without leaving a remainder. So I need to find the largest one that's odd. 

I know that the largest factor of a number is the number itself, but 120 is even, so that's out. The next thought is to find the odd factors of 120.

Alternatively, maybe I can break down 120 into its prime factors and then see which combinations give me the largest odd number. Let me try that.

Breaking down 120:
120 ÷ 2 = 60
60 ÷ 2 = 30
30 ÷ 2 = 15
15 is not divisible by 2. So I've divided by 2 three times. That gives me 2^3.

Now 15 ÷ 3 = 5
5 ÷ 5 = 1

So the prime factors are 2^3 × 3 × 5.

Now, to find the odd factors, I need to exclude the powers of 2. So the odd part is 3 × 5, which is 15. So the largest odd factor is 15. Wait, but wait, 120 divided by 15 is 8, which is even, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to list all the factors of 120 and pick the largest odd one. But that might take longer. Let me think about another way.

Wait, 120 = 5! = 120. Let's list the factors of 120. The factors would be all the numbers that can multiply by another to give 120. Since 120 is even, all its factors are even except the odd ones. So the largest odd factor would be the largest factor that's not even.

Alternatively, since 120's prime factors include 2^3, 3, and 5, the largest odd factor is 3 × 5 = 15. So the answer should be 15, which is option I.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option I is 15. Let me double-check. Oh wait, the options are A:31, B:3, C:7, D:5, E:45, F:21, G:1, H:25, I:15, J:9.

So 15 is an option, option I. So that's the answer. Alternatively, another way to think is that 5! is 120. The largest odd factor must be less than or equal to 120 and an odd number. So the largest odd number that divides 120 is 15, since 15 × 8 is 120. But wait, 15 is less than 120, and indeed, 15 is an odd factor. Are there any larger odd factors? Let me see.

Wait, 15 times 2 is 30, but 30 is even. 15 times 4 is 60, which is even. 15 times 8 is 120. So 15 is the largest odd factor because the next multiples of 15 are even.

So the answer must be 15, which is option I.

The greatest odd factor of 5! (which is 120) is 15.
