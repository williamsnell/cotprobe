Okay, so I've got this question here about using the Trapezoidal rule to approximate the area under a curve. The function f(x) is given at several points: f(0)=3, f(2)=7, f(4)=11, f(6)=9, and f(8)=3. We need to approximate the area between x=0 and x=8 using n=4 subintervals. Hmmm, let's think about how I would approach this.

Wait, the Trapezoidal rule, right. I remember that it's a method to approximate the integral of a function. The basic idea is to divide the area under the curve into trapezoids and sum their areas. Since we're using n=4 subintervals, that means the interval from 0 to 8 is being divided into 4 equal parts. Let me make sure I understand the steps.

First, I need to figure out the width of each subinterval. The total interval is from 0 to 8, so that's 8 units. Divided into 4, each subinterval is 8/4 = 2 units wide. So each trapezoid will have a width (h) of 2.

Now, the Trapezoidal rule formula is something like h/2 multiplied by the sum of the function values at the endpoints of each subinterval, plus the function values at the intermediate points multiplied by some factor. Wait, no, more correctly, for each subinterval from x_i to x_{i+1}, the trapezoid area is h/2*(f(x_i) + f(x_{i+1})). So, for each pair of consecutive points, we calculate that and sum them all.

Wait, but wait, in this case, since n=4, the number of points is 5 (from 0,2,4,6,8). So, we have 4 subintervals, each of width 2. So, the trapezoidal rule formula for n subintervals is h/2 * [f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + 2f(x3) + f(x4)].

Wait, let me make sure: the formula is (h/2) * (f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + 2f(x3) + f(x4)). Because for each i from 1 to n-1, we have a term with 2f(x_i), and the endpoints contribute just once each.

So, plugging in the values:

x0 = 0, f(x0)=3
x1=2, f(x1)=7
x2=4, f(x2)=11
x3=6, f(x3)=9
x4=8, f(x4)=3

So, the formula would be (2/2) * [3 + 2*7 + 2*11 + 2*9 + 3]. Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate the sum inside the brackets:

3 + (2*7)=14, + (2*11)=22, + (2*9)=18, +3.

Wait, wait, let me write that out:

3 + 2*7 = 3 +14=17
17 + 2*11=17+22=39
39 + 2*9=39+18=57
57 +3=60.

So the sum inside the brackets is 60. Multiply by h/2, which is 2/2=1. So the total area is 1 * 60 = 60.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no, the formula is h/2 multiplied by the sum of the endpoints and twice the middle points. So, the sum is f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + 2f(x3) + f(x4). So the sum is 3 + 14 +22 + 18 +3= 3+14=17, +22=39, +18=57, +3=60.

Yes, that's correct. Multiply by h/2, which is 1, so total area is 60.

Looking at the options, option B is 60.0.

To approximate the area under the curve using the Trapezoidal rule with \( n = 4 \) subintervals, we first determine the width of each subinterval \( h = \frac{8-0}{4} = 2 \). The Trapezoidal rule formula is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{h}{2} \left[ f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + 2f(x_3) + f(x_4) \right]
\]

Substituting the given values:

- \( f(x_0) = 3 \)
- \( f(x_1) = 7 \)
- \( f(x_2) = 11 \)
- \( f(x_3) = 9 \)
- \( f(x_4) = 3 \)

The sum inside the brackets becomes:

\[
3 + 2(7) + 2(11) + 2(9) + 3 = 3 + 14 + 22 + 18 + 3 = 60
\]

Multiplying by \( \frac{h}{2} = 1 \), the total area is:

\[
\text{Area} = 1 \times 60 = 60.0
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: 60.0**
