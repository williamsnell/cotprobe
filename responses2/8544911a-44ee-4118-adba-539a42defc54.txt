Question:

An on-duty Police Officer hears breaking glass and a blaring alarm, and sees Stan run out of a darkened liquor store at 3 a.m. Stan runs around the corner, out of Officer's view, and hops into a car. Officer sees Stan drive away and pursues, lights flashing. Stan pulls over and Officer arrests him. Officer sees nothing in the passenger compartment, but pops the trunk and finds cash and a baseball bat. Stan's motion to suppress the cash and baseball bat as evidence will likely be

Options:

A: Denied, because the Officer had a reasonable suspicion that Stan was involved in a crime.
B: Granted, because the arrest was illegal and therefore the evidence is considered to be fruit of the poisonous tree.
C: Granted, because the Officer did not have a search warrant to check the trunk of the car.
D: Granted, because the Officer did not have a valid reason to pull Stan over in the first place.
E: Denied, because a search incident to a valid arrest in an automobile always includes the trunk of the automobile.
F: Denied, because the Officer had probable cause to search the trunk.
G: Denied, because the Officer had the right to search the car without a warrant.
H: Granted, because the trunk area was out of the range of Stan's control.
I: Denied, because the Officer was in the pursuit of his duties and the search was incidental to the arrest.
J: Granted, because the Officer did not observe Stan commit any crime.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about police officers and evidence. Let's read the question carefully.

The scenario is that an officer hears breaking glass and a blaring alarm, so they know Stan is involved in a crime. Stan runs out of a darkened liquor store at 3 a.m. and gets out of the officer's view. He then drives away and the officer catches up. The officer sees nothing in the passenger compartment. But when he pops the trunk, he finds cash and a baseball bat. Now, the question is about Stan's motion to suppress the evidence and whether it's granted.

The options are A through J, each giving a different reason for granting or denying the motion.

First, I remember that evidence suppression is based on whether the evidence is inadmissible under any law. The officer's actions—popping the trunk—probably involve a search. But whether it's lawful depends on the circumstances.

I think this relates to the Fourteenth Amendment, specifically the Due Process Clause. The officer has a duty to keep the officer's performing duties in check without going too far. If the officer is pursuing Stan and he's acting without a warrant, the officer might not have a search warrant for the trunk.

Wait, but in this case, the officer is using his duty to prevent further pursuit. He's seeing Stan go out of the store, so he stops him. But he's not stopping him with a search. He just lets him drive away and then checks the trunk to find evidence.

So, if the officer doesn't have a search warrant, Stan's request to suppress evidence would be denied because the evidence isn't inadmissible. But if he does have a warrant, then the evidence might be suppressed.

Wait, in this scenario, did the officer have a warrant? The question says he sees Stan running out of a darkened liquor store. The store's darkened suggests it's a place with no evidence, so the officer might have no warrant. Alternatively, the officer just knows Stan is at risk, so he can search for evidence.

Wait, another point: the officer was in pursuit, so perhaps he didn't have a warrant. But the question says he sees Stan running out, so maybe he did have a warrant because he's aware of the location. Or perhaps he doesn't have one because he's just using his duty without a warrant.

If he doesn't have a warrant, then his search for evidence isn't required. So, his request to suppress the evidence would be denied because no warrant allowed.

Looking at the options:

Option G says the officer had the right to search the car without a warrant, so the evidence wouldn't be suppressed. That makes sense.

Option H says he didn't have a valid reason to pull him over. That would mean he had a warrant, so the evidence would be suppressed.

Option B and F suggest the evidence is fruit of the poisonous tree, which is about whether the evidence is legally necessary. If the officer had a warrant, then it's necessary; if not, it's not. But the question is about Stan's motion, which is about whether the evidence is suppressed.

Wait, but the question is about the motion, so not about necessity. So, if the officer doesn't have a search warrant, then his request to suppress is denied. If he does have a warrant, then it's granted.

Wait, but in this scenario, was the officer in pursuit? If he was, he might not have a warrant. Wait, the officer is just in pursuit and stops him. He's looking for his duty without going too far, so maybe he doesn't have a warrant.

So, if he doesn't have a warrant, then his search for the trunk isn't required. So, he can't suppress the evidence, so the motion is denied. So the answer would be option A: denied, because officer had a reasonable suspicion.

Wait, but the officer's belief about Stan's involvement is a reason for a warrant. But if he doesn't have a warrant, then his search isn't required. So, the answer depends on whether he had a warrant.

Wait, but how did the officer know Stan was involved? The scenario says he heard breaking glass and a blaring alarm. That's a valid reason for him to have a warrant, right? Because breaking glass is a crime, and the alarm is a signal to stop someone.

So, if he had a warrant, then he can search the trunk and suppress the evidence. But if he doesn't have a warrant, he can't.

So, does the officer have a warrant here? The question doesn't state that he did. So, he doesn't have a warrant, so his request to suppress is denied.

So looking at the options, option A says it's denied because he had a reasonable suspicion. But the right reason is about the warrant. So if he doesn't have a warrant, it's denied.

Wait, but option G says he had the right to search without a warrant, so the evidence isn't suppressed. But that would mean he had a warrant, so the evidence is suppressed. But in this case, he didn't have a warrant.

So, the correct reasoning is that he didn't have a warrant, so the evidence isn't suppressed. Therefore, the motion is denied.

Which option says that? Option G: "Granted, because the Officer did not have a search warrant to check the trunk of the car." But that would mean the evidence is suppressed, which isn't the case.

Wait, no, option G says the officer had the right to search without a warrant, so the evidence isn't suppressed. But that would be correct only if the officer had a warrant. But if he doesn't, the evidence is inadmissible and the motion is denied.

So, the correct answer is option A because he had a reasonable suspicion, which would allow a warrant. But if he doesn't, then he doesn't have a warrant. So the correct reasoning is that he didn't have a warrant, so the motion is denied.

Wait, but option G says the officer had the right to search without a warrant, so the evidence isn't suppressed. That's correct under law only if he had a warrant. But the question is whether the officer's actions (pursuing Stan) mean he didn't have a warrant. So, if he didn't have a warrant, then the search isn't required, so the motion is denied.

So the options are:

A: Denied, because of a reasonable suspicion. 

G:Granted, because no warrant.

But in this case, the officer didn't have a warrant, so the request is denied.

So, the correct answer is option A: denied because he had a reasonable suspicion, allowing a warrant.

Wait, but that's what option G is saying, but it's about the right to search without a warrant. Hmm.

Wait, but the officer's suspicion that Stan is involved in a crime is a valid reason for a warrant. So he should have a warrant, meaning he can search the trunk. Therefore, his motion is denied.

So the correct reasoning is that the officer doesn't have a warrant, so the evidence isn't suppressed. Therefore, the answer is option G: he had the right to search without a warrant, so the evidence isn't suppressed.

Wait, but the options are about the outcome of his motion. If he doesn't have a warrant, he can't suppress the evidence. So the answer would be option A, no, because he did have a warrant (due to the breaking glass and alarm). So the correct reasoning is that he has a warrant, so the evidence is suppressed. Option G would be correct if he had a warrant.

But I'm getting confused. Let's think again. 

If the officer had a warrant, he could search the trunk, find the evidence, and suppress it.

If he didn't have a warrant, he can't search, so his motion is denied.

So the question is whether he had a warrant or not. The scenario says he hears breaking glass and an alarm, so he should have a warrant for that. Therefore, the officer can search the trunk and suppress the evidence. So the answer would be option G, which says he had the right to search without a warrant, so the evidence isn't suppressed. But that's only if he had a warrant.

Wait, no. Option G says "Granted, because the Officer did not have a valid reason to pull Stan over in the first place." So if he had no valid reason, then he doesn't have a warrant. So, if he doesn't have a warrant, he can't suppress the evidence.

So the correct reasoning is that he didn't have a warrant, so the evidence isn't suppressed. So the answer is option A: denied, because he had a reasonable suspicion that Stan was involved in a crime. Wait, but that's about the warrant, not about the search.

Alternatively, if the officer has a warrant, he can search and suppress, so the answer would be option G.

But the officer's belief in breaking glass and the alarm is a reason for having a warrant. So he should have a warrant, so the evidence is suppressed. Therefore, the answer is option G.

Wait, but G says he had the right to search without a warrant. So, if he did have a warrant due to the breaking glass, then he can search. Therefore, his motion is denied.

So, the correct answer is option A, because he had a reasonable suspicion and thus a warrant, so the search isn't needed. But that's not the case.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of this another way. The officer hears the breaking glass and alarm, so he knows Stan is at risk. He then stops him, but he doesn't go further. He just lets him go, and then he checks the trunk for evidence. 

In this scenario, he's only in pursuit and may not have a warrant. So he can't search the car, which includes the trunk. So, his request to suppress the evidence is denied because he doesn't have a warrant.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is option A: denied, because he had a reasonable suspicion that Stan was involved in a crime.

Wait, but that's about the warrant, not the search. Because he had a warrant, the evidence would be suppressed. So perhaps the correct reasoning is that he had a reason for the warrant, so he can search, and thus the evidence is suppressed.

Wait, but the options are about the outcome of the motion to suppress. So, if he had a warrant, the answer would be option G, meaning he had the right to search without a warrant, so the evidence isn't suppressed.

Alternatively, if he doesn't have a warrant, he can't suppress, so option A is correct.

But the officer's belief (breaking glass) is a reason for a warrant, so he should have one. Therefore, the evidence is suppressed, so the answer is option G.

But wait, option G says he had the right to search without a valid reason to pull over. So, in this scenario, does he have a valid reason to pull over? Because he was in pursuit, perhaps he doesn't have a valid reason to pull over, thus the officer can't search. So, he can't suppress the evidence, so the answer is option A.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me break it down.

If the officer has a warrant, he can search and suppress the evidence. So the answer would be option G.

If the officer doesn't have a warrant, he can't search, so the evidence isn't suppressed. So answer is option A.

But the officer's decision to stop Stan is based on his duty to prevent further crime, not on a warrant. So, he may have a warrant if he's in pursuit, but in this scenario, perhaps he doesn't. So, the officer doesn't have a warrant, so his search is unnecessary, thus the evidence isn't suppressed.

Wait, but the officer's belief about breaking glass is a reason for a warrant. So he should have a warrant, so the evidence is suppressed. Therefore, the answer is option G.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the officer's duty is to stop him, and if he's in pursuit, he doesn't have a warrant. So, his motion is denied.

Wait, the question is about the legal aspect of whether the evidence is inadmissible because the officer didn't have a warrant. So, if he didn't have a warrant, the evidence isn't inadmissible, so the motion is denied.

So, the correct answer is option A: denied, because he had a reasonable suspicion that Stan was involved in a crime (which allows a warrant), so the evidence is suppressed. Or is it option G?

Wait, no. Option G says he had the right to search the car without a valid reason to pull over. So, the officer's intent to pull Stan over is based on a valid reason. In this scenario, perhaps he doesn't have a valid reason because he's in pursuit. So, he can't search, so the evidence isn't suppressed.

Thus, the correct answer is option A: denied, because he had a reasonable suspicion that Stan was involved in a crime.

Wait, but the statement in option A is about the reason for a warrant, not about whether he has a warrant. So, the answer depends on whether he has a warrant.

But the officer's justifications for stopping him (breaking glass and alarm) are valid reasons for a warrant. So, he should have a warrant. Therefore, the evidence is suppressed, so the answer is option G.

Wait, but if he has a warrant, then he can search the trunk and suppress the evidence. So, the answer would be option G.

But the options are about whether the officer's motion is granted.

Alternatively, if he doesn't have a warrant, the evidence isn't inadmissible, so the motion is denied. So, the correct reasoning is that he didn't have a warrant, so option A is correct.

I think I'm getting stuck because of conflicting lines of reasoning. Let me try to look for a pattern among the options.

Option G is about having a valid reason to pull over, not about search warrant. So, if he had a valid reason, he can search. In this case, he might have one because of the breaking glass. So, he should have a warrant. Thus, the evidence is suppressed, so option G is correct.

But the question is about the officer's motion to suppress. So, the officer's motion is based on whether he had a warrant. Since he did, the evidence is suppressed.

So, if he had a warrant, the answer is option G. If he didn't, option A.

But the officer's belief about breaking glass is a reason for a warrant. So, he must have a warrant. Therefore, the evidence is suppressed, so the answer is option G.

But wait, the officer's goal is to prevent Stan from committing a crime. He doesn't have a warrant because he's in pursuit, so he can't search. Therefore, the evidence isn't inadmissible, so the motion is denied. So, the correct answer is option A.

Wait, now I'm even more confused. The options are about the outcome of his motion, not about the validity of the warrant.

So, the question is whether the officer's motion to suppress is granted.

If the officer has a warrant, he can search and find the evidence, so the motion is denied.

If he doesn't have a warrant, the evidence isn't inadmissible, so the motion is granted.

So, the officer's decision to stop Stan is based on his duty to prevent further crime. If he's in pursuit, he may not have a warrant. Therefore, he can't search, so the evidence isn't suppressed. The motion is granted.

But wait, no. The officer might have a warrant even if he's in pursuit, but that's up to the officer's belief. The scenario just says he's in pursuit and stopped him. So, perhaps he doesn't have a warrant because he's in pursuit.

Wait, but the officer would have a warrant if he's in pursuit. Or not? I'm a bit confused. Let's think: the officer hears breaking glass and alarm, so he knows Stan is at risk. He stops him and then checks the trunk. If he doesn't have a warrant, he can't search. So, the officer can't suppress the evidence. So, his motion is denied.

So, the answer is option A. But wait, that's about a reasonable suspicion, not whether he had a warrant.

Wait, perhaps the officer's lack of a warrant leads to the motion being denied. So, the answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: The officer's main reason for stopping him is to prevent breaking glass and to avoid further crime. He's in pursuit, so perhaps he doesn't have a warrant. Therefore, he can't search the trunk, so the evidence isn't suppressed. Thus, the motion is granted because he didn't have a warrant, so he couldn't search.

Wait, but option G is about having a valid reason to pull over. If he doesn't, he can't suppress. So, the answer is option A.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. I think the correct answer is option A: denied, because he had a reasonable suspicion that Stan was involved in a crime.

Wait, but that's about the warrant, not the search. Because he's in pursuit, he has no warrant. So, the answer is option A.

I think the correct reasoning is that the officer didn't have a warrant because he was in pursuit, so he can't search the trunk, thus the evidence isn't suppressed. So the answer is option A.
</think>

The question revolves around whether an officer's motion to suppress evidence from a car during a pursuit is granted or denied. The officer hears breaking glass and a blaring alarm, indicating a probable criminal activity. The officer then stops Stan, but does not go further, and later checks the trunk to find evidence of cash and baseball bat. The key legal principle at play is the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects against excessive search and seizure for the benefit of the government.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Warrant vs. No-Warrant**: The officer's belief in breaking glass and the alarm suggests a valid reason for a warrant. However, the officer's decision to stop Stan and check the trunk is based on his duty to prevent further crime rather than a warrant. This means the officer likely lacks a warrant to search the trunk.

2. **Evidence Suppression**: The officer's lack of a warrant means he cannot search the trunk of the car. Since the officer is in pursuit and does not have a warrant, his search of the trunk is unnecessary, and the evidence is not inadmissible. Therefore, his motion to suppress the evidence is denied.

3. **Options Evaluation**:
   - **Option A**: Correct. The officer did not have a valid reason to pull Stan over in the first place because he was in pursuit and lacked a warrant.
   - **Option B, C, D, E, F, G, H**: Incorrect. These options are irrelevant to the scenario because the officer lacks a warrant and thus cannot search the trunk.

### Conclusion:
The officer lacks a valid reason to pull Stan over, so he cannot search the trunk. His motion to suppress the evidence is denied.
