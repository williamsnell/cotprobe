Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about moral philosophy, specifically about different positions. The question is asking what the core of the absolutist position is. The options are A through J. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through each option carefully.

First, let me recall what I know about absolutism in ethics. I remember that moral absolutism says that no one's actions are necessarily morally correct because each person has different values. So, the idea is that there's no inherent right or wrong way to act; it's all about what each person thinks is right.

Looking at the options:

A: All actions are morally equivalent. Hmm, that sounds a bit like absolutism because it's saying that every action is equally important. But I'm not sure if that's the core. Maybe it's more about each person's own values.

B: It's permissible to harm as a foreseen but unintended consequence. I think this is more about the view that harm isn't inherently wrong. Like, you can harm someone if it's a foreseeable consequence, even though it wasn't intended. So this aligns with absolutism because it doesn't say that harm is inherently wrong, just that it's permissible under certain circumstances.

C: Ends justify the means. That's a core principle in Utilitarianism, I believe. It says that the right action is one that brings about the greatest good with the least harm. But the question is about absolutism, which is about individual moral decisions, not about the total outcome. So maybe C isn't the core of absolutism.

D: Individuals should always act in their own best interest. Oh, that sounds a lot like the maxim of Utilitarianism, not absolutism. But wait, absolutism might be a subset of Utilitarianism, where they agree that each individual's best interest is the right one. So maybe D isn't the absoluteist core.

E: The moral worth of an action is determined by its outcome. Again, this sounds like Utilitarianism's stance, not absolutism. Because Utilitarianism focuses on the consequences of actions, not the intrinsic worth of the individuals.

F: No action can be morally justified. That's a strong statement. It suggests that all actions are wrong, which is exactly what absolutism is about. It's not about the action itself being wrong, but that it's not morally justified in any way. So F seems like the core of absolutism.

G: Morality is subjective and varies from person to person. That's the opposite of absolutism because it's about individual values varying, not about all actions being wrong.

H: The hostility should be directed at its true object. This sounds like a form of Utilitarianism, especially if the idea is to maximize good and minimize harm. It's about the consequences of actions, not about intrinsic moral worth.

I: Human persons have a right to life. This is about the intrinsic value of human life, which seems more like the basis of Utilitarianism than absolutism.

J: Each person should pursue his or her own happiness. Again, that sounds like the maxim of Utilitarianism, focusing on individual well-being.

So, putting it all together: the question is about the core of the absolutist position. The options that say "no action can be morally justified" (F) and "all actions are morally equivalent" (A) are strong candidates. But I think F is the core because it's about the impossibility of moral justification, regardless of the actions' consequences. In other words, every action is morally ungrounded, and thus not justified. So the last character should be F.

The core of the absolutist position is that no action is morally justified because each person has distinct values, making it impossible to determine intrinsic worth. This aligns with the idea that all actions are morally equivalent since they are evaluated by their consequences. Therefore, the correct answer is F.

Answer: F
