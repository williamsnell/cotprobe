The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Mr. Patrick is preparing a five-question true-false quiz for his class. He flips a coin before writing the first question. If it is heads, he writes a true statement and if it is tails, he writes a false statement. He continues this until all five statements are written. What is the probability that the correct sequence of answers is TFTFT ? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Options:

A: \frac{1}{256}
B: \frac{1}{32}
C: \frac{1}{16}
D: \frac{1}{1024}
E: \frac{1}{8}
F: \frac{1}{4}
G: \frac{1}{6}
H: \frac{1}{2}
I: \frac{1}{128}
J: \frac{1}{64}

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the correct sequence of answers for this true-false quiz is TFTFT. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the quiz has five questions, each with a true or false answer. Mr. Patrick is flipping a coin before each question to decide whether to write a true or false. If it's heads, he writes true; if tails, false. Since a coin has two sides, each flip has a 50% chance of heads and 50% tails. 

So, each question is an independent event with a 50% probability of being true or false. That means each answer has two possible outcomes, and each outcome is equally likely.

Now, the question is about the probability that the correct sequence is TFTFT. Since each question is independent, the probability of any specific sequence is the product of the probabilities of each individual answer. 

Each letter in TFTFT corresponds to a question. Let me list them out:

1. First question: T (true)
2. Second question: F (false)
3. Third question: T (true)
4. Fourth question: F (false)
5. Fifth question: T (true)

Since each question is independent and each has a 1/2 chance of being T or F, the probability for each specific answer in the sequence is (1/2) multiplied by itself for each question.

So for TFTFT, that would be (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2). Let me calculate that.

Calculating the exponent: 1/2^5. 2^5 is 32, so 1/32. 

Therefore, the probability is 1/32. Looking at the options, that's option B.

The probability of each correct answer is 1/2 since each question is independent and has two equally likely outcomes. For the sequence TFTFT, each of the five questions must be correct, so we multiply the probabilities: (1/2)^5 = 1/32.

Answer: B) \frac{1}{32}

**Answer:** \boxed{B}
