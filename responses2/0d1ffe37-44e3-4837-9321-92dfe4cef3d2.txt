Question:

One approach to handling fuzzy logic data might be to design a computer using ternary (base-3) logic so that data could be stored as “true,” “false,” and “unknown.” If each ternary logic element is called a flit, how many flits are required to represent at least 256 different values?

Options:

A: 9
B: 4
C: 2
D: 11
E: 10
F: 5
G: 3
H: 6
I: 8
J: 7

Okay, so I've got this question about fuzzy logic and ternary (base-3) logic. Hmm, I remember that ternary logic uses three states: true, false, and unknown. The question is about how many such elements, called flits, are needed to represent at least 256 different values. 

Wait, the question is a bit tricky. Let me read it again. Oh right, each flit is a ternary logic element, so each can take three values. The question is asking how many flits are needed to represent at least 256 different values. So the goal is to find the minimum number of flits such that 3^k (where k is the number of flits) is equal to or just exceeds 256.

Wait, 3^k? Let me think. Because each flit adds a digit in base 3. So the number of possible combinations is 3^number_of_flits. So we need 3^k >=256.

Wait, what's 3^5? 3^5 is 243. Oh wait, but 3^6 is 729. Oh, wait, 256 is between 3^5 and 3^6. So 3^5 is 243, which is less than 256. 3^6 is 729, which is more than 256. So we need 6 flits.

Wait, but the options don't have 6 as the answer. Let me check the options again. The options are A:9, B:4, C:2, D:11, E:10, F:5, G:3, H:6, I:8, J:7.

Oh, option H is 6. So the answer is H, which is 6.

Wait, but wait a second, the question says "at least 256 different values". So 3^6 is 729, which is more than 256. So 6 flits would represent 729 possible values. But the question is asking how many flits are required to represent AT LEAST 256, so 6 would be the minimum because 5 gives 243, which is less than 256. So yes, H is correct.
</think>

To determine how many ternary (base-3) logic elements (flits) are needed to represent at least 256 different values, we calculate the smallest \( k \) such that \( 3^k \geq 256 \).

1. \( 3^5 = 243 \) (less than 256)
2. \( 3^6 = 729 \) (greater than 256)

Since \( 3^6 \) is the smallest power of 3 that exceeds 256, **6 flits** are required. Among the options, **H (6)** is correct.

**Answer: H**
