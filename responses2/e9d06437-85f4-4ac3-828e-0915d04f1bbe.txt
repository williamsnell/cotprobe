Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to factor the polynomial x³ + 2x² + 2x + 1 into linear factors in Z_7[x]. Hmm, Z_7 is the integers modulo 7, right? So all the coefficients are considered modulo 7. I remember that in Z_7, the possible elements are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. 

The polynomial is a cubic, so it should factor into three linear terms. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with different factors. I need to find out which one is correct.

First, maybe I should try to find the roots of the polynomial in Z_7. If I can find a root, then I can factor out (x - root) and then factor the quadratic (or linear in the quadratic) further.

Let me compute f(x) = x³ + 2x² + 2x +1 for each possible x in Z_7. That is, plug in x=0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and see if any result in 0 mod7.

Calculating each:

x=0: 0 + 0 +0 +1 =1 mod7 → not zero.
x=1: 1 + 2 +2 +1 =6 mod7 → not zero.
x=2: 8 + 8 +4 +1 =21 → 21 mod7 is 0. Oh, so 2 is a root. That means (x-2) is a factor. Wait, but wait, in Z_7, 2 is the same as -5 or -5 mod7, but I think 2 is a root.

So (x - 2) is a factor. Now, I can perform polynomial division to factor it out.

Alternatively, since it's a cubic, after finding one root, I can factor it as (x - 2)(quadratic). Then factor the quadratic.

Let me perform the division. Let me divide x³ + 2x² + 2x +1 by (x -2). Using polynomial long division.

Wait, alternatively, multiply (x-2) by a quadratic (ax² + bx +c) and see if I can get the original polynomial.

Let's set (x-2)(ax² + bx +c) = ax³ + (b - 2a)x² + (c - 2b)x + (-2c). This should equal x³ + 2x² + 2x +1.

So equating coefficients:

a =1
b -2a = 2 → since a=1, b = 3
c -2b =2 → c = 2b + 2 = 2*3 +2=8 → 8 mod7 is 1. So c=1.
-2c=1 → -2c=1 → c= -1/2. Wait, but in mod7, 1/2 is 4, because 2*4 =8=1 mod7. So -1/2 is -4 mod7, which is 3.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the earlier c=1. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check.

Wait, in the expansion, the constant term is -2c. The original constant is 1, so -2c ≡1 mod7. So 2c ≡-1 mod7 → 2c=6 mod7 → c=6*(2)⁻¹. Since 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so 2⁻¹ is 4. So c=6*4=24 →24 mod7 is 3. So c=3. But earlier, when I equated the x term, I got c=1. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the polynomial multiplication. Let me try again.

Wait, (x-2)(ax² + bx +c) = ax³ + (b -2a)x² + (c - 2b)x - 2c. So the constant term is -2c. So, in the original polynomial, the constant is 1, so -2c ≡1 mod7 → 2c ≡-1 ≡6 mod7. So 2c=6 mod7 → c=3, because 2*3=6.

Wait wait, so c=3. But earlier, when I equated the x term, I had c - 2b =2. So c=2 +2b.

From x term:
c -2b =2 → c= 2 + 2b.

From constant term:
c=3.

So substituting c=3 into c=2 + 2b → 3=2 +2b → 2b=1 → b= (1)(2⁻¹) mod7. 2⁻¹ is 4, so b=4.

So b=4.

So the quadratic factor is ax² + bx +c = x² +4x +3.

So the polynomial factors as (x-2)(x² +4x +3). Now, let's factor the quadratic.

We can factor x² +4x +3. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 3 and add to 4. 1 and 3: 1*3=3, 1+3=4. So it factors into (x+1)(x+3). Alternatively, (x-2)(x- (-1)) → since 3 is  (x - (-1)).

Wait, in Z_7, 3 is the same as -4, because 3=7-4=3. So, x+3 is (x -4) in Z_7.

Wait, because in Z_7, 3 ≡ -4 mod7 → so x+3 = x -4 (since 3 ≡-4 mod7). So the quadratic factors into (x+1)(x-4).

So putting it all together: (x-2)(x+1)(x-4). Looking at the options, option D is (x-1)(x-4)(x-2), but option D is written as (x -1)(x -4)(x -2), which is same as (x-2)(x-4)(x-1). But in my result, I have (x-2)(x+1)(x-4). Wait, but x+1 is same as x -6, because 1 ≡-6 mod7. So x+1 is (x -6), but none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the factorization. Let me recheck the quadratic.

Wait, quadratic was x² +4x +3. Let's check if that factors correctly. Let me plug in x= -1: (-1)^2 +4*(-1) +3=1-4+3=0. So yes, x=-1 is a root. So (x+1) is a factor. Then the quadratic is (x+1)(x+3) → which is (x+1)(x-4) in Z_7, as 3= -4.

So the factors are (x-2)(x+1)(x-4). So in the options, looking for this.

Option D: (x-1)(x-4)(x-2). Wait, that's (x-1)(x-4)(x-2). But according to our calculation, it's (x-2)(x+1)(x-4). Which is (x-2)(x-6)(x-4) since x+1 is x-6. Wait, but in the options, I don't see (x-6) as a factor. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, perhaps I should check if (x-6) is present, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, let's verify again. When I plugged x=2 into f(x), I got 8+8+4 +1 =21. 21 mod7 is 0. So x=2 is a root. So (x-2) is a factor. Then the quadratic is x^2 +4x +3. Factoring that gives (x+1)(x-4). So the factors are (x-2)(x+1)(x-4). So that's (x-2)(x+1)(x-4) = (x-2)(x-6)(x-4) in Z_7.

Looking at the options, none of them have (x-6). So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again:

Options:

A: (x − 2)(x + 2)(x − 1)

B: (x + 1)(x + 4)(x − 2)

C: (x + 1)(x − 4)(x − 2)

D: (x - 1)(x − 4)(x − 2)

Wait, none of the options have (x-6). So perhaps I made a mistake, because according to our calculation, the factors are (x-2)(x+1)(x-4), but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should check if another root exists. Let me try x=3.

f(3) = 27 + 18 +6 +1 =52. 52 mod7: 7*7=49, 52-49=3. So 3 mod7 is 3. Not zero.

x=4: 64 +32 +8 +1=105. 105 mod7 is 0. So x=4 is a root. Hmm, but earlier, I found x=2 as a root. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating f(2). Let me recalculate f(2) correctly.

f(2) = (2)^3 +2*(2)^2 + 2*(2) +1.

2^3=8, 2^2=4 → 2*4=8, 2*2=4. So adding:

8 + 8 =16, 16 +4=20, 20 +1=21. 21 mod7=0. So x=2 is a root.

Wait, but when I checked x=4, f(4) was 64 + 32 + 8 +1. 64 mod7: 7*9=63 → 64-63=1 → 1. 32 mod7: 7*4=28 → 32-28=4. 8 mod7=1. So 1 +4 +1 +1=7 → 0 mod7. So x=4 is also a root. So now I have two roots: x=2 and x=4. So the polynomial can be factored as (x-2)(x-4) times a linear term.

Let me perform polynomial division again. Let me use (x-2) and (x-4) as factors. Alternatively, perhaps I should factor out (x-2) and then factor the quadratic, but I think I did that before, which gave me (x-2)(x² +4x +3), which factors into (x-2)(x+1)(x-4). But none of the options seem to match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me try polynomial division again. Let's divide f(x) by (x-2).

Using synthetic division: coefficients of f(x) are 1 (x³), 2 (x²), 2 (x), 1 (constant).

Set up for synthetic division with root 2:

Bring down 1.

1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |1

Multiply 1 by 2 → 2, add to next coefficient: 2 +2=4.

Multiply 4 by2=8 mod7=1. Add to next term: 2+1=3.

Multiply 3 by2=6 mod7=6. Add to last term:1 +6=7 mod7=0. So the division is exact.

The quadratic is x² +4x +3, which factors into (x+1)(x+3) as before.

So factors are (x-2)(x+1)(x+3), which in Z_7 is (x-2)(x+1)(x-4).

So the factors are (x-2)(x+1)(x-4). So looking for this combination, let me look at the options.

Option D is (x-1)(x-4)(x-2), which is (x-2)(x-1)(x-4). But in our case, the quadratic is (x+1)(x-4), so the middle term is (x+1). So our factors are (x-2)(x+1)(x-4). None of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait another thought: maybe I should have considered the wrong root. Let's check x=3. f(3)=27 + 18 +6 +1=52. 52 mod7 is 52-49=3, so it's not zero. So x=3 is not a root.

x=5: 125 + 50 + 10 +1 → 125 mod7: 7*17=119 → 125-119=6. 50 mod7: 7*7=49, 50-49=1. So 6+1=7 →0. So x=5 is a root. Wait, but earlier I thought x=4 was a root. Let me recheck f(4):

4^3=64 mod7= 64-63=1.

2*(4)^2=2*16=32 mod7=32-28=4.

2*4=8 mod7=1.

Plus 1.

So 1+4=5, +1=6, +1=7. 7 mod7=0. So yes, x=4 is a root.

x=6: 216 + 72 +12 +1. Let's compute mod7:

216 mod7: 7*30=210 → 216-210=6.

72 mod7: 7*10=70 →72-70=2.

12 mod7=5.

1.

So 6+2=8 mod7=1, +5=6, +1=7→0. So x=6 is a root.

So x=2,4,6 are roots. Hmm, so the polynomial can be factored as (x-2)(x-4)(x-6). Let me check.

Wait, but let me re-calculate f(2), f(4), f(6):

f(2)=21→0.

f(4)=105→0.

f(6)=216 + 72 +12 +1=216+72 is 288, +12=300, +1=301. 301 mod7: 7*43=301, so zero. So x=6 is a root.

So the polynomial can be factored as (x-2)(x-4)(x-6). Now, let's see what this looks like in Z_7.

x-6 is the same as x+1 (since 6= -1 mod7), so (x-6) = x -1. So the factors are (x-2)(x-4)(x+1).

Wait, so (x+1)(x-4)(x-2) is the same as (x+1)(x-4)(x-2). Looking at the options, option D is (x-1)(x-4)(x-2). Wait, but in our case, it's (x+1)(x-4)(x-2), which is the same as (x-2)(x-4)(x+1). So none of the options have (x+1). So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, let's see which option gives the correct factors when expanded.

Option D: (x-1)(x-4)(x-2). Let's multiply two factors first: (x-1)(x-4) → x² + ( -1-4)x + (1*4) → x² -5x +4.

Then multiply by (x-2): (x² -5x +4)(x-2) = x³ -2x² -5x² +10x +4x -8.

Combine like terms: x³ -7x² +14x -8. Mod7: 7x²=0, 14x=0, so x³ -8 mod7. 8 mod7 is 1, so x³ -1.

But the original polynomial is x³ +2x² +2x +1. So x³ -1 is different. So option D's expanded form is x³ -1, not x³ +2x² +2x +1. So that's not correct.

Option B: (x+1)(x+4)(x-2). Let's multiply (x+1)(x+4) = x² +5x +4.

Multiply by (x-2): x³ -2x² +5x² -10x +4x -8 → x³ +3x² -6x -8.

Mod7: 3x², -6x=1x, -8= -1. So x³ +3x² +x -1. Original poly is x³ +2x²+2x+1. Not matching.

Option C: (x+1)(x-4)(x-2). Multiply (x+1)(x-4) →x² + (-4+1)x +(-4)=x²-3x-4.

Multiply by (x-2): x³ -2x² -3x² +6x -4x +8 → x³ -5x² +2x +8.

Mod7: -5x²=2x², 2x, 8=1. So x³ +2x² +2x +1 → which matches the original poly. So option C matches.

So the correct factorization is (x+1)(x-4)(x-2), which is option C.

To factor the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 \) into linear factors in \( \mathbb{Z}_7[x] \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Find Roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \):**
   - Compute \( f(x) \) for each \( x \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \):
     - \( f(2) = 8 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 21 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     - \( f(4) = 64 + 32 + 8 + 1 = 105 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     - \( f(6) = 216 + 72 + 12 + 1 = 216 + 72 = 288 + 12 = 300 + 1 = 301 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
   - Thus, \( x = 2, 4, 6 \) are roots.

2. **Factor the Polynomial:**
   - The polynomial factors as \( (x - 2)(x - 4)(x - 6) \).
   - In \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \), \( 6 \equiv -1 \), \( 4 \equiv -3 \), and \( 2 \equiv -5 \).
   - Therefore, the factors can be rewritten as \( (x + 1)(x + 3)(x + 5) \).
   - However, simplifying these leads to the factors \( (x + 1)(x - 4)(x - 2) \).

3. **Match with Options:**
   - The correct factorization is \( (x + 1)(x - 4)(x - 2) \), which corresponds to **Option C**.
