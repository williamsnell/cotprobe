Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about lenses and their power. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a person holds a lens 50 cm away from a flash lamp. When they look at the lamp with this lens, the image forms sharply at a distance of 16.6 cm from the lens. They're asking for the power of the lens. The options are A through J, each with different diopers.

Wait, power of a lens is related to its focal length, right? Oh right, power P is 1 over the focal length f, but in meters. So P = 1/f, where f is in meters, and power is in diopters.

But wait, wait. Oh, wait, the lens formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, where v is the image distance and u is the object distance. Oh yeah, that's the lens formula. So here, the object is the flash lamp, which is at a distance u. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused about whether u is positive or negative. I think in the lens formula, if the object is on the same side as the incoming light, it's considered positive. So if the flash lamp is on the object side, u is positive. If it's on the opposite side, it's negative. Hmm.

Wait, the lens is holding the flash lamp. The person is holding the lens 50 cm from the flash lamp. So the flash lamp is the object, and the lens is the image formation point. Wait, no, the object is the flash lamp, and the image is the projection on the screen, which is 16.6 cm from the lens. Hmm.

Wait, the image is on the opposite side of the lens from the object. Because the flash lamp is a point source, it's on one side, and the image is behind the lens, so the image distance v is positive? Or negative? Oh wait, depends on the sign convention.

I remember that in the standard sign conventions for lenses, the object distance (u) is measured from the lens to the object on the same side. So if the object is on the object side, u is positive. The image distance (v) is measured from the lens to the image on the opposite side, and if the image is real, v is positive. If it's virtual, v is negative. But in this case, the image is sharp, so it's real. So v should be positive.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The person is holding the lens 50 cm from the flash lamp. So the object (flash lamp) is 50 cm from the lens. Since the image forms behind the lens, what's the relationship? Oh, the image is formed on the opposite side of the lens from the object. So if the object is on the left (u is positive), the image would be on the right (v is negative), because v is measured on the opposite side. So in this scenario, u is positive 50 cm, and v is negative 16.6 cm.

Wait, wait. Let me make this clearer. The object is the flash lamp (on the object side), so u is +50 cm. The image is on the opposite side, so v is negative 16.6 cm. So plugging into the lens formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u.

Wait no: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. Wait, no, the correct formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. So using correct signs.

Wait, I think I should double-check the sign conventions. The standard convention is: object distance (u) is positive when the object is on the object side of the lens; image distance (v) is positive when the image is on the image side. But if the image is on the opposite side, then v is negative.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the sides. Let me think again. The lens is between the object (flash lamp) and the image. So the object is on one side, image on the other. So if the object is on the left (u positive), image is on the right (v negative). Thus, u = +50 cm, v = -16.6 cm.

Wait, but wait, the formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. So substituting:

1/f = 1/50 cm + 1/(-16.6 cm) = (1/50) - (1/16.6)

But wait, let me calculate that. Wait, 50 cm is 0.5 meters, 16.6 cm is about 0.166 meters.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use centimeters. Let me do it in cm.

So u = 50 cm = 0.5 m, v = -16.6 cm = -0.166 m.

But wait, the formula is in terms of meters, so perhaps better to convert to meters.

So u is 50 cm = 0.5 m, v is -16.6 cm = -0.166 m.

So 1/f = 1/0.5 + 1/(-0.166) → 2 + (-6) = -4 → 1/f = -4 → f would be -1/4 m, which is -0.25 m. But that can't be right because the focal length is typically positive for converging lenses. Wait, but wait, maybe I messed up the sign convention.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the image distance. If the image is formed on the opposite side, is v positive or negative? I think the image is formed behind the lens, so on the same side as the object. No, wait, no. Wait, the usual sign convention is that the object is on the left side (u positive), and the image is on the right side (v positive for real images). Because, for a converging lens, real images are formed on the same side as the object when the object is beyond the focal length, and on the opposite side when the object is within the focal length.

Wait, perhaps this is where I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The lens formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, where u is the object distance (positive if object is on the left), and v is the image distance (positive if image is on the right side of the lens). 

Wait, if the image is on the right side, v is positive. If the image is on the left side, v is negative.

So in this case, the object is on the left, so u is positive (50 cm). The image is on the right side (since it's behind the lens), so v is positive 16.6 cm. Wait, that's a different scenario. So if that's the case, both u and v would be positive. But that's not the case because the image is formed behind the lens, which is on the same side as where the object is. Wait, perhaps I should draw it.

Imagine the lens is in the middle. The object is on the left side. The image is on the right side. So the image is in front of the lens, but on the right side. So the image is formed on the same side as the object. So for a converging lens, if the object is beyond the focal length, the image is on the same side as the object (so v is positive). If the object is within the focal length, the image is on the opposite side (so v is negative).

Wait, but in our case, the image is formed on the same side as the object. So v is positive. So then, u is positive 50 cm, v is positive 16.6 cm.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because when the object is beyond the focal length, the image is on the same side as the object. So for example, if the object is at 100 cm (f is 50 cm), then the image is at 50 cm on the same side (so v is 50 cm). So in our problem, the object is at 50 cm, so the image distance would be 16.6 cm on the same side as the object. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, but if the object is placed at the focal length, the image is at infinity. So if the object is beyond the focal length, the image is real and on the same side as the object.

In our case, the object is at 50 cm, so if the focal length is f = 50 cm, the image would be at infinity. But in our problem, the image is at 16.6 cm, which is on the same side as the object. So u is positive 50 cm, v is positive 16.6 cm.

So applying the formula:

1/f = 1/u + 1/v → 1/f = 1/50 + 1/16.6.

But wait, let me calculate that. Wait, 50 cm is 0.5 m, 16.6 cm is about 0.166 m.

So 1/0.5 = 2.

1/0.166 ≈ 6.

So 2 + 6 = 8 → 1/f = 8 → f = 1/8 m = 0.125 m = 12.5 cm.

But let me compute it accurately. 1/50 = 0.02, 1/16.6 = approximately 0.06024.

Adding those gives 0.08024. So 1/f = 0.08024 → f ≈ 12.46 cm.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake. Because when the object is behind the lens, perhaps the image is on the same side. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the image is formed on the opposite side from the object. Because if the object is on the left of the lens, and the image is on the right, then the image is virtual. Wait, no. Wait, in real images, the image is on the opposite side of the lens from the object. So if the object is on the left (u positive), the image is on the right (v positive).

But in our case, the image is on the right. So u = +50 cm, v = +16.6 cm.

So the calculation is correct.

So 1/f = 1/0.5 + 1/0.166 ≈ 2 + 6.024 ≈ 8.024.

Wait, 1/50 cm is 0.02 m^-1, 1/16.6 cm is approximately 0.06024 m^-1. So 0.02 + 0.06024 = 0.08024 → 1/f = 0.08024 → f ≈ 12.46 cm.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation. 1/0.5 = 2, 1/0.166 is approximately 6 (since 0.166 * 6 = 1). So 2 + 6 = 8 → 1/f = 8 → f = 0.125 m or 12.5 cm.

But the options don't have 12.5, but option H is 12 diopters. Oh wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Because power is in diopters, which is 1/f in meters. So if f is 0.125 m, then power is 1/(0.125) = 8 diopters. Oh wait, that's option E (8 diopters).

Wait, that can't be right because in the calculation, 1/f is 8, so f is 0.125 meters, which is 12.5 cm. So power is 8 diopters, because 1/(0.125) = 8.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The image is 16.6 cm from the lens, which is on the same side as the object (so v is positive 16.6 cm). The object is at 50 cm (u positive 50 cm). So 1/f = 1/50 + 1/16.6 → let's compute it more accurately.

1/50 = 0.02 → correct. 1/16.6 = 1/ (16.6) → 1/16.6 ≈ 0.060241. So total is 0.02 + 0.060241 = 0.080241.

So 1/f = 0.080241 → f ≈ 12.46 meters? No, wait, 1/f is in m^-1. So 0.080241 is 1/f → f = 1/0.080241 → approximately 12.46 cm.

Wait, 12.46 cm is 0.1246 meters. So 1/0.1246 ≈ 8.02 diopters.

Wait, that would make the power approximately 8.02 diopters. Looking at the options, option E is 8 diopters.

But wait, wait, is the formula correct? Because the image is on the same side as the object, which would make the image real, hence the image distance v is positive. So u is positive 50 cm, v is positive 16.6 cm.

So 1/f = 1/50 + 1/16.6.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let's compute 1/50 + 1/16.6.

1/50 = 0.02.

1/16.6 = approximately 0.060241.

Adding them: 0.02 + 0.060241 = 0.080241.

1/f = 0.080241 → f = 1 / 0.080241 ≈ 12.46 cm → which is 0.1246 m.

Power is 1/f → 1/0.1246 → approximately 8.02 diopters. So approximately 8 diopters.

But wait, the options have option E as 8 diopters. But let me check this again because sometimes the image is on the opposite side.

Wait another approach: perhaps the image is on the opposite side, so v is negative. Let's see.

If the image is on the opposite side (v negative), then v = –16.6 cm = –0.166 m.

So 1/f = 1/0.5 (50 cm) + 1/(-0.166) → 2 - 6 = -4 → 1/f = -4 → f = -0.25 m → f = -25 cm.

But that would imply a negative focal length, which would mean a concave lens. But the problem doesn't specify if it's a convex or concave lens. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's a lens. So perhaps the image is virtual (so v negative). But in our case, the image is formed on the same side as the object, which would be a real image. So v is positive.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion. Because if the image is real (v positive), then the focal length is positive, meaning it's a converging lens. But if the image is virtual (v negative), f would be negative, implying a diverging lens.

But in our problem, the image is formed sharply at 16.6 cm from the lens. Since it's a real image, v is positive. So the calculation earlier holds.

So with f being approximately 12.46 cm, which is 0.1246 m. So power is 1/f → 1/0.1246 ≈ 8.02 diopters. So the closest option is E: 8 diopters.

But wait, wait another thing. Could I have mixed up the object and image positions? Because sometimes when you switch the object and image, the formula changes. Let me think.

Wait, in the lens formula, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance. So for a real image, the image is on the opposite side of the lens from the object. So if the object is on the left, image is on the right.

So in our case, the object is 50 cm from the lens (u positive 50 cm), image is on the right side (v positive 16.6 cm). That's correct.

So the calculation is correct. So f is about 12.5 cm, power is 8.02 diopters. So the answer should be E: 8 diopters.
</think>

To determine the power of the lens, we use the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
\]

where \( u \) is the object distance, \( v \) is the image distance, and \( f \) is the focal length of the lens. The power of the lens is given by \( P = \frac{1}{f} \) in diopters.

### Step 1: Assigning signs to distances
- The object is the flash lamp, which is 50 cm (0.5 m) away from the lens. Since the object is on the object side, \( u \) is positive.
- The image is formed 16.6 cm (0.166 m) from the lens on the opposite side of the lens. Since the image is on the image side, \( v \) is positive.

### Step 2: Substituting values into the lens formula
\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{0.5} + \frac{1}{0.166}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{f} = 2 + 6.024 \approx 8.024
\]

Thus, the focal length is:
\[
f = \frac{1}{8.024} \approx 0.1246 \, \text{m} \quad \text{(or 12.5 cm)}
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the power of the lens
The power of the lens is the reciprocal of the focal length:
\[
P = \frac{1}{f} = 8.024 \, \text{diopters}
\]

### Step 4: Matching the closest option
The closest option to the calculated power is **8 diopters**.
