Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve. The question is about constructing a truth table for two propositions and determining their relationship—whether they're equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or neither. The propositions given are ~O ⊃ P and O ∨ P. The options are from A to J, each with different possibilities.

Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that in logic, propositions are equivalent if they have the same truth values under all possible interpretations. They are contradictory if one is true whenever the other is false, and vice versa. Logical equivalence is a form of contradiction. Consistent means there's at least one situation where both are true. Inconsistent means they can't both be true at the same time. Contradictory statements are always false, so they can't both be true.

Wait, the propositions are ~O → P and O ∨ P. Let me break them down. The first one is a material implication, which can be rewritten using contrapositive, right? Because in logic, A → B is equivalent to ~B → ~A. So ~O → P is equivalent to ~P → O.

So, the two propositions are ~P → O and O ∨ P. Wait, no, the original is O ∨ P. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write down the two propositions clearly:

1. ~O → P (which is equivalent to O ∨ P)
2. O ∨ P

Wait, that's the same as the first one. So both propositions are actually the same. Oh wait, wait—no, wait. No, wait a minute. Let me think again. The first proposition is ~O → P, and the second is O ∨ P.

Wait, no: ~O → P is equivalent to O ∨ P, by the material implication law. So both propositions are the same. So that means they are logically equivalent. Because they have the same truth values in all possible scenarios.

So, if that's the case, then they are equivalent. But wait, looking back, the second proposition is O ∨ P. So yes, both are the same. Therefore, the two propositions are logically equivalent.

Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me construct the truth table for both.

I'll make a table with possible values for O and P. Since there are two variables, O and P, there will be 2^2 = 4 rows.

Let's list them:

1. O=T, P=T
2. O=T, P=F
3. O=F, P=T
4. O=F, P=F

Now, let's compute for each case:

For ~O → P:

1. O=T → ~O=F. So F → P. If P=T, then F→T is T. If P=F, F→F is T because in logic, F→ anything is T.

2. O=T, P=F: ~O=F. So F→F is T.

3. O=F. So ~O=T. Then T→P. If P=T, then T→T is T. If P=F, T→F is F.

4. O=F, P=F: ~O=T, so T→F is F.

So for ~O → P, the truth values are:

Row 1: T
Row 2: T
Row 3: F
Row 4: F

Wait, what? Because:

Row 1: O=T, P=T → ~O=F, so F→T=T
Row 2: O=T, P=F → F→F=T
Row 3: O=F, P=T → T→T=T
Row 4: O=F, P=F → T→F=F

Wait, that's different from my initial thought. Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, I think I confused something. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, ~O → P is equivalent to O ∨ P. So, for each row, O ∨ P is:

Row 1: T ∨ T = T
Row 2: T ∨ F = T
Row 3: F ∨ T = T
Row 4: F ∨ F = F

Wait, so both ~O→P and O∨P have the same truth values in each row. So yes, they are logically equivalent. Therefore, the two propositions are equivalent.

So looking at the options, option H says they are logically equivalent. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait, the second proposition is O∨P, which is the same as ~O→P. So both are the same, which means they are logically equivalent. So the correct choice is H.
</think>

The correct answer is H: Logically equivalent.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Propositions:**
   - Proposition 1: ~O → P
   - Proposition 2: O ∨ P

2. **Understand Logical Equivalence:**
   - Two propositions are logically equivalent if they have the same truth values in all possible scenarios.

3. **Apply Material Implication:**
   - ~O → P is logically equivalent to O ∨ P via the implication equivalence law.

4. **Construct Truth Table:**
   - Both propositions evaluate to the same truth values across all scenarios.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since both propositions are equivalent, they are logically equivalent.

**Answer:** H
