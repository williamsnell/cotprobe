Okay, so I've got this question about memory systems. Hmm, let me think. I remember that memory systems can be classified into different types, like Segmented memory. Wait, what's the key difference between them and others?

The question asks which properties are correct for a purely segmented memory system. The options are I, II, III. Let me go through each one.

I. It divides memory into equal units. Right, I think segmented memory divides the main memory into smaller, equal-sized units, called segments. These segments are physically separate and have their own address space. So statement I sounds correct.

II. It permits virtual memory. Virtual memory is when the computer manages its own memory, creating virtual RAM. Segmented memory systems don't do that because they're just divided into segments. There's no concept of swapping or using more memory than the physical address space. So statement II is incorrect.

III. It suffers from internal fragmentation. Wait, fragmentation is when the memory is filled so much that the pieces can't be retrieved, right? But in segmented memory, each segment is fixed size. So when a program accesses a segment, it can't have too much fragmentation because each segment has a fixed size. So fragmentation doesn't happen. Therefore, statement III is incorrect.

So the only correct statement is I. So the answer should be A: I only.

The correct answer is A: I only. Segmented memory systems divide memory into equal units, allowing for fixed-size segments. They do not permit virtual memory, and do not suffer from internal fragmentation because each segment is a fixed size and cannot cause fragmentation.

Answer: A
