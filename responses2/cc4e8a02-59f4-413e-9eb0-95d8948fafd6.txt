Alright, so I've got this problem here about friends going out for lunch. Let me read it again. The question is about writing an expression for the total costs of salads and soups. 

Okay, let me break it down. There are 'd' people who bought salads and 'p' people who bought soups. Each salad costs $3.99, and each soup is $2.99. I need to find the total cost for both the salads and soups combined.

So, I think I should calculate the cost separately for salads and soups and then add them together. 

For the salads: Each person bought one salad, so the cost per person is $3.99. If there are 'd' people, the total cost for salads would be 3.99 multiplied by d. So that's 3.99d.

Similarly, for soups: Each person bought one soup, costing $2.99. The total cost would be 2.99 multiplied by p. So that's 2.99p.

Now, to get the total cost, I add the two amounts together. So the expression would be 3.99d plus 2.99p. Let me see what the options are.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 3.99d + 2.99p. That matches what I'm thinking. Let me check the others to make sure.

Option A is (3.99 + 2.99)p. That would be the total for p soups at a combined price, which doesn't make sense because each is at different prices. So that's incorrect.

Option B: (3.99p + 2.99d). Wait, no, because B has p multiplied by 3.99 and d multiplied by 2.99, which would be the other way around. That would give the total if each was bought by p people for 3.99 and d for 2.99, but in this case, it's salads costing 3.99 and soups 2.99. So B is the opposite.

Option C: 2.99(d + p). That seems to multiply the sum by the soup price, which would give the total for both, but the individual items (salads at 3.99) are higher. So that's not right.

Option E is 2.99p + 3.99d. Wait, that's the same as option D, just written in a different order. So 2.99p is for soups, 3.99d for salads. So E is the same as D, just the order swapped. But 3.99d is higher than 2.99p. If you think about it, 3.99 is more than 2.99, so each salad is more expensive. So the total should be higher when you have more salads.

Wait, but the way the options are written, E is 2.99p +3.99d, which is the same as D. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me check. The question asks for the total costs of the soups and salads. So yes, whether you calculate salads first or soups first, the total is the same.

Wait, but in the options, option D is 3.99d + 2.99p, which is the same as option E but written differently. So both D and E are correct? But looking at the options, do they have duplicates?

Wait, looking again: 

Options are A-F, G-H, I-J. Let me list them again:

A: (3.99 + 2.99)p → p*(3.99+2.99). That would be total cost for p items at a combined price, which is not correct because each item is different.

B: (3.99p + 2.99d) → p*3.99 + d*2.99. That would be the cost if each person's item is either 3.99 or 2.99, but according to the problem, d people bought salads (3.99) and p bought soups (2.99). So B is wrong because it's d*2.99 and p*3.99.

C: 2.99(d +p) → 2.99*(d+p). That's the total if all items were soups. But in reality, some are salads, so the total should be higher.

D: 3.99d + 2.99p → that's correct.

E: 2.99p +3.99d → same as D, different order, but same sum.

F: 3.99p + 2.99p → that's 3.99p + 2.99p = (3.99+2.99)p. That's the total for p soups and p salads? No, because d people bought salads, so p is the number of people who bought soups. So F would be p*(3.99p + 2.99p), which would be p*(6.98p), which is p^2 * 6.98. That's wrong because each p is a separate person buying a soup, so the total is 2.99 * p.

G: 3.99p + 2.99d → same as E, written differently. So that's correct.

Wait, so D and G are the same. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the total, so any correct arrangement is correct. But when looking at the options, which are presented as separate choices, perhaps D and E are the same but written differently.

Wait, the problem is to choose one correct option. So which is the correct expression.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says 'salads' and 'soups' are bought by d and p people respectively. So the expression is 3.99d + 2.99p. So option D is 3.99d +2.99p. Option E is 2.99p +3.99d, which is the same as D but the terms swapped. So both D and E are correct? But looking at the options, I think both are presented as separate options, which would be the same in value. So perhaps both D and E are correct, but looking back at the options provided, the user is to choose one.

Wait, but in the problem, the options are listed as A to J. Let me check the options again:

Option D: 3.99d + 2.99p

Option E: 2.99p + 3.99d

So both are the same; just the order of the terms is swapped. So they are mathematically equal. So both D and E are correct, but wait, no, that's not possible. Because the options are presented as separate choices, but perhaps the user is to select the correct one, and both D and E are correct.

Wait, but in the options, perhaps only one is presented. Let me double-check the options.

Looking again:

Options are A to J.

D is 3.99d + 2.99p.

E is 2.99p +3.99d.

So both are correct. But in the options, the user is to select which one is correct. So either D or E would be correct. But wait, perhaps the problem is presented in a way that only one is correct because of the way the terms are written.

Wait, but the problem asks for the expression for the total costs, so any correct expression is correct. So D and E are both correct.

Wait but looking back at the options, perhaps I'm wrong in thinking that. No, because D and E are the same expression but written in reverse order.

Wait, wait, perhaps the way the options are presented is that D and E are the same. So the user must choose either. But given the options, the correct one is either D or E. But looking back at the problem, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but the way the options are written, each is a distinct choice, so only one is correct. The problem is, perhaps, that both D and E are correct, but the options don't allow for multiple correct answers. But in reality, both are correct—so perhaps I need to check again.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again: the problem says, "the total costs of the soup and salads." So whether the person buys d salads at 3.99 each and p soups at 2.99 each, the total is 3.99d +2.99p. So that's correct, so option D is correct. Option E is the same as D, just the terms are swapped, but since addition is commutative, 2.99p +3.99d is the same as 3.99d +2.99p. So both D and E are correct.

But looking at the options, perhaps the user is to choose between them. Let me recheck the options.

Wait, the options are A-F, then G, H, I, J. So the user is to choose one option between A to J.

So, the correct expressions are D and E. But wait, perhaps the problem is presented in a way that only one is correct because of how the terms are arranged in the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that only one of the options is correctly written. Let me look again.

So the problem is to write an expression for the total cost.

So, the correct expression is 3.99*d + 2.99*p.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 3.99d + 2.99p → correct.

Option E is 2.99p +3.99d → same as D, just terms reversed.

So both D and E are correct, but according to the problem, the options are separate, and the user must choose the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way the options are written. Let me see.

Wait, in the options, option D is 3.99d +2.99p.

Option E is 2.99p +3.99d.

That's the same as D, so both would be correct. But in reality, the problem probably expects only one correct option, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem is to choose between these options. So the correct answer is either D or E. But in reality, the order of terms doesn't matter in addition because it's commutative. So both D and E are correct, but since they are separate options, perhaps the intended correct answer is either.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, is the problem about the total cost of all salads and soups, or the total cost of each? The question says, "the total costs of the soup and salads." So yes, the same as D or E.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the expression to have the combined prices, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again to see which one matches. So, the correct expression is 3.99d +2.99p. So which of the options is that?

Looking at the options:

D: 3.99d + 2.99p → yes.

E: 2.99p +3.99d → same as D.

So both D and E are correct. But that's impossible because the options are presented as separate choices, and the user can only choose one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the options include both D and E as correct, but only one is presented. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the user presented the options as A through J. Looking at the options, the correct one is either D or E. But perhaps the options are presented in a way that only D is correct.

Wait, but the way the options are written, each is a distinct choice, so only one is correct. The problem is, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the problem says, "write an expression for the total costs of the soup and salads."

So the expression is 3.99d +2.99p, which is option D. So the correct answer is D.

But wait, option E is the same as D, just written in a different order. So why would E be a correct option? Because 2.99p +3.99d is the same as 3.99d +2.99p.

So, both D and E are correct. But the problem is expecting us to select one.

Wait, perhaps the option E is presented as a correct answer because the order of the terms is written as per the option label, but the actual value is the same. So perhaps the correct answer is either D or E.

But according to the problem, the options are separate. So in that case, perhaps the correct answer is D, because it's presented first.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: The problem says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen."

So the options are all presented, and the user selects one. So, the correct options are D and E.

But looking back, the problem may have intended the correct option to be E, because when you see the options, perhaps the order is reversed, but it's not a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the options, D is 3.99d +2.99p, which is correct. E is 2.99p +3.99d, which is also correct. So both are correct, but the problem may have only one option that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem's options have only one correct option. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should look at what each option represents. Let me think: the correct answer is either D or E. But wait, perhaps the problem is presented in a way that only D is correct because the problem statement is written in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be written as (d +p) multiplied by the average price. But that's not correct because the prices are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended for the option E to be correct because the expression is written in the order of soups first, then salads.

But that's not relevant to the problem, which is about the total cost.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the correct option is E because the terms are written in a certain way. But no, the expression is 3.99d + 2.99p, which is the same as E.

So, in conclusion, the correct expression is 3.99d + 2.99p, which is option D. But option E is the same expression, just written in reverse order.

Wait, but perhaps the problem only allows one correct option, so perhaps the intended correct answer is D. So I'll go with option D.

To determine the correct expression for the total costs of salads and soups, we analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the costs and quantities:**
   - Each salad costs $3.99, and **d** people bought salads.
   - Each soup costs $2.99, and **p** people bought soups.

2. **Calculate the total cost for each item:**
   - Total cost for salads: \( 3.99 \times d = 3.99d \).
   - Total cost for soups: \( 2.99 \times p = 2.99p \).

3. **Sum the total costs:**
   - The expression for the total costs is \( 3.99d + 2.99p \).

4. **Evaluate the options:**
   - **Option D:** \( 3.99d + 2.99p \) matches our derived expression.
   - **Option E:** \( 2.99p + 3.99d \) is mathematically equivalent to Option D due to the commutative property of addition.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Both Options D and E are correct because they represent the same total cost expression. However, since the problem requires selecting one option, the correct answer is **Option D**, as it is explicitly presented first.
