Question:

In the gambling game "craps," a pair of dice is rolled and the outcome of the experiment is the sum of the points on the up sides of the six-sided dice. The bettor wins on the first roll if the sum is 7 or 11. The bettor loses on the first roll if the sum is 2,3 , or 12 . If the sum is $4,5,6$, 8,9 , or 10 , that number is called the bettor's "point." Once the point is established, the rule is as follows: If the bettor rolls a 7 before the point, the bettor loses; but if the point is rolled before a 7 , the bettor wins. Find the probability that the bettor wins on the first roll. That is, find the probability of rolling a 7 or 11 , $P(7$ or 11$)$.

Options:

A: $\frac{5}{36}$
B: $\frac{10}{36}$
C: $\frac{7}{36}$
D:  $\frac{8}{36}$
E: $\frac{11}{36}$
F: $\frac{6}{36}$
G: $\frac{13}{36}$
H: $\frac{12}{36}$
I: $\frac{14}{36}$
J: $\frac{9}{36}$

Okay, so I have this question about the gambling game Craps, and I need to find the probability that the bettor wins on the first roll. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll remember the rules. In craps, when you roll a pair of dice, the first roll determines the outcome. If the sum is 7 or 11, the bettor wins immediately. If it's 2, 3, or 12, the bettor loses. Otherwise, if the sum is 4,5,6,8,9, or 10, that sum becomes the "point." Once the point is set, the game continues. If the next roll is a 7, the bettor loses. But if the point comes up before a 7, the bettor wins.

The question specifically asks for the probability that the bettor wins on the first roll. That means I just need to calculate the probability of rolling a 7 or 11 on the first try.

Alright, so Craps is about rolling two dice, each with 6 sides, so there are a total of 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.

I need to find the number of outcomes that result in a sum of 7 or 11.

Let me list the possible combinations for each sum.

Starting with 7: The possible pairs are (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1). So that's 6 combinations.

Next, 11: The possible pairs are (5,6) and (6,5). That's 2 combinations.

So adding those together, the total favorable outcomes are 6 + 2 = 8.

Therefore, the probability is 8 out of 36, which can be simplified to 2/9, but looking at the options, none of them directly say 8/36. Let me check the options.

The options are A:5/36, B:10/36, C:7/36, D:8/36, E:11/36, F:6/36, G:13/36, H:12/36, I:14/36, J:9/36.

Wait, D is 8/36. So that's the correct one.

But wait, hold on. The question is asking for the probability of winning on the first roll, which is exactly that scenario. So yeah, 8/36. That's option D.
</think>

The probability of rolling a 7 or 11 on the first roll is calculated by counting the favorable outcomes (8) over the total possible outcomes (36).

**Answer:** D: $\frac{8}{36}$
