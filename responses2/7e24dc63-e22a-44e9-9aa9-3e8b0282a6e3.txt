Okay, so I've got this question about fiscal policy and inflation. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is asking which fiscal policy is appropriate to remedy inflation. The options are A through J, each giving a different combination of government spending and taxes. My task is to figure out which one is correct.

First, I need to recall what fiscal policy is. From what I remember, fiscal policy refers to the use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy. There are two main tools: decreasing government spending and increasing taxes (which is option A) and increasing government spending and decreasing taxes (option J). 

Inflation happens when there's an increase in the general price level of goods and services. To combat inflation, the government can either reduce spending to cut down on demand (which would lower the overall level of spending) or increase taxes to reduce the amount of money people have to spend. Alternatively, if the government runs a deficit (meaning it spends more than it earns), that can lead to higher prices because there's more money in the economy than there's spending. On the other hand, a balanced or surplus budget (running a surplus) would also help, as it reduces the demand for goods and services.

So, the question is about the appropriate fiscal policy to remedy inflation. Let's look at each option.

Option A: Decreased government spending and increased taxes. That sounds like a contractionary policy. If the government spends less and taxes are higher, people have less disposable income. This can lead to reduced consumer spending, which might help reduce inflation because overall demand is lower.

Option B: The federal government to decrease the money supply. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. I know the Federal Reserve affects the money supply, but does the government itself decrease the money supply? I think the government can manage the money supply through fiscal policy, but I'm not certain about this option being correct. Decreasing the money supply might lead to inflation, so this might not be the right answer.

Option C: The federal government to run a deficit. A deficit would mean the government is spending more than it's receiving. This could lead to higher prices because there's more money chasing the same amount of goods. That sounds like a bad policy for inflation, so perhaps this isn't the solution.

Option D: Decreased taxes and increased government spending. This seems like a contractionary approach as well. By increasing spending and cutting taxes, the government can increase demand, which might help reduce inflation. But I'm not sure if this is the standard approach or not.

Option E: Increased government spending and decreased taxes. Wait, that's similar to option D but the order is reversed. If the government is spending more and cutting taxes, the same effect as a contractionary policy would happen. So, this could help reduce inflation by increasing demand.

Option F: Increased government spending and decreased taxes. Oh, that's the same as option E. So, same reasoning, it's a contractionary approach.

Option G: The federal government to run a surplus. A surplus would mean the government is spending less than it earns, which reduces the demand for goods and services. That helps in reducing inflation because it cuts down on the money supply relative to spending. So, a surplus is a contractionary policy.

Option H: The federal government to run a balanced budget. A balanced budget would have the government spending exactly equal to its revenue, which is the ideal situation for preventing inflation. It reduces demand because there's no excess spending; people spend the same amount they earn. So this is the best approach for preventing inflation.

Option I: Decreased government spending and taxes. That's option A, which is a contractionary approach.

Option J: Increased spending and decreased taxes. That's option F or E, which is a contractionary approach.

The question is about remodeling inflation. Inflation can be addressed through contractionary policies, which involve reducing demand. Both options E, F, and G, H, and A, I, J are contractionary. But which is more appropriate?

I think the correct approach is to run a balanced budget, which is H. Because a balanced budget prevents inflation by keeping the government spending and taxes in line, reducing overall demand. If the government runs a deficit (option C, D, G, I, J), it can lead to higher demand leading to inflation. A surplus (option G, H) reduces demand and helps prevent inflation.

So, the question is asking for the appropriate policy. The correct answer should be H: the federal government to run a balanced budget.

The appropriate fiscal policy to address inflation is to run a balanced budget, which prevents demand-driven inflation by ensuring spending and taxes remain proportional.

Answer: H: the federal government to run a balanced budget.
