Okay, I'm trying to figure out these true/false statements about linear transformations and injectivity. Let me take it step by step.

Statement 1 says: If T: V → W is a linear transformation and dim(V) < dim(W) < 1, then T must be injective. Hmm. Wait, the dimension of W is less than 1. But dimensions are non-negative integers, so less than 1 would mean it can only be 0. So dim(W) is 0. So the setup is that V has a lower dimension than W, which is zero. Wait, but dim(V) must be less than dim(W). So dim(V) < 0? That doesn't make sense because dimensions can't be negative. Oh wait, I think I'm misreading the statement. Maybe the original statement was dim(V) < dim(W) < 1. Oh, wait, that's confusing. Because 1 is a boundary, but dimensions can't be less than zero. So perhaps the statement is written incorrectly, maybe it's dim(V) < dim(W) < ∞, but the way it's written, dim(W) is less than 1, so it's zero. So we have dim(V) < 0, which isn't possible because dimensions can't be negative. So perhaps the statement is incorrect. Wait, maybe I should think again. The way the statement is written is "dim(V) < dim(W) < 1". So dim(W) must be less than 1, so it's 0. So dim(V) is less than 0, which is impossible. So the premise of the statement can't hold. Therefore, the statement is vacuously true? Or maybe it's a trick question. Wait, no, because for a linear transformation, if dim(V) is less than dim(W), then V is a proper subspace of W. So T maps V to W. Since dim(V) < dim(W), can T be injective? Wait, injective would require that the kernel is only zero. The rank-nullity theorem says that dim(V) = dim(ker T) + dim(im T). So if dim(V) < dim(W), then dim(im T) must be less than dim(V), but since dim(V) is less than dim(W), perhaps the image is smaller. But for injectivity, the kernel must be zero. So if dim(V) < dim(W), can the image have a dimension less than dim(V)? Let's take an example. Let V be R², dim(V)=2. Let W be R¹, dim(W)=1. Wait, but the condition is dim(V) < dim(W), but 2 < 1 is false. So perhaps the statement is incorrect because dim(W) can't be less than 1, except for zero. So the premise where dim(V) is less than dim(W) <1 is impossible. So in that case, the statement is always true because the premise can't be satisfied. So Statement 1 would be True? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. If dim(W) is less than 1, it's zero. So dim(V) < 0 is impossible. Therefore, the premise is false, so the implication is True because in logic, an implication is True when the premise is False. So Statement 1 is True?

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The statement says that if dim(V) < dim(W) <1, then T is injective. But dim(W) can't be less than 1 (unless it's zero). So dim(W) is 0, so dim(V) <0 is impossible. Therefore, the premise is impossible, so the implication is vacuously True. So Statement 1 is True.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. If T is a linear transformation from V to W, and V has a lower dimension than W, which is zero, then V must be the zero vector space. Because if dim(W) is zero, then W is the zero vector space. So any linear transformation from V to W, which is the zero space, must be the zero transformation. The zero transformation is not injective because it maps everything to zero. So if the premise is "dim(V) < dim(W) <1", and since dim(W)=0, then dim(V) must be less than 0, which is impossible. So the premise is always false. So the implication is always true, because in logic, if the premise is false, the implication is true. So Statement 1 is True.

Wait, but let's think: If V is a subspace of W, and dim(V) < dim(W), then dim(V) < dim(W) <1 would imply that dim(W)=0, so dim(V) is negative, which isn't possible. So the premise is impossible. So the statement is True because there are no conditions to check that would make it false. So Statement 1 is True.

Wait, but another angle: if dim(W) is less than 1, it's zero. So the condition is that dim(V) <0, which is impossible. So the premise is impossible, so the implication is True.

So Statement 1 is True.

Now, Statement 2: Let dim(V) = n. Suppose T: V→V is linear. If T is injective, then it is a bijection. Hmm. Since V is finite-dimensional, and we're in a finite-dimensional space, over the real numbers or complex, any linear transformation is either injective, surjective, or neither. In a finite-dimensional vector space, injective implies surjective (and vice versa). Because for finite-dimensional spaces, the rank-nullity theorem tells us that rank(T) + nullity(T) = dim(V). If T is injective, then nullity(T) is zero, so rank(T) = dim(V), which implies that the image is the entire space. So T is surjective. Hence, if T is injective, it is bijective. So Statement 2 is True.

So both statements are True.

Looking back at the options:

The options are pairs, like (A,B), (A,C), etc.

The options are:

A: Neither True nor False, Neither True nor False

B: Neither True nor False, False

C: True, False

D: False, True

E: True, True but not always

F: Neither True nor False, True

G: True, Neither True nor False

H: False, Neither True nor False

I: False, False

J: True, True

So I thought Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is True. So the correct option is J: True, True.

But wait, let me recheck Statement 1. Oh wait, the way I thought earlier, the premise is impossible, so the implication is True. So yes, Statement 1 is True.

So the answer is J: True, True.
</think>

The analysis of the statements leads to both being true. So the correct option is J: True, True.
