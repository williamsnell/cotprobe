Question:

Why did Mendel succeed in discovering the principlesof transmissions of hereditary traits, whereas others who had conducted such investigations had failed?

Options:

A: Mendel had a larger sample size than his contemporaries, which made his results statistically significant
B: Mendel's experiments were conducted over a longer period of time than those of other researchers, which gave him more data
C: Mendel studied the transmission of multiple traits at once
D: Mendel's success was purely due to luck
E: Mendel collaborated with other leading scientists of his time to develop his theories
F: Mendel's success was due to his background in mathematics, allowing him to see patterns that others missed
G: Mendel used advanced technology for his studies
H: Mendel was the first to use the scientific method in the study of heredity
I: Mendel had access to a secret garden with unique plant varieties that no one else had
J: Mendel's success was a combination of good experimental technique and luck. He studied one trait at a time, began with pure line plants, and luckily chose traits coded for by genes on different chromosomes.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why Mendel was able to discover the principles of heredity better than others. The question is about why Mendel succeeded where others failed. Let's go through the options one by one.

First, I remember that Mendel's experiments involved traits like flower color and seed shape. He used monohybrid crosses, which are crosses between plants with one trait. I think his key was that he studied traits one at a time, not multiple at once. If he had looked at multiple traits, it might have been harder to see patterns because each trait might be influenced by different genes. So, option C says he studied multiple traits at once. That doesn't sound right because Mendel focused on single traits, making that probably not his main reason.

Next, option B talks about more data over a longer time. But Mendel's experiments were pretty short, like a few years, and he didn't have a lot of data. His experiments were more about ratios than actual counts. So maybe the issue was the amount of data, not the time.

Option A says Mendel had a larger sample size. I don't think that's the case. He didn't have a huge sample, and his results were more about ratios than absolute numbers. Plus, he didn't have the same sample sizes as others like his contemporaries, but that's not the reason for his success.

Option E is about collaboration. I don't recall Mendel collaborating with others. His experiments were done in his lab, and he was probably working alone, so E might not be correct.

Option F says he had a background in math. I think Mendel was into math, which allowed him to see patterns. For example, he noticed that the ratio in his dihybrid crosses was 9:3:3:1, which is a pattern he could explain mathematically. So maybe his mathematical background was key.

Option H suggests he used good experimental techniques and luck. That's a bit vague. I know he did use the monohybrid crosses, but I'm not sure if luck was the main factor. I think it was more about the right approach and data collection.

Option J combines good techniques, luck, and specific plant studies. That sounds plausible. Mendel focused on traits one at a time, used specific plant varieties, and used good methods like dihybrid crosses. Plus, he might have had a unique environment, like a secret garden, but I'm not sure if that's mentioned.

Wait, looking back, I think Mendel's success was really about his approach. He used the "Law of Independent Assortment," which he realized by looking at one trait at a time. So, perhaps he didn't have a separate method but rather focused on a single trait, making it easier to analyze. That would mean he didn't need as advanced techniques as others, but he did use them.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option J says he used good experimental technique and luck. That might not be accurate since he was methodical with his experiments. So maybe F is better, but F is about math.

Hmm, another thought: Mendel's experiments were more about ratios and patterns than controlled experiments. So his technique was good, but was he lucky? Or was it more about the right approach.

I think the correct answer is F: Mendel's success was due to his background in mathematics, allowing him to see patterns that others missed. Because Mendel was working with ratios and he noticed that the ratios in his experiments followed certain patterns, which he could explain mathematically. This helped him understand heredity better than others who might have relied more on vague observations without a mathematical basis.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another angle: Mendel's experiments were more about the ratios and the idea that traits are inherited independently, which he didn't see in other researchers. So perhaps it's about the approach he took.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E, but I don't think so because he was working alone. So, the reasoning would be that Mendel's approach was better, especially in analyzing the ratios and patterns, which others didn't do as thoroughly.

Alternatively, I think Mendel's success was because he used the correct experimental method, i.e., using dihybrid crosses and looking at one trait at a time, and mathematically analyzing the results. So maybe he had good techniques (like using controlled experiments) and a mathematical background to see the patterns.

Wait, looking at the options again, option J says he had good experimental technique, which he did. He studied one trait at a time, used the right methodology, and had a good system. So that makes option J a strong candidate.

Alternatively, option H says he used the right techniques and luck. But I think he was methodical and didn't rely on luck because he observed patterns. So maybe option J is more accurate.

Wait, another point: Mendel's experiments were more systematic. He used the "Law of Independent Assortment," which was a new concept. His work was more rigorous in experimental design than others. So perhaps his method was better, and his mathematical approach was key.

I think the correct answer is F: Mendel's success was due to his background in mathematics, allowing him to see patterns that others missed. Because without a mathematical approach, others couldn't explain the ratios and patterns as Mendel did.

Mendel's success in discovering the principles of heredity was due to his mathematical background and rigorous experimental approach. He used the "Law of Independent Assortment" by analyzing ratios, which others could not explain as effectively due to a lack of mathematical rigor and systematic methods. Thus, the correct answer is:

F: Mendel's success was due to his background in mathematics, allowing him to see patterns that others missed.
