Okay, so I've got this question about linear algebra, specifically about statements involving vectors and linear independence. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question includes two statements. Statement 1 says that any set of two vectors in R² is linearly independent. Statement 2 says that if V is the span of vectors v1 through vk, and those vectors are linearly independent, then the dimension of V is k. Then, there are several options about the truth of these statements.

I need to evaluate each statement and see if they're true or false. Then, match them to the given options which are pairs of True/False, or sometimes have 'Cannot determine' as an option.

Starting with Statement 1: Any set of two vectors in R² is linearly independent.

Hmm, wait. In linear algebra, two vectors are linearly independent if neither is a scalar multiple of the other. So, if they are, they are dependent, and if they aren't, they are independent. But the statement says "any" set. So, it's not just about whether they are independent, but whether they are always independent.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait a second. So, in R², any two vectors are either independent or dependent. So, the statement claims that any two vectors in R² are independent, which is not true. For example, if I take the standard basis vectors, (1,0) and (0,1), they are independent. But if I take two vectors where one is a multiple of the other, like (1,0) and (2,0), they are dependent. So, Statement 1 is false because it's not always the case.

Moving on to Statement 2: If V is the span of vectors v1 through vk, and {v1, ..., vk} are linearly independent, then dim(V) = k.

Hmm. So, V is the span of these vectors. The dimension of V is the number of vectors in a basis for V. Given that the set {v1,...,vk} is linearly independent, it's a basis for V (since span of independent vectors is a basis if it's maximal, which it is in this case as it's given as a set). Therefore, the dimension of V is k. So, Statement 2 is true.

So now, the two statements: S1 is false, S2 is true.

Looking back at the options:

A: False, False → No, since S2 is true.

B: True, False → No, since S1 is false.

C: False, True → Yes, this matches.

D: Cannot determine, False → Well, S2 is definitely true, so D is false.

E: True, True → No, S1 is false.

F: Cannot determine, Cannot determine → Both are definite, so F is false.

G: False, Cannot determine → No, because S2 is definitely true.

H: True, Cannot determine → No, because S1 is false.

I: Cannot determine, True → No, S2 is true.

J: False, False, but exceptions → No, S1 is false, S2 is true.

So the correct option would be C: False, True.

The analysis shows Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. Thus, the correct option is C.
