Question:

A 19-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because, she says, "I'm burning up." Medical history is significant for intravenous drug use. Physical examination discloses a systolic heart murmur over the precordium. An expected physical finding will be which of the following?

Options:

A: Decreased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration
B: Increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration
C: Increased intensity of S1
D: Decreased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration
E: Positive JVP (rise in jugular venous pulse) with expiration
F: No change in the intensity of the murmur with breathing changes
G: Positive Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration)
H: Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration
I: Negative Kussmaul sign (no rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration)
J: Decreased intensity of S1

Okay, so I'm faced with this medical question about a 19-year-old woman who's been burned. She mentions burning up, which probably refers to a severe burn. Her medical history includes significant intravenous drug use, which could be a risk factor for burns, especially if she's taking multiple medications or had IVs over time.

The physical exam shows a systolic heart murmur over the precordium. I'm supposed to determine the expected finding based on her symptoms. The options are all about changes in heart murmur intensity or other findings like Kussmaul sign or JVP.

First, let's break down her symptoms. She's had burns, so she's probably in a high-risk condition. High-risk factors can lead to more severe burns, especially if she's on IVs or using drugs. Burn patients are more prone to rapid intracranial pressure (IVP) and can have more severe heart issues.

The heart murmur mentioned is a systolic murmur over the precordium. I remember that in heart murmur studies, a murmur over the precordium (which is the area above the ventricle) is often called S2, but sometimes S1 is referred to as a pre-impè™š murmur. Wait, no, S1 is usually the pre-implantation murmur, which is a different area. So in her case, the precordium is the area above the ventricle; the S1 is usually over the base of the heart arch.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. The precordium is the area above the ventricle, so the S1 is over the base. The question says the murmur is over the precordium, so it's S2, I think. But the options don't have S2. Let's see: the options are about intensity changes with different breathing or JVP changes.

The options list things like Kussmaul sign, JVP, etc. Kussmaul sign is a sign of high intracranial pressure, caused by blood flow to the brain. It's a sign that blood is flowing up through the brain, so you see a rise in jugular venous pressure (JVP) when you expire. That's when you have a Kussmaul sign, a "rising" JVP.

The question is about the intensity of the heart murmur. High intracranial pressure (ICP) can cause a more intense heart murmur. Also, in high ICP, the heart's own heart murmur might be more intense because the blood is in the brain.

Now, what happens when a patient has a Kussmaul sign?

Kussmaul sign is a positive finding where the JVP (jugular venous pressure) increases with inspiration or expiration. So, when you breathe in, you feel a rise in JVP, and when you breathe out, you might also see it.

But how does this affect the heart murmur? Well, high ICP can lead to more severe heart muscle contractions, which can result in a more intense heart murmur. Also, if there's a Kussmaul, it might increase the intensity of the heart murmur because the blood flow to the heart is higher, leading to more turbulence and a more violent heart rhythm.

Wait, but another point: in the case of high ICP, the heart's own muscle contractions are more intense, leading to a more violent rhythm and a more severe heart murmur. So, in this scenario, the patient's JVP would rise, and the heart murmur would be more intense.

Looking at the options, let's see. The question asks for the expected physical finding. So, the expected finding is that the JVP increases during expiration, which is the Kussmaul sign. So, the patient's heart murmur would be more intense because the JVP is rising.

Now, the options about intensity of the heart murmur with different conditions. Also, considering that she's on IVs or has burns, which are high-risk, that could lead to more severe heart issues. So the heart murmur would probably be more intense.

Wait, but wait: the physical exam shows a heart murmur over the precordium. If the JVP is rising (Kussmaul), that's a sign of high ICP, which would cause the heart to function more erratically, leading to a more intense heart murmur.

Looking at the options again:

E: Positive JVP (rise in jugular venous pulse) with expiration.

So, if the patient's JVP increases with expiration, that's a Kussmaul sign, which is a positive finding. So in this case, the expected finding would be a positive JVP, which is option E.

Wait, but another thought: can the heart murmur be affected by JVP changes? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. High ICP can cause more severe heart function, leading to more turbulence and more intense heart murmurs. So if the JVP rises, the heart's own rhythm is affected, leading to more intense murmurs.

So the expected finding would be a positive JVP (rising) with expiration. So the correct answer would be E.

The 19-year-old woman has significant intravenous drug use and burns, indicating a high risk of high intracranial pressure (ICP). Her physical exam reveals a systolic heart murmur over the precordium. 

In high ICP, the heart's own heart murmur often becomes more intense due to heightened blood flow to the heart, which can result in more turbulent and violent muscle contractions. Additionally, a Kussmaul sign, characterized by a rise injugular venous pressure (JVP) with expiration, is a sign of high ICP. 

The expected finding in this case is a positive JVP increase with expiration, which is a Kussmaul sign. This aligns with option E, which states that a positive JVP (rise in jugular venous pulse) occurs with expiration.

Answer: E
