Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic induction. Hmm, I remember that when a magnetic field changes through a coil, it induces an EMF. Oh right, Faraday's Law! Let me think about what the exact formula is.

Faraday's Law states that the induced EMF is equal to the negative change in magnetic flux over time. The formula is EMF = -N * (ΔΦ/Δt), where N is the number of turns, ΔΦ is the change in magnetic flux, and Δt is the time interval.

Wait, but wait, the negative sign comes from Lenz's Law, which I think says the induced current opposes the change in flux. But since the question is about the magnitude of the induced EMF, I can ignore the sign perhaps. Or maybe the question just wants the magnitude, so I can just take the absolute value.

The problem says the coil is circular with area 0.2 m² and 250 turns. So N is 250. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane, so the flux is Φ = B * A * cos(theta). Since theta is 90 degrees, cos(theta) is zero? Wait no, wait, wait. Oh wait, wait. No, wait: for perpendicular, the angle is 90 degrees, so cos(90) is zero. That would mean the flux is zero. But the magnetic field is increasing, so wait, maybe I'm mixing up something.

Wait, no. The field is directed perpendicular to the plane of the coil. So the flux is Φ = B * A * cos(theta), where theta is 90 degrees. So cos(theta) is zero, so Φ would be zero. But that's the initial flux. Then the field increases from 0.01 T to 0.06 T. So the change in flux is Φ_final - Φ_initial, which is (0.06*0.2) - (0.01*0.2) = (0.012 - 0.002) = 0.012 T·m². Oh wait, no. Wait, wait, I think I messed that up.

Wait, wait: the area is 0.2 m². So initial flux is B_initial * A. B_initial is 0.01 T, so 0.01 * 0.2 = 0.002 Wb. The final flux is B_final * A. B_final is 0.06, so 0.06 * 0.2 = 0.012. So the change in flux is 0.012 - 0.002 = 0.010 Wb. Yeah, that makes sense.

So ΔΦ is 0.010 Wb. The time interval is 0.25 seconds. So ΔΦ/Δt is 0.010 / 0.25. Let me calculate that. 0.010 divided by 0.25 is 0.04 (since 0.01 / 0.25 = 0.04). So EMF is N times this ΔΦ/Δt. N is 250, so 250 * 0.04 = 10 volts.

Wait, but wait, the options are A to J. Looking at the options, option G is 10 V. So the answer should be G.

To determine the average induced EMF in the coil, we use Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction, which states:

\[
\text{EMF} = -N \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}
\]

where:
- \( N \) is the number of turns in the coil,
- \( \Delta \Phi \) is the change in magnetic flux,
- \( \Delta t \) is the time interval.

### Step 1: Calculate the change in magnetic flux (\( \Delta \Phi \))
The magnetic flux \( \Phi \) is given by:
\[
\Phi = B \cdot A \cdot \cos(\theta)
\]
Since the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the coil, \( \theta = 90^\circ \), and \( \cos(90^\circ) = 0 \). This implies that the initial flux is:
\[
\Phi_{\text{initial}} = B_{\text{initial}} \cdot A \cdot \cos(90^\circ) = 0
\]
The final flux is:
\[
\Phi_{\text{final}} = B_{\text{final}} \cdot A \cdot \cos(90^\circ) = B_{\text{final}} \cdot A
\]
Given:
- \( B_{\text{initial}} = 0.01 \, \text{T} \),
- \( B_{\text{final}} = 0.06 \, \text{T} \),
- \( A = 0.2 \, \text{m}^2 \),

the change in flux is:
\[
\Delta \Phi = \Phi_{\text{final}} - \Phi_{\text{initial}} = (0.06 \cdot 0.2) - (0.01 \cdot 0.2) = 0.012 - 0.002 = 0.010 \, \text{Wb}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the average induced EMF
The number of turns \( N = 250 \), and the time interval \( \Delta t = 0.25 \, \text{s} \). Using Faraday's Law:
\[
\text{EMF} = N \cdot \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t} = 250 \cdot \frac{0.010}{0.25}
\]
First, calculate \( \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t} \):
\[
\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t} = \frac{0.010}{0.25} = 0.04 \, \text{Wb/s}
\]
Then, calculate the EMF:
\[
\text{EMF} = 250 \cdot 0.04 = 10 \, \text{V}
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The calculated induced EMF is \( 10 \, \text{V} \), which corresponds to option **G**.
