Okay, so I'm looking at this question about partial pressures of gases in a tank. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

The question states that dry air is composed of nitrogen (78.1%), oxygen (20.9%), and other gases (1%). The tank is compressed to a total pressure of 10.0 atmospheres. We need to find the partial pressures of each component and see which option matches.

Wait, I remember that partial pressure depends on the mole fraction of the gas and the total pressure. Oh right, in a gas mixture, the partial pressure of a component is equal to the mole fraction of that component multiplied by the total pressure. Because each gas contributes to the total pressure based on its mole fraction.

So the formula is P = X * P_total, where X is mole fraction, and P_total is the total pressure. 

Let me break it down for each gas.

For nitrogen: X_N2 is 78.1%, which is 0.781 in decimal. So P_N2 = 0.781 * 10 atm = 7.81 atm.

Oxygen: X_O2 is 20.9%, which is 0.209. So P_O2 = 0.209 * 10 = 2.09 atm.

Other gases: X_others is 1%, which is 0.01. So P_others = 0.01 * 10 = 0.1 atm.

Wait, looking at the options, option J says P_N2 =7.81 atm, P_O2=2.09 atm, P_other=0.1 atm. That matches exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be J.

Let me double-check the calculations. 78.1% of 10 is 7.81, 20.9% is 2.09, and 1% is 0.1. Yeah, that's correct. So the partial pressures are as per option J.

The question involves calculating the partial pressures of nitrogen (N₂), oxygen (O₂), and other gases in a compressed dry air tank. The total pressure is 10.0 atm, and the mole fractions of the gases are given as 78.1% for N₂, 20.9% for O₂, and 1% for other gases. The partial pressure of each gas is calculated using the formula \( P = X \cdot P_{\text{total}} \), where \( X \) is the mole fraction and \( P_{\text{total}} \) is the total pressure.

- For nitrogen: \( P_{\text{N}_2} = 0.781 \cdot 10.0 \, \text{atm} = 7.81 \, \text{atm} \).
- For oxygen: \( P_{\text{O}_2} = 0.209 \cdot 10.0 \, \text{atm} = 2.09 \, \text{atm} \).
- For other gases: \( P_{\text{other}} = 0.01 \cdot 10.0 \, \text{atm} = 0.10 \, \text{atm} \).

The calculated partial pressures match option J: \( P_{\text{N}_2} = 7.81 \, \text{atm} \), \( P_{\text{O}_2} = 2.09 \, \text{atm} \), \( P_{\text{other}} = 0.10 \, \text{atm} \). 

ANSWER: J
