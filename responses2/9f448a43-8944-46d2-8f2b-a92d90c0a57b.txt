Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I'm a bit new to logic formulas, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is asking which of the conditions I, II, and III can be expressed using a Boolean formula in the variables p1, p2, p3, p4 with just the connectives ∧, ∨. So, no negations. That's important because without negations, each variable can only be true or false, but not both or neither. So any condition that requires a variable to be false would need a way to represent that, but in this case, we can't use ¬, so each variable has to be treated as a binary variable.

Let me look at each condition one by one.

Condition I: At least three of p1 to p4 are true.

Hmm. So how do I express that? Well, "At least three" means that either 3 or 4 variables are true. So the sum of the variables (p1+p2+p3+p4) should be ≥3. But wait, in Boolean logic, sums are not directly expressible. But maybe I can use the AND and OR operations. But since I can't use ¬, I can't use negations. Wait, can I? Because the variables are p1 to p4, but I'm not negating any. So, for condition I, the formula would be (p1 or p2 or p3 or p4) and also (p1 or p2 or p3 or p4) and (p1 or p2 or p3 or p4) and (p1 or p2 or p3 or p4), but that's not right. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of ORs and ANDs.

Wait, at least three variables are true: that's equivalent to saying that the sum of their truth values is at least three. But how do I express that with just ∧ and ∨? Let me think.

Alternatively, think of it as p1 OR p2 OR p3 OR p4, but that's not the same. Wait, but the sum is more than or equal to three.

Wait, perhaps I can model this with a formula. Let's consider that to have at least three variables true, each possible combination where three or four variables are true must be true, and the rest false.

But how do I represent that? Since there are four variables, the number of possible combinations is 2^4=16, but only 5 of them satisfy "at least three".

But with just ∧ and ∨, can I represent such a condition?

Alternatively, think in terms of implications. Hmm, maybe not. Another approach is to see if this condition can be expressed as a formula. For example, the sum p1+p2+p3+p4 ≥3 is equivalent to (p1+p2+p3+p4) being 3 or 4.

But in logic, how do you represent that? It's tricky because you can't directly express the sum without unary operations (like ¬).

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. Each variable can be either true or false, but not both.

Wait, for condition I, can I arrange the formula in such a way that it's equivalent to the sum being at least 3? Well, the sum can be represented as the OR of all possible triplets. But that's not feasible because the number of combinations is 4 choose 3, which is 4, plus 4 choose 4 which is 1. So 5 terms in OR. But that's a long formula, but it's possible.

Wait, but can I do that within the allowed connectives? The question is about whether it's expressible, not necessarily the simplicity or length. So, for condition I, the formula would be (p1 OR p2 OR p3 OR p4) and (p1 OR p2 OR p3 OR p4) and ... but no, that's not the way. Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think of the sum of the variables.

But without using negation, how do I get the sum? Because each variable is either 0 (false) or 1 (true). So, for four variables, the sum would be p1 + p2 + p3 + p4, but in Boolean terms, addition is equivalent to logical OR, but that's not right. Wait, no. Actually, in Boolean algebra, addition is equivalent to logical OR, but it's not the same as sum in real numbers. Wait, no, maybe I'm conflating concepts here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about it differently. To express "at least three variables are true", can we represent that as a formula using only AND and OR?

Wait, let's think about all possible scenarios where 3 or 4 variables are true. So, for 3 variables being true, each possible combination of 3 variables being true. So, for example, p1, p2, p3 are true, and p4 false. Alternatively, p1, p2, p4 true, p3 false, etc. Each of these 5 cases is a conjunction (AND) of 3 variables, and a negation of the fourth variable.

But wait, without using ¬, how can I represent the negation? Because each variable can be either true or false, but not both. So, to get a variable being false, I'd need to use ¬, which I can't do here.

Wait, but wait! If I have four variables, each can be either true or false, but not both. So, for condition I, at least three are true, which is OR of all possible triplets. But how? Because each triplet would be something like (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ ¬p4), but that's not allowed because ¬p4 is not permitted.

Hmm, so without negation, how can I express that a variable is false? Maybe using something else. Wait, I'm stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps condition I is expressible. Because, for each variable, say p4, to be false, it can't be the case that p4 is true. So, ¬p4 is equivalent to (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) OR (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ ¬p4). Wait, that's not helpful because that's just p4 being false.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, to represent p4 being false, without using ¬, perhaps through a combination that enforces it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of p4 as the combination of all possible cases where p4 is false. Wait, but without negation, I can't express that. So, perhaps condition I is not expressible with just ∧ and ∨.

Wait, but wait again. Let's think differently. Maybe I can represent the variables in a way that p4 can only be true or false. But how?

Wait, perhaps if I have a term like (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4), but that's a lot of terms. However, each term is a conjunction of 3 variables, and the overall OR combines them.

Wait, but the problem is that each term must have exactly three variables, but how do I ensure that each term is a conjunction of three variables, and the OR of all such terms represents at least three variables being true. But without using negation, each conjunction can only have up to three variables. Wait, but the formula would have 5 terms, each being the conjunction of three variables, and the overall formula is their OR.

Wait, but the issue is that each term in the OR is a conjunction of three variables, and how do I represent all possible combinations where exactly three are true? Or at least three. So, for example, when exactly three are true, the formula would include all those terms, and when exactly four are true, the formula would include all possible four-true terms, which also satisfy the condition.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try an example. For condition I, the formula would be equivalent to (p1 ∨ p2 ∨ p3 ∨ p4) ∧ (p1 ∨ p2 ∨ p3 ∨ ¬p4) ∧ (p1 ∨ p2 ∨ ¬p3 ∨ p4) ∧ (p1 ∨ ¬p2 ∨ p3 ∨ p4) ∧ (¬p1 ∨ p2 ∨ p3 ∨ p4) ...

Wait, but that's not correct. Because each term in the OR is a conjunction of three variables, and the entire formula is an OR of all those terms. Wait, no, each term is a conjunction of three variables, but the formula is the OR of all those terms, which would be a formula that's true if at least one of those conjunctions is true.

Wait, but that would mean that if any of the three-variable conjunctions are true, then the formula is true. But that would require that at least one combination of three variables is true. But that's not the same as at least three being true. Because, for example, if three are true, but perhaps the fourth is false, the formula would still be true because one of the three-term conjunctions would have three variables true and the fourth false, making the conjunction true.

Wait, no. Wait, each three-term conjunction would have exactly three variables true. Because each conjunction is p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3, but if the formula is p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3. So, for such a conjunction, when three variables are true and one is false, the conjunction is false. So, in the overall OR formula, the entire thing would be true only when at least one of these three-term conjunctions is true, which would require that at least one of the variables not being in the conjunction is false. But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe condition I can be expressed as a formula with only three variables.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as p1 ∨ p2 ∨ p3 ∨ p4 (which is condition II, which is exactly three), but that's not I. Wait, no, condition II is exactly three, which is a different condition.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should move on to condition II and see if I can find a way to express it.

Condition II: Exactly three of p1, p2, p3, p4 are true.

To express exactly three, we can think of it as (at least three) OR (at least one). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because "exactly three" is equivalent to "at least three" AND "at most three". But since "at most three" is the same as "at least one", but that's not correct because "at least three" is the only condition we need.

Wait, no. For exactly three, it's the set of all cases where exactly three are true, which is the same as "at least three" AND "at most three". But since "at most three" is automatically true when "at least three" is true, perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, another approach: exactly three is the same as (at least three) AND (not (at least four)). Because if you have at least four, you're not exactly three.

So, formula II can be expressed as (at least three) ∧ (¬at least four). But how can I express "at least four" or "at least three" with just AND and OR?

But wait, without using negation, so I can't express "at least four" because that would require ¬p4, which isn't allowed.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I can find a way to represent exactly three without using negation.

Wait, maybe another approach. Think about the formula (p1 ∨ p2 ∨ p3 ∨ p4) ∧ (¬p1 ∨ ¬p2 ∨ ¬p3 ∨ ¬p4) ... no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps not. Maybe I should consider that exactly three is the same as (p1 ∨ p2 ∨ p3 ∨ p4) ∧ (p1 ∨ p2 ∨ p3 ∨ p4) ... no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if it can be expressed as a formula that's the AND of certain terms. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps condition II can't be expressed without using negation. Because, without using ¬, how can I represent whether a variable is false.

Wait, but without using ¬, each variable is either true or false, but not both. So, for condition II, to have exactly three variables true, each possible triplet must be true. But to express that, I need to have all possible triplets in the formula. But I can't do that with just AND and OR because that would result in a huge formula. So perhaps condition II cannot be expressed, but that's not possible because the question says "can be expressed", but I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think about it: exactly three can be represented as the sum of the variables being 3, which can be written as (p1 + p2 + p3 + p4) = 3. But in Boolean terms, sum isn't directly possible. However, in terms of logic gates, that's equivalent to (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) being false, but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think of condition II as p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4 ... no, that's not right. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps condition II can't be expressed, but that seems unlikely, because I've seen similar problems before. For example, in some logic problems, exactly k variables can be expressed using only AND and OR, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about condition III.

Condition III: An even number of p1, p2, p3, p4 are true.

So, the sum p1+p2+p3+p4 is even. How can I express that? Well, in Boolean terms, the sum is even if the sum is 0 mod 2, meaning the sum is 0 or 2 or 4. So, the formula would be (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ ¬p4) ∨ ... but again, it's getting complicated.

Wait, but without using negation, so how can I represent that. Oh wait, perhaps using the fact that (p ∧ q) is equivalent to (p ∨ (p ∧ q)), but that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps I can represent the formula as p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4 ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ ¬p4) ... but again, without using ¬, it's unclear.

Wait, another idea: think in terms of parity. The parity of the number of true variables can be expressed using XOR operations, but without using XOR. Hmm, without using XOR or negation, that's challenging.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that (p1 + p2 + p3 + p4) mod 2 = 0. But again, without using addition or mod, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps condition III can't be expressed? Or maybe it can, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I should look for whether each condition can be expressed using only ∧ and ∨.

Let me try to model each condition.

Condition I: At least three variables are true.

So, the formula should be true if any of the combinations where three or four variables are true is true. But how to express that with just AND and OR.

Wait, perhaps, for condition I, the formula is the OR of all possible combinations of three variables, and also the combination of all four. But again, without using negation, each term would be a conjunction of three variables, and the formula would be an OR of all these terms.

Wait, but that would require a lot of terms. For four variables, the number of terms for exactly three is 4, and for exactly four is 1. So the formula would be (term1) ∨ (term2) ∨ (term3) ∨ (term4) ∨ (term5). Each term is a conjunction of three variables.

But wait, each term would represent a case where three variables are true and the fourth is false. But in the overall formula, it would require any one of those to be true, which would indeed satisfy condition I.

Wait, but does that formula correctly express "at least three variables are true"? Or is there a case where it's not true when exactly three are true? No, because each term is the conjunction of three variables (true) and one variable (false), making the term false. So, the OR of all these terms would be true only when at least one of them is true, which would require that at least three variables are true. So, condition I can be expressed as a formula with just AND and OR.

Wait, but wait. Let me take an example. Let's say variables are p1, p2, p3, p4.

Condition I is: at least three are true.

So, the formula would be (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ ¬p4) OR (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p4 ∧ ¬p3) OR (p1 ∧ p3 ∧ p4 ∧ ¬p2) OR (p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4 ∧ ¬p1) OR (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) OR (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ??

Wait, no, the four variables can't have all four true. Each term is a conjunction of three variables, so in the OR, any of these would make the formula true if their corresponding three variables are true and the fourth is false.

But wait, the OR would require that at least one of these cases is true. So, for example, if p1, p2, p3 are true and p4 is false, the first term is true, so the formula is true.

If all four are true, then the term (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) is also true, so the formula is true.

But what about if exactly three are true? For example, p1, p2, p3 are true, p4 is true? Then, that's four variables, so it's not in any of the terms. So, the formula would be false for that case, which is correct because condition I requires at least three.

So, yes, I can express condition I as the OR of all possible three-variable conjunctions and the four-variable conjunction. So, condition I can be expressed.

But then, condition II: exactly three. Can I express that?

Hmm. Let's think. For exactly three variables, the formula would require that the sum is exactly three, which can be expressed as (at least three) AND (at most three). But without using negation, how can I express "at most three"?

Wait, perhaps I can express "at least three" as the condition I just discussed, and "at most three" as the condition I just discussed. So, condition II is (at least three) AND (at least one). But I'm not sure if that works.

Alternatively, perhaps condition II can't be expressed because it requires a negation.

Wait, perhaps condition II is impossible to express with just ∧ and ∨, because it's equivalent to (at least three) AND (at least one), but without negation, I can't express "at least three" or "at least one".

Wait, perhaps condition II can be expressed as the conjunction of (at least three) and (at least one). But without using negation, how can I represent "at least one"?

Wait, perhaps I can't. Because without using negation, I can't express that a variable is true.

Wait, alternatively, maybe condition II can be expressed by considering that exactly three are true is equivalent to all variables are true in some way. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps condition II can't be expressed. So, perhaps only condition I can be expressed, and the others can't.

Wait, let me think again.

Condition I: At least three variables are true. As I thought earlier, it can be expressed as the OR of all possible three-variable conjunctions and the four-variable conjunction. So, I think condition I can be expressed.

Condition II: Exactly three variables are true. Without using negation, I don't think I can express this condition. Because without negation, I can't express that a variable is false. So, I can't express that a variable is true because that would require a negation. So, perhaps condition II can't be expressed.

Condition III: An even number of variables are true. Hmm, this seems challenging because without using negation, it's difficult to represent the evenness. Because, in Boolean algebra, the sum is equivalent to the parity, but without using parity operations, which usually involve XOR, it's difficult.

Wait, but perhaps I can express it in terms of the sum. So, the sum p1+p2+p3+p4 is even. Which is equivalent to (p1 XOR p2 XOR p3 XOR p4) is false. But again, without using XOR, I can't express that.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the sum is even if the number of ones is even. So, the formula would be (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ ¬p4) ∨ ... but without using negation, I can't represent the negation.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think of the options.

So, the options are I, II, III. We have to see which of these can be expressed.

We already decided that condition I can be expressed.

Condition II: Exactly three variables are true. Without using negation, I can't express that. Because I can't represent the negation, which is necessary to represent that a variable is false. So, perhaps condition II can't be expressed.

Condition III: Even number of variables are true. Without using negation, I can't represent the negation, so I can't express whether a variable is true or false. So, perhaps condition III can't be expressed.

Wait, but that can't be right, because in some problems, an even number can be expressed with just AND and OR. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, another thought: perhaps condition III can be expressed as the sum being zero, but without using subtraction. So, perhaps it's impossible.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to summarize.

I: Can be expressed as OR of all three-term conjunctions and four-term conjunction.

II: Can't be expressed, because I can't represent the negation.

III: Can't be expressed, because I can't represent the negation.

Wait, but that's not possible because the question is asking which conditions can be expressed. So, perhaps only I can be expressed.

But earlier, I thought I could express condition I, but I'm not sure about condition II and III.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think of condition II as (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ ¬p4) ∨ ... but without using negation, I can't represent ¬p4. So, I can't represent that p4 is false. So, I can't represent that (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3) ∧ (¬p4) is a term. So, I can't express condition II.

Similarly, condition III is about even number. Without using negation, I can't represent whether a variable is true or false, so I can't express whether a variable is in an even count. So, condition III can't be expressed.

Wait, but then the question says "can be expressed", but I'm seeing that only condition I can be expressed.

But wait, let me think of another way. Maybe condition I can be expressed, but conditions II and III can't.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong, and all three can be expressed.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: for condition I, the formula is the OR of all possible three-variable conjunctions and the four-variable conjunction. So, I think condition I can be expressed.

Condition II: Exactly three. Without using negation, I can't express that a variable is false, so I can't represent that a variable is in three. So, condition II can't be expressed.

Condition III: Even number. Without using negation, I can't express whether a variable is true or false, so I can't represent whether it's in an even count. So, condition III can't be expressed.

Wait, but that can't be right because in the question, I'm supposed to choose which can be expressed.

So, perhaps only condition I can be expressed.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again: perhaps condition II can be expressed as p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4 ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ ¬p4) ... but without using negation, I can't represent that p4 is false. So, I can't express condition II.

So, the conclusion is that only condition I can be expressed.

Wait, but earlier I thought that condition I can be expressed, but maybe I'm wrong because I'm not considering the actual formula.

Wait, another way to think about condition I: At least three variables are true. So, the formula would be the OR of all possible three-variable conjunctions and the four-variable conjunction. So, the formula is:

(p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4)

But wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term is a three-variable conjunction, but the overall formula is the OR of all those terms. Wait, but that would require a lot of terms, but perhaps it's manageable.

Wait, but how many terms are there? For four variables, the number of terms for exactly three is 4, and for exactly four is 1. So, the formula would have 5 terms.

But perhaps I can find a way to express condition I as a formula that's the OR of all possible three-term conjunctions and the four-term conjunction. But that would require a big formula, but it's possible.

So, condition I can be expressed.

Condition II: Exactly three. Without using negation, I can't represent that a variable is false, so I can't represent that a variable is in three. So, condition II can't be expressed.

Condition III: Even. Without using negation, I can't represent whether a variable is true or false, so I can't express whether it's in even count. So, condition III can't be expressed.

Wait, but then the question is asking which conditions can be expressed, and the answer would be only condition I.

But in the options given, option D is "Only I can be expressed".

Wait, but earlier I thought that condition I can't be expressed because I can't represent three variables. But perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in thinking that condition I can be expressed. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula for condition I can be expressed as the OR of all possible three-variable conjunctions and the four-variable conjunction.

Wait, but that seems correct.

So, the formula would be:

(p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4)

So, that would be possible. So, condition I can be expressed.

Condition II: Exactly three. Without using negation, I can't represent that a variable is false, so I can't express that exactly three variables are true. So, condition II can't be expressed.

Condition III: Even. Without using negation, I can't represent whether a variable is true or false, so I can't express whether it's in even count. So, condition III can't be expressed.

Wait, but then the answer would be D: Only I can be expressed.

But I'm not sure, because I thought that condition I can be expressed.

Wait, perhaps another approach: let me think of condition I as p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∨ p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p4 ∨ ... but without using negation, I can't represent the negation. So, perhaps I can't express condition I.

Wait, this is getting really confusing. Maybe I should look up if conditions can be expressed with just ∧ and ∨.

Wait, I recall that it's possible to express some conditions, like parity, with just ∧ and ∨, but not all. For example, the sum of variables can be expressed, but the count can't.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe it's possible to express the count with just ∧ and ∨.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the count as the sum of the variables, but in Boolean algebra, sum is not directly expressible. Unless using some kind of encoding.

Wait, another thought: perhaps condition I can be expressed as (p1 ∨ p2 ∨ p3 ∨ p4) ∧ (p1 ∨ p2 ∨ p3 ∨ p4) ... but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck and should proceed to think that condition I can be expressed, and conditions II and III can't.

But wait, the answer options are A: I only, B: I and II, C: I and III, D: I only.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D: I only.

But I'm not entirely sure because I'm not certain about condition II and III.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the answer options.

The question is asking which conditions can be expressed with just ∧ and ∨. So, the options are:

A: I only
B: I and II
C: I and III
D: I only

So, the correct answer is D: I only.

But wait, I'm not sure. Because I thought condition II can't be expressed, but now I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B: I and II.

Wait, but I'm not certain because I can't express condition II.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and condition II can be expressed.

Wait, another approach: perhaps condition II can be expressed as (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ ¬p4) ... but without using negation, I can't represent ¬p4.

So, I can't represent that p4 is false. So, condition II can't be expressed.

Wait, perhaps another way to express condition II is using the fact that three variables are true, so the formula would be (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4). Hmm, but that's the same as the formula for condition I, which is correct.

Wait, but that's the same as the formula for condition I, which is what I thought it could be expressed as.

But perhaps the formula for condition I is more complicated because it represents all the cases where three or four are true. So, perhaps condition I can be expressed, but condition II can't.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps condition II can be expressed as a formula that represents exactly three variables being true, which can be expressed as (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ ¬p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p4 ∧ ¬p3) ∨ (p1 ∧ p3 ∧ p4 ∧ ¬p2) ∨ (p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4 ∧ ¬p1). But without using negation, I can't represent ¬p4, so I can't express that p4 is false. So, condition II can't be expressed.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: I only.

Wait, but I'm not sure because I thought condition I could be expressed, but condition II couldn't.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that only condition I can be expressed.
</think>

After carefully analyzing each condition, it was determined that only condition I can be expressed using only conjunction (AND) and disjunction (OR).

**Answer: D: I only**
