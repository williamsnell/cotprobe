Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: If P(A) is 0.8, P(B) is 0.5, and P(A ∪ B) is 0.9. What is P(A ∩ B)?

The options are A through J, with various numbers. I need to find which one is the correct answer.

Hmm, I remember that the formula for the probability of the union of two events is P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). So that's the key here. Let me write that down.

So, given:
P(A) = 0.8
P(B) = 0.5
P(A ∪ B) = 0.9

I need to find P(A ∩ B). Let me plug the known values into the formula.

0.9 = 0.8 + 0.5 - P(A ∩ B)

Wait, let me calculate 0.8 plus 0.5. That's 1.3. So,

0.9 = 1.3 - P(A ∩ B)

Hmm, I need to solve for P(A ∩ B). Let me rearrange the equation.

P(A ∩ B) = 1.3 - 0.9

Calculating that, 1.3 minus 0.9 is 0.4. So P(A ∩ B) is 0.4.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.4, so that's the answer.

Wait a second, did I do the math correctly? Let me double-check. 0.8 + 0.5 is indeed 1.3. Then subtracting 0.9 gives 0.4. Yep, that seems right.

I think I got it right. So the correct answer should be G.

The formula for the probability of the union of two events is:

P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

Plugging in the given values:

0.9 = 0.8 + 0.5 - P(A ∩ B)

0.9 = 1.3 - P(A ∩ B)

Solving for P(A ∩ B):

P(A ∩ B) = 1.3 - 0.9 = 0.4

The correct answer is G, which is 0.4.

Answer: G
