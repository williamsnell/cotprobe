Okay, so I have this question about an air conditioner which is basically a refrigerator. I'm a bit new to thermodynamics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the air conditioner consumes 1.70 x 10^3 watts of electrical power. Wait, wait, 1.70e3 W is 1700 W, right? Because 10^3 is a thousand. Oh wait, no, wait. 10^3 is 1000, so 1.70e3 is 1700. Oh wait no, wait: 1e3 is 1000, so 1.70e3 is 1.7 * 1000, which is 1700 W. So, that's the power consumption.

It's an idealized Carnot refrigerator. Oh, right, Carnot engines are the most efficient possible engines, so the refrigerator should operate like a Carnot cycle. I remember that the Carnot cycle has four steps: isothermal expansion, adiabatic expansion, isothermal compression, and adiabatic compression. But wait, the question says it's a refrigerator, so the inside is the cold reservoir, and the outside is the hot reservoir.

The coefficient of performance (COP) is given as 3.30. Oh, right, for a refrigerator, the COP is defined as the heat extracted from the cold reservoir divided by the work input. So COP = Qc / W, where Qc is the heat extracted and W is the work done (which is 1700 J/s in this case).

Wait, but wait, the COP is given as 3.30. So COP = 3.30 = Qc / W. Hmm, so Qc would be COP multiplied by W. But wait, wait, no—wait, no, COP for a refrigerator is (Qc) / (W), so Qc = COP * W. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, the COP for a refrigerator is Qc / W, where W is the work done on the system. So, yes, Qc = COP * W. So, Qc = 3.30 * 1700 W.

Wait, but wait, 1700 W is 1.7e3 W. So, 3.30 * 1.7e3 = let's calculate that. 3 * 1.7e3 is 5100, 0.3 *1.7e3 is 510. So total is 5610 W. But wait, wait, that's per second. Oh right, because 3.30 is per second, so the Qc is in watts multiplied by a second, which gives joules.

Wait, but wait, the question is about a day, so 24 hours. So, we need to calculate the total heat extracted over 24 hours.

So, first compute the Qc (per second) which is 3.30 * 1700 = 5610 J/s. Then multiply by the number of seconds in a day. How many seconds in a day? 24 * 60 * 60 = 86400 seconds.

So, total Qc = 5610 J/s * 86400 s. Let me compute that.

Hmm, 5610 * 86400. Let me break it down. 5610 * 86400 = ?

Let me think: 5610 * 86400 = 5610 * 8.64e4.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 5610 * 86400.

Well, 5610 * 86400 = 5610 * (864 * 100) = 5610 * 864 * 100.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 5610 * 86400.

Let me compute step by step:

First, 86400 = 8.64e4.

So 5610 * 8.64e4 = ?

Wait, 5610 * 8.64e4 = 5610 * 86400.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 5610 * 8.64e4 = 5610 * 864 * 10^2.

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I can compute 5610 * 86400.

Wait, 5610 * 86400 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 5610 * 86400.

Let me compute 5610 * 86400 as follows:

5610 * 86400 = (5600 + 10) * (86400) = 5600*86400 + 10*86400.

5600 * 86400 = 56 * 1000 * 86400 = 56 * (86400 * 1000) = 56 * 8.64e7 (since 86400 is 8.64e4, multiplied by 1000 gives 8.64e7.)

Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled. Alternatively, perhaps I can see that 5610 * 86400 is 5610 * (8.64e4) = (5610 * 8.64) * 1e4.

So 5610 * 8.64:

Let me compute 5610 * 8 = 44880.

5610 * 0.64 = ?

Let me compute 5610 * 0.6 = 3366, and 5610 * 0.04 = 224.4.

So, 3366 + 224.4 = 3590.4.

So, total 44880 + 3590.4 = 48470.4.

Now multiply by 1e4: 48470.4 * 1e4 = 4.84704e9 J.

Wait, but wait, that's 4.84704e9 J. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, 5610 * 86400 = 5610 * 86400.

Wait, another approach: 5610 * 86400 = 5610 * (8.64e4) = 5610 * 8.64 * 1e4.

Compute 5610 * 8.64.

Let me compute that:

5610 * 8 = 44880.

5610 * 0.64 = 3590.4.

Adding them: 44880 + 3590.4 = 48470.4.

So, 5610 * 8.64e4 = 48470.4 * 1e4 = 48470.4 * 10000 = 484,704,000 J.

Wait, that's 4.84704e8 J.

But let me make sure. Because 86400 seconds is a day, and a day has 24 hours, 60 minutes, 60 seconds. 24 * 60 = 1440, 1440 *60=86400.

So, 86400 * 5610 = 484704000 J, which is 4.84704e8 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, the highest is A:5.5e8, which is 550,000,000 J, and F is 3.2e8, etc. So, 4.8e8 is option G.

Wait, but let me check if I got the COP correctly. Because sometimes I get mixed up.

The COP for a refrigerator is Qc / W, where W is the work done. So, 3.30 = Qc / W → Qc = 3.30 * W.

So, yes, Qc per second is 3.30 * 1700 = 5610 J/s.

But wait, wait, no. Wait, 1700 W is 1700 J/s, yes.

So, 5610 J/s * 86400 s = 5610 * 86400 J.

Which is 484,704,000 J, which is 4.847e8 J, so option G:4.85e8 J.

But wait, wait, looking at the options:

Options:

A:5.50e8

B:5.10e8

C:2.50e8

D:6.00e8

E:6.50e8

F:3.20e8

G:4.85e8

H:7.20e8

I:3.85e8

J:4.00e8

So, option G is the correct one, 4.85e8 J.

Wait, but I got 4.847e8, which is approximately 4.85e8, so yes, G is correct.

Wait, but wait, what if I made a mistake in the formula? Let me think again.

COP for refrigerator is COP = Qc / W → Qc = COP * W.

Yes, that's correct.

So, yes, the answer should be option G.

The question involves calculating the heat extracted from the house by an air conditioner operating as a Carnot refrigerator. The air conditioner consumes 1700 W of electrical power and has a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.30. The heat extracted, \( Q_c \), is given by \( Q_c = \text{COP} \times W \), where \( W \) is the work input.

### Step 1: Calculate \( Q_c \) per second
The work input is 1700 W (1700 J/s). Using the COP:
\[
Q_c = 3.30 \times 1700 = 5610 \, \text{J/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total heat extracted in one day
One day has \( 24 \times 60 \times 60 = 86400 \) seconds. The total heat extracted is:
\[
Q_c = 5610 \times 86400 = 484704000 \, \text{J} = 4.84704 \times 10^8 \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Match the result with the options
The calculated value of \( 4.84704 \times 10^8 \, \text{J} \) is closest to option **G: 4.85 \( 10^8 \, \text{J} \)**.
