Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compute the area of a triangle whose altitudes are 10, 12, and 15. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on triangle properties, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that in a triangle, the area can be expressed in terms of each altitude and its corresponding base. The formula is Area = (1/2) * base * height. So if I denote the sides opposite to the altitudes as a, b, and c, then I can write three equations:

Area = (1/2) * a * 10
Area = (1/2) * b * 12
Area = (1/2) * c * 15

Since all three expressions equal the same area, I can set them equal to each other. Let me call the area 'T'. So,

(1/2) * a * 10 = T => a = (2T)/10 = T/5

Similarly,

(1/2) * b * 12 = T => b = (2T)/12 = T/6

And,

(1/2)*c*15 = T => c = (2T)/15 = (2T)/15

So now, I have expressions for a, b, and c in terms of T. But I know that a, b, and c are the sides of a triangle, so they must satisfy the triangle inequalities. But maybe a better approach is to relate the sides and the altitudes.

Wait, another approach: I remember that the product of a side and its corresponding altitude is twice the area. So, a*10 = 2T => a = 2T/10 = T/5. Similarly for b and c.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the reciprocal of the altitudes. Because I remember that in a triangle, the reciprocals of the altitudes are proportional to the lengths of the sides. Let me explain.

If h_a, h_b, h_c are the altitudes opposite to sides a, b, c respectively, then the sides are proportional to 1/h_a, 1/h_b, 1/h_c. So, sides a, b, c are proportional to 1/h_a, 1/h_b, 1/h_c.

So, let's compute 1/h_a, 1/h_b, 1/h_c.

Here, h_a = 10, h_b=12, h_c=15.

So, 1/10 = 0.1, 1/12 ≈ 0.0833, 1/15 ≈ 0.0667.

So the sides are proportional to 1/10 : 1/12 : 1/15. Let's find a common denominator to make this easier. The denominators are 10, 12, 15. The least common multiple (LCM) of 10, 12, 15 is 60. So, converting each fraction to have a denominator of 60.

1/10 = 6/60

1/12 = 5/60

1/15 = 4/60

So the ratio of sides a : b : c is 6 : 5 : 4.

Wait, wait, because when you have proportions, 1/10 : 1/12 : 1/15, you can multiply each by the LCM, which is 60, to get 6,5,4. So the sides are in the ratio 6:5:4.

Wait, but actually, the sides are proportional to 1/h_a, 1/h_b, 1/h_c. So, the ratio is 1/10 : 1/12 : 1/15. To simplify this ratio, let's find a common denominator. Let me see, 1/10 = (6/60), 1/12 = (5/60), 1/15 = (4/60). So the ratio is 6:5:4. So the sides a, b, c are in the ratio 6:5:4.

So, let's denote the sides as 6k, 5k, 4k for some positive real number k.

Now, since a, b, c are sides of a triangle, the sides must satisfy the triangle inequality. Let's check:

6k + 5k > 4k: 11k >4k → true

5k +4k >6k: 9k>6k → true

6k +4k>5k: 10k>5k → true.

So, the triangle is valid.

Now, I can find the area using Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c is sqrt[s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.

But before that, let's find the actual lengths of the sides, but since k is a scaling factor, perhaps we can express the sides in terms of k and then find T.

But wait, perhaps it's better to compute the area using the sides and the altitudes, or using the reciprocal relations.

Alternatively, since the sides are proportional to 6,5,4, I can compute the area in terms of k, and then perhaps find k using the altitudes.

Wait, another approach: since the area is equal for all three expressions, perhaps I can find T in terms of k.

Wait, I can compute the area using any of the three expressions:

Area = (1/2)*a*h_a = (1/2)*(6k)*10 = (1/2)*60k = 30k.

Similarly, using b: (1/2)*5k*12 = 30k.

Same with c: (1/2)*4k*15 = 30k.

So, T = 30k.

Now, using Heron's formula, let's compute T.

First, compute semi-perimeter s: (6k +5k +4k)/2 = (15k)/2 = 7.5k.

Then, s = 7.5k, s-a = 7.5k -6k=1.5k, s-b=7.5k-5k=2.5k, s-c=7.5k-4k=3.5k.

So, Heron's formula says:

T = sqrt[s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)] = sqrt[7.5k *1.5k *2.5k *3.5k].

Let's compute the product inside the square root:

7.5k * 1.5k = (7.5 * 1.5)k² = 11.25k².

2.5k * 3.5k = (2.5 *3.5)k² = 8.75k².

Now multiply these two results: 11.25k² *8.75k² = let's compute that.

11.25 *8.75: 11 *8 =88, 11*.75=8.25, 0.25*8=2, 0.25*.75=0.1875. So adding all contributions:

88 +8.25 +2 +0.1875 = 98.4375.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 11.25 *8.75 as:

11.25 *8 = 90, 11.25*.75=8.4375. So total is 90+8.4375=98.4375.

Thus, s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c) = 98.4375k^4.

So, T = sqrt(98.4375k^4) = sqrt(98.4375) *k².

But we know that T =30k.

So, 30k = sqrt(98.4375) *k².

Divide both sides by k (assuming k ≠0):

30 = sqrt(98.4375) *k.

Compute sqrt(98.4375). Let's see: 98.4375 is equal to 98 + 0.4375 = 98 + 7/16 = since 0.4375=7/16.

Wait, 98.4375 = 98 + 7/16 = (98*16 +7)/16 = (1568 +7)/16 = 1575/16.

So sqrt(1575/16) = sqrt(1575)/4.

Let me factor 1575: 1575 = 25 * 63 = 25 * 9 *7 = 225 *7. So sqrt(1575) =15*sqrt(7). So sqrt(1575/16)=15√7 /4.

So 30 = (15√7/4) *k.

Solve for k:

k = 30 *4 / (15√7) = (120)/(15√7)= 8/(√7).

Rationalize denominator: 8√7/(7).

So, k = (8√7)/7.

Now, since T =30k, substitute k:

T=30*(8√7/7)=240√7/7.

Looking back at the options, option C is 240√7/7, so that must be the answer.
</think>

The area of the triangle is found by recognizing that the sides are proportional to the reciprocals of the altitudes (6:5:4). Using Heron's formula and solving for k, we find the area to be 240√7/7.

Answer: C: 240√7/7
