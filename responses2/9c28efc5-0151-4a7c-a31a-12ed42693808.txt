Okay, I need to solve this multiple-choice question about message encryption and decryption. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is: "The message must be encrypted at the sender site and decrypted at..." And the options are A through J.

Hmm, I remember that encryption is a process where data is transformed to prevent unauthorized access. It's typically done at the sender site, which is the source where the message is created. So encryption happens when the sender makes a request to the server or something, like sending a message over the network.

Then, when the message comes back, it gets decrypted. Decryption is the reverse process, where the server or receiver converts the encrypted data back into its original form. So decryption should happen at the receiver site, which is the destination location.

Looking at the options, the sender site is option B, and the receiver site is option H. So the message is encrypted at B and decrypted at H.

Wait, let me make sure. The question says the message is encrypted at the sender site, so encryption is done there. Then it's decrypted at... So the decrypting happens at the receiver's site. Therefore, the correct answer should be H: Receiver site.

The correct answer is H: Receiver site. The message is encrypted at the sender site and decrypted at the receiver site.

Answer: H
