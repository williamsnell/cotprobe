Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of ammonia. I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

The question is asking for the standard enthalpy change, ∆H°, for the reaction: NH3(g) + O2(g) → NO(g) + H2O(l). They've given me the enthalpies of formation for H2O(l), NH3(g), and NO(g), which are -68.32 kcal/mol, -11.02 kcal/mol, and 21.57 kcal/mol, respectively.

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy change of a reaction is calculated using the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants. The formula is: ∆H° reaction = Σ ∆H°f(products) - Σ ∆H°f(reactants).

So for this reaction, the reactants are NH3 and O2, and the products are NO and H2O. But wait, the problem statement says "combustion" of NH3. Oh, right, combustion reactions usually involve O2 as the oxidizing agent. So the balanced equation must be something like NH3 + O2 → NO + H2O, but I need to balance it.

Let me balance the equation first. Let's see:

On the left, we have NH3 and O2. On the right, NO and H2O.

So, NH3 has one N and three H. NO has one N and one O. H2O has two H and one O. So O is the limiting reactant here. Let me write the skeleton equation:

NH3 + O2 → NO + H2O

Let’s balance N first. One N on each side, so that's okay. Now H: NH3 has 3 H per molecule. H2O has 2 H per molecule. So I need to balance the H. Let's see:

Let’s find the smallest multiples. Let’s think about the coefficients. Maybe I can set up an equation for the H and O.

Let’s denote the coefficients as a, b, c, d for the reactants and products respectively. Wait, no, better to approach it step by step.

The unbalanced equation is NH3 + O2 → NO + H2O.

Breaking down each element:

N: 1 (left) → 1 (NO) → balanced.

H: left has 3 per NH3. So for each NH3, 3 H. On the right, each H2O has 2 H. So let me find the ratio. Let’s say x NH3 molecules. Then H on left is 3x. On right, H from H2O is 2y, where y is H2O moles.

So 3x = 2y → y = (3/2)x. Let's choose x=2 to make it integer. So 2 NH3 → 3 H on left. On right, 3 H2O molecules (3*2=6 H). So 2 NH3 → 3 H2O.

Now for O. On the left, O is from O2. On the right, O is in NO and H2O. So:

Left: O2 → O.
Right: NO has O, H2O has O. So O from O2 → O in products.

Let’s see: Each NH3 (2 molecules) produces NO, which has 1 O each. So for 2 NH3, that's 2 O from NO. Wait, no: 2 NH3 gives 2 NO (if I take x=2), so each 2 NH3 gives 2 NO, which is 2 O. So the O in products would be 2*1 (from NO) +3 (from H2O) → 5 O? Wait, no, 3 H2O would have 3 O, so total O on right is 2 O (from 2 NO) plus 3 O (from 3 H2O) → 5 O.

So O atoms:

On the left: O2. Each O2 molecule has 2 O. Let the number of O2 molecules be 'a'. So O atoms on left are 2a.

On the right: O from 2 NO and 3 H2O. So 2 O (from 2 NO) +3 O (from H2O) =5 O. So 2a =5 → a=5/2. But we can’t have a fraction here, so multiply all coefficients by 2 to eliminate fractions. So a=5, x=2.

Wait, let me correct that. If x is the number of NH3 molecules, and I set x=2, then the O from the products would be 2*(1) +3*(1) =5 O. So O from the left must be 5, so 2a =5 → a=2.5. But that's not possible, so perhaps I'm mixing up coefficients.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's balance the equation step by step.

The unbalanced equation is:

NH3 + O2 → NO + H2O

Let me balance N first. It's already balanced (1 on each side). So N is balanced.

Now H: on the left, each NH3 has 1 H. On the right, each H2O has 2 H. So for each NH3, we need H2O molecules. Let's find the coefficients.

Suppose 2 moles of NH3 → 3 moles of H2O. Because 2*(1) H = 3*(2) H. So 2 NH3 → 3 H2O.

Now O: 

Left side: O comes from O2. Right side: O from NO and H2O.

In the products: each NO has 1 O, and each H2O has 1 O. So for 2 moles of NH3 (producing 3 H2O), the O in products is 2*1 (NO) +3*1 (H2O) =5 O.

So O from the reactant side must be 5. Since O2 is diatomic, each molecule has 2 O. So 5/2 O2 molecules. But that's a fraction, which is not allowed. So to eliminate fractions, multiply all coefficients by 2.

So multiplied by 2: 

Left side: 2 NH3 + 2 O2 → 

Right side: 4 NO + 6 H2O.

Now, let's check all elements:

N: 2 on left (2 NH3) → 4 on right (4 NO). Wait, 2 NH3 gives 4 NO? Wait, no. Each NH3 gives 1 NO (each NO is 1 N). So 2 NH3 → 2 NO. But in the equation after multiplying, it's 4 NO on the right. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the balancing.

Wait, let me recount. The equation after setting x=2 (NH3→2 NH3): 

Balanced before considering O:

2 NH3 → 3 H2O.

So products: 2 NO and 3 H2O.

Wait, now O on products: 2*(1) (NO) +3*(1) (H2O) =5 O.

So O on left is 2 O2 → 4 O atoms.

So 4 O atoms on left, 5 on right. So not balanced.

Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the coefficients. Let me try a different approach.

Let me write the equation as:

a NH3 + b O2 → c NO + d H2O.

Now, balance N: a = c.

H: 3a = 2d.

O: 2b = c + d.

We can substitute a = c. So:

H: 3a = 2d → d = (3a)/2.

O: 2b = a + d = a + (3a/2) → 2b = (5a/2) → b = (5a)/4.

Since a, b, c, d must be integers, let's choose a multiple that makes them integers. The smallest such is a=4.

So a=4 → c=4.

d = (3*4)/2=6.

b = (5*4)/4 =5.

So the balanced equation is:

4 NH3 +5 O2 →4 NO +6 H2O.

Wait, wait. Let me check that.

NH3:4 → 4 NO → yes, 4 N.

H: 4*3=12 on left. On right, 6 H2O → 6*2=12 H. Okay.

O: Left side:5*O2 → 5*2=10 O. Right:4*NO (4*1=4 O) +6 H2O (6*1=6 O) → total 10 O. Balanced.

So the balanced reaction is:

4 NH3 +5 O2 →4 NO +6 H2O.

Now, the reaction is written in terms of the standard enthalpies of formation.

The formula for ∆H° for the reaction is:

[ Σ (products' ∆Hf° ) ] - [ Σ (reactants' ∆Hf° ) ] = (4*21.57) + (6*(-68.32)) ) - (4*(-11.02) +5*(-68.32) )

Wait, no. Wait, for the reaction:

Reactants: 4 NH3(g) +5 O2(g) → Products:4 NO +6 H2O(l)

So the formula is:

∆H° = [4*(21.57) + 6*(-68.32)] - [4*(-11.02) +5*(-68.32)]

Wait no, the formula is:

Sum of products' ∆Hf° minus sum of reactants' ∆Hf°.

Wait, let me write it correctly.

Each substance's ∆Hf° is:

NH3: -11.02 Kcal/mol

O2: 0? Wait, no. Wait, standard enthalpy of formation for O2(g) is zero because it's an element in its standard form. So O2(g) contributes nothing.

Wait, but in our reaction, the O2 is a reactant, so it's included as a reactant.

So the formula is:

∆H° = [ (4 * ∆Hf(NO) ) + (6 * ∆Hf(H2O)) ] - [ (4 * ∆Hf(NH3)) + (5 * ∆Hf(O2)) ]

Wait, no. Wait, all reactants are on the left, products on the right.

So:

Reactants: 4 NH3 +5 O2 → products:4 NO +6 H2O.

So the calculation is:

Products: 4*21.57 + 6*(-68.32)

Reactants: 4*(-11.02) +5*(0) → because O2's ∆Hf is zero.

So calculation steps:

First, compute the sum of products.

4 * 21.57 = 86.28

6 * (-68.32) = -409.92

Sum of products: 86.28 -409.92 = -323.64 kcal/mol.

Sum of reactants: (4 * -11.02) + (5 * 0) → 4*(-11.02) = -44.08

So ∆H° = (sum_products) - (sum_reactants) → (-323.64) - (-44.08) 

Which is: -323.64 +44.08 = -279.56 kcal/mol.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I got the signs right. The formula is:

∆H° = [sum_products] - [sum_reactants]

So sum_products is 4*21.57 + 6*(-68.32) → 86.28 -409.92 = -323.64.

Sum_reactants is 4*(-11.02) +5*0 → -44.08.

So subtracting: (-323.64) - (-44.08) → -323.64 +44.08 → -279.56.

So the answer is -279.56 Kcal/mol.

Looking at the options, option C is -279.56 Kcal/mole. So the correct answer would be C.

To calculate the standard enthalpy change, ∆H°, for the combustion of ammonia, NH₃(g), to produce nitric oxide, NO(g), and water, H₂O(l), we use the enthalpies of formation provided:

- ∆H°(H₂O(l)) = -68.32 Kcal/mol  
- ∆H°(NH₃(g)) = -11.02 Kcal/mol  
- ∆H°(NO(g)) = 21.57 Kcal/mol  

The balanced reaction for the combustion of ammonia is:

\[
4 \, \text{NH}_3(g) + 5 \, \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 4 \, \text{NO}(g) + 6 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
\]

The formula for calculating ∆H° for a reaction is:

\[
\Delta H^\circ = \left[ \sum \Delta H^\circ_{\text{f}}(\text{products}) \right] - \left[ \sum \Delta H^\circ_{\text{f}}(\text{reactants}) \right]
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the products' enthalpies of formation
\[
\text{Sum of products} = (4 \times \Delta H^\circ_{\text{f}}(\text{NO})) + (6 \times \Delta H^\circ_{\text{f}}(\text{H}_2\text{O}))
\]
\[
\text{Sum of products} = (4 \times 21.57) + (6 \times (-68.32)) = 86.28 - 409.92 = -323.64 \, \text{Kcal/mol}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the reactants' enthalpies of formation
\[
\text{Sum of reactants} = (4 \times \Delta H^\circ_{\text{f}}(\text{NH}_3)) + (5 \times \Delta H^\circ_{\text{f}}(\text{O}_2))
\]
\[
\text{Sum of reactants} = (4 \times (-11.02)) + (5 \times 0) = -44.08 \, \text{Kcal/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate ∆H° for the reaction
\[
\Delta H^\circ = \text{Sum of products} - \text{Sum of reactants}
\]
\[
\Delta H^\circ = (-323.64) - (-44.08) = -323.64 + 44.08 = -279.56 \, \text{Kcal/mol}
\]

### Final Answer:
The standard enthalpy change for the combustion of ammonia is **-279.56 Kcal/mol**, which corresponds to option **C**.
