Okay, so I've got this optics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see the question again.

The problem says: A thin lens has a focal length of 50 mm. We need to find the magnification for three different object distances. The object distances are 20 mm, -100 mm, and +100 mm. The options are A to J, each giving three magnifications. Hmm, so I need to calculate the magnification for each of these three object positions.

Wait, wait. Magnification in optics. Right, the magnification formula for a lens is m = - (image distance)/(object distance). But I have to remember that image distance depends on the object position. Oh wait, but wait, the focal length is given, which is positive 50 mm. Which means the lens is a converging one, right?

I think the sign conventions here matter. I remember that for lenses, the object distance (u) is positive if it's on the same side as the incoming light. But wait, wait, actually, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think: for a converging lens, if the object is placed beyond the focal length (so u > f), the image is real and inverted. When the object is exactly at f, the image is at infinity. When the object is between f and 2f (so u < f), the image is virtual and upright. Wait, but the signs can get tricky.

Wait, the lens formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. And magnification m = -v/u. So for each u, I can solve for v, and then find m. But I have to be careful with the signs.

Let's go step by step for each object distance.

First object: 20 mm. So u = 20 mm. Since the focal length is 50 mm, which is bigger than 20, so the object is within the focal length. That means the image will be virtual and upright. But wait, for a converging lens, if u is less than f, the image distance is negative. Because virtual images are considered on the opposite side, so image distance is negative.

Calculating v using the lens formula. Let me plug in the numbers: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. So f is 50 mm, u is 20 mm.

1/50 = 1/v + 1/20 → 1/v = 1/50 - 1/20. Wait, 1/50 minus 1/20. Let me calculate that.

The common denominator is 100. So 1/50 is 2/100, 1/20 is 5/100. So 2/100 -5/100 = -3/100. So 1/v = -3/100 → v = -100/3 mm ≈ -33.33 mm.

So the image distance is negative, so it's a virtual image. Now, magnification m = -v/u. So u is 20, and v is -100/3.

So m = - ( (-100/3) / 20 ) → let's compute that. The negatives cancel. So 100/3 divided by 20 is 100/(3*20) = 100/60 = 5/3. So m is 5/3. Wait, but wait a second: m is -v/u. So:

v is -100/3, u is 20. So - [ (-100/3) / 20 ] = - [ (-100/(3*20)) ] → which is - [ (-5/3) ] → 5/3.

Wait, but wait, in this case, the lens is converging. So when u is less than f, the image is virtual, so m is positive because image is upright? Wait no, no. Wait, for a converging lens, when the object is within f (u < f), the image is virtual, upright. Which means the magnification is positive. For example, say u=10, f=20. Then image is at v= (10*20)/(20-10) = 200/10 =20. So v is positive (real image), m = -v/u = -20/10 = -2. Wait but that's not upright. Wait, this is confusing me.

Wait, let me get the sign conventions straight. The magnification formula is m = -v/u. So for a real image (v positive), m is negative → image is inverted. For a virtual image (v negative), m is positive → image is upright.

So in this first case, u=20, f=50. So the object is within f. So image is virtual, so m should be positive.

Wait, in the calculation earlier, I found v = -100/3 ≈ -33.33 mm. So m is -v/u. v is negative here. So m = - ( (-100/3) /20 ) → which is - ( (-100/(3*20)) ), which is - ( (-5/3) ), so 5/3. Positive, as expected. So m is 5/3. That makes sense because the image is virtual and upright.

So first object: 20 mm → m=5/3.

Second object: -100 mm. So u is -100 mm. Wait, the object distance is negative. Hmm. I think negative object distance means the object is on the same side as the incoming light, but I have to be careful about that. Because in the lens formula, u is the object distance, but if the object is on the other side, u is positive. So, if u is negative, it's the same side as the incoming light. Wait no, wait: the standard sign convention is that u is positive if the object is on the same side as the incoming light (the object side), and negative if on the opposite side (the image side). So, for a converging lens, which is on the object side, if u is positive, the object is on the left, and the image is on the right if it's a real image.

Wait, but in this problem, the object distance is given as -100 mm. So u is -100 mm. So the object is on the opposite side of the lens. So for a converging lens, if the object is on the opposite side, what happens? Let me think. So, for u negative, the object is on the image side. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check the sign convention.

Ah, right: the standard convention is:

- Object distance (u) is positive if the object is on the object side (the side where light comes from). Negative if it's on the image side (opposite).

- So for image formation by a lens: 

- If u is positive and greater than f, the image is real, on the opposite side (so v is negative, since the image is on the opposite side of the object). 

- If u is positive and less than f, the image is virtual, on the opposite side (so v is negative). 

Wait, no, no. Let me correct: for a converging lens, when u is positive (object on the object side), 

- u > f → real image on the opposite side → v is negative. So image distance is negative. 

- u < f → virtual image on the opposite side → v is negative. 

- u = f → image at infinity.

Wait, so in this case, u is -100 mm. So the object is on the image side. So for a converging lens, if u is negative (object on the image side), what happens?

Hmm, maybe I should think of it as u is negative because the object is on the image side. Let's see. The lens formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u.

But for u negative, 1/u is negative. So:

1/f = 1/v + (1/u). Let's plug in f=50, u=-100.

1/50 = 1/v + (1/-100) → 1/50 = 1/v -1/100.

So 1/v = 1/50 + 1/100 = (2 + 1)/100 = 3/100 → v = 100/3 ≈33.33 mm.

So v is positive. So image is on the object side (since v is positive), meaning it's a real image. But wait, is that correct for a converging lens when the object is on the image side?

Wait, wait, no. For a converging lens, if the object is on the image side (u negative), the image is real and on the object side (so v positive). Because if you imagine the converging lens, when the object is on the other side (the image side), the image forms on the same side as the object (the object side). So in this case, v is positive.

So now, m = -v/u. Wait, u is -100 mm, v=100/3 mm. So m= -(100/3)/(-100) → (100/3) divided by 100 → 1/3. Wait, wait:

- m = -(v/u) → v is 100/3, u is -100.

So m = -( (100/3) / (-100) ) → 100/3 divided by -100 is (100/3) * (1/-100) = -1/3.

Then multiply by the negative from the formula: -( -1/3 ) → 1/3.

So magnification is 1/3.

Wait, but wait: m = -v/u. So substituting the values:

v is 100/3, u is -100.

So m = -( (100/3) ) / (-100) ) → (100/3) divided by 100 is (1/3), and negative signs cancel. So m = 1/3. So positive. So image is upright.

So for the second object, m=1/3.

Third object: +100 mm. So u=100 mm.

Since f is 50 mm, u=100 is greater than f. So image is virtual and upright. Let's calculate v.

Using the lens formula again: 1/50 = 1/v + 1/100 → 1/v = 1/50 - 1/100 = (2-1)/100 → 1/100 → v=100 mm. But wait, wait, since u is positive and greater than f, image is virtual. So v is negative. So wait, no: let me recalculate.

Wait, 1/50 = 1/v + 1/100. Let's compute 1/100 is 0.01, 1/50 is 0.02. So 0.02 = 1/v + 0.01 → 1/v = 0.01 → v=100 mm. But since u is positive and greater than f, the image is virtual, so v is negative. So v=-100 mm.

So v is -100 mm. Now, m = -v/u → v is -100, u is 100. So m = - (-100)/100 = 100/100 = 1. So m=1, which is upright. So the image is real, same size as object, and upright.

Wait, but wait, wait: no, because when u > f, the image is virtual and upright. So magnification m should be positive. Since u is positive, and v is negative, so m = -v/u = - (-100)/100 = 1. So that's correct.

So the three magnifications are:

1st object: 20 mm → m=5/3

2nd object: -100 mm → m=1/3

3rd object: +100 mm → m=1.

Looking at the options, we need to find which option has these three values: 5/3, 1/3, 1.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (4/3, 1/5, 0)

Option B: (5/3, 1/3, -1)

Option C: (2/3, 1/4, -2)

Option D: (2/3, 2/3, -1)

Option E: (3/4, 1/6, -1/2)

Option F: (4/5, 3/5, 2)

Option G: (3/5, 1/2, 1)

Option H: (1/3, 2/5, -3)

Option I: (3/2, 1/2, -2/3)

Option J: (1/2, 1/4, -4)

Hmm, the third object's m is 1, which only appears in option B and G. Option B has (5/3, 1/3, -1). No, that third value isn't 1.

Option G has (3/5, 1/2, 1). So no, that's not it.

Wait, wait a second, wait, the third object gave m=1, which is option B's third value. But option B's m3 is -1, which is wrong. Hmm, what am I missing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the third case. Let me recheck that.

Wait, third object: u=+100 mm. f is 50 mm. So u> f, so image is virtual, so v is negative.

Calculating v using 1/f = 1/v + 1/u.

1/50 = 1/v + 1/100 → 1/v = 1/50 - 1/100 = 2/100 -1/100 = 1/100 → v=100. But since u is positive and >f, image is virtual → v is negative. So v= -100 mm.

Then m = -v/u → v is -100, u is 100 → m = - (-100)/100 = 100/100=1.

So m=1. So the third object's m is 1, which is only in option B and G. But in option B, third is -1, which is wrong.

Wait, but wait! Maybe the third object is on the object side. Wait, the object is placed at +100 mm, which is on the object side. So for a converging lens, if the object is on the same side as the incoming light (positive u), and u>f, image is virtual, on the same side as the object (so v is positive? Wait, no: wait, no, earlier result: v is -100, which is on the opposite side.

Wait, but wait, when u is positive, but the object is on the same side as the incoming light (like in front), and u> f, the image is virtual and on the opposite side (so v is negative).

So for the third object, m=1 is correct. So looking at the options, the only option with m=1 is option B and G. So option B's third value is -1, which is wrong. Option G's third value is 1. So option G has (3/5, 1/2, 1). So the first two are 3/5 and 1/2. But wait, the first object's m was 5/3, which is 1.666. So none of the options besides J have 5/3 as first. Wait option J has first value 1/2. So no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the third case. Let me think again.

Wait, for the third object, u=100 mm, which is greater than f=50. So image is virtual, so in front of the lens. Or is it behind?

Wait, no, wait. The image is on the opposite side from the object. So if the object is on the object side (u positive), and u>f, the image is on the same side as the lens, but in front. So image is real and inverted. Wait, but that would mean the image is on the object side, which would require v positive. So m = -v/u. If v is positive, m is negative. But earlier calculation says v is negative.

Wait, now I'm getting confused about the sign.

Alternative approach: perhaps using the sign conventions correctly.

The standard sign conventions in optics are:

- Object distance (u) is positive if the object is on the object side (the side where light comes from) and negative if it's on the image side.

- Image distance (v) is positive if the image is on the image side, negative if on the object side.

- Magnification (m) is given by m = -v/u.

So for the third object, u=+100 mm.

Since u > f (50 mm), the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. So v is positive.

Wait, but this would mean: v is positive, so m = -v/u.

So v is positive, u is positive: m = - ( positive ) / positive = negative.

But that contradicts earlier conclusion.

Wait, so perhaps the third object's v is positive.

Wait, let's recompute.

Using the lens formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u.

f=50 mm, u=100 mm.

So 1/50 = 1/v + 1/100.

1/v = 1/50 -1/100 = (2-1)/100 = 1/100 → v=100 mm.

But wait, since u> f, image should be on the same side as the object, so v should be positive. So v=100 mm.

So m = -v/u → - 100/100 = -1.

Wait, so m is -1. So the third object's m is -1.

But earlier calculation said m=1. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait, let me recompute. Which sign is correct.

Wait, for u positive (object on object side), v positive (image on image side) → which implies the image is virtual. Or wait, no: when u is positive and greater than f, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. So v is positive.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I thought v was negative. So perhaps I made a mistake in that.

But why? Let me think of a real example. Suppose a converging lens of 50 mm. The object is on the object side at 100 mm.

So the object is on the far side of the lens, further away than the focal length. So the light passes through the lens, but the object is on the far side. Since the lens is converging, the light will bend towards the focal point. So the image will form on the same side as the object (the object side), meaning v is positive.

But according to the lens formula, 1/50 = 1/v + 1/100. So 1/v = 1/50 - 1/100 = (2-1)/100 = 1/100. So v=100 mm.

So v is positive, which means it's on the object side.

So according to the formula, m = -v/u = -(100/100)/(100) = -1.

Wait, so m is -1.

So the third object's m is -1.

So looking at the options, which one has first value 5/3, second 1/3, third -1?

Looking at the options:

Option B: (5/3, 1/3, -1)

Yes! So the magnifications are 5/3, 1/3, and -1.

So the correct answer is Option B.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the magnification for each object distance using the lens formula and sign conventions. The magnification is given by:

\[
m = -\frac{v}{u}
\]

where \(u\) is the object distance, \(v\) is the image distance, and the sign conventions are:

- \(u > 0\) if the object is on the object side (farther from the lens), and \(u < 0\) if the object is on the image side (closer to the lens).
- \(v > 0\) if the image is on the image side, and \(v < 0\) if the image is on the object side.
- \(m > 0\) for upright images, and \(m < 0\) for inverted images.

### Analysis for Each Object Distance

1. **Object distance \(u = 20 \, \text{mm}\):**
   - The object is on the object side, and \(u < f = 50 \, \text{mm}\).
   - The image is virtual, so \(v < 0\).
   - Using the lens formula:
     \[
     \frac{1}{50} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{20}
     \]
     Solving for \(v\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{50} - \frac{1}{20} = \frac{2 - 5}{100} = -\frac{3}{100} \implies v = -\frac{100}{3} \, \text{mm}.
     \]
   - Magnification:
     \[
     m = -\frac{v}{u} = -\left(\frac{-\frac{100}{3}}{20}\right) = -\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right) = \frac{5}{3}.
     \]

2. **Object distance \(u = -100 \, \text{mm}\):**
   - The object is on the image side (opposite of the object side).
   - The lens formula gives:
     \[
     \frac{1}{50} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{-100}.
     \]
     Solving for \(v\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{50} + \frac{1}{100} = \frac{2 + 1}{100} = \frac{3}{100} \implies v = \frac{100}{3} \, \text{mm}.
     \]
   - Magnification:
     \[
     m = -\frac{v}{u} = -\left(\frac{\frac{100}{3}}{-100}\right) = -\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{3}.
     \]

3. **Object distance \(u = +100 \, \text{mm}\):**
   - The object is on the object side, and \(u = f = 50 \, \text{mm}\).
   - The image is virtual, so \(v < 0\).
   - Using the lens formula:
     \[
     \frac{1}{50} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{100}.
     \]
     Solving for \(v\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{50} - \frac{1}{100} = \frac{2 - 1}{100} = \frac{1}{100} \implies v = -100 \, \text{mm}.
     \]
   - Magnification:
     \[
     m = -\frac{v}{u} = -\left(\frac{-100}{100}\right) = -(-1) = 1.
     \]

### Final Magnifications
- \(m_1 = \frac{5}{3}\)
- \(m_2 = \frac{1}{3}\)
- \(m_3 = 1\)

### Matching with Options
The correct option is **B: (5/3, 1/3, -1)**.

ANSWER: B
