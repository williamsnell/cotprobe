Okay, so I've got this problem here about modular arithmetic and prime numbers. Let me think through it step by step. The question is: If p is a prime number and a is an integer, what is (a^p - a) mod p? The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember something about Fermat's Little Theorem. Let me try to recall. Fermat's Little Theorem says that if p is a prime and a is not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 mod p. So, a^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p. If I multiply both sides by a, I get a^p ≡ a mod p. Oh, that's interesting because the expression in the question is (a^p - a). If a^p ≡ a mod p, then subtracting a from both sides would give me a^p - a ≡ 0 mod p. So that means (a^p - a) mod p is equal to zero. 

Wait, but what if a is divisible by p? Like, if a is a multiple of p, then a mod p is zero. Let's see, if a is 0 mod p, then a^p is also 0 mod p, so a^p - a is 0 - 0 = 0 mod p. So even in that case, it's zero. So regardless of whether a is divisible by p or not, (a^p - a) mod p equals zero.

Looking at the options, that's option E: 0. So I think the answer is E.

The correct answer is E: 0.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Fermat's Little Theorem:** For a prime p and integer a not divisible by p, a^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p. Multiplying both sides by a gives a^p ≡ a mod p.

2. **Subtracting a:** Subtracting a from both sides of a^p ≡ a mod p yields a^p - a ≡ 0 mod p.

3. **Case when a is divisible by p:** If a is a multiple of p, then a ≡ 0 mod p, and a^p ≡ 0 mod p. Thus, a^p - a ≡ 0 - 0 = 0 mod p.

4. **Conclusion:** In all cases, (a^p - a) mod p equals 0.

Answer: E: 0
