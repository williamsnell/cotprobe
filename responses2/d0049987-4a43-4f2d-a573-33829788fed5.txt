Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an airplane landing on a carrier deck. Hmm, the question is about finding the acceleration and the time it takes to stop. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the plane is landing at 150 miles per hour. Wait, that's a speed in miles per hour, but we're probably dealing with feet and seconds. So I need to convert that speed to feet per second. I remember that 1 mile is 5280 feet and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So 150 mph is... let's calculate that. 

150 divided by 3600 gives me the feet per hour, then multiplied by 5280 to get feet per second. Let me compute that: 150 ÷ 3600 = 0.041666... then multiply by 5280. Hmm, 0.041666 * 5280 = let's see, 5280/24 is 220, so 0.041666 is 1/24. So 5280 /24 = 220. Oh wait, no: 5280 * (1/24) is (5280/24)=220? Let me double-check: 24 * 220 = 5280. Yes, so 150 mph is 220 ft/s? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 150 mph is 150 miles per hour. So 150 miles is 150 * 5280 feet, but per hour. Oh wait, no, no, wait. Oh wait, no. Wait, 150 miles per hour is 150 miles in 60 minutes. So in feet per second, I should calculate it correctly.

Wait, another approach. 1 mph is 1.4666... ft/s because 1 mile per hour is about 1.4666667 feet per second. So 150 mph * 1.4666667 ft/s per mph equals 220 ft/s. Oh wait, I'm getting 220 ft/s. But wait, that seems high. Wait, no, 150 * 1.4666667 is 220? Let me compute 150 * 1.4666667. 150 times 1 is 150, 150 times 0.4666667 is about 70, so 220. So yeah, the initial speed is 220 ft/s.

Wait, but that seems very fast. Wait, that makes sense because 150 mph is about 220 ft/s, which is indeed a high speed. So the plane is coming to a stop, so the acceleration will be negative. Now, the problem says it's brought to a stop uniformly, meaning constant acceleration.

So, the problem gives us the initial speed (v0) as 220 ft/s, the final speed (v) as 0. The distance (d) is 500 feet. We need to find acceleration (a) and time (t).

I remember the kinematics equations. One of them is v² = v0² + 2a d. Since the plane stops, v is 0, so 0 = (220)^2 + 2a*(500). Let me compute that.

So 220 squared is 48,400. So 48,400 = 2a * 500. So 48,400 = 1000 a. So a = 48,400 / 1000 → 48.4 ft/s². But wait, since the plane is decelerating, the acceleration is negative, so a = -48.4 ft/s². That would be option B's acceleration. So that's matching one of the options. Looking at the options, option B has -48.4 ft/s² and 4.55 s. So the time is the next thing.

Now, to find time. I can use another equation: v = v0 + a t. So 0 = 220 + (-48.4) t. So, 220 = 48.4 t. Solving for t: t = 220 / 48.4. Let me compute that. 48.4 goes into 220... 48.4 * 4 = 193.6. 220 - 193.6 is 26.4. 48.4 * 0.5 = 24.2, so 26.4 - 24.2 = 2.2. So 4.5 (0.5) and another 2.2/48.4 is 0.0459... So total time is approximately 4.5459 seconds. Hmm, 4.5459 is approximately 4.55 seconds, which is option B's time.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let's compute 220 divided by 48.4. Let's see: 48.4 * 4 = 193.6, as before. 220 - 193.6 = 26.4. 48.4 * 0.5 = 24.2, so 26.4 -24.2=2.2. So 0.5 gives 4.5, and 2.2/48.4 = 0.0459. So 4.5459 seconds, which is approximately 4.55 s. So that's correct.

So the acceleration is -48.4 ft/s², time is 4.55 s. So looking at the options, option B says both. So the correct answer should be option B.

To solve the problem, we first convert the initial speed from 150 miles per hour to feet per second. Using the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{mph} = 1.4666667 \, \text{ft/s}\), we find:

\[
150 \, \text{mph} \times 1.4666667 \, \text{ft/s per mph} = 220 \, \text{ft/s}.
\]

The plane is brought to a stop with a uniform acceleration, so \(v = 0\). Using the kinematic equation \(v^2 = v_0^2 + 2ad\), we substitute \(v = 0\), \(v_0 = 220 \, \text{ft/s}\), and \(d = 500 \, \text{ft}\):

\[
0 = (220)^2 + 2a(500).
\]

Solving for \(a\):

\[
a = -\frac{(220)^2}{2 \times 500} = -\frac{48400}{1000} = -48.4 \, \text{ft/s}^2.
\]

Next, using the equation \(v = v_0 + at\), we solve for \(t\) when \(v = 0\):

\[
0 = 220 + (-48.4)t.
\]

Solving for \(t\):

\[
t = \frac{220}{48.4} \approx 4.55 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

Thus, the acceleration is \(-48.4 \, \text{ft/s}^2\) and the time required to stop is \(4.55 \, \text{seconds}\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**B: -48.4 ft/sec² and 4.55 sec**
