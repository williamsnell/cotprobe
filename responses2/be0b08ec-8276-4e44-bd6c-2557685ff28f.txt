Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about gene pools and equilibrium. Hmm, I remember from my biology classes that equilibrium in a population refers to a stable state where certain genetic factors aren't changing. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The question asks if complete equilibrium can exist in real situations. The options are A to J. Let me think about each one.

Wait, gene pool equilibrium... I think this is about when the gene pools in a population are stable. Factors like mutation, genetic drift, immigration, emigration, and natural selection can affect this. But what about other factors like gene flow or isolation?

Wait, wait. The options mention various factors. Let me go through them.

Option A: Genetic equilibrium can be achieved only through selective breeding. No, I think selective breeding is a way to change allele frequencies, not the equilibrium itself. Or is it? I'm a bit confused. Maybe selective breeding is a method, but equilibrium would require other factors.

Option B: Gene pool equilibrium maintained exclusively by mutation. No, I think mutation contributes but not the only factor. Natural selection and other forces are also important.

Option C: Disrupted only by natural selection. Wait, does natural selection disrupt equilibrium? No, I think it maintains it. So if natural selection is disrupting, the equilibrium is broken. So option C says it's disrupted only by natural selection, which would mean that natural selection is the only thing causing changes. That doesn't sound right. Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Like, if there's no gene flow, then natural selection maintains the equilibrium, so option C isn't correct.

Option D: Only large populations can achieve equilibrium. No, I think equilibrium is more about the balance than population size. Small populations or even large ones can have equilibrium, depending on the factors involved.

Option E: Complete equilibrium not expected. Hmm, I'm not sure. I remember something about gene flow and isolation affecting equilibrium. Maybe in some cases, it is possible.

Option F: Complete equilibrium can always be achieved. No, I don't think so. Because factors like gene flow and selection can break the equilibrium. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: Equilibrium when no gene flow. If there's no gene flow, maybe equilibrium is possible. Like, if the gene pool is isolated, perhaps it stabilizes. So G could be correct.

Option H: Equilibrium guaranteed by high mutation rate. High mutation might increase genetic diversity but maybe not necessarily maintain equilibrium. It might contribute but not guarantee.

Option I: Equilibrium possible if population is isolated. Yes, I think isolation (like in a closed system) can disrupt gene flow, so equilibrium is possible. So I is correct.

Option J: Random reproduction is common. I don't think that's true. Most populations have some form of reproduction that isn't completely random, perhaps some form of sexual reproduction. So J is probably incorrect.

So going back to the options.

The question is whether complete equilibrium can exist in real situations. So looking for which option is correct.

Option G: Equilibrium when no gene flow. If the population isn't exchanging genes with others, perhaps it can maintain a stable genetic equilibrium. So yes, G could be correct.

Option I says "complete equilibrium possible if population is isolated." Is that right? I think that's correct because when populations are isolated, gene flow is zero, so they can maintain their genetic makeup. So equilibrium is possible.

Wait, but what about option C? It says gene pool equilibrium is disrupted only by natural selection. That would mean natural selection is the only factor causing changes. But actually, other factors like genetic drift and gene flow can also disrupt it. So option C is incorrect.

Option I says complete equilibrium is possible if population is isolated. That seems correct.

So which options are correct? Let me read again.

Looking for the correct answer.

The question is whether complete equilibrium can exist in real situations.

Looking for which options are correct. 

Option I is correct. So the answer would be I.

Wait, but another possibility is option E: Complete equilibrium isn't always expected. But E is saying it can't be always achieved, which is correct because factors like natural selection can disrupt equilibrium. So E is incorrect.

So the correct options are looking for which is true.

So the correct answer is I. Therefore, in the options, E is incorrect, and others are either correct or not.

Wait, let me double-check each option.

Option I: "Complete equilibrium is possible if the population is isolated." Yes, isolated populations can maintain genetic equilibrium because gene flow is zero. So I is correct.

What about option G: "Equilibrium can be achieved when there's no gene flow." Yes, because if there's no gene flow, natural selection (and other forces) can maintain the equilibrium.

So both I and G are correct. Wait, but the options are single answers.

Wait, the question is whether complete equilibrium can exist in real situations. So which of the options state that.

Looking back at the options, which ones are true.

Option G: Equilibrium when there's no gene flow. That's correct.

Option I: Is it possible when the population is isolated. Yes.

So both I and G seem correct. Wait, but let's check the question.

Wait, the question is which of the options is correct. So the question is about which of the options is correct in the context of the question.

Wait, the question is phrased as, "Can complete equilibrium in a gene pool exist in real situations?" So it's a yes/no question about whether any of the options correctly describes the situation.

So if multiple options are correct, but in the given options, only one is correct. So I have to choose among the options.

Wait, let me think again:

Option G: Equilibrium when there's no gene flow. So yes, that's correct because without gene flow, the population can maintain its genetic structure.

Option I: "Complete equilibrium is possible if the population is isolated." That's also correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are such that only one is correct. So perhaps I and G are both correct.

Wait, looking again, the options are labeled A to J. Let me think about each option.

Wait, the question is about whether any of the options correctly describes a situation where equilibrium exists.

So, for option I: "Complete equilibrium is possible if the population is isolated." That's correct.

Option G: "Equilibrium can be achieved when there's no gene flow." Also correct.

Wait, but perhaps only one option is correct. Maybe the question is looking for the primary reasoning.

But perhaps the question is about which option is correct.

Wait, perhaps only option I is correct. Wait, in the options, E is saying it's not expected, but that's incorrect.

Wait, the question is whether equilibrium can exist in real situations. So the options give statements about what is possible.

So the correct answer is either I or G.

Wait, but in the options, each is a separate statement. So perhaps the correct answer is I, because when the population is isolated, equilibrium is possible.

Wait, the options are:

I: Complete equilibrium possible if population is isolated.

Which is correct.

G: Equilibrium when no gene flow.

Which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both I and G. But in the options, perhaps the user is only to choose one.

Wait, but the options are presented in a way that each is a possible answer. So if the question is whether "complete equilibrium can exist in real situations," the options present different scenarios.

Looking again, perhaps the correct options are I and G. Let me check each option.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each option.

Option E: Complete equilibrium not expected. No, that's not correct. Because in some isolated populations, equilibrium can exist.

So the correct answer is either I or G.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the answer I. So the correct answer is I.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about each option.

Option I: "Complete equilibrium is possible if the population is isolated." Yes, if the population is isolated, there's no gene flow, so factors like mutation and selection can maintain the equilibrium.

So I is correct.

Option G: "Equilibrium can be achieved when there's no gene flow." Also correct. Because if there's no gene flow, the population's genetic pool remains stable.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is both I and G. But the options are single answers. So the question is which statement is true.

Wait, perhaps the real question is whether equilibrium can exist at all, and which of the statements is correct.

Wait, the options are labeled A through J, and the question is whether each statement is correct.

So the question is whether any of the options correctly describes a situation where equilibrium can exist.

So the options:

I and G are correct.

Wait, but the options are A to J, and the question is which statement is correct.

So the options are:

A: Genetic equilibrium only via selective breeding.

B: Only via mutation.

C: Only disrupted by natural selection.

D: Only large populations.

E: Not expected.

F: Can always be achieved.

G: Equilibrium when no gene flow.

H: Equilibrium guaranteed by high mutation.

I: Possible with isolation.

J: Random reproduction is common.

So correct options are I and G.

But in the options, the answer is one letter. So perhaps the correct answer is I.

Wait, but the question is whether equilibrium can exist in real situations, so any of the options that is correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is I.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is I. So the correct letter is I.

Wait, but let me think again. Which of the options is correct.

The correct answer is option I.

Because if a population is isolated, there's no gene flow, so genetic changes due to other factors (like mutation) can maintain the equilibrium.

So the correct answer is I: Complete equilibrium is possible if the population is isolated.

So the answer is I.

To determine whether complete equilibrium in a gene pool can exist in real situations, we analyze the given options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Genetic equilibrium is not achieved solely through selective breeding; natural selection and other factors also play a role.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Mutation contributes to maintaining genetic equilibrium, but it is not the only factor.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Natural selection disrupts equilibrium, so it is not the only factor causing changes.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While large populations are generally considered, equilibrium is not exclusive to them.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Complete equilibrium is expected in isolated populations, such as in closed systems.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Complete equilibrium can be achieved, but it is not guaranteed.
- **Option G**: Correct. In isolated populations, no gene flow occurs, allowing natural selection and other forces to maintain equilibrium.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. High mutation rate does not guarantee equilibrium; other factors like gene flow and selection are also important.
- **Option I**: Correct. Isolation prevents gene flow, allowing equilibrium to persist.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Random reproduction is a common occurrence, not exclusive to real situations.

Both **Option G** and **Option I** are correct in their respective contexts. However, since the question asks for a single answer, **Option I** is the most accurate, as isolation is a common real-world scenario where equilibrium can exist.
