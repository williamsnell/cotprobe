Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about personal documents with closed access. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what that means, but I'll try to think it through. 

First, the question asks which of the given options is a personal document with closed access. I remember that closed access means that once you access the document, you can't read or modify it anymore. Like, maybe it's something you can only use once or a limited number of times.

Looking at the options: 

A is a school's academic calendar. I think this is something people can access multiple times because it's just a schedule. So probably not closed access.

B is a city's census data. Censuses are official records, so they're likely to be updated regularly, meaning closed access. But I'm not sure if that's the best fit here.

C is a restaurant's menu. That's a physical document, but it's printed and presumably you can order and eat multiple times. So probably not closed.

D is a national electoral register. This probably refers to voter registration lists. Voters can register or unregister multiple times, so I don't think it's closed access.

E is a company's balance sheet. Financial statements are official documents. They're updated regularly, so probably not closed.

F is a household account book. I recall that household accounts are like records that show how much money was spent and saved. Once you have them, you can't change them anymore. That sounds like closed access.

G is a government 'white paper'. I think white papers are official documents that outline policies or decisions. They might be shared among stakeholders but once they're published, they're considered final. So closed access here too.

H is the shares register of a business. That's like a record of stock shares. Once you have them, you can't change the shares anymore. Closed access again.

I is a public library catalog. Libraries have catalogues. You can check out books, but once you take them out, you can't return them or modify the information. Closed access.

So, the options with closed access are F, G, H, I, and maybe others. Let me double-check each.

F: Yes, household account books are records of transactions, so closed.
G: Yes, white papers are official and once published, they can't change.
H: Yes, shares registers can't be altered once they're recorded.
I: Yes, library catalogues have physical copies that can't be returned or changed.

Wait, the question is which is a personal document. So, perhaps F is the household account book, which is a personal document. Alternatively, G and H are more formal, but I think F is the most straightforward personal document with closed access.

Looking back at the options, the correct answers are F, G, H, I. But the options given are single letters, so the question is asking which one of the letters is correct. So, among the options, F, G, H, I are all correct. But the options don't include multiple letters. Wait, the options are A to I, each is a separate option.

Wait, the question is asking which of the options (A to I) is a personal document with closed access. So each option is a possible answer, and I need to pick the correct one.

So, F, G, H, I are all correct. But looking back, I think the question is probably looking for the most common example. Maybe the household account book is what I'm most familiar with as a personal document with closed access.

Alternatively, G and H are more formal and official, but they also are closed. But F is a household account book, which is a personal record.

So, the answer should be F: a household account book.

The household account book is a personal document with closed access because it is a record of transactions that cannot be changed or modified.

Answer: F
