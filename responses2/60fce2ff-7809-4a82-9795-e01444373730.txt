Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about capacitors, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's start by recalling what I know about capacitors.

The question is asking which option increases the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor. The options are A through H, with letters. I remember that capacitance depends on several factors, like the area of the plates, the distance between them, and the dielectric material between them.

Wait, the formula for capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is C = ε₀ε_r A / d, right? Where ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, ε_r is the relative permittivity (dielectric constant), and A is area, d is distance. So factors affecting capacitance are area, distance, and dielectric constant.

Let's look at each option:

Option A: Decreasing the voltage between the plates. Hmm, voltage is related to charge and capacitance. The formula is Q = CΔV. If capacitance increases and voltage decreases, the charge could stay the same, but capacitance directly affects how charge relates to voltage. But the question is asking how capacitance itself increases, not how charge behaves. So I think A is not the correct answer here because it's about voltage, not capacitance.

Option B: Using a dielectric with zero dielectric constant. Wait, the dielectric constant can't be zero. Because the dielectric constant ε_r is the ratio of the permittivity of the material to vacuum. So if ε_r is zero, that would imply ε = 0, which isn't possible because that would make the material have infinite permittivity, which isn't realistic. So using a dielectric with zero dielectric constant isn't possible. So option B isn't feasible. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Using smaller plates. Let's see, capacitance is proportional to area. So if the plates are smaller, A decreases. That would lower the capacitance. So C is not the answer.

Option D: Moving the plates closer together. Let me think. The formula has 1/d. So as d decreases, C increases. So moving closer (d becomes smaller) would make C larger. So D is a possible correct option.

Option E: Moving plates further apart. That would make d larger, so C would decrease. So E is wrong.

Option F: Increasing voltage. Well, if voltage increases, and assuming capacitance is constant, the charge Q would increase. But the question is about how capacitance changes. If voltage goes up, and the charge increases, but capacitance is already a function of other variables. So I think this option doesn't directly affect the capacitance. It would just change how much charge is stored for a given voltage. But the question is about increasing capacitance, so F is not the answer.

Option G: Replacing the dielectric with one of lower dielectric constant. Lower ε_r would reduce C, because capacitance is inversely proportional to ε_r. So G is the opposite of what we want, so it's worse for capacitance.

Option H: Increasing distance between plates. As I thought earlier, that would decrease capacitance. So H is incorrect.

So the options that affect capacitance: D and F. Wait, but wait. The question is asking which option increases the capacitance.

So D: moving plates closer, which makes d smaller, so 1/d increases. Correct. So D is a correct choice.

Wait, but wait another thing. What about F? If voltage increases, but the plates are farther apart, how does that affect capacitance? Because capacitance is C = Q/V. If V increases, but Q increases too, but the question isn't about how Q changes, it's about the overall capacitance. So the question is about the factor that increases C. So whether V increases and d decreases, or both, but the question is which option increases C.

Wait, let's think about each option's effect.

Option D: moving plates closer → d decreases → 1/d increases. So C increases. So D is correct.

Option F: increasing voltage. If the plates are fixed and the voltage increases, the capacitance is determined by the plates' properties, not the voltage. Because C depends on A and d, not V. So if you increase V, the charge Q increases, but C remains the same (if A and d don't change). So in this scenario, the capacitance doesn't change. The question is about which option increases capacitance.

So F doesn't increase C, it just increases Q for a given C. So F is incorrect.

So the correct options are D: moving plates closer, and possibly some others. Let me reevaluate the options.

Looking again, the question is about which option increases the capacitance. So which factor(s) affect C positively.

Option D: moving closer → C increases. Correct.

Option H: increasing distance → C decreases. So no.

Option F: increasing voltage → doesn't change C, only Q. So no.

Option B: using zero dielectric → impossible.

Option G: lower dielectric → C decreases.

Options A, C, E: they decrease C.

So the correct answer must be D or F? Wait, what's F? F is moving the plates further apart. So that would decrease capacitance. So F is not correct.

So the correct options are D and F. But the question asks which option, so maybe only one is correct.

Wait, wait. Let me think about each option again.

Wait, the question asks which option would increase the capacitance. So, which of the options A to H would lead to an increase in C.

Only D and F. But F doesn't increase capacitance, it increases charge.

Wait, but the question is which option increases C. So perhaps only D is correct.

Wait, but wait: is there any other option that might increase C?

Wait, option F is about increasing the voltage. So, if you increase the voltage, but the plates are fixed and the distance is fixed, then capacitance is C = ε₀ε_r A / d. So if voltage increases, but d and A are fixed, then Q increases. But C is determined by the plates, so C remains the same. So in this scenario, the capacitance doesn't change. So when you increase voltage, but the plates are closer or further apart, that's not the case. So the question is about how the plates are arranged, not the voltage.

So, the only option that increases C is moving the plates closer, D.

So the correct answer is D.

To determine which option increases the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor, we analyze the factors affecting capacitance based on the formula \( C = \frac{\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r A}{d} \), where \( \varepsilon_0 \) is vacuum permittivity, \( \varepsilon_r \) is the dielectric constant, \( A \) is the plate area, and \( d \) is the distance between the plates.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A: Decreasing the voltage between the plates**  
  Voltage affects the charge \( Q \) on the capacitor via \( Q = C \Delta V \). While capacitance \( C \) itself does not change, \( Q \) would decrease if \( C \) remains constant. However, the question asks about how capacitance increases, so this option is incorrect.

- **B: Using a dielectric material with zero dielectric constant**  
  The dielectric constant cannot be zero, as it would imply infinite permittivity, which is not physically possible. Thus, this option is not feasible and cannot increase capacitance.

- **C: Using smaller plates**  
  Capacitance is proportional to the plate area \( A \). Smaller plates would decrease \( A \), leading to a lower capacitance. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- **D: Moving the plates closer together**  
  Capacitance is inversely proportional to the distance \( d \) between the plates, as \( C = \frac{\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r A}{d} \). Moving the plates closer decreases \( d \), increasing \( C \). This option is correct.

- **E: Moving the plates further apart**  
  This increases \( d \), which decreases \( C \). Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **F: Increasing the voltage between the plates**  
  Voltage affects the charge \( Q \) but does not directly affect capacitance \( C \). Capacitance is determined by the plates' properties, not the voltage. Therefore, this option does not increase capacitance.

- **G: Replacing the dielectric material with one that has a smaller dielectric constant**  
  A smaller dielectric constant reduces \( \varepsilon_r \), which lowers \( C \). This option is incorrect.

- **H: Increasing the distance between the plates**  
  This decreases \( d \), leading to a lower capacitance. Thus, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The only option that increases the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is **D: Moving the plates closer together**.

**ANSWER: D**
