Question:

Congress has recently enacted a statute designed to prevent price gouging of gasoline by private retail sellers. To help administer the new statute Congress created a seven-member agency, four members of which were appointed by the President, two by the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House. The agency was authorized to issue rules interpreting regulations prescribed under existing federal law. It was also authorized to issue "cease and desist" orders after hearings against private retail sellers of gasoline who "intentionally engaged in price gouging. " In this regard, violations of the cease and desist orders were made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument against the authority of this agency?

Options:

A: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to interpret regulations without the approval of the President.
B: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to issue fines.
C: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to imprison private citizens.
D: Congress may not delegate enforcement of a federal law in any governmental body other than the U. S. Attorney General or the courts.
E: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make "cease and desist" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.
F: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make interpretations of existing federal laws.
G: Congress may not create an agency to regulate private business practices.
H: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to regulate prices.
I: Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency.
J: Congress may not delegate power to an agency without the approval of the Supreme Court.

Okay, so I've got this question about constitutional law, specifically about the power of agencies within the U.S. Congress. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a statute enacted to prevent price gouging. The agency created has several functions: issuing rules under existing law, and issue cease and desist orders after hearings, with consequences like fines and imprisonment if violated. The main question is which argument is the strongest against the agency's authority.

First, I need to recall the relevant U.S. Constitution and laws. The question deals with whether Congress can delegate power to an agency without proper approval. I think the key here is the concept of "checks and balances" and the separation of powers.

Looking at the options, option E says that Congress may not delegate to the agency to make "cease and desist" orders, with the consequence of imprisonment. That sounds like a violation of the First Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. Wait, but does making cease and desist orders fall under the First Amendment? I think the First Amendment covers the right to bear arms, but also, the 5th Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, " cease and desist" orders are part of the Fourth Amendment, specifically the right to remain silent or remain in a place. So the agency is being asked to issue such orders, which could be seen as an unreasonable search or seizure.

Wait, but the problem is about whether the agency can perform that function. The Fourth Amendment deals with the right to remain silent, but " cease and desist" is more about the right to express opinions. So I'm a bit confused here. 

Alternatively, maybe this is about the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. If the agency is supposed to issue cease and desist orders, which could be seen as a search for the reason behind the price gouging, that might be seen as an unreasonable search. So that could be a violation of the Second Amendment.

But looking at the options, option E says the agency can't delegate to issue these orders and the consequence is imprisonment. That aligns with the Second Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. So this would be a strong argument against the power of the agency to issue such orders.

Wait another angle: the agency was authorized to issue cease and desist orders after hearings. So the function is tied to the process of a hearing. But does that also go beyond the Second Amendment? Because a reasonable search for the cause of action could be a burden on privacy, but that's a broader issue.

Alternatively, what about the First Amendment? The First Amendment prohibits the use of a search or seizure to prevent the expression of a protected right. So if the agency is to issue cease and desist orders, that's about the right to remain silent. However, "remain silent" isn't exactly the same as "remain silent or remain in a place." The Fourth Amendment specifically prohibits a search or seizure for the purpose of keeping a person silent. So if the agency is to issue cease and desist orders, that might be seen as a search for the reason behind the action, which could be seen as a violation of the Fourth Amendment.

But I'm a bit torn between First and Fourth Amendment arguments. Let's think about the options. Option E specifically talks about the Second Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches. So if the agency is being asked to issue orders that could be seen as an unreasonable search for the cause, that would be a violation of the Second Amendment.

Another point: the Second Amendment applies to searches and seizures. The Fourth Amendment applies to keeping a person silent. So it's a bit different, but if the agency is to issue orders that, for example, require the government to explain why certain actions were taken, that's a Fourth Amendment issue.

Hmm. So which argument is stronger against the agency's power? The Second Amendment points out that making those orders could require a reasonable search for the cause, which the Second Amendment prohibits. The Fourth Amendment points out that it's about keeping a person silent. But which is the strongest argument?

Wait, the question is about the agency's authority. The options E, F, G, I, J suggest different things. Let's go through them.

Option E: Can't delegate to issue cease and desist orders with the consequence of imprisonment. That's about the Second Amendment. 

Option F: Can't delegate to issue fines. That's about the Fourth Amendment. 

Wait, but the problem is about the agency's power. The Second Amendment is about unreasonable searches and seizures, while the Fourth relates to keeping silent. So which of these is more relevant here?

The question is about the agency's ability to issue these orders. If it's about the Fourth Amendment, that's a more direct concern. The agency is being asked to issue orders that, when made, could be seen as a reasonable search for the cause. But the Second Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches, which would include any search to prevent a legitimate right. So if the orders are for the purpose of stopping price gouging by private sellers, it's a legitimate right, so a search for the cause could be reasonable. However, the Fourth Amendment prohibits keeping a person silent, which may not directly apply here.

Wait, another angle: " cease and desist" orders are made to prevent continuing a dangerous or offensive behavior. So if the government is to issue these orders, it's about keeping a person silent. But "remain silent" isn't exactly the same as "remain silent or remain in a place." The Fourth Amendment usually applies to a search or seizure for the purpose of keeping a person silent. So if the agency is to issue these orders, it's a violation of the Second Amendment because it's a search for the reason. Or the Fourth because it's about keeping silent.

Wait, but the second amendment's context is about a search for the cause of a right. So for example, if a government is searching for a reason for an illegal act, that would be an unreasonable search, which is prohibited by the Second Amendment. So if the agency is to issue cease and desist orders, that's a search for the reason behind the action, which is a violation of the Second Amendment.

Alternatively, if the orders are to keep silent, which is a Fourth Amendment issue, but the cause of action isn't about silence but about continuing a price gouging. So maybe the Second Amendment applies here.

So the options E and F are candidates.

Option E says the agency cannot delegate to issue cease and desist orders, and the consequence is imprisonment. That would be a Second Amendment violation.

Option F says the agency cannot issue fines, which is a Fourth Amendment violation.

Which is stronger? If the agencies are supposed to keep quiet, that's a Fourth Amendment issue. If they're to issue orders to stop the price gouging, that's a Second Amendment issue.

But the main question is about the agency's authority to issue these orders. If they can't, then that's a strong argument.

Wait, looking back at the options, option E is talking about making orders and the consequence being imprisonment. That fits the Second Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches.

Option G says Congress may not create an agency to regulate private business practices. That's about the Second Amendment, but the question is about the agency's ability to make specific orders.

Option I says Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority. But that's about checks and balances, which is a different topic. The question is about the agency's power to issue orders, not whether it can retain power.

Option J says Congress may not delegate without Supreme Court approval. That's about checks and balances, but the question is about what the agency is doing.

Option E seems to directly address the Second Amendment, which is a stronger argument against the power of the agency.

So I think the correct answer is E: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to issue cease and desist orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.
</think>

The question concerns the constitutional authority of a government agency designed to issue "cease and desist" orders after price gouging by private sellers. The agency's ability to perform these orders is evaluated against the Second Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. 

Option E directly addresses this by stating that the agency cannot delegate the power to issue such orders, with the consequence of imprisonment. This aligns with the Second Amendment's principle, as making these orders would require a reasonable search to prevent continuing a dangerous or offensive behavior, which is a violation of the Second Amendment. 

Other options, such as F, G, and J, address different aspects of the question, including the Fourth Amendment and agency power. While G and I are relevant, they pertain to broader checks and balances and the Second Amendment, respectively. E is the strongest argument because it specifically targets the Second Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches, directly addressing the agency's ability to issue cease and desist orders.
