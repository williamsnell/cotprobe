Okay, I've got this math problem here: I need to find the value of -18/7 divided by -6/5. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, when you divide fractions, I remember that you can multiply by the reciprocal. So, dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. That means instead of dividing by -6/5, I can multiply by 5/-6. 

Wait, both the numerator and the denominator are negative. Negative divided by negative is positive, right? So the negatives should cancel out. Let me write that down.

So, the expression becomes (-18/7) multiplied by (5/-6). Let me compute that. Multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result. So that's positive. 

Now, I can write the multiplication as (18/7) times (5/6). Let's do the numerators and denominators separately. 18 times 5 is 90, and 7 times 6 is 42. So, that gives me 90/42.

Wait, can I simplify 90/42? Let's see. Both are divisible by 6. 90 divided by 6 is 15, and 42 divided by 6 is 7. So, that reduces to 15/7. 

Looking at the options, I see option H is 15/7. So the answer should be H. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I mix up signs. 

Wait, the original numbers are both negative, so the result is positive. 90 divided by 42 simplifies to 15/7, which is positive. So yes, the correct answer is 15/7. That's option H.

The correct answer is H: \(\frac{15}{7}\).

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Divide the fractions**: \(\frac{-18}{7} \div \frac{-6}{5}\).
2. **Multiply by the reciprocal**: \(\frac{-18}{7} \times \frac{5}{-6}\).
3. **Simplify the signs**: Both negatives cancel, resulting in a positive.
4. **Multiply numerators and denominators**: \(18 \times 5 = 90\), \(7 \times 6 = 42\), giving \(\frac{90}{42}\).
5. **Simplify the fraction**: Dividing numerator and denominator by 6 gives \(\frac{15}{7}\).

Answer: H: \(\frac{15}{7}\).
