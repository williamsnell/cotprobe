Okay, so I've got this question about age discrimination in HR. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking why the psychologist needs to be aware that evidence of age discrimination exists when considering the firing of an employee. The options are A to J. Let me break them down one by one.

First, I remember that age discrimination is a legal issue that often relates to the firings of older employees. I think it's more common in older companies or in certain industries. I recall something about the age discrimination doctrine, which was established in the 1960s and 1970s. It's about whether an employer is discriminating against a group of employees based on age when promoting or firing.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: Only when the employee is over the retirement age. That doesn't sound right. Retirement age is more about stopping benefits, not directly about discrimination. Also, age discrimination isn't just about retirement; it's about past promotions and hiring practices.

Option B: Whenever an older employee is fired, regardless of the reason. Hmm, that doesn't sound specific. It's too broad. The reason might not be the issue; it's the age that matters.

Option C: Whenever the employee's age is considered in any employment decision. That seems more general. It's talking about the process of decisions, but the question is about why the psychologist needs to know, so perhaps it's more about when it's even applicable.

Option D: Whenever the employee's age, instead of performance, is the basis for firing. This seems directly related to the idea that age is the main factor. So if the psychologist uses age as the reason for firing, they're probably aware of age discrimination. But the question is why this evidence exists, so maybe this is about the purpose, not the condition.

Option E: Whenever a younger employee is hired to replace an older one. That seems more about recruitment, not age discrimination itself. The question is about the reasons for firing, so this might not be the right option.

Option F: Only when the employee has filed a formal complaint about age discrimination. That's probably too specific. The question is a general one about the existence of evidence, not the conditions under which it exists.

Option G: Whenever the affected employee can demonstrate substantial economic loss. This is about the outcome of the firing. If the employee has lost a lot of money, the company might be more likely to address age discrimination. But the question is about the existence of evidence, not the reason.

Option H: Whenever the affected employee can demonstrate substantial economic loss. Wait, that seems similar to G. Maybe it's a typo. Oh, perhaps it's the same as G, but I'll keep in mind.

Option I: Whenever a younger employee is hired to replace an older one. No, this is about the hiring process, not age discrimination.

Option J: Only when the majority of employees in a given age group are adversely affected economically. This seems to tie into the 1966 case where the majority affected would trigger age discrimination. So, if a company has a large enough group of older employees who've been promoted or fired, that could be a trigger.

Putting it all together: The question is about why the psychologist needs to know evidence of age discrimination exists when considering a firing. The most direct reason is that age is a factor in promotions and decisions, making it a trigger for age discrimination. The majority affected in an age group (Option J) would be the key point. So, the answer should be J. Only when the majority of employees in a given age group are economically affected would it matter. 

Wait, let me double-check. The case in 1966 was about age discrimination. The idea was that if a company has a majority of older employees who were promoted or dismissed, they might be violating the age discrimination laws. So, the psychologist would have to monitor cases where the affected employees are older and see if a majority have been fired or promoted in similar positions, which would indicate discrimination.

So, the correct answer should be J: only when the majority of employees in a given age group are adversely affected economically.

The correct answer is J. Whenever the majority of employees in a given age group are adversely affected economically, evidence of age discrimination exists. This aligns with the 1966 case where the majority affected would typically trigger age discrimination. 

Answer: J
