Question:

In the casino game of roulette, there are 38 slots for a ball to drop into when it is rolled around the rim of a revolving wheel: 18 red, 18 black, and 2 green. What is the probability that the first time a ball drops into the red slot is on the 8th trial (in other words, suppose you are betting on red every time-what is the probability of losing 7 straight times before you win the first time)?

Options:

A: 0.0333
B: 0.0256
C: 0.0202
D: 0.0053
E: 0.0101
F: 0.0112
G: 0.0179
H: 0.0278
I: 0.0074
J: 0.0158

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this probability question about roulette. Let me read it again. The question is about the probability that the first time a ball drops into a red slot is on the 8th trial. So, I think I need to calculate the probability of losing 7 times in a row and then winning on the 8th try.

Wait, in roulette, there are 38 slots: 18 red, 18 black, and 2 green. So, the chance of landing on red is 18/38, which simplifies to 9/19. That's about 0.4737. But wait, the question is about losing 7 times before winning the first red. So each time it fails, it's not landing on red, meaning it lands on black or green. 

So, the probability of losing a single trial (not getting red) is 20/38, which simplifies to 10/19 or approximately 0.5263.

I remember that in such a problem, we're looking for the probability of a certain event happening on the nth trial for the first time. This is a geometric distribution problem. The formula for the probability that the first success occurs on the nth trial is (1-p)^(n-1) * p, where p is the probability of success on a single trial.

But wait, in this case, the "success" is getting a red slot. So p is 18/38 (which is the probability of red). So, the probability of losing 7 times in a row would be (1-p)^7, and then multiplied by p for the 8th trial.

Let me compute that. So (1-p) is 20/38. Raising that to the 7th power: (20/38)^7. Then multiply by 18/38.

Wait, but let me think about that again. Because each trial is independent, the probability of losing 7 times in a row is (20/38)^7, and then the 8th trial is a success, which is 18/38. So, the total probability is (20/38)^7 * (18/38).

Let me calculate that. Let's compute (20/38)^7 first.

20/38 is approximately 0.5263. Raising that to the 7th power. Let me compute step by step:

0.5263^1 = 0.5263
0.5263^2 ≈ 0.277
0.5263^3 ≈ 0.277 * 0.5263 ≈ 0.1458
0.5263^4 ≈ 0.1458 * 0.5263 ≈ 0.077
0.5263^5 ≈ 0.077 * 0.5263 ≈ 0.0406
0.5263^6 ≈ 0.0406 * 0.5263 ≈ 0.0214
0.5263^7 ≈ 0.0214 * 0.5263 ≈ 0.0113.

So, approximately 0.0113 for (20/38)^7.

Then, multiply by 18/38, which is about 0.4737.

So 0.0113 * 0.4737 ≈ let me compute that.

0.01 * 0.4737 = 0.004737
0.0013 * 0.4737 ≈ 0.0006158
Adding them together: 0.004737 + 0.0006158 ≈ 0.00535.

Hmm, so approximately 0.00535, which is about 0.535%. Looking at the options provided.

The options are:
A: 0.0333
B: 0.0256
C: 0.0202
D: 0.0053
E: 0.0101
F: 0.0112
G: 0.0179
H: 0.0278
I: 0.0074
J: 0.0158

So the closest is option D, 0.0053. But wait, my calculation was approximately 0.00535, which is close to 0.0053. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me double-check maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me compute (20/38)^7 exactly.

Wait, 20/38 is 10/19. So (10/19)^7 * (18/19).

Hmm, perhaps using exact fractions could help. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (20/38)^7 * (18/38) = (20^7 * 18) / (38^8).

But that might be tedious, so maybe I can compute the exact decimal.

Alternatively, perhaps using logarithms could help, but that might not be the best approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 20/38 as 0.5263157895.

(20/38)^7 = (0.5263157895)^7.

Let me compute this step by step:

0.5263157895^2 = approx 0.277063
^3: 0.277063 * 0.5263157895 ≈ 0.145835
^4: 0.145835 * 0.5263158 ≈ 0.076545
^5: 0.076545 * 0.526316 ≈ 0.040438
^6: 0.040438 * 0.526316 ≈ 0.02133
^7: 0.02133 * 0.526316 ≈ 0.01130.

So, yeah, about 0.0113. Then multiply by 18/38, which is about 0.473684.

0.0113 * 0.473684 ≈ 0.00535.

So, about 0.00535, which is 0.535%.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.0053, which is the closest. So the correct answer is D.

The probability of losing 7 times in a row and then winning on the 8th trial in roulette is calculated using the geometric distribution formula. The probability of losing a single trial is 20/38, and winning is 18/38. 

The formula is: (20/38)^7 * (18/38) ≈ 0.0113 * 0.4737 ≈ 0.00535, which rounds to 0.0053.

Answer: D: 0.0053
