Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about globalization and its benefits. I need to choose which option is NOT a purportedly beneficial outcome. Let me think through each option.

The question asks which is not a purportedly beneficial outcome. So, I'm looking for the statement that's not considered a positive result of globalization.

Option A: The redistribution of wealth, addressing disparities through greater interconnectedness. I remember that globalization has led to more opportunities for people to move around the world, reducing income gaps. Also, economic disparities might be reduced because resources can be accessed more easily. So A is a positive outcome.

Option B: Growing sense of global community, leading to super-national identities from people feeling closer. I think globalization fosters community and shared identity. People might feel more connected to others, so their sense of belonging increases. This leads to super-national identities, which seems positive. So B is likely a benefit.

Option C: Sharing ideas, tech, resources benefiting human security. For example, medical advancements or efficient supply chains come to mind. It's clear that globalization can enhance human capabilities, so this is a beneficial outcome. So C is good.

Option D: A global market that can reduce poverty if left unchecked. Wait, this sounds like it's a negative outcome. Globalization can create big issues, like inequality. If unchecked, massive poverty could happen because people move between countries, creating economic disparities. Plus, the market might be too broad, leading to exploitation. So D is not a benefit.

So, the answer is D because it's not a supposedly positive outcome. It's more like a potential downside if not managed properly.
