Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again. It says, "Suppose a convex 3D object has k pentagonal faces and m hexagonal faces. All faces are regular. What is k?" And then there are six options given from A to J. Hmm, interesting.

Wait, what's the question asking? It's about the number of pentagonal faces, k, on a convex polyhedron where all faces are regular. I remember that convex polyhedrons are also known as convex solids. So, each face is a regular polygon, which could be triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.

I think this might relate to the concept of Platonic solids or Archimedean solids. Platonic solids are regular polyhedrons with all faces being the same regular polygon, same vertices, same edges. Archimedean solids are convex and have regular polygons for faces, but they're vertex-transitive, meaning each vertex is surrounded by the same arrangement of polygons.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The problem doesn't specify whether it's a Platonic or Archimedean solid. Hmm. Oh, wait, but the question is about a convex 3D object, which could be either. But wait, maybe it's a uniform polyhedron, which is a broader category that includes both Platonic and Archimedean solids.

Wait, but the question is about the number of pentagons, not the type. So, maybe it's a general convex polyhedron with regular polygonal faces. I'm not sure, but perhaps I can think about Euler's formula. Euler's formula is V - E + F = 2 for convex polyhedrons, where V is vertices, E edges, F faces.

Let me recall Euler's formula. It's V - E + F = 2. So, for a polyhedron with F faces, each being a regular polygon. Each face contributes a certain number of edges. Since each edge is shared by two faces, the total number of edges E is (n * F) / 2, where n is the number of edges per face. But wait, no, because each face is a polygon, so each face has equal number of edges. So for a face that's a pentagon, each face has 5 edges. So for F faces, each with 5 edges, the total count would be 5F, but each edge is shared by two faces, so E = (5F)/2. Similarly, for a hexagonal face, each face has 6 edges, so E = (6F)/2 = 3F.

Wait, but in this case, the object has both pentagonal and hexagonal faces. So total edges would be E = (5k + 6m)/2. Because each pentagonal face contributes 5 edges, each hexagonal contributes 6, and each edge is shared by two faces.

Wait, but let me think again. Each edge is shared by two faces, so the total number of edges is (number of edges from all faces) divided by 2. So, E = [k * 5 + m * 6] / 2.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the vertices. Each vertex is where several faces meet. In a regular polyhedron, the arrangement around each vertex is the same. For example, in a Platonic solid like the octahedron, each vertex is surrounded by three squares. But in the problem, the faces are pentagons and hexagons, so perhaps each vertex is surrounded by a combination of pentagons and hexagons.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the number of edges and vertices in a polyhedron. Let me try to write down the equations.

Let me denote:

- k = number of pentagonal faces
- m = number of hexagonal faces
- F = k + m (total faces)
- Each pentagonal face has 5 edges, each hexagonal has 6. So total edges from faces: 5k + 6m. But each edge is shared by two faces, so E = (5k + 6m)/2.

Now, using Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2.

But I don't know V. Hmm. I need another equation. Maybe I can relate the number of edges to vertices.

Alternatively, I can think about the number of edges around each vertex. Let’s suppose that each vertex is surrounded by a certain number of faces. For example, in a typical convex polyhedron, each vertex is where at least three faces meet. But in this case, the faces are pentagons and hexagons. So, each vertex could be where two pentagons and two hexagons meet, or some other combination.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the relationship between the number of faces and edges. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: each edge is shared by two faces. So, the total number of edges is (5k + 6m)/2.

Now, for each face, the number of edges is the number of sides. So, for the pentagons, each has 5 edges; for the hexagons, 6. So, the total number of edges is (5k + 6m)/2.

But since each edge is shared by two faces, this is correct.

Now, I need to find the number of faces, which is k + m. So, F = k + m.

Let me think if I can find another equation.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the number of edges to the vertices. Each vertex is where multiple edges meet, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, using the formula for the number of edges in terms of the number of faces.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula that relates the number of faces, edges, and vertices in terms of the number of sides each face has.

Wait, I think I can use the formula for the number of edges:

E = (n_p * k + n_h * m)/2, where n_p is the number of edges per pentagon, which is 5, and n_h is the number of edges per hexagon, which is 6. So E = (5k +6m)/2.

Similarly, the number of edges can also be expressed in terms of the number of vertices. Because each vertex is where a certain number of edges meet. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another approach: for each face, it has a certain number of edges, and each edge is shared by two faces. So, the total number of edges is (5k + 6m)/2.

But perhaps I can also compute the number of edges another way. Let's think about the number of edges around each vertex. Suppose each vertex is where t pentagons and s hexagons meet. So, each vertex is surrounded by t + s polygons. So, the number of edges around each vertex is t + s. But each edge is shared by two vertices, so the total number of edges is (V * (t+s)) / 2.

Hmm, but without knowing t and s, this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the number of edges to the number of faces and vertices using another formula.

Wait, I remember that in a polyhedron, the number of edges can also be calculated based on the number of faces and the number of edges each face contributes. So E = (5k + 6m)/2, as before.

But I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe I can use Euler's formula to substitute known variables.

Euler's formula is V - E + F = 2.

I have F = k + m, and E = (5k +6m)/2.

So, substituting, I have:

V - [(5k +6m)/2] + (k + m) = 2.

Let me rearrange this equation.

Multiply every term by 2 to eliminate denominators:

2V - (5k +6m) + 2(k + m) = 4.

Simplify:

2V -5k -6m +2k +2m =4.

Combine like terms:

2V -3k -4m =4.

So, 2V = 3k +4m +4.

Hmm, but I don't know V, so this might not help directly.

Wait, perhaps I can find another equation involving V. Let's think about the number of edges around each vertex. Each vertex is where several faces meet. For example, if a vertex is surrounded by one pentagon and one hexagon, then each vertex has two faces meeting at it. But in a convex polyhedron, each vertex is where at least three faces meet. So, maybe each vertex is where two pentagons meet and two hexagons meet, but that's a speculative assumption.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the average number of edges around a vertex. Let me think about the total number of face corners.

Each pentagonal face has 5 corners (vertices), and each hexagonal face has 6 corners. So, the total number of corners is 5k +6m. But each vertex is where several corners meet. Let's say each vertex has, on average, v corners meeting. So, the total number of corners is V * v.

But also, the total number of corners is 5k +6m.

Therefore, V * v = 5k +6m.

But I don't know v. Hmm. Maybe this approach isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula that relates the number of edges and the number of vertices in terms of the number of faces. Another approach is to use the fact that each face is a regular polygon. So, each pentagonal face has 5 edges, each hexagonal has 6.

Wait, perhaps I can find another relation. Let's see: each face contributes its number of edges, but each edge is shared by two faces. So, E = (5k +6m)/2.

But Euler's formula is V - E + F = 2.

So, V = E - F + 2.

Wait, so V = [ (5k +6m)/2 ] - (k + m) + 2.

Simplify that:

V = (5k +6m)/2 -k -m +2.

Multiply numerator terms:

V = (5k +6m - 2k -2m) / 2 +2.

Simplify numerator:

(3k +4m) / 2 + 2.

Which is (3k +4m +4)/2.

So, V = (3k +4m +4)/2.

Hmm, but I don't know V. So, I'm stuck because I have two equations but three variables (V, k, m) and I can't find a way to solve for k in terms of m or vice versa.

Wait, but perhaps I can find another relationship involving V, E, and F. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to express V in terms of k and m and substitute into Euler's formula.

Alternatively, maybe I can find another equation by considering the number of edges per vertex.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the fact that each vertex has the same arrangement of faces. So, if each vertex is surrounded by the same number of pentagons and hexagons, then each vertex has t pentagons and s hexagons meeting there. So, the number of pentagons around a vertex is t, and the number of hexagons is s.

Since each pentagon has 5 vertices, and each vertex is part of t pentagons, the total number of pentagons would be (k) = (t * V)/5. Similarly, the total number of hexagons would be (m) = (s * V)/6.

But this introduces another variable, t and s. I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can find an average. Wait, but without knowing t and s, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Wait, maybe I can find an equation based on the arrangement of faces around each vertex. For example, if each vertex is where two pentagons and two hexagons meet, that would be t=2, s=2. Then, k = (2V)/5, and m = (2V)/6. So, k = (2V)/5 and m = V/3.

But then, substituting into Euler's formula:

F = k + m = (2V/5) + (V/3) = (6V +5V)/15 = 11V/15.

E = (5k +6m)/2 = (5*(2V/5) +6*(V/3))/2 = (2V + 2V)/2 = (4V)/2 = 2V.

So, E = 2V.

Now, using Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2.

Substitute E and F in terms of V:

V - 2V + (11V/15) = 2.

Simplify:

- V + (11V/15) = 2.

Combine terms:

(-15V/15 +11V/15) = 2 → (-4V/15) = 2 → V = 2 * (-15/4) → V = -30/4 → V = -7.5.

Wait, that can't be right because V can't be negative. So, maybe my assumption about the arrangement of faces (t=2, s=2) is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps that's just a miscalculation. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, let me recompute:

E = (5k +6m)/2.

But k = 2V/5, m = V/3.

So, 5k = 5*(2V/5) = 2V.

6m = 6*(V/3) = 2V.

So, 5k +6m =2V + 2V =4V. Hence, E =4V/2= 2V. So that part's correct.

F = k + m = (2V/5) + (V/3) = (6V +5V)/15 =11V/15.

So substituting into Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2.

E is 2V, F is 11V/15.

So, V -2V + (11V/15) = -V + (11V/15) = (-15V +11V)/15 = (-4V)/15 = 2.

So, (-4V)/15 = 2 → V= 2 * (-15/4) = -7.5. Which is negative, impossible.

Hmm, that suggests that my initial assumption about the arrangement of faces (each vertex being surrounded by two pentagons and two hexagons) is incorrect. So, maybe the polyhedron doesn't have any vertices where two pentagons and two hexagons meet.

Wait, perhaps each vertex is surrounded by two pentagons and one hexagon. Let's try that.

So, t=2, s=1.

Then, k = (2V)/5, m = (1 * V)/6.

So, F = k + m = (2V/5) + (V/6) = (12V +5V)/30 =17V/30.

E = (5k +6m)/2 = (5*(2V/5) +6*(V/6))/2 = (2V + V)/2 = 3V/2.

Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2.

Substituting:

V - (3V/2) + (17V/30) = 2.

Let me compute each term:

V is V.

-3V/2 is -1.5V.

+17V/30 is approximately 0.5667V.

Adding them up: V -1.5V +0.5667V = (1 -1.5 +0.5667)V = (-0.5 +0.5667)V = 0.0667V.

So, 0.0667V = 2 → V ≈ 2 / 0.0667 ≈ 29.99, which is about 30.

But let's compute exactly:

V - (3/2)V + (17/30)V = (1 - 3/2 + 17/30)V.

Compute 1 as 30/30, 3/2 as (45/30), and 17/30 is as is.

So, 30/30 -45/30 +17/30 = (30 -45 +17)/30 = (2)/30 = 1/15.

So, 1/15 V = 2 → V=30.

So, V=30.

Then, F =17V/30 = (17 *30)/30 =17.

E =3V/2 = (3*30)/2=45.

Check Euler's formula: V -E +F =30 -45 +17= (30+17)=47-45=2. Yes, that works.

So, with V=30, F=17, E=45.

But wait, the problem states that the object is convex. So, how does this relate to the number of pentagons and hexagons?

In this calculation, we assumed that each vertex is surrounded by two pentagons and one hexagon, leading to F=17, E=45, V=30.

But the problem only asks for the number of pentagons, k.

In this case, k=2V/5 = 2*30/5=12.

So, k=12. Which is option D.

Wait, but wait, is this the only possible configuration?

Because in the problem, it's a convex 3D object with k pentagons and m hexagons, all regular. So, perhaps this is the only possible solution. Alternatively, perhaps there are other polyhedrons with more faces, but this is a common structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possibility of having more pentagons and hexagons. But in this case, the calculation led to k=12, which is option D.

So, the answer is D:12.
</think>

The problem involves finding the number of pentagonal faces (k) on a convex 3D object where all faces are regular. The object is described as having k pentagons and m hexagons, with all faces regular, and it is convex.

Using Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2) and the relationships between vertices, edges, and faces, we derived that the number of pentagons (k) is 12. This corresponds to the configuration where each vertex is surrounded by two pentagons and one hexagon, leading to a total of 17 faces, 45 edges, and 30 vertices.

Thus, the number of pentagonal faces is 12.
