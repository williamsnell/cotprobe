Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the characteristic of the ring Z_3 × 3Z. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on ring theory, but let me try to remember what I know.

First, I recall that the characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer n such that n times the multiplicative identity equals zero. If no such n exists, the characteristic is zero. So, I need to find the smallest n where n*(1,1) = (0,0) in the ring Z_3 × 3Z.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The ring is a product of two rings: Z_3 and 3Z. So, in terms of elements, each element is a pair (a,b) where a is in Z_3 and b is in 3Z. And the operations are component-wise.

The multiplicative identity in Z_3 is 1, and in 3Z it's 0, right? Because 3Z is the set of multiples of 3. So the identity element in the product ring is (1, 0).

Wait, no. Wait. Wait a second. The identity element in each component is 1 for Z_3 and 0 for 3Z. So the product identity in Z_3 × 3Z is (1,0). Because (a,b)*(1,0) = (a*1, b*0) = (a,0). But wait, in 3Z, 3Z is a ring where addition is mod 3? No, wait. Wait. Wait, 3Z is the set of all multiples of 3, like 0,3,6,9, etc. So it's a ring under addition and multiplication. But no, wait, 3Z is actually isomorphic to Z, but as a ring, it's just the multiples. So in 3Z, the additive identity is 0, and the multiplicative identity is 3, because 3*(1) = 3, which is congruent to 0 mod 3. Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the structure of the ring. The ring Z_3 × 3Z is a product ring. So, to find the characteristic, I need to find the smallest positive integer n such that multiplying the identity element by n yields (0,0).

The identity element e in Z_3 × 3Z is (1,0), because in Z_3, 1 is the multiplicative identity, and in 3Z, 0 is the multiplicative identity. So n*e = (n*1, n*0) = (n,0). We want this to be (0,0), which in the product ring would mean that each component is zero.

So for the first component, n ≡ 0 mod 3. So n has to be a multiple of 3. For the second component, n*0 is just 0, so that's fine regardless of n.

So the smallest n that satisfies both is 3. So the characteristic of the ring is 3.

Looking at the options, option G is 3. So the answer should be G.

The characteristic of the ring is determined by the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \cdot (1, 0) = (0, 0) \). In \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times 3\mathbb{Z} \), the identity is \( (1, 0) \). For \( n = 3 \), \( 3 \cdot (1, 0) = (3, 0) = (0, 0) \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times 3\mathbb{Z} \). Thus, the characteristic is \( 3 \).

Answer: G
