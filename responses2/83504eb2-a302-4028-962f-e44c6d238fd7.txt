Question:

Explain how the reduced personal risk of corporate organi-zation allows for greater efficiency.

Options:

A: Personal risk is reduced because corporate efficiency is directly tied to government subsidies.
B: Investors are less likely to undertake great risk if their personal liability is limited.
C: Corporate organization allows for risk to be shared among many individuals, leading to inefficiency due to too many decision-makers.
D: The risk in corporate organization limits efficiency.
E: Corporate structures eliminate all financial risks for investors, promoting reckless investment strategies.
F: The reduced personal risk is a byproduct of corporate taxation, which is the real driver of efficiency.
G: Efficient production means small-scale production.
H: Investors face increased personal risk in corporate organizations, which deters investment and reduces efficiency.
I: Limited liability feature of corporate organization induces investors to undertake the large risks necessary for large-scale production and efficiency.
J: Reduced personal risk comes from the ability to transfer shares easily, which has no impact on efficiency.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about corporate organizations and their efficiency. Hmm, the question is asking about how a reduced personal risk allows for greater efficiency. Let me think through each option carefully.

First, I need to understand the concept here. Corporate organization's reduced personal risk likely refers to how their structure and management might make it easier for investors to carry out certain risks. Or maybe it's about how corporate structures mitigate some risks, making it easier for investors to handle them.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Personal risk reduced because corporate efficiency is tied to government subsidies. That doesn't quite make sense. Government subsidies probably increase costs, not reduce risk. So probably not A.

Option B: Investors are less likely to take great risks if their personal liability is limited. That sounds plausible. If investors don't have to worry about their personal losses, they might be more cautious. But does that directly tie into efficiency? Not sure yet.

Option C: Corporate organization allows for risk sharing, leading to inefficiency from too many decision-makers. Wait, sharing risk would probably make it more efficient because it spreads costs. So inefficiency from too many people? That seems contradictory. Maybe C is not correct.

Option D: Reduced risk limits efficiency. Hmm, if personal risk is lower, maybe it's more efficient. Like, easier to manage and less waste. So maybe D is correct. Or maybe not, because efficiency is about overall productivity, not individual risk.

Option E: Structures eliminate financial risks, promoting reckless investment. That doesn't seem right. Financial risks are part of corporate operations, not elimination. So E might not be the right answer.

Option F: Reduced personal risk is a byproduct of corporate taxation, real driver of efficiency. This sounds promising. Corporate taxes are used to fund public services, like infrastructure or education. This could reduce personal tax burdens, making people more cautious. Reduced personal risk would lead to higher efficiency because people are less likely to take on too much. So F might be the correct answer.

Option G: Efficient production means small-scale. No, that's not right. Efficient production can be large-scale. So G is probably incorrect.

Option H: Investors face increased personal risk, which deters investment and reduces efficiency. If personal risk goes up, people invest less, so efficiency might go down. So H would say it's the opposite of the question, so probably not correct.

Option I: Limited liability induces large risks. Wait, limited liability means investors have less personal risk. If that's the case, they are more likely to take on high risks for high returns. But the question is about reduced personal risk allowing for efficiency. So I think I is the opposite scenario, not this question's answer.

Option J: Reduced risk comes from transferring shares easily. No, transferability isn't directly about risk reduction. More about control and communication. So J is not correct.

Now, let's think again. The question is about efficiency being increased by reduced personal risk. If corporate structures have less personal risk, maybe people are less likely to take on high risks. That could lead to more efficient operations because fewer high-risk behaviors. So F says it's a byproduct of corporate taxation, which is the real driver of efficiency. That makes sense because corporate taxes fund public services, which reduce personal tax burden, leading to less personal risk. So F is the right answer.

Wait, but what about option D? It says reduced risk limits efficiency. If the personal risk is lower, perhaps people have more efficient use of resources, leading to higher efficiency. But I think it's more about reduced personal risk making it easier for them to manage and reduce high-risk activities, which could lower inefficiency. So maybe F is the better answer.

The reduced personal risk in corporate organizations is best explained by the real driver of efficiency being corporate taxation, which funds public services and reduces personal tax burdens. This principle aligns with option F, which states that the reduced personal risk is a byproduct of corporate taxation, thereby promoting efficiency through lower personal risk.

**Answer: F**
