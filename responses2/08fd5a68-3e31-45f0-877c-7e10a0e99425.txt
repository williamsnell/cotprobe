Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of gas laws and stoichiometry. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that metallic sodium releases hydrogen gas. The reaction given is 2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g). So, every two moles of sodium produce one mole of hydrogen gas. That part seems straightforward.

The question has three parts: 

(a) Find the number of moles of hydrogen produced.
(b) Find the number of moles of water decomposed.
(c) Find the percent error in (a) if the hydrogen were dry, given the vapor pressure of water.

The given data: temperature is 25°C, pressure is 758 mm Hg, and the volume is 2.24 liters. Okay, so for part (a), I need to find moles of H2.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused about how to calculate moles when pressure is involved. I remember that the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But wait, the problem says it's collected at 25°C and 758 mm Hg. So pressure is in mmHg, but the ideal gas law uses atm. So I need to convert that.

Right, 758 mmHg is the pressure, and 1 atm is 760 mmHg. So 758/760 atm is approximately 0.997368 atm. Let me calculate that. 758 ÷ 760 = 0.997368.

The volume is 2.24 liters. Temperature is 25°C, which is 298 K. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

Using the ideal gas law, n = PV/(RT).

Let me plug in the numbers.

P = 0.997368 atm
V = 2.24 L
R = 0.0821
T = 298 K

So n = (0.997368 atm * 2.24 L) / (0.0821 * 298)

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.997368 * 2.24 ≈ 2.237 approx.

Denominator: 0.0821 * 298 ≈ 24.4718.

So n ≈ 2.237 / 24.4718 ≈ 0.0913 moles.

Wait, but wait, the question is about H2 produced. So part (a) is approximately 0.0913 moles. Looking at the options, option F is 0.15 H2, option B is 0.0913, but wait, no, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 0.12 mole H2, 0.24 mole of water, 6%
B: 0.0913 mole H2, 0.183 mole of water, 3.24%
C: 0.2 mole H2, 0.4 mole of water, 5%
D: 0.085 mole H2, 0.17 mole of water, 2%
E: 0.05 mole H2, 0.1 mole of water, 1.5%
F: 0.15 mole H2, 0.3 mole of water, 4%
G: 0.1 mole H2, 0.2 mole of water, 2.5%
H: 0.095 mole H2, 0.19 mole of water, 3.5%
I: 0.11 mole H2, 0.22 mole of water, 4.5%
J: 0.075 mole H2, 0.15 mole of water, 2.8%

So option B says 0.0913 H2, which matches our calculation. So part (a) is 0.0913 mol.

Wait, but wait—the reaction produces 1 mole of H2 per 2 moles of Na, but the problem is about the gas produced. So for part (a), yes, it's 0.0913. But wait, the options don't have F: 0.15 H2, which is double that. Did I make a mistake? Let me check.

Wait, wait. The volume given is 2.24 liters. Oh, wait! 2.24 liters is exactly 1 mole at STP (0°C, 1 atm). But in this case, the pressure is less than 1 atm, and temperature is 25°C. So the volume is less. So the calculation I did with PV = nRT should give the correct n.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute it more precisely.

n = (758 mmHg / 760) * (2.24 L) / (0.0821 * 298)

So 758/760 = 0.997368421.

Multiply by 2.24: 0.997368421 * 2.24 ≈ 2.2366 L·mmHg.

Because R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but pressure is in mmHg, which is 1 atm = 760 mmHg.

So 2.2366 L·mmHg / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 298 K) = 2.2366 / (24.4718) ≈ 0.0913 mol. So that's correct.

Therefore, part (a) is 0.0913 mol H2. Looking at the options, option B says 0.0913 for H2, so that's part (a) done.

Part (b) is the moles of water decomposed. The reaction is 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) → Na2O2 + 2H2O. So for every 1 mole of H2, 2 moles of NaOH are produced, and 2 moles of water are produced.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the reaction is 2Na + 2H2O → 2NaOH + H2. So 1 mole H2 is produced, which corresponds to 2 moles Na and 2 moles NaOH. Then, 2 moles H2O are produced. So the mole ratio is 1 H2 → 2 H2O.

So if part (a) is 0.0913 moles H2, then part (b) is 0.0913 * 2 = 0.1826, approximately 0.183 moles of water.

Looking back at the options, option B says 0.0913 H2 and 0.183 water. So that matches, so part (b) is correct.

Part (c) is the percent error if the hydrogen were dry. So the question is, what's the percent error between the dry calculation and the actual (which has H2 and water vapor).

Wait, wait. Let me see. The vapor pressure of water at 25°C is 23.8 mmHg. So if the hydrogen had been collected dry, what would the pressure be?

In the real situation, the collected H2 is at 758 mmHg, but the vapor pressure of water is 23.8 mmHg. So the actual pressure is 758 - 23.8 = 734.2 mmHg. If it were dry, the pressure would be 758 mmHg.

So the problem is: if the hydrogen were dry (so the pressure would be 758 mmHg), but the actual pressure is 734.2 mmHg.

Wait, but the question is about the percent error in part (a). So part (a) would be based on a pressure of 758, but the real pressure is lower because of the water vapor.

So the percent error is calculated as (actual value - theoretical value) / theoretical value * 100.

Wait, in this case, the theoretical part (a) is based on the real pressure. But wait, no: the percent error is based on the assumption that the hydrogen is dry, hence the pressure would be higher.

Wait, the formula for percent error when the actual value is known can be tricky. Let me think.

Wait, the question says: "if the gaseous hydrogen had been collected dry, assuming the vapor pressure of water is 23.8 mm at 25 C." So the actual pressure is 758 mmHg, but the dry case would have a pressure of 758 mmHg (because water vapor is 23.8 would be subtracted, but if it's dry, the vapor is not present, so the pressure would be higher).

Wait, no. When water is present, the collected H2 is at a lower pressure because of the water vapor. So if the hydrogen was collected dry, the pressure would be higher than 758 mmHg by the vapor pressure.

So the pressure when the H2 is dry is 758 + 23.8 = 781.8 mmHg.

But wait, the question says, if the hydrogen had been collected dry, so the actual pressure would be 758 mmHg (since water vapor is not present). So the real pressure is 758 mmHg. The calculation for part (a) in the real scenario is based on 758 mmHg, but if it were dry, the pressure would be 758 mmHg. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Or am I getting this wrong?

Wait, wait. Let me see. The real pressure is 758 mmHg, which includes the water vapor. If the hydrogen were dry, the pressure would be 758 mmHg (since 23.8 mmHg is the vapor pressure, which is part of the collection). But wait, I'm a bit confused now.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the moles of H2 when the pressure is 758 mmHg (dry), and then compare it to what it was when it was collected with water vapor.

Wait, let's rephrase the problem. The question says, "if the gaseous hydrogen had been collected dry, assuming the vapor pressure of water is 23.8 mm at 25 C." So, the collection without water vapor (dry) would have a pressure of 758 mmHg, but the real case has a higher pressure due to water vapor.

But I'm getting tangled here. Let me think again. The data given is, the collected H2 is at 758 mmHg. The vapor pressure is 23.8 mmHg. So, the actual pressure is 758 mmHg, but the dry case would have a pressure of 758 mmHg (since the water vapor is not present). So the real pressure is 758, and the dry case is also 758. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think differently. The collected H2 is at a pressure of 758 mmHg when it's collected with water vapor. But if it were collected dry, the pressure would be lower. So the vapor pressure is the pressure of the water vapor when it's at equilibrium. So, if the hydrogen were collected dry, the pressure would be higher. So, the actual pressure is 758 mmHg (with water vapor), and the dry case would be 758 + 23.8 mmHg? No, that's not right. Because when you dry the gas, the pressure is the sum of the collected gas and the vapor pressure of water.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as:

In the real scenario, the pressure is 758 mmHg, which is the sum of the gas pressure (H2) and the vapor pressure of water. So, P_total = P_H2 + P_vapor.

So, P_H2 = P_total - P_vapor = 758 - 23.8 = 734.2 mmHg.

In the dry case (what if they had collected it dry), the pressure would be just P_H2, which is 734.2 mmHg.

Now, the question is, what's the percent error in part (a) if the hydrogen were collected dry. So part (a) is based on the real pressure (758 mmHg). But if it were dry, the pressure would be 734.2 mmHg.

Wait, but the problem says, "percent error in (a) if the gaseous hydrogen had been collected dry." So the theoretical value for part (a) in the dry case would be what was calculated using 734.2 mmHg. But wait, in the real scenario, the pressure is 758 mmHg, but part (a) is calculated based on the real pressure. So the percent error is comparing the two values.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the value in the dry case (734.2 mmHg) as the theoretical value, and the real value (758 mmHg) as the actual value.

So the percent error would be |(real - theory)/ theory| * 100.

So (758 - 734.2) /734.2 *100 = (23.8 mmHg) /734.2 mmHg *100 ≈ 3.24%.

Looking at the options, option B has 3.24% as the percent error, but option B says 0.0913 H2, 0.183 water, and 3.24%. So that would be correct for part (c).

So putting it together:

(a) 0.0913 mol H2.

(b) 0.183 mol H2O.

(c) 3.24% error.

Looking at the options, option B matches all three parts.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze each part systematically:

---

### Part (a): Number of moles of hydrogen produced

The reaction is:  
**2Na(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H₂(g)**  

From the ideal gas law:  
**PV = nRT**  

Given data:  
- \( P = 758 \, \text{mmHg} = \frac{758}{760} \, \text{atm} \approx 0.997368 \, \text{atm} \)  
- \( V = 2.24 \, \text{L} \)  
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)  
- \( T = 25^\circ \text{C} = 298 \, \text{K} \)  

Substitute into the formula:  
\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT} = \frac{(0.997368)(2.24)}{(0.0821)(298)} 
\]  
\[
n \approx \frac{2.2366}{24.4718} \approx 0.0913 \, \text{mol of H}_2
\]  

Thus, **0.0913 moles of hydrogen are produced**.

---

### Part (b): Number of moles of water decomposed

From the reaction, 1 mole of H₂ corresponds to 2 moles of NaOH and 2 moles of H₂O. Since **0.0913 moles of H₂ are produced**, the moles of H₂O decomposed are:  
\[
0.0913 \times 2 = 0.1826 \approx 0.183 \, \text{moles of H}_2\text{O}
\]  

Thus, **0.183 moles of water are decomposed**.

---

### Part (c): Percent error in (a) if the hydrogen were collected dry

If the hydrogen were collected dry, the pressure would be the sum of the collected hydrogen gas (758 mmHg) and the vapor pressure of water (23.8 mmHg):  
\[
P_{\text{dry}} = 758 + 23.8 = 781.8 \, \text{mmHg}
\]  

However, the question specifies the percent error in (a) if the hydrogen were collected dry. The theoretical value (collected with water vapor) is 758 mmHg, and the actual value (collected dry) is 758 mmHg (as the water vapor is not present). Thus, the percent error is:  
\[
\text{Percent Error} = \frac{|758 - 734.2|}{734.2} \times 100 \approx 3.24\%
\]  

Thus, **3.24% is the percent error in (a)**.

---

### Final Answer

The correct option is **B**, which states:  
- **0.0913 moles of H₂**  
- **0.183 moles of H₂O**  
- **3.24% percent error in (a)**
