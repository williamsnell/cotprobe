Okay, so I have this question about Ethernets and which statement is false. I'm a bit rusty on networking terms, but I'll try to think it through.

Ethernets, I remember, are a type of network protocol. They're similar to Ethernet, which I know connects devices using Ethernet cables. But wait, is Ethernets outdated or something? I think they were around before the widespread use of Ethernet. So Ethernets and Ethernet are related but different.

The question asks which statement is false. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Ethernet protocols use collision-detection to ensure messages are transmitted properly. I think collision detection is a feature in Ethernet to prevent collisions in the network. So A is true. So A is not the false statement.

Option B: Ethernets use circuit switching to send messages. Wait, circuit switching is a method used in networks where each device is connected to a set of switches (cables) that connect to a central hub. I don't think Ethernets use that. Ethernets are more about connecting devices through the network, not using circuit switching. So B might be the false statement. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Option C: Networks connected by Ethernets are limited in length to a few hundred meters. I think Ethernets are used for short-range communication, like up to a few hundred meters. That makes sense because they're for local area networks (LANs) and use a single bus topology. So C is true. So C is not the false statement.

Option D: Ethernets use buses with multiple masters. Wait, buses are physical lines, right? I remember that Ethernet uses a single master per bus and uses CSMA/CD for collision detection. But Ethernets, I think, use a single master per bus as well, but perhaps they have multiple stations connected via a single master. But wait, no. Ethernets are part of the networking stack before Ethernet. They were an alternative to Ethernet. So maybe Ethernets use a single master per bus, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe they have multiple masters. Hmm. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: What's each option's truth value.

A: True, since Ethernet uses collision detection. So A is correct, not false.

B: I'm not so sure. Circuit switching is more about gateways. Ethernets are about connecting devices, not using that. So statement B would be false. So if B is false, that would make it the correct answer. But wait, I need to verify.

C: True, as Ethernets are used for short distances.

D: So, Ethernets are part of a bus infrastructure. Do they use multiple masters per bus? Wait, in Ethernets, each station is connected to a central bus, which has one master. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Ethernets have multiple masters per bus. Wait, I'm recalling that Ethernets use a single master per bus but a single station connected to it. So D says Ethernets use buses with multiple masters. That would be false. So D would be the false statement. 

Wait, but I thought Ethernets may have multiple masters. Or perhaps not. Let me get this straight. 

Wait, in the networking hierarchy, Ethernets were a network abstraction layer, used for a local area network. They are part of the networking stack before Ethernet. So the structures are similar to Ethernet but older.

Ethernets use a single master per bus, and each station is connected to that master. So there's only one master per bus, not multiple. So D says Ethernets use buses with multiple masters. That would be false. So D is the false statement.

But wait, the options are A, B, C, D, E (but the options don't have E). Let me recap.

The options:

A: True.

B: False? Because Ethernets don't use circuit switching.

C: True.

D: False because Ethernets don't have multiple masters per bus.

So the question is which is FALSE. So the false statements are B and D. Which one is the option.

The question says, which statement is typically FALSE. So the answer is either B or D.

Wait, let's think again about circuit switching. I think circuit switching is part of packet switching. So Ethernets are more about connecting devices through a network, not using that method. So B is false.

D says Ethernets use buses with multiple masters. If Ethernets use a single master per bus, then D is false. So the false statement is B.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think about what Ethernets are like. I think that Ethernets are used for short-range communication, like in industrial or personal networks. They use a single master per network interface card. So buses have one master. So D is claiming multiple masters, which would be incorrect. So D is false.

So the false statements are B and D? Or only one.

Wait, the question is which is false. So the answer is either B or D. Let me check the options again.

Option B: Ethernets use circuit switching to send messages. No, circuit switching is for gateways. So B is false.

Option D: Ethernets use buses with multiple masters. No, Ethernets have one master per bus. So D is false.

Wait, but the options say which is FALSE. So perhaps both B and D are false, but looking at the options, the question expects a single answer.

Wait, let me get this straight. I think Ethernets are used for short ranges and have a single master per bus. So D is false. 

So the statements that are false:

B: Ethernets use circuit switching. Incorrect.

D: Ethernets use multiple masters. Incorrect.

Wait, but the question is which is typically FALSE. So which one is the answer.

The question asks which statement is false. So if both B and D are false, but the options don't have both, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about Ethernets. Let me think again.

Wait, Ethernets are part of the networking stack before Ethernet. They're used for local area networks. They use a single master per bus, connected to a single station. So for Ethernets, each bus has one master. So D says multiple masters, which is incorrect, so D is false.

As for B, Ethernets don't have circuit switching. So B is false.

But the question is asking which is typically FALSE. So both B and D are false. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about Ethernets. Let me think about it again.

Wait, perhaps Ethernets do have multiple masters. No, I don't think so. I think each station is connected via a single master. So in Ethernets, each bus has a single master. So D is false.

Wait, but I thought that Ethernets have a single master per bus, but perhaps they have multiple stations connected via that master. So perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, maybe Ethernets have buses with multiple masters. But I'm not sure. I think each bus in Ethernets is connected to a single master, so D is false.

So the options are:

Statement B: False.

Statement D: False.

But the question is which is false. So if both are false, but only one option is the answer, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between Ethernets and Ethernet. Let me check.

Ethernets are a network protocol, part of the networking stack before Ethernet. They are used for short-range communication. They use a single master per bus and each station is connected via that master.

So Ethernets don't use multiple masters. So D is false.

C is true.

So the false statements are B and D. But only one option is correct.

Wait, the question says which is typically FALSE. So if both B and D are false, but that's not the case because the options are exclusive.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about circuit switching again.

Circuit switching is a method used in networks, often in gateways or switches. It's not part of Ethernets. So statement B is false.

So the answer is B.

The question asks which statement about Ethernets is typically false. Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: Ethernet protocols use collision-detection to ensure messages are transmitted properly. This is true because Ethernet employs collision detection to prevent collisions in a network. Therefore, A is not the false statement.

- **Option B**: Ethernets use circuit switching to send messages. This is false because Ethernets are a network protocol used for short-range communication, and they do not use circuit switching. Circuit switching is a feature of packet switching, not Ethernets.

- **Option C**: Networks connected by Ethernets are limited in length to a few hundred meters. This is true because Ethernets are typically used for local area networks (LANs) and operate over short ranges, such as up to a few hundred meters. Therefore, C is not the false statement.

- **Option D**: Ethernets use buses with multiple masters. This is false because Ethernets are structured with a single master per bus, connected to a single station. They do not have multiple masters per bus. Therefore, D is the false statement.

Between options B and D, both are false. However, since the question asks for the false statement, and both B and D are incorrect, but only one option is to be selected, the most accurate false statement is **Option B**, as Ethernets do not use circuit switching.
