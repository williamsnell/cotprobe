Okay, so Mrs. Hilton wants to save $10,000 for a car in 10 years. She's looking at a savings account that gives 5% per year, compounded quarterly. She needs to figure out how much she should deposit each quarter. Hmm, I remember from my finance class that compound interest calculations involve some formula. Let me think about that.

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

Wait, but in this case, she's making regular deposits, right? So it's not just a single deposit; she will be adding a fixed amount each quarter. So I think this is an annuity due problem, where each deposit earns interest for a certain number of periods. Oh right, because each deposit is made at the end of each quarter, and each earns interest over time.

The formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity (where payments are made at the end of each period) is FV = PMT × [( (1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1 ) / (r/n) ].

Wait, but let me get the variables right. The current scenario is that she's going to deposit a certain amount every quarter, and each deposit will grow over the 10 years. So the future value of all the deposits together should equal $10,000.

So, in this case, n is 4 because it's compounded quarterly. The annual rate is 5%, so the quarterly rate is 5% / 4 = 1.25% per quarter, which is 0.0125 in decimal. The number of periods, t, is 10 years × 4 quarters/year = 40 quarters.

Wait, but the formula requires the number of periods as nt, which is 40. So each deposit is made quarterly, so each payment is a PMT, and the number of periods is 40.

So putting it all together, FV = PMT × [ ( (1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1 ) / (r/n) ].

We know that FV is $10,000. So,

10,000 = PMT × [ ( (1 + 0.05/4)^(40) ) - 1 ) / (0.05/4) ]

Let me compute (1 + 0.05/4) first. 0.05 divided by 4 is 0.0125. So 1 + 0.0125 is 1.0125. Now, raising that to the 40th power. Let me calculate that.

Wait, but I don't remember the exact value of 1.0125^40. Maybe I can approximate it or use logarithms, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can compute it step by step or use a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for compound interest on each deposit and sum them up. Oh wait, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the present value of an annuity formula, but no, that's for present value, and we're dealing with future value here.

Alternatively, I can use the formula directly. Let me compute (1.0125)^40.

Hmm, 1.0125^40. Let me think: 1.0125^2 is (1.0125 * 1.0125) = 1.02515625. 1.0125^4 is (1.02515625)^2 = approx 1.051171875. 1.0125^8 would be (1.051171875)^2 ≈ 1.10509463. Hmm, but 40 is 8 squared. Wait, 40 is 10 times 4, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it as e^(40 * ln(1.0125)).

Wait, but perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Alternatively, I can use logarithms. The natural logarithm of 1.0125 is approximately 0.01238. Multiplying by 40 gives 0.4954. Then e^0.4954 is about 1.642. So 1.0125^40 ≈ 1.642.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's precise enough. Alternatively, I can use the rule of 72 or some approximation. Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me calculate 1.0125^40 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula step by step. Let me compute ln(1.0125) = 0.0123855. Multiply by 40: 0.49542. e^0.49542 is approximately 1.642. So 1.0125^40 ≈ 1.642.

Wait, but wait, 1.0125^40 is probably a bit higher than that. Let me think, 1.0125^40 can be calculated as:

First, 1.0125^4 = 1.051171875.

Then, 1.051171875^10 would be (1.051171875)^10. Let me compute that.

1.051171875^2 = approx 1.10509463.

1.10509463^2 = approx 1.22133.

1.22133^2 = approx 1.49006.

Wait, but that's only 8 steps from 4^4 to 4^8. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting away. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for an approximate value. Alternatively, I can use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula in another way. Let me proceed step by step.

So, the term (1.0125)^40 is equal to approximately 1.6386.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it using a more accurate approach. Let me compute 1.0125^40.

Alternatively, I can use logarithms:

ln(1.0125) ≈ 0.012385.

n = 40, so 40 * 0.012385 = 0.4954.

e^0.4954 ≈ 1.6386.

So, 1.0125^40 ≈ 1.6386.

So, going back to the equation:

FV = PMT × [ (1.6386 - 1) / (0.0125) ]

Which is:

10,000 = PMT × (0.6386 / 0.0125)

Calculating 0.6386 / 0.0125 = 51.088.

So 10,000 = PMT × 51.088.

Therefore, PMT = 10,000 / 51.088 ≈ 195.65.

Wait, but let me compute 10,000 divided by 51.088 accurately.

51.088 × 195 = ?

51.088 * 200 would be 10,217.6. But 195 is 5 less. So 51.088 *5 = 255.44. So subtract 255.44 from 10,217.6: 10,217.6 - 255.44 = 9,962.16. Hmm, that's 195. So 51.088 *195 ≈ 9962.16. So 195 would give about 9962, but we need 10,000. So 195.65 is probably correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is $187.50, and option G is $194.21. So which is it?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, I think I may have made an error in calculating the (1.0125)^40. Let me recalculate that part.

Let me compute 1.0125^40 using a different approach. I can note that 1.0125^40 = (1.0125^10)^4. Alternatively, I can compute it step by step.

Compute 1.0125^1 = 1.0125.

1.0125^2 = 1.02515625.

1.0125^4 = (1.02515625)^2 = 1.051171875.

1.0125^5 = 1.051171875 * 1.0125 = let me compute that. 1.051171875 * 1.0125.

1.051171875 × 1.0125 = let's compute 1.051171875 * 1.0125:

1.051171875 × 1.0125 = 1.051171875 + (1.051171875 × 0.0125).

0.0125 × 1.051171875 = approx 0.013139648.

So total is 1.051171875 + 0.013139648 = 1.064311523.

So 1.0125^5 ≈ 1.064311523.

1.0125^10 = (1.064311523)^2.

Calculating that: 1.064311523 × 1.064311523.

Approximately, 1 × 1 = 1, 2 × 0.06 = 0.12, 0.00431 × 1 ≈ 0.00431, and 0.00431 × 0.06431 ≈ 0.000277. So adding all gives roughly 1 + 0.12 + 0.00431 + 0.000277 ≈ 1.124587. But precise calculation:

1.064311523 × 1.064311523 = ?

Let me compute 1.064311523 * 1.064311523:

= (1 + 0.064311523)^2

= 1^2 + 2*(1)*(0.064311523) + (0.064311523)^2

= 1 + 0.128623046 + 0.004135439

Adding those: 1 + 0.128623 = 1.128623, plus 0.004135 is 1.132758.

So 1.0125^10 ≈ 1.132758.

Now, 1.0125^20 = (1.132758)^2.

Calculating 1.132758^2:

1.132758 × 1.132758.

Let's compute 1.13^2 = 1.2769, but more accurately:

1 × 1 = 1.

1 × 0.132758 = 0.132758.

0.132758 × 1 = 0.132758.

0.132758 × 0.132758 ≈ 0.01762.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it as:

(1.132758)^2 = (1 + 0.132758)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.132758) + (0.132758)^2.

= 1 + 0.265516 + 0.01762.

= 1.283136.

So 1.0125^20 ≈ 1.283136.

Now, 1.0125^40 is (1.283136)^2.

1.283136 × 1.283136.

Calculating that:

1 × 1 = 1.

1 × 0.283136 = 0.283136.

0.283136 × 1 = 0.283136.

0.283136 × 0.283136 ≈ 0.08016.

So total is 1 + 0.283136 + 0.283136 + 0.08016 = 1 + 0.566272 + 0.08016 = 1.646432.

Wait, but precise calculation is better. Let me compute 1.283136 × 1.283136.

1.283136 × 1.283136 = ?

Let me compute 1.283136 × 1.283136 step by step.

First, 1 × 1.283136 = 1.283136.

0.2 × 1.283136 = 0.2566272.

0.08 × 1.283136 = 0.10265088.

0.003136 × 1.283136 ≈ 0.004025.

Adding these together:

0.2566272 + 0.10265088 = 0.35927808.

+ 0.004025 ≈ 0.363303.

So total is 1.283136 + 0.363303 = approximately 1.646439.

So 1.0125^40 ≈ 1.646439.

So going back to the equation:

FV = PMT × [ (1.646439 - 1) / (0.0125) ]

Which is:

10,000 = PMT × (0.646439 / 0.0125 )

Calculate 0.646439 / 0.0125 = 51.71512.

So, PMT = 10,000 / 51.71512 ≈ 193.48.

Wait, that's approximately $193.48.

Looking at the options, option G is $194.21 and option C is $187.50. So which is closer?

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me compute 10,000 ÷ 51.71512.

Let me compute 51.71512 × 193 = ?

51.71512 × 193:

51.71512 × 200 = 10,343.024.

Minus 51.71512 ×7 = 362.00584.

So 10,343.024 - 362.00584 = 9,981.018.

So 51.71512 × 193 = 9,981.018.

But we need 10,000. The difference is 10,000 - 9,981.018 = 18.982.

So 18.982 / 51.71512 ≈ 0.368.

So 193 + 0.368 = 193.368, which is approximately $193.37.

Hmm, but the options are G: $194.21 and C: $187.50. So between these, G is closer.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute 10,000 / 51.71512 properly.

51.71512 × 193 = ?

As I did before, 51.71512 × 200 = 10,343.024.

Minus 51.71512 ×7 = 362.00584.

So 10,343.024 - 362.00584 = 9,981.01816.

So 193 × 51.71512 = 9,981.01816.

The difference to reach 10,000 is 10,000 - 9,981.01816 = 18.98184.

So 18.98184 / 51.71512 ≈ 0.368.

So 193.368 is the approximate value.

Wait, but looking at the options, G is $194.21, which is higher than my calculation of about $193.37. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me compute the present value of each payment and sum them to get the FV. Suppose she deposits PMT at the end of each quarter. The present value of the first deposit is PMT / (1 + 0.0125) = PMT * 0.9876. The present value of the second deposit is PMT / (1 + 0.0125)^2 = PMT * 0.9753, and so on. So summing all these present values should give the FV of $10,000. Then, we can solve for PMT.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the sum S = PMT * [ Σ (1/(1.0125)^k) ) ] for k=1 to 40.

But perhaps this is complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula FV = PMT * [ (v^n - 1) / (v - 1) ) ], where v = 1/(1 + r/n).

Wait, but perhaps it's better to use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity, which is FV = PMT × [ (1 + r)^n - 1 / r ].

Wait, but in this case, r is 0.0125. But n is 40.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute (1.0125)^40 more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can use logarithms again. Let me compute ln(1.0125) = 0.012385. Multiply by 40: 0.4954. Now, compute e^0.4954.

We can use the Taylor series expansion for e^x around x=0.4954.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute e^0.4954 ≈ e^0.4954.

But perhaps using the approximation that e^0.4954 ≈ 1.6386.

Wait, but this brings me back to the same issue. So perhaps I should proceed with the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the initial calculation of the (1.0125)^40 term. Let me double-check that.

Wait, perhaps I can compute 1.0125^40 more accurately using another approach. Let me compute 1.0125^20 first.

As before, 1.0125^2 = 1.02515625.

1.0125^4 = (1.02515625)^2 ≈ 1.051171875.

1.0125^5 ≈ 1.051171875 × 1.0125 ≈ 1.064311523.

1.0125^10 ≈ (1.064311523)^2 ≈ 1.1323.

Wait, perhaps I can compute 1.0125^10 exactly.

1.0125^10 = (1.0125)^10.

We can compute it as:

1.0125 × 1.0125 × 1.0125 × 1.0125 × 1.0125 × 1.0125 × 1.0125 × 1.0125 × 1.0125 × 1.0125.

But perhaps it's easier to compute it as:

First, 1.0125 × 2 = 2.025. So 2.025^5.

Wait, 2.025^2 = 4.100625.

2.025^4 = (4.100625)^2 ≈ 16.82015625.

2.025^5 = 16.82015625 × 2.025 ≈ 34.0427734375.

Wait, but that's 2.025^5, which is different from 1.0125^10.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that 1.0125^40 ≈ 1.6386, and proceed with the calculation.

So, going back, FV = PMT × (0.6386 / 0.0125) = 10,000.

So 0.6386 / 0.0125 = 51.088.

So PMT = 10,000 / 51.088 ≈ 195.65.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is $187.50, and option G is $194.21. So which is closer?

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of (1.0125)^40.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using a different approach.

Let me compute 1.0125^40 by using the fact that 1.0125^10 = approximately 1.1323.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 1.0125^10 is 1.1323, which is correct. Let me double-check that.

Wait, 1.0125^10 is approximately 1.1323. Let's confirm that.

1.0125^1 = 1.0125.

1.0125^2 = 1.0125 × 1.0125 = 1.02515625.

1.0125^3 = 1.02515625 × 1.0125 ≈ 1.037736.

Wait, perhaps I can compute 1.0125^4:

1.037736 × 1.0125 ≈ 1.051171875.

1.0125^5 ≈ 1.051171875 × 1.0125 ≈ 1.064311523.

1.0125^10 = (1.064311523)^2 ≈ 1.1323.

Yes, so 1.0125^10 ≈ 1.1323.

So, 1.0125^40 = (1.1323)^4.

Let me compute 1.1323^2: 1.1323 × 1.1323 ≈ 1.282.

Then, 1.282^2 = approximately 1.645.

Wait, so 1.0125^40 ≈ 1.645.

So, recalculating with 1.645.

FV = 10,000 = PMT × (0.645 / 0.0125).

0.645 / 0.0125 = 51.6.

So, PMT = 10,000 / 51.6 ≈ 193.8.

So, approximately $193.8.

Wait, but the options are G: $194.21 and C: $187.50.

So, perhaps G is closer to $194.21.

But I'm getting approximately $193.8, which is closer to $194.21.

Wait, but perhaps I should check my earlier calculation again. Let me compute 1.0125^40 more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can compute 1.0125^40 as exp(40 * ln(1.0125)).

Compute ln(1.0125):

ln(1.0125) ≈ 0.012385.

Multiply by 40: 0.4954.

Compute exp(0.4954):

exp(0.4954) ≈ 1.6386.

So, 1.0125^40 ≈ 1.6386.

Wait, so redoing the calculation:

FV = 10,000 = PMT × (0.6386 / 0.0125).

0.6386 / 0.0125 = 51.088.

So, PMT = 10,000 / 51.088 ≈ 195.65.

Wait, but that doesn't align with the earlier result.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 0.6386 / 0.0125.

Wait, 0.6386 divided by 0.0125.

Well, 0.0125 × 51 = 0.6375.

So, 0.6386 is 0.6375 + 0.0011.

So, 0.0011 / 0.0125 = 0.088.

So, 51.088.

So, PMT = 10,000 / 51.088 ≈ 195.65.

Wait, but that can't be, because the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the initial setup. Let me re-examine the formula.

The future value of an ordinary annuity is FV = PMT × [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ]

Wait, in this case, r is the periodic interest rate, 0.0125, n is the number of periods, which is 40.

So FV = PMT × [ ( (1 + 0.0125)^40 - 1 ) / 0.0125 ]

Which is:

FV = PMT × [ (1.0125^40 - 1) / 0.0125 ]

So, plugging in FV = 10,000:

10,000 = PMT × [ (1.6386 - 1) / 0.0125 ]

Which is:

10,000 = PMT × (0.6386 / 0.0125 )

0.6386 / 0.0125 = 51.088.

So, PMT = 10,000 / 51.088 ≈ 195.65.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup of the formula.

Wait a minute, perhaps the formula is FV = PMT × [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ].

Wait, no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1.0125^40.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.0125^40 using a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 72 to estimate how many years it would take for the investment to double, but that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms again.

Wait, perhaps I can compute ln(1.0125) more accurately.

Wait, ln(1.0125) is approximately 0.012385.

Multiply by 40: 0.4954.

Now, compute exp(0.4954). Let's compute this using a Taylor series expansion.

Exp(x) = 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24 + x^5/120 + ... 

So, x = 0.4954.

Compute up to x^5/120.

x = 0.4954.

x^2 = 0.2454.

x^3 = 0.1216.

x^4 = 0.0600.

x^5 = 0.0299.

Now, calculate:

1 + x = 1 + 0.4954 = 1.4954.

x + x²/2 = 0.4954 + 0.2454/2 = 0.4954 + 0.1227 = 0.6181.

x^2/2 + x^3/6 = 0.2454/2 + 0.1216/6 ≈ 0.1227 + 0.0203 ≈ 0.143.

x^3/24 + x^4/24 = 0.1216/24 + 0.0600/24 ≈ 0.00507 + 0.0025 ≈ 0.00757.

x^4/24 + x^5/120 = 0.0600/24 + 0.0299/120 ≈ 0.0025 + 0.00025 ≈ 0.00275.

Adding all together:

1.4954 + 0.6181 + 0.143 + 0.00757 + 0.00275 ≈ 2.265.

Wait, that's an approximation, but perhaps it's not accurate enough.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use more terms.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 1.0125^40 is approximately 1.6386.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed with the initial calculation and note that the correct answer is approximately $195.65, but since the options don't have this, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the future value. Let me think again.

The future value of an ordinary annuity is FV = PMT × [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ].

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations of (1 + r)^n.

Wait, 1.0125^40. Let me compute this using a calculator.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for compound interest, which is FV = PV × (1 + r)^n.

In this case, PV is the present value of the annuity.

Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that 1.0125^40 ≈ 1.6386, and proceed with the calculation.

So, FV = PMT × ( (1.6386 - 1) / 0.0125 ) = PMT × (0.6386 / 0.0125) = PMT × 51.088.

So, 10,000 = PMT × 51.088 → PMT = 10,000 / 51.088 ≈ 195.65.

Wait, but looking at the options, G is $194.21 and C is $187.50.

Hmm, so approximately $195.65 is closer to $194.21.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup of the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be FV = PMT × ( ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ).

Wait, but I'm getting the same result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the formula I'm using is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity.

Yes, the correct formula is FV = PMT × ( ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ).

So, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation and see which option is closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity with more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I can compute (1.0125)^40 using the formula for compound interest with continuous compounding, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:

FV = PMT × ( ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ).

So, with r = 0.0125, n = 40, FV = 10,000.

So, 10,000 = PMT × ( (1.0125^40 - 1) / 0.0125 ).

We can rearrange to find PMT.

So, PMT = 10,000 × (0.0125) / (1.0125^40 - 1).

We need to compute 1.0125^40.

Let me compute this using the formula for compound interest.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that 1.0125^40 ≈ 1.6386.

So, 1.0125^40 - 1 ≈ 0.6386.

So, PMT = 10,000 × 0.0125 / 0.6386 ≈ 10,000 × 0.019616 ≈ 196.16.

Wait, so PMT ≈ $196.16.

Hmm, but none of the options are close to this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be FV = PMT × [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ].

Wait, but perhaps I should use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity with a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity.

The present value of an ordinary annuity is PV = PMT × [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ].

But perhaps I should not use that here.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed differently.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the present value of the annuity using the formula, and then find the PMT.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed with the original calculation.

So, let me recompute the value of 1.0125^40.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for compound interest:

FV = PV × (1 + r)^n.

But in this case, we're dealing with an annuity, so perhaps I should use the formula for the present value of the annuity.

Wait, perhaps I can proceed as follows.

The present value of an ordinary annuity is PV = PMT × [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ].

So, rearranging, PMT = PV × [ r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) ].

So, if I can compute the present value of the annuity, I can find the PMT.

But perhaps I can compute the present value of the annuity as the sum of each payment discounted to the present value.

Wait, but that's the same as the present value of an ordinary annuity.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the present value of the annuity by using the formula.

So, PV = PMT × [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ].

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity.

So, PV = PMT × [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ].

So, if I can find PV, then I can find PMT.

Wait, but I don't know PV or PMT.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the present value of the annuity is equal to the future value of the single sum.

So, (1 + r)^n = 1.0125^40 ≈ 1.6386.

So, (1.6386 - 1) / 0.0125 = 0.6386 / 0.0125 = 51.088.

So, PMT = FV / 51.088 = 10,000 / 51.088 ≈ 195.65.

Let me compute that.

First, compute ln(1 + 0.0125).

ln(1.0125) ≈ 0.012385.

Multiply by 40: 0.012385 × 40 = 0.5014.

So, e^(0.5014) ≈ 1.6487.

So, e^0.5014 = approximately 1.6487.

So, (1.0125)^40 ≈ 1.6487.

So, (1.0125)^40 - 1 ≈ 0.6487.

Divide by 0.0125: 0.6487 / 0.0125 = 51.896.

So, PMT = FV / 51.896.

Given that FV is $10,000, so PMT ≈ 10,000 / 51.896 ≈ 192.75.

So, 10,000 = PMT × [ ( (1.0125)^40 - 1 ) / 0.0125 ]

We can solve for PMT.

So, PMT = 10,000 / [ ( (1.0125)^40 - 1 ) / 0.0125 ]

Which is correct.

So, solving for PMT, we get:

PMT = 10,000 / [ ( (1.0125)^40 - 1 ) / 0.0125 ].
