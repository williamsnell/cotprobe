Question:

A defendant is on trial for attempting to cash a forged check at a bank. A teller at the bank is called to testify. The teller testified that she was on duty when the defendant came to her station and handed her a check drawn on the account of another customer. She recognized the forgery because she knew the other customer's signature since he was one of her regulars. The teller further testified that after becoming suspicious, she placed the check down on the counter and turned to talk to her supervisor. As she did so, the defendant picked up the check and left the bank before she could say anything. The check that the defendant presented at the bank was not recovered by law enforcement authorities and was not offered as evidence. The teller's testimony regarding the forged signature on the check is

Options:

A: admissible, because the witness has the ability to recognize forged signatures.
B: inadmissible, because the witness is at fault in allowing the loss of the original by failing to secure the check.
C: admissible, because it is rationally related to the witness's perception.
D: inadmissible, because it is not possible for the jury to compare the signature on the check since it was not presented as evidence.
E: admissible, because the witness knew the regular customer and could identify the forgery.
F: admissible, because the witness was familiar with the alleged victim's handwriting.
G: inadmissible, because the witness didn't directly see the defendant forging the signature.
H: inadmissible, because the witness did not see the defendant forge the signature.
I: inadmissible, because the defendant left the bank with the check before the witness could confront him.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question. Let me read it carefully.

So, the scenario is a defendant on trial for attempting to cash a forged check. The teller at the bank is called to testify. The teller says she was on duty, handed a check to another customer, recognized the forgery because he was a regular, and then put it down on the counter. Then the defendant comes to leave before she can say anything. The check wasn't recovered and isn't on the records. The question is about whether the teller's statement about the forged signature is admissible.

Looking at the options, I need to pick which one is correct regarding whether the testimony is admissible. The options are A to H, with E, F, G, H, I being possible answers.

First, I remember that in evidence law, a witness's testimony about something (like a signature) can be admissible if it's related to their perception or belief. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact rules here.

Wait, the issue here is whether the signature is considered evidence. The teller's testimony about the signature is about whether it's forged. If the bank had a policy about using forged signatures, perhaps that's already been established. Or maybe the fact that the defendant left before the teller could see it is a problem.

I think about the rule about whether a witness's perception can be admissible. I recall that signature evidence is admissible if the witness can show that they saw the signature. But another factor is the purpose of the testimony. If the witness is trying to prove that the signature is genuine, that's a different case.

Wait, the teller is trying to prove that the signature is forged. So if the bank's policy was that genuine signatures were not recognized because the original was stolen, then the teller might be using their perception to test the signature. 

But I'm not sure about the admissibility of the witness's own perception. There's a rule about whether the witness can be called in for something they believe they know, but maybe it's when they are trying to prove something they can't actually see.

Another angle: if the bank's policy was based on the original's authenticity, then the teller's statement about the signature being forged might be considered evidence. But if the bank had already established that genuine signatures were not present because the original was stolen, then the teller's ability to identify the signature might not be sufficient.

Wait, but in this case, the defendant left before the teller could see the signature. So the teller didn't have the opportunity to observe it. So that might be a problem. Because if the witness can't see the signature, they might not be able to testify about it.

So looking back at the options, option E says the testimony is admissible because the defendant left before the witness could confront him. Wait, that's about the timing, but the testimony is about the signature. So option E is about the timing, not the admissibility of the statement itself.

Option H says it's inadmissible because the witness didn't see the defendant forging the signature. But if the defendant left, perhaps the witness couldn't have seen the forgery, so the signature wasn't present. But wait, the teller presented a signature that she thought was forged, but the bank's records don't have it because the check was never recovered. So maybe the witness's testimony is about the signature, but the bank's policy might have been based on the original's authenticity.

Alternatively, maybe the witness's perception of the signature allows them to prove it's forged, because they saw it being presented as forged. But if they couldn't see it, maybe they can't.

Hmm. Another point: do the standards for signature evidence require the witness to have seen the signature? Or is it sufficient that they can perceive it as being a forgery?

Wait, I think that in some cases, the witness can testify about the signature if they can show that the signature is different from the bank's usual policies. Or, if the witness can demonstrate that they saw the signature, that would be more direct evidence.

But in this scenario, the defendant left before the teller could see the signature. That might mean that the teller didn't have the opportunity to test it. So perhaps the testimony is inadmissible because the witness couldn't see the signature.

Looking at the options again, option G says it's inadmissible because the witness didn't directly see the defendant forging the signature. Option H is the opposite. So if the witness didn't see the forgery, then maybe it's not admissible.

Wait, but the teller presented the signature she saw as forged. So the question is whether the witness can test it. If the witness saw the signature, then perhaps they can testify. But if they didn't see it, then they can't.

But the problem is, the defendant left before the teller could see it. So the teller didn't have the opportunity to see the forgery. So the witness (teller) couldn't have seen it. So, the testimony about the forged signature is inadmissible because the witness didn't see it. So option G would be correct.

Alternatively, if the bank's policy was based on the original being stolen, the fact that the signature was presented as forged might be sufficient to establish that it's a forgery, without the witness seeing it.

Wait, but the issue is that the witness's testimony is about the signature. If the witness can't see it, then perhaps they can't testify. Because the original signature wasn't there, but the teller's own perception of the signature being forged could be admissible if they can prove it's different from the original.

Wait, another angle: the problem is that the defendant left, so the teller couldn't see the signature. But the witness is the teller, so the witness can't testify unless they can see it, right?

So if the teller left before she could see the signature, then the testimony is not admissible because the witness couldn't see it. So the answer would be option G: inadmissible, because the witness didn't directly see the defendant forging the signature.

Alternatively, some cases might involve the witness's ability to see, but I'm not certain. I think that when a witness can't see the fact that was presented, they can't testify about it, unless they can demonstrate that the fact was shown in a way that's not part of the original evidence. But in this case, the bank didn't recover the signature, so the teller's own ability to recognize it as forged would be admissible, but only if they could see it.

Wait, but the judge and jury may not have seen it because the defendant left. So the witness (teller) can't test it, so the testimony is inadmissible because the witness couldn't see the original.

So the correct answer is G: inadmissible because the witness didn't directly see the defendant forging the signature.

The defendant left before the teller could see the forged signature, meaning the witness (teller) couldn't have observed it. Therefore, the testimony about the forged signature is inadmissible because the witness did not directly see the forgery.
