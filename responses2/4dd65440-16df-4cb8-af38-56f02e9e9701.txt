Okay, so I've got this logic question here, and I need to figure it out. The question is about the minor premise in syllogisms and determining which type of argument it's part of. The options are A through J, each a different type of argument.

First, I remember that syllogisms are a form of deductive reasoning, right? And in a syllogism, there's a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion. The minor premise is the part that actually addresses the specific case in the conclusion. 

The question says the minor premise must affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent. Wait, what's that about? Oh, right, that's referring to categorical syllogisms. In a categorical syllogism, the minor premise is a statement about the subject of the conclusion. It has to either affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent. 

Let me break this down. In logic, when you have a syllogism, you have two premises and a conclusion. The syllogism is valid if the premises necessarily lead to the conclusion. Categorical syllogisms are one type, and they follow a specific structure. Each premise and the conclusion is a categorical proposition.

The minor premise is the one that deals with the subject of the conclusion. For example, if the conclusion is "All S are P," the minor premise might be "All S are M," and the major premise might be "All M are P." So the minor premise is about the subject M and relates it to another category.

Now, for the minor premise in a categorical syllogism, it must either affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent. Let me think about what that means. The antecedent is the first part of the conclusion's premise, and the consequent is the second part. So, if the conclusion is "All S are P," the minor premise could be "All S are M" (affirming the antecedent) or "No S are M" (denying the consequent).

Wait, but in the context of syllogisms, does the minor premise have to be either an affirmative or negative premise? Because in categorical syllogisms, the premises can be either universal affirmative (All S are M), universal negative (No S are M), particular affirmative (Some S are M), or particular negative (Some S are not M). 

But the minor premise in a syllogism is a premise that introduces a new term. So, for example, in the major premise, you might have "All M are P," and the minor premise would be "Some S are M." So then, the minor premise is a particular affirmative. Or maybe the major premise is "No S are M," and the minor premise is "Some S are M," which would be a particular affirmative as well. 

Wait, but in some cases, if the major premise is negative, the minor premise can't be a particular affirmative. Because if the major premise is "No M are P," then the minor premise can't be a particular affirmative because that would contradict the major premise. So maybe the minor premise has to be either an affirmative that affirms the antecedent or a negative that denies the consequent. 

So this seems to align with the structure of a categorical syllogism. The mnemonic is "All-May-Be-All, All-May-Not-Be-All." Wait, no, I think the key is that the minor premise must be either the same term as the conclusion's subject (affirming) or the contrary (denying).

So, the question is about what type of argument the minor premise must affirm or deny. That points to a categorical syllogism. So the minor premise must be either an affirming or denying part. 

Looking at the options, option D is Categorical syllogism. So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: Categorical syllogism.

In a categorical syllogism, the minor premise must either affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent, which aligns with the structure of a syllogism. This ensures the validity of the argument through deductive reasoning.

Answer: D
