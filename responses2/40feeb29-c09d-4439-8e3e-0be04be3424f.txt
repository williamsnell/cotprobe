Okay, so I have this question about the Sales Article in the UCC, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about implied warranties under the UCC.

The question is about which situation best describes how the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose arises in a sale. The options are A through J, each describing different circumstances.

First, I remember that the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose typically arises when the buyer expects the seller to perform the implied duties. This is under the UCC § 2-303, which covers implied warranties under the Sales Article.

So, the key here is to identify which option fits the scenario where the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select suitable goods. Because the implied warranty requires the seller to fulfill their duties, the buyer's reliance on the seller's skills would lead to the implied warranty.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the buyer is purchasing for a particular purpose and is relying on the seller’s skill or judgment to select suitable goods. That sounds right because it's about the buyer's reliance, which is necessary for the implied warranty.

Option F says the seller knows the purpose and the buyer is relying on the seller's judgment. Wait, no, because F is about the seller knowing the purpose and the buyer relying on the seller's judgment. That's not exactly what the implied warranty arises from—the implied warranty arises from the buyer's reliance, not the seller's knowledge.

Option B: seller knows the purpose but buyer isn't relying. That doesn't fit because the implied warranty comes from reliance, not from the seller's knowledge.

Option C: buyer is purchasing for a purpose and relies on the seller's reputation. That's part of the implied warranty, but the question is about the specific circumstances where the implied warranty arises, not just the presence of a particular aspect.

Option D: buyer is purchasing for a purpose and the seller is a merchant. This relates to the seller being a merchant but doesn't address the reliance by the buyer.

Option G: seller knows the purpose and is a merchant. Same as D; not directly about reliance.

Option H: seller isn't aware of the purpose but is a merchant. Again, not about reliance.

Option I: buyer is general purpose, seller is a merchant. Not relevant to the particular purpose scenario.

Option J: buyer is for a particular purpose but seller isn't a merchant. That's about the type of goods but not reliance.

So, the correct scenario is when the buyer is specifically looking for a certain purpose and is relying on the seller's judgment or reputation to choose the right goods. That's exactly what option E describes.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing any other options. The implied warranty arises when the seller performs their duties, which includes fulfilling the implied duties. The duty here is to sell the goods for the specified purpose. The implied duty is that the goods will be used for the particular purpose intended by the buyer. 

So, the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose comes from the seller fulfilling their implied duty. The buyer's reliance on the seller to select suitable goods (option E) is what triggers this implied warranty. The seller's knowledge of the purpose (option G) is a separate factor, but the reliance is what leads to the implied warranty.

So, I think option E is the correct answer.

The correct answer is:

**E: The buyer is purchasing the goods for a particular purpose and the seller is a merchant in such goods.**

This option describes the scenario where the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose arises due to the buyer relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select suitable goods.
