Okay, so I have this question about blackjack and the values of certain cards. Let me think through this. I'm a bit new to blackjack, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

The question is asking, in the card game blackjack, how much is a queen and a king worth together. The options are A to J, with various numbers ranging from 11 to 22.

First, I remember that in blackjack, each card has a specific point value. The deck consists of 52 cards, with each rank having a certain point. I think the standard point values are as follows: A is 11, J is 11, Q is 12, K is 13, and the others are as usual, with 2 being 2, 3 being 3, etc. So, each of these Q and K is 12 and 13, respectively.

Wait, so if I have a queen and a king, that would be 12 + 13. Let me add them up: 12 plus 13 equals 25. Hmm, looking at the options, I see that option C is 25. So, that would be the right answer.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing up any other cards. Did I remember the point values correctly? Let me double-check. Yes, A is 1, 2 is 2, 3 is 3, up to K which is 13. So, Q is 12, K is 13. Adding them gives 25.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the hand value? Like, when you have a queen and a king, does that make a hand worth something like 25? I think that's right because in a standard game, a hand is calculated by adding the values of the cards, including the number value and counting Aces as 1 or 11. But the question is specifically about the total of the queen and king together, not the entire hand. So, 25 is correct.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in blackjack, especially with Aces, people can have different strategies. But since the question is about the combined worth, I think the point value is what matters. So, 12 +13 is 25.

So the answer should be option C:25.

The correct answer is C:25. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- In blackjack, each card has a specific point value. A queen (Q) is worth 12 points, and a king (K) is worth 13 points.
- Adding these together: 12 (queen) + 13 (king) = 25 points.
- Therefore, the combined worth of a queen and a king is 25.

ANSWER: C
