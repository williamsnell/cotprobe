Okay, so I have to calculate the mass of the electron using the data from Millikan's determination of the charge (q) and J.J. Thomson's measurement of q/m. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

Wait, right, the mass of the electron is usually given by its charge divided by its charge-to-mass ratio. Oh yeah, because m = q/(e), where e is the elementary charge. But wait, how do I get the electron's mass from q and q/m?

Millikan's experiment involved measuring the charge of the electron, right. He found the charge by seeing how many times a drop was repelled by electric fields. So his value for e should be accurate.

Then, J.J. Thomson measured the electron's mass by using the ratio q/m. So the formula would be m = e/(q/m). But wait, that's the same as e multiplied by the inverse of (q/m). So m = e * (m/q), but since e is known, and m is the mass we're trying to find, we can plug in the values.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The charge-to-mass ratio (e/m) is known from Thomson's experiment, and the charge (e) is known from Millikan's. So m = e/(e/m) → m = e * (m/(e)) → wait, no. Wait, m = e/( (e/m) )? No, that can't be right. Wait, no: m = e/( (q/m) ), because the ratio is q/m. So m = e * (m/q). Oh, that makes sense because e = q*(e/m). So m = e * (m/q). So yes, m = e * (m/q) → m = e * (m/q) → rearranging, m = e * (m/q) → m = (e * m) / q. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's think again. The charge-to-mass ratio (e/m) is known from Thomson's experiment. If I have the charge (e) from Millikan, then m = e/(e/m) → m = e * (m/e) → m = m. Wait, that doesn't help. Oh wait, no—because e is known, and m is the unknown. So, from e/m, I have e = (e/m) * m. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula m = e/( (e/m) ). Oh, no, wait, that would be m = e * (m/e) ), which is m = m. That's trivial. I must be getting this wrong. Oh, wait, perhaps the correct way is m = (e) / (e/m)? No, that would be m = (e * m)/e, which again gives m = m. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the units here.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as m = e * (1/(e/m)), which would be m = e * (m/e) → m = m. Hmm, that's not helpful. I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, another approach: Coulomb's law. The electron's mass can be found by knowing the force of gravity and the electric force. So F_gravity = m * g, where g is acceleration due to gravity. The electric force is F_electric = q * E, where E is the electric field. But I'm not sure how that helps me directly. Alternatively, the electric field can be related to the charge and the mass.

Wait, perhaps the better way is to find the mass using the known values of e and the ratio m/e.

Wait, I think I remember that the mass of the electron is about 9.11 × 10^-31 kg. But wait, let me think about the steps.

So, electron charge (e) is known from Millikan's experiment. Let's say he measured it as 1.6 × 10^-19 C (that's about right). Then, the ratio e/m is known from Thomson's experiment. Suppose the ratio was, say, 1.76 × 10^11 C/kg (I think that's the value I remember for e/m). Oh wait, no—wait, e/m is about 1.76 × 10^11 C/kg, or maybe 1.6 × 10^11. But I'm getting this from memory.

Wait, let me get the exact values. Let me look up the numbers in my mind. I think the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron is about 1.76 × 10^11 C/kg. Let me confirm this. Oh, I think it's around 1.76 × 10^11 C/kg. So e/m = 1.76e11 C/kg.

So, if e is 1.6e-19 C (as per Millikan's data), then m = e / (e/m) → m = (1.6e-19 C) / (1.76e11 C/kg) → Let's compute that.

So 1.6e-19 / 1.76e11 → Let's compute the exponents first: 1e-19 / 1e11 = 1e-30. So 1.6 / 1.76 = approx 0.909 (since 1.76 * 0.909 ≈ 1.6). So 0.909e-30 kg → which is 9.09e-31 kg. That's approximately 9.1e-31 kg. Looking at the options, option I is 9.1 ×10^-31 kg, option H is 9.1e-31, and option I is 9.1e-31.

Wait but let's recheck the options. The options are:

A: 6.7e-17, B:2.2e-22, C:3e-32, D:5.5e-31, E:1.76e11, F:1e-31, G:1e-30, H:9.1e-28, I:9.1e-31, J:1e-31.

Wait, so option I is 9.1e-31 kg, which is what I calculated. So the correct answer would be option I.

Wait, but I should double-check the calculation. Let's compute 1.6e-19 / 1.76e11.

1.6e-19 / 1.76e11 = (1.6 / 1.76) * (1e-19 / 1e11) ) → 1.6/1.76 equals approximately 0.909. And 1e-19 / 1e11 is 1e-30. So 0.909e-30 kg.

0.909e-30 is 9.09e-31 kg, which is approximately 9.1e-31 kg. So that's option I.

But wait, let me make sure about the units. 1.6e-19 coulombs is the charge of the electron. e/m is 1.76e11 C/kg. So m = e/(e/m) → e cancels out, leaving (1.6e-19) / 1.76e11 = 9.09e-31 kg. So the correct answer is option I.

To calculate the mass of the electron using the results from Millikan's determination of the electron charge \( q \) and J.J. Thomson's measurement of \( q/m \), we use the formula:

\[
m = \frac{e}{(e/m)}
\]

Here:
- \( e \) is the elementary charge, which is approximately \( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \).
- \( e/m \) is the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron, which is approximately \( 1.76 \times 10^{11} \, \text{C/kg} \).

Substituting these values:

\[
m = \frac{1.6 \times 10^{-19}}{1.76 \times 10^{11}}
\]

First, calculate the exponent part:

\[
\frac{10^{-19}}{10^{11}} = 10^{-30}
\]

Next, calculate the numerical coefficient:

\[
\frac{1.6}{1.76} \approx 0.909
\]

Thus:

\[
m \approx 0.909 \times 10^{-30} = 9.09 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}
\]

This value is approximately \( 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \), which corresponds to option **I**.
