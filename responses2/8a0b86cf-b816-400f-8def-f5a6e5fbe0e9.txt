Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the Earth's rotation and when an object at the equator becomes weightless. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see...

Okay, the question is asking what the period of rotation would be if the Earth's rotation speed increased until an object at the equator becomes weightless. Hmm. I remember that weightless means the object isn't experiencing gravity anymore, right? So, it's in free fall.

Wait, when is an object at rest on a rotating object feel weightless? Oh right, when the centrifugal force equals the gravitational force. Wait, no, because the gravitational force is what keeps us on the surface. So, perhaps the point where the centrifugal acceleration equals the gravitational acceleration.

I think the formula for the condition when an object at the equator is weightless is when the centripetal acceleration equals the gravitational acceleration. But wait, is it centripetal or centrifugal? Oh, wait, in this case, the Earth is rotating, so the centrifugal force is what causes the apparent weight to change. So, when the centrifugal force equals the gravitational force, the object feels weightless.

Wait, but the formula for that is probably v^2 / r equals g. Because the gravitational acceleration is g (at the surface of the Earth), and the centripetal acceleration is v²/r, but wait, that's for circular motion. Wait, but the Earth's rotation is causing a centripetal acceleration, and the gravitational acceleration is acting downward. So when the object is at the equator, the effective gravity is the net of these two.

Wait, but when the object is weightless, the net force is zero. So the gravitational force (which is mg) equals the centripetal force (which is mω²r), right? Because the net force is zero, so F_gravity = F_centrifugal.

So, mg = mω² r. The mass m cancels out, so g = ω² r. So solving for ω, we get ω = sqrt(g / r). Okay, that makes sense. But wait, I've heard that the period T is related to ω by T = 2π / ω. So substituting, T = 2π / sqrt(g/r) ) = 2π sqrt(r/g). 

Alternatively, sometimes I've seen the formula written as T = 2π sqrt(r/g). Right, because substituting ω = sqrt(g/r), so ω squared is g/r. So T is the time for one full rotation, so 2π divided by ω. So that's correct.

So I need to calculate the period based on that. I think the radius of the Earth is about 6,371 kilometers, or 6.371e6 meters. The gravitational acceleration g is approximately 9.8 m/s².

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. So, r is 6.371e6 m, g is 9.8 m/s².

Compute sqrt(r/g): sqrt(6.371e6 / 9.8). Let's compute 6.371e6 divided by 9.8 first.

6.371e6 / 9.8 = approx 650,102.04 (because 6.371e6 /10 =637,100; divided by 9.8, which is a little less than 10, so about 650,102).

So sqrt(650,102) is approximately 806.3 seconds because 800^2 is 640,000, so 806^2 is 649,636, which is a bit more than 650,102. So 806.3 s? Wait, wait, wait. Hmm, wait, 806.3 seconds is about 13.44 minutes. But wait, the period should be in hours, isn't it? Because the options are in hours.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Let me compute r/g correctly.

r = 6,371 km = 6,371,000 m.
g = 9.8 m/s².

So r/g = 6,371,000 / 9.8.

Let me compute that. 6,371,000 divided by 9.8.

I can think of 6,371,000 ÷ 9.8 as 6,371,000 ÷ (10 - 0.2) = but perhaps it's easier to compute directly.

Alternatively, 6,371,000 ÷ 9.8 = ?

Let me compute 9.8 * 649,000 = 9.8 * 600,000 = 588,000, 9.8*49,000 = 480,200 → 588,000+480,200= 1,068,200. Wait, but 9.8 * 649,000 = 6,360,200. Because 649,000 * 10 is 6,490,000; subtract 649,000 * 0.2 (129,800) → 6,490,000 - 129,800 = 6,360,200.

But our target is 6,371,000.

So 6,371,000 - 6,360,200 = 10,800.

So 10,800 / 9.8 = approximately 1,102.04. So the total is 649,000 + 1,102 = 650,102.

So r/g is 650,102.

So sqrt(650,102) is approximately 806.3 seconds. But wait, 806.3 seconds is about 13.44 minutes. Wait, but the question is asking for the period in hours, so wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in units. Oh wait, wait: 806 seconds is about 13.44 minutes. So convert that to hours: 13.44 / 60 ≈ 0.224 hours.

Wait, but none of the options are around 0.224. The options are A to J.

Wait, the options are in hours, and the first option is A:3.5hr, which is much bigger. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula is T = 2π sqrt(r/g), which gives the period in the same units as r and g. Wait, but r is in meters, g in m/s². So 2π is in radians, the sqrt is in seconds. So T comes out in seconds, then we can convert to hours.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

The formula for when the gravitational acceleration equals the centripetal acceleration.

Wait, the gravitational acceleration is g = ω² r, so solving for ω gives ω = sqrt(g / r).

The period T is 2π / ω. So substituting, T = 2π / sqrt(g/r) = 2π sqrt(r/g).

So that's correct. So T = 2π * sqrt(r/g). So yes, that's what we have.

So let's compute that. r is 6,371,000 m, g is 9.8 m/s².

So, r/g = 6,371,000 / 9.8 ≈ 650,102.04.

sqrt(650,102.04) ≈ 806.33 s.

Then, T = 2 * π * 806.33 → 2 * 3.1416 * 806.33 ≈ 6.2832 * 806.33.

Let me compute that: 6 * 806.33 is 4838, 0.2832 * 806.33 ≈ 228.7. So total is about 4838 + 228.7 ≈ 5066.7 seconds.

Wait, that's way bigger than any of the options. The options go down to 0.5 hr (30 mins) and up to 5.64 hr (338 minutes).

Hmm, clearly I must have made a mistake. Because this calculation gives a period of about 5066 seconds, which is 84.44 minutes, which is about 1.407 hours. Wait, that's about 1.41 hours, which is option E.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, 6,371 km is 6,371,000 meters. Divided by 9.8 m/s² is 6,371,000 / 9.8 ≈ 650,102.04. The square root of that is about 806.33 seconds. So 2π multiplied by that is 2 * 3.1416 * 806.33 ≈ 5066 seconds.

Wait, 5066 seconds is how many hours? 5066 divided by 3600 (seconds per hour) is approximately 1.407 hours. So about 1.41 hours, which is option E.

But wait, the options include option E as 1.41 hr, so that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

In the case of the Earth's rotation, the condition for an object at the equator to be weightless is when the rotational acceleration equals the gravitational acceleration. The rotational acceleration is ω² r. So,

ω² r = g → ω = sqrt(g / r).

The period T is 2π / ω → T = 2π sqrt(r/g).

Wait, I did that correctly earlier. So why am I getting a period of about 1.4 hours?

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that g is 9.8 m/s², but maybe it's considering the radius as Earth's radius in kilometers? Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think.

Wait, the radius of Earth is about 6,371 km, which is 6,371,000 meters. If I used r = 6,371 km, which is 6,371 * 1000 = 6,371,000 m, then that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I'm supposed to use the Earth's radius in kilometers, but in the formula, we don't need to convert because the units are compatible.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is T = 2π sqrt(r/(g)), but using r in kilometers and g in km/s²? Wait, no, because g is in m/s². Let me check the units.

Wait, 1 km is 1000 meters. So if I use r in km, then g is 9.8 m/s² = 0.0098 km/s². Then, r in km and g in km/s².

So r in km is 6371 km. So r/g would be 6371 / 0.0098 ≈ 650,102.04.

Wait, which is the same as before. So same result.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the square root. Let me compute sqrt(650102) more accurately.

What's 806 squared? 800^2 is 640,000. 806^2 is (800 +6)^2 = 800² + 2*800*6 +6²= 640,000 + 9600 +36= 649,936.

Which is 649,936. But our r/g is 650,102. So 806^2 is 649,936, and 806.3^2 is (806 + 0.3)^2 = 806^2 + 2*806*0.3 +0.3^2 =649,936 + 483.6 + 0.09 = 650,419.69. Oh, but we have 650,102 which is between 806^2 and 806.3^2.

Wait, wait a second. 806^2 is 649,936. So 650,102 is 649,936 + 166.

So 806.3^2 = 650,419.69. Which is larger than 650,102, so the square root must be between 806 and 806.3.

Wait, but the actual value is 806.33 as I had before. So that's about right.

So, sqrt(650,102) is about 806.33 s.

So T = 2π * 806.33 → 2 * 3.1416 * 806.33 ≈ 6.2832 * 806.33 ≈ let's compute 6 * 806.33 = 4837.98, 0.2832 * 806.33 ≈ 228.7, total is 4837.98 + 228.7 = 5066.68 seconds.

5066.68 seconds equals how many hours? 5066.68 / 3600 ≈ 1.407 hours. So about 1.41 hours, which is option E.

Wait, but the options include E as 1.41 hr. So that's the answer. But wait, the options also include option J:5.64 hr. Hmm, which is about 1.407 * 4. That's a big difference. So why would there be a discrepancy? Oh, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach. Wait, the gravitational acceleration at the equator would have to provide the centripetal acceleration. So,

g = ω² r → ω² = g / r.

So ω is sqrt(g / r).

The period T is the time for one rotation. So T = 2π / ω = 2π / sqrt(g/r) → T = 2 π sqrt(r/g). Which is what I had.

So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for g. Because the Earth's radius is r=6371 km = 6.371e6 m. g is 9.8 m/s². So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps an alternative way to compute T: T = 2π sqrt(r/g) → let's compute that.

So sqrt(6.371e6 m /9.8 m/s²) → sqrt(6.501e5 s²) → about 806.33 seconds.

So 2π * 806.33 = about 5066 seconds → 1.407 hr.

So that's 1 hour and 24.42 minutes. So 1.407 hours.

But looking at the options, the closest one is option E: 1.41 hr.

Wait, but wait, another thought: sometimes, in such problems, the formula is presented as T² = (4π² r)/g → which would make T= sqrt(4π² r/g). Wait, no, because T= 2π sqrt(r/g), so T² is 4 π² (r/g). So T² = (4 π² r)/g → so T= sqrt(4 π² r/g) → which is the same as 2π sqrt(r/g). So no mistake in that part.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I got the formula for the period wrong. Because sometimes, the formula for the period of rotation is T=2π sqrt(r/g), but perhaps I'm supposed to use the period of rotation of Earth, which is about 24 hours. But no, that's about 24 hr.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Wait, another approach: using angular velocity, ω = 2π / T. So,

g = ω² r → ω = sqrt(g/r) → T = 2π / sqrt(g/r).

Which is the same as before.

Wait, but let me think about the formula again. So, the condition for weightlessness is when the centripetal acceleration equals the gravitational acceleration. So, the centripetal acceleration is v² / r, but v is the tangential speed. Alternatively, v = r ω. So, centripetal acceleration is (r ω)^2 / r = r ω². So, equate that to g → r ω² = g → ω² = g / r → ω = sqrt(g/r). So, the period T is 2π / sqrt(g/r) = 2π sqrt(r/g). So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a period of about 1.4 hours, but looking at the options, option E is 1.41 hr. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a moment. I'm recalling that the period of rotation for the Earth is about 24 hours. So, if I were to rotate the Earth at 1.4 hours, that's much faster than the Earth's rotation. But the problem states that the rotation speed increases until the object becomes weightless. Wait, but if the Earth is already rotating, then the rotation speed is already higher. So, the initial rotation speed of the Earth is 24 hr. So, the problem is asking us to find a rotation speed that is higher than 24 hr, making objects feel weightless. Wait, no, that's not right. Because if the Earth is rotating faster, the effective gravity would be lower. Wait, actually, if the Earth is rotating faster, objects would feel less gravity, which would cause them to weigh less. But in this scenario, we're supposed to find when the effective gravity equals the actual gravity, so when objects are weightless.

Wait, but if the Earth is rotating faster, say, 24 hr, then the effective gravity would be lower than it is now. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this backwards.

Wait, no, wait. The effective gravity at the equator is g' = ω² r. So, if ω increases, g' increases. So, when g' is equal to g, as in our problem, that happens when ω is such that ω² r = g → ω = sqrt(g / r) → which is what we found.

So, with that, our calculation of T = 2π sqrt(r/g) gives us about 1.41 hours. Which is option E.

Wait, but looking back, another thought: perhaps the problem is not about the Earth's rotation but about the rotation of the object. Wait, no, the problem says the Earth is rotating, and we're to find when the rotation speed causes an object at the equator to be weightless.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a period of about 1.4 hours, which is option E. But another thought: perhaps the formula should be T² = (4π² r)/g → which would give T = 2π sqrt(r/g). So same result.

Wait, but wait, if the Earth is rotating once a day, 24 hr, then its angular velocity is ω_earth = 2π / T_earth → ω_earth = 2π / 86400 ≈ 7.27e-4 rad/s.

But in our problem, we're looking for a rotation speed (ω) such that g' = ω² r = g → so ω = sqrt(g / r).

Compute that:

g=9.8 m/s², r=6.371e6 m.

g/r = 9.8 / 6,371,000 ≈ 1.53e-6.

sqrt(1.53e-6) ≈ 1.24e-3 rad/s.

The Earth's angular velocity is about 7.27e-4 rad/s → which is about 0.1 times that. So, to get an object at the equator to be weightless, we need a rotation speed that's much higher than the Earth's current rotation speed. Which would be a rotation period of about 1.4 hours.

Wait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because if you rotate the Earth faster, you would make it feel lighter, but in reality, objects on the Earth's equator would be weightless not because of the rotation, but because the Earth's rotation creates centrifugal force. Wait, no. Wait, wait.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing centrifugal and gravitational forces. Let me think again.

The centrifugal acceleration at the equator is ω² r. So, if this acceleration equals the gravitational acceleration, the object feels weightless. So, for that to happen, the Earth must rotate at a speed where ω² r = g.

So, ω = sqrt(g/r) → which is about 0.00124 radians per second.

Now, the Earth's angular velocity is about 7.27e-4 rad/s, which is about 0.1 times that. So, if I rotate the Earth faster, ω would be higher, until it reaches this value.

Wait, but that's not possible because the Earth's rotation period is about 24 hr. So, if I rotate the Earth faster, the rotation period would decrease, right? So, if the Earth's rotation speed increases, its rotation period decreases.

Wait, but in our case, we're looking for the rotation period to reach a certain value. Oh, wait, that can't be, because the Earth's rotation period is fixed. So, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, I think the confusion comes from the fact that the Earth's rotation is part of the tidal forces that cause the ocean tides. But in this problem, we're only considering the rotation of the Earth, not the effects of the tides.

So, perhaps the answer is E:1.41 hr.

But looking at the options, option E is 1.41 hr, which is the calculated result. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the formula is T = 2π sqrt(r/g) but using g in different units. Let me try to compute it again, this time in seconds.

r = 6371 km = 6371 * 1000 = 6,371,000 meters.

g = 9.8 m/s².

So, r/g = 6371000 / 9.8 → 650,102.04.

sqrt(r/g) = sqrt(650102) ≈ 806.33 seconds.

T = 2 * π * 806.33 → 2 * 3.1416 * 806.33 → 6.2832 * 806.33 → let me compute that.

806.33 * 6 = 4838.

806.33 * 0.2832 → let's compute 806.33 * 0.2 = 161.266, 806.33 * 0.08 = 64.5064, 806.33 * 0.0032 = 2.580256.

Adding those up: 161.266 + 64.5064 = 225.7724 + 2.580256 = 228.3526.

So total is 4838 + 228.3526 = 5066.3526 seconds.

5066.3526 / 3600 = 1.407 hr → 1.41 hr.

So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought that the rotation period of the Earth is about 24 hours. But that's the rotation period, which is when the Earth spins once per day. But if we rotate the Earth faster, its rotation period would be shorter.

Wait, but in our problem, we are not considering the Earth's rotation period. We are considering when the Earth is rotating at a speed that causes objects at the equator to be weightless. So, in that scenario, the rotation speed increases, and the rotation period decreases, until the rotation period is such that the centrifugal acceleration equals the gravitational acceleration at the equator.

So, that's correct. So, the correct answer is E:1.41 hr.

But another thing: I think the problem is expecting us to use a different approach. Because in the problem, perhaps the period is being calculated using the formula T = 2π sqrt(r/(g)), but using r in kilometers.

Wait, let me try that again.

r = 6371 km → 6,371,000 meters.

But if I take r in kilometers, so 6371 km.

g = 9.8 m/s² = 0.0098 km/s².

So, r/g = 6371 / 0.0098 → 6371 / 0.0098 → 650,102.04.

Wait, same as before.

So, sqrt(r/g) = same 806.33.

So, T = 2π * 806.33 → same as before.

So, same result.

So, regardless of whether I take r in meters or kilometers, as long as I adjust g accordingly, the result remains the same.

Hmm, so I think the correct answer is E:1.41 hr.
</think>

To determine the period of rotation required for an object at Earth's equator to become weightless, we use the condition where the centrifugal acceleration equals the gravitational acceleration. The formula for the period is:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r}{g}}
\]

Where:
- \( r = 6,371 \, \text{km} = 6,371,000 \, \text{m} \) (Earth's radius),
- \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

1. **Calculate \( r/g \):**
   \[
   \frac{r}{g} = \frac{6,371,000}{9.8} \approx 650,102.04
   \]

2. **Find the square root of \( r/g \):**
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{r}{g}} = \sqrt{650,102.04} \approx 806.33 \, \text{seconds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the period \( T \):**
   \[
   T = 2\pi \times 806.33 \approx 2 \times 3.1416 \times 806.33 \approx 5066.68 \, \text{seconds}
   \]

4. **Convert seconds to hours:**
   \[
   T = \frac{5066.68}{3600} \approx 1.41 \, \text{hours}
   \]

Thus, the period of rotation required for an object at Earth's equator to become weightless is approximately **1.41 hours**.

ANSWER: E
