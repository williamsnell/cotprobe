We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me. It's about an article that talks about the importance of preserving peace and how various groups are contributing to it. The question is asking which development this passage is most associated with. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the passage again. It's about why peace is importantâ€”preserving it means independence, which in turn means the revolutions won't happen. The author mentions that without peace, world affairs don't have much meaning. They talk about injecting reason into world affairs, using the voices of Asia and Africa, and mobilizing their strengths for peace.

The options given are A through J, each corresponding to different events or concepts. Let's go through each one to see which one aligns with the passage.

Option A: Global disaremanation and nuclear non-proliferation. Hmm, not sure. The passage doesn't mention anything about disarmanation or nuclear weapons. It's more about the importance of peace and the role of Asian and African leaders.

Option B: Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology. Oh, that's a strong possibility. The passage talks about bringing the voices of Asia and Africa into world affairs, which makes me think it's about using shared ideas or ideologies to promote peace. So this seems relevant.

Option C: European Union formation. The passage doesn't mention anything about joining European nations, which is a key part of the EU. So probably not C.

Option D: Green Revolution in agriculture. That's a historical agricultural advancement, not related to peace or peace-related issues. So D is probably not the answer.

Option E: Rise of communism in Asia. The passage says "the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong," which sounds like a strong group, but communism isn't mentioned. It's more about population growth than a political movement.

Option F: Formation of the non-aligned movement. The term "non-aligned" might imply a movement against certain political groups, but the passage doesn't talk about that. It's more about promoting peace and bringing Asian leaders to the table.

Option G: Development of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. That's an economic development project, not related to peace. So G is probably not it.

Option H: United Nations establishment. No mention of any UN activities in the passage. It's a different organization altogether.

Option I: End of colonialism in Africa. The passage doesn't discuss colonialism, so I'm not sure. It's possible, but I don't think it's the main connection.

Option J: Start of Cold War. The Cold War is about geopolitical conflicts, which is not discussed here. The passage is about preserving peace, not about world wars.

Putting it all together, the best fit seems to be option B. The passage emphasizes the importance of bringing the voices of Asian and African leaders to the table, which is about mobilizing their collective strength and ideas, especially for peace. So the answer should be B.

The passage emphasizes the importance of bringing the voices of Asian and African leaders to the table, promoting peace and preventing revolutions. This aligns with the concept of mobilizing pan-Asian ideology, which is best described as option B.

Answer: B
