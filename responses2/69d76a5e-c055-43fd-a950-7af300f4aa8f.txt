Okay, so I've got this question about Gabriella the Human Cannonball from a circus show. She did four shows and measured different distances each time. I need to find the total distance she flew that day. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me list the distances she flew in each of the four shows. The problem states the distances as 7.04 meters, 18.81 meters, 18.39 meters, and 19.94 meters. So I have four numbers to add together.

Hmm, I should add them one by one. Maybe I'll start by adding the first two. So, 7.04 plus 18.81. Let me do that:

7.04
+18.81
= ?

Adding the decimals: 0.04 + 0.81 is 0.85. Then the whole numbers: 7 +18 is 25. So 25.85 meters so far.

Next, add the third distance, which is 18.39. So 25.85 + 18.39. Let me break that down. 25 + 18 is 43. 0.85 + 0.39 is 1.24. So adding them together, 43 + 1.24 equals 44.24. Wait, no, wait. 25.85 + 18.39 should be 44.24? Let me check: 25 + 18 is 43, 0.85 + 0.39 is 1.24, so total is 43 +1.24=44.24. Right.

Now, adding the last distance, 19.94. So 44.24 + 19.94.

Adding the whole numbers: 44 +19=63. Adding the decimals: 0.24 +0.94=1.18. So 63 +1.18=64.18 meters.

Wait, but let me make sure I added correctly. Alternatively, maybe I should add them all in a different order to double-check. Like, add the first and third, then add the second and fourth.

Wait, maybe I should add them all at once for accuracy. Let me try that:

7.04
+18.81
+18.39
+19.94
= ?

Let me add them all step by step. Let's start with 7.04 and 18.81. That's 25.85, as before. Then add 18.39: 25.85 +18.39.

Adding 25.85 and 18.39:

25.85
+18.39
= ?

25 +18 =43, 0.85 +0.39=1.24 → 43+1.24=44.24.

Now add 19.94 to 44.24:

44.24 +19.94.

Again, 44.24 +19.94 = ?

44 +19 =63, 0.24 +0.94 =1.18 → 63 +1.18=64.18 meters total. So the total is 64.18 meters.

Looking at the options, option G is 72.18. Wait, no. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in my addition. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, maybe I added in the wrong order. Let me add them all together in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should do it in parts. Let's add 7.04 and 18.81 again.

7.04
+18.81
= ?

Adding the units: 7+18=25, 0.04 +0.81=0.85 → 25.85.

Then add 18.39:

25.85 + 18.39 = ?

25 +18=43, 0.85 +0.39=1.24 → 44.24.

Then add 19.94:

44.24 +19.94 = ?

44 +19 =63, 0.24 +0.94=1.18 →63+1.18=64.18. So that's 64.18 meters.

Looking at the options, option G is 72.18, which is not matching. Wait, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement. Oh wait, the options are labeled A to J. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: 60.18 m
B: 70.18 m
C: 62.18 m
D: 57.14 m
E: 74.18 m
F: 66.18 m
G: 72.18 m
H: 64.18 m
I: 59.24 m
J: 68.18 m

Wait, according to my calculation, the total is 64.18, which is option H. So the correct answer should be option H, 64.18 meters.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the options may not have that. Let me double-check: 7.04 +18.81 +18.39 +19.94.

Alternatively, perhaps I should do the addition in a different way. Let me add the first and last, then the middle two.

7.04 +19.94 = let's calculate that:

7.04 +19.94 = (7+19) + (0.04 +0.94) → 26 +1.0 =27.0.

Then 18.81 +18.39 = (18+18) + (0.81+0.39) →36 +1.2=37.2.

Now add 27.0 +37.2 =64.2. Wait, but the exact sum should be 64.18. Hmm, why the discrepancy? Oh wait, because I added 7.04 +19.94 as 27.0, but perhaps more accurately:

7.04 +19.94 = (7.04)+(20-0.06) =20-0.06 +7.04=20 +7.04 =27.04 -0.06=26.98.

Wait, maybe I should do the calculations more precisely.

Let me line them up:

7.04
18.81
18.39
19.94

Adding vertically:

Starting from the right:

4 +1 +9 +4 =18. So write 8, carryover 1.

Next column: 0 +8 +3 +9 =20. Add 1 →21. Write 1, carryover 2.

Next column:7 +8 +8 +9 =32. Add 2 →34. Write 4, carryover 3.

Next column:0 +0 +0 +0 =0, plus 3 →3.

So the sum is 3 (from the thousands place?) Wait, no, let me think again. Wait, I think I got confused with the decimal placement.

Wait, let me add each column step by step.

Ones place: 4 (from 7.04) +1 (18.81) +9 (18.39) +4 (19.94) =18. So write 8, carryover 1.

Tenths place: 0 +8 +3 +9 =20. Plus carryover 1 →21. Write 1, carryover 2.

Hundredths place:7 (from 7.04) +8 (18.81) +8 (18.39) +9 (19.94) = 32. Plus carryover 2 →34. Write 4, carryover 3.

Thousands place: 0 (from 7.04) +0 (18.81) +0 (18.39) +0 (19.94) =0, plus carryover 3 →3.

Wait, but that can't be right. So the sum is 34.18? That can't be. Wait, I think I messed up the alignment.

Wait, perhaps I should write the numbers as:

7.04
18.81
18.39
19.94
Adding each column:

Starting from the rightmost (hundredths place):

4 (from 7.04) +1 (18.81) +9 (18.39) +4 (19.94) = 4+1=5; 5+9=14; 14+4=18. So write 8, carryover 1.

Next column (tenths place):

0 (7.04) +8 (18.81) +3 (18.39) +9 (19.94) =0+8=8; 8+3=11; 11+9=20. Plus carryover 1 →21. Write 1, carryover 2.

Next column (ones place):

7 (7.04) +8 (18.81) +8 (18.39) +9 (19.94) =7+8=15; 15+8=23; 23+9=32. Plus carryover 2 →34. Write 4, carryover 3.

Next column (tens place):

0 (7.04) +0 (18.81) +0 (18.39) +0 (19.94) =0 plus carryover 3 →3.

So the sum is 34.18 meters. Wait, but that can't be right because each individual distance is much larger. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the placement.

Wait, no, I think I added all the numbers correctly, but let's check the sum step by step again. Let me recalculate.

Adding 7.04 +18.81 =25.85.

25.85 +18.39 =44.24.

44.24 +19.94 =64.18.

Ah, I see. Because when I add 7.04 and 18.81, I get 25.85, then adding 18.39 gives 44.24, then 19.94 brings it to 64.18. So the correct total is 64.18 meters.

Looking back at the options, option H is 64.18. So the correct answer should be H.
</think>

The total distance Gabriella flew that day is calculated by summing the distances of her four shows: 7.04 m, 18.81 m, 18.39 m, and 19.94 m. 

Adding these together:

- 7.04 + 18.81 = 25.85  
- 25.85 + 18.39 = 44.24  
- 44.24 + 19.94 = 64.18  

Thus, the total distance is **64.18 meters**. 

Looking at the options, the correct answer is **H: 64.18 m**.

Answer: H
