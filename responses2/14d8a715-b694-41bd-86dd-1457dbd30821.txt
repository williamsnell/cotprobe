Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

The problem says that a proton is accelerated from rest through a potential difference V. After that, it moves into a region where there's a uniform electric field E in the +x direction and a magnetic field B in the +y direction. But the proton's trajectory isn't affected. Then, the question is, if the potential difference is doubled (so 2V), what happens?

Hmm. I remember that when a charge moves through an electric field, it experiences a force in the direction of the field. And if it moves through a magnetic field, the force is perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field. Oh wait, and the direction of the magnetic force is given by the right-hand rule.

So, first, I need to find out the initial velocity of the proton after being accelerated through V. Then, when the electric and magnetic fields are applied, how do they affect the proton's motion?

Wait, the problem says the trajectory isn't affected. That must mean that the net force on the proton is zero. So the electric force and the magnetic force balance each other out. So, F_electric equals F_magnetic in magnitude.

Let me think about the initial setup. The proton is accelerated through a potential V. The electric force is F_e = qE. But wait, actually, when it's accelerated through a potential, the initial electric force would cause acceleration. But since it's moving at a certain velocity, the magnetic field might come into play.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. When the proton is moving through both E and B, the net force is F = q(E + v × B). Oh wait, no, because the magnetic force is F_m = q(v × B). The electric force is F_e = qE.

But in this case, the proton's trajectory isn't affected by E and B. So the net force is zero. So F_e + F_m = 0 → F_e = -F_m. So qE = -q(v × B). The signs can be a bit tricky because vectors matter.

Wait, but the direction is more important than the magnitude. So the electric force must be equal in magnitude to the magnetic force, and their directions must be opposite.

So for the initial scenario (V), the electric field is in +x and the magnetic field is in +y. So let's think about the direction of the velocity.

The proton is moving in the +z direction. Because it was accelerated from rest through V in the +z direction. Wait, earlier part of the problem says that the proton moves in the +z direction after acceleration. So the initial velocity is v = v_z * ẑ.

Wait no, the problem states that after being accelerated from rest through V, the proton moves in the +z direction. So the initial velocity is in +z. So v_z is positive.

So, when the E field is in +x, and B in +y, the velocity is in +z.

So the magnetic force is q (v × B). Let's compute that. v is +z, B is +y. So v × B is (using right-hand rule) which direction? Point fingers in +z, then cross with +y. The cross product is in the direction of +x (since z × y is x). Wait, actually, cross product of z and y is (z × y) = x because the order matters. Wait, no, wait. The cross product of y and z is x. Because i×j=k, j×k=i, k×i=j. So y×z is -z×y? Wait, no, let me think: the cross product of vectors in order, a×b is a right-hand rule. So y × z is equal to - (z × y). Since z × y is same as -(y × z), wait, maybe I should think of the components.

In component form, y is (0,1,0), z is (0,0,1), and x is (1,0,0). So y × z = determinant:

i  j  k
0  1  0
0  0  1

Which is i*(1*1 - 0*0) - j*(0*1 - 0*0) + k*(0*0 - 0*1) → i*(1) - j*(0) + k*(0) → (1,0,0) → x. So y × z is x. So, v is in z, B in y: v × B = (v_z) * (x) → so the magnetic force is q v × B = q v_z x.

And the electric force is q E in +x, which is direction of E.

So, the forces are F_e = q E_x ẑ, and F_B = q v_z (x_hat) .

Since the net force is zero, F_e + F_B = 0 → F_e = -F_B → E = -v × B.

Wait, but the electric field direction is +x, and the magnetic force is in x direction. So their signs must be opposite.

So, E_x should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to v × B.

Wait, but v is in +z, B in +y: v × B is x direction. So, E is in +x, B in +y.

So, F_e = q E_x ẑ.

F_m = q (v × B) = q (v_z * (x_hat)).

So, F_e + F_m = 0 → q E_x ẑ + q v_z x_hat = 0.

Wait, but that can't be right because E_x and v_z are in different directions. Hmm, wait, no, the forces are in the same direction. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the electric force is in +x, and the magnetic force is in +x as well. But for their sum to be zero, they must be in opposite directions. So, E_x must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to v_z * (B_x?), wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, B is in +y. So, v is in +z. So, v × B is in +x direction. Therefore, the magnetic force will be in +x. So, the electric force must be in the opposite direction, which would be -x.

So, E_x must be equal in magnitude to v_z * B.

Wait, but what's the value of E?

Wait, the initial setup is that the proton is accelerated through a potential difference V. The energy gained by the proton is q V = (1/2) m v_z^2.

So, the initial velocity v_z is sqrt(2 q V / m).

But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant now.

So, the condition is that when the proton enters the E and B fields, the forces balance. So, E_x must be equal and opposite to v_z * B. Because the magnetic force is F_m = q v × B = q v_z (x direction). So F_e = q E_x in +x, and F_m is q v_z x direction.

So, F_e + F_m = 0 → q E_x + q v_z B = 0 → E_x = -v_z B.

So, E_x = - v_z B.

Wait, because F_e = q E_x in +x, and F_m is q v_z in +x.

So, E_x must be - v_z B to have F_e + F_m = 0.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the direction. So, the proton is moving in +z. The E field is in +x, B in +y.

The magnetic force on the proton is F_m = q (v × B) = q (v_z * (x_hat)). So, if v_z is positive, F_m is positive x. That means the magnetic force is pushing the proton in +x direction.

The electric force is F_e = q E_x ẑ. If E_x is positive, F_e is pushing in +x. But if E_x is negative, F_e is pushing in -x.

But in the problem, the forces are balanced. So F_e = - F_m. So F_e = - q v_z B x_hat.

Which implies that E_x must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to v_z * B.

So, E_x = - (v_z B) → E = -v_z B in x direction.

Wait, but the problem says that in the original setup, the trajectory is not affected. So, with both E and B, the net force is zero.

Wait, perhaps the initial velocity is such that the magnetic force is balanced by the electric force. So, E is v × B, but in the opposite direction.

So, moving forward, when the potential difference is doubled, let's see what happens.

In the new scenario, the potential difference is 2V. So, the proton's velocity v' (after being accelerated through 2V) is sqrt( (2 q (2V) ) / m ) → v' = sqrt(4 q V / m) = 2 v_z.

Wait, no, original velocity was sqrt(2 q V / m) → v_z = sqrt(2 q V / m). So, v' = sqrt(2 q (2V) / m )= sqrt( (4 q V ) / m ) = 2 v_z.

But initially, the velocity was v_z. Now, after being accelerated through 2V, it's twice as fast.

But wait, the E and B fields are the same: E in +x, B in +y. So, the same setup.

Wait, but the velocity is now v' = 2 v_z. So, the initial v in the problem is the velocity after being accelerated through V, so v_z = sqrt(2 q V / m).

So, when the new potential is 2V, the proton's velocity is higher. But the fields E and B remain the same.

Wait, the question is, after the change in V, the proton's trajectory is not affected. Wait, but that's the initial condition. Oh, wait, no. The question says that in the original setup, the proton's trajectory was not affected. Then, the experiment is repeated with 2V.

Wait, I need to re-read the problem statement.

The question says: a proton is accelerated through V, then moves through E and B fields, and trajectory is not affected. Then, it repeats the experiment with 2V. What happens?

Ah, so the initial setup is the same E and B fields (so B in +y, E in +x), and the proton is accelerated through V → velocity v_z. Then, in this setup, the motion is unaffected by E and B. Then, the experiment is repeated with 2V, meaning the proton's velocity is 2v_z. What happens now.

Wait, but wait. The problem says: when the proton moves through E and B fields, the trajectory isn't affected. So, perhaps that implies that the magnetic force is canceled by the electric force. So, the net force is zero, so F_electric = F_magnetic.

Wait, but in this case, the fields are E in x and B in y. So, the velocity is in z. So, F_e is q E x, and F_m is q (v × B) in x.

So, F_e = q E x, F_m = q (v_z [x_hat ]) (since B is y, v is z; cross product z × y is x). So, F_m = q v_z x_hat.

So, for F_e = F_m, q E = q v_z B → E = v_z B.

Alternatively, if the magnetic force is opposite to the electric force, then F_e = -F_m. So, E = -v_z B.

But in the setup, the proton's trajectory is not affected, which implies that the net force is zero. So, E_x = - v_z B.

Wait, but the problem says the proton's trajectory is not affected, which I think means that the net force is zero. So, F_e + F_m = 0 → F_e = - F_m.

So, E_x must be equal and opposite to v_z B.

So, E_x = - v_z B.

So, in the initial setup (V), E_x = - v_z B.

Now, when the potential is doubled to 2V, the proton's velocity is higher. Let me find the new velocity.

In the initial setup, the proton was accelerated through V. The kinetic energy gained is (1/2) m v_z^2 = q V → v_z = sqrt( 2 q V / m ).

If the potential is doubled to 2V, the kinetic energy becomes q * 2V. So,

(1/2) m v'^2 = 2 q V → v'^2 = (4 q V)/m → v' = 2 v_z.

So, the new velocity is twice as long.

Now, in the new scenario, the proton moves through E and B fields.

The E field is still +x, B is +y.

So, the magnetic force is again F_m = q (v' × B) = q (v_z' (x_hat) ) → because v' is in z.

So, F_m = q v' x_hat.

The electric force is F_e = q E_x ẑ.

So, what's E_x again? Well, since E_x = - v_z B (from the initial condition where the force was zero), and now v_z is 2 v_old_z, let's substitute.

So, E_x = - (2 v_old_z) * B. But from the initial condition, v_old_z comes from E_x = -v_old_z B → E_x = -v_old_z B.

But initially, E_x was -v_z B, so E_x = -v_old_z B.

So, in the new setup, E_x is still -2 v_old_z B. Because E_x depends on v_z, which has doubled.

Wait, no. Wait, E_x is determined by the initial condition where the proton's velocity was v_z, and the fields were E and B. After changing V, the velocity is higher, v' = 2 v_z.

But E_x is determined by the initial condition: E_x = - v_z B. So, yes, in the new scenario, E_x would be -2 v_z B.

So, the electric force becomes F_e = q (-2 v_z B) ẑ = -2 q v_z B ẑ.

And the magnetic force is F_m = q v' x_hat = q (2 v_z) x_hat.

Wait, so F_e = -2 q v_z B ẑ, F_m = 2 q v_z x_hat.

Wait, but E_x is -2 v_z B, and F_e is q E_x, which is -2 q v_z B.

The magnetic force is in x direction, F_m = q (2 v_z) x_hat.

So, the two forces are in opposite directions. So, the net force is F_e + F_m = (-2 q v_z B) ẑ + (2 q v_z) x_hat.

These two are in different directions, so net force is not zero. So the proton would experience a net force and accelerate.

Wait, but the question states that the proton's trajectory is not affected in the initial situation. So, in the first scenario, the net force was zero. But in the second scenario, the net force isn't zero. So, what happens?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial condition.

Wait, the initial setup (V) caused the net force to be zero. So, F_e = -F_m.

Which implies that E_x = - v_z B.

In the new scenario, the velocity is 2 v_z, so E_x is -2 v_z B. Then the magnetic force is F_m = q (2 v_z) x_hat.

So, F_e is q E_x ẑ = q (-2 v_z B) ẑ = -2 q v_z B ẑ.

So, the net force is F_e + F_m = (-2 q v_z B) ẑ + (2 q v_z B x_hat).

Wait, no, because E_x is in x direction, so F_e is in x, and F_m is in x. So, F_e = -2 q v_z B x_hat, and F_m = 2 q v_z x_hat. So, the net force is F_e + F_m = (-2 +2 ) q v_z B x_hat → zero. So, the net force is zero.

Wait, that's different. So the net force is zero, meaning the proton continues moving with constant velocity without acceleration.

So, in this case, the proton would move in the same direction as the velocity after being accelerated through 2V. But wait, what was the direction in the first scenario?

In the first scenario, the proton was moving in z. After being accelerated through 2V, velocity v' is twice as big, but in the same direction (z), but the fields are the same.

Wait, but the magnetic and electric fields are fixed. So, the proton's velocity is now 2v_z in z direction, E is in x, B in y.

So, the magnetic force is F_m = q (2 v_z) x_hat.

Electric force is F_e = -2 q v_z B x_hat.

So, F_m = 2 q v_z x_hat.

F_e = -2 q v_z B x_hat.

So, the net force is F_e + F_m = (2 q v_z - 2 q v_z B ) x_hat.

Wait, but B and v_z are related. Because in the first scenario, E_x was -v_z B. So, E_x = - (v_z) B.

In the second scenario, v_z is 2 v_old_z.

Wait, because in the first scenario, the velocity was v_old_z = sqrt(2 q V / m). So, in the second scenario, v' = 2 v_old_z.

So, v_z = v_old_z * 2.

Then, E_x = - v_z B → E_x = - (2 v_old_z) B.

So, E_x is -2 v_old_z B.

So, F_e = q E_x = q (-2 v_old_z B) → -2 q v_old_z B x_hat.

F_m = q (v_z) x_hat = q (2 v_old_z) x_hat → 2 q v_old_z x_hat.

So, F_e = -2 q v_old_z B x_hat, F_m = 2 q v_old_z x_hat.

Thus, F_e + F_m = 0. So, the net force is zero.

So the proton continues moving in the same direction as before, which was z.

Wait, but the initial setup was that the proton was moving in z, and after being accelerated, the force was balanced by E and B.

In the second scenario, the proton is moving in z, same as before, because the initial acceleration was done before the fields were applied. The fields are applied in the same way, but the velocity is higher.

Wait, no, because the fields are same in direction, but the velocity is higher. So, in the second scenario, the proton's velocity is higher in the same direction. The fields are fixed.

So, the net force is zero → no acceleration. So the proton continues moving in the same direction, which is z.

But wait, what about the direction of the initial proton's velocity? Let me think about that.

Wait, in the first scenario, the proton was moving in +z, and after acceleration, it was moving in +z. Then, E and B fields were applied, and the proton's trajectory was not affected.

In the second scenario, the proton is accelerated through 2V, so velocity is higher, but direction is same (z) because the acceleration is in z.

Wait, but wait. No, the acceleration is done through a potential difference, which is same for both scenarios. So, the velocity is higher, but the direction is same, z, because the acceleration is in the same direction.

Wait, but the velocity is higher, but direction remains same because the acceleration is done in the same direction. So, the proton's velocity is in +z.

So, when the proton is in the fields E (x) and B (y), and moving in +z, so the velocity is in +z, the fields are E (x), B (y).

So, the magnetic force on the proton is F_m = q (v × B) = q (v_z x_hat) × (B y_hat) = q (v_z * (x_hat × y_hat)).

x_hat × y_hat = z_hat, so F_m = q v_z z_hat.

The electric force is F_e = q E_x x_hat.

So, the net force is F_m + F_e.

But E_x is determined by the initial condition: when the proton was accelerated through V, E_x was -v_z B.

In the second scenario, the velocity is now 2 v_z, so E_x is - (2 v_z) B.

So, F_e = q (-2 v_z B) x_hat = -2 q v_z B x_hat.

F_m = q (2 v_z) x_hat → 2 q v_z x_hat.

So, F_e + F_m = (-2 + 2) q v_z B x_hat = 0.

So, net force is zero → no acceleration. So, the proton continues moving in +z direction.

So, in the second scenario, the proton moves in the same direction as before, which is +z. So, looking at the options, option C is +z.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial condition.

Wait, in the initial scenario, the proton is accelerated through V, so it has velocity v_z.

E_x is determined as -v_z B.

So, F_e = q (-v_z B) x_hat = - q v_z B x_hat.

F_m = q (v_z) x_hat → q v_z x_hat.

So, F_e + F_m = (-v_z B + v_z B) x_hat = 0 → no acceleration.

In the second scenario, when the proton is accelerated through 2V, v' = 2 v_z.

E_x is determined by the same initial condition: E_x = - (v_old_z) B.

Wait, no. Because in the first scenario, the velocity v_old_z is from E_x and B fields.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the initial setup (V) is such that the proton's velocity is v_z, and E and B are set to balance the forces. So, E_x = - v_z B.

In the second scenario, the proton is accelerated through 2V, so its velocity is 2v_z.

But the fields E and B are the same as before. So, E_x = - v_z B, and v_z is the velocity from the first scenario.

So, in the second scenario, the velocity is 2 v_z, so the same v_z applies, but doubled.

So, E_x is - v_z B, because v_z is the velocity from the first scenario.

So, F_e = q E_x = q (-v_z B) = - q v_z B x_hat.

F_m = q (v' × B) = q (v_z' × B).

Wait, v' is 2 v_z, because it's twice as much.

So, v' × B = 2 v_z × B.

Wait, but in the initial setup, v_z × B is x_hat, but with E_x = - v_z B, so E_x is in -x direction.

Wait, no. Let's think about it again.

In the initial scenario, the proton is accelerated through V, giving it velocity v_z. Then, the electric and magnetic fields are applied such that the net force is zero. So, E_x is set to - v_z B in the x direction.

In the second scenario, when the proton is accelerated through 2V, the velocity is v' = 2 v_z. The fields E and B are the same. So, E_x is still - v_z B, but the velocity is 2 v_z.

So, the magnetic force is F_m = q (v' × B) = q (2 v_z × B).

But earlier, in the initial scenario, v_z × B = x_hat. So, 2 v_z × B = 2 x_hat.

So, F_m = q (2 v_z × B) = 2 q v_z x_hat.

F_e = q E_x = q (-v_z B) = - q v_z B x_hat.

So, F_e + F_m = (- q v_z B x_hat ) + ( 2 q v_z x_hat ) = (q v_z ( -B + 2 ) ) x_hat.

But in the initial scenario, since F_e + F_m = 0, we have (- q v_z B ) + ( q v_z B ) ) x_hat = 0 → 0 = 0.

So, in the second scenario, the forces add up to q v_z ( - B + 2 ) x_hat.

Wait, but I don't know the values of B and v_z.

Wait, but I can compute this based on the initial condition.

In the initial scenario, the proton's velocity is v_z. Since v_z = sqrt( 2 q V / m ), and E_x is -v_z B.

But in the initial scenario, the fields are set so that F_e = - F_m, so E_x = - v_z B.

But in the second scenario, the proton's velocity is 2 v_z, but the fields are the same as before.

So, E_x is still -v_z B.

So, F_e = q (-v_z B) = - q v_z B.

F_m = q (2 v_z) x_hat.

So, F_e + F_m = [ (- q v_z B ) + ( 2 q v_z ) ) ] x_hat = q v_z ( - B + 2 ) x_hat.

But from the initial condition, the fields are set so that F_e + F_m = 0.

Which implies that - q v_z B + q v_z B = 0 → 0 = 0, which doesn't help.

So, perhaps I should compute the net force in the second scenario.

F_net = F_m + F_e = q (2 v_z x_hat ) + q (-v_z B x_hat ) → q ( 2 v_z x_hat - v_z B x_hat ) = q v_z (2 - B) x_hat.

Hmm, but without knowing B, I can't compute this.

Wait, but from the initial condition, we have E_x = - v_z B.

So, in the second scenario, E_x is still - v_z B.

But proton's velocity is 2 v_z, so v_z in second scenario is 2 v_old_z.

So, let's compute E_x in the second scenario.

E_x = - v_z B.

In the initial scenario, v_z = sqrt( 2 q V / m ).

In the second scenario, v_z' = 2 v_z, so E_x' = - (2 v_z) B.

Wait, but in the initial scenario, E_x was -v_z B.

So, perhaps the fields are fixed, and in the second scenario, the velocity is higher, but the fields are same.

So, perhaps the net force is F_e + F_m = (-2 v_z B + 2 v_z) x_hat.

Wait, but that's where I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the initial condition.

In the initial condition, F_e + F_m = 0 → E_x = -v_z B.

In the second condition, with V' = 2V, the proton's velocity is v' = 2 v_z.

Then, the fields are same as before.

So, E_x is still -v_z B.

So, F_e = q E_x = q (- v_z B) = - q v_z B.

F_m = q (v' × B) = q (2 v_z × B) = 2 q v_z B.

So, F_e + F_m = [ - q v_z B + 2 q v_z B ] = q v_z B.

So, net force is q v_z B in x direction.

Wait, that's positive x direction.

So, the proton accelerates in the +x direction.

But that would mean the options are not including that.

Wait, but the options are:

A. +x

B. +y

C. +z

D. None.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the net force is q v_z B x_hat. Since B is a positive quantity (field strength), and v_z is positive (velocity in +z direction), and q is positive (charge of proton), the net force is in +x direction.

But wait, I'm not sure about the direction of E and B. Let me re-examine the initial condition.

In the initial setup, the proton is accelerated through V. The electric field E is in +x direction, but the magnetic field B is in +y direction.

Wait, no, the fields are set such that the net force on the proton is zero.

In the initial scenario, the proton's velocity is v_z in +z.

E_x is set to -v_z B.

So, F_e = q (-v_z B) x_hat.

F_m is q (v_z) x_hat.

So, F_e + F_m = (- v_z B + v_z B ) x_hat → 0.

So, in the initial setup, the net force is zero.

In the second scenario, the proton is accelerated through 2V, so velocity is 2v_z in +z.

E_x is still -v_z B.

F_e = q (-v_z B) x_hat.

F_m = q (2 v_z) x_hat.

So, F_e + F_m = ( - v_z B + 2 v_z B ) x_hat → v_z B x_hat.

So, the net force is in +x direction.

So, the proton accelerates in +x.

But the options don't have this. So, the correct answer is D: none.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the net force in the second scenario is zero.

Wait, let me re-calculate.

In the initial setup, proton is accelerated through V. So, its velocity is v_z.

To have net force zero, E_x = - v_z B.

So, F_e = q (-v_z B) x_hat.

F_m = q (v_z) x_hat.

So, F_e + F_m = (- v_z B + v_z B) x_hat → 0.

In the second scenario, the proton is accelerated through 2V, so its velocity is 2v_z.

The fields E and B are the same as before.

So, E_x is still -v_z B.

F_e = q (-v_z B) x_hat.

F_m = q (2 v_z) x_hat.

So, F_e + F_m = (-v_z B + 2 v_z B) x_hat → v_z B x_hat.

Which is a net force in +x direction.

So, the proton accelerates in +x direction.

But the options are A: +x, B: +y, C: +z, D: None.

So, the correct answer is D: None.

The problem involves a proton moving through a region with electric and magnetic fields. Initially, the proton is accelerated through a potential difference \( V \), and the fields are set such that the net force on the proton is zero. This setup implies that the electric field \( E \) and magnetic field \( B \) are related by \( E_x = -v_z B \), where \( v_z \) is the velocity of the proton after being accelerated through \( V \).

In the second scenario, the proton is accelerated through \( 2V \), doubling its velocity to \( 2v_z \). The fields \( E \) and \( B \) remain unchanged. The forces acting on the proton are:

1. **Electric Force**: \( F_e = q E_x = q (-v_z B) x\).
2. **Magnetic Force**: \( F_m = q (v' \times B) = q (2v_z \times B) x\).

Since \( E_x = -v_z B \), the electric force simplifies to \( F_e = -q v_z B x \). The magnetic force, using \( v' = 2v_z \), becomes \( F_m = 2q v_z B x \). Adding these forces gives:

\[
F_{\text{net}} = F_e + F_m = (-q v_z B x) + (2q v_z B x) = q v_z B x.
\]

This shows that a net force acts on the proton in the \( +x \) direction. Since the proton was initially moving in the \( +x \) direction, this net force causes the proton to accelerate further in the \( +x \) direction.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A. \( +x \)**: This is correct, as the net force in the \( +x \) direction causes the proton to accelerate.
- **B. \( +y \)**: Incorrect, as the magnetic force in the \( +y \) direction is irrelevant in this scenario.
- **C. \( +z \)**: Incorrect, as the proton's velocity is \( 2v_z \) in the \( +x \) direction, not \( +z \).
- **D. None**: Incorrect, as the proton does accelerate in the \( +x \) direction.
