Okay, so I've got this question about partnership interests and basis. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when someone acquires a partnership interest, their basis can change based on how they contributed property. 

The question says Strom acquired a 25% interest in Ace by contributing a piece of land. The land's adjusted basis is $16,000, and it's worth $50,000 in fair market value. There's a mortgage of $24,000 that Ace assumed. No other liabilities at the time.

Wait, so the land is subject to a $24,000 mortgage. I remember that when a partner contributes property to a partnership, their basis in the partnership interest is typically the adjusted basis of the contributed property, but only for the portion that's contributed. Or wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because the assumption of liabilities might affect the basis.

Oh wait, I think when a partner takes a partnership interest by contributing property, the new partner's basis is the adjusted basis of the contributed property. But sometimes, there's a rule about the partnership taking over liabilities. Or is it about the adjusted basis of the property?

Wait, I'm a bit mixed up. Let me try to recall. The basis of the contributed property is their adjusted basis, but when they contribute, their basis in the partnership interest is equal to the adjusted basis of the property. But wait, I think there's another rule. Oh right! There's a rule that the new partner's basis is the adjusted basis of the property contributed, unless the partnership acquired a material interest, in which case their basis is adjusted down.

Wait, but in this case, Strom bought a 25% interest. Is that material? Well, a 25% interest in a partnership may not be material unless it's a partnership in which they have significant influence. But in this case, the question doesn't mention anything about significant influence, so perhaps it's not material. So the basis would just be the adjusted basis of the property, which is $16,000.

But wait, the problem arises when the property is mortgaged. Oh wait, no—because the assumption of a mortgage is part of the partnership's assets. So the basis calculation might involve the mortgage. I think when a partner takes a partnership interest by contributing property, that property's basis is their own adjusted basis. But wait, the partnership may assume the mortgage, which could affect their basis.

Wait, I remember a rule that if the partner takes a partnership interest by contributing property, their basis is the adjusted basis of the property. But if the property is mortgaged, the basis is the adjusted basis plus any mortgage. Wait, no—wait, no: Let me think again.

Wait, when a partner takes a partnership interest by contributing property, the partnership's basis in the property is adjusted for any liabilities. But the contributing partner's basis in the partnership interest is equal to their adjusted basis in the property. So, for example, if a partner contributes a property with a mortgage, their basis in the partnership interest is their adjusted basis plus the mortgage. Because the partnership assumes the liability.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think. Suppose the property is mortgaged by the partner. Then the partner's basis in the property is their adjusted basis plus the mortgage. But when the partner takes the partnership interest by contributing the property, their basis in the partnership interest would be the adjusted basis of the property plus the mortgage. Because the partnership is taking on the liability of the mortgage. So their basis would be 16,000 + 24,000 = 40,000.

But wait, that's not the case. Because the question is about Strom's basis in Ace. So their basis in the partnership interest (Ace) would be 40,000.

Alternatively, another approach: When a partner acquires partnership interest by contributing property, the partner's basis in the partnership interest is equal to the adjusted basis of the property contributed. But if the partner takes on a liability in the property (like a mortgage), that liability is subtracted from the partner's basis in the property, and the basis in the partnership interest is adjusted accordingly.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up the correct method. Oh wait, but I don't have that luxury in this scenario. So I'll try to think it through.

When a partner takes a partnership interest by contributing property, the partner's basis is equal to the adjusted basis of the property. But if the property is mortgaged by the partner, then the partner's basis in the property is their adjusted basis plus the mortgage. Because the partnership assumes the mortgage, so the partner's basis in the property increases by the mortgage. Then, when they take the partnership interest, their basis in the partnership interest is this adjusted basis plus the mortgage. Wait, no—wait, no. Because the property is being sold (or given) to the partner, so the partner's basis in the partnership interest is the adjusted basis of the property plus any assumed liabilities.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct way is that the partner's basis in the partnership interest is equal to the adjusted basis of the property they contributed. But wait, if the property is mortgaged, the partner's adjusted basis in the property is their original basis plus any mortgage. But the partner's basis in the partnership interest is their adjusted basis in the property. So if the partner contributes a property with a $24k mortgage, their adjusted basis in the property is $16k + $24k = $40k. So their basis in the partnership interest is $40k.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't have $40k as option B. Wait, looking at the options:

Options are A:24k, B:40k, etc. So option B is 40k. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but I thought that when a partner takes a partnership interest by contributing property, their basis in the partnership interest is equal to the adjusted basis of the property contributed.

Alternatively, I've heard another approach: the partner's basis in the partnership interest is the same as the adjusted basis of the contributed property, unless they take on a partnership interest, in which case their basis is adjusted down.

But in this case, the problem is that the partner took a 25% interest in the partnership. So their basis in the partnership interest is the adjusted basis of the property plus any assumed liabilities.

Wait, no. The partner's basis in the partnership interest is the adjusted basis of the property. Because when a partner contributes property to a partnership, their basis in the partnership interest is equal to the adjusted basis of the property contributed. But in this scenario, the property is mortgaged; does that mean the partner's basis in the property is higher?

Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The partner's adjusted basis in the property is their original basis plus any mortgage assumed by the partner. So their basis in the property is 16,000 + 24,000 = 40,000. Then, when they take the partnership interest by contributing the property, their basis in the partnership interest becomes equal to the adjusted basis in the property, which is 40,000. So their basis in Ace would be 40,000.

Alternatively, I've read that when a partner takes a partnership interest by contributing property, the basis in the partnership interest is the adjusted basis of the property. But if the property is mortgaged, the partner's basis in the property is their adjusted basis plus the mortgage, and when they take the interest, their basis in the partnership interest is that adjusted basis plus the mortgage. Wait, no, that can't be right because the basis in the partnership interest would be the same as the adjusted basis of the property, because the partnership is taking on the liability.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the partnership's accounting. The partnership's basis in the property would be adjusted for the mortgage. So if the partner takes the interest by contributing the property, their basis in the partnership interest is the adjusted basis of the property, which is 16k + 24k = 40k, plus any other adjustments. But wait, the question is about Strom's basis in Ace, which is the partnership interest. So that would be 40k.

But wait, the other approach: the partner's basis in the partnership interest is equal to the adjusted basis of the property they contributed. Because when the partner contributes the property, their basis in the partnership interest becomes the adjusted basis of the property. But since the property is mortgaged, the partner's basis in the property increases by the mortgage. So their basis in the partnership interest is their adjusted basis plus the mortgage. So 16k + 24k = 40k.

So the correct answer would be B) 40k.

When Strom acquired a 25% interest in Ace Partnership by contributing land, the basis in Ace is determined as follows:

1. **Adjusted Basis of Land**: The land has an adjusted basis of $16,000.
2. **Mortgage Assumption**: The land was mortgaged by Ace for $24,000, which the partner assumes. This increases the partner's basis in the property by $24,000.
3. **Basis in Land**: The partner's basis in the land is the sum of the adjusted basis of the land ($16,000) and the assumed mortgage ($24,000), totaling $40,000.
4. **Basis in Partnership Interest**: Since the partner takes a 25% interest in the partnership by contributing the land, their basis in the partnership interest (Ace) is equal to the basis in the land, which is $40,000.

Thus, Strom's basis in Ace is $40,000.
