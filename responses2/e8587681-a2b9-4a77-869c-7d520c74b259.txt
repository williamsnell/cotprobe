Okay, so I have this question about calculating the average atomic weight of natural sulfur. Hmm, I remember from chemistry class that average atomic weight is like a weighted average based on the isotopes and their natural abundances. Right, each isotope contributes a certain amount to the average based on how much of the element it makes up.

The question gives me the natural abundances and the isotopic masses. Let me list them out:

- 95.0% of 10S²² (mass 31.97207 u)
- 0.76% of 10S²³ (mass 32.97146 u)
- 4.22% of 10S²⁴ (mass 33.96786 u)
- 0.02% of 10S²⁶ (mass 35.96709 u)

Wait, natural abundance, so I think I need to convert the percentages to decimals and multiply each by the isotope's mass, then add them all up.

So first, I'll convert the percentages to decimals. 

95% is 0.95, 0.76 is 0.0076, 4.22% is 0.0422, and 0.02% is 0.0002.

Now, multiply each abundance by its mass and sum them.

Let me calculate each term:

1. 0.95 * 31.97207 = Let's see, 0.95 times 31 is 28.85, 0.95 * 0.97207 is about 0.92396. So 28.85 + 0.92396 = around 29.77396 u.

Wait, but wait, 0.95 * 31.97207 = Let me compute it more accurately.

31.97207 * 0.95: 

31.97207 * 0.95 = ?

Well, 31.97207 * 0.95 = 31.97207 * (1 - 0.05) = 31.97207 - (31.97207 *0.05)

0.05 *31.97207 is 1.5986035. So 31.97207 -1.5986035=20.3734665. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 95% is just the majority. Wait wait, maybe I did a mistake here. Wait, I'm getting 0.95 * 31.97207 is 31.97207*(95/100) = 31.97207 * 0.95.

Wait, 31.97207 * 0.95: Let me compute 31.97207 * 0.95.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute it step by step. Let's think:

31.97207 * 0.95 = ?

Well, 31.97207 * 0.95 = (30 + 1.97207) * 0.95 = 30*0.95 + 1.97207*0.95.

30*0.95=28.5.

1.97207 * 0.95: 1.97207 *0.95 = let me compute that.

1.97207 * 0.95 = (2 - 0.02793) *0.95 = 2*0.95 -0.02793*0.95.

2*0.95=1.9.

0.02793 *0.95 = approx 0.0267335.

So 1.9 -0.0267335=1.8732665.

So the total is 28.5 + 1.8732665 = 29.3732665 u.

Wait, wait, but that seems like a high value because 95% of 32 would be 30.8, but here it's 29.37 u. Hmm, maybe I should double-check the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as 31.97207 *0.95.

Wait, 31.97207 * 0.95: 31.97207 * 95 = 31.97207 * (90 +5) = ?

Wait, 31.97207 *90 = 2877.4863, and 31.97207 *5=159.86035. So sum is 2877.4863 + 159.86035 = 3037.34665. Then divide by 100 to get 0.95, so 30.3734665. So approximately 30.3735 u.

Wait, but that's 0.95 times 31.97207, which is about 30.3735 u.

Wait, but earlier I thought 0.95 *32 is 30.8, but here it's 30.3735, which makes sense. Because 31.97207 is just below 32, so 95% of that is slightly less than 32.

Then the next term is 0.76% of 32.97146.

So 0.76% is 0.76/100=0.0076.

So 0.0076 * 32.97146 = let's compute that.

32.97146 *0.0076.

32 *0.0076= 0.2432.

0.97146 *0.0076 = approx 0.007384456.

So total is 0.2432 +0.007384456=0.250584456 u.

Then the third term: 4.22% of 33.96786.

So 4.22% is 0.0422.

33.96786 *0.0422.

Let me compute 33 *0.0422 = 1.3926.

0.96786 *0.0422: 0.96786 *0.04= 0.0387144, 0.96786 *0.0022 = approx 0.002129292.

Adding those gives 0.0387144 +0.002129292=0.040843692.

So total is 1.3926 +0.040843692=1.433443692 u.

Wait, no, wait, 33.96786 *0.0422 is (33 +0.96786) *0.0422.

33*0.0422 = 1.3926.

0.96786 *0.0422 = let's compute that precisely:

0.96786 * 0.0422 = ?

Let me compute 0.96786 * 0.04 = 0.0387144.

0.96786 *0.0022 = 0.002129292.

Adding them: 0.0387144 +0.002129292 = 0.040843692.

So total is 1.3926 +0.040843692=1.433443692 u.

Wait, but wait, that's just the 33.96786 *0.0422. So that's 1.43344 u.

The last term is 0.02% of 35.96709.

So 0.02% is 0.0002.

35.96709 *0.0002 =0.007193418 u.

Now, adding all the contributions:

First term: 30.3735 u.

Second term: 0.250584456 u.

Third term: 1.433443692 u.

Fourth term: 0.007193418 u.

Total average atomic weight = sum of all these.

Let me sum them up step by step.

30.3735 +0.250584456 = 30.624084456.

Plus 1.433443692: 30.624084456 +1.433443692= 32.057528148.

Plus 0.007193418: 32.057528148 +0.007193418=32.064721566 u.

Wait, but let me check that again.

Wait, 30.3735 +0.250584456 is 30.624084456.

30.624084456 +1.433443692 =32.057528148.

32.057528148 +0.007193418 =32.064721566 u.

Hmm, that's about 32.0647 u.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have 32.06... Let me check.

Options:

A:32.07550

B:32.06469

C:31.97207

D:32.50000

E:31.96355

F:34.96900

G:33.98450

H:32.06540

I:33.96786

J:32.97146

So I got about 32.0647 u, which is very close to option B:32.06469.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when you have precise numbers, it's easy to make a mistake in the arithmetic.

Wait, let me recalculate each term accurately.

Term 1: 0.95 *31.97207 = ?

Calculating 31.97207 *0.95.

As earlier, 31.97207 *0.95 = 31.97207*(1 -0.05) = 31.97207 - (31.97207 *0.05).

31.97207 *0.05 = 1.5986035.

So 31.97207 -1.5986035 = 30.3734665 u.

Term 2: 0.0076 *32.97146 = ?

32.97146 *0.0076.

32.97146 *0.007 is 0.23079922.

32.97146 *0.0006 =0.019782876.

Adding them: 0.23079922 +0.019782876 =0.250582096 u.

Term3: 0.0422 *33.96786 = ?

33.96786 *0.0422.

33.96786 *0.04 =1.3587144.

33.96786 *0.0022= 0.074729292.

Sum: 1.3587144 +0.074729292=1.433443692 u.

Term4:0.0002 *35.96709 =0.007193418 u.

Now, adding all four terms:

30.3734665 (term1) + 0.250582096 (term2) =30.624048596.

Plus 1.433443692: 30.624048596 +1.433443692=32.057492288.

Plus 0.007193418: 32.057492288 +0.007193418=32.064685706 u.

Approximately 32.06469 u.

Looking at the options, option B is 32.06469 u. So that's the correct answer.

To calculate the average atomic weight of natural sulfur, we use the formula for the weighted average of the isotopes and their masses. The natural abundances are given as:

- **95.0% of ¹⁰S²² (mass 31.97207 u)**
- **0.76% of ¹⁰S²³ (mass 32.97146 u)**
- **4.22% of ¹⁰S²⁴ (mass 33.96786 u)**
- **0.02% of ¹⁰S²⁶ (mass 35.96709 u)**

The average atomic weight is calculated by converting the percentages to decimals and multiplying each by its isotope's mass, then summing the results:

1. **Term 1: 95.0% (0.95) of ¹⁰S²² (31.97207 u)**  
   \( 0.95 \times 31.97207 = 30.3734665 \, \text{u} \)

2. **Term 2: 0.76% (0.0076) of ¹⁰S²³ (32.97146 u)**  
   \( 0.0076 \times 32.97146 = 0.250582096 \, \text{u} \)

3. **Term 3: 4.22% (0.0422) of ¹⁰S²⁴ (33.96786 u)**  
   \( 0.0422 \times 33.96786 = 1.433443692 \, \text{u} \)

4. **Term 4: 0.02% (0.0002) of ¹⁰S²⁶ (35.96709 u)**  
   \( 0.0002 \times 35.96709 = 0.007193418 \, \text{u} \)

Adding these contributions:

\[
\begin{align*}
30.3734665 \, (\text{Term 1}) & + 0.250582096 \, (\text{Term 2}) \\
&= 30.624048596 \, \text{u} \\
&+ 1.433443692 \, (\text{Term 3}) \\
&= 32.057492288 \, \text{u} \\
&+ 0.007193418 \, (\text{Term 4}) \\
&= 32.064685706 \, \text{u}.
\end{align*}
\]

The calculated average atomic weight is approximately **32.06469 u**. Among the provided options:

- **A: 32.07550 u**  
- **B: 32.06469 u**  
- **C: 31.97207 u**  
- **D: 32.50000 u**  
- **E: 31.96355 u**  
- **F: 34.96900 u**  
- **G: 33.98450 u**  
- **H: 32.06540 u**  
- **I: 33.96786 u**  
- **J: 32.97146 u**

The correct answer is **B: 32.06469 u**.
