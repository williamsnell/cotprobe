Okay, so I have this question about whether aggressiveness is instinctual. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what the general contentions are regarding whether aggressiveness is instinctual. The options are A to J, each presenting different points.

First, I need to understand what instinctual means. From what I remember, instinct refers to instinctual traits, which are heritable and developed through learning and observation. So instinctual traits are those that come from our genes or learned experiences.

Looking at the options:

Option A says aggressiveness is determined by genetic inheritance alone. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because instinct is more about learned experiences and environment. So maybe A is incorrect because instinct isn't just genetic.

Option B says aggression has no instinctual basis in man. That can't be right because instinct is a trait that is instinctual. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C claims it's purely instinctual. That's what instinct is about, so this seems correct.

Option D says aggression is a response only to immediate stimuli. I'm not sure. Maybe instinct isn't just about immediate responses. Like, instinct involves long-term learning beyond a single event.

Option E says it's an exclusively human trait. So unless other animals have it, that's correct, but it's not the main point here.

Option F suggests it can be eradicated through education. I don't think that's correct. Education probably doesn't eliminate instinct, as instinct is more about behavior learned through experience.

Option G says it's a complex interaction. That makes sense because instinct involves both innate tendencies and learned responses. So G is a correct contention.

Option H claims it's solely learned. No, because instinct is part of instinctual traits, which are learned.

Option I says it's seasonal. I'm not sure about this. Some behaviors are learned, but instinct doesn't necessarily involve seasonal changes unless it's learned through environmental factors.

Option J says it emerges only without structures. I don't think that's true. Even without societal structures, instinct might still develop.

So putting it all together, the main contentions are that instinct is a combination of innate and learned, and that instinctual traits are heritable. So options C, G, and others.

Looking back at the options, the correct contentions are:

Option C: Aggressiveness is purely instinctual. Wait, no, because instinct also includes learned responses. So maybe option G is correct.

Wait, let me re-examine each option.

Option C: Aggressiveness is purely instinctual. That's correct because instinct is instinctual.

Option G: Aggressiveness is a complex interaction between innate tendencies and learned responses. Yes, that's correct. So both C and G are correct.

Wait, but the question is asking for the general contentions. So which options are correct?

The question is asking for the general contentions, which means which statements are correct in general. So:

- Option C: Aggressiveness is purely instinctual. Correct.
- Option G: Aggressiveness is a complex interaction between innate and learned. Correct.

Other options:

Option A: Incorrect because instinct isn't genetic alone.
Option B: Incorrect because instinct is a trait.
Option D: Incorrect because instinct is learned.
Option E: Incorrect, because it's not exclusively human.
Option F: Incorrect, because it's not eradicated.
Option H: Incorrect, it's learned.
Option I: Incorrect, learned but not necessarily seasonal.
Option J: Incorrect, even without structures, instinct can emerge.

So the correct options are C and G.

Wait, but the question lists each option as a separate claim. So the possible answers are which ones are correct. So the options are A to J, each a separate claim.

Since the question is asking for the general contentions, perhaps all the correct options are correct contentions.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice question with options A to J, each being a claim. The question is asking what are the general contentions as to whether or not aggressiveness is instinctual. So each claim is a contention. So the correct answers are the claims that are true.

Which claims are correct?

C: Aggressiveness is purely instinctual. Correct.

G: Aggressiveness is a complex interaction between innate and learned responses. Correct.

So both C and G are correct.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer choices are the options which are correct. So the question is a multiple-choice with options A to J, each a separate claim, and the correct answers are the claims that are true.

Wait, but the question is a single question, so the answer is one letter (A to J), not multiple.

Wait, no. Wait the user says "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." But the question is a multiple-choice with options A to J, and the user is asking to select the correct option, but in the way the question is presented, perhaps the options are the different statements, and the user wants the letter that is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the user's question again.

The user presents a question, and the options are A to J. The question is asking which of the statements (A to J) are correct. But the user says, "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So maybe the task is to select the correct option from A to J, and give the letter as the answer.

Wait, but the way the question is presented, the user's question is: What are the general contentions as to whether or not aggressiveness is instinctual? Then the options are A to J, each a possible claim.

So the intended answer is probably the option that correctly states the contentions. So the answer is the correct claim(s).

In the given options, the correct claims are C and G.

So the question is presented as a single-choice, but the user is expecting the letter (A-J) as the answer.

Wait, no. The user didn't say it's a single-choice question, but the way it's presented, it's a multiple-choice question with options A to J.

Wait, no, the user is presenting a question with options A to J. So the task is to select the correct answer.

Wait, but in the initial instruction, the user says: "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen."

But the initial question is presented as a multiple-choice. So perhaps the correct way is to select the correct option (A-J) as the answer.

So the correct answers are claims C and G.

So the options are C and G.

Wait, but the options are from A to J, each a claim. So the task is to choose which among these claims is correct.

Wait, but the initial question is about the general contentions. So all the contentions in the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the contentions are that it's a combination of instinct and learned responses (G), and that instinct is the basis for aggression (C). So the correct options are C and G.

But the user is asking for the letter to choose. So perhaps the correct options are C and G, but in the multiple-choice options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both C and G, but since the options are A to J, each being a claim, perhaps the correct answer is the combination.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C: Aggressiveness is purely instinctual. Because instinct is the basis for it.

Wait, but the initial question is about whether or not it's instinctual. So perhaps G is correct, as it's a complex interaction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all contentions about it being instinctual are incorrect except for G.

Wait, no, because instinct is a trait, not a behavior. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both C and G, but since the options in the question are individual claims, the correct answer is which of these claims are correct.

But the user is asking for the letter (A-J), so perhaps the correct answer is the combination of these statements.

Wait, but I think the correct answers are that G is correct, because it's a combination of innate and learned responses.

And C is correct, as it's purely instinctual.

Wait, but the options are separate contentions, so I think the correct answers are both C and G.

But in the multiple-choice options, each is a separate option. So perhaps the correct answer is that both C and G are correct.

But perhaps the initial question is not structured to allow multiple correct options, but perhaps the correct answer is C and G.

Wait, but the user is asking for the letter of the correct answer. So perhaps the correct contentions are that it's a combination (G) and that it's instinctual (C).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, because it's a correct statement.

Wait, but in the options, both C and G are correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is both C and G, but the options are single letters.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of what each option says:

Option C: Aggressiveness is purely instinctual. Yes, that's correct.

Option G: Aggressiveness is a complex interaction between innate tendencies and learned responses. Yes, correct.

So both C and G are correct contentions.

But in the multiple-choice setup here, perhaps the user wants the letter that is correct, but since the options are A-J, perhaps both C and G are correct, but the options don't let you select multiple. So perhaps the intended correct answer is G, because C is not a correct contention.

Wait, but I thought C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that it's a combination, so G is correct.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is C and G, but the options don't allow that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that it's a combination of instinct and learned, so G is correct, and C is also correct.

But in the initial setup, each option is a separate claim. So the correct answers are C and G.

But the user is asking for the letter (A-J), so perhaps the correct answer is both C and G, but since the options are separate, the correct answer would be the combination of the correct claims. But the user expects the letter, so perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think again.

The question is about whether or not aggressiveness is instinctual. The options are about claims.

Which of these claims are correct?

C: Aggressiveness is purely instinctual. - Correct.

G: Aggressiveness is a complex interaction between innate tendencies and learned responses. - Correct.

So both C and G are correct. But the user is asking for the letter, so perhaps the correct answer is both C and G, but the options are not multiple-select.

Wait, but the user says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen," which suggests that the answer is a single letter (A-J), so maybe only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G is correct, and C is incorrect. Wait, but C says it's purely instinctual, which is correct.

Hmm. I think I need to pick the correct answer, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but instinct is a trait, so C is correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Maybe the correct answer is C and G. But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is C and G.

Wait, but the user is only asking for the letter, so perhaps the correct answer is G.

But I'm not entirely confident.

The question asks about the contentions regarding whether or not aggressiveness is instinctual. Here's the analysis:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Aggressiveness is not determined by genetic inheritance alone; it involves learned responses.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Aggressiveness is a biological trait, not a learned instinct.
- **Option C**: Correct. Aggressiveness is a instinctual trait, based on learned experiences and environmental factors.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Aggressiveness does not solely depend on immediate environmental stimuli; it also involves learned responses.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Aggressiveness is not exclusively human; other animals exhibit similar traits.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. It is possible to eliminate instinct through education, but instinct is not solely human.
- **Option G**: Correct. Aggressiveness is a complex interaction involving both innate tendencies and learned responses.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. While instinct is learned, it is not solely learned.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While instinct exists, it is not exclusively learned.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Even without societal structures, instinct can emerge.

Both **C** and **G** are correct contentions. However, since the user expects a single letter, the intended answer is likely **G**, as it highlights the complex interaction of innate and learned responses, which is a key aspect of instinctual traits.
