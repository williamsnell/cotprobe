Okay, so I have this economics problem here about supply and demand schedules. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question gives me supply and demand schedules. The variables are quantity demanded, price, quantity supplied, and so on. The task is to find the equilibrium price and determine whether there would be a surplus or shortage if the price were set at $4.00. Then, I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I need to understand what supply and demand schedules are. From what I remember, the supply schedule shows how much of a good or service suppliers are willing to produce at various prices. The demand schedule shows how much consumers are willing to buy at various prices. Equilibrium is where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, meaning the market is balanced.

Looking at the data, it's presented in two parts. The first part lists the quantities and prices for both supply and demand. The second part repeats the same list but with different numbers. Hmm, perhaps it's a typo? Wait, no, maybe it's just a continuation. Let me list out all the data to get it clear.

For the first part:

Quantity Demanded | Price | Quantity Supplied
--- | --- | ---
3000 | $4.00 | 1200
2800 | $4.05 | 1600
2500 | $4.10 | 1900
2100 | $4.15 | 2100
2000 | $4.20 | 2450
1700 | $4.25 | 2900

Wait, perhaps in the second part, it's a continuation of the first? Maybe the second part is just the same data but with different numbers. Let me check the second part:

Quantity Demanded | Price | Quantity Supplied
--- | --- | ---
3000 | $4.00 | 1200
2800 | $4.05 | 1600
2500 | $4.10 | 1900
2100 | $4.15 | 2100
2000 | $4.20 | 2450
1700 | $4.25 | 2900

Wait, that's the same as the first part. Hmm. Maybe I'm misreading. Alternatively, perhaps the second part is a continuation but the numbers are different. Or perhaps the question has a typo, but I'll proceed as if the data is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the second part is a continuation but the numbers are different, but let me look for another approach.

So the data has four columns: quantity demanded, price, quantity supplied. I think the first set is the initial data, and the second part is a continuation. Let me list all the data:

First part:

3000 at $4.00, quantity demanded is 3000, quantity supplied is 1200.

2800 at $4.05, quantity d=2800, s=1600.

2500 at $4.10, d=2500, s=1900.

2100 at $4.15, d=2100, s=2100.

2000 at $4.20, d=2000, s=2450.

1700 at $4.25, d=1700, s=2900.

Wait, in the second part, the data is:

3000 at $4.00, d=3000, s=1200.

2800 at $4.05, d=2800, s=1600.

Wait, that can't be right because in the first part, at $4.05, quantity supplied is 1600, but in the second part, same price has 1600? Or maybe I have to see all the data.

Wait, perhaps the second part is a mistake, but let's assume that each price has two quantities. Alternatively, perhaps the second part is a continuation but with different numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the second part is a continuation but with different values. Alternatively, perhaps the data is the same, but the problem is presented twice. That seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the data.

Alternatively, maybe the data is correct as presented, so perhaps the second part is a continuation of the first, but with different numbers. Wait, perhaps in the second part, the quantities are different. Let me look again.

Wait, the second part's first three lines are:

3000 | $4.00 | 1200

2800 | $4.05 | 1600

2500 | $4.10 | 1900

Wait, that's the same as the first part. So perhaps the second part is just a typo and perhaps in reality, the data is the same. Alternatively, perhaps the second part is the same data in a different order. But regardless, perhaps the key is to create a combined table up to a certain point.

But perhaps the data is as presented, so let me compile all the data:

Price | Quantity D | Quantity S
--- | --- | ---
4.00 | 3000 | 1200
4.05 | 2800 | 1600
4.10 | 2500 | 1900
4.15 | 2100 | 2100
4.20 | 2000 | 2450
4.25 | 1700 | 2900

Wait, but the second part in the question doesn't have more data. So perhaps the data is up to 4.25? So the data is from 4.00 up to 4.25.

Now, for part a) I need to find the equilibrium price. Equilibrium is where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded. So I need to look for a price where the two quantities are equal.

Looking through the data:

At 4.00: D=3000, S=1200 → 3000≠1200.

At 4.05: D=2800, S=1600 → not equal.

At 4.10: D=2500, S=1900 → no.

At 4.15: D=2100, S=2100 → Oh, that's the same. So equilibrium is at 4.15.

So part a) answer is 4.15.

Part b) Determine whether there would be a surplus or shortage if the price were set at $4.00.

Wait, I think I need to calculate the surplus or shortage at a given price. Surplus occurs when quantity supplied is higher than quantity demanded, leading to unsold inventory. Shortage is when quantity demanded is higher than quantity supplied.

So, at 4.00, quantity demanded is 3000, quantity supplied is 1200. So D > S. That means there's a shortage.

Wait, but wait—so if the price is set at 4.00, and current price is 4.00, then at that price, demand is 3000, supply is 1200. So, if the price is set at 4.00, how much is the market? The market is at 4.00, and at that price, demand is 3k, supply 1.2k. So the difference is 3k-1.2k=1.8k shortage.

Wait, but wait. Wait—it's possible that the question isn't about a hypothetical price but about the equilibrium. Wait, no, the question says in part b: "If price were set at $4.00, would there be a surplus or shortage?" So, the equilibrium is at 4.15, but part b is asking what happens at 4.00.

So, at 4.00, demand is 3000, supply is 1200. So D is higher than S. So, the market would have a shortage.

Wait, no. Wait, if the price is fixed at 4.00, then the quantity demanded is 3000, quantity supplied is 1200. So the market is at 4.00, and the demand exceeds the supply. So, the market will have a shortage because the quantity demanded (3k) is higher than the quantity supplied (1.2k). So, the market is short by 1.8k units.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because option A says surplus of 300, but in this case, the demand is higher. So, surplus would be when supply exceeds demand. Here, the demand is higher, so it's a shortage.

So, at 4.00, there would be a shortage.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: $4.15, surplus of 300 units.

Option B: $4.20, shortage of 1200 units.

Wait, but the equilibrium is 4.15. So, at 4.00, the quantity demanded is 3k, supply is 1.2k. So, the market has a shortage.

So, in that case, the answer would be a shortage.

Looking at the options, option B says shortage of 1200, but according to my calculation, the shortage is 1800 units.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me do that calculation again.

At 4.00: D=3000, S=1200.

So, the difference is 3000 -1200 = 1800. So, a shortage of 1800.

But option B says 1200. Option H says 4.00, shortage of 1200.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the initial data:

At 4.00: D=3000, S=1200.

So, D - S = 1800. So a shortage of 1800.

But the options don't have a 1800 shortage at 4.00. Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: 4.20, shortage of 1200.

Option H: 4.00, shortage of 1200.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, maybe I misread the data. Let me see:

Wait, the first part:

3000 at 4.00, 1200 supply.

2800 at 4.05, 1600 supply.

2500 at 4.10, 1900 supply.

2100 at 4.15, 2100 supply.

2000 at 4.20, 2450 supply.

1700 at 4.25, 2900 supply.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial data. Wait, at 4.00, D is 3000, S is 1200. So, D - S = 1800. So, shortage of 1800. But in the options, the 'shortage of 1800' is not present. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4.15, surplus 300.

Option B: 4.20, shortage 1200.

Option C: 4.15, shortage 1800.

Option D: 4.00, surplus 1800.

Option E:4.10, surplus 300.

Option F:4.10, equilibrium.

Option G:4.00, equilibrium.

Option H:4.00, shortage of 1200.

Option I:4.20, surplus 450.

Option J:4.25, surplus 1000.

Wait, so none of the options have 4.00, 4.15, and 1800. Wait, perhaps in the options, I have to choose another option.

Wait, option C says 4.15, shortage of 1800. So, according to our calculation, at 4.00, there's a shortage of 1800. But option C says 4.15, which is the equilibrium, and 1800 shortage.

Wait, but the question part b) is about setting the price at 4.00, not about the equilibrium.

Hmm. So, the correct answer for part a) is 4.15, and part b) is a shortage of 1800 units.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is 4.15, shortage of 1800. So that would be the correct pair.

But wait, why is option C present? Because the problem asks for both a) and b) in the same options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial data.

Wait, looking at option H and others.

Wait, another approach: for each price, does the quantity supplied equal the demand?

At 4.00: 3000 vs 1200. Not equal.

At 4.05: 2800 vs 1600. Not equal.

At 4.10: 2500 vs 1900. No.

At 4.15: 2100 vs 2100 → yes, equilibrium.

At 4.20: 2000 vs 2450 → No.

At 4.25: 1700 vs 2900 → No.

So only 4.15 is the equilibrium.

So, part a) is 4.15.

Now, for part b), at 4.00, demand is 3000, supply is 1200. So D > S→ shortage.

So, the answer would be a shortage of (3000-1200) = 1800.

Looking back at the options, the only option with 4.15 and 1800 is option C.

Wait, but option C says: 4.15, shortage of 1800 units. That's correct.

But wait, the options given don't have all possible combinations. So, the correct pair is a) 4.15 and b) shortage of 1800.

Looking at the options, option C is 4.15, shortage of 1800.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the supply and demand schedules provided:

### Part (a): Finding the Equilibrium Price
The equilibrium price is where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. By comparing the quantities at each price level:

- At $4.00: Quantity demanded = 3000, Quantity supplied = 1200 → Not equal.
- At $4.05: Quantity demanded = 2800, Quantity supplied = 1600 → Not equal.
- At $4.10: Quantity demanded = 2500, Quantity supplied = 1900 → Not equal.
- At $4.15: Quantity demanded = 2100, Quantity supplied = 2100 → Equal.

Thus, the equilibrium price is **$4.15**.

---

### Part (b): Determining Surplus or Shortage if Price is Set at $4.00
At a price of $4.00:
- Quantity demanded = 3000.
- Quantity supplied = 1200.

Since the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied (3000 > 1200), there is a **shortage**. The size of the shortage is:

\[ \text{Shortage} = \text{Quantity demanded} - \text{Quantity supplied} = 3000 - 1200 = 1800 \text{ units} \]

---

### Matching the Results with Options
- **Part (a)**: Equilibrium price = $4.15.
- **Part (b)**: Shortage at $4.00 = 1800 units.

Looking at the options:
- **Option C**: $4.15, shortage of 1800 units.

This matches both parts of the question.
