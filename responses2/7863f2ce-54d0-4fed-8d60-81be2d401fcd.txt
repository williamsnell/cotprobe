Okay, so I've got this problem here about a bin with some balls and expected value. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on probability, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says there are 5 green balls and k purple balls in the bin. The player wins $2 if they draw a green ball and loses $2 if they draw a purple one. The expected amount won is 50 cents, which is $0.50. I need to find what k is.

First, I remember that expected value is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing them up. So the expected value (E) here should be the probability of drawing a green ball times $2 plus the probability of drawing a purple ball times (-$2), since losing $2 is a negative outcome.

Wait, let me write that down to make it clearer. The expected value E is:

E = (Probability of green * $2) + (Probability of purple * (-$2))

We know that the expected value is $0.50. So,

0.5 = (P_green * 2) + (P_purple * (-2))

Now, what's the probability of drawing a green ball? There are 5 green balls and k purple balls, so total balls = 5 + k.

So P_green = 5 / (5 + k)
P_purple = k / (5 + k)

Substituting these into the expected value equation:

0.5 = [ (5/(5+k)) * 2 ] + [ (k/(5+k)) * (-2) ]

Let me compute each term. 

The first term is (5/(5+k)) * 2 = 10/(5+k)
The second term is (k/(5+k))*(-2) = -2k/(5+k)

So putting it together:

0.5 = [10/(5+k)] - [2k/(5+k)]

Since both terms have the same denominator, I can combine them:

0.5 = [10 - 2k] / (5 + k)

Now, I can write this as:

0.5 = (10 - 2k) / (5 + k)

To solve for k, I'll cross-multiply. Multiply both sides by (5 + k):

0.5*(5 + k) = 10 - 2k

Let's compute the left side: 0.5*5 is 2.5, and 0.5*k is 0.5k. So,

2.5 + 0.5k = 10 - 2k

Now, I'll get all terms involving k on one side and constants on the other. Let's add 2k to both sides and subtract 2.5 from both sides:

0.5k + 2k = 10 - 2.5

Wait, no. Let's go step by step. 

Starting again:

2.5 + 0.5k = 10 - 2k

Let's add 2k to both sides:

2.5 + 0.5k + 2k = 10

Combine terms: 2.5 + (0.5k + 2k) = 2.5 + 2.5k = 10

So, 2.5 + 2.5k = 10

Subtract 2.5 from both sides:

2.5k = 7.5

Divide both sides by 2.5:

k = 7.5 / 2.5 = 3

Wait, 7.5 divided by 2.5 is indeed 3. So k equals 3.

Let me check the options. The options are:

A:5, B:7, C:12, D:3, E:10, F:4, G:9, H:2, I:6, J:8.

So D is 3. That's the answer. Let me just verify if this makes sense.

If k is 3, then total balls are 5 +3=8.

Probability of green: 5/8, so 5/8 *2 = 10/8 = 1.25
Probability of purple: 3/8, so 3/8*(-2)= -6/8 = -0.75
Adding them: 1.25 - 0.75 = 0.5, which matches the expected value given. So yes, k=3 is correct.
</think>

To determine the value of \( k \), we calculate the expected value \( E \) using the probabilities of drawing a green or purple ball. The expected value formula is:

\[
E = (P_{\text{green}} \times 2) + (P_{\text{purple}} \times (-2))
\]

Given \( P_{\text{green}} = \frac{5}{5 + k} \) and \( P_{\text{purple}} = \frac{k}{5 + k} \), substituting these into the equation:

\[
0.5 = \left( \frac{5}{5 + k} \times 2 \right) + \left( \frac{k}{5 + k} \times (-2) \right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
0.5 = \frac{10 - 2k}{5 + k}
\]

Cross-multiplying:

\[
0.5 \times (5 + k) = 10 - 2k
\]

\[
2.5 + 0.5k = 10 - 2k
\]

Solving for \( k \):

\[
2.5k = 7.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 3
\]
