Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. The question is about why someone loses the ability to understand language. The options are various lobes of the brain. 

First, I remember that the brain has multiple lobes, each responsible for different functions. The left and right hemispheres are connected, so understanding a language probably involves both hemispheres working together. 

Language processing starts in the brain's parietal lobe, specifically the left and right parietal regions. These areas are involved in processing visual information, which is crucial for understanding language. 

Looking at the options, the parietal lobes are options E (left parietal), F (right temporal), G (right parietal), and the frontal lobes are options H and J. The frontal lobes are more involved in executive functions like language comprehension, problem-solving, and decision-making. They might handle the language-related tasks, but if both are involved, that's a bit tricky.

Wait, but the question is about the 'loss of the ability to understand language' resulting from loss of tissue in which lobe. So, if the left frontal lobe is involved in language, then the loss would affect that. Or perhaps the parietal lobes are more directly involved in the actual processing of language.

I think the parietal lobes are crucial for the visual aspects of language. So, if the person's parietal lobes are damaged, maybe they can't process the visual words or the language properly. But then, the question is about the lobes involved in language, not just processing.

Wait, but some of the options include both left and right. For example, option C is both frontal lobes. But the frontal lobes are more about executive functions, so perhaps the answer isn't both. 

Another thought: the left and right parietal lobes might be involved in language. So, if a person has a loss in the parietal lobes, both left and right would be affected. But looking at the options, option C is both frontal, which I think is more about the executive part, not the language processing itself.

Wait, but the question might be about the left or right. Let me think again. The parietal lobes are more directly involved in language processing. So if the parietal lobes are damaged, the person can't understand language. So, the options are E, F, G, or I.

Looking at the options, E is left parietal, F is right temporal, G is right parietal, I is both parietal. So E and G are parietal, I is two parietals.

But which one is more involved in language. I'm not sure, but maybe the parietal lobes are more directly involved. However, the question says 'loss of tissue in which of the following lobes.' So, perhaps both parietal lobes are involved, but I'm not certain if that's the primary one.

Wait, another approach: I remember that the parietal lobe is involved in the processing of language. So, if the parietal lobes are damaged, the person can't understand language. So the answer would be either E, G, or I.

But the options are E (left parietal), G (right parietal), and I (both parietal). So, I think the correct answer is either E or G, but since the question is about the ' lobes,' perhaps the answer is both parietal, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, the question might be referring to the left or right parietal lobe. Maybe the left parietal affects the right hemisphere's language processing. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the parietal lobes are involved in both the prefrontal and the left and right temporal lobes, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the question is about the 'ability to understand language' resulting from a loss of tissue in which lobe. So the lobe is involved in the processing of language, which is a visual process. The left and right parietal lobes are involved in processing visual information, which is essential for language.

So the correct answer would be either E (left parietal), G (right parietal), or I (both parietal). But in the options, I (both) is an option. However, I thought the parietal lobes are more involved in the visual aspects, so maybe the answer is the left or right parietal.

Wait, but the question uses the word 'lobes,' so perhaps the correct answer is E (left parietal) or G (right parietal). But if both are involved, then I (both) is correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the parietal lobe is more involved in the language processing than the temporal. So, if the parietal lobes are damaged, the person can't process language. So, options E or G.

But among the options, I don't see an option that combines left and right. So, perhaps the correct answer is E (left parietal) or G (right parietal), but the question is in the options, so perhaps the correct answer is E or G.

Wait, no, the options are listed, so let's reevaluate. The question is asking which lobe's loss would result in the inability to understand language. The parietal lobes are more involved in the visual aspects, so probably the correct answer is the left or right parietal.

Looking back at the options, option E is left parietal, and G is right parietal. So, the question is giving four options, including both of these. But since the answer needs to be one letter, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another way to think: the parietal lobe is often called the 'visual prefrontal' and is involved in both the recognition of letters and words (temporal) and the actual language processing (frontal). But the question is about the inability to understand language, which might primarily involve the parietal lobe.

So, considering the options, the correct answer is E (left parietal) or G (right parietal). Since the question includes both as options, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the correct answer is the left parietal because the parietal lobe is more directly involved in language processing.

Alternatively, perhaps the temporal lobe is involved in speech processing, but that's more about the left temporal lobe, which is option F. But F is right temporal, which I don't think is as directly involved in language as the parietal.

Wait, but the question is about the inability to understand language, which is a visual task. So the parietal lobes are more involved in that.

So, the options are E, G, I. If the correct answer is E, then the answer is option E. If it's G, then option G. If it's I, then both.

But the question says, 'loss of tissue in which of the following lobes,' implying that the entire lobe is damaged. So, if the left parietal is damaged, the person can't process language. So, option E.

Alternatively, if the right parietal is damaged, then the answer would be G. But I'm not sure which one is more involved.

Wait, but the question is about the 'ability' to understand language, which is a complex process involving multiple lobes. I think the parietal lobes are more directly involved in language processing, so perhaps option E is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the parietal lobe is involved in the prefrontal, so it's more about the executive functions of language comprehension. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the parietal lobe is the left and right parietal, and these are involved in both the recognition of letters and words (temporal) and the actual processing of language (frontal). So, perhaps the parietal lobes are more involved in the language processing part.

So, the correct answer would be E (left parietal) or G (right parietal). But since the options have E and G as separate options, and I is the option of both, perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, but the question is about the 'ability' to understand language. So, perhaps the parietal lobe is more directly involved, so the answer is E.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is both parietal lobes (I), but I'm not confident.

Wait, another way to think: the parietal lobe is involved in the visual processing, which is essential for language. So, if the parietal lobe is damaged, the person can't process language. So, the options E and G are both involved, but perhaps the correct answer is E.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating. The question is about the 'ability' to understand language, which is more about the parietal lobe's role in visual processing, which is directly involved.

So, I think the correct answer is E, left parietal.

The question asks which lobe's loss would result in the inability to understand language. Language processing involves several lobes, but the parietal lobes are particularly important. They are involved in visual information processing, which is crucial for understanding language. Specifically, the left and right parietal lobes are directly responsible for recognizing and understanding visual elements, such as letters and words. 

Among the options provided, the left parietal lobe (option E) is directly involved in this process. While the right parietal lobe (option G) is also important, the question asks for a single answer, and the left parietal is more directly linked to the processing of language. Therefore, the correct answer is the left parietal lobe.

Answer: E
