Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Patricia is starting her new job with a salary of $20,000. The question is about how her salary changes over two years with annual increases of 10% each year, but each time 10% is added to the previous year's salary.

First, let's break down what each year's salary would be. 

In the first year, her salary increases by 10%. So, I need to calculate 10% of $20,000 and add that to the original salary. 

10% of 20,000 is calculated as 0.10 * 20,000 = $2,000. So, after the first year, her salary becomes 20,000 + 2,000 = $22,000.

Now, moving on to the second year. The increase this year is 10% of the previous year's salary, which is $22,000. Let's calculate 10% of 22,000. That's 0.10 * 22,000 = $2,200. So, adding that to the previous year's salary, her new salary becomes 22,000 + 2,200 = $24,200.

Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Sometimes percentage increases can be a bit tricky because each year's increase is based on the new salary, not the original. So, in the first year, 10% of 20k is 2k, making it 22k. Second year, 10% of 22k is 2.2k, so 22k +2.2k =24.2k, which is $24,200.

Looking at the options, option D is $24,200. So that should be the correct answer. I think I'm confident now.

The correct answer is D: $24,200.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **First Year Increase:**
   - Starting salary: $20,000.
   - 10% increase: 0.10 * 20,000 = $2,000.
   - New salary after first year: 20,000 + 2,000 = $22,000.

2. **Second Year Increase:**
   - Salary at the start of the second year: $22,000.
   - 10% increase: 0.10 * 22,000 = $2,200.
   - New salary after second year: 22,000 + 2,200 = $24,200.

**Answer:** D: $24,200.
