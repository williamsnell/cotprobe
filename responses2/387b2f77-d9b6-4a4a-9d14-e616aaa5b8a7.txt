In his answer, the defendant set forth that the ice formed overnight and that the plaintiff fell before the defendant had a chance to remove it. During the trial, a physician, whose office was next door to the defendant's home, testified that he saw the plaintiff fall and that the ice, which had been there for several days was at least two inches thick. On cross-examination, counsel for the defendant asked the physician the following question: "During your treatment of the plaintiff on the day in question, is it not true that he told you his fall resulted from a loss of equilibrium after he suffered from dizziness?"Upon objection by the plaintiff's attorney, the physician's testimony will be ruled

Options:

A: inadmissible, because it is hearsay evidence.
B: admissible, because the physician had personal knowledge of the plaintiff's injuries.
C: admissible, because it provides additional information about the plaintiff's condition.
D: admissible, because it sheds light on the plaintiff's physical condition at the time of the fall.
E: inadmissible, because the physician's testimony is not relevant to prove that the plaintiff's alleged injuries are false or exaggerated.
F: inadmissible, because the physician's testimony is biased.
G: inadmissible, because the defendant's counsel failed to lay a proper foundation.
H: inadmissible, because it contradicts the defendant's statement.
I: admissible, because it is reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.
J: admissible, because it helps to establish the timeline of events.

Alright, let's tackle this law question step by step. Okay, so here's the situation: A plantiff is suing a defendant for injuries after a fall on the sidewalk of the defendant's home. The plaintiff's complaint says that the sidewalk was covered by a thick sheet of ice left by the defendant, which was negligently done for several days. 

In the answer, the defendant says the ice was there overnight, and the plaintiff fell before the defendant had a chance to remove it. Then, during the trial, a physician from the plaintiff's office next door testified that he saw the plaintiff fall and that the ice was at least two inches thick. 

Counsel for the defendant asked the physician during cross-examination: "During your treatment of the plaintiff on the day in question, is it not true that he told you his fall resulted from a loss of equilibrium after he suffered from dizziness?" The plaintiff's attorney object, and the question is whether the physician's testimony is inadmissible.

Hmm, so I need to figure out if the physician's statement is admissible. Let's break it down. The key here is whether the statement is hearsay. Hearsay is when someone else's statement is used as evidence, and it needs to be supported by truth or fact, not assumed. 

The defendant's statement is that the ice was there overnight and the plaintiff fell before it was removed. The plaintiff's attorney is objecting to the physician's testimony about the fall and his dizziness.

Wait, the problem is whether the physician's statement is hearsay. The defendant's statement is about the ice being there, but the issue is whether the plaintiff's attorney is using the physician's testimony as hearsay. 

So, the plaintiff's attorney is cross-examining the physician. The question is whether the physician's statement is hearsay. If the statement is hearsay, it would be inadmissible. But if it's not, then it's admissible.

But wait, the defendant's attorney has previously stated that the ice was there overnight and the plaintiff fell before removal. The defendant's attorney is providing prior knowledge. If the defendant's attorney is offering prior knowledge, then the plaintiff's attorney can't use the defendant's attorney's statement as hearsay. 

In this case, the defendant's attorney (the one who testified) is providing information about the ice and the plaintiff's fall. The defendant's statement was that the ice was there overnight. The plaintiff's attorney is cross-examining the same day's event. 

So, the issue isn't about whether the defendant's prior statement is hearsay, but whether the plaintiff's attorney is using the defendant's prior statement as hearsay. But from the analysis, the defense's prior statement is not hearsay because it's about the ice and the plaintiff's fall, which the defendant would have already explained. 

Wait, but the question is about the plaintiff's attorney's testimony. The question is whether the defendant's prior statement is hearsay and if the defendant's prior statement is admissible. The defendant's prior statement is that the ice was there overnight, which is not hearsay because it's just describing the state of the facts. So the defendant's prior statement doesn't need to be in the answer. 

In the cross-examination, the plaintiff's attorney is objecting to the physician's statement. If the physician's statement is hearsay, then it's inadmissible. But if the statement is not hearsay, it's admissible. So I need to determine whether the statement is hearsay.

Hearsay is a statement offered as evidence that is not supported by facts and is not impliedly true. The statement here is "healed from a loss of equilibrium after suffering from dizziness." So that's a statement about the cause of the plaintiff's fall.

Is that hearsay? Well, if it's a statement offered by a third party (the physician) about the plaintiff's injuries, and it's not supported by any facts or previous statements, then it's hearsay. 

But the issue is whether the statement is admissible to clarify the timeline or establish the physical condition. Alternatively, if it's a statement that the defendant has already given, it might be admissible to provide prior knowledge.

Wait, the defendant's prior statement is that the ice was there overnight. The defendant's attorney is offering that, and the plaintiff's attorney is cross-examining the same day's events. So the defendant's prior statement is not being offered as evidence but as a statement about the facts, not as evidence. Therefore, the plaintiff's attorney can't use it as hearsay.

So the statement by the physician is not hearsay because it's a statement offered to clarify the facts or establish the timeline, not to be used as evidence. Therefore, it's admissible. 

Looking at the options, option I says it's admissible because it's reasonably pertinent. Option H says it's inadmissible because it contradicts the defendant's statement. But wait, the defendant's statement was about the ice being there overnight, and the plaintiff fell before removal. The defendant's statement is that the ice was there overnight and the plaintiff fell before removal. The plaintiff's attorney is cross-examining the day when the fall happened, and the statement by the physician is about the fall and his dizziness.

So the physician's statement is about the fall, not the ice or the removal. So it's not directly supporting the defense's prior statement about the ice. Therefore, the statement is not hearsay because it's not being offered as evidence but as a statement about the facts, not as evidence of the defense's prior statement.

Wait, so the defense's prior statement about the ice is not hearsay because it's not being offered as evidence. The statement by the physician is a separate statement, so if it's offered by the defendant's attorney, it's not hearsay. Therefore, the statement is admissible.

So looking at the options, option I says it's admissible because it's reasonably pertinent. Option H says it's inadmissible because it contradicts the defendant's statement. But the defense's prior statement was about the ice being there overnight, and the plaintiff's attorney is cross-examining the day's events, so the defense's prior statement isn't directly related to the fall. Therefore, the physician's statement isn't contradicting the defense's prior statement but rather relates to the same day's events.

So the answer is that the statement is admissible because it's providing additional information about the plaintiff's condition at the time of the fall. Alternatively, it's relevant to establish the timeline or to clarify the facts.

Wait, but the options given are that the statement is admissible because it's reasonable. So the correct answer is option I: admissible because it is reasonably pertinent.

The question revolves around whether the plaintiff's attorney's statement in cross-examination is admissible. The key issue is whether the statement is hearsay and whether it is admissible in the context of the case.

1. **Hearsay Consideration**: Hearsay is a statement offered as evidence that is not supported by facts and is not impliedly true. The statement "healed from a loss of equilibrium after suffering from dizziness" is offered by the physician to clarify the plaintiff's injuries. Since it is not offered to be used as evidence but rather to clarify the facts or establish the timeline, it is not hearsay.

2. **Context of Cross-Examination**: The defendant's attorney previously stated that the ice was there overnight, and the plaintiff fell before removal. The defendant's statement is not being offered as evidence but as a prior statement. The plaintiff's attorney is cross-examining the day in question and is using the prior statement to establish the context of the fall.

3. **Relevance and Puzzling Nature**: The statement appears puzzling because it appears to contradict the defense's prior statement. However, this contradiction does not render the statement inadmissible. Instead, it is admissible to clarify the timeline or establish the facts that the fall occurred before the removal of the ice.

4. **Analysis of Options**: 
   - **Option A (Inadmissible, hearsay)**: Incorrect, as the statement is not hearsay because it is not offered to be used as evidence.
   - **Option B (Admissible, personal knowledge)**: Incorrect, as the statement does not rely on personal knowledge.
   - **Option C (Admissible, additional information)**: Incorrect, as the statement is not additional information but clarifies the facts.
   - **Option D (Admissible, physical condition)**: Incorrect, because the statement does not relate to the plaintiff's physical condition at the time of the fall.
   - **Option E (Inadmissible, relevance)**: Incorrect, as the statement is relevant to the case.
   - **Option F (Inadmissible, bias)**: Incorrect, as the statement does not show bias.
   - **Option G (Inadmissible, foundation failed)**: Incorrect, as there is a foundation for the statement.
   - **Option H (Inadmissible, contradicts)**: Incorrect, as the contradiction does not make the statement inadmissible.
   - **Option I (Admissible, reasonably pertinent)**: Correct, as the statement is reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.

The correct answer is that the statement is admissible because it is reasonably pertinent to the case.

**ANSWER: I**
