Okay, let's see. I've got this question about calculating the interest Paul paid on his loan. Hmm. So, the loan amount is $1,285, the time it's been for is 2 and a half years, which is 2.5 years, and the interest rate is 5 and a half percent, or 5.5%. I need to find out how much interest he paid.

Wait, wait. I think this is a simple interest problem because it doesn't mention anything about compounding. I remember the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where P is principal, R is rate, and T is time.

Let me plug in the numbers. P is $1,285. R is 5.5%, which I should convert to a decimal. So, 5.5% is 0.055. T is 2.5 years. 

So, calculating I: 1285 * 0.055 * 2.5. Let's compute that step by step. First, 1285 * 0.055. Hmm, 1285 times 0.05 is 64.25, and 1285 times 0.005 is 6.425. Adding those together gives 64.25 + 6.425 = 70.675. So that's 70.675 per year? Wait no, wait. Wait, no, 0.055 is the rate, so 1285 * 0.055 is 70.675. Then multiply that by 2.5 for the time. 

Wait, 70.675 * 2.5. Let me compute that. 70 * 2.5 is 175, and 0.675 * 2.5 is 1.6875. So adding those gives 175 + 1.6875 = 176.6875. So approximately $176.69.

Looking back at the options, option B is $176.69. So the answer should be B.

The interest paid is calculated using simple interest formula \( I = P \cdot R \cdot T \). Plugging in the values: \( I = 1285 \cdot 0.055 \cdot 2.5 = 176.69 \). 

Answer: B
