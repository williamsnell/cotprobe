Options:

A: Inherent risk and control risk can be completely eliminated.
B: Inherent risk and control risk exist as a result of the auditorâ€™s judgment about materiality.
C: Detection risk is a result of the auditor's judgment while inherent risk and control risk are not.
D: Inherent risk and control risk are the result of the client's internal control system.
E: Inherent risk and control risk exist independently of the audit.
F: Inherent risk and control risk are eliminated through the audit process.
G: Inherent risk and control risk are controlled by the auditor.
H: Inherent risk and control risk are solely determined by the audit.
I: Detection risk is controlled by the client while inherent risk and control risk are not.
J: Inherent risk and control risk are calculated by the client.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about auditing terms, specifically about inherent risk, control risk, and detection risk. I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through each term and how they relate.

First, I remember that in auditing, there are several key risks. Detection risk is about the likelihood that material misstatements are detected during the audit. Then there's Control Risk, which is the risk that the auditor believes that the entity's internal controls are insufficiently effective or are entirely ineffective. Inherent Risk, I think that refers to the risk that the entity cannot be detected because of its internal controls. Wait, maybe I got that a bit mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps it's the risk that the entity's controls are not strong enough, so when an audit is done, they can't find any material issues.

Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's break it down. The question is asking how inherently related these risks are to detection risk.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Inherent and control risk can be eliminated. That doesn't seem right. I remember that in audits, there are always some risks. The auditor can't eliminate all risks, even if they think they've done their job well. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Inherent and control risk are due to judgment. I think inherent risk is about the entity's own controls, so maybe not entirely due to judgment. Control risk is about the effectiveness of the controls, which might involve judgment in evaluating their strength. But I'm not sure if they're both entirely due to judgment. Maybe B is wrong, but I'm not certain yet.

Option C: Detection is judgment, others are not. That makes sense. Detection risk is about the auditor's assessment of the likelihood of material misstatements. I believe detection is a judgment-based risk because the auditor has to decide if a material misstatement is likely. Inherent and control risk are not about detection, they're about the entity's own controls and their effectiveness. So C seems correct, but I should check other options.

Option D: Inherent and control risk are client's internal controls. No, I think inherent risk is about the entity's controls, not the client's. Control risk is about the auditor's assessment of control effectiveness, not the client's role. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Inherent and control risks are eliminated. I don't think that's right. Auditing always has risks, and eliminating them isn't possible. So E is wrong.

Option F: Inherent and control risks are eliminated through audit. No, same reasoning as A. Audit can't eliminate all risks. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Inherent and control are controlled by the auditor. That seems right. Inherent risk is about the entity's controls not being effective, which the auditor would assess. Control risk is about the effectiveness of the controls, which the auditor would also assess. So G is correct.

Option H: Inherent and control are solely determined by audit. I think that's not accurate. I believe inherent risk is based on the entity's internal controls and their strength, which might be known from documentation. Control risk is about the auditor evaluating the controls, so it's subjective. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Detection risk is controlled by client. Wait, no. Detection is about the auditor's assessment, so it's their responsibility, not the client's. I remember that the client is responsible for the audit objectives, and the auditor is responsible for risk assessment. So I think I is incorrect.

Option J: Inherent and control are calculated by client. Definitely wrong. These are assessed by the auditor, not calculated by the client. So J is incorrect.

So reviewing the options, the correct answer should be C and G.

Wait, let me clarify. The question is: "Inherent risk and control risk differ from detection risk in which of the following ways?"

Hmm. So the question is about the differences between these three risks. So which of these are about detection, and which are about inherent and control.

Wait, maybe the question is asking how inherent and control risk relate to detection risk. The options are about the nature of these risks.

Wait, the question is phrased as: "Inherent risk and control risk differ from detection risk in which way?"

So the correct answer is about the relationship between these. Let's think again.

Inherent risk is about the entity's own controls, so it's about the controls, not the auditor's judgment. Control risk is about whether the controls are effective, so it's also about judgment. Detection risk is the risk that the auditor will detect material misstatements during the audit.

So the options are about whether detection is a result of judgment, and whether inherent and control are due to judgment.

Wait, option C says: Detection risk is a result of the auditor's judgment while inherent risk and control risk are not.

Is that correct? I think yes. Because detection risk is about the auditor's assessment of the likelihood of material misstatements. That's judgment-based.

Inherent risk is the risk that the entity cannot be detected because of its controls. So, the entity's controls are ineffective, which the auditor would assess. So the inherent risk is about the entity, not the judgment.

Similarly, control risk is about the effectiveness of the entity's controls, which is also assessed by the auditor, so control risk isn't due to judgment.

So option C is correct. So the correct answer is C.
</think>

The correct answer is C: Detection risk is a result of the auditor's judgment while inherent risk and control risk are not.

**Explanation:**
- **Detection Risk (Option C):** This is the risk that the auditor will detect material misstatements during the audit. It is inherently judgment-based because the auditor assesses the likelihood of material misstatements.
- **Inherent Risk (Option G):** This refers to the risk that the entity's internal controls are insufficiently effective or are entirely ineffective. It is assessed by the auditor, not by the judgment of the client.
- **Control Risk (Option G):** This is the risk that the entity's controls are not effective. It is also assessed by the auditor, not by the judgment of the client.

Thus, while detection risk is influenced by the auditor's judgment, inherent and control risks are evaluated by the auditor themselves, not by the client's judgment or internal control effectiveness.
