Question:

The police were called to a domestic dispute. The wife told police that her husband was abusive and that he was a heavy cocaine user. The husband was present and denied the allegation. Police asked for permission to search the premises for drugs, which was consented to by the wife. The husband, however, refused to consent to the search. The police went ahead anyway and found drugs in the husband's belongings. After being arrested on drug charges, the husband filed a motion for suppression of the evidence based on lack of consent. What should be the likely decision of the trial court?

Options:

A: The search was valid because the husband's denial of the allegations was not credible.
B: The search was invalid because the wife was not authorized to give consent to search her husband's personal belongings.
C: The search was invalid because the police did not have a search warrant, which is required regardless of consent.
D: The search was invalid and the evidence must be suppressed because the co-occupant of the premises was present and specifically refused to give consent to the search.
E: The search was valid because the cases say that one occupant's consent to the search overrules the other occupant's refusal to consent.
F: The search was valid because the wife's statement established probable cause that a crime was being committed  this created exigent circumstances for the search.
G: The search was valid because the wife's consent was sufficient to search the common areas of the home.
H: The search was invalid because the consent to search was not voluntary, as it was given out of fear of domestic violence.
I: The search was valid because the drugs were in plain view when the police entered the premises.
J: The search was invalid because, even though consent was given, the police must first attempt to get a search warrant to enter a home.

Okay, let's try to figure out this question. So, the question is about a domestic dispute where the police called in and did a drug search. I remember that when a police officer is dealing with a domestic situation, they have specific rules about drug searches. 

The situation is that the wife says her husband is abusive and a heavy user of cocaine. The husband was present and denied the allegations. The police wanted to search the premises for drugs and were given consent by the wife. But the husband refused to consent. Then, they went ahead and found drugs in the husband's belongings. The husband was arrested on drug charges and filed a motion for suppression because he didn't consent.

The trial court needs to decide what the outcome is. Let's look at the options.

Option A says the search was valid because the husband's denial wasn't credible. Probably not right because the husband's denial might be believable. The fact that he refused consent is a problem regardless.

Option B says the search was invalid because the wife wasn't allowed to consent. That makes sense. The police have a duty to get consent from the owner or the person in possession. If the owner (the wife) gave consent, the search should be valid. But if she didn't, it might be invalid.

Option C suggests the search was invalid because no search warrant was required. No, that's not correct. Even if someone isn't in custody, the police still need a warrant. So C is incorrect.

Option D says the evidence must be suppressed because the co-occupant refused consent. Wait, the husband was the co-occupant here. So D makes sense because the husband refused, so the search is based on his refusal, which is a no-go.

Option E says the search was valid because the drugs were in plain view. I'm not sure. The drugs being in plain view might be a defense, but the primary issue is consent. So the plain view might be for a different reason, but the fact that the husband refused isn't addressed here.

Option F talks about exigent circumstances. I'm not sure how that applies here. The key issue is consent, not exigent situations.

Option G says the search was valid because the wife's consent was sufficient. But option D is more specific about the co-occupant's refusal.

Option H claims consent wasn't voluntary. Hmm, consent is usually voluntary unless it's coerced. So this doesn't seem right.

Option I says the search was valid because drugs were plain view. Again, plain view is a defense, not the main issue here.

Option J suggests that the search needed a warrant because consent was given. The general rule is that consent is required. So J is incorrect because the consent is a condition for the search, not an absolute requirement.

So the main issue is the husband's refusal. The police should argue that the consent was not given to the co-occupant who was present and refused. So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D. The police should argue that the husband's refusal to consent was a breach of the required condition for the search, making the search invalid. 

Answer: D
