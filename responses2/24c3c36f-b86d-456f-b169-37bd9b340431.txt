Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve: finding the center of mass of a uniformly solid cone. The cone has a base diameter of 2a and a height h. The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that the center of mass for a cone is a standard problem, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think. Oh right, for a solid cone, the center of mass is located along the central axis, right? So I can ignore the other dimensions and just focus on the axis.

Wait, I think the formula is somewhere like one-third of the height from the base or the apex. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes I mix up whether it's a quarter or a third. Let me visualize the cone. If it's a solid cone, the mass is distributed from the base up to the tip. So the center of mass should be closer to the base than to the tip. Which would mean it's somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 of the height.

Wait, another approach: if I imagine the cone as a stack of infinitesimally thin circular disks. Each disk has a radius that decreases linearly with height. The radius at a height y from the base is (a/h)y, because the base radius is a and the height is h. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the base diameter is 2a, so radius a. So at a height y from the base, the radius r would be (a/h)*y, because as you go up, the radius decreases proportionally.

Wait, no, actually, if you take a cross-sectional view, the radius of the disk at height y is (a/h) y. Wait, no, actually, the total height is h, so at the base, y=0, radius is a. At y=h, radius is a (since h is the height). Wait, that doesn't make sense. No, wait, if the center is at the base, then at a height y from the base, the radius would be (a/h) * y. Because when y=h, it's a, which is correct. So the radius increases as we go up, but wait, no. Wait, actually, no. Wait, when you look at a cone, if you're at the base (y=0), radius is a. As you go up, the radius increases, not decreases. So actually, the radius r(y) = (a/h) * y. Because at y=0, r=0, which can't be right. Wait, maybe I got this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should model the cone as a function of height y from the apex. So the apex is at y=0, and the base is at y=h, with radius a. Then, the radius at height y from the apex is r(y)= (a/h) * y. So for any point inside the cone at a distance y from the apex, the radius is proportional to y.

Now, to find the center of mass, we'll use integration. The center of mass y-coordinate (assuming the base is at y=h) is given by (1/M) times the integral of y times the mass element dm.

The mass element dm of an infinitesimal disk is the area times the density. The density is uniform, so let's denote it as ρ. The mass of the entire cone M is (1/3)πR²h ρ, where R is the base radius, which is a. So M=(1/3)π a² h ρ.

Wait, wait, another approach: Since the density is uniform, the mass element dm can be written as ρ * dV, where dV is the volume element. Since the cone is a solid, its volume is (1/3)πR²h. For each differential disk at height y from the apex, the radius is r(y) = (a/h)y. The volume element dV is π [r(y)]² dy. So dV = π (a²/h²) y² dy.

But wait, that depends on how I set up the coordinate system. Let me re-express this. Let's imagine that we're measuring y from the apex (the tip) up to the base. So the apex is at y=0, and the base is at y=h. The radius at any point y is r(y) = (a/h) y.

Thus, the volume of a thin disk at position y is dV = π [r(y)]² dy = π (a²/h²) y² dy. So the mass element dm is ρ dV = ρ π (a²/h²) y² dy.

Now, the center of mass y_cm is calculated as:

y_cm = (1/M) ∫ y dm from y=0 to y=h.

But M = ∫ dm from 0 to h = ∫ (ρ π a²/h² y²) dy from 0 to h.

Calculating M:
M = ρ π a²/h² ∫ y² dy from 0 to h
= ρ π a²/h² [ y^3 /3 ] from 0 to h
= ρ π a²/h² (h^3/3)
= ρ π a² h /3

So M = (1/3) π a² h ρ.

Now, the integral for the center of mass:
∫ y dm = ∫ y (ρ π a²/h² y² dy) from 0 to h
= ρ π a²/h² ∫ y^3 dy from 0 to h
= ρ π a²/h² [ y^4 /4 ] from 0 to h
= ρ π a²/h² (h^4 /4 )
= ρ π a² h^3 /4

So y_cm = [ (ρ π a² h^3 /4 ) ] / [ (1/3) π a² h ρ ) ]
= ( (a² h^3) /4 ) / ( (a² h ) /3 )
= (h^3 /4 ) * (3)/(h )
= (3 h^2 ) /4 * 1/h
Wait, let me compute it again.

Wait, the numerator is (ρ π a² h^3 /4 ). denominator is (1/3) π a² h ρ.

So the ratio is:

( (ρ π a² h^3 /4 ) ) / ( (1/3) π a² h ρ ) )

The ρ, π, a² cancel out, leaving:

( h^3 /4 ) / ( (1/3) h ) )
= (h^3 /4 ) * (3 / h )
= (3 h^2 ) /4 * 1/h
Wait, no, 3/4 h^3 / h is 3/4 h^2, but this can't be right because the answer options don't have h squared. Wait, that can't be. Did I make a mistake in the integral setup?

Wait, perhaps I should have set up the integral differently. Maybe I should have considered the radius from the base, but let me think again.

Alternative approach: Let's set up the coordinate system with the origin at the base. So y=0 is the base, and y=h is the apex. Then the radius at a height y from the base is r(y) = (a/h)(h - y), because as y increases, the radius decreases. Wait, no: At y=0 (base), radius is a, and at y=h (apex), radius is zero. So yes, r(y) = (a/h) (h - y) = a (1 - y/h).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, if y=0 is base, then y increases to h (apex). So the radius at y is r(y) = (a/h) * (h - y). So when y=0, r= a. When y=h, r=0.

Wait, no, that would be substituting y=0 at the base and y=h at the apex, so r(y) = a (h - y)/h. So yes, that's correct.

Then, the volume element is π [r(y)]² dy. So dV = π (a^2 (h - y)^2 / h^2 ) dy.

So now, let's compute the center of mass y_cm (measured from the base, so from y=0 to y=h).

y_cm = (1/M) ∫ y dm

dm = ρ dV = ρ π (a² (h - y)^2 / h^2 ) dy

So,

∫ y dm = ρ π a²/h² ∫ y (h - y)^2 dy from y=0 to y=h.

Let me compute the integral I = ∫ y (h - y)^2 dy.

Expand (h - y)^2: h² - 2 h y + y².

So I = ∫ y (h² - 2h y + y² ) dy from 0 to h.

= ∫ (h² y - 2 h y² + y^3 ) dy
= h² ( y²/2 ) | from 0 to h  - 2h ( y^3/3 ) | from 0 to h  + ( y^4 /4 ) | from 0 to h )

Evaluate each term:

First term: h² ( (h²/2) - 0 ) = h^4 /2.

Second term: -2h ( (h^3 /3 ) - 0 ) = -2h (h^3 /3 ) = -2 h^4 /3.

Third term: (h^4/4 - 0 ) = h^4/4.

So I = (h^4/2) - (2 h^4 /3) + (h^4 /4 )

Let me compute this:

Convert all terms to twelfths for easy calculation.

h^4/2 = 6 h^4 /12.

2 h^4 /3 = 8 h^4 /12.

h^4 /4 = 3 h^4 /12.

So I = (6/12 -8/12 +3/12) h^4 = (1/12) h^4.

So I = h^4 /12.

So,

∫ y dm = ρ π a²/h^2 * (h^4 /12 ) = ρ π a²/h^2 * h^4 /12 = ρ π a² h^2 /12.

Now, M is the total mass, which is:

M = ∫ dm = ∫ ρ π a² (h - y)^2 dy from 0 to h.

Wait, we already computed the integral for ∫ y (h - y)^2 dy which is h^4/12.

But for the mass M, the integral ∫ (h - y)^2 dy is ∫ (h^2 - 2 h y + y^2 ) dy.

Which is h^2 y - h y^2 + y^3/3 evaluated from 0 to h.

At y=h: h^3 - h^3 + h^3/3 = h^3/3.

So ∫ (h - y)^2 dy from 0 to h is h^3/3.

So M = ρ π a² (h^3 /3 ) = (1/3) π a² h ρ.

Now, y_cm = ( ∫ y dm ) / M = ( ρ π a² h^2 /12 ) / ( (1/3) π a² h ρ )

Simplify: The ρ, π, a^2 cancel out.

So:

y_cm = (h^2 /12 ) / ( (1/3) h ) ) = (h^2 /12 ) * (3/h ) ) = (3 h^2 )/(12 h ) ) = (h/4 )

Wait, so h/4 is 1/4 h.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/4 h.

Wait, but wait a second, earlier I thought the center of mass is 1/4 h from the base? Is that correct? Because I remember for a cone, the center of mass is 1/4 h from the base.

Wait, let me think again. Oh wait, no, no. Wait, earlier I thought the center of mass was at 1/4 h from the base. But when I set up the coordinate system with the origin at the base, the center is at h/4 from the base. So that would mean the center is at h/4 from the base, which is 3/4 h from the apex.

Wait, wait, wait, let's make sure. If the height is h, and the center is at h/4 from the base, then the center is at h - h/4 = 3h/4 from the apex. Alternatively, it's 3/4 h from the apex.

But wait, in the options, option C is 3/4 h, and option F is h/sqrt(2). So according to my calculation, it's h/4 from the base, which is 3h/4 from the apex. So that would correspond to option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I think the center is at 1/4 h from the apex, but no, that's not right. No, wait, wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the coordinate system setup. Let me try another approach: If I take the apex as the origin, then y=0 is the apex, and y=h is the base.

In that case, the radius at a distance y from the apex is r(y) = (a/h) y.

So the volume element is π [ (a y/h )^2 ] dy = π a² y² / h² dy.

Mass element dm is ρ π a² y² / h² dy.

The center of mass y_cm is (1/M) ∫ y dm.

Compute M = ∫ dm from 0 to h.

M = ∫ ρ π a² y² / h² dy = ρ π a² / h^2 ∫ y^2 dy.

Which is (ρ π a² / h^2 ) * ( h^3 /3 ) = (ρ π a² h ) / 3.

Now, ∫ y dm = ∫ y (ρ π a² y² / h^2 ) dy = ρ π a² / h^2 ∫ y^3 dy.

Which is (ρ π a² / h^2 ) * ( h^4 /4 ) = (ρ π a² h^2 ) /4.

So y_cm = (ρ π a² h^2 /4 ) / ( ρ π a² h /3 ) ) = (h^2 /4 ) * (3/h ) = (3 h ) /4.

So in this coordinate system, the center of mass is at 3h/4 from the apex, which is 1/4 h from the base.

So in both setups, the same result: 1/4 h from the base, which is 3h/4 from the apex.

Looking at the options, option C is 3/4 h, which is the same as 3h/4. So the center of mass is 3/4 h from the apex, or 1/4 h from the base.

But the question is asking for the center of mass, so the answer must be 3/4 h from the apex, which is option C.

To find the center of mass of a uniformly solid cone with base diameter \(2a\) and height \(h\), we start by noting that the center of mass lies along the central axis of the cone. Due to symmetry, the center of mass is equidistant from the base and the apex.

### Key Steps:
1. **Volume Element**:  
   The radius of the cone at a height \(y\) from the apex is \(r(y) = \frac{a}{h} y\), where \(a\) is the base radius and \(h\) is the height. The volume element \(dV\) at height \(y\) is:  
   \[
   dV = \pi \left(\frac{a}{h} y\right)^2 dy = \pi \frac{a^2}{h^2} y^2 dy.
   \]

2. **Mass Element**:  
   The mass element \(dm\) is:  
   \[
   dm = \rho \, dV = \rho \pi \frac{a^2}{h^2} y^2 dy,
   \]  
   where \(\rho\) is the uniform density of the cone.

3. **Total Mass**:  
   The total mass \(M\) of the cone is:  
   \[
   M = \int_0^h \rho \pi \frac{a^2}{h^2} y^2 dy = \rho \pi \frac{a^2}{h^2} \int_0^h y^2 dy = \rho \pi \frac{a^2}{h^2} \left[\frac{y^3}{3}\right]_0^h = \rho \pi \frac{a^2}{h^2} \frac{h^3}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \rho \pi a^2 h.
   \]

4. **Center of Mass Calculation**:  
   The center of mass \(y_{\text{cm}}\) is given by:  
   \[
   y_{\text{cm}} = \frac{1}{M} \int_0^h y \, dm = \frac{1}{M} \int_0^h y \rho \pi \frac{a^2}{h^2} y^2 dy.
   \]  
   Substituting \(M\) from above:  
   \[
   y_{\text{cm}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{3} \rho \pi a^2 h} \int_0^h \rho \pi \frac{a^2}{h^2} y^3 dy.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   y_{\text{cm}} = \frac{3}{h} \int_0^h y^3 dy = \frac{3}{h} \left[\frac{y^4}{4}\right]_0^h = \frac{3}{h} \cdot \frac{h^4}{4} = \frac{3h^3}{4h} = \frac{3h}{4}.
   \]

5. **Interpretation**:  
   The center of mass is located \( \frac{3h}{4} \) from the apex and \( \frac{h}{4} \) from the base. This corresponds to option **C**.
