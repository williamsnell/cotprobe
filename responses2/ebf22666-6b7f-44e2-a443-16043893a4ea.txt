Okay, so I've got this question about partnership profits and how Matthews and Green split them. Let me try to figure this out. Alright, the problem says that they agreed that Matthews should get 60% of the profits or losses, and Green 40%. The total profits for the year were $10,200. I need to find out each partner's share.

First, I think I should understand the structure. So, it's a 60:40 split. That probably means Matthews takes 60% of the total profit, and Green takes 40%. But wait, since profit is $10,200, I need to calculate each portion.

Let me break it down. 60% of $10,200 for Matthews. Hmm, how do I calculate percentages? Oh right, percentages mean parts per hundred. So 60% is the same as 0.6 in decimal form. So I multiply 10,200 by 0.6. Let me see, 10,200 times 0.6. Let's do 10,000 * 0.6 is 6,000, and 200 * 0.6 is 120. So adding them gives 6,120. So Matthews gets $6,120.

Wait, but wait a second, another way: 60% of 10,200 is calculated as 10,200 multiplied by 0.6, which is 6,120. So that's correct for Matthews.

Now, Green gets 40% of $10,200. Let me compute that. 40% is 0.4. 10,200 * 0.4. Hmm, 10,000 * 0.4 is 4,000, and 200 * 0.4 is 80. So 4,080. So Green gets $4,080.

Wait, so the total should be $6,120 + $4,080. Let me add that: 6,000+4,000 is 10,000, and 120+80 is 200. So 10,200. That matches the total profit, so I must have done it right.

Looking at the options, the answer should have Matthews with $6,120 and Green $4,080. Let me check the options. Option I says Matthews: $6,120, Green: $4,080. That's exactly what I got. So the correct answer is I.

The correct answer is I: Matthews: $6,120, Green: $4,080.
