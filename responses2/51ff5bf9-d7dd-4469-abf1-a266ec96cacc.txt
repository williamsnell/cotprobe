Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about mirrors, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a headlight lamp. The lamp's filament is 10 cm in front of the mirror, and we need to form an image on a wall that's 3 meters away from the mirror. Then, we have to find the height of the image. The options are all about different types of mirrors and the image's size.

Hmm, I remember that mirrors can be concave, convex, or plane. The type depends on the position of the image and object. Also, the image's height depends on whether it's magnified or not, which relates to the mirror's shape.

So, first part of the question is about the mirror type. The wall is 3 meters (300 cm) away from the mirror. The object (filament) is 10 cm in front. Wait, when the object is between the mirror and the image, it's a real image, but if it's virtual, it's behind. But wait, the question is about forming an image on the wall. So, the image must be real and behind the mirror.

Wait, wait. Let me think. For a concave mirror, the image can be real and inverted, and it's formed when the object is within the focal length. The location depends on the focal length. For a convex mirror, the image is always virtual and upright, and it's behind the mirror.

So, first, what's the focal length needed for the image to be on the wall, which is 3 meters away.

Wait, the image is on the wall, so it's on one side of the mirror, right? So the image is real, and the object is in front of it.

Let me think about the mirror types. Let's consider the position:

For a concave mirror, if the object is within the focal length, the image is virtual and behind the mirror. But here, the image is on the wall, which is on the opposite side, so the image is real. So, the object must be beyond the focal length. Because for concave, if the object is beyond the focal length, the image is real and on the opposite side.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, if the object is between the mirror and the focal point, the image is virtual and behind. If it's beyond the focal point, the image is real and between the mirror and the focal point. If it's on the opposite side of the mirror, then the image is real and beyond the mirror.

Wait, let me get this straight: Concave mirrors can have real or virtual images. The image is real if the object is beyond the focal point. Virtual if the object is between the mirror and the focal point.

So, in our case, the image is on the wall beyond the mirror. So, the image is real. So, the object must be beyond the focal length of the mirror. So, concave mirror is the possibility.

What about convex mirrors? They produce virtual images on the opposite side of the mirror. So, if the image is on the wall, which is on the same side as the object, a convex mirror can't do that. So, it's not convex.

Plane mirrors can only produce images on the same side, but they're not as versatile as concave or convex. So, the mirror must be concave.

So, part (a) answer is a concave mirror.

Now, part (b) is about the image height. The object height is 5 mm.

I remember that the magnification formula is m = h'/h, where h' is the image height. Also, m is equal to the object distance (u) divided by the image distance (v), assuming the mirror is thin and the object is on one side (like a thin lens). Wait, for mirrors, the formula is m = -v/u. Wait, that's because the image can be real or virtual, so the sign matters. But the magnification's absolute value relates to size.

Wait, let me recall:

For mirrors, the magnification is given by m = -d_i / d_o, where d_o is the object distance and d_i is the image distance. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted, which is always the case for concave mirrors if d_i is positive (real image), and for convex mirrors it's always inverted.

So, the magnification's absolute value is |m| = |d_i / d_o|.

We are to find the image height, which is h' = m * h.

So, first, I need to find the image distance (d_i) relative to the mirror.

We have object distance (d_o) is 10 cm (0.1 m) in front of the mirror. The image distance (d_i) would be 3 m - 0.1 m = 2.9 m. Wait, no. Wait, the wall is 3 meters from the mirror. The object is 10 cm in front of the mirror, so the object distance is 0.1 m. The image is on the opposite side of the mirror, so the image distance is d_i = 3 m - 0.1 m? No, wait, no. Because the object is 0.1 m in front of the mirror, the image is on the wall, which is at 3 m beyond the mirror. So, the distance from the mirror to the image is 3 m.

Wait, but the object is 0.1 m from the mirror, so the image is 3 m on the other side. So, the image distance is 3 m, and the object distance is 0.1 m. So, d_i =3 m, d_o=0.1 m.

Wait, but concave mirror's image distance formula: 1/f = 1/d_i + 1/d_o.

We don't know f yet. But perhaps we can find f using the object and image distances.

So, for a concave mirror, the image is real, so d_i is positive, and d_o is positive when the object is in front of the mirror.

So, the object distance is 0.1 m, image distance is 3 m.

So, substituting into 1/f = 1/d_i + 1/d_o.

Wait, wait, the mirror formula is 1/f = 1/d_i + 1/d_o, but I think that's for a lens. Wait, no, no. The mirror formula is the same: 1/f = 1/d_i + 1/d_o.

So, plugging the numbers:

1/f = 1/3 + 1/0.1.

Wait, 1/3 is approximately 0.333, and 1/0.1 is 10. So, 0.333 + 10 = 10.333.

So, 1/f = 10.333 → f ≈ 0.09696 meters, which is about 96.96 cm. Wait, wait, because 0.09696 m is 96.96 cm.

So, the focal length is 96.96 cm. Hmm, but wait, 1/3 is 0.333, 1/0.1 is 10, sum is 10.333. So 1/f = 10.333 → f = 1 / (10.333) meters. Wait, 10.333 is approximately 10.333 m^-1.

Wait, 1/(10.333) is about 0.0969 meters, which is 96.96 cm. So the focal length is about 97 cm.

Wait, but that can't be correct because for a concave mirror, the focal length is positive, which it is here.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the image distance? Because when the wall is behind the mirror, the image is on the opposite side of the mirror, making the image distance positive.

Wait, but with the mirror formula, if the image is on the other side of the mirror, then the image distance (d_i) is positive, as in the formula, because it's on the same side as the object.

Wait, no. Wait, the image is formed on the opposite side from the object. So, in the mirror formula, the object distance (d_o) is positive, the image distance (d_i) is positive, because it's on the same side as the object. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the mirror formula is 1/f = 1/d_i + 1/d_o. But in this case, the object is on one side of the mirror, and the image is on the other. So, if the object is in front, then d_o is positive (0.1 m). The image is behind the mirror, so d_i is positive as well. So, the formula is correct.

So, 1/f = 1/3 + 1/0.1 → 1/3 is 0.333..., 1/0.1 is 10 → sum is 10.333. So f is 1/10.333 ≈ 0.09696 m → ~96.96 cm.

Now, for a concave mirror, the magnification is m = -v/u. So, v is 3 m, u is 0.1 m.

So, m = -(3 m) / (0.1 m) = -30. So, the magnification is -30. The negative sign means the image is inverted, which is correct for a concave mirror when the object is within the focal length.

The absolute value of m is 30, so the image is 30 times as large as the object.

The object height is 5 mm. So, the image height is 5 mm * 30 = 150 mm.

Wait, but I should confirm if that's correct. Alternatively, the magnification formula is m = h' / h, so h' = m * h.

So, h' = (-30) *5 mm = -150 mm. The negative sign indicates inverted. But since the question only asks for the height, not the sign, the answer would be 150 mm.

Wait, but wait, the image is real, so it's inverted. But the question doesn't specify the orientation, just the height. So, the height is 150 mm, regardless of the sign.

So, the image is formed on a wall, which is 300 cm from the mirror. The type of mirror is concave. The image height is 150 mm.

Looking at the options, option C is a concave mirror with 150 mm.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, another approach: the magnification is m = -v/u.

v is 3 m, u is 0.1 m.

So, m = -(3) / (0.1) = -30. So image is inverted and 30 times the size.

Object height is 5 mm, so image is 5 * 30 = 150 mm.

So, part (a) concave mirror, part (b) image height 150 mm.

Looking at the options, option C is concave and 150 mm. So, the correct answer should be C.
</think>

To determine the type of mirror and the height of the image, we analyze the setup as follows:

### Part (a): Mirror Type
The filament of the headlight lamp is 10 cm (0.1 m) in front of the mirror, and the image is formed on the wall, which is 3 meters (300 cm) away. Since the image is real and on the opposite side of the mirror, the object must be located between the focal point and the mirror (real image). This is characteristic of a **concave mirror**.

### Part (b): Image Height
For a concave mirror, the magnification formula is:

\[
m = -\frac{v}{u}
\]

where:
- \( v \) is the image distance (3 m),
- \( u \) is the object distance (0.1 m),
- \( m \) is the magnification.

Substituting the values:

\[
m = -\frac{3}{0.1} = -30
\]

The magnification indicates that the image is inverted and 30 times the size of the object. The absolute value of the magnification is 30, meaning the image is 30 times taller than the object.

The object height is 5 mm, so the image height is:

\[
h' = |m| \cdot h = 30 \cdot 5 \, \text{mm} = 150 \, \text{mm}
\]

### Final Answer
The mirror required is a **concave mirror**, and the height of the image is **150 mm**.
