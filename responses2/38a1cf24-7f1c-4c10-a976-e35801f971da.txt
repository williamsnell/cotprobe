Alright, so I've got this problem about linear transformations and determinants. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the question says that V is a space spanned by functions cos(2x) and sin(2x). So V is a two-dimensional vector space with basis {cos(2x), sin(2x)}. 

The linear transformation D is defined as D(f) = f'. So D takes a function f and returns its derivative. I need to find the determinant of this transformation D.

Hmm, determinants are related to the scaling factor of the linear transformation when it's applied to a space. For a 2x2 transformation matrix, the determinant tells us whether the transformation is invertible and how much it scales areas. If the determinant is zero, the transformation squishes the space into a lower dimension, which means it's not invertible.

So I think I should represent D as a matrix with respect to the basis {cos(2x), sin(2x)}. Let's see. Let me denote the basis vectors as e1 = cos(2x) and e2 = sin(2x).

Now, I need to find the images of e1 and e2 under D. So D(e1) and D(e2).

Calculating the derivative of e1: d/dx [cos(2x)] = -2 sin(2x). So D(e1) = -2 e2.

Similarly, the derivative of e2: d/dx [sin(2x)] = 2 cos(2x). So D(e2) = 2 e1.

So in matrix form, with respect to the basis {e1, e2}, D is represented by the matrix:

[ 0  2 ]
[ -2 0 ]

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. When you express D(e1) in terms of the basis, you get -2 e2, which is 0*e1 + (-2)*e2. Similarly, D(e2) is 2 e1 + 0 e2. So the matrix entries are:

First row (e1's coefficient): 0 for e1 and -2 for e2.

Second row (e2's coefficient): -2 for e1 and 0 for e2. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, maybe I should arrange the columns correctly.

Wait, the standard approach is to express D(e1) and D(e2) in terms of the basis vectors. So D(e1) is -2 e2, which is 0*e1 + (-2)*e2. So the first column of the matrix is [0, -2]^T. Similarly, D(e2) is 2 e1 + 0 e2, so the second column is [2, 0]^T.

So the matrix is:

[ 0  2 ]
[ -2 0 ]

Because for the first column, you have 0 for e1 and -2 for e2. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, matrix entries are determined by the coefficients. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the matrix is formed by the coefficients when expressing D(e1) and D(e2) in terms of the basis vectors. So D(e1) is -2 e2, which can be written as 0*e1 + (-2)*e2. So the first column is [0, -2]^T. Similarly, D(e2) is 2 e1 + 0 e2, so the second column is [2, 0]^T. 

Wait, no. Wait, the standard way to write the matrix is that each column represents the image of the basis vector in terms of the basis. So the first column is the coefficients of D(e1) in the basis. So D(e1) is -2 e2, so in terms of e1 and e2, it's 0*e1 + (-2)*e2. So the first column is [0, -2]^T.

Similarly, D(e2) is 2 e1 + 0 e2, so the second column is [2, 0]^T.

So the matrix is:

[ 0   2 ]
[ -2  0 ]

Wait, no. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, the matrix has rows corresponding to the images of e1 and e2. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The matrix is constructed by taking the coefficients of the images of the basis vectors in terms of the basis vectors. 

So, for D(e1) = -2 e2, which is equivalent to 0*e1 + (-2)*e2. So the coefficients are [0, -2]^T. So the first column is [0, -2]^T.

Similarly, D(e2) = 2 e1 + 0 e2, which is [2, 0]^T. So the second column is [2, 0]^T.

Therefore, the matrix is:

[ 0  2 ]
[-2  0 ]

Wait, no, that would mean that the matrix is:

Row 1: 0, 2

Row 2: -2, 0

But wait, that seems correct.

So to find the determinant of this matrix. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] is ad - bc.

So in this case, a=0, b=2, c=-2, d=0.

Determinant is (0)(0) - (2)(-2) = 0 - (-4) = 4.

Wait, that leads to determinant 4. Looking at the options, there's an H:4 as an option. So the determinant would be 4, so the answer should be H.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the order of the basis vectors matters. Let me make sure I set up the matrix correctly.

Wait, the standard matrix for a linear transformation is such that if you have a basis {v1, v2}, and the transformation sends v1 to a linear combination of v1 and v2, and similarly for v2, the matrix is formed by the coefficients.

So, in this case, D(v1) = -2 v2, so in terms of the basis, it's 0 v1 + (-2) v2 → [0, -2] as the first column.

Similarly, D(v2) = 2 v1 + 0 v2 → [2, 0] as the second column.

So the matrix is:

[ 0  2 ]
[ -2 0 ]

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, the first column is [0, -2], the second column is [2, 0]. So the matrix is:

[ 0   2 ]
[ -2  0 ]

Wait, that can’t be right because when you compute the determinant you get 0*0 - 2*(-2) = 4. So the determinant is 4. So option H is 4, so the answer is H.

Alternatively, if I made a mistake in the matrix setup, maybe I should re-examine.

Wait, another way: when you write the matrix, the first column is the coefficients of D(e1) in terms of the basis, which is 0 e1 + (-2) e2 → [0, -2]^T.

The second column is the coefficients of D(e2) in terms of the basis, which is 2 e1 + 0 e2 → [2, 0]^T.

So the matrix is:

[ 0  2 ]
[ -2 0 ]

Wait, but that would mean the matrix is:

0  2

-2 0

But wait, the determinant is 0*0 - 2*(-2) = 4. So yes, determinant is 4.

So the answer should be option H:4.
</think>

The given linear transformation D(f) = f' acts on the space V, which is spanned by cos(2x) and sin(2x). To find the determinant of D, we represent D as a matrix with respect to the basis {cos(2x), sin(2x)}. The derivatives of the basis functions yield -2 sin(2x) and 2 cos(2x), respectively. Thus, the matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 2 \\
-2 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is calculated as (0)(0) - (2)(-2) = 4. Therefore, the determinant is 4.
