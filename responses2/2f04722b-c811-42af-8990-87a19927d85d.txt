Okay, so I have this question asking for the greatest common factor of 36 and 90. Hmm, I remember that the greatest common factor, or GCF, is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. Let me think about how to find it.

I think the best way is to list out all the factors of each number and then find the largest one they have in common. So, let's start with 36. The factors of 36 are numbers that multiply together to give 36. Let's list them:

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. Yeah, that's all the factors.

Now for 90. I'll do the same. The factors of 90 are:

1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90. 

Wait, some of these might overlap with the factors of 36. Let me find the common ones. Looking at both lists, I see 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18 are common factors. 

Between these, the largest is 18. So the greatest common factor of 36 and 90 is 18. Let me just double-check by using another method, like the Euclidean algorithm. 

The Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller and then taking the remainder and repeating. So, divide 90 by 36. 36 goes into 90 twice, making 72, with a remainder of 18. Then, divide 36 by 18, which is exactly 2 with no remainder. So the last non-zero remainder is 18, which confirms that the GCF is indeed 18.

The greatest common factor (GCF) of 36 and 90 is the largest number that divides both without a remainder. Listing factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. Factors of 90: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90. Common factors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18. The largest is 18.

Answer: I: 18
