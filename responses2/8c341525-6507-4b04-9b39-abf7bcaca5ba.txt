Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the nephron and the Henle loop. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question is asking which substances the descending loop of the Henle in the kidney is permeable to. The options are A to J. I remember that the Henle loop plays a role in the kidney's filtering process.

Wait, the descending loop is part of the loop of Henle, right? So the loop is made up of the medullary constrictors and the descending part. I think the medullary constrictors are the other parts, but the loop itself is the descending part.

Now, the loop is made of cells that are usually impermeable to water. So, I'm pretty sure it's not passing through H2O. That would rule out options F and H, which are H2O and K+. So F and H are probably not the answer.

The cells make up the loop are called the ascending part and the descending part. The ascending part is where water enters the kidney, and the descending part is the area that's usually impermeable, but maybe some specific substances are allowed.

I remember that the descending loop allows some substances to pass. Water is part of it, but maybe it's actually not considered to pass through because it's the loop that's impermeable. Wait, but I think the cells themselves are impermeable, so water isn't passed through. But wait, the cells are the cells, so maybe the cells themselves are considered not to pass through, but the loop is the structure through which substances can pass.

Wait, the question is about what the loop is permeable to. So, the cells themselves are the looping structure, which is made of cells that are impermeable to many substances.

So for the cells in the loop, the substances that pass through would be those that are normally present in the cells. Let's think about what's inside the cells.

When the loop is working, the cells are actively moving water and salts into the glomerulus. So, substances that are stored in the cells would be those that are not present outside, so those would be the substances the loop allows.

Which substances are stored in the cells? I think Ca²+ is stored, but I'm not sure. Also, water is inside, but perhaps the cells are impermeable to some, like H2O, but maybe Ca²+ is taken in.

Wait, the cells in the loop are known to allow some substances in. For example, I think Ca²+ is present inside the cells. So, the loop allows Ca²+ to pass through. That would make option B correct.

Looking at the options, B is Ca²+. The other options I'm not as sure about. H2O isn't allowed, so F is out. K+ is a different story; the loop doesn't allow K+ to pass. Similarly, Na+ is not in the cells, I think. Cl- is also not a big part of the loop's function.

Wait, but looking at what the cells actually contain. The cells are made up of a cell membrane, but they have various substances inside. The cells are mostly water, with ions and salts. So, Ca²+ is stored in the cells, so the loop allows Ca²+ to pass. So option B is correct.

Other options: Urea is a product of the loop. So the loop doesn't allow urea to pass through. So option J is out.

So the correct answer should be B: Ca²+.

The descending loop of the Henle, part of the loop of Henle in the kidney, is made up of cells that are impermeable to many substances. These cells contain ions, such as Ca²+, which are normally stored and taken into the glomerulus during filtration. The loop does not allow water (H₂O) or other substances like K⁺, Na⁺, Cl⁻, or Urea to pass through. Among the options, Ca²+ is the only substance that is stored within the cells of the descending loop and is therefore allowed to pass through. 

Answer: B
