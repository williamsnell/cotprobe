Question:

Mr. Brennan owns an open field adjacent to his house. The coach of the local high school football team offered Mr. Brennan $250 to rent the field from him for his team's summer football drills. Mr. Brennan could also grow vege-tables on the field. The cost of seed, fertilizer, and hiring neighborhood teenagers to plant and harvest the field he estimates would be $200 and Mr. Brennan expects to receive $500 if he sold the vegetables. What are the explicit and implicit costs to Mr. Brennan of growing vege-tables, and will he choose to grow vegetables or rent the field?

Options:

A: Do nothing
B: Sell the field
C: Grow vegetables
D: Rent the field

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Brennan and his decision between renting a field or growing vegetables. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

The question is about calculating the explicit and implicit costs of growing vegetables and deciding whether Mr. Brennan should choose to grow them or rent the field.

First, let me remember what explicit costs are. Explicit costs are the direct out-of-pocket expenses that a person incurs in the process of doing something. Those would include things like seeds, fertilizer, labor, maybe maintenance costs. 

The problem says that the coach offered Mr. Brennan $250 to rent the field for his summer drills. So, that's one of the options. But he's considering growing vegetables instead. So, let's see what the explicit costs are for growing vegetables.

The cost of seed, fertilizer, and hiring teenagers seems to be $200. So, that's an explicit cost because it's a direct expense. Then, the problem states that Mr. Brennan expects to receive $500 if he sold the vegetables. That sounds like the revenue he would get if he sells them. So, the revenue is $500, and the explicit costs are $200. 

Wait, but what about the implicit costs? Implicit costs are the opportunity costs, like the next best alternative he could have taken. So, in this case, if he chooses to grow vegetables, his implicit cost is the rent he would have paid to the coach. Because growing vegetables is an alternative, and he's choosing not to rent the field, so the next best alternative is the rent money he could have earned. 

So, let me list out the numbers. Explicit costs are $200. Implicit costs are the $250 that he could have earned by renting the field. 

Now, to decide whether he should grow vegetables or rent the field, we compare the explicit costs to the opportunity cost. Wait, let me think. Actually, I need to compare the total costs and revenues. 

Wait, the problem says he expects to receive $500 if he sold the vegetables. So, the net benefit would be revenue minus explicit costs. Let me calculate that. 

Revenue from selling vegetables: $500. Explicit cost: $200. So, if he sells them, his net gain is $500 - $200 = $300. 

But what if he doesn't grow vegetables and instead chooses to rent the field? He would get $250. So, his net gain in that case is $250. 

So, comparing the two options: 
- Renting: $250 
- Growing: $300 (because 500 - 200) 

Wait, but isn't growing a positive choice because it gives more than just the cost? Because growing would give him $300, which is higher than $250. So, he would choose to grow vegetables. 

Wait, but let me double-check. The question is about explicit and implicit costs. The implicit cost is the $250 he would have earned by renting. So, his implicit cost is $250. 

So, the explicit cost is $200, and the implicit cost is $250. 

In terms of decision-making, the implicit cost represents the opportunity cost he's giving up by not renting the field. So, his implicit cost is $250. 

So, when comparing the costs, growing vegetables would cost him $200, but gives him $500 in revenue. So, the net benefit is $300. But the implicit cost is the $250 he would have made from renting. 

Wait, but the question is about whether he should grow or rent. So, the comparison is between the cost of growing ($200) and the implicit cost of not growing (which is $250). 

Wait, no, it's a bit different. The implicit cost is the next best alternative. So, the cost of growing is the $200, and the alternative is the $250 rent. So, if growing costs $200, which is less than the implicit cost of $250, he should grow. Because the cost is lower. 

Alternatively, the net benefit of growing would be 500 - 200 = 300, which is more than 250, so growing is better. 

So, the costs are explicit: $200. Implicit: $250. So, the question is, what are the explicit and implicit costs to Mr. Brennan of growing vegetables? 

The options are A through J. Looking at the options, the correct answer should state that the costs are explicit: $200, implicit: $250. 

Wait, the question asks: What are the explicit and implicit costs to Mr. Brennan of growing vegetables, and will he choose to grow vegetables or rent the field?

So, the options are about the choices he makes. The options don't specify the exact numbers, but the correct one is the one that says growing is better because it's more than the implicit cost.

Wait, let me look at the options. The options are A to J. The available options are:

A: Do nothing
B: Sell the field
C: Grow vegetables
D: Rent the field

The question is, which option is correct: the costs and the decision. But the options given are the choices for the correct answer. The options don't include the costs, but the correct answer is the choice between growing or renting.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The question is asking which option correctly describes the costs and the decision. So, the correct answer is option C: Grow vegetables. Because the net benefit of growing is higher than the implicit cost of renting. 

But wait, let me make sure. Let's compute the net benefits. 

If he grows vegetables:
Revenue = $500
Explicit cost = $200
Net benefit = 500-200 = $300.

If he rents the field:
Revenue = $250
Implicit cost = $250 (opportunity cost)
Net benefit = 250 - 250 = $0 (break even).

So, he would choose to grow because the net benefit is higher.

So, the correct answer is option C: Grow vegetables.

Wait, but the question is about what are the explicit and implicit costs, which are $200 and $250 respectively. 

Looking at the options, the options are the choices for the correct answer, not the costs. So, the correct answer is option C: Grow vegetables.

The question involves determining whether Mr. Brennan should grow vegetables or rent the field. To answer this, we need to identify the explicit and implicit costs and compare their net benefits.

### Explicit Costs:
- The explicit costs are the direct expenses associated with growing vegetables. These include the cost of seed, fertilizer, and hiring teenagers, totaling **$200**.

### Implicit Costs:
- Implicit costs represent the opportunity costs, which are the next best alternatives Mr. Brennan could have taken. In this case, the implicit cost is the $250 he could have earned by renting the field for his summer drills.

### Decision Analysis:
- If Mr. Brennan grows vegetables, his net gain is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Revenue} - \text{Explicit Costs} = \$500 - \$200 = \$300
  \]
- If he instead rents the field, his net gain is:
  \[
  \text{Rent} = \$250
  \]
- Comparing the net benefits, growing vegetables yields a higher net gain ($300) than renting the field ($250). Therefore, Mr. Brennan should choose to grow vegetables.

### Correct Answer:
The explicit cost is **$200**, and the implicit cost is **$250**. Given the higher net benefit of growing vegetables, the correct choice is **C: Grow vegetables**.
