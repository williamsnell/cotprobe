Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how long it takes for the rocket to leave the ground after ignition. The question gives me a lot of details, but I'm a bit confused about which formulas to use. Let me think through this step by step.

The rocket has an initial mass of 20,000 kg. Oh wait, the mass ratio is 3. Hmm, mass ratio is mass of the rocket plus fuel divided by the empty mass. So, I think the mass ratio (MR) is given by MR = (m_0 + m_fuel) / m_empty, where m_0 is the initial mass, and m_fuel is the mass burned. So, if MR is 3, and m_0 is 2e4 kg, then m_empty = (m_0 + m_fuel) / 3. But wait, m_fuel is 100 kg/s, and the exhaust velocity is 980 m/s. Oh, maybe I don't need to calculate the mass ratio for this part. Because I think this problem is about motion after ignition, not the total mass.

Wait, the question is about the time after ignition when the rocket leaves the ground. So, I think this is the time when the thrust equals the gravitational force, so the rocket stops accelerating upwards and starts falling back. That's the point where the upward velocity becomes zero.

So, the rocket's motion after ignition is decelerating due to gravity until its velocity reaches zero. But the rocket's thrust provides an upward acceleration, which may not be constant because the exhaust velocity is given as a constant. Wait no, the exhaust velocity is constant, but the thrust actually depends on the mass flow rate, which is given as 100 kg/s. Oh wait, so the thrust is equal to mass flow rate times exhaust velocity. So, F_thrust = dot(m) * v_e.

But wait, for the rocket's motion, the thrust provides an acceleration (a = F/m, where m is the instantaneous mass of the rocket). So the acceleration changes as the mass decreases because as the fuel burns, the mass of the rocket decreases. That complicates things because the acceleration isn't constant. So I can't just use a simple kinematic equation here.

Hmm, so maybe I should think about the problem in terms of the rocket equation, or perhaps integrate the acceleration over time until the velocity drops to zero.

Wait, the rocket's acceleration is a = (dot(m) * v_e) / m(t), where m(t) is the mass of the rocket at time t. Since the mass decreases as the fuel is burned, m(t) = m_0 - dot(m)*t. So, a(t) = (100 kg/s * 980 m/s) / (2e4 - 100t) ) m/s².

So, the acceleration is a function of time: a(t) = (100*980)/(2e4 - 100t) = 98000/(20000 - 100t).

Wait, but that's the acceleration. Then, the velocity as a function of time is the integral of acceleration from 0 to time t.

So, v(t) = integral from 0 to t of a(t') dt'.

Which is integral (98000)/(20000 - 100t') dt'.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 20000 - 100t.

Then, du/dt = -100 → dt = -du/100.

When t=0, u=20000.

When t = T, u=20000 - 100T.

So, the integral becomes:

v(T) = ∫ from u=20000 to u=20000-100T [98000/u ] * (-du/100) )

Changing the limits, because the substitution would make the integral from 20000 to (20000-100T) but with a negative, which flips the limits:

v(T) = ∫ from (20000-100T) to 20000 [98000/u ] * (du/100 )

Factor out constants: 98000/100 → 980.

So, v(T) = 980 * ∫ [1/u] du from (20000-100T) to 20000.

The integral of 1/u is ln(u), so:

v(T) = 980 [ ln(20000) - ln(20000 - 100T) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

v(T) = 980 ln(20000 / (20000 - 100T) )

We want to find T when v(T) = 0.

Setting v(T) = 0:

980 ln(20000 / (20000 - 100T) ) = 0 → ln(20000/(20000-100T)) ) = 0.

ln(1) = 0 → 20000/(20000 -100T) ) = 1 → 20000 = 20000 -100T → 100T = 0 → T=0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the rocket can't leave the ground at t=0. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider that at the point when the rocket's velocity is zero, the thrust equals the gravitational force. Because that's when the rocket stops accelerating upward and starts falling back. So, the point where the rocket's velocity becomes zero is when the rocket's thrust equals the gravitational force.

Alternatively, perhaps I should set the thrust equal to the gravitational force at that moment.

The thrust is F_thrust = dot(m) * v_e.

The gravitational force at that moment is F_gravity = m(t) * g, where m(t) is the mass of the rocket at that time, and g is 9.81 m/s².

Wait, but the rocket's mass at time t is m(t) = m_0 - dot(m)*t = 2e4 -100t.

So, when the rocket's velocity becomes zero, F_thrust = F_gravity.

So,

dot(m) * v_e = (m_0 - dot(m)*t) * g.

Plugging the numbers,

100 kg/s * 980 m/s = (20000 - 100t) * 9.81.

Calculate left side: 100*980 = 98,000.

So,

98000 = (20000 -100t) *9.81.

Divide both sides by 9.81:

20000 -100t = 98000 /9.81 ≈ let's calculate that.

98000 ÷ 9.81 ≈ 9989.888.

So,

20000 -100t ≈ 9989.888 → 20000 -9989.888 ≈100t → 10010.112 ≈100t → t≈100.10112 seconds.

Hmm, that's about 100.1 seconds, which is option C: 100 sec.

But wait, earlier when I tried integrating the acceleration, I got v(T) = 980 ln(20000/(20000-100T)).

Setting that to zero gives T=0. So, that approach seems incorrect.

Wait, but the mistake I made in the first approach is that the integration of acceleration gives the velocity, but when I set that to zero, I get T=0, which is incorrect because the rocket starts at zero velocity, and as time increases, velocity increases until it reaches a maximum (when acceleration is zero), then starts to decrease.

Wait, but wait, when T approaches 200 seconds (since m(t) = 2e4-100*200= 2e4-2e4=0), the mass becomes zero. So, the acceleration a(t) = 98000/(20000 -100t) → as t approaches 200, denominator approaches zero, so a approaches infinity. So, the rocket's acceleration becomes infinite at t=200 seconds, but that's the point when the fuel runs out, and the rocket's mass becomes zero. But in reality, the rocket can't have infinite acceleration, but perhaps the problem considers the point where the rocket's acceleration is zero, which would be after all fuel is burned.

Wait, but when I set v(T) = 0, I get T=0, which can't be right. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The problem is to find the time when the rocket's velocity becomes zero after ignition. So, that's when the thrust equals the gravitational force.

Because, at that point, the net force is zero, so the rocket stops accelerating upwards.

So, the equation is:

F_thrust = F_gravity.

Which is,

dot(m) * v_e = m(t) * g.

So,

100 kg/s * 980 m/s = (2e4 -100 t) kg * 9.81 m/s².

Compute left side:

100 * 980 = 98,000.

Right side: (20000 -100t) *9.81.

So,

20000 -100t = 98000 /9.81.

Let me compute 98000 /9.81.

Well, 9.81 is approximately 9800/1000, so 98000/9.81 = 98000/(9800/1000) )= 98000 * (1000/9800) ) = 10,000.

Wait, because 98000/(9.81) = (9.81 * 10000) /9.81 )= 10,000.

Wait, that's correct because 9.81 *10,000 =98100, but 98000 is 10,000 * 9.8 (since 9.8 *10,000=98,000). So, 98000 /9.81 = approximately 10,000 * (9.8/9.81) → 10,000 * (approx 0.99899) → ~9989.9 seconds?

Wait, no, let me do it more accurately.

Wait, 98000 divided by 9.81 is (98000 ÷ 9) ≈ 10,888.888..., but with 9.81, it's less.

Wait, 9.81 * 9989.888 is approximately 98,000.

Because 9.81 * 10,000 = 98,100. So, 9.81 *9,989.888 ≈ 98,000.

So, 20000 -100t = 9989.888 → 100t = 20000-9989.888 = 10010.112 → t=100.10112 seconds.

So, approximately 100.1 seconds. That's option C.

So, the correct answer is C: 100 sec.

To determine how long after ignition the rocket leaves the ground, we analyze the motion under the influence of gravity and thrust. The rocket's motion is governed by thrust, mass loss, and gravitational force. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Thrust and Gravitational Force**:  
   The thrust is given by \( F_{\text{thrust}} = \dot{m} v_e \), where \( \dot{m} = 100 \, \text{kg/s} \) and \( v_e = 980 \, \text{m/s} \). The gravitational force is \( F_{\text{gravity}} = m(t) g \), where \( m(t) = m_0 - \dot{m} t \) (mass at time \( t \)) and \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). At the point when the rocket leaves the ground, the thrust equals the gravitational force, as this is when the rocket's upward acceleration becomes zero.

2. **Equating Thrust and Gravitational Force**:  
   Set \( F_{\text{thrust}} = F_{\text{gravity}} \):  
   \[
   \dot{m} v_e = m(t) g
   \]  
   Substituting the known values:  
   \[
   100 \cdot 980 = (20000 - 100t) \cdot 9.81
   \]  
   Simplify:  
   \[
   98000 = (20000 - 100t) \cdot 9.81
   \]  
   Divide both sides by \( 9.81 \):  
   \[
   \frac{98000}{9.81} \approx 9989.89 \, \text{kg}
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   20000 - 100t = 9989.89
   \]  
   Solve for \( t \):  
   \[
   100t = 20000 - 9989.89 = 10010.11 \, \text{kg}
   \]  
   \[
   t \approx \frac{10010.11}{100} = 100.1011 \, \text{seconds}
   \]  

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The rocket leaves the ground approximately \( 100.1 \, \text{seconds} \) after ignition, which corresponds to option **C: 100 sec**.
