Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The skin is much more than merely an outer wrapping for an animal; it is an important organ system and performs many diverse functions. What are some of the primary functions of the skin in man?

Options:

A: The skin primarily serves as a storage site for fat-soluble vitamins
B: The skin's primary function is to enhance physical appearance
C: The primary function of the skin is to provide an outer covering for the body
D: The main function of the skin is to produce sweat and keep the body cool
E: The skin's main function is to regulate the level of oxygen entering the body
F: The main function of the skin is to produce pigments that give color to the hair and eyes
G: The skin's primary function is to absorb nutrients from the external environment
H: The primary role of the skin is to act as a secondary respiratory organ
I: The primary functions of the skin are to protect the body against external agents, maintain a constant internal environment, thermoregulation, and excretion of metabolic wastes.
J: The primary function of the skin is to facilitate the sense of touch only

Okay, so I have this question about the skin's functions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: "The skin is much more than merely an outer wrapping for an animal; it is an important organ system and performs many diverse functions. What are some of the primary functions of the skin in man?"

The options are A to J. I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. So, I remember that skin has various roles. Let me try to recall each function.

Option C says the skin is primarily a covering for the body. That's true because it's the outer layer, but I think it's more than just that. The skin does much more than just covering.

Option A is about fat-soluble vitamins. I think the skin does absorb vitamins, but I don't remember if it's specifically fat-soluble. Maybe it's a secondary function, like the eyes and mouthparts do more.

Option D: produce sweat and regulate oxygen. Yeah, sweat production is a primary function. When we sweat, we expel excess heat, which keeps us cool. But is that the only function? I think some skin functions are more about heat regulation than about producing sweat.

Option E: regulate oxygen. I'm not so sure. I think the skin doesn't directly regulate oxygen, but the blood oxygen levels are regulated by the body, which is through the skin. But the skin's main job is sweat and heat regulation.

Option B: enhance physical appearance. That's more the job of the eyes and maybe the mouth, but the skin itself doesn't do that. It's the visual part.

Option F: produce pigments. That's the job of the eyes, not the skin.

Option G: absorb nutrients. I think the skin does absorb a lot of nutrients from the environment, but that's a broad function, not the primary one. The primary functions are more specific.

Option H: act as a secondary respiratory organ. I think the skin isn't acting as a respiratory organ. That's more the job of the lungs.

Option I: protect against external agents, maintain internal environment, thermoregulate, and excrete waste. Oh, that's the main functions. So the skin does all those things: protection, thermoregulation (like shivering), and excrete waste (like skin cells). Also, the skin absorbs nutrients, which is a function that's important.

Option J: facilitate touch only. That's more the job of the skin in terms of sensation, but not the primary function.

So putting it together: the primary functions of the skin include protecting against external damage, maintaining internal environment (which includes regulating temperature), excreting metabolic waste, and absorbing nutrients. 

Let me check the options: option I says the primary functions are to protect, maintain internal environment, thermoregulation, and excrete waste. That sounds right.

Wait, does it also include absorbing nutrients? Because option I includes several of those. Oh, but looking at the options, option I's first part says "to protect..." and then goes on to more functions which include absorbing nutrients. So I think the primary functions are the ones in option I. Because the question is asking for the primary functions, and option I's main functions encompass those.

So the correct answer should be I.

The skin's primary functions include protecting against external damage, maintaining a constant internal environment (which includes regulating temperature), excreting metabolic waste, and absorbing nutrients from the environment. These functions are encapsulated in option I, which accurately describes the skin's primary roles.

Answer: I
