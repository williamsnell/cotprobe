Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem here. Let me see what it's about. The question is about solving an initial value problem and finding where the solution equals zero. Hmm, okay, so the DE is 4y'' +12y' +9y = 0, with y(0)=1 and y'(0)=-4. I need to find where the solution is zero from the options given.

First, I think I should solve the differential equation. Since it's a linear homogeneous equation with constant coefficients, I can use the characteristic equation method. The characteristic equation would be 4r² +12r +9 = 0. Let me solve for r.

Using the quadratic formula: r = [-12 ± sqrt(144 - 4*4*9)] / (2*4). Calculating the discriminant: 144 - 144 = 0. Oh, so there's a repeated root. That means the general solution will be of the form y(t) = (C1 + C2*t) * e^(rt).

Wait, what's the value of r here? Since discriminant is zero, r = (-12)/(2*4) = -12/8 = -1.5. So r = -3/2. So the solution becomes y(t) = (C1 + C2 t) e^(-1.5 t).

Now, I need to apply the initial conditions to find C1 and C2. The initial conditions are y(0)=1 and y'(0)=-4. Let's plug in t=0 into y(t). y(0)=1 = (C1 + 0) e^(0) → C1=1. So C1 is 1.

Now, let's find y'(t). The derivative of y(t) is [C2 e^(-1.5 t)] + (C1 + C2 t) * (-1.5 e^(-1.5 t)). At t=0, this becomes y'(0) = C2 + (1)(-1.5) = C2 - 1.5 = -4. So solving for C2: C2 = -4 + 1.5 = -2.5. So C2 is -2.5.

So the solution is y(t) = (1 - 2.5 t) e^(-1.5 t). Now, I need to find the time t where y(t) = 0. So set (1 - 2.5 t) e^(-1.5 t) = 0. But e^(-1.5 t) is never zero, so the equation reduces to 1 - 2.5 t = 0. Solving for t: 2.5 t =1 → t=1/2.5 = 0.4. 

Looking at the options, 0.4 is option E. So the solution is zero at t=0.4. Therefore, the answer should be E.

To solve the initial value problem:
$$
4 y^{\prime \prime}+12 y^{\prime}+9 y=0, \quad y(0)=1, \quad y^{\prime}(0)=-4,
$$
we first recognize it as a linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:
$$
4r^2 + 12r + 9 = 0.
$$
Solving using the quadratic formula, we find a repeated root:
$$
r = -\frac{3}{2}.
$$
Thus, the general solution is:
$$
y(t) = (C_1 + C_2 t) e^{-\frac{3}{2}t}.
$$
Applying the initial conditions:
- At \( t = 0 \), \( y(0) = C_1 = 1 \).
- The derivative \( y'(t) = (C_2 e^{-\frac{3}{2}t}) + (C_1 + C_2 t)(-\frac{3}{2} e^{-\frac{3}{2}t}) \). At \( t = 0 \), \( y'(0) = -\frac{3}{2} C_1 + C_2 = -4 \). Substituting \( C_1 = 1 \), we get \( C_2 = -2.5 \).

The solution is:
$$
y(t) = (1 - 2.5 t) e^{-1.5 t}.
$$
Setting \( y(t) = 0 \), we find \( 1 - 2.5 t = 0 \) (since \( e^{-1.5 t} \) is never zero). Solving gives \( t = 0.4 \).
