Okay, so I've got this question about machine learning concepts, specifically about VC-dimension and shattering. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has two statements, 1 and 2. Statement 1 says that the set of all rectangles in 2D can shatter a set of 5 points. Statement 2 claims that the VC-dimension of the k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) classifier with k=1 is infinite. I need to determine if each statement is true or false, and then choose the correct option from A to J.

First, let's tackle Statement 1. VC-dimension is a measure of the capacity of a statistical classification algorithm, defined as the largest set of points that the classifier can shatter. Shattering means that for every possible labeling of the points, there exists a classifier that can achieve it.

A rectangle in 2D includes non-axis-aligned ones. So, can all rectangles shatter 5 points? Well, to shatter 5 points, the VC-dimension must be at least 5. But what's the VC-dimension of the set of all rectangles?

I remember that for rectangles in 2D, the VC-dimension is 4. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The VC-dimension of axis-aligned rectangles is 4, but when considering all possible rectangles (including non-axis-aligned ones), the VC-dimension increases. Oh wait, no, actually, rectangles in general can represent more complex shapes. Wait, maybe I'm confusing it. Alternatively, perhaps the VC-dimension of all rectangles is higher than 4. But wait, if the VC-dimension is 4, then it can't shatter 5 points. So, can a set of all rectangles shatter 5 points?

Wait, shattering requires that for every possible labeling of the 5 points, there's a rectangle that can separate them. But a rectangle can only represent certain configurations. For example, the VC-dimension for rectangles is 4, so they can't shatter 5 points because the maximum VC-dimension is 4. So Statement 1 would be false because you can't shatter 5 points with a set of all rectangles. So Statement 1 is False.

Moving on to Statement 2. The k-NN classifier with k=1 is essentially a nearest neighbor classifier. The VC-dimension of this classifier is... Hmm. I recall that the VC-dimension of k-NN with k=1 is infinite. Wait, why? Because for k=1, the classifier is sensitive to individual points. The VC-dimension is the size of the largest set that can be shattered. For any finite set of points, can you find a labeling that the classifier can't handle? 

Alternatively, the k-NN classifier with k=1 isn't linearly separable, but its VC-dimension is infinite because it can shatter any finite set. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no. I think that for k=1, the VC-dimension is infinite because you can have any possible labeling of the points, which would require an infinite VC-dimension. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the VC-dimension is finite, but I thought it's infinite. Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. 

Wait, let me recall: The VC-dimension of the nearest neighbor rule is known to be infinite because for k=1, the classifier can perfectly fit any finite set of points. Because for any given set of points, you can arrange them such that for each point, it's a different class. So, for example, arrange five points all with the same label, but each is a different distance from a single point (the one used for classification). Wait, no, that's not possible. So perhaps the VC-dimension of k=1 is indeed infinite because it can shatter any finite set, meaning it can correctly classify any possible labeling. So Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Another approach: The VC-dimension of a classifier is the size of the largest set that can be shattered. So for k=1, since you can have any possible labeling, the VC-dimension would be infinite. So Statement 2 is True.

So, Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is True. Now, looking at the answer options, each option is a pair of True/False. 

Looking at the options:

A: True, True → No, because Statement 1 is False.

B: False, True → Yes, this matches.

C: Depends on dataset, True → Statement 1 is False, so C is wrong.

D: False, Depends → Both are False, but Statement 2 is True, so D is wrong.

E: Depends on dataset, Depends → No, Statement 1 is False.

F: True, Depends → Statement 1 is False.

G: True, False → No, Statement 2 is True.

H: False, False → No.

I: Depends on dataset, False → No, Statement 1 is False.

J: True, Not enough info → No.

So the correct answer is B: False, True.
</think>

The analysis concludes that Statement 1 is false because the set of all rectangles cannot shatter 5 points (their VC-dimension is 4), and Statement 2 is true because the VC-dimension of 1-NN is infinite. Therefore, the correct option is B: False, True.

Answer: B
