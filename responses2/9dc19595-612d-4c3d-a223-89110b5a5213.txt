Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about group theory. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about two statements related to direct products of finite groups and the existence of certain subgroups in the direct sum of cyclic groups. Hmm, I remember that internal direct products are a way to combine groups, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions.

Statement 1 says that if G and H are finite groups, then the order of their internal direct product G + H is equal to the product of their orders, |G||H|. Wait, I think that's correct. I remember that for finite groups, the order of the direct product is indeed the product of the orders. But wait, I should double-check. Oh yeah, internal direct product requires that G and H are both normal in G + H, and their intersection is trivial. But for finite groups, the internal direct product's order would be the product of the group orders because each element is uniquely expressed as a product of an element from G and an element from H. So Statement 1 should be True.

Now, Statement 2: If r divides m and s divides n, then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s. Wait, I think Z_m is the cyclic group of order m, and Z_n similarly. But when we take their direct sum (I'm assuming this is the direct product, but maybe it's the direct sum? Or is it the direct product? Wait, in the question, it's written as G + H, which I think is the direct product. So in Statement 2, they're talking about Z_m and Z_n. 

Wait, Z_m is cyclic of order m, and Z_n is cyclic of order n. The direct product Z_m × Z_n would have order m*n. Now, the subgroup structure of Z_m × Z_n. I remember that in the case of cyclic groups, the direct product of two cyclic groups is cyclic if and only if their orders are coprime. Wait no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. 

Wait, the direct product of two cyclic groups is cyclic only if their orders are coprime. Otherwise, it's isomorphic to Z_l × Z_k where l and k are not coprime. So if r divides m and s divides n, then Z_r × Z_s would be a subgroup of Z_m × Z_n only if r and s are coprime. Because if not, then the direct product would have a rank higher than 1, I think. Wait, wait, no. For example, if m=4, n=6. Then Z_4 × Z_6 is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_3 × Z_1 (I think that's correct, but maybe I'm getting confused). Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the structure theorem for finite abelian groups.

Wait, Z_m × Z_n is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups. The structure theorem says that any finite abelian group is a direct sum of cyclic groups of prime power order. So, for Z_m × Z_n, if m and n are not coprime, then the group can be decomposed into smaller cyclic groups.

So, when does Z_m × Z_n contain a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r × Z_s? Well, for that to be true, the orders r and s must divide m and n respectively, but also, the subgroup must be possible structurally. I think that if r and s are coprime, then Z_r × Z_s can be embedded into Z_m × Z_n. Because then, you can have a subgroup where m is a multiple of r and n is a multiple of s, which is possible if r divides m and s divides n. Wait, but wait. Let me think of an example.

Take m=4, n=6. So Z_4 × Z_6. What's the order? 24. What's a subgroup isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_3? Well, Z_2 × Z_3 is isomorphic to Z_6. But can Z_6 be a subgroup of Z_4 × Z_6? Let's see. Wait, Z_4 × Z_6 is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_1 (I think that's correct, but perhaps I'm getting confused). Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of the structure. Wait, Z_6 can be a subgroup of Z_4 × Z_6.

Wait, for example, take the element (2, 4) in Z_4 × Z_6. The order of this element is the LCM of the orders of 2 in Z_4 and 4 in Z_6. The order of 2 in Z_4 is 2, and the order of 4 in Z_6 is 3. So LCM(2,3)=6. So yes, the element (2,4) has order 6, so the cyclic subgroup generated by it is isomorphic to Z_6. But wait, Z_6 is a subgroup of Z_4 × Z_6.

But wait, in this case, does Z_4 × Z_6 contain a subgroup isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_3? Because 2 and 3 are coprime, but could their product be embedded?

Wait, Z_2 × Z_3 would be a subgroup of order 6. So yes, Z_6 is a subgroup of order 6, which is 2×3. So in this case, Statement 2 would be true. But wait, is that always the case? Let me think of another example. Take m=6, n=4. So Z_6 × Z_4. Does it contain a subgroup isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_3?

Yes, because the same logic applies. The element (3, 2) in Z_6 × Z_4 has order LCM(2, 2) = 2. Wait, no, wait. Let me calculate the order correctly. The element (3, 2) in Z_6 × Z_4. The order of 3 in Z_6 is 2 (since 3*2=6 ≡ 0 mod 6), and the order of 2 in Z_4 is 2 (since 2*2=4 ≡0 mod 4). So the order of the element is LCM(2,2)=2. So the cyclic subgroup generated by (3,2) is of order 2, not 6. So in this case, the element's order is 2, so the subgroup generated by it is Z_2, not Z_6. So in this case, the subgroup is of order 2, which is Z_2, not Z_6. 

Wait, but the group order is 6×4=24. So the subgroup Z_6 × Z_4 has order 24. But in this case, the generated subgroup is order 2, which is not a multiple of 6. So that's a problem. Wait, so in this case, the subgroup generated by (3,2) is of order 2. So Statement 2 would be false for this example. But wait, in that case, m=6 and n=4. So r=2 divides m=6, s=3 divides n=4? No, wait, s=3 doesn't divide n=4. Because 4 divided by 3 is not an integer. So wait no, in the first example, r=2 divides m=4 (yes), and s=3 divides n=6 (yes). But in the second example, m=6, n=4. So r=2 divides 6 (yes), but s=3 doesn't divide 4 (since 4/3 is not an integer). So in that case, the subgroup generated by (3,2) is Z_2, which is not isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_3. So Statement 2 is false in this case.

So Statement 2 is not always true. So Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but let me clarify. The question says, "If r divides m and s divides n then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s." So in the first example, m=4, n=6. So r=2 divides 4, s=3 divides 6. So the subgroup exists, as in the example earlier. But in the second example, m=6, n=4. r=2 divides 6, s=3 divides 4? No, 3 doesn't divide 4. So the condition in Statement 2 is that r divides m and s divides n. So in this case, s=3 doesn't divide 4. So the condition is not met, so Statement 2 is false in that case.

So Statement 2 is not always true. Thus, Statement 2 is False.

Now, looking at the answer options. The question is about whether both statements are true or not.

Statement 1 is True, and Statement 2 is False.

Looking back at the options:

Option E: True, False → Answer: E is True, False.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are a list of possibilities.

The possible answers are:

A: False for all groups, True for all groups

B: False, False

C: False, True if G and H are not finite

D: False, True for finite groups only

E: True, False

F: True for all groups, False for all groups

G: True, False if r does not divide m and s does not divide n

H: True, True only if r divides m and s divides n

I: False, True

J: True, True

So the correct answer would be E: True, False.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the statements.

Statement 1: For finite G and H, |G+H|=|G||H|. Is this always true? Yes, because the internal direct product of finite groups has order equal to the product of their orders. So Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2: If r divides m and s divides n, then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s. As I found earlier, this is not always true. For instance, when m=6, n=4, r=2 divides 6, s=3 doesn't divide 4. So the condition in Statement 2 is not met, making Statement 2 false.

So, Statements 1 is true, 2 is false.

Looking at the options, E is True, False.

So the answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: True, False.
