Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Fuller needing to put fencing around his yard. The yard is rectangular, and the width is 55 feet, while the length is 75 feet. I need to figure out how many feet of fencing he needs.

Hmm, I remember that fencing around a rectangle would require calculating the perimeter. The perimeter is the total distance around the shape. For a rectangle, the formula for the perimeter is P = 2*(length + width). Let me think. So, first, I should add the length and the width together. 

Wait, the length is 75 feet and the width is 55 feet. Adding those together would be 75 + 55. Let me do that math. 75 plus 55 is 130. So that's 130 feet combined for length and width. But since the perimeter formula multiplies this sum by 2, I need to double that. So, 130 times 2 equals 260. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up length and width. Oh wait, no, the formula is correctâ€”2 times the sum. So, 2*(75+55) = 2*130 = 260. So, the total fencing needed is 260 feet.

Looking at the options, option D is 260. So the correct answer should be D.

The fencing required is the perimeter of the yard. Using the formula for a rectangle's perimeter (2*(length + width)), we calculate 2*(75 + 55) = 260 feet. The correct answer is D: 260.

Answer: D
