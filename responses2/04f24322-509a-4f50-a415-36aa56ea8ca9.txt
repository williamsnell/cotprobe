Alright, so I have this problem here about a circle and a square. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the equation given is 2x² = -2y² + 12x - 4y + 20. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can rearrange it into the standard form of a circle. I remember that the standard form of a circle is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius. 

Let me rewrite the equation to make it easier to work with. Starting with 2x² = -2y² + 12x - 4y + 20. I can move all the terms to one side to get everything on the left. So, adding 2y² to both sides, I get 2x² + 2y² = 12x - 4y + 20. 

Now, let's see. Maybe I should divide both sides by 2 to simplify. That would give me x² + y² = 6x - 2y + 10. Okay, that seems a bit better. 

Next, I need to complete the square for both x and y terms. Let's group the x terms and y terms together. So, x² - 6x + y² + 2y = 10. 

Starting with the x terms: x² - 6x. To complete the square, I take half of -6, which is -3, and square it, getting 9. So I add and subtract 9 for the x terms: (x² - 6x + 9) - 9.

For the y terms: y² + 2y. Half of 2 is 1, squared is 1. So I add and subtract 1: (y² + 2y + 1) - 1.

Putting it all together: (x² - 6x + 9) - 9 + (y² + 2y + 1) - 1 = 10. 

Simplify: (x - 3)² + (y + 1)² - 10 = 10. 

Wait, adding the constants: -9 -1 is -10. So, (x - 3)² + (y + 1)² -10 = 10. 

Adding 10 to both sides: (x - 3)² + (y + 1)² = 20. 

Okay, so the equation is now in standard form. That means the circle has center at (3, -1) and radius sqrt(20). 

Now, the problem says the circle is inscribed inside a square. When a circle is inscribed in a square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square. Because the circle touches all four sides of the square.

So, the diameter of the circle is twice the radius. The radius is sqrt(20), so the diameter is 2*sqrt(20). Therefore, the side length of the square is 2*sqrt(20). 

To find the area of the square, we square the side length. So, (2*sqrt(20))² = 4*20 = 80. 

Looking at the options, option C is 80, which matches our calculation. 

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

Starting from the original equation:
2x² = -2y² + 12x -4y +20.

Rearranged to: 2x² + 2y² = 12x -4y +20.

Divided by 2: x² + y² = 6x - 2y + 10.

Completing the square: (x² -6x) + (y² +2y) = 10.

Completing the square gives (x-3)^2 -9 + (y+1)^2 -1 = 10.

So, (x-3)^2 + (y+1)^2 = 20. 

Yes, radius is sqrt(20), diameter 2*sqrt(20). So side length of square is 2*sqrt(20), area is (2*sqrt(20))² = 4*20=80. So yes, option C is correct.

The given equation represents a circle inscribed in a square. After rearranging and completing the square, the circle has a radius of √20. The diameter, which equals the square's side, is 2√20. Thus, the area of the square is (2√20)² = 80.

Answer: C: 80
