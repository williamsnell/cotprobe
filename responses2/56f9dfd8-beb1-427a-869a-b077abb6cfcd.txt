Okay, so I've got this problem here about compound interest. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

So, James deposits $2,000 into an account that pays 4% per year, compounded quarterly. He keeps it for 2 years, and he doesn't withdraw any interest. The question is, how much will accumulate? The options are A to J, with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, I remember that compound interest means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal multiple times over the period. Since it's compounded quarterly, that means four times a year. So, the interest is calculated each quarter and added to the principal.

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount ($2,000 in this case).
- r is the annual interest rate (4%, so 0.04).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (quarterly, so 4).
- t is the time the money is invested for in years (2 years).

Let me plug in the numbers. So, P is 2000, r is 0.04, n is 4, and t is 2. 

First, I'll calculate r/n, which is 0.04 divided by 4. That's 0.01. So each quarter, the interest rate is 1% of the current amount.

Next, I need to calculate the exponent, which is nt. That's 4 times 2, which is 8. So, the interest compounds 8 times over the 2 years.

So, the formula becomes A = 2000 * (1 + 0.01)^8.

Let me compute 1 + 0.01 first, which is 1.01. Now, I need to raise 1.01 to the 8th power.

Wait, how do I calculate 1.01^8? Maybe I can compute it step by step. Let's see:

1.01^1 = 1.01
1.01^2 = 1.01 * 1.01 = 1.0201
1.01^3 = 1.0201 * 1.01 = 1.030301
1.01^4 = 1.030301 * 1.01 ≈ 1.04060401
1.01^5 = 1.04060401 * 1.01 ≈ 1.05101005
1.01^6 = 1.05101005 * 1.01 ≈ 1.06152015
1.01^7 = 1.06152015 * 1.01 ≈ 1.07213535
1.01^8 = 1.07213535 * 1.01 ≈ 1.0828567.

So, approximately 1.0828567.

Now multiply that by 2000. Let's calculate 2000 * 1.0828567.

2000 * 1 is 2000, 2000 * 0.0828567 is 2000 * 0.08 is 160, and 2000 * 0.0028567 is about 5.7134. So, 160 + 5.7134 = 165.7134. Adding that to 2000: 2000 + 165.7134 = 2165.7134.

Wait, but I think I might have miscalculated the decimal places. Let me double-check the exponent step.

Alternatively, I can use the formula more accurately. Let's calculate 1.01^8 precisely.

Using a calculator approach, I'll compute 1.01^8:

1.01^2 = 1.0201
1.01^4 = (1.0201)^2 = approximately 1.04060401
1.01^8 = (1.04060401)^2. Let me compute that:

1.04060401 * 1.04060401.

Let me multiply 1.04060401 by 1.04060401 step by step.

First, 1 * 1.04060401 = 1.04060401
0.04 * 1.04060401 = 0.0416241604
0.00060401 * 1.04060401 ≈ 0.000626 (approximations might be needed).

Adding these together: 1.04060401 + 0.0416241604 = 1.0822281704, plus 0.000626 gives approximately 1.082854.

So, 1.01^8 ≈ 1.082854.

Now, multiply by 2000: 2000 * 1.082854 = 2165.708.

Wait, so 2000 * 1.082854 = 2000 + (2000 * 0.082854).

2000 * 0.082854 = 2000 * 0.08 = 160, 2000 * 0.002854 = 5.708.

So, 160 + 5.708 = 165.708. Adding to 2000: 2000 + 165.708 = 2165.708.

So approximately $2,165.71.

Looking at the options, option I is $2,165.71. So the answer should be option I.

The correct answer is I: $2,165.71. This is calculated using the compound interest formula, where the amount accumulated is approximately $2,165.71 after 2 years with quarterly compounding.
