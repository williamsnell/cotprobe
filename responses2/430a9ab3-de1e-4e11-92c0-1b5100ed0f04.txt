Okay, so I've got this question about plant tissues and the one responsible for new growth. Hmm, I remember that plant tissues are divided into different types based on their function. Let me think, the options given include things like apical, sclerenchyma, ground, vascular, etc. 

Wait, I think the primary tissues that contribute to new growth are the parenchyma and collenchyma tissues. Parenchyma tissues are the cells in the xylem of leaves, right? They help transport water and minerals upward into the stem. And collenchyma tissues are in the tracheids of leaves, which are involved in the upward transport of gases, like O2 and CO2. Together, they handle the storage and release of water and carbon dioxide, which supports plant growth.

So the question is asking which tissue is responsible for new growth. So both parenchyma and collenchyma are involved. Looking at the options, option H is Parenchyma tissue, and option F is Collenchyma tissue. The question is a bit ambiguous in whether it's looking for one or both. But looking at the options, I think the question is expecting the primary answer, which is parenchyma. Because collenchyma is more about gas transport, but parenchyma is central to water and CO2 storage.

Alternatively, the question might be referring to the cells themselves, like the parenchyma and collenchyma cells. But the options don't have a separate cell option. So the tissues are what's responsible for growth, so the answer would be parenchyma tissue, which is option H.

The correct answer is **H: Parenchyma tissue**. Parenchyma tissues, including the parenchyma cells in leaves, are responsible for new growth by transporting water and carbon dioxide, which supports plant development.

Answer: H
