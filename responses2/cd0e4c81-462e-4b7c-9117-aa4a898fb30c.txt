Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. The question is asking me to find 1/6 plus 1/8. Hmm, I remember when adding fractions, they need to have the same denominator. Let me think about how to do that.

First, I need to find a common denominator for 6 and 8. The denominators are 6 and 8. What's the least common multiple of 6 and 8? Let's see, multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30... and multiples of 8 are 8, 16, 24, 32... Oh, right, 24 is the least common multiple. So the common denominator is 24.

Now, I'll convert each fraction to have 24 as the denominator. For 1/6, I multiply numerator and denominator by 4 because 6 times 4 is 24. So 1/6 becomes (1*4)/(6*4) = 4/24.

Next, for 1/8, I need to find how many times 8 goes into 24. That's 3 times, so I multiply numerator and denominator by 3. So 1/8 becomes (1*3)/(8*3) = 3/24.

Now I can add the two fractions: 4/24 + 3/24. Adding the numerators, 4 + 3 is 7. So the sum is 7/24.

Looking at the options, option E is 7 over 24. So that must be the correct answer.

The correct answer is E: 7 over 24.
