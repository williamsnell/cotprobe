Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says Umi created a number pattern by adding the same amount each time. The sequence given is 20, 40, 60, 80, and so on. They're asking what the eighth number in this pattern will be. The options are from A to J, with various numbers.

Hmm, okay, so first, I need to figure out what kind of pattern this is. The problem mentions that each time the same amount is added to get the next number. Oh, wait, that sounds like an arithmetic sequence. In arithmetic sequences, each term increases by a constant difference. So, I should find that common difference first.

Looking at the given numbers: 20, 40, 60, 80... Let me write them out to see the pattern.

Term 1: 20
Term 2: 40 → 40 - 20 = 20
Term 3: 60 → 60 - 40 = 20
Term 4: 80 → 80 - 60 = 20
Term 5: 100 → 100 - 80 = 20

So, the common difference here is 20. That means each term is 20 more than the previous one. So, this is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference (d) of 20.

The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:
a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d

Where:
- a_n is the nth term,
- a_1 is the first term,
- d is the common difference,
- n is the term number.

We need the eighth term, so n=8.

Plugging in the values:

a_8 = 20 + (8 - 1) * 20
Simplify (8-1) to 7:
a_8 = 20 + 7 * 20
7 *20 is 140.
So, a_8 = 20 + 140 = 160.

Looking at the options, option C is 160. So the answer should be C.
</think>

The pattern is arithmetic with a common difference of 20. Using the formula aₙ = a₁ + (n−1)d:

a₈ = 20 + (8−1)×20 = 20 + 140 = 160.

**Answer:** C: 160

Answer: C
