Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says, "How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100?" And then there are several options to choose from. Hmm, I need to figure out how many numbers are in this sequence.

Wait, I remember something about counting numbers in a sequence. It's like if you have a list starting at a certain number and ending at another, you can find the total count by subtracting the starting number from the ending number and then adding one. Oh right, because both the start and end are included.

So in this case, the sequence starts at 25 and ends at 100. Let me write that down: starting number is 25, ending number is 100. The formula is probably (ending - starting) + 1. Let me calculate that.

100 minus 25 is 75. Then adding one gives me 76. So that's 76 numbers. Looking back at the options, option I is 76. So I think the answer should be I:76.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes people get confused whether to add or subtract. Let me think again. If I have numbers from 1 to 5, that's 5 numbers. Using the formula, 5-1+1=5. So yes, correct. So for 25 to 100, it's 100-25+1=76. So option I is 76, which should be the correct answer.

The number of numbers in the sequence from 25 to 100 is calculated by subtracting the starting number from the ending number and adding one. 

100 - 25 + 1 = 76.

Thus, the correct answer is **I: 76**.
