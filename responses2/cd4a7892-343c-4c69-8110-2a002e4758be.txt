Question:

The Latino American Party was founded and chartered in a state to promote the political power of Latino Americans. Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after the defeats in a recent election, the Party expelled all nonLatino members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Latinos could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party's nominees. Membership is currently confined to Latinos. In every election since, the Party's nominees have easily won election in their Congressional District. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own Latino candidate for governor of New Mexico in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poil. In an action by non-Latino citizens in the relevantCongressional District to enjoin the Latino AmericanParty from conducting the mail ballot primary, thefederal court will most likely

Options:

A: deny relief, because the Party's primary would be private action and not subject to restriction under the Constitution.
B: grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Thirteenth Amendment.
C: deny relief, because a pre-primary election is not within the scope of federal election control.
D: grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Seventeenth Amendment.
E: grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Fifteenth Amendment.
F: grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the First Amendment.
G: deny relief, because the primary would be upheld by the Nineteenth Amendment.
H: deny relief, because the political party has the right to choose its own members.
I: deny relief, because the primary would be upheld by the Tenth Amendment.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Latino American Party and a court case affecting their primary election. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the question is about the impact of a non-Latino citizen suing the Latino American Party (LAP) for restricting mail-ballot primaries. The options relate to constitutional issues, like Thirteenth Amendment proscription, Thirteenth Amendment relief, Thirteenth vs. Fourteenth Amendment relief, etc.

I think the key here is the Thirteenth Amendment, which was passed in 1904. The Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from passing laws that would "favor" any class of citizens unless the law is specifically provided for. So, if a state uses a mail ballot primary to elect its owngx, it might be considered as favoring non-Latinos because it's not a regular election.

Wait, but the question mentions the U.S. Congress in New Mexico. So, the Lap Party is proposing to choose their own Latino candidate for governor, and the Executive Committee is suggesting they put their slate for U.S. representatives, governor, and U.S. senators on the mail ballot, along with any rivals. So, they're trying to establish a primary system without a traditional election, which could be seen as favoring non-Latinos since it's a private election.

But wait, the Lap Party was founded to only vote for their party's nominees. So, if they're using a mail ballot, that's their own system. Now, the non-Latinos are suing to block this, arguing that it's a private election and thus doesn't get the protections of the Thirteenth Amendment.

I remember that the Thirteenth Amendment applies to any state, so if a state is using such a private election, it's essentially favoring non-Latinos. But in the U.S., there's the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits states from using private elections without a public election. Wait, but the Fourteenth is about states not using private elections, but the Thirteenth is about the right to establish their own system, I think. Or maybe the Thirteenth Amendment is more about the right to establish, but when a state uses a private system, it's against the Thirteenth.

Wait, let me think again. The Thirteenth Amendment says states can't use laws that favor them unless the law is specifically provided for. But a private election (like a mail ballot primary) is a private action. So, if a state is using a private system, they are effectively favoring non-Latinos. So, the Lap Party would be considered to have "favoring" the non-Latinos because it's a private election.

But the Lap Party, as the party, is allowed to define their own election systems. So, if they're using a private system, is that considered a private action? Or is it a state action? Wait, the Thirteenth Amendment applies to states' actions, not the federal government. So, the Lap Party's actions as a state would fall under Thirteenth Amendment protection if they opt for a private system. But the question is about the U.S. Congress, which is the federal level.

Wait, the question says the Executive Committee is proposing that the Party choose its own candidate for governor. So, they're moving from a party system to a federal election system. So, the Lap Party is using a mail ballot primary as a way to elect their own elected officials. But under the Thirteenth Amendment, a state's private actions are protected, but the Thirteenth is about states' actions, not federal actions. So, the Lap Party's election system is within the federal government, not a state action.

But wait, the Thirteenth Amendment applies to states' actions. So, if a state uses a private system, that's a state action, which would be protected by Thirteenth Amendment. But the Lap Party is using a state action (their own system) as part of the federal election process. So, their primary would be a state action, and thus protected under Thirteenth Amendment.

Alternatively, the Thirteenth Amendment might not apply if the state is using their own system, but the Thirteenth is about the state's election methods, not the federal election system. So, if the state is using a private system, that's state action, and that's protected. But since the Lap Party is a state, they have the right to define their own election methods, including private systems, as long as they comply with the Thirteenth Amendment.

Wait, but the Thirteenth Amendment is about the state's actions. So, if a state is using a private primary, that's a state action, and therefore protected. But the Lap Party is part of that state, so their system would be a state action. So, the Lap Party's initiative would be protected under Thirteenth Amendment.

But the question is about the court's relief. The options relate to the Thirteenth Amendment proscription or relief.

Wait, the Thirteenth Amendment prohibits states from providing any law that would favor any class of citizens unless it is specifically provided for. So, if a state is using a private system, that's a state action, and the Lap Party's election system would be a state action. So, the court would find that the Lap Party is in violation, as their system is a private action. But wait, the Thirteenth Amendment doesn't directly prohibit private actions. It only prohibits states from using laws that favor them without such provision. So, if the state is using a private system, that's a state action, which is protected, so the Lap Party's system is not a violation.

Wait, but the Thirteenth Amendment also applies to the federal government. Oh wait, no. The Thirteenth Amendment specifically applies to states' actions. The federal government, including the U.S. Congress, is separate. So, the Thirteenth Amendment doesn't apply to the federal government.

So, if the Lap Party is using a private system, that's a state action, so it's protected under Thirteenth Amendment. But since the issue here is about a state, the Lap Party's election system is a state action, so it's protected. But wait, in this case, the Lap Party is the state, so their system is a state action, so they are protected.

Wait, but the question is about whether relief is granted. So, the court would find that the Lap Party's system is a private action and is protected, but since they're using a private action, perhaps the court would allow it, or deny relief.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to approach this differently.

The key issue is whether the Lap Party's election method violates the Thirteenth Amendment. If their primary is a private action, then it's a state action, which is protected. But since the Thirteenth Amendment doesn't apply to the federal government, the court would have to decide whether the Lap Party's action is a private action within the state. If it's a private action, then it's protected, so no relief is granted. Alternatively, if the Lap Party is not a state, then their election system could be a federal action, which might not be protected under Thirteenth.

Wait, the Lap Party is a state organization. So, their election system is a state action. So, the Thirteenth Amendment applies. Therefore, if the state is using a private system, the Lap Party's system would be protected. So, the court would find no relief because the Lap Party is not violating the Thirteenth Amendment.

But wait, the options are about granting relief. The options are whether relief is grantedâ€”i.e., whether the Lap Party is allowed to hold the election as a state action.

Wait, no, the Thirteenth Amendment says states can't use laws that favor them unless the law is specifically provided for. So, if a state is using a private primary, is that a state action? Because a state action is when a state makes a law that benefits its citizens. So, a private primary is a state action because the state is using a private method. Therefore, the Lap Party is in violation because they're using a state action (their own system) which is a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment.

Wait, but Thirteenth Amendment protects states from private actions that would favor them unless the law is specifically provided for. So, if the Lap Party's system is considered a state action, then they're violating the Thirteenth Amendment because their system is a private action. Therefore, the court would deny relief (i.e., the Lap Party is in violation, so they can't hold the election as a private action), but the options suggest whether relief is granted or denied.

Wait, but the options are about whether relief is granted. The options given are about whether relief is granted, like whether the Lap Party can hold the election as a private action.

If the Lap Party is using a private system, that's a state action, so under Thirteenth Amendment, it's a violation. Therefore, the court would deny relief, meaning they can't hold the election as a private action. So, the Lap Party can't hold the election for the reasons outlined.

But the options don't directly state that. Let's look again.

Option E says: "grant relief, because the primary would be upheld by the Tenth Amendment."

Wait, the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Fourteenth is about state action, Thirteenth is about state's actions. So, if a state is using a private system, that's a state action and is protected under Thirteenth. But the Lap Party is part of the state, so their system is a state action, hence protected.

So, in this context, the Lap Party's system is a state action, thus protected under Thirteenth Amendment. Therefore, they are not violating. So, the court would not grant relief, meaning that the Lap Party can hold the election as a private action, so relief is not granted.

Looking at the options, the options that say no relief (i.e., the party is allowed) would be options that don't grant relief. Wait, the options are about granting reliefâ€”so if the Lap Party is allowed, they get relief; if not, they don't.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

If the Lap Party's system is a state action, then under Thirteenth Amendment, it's protected. So, the court would find no violation. So, they can hold the election as a private action, thus no relief is granted.

Looking at the options:

Options A: deny relief because it's private.
Options B: grant relief because proscribed by Thirteenth.
Options C: deny because pre-primary is not federal.
Options D and E: grant relief based on Thirteenth or Fourteenth.

Wait, the Thirteenth Amendment proscribes states from using laws that favor them unless it's specifically provided for. So, if the state is using a private system, that's a violation. Hence, the court would deny relief.

So, the answer options would be that the court denies relief (i.e., the Lap Party is allowed to hold the election as a private action).

Wait, but the options are about whether relief is granted. The options are:

E.g., E: grant relief because the primary is upheld by the Tenth.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the Tenth. The Tenth Amendment prohibits states from using a private election without a public one. So, if a state is using a private primary, that's a violation. But the Thirteenth is about state's actions, not the federal level.

So, the Thirteenth Amendment would apply to the Lap Party's private system, meaning it's a violation. So, the court would deny relief, meaning the Lap Party can't hold the election as a private action. Therefore, they get relief.

Wait, but the options don't all talk about Thirteenth or Fourteenth. Let me see the options again.

The options are:

A: deny relief, private action
B: grant relief, Thirteenth proscribed
C: deny relief, pre-primary not federal
D: grant relief, Thirteenth proscribed
E: grant relief, Tenth proscribed

Wait, the options are about what the court does. So, if the Lap Party is allowed (no relief granted), then the court would say no. Or if they can't hold it, they get relief.

But the Lap Party is the state, so their system is a state action, thus protected under Thirteenth.

So, the court would find no violation. Hence, they can hold the election as a private action, so no relief is granted.

Looking at the options, which ones say that the party can hold the election (no relief)?

Looking at the options, option E says "grant relief, because the primary would be upheld by the Tenth Amendment." But the Tenth is about private actions, not the Thirteenth.

Wait, the Tenth is about private elections (like the U.S. states don't use private elections unless they have a public one). So, if a state is using a private primary, the Tenth would apply, and the state is violating it. But that's a state action, so under Thirteenth, which is a federal issue.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

The Lap Party's system is a state action, so under Thirteenth Amendment, it's protected. Therefore, the court would not grant relief, meaning the Lap Party can hold the election as a private action, so they don't need relief. So, the options that say "grant relief" would be those that are incorrect, but which ones are correct?

Wait, the options are about whether relief is granted. So, the correct scenario is that the Lap Party is allowed to hold the election as a private system, so no relief is needed.

So, looking for an option that says "grant relief" is incorrect. So, the options that grant relief would be options B, C, D, E.

But the correct answer is that they are allowed, so no relief is needed. So, which option says that?

Looking at the options:

E: grant relief, because the primary is upheld by Tenth.

Wait, the Tenth is about state actions using private elections, so if the Lap Party is using a private system, the Tenth proscribes it, but that's a state action. So, the Tenth would apply, but under Thirteenth, the state action is protected.

Wait, perhaps the Thirteenth Amendment only applies to state actions, not federal actions. So, if the Lap Party is part of the state, their system is a state action, which is protected under Thirteenth. So, the court would deny relief, which is the situation.

So, the correct option would be one that says "deny relief" (i.e., the party is allowed to hold the election as a private action). Looking at the options, options A, B, C, D, and E.

Wait, but none of the options directly say "deny relief because the primary is held as a private action." Let me look again.

The options are:

A: deny relief, because the primary would be private
B: grant relief, because proscribed by Thirteenth
C: deny relief, pre-primary not federal
D: grant relief, Thirteenth proscribed
E: grant relief, Tenth proscribed

Wait, the correct scenario is that the Lap Party's system is a state action, which is protected under Thirteenth, so no relief is needed. Therefore, the court denies relief, meaning they can hold the election as a private system. So, the answer is that relief is denied, so they get relief. Wait, noâ€”relief would mean no action needed. If the Lap Party is allowed, no relief is needed.

Wait, but the options are phrased as whether relief is granted. So, the options are about whether relief is grantedâ€”i.e., whether the party can hold the election as a private system.

If the court finds they can, then relief is not granted. So, the options that say "deny relief" would be the correct one.

Looking at the options, which options say that?

Option A: deny relief because it's a private system.

Option E: grant relief because the primary is upheld by the Tenth.

But the Tenth applies to state actions, which is what the Lap Party is doing. So, the court applies the Thirteenth Amendment, which protects their system, so they can hold the election as a private system, so no relief is needed.

So, the correct option is A: deny relief, because the primary would be private.

Wait, but wait. The Thirteenth Amendment would not apply to a federal action, only to state actions. So, the Lap Party's system is a state action, so under Thirteenth, it's protected. So, the court would not find any violation, thus they can hold the election as a private primary, so no relief is needed.

So, the correct answer would be that they are allowed, so no relief is needed. Thus, the correct option is that the court denies relief, meaning they can hold the election as a private system. So, which option says that?

Looking at the options again, option A says "deny relief because the primary would be private." That's correct, as the court would deny relief because the primary is a private action, which is protected under Thirteenth Amendment. So, the court would not grant relief, meaning no action is needed, so they can hold the election.

Wait, but the options are phrased as whether relief is granted. The options are about what the court does. So, if the court denies relief, that means the party can hold the election as a private system.

So, the correct answer is that the court denies relief because the Lap Party's system is a state action, protected under Thirteenth Amendment. So, the answer is option A: deny relief because the primary would be private action.

Wait, no, because the Lap Party is the state, so their system is a state action, which is protected under Thirteenth. So, the court would not grant relief, meaning the party can hold the election. So, the correct answer is that they can hold it, so the correct answer is option A.

But wait, the options say whether the relief is grantedâ€”so, the options are about whether the party is allowed to hold the election as a private system.

So, the correct answer is that the court denies relief because the primary is a private action, which is protected under Thirteenth Amendment. So, the party can hold the election, so no relief is needed. So, the correct option is option A: deny relief because the primary would be private.

Wait, but that's conflicting because the party is the state, so their system is a state action, which is protected under Thirteenth Amendment. Thus, they can hold the election as a private system. So, the court denies relief because they are allowed to hold it as a private system.

Wait, but the options are phrased as whether the party gets relief. So, the options say whether the party can hold the election as a private system. The correct option would be one that says no relief is needed, meaning the party can hold it.

Looking at the options:

A: deny relief, primary is private action. So, the party can hold the election, so no relief is needed.

B: grant relief, proscribed by Thirteenth.

C: deny relief, pre-primary not federal.

D: grant relief, proscribed by Thirteenth.

E: grant relief, proscribed by Tenth.

So, the correct scenario is that the court denies relief because the primary is a private system, which is protected under Thirteenth Amendment. So, the party can hold the election, so no relief is needed.

So, which option says that the party can hold the election (no relief needed)? That would be option A, but wait, option A says "deny relief, because the primary would be private."

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the Lap Party's system is not protected because it's a federal action. But that's not correct under Thirteenth Amendment.

Wait, another angle: The Thirteenth Amendment proscribes states from using laws that favor them unless the law is specifically provided for. So, if a state is using a private system, that's a state action, which is protected. So, the court would not grant relief, meaning the party can hold the election.

Thus, the correct answer is option A: deny relief, because the primary would be private.

Wait, no, because the party is the state, so the options are about whether they can hold the election as a private system. So, the correct scenario is that the court denies relief because the party can hold the election as a private system, so no relief is needed. So, the answer is option A.

Wait, I'm getting myself into a twist. Let me try to summarize:

- The Lap Party is a state.
- Under the Thirteenth Amendment, states can't use laws that favor them unless the law is specifically provided for.
- A state using a private system is a state action, which is protected under the Thirteenth Amendment.
- Therefore, the Lap Party can hold the election as a private system, so no relief is needed.
- So, the correct answer is option A: deny relief, because the primary would be private.
</think>

The Lap Party, as a state, presents a scenario where its election system is a state action, protected under the Thirteenth Amendment. This amendment prohibits states from using laws that favor them unless the law is specifically provided for. Since the Lap Party's system is a state action, it is protected under the Thirteenth Amendment, meaning the court would not grant relief and the Lap Party could hold the election as a private system.

ANSWER: A
