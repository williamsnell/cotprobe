Okay, so I've got this question here about absolute values, and I need to figure out which number has an absolute value greater than 5. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, I remember that the absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, without considering direction. So, whether the number is positive or negative, its absolute value is always positive. That makes sense.

The question is asking which number has an absolute value greater than 5. So I need to look for numbers that are either 6, 7, or higher in absolute value. Wait, actually, since it's greater than 5, the absolute values could be 6, 7, 8, etc., but the options provided only go up to -5, so I'll check each option.

Let me list out all the options again to make it clear:

A: 0
B: 2
C: -4
D: 3
E: 4
F: -2
G: -6
H: 5
I: -3
J: -5

Now, I'll calculate the absolute value for each:

- A: 0 → absolute value is 0. That's less than 5.
- B: 2 → absolute value is 2. Still less than 5.
- C: -4 → absolute value is 4. Hmm, 4 is less than 5.
- D: 3 → absolute value is 3. Less than 5.
- E: 4 → absolute value is 4. Again, less than 5.
- F: -2 → absolute value is 2. Still below 5.
- G: -6 → absolute value is 6. Oh, that's more than 5.
- H: 5 → absolute value is 5. Equal to 5, but not greater.
- I: -3 → absolute value is 3. Less than 5.
- J: -5 → absolute value is 5. Again, equal to 5.

So, looking through each option, only option G (-6) has an absolute value of 6, which is greater than 5. The other options all have absolute values at most 5, except G which is 6. 

Wait, did I check all? Let me go through again quickly.

A) 0 → 0 → no
B)2→2→no
C)-4→4→no
D)3→3→no
E)4→4→no
F)-2→2→no
G)-6→6→yes
H)5→5→no
I)-3→3→no
J)-5→5→no

Yes, only G fits. So the correct answer should be G.

The number with an absolute value greater than 5 is -6, as its absolute value is 6. 

Answer: G
