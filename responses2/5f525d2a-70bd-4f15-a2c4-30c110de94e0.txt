Okay, so I've got this question about color perception. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says that a piece of paper appears blue in sunlight. Then it's illuminated only by a red light that goes through a green filter. I need to determine what color the paper appears under this new light.

Wait, I remember that when light passes through certain filters, it changes. Like, red light goes through a red filter, and green goes through a green filter. But if it's passing red through a green filter, what happens? Oh right, that's called a transparency filter or maybe a transmission filter. So the green filter would let through green light and block the red part. So the light that comes out would be green.

But wait, the paper itself appears blue. Oh, because blue is a combination of red and green. Maybe the color of the paper is a mixture of red and green. So when the light passes through the green filter, does the paper's color change? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the paper's color is determined by the light that's coming through the filter. So the paper is illuminated with green light. But wait, the question says the paper was already appearing blue, which is a mix of red and green. So if the light is green, perhaps the paper's color would be green? But that's not an option. Wait, no, the options provided include blue, purple, black, red, etc.

Wait, wait. Another approach. When light is shone through a filter, the color appears as the transmitted light. So if the paper was blue in sunlight, maybe it's because the light is a mix of red and green. So when you pass red through a green filter, the transmitted light would be green. But the paper's color is based on the incident light, right? Or no, the paper's color is determined by the light that's bouncing off it. So when the light is green, the paper should appear green. But the options don't have green.

Wait, the question states that the paper appears blue when illuminated with sunlight. That suggests that the paper is made of a mix of red and green. So when sunlight (which has red and green) is shone through a green filter, the transmitted light is green. So the paper's color is green. But looking at the options, green isn't an option. The options are A to J with various colors.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Oh wait, maybe when light passes through a green filter, the transmitted light is green, but the paper's color is determined by the light that's reflecting off it. So if the paper is made of a combination of red and green, the reflection would be blue. But now the light is green, so the transmitted light is green. So would the paper appear green?

Looking at the options, green isn't an option. Hmm. Wait, let me read the question again. It says the paper appears blue in sunlight. Oh, blue is a result of the combination of red and green. So when the light is red, the transmitted light is red, but when it's green, it's green. So passing red through green filter would make the paper appear green. But the options don't have green. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, another angle: the paper's color is blue. So when it's illuminated with light that passes through a green filter, what color would it appear? Because the filter would let through green light. But the paper appears blue in sunlight, which is red plus green. So if the light is green, the transmitted light is green, but the paper's color comes from the light reflecting off it. So the paper would appear green. But that's not an option. So maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the process is that the paper's color is determined by the light that comes through the filter. So when the light is green, the transmitted light is green, so the paper's color is green. But that's not an option. So maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the process is that the paper's color is determined by the light that's reflecting. So when the light is green, the paper's surface reflects red and green, making it appear blue. But how does that tie into the filter?

Wait, no, the problem says the paper appears blue in sunlight. So the sunlight's light is a mixture of red and green. So the paper's color is a blend of red and green. Now, if the light is green, it's purely green. So the transmitted light is green. But the paper's color is determined by the incident color. So the paper would appear green. But the options don't have green. Wait, looking at the options, option H is Magenta. Wait, no, wait the options are:

Options are:

A: White

B: Purple

C: Black

D: Red

E: Blue

F: Yellow

G: Cyan

H: Magenta

I: Green

J: Orange

Wait, I didn't see green in the options. Wait, no: looking again, the options go up to J, which is Orange. Oh, wait, no, option I is Green. So if the paper appears blue, that's a combination of red and green. So when the light is green, the transmitted light is green, so the paper would appear green. But that's not an option. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the problem says the paper appears blue in sunlight. So the light is a mix of red and green. When it's passed through a green filter, the transmitted light is green. So the paper's color is determined by the light that's hitting it. So the paper's color would be green. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the transmitted light is green, but the paper's color is based on the transmitted light. So the paper would appear green. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the transmitted light is green, but the color of the paper is green. But the options don't include green.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm confusing transmission and reflection. The question says the paper is illuminated solely by a red light that passes through a green filter. So the light is red, but it's passing through a green filter. So the transmitted light is green. But the paper's color is determined by the incident light, which is red. But that doesn't make sense because the transmitted light is green.

Alternatively, the transmitted light is green, so the paper appears green. But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the filter changes the color of the transmitted light. So the paper's color is determined by the transmitted light, which is green. So the paper would appear green. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, perhaps the question is about the color of the paper when the light is red. The paper's color is blue because the light is red and green. Now, when the light is through a green filter, the transmitted light is green. So the paper's color would be green. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the transmitted light is green, but the paper's color is green. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is magenta. No, wait, the options list H is Magenta. But why would that happen?

Wait, another approach. When a red filter is used, the transmitted light is red. If it's a green filter, the transmitted light is green. But the paper is made of a mixture of red and green, so when the light is green, the transmitted light is green. So the paper appears green. But the options don't have green.

Wait, am I making a mistake here? Let me check the options again. The options are A to J, with I being Green. So if the paper appears green, that would be option I. So perhaps the answer is I. But the question says the paper appeared blue in sunlight. So the light that hits it is a mix of red and green. When you pass red through green, the transmitted light is green. So the paper would appear green. But that's an option. So perhaps it's option I: Green.

Wait, but why would the paper appear green? Because the transmitted light is green. So the paper's color would be green. So the answer is option I: Green.

Wait, but the options list I as Green. So the correct answer would be I: Green.

To determine the color of the paper when illuminated with a red light passing through a green filter, we analyze the situation:

1. **Initial Condition**: The paper appears blue in sunlight. Blue is a combination of red and green light, indicating that the paper is made of a mixture of these colors.

2. **Effect of the Green Filter**: When light passes through a green filter, it blocks the red component and allows the green component to pass through. Therefore, the transmitted light is green.

3. **Paper's Color Determination**: The color of the paper is determined by the light that reflects off it. Since the transmitted light is green, the paper appears green.

4. **Options Analysis**: The options provided include "Green" (Option I). Since the paper appears green under the new illumination, the correct answer is "Green."
