Okay, so I have this calculus problem here about finding the arc length of the function y = (1/4)x^4 from x=1 to x=2 using the Trapezoidal Rule T5. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, I remember that the formula for arc length of a function y = f(x) from a to b is the integral from a to b of sqrt(1 + (f’(x))^2) dx. So, I need to compute the derivative of y with respect to x. Let me find that.

y = (1/4)x^4, so dy/dx = (1/4)*4x^3 = x^3. So, (f’(x))^2 is (x^3)^2, which is x^6.

So the integrand for the arc length is sqrt(1 + x^6). Therefore, the integral we need to compute is ∫ (from 1 to 2) sqrt(1 + x^6) dx.

Now, since this integral doesn't have an elementary antiderivative, we have to approximate it numerically. The question specifies using the Trapezoidal Rule with T5, which means we divide the interval [1,2] into 5 subintervals, each of width h. 

Wait, right, the Trapezoidal Rule formula is T_n = (h/2) [f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + ... + 2f(x_{n-1}) + f(xn)]. So, for n=5, the interval length is 1 (from 1 to 2), so h = (2-1)/5 = 0.2.

So the points x0, x1,...x5 would be:

x0 = 1.0
x1 = 1.2
x2 = 1.4
x3 = 1.6
x4 = 1.8
x5 = 2.0

Each of these is spaced by 0.2 apart.

Now, I need to compute f(x) at each of these points, where f(x) is sqrt(1 + x^6).

Let's compute f(x) for each x.

Starting with x0 =1.0:
x^6 =1^6=1. So, 1 +1=2. sqrt(2)= approx 1.4142.

x1=1.2:
x^6 = (1.2)^6. Let's compute that. 1.2 squared is 1.44. Cubed is 1.728. Then 1.728 *1.44 = let's see: 1.728 *1 is 1.728, 1.728 *0.4 is 0.6912, so total 2.4192. Then 1.2^3 is 1.728, 1.2^4 is 2.0736 (1.728 *1.2), 1.2^5 is 2.48832, 1.2^6 is 2.985984. So 1 + 2.985984 is 3.985984. sqrt(3.985984) is approximately 1.9965 (since 2^2=4, so a bit less than 2). Let me calculate it more precisely: 1.9965 squared is (approx 2 - 0.0035)^2. 2^2 is 4, subtract 2*2*0.0035=0.014 and add (0.0035)^2=0.00001225. So 4 -0.014 +0.00001225 = 3.98601225, which is a bit above 3.985984. So maybe 1.9965 is a little over. Alternatively, perhaps we can approximate it as 1.9965 - (approx 0.000028). Hmm, maybe I'll just take it as about 1.9965 for now.

x2=1.4: Let's compute 1.4^6. Let's compute step by step.

1.4^2 = 1.96.

1.4^3 = 1.96 *1.4 = 2.744.

1.4^4 = 2.744 *1.4 = 3.8416.

1.4^5 =3.8416 *1.4 = approximately 5.37824.

1.4^6 =5.37824 *1.4 = 7.529536.

So 1+7.529536 =8.529536. sqrt(8.529536) is about 2.9207 (because 2.92^2 is approximately 8.5264, which is close to 8.529536). So maybe 2.9207.

x3=1.6:

Compute 1.6^6. Let's calculate:

1.6^2=2.56.

1.6^3=2.56 *1.6=4.096.

1.6^4=4.096 *1.6=6.5536.

1.6^5=6.5536 *1.6=10.48576.

1.6^6=10.48576 *1.6=16.777216.

So 1 +16.777216=17.777216. sqrt(17.777216)= approximately 4.216 (since 4.216^2 is about 17.77). Let's compute 4.216^2: 4^2=16, 0.216^2=0.046656, 2*4*0.216=1.728. So total 16+1.728 +0.046656=17.774656. That's very close to 17.777216. So 4.216^2 is 17.774656, which is a bit less than 17.777216. The difference is 17.777216-17.774656=0.00256. To get the difference in sqrt: Let me think, the derivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2sqrt(x)). So, at x=17.774656, the derivative is 1/(2*4.216)=approx 0.1186. The delta x is 0.00256, so the delta y is approximately 0.00256 * 0.1186 ≈ 0.000306. So sqrt(17.777216)≈4.216 + 0.0003≈4.2163.

Wait, but perhaps I don't need to be too precise here because we're only using the Trapezoidal Rule, which is an approximation. So perhaps I can just take each f(xi) as the approximate value.

x4=1.8:

1.8^6. Let's compute step by step.

1.8^2=3.24.

1.8^3=3.24 *1.8=5.832.

1.8^4=5.832 *1.8=10.4976.

1.8^5=10.4976 *1.8=18.89568.

1.8^6=18.89568 *1.8=34.002224.

So 1 +34.002224=35.002224. sqrt(35.002224) is approximately 5.916 (since 5.916^2= (5.9)^2 + 2*5.9*0.016 + (0.016)^2 )=34.81 + 0.1904 + 0.000256=35.000656. That's very close to 35.002224. So maybe 5.916 + a little more. The difference is 35.002224-35.000656=0.001568. The derivative of sqrt(x) at 35 is 1/(2*5.916)≈0.0848. So delta x is 0.001568, so delta y ≈0.001568 * 0.0848 ≈0.000133. So sqrt(35.002224)≈5.916 +0.000133≈5.9161. So approximately 5.9161.

x5=2.0. Let's compute f(2):

f(2)=sqrt(1 + (2)^6)=sqrt(1 +64)=sqrt(65)=approx8.0623. Because 8^2=64, 8.0623^2=65.000, so perhaps exactly 8.0622577...

So, let's list all the f(xi) values:

x0=1.0 → 1.4142

x1=1.2 → approx 1.9965

x2=1.4 → approx 2.9207

x3=1.6 → approx 4.2163

x4=1.8 → approx 5.9161

x5=2.0 → approx8.0623

Now, the Trapezoidal Rule formula is T5 = (h/2) [f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + 2f(x3) + 2f(x4) + f(x5)]

Wait, because n=5. So, n is the number of subintervals, so the number of terms is n+1. So, in this case, it's 5+1=6 terms. So the formula is (h/2) * [f(x0) + 2(f(x1)+f(x2)+f(x3)+f(x4)) + f(x5)].

So let's compute the sum inside.

Compute each term:

f(x0)=1.4142

2*f(x1)=2*(1.9965)=3.993

2*f(x2)=2*(2.9207)=5.8414

2*f(x3)=2*(4.2163)=8.4326

2*f(x4)=2*(5.9161)=11.8322

f(x5)=8.0623

Now sum them all:

1.4142 + 3.993 +5.8414 +8.4326 +11.8322 +8.0623

Let me compute step by step:

Start with 1.4142:

+3.993 → 5.4072

+5.8414 →5.4072 +5.8414 = 11.2486

+8.4326 →11.2486 +8.4326 =19.6812

+11.8322 →19.6812 +11.8322=31.5134

+8.0623 →31.5134 +8.0623=39.5757

So the sum inside the brackets is 39.5757. Multiply by h/2, which is (0.2)/2=0.1.

So T5 = 0.1 *39.5757=3.95757.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option H:3.958. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me check the f(xi) values again, especially f(x4) and f(x5). Because if I made a mistake in f(x4), the calculations would be off.

Wait, f(x4)=1.8^6=34.002224, so sqrt(35.002224)=approx5.9161, which I think is correct.

Wait, another check: for x5=2.0, f(x5)=sqrt(1 +64)=sqrt(65)=8.0622577...

So, perhaps the exact sum is 39.5757, multiplied by 0.1 gives 3.95757. Rounded to three decimal places, 3.958. So option H.

Looking at the options, option H is 3.958, so that's probably the correct answer.

To find the arc length of \( y = \frac{1}{4}x^4 \) over the interval \([1, 2]\) using the Trapezoidal Rule \( T_5 \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Arc Length Formula**: The arc length \( L \) of a function \( y = f(x) \) from \( a \) to \( b \) is given by:
   \[
   L = \int_a^b \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2} \, dx
   \]
   For \( y = \frac{1}{4}x^4 \), \( \frac{dy}{dx} = x^3 \), so \( \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2 = x^6 \). Thus, the integrand becomes:
   \[
   \sqrt{1 + x^6}
   \]
   Hence, the integral to compute is:
   \[
   \int_1^2 \sqrt{1 + x^6} \, dx
   \]

2. **Trapezoidal Rule**: The Trapezoidal Rule approximates the integral using the formula:
   \[
   T_n = \frac{h}{2} \left[ f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + \dots + 2f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n) \right]
   \]
   where \( h = \frac{b - a}{n} \). For \( n = 5 \), \( h = \frac{2 - 1}{5} = 0.2 \), and the points \( x_0, x_1, \dots, x_5 \) are:
   \[
   x_0 = 1.0, \, x_1 = 1.2, \, x_2 = 1.4, \, x_3 = 1.6, \, x_4 = 1.8, \, x_5 = 2.0
   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f(x_i) \)**:
   - \( f(x_0) = \sqrt{1 + 1^6} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142 \)
   - \( f(x_1) = \sqrt{1 + 1.2^6} \approx 1.9965 \)
   - \( f(x_2) = \sqrt{1 + 1.4^6} \approx 2.9207 \)
   - \( f(x_3) = \sqrt{1 + 1.6^6} \approx 4.2163 \)
   - \( f(x_4) = \sqrt{1 + 1.8^6} \approx 5.9161 \)
   - \( f(x_5) = \sqrt{1 + 2.0^6} = \sqrt{65} \approx 8.0623 \)

4. **Apply Trapezoidal Rule**:
   \[
   T_5 = \frac{0.2}{2} \left[ 1.4142 + 2(1.9965 + 2.9207 + 4.2163 + 5.9161) + 8.0623 \right]
   \]
   Compute the sum inside:
   \[
   1.4142 + 2(1.9965 + 2.9207 + 4.2163 + 5.9161) + 8.0623 = 39.5757
   \]
   Multiply by \( \frac{0.2}{2} = 0.1 \):
   \[
   T_5 = 0.1 \times 39.5757 \approx 3.9576
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: The closest option to \( 3.9576 \) is **H: 3.958**.
