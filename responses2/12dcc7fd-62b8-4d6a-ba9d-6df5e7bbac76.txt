Okay, so I've got this question about whether an accountant is independent when performing a compilation engagement for a nonissuer. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, I remember that in accounting, there's something about independence, especially when dealing with external reports like financial statements. The question mentions the accountant has an immaterial direct financial interest. So, what's the law here?

I think the key point is whether the accountant is independent and whether they're responsible for the financial statements. If there's a material interest, that could mean they have an obligation to disclose it. But wait, the question is about whether they're independent. Oh wait, the question is phrased a bit differently. It says the accountant has an immaterial direct financial interest. So, is that a material interest or not?

Wait, "immaterial" in the sense that it's not material. So, if the accountant's interest is immaterial, does that mean they're not required to disclose it? Because if their interest is not material, they can't have a significant impact on the financial statements. But does that affect their independence?

Wait, the question is about whether they're independent. I remember the main rule here is that if an accountant has a material financial interest in the entity (like a non-trade company), they're not independent. But if the interest is immaterial, they are independent.

So, the question is: If the accountant has an immaterial direct financial interest, is they independent, and can they issue reports?

Looking at the options:

Option A says independent because the interest is immaterial.
Option B says independent because immaterial.
Option C says independent, can issue both reports.
Option D says not independent.
Option E says independent, cannot issue compilation report.
Option F: Not indep., may issue review but not compile.
Option G: Not indep., cannot issue compile.
Option H: Independent, can issue compile.
Option I: Not indep., cannot be with financials, can issue compile.
Option J: Not indep., can issue compile but not review.

Wait, I think when the accountant has a material interest, they are not independent. But when the interest is immaterial, they are independent. So, in this case, since the interest is immaterial, the answer should be independent, right? 

So looking at the options, A and B say "Independent because immaterial." So, what's next? The question is whether they can issue both a compilation report and a review report.

From what I remember, when a company has a material interest, the accountant is not independent and may not be associated with the financial statements. But if the interest is immaterial, the accountant is independent, so they can issue both reports.

So in this case, since the interest is immaterial, the accountant is independent and can issue both reports. So that would be option A or B.

Wait, but the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the options are letters, but the answer should be one letter.

Wait, looking back at the options: 

A: Independent because immaterial.

B: Independent because immaterial.

C: Independent, may issue both.

D: Not indep., may not be in financials, but... 

Wait, no, if the interest is immaterial, the answer is independent, but the options for independence are A and B.

So, the correct answer must be A or B. Since both are correct in the sense of being independent (because immaterial), but the options don't have a choice between them. So which one is correct?

Wait, let me think again. The question is about whether the accountant is independent. So if the interest is immaterial, the answer is independent. So the options are A and B.

But wait, the question says, "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the answer must be a single letter.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Independent because immaterial.

Option B: Independent because immaterial.

Wait, but the question also says, "the accountant has an immaterial direct financial interest." So the correct answer would be that the accountant is independent because the interest is immaterial. So option A or B.

Wait, but how do the options differentiate between A and B? Both say the same thing, but perhaps the rest of the reasoning is different.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the consequences of being independent. If the accountant is independent, they can issue both a compile and a review report. So the correct option would be that they are independent and can issue both reports.

Looking at the options, option C says "Independent and, therefore, may issue both." But wait, is this only when the interest is immaterial? Or is it a general rule?

Wait, I think the rule is: if the accountant has a material interest, they are not independent. But if the interest is immaterial, they can issue both reports, and they are independent.

So the correct answer should be C: Independent and, therefore, may issue both a compilation report and a review report.

Wait, but the options say:

Option C: Independent and, therefore, may issue both a compilation report and a review report.

Wait, but I thought that option A and B are correct in terms of independence, but C is about being independent and being able to issue both reports.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because if the interest is immaterial, the accountant is independent, so they can issue both reports. But I'm a bit confused between A and C.

Wait, let me think: I remember that if a material interest exists, the accountant is not independent. But if it's immaterial, they are independent. So for option A and B, they are independent. But for option C, it's possible that, regardless of materiality, they can issue both reports.

Wait, maybe the key is that immaterial interest allows independence, but for the purpose of the question, the fact that the interest is immaterial means that the answer is independent, so the correct answer is either A or B.

But wait, the options don't have a choice between A and B; they're both correct in that they're independent. But perhaps the question is more about the business reasonableness. Oh wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because if the interest is immaterial, they are independent, so they can issue both reports.

Wait, but wait, I might be mixing up the legal principles. Let me look up the rule. Oh, right, the rule is: If an accounting professional has a material interest in the entity, they are not independent. If the interest is immaterial, they are independent. So, if the interest is immaterial, they are independent, and can issue both reports.

So, for the question, the correct answer is that the accountant is independent and may issue both reports. That's option C.

Wait, but looking again, the question is phrased as "the accountant has an immaterial direct financial interest." So the correct answer would be "Independent because the interest is immaterial." So options A and B are correct in that aspect.

But the options only have one correct answer. So perhaps the correct answer is A or B.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing the options. Let me re-examine the options.

Options:

A: Independent because immaterial.

B: Independent because immaterial.

C: Independent and may issue both.

D: Not independent and may not be in financials, but ...

Wait, no, if the interest is immaterial, then D says not independent, but that's not correct.

So, the correct answer should be C: Independent and may issue both.

Wait, but then why is option C an option? Because if the interest is immaterial, they are independent and can issue both reports.

So, the correct answer is C.
</think>

The correct answer is C: Independent and, therefore, may issue both a compilation report and a review report.

**Explanation:**
- If an accountant has an immaterial direct financial interest, they are not required to disclose this interest in the financial statements. This allows them to issue both a compilation report and a review report, as there is no material interest to hold them accountable. 

Thus, the accountant is independent and can perform these tasks without any conflict.
