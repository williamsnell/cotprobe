Okay, so I have this question about an invoice and the payment made after taking a cash discount. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that a payment of $416.50 was made after taking a cash discount of $8.50. I need to find out the original invoice amount. Hmm, right. So, the invoice amount is what the company originally owes before any discounts. Then, they take a cash discount, which reduces the amount the customer has to pay.

Wait, so if the discount is $8.50, that means the customer effectively pays $8.50 less than the original amount. So the payment made is the original amount minus the discount. That makes sense.

Let me write this down. Letâ€™s denote the original invoice amount as X. The customer takes a cash discount of $8.50, so they pay X - 8.50. And the amount paid is $416.50. So, setting up the equation: X - 8.50 = 416.50.

To find X, I just need to solve for it. So, I'll add 8.50 to both sides. 416.50 plus 8.50 equals X. Let me calculate that. 416.50 + 8.50 is 425. So, X is $425.00.

Looking at the options, option A is $425.00. That must be the answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers.

Wait, another way to think about it: If the original is $425, and you take a $8.50 discount, you subtract 8.50 from 425, which gives 416.50. Yep, that's exactly what the payment was. So option A makes sense.

The original invoice amount is calculated by adding the cash discount to the payment made. 

- Payment = Original Invoice - Cash Discount
- $416.50 = X - $8.50
- X = $416.50 + $8.50 = $425.00

The correct answer is A: $425.00.
