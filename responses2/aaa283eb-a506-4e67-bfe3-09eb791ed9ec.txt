The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A supplier of ink for printers sent the following letter to all of its customers:"Closeout special! We have decided to no longer stock green ink cartridges. We have on hand a limited supply of green ink cartridges for all printers; when they're gone, they're gone! Please submit your orders as soon as possible to make sure your order can be filled. "One of the regular customers of the supplier sent the following reply by fax:"Sorry to hear that you will no longer carry green ink cartridges, since that is one of our favorite colors. Please ship 100 green ink cartridges to our office as soon as possible. "The supplier faxed an acknowledgement of the order to the customer with a promise that the cartridges would be shipped out in one week. The next day, the supplier received the following e-mail from the customer:"Please cancel our order. We just discovered that we already have plenty of green ink cartridges in inventory. " The supplier proceeded to sell its entire stock of green ink cartridges at its asking price to other customers. In an action for breach of contract by the supplier against the customer, what is the maximum amount of damages that the supplier should be entitled to recover?

Options:

A: Consequential damages, since the green ink cartridges were unique because they were the last of their kind to be offered for sale by the supplier.
B: The cost of the ink cartridges plus any loss in profit from the potential sale to other customers.
C: $10,000, which is double the asking price of the cartridges, as a penalty for the customer's late cancellation.
D: Only incidental damages, if any, that the supplier has incurred in preparing the green ink cartridges for shipment to the customer before receiving the customer's e-mail.
E: The cost of the ink cartridges plus the cost of shipping, as the supplier had already promised to ship them out.
F: $5,000, which was the asking price for the 100 green ink cartridges ordered.
G: The cost of the ink cartridges plus any loss in profit from the sale to other customers, since the supplier had to sell the cartridges at a lower price.
H: The full cost of the cartridges plus any additional costs incurred in the sale to other customers.
I: Nothing.
J: Any additional costs incurred by the supplier in obtaining replacement cartridges to fulfill the customer's order.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically about breach of contract and damages. Hmm, let me try to break this down. 

The situation is a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. The supplier of ink sent a letter saying they no longer stock green ink. They had a limited supply and would close out orders soon. Then a regular customer sent a fax, apologizing because they already have plenty of green ink. The supplier then shipped out all their stock, selling at the asking price to others, and then the customer canceled the order, mentioning that they already had enough. The supplier promised to ship the cartridges, but the customer canceled the order.

The question is about the maximum damages the supplier should be liable for. The options are A to H, with I as nothing.

I remember from contract law that when a buyer cancels an order, the seller can still recover damages if they have a good reason. The key here is whether the supplier had a good reason to cancel.

In this case, the customer canceled because they already had enough green ink. So, the supplier had a legitimate, good reasonâ€”they already had the ink. That suggests they had a legitimate excuse, which could lead to recovery of damages.

Now, the options: A says it's because of uniqueness. But I think that's a point of consideration. Unique items might have more weight on the seller's side. If the ink is the last to be available, maybe it's unique and thus more valuable to the seller. That could mean higher damages.

Looking at the options:

A: Consequential damages because of the uniqueness. So, if the ink is unique, the supplier can recover more. But wait, I'm not sure if being unique is the main factor here. It might be more about the reason for cancellation being good.

B: Cost plus potential profit loss. That's a common approach. If the supplier had to resell the ink, they might have had to lower prices, incurring a loss. But is that the right approach here?

C: Double the asking price as penalty. The supplier promised to ship them out in a week, so maybe the penalty is for the time delay. But the customer canceled the order the next day, so that might not apply.

D: incidental damages. If the reason was good, maybe it's not just incidental. But I think the reason was good enough for a breach, so maybe not.

E: Ask price plus shipping costs. The supplier had already promised to ship, so maybe they had to pay for that. But the cancellation was due to having enough ink, not because of the shipping promise. So I'm not sure about this.

F: Asking price. The supplier sold at asking price, but the cancellation was because they had enough ink, not because they were forced to.

G: Cost plus loss in profit. The reason for cancellation was good, so the supplier might have had to lower prices, leading to loss. So this seems relevant.

H: Additional costs for replacement. But the supplier had to sell as is, not have to replace, unless they were out of stock. But in this case, they had enough, so maybe H isn't applicable.

Wait, but I think the key is that the supplier had a good reason to cancel, so they can recover damages. The fact that the ink was last of their kind could be a reason, but the main point is that the customer canceled because of having enough ink. So the supplier has a legitimate excuse.

So option G is "The cost of the ink cartridges plus any loss in profit from the sale to other customers." That sounds right because the supplier had to lower the price, leading to a loss.

Other options, like A, say it's because of uniqueness, which I'm not sure applies here. The main reason is the customer's good excuse.

Wait, but another angle: if the supplier had to close out the order, and the ink was unique, maybe they could recover more. But the question is about damages, which could include the loss in profit.

So I think G is correct. The supplier can recover the cost of the ink, plus any loss in profit because they sold at a lower price.

The supplier's breach of contract arises because the customer canceled an order due to having excess green ink cartridges, a legitimate reason. This indicates the supplier had a good excuse for the cancellation. Under contract law, the supplier can recover damages for the loss of profit from selling at a lower price and the cost of the ink cartridges. 

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A:** While the uniqueness of the ink might suggest higher damages, the key reason for cancellation is the customer's good excuse, making this less relevant.
- **B:** While reselling at a lower price could involve loss, the primary issue is the customer's legitimate excuse, not necessarily the loss in profit.
- **C:** A penalty for late cancellation isn't applicable here since the cancellation was due to having sufficient ink.
- **D:** Incidental damages are unlikely since the customer's cancellation was due to having enough ink.
- **E:** The supplier had already promised to ship, so this doesn't apply.
- **F:** The supplier sold at the asking price, not forced to, so this doesn't fit.
- **G:** This correctly identifies that the supplier can recover the cost of the ink and any loss in profit due to selling at a lower price, as the customer's good excuse justifies this.
- **H:** Additional costs for replacement are irrelevant here because the supplier had to sell as-is.
- **I:** Nothing is appropriate, given the supplier's good excuse.
- **J:** Additional costs aren't relevant unless the supplier had to replace ink, which they didn't.

The correct answer is **G**, as the supplier's breach was justified by a legitimate reason, allowing recovery of damages for the loss in profit.

**Answer: G**
