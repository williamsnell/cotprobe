Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The problem is to calculate the expression (1/a)^4 multiplied by 2 times a^4, plus a^(2+1-3), all when a is 42. Then, I have to choose the correct answer from options A to J.

Hmm, let me break it down step by step. First, I need to substitute a with 42 in each part of the expression. The expression has three main parts: (1/a)^4, 2 * a^4, and a^(2+1-3). I'll handle each part separately.

Starting with the first term: (1/a)^4. Since a is 42, that becomes (1/42)^4. I know that 42^4 is a big number, but I don't need to compute it all right now. Maybe I can keep it as (1/42)^4 for now.

Next is 2 * a^4. Again substituting a with 42, this becomes 2 multiplied by 42^4. 

The third term is a^(2+1-3). Let me simplify the exponent first. 2+1 is 3, minus 3 is 0. So this term is a^0. Oh wait, any number to the power of zero is 1, except for zero itself. So this term is 1.

Putting it all together, the expression becomes (1/42)^4 * 2 * 42^4 + 1.

Wait, the first two terms have (1/42)^4 and 42^4. Let me see if I can simplify those. (1/42)^4 is the same as 1/(42^4), and then multiplying by 42^4 would give me 1. Because (1/42)^4 * 42^4 = 1. So the first part simplifies to 1 * 2, which is 2. Then I add 1 from the third term.

So 2 + 1 equals 3. Therefore, the total expression equals 3 when a is 42.

Looking back at the options, option G is 3. So the answer should be G.

The expression simplifies to 3.
