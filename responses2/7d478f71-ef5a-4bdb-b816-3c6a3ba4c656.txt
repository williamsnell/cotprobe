Okay, so I've got this question about heritability in cloned populations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. 

First, I remember that heritability refers to the proportion of variation in a trait that can be attributed to genetic factors. So, when talking about cloned plants, which are genetically identical, their traits should show high heritability, right? Because they're clones, they're not exposed to environmental factors that might change their traits.

Wait, but cloned populations are usually from a single source, so any variation in their traits would be due to genetic differences. So, if they're clones, they should have high heritability. 

Now, looking at the options: I see 100% is an option (F). But wait, clones are genetically identical, so their traits would be the same, meaning no environmental variance is contributing. Therefore, heritability would be 100% because all the variation comes from genetics. 

Wait, but in reality, cloned plants might have some environmental variation because they're growing in the same soil, water, light, etc. So, maybe the heritability isn't 100%. Or maybe clones are so genetically identical that any differences are negligible. 

Wait, another angle: Heritability in a population that's cloned might not be as high as one would think. Because, even though the plants are genetically identical, they might be exposed to different environmental conditions when they start to grow. So, maybe their heritability is lower than 100%, but higher than 0. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall. If a population is genetically identical (like clones), then all individuals have the same genotype. So, any variation is due to genetics, so heritability should be 100%. But in reality, clones might have slight differences in growth conditions or might not be exposed to the same external factors. But I'm not sure if that affects heritability. 

Wait, another thought: Heritability is the proportion of variance in a trait due to genetic factors. So, if all the variation in the trait is due to genetics, heritability is 100%. But sometimes, like in plants, if the plants are clones, their growth environment might be identical, so any variation in traits would be entirely genetic. So, the heritability should be 100%. 

Looking at the options, F is 100%. So, the answer should be F. But wait, I'm not entirely sure because sometimes cloned plants might not exhibit 100% heritability if they are exposed to environmental changes. But the question is about the heritability of the cloned population. Clones have identical genes, so their traits shouldn't vary based on environment, so heritability should be 100%. 

Wait, but another thought: Maybe the heritability is lower because the population isn't a single lineage but a few clones. But clones are genetically identical, so their heritability should be higher. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the heritability of the trait among the cloned plants, considering their growth conditions. But since they are clones, any environmental factors that are the same for all should not contribute to heritability. So, all variation is genetic, leading to 100% heritability. 

So, the correct answer should be F:100%.

The heritability of a cloned population refers to the proportion of variation in a trait that can be attributed to genetic factors. Cloned plants are genetically identical, meaning their variation in traits should primarily be due to genetics. Therefore, the heritability should be 100%, as all variation in the trait is explained by genetic factors. 

Given the options, the correct answer is F: 100%.

Answer: F
