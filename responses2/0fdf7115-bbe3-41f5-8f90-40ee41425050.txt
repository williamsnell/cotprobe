Okay, so I've got this question here about present value. Let me think about how to approach this. The question says that a cash flow of $100 has a discount rate of 5% and will be received in 5 years. I need to find the present value.

Hmm, I remember that present value is calculated using the formula PV = FV / (1 + r)^n. Where FV is the future value, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of years. So in this case, FV is $100, r is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal form, and n is 5.

So plugging those numbers into the formula: PV = 100 / (1 + 0.05)^5. Let me calculate the denominator first. 1 + 0.05 is 1.05. Then 1.05 raised to the 5th power. 

Wait, how do I calculate that? Let me think. 1.05^1 is 1.05, 1.05^2 is 1.1025, 1.05^3 is about 1.157625, 1.05^4 is approximately 1.21550625, and 1.05^5 is roughly 1.2762815625. Let me double-check that. 1.05 * 1.2155 is 1.2155 + 0.060775 = 1.276275. Yeah, so about 1.27628.

So the denominator is approximately 1.27628. Then PV is 100 divided by that. Let me compute that. 100 / 1.27628. Hmm, what's 100 divided by 1.27628? Let's calculate that. Well, 1.27628 times 78 is about 100, because 1.27628 * 70 is 89.34, and 1.27628 * 8 is about 10.21, so 89.34 + 10.21 is 99.55, which is close to 100. So 78 would give about 99.55, but maybe it's a little higher. Let me think: 78.3526? Wait, I think I remember that 1.27628 * 78.3526 is about 100. So yes, the present value is approximately $78.35.

Looking at the options, option A is 78.3526. That matches. So the correct answer should be A.

The present value (PV) of a future cash flow is calculated using the formula:

PV = FV / (1 + r)^n

Where:
- FV = $100 (future value),
- r = 5% (discount rate),
- n = 5 years.

Calculating the denominator: (1 + 0.05)^5 ≈ 1.27628.

PV = 100 / 1.27628 ≈ 78.3526.

The correct option is A: 78.3526.
