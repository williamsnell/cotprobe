Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A mail clerk domiciled in State A slipped and fell on ice that had formed near the loading dock of the building in State B where the clerk's State B employer leased space for its headquarters. The building was owned and operated by a State C corporation. As a result of the fall, the clerk was injured and the employer's expensive computer he was carrying was badly damaged. The clerk sued the building owner for negligence in a federal district court in State B, seeking $100,000 in personal-injury damages. The employer has filed a timely motion to intervene, asserting an $80,000 negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer. Is the court likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene?

Options:

A: No, because the employer cannot intervene in a personal injury case.
B: No, because the employer's claim is not directly related to the clerk's personal injury claim.
C: Yes, because the employer also has a direct negligence claim against the building owner.
D: No, because although the employer has an interest in the clerk's action, that interest is not likely to be impaired in the employer's absence.
E: Yes, because the employer has a financial interest in the outcome of the clerk's case.
F: No, because the employer's claim exceeds the amount the clerk is seeking in damages.
G: Yes, because the employer is an indispensable party.
H: Yes, because the employer's claim and the clerk's claim arose from the same incident.
I: Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.
J: No, because the clerk chose not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff in his action.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the employer can intervene in the clerk's suit. Let me go through the facts again. The clerk was in State B, and the employer was in State B as well. They both had headquarters in State B, and the building was operated by a State C corporation. The building was part of State B's ownership.

The incident was a fall on ice near the loading dock in State B, which was where the clerk slipped and fell. The ice was probably in State C's territory. Because of that, the building in State B was nearby. The clerk sued the building owner for negligence, seeking $100,000 in damages. The employer is suing for an $80,000 claim against the building owner for the damage to their computer.

Now, the question is about whether the employer can file a timely motion to intervene. The possible answers are A to J, each making a different argument.

First, I think about what an intervening motion requires. Generally, courts require a motion to intervene to avoid costs or inconvenience of litigating a party not in the same state as the plaintiff. But there are exceptions, like if the moving party is an indispensable party, has a financial interest, or if they have a direct interest in the outcome.

So, the key here is whether the employer is an indispensable party. Indispensability is when the plaintiff's injury directly affects the moving party's interest in the outcome. In this case, the employer was in State B, same state as the plaintiff. The employer carried an expensive computer, and the injury caused the damage to that. So, the employer's injury directly affects their own interests. If the injury caused a significant loss, the employer might believe that their injury is necessary for the outcome.

Another consideration is the common questions of law and fact. The employer's claim is about the computer damage, which is directly related to the injury caused by the accident. So, the moving party (employer) and the moving plaintiff (clerk) have questions of law and fact that are relevant to each other.

So, options C and J both say the employer has a direct claim against the owner. Option C says the employer also has a direct claim against the owner. Option J says the clerk chose not to join as a co-plaintiff. But in this case, the employer is suing directly, so J's point about the co-plaintiff isn't relevant here.

Wait, the employer is suing directly, so that's about whether the injury directly affects their own interests. But if the injury was a direct one—like, the injury is directly responsible for the employer's claim—then the employer might have an interest in the outcome.

Alternatively, sometimes the employer might have a financial interest in the case. The employer's claim is $80k, and if the court grants the motion, the employer would have to pay that and the plaintiff would get $100k. But the court might require the employer to pay, so maybe that's a financial interest. But the question is whether the court will grant the motion, not whether the employer would be compelled to pay.

Looking at the options, C says yes because the employer has a direct claim against the owner. J says no because the co-plaintiff chose not to join. But the issue here is about the employer's ability to intervene, not about whether the co-plaint will join or not.

So, the key points are the moving party's direct claim and the common law questions. So, the court would likely grant the motion if those factors apply.

Looking at the other options: A says no because the employer can't intervene. But I think that's incorrect because they can. Option B says no because the employer's claim isn't related. That's wrong because the employer's claim was directly related. So, the correct answer is probably C or J.

But wait, the court's requirement for the intervening motion is sometimes more about the moving party's interest. If the employer's claim is directly related and the injury affects their interest, then the court may grant the motion. So, the court likely will grant the motion because the employer has a direct claim against the owner and their injury affects their interest.

So, the correct answer is C or J? Let me read again. Option C says yes, because the employer has a direct negligence claim against the owner. Option J says no because the clerk chose not to join. But the question is about the employer's ability, not the co-plaint's. So, the court would likely grant the motion if the employer has a direct claim and the injury affects their interest.

So, the correct choice is C: Yes, because the employer also has a direct negligence claim against the building owner. Because both the employer and the plaintiff have a claim against the same owner, and their injury directly affects the plaintiff's interest. So, the court likely grants the motion.

The court is likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene because the employer has a direct negligence claim against the building owner and their injury directly affects their interest in the outcome.
