Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Boeing 747 jumbo jet during takeoff roll. Let me see what it's asking. Hmm, the problem says that the jet is accelerating at 4 m/s² and it takes 40 seconds to reach takeoff speed. I need to find the takeoff speed and the distance it travels.

Wait, right, I remember that when something accelerates from rest, the final velocity can be found using the equation v = u + at. Since it starts from rest, u is 0. So plugging in the numbers, a is 4 m/s², t is 40 s. So v = 0 + 4 *40, which is 160 m/s. That would be the takeoff speed. So looking at the options, let's see which one has 160 m/s. Option D is 160 m/s, and the distance part I need to figure out.

Oh wait, no—the options are A to J, each with a takeoff speed and distance. So after calculating the speed, I also need to find the distance. To find distance when you know acceleration and time, I think the equation is s = ut + 0.5*a*t². Again, u is 0 here. So s = 0.5 *4 * (40)^2. Let me compute that.

Wait, 40 squared is 1600. Then multiplied by 0.5 is 800. Then multiplied by 4 (from a=4) gives 3200 meters. Oh wait, 3200 meters is 3.2 kilometers. Let me check the options again. Option D says takeoff speed is 160 m/s and distance is 3.2 km. So that matches. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Double-check the calculations: 4 m/s² *40 s is 160 m/s. Correct. For distance, 0.5 *4 *40². 40 squared is 1600, times 0.5 is 800, times 4 is 3200 meters, which is 3.2 km. So option D is correct.

To determine the takeoff speed and distance of the Boeing 747 jet, we use the equations of motion for constant acceleration:

1. **Takeoff Speed**: The final velocity \( v \) can be calculated using \( v = u + at \), where \( u = 0 \) (initial velocity), \( a = 4 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( t = 40 \, \text{s} \).  
   \[
   v = 0 + 4 \times 40 = 160 \, \text{m/s}
   \]

2. **Distance Traveled**: The distance \( s \) is given by \( s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \), with \( u = 0 \).  
   \[
   s = 0 + \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times (40)^2 = 2 \times 1600 = 3200 \, \text{m} = 3.2 \, \text{km}
   \]

From the options provided, the correct answer is **Option D**, which states a takeoff speed of \( 160 \, \text{m/s} \) and a distance of \( 3.2 \, \text{km} \).

**ANSWER: D**
