Okay, so I've got this question about life insurance policies, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is asking me to compare the cost of two different life insurance policies. Both are 20 payments, so they're term policies. One is for a young man who's 25, and the other is for a man who's 45. I need to compare the total cost for each. 

I remember that life insurance premiums can vary based on age and other factors. But wait, I think the main factor here might be the age-related cost structures. Let me think. For young people, say starting at 25, their life insurance premiums are higher because they have a higher risk. Conversely, older people, like 45, might have lower premiums because they don't live as long as someone in their late teens or twenties.

So the key is understanding whether the 45-year-old's policy is cheaper or more expensive than the 25-year-old's. I think older individuals typically pay less for their insurance. Because older people don't need as many policies, or have different coverage structures. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy here. Let me think again.

I remember that for term life insurance, the cost usually increases with age. So older people have cheaper policies. So the 45-year-old's policy should be cheaper than the 25-year-old's. Wait, but waitâ€”maybe it's not that straightforward. Sometimes, there are factors like health, but the question doesn't mention anything about health, so I think we're assuming the same for both.

So if the 25-year-old's policy is 20 payments of $5k each, wait no, wait. No, wait. The policy is $5,000 for 20 payments. So the total cost would be 20 times the amount per payment. But wait, the options are the total cost for each person. So if the policy is $5,000 for 20 payments, the total is $5,000. But that can't be, because if it's a 20-year term, maybe each payment is higher or lower? Or wait, no, the policy is $5,000, which is the total premium. So both policies are $5k. But why would one be cheaper than the other then?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the question again. It says, "compare the cost of a $5,000 20-payment life insurance policy for a young man 25 vs a 45-year-old." So both policies are $5k, but the question is about their total cost. Wait, that wouldn't make sense because the total cost would be the same. But that's not an option here. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is talking about the cost per payment. Or perhaps I'm looking at the wrong aspect. Oh wait, perhaps the cost per payment is different for each age. No, that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the total premium paid over the term of the policy. So for the 25-year-old, the 20 payments are for $5k each? No, that doesn't make sense because each payment is usually less. Or wait, perhaps the premium is $5k in total. So for both, the total is $5k. But the options are total costs, so that would suggest both are $5k, which is option D. But the options given have different numbers. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the wording. Let me look at the options again. The options are pairs of amounts, which I think are each person's total cost (so each person's 20 payments summed up). But both policies are $5,000, so each person's total is $5k. But that would be option D, which says both are $5k. But that can't be right, because I thought older people have lower premiums, but maybe the question is comparing per payment, not total.

Wait, maybe I confused the question. Let me read again: "compare the cost of a $5,000 20-payment life insurance policy for a young man 25 years of age with a man 45 years of age." So each policy is $5k for 20 payments. So each person's total premium is $5k. So the answer would be that both are $5k, which is option D.

But looking at the options, option D is $5000 and $5000. So that would be the case. But wait, that seems odd because I thought older people have cheaper policies. So why would the 45-year-old have the same $5k as the 25-year-old? Unless the question is about the total premium, which is the same for both.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the question is about the per-year premium, not the total. So for each year, the 25-year-old's premium is higher than the 45-year-old's. For example, the per-year premium for a 25-year-old might be $250 or something, and for a 45-year-old, it's $100 or less.

But the question says, 'compare the cost of a $5,000 20-payment policy each.' So each has a total of $5,000. So total cost is same, so answer D.

But wait, another approach: the age affects how much each payment is. For a 25-year-old, their life insurance premiums are higher each year, but over 20 years, the total might be the same as a 45-year-old. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. If the 25-year-old's policy is $5k in total, then the 45-year-old's is also $5k. So the answer would be D: 5000 and 5000. So the correct option is D.

The question compares the cost of a $5,000 20-payment life insurance policy for a young man (25) and a man (45). Since both policies are $5,000 in total, the cost for each is the same. This leads to the conclusion that the correct answer is D: $5,000 and $5,000.

Answer: D
