Okay, so I've got this problem about George Henderson's earnings. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, let's see. The question says he worked 46 hours last week, and his salary is based on a base rate of $3.00 per hour and time and a half for overtime. The standard workweek is 40 hours. The options are given from A to J.

Wait, so I need to calculate his gross earnings. Let me break it down. First, let's figure out how much he makes for regular hours and how much for overtime.

Regular hours are the first 40 hours, right? So George worked 46, which means he worked 40 normally and 6 overtime hours. Okay, so 40 hours at the regular rate and 6 hours at time and a half.

The regular rate is $3.00 per hour. So for regular hours, that's 40 * $3.00. Let me compute that: 40 *3 is 120, so $120 for regular hours.

Now, for overtime. Time and a half means 1.5 times the regular rate. So the overtime rate is 1.5 * $3.00. Let me calculate that: 1.5 *3 is $4.50 per overtime hour.

He worked 6 overtime hours, so 6 * $4.50. Let me compute that: 6 *4 is 24, and 6 *0.5 is 3, so 24+3= $27. So overtime makes $27.

Adding regular and overtime: $120 + $27 = $147. So his gross earnings are $147.00. Looking at the options, option A is $147.00. So the answer should be A.

The calculation involves regular hours (40 at $3.00) and overtime (6 at $4.50). Regular: 40*3=120, Overtime: 6*4.5=27. Total: 120+27=147. Answer: A.

Answer: A
