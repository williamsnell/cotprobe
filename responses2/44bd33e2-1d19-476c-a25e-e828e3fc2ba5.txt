Okay, so I need to figure out what change in government spending is required to close a deflationary gap. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in macroeconomics, the government spending multiplier comes into play here. 

Wait, the question says that the equilibrium level was 500, but the full employment is 600. So the desired change is 100. Oh right, because 600 -500 is 100. So they want to get from 500 to 600, which is a 100 increase in income.

But the problem says the money supply is held constant. Oh right, because if the money supply is held constant, then the LM curve is vertical. So the change in equilibrium income is determined by the fiscal policy multiplier. 

The fiscal multiplier is calculated as the government spending multiplier. I think the formula is government spending times the MPC divided by the marginal tax rate, but I might be mixing things up. Or wait, another approach: the change in equilibrium income (ΔY) is equal to the multiplier times the change in government spending (ΔG). 

The government spending multiplier is 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ), where MPC is marginal propensity to consume, and t is the tax rate. Wait no, let me think again. The fiscal multiplier is 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ). Or is it 1/(1 - MPC/(1 - t)) )? Wait, no, the formula for the government multiplier is 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ), because when MPC is the multiplier for consumption, the spending multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC). But when you have taxes, the multiplier is multiplied by (1/t). Oh wait, maybe the formula is: 

The government spending multiplier = 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)))) )? Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the total effects.

Wait, another approach: the government spending multiplier is 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ) ) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)))) ). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, the government spending multiplier is 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ). Wait, no, maybe the formula is 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ) ) multiplied by (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ). I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, since the problem states that the money supply is held constant, the LM curve is vertical. So the equilibrium is determined by the equation Y = C + I + G. With the multiplier effect, the change in G will be (ΔY) / (multiplier). 

Wait, since the desired change is ΔY = 100, the change in G (ΔG) needed would be (ΔY) * (1 / (multiplier)). 

But wait, what's the multiplier in this case? The fiscal multiplier is 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ), or perhaps it's 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ). Hmm, but I'm not confident about the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ). Alternatively, the multiplier is the sum of the MPC, and the taxes effect.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to recall that when the money supply is held constant, the LM curve is vertical. So any change in income will be met by an increase in government spending. The change in income (ΔY) is equal to the desired ΔY (100 in this case) divided by the fiscal multiplier.

Wait, let's think about the fiscal policy. The change in income (ΔY) is equal to the government spending multiplier multiplied by the change in government spending (ΔG). So ΔY = (multiplier) * ΔG.

We need to find ΔG such that ΔY = 100. So ΔG = ΔY / multiplier.

What is the fiscal multiplier? From what I remember, the formula is:

1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)))) )? Or is it (1/( (1 - MPC) (1 - t) )) ) multiplied by (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ) ?

Wait, another approach: The multiplier is (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) multiplied by (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) )? Or perhaps just (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) multiplied by (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )).

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me look for the formula again. Oh well, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the multiplier when taxes and MPS are involved. The formula for the multiplier when the money supply is held constant is 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) * (1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) ) ). Hmm, but that sounds complicated. Alternatively, I've read somewhere that the multiplier is (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)))) ) ), which would be the same as 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) * (1 - (MPS/(1 - t)))) )? Or perhaps it's (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ) ) multiplied by ( (1 - t)/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t))) ) )? 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to think of the multiplier as (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) ) multiplied by (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )). Hmm, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think of the multiplier as (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) ) ), which would be the same as 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) * (1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to remember that when money supply (M) is held constant, the LM curve is vertical. So the equation is Y = C + I + G. The change in G will affect the equilibrium Y. 

In equilibrium, Y = C + I + G. Let's plug in the values. C is 100 + 0.6Y. I is 0.2Y -50i. G is 100. Let's rearrange the equation.

Y = [100 + 0.6Y] + [0.2Y - 50i] + 100.

Simplify: Y = 100 + 0.6Y + 0.2Y -50i + 100.

Combine like terms: Y = 200 + 0.8Y -50i.

Rearrange to get Y - 0.8Y = 200 -50i.

0.2Y = 200 -50i.

Multiply both sides by 5: Y = (200 *5) - (50*5)i → Y = 1000 -250i.

But wait, that seems right because the LM curve is Y = 1000 -250i (since M is 600, and when M is held constant, the LM is Y = (M/P) + (I) (since for a given i, Y is fixed as 1000 -250i). But assuming P is constant, so Y = 1000 -250i.

But if we're holding M constant, then Y is determined by the equation Y = 200 + 0.8Y -50i → 0.2Y = 200 -50i → Y = 1000 -250i.

Wait, but that's the LM equation. So the equilibrium occurs at Y = 1000 -250i.

But wait, in the problem, the desired level of income is 600, but the current equilibrium is 500. So perhaps we need to consider how the desired level affects the adjustment.

Wait, the problem states that full employment level is 600, so the desired change is 100. So they need to reach Y = 600.

But with the current situation, the government spending multiplier determines how much G needs to change to achieve the desired change in Y.

The multiplier for G is (1 / ( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ) ) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t))) ) ). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is (1 / ( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) multiplied by (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) ) ).

But I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should think of the problem with the multiplier. So the desired change in Y is 100. The current equilibrium is 500, but since the LM is vertical, the change in G will be such that ΔY = multiplier * ΔG.

Wait, to find ΔG, since ΔY is 100, ΔG = ΔY / multiplier.

But what's the multiplier? Let's suppose that the multiplier is (1 / ( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) * (1 / (1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ). Or perhaps the multiplier is just (1 / ( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) multiplied by ( (1 - t)/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ), which would give (1 - t) / ( (1 - MPC) (1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) ) ).

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the multiplier using the given MPC and MPS. Let me see.

MPC is 0.6, so 1 - MPC = 0.4.

MPS is 0.2, so 1 - t = (1 - MPC) * multiplier. Wait, perhaps the MPC is 0.6, which is the MPC, so 1 - MPC = 0.4.

In the absence of taxes, the MPC would be 1 (if everyone spends all their income). But since MPC is 0.6, the MPC is 60% of income is spent.

MPS is 0.2, which is the MPC for savings. So, 1 - t = 0.2 → t = 0.8 → tax rate is 80%.

Wait, but if t is 80%, then 1 - t is 0.2.

So, the fiscal multiplier is 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ) ) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ). Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) ) * ( (1 - t)/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ) → which would be (1 - t) / ( (1 - MPC) (1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ).

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the multiplier. So the multiplier is (1 / ( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) ) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) → but that might be a complicated expression. Let's plug in the numbers.

MPC = 0.6 → 1 - MPC = 0.4.

t = 0.8 → 1 - t = 0.2.

MPS = 0.2 → 1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) → 1 - (0.2/(0.2)) = 1-1 = 0. So denominator would be zero, which can't be. So perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ). Hmm, but since 1 - (MPS/(1 -t)) → 1 - (0.2/0.2) = 0. So that would be 1/0, which is undefined. That can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the multiplier in this scenario is (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) ) * ( (1 - t) / (1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) ) )) → which simplifies to 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ).

Wait, but with the numbers now, this becomes 1/( (0.4) * (1 - (0.2/0.2)) ) → 1/(0.4 * (1 - 1)) ) → division by zero, which is impossible. So perhaps the formula is different. 

Alternatively, perhaps the multiplier is (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) ) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ), but that leads to division by zero when t is 80% and MPS is 0.2. So something's wrong with my approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) ) * ( (1 - t) / (1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ) → which simplifies to (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) ) * ( (1 - t) / (1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ) → (1/( (1 - MPC) )) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) )

Wait, but that's not correct because (1 - t) cancels out. So, the multiplier becomes 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) ) )).

Wait, so with the numbers: MPC=0.6 → 1-0.6=0.4.

t=0.8 → 1-t=0.2.

MPS=0.2 → 1 - (MPS/(1-t)) → 1 - (0.2/(0.2)) = 0.

Which would again lead to division by zero. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the multiplier is 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ) * ( (1 - t) / (1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ). That simplifies to (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) )).

Wait, with the numbers:

Denominator: (1 - MPC) = 0.4.

(1 - (MPS/(1-t)) ) → 1 - (0.2/0.2) → 1-1=0. So denominator is 0.4 * 0 → 0. So again, undefined.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently.

The problem says that in the current situation, the equilibrium income is 500, which is below the full employment level of 600. So they need to reach Y = 600. Since the money supply is held constant, the LM curve is vertical. So the change in G required to increase Y by 100 is ΔG = ΔY * (1/(multiplier)).

Wait, but to find the multiplier, perhaps I can compute the change in Y when G changes. So, let me write the equation again.

Y = 100 + 0.6Y + (0.2Y -50i) + 100.

Simplify: Y = 200 + 0.8Y -50i.

Rearranged: Y -0.8Y = 200 -50i → 0.2Y = 200 -50i → Y = (200 -50i)/0.2 → Y = 1000 -250i.

So, the LM curve is Y = 1000 -250i.

But wait, with the money supply held constant, the LM curve is indeed vertical at Y = 1000 -250i.

Now, the desired Y is 600. So, let's set Y = 600 and find the required i.

600 = 1000 -250i → 250i = 1000 -600 =400 → i = 400/250 = 1.6%. 

Hmm, but that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps in the absence of taxes, the multiplier would be different. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps let's consider the full equation. The equation is Y = C + I + G. 

C = 100 + 0.6Y.

I = 0.2Y -50i.

G = 100.

So Y = (100 +0.6Y) + (0.2Y -50i) +100.

Which is Y = 200 +0.8Y -50i.

Rearranged: 0.2Y =200 -50i → Y= (200 -50i)/0.2 → Y = 1000 -250i.

So the LM is Y=1000 -250i.

Wait, so if the desired Y is 600, then 600=1000-250i → 250i=400 → i=1.6%.

But that's the new equilibrium. So, the change in i is 1.6 - whatever the current i is. But wait, the problem is about changing G, not i.

But the problem says that the money supply is held constant. So the LM is vertical. So any change in G will cause a change in Y.

So, ΔY = 100. So, ΔG = ΔY * (1/(multiplier)).

Wait, but what is the multiplier in this case?

The multiplier is the change in Y per unit change in G. Since in the equation Y = (C) + (I) + (G), the change in Y is 1 (if G increases by 1), but the multiplier is 1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) ) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ) → which is getting me stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the multiplier is (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) ) multiplied by (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ). But when t is 80%, and MPS is 20% (MPS = 0.2), then 1 - (MPS/(1-t)) = 1- (0.2/0.2) → 0. So denominator is zero, which is impossible.

Hmm, maybe the mistake is that I'm not considering that in this case, the MPC is 0.6, so 1-MPC=0.4. The tax rate t is 0.8, so 1-t=0.2. The MPS is 0.2. So 1-MPS/(1-t) → 1 - 0.2/0.2 → 1-1=0.

Which is leading to a division by zero in the formula. So perhaps I should use another approach.

Let me think about the problem again. The current equilibrium is 500, but the full employment is 600. So a gap of 100. The problem is to close this gap. The LM is vertical, so to get the desired Y, the money supply must remain the same, but the LM is vertical. So any change in G would cause a change in Y. 

Wait, but if the LM is vertical, then any change in G would cause an immediate change in Y. So the change in G would be the required change to reach Y=600.

Wait, but the current equilibrium is Y=500. So if we change G by an amount ΔG, Y would increase by ΔG * multiplier.

Wait, but the multiplier is (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) ) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1 - t)) )) ). But in our case, with t=0.8, and MPS=0.2, (1 - (MPS/(1-t)) ) becomes 1-1=0. So denominator is zero. That suggests that the multiplier is infinite, meaning that a change in G can't be balanced by a change in Y because of the way taxes and MPS interact.

Hmm, so perhaps in this scenario, the multiplier is (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) ) → 1/(0.4 * 0.2) ) → 1/(0.08) = 12.5.

But wait, that's only considering taxes and MPC, but not the MPS. So the multiplier would be 1/( (1-MPC)(1-t) ) * (1/(1 - (MPS/(1-t)) ) ). Hmm, but with the numbers, that's 1/(0.4 *0.2 ) * (1/(1 - (0.2/(0.2))) ) → 1/(0.08) * 1/0 → which is undefined. So that approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the correct formula for the multiplier is (1/( (1 - MPC) * (1 - t) )) ) → 12.5 in our case. But then, if the multiplier is 12.5, then ΔG = ΔY / 12.5 → ΔY=100 → ΔG=8.

Wait, but the options are 8, 12,16,20,24. Hmm, 8 is an option (option A is 8).

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me think through again.

The problem is that the current equilibrium is 500, but the full employment is 600. So the desired change is 100. With the money supply held constant, the LM is vertical at Y=1000-250i.

But wait, let's think about the desired level. Since the full employment is 600, the current equilibrium is 500. So a desired level of 600 requires a change of 100. So, to achieve that, the level of government spending needs to change.

The money supply is held constant, so the LM is vertical. So any change in G will change Y. So to get Y to increase by 100, G needs to be increased by 100 * (1/multiplier). Wait, what is the multiplier here?

Wait, perhaps the multiplier is (1/( (1-MPC) * (1-t) )) ) → 1/(0.4 *0.2) )=1/0.08=12.5.

So the required change in G would be ΔG= ΔY * (1/multiplier) → 100 * (1/12.5) )=8.

So the answer would be 8, which is option A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of another approach.

In the current equilibrium, Y is 500, G is 100, and C is 100 +0.6*500= 100 +300=400. I is 0.2*500 -50i → 100 -50i. So with G=100, C=400, I=100-50i, the equation is 500=400 + 100 -50i → 500=500 -50i → 50i=0 → i=0. So tax rate is 0%? 

Wait, but the money supply is held constant, so the LM is vertical. So, in the current equilibrium, the LM is Y=1000-250i. But in the current equilibrium, Y=500, so 500=1000-250i → 250i=500 → i=2. So the interest rate is 2%, which is the real interest rate. So, the LM is Y=1000-250i.

Wait, but when Y=500, the LM equation would be 500=1000-250i → 250i=500 → i=2. So the LM at Y=500 is i=2. So the LM is a curve that connects Y=500, i=2, and other points.

But the desired level of income is 600. So, how much G needs to be increased to reach Y=600, with money supply held constant.

The equation is Y=1000-250i.

If Y=600, then 600=1000-250i → 250i=400 → i=1.6.

But wait, the current i is 2. So to increase i to 1.6 would lower income, but we need to increase i to a lower value to increase Y.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The money supply is held constant, so the LM is vertical at Y=1000-250i. Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, the LM equation is Y = (C + I) + G, but when M/P is fixed, Y is fixed as 1000-250i.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when money supply is held constant, the LM is vertical, so any change in G will change Y.

But the current equation is Y=1000-250i. So when M is held constant, i can be anything, but the LM is Y=1000-250i. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering that to reach full employment, the current economy is at 500, and the desired is 600. Since the LM is vertical, the change in G is needed to achieve the desired income.

So, the change in G is ΔG = ΔY * (1/(multiplier)).

But what's the multiplier here? Let's think about the multiplier as (1/( (1-MPC) * (1-t) ) ) → 1/(0.4 *0.2) )=1/0.08=12.5.

So ΔG=100 * (1/12.5)=8.

So the answer is 8, option A.
</think>

To determine the change in government spending (G) required to achieve a desired income (Y) of 600, we analyze the given equations and the multiplier effect. The current equilibrium is 500, but full employment is 600, requiring a desired change of 100. Since the money supply is held constant, the LM curve is vertical, and any change in G will directly affect Y.

The government spending multiplier is calculated as:

\[
\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{(1 - \text{MPC}) \cdot (1 - t)}
\]

Where:
- \( \text{MPC} = 0.6 \),
- \( t = 0.8 \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{(1 - 0.6) \cdot (1 - 0.8)} = \frac{1}{0.4 \cdot 0.2} = \frac{1}{0.08} = 12.5
\]

The required change in G is:

\[
\Delta G = \Delta Y \cdot \frac{1}{\text{Multiplier}} = 100 \cdot \frac{1}{12.5} = 8
\]

Thus, the government spending must be increased by 8 to achieve the desired income of 600.

ANSWER: 8
