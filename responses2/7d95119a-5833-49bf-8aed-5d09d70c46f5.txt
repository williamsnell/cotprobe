Question:

A state statute provides: "Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. " Violation of the statute is made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found

Options:

A: not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.
B: not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.
C: guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.
D: guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.

Okay, so I've got this legal question about statutes and criminal law. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The statute says: "Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest." So, the idea here is that if someone is aware they're being arrested, they have to be quiet during arrest. They shouldn't use force or weapons.

The scenario is a bank robbery where a suspect was arrested. Now, the police officer believed the suspect was involved. But they gave different accounts. One says he hit after resisting arrest with his fist, the other says he cursed and the officer hit him with nightstick. The suspect ended up charged with assault, and we need to figure out if he's guilty or not based on the accounts given.

Wait, so the statute applies to anyone being arrested, right? So if the suspect was arrested, and he knew or should know that he was being arrested, he's supposed to resist arrest. But in the case, he gave two different accounts. So, depending on the truth, what happens?

I remember that in criminal law, the truthfulness of the account matters. If the person is telling the truth, then they should be guilty if they couldn't resist. But if they're lying, maybe they're not guilty.

Wait, but in this case, the arrest was unlawful. So the police officer's belief about what happened next could be the issue. If the police officer was justified in arresting the suspect, then the suspect's account would matter. But if the arrest was unlawful, maybe they didn't have the right to arrest, and their account doesn't affect the guilt.

Wait, but the statute is about the duty of the arrested person, not the officer. So if the arrested person knew they were being arrested, they must resist. But if they're lying about what happened, then maybe they're not guilty. Oh, but if they're telling the truth, then they're guilty. Hmm.

The statute's first part says the person's duty is to refrain from using force if they know they're being arrested. So if the suspect knew he was being arrested, he should have been quiet. But he didn't resist arrest when he was arrested. Instead, he tried to use force. So if the statute applies, he should be guilty if he didn't resist properly.

But wait, the statute is about the duty of the arrested person. So the arrest is unlawful if the circumstances don't meet probable cause. But the question doesn't say there was probable cause. It just says the police officer believed the suspect was involved. So maybe the arrest was lawful because the police had good reason to believe the suspect was involved.

Wait, but the key here is that the statute applies to the person being arrested. So if he knew he was being arrested, he must resist arrest. So if he didn't resist, but the police took him in (hit him), that's the issue.

So the statute's duty is to refrain from using force. If the suspect tried to resist, he should be guilty if he was in a position to resist. But if he's lying about what happened, maybe he's not guilty. Alternatively, if he was in a position to resist and lied, he might not be guilty.

But the statute says that after arrest, if the person knows they're being arrested, they must refrain from using force. So if the suspect tried to resist arrest, and the police lawfully arrested him (if that's what he believed), then he should be guilty. But if the police were justified in arresting, then the truth of the account matters.

Wait, in this case, the suspect gave two different accounts. One where he hit after resisting, the other where he cursed and the officer hit. The suspect ended up being convicted of assault. So the question is which option is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Not guilty if arrest was unlawful without probable cause, and the jury believes the suspect's account.

Option B: Not guilty if arrest was lawful, and the jury believes suspect's account.

Option C: Guilty if arrest was lawful, regardless of the account.

Option D: Guilty if arrest was unlawful, regardless of the account.

So, the statute applies to the arrested person. So if the suspect was arrested, he must refrain from using force if he knew he was being arrested. But if he tried to resist and was in a position to, then he must not use force. So if he did resist, he's guilty. If he didn't resist, but the police lawfully arrested him, then he's guilty because he should have been quiet.

Wait, but if the suspect told the truth about what happened next, then he should be guilty. If he lied, he might not be.

But the question is whether the suspect is guilty. So the key is whether the suspect's actions were in a position to resist arrest.

In the scenario, the police officer believed the suspect was involved. So if the police were justified in arresting him, then the suspect must have been in a position to resist. So if he did resist and was in a position, then he's guilty. If he didn't resist, perhaps he's not guilty. But in this case, the suspect's account is what's important.

Wait, but the statute's duty is that if the person knows they're being arrested, they must refrain from using force. So if he tried to resist and knew he was being arrested, he should not have used force. But in this case, he did use force.

So the statute would make him guilty. But wait, no, because if the statute applies, the person must refrain. So if the suspect told the truth about what happened, then he was in a position to resist, so he should be guilty. But the statute says if he knew or should know, he must refrain.

Wait, no: the statute says, "it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest." So the duty is to not use force, if they knew they were being arrested. But if they did use force, they're guilty.

So if the suspect told the truth about what happened and tried to resist arrest, he should be guilty. But if he lied, then he might not be.

Wait, the question is whether the suspect was found guilty or not. So, the key is whether the statute's duty applies.

If the arrest was unlawful, the police officer's belief might not affect the guilt. Wait, noâ€”because if the arrest was unlawful, the police might have had probable cause to arrest, but the statute applies to the arrested person regardless of the police's belief. So if the suspect knew he was being arrested, he must have been quiet. If he wasn't quiet, he's guilty.

Wait, but the statute is about the person being arrested, not the police officer. So the arrest's legality is a separate issue. So if the police did an unlawful arrest (no probable cause), then the statute might not apply because the person might not have had the right to resist.

But the question doesn't say whether the arrest was lawful or unlawful. It just says that the police believed the suspect was involved, and the suspect claimed he cursed and the police hit him. The suspect was found guilty.

Wait, but the statute would require that during arrest, the person knows they're being arrested and refrain from using force. So if the suspect tried to resist arrest, and the police were lawfully arresting him, then he should be guilty.

But in this case, the police officer took him and hit him. So the suspect might have been in a position to resist. If he was, then he should have been quiet, but he was not. So he's guilty.

But wait, the statute says that if he knew he was being arrested, he must refrain. So if he tried to use force, he's guilty regardless of the truth of his account. Because the statute says he must refrain, so if he did use force, that's a violation.

So, whether the account is truthful or not, the statute says he must not use force. So even if he lied about what happened next, he's guilty because he used force.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the suspect tried to resist arrest, and the police were lawfully arresting him, then the statute says he must not use force. So he used force, thus guilty. But if the suspect lied and didn't resist arrest, then he was not in a position to resist, so the statute doesn't apply, and he's not guilty. Because he didn't know he was being arrested, so he didn't have to refrain.

Wait, but the statute says that the person's duty is to refrain if they knew they were being arrested. So regardless of whether they did resist or not, if they knew they were being arrested, they should not use force. So if they did use force, that's a violation of the statute.

So in the scenario, the suspect was in a position to resist arrest, and he did use force, so he's guilty. But if the suspect didn't know and the police didn't arrest him, then the statute doesn't apply because the person didn't know they were being arrested.

Wait, but in this case, the suspect did know he was being arrested. So he must have been quiet. If he wasn't, he's guilty. If he did resist, he's guilty.

But the question is whether he's guilty or not. Because the statute says he must refrain if he knew, regardless of whether he did resist.

So in this case, the suspect did use force. So he's guilty. Unless the arrest was unlawful.

Wait, but if the arrest was unlawful, the police officer's belief might not matter. Because the statute would still apply to the person being arrested, whether or not the police did it unlawfully.

So, if the arrest was lawful, the statute applies, and the suspect must not have used force. But in this case, he did, so he's guilty. If the arrest was unlawful, the statute applies to the person but the police's belief doesn't affect the guilt because the statute's duty is on the arrested person regardless.

Wait, but the question is whether the suspect is found guilty. So, let's think about the options.

Option A: Not guilty if the arrest wasn't unlawful without probable cause, and the jury believes the account. So, if the arrest was unlawful (no probability), then the statute might not apply. Because the person wasn't in a position to resist. So, if the suspect didn't resist, he's not guilty.

But the statute's duty is to refrain if the person knows they're being arrested. So if the police didn't arrest him, then the person's awareness doesn't apply, so the statute doesn't require him to refrain. So if the suspect didn't resist, he's not guilty.

But in this case, he did resist. So he's guilty regardless. But the statute says he must not use force. So if he did use force, he's guilty.

Wait, but the statute's duty is to refrain if he knew he was being arrested. So regardless of whether he was in a position to resist, he must not use force.

So, if he did use force, he's guilty. So the guilt depends on whether he used force. But the question is about whether he's found guilty.

So, in the options, option A says not guilty if the arrest was unlawful (no prob cause) and the account is believed. So if the arrest was unlawful, the statute doesn't apply to him because he wasn't in a position to resist. So if the suspect didn't resist, he's not guilty.

But in the scenario, he did resist. So he's guilty. So option A says not guilty, which would be incorrect.

Option D says guilty if the arrest was unlawful, regardless of the account. So if the arrest was unlawful, suspect is guilty. But what about if the arrest was lawful?

If the arrest was lawful, the statute applies. So if the suspect knew he was being arrested, he was in a position to resist. He did use force, so he's guilty. So, if the arrest was lawful, suspect is guilty. If unlawful, also guilty.

But the question doesn't say whether the arrest was lawful. It just says that the police believed the suspect was involved. So if the police were lawfully arresting, then the statute applies. If not, suspect is not guilty.

But the question is about whether the suspect was found guilty, regardless.

The statute says that the arrested person must refrain if they knew. So regardless of the account, if they knew, they must not use force. So, the actual account (truthfulness) doesn't matter. Because if the account is true, they're in a position to resist, so they shouldn't have used force.

Wait, but if the account is truthful and they tried to resist, they are in position to resist, so they should have been quiet. So, if they didn't, they're guilty.

So, the guilt depends on whether they were in a position to resist. If they were, then they have to refrain. If not, they don't have to refrain.

In this case, the suspect's account is that after arrest, he cursed and the officer hit him. So the question is, did he resist arrest?

The police officer took him, so he tried to resist. So yes, he was in a position to resist.

So, he should have been quiet. But he wasn't. So he's guilty.

But the statute says if he knew and should know, he must not use force. So regardless of his actions, because he knew, he must not have used force. So he is guilty.

So, the correct option would be the one that says if the arrest was unlawful, he's guilty, regardless of the account.

Looking at the options, option D says guilty if the arrest was unlawful, regardless.

But the question is whether the suspect should be found guilty regardless of the account. So if the arrest was unlawful, regardless of the account, he's guilty.

Wait, but in this scenario, the police believed the suspect was involved. So perhaps the arrest was lawful, but the suspect's account is what matters.

Alternatively, the statute's application depends on whether the arrest was lawful or not.

Wait, the statute applies to the person being arrested. So regardless of the police's belief, if the suspect was arrested, he must refrain if he knew. So if the suspect did resist, then he's guilty regardless of whether the police were lawfully arresting.

So, if the suspect used force, he's guilty. If the suspect didn't resist, he's not guilty.

But in the scenario, he did resist. So he's guilty regardless of the account. So option D says guilty if the arrest was unlawful, regardless. But what if the arrest was lawful?

Wait, the statute says, "whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest."

So, regardless of whether the police lawfully arrested, if the person knew they were being arrested, they must refrain.

So, if the suspect used force, regardless of whether the police were lawfully arresting, he's guilty.

But the question is, the suspect's account has implications. If he told the truth, he was in a position to resist, so he should have been quiet. If he lied, he wasn't.

So, in the scenario, the suspect was in a position to resist. He did resist and used force, so he's guilty. His account might be truthful or not, but the statute requires him not to use force.

Now, the options: looking for whether the suspect is guilty.

So, if the arrest was unlawful, suspect is guilty regardless of account. If lawful, guilty if he knew.

But the question is, regardless of the account, is the suspect guilty?

The options:

A: if arrest was unlawful, not guilty if account is believed.

B: if lawful, not guilty.

C: guilty if lawful.

D: guilty if unlawful.

So, in this scenario, suspect used force. So, if the arrest was unlawful, he's guilty.

But if the arrest was lawful, even if he lied, he's guilty.

But the question is whether the suspect should be found guilty regardless of the account. So, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless of the account, he's guilty.

But the question doesn't say whether the arrest was unlawful. It just says that the police believed the suspect was involved. So the arrest was perhaps lawful, but the suspect's account might not have been truthful.

So, the statute would require him to not use force if he knew. So if he did use force, whether the account is truthful or not, he's guilty.

But the options relate to the outcome based on account beliefs.

Looking at option D: guilty if the arrest was unlawful, regardless of account.

But in this case, the police believed the suspect was involved, but the statute's application depends on whether he knew. If the police were lawfully arresting, then he was in position to resist. So he should have been quiet, but he wasn't, so he's guilty.

But the police's belief about the account doesn't affect the guilt because the statute's duty is on the person being arrested, regardless of the police's belief.

So, the correct answer would be option D: guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless of the account.

Wait, but wait. If the arrest was lawful, the statute applies, so the suspect must not have used force. So if he did, he's guilty.

But if the arrest was unlawful, he's guilty regardless.

But the question is whether the suspect was found guilty regardless of account. So the answer should be D: guilty if the arrest was unlawful, regardless of the account.

But wait, no. Because the statute applies to the person being arrested, regardless of the police's belief. So if the suspect was in a position to resist, he must have been quiet. He wasn't, so he's guilty.

So, the correct answer is option D: guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless of the account.

Wait, but option D says guilty if the arrest was unlawful, regardless of account. So if the arrest was unlawful, regardless of whether the account was truthful or not, he's guilty.

But the statute's duty is to refrain if the person knew. So regardless of whether they used force, if they knew, they shouldn't have used.

But if the account is truthful, and they used force, then he's guilty. If the account is not truthful, but the person knew, then he's guilty.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The statute's duty is to refrain if the person knew. So if they did, regardless of the account, they can't have used. So in the scenario, he did use force, so he's guilty.

But the options are about guilt based on account.

So, the conclusion is that if the arrest was unlawful (meaning the person must have known), the suspect is guilty regardless. But if the arrest was lawful, and the account is truthful, the suspect is guilty if he used force.

But the options don't specify that if the arrest was lawful. The question is, regardless of account, is the suspect guilty.

So, the correct answer is D: guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless of the account.

Wait, but if the arrest was unlawful, the statute's duty is to refrain. So if the suspect did use force, he's guilty.

But the statute says if the person knew they were being arrested, they must not use force. So the actual account doesn't matter, because the statute's duty is to not use force if they knew.

So, regardless of the account, if the suspect knew, he must not use force. So if he did, he's guilty.

So, the correct answer is D: guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless of the account.

Wait, but wait again. If the arrest was unlawful, the statute's duty is to refrain, which would mean that the suspect shouldn't have used force. But in the scenario, the suspect used force, so he's guilty.

So, the statute's duty is to refrain if the person knew. So regardless of the account, if the person knew, they shouldn't have used force, so if they did, guilty.

So, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless of account, he's guilty. So the correct option is D.
</think>

The statute requires the arrested person to refrain from using force if they knew or should know they were being arrested. In this scenario, the suspect knew he was being arrested and used force, so he was **guilty**. The police's belief about the account does not affect the statute's duty, as the duty is on the arrested person, not the police officer. 

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. If the arrest was unlawful, the statute's duty to refrain does not apply, and the suspect is not guilty. However, if the arrest was lawful, the statute's duty applies regardless of the account.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. If the arrest was lawful, the statute's duty applies, and the suspect is not guilty because he did not refrain. If the arrest was lawful, the account does not matter.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. If the arrest was lawful, the statute's duty applies, and the suspect is not guilty regardless of the account.
- **Option D**: Correct. If the arrest was unlawful, regardless of the account, the suspect is guilty because the statute requires the person to refrain if they knew they were being arrested.

### Conclusion:
The statute requires the arrested person to refrain from using force if they knew they were being arrested. In this case, the suspect knew and used force, so he was **guilty**. The police's belief about the account does not affect the statute's duty, as the duty is on the arrested person.

ANSWER: D
