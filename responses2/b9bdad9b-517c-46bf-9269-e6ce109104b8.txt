Okay, let's see. I've got this problem about the stock price of company XYZ. So, the stock starts at $24.75 at the beginning of the week. Then, over five days, it gains or loses some amount each day. I need to figure out the price at the end of Friday.

First, I'll list the changes each day. On Monday, it gained $2.50. That means the price goes up by 2.50. Then on Tuesday, it lost $3.25. So, that's a decrease of 3.25. Wednesday had a loss of $0.75, so another decrease. Thursday, a gain of $1.25, and Friday, another gain of $4.75.

I think the best way is to add up all these changes and then add them to the original price. Let me write that out.

Starting price: $24.75.

Monday: +$2.50. So, 24.75 + 2.50 = ?

Let me calculate that: 24.75 + 2 is 26.75, plus 0.50 more is 27.25. So, after Monday, it's $27.25.

Tuesday: -$3.25. So, subtract 3.25 from 27.25. Let's see, 27.25 minus 3 is 24.25, then minus 0.25 is 24.00. So, now it's $24.00.

Wednesday: -$0.75. Subtract 0.75 from 24.00, which gives 23.25.

Thursday: +$1.25. Add 1.25 to 23.25. 23 + 1 is 24, plus 0.25 is 24.25, plus 0.25 is 24.50.

Wait, no, wait. 23.25 + 1.25: 23 +1 is 24, 0.25 + 0.25 is 0.50. So, total is 24.50.

Friday: +$4.75. So add 4.75 to 24.50. Let's break it down. 24 +4 is 28, 0.50 +0.75 is 1.25. So 28 +1.25 is 29.25.

So, the final price is $29.25. Looking at the options, let's see what's there. Option C is $29.25, so that should be the answer.
</think>

The stock starts at $24.75. 

**Monday:** +$2.50 → $27.25  
**Tuesday:** -$3.25 → $24.00  
**Wednesday:** -$0.75 → $23.25  
**Thursday:** +$1.25 → $24.50  
**Friday:** +$4.75 → $29.25  

The price at the end of Friday is $29.25, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
