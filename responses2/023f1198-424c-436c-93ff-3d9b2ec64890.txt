Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about Anscombe's views on moral psychology. Let me start by recalling what I know about the question and the options provided.

The question is asking what Anscombe believes an adequate moral psychology should include. The options are labeled from A to J. 

I remember that Anscombe is a philosopher known for his contributions to moral philosophy, especially in the context of rationality and the mind-body problem. His work often involved discussions about the nature of morality, decision-making, and how people's minds are connected to their behaviors.

Looking at the options:

A: a detailed understanding of societal norms and expectations.
B: a comprehensive review of historical philosophical theories.
C: the influence of personal experiences on moral decisions.
D: analyses of concepts such as “action” and “intention.”
E: the integration of religious beliefs into moral decisions.
F: a thorough study of the subconscious mind.
G: all of the above.
H: an exploration of the concept of 'good' and 'evil'.
I: an answer to the mind-body problem.
J: an explanation of how free will is possible.

I think Anscombe's work is particularly known for his discussions about how people's actions are influenced by their subconscious thoughts and emotions, which relates to the mind-body problem. He might argue that understanding the subconscious is crucial for a comprehensive theory of morality.

Option C talks about the influence of personal experiences, which is a key aspect of his approach. He tends to emphasize that moral decisions are shaped by an individual's experiences and feelings. So, this is probably part of his view.

Option G says all of the above. But I don't think that's accurate. Each option makes a different point. For example, while societal norms and experiences are important, a comprehensive review of historical philosophical theories might not be something he would focus on as essential for moral psychology. Plus, integrating religion into moral decisions is another area where he might not have emphasized. So G seems too broad.

Option F is about the subconscious mind. That rings a bell with his theory. He's associated with the idea that the subconscious influences our decisions, which is a part of his understanding.

Option H is about 'good' and 'evil,' which relates to traditional moral theories. I'm not sure if he would include this in his view. Maybe he does, but I'm not certain.

Option J is about free will. I think that's more of a biological consideration, but some argue that the mind-body problem is a part of free will. But I'm not sure if Anscombe's work includes this.

Option D talks about action and intention. Action is about what someone does, and intention relates to why they do it. He might discuss how these concepts are studied in moral psychology.

Wait, let me think about more specific points. Anscombe is known for his work on the mind-body problem, which is option I. But I'm not sure if he included that in his views. Also, he did discuss the role of emotions and personal experiences, which might tie into option C.

Wait, option C says "the influence of personal experiences on moral decisions." That aligns with his understanding of how people's subconscious thoughts and emotions shape their behavior. I think he might have emphasized that.

Option F is about the subconscious mind. That's a key part of his theory, so he would likely include that.

Option H is about 'good' and 'evil.' I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think that's a traditional aspect of moral philosophy, but I'm not sure if he would include it in his psychological model.

Option G is all of the above. Since I'm unsure about H, G might not be correct.

So, the options that seem correct are C and F and H. Wait, but the question is which is included in an adequate moral psychology according to Anscombe.

Let me think about the options again. Option C is about personal experiences influencing decisions. Option F is about studying the subconscious mind. Both seem relevant. But what about H?

I'm trying to recall if Anscombe's work included the concept of 'good' and 'evil.' I think he had a model where "good" and "evil" are central concepts, but perhaps he's more focused on the role of individual factors, like emotions and experiences, rather than just a binary concept.

Wait, another angle: the mind-body problem is the essence of option I, but was it included in his work? I'm trying to remember, but I think he might have had an answer to that problem, which is about whether the mind and body are separate or connected. So perhaps he explored that, but not necessarily H.

So, the options that seem correct are C, F, and H.

Wait, but the question is asking which option is included in an adequate moral psychology according to Anscombe. So, if all three (C, F, H) are correct, then the answer would be G. But I'm not sure if it's all of them.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G, but I'm a bit unsure because it's possible that one of the other options is more central.

Wait, another thought: the mind-body problem is a central issue in his work. So, option I is about that. But the question is about what he includes. So, does he include it? Or is it more about other aspects?

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think of another approach. The question is about what he includes in his adequate moral psychology. So, each of these options is a possible component.

Option C: influence of personal experiences. That's a key part of his view, as personal experiences (like family, culture, etc.) shape moral decisions.

Option F: study of the subconscious mind. That would be part of his approach to understanding how our behavior is shaped by our thoughts and emotions.

Option H: explore 'good' and 'evil.' I'm not as sure about this. Maybe it's more about traditional or biological concepts, whereas his model focuses on individual factors.

So, perhaps the correct answer is G, which states "all of the above," but I'm not sure if all three are included in his view.

Alternatively, perhaps option C and F are correct, and G is incorrect because not all are included.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of each option's inclusion:

- A: societal norms — likely, since people adapt to those, but maybe not as crucial as personal experiences.

- B: comprehensive review — not sure. His work might not have a comprehensive historical review, but I'm not certain.

- C: personal experiences — yes, that's a big part of his approach.

- D: action and intention — yes, because action is about what you do, and intention is why you do that.

- E: integration of religion — perhaps not, as religion might not be a central part of his model.

- F: study of the subconscious — yes, as he's known for this.

- H: 'good' and 'evil' — I'm less certain. Maybe it's a traditional aspect, but perhaps not the most central part of his model.

- I: mind-body problem — I think he had an answer, but maybe not the focus.

- J: free will — perhaps, but I'm not sure.

So, if the question is which are all included, then G might not be correct because not all are included.

Wait, but I'm trying to remember. I think that in his work, he emphasizes that personal experiences and emotions are crucial. So, option C is correct.

But then, option F is about the subconscious mind, which is a part of his approach, so that's correct too.

And option H, which is about 'good' and 'evil,' I'm not entirely sure. Some argue that his model focuses on individual factors, so perhaps he doesn't include this aspect.

Alternatively, perhaps he does, but I'm not certain.

So, the options that are correct are C, F, and H. But if the question is which is included, and the options are given as G: all of the above, that would be incorrect because H might not be included.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "an adequate moral psychology would include." So, which of the options are all included.

Wait, another thought: maybe all of these are part of his understanding. So, the adequate theory would include understanding of personal experiences, the subconscious mind, and the concepts of 'good' and 'evil'.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G, which is a general statement that all these aspects are included, but that might not be the case.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the correct answer from what I remember.

I believe that Anscombe's work includes the influence of personal experiences (C), the study of the subconscious mind (F), and the analysis of concepts like 'good' and 'evil' (H). So, all three are included, making G correct. Therefore, the answer would be G: all of the above.

But another thought: the mind-body problem (I) is about whether the mind and body are separate. I'm not sure if he included that. Also, he might have an answer to it, but perhaps not all aspects of it are included.

Wait, no. The mind-body problem is a separate issue. I'm a bit unsure about that.

Wait, looking it up in my memory, Anscombe's views on the mind-body problem might involve whether mental phenomena are reducible to physical processes. So, perhaps his answer to the mind-body problem is that they are not separable, but he might have an understanding of how to address it, but perhaps doesn't include it as a core aspect of his theory.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option G, as all three (C, F, H) are correct, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, but the question is a bit tricky. It might be that all three are included, so G is correct. So, the answer is G.

To determine the correct answer, we need to evaluate each option based on insights from the question and relevant knowledge about Anscombe's work in moral psychology.

1. **Option A**: A detailed understanding of societal norms and expectations. While societal norms are important, they are not the primary focus of Anscombe's approach, which emphasizes personal experiences and emotions.

2. **Option B**: A comprehensive review of historical philosophical theories. This is unlikely, as Anscombe's work does not suggest a broad historical review of philosophy.

3. **Option C**: The influence of personal experiences on moral decisions. This aligns with Anscombe's emphasis on how personal experiences shape behavior, making this a key component of his theory.

4. **Option D**: Analysis of concepts like "action" and "intention." Anscombe discusses these concepts, which suggests they are included in his approach.

5. **Option E**: Integration of religious beliefs. This is not a central aspect of his views, which focus more on individual factors.

6. **Option F**: Study of the subconscious mind. Anscombe is well-known for his work on the subconscious mind, making this a valid point.

7. **Option H**: Exploration of the concept of 'good' and 'evil.' While traditional moral theories include these concepts, Anscombe's model emphasizes individual factors, so this might not be included.

8. **Option I**: Addressing the mind-body problem. Anscombe's work includes an answer to this problem, but it may not be a core aspect of his theory.

9. **Option J**: Explanation of free will. This is a biological concept, not central to his moral theory.

Considering Anscombe's focus on personal experiences, the subconscious mind, and individual concepts like "good" and "evil," the correct answer is **G: all of the above**. However, if the question requires selecting the most comprehensive option, **G** is the best choice.
