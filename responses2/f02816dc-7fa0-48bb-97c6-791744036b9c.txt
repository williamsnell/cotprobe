Question:

IfDNAaseis added to a bacterial cell, the DNA is hydrolyzed , the cell cannot make any more proteins and eventually dies. IfDNAaseis added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. Explain.

Options:

A: The virus uses a special type of DNA that is resistant to DNAase.
B: The RNA virus is not affected by DNAase since it contains RNA, not DNA.
C: DNAase selectively degrades only bacterial DNA, not viral DNA.
D: The virus has a protective protein coat that prevents DNAase from reaching its genetic material.
E: DNAase triggers a dormant state in the virus, during which it does not need to produce proteins.
F: The virus is immune to DNAase
G: The virus contains both DNA and RNA
H: The virus encodes for a DNAase inhibitor that protects its genetic material.
I: The virus transforms DNAase into RNAase
J: The virus quickly repairs its DNA after DNAase damage.

Okay, so I've got this question about DNA and RNA viruses and DNAase. Hmm, let me think. I remember that DNA and RNA are different, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. 

The question says that DNAase is added to a bacterial cell. It hydrolyzes DNA, so the cell can't make any more proteins and dies. But if DNAase is added to an RNA virus, the virus continues to produce proteins. Why is that?

Wait, so DNAase is an enzyme that breaks down DNA. If DNAase is applied to a bacterial cell, the cell can't make proteins because DNA isn't there anymore. But when DNAase is added to an RNA virus, the virus can make proteins. So why does that happen?

I think the key is that RNA (ribonucleic acid) is processed differently from DNA. RNA isn't broken down by DNAases. Oh right! Because DNA is double-stranded, and an enzyme like DNAase needs to cleave both strands. RNA, on the other hand, is single-stranded, so an enzyme doesn't need to break both strands. So when DNA is present, an enzyme like DNAase can cut it, making proteins. But RNA doesn't have that problem.

Wait, the question is about how DNAase affects the viruses. So when DNA is present (like in a bacterial cell), DNAase breaks down the DNA, so the cell can't make proteins. But if DNA isn't present, then the enzyme can't act. But wait, the question is about adding DNAase to the virus. So the virus probably has DNA in it. Oh, but wait, the question says that when DNAase is added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce proteins. That implies that the virus doesn't rely on the DNA to be broken down.

So if the virus's DNA is intact, adding DNAase won't affect it because DNAase can't cut DNA. So the virus can still make proteins. That would explain why the RNA viruses survive despite DNAase. 

Looking at the options, option B says RNA viruses don't have DNA, so DNAase doesn't target them. That makes sense. Because DNA is necessary for replication and protein production. If it's not there, the virus can't make proteins. 

Wait, the options: option B says the RNA virus is not affected by DNAase because it contains RNA. Hmm, that fits. Because DNAase acts on DNA, which is needed for replication and protein synthesis. Since the virus doesn't have DNA (or its DNA isn't protected?), but wait, no, the question says DNAase is added to the RNA viruses. So if the virus's DNA is intact, adding DNAase won't do anything. But if the RNA is the material, then DNAase wouldn't affect it.

Alternatively, maybe the virus has a different mechanism. Like, DNA is a component, but maybe the RNA is processed differently. Oh, another thought: DNA is double-stranded, so an enzyme like DNAase would need to cleave both strands. RNA is single-stranded. So adding DNAase to RNA doesn't affect it. So the RNA virus can still produce proteins, which explains why when DNA is present, it's broken down, but when it's not, it's alive.

So the correct answer is option B: the RNA virus contains RNA, not DNA. Therefore, DNAase doesn't work against it.

The question explores how DNAases affect RNA viruses compared to bacterial cells. DNAases are enzymes that hydrolyze DNA, breaking it down into smaller fragments. When added to a bacterial cell, DNA is broken, preventing the cell from synthesizing proteins and leading to cell death. However, RNA viruses do not rely on DNA for replication or protein synthesis. Since DNA is not present in RNA viruses, DNAase cannot degrade them. This explains why RNA viruses can continue to produce proteins despite the addition of DNAases.

**Option B** correctly states that RNA viruses are not affected by DNAase because they contain RNA, not DNA. This is the correct answer.

**Answer: B**
