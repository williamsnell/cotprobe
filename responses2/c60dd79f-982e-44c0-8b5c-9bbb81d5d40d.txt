Okay, so I've got this question about the order of an element in a direct product of cyclic groups. The element given is (4, 2) in Z_12 × Z_8. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on group theory, but let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the order of an element (a, b) in the direct product of two groups is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of a and b individually. So, to find the order of (4, 2), I need to find the order of 4 in Z_12 and the order of 2 in Z_8, then take their LCM.

Let me start with the first component, 4 in Z_12. The order of an element in Z_n is given by n divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the element and n. So, GCD(4, 12). What's the GCD of 4 and 12? Well, 4 divides into 12 three times exactly, so the GCD is 4. So the order of 4 is 12 divided by 4, which is 3. So the order of 4 in Z_12 is 3.

Next, the second component is 2 in Z_8. Again, the order is n divided by GCD(a, n). Here, GCD(2, 8). The GCD of 2 and 8 is 2. So the order is 8 divided by 2, which is 4. So the order of 2 in Z_8 is 4.

Now, to find the order of the element (4, 2), I take the LCM of 3 and 4. The LCM of 3 and 4 is 12, because 3 and 4 have no common factors other than 1. So, the LCM is 12. 

Wait, let me double-check that. The LCM of 3 and 4: multiples of 3 are 3,6,9,12,15... multiples of 4 are 4,8,12,16... So the smallest common multiple is 12. Yep, that makes sense.

So the order of (4,2) is 12. Looking at the options, G is 12. So the answer should be G.

The order of the element (4, 2) in Z_12 × Z_8 is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of 4 in Z_12 and 2 in Z_8. 

- The order of 4 in Z_12: GCD(4,12) = 4 → Order = 12/4 = 3.
- The order of 2 in Z_8: GCD(2,8) = 2 → Order = 8/2 = 4.
- LCM of 3 and 4 is 12.

Thus, the order is 12, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
