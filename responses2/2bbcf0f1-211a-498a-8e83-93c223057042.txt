Okay, so I have this question here about the place value of digits in two different numbers. Let me read it again. The question is asking: The value of the digit 5 in 24,513 is how many times the value of the digit 5 in 357? And there are options from A to J.

Hmm, I think I need to figure out the place value of each 5 and then compare them. Let's start with the first number: 24,513. The digits are 2, 4, 5, 1, 3. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the number is 24,513. Let's write it out with commas for clarity. 24,513 is 2 digits, then a comma, then 513. So the places are: the first digit is in the ten thousands place, the next is thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones. So 2 is in ten thousands, 4 is thousands, 5 is hundreds, 1 is tens, 3 is ones. So the digit 5 here is in the hundreds place.

Now, the second number is 357. That's a three-digit number. The first digit is 3 (hundreds place), the second is 5 (tens place), and the third is 7 (ones place). So the digit 5 here is in the tens place.

Wait, but the question is about the value of each 5. So in 24,513, the 5 is in the hundreds place, which means its value is 5 multiplied by 100, so 500. In 357, the 5 is in the tens place, so its value is 5 multiplied by 10, which is 50.

The question is asking how many times more is the value of the 5 in 24,513 compared to the 5 in 357. So we're looking for the ratio of 500 to 50. Let me calculate that: 500 divided by 50 equals 10. So the value of 5 in 24,513 is 10 times the value of the 5 in 357.

Looking at the options, F is 10. So the answer should be F.

The value of the digit 5 in 24,513 is 500 (hundreds place), and in 357 it's 50 (tens place). Dividing 500 by 50 gives 10. So the answer is F, which is 10.

Answer: F
