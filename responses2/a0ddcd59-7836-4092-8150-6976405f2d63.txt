Okay, so I've got this probability question here about tossing two dice. The question is asking for the probability that the sum is either 6 or 7. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with two dice, each die has numbers from 1 to 6. So, the possible sums range from 2 (1+1) to 12 (6+6). 

The problem is about the probability of getting a sum of 6 or 7. I think the best way to approach this is to find all the possible outcomes that result in a sum of 6 or 7, then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice.

Wait, how many possible outcomes are there in total when rolling two dice? Oh right, each die has 6 sides, so 6 multiplied by 6 gives 36 possible outcomes. So, the denominator of the probability will be 36.

Now, let me find the number of favorable outcomes for each sum separately and then add them up. 

Starting with a sum of 6. What are the possible pairs? Let's list them:
1. 1 and 5 (1+5=6)
2. 2 and 4 (2+4=6)
3. 3 and 3 (3+3=6)
4. 4 and 2 (4+2=6)
5. 5 and 1 (5+1=6)

Wait, that's 5 combinations. So there are 5 ways to get a sum of 6.

Next, the sum of 7. Let's list the possible pairs here:
1. 1 and 6 (1+6=7)
2. 2 and 5 (2+5=7)
3. 3 and 4 (3+4=7)
4. 4 and 3 (4+3=7)
5. 5 and 2 (5+2=7)
6. 6 and 1 (6+1=7)

That's 6 combinations. So, 6 ways to get a sum of 7.

Adding those together, 5 + 6 = 11 favorable outcomes. So the probability is 11/36.

Looking at the options, option J is 11/36. So the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is J: 11/36.
