Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given options is in the non-basic employment sector. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I should probably understand what "non-basic employment" means. I think it refers to jobs that aren't in the lowest paid bracket but aren't in the highest either. So it's somewhere in the middle. Maybe something that's moderately paid but not the cheapest or the highest paying jobs.

Looking at the options, let me go through each one:

A: Parking lot attendant. That sounds like a job where you're helping people park their cars. I think parking attendants might be considered basic because they're essential for managing the parking lot, which is part of the infrastructure. So probably not basic.

B: Commercial airline pilot. That's a high-paying job, definitely in the upper-middle bracket. So probably not the answer.

C: Chemical plant operator. These operators are involved in chemical manufacturing, which seems like a specialized and probably higher-paying field. So not basic.

D: Oil refinery worker. That's another specialized job, usually higher than basic, so probably not.

E: F-10 pickup truck assembly-line worker. I'm not too familiar, but I think F-10 trucks are used for delivering goods, so assembly-line workers here might be needed in manufacturing, which is a moderately paid job. Maybe that's in the non-basic range.

F: Medical researcher. Medical research is at the top of the paid spectrum, so definitely not basic.

G: Aerospace engineer. That sounds like it's in a high-paying field, probably in the upper-middle or upper bracket.

H: Software engineer. That's another specialized job, probably higher than basic.

I: Agriculture technician. This seems like a basic job because it's directly involved in agriculture, part of the daily work for farming or rural areas. So probably not basic.

So the candidates are E and I. I think I is agriculture technician, which is definitely basic. So E, the F-10 truck assembly-line worker, must be in the non-basic sector. Because they're not the lowest paid but also not the highest, and their job is more specialized but still requires some skills.

The correct answer is E: F-10 pickup truck assembly-line worker. This job is moderately paid and falls into the non-basic employment sector.

Answer: E
