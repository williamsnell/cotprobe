Question:

A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician because of easy bruising for 4 months. She has a history of lung cancer treated with radiation therapy 6 months ago. She has a 2-year history of hypertension treated with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no abnormalities except for multiple ecchymoses. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13 g/dL, leukocyte count is 5000/mm3 , and platelet count is 35,000/mm3 . A serum antiplatelet antibody assay is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

Options:

A: CT scan of the abdomen
B: CT scan of the chest
C: Bronchoscopy
D: Bone marrow aspiration

Okay, so I'm trying to help this doctor with a patient. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The patient is a 67-year-old woman who's been seeing the physician for four months with easy bruising. That makes me think of something like a tumor growing in the lung. She had lung cancer treated with radiation therapy six months ago. So that's a good sign—radiotherapy should have helped her manage her condition better.

She also has hypertension treated with thiazide diuretic and ACE inhibitor. Hypertension can cause other issues like pulmonary hypertension, which is a common condition in people with cancer. So both her treatment history and her current symptoms point towards a lung cancer presentation of high blood pressure.

Her examination shows no abnormalities except for multiple ecchymoses. Wait, what's that? Oh, ecchymoses are those small tumors in the lung—like small tumors that don't look significant. So she has a lot of lung tissue growth. That's concerning because if there are multiple small tumors, especially in the lung, that can be a sign of malignancy, but it's not always a definitive sign.

Her lab results are her hemoglobin is 13 g/dL, which is pretty low. Low hemoglobin is a red flag. Also, her leukocyte count is 5000/mm³, which is very high. High leukocytes typically indicate inflammation, which makes sense since she has a history of hypertension and possibly a tumor.

Platelet count is 35,000/mm³, which is below the normal range. The normal is usually around 15,000-50,000. A low platelet count can indicate various things, like infection, inflammation, or a malignancy. But in this case, since her antiplatelet antibody is negative, that might mean it's not a blood thinning issue or a blood flow problem. So, she's probably not at risk of bleeding from her blood vessels, which is good.

Looking at her hemoglobin: 13 g/dL is extremely low. For adults, normal is around 10-15 g/dL, but it's usually 12-15 for women and 12-17 for men. So this is way below normal. That's concerning because elevated blood pressure can lead to low hemoglobin if the heart isn't working well.

Her platelet count is also low, which suggests a problem with the body's ability to handle the risk factors, like high blood pressure or a tumor. But since her antiplatelet antibody is negative, it's probably not a plasma thrombogenic protein (PT) issue. So the problem is more likely in the organ or tissue itself.

Now, the question is about the next step in diagnosis. The options are CT scan of the abdomen, chest, bronchoscopy, bone marrow aspiration.

Option A: CT of the abdomen. That might look for issues in the digestive system, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Her symptoms are about her lungs with high blood pressure.

Option B: CT chest. That's for lung imaging. But wait, she's already been treated with radiation and has high blood pressure. A chest CT could help visualize any lung lesions. But given that her platelet count is low, the organ might not have been damaged. So a chest CT might not be the first step here.

Option C: Bronchoscopy. That would check the lungs for tumors or other lesions. Since her blood work is showing low hemoglobin, elevated leukocytes, and low platelets, and she has multiple ecchymoses, this could be a sign of malignancy. So a broncoscopy would be the next step.

Option D: Bone marrow aspiration. That's used for evaluating cancer types, like B cell or T cell. If there's a tumor, especially a small one, aspiration could help determine the type and possibly the treatment. But given the history of treatment with both diuretics and ACE inhibitors, it's more likely a tumor than a benign enlargement.

So the key here is the presence of multiple ecchymoses, high leukocytes, low platelets, and low hemoglobin. All of these are signs of malignancy, especially in the presence of a tumor like lung cancer. So the next logical step would be a Bronchoscopy to remove the tumor and confirm the diagnosis.

Looking at the options, option C is the correct next step.

The patient is a 67-year-old woman presenting with multiple ecchymoses, high blood pressure, and a history of lung cancer treatment. Her low hemoglobin (13 g/dL), elevated leukocyte count, and low platelet count suggest a malignancy. The next step is to confirm this by performing a Bronchoscopy. 

**Answer: C: Bronchoscopy**
