Okay, so I have to answer this multiple-choice question about gonorrhea. Let's see, the question is asking which statements about gonorrhea are true. The options are A to H, and I need to choose the correct ones.

First, I should recall what I know about gonorrhea. It's an infection caused by the bacterium P. gram-positive 16, which is also called Mycoplasma genitalium. I remember that it's a sexually transmitted infection, which means it can spread through sexual contact.

Looking at the options:

A: Always causes severe pain and discomfort. Hmm, I think it can cause pain, but I'm not sure if it's always severe. There are different stages, so it might not always be severe. Maybe it varies based on the infection's stage.

B: Can be treated with antibiotics. I believe that antibiotics can help treat gonorrhea, but I'm not certain about the specifics. Some treatments might involve antibiotics, but I don't think it's just that; perhaps it's a bit more involved.

C: Can be completely prevented with condoms. I don't think condoms prevent gonorrhea. They might reduce the risk, but they don't eliminate the infection entirely. It's a prevention method, not a cure.

D: Only affects men. Wait, I think that's not true. Herpes and gonorrhea can affect both men and women. For example, herpes affects the genital area, same with gonorrhea.

E: Infections are limited to genital areas. No, I remember that it can spread to other areas too, like the face and even the neck. So E is incorrect.

F: Is a viral infection. No, it's not a virus; it's a bacterial infection. So F is false.

G: Is a form of herpes. No, they're different infections. herpes is caused by herpes simplex virus, whereas gonorrhea is caused by Mycoplasma. So G is wrong.

H: Is asymptomatic (without symptoms) in only a small percentage of those infected. I think that's true. I remember reading that people can have the infection without any symptoms, which is called asymptomatic. The percentage is about 10-20%, so H is correct.

I: Can be cured with over-the-counter medication. I don't think so. Over-the-counter creams are not safe or effective for treating gonorrhea. They might reduce symptoms but won't cure the infection. So I is false.

Wait, let me double-check. So the options that are correct are H and E? No, E is incorrect because it's not limited to genital areas. So only H is correct. But wait, looking again, I thought earlier that option H is correct, but let me make sure.

Wait, another thought: I think I made a mistake. Option E says infections are limited to genital areas. No, I think it's more general. For example, I think it can spread to the face and other areas. So E is incorrect.

So the correct statements are H. Let me check the options again. The options are A to H. So the correct answer would be E is incorrect, so looking for the correct statements, only H is correct.

Wait, what about option E? It says "infections are limited to genital areas." I thought that was true, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me think. No, I think the infection can spread beyond the genital area, like to the face, neck, etc. So E is false.

So the correct options are H. But wait, looking at the list again, I might have missed something. Let me check all options again.

A: causes severe pain. Not always, but possible.

B: can be treated with antibiotics. Yes, it's a bacterial infection, so antibiotics are used.

C: prevented with condoms. No, it's a prevention, not a cure.

D: affects both genders. Yes, I think that's correct.

E: limited to genital areas. No, it's not. So E is false.

F: viral. No, it's bacterial.

G: form of herpes. No.

H: asymptomatic in small percentage. Correct.

I: cured with over-the-counter. No.

So the only correct statement is option H.
</think>

The correct answer is **H: is a form of herpes**.

**Explanation:**
- **H** is correct because gonorrhea is indeed a bacterial infection caused by Mycoplasma genitalium, which is distinct from herpes.
- Other options are incorrect because:
  - **D** is incorrect as both genders can be infected.
  - **E** is incorrect because the infection spreads beyond genital areas.
  - **A**, **B**, **C**, **D**, **F**, **G**, and **I** are incorrect for various reasons related to the infection's nature and treatment.

ANSWER: H
