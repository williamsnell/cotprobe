Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about social action types identified by Max Weber. I remember from my studies that Weber was a key figure in the development of operant conditioning. He talked about different ways people engage in social interactions, each with their own rationality.

The question gives four types: instrumentally-rational, value-rational, traditional, and then asks what comes next. The options are various forms of rationality, like normatively-rational, traditionally-rational, practically-rational, etc.

I recall that Weber categorized social actions into four main types. The first three are more about the nature of the action itself, and the fourth is about the type of rationality or the way the action is performed.

The first type is instrumentally-rational, which means actions are chosen because they maximize utility or benefit. The second is value-rational, which is based on the right values people hold. The third is traditional, which relates to societal norms and values. That leaves the fourth, which I think is about how the action is performed or how the person acts in that context.

Wait, I remember something about traditional being a type of "influenced" or "conformist" action. Alternatively, sometimes Weber referred to this as "practically-rational" as a category. Or maybe it's "effectively-rational." Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy here.

Wait, the options are A through H. Option A is normatively-rational, which is about the right values. But the fourth type isn't about the values but the way the action is performed. So the next type would be something about the method or how the action is performed.

Alternatively, perhaps the fourth type is called "practically-rational." Because practical actions are those that are performed in a real-world context, based on what's necessary, not necessarily tied to values. So the options for the fourth type would include things like practically-rational or effectively-rational.

Wait, another thought: Weber's types were about how people engage in social interactions, categorized into four. The four are: instrumentally-rational, value-rational, traditional, and then something else. The next type after traditional is "practically-rational" or "effectively-rational."

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The four types are:

1. Instrumentally-rational (operatively-rational)
2. Value-rational (value-based)
3. Traditional (social norms)
4. Practically-rational (practically operating)

So the fourth type is "practically-rational." So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is "practically-rational." So the correct answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: practically-rational.

**Answer:** C
