Alright, so I've got this double integral to compute over the rectangle R, which is defined as [-5,4] for the x-values and [0,3] for the y-values. The integrand is 2x minus 4y cubed. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a double integral over a rectangle can be evaluated by integrating first with respect to one variable and then the other. Since the integrand is a function of both x and y, I can split it into two separate integrals if it's separable. Let me check if 2x - 4y³ can be split into two functions, each depending on only one variable.

Yes, it looks like 2x is a function of x and -4y³ is a function of y. So I can split the integral into two: the integral of 2x dx from x = -5 to 4, and the integral of -4y³ dy from y = 0 to 3. Then, I multiply the results of these two integrals because they're independent.

Wait, is that right? Or do I have to consider the limits of integration for both variables? Let me think. Since the rectangle R is a product of intervals in x and y, I can indeed compute the integrals separately and then multiply them together. That should give the overall value of the double integral.

So, let's start with the x-integral. The integrand is 2x. The integral of 2x with respect to x is x squared, right? So when I evaluate from -5 to 4, it's (4)^2 - (-5)^2. Let me compute that: 16 minus 25, which is -9. So the x-integral gives me -9.

Now, the y-integral. The integrand is -4y³. The integral of y³ is (y⁴)/4, so multiplying by -4 gives me -y⁴. Evaluating this from 0 to 3: [(3)^4 - (0)^4] = 81 - 0 = 81. So the y-integral gives me 81.

Now, since the double integral is the product of these two results, I multiply -9 by 81. Let's compute that: -9 * 81. Hmm, 9*80 is 720, plus 9*1 is 9, so total is 729. Then with the negative sign, it's -729. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, 3^4 is 81, yeah, so 81. 4 squared is 16, and (-5)^2 is 25. 16-25 is indeed -9. Then 81 times -9 is -729. So the double integral's value is -729.

Looking at the options provided:

A: -1024

B: 650

C: 0

D: 504

E: -756

F: -504

G: -650

H: 1024

I: 756

So none of these options match -729. Wait, did I make a mistake? Let me check my steps again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the integration limits. Oh wait, the rectangle is from x = -5 to 4, but when I did the integral, I used 4^2 - (-5)^2. Let me recalculate that. 4 squared is 16, (-5) squared is 25. So 16 - 25 is -9. That seems right.

Hmm, perhaps I need to check the integrand again. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in separating the integrals. Wait, no, because 2x is only a function of x, and -4y³ is only a function of y. So splitting them is correct. So the integrals should be correct as -9 and 81, so multiplying gives -729.

Wait, but none of the options is -729. Did I perhaps make a mistake in the calculations? Let me recheck.

Wait, 4 squared is 16, (-5)^2 is 25. 16 - 25 = -9. That seems correct.

For the y-integral: integral of -4y³ dy is -4*(y⁴/4) evaluated from 0 to 3. That simplifies to -y⁴ evaluated from 0 to 3. So at y=3, it's -(81), and at y=0, it's 0. So the integral is -81. Wait, wait a minute. I thought earlier it was 81, but no, because the integral is -y⁴, so at 3 it's -81, and at 0 it's 0. So the integral is (-81) - 0 = -81.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake earlier. So the y integral is -81, not 81. So the x integral was -9, y integral is -81. So the double integral is (-9) * (-81) = 729. So the value is 729.

But looking at the options, I don't see 729. Hmm, so I must have made an error in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I swapped something. Let me think again. The integrand is 2x - 4y³. So when I separate, it's integral of 2x dx minus integral of 4y³ dy.

Wait, no, wait: the integrand is 2x - 4y³. So when splitting, it's (integral of 2x dx) minus (integral of 4y³ dy). So that's correct. So the x integral is (4^2 - (-5)^2) which is 16 - 25 = -9. The y integral is integral from 0 to 3 of -4y³ dy.

Wait, let me compute that again. The integral of -4y³ dy is -4*(y⁴/4) evaluated from 0 to 3. So that's - [ (3^4)/4 - (0^4)/4 ] = - [81/4 - 0] = -81/4.

Wait, wait a minute! I think I made a mistake here. The integral of y³ is y⁴/4. So integral of -4y³ is -4*(y⁴/4) which simplifies to -y⁴. Then evaluated from 0 to 3: - (3^4 - 0^4) = -81. That's correct, as I had earlier.

Wait, but then the x integral was -9, so -9 * (-81) is 729. But the options don't have 729. So perhaps I made a mistake in the integration limits.

Wait, did I evaluate the x integral correctly? Let's see: The x-integral is from x = -5 to x = 4. So the integral of 2x is x² evaluated from -5 to 4: (4)^2 - (-5)^2 = 16 - 25 = -9. That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I need to consider the bounds correctly. Let me think: when integrating with respect to x, the upper limit is 4, lower limit is -5. So yes, x² at 4 is 16, at -5 is 25. 16 -25 is -9.

Wait, but why is there no option for 729? Maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, let me re-read the problem: the integrand is 2x -4y³. So splitting it into 2x and -4y³ is correct. So the integral over x is the integral of 2x dx from -5 to 4, which is -9. The integral of -4y³ dy from 0 to3 is -81. So the product is (-9)*(-81) = 729. But looking at the options, I don't see 729. The closest is I:756 and E: -756, which are close but not 729. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, maybe the integrand was 2x minus 4y³, but perhaps I should have considered the absolute values or made a sign error. Let me compute the x integral again: 2x, integral from -5 to4. So x squared evaluated at 4 is 16, at -5 is 25. 16 -25 = -9. Correct.

The y integral: integral of -4y³ dy from 0 to 3. So integral is -y⁴ evaluated from 0 to3: - (81 -0) = -81. So the y integral is -81.

So the product is (-9)*(-81) = 729. But that's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement? Or maybe the integrand was different.

Wait, perhaps I confused the integrand. Let me double-check the problem. It's 2x -4y³, correct. So that's right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the integration limits. Let me check the x limits again: from -5 to 4. So 4 is larger than -5, so the integral is [x²] from -5 to4: 16 -25 = -9. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it again: 4 squared is 16, (-5)^2 is 25. 16 -25 is -9. So that's correct.

Wait, but the options don't have 729. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as absolute values, but that doesn't make sense for a double integral.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the integrals in the reverse order. Let me try integrating with respect to y first, then x.

Wait, no, the integrand is 2x -4y³, so when splitting, it's better to integrate with respect to one variable first, but I think the process is correct.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is written as 2x -4y^3, so in the integrand, 2x is being subtracted by 4y cubed. So when I split, it's correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the integral of -4y³. Let me compute that again. The integral of -4y³ dy is -4*(y⁴/4) + C = -y⁴ + C. Evaluated from 0 to3: (-3^4) - (-0^4) = -81 -0 = -81.

So that part is correct.

Wait, so the product is (-9)*(-81) = 729. But that's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the limits of integration. Let me check the rectangle again. R is [-5,4] × [0,3]. So x ranges from -5 to4, y from 0 to3. So the integrals are correctly set up.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when evaluating the integrals. Let me check again.

Wait, the x integral is 2x. So integral is x² from -5 to4: 16 -25 = -9. Correct.

The y integral is -4y³. Integral is -y⁴ from 0 to3: -81. So that's correct.

So the double integral is (-9)*(-81)=729. But this value is not present in the options. So perhaps I missed something.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A: -1024

B: 650

C: 0

D: 504

E: -756

F: -504

G: -650

H: 1024

I: 756

Wait, 756 is option I. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the x integral.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the integral of 2x from x=-5 to4. So the integral is x² evaluated from -5 to4: (16) - (25) = -9. That's correct.

But wait, maybe the integrand was 2x -4y^3, but perhaps I should have integrated in the opposite order, or perhaps the limits were wrong.

Wait, no, the rectangle is [-5,4] × [0,3], so the limits are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the integral as the absolute value of the integrals, but that's not how double integrals work; you don't take absolute values, you just compute the integral as the product.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral of 2x. Let me recall: the integral of 2x dx is x² + C. Evaluated from -5 to4, so 16 -25 = -9. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the integrand was 2x -4y³, which is the same as 2x minus 4y³. So when I split into x and y integrals, that's correct.

Hmm, but the options don't have 729. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, maybe the integral of -4y³ is different. Let's recompute it: integral of -4y³ dy is -4*(y⁴/4) = -y⁴. Evaluated from 0 to3: -(3^4) - (-0^4) = -81 -0 = -81. Correct.

Hmm, so the product is (-9)*(-81)=729. But this is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem was written as 2x minus 4y^3, but maybe I should have considered the negative sign differently. Or perhaps the integrand is 2x -4y^3, but in the problem statement, maybe it's 2x minus 4y cubed, which is different from 2x minus (4y)^3.

Wait, no, the problem says 2x -4y^3. So perhaps I made a mistake in the integral of 2x. Wait, no, the integral of 2x is x², which is correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute the integral as the product of the x integral and y integral. So (-9)*(-81)=729. But this is not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement or in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the integrand differently. Wait, let me check if I can factor anything out. The integrand is 2x -4y³. Hmm, perhaps I can factor out a 2: 2(x - 2y³). But I don't think that helps in this case.

Wait, maybe I should compute it numerically. Let me compute the x integral again: integral of 2x dx from -5 to4 is x² evaluated from -5 to4: 16 -25 = -9. Correct.

The y integral: integral of -4y³ dy from 0 to3 is -y⁴ evaluated from 0 to3: -81 -0 = -81. Correct.

So the product is (-9)*(-81)=729. But again, this isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is 729, but it's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, looking back, the integrand is 2x -4y³. Let me recompute the integrals once more.

For the x integral: integral of 2x dx from x = -5 to4. The integral is x² evaluated at 4 and -5. So 4² =16, (-5)^2=25. 16-25 = -9. Correct.

For the y integral: integral of -4y³ dy from 0 to3. The integral is -y⁴ evaluated from 0 to3: -(3^4) - (0^4)= -81 -0= -81. Correct.

So the product is (-9)*(-81)=729. But again, no option matches. So perhaps the correct answer is E: -756, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral's evaluation.

Wait, maybe the x integral is positive? Wait, no. The integral is -9.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the integrals separately and then multiply, but perhaps I should compute them as absolute values. But no, that's not how double integrals work.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign somewhere. Let me double-check the integrand. The problem says 2x -4y³, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the integrals as (2x -4y^3) integrated over x from -5 to4 and y from0 to3. So perhaps I should compute the integral as x going from -5 to4, and y from0 to3, but perhaps I should compute the inner integral with respect to x first, or the outer.

Let me try integrating with respect to x first, then y. So for each y, integrate 2x -4y³ over x from -5 to4.

So the integral over x is:

∫ (from x=-5 to4) [2x -4y³] dx.

The integral with respect to x is:

∫2x dx = x² + C.

∫-4y³ dx = -4y³ x + C.

So evaluating from x=-5 to4:

[ (4)^2 - (-5)^2 ] - [ (-4y³ *4 - (-4y³ * -5) ) ]

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me compute each part step by step.

First, the integral of 2x with respect to x from -5 to4 is [x²] from -5 to4 = 16 -25 = -9. So that's correct.

Now, the integral of -4y³ with respect to x from -5 to4 is -4y³*(x evaluated from -5 to4). So x evaluated is 4 - (-5) =9. So -4y³ *9 = -36y³.

So the inner integral over x is (-9) + (-36y³) = -9 -36y³.

Wait, no, that's incorrect. Because when integrating over x, the term -4y³ is independent of x, so integrating with respect to x, it's -4y³ * (4 - (-5)) = -4y³ *9 = -36y³. So the inner integral is (-9) + (-36y³) = -9 -36y³.

Wait, but that's integrating with respect to x, so the result is a function of y. So now, we integrate this result over y from 0 to3.

So ∫ from0 to3 of (-9 -36y³) dy.

Integrate term by term:

∫-9 dy = -9y.

∫-36y³ dy = -36*(y^4)/4 = -9y^4.

Evaluating from0 to3:

For the first term: -9*(3) - (-9*0) = -27.

For the second term: -9*(3^4) - (-9*0) = -9*(81) = -729.

Wait, so the total integral is (-27) + (-729) = -756.

Wait, that's an important point. I think I made a mistake earlier when I separated the integrals. Instead of integrating over x first, then y, I should integrate over x first, then y.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem. The problem is to compute the double integral over R of [2x -4y³] dA, where R is [-5,4] × [0,3]. So integrating with respect to x and y.

So first, integrating with respect to x, treating y as a constant. So the integrand is 2x -4y³. So integrating with respect to x:

∫(2x -4y³) dx = ∫2x dx - ∫4y³ dx.

The first integral is x², evaluated from -5 to4: 16 -25 = -9.

The second integral is 4y³, multiplied by x, evaluated from -5 to4. So x*(4y³) evaluated at4 and -5: (4*4y³) - (-5*4y³) = 16y³ - (-20y³) = 16y³ +20y³=36y³.

Wait, but wait, the integral is ∫4y³ dx =4y³ *x. Evaluated from x=-5 to4: 4y³*(4) -4y³*(-5) =16y³ +20y³=36y³.

So the inner integral over x is (-9) -36y³.

Now, integrate this result over y from0 to3:

∫(-9 -36y³) dy.

Integrate term by term:

∫-9 dy = -9y.

∫-36y³ dy = -36*(y^4)/4 = -9y^4.

So evaluating from0 to3:

For the first term: -9*(3) - (-9*0) = -27.

For the second term: -9*(3)^4 - (-9*0) = -9*81 = -729.

So the total integral is (-27) + (-729) = -756.

Which matches option E: -756.

So I must have made a mistake in the earlier step of separating the integrals. Instead of integrating first over x, then over y, I should have integrated over x, keeping y as a constant, and then integrate over y.

Ah, that's where I went wrong earlier. So the correct result is -756, which is option E.

To compute the double integral of \(2x - 4y^3\) over the rectangle \(R = [-5, 4] \times [0, 3]\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Integrate with respect to \(x\):**
   The integrand is \(2x - 4y^3\). For each fixed \(y\), integrate with respect to \(x\) from \(-5\) to \(4\):
   \[
   \int_{-5}^{4} (2x - 4y^3) \, dx = \int_{-5}^{4} 2x \, dx - \int_{-5}^{4} 4y^3 \, dx
   \]
   - The first integral is:
     \[
     \int_{-5}^{4} 2x \, dx = x^2 \Big|_{-5}^{4} = 16 - 25 = -9
     \]
   - The second integral is:
     \[
     \int_{-5}^{4} 4y^3 \, dx = 4y^3 \cdot x \Big|_{-5}^{4} = 4y^3 \cdot (4 - (-5)) = 4y^3 \cdot 9 = 36y^3
     \]
   - Combining both results:
     \[
     \int_{-5}^{4} (2x - 4y^3) \, dx = -9 - 36y^3
     \]

2. **Integrate with respect to \(y\):**
   Now, integrate the result with respect to \(y\) from \(0\) to \(3\):
   \[
   \int_{0}^{3} (-9 - 36y^3) \, dy = \int_{0}^{3} -9 \, dy + \int_{0}^{3} -36y^3 \, dy
   \]
   - The first integral is:
     \[
     \int_{0}^{3} -9 \, dy = -9y \Big|_{0}^{3} = -27 - 0 = -27
     \]
   - The second integral is:
     \[
     \int_{0}^{3} -36y^3 \, dy = -36 \cdot \frac{y^4}{4} \Big|_{0}^{3} = -9y^4 \Big|_{0}^{3} = -9(81) - 0 = -729
     \]
   - Combining both results:
     \[
     \int_{0}^{3} (-9 - 36y^3) \, dy = -27 - 729 = -756
     \]

Thus, the value of the double integral is \(-756\), which corresponds to option **E**.

ANSWER: E
