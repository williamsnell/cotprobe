Okay, so I've got this problem here about the weekly milk order at the Tranquility Inn. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says the weekly order includes 40 gallons of low-fat milk and 15 gallons of chocolate milk. And they want the ratio of low-fat to chocolate gallons. Hmm, I need to find that ratio. Ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think it's just about comparing the quantities.

First, let me write down the numbers. Low-fat milk is 40 gallons, and chocolate is 15. So the ratio is 40:15, right? Or sometimes ratios are shown in their simplest form. So I should probably reduce this fraction.

To simplify 40:15, I can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor. What's the GCD of 40 and 15? Let me think. The factors of 40 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40. The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, 15. The highest common factor is 5. So I'll divide both by 5.

40 divided by 5 is 8, and 15 divided by 5 is 3. So the simplified ratio is 8:3. Let me check the options provided.

Looking at the options, option F is 8:03. Wait, no, 8:03 is actually 8 to 03, which is 8:3. So option F is 8:03, which matches 8:3. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh wait, no. Option F is 8:03, but 03 is just 3. So 8:3 is the same as 8:03? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the numbers are separate. Oh, wait, the options are in the format like 5:03, so the second number is two digits. So 8:3 would be written as 8:03? No, because 3 is a single digit. So 8:03 is written with a leading zero to make it two digits, but 8:3 is just 8:3, which is the same as 8:03 when written with a leading zero, but perhaps the format is just 8:3, which is the same as 8:03? Wait, no, 8:03 is not the same as 8:3. Because 8:3 is 8 to 3, which is 8:3, while 8:03 is 8 to 3, which is the same. Wait, no, that's not right because 03 is 3, so 8:03 is 8:3. So option F is 8:03, which is the same as 8:3. So the correct ratio is 8:3, which is option F.

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. The ratio of low-fat to chocolate is 40:15, which simplifies to 8:3. So that's correct. So the answer should be F:8:03.
