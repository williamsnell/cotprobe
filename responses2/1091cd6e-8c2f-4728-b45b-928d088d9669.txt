Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about density. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it. 

The question says a chemist dropped a 200 g object into a tank of water and it displaced 60 ml. Then in another experiment, same object was dropped into oil and displaced 50 g. We need to find the density of the object and the oil. The answer choices are A to J, each giving different densities.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. Oh, but wait, the units here are a bit confusing. Let me look again.

The object's mass is 200 grams. When it's dropped into water, it displaces 60 ml. Oh, wait, because the volume displaced would be equal to the volume of the object. Because when you put it in water, it displaces a volume equal to its own volume, right? So the volume of the object is 60 ml. That's 60 cm³, since 1 ml equals 1 cm³.

So the density of the object would be mass over volume. So 200 grams divided by 60 ml. Let me calculate that. 200 divided by 60 is... 3.333... which is approximately 3.33 g/cm³, or 3.33 g/ml since 1 cm³ is 1 ml. So the object's density is about 3.33 g/ml.

Now for the oil. In the oil experiment, the object displaced 50 grams. Wait, wait a minute. That doesn't sound right. Because the displacement volume is equal to the mass displaced, but wait, no, that's not correct. Oh wait, no, wait. The displacement volume is equal to the mass of the displaced fluid, right? Because when you drop an object into a fluid, the displaced volume is equal to the volume of the object. So the mass of the displaced oil would be equal to the mass of the object? But the problem says the oil displaced 50 grams. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no—actually, when the object is placed in the oil, the oil's volume increases by the volume of the object. So the mass of the oil displaced would be equal to the mass of the object. But wait, the object's mass is 200 grams. So the oil would displace 200 grams, right? But the question says the oil displaced 50 grams. That can't be right. That would mean the oil has a lower density, so it floats, but the mass displaced is less. Wait, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait no, wait. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let's clarify. The mass of the displaced fluid is equal to the mass of the object when it's placed into the fluid. So if the object is 200 grams, the oil displaced is 200 grams. But the problem says in the oil case, it displaced 50 grams. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the question is mixing up the mass of the displaced fluid and the mass of the object. Let me read the problem again.

"In a similar experiment, it displaced only 50 g of an oil into which it was dropped." Oh wait, wait a minute. So the object's mass is 200 grams, and when placed in the oil, it displaces 50 grams of oil. So that would mean the oil's density is greater than the object's density because the oil has higher density, so the object floats, and the mass it displaces is 50 grams. Because when you put an object into a fluid, the fluid's mass displaced is equal to the object's mass. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the object's mass is 200 grams, but the displaced oil is only 50 grams. So that would imply that the object's density is higher than the oil, so it floats. But then, if the oil's mass displaced is 50 grams, which is less than the object's mass, that can't be right. Because the object's mass is 200 grams, so the object's density is higher than the oil. So, if the object's density is 3.33 g/cm³, then the oil would have a lower density than that.

Wait, but the oil's density would be such that the mass displaced is 50 grams. Since the object's mass is 200 grams, the displaced oil's mass (50 grams) would be less than the object's mass. So the oil has a lower density than the object. So that makes sense.

Wait, but how is that possible? Because if the object's density is 3.33 g/ml, and the oil is less dense, so the oil's density is lower. So the oil's density would be something like 1 g/ml or so.

But wait, let's calculate the oil's density. If the object's mass is 200 grams, and when placed in the oil, it displaces 50 grams of oil. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the mass of the displaced oil is equal to the mass of the object. Because the object's weight is supporting the weight of the displaced fluid. So the mass of the displaced oil would be 200 grams. But the problem says the oil displaced 50 grams. Oh wait, that must be a mistake in my understanding. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is presented differently. Let me read again.

"In a similar experiment, it displaced only 50 g of an oil into which it was dropped."

So the object's mass is 200 grams, and when dropped into the oil, it displaces 50 grams of oil. But that would imply that the oil's mass is 50 grams, but the object's mass is 200 grams. So the oil has a mass of 50 grams, and the displaced oil is 50 grams. But then, the object's mass is 200 grams, so the object's density is 200 / (50 mL) = 4 g/ml. But wait, that can't be right because the object's density is 3.33 from the water part. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the mass of the displaced fluid wrong. Oh, wait! The mass of the displaced fluid is equal to the mass of the object? Because the object is fully submerged, so yes. So the mass of the oil displaced is 200 grams. So the oil must have a density of 200 grams per... what volume?

Wait, no. The oil's density is its mass per volume. The problem says the oil displaced 50 grams. Oh, wait, no, the problem says the object displaced 50 g of oil. No, wait, the wording is confusing. Let me read again: "It displaced only 50 g of an oil into which it was dropped."

Ah, so when the object is dropped into the oil, the oil's volume increases by 50 grams of oil. Wait, no. The oil's mass displaced is 50 grams. Because the object's mass is 200 grams. So the oil's mass displaced is 50 grams. But how does that relate to the oil's density?

Wait, no. Wait, sorry, the problem states that the object displaces 50 grams of oil. So the oil must have a mass of 50 grams, but the object's mass is 200 grams. So the oil's mass is 50 grams, and the object is 200 grams. So the oil's density is mass/volume. The volume displaced would be the object's own volume, 60 ml.

Wait, so the oil's density would be 50 grams / 60 ml = 5/6 g/ml = approximately 0.833 g/ml. But wait, that would be about 0.83 g/ml, which is 0.83 g/cm³.

Wait, but let me think again. Because if the oil's density is higher than the object's, then the object would float, displacing a volume equal to its own mass divided by density. Wait, no, the object's mass is 200 grams. So the oil's density needs to be higher than the object's to float. Because if the oil's density is higher, the object floats and displaces a volume equal to (mass)/(density of oil). So the volume displaced would be 200 / (density of oil).

But wait, the problem says that when the object is dropped into oil, it displaces 50 grams of oil. So perhaps the oil's mass is 50 grams? Or is the object's displacement 50 grams of oil. But that doesn't make sense. Because the object's mass is 200 grams, so the displaced oil must have a mass of 200 grams. But the problem says 50 grams.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is that the object displaces 50 grams of oil, which would mean that the oil's mass is 50 grams. But the object's mass is 200 grams. So the oil's density is 50 g / 60 ml = 0.8333 g/ml.

But that would make the oil's density lower than the object's, which makes sense because the object would float. So the oil is less dense than the object.

So putting it all together, the object's density is 200 grams / 60 mL = 3.333 g/mL. The oil's density is 50 grams / 60 mL = 0.833 g/mL. So which option matches this?

Looking at the options:

A: 3.33, 0.83 → yes, that's 3.33 and 0.833.

Wait, but let me check another way. The object's density is 200 / 60 = 3.333... which is 3.33, and the oil's density is 50 / 60 ≈0.8333.

So the correct answer would be option A: Object density 3.33, oil 0.83.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is object 4, oil 0.9. Hmm, but according to this, the object's density is 3.33.

Option F: object density 4, oil 0.75. No, that's higher.

Option G: object 2.5, oil 0.9 → no, that's lower.

Option C: object 3.33, oil 1 → higher oil density.

Option D: object 2.5, oil 0.75 → no.

Option E: object 2.5, oil 1 → no.

Option H: object 4, oil 0.83 → higher object, lower oil.

So option A is 3.33 and 0.83, which matches our calculations.

Wait, but wait a second—the oil's mass would be 50 grams, but the problem says the object displaced 50 g of oil. So wait, wait, maybe I've got that backward. Or perhaps displacement is mass, not volume.

Wait, no, I think the displacement is based on volume. Because when you drop an object into a fluid, the volume displaced is equal to the volume of the object. So the mass of the displaced fluid (oil) would be equal to the object's mass if it's fully submerged. So if the object's mass is 200 grams, it would displace 200 grams of oil. But the problem says it displaced 50 grams. So that's conflicting.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me re-examine the problem.

The problem says in the first experiment: 200 g object, 60 mL water. So displacement is 60 mL, which is 60 cm³. So the object's volume is 60 cm³, which makes its density 200g /60 cm³ = 3.333 g/cm³ or 3.33 g/mL. That part seems clear.

In the second experiment, the object is dropped into oil, displaces 50 g. So the mass of the oil displaced is 50 grams. But wait, the object's mass is 200 grams, so why is the oil displaced less? That can't be right, because if the object is denser than the oil, it would sink and the oil would displace 200 grams. But since the problem says the oil displaced 50 grams, that must be a mistake in understanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that the oil had a volume of 50 grams, which would have a density of 0.8333. But that would not make sense because the object's density is 3.33, so the oil is less dense. So the object would float, displacing a volume of (mass)/(density of oil) = 200 / 0.8333 ≈ 240 mL. So the oil's volume displaced would be 240 mL.

But in the problem statement, the oil displaced 50 grams, which I think is a mistake. Let me go back to the problem statement.

The problem states: "It displaced only 50 g of an oil into which it was dropped." So the mass of the oil displaced is 50 grams. But wait, the object's mass is 200 grams. So if the oil's density is higher than the object's, the object would float, displacing less oil. Wait, no, wait: if the oil's density is higher, the object would float, and the displaced volume would be equal to the object's mass divided by the density of the oil.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using mass and volume interchangeably. Because the oil's mass displaced is 50 grams, but the volume displaced would be 50 grams / density of oil.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Let me try to model the problem.

Let the object's density be ρ_object = 200 g / 60 cm³ = 3.333 g/cm³ = 3.33 g/mL.

The oil's density is ρ_oil = ?

When the object is dropped into the oil, it displaces 50 grams of oil. But the oil's mass is... wait, if the object displaces 50 grams of oil, what's the volume? Volume is 50 grams / density of oil. But the object's own volume is 60 cm³. So if the object is fully submerged, the displaced volume should be equal to the object's own volume. So the oil's density must be higher than the object's, so the displaced volume is 60 cm³.

Wait! So the oil's density is such that when you place the 200 g object into it, the oil's volume increases by 60 cm³. So the oil's density is higher than the object's. So the oil must displace 60 cm³, which is 60 grams if the oil were water (density 1 g/cm³). But the problem says the oil displaced 50 grams. Hmm, I'm getting more confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using "displaced 50 g" as the mass of the displaced oil, but the object's displacement is in terms of volume. Let's think again.

Wait, displacement volume is equal to the object's own volume. So if the object's volume is 60 cm³, then the oil's volume displaced is 60 cm³. But the problem says the oil displaced 50 grams. Wait, but that would imply that the oil's volume is 50 grams / density of oil. 

Wait, but if the object's own volume is 60 cm³, and the oil's volume displaced is 60 cm³, then the oil's density would be mass of oil displaced / volume displaced. But what's the mass of the oil displaced? Is it 50 grams or 60 grams?

The problem says the object displaced 50 grams of oil. So assuming it's mass displaced, then the oil's density would be 50 g / 60 cm³ = 0.833 g/cm³. But that would imply that the oil is less dense than the object, so it floats, which would mean the object displaces a volume of (200 g) / (density of oil) = (200)/(0.833) ≈ 240 cm³, which is 240 mL. But the problem says it displaced 50 grams of oil, which is 50 mL (since density is 1 g/mL, but oil's density is 0.833, so 50 g would be 50 / 0.833 ≈60 mL). Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up between mass and volume displaced. Let me try to clarify.

The key point is that when an object is placed in a fluid, the displaced fluid's volume is equal to the object's volume (if submerged), regardless of the fluid's density. The displaced volume is the volume of the object.

But the mass of the displaced fluid depends on the fluid's density. Because:

mass displaced = density of fluid * volume displaced.

But the object's mass is 200 g, so if the object is placed into a fluid:

mass of object = density of fluid * volume displaced.

So, for the water case: 200g = 1g/cm³ * 60 cm³ → 200=60 → which is not true. Wait no, wait.

Wait, no, the object's mass is 200g, and the water displaces 60 cm³. So the mass of the water is 60 grams, but the object's mass is 200 grams. So the object's density is 200/60 = 3.33 g/cm³.

In the oil case, the object displaces 50 grams of oil. So 50 grams = density of oil * volume displaced. But the volume displaced is the same as the object's volume, which is 60 cm³. Wait, no, that can't be right because the object's volume is 60 cm³, so the displaced volume is 60 cm³. So 50 grams = density * 60 cm³ → density = 50/60 ≈0.833 g/cm³. 

But wait, the object's density is higher (3.33 g/cm³) than the oil's (0.833 g/cm³), so the oil would float. But in that case, the object displaces a volume of (200)/(0.833) = 240 cm³. But according to the problem, the object displaced 50 grams of oil, which is 50 cm³ (if oil's density is 1 g/cm³). 

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me think about the two cases.

Case 1 (water): Object's mass is 200g, volume displaced is 60 mL. So object's density is 200/60 =3.33 g/mL.

Case 2 (oil): Object's mass is 200g, volume displaced is 60 mL. But the problem says the oil displaced 50 grams. So the oil's mass is 50g. So the oil's density is 50g /60 mL = 0.833 g/mL.

So the object's density is 3.33, oil's is 0.833. Looking at the options, option A says object 3.33, oil 0.83. So option A is correct.

But wait, the initial problem states that in the oil case, the object displaced 50g of oil. So that would mean the oil's mass is 50g, and since the object's density is higher, it would float, displacing 50g / (density of oil) volume. 

But in the problem statement, the oil displaced 50g of oil. So the mass of the oil displaced is 50g. So the oil must have a density of 50g /60 mL =0.833 g/mL.

So the object's density is 3.33, oil's is 0.833, which is option A.
</think>

To determine the densities of the object and the oil, we analyze the two scenarios provided:

1. **Water Displacement**:  
   The object has a mass of 200 g and displaces 60 mL of water. Since the density of water is 1 g/mL, the object's volume is 60 mL, confirming the given data. The object's density is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Density of object} = \frac{\text{Mass of object}}{\text{Volume of object}} = \frac{200 \, \text{g}}{60 \, \text{mL}} = 3.33 \, \text{g/mL}.
   \]

2. **Oil Displacement**:  
   The object displaces 50 g of oil. The oil's density can be calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{Density of oil} = \frac{\text{Mass of oil displaced}}{\text{Volume of oil displaced}} = \frac{50 \, \text{g}}{60 \, \text{mL}} = 0.83 \, \text{g/mL}.
   \]

Thus, the object's density is 3.33 g/mL, and the oil's density is 0.83 g/mL. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct choice is:

**ANSWER: A**
