Question:

The Federal Reserve's most important control instrument is open-market operations. How is it that selling government bonds can reduce bank reserves?

Options:

A: The bank will lose an equivalent amount of reserve balances with the Federal Reserve
B: The bank's reserve balances will become negative as a result of the bond sale
C: The bank's reserve balances increase due to interest payments on bonds
D: The bank will lose reserve balances only if the bonds are sold to the public, not to the Federal Reserve
E: The bank's reserve requirement ratio will decrease
F: The bank will gain more reserve balances
G: The bank's reserve balances will decrease by half the amount of the bonds sold
H: The bank's reserve balances will double
I: The bank's lending capacity will increase without any change in reserve balances
J: The bank's reserve balances remain unchanged

Okay, so I've got this question about the Federal Reserve and open-market operations. Hmm, I remember that open-market operations involve the Fed buying or selling government bonds to influence the money supply. The question is about why selling government bonds would reduce bank reserves. 

Wait, when the Fed sells bonds, does that directly reduce the bank's reserves? I think when the Fed sells bonds, they're taking out money from the banks. So, the banks must have that money to sell the bonds. So the banks have to keep some reserves. Oh right, because when a bank sells a bond, they have to keep a certain percentage as reserves. So if they sell more bonds, the banks lose that reserve balance.

So the options are A to J. Let me look at each option.

Option A says the bank will lose an equivalent amount of reserve balances with the Fed. That makes sense because the Fed selling bonds requires the bank to keep a portion as reserves. So selling a bond would reduce the reserve balances by the amount of the bond. 

Option B: Reserve balances become negative. I don't think that's right. Because if the bank sells bonds, they have to reduce reserves. But if you sell a lot of bonds, the bank's reserves can't go below zero, but in the question, it's about how selling affects the reserves, not their positivity.

Option C: Reserve increases with interest payments. No, because selling bonds is about reducing the reserves, not increasing them. The interest on the bonds is probably used elsewhere, maybe to pay out interest to the buyers or to the Fed's own monetary policy.

Option D: bank loses reserves if bonds are sold to the public. Wait, maybe if the bonds are sold to the public, like to individuals, they would need to keep more reserves. But the question says selling to the Fed. So it's about the Fed's bond sales, not the general public. So D probably isn't correct.

Option E: Reserve ratio decreases. No, the reserve requirement is determined by the Fed, but the reserve balances themselves aren't necessarily decreasing based on the Fed's actions. Wait, the reserve requirement is a percentage of deposits. But when the Fed sells bonds, the banks have less reserves. So the actual reserve balance is going down, but the Fed's reserve requirement is fixed. Hmm, so the reserve requirement ratio (like the percentage) might stay the same, but the actual reserves in the banking system would decrease. So E isn't the correct answer because the question is about how the reserve balances change, not the ratio.

Option F: Reserve increases. No, because selling bonds reduces the required reserves for the banks. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Reserve balances decrease by half? No, the question says the amount sold, so it's not half. It's the full amount. So G isn't correct.

Option H: Reserve balances double. Nope, that's not how it works. Reserve is reduced, not doubled.

Option I: Lending capacity increases without changing reserves. I'm not sure. If the bank's reserves decrease, they can lend more. So I think their lending capacity goes up. But the question is about how selling affects reserves, not about the effect on their ability to lend.

Option J: Reserve balances remain unchanged. No, because selling the bonds would mean they have less money to keep as reserves. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer is A: The bank will lose an equivalent amount of reserve balances with the Fed.

The correct answer is **A: The bank will lose an equivalent amount of reserve balances with the Federal Reserve**. When the Federal Reserve sells government bonds, it extracts money from banks, which reduces the banks' reserve balances. This reduction ensures banks have sufficient funds to perform their lending obligations. 

Answer: A
