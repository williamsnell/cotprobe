Okay, so I've got this problem here about seating guests at a wedding. There are 190 guests, and each table can seat exactly 8 people. I need to figure out the minimum number of tables required. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I think I should calculate how many full tables of 8 can be made from 190 guests. If I divide 190 by 8, that should give me the number of tables needed. Let me do the math: 190 ÷ 8 equals 23.75. Wait, so that's 23 tables with some guests left over. But wait, 23 tables times 8 is 184, which leaves 6 people unseated. Oh, because 23*8 = 184, and 190-184=6. So that's not enough, right? I need to account for those 6 guests.

Each of these 6 guests would require an additional table, but wait, can I seat them all at a single table? If each table can seat 8, then 6 is less than 8. So that means we can add one more table for the 6 guests. So 23 + 1 = 24 tables. But wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh, but maybe I can combine some tables to minimize the number. Because 6 guests can take a table or maybe some other arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The total number of guests is 190. Each table seats 8, so using n tables, the maximum number of guests is 8n. We need 8n ≥ 190. Let's solve for n: n ≥ 190/8 = 23.75. Since n has to be an integer, n must be 24. So 24 tables are needed. But wait, let me check if 24 tables can actually seat all 190. 24*8 is 192, which is more than 190. So that works. But wait, I thought earlier that 23 tables can only seat 184, so 23 tables can't. So 24 is the minimum.

Wait, looking back at the options, option G is 24. So the answer should be G. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think: How many complete tables of 8 can we have? 190 ÷ 8 is 23 with a remainder of 6. So 23 tables seat 184, and you have 6 left. So you need one more table for those 6, totaling 24. So yes, 24 tables are needed. So the correct answer is G, which is 24.

The least number of tables needed is 24.

Answer: G
