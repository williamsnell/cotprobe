Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for (vice) president in the new land my father came to love.… Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration, the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right that every year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller.… It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Geraldine Ferraro and which of the given women she's most directly compared to. Let's go through this step by step.

First, I know that Geraldine Ferraro was the Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Addresser for July 19, 1984. The address she gave was a powerful statement that encapsulates her vision for the country. The text she wrote was quite influential, especially during the 1980s. Now, the question is asking which of these options she's most directly compared to.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

A: Jane Addams. I remember that Jane Addams was a significant figure, but she was more known for her work in social services, especially for the poor and working-class communities. She was the wife of John Addams and was a strong advocate for women's rights, but her main focus was on social welfare and education. Her main theme in her acceptance addresses was about social justice and the future of society, but I'm not sure if she's the one who is directly compared to Ferraro.

B: Abigail Adams. Abigail Adams was the wife of John Adams, who was the first President of the United States. She was the first woman to hold office in the U.S. and played a key role in the founding of the United States, particularly in the development of the Constitution. Her work was more about the creation and foundation of the nation, not about the future of the country or the rules of society. Her "Vice presidential Nomination Acceptance Address" would have been about the founding of the country, but I don't think she's the one compared to Ferraro.

C: Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I know that Ginsburg was a prominent figure in the fight for women's rights, especially in the U.S. and her activism focused on the fight against性别 discrimination. She's known for her work on the Equal Rights Act and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Her "Vice presidential Nomination Acceptance Address" would have been about her advocacy for women's rights and equal opportunity. Her main theme was about women's rights and the fight for equality. However, Geraldine Ferraro's address focused more on the future of America, the rules of American life, and the idea of women's contributions to the nation. So, while both were women's rights advocates, Ferraro's focus is on a broader societal vision, whereas Ginsburg's was more on rights and equality. So I don't think C is the correct answer.

D: Harriet Tubman. Harriet was a historical figure who was the first African American woman to cross the Atlantic. Her main focus was on the Underground Railroad, not on the future of the country. Her "Vice presidential Nomination Acceptance Address" would have been about her historical contributions, not about the vision of the time. So, not D.

E: Rosa Parks. Rosa Parks was a key figure in the movement for racial equality, particularly for African Americans. She was the first to deliver the "Vice presidential Nomination Acceptance Address" and her theme was about the end of segregation and the fight for civil rights. Her work was about racial equality and the civil rights movement, which is a different context than Ferraro's address. Her focus was on the fight for civil rights, which isn't directly related to her vision as a vice presidential candidate.

F: Sandra Day O'Connor. Sandra was the wife of Martin Luther King Jr., and she was the first African American woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate. Her "Vice presidential Nomination Acceptance Address" was about her contributions to the civil rights movement and the fight against racial segregation. Again, her focus was on civil rights, not the vision of Ferraro.

G: Hillary Clinton. She's a contemporary U.S. Vice President and the current vice president of the United States. Her "Vice presidential Nomination Acceptance Address" was about her campaign's platform, which focused on policies like healthcare, social issues, etc. There's no direct comparison to Ferraro's themes, which were about the future of the country, societal rules, and women's contributions.

H: Eleanor Roosevelt. Eleanor was the first woman to serve as the President of the U.S. and the first woman to hold the position of First Lady. Her "Vice presidential Nomination Acceptance Address" was about her vision for the nation, the improvement of society, and the end of racial segregation. She focused on social justice, civil rights, and women's contributions. Her address was a powerful statement that reflected her philosophy of making the rules of American life work for her and her people. This aligns very closely with the theme of Ferraro's address, which was about making the rules work for all, especially focusing on women's contributions and the future of the nation.

I: Amelia Earhart. She was a celebrated aviator who made significant contributions to aviation, including the first successful long-distance flight. Her work was about technology and aviation, not about societal rules or women's contributions. Her "Vice presidential Nomination Acceptance Address" would have been more about her aviation achievements, so not relevant.

J: Amelia Earhart (same as I, but since the options have both, maybe it's a typo, but I think the question has J as a separate one. So probably, the correct answer is H: Eleanor Roosevelt.

So, putting it all together, Geraldine Ferraro's address was about the future of the nation, making the rules work for all, with a focus on women's contributions. Eleanor Roosevelt's address was also about the future of society, focusing on social justice and women's rights. Both were prominent women's rights advocates, but Ferraro's address was more about the societal vision and making the rules work for all. So, the correct answer is H: Eleanor Roosevelt.
