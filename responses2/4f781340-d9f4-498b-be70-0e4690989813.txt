Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric dipoles in a uniform electric field. Hmm. Let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question is asking how much work is required to turn an electric dipole 180 degrees in a uniform electric field. The dipole moment is given, the electric field is given, and the initial angle is 64 degrees. Oh right, I remember that the work done when rotating a dipole in an electric field is the change in potential energy.

Wait, what's the formula again? Oh, right, the potential energy U of a dipole in an electric field is U = -p·E, which simplifies to U = -pE cosθ, where θ is the angle between the dipole moment and the electric field. Oh, wait no, wait another thing. The dipole moment is a vector, so the angle between the dipole and the field affects the potential energy.

So, for the work done when rotating from an initial angle θ_initial to θ_final, the work W is the change in potential energy. So W = U_final - U_initial.

But wait, wait. Because potential energy is a function of the angle. So if the dipole is rotated from θ_initial to θ_final, the work done would be the difference between the initial and final potential energies.

Let me write that down. The initial angle is 64 degrees, and the final is 64 + 180 = 244 degrees? Wait no, wait. Because 180 degrees is a straight flip. So what's the overall change? Or wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait, wait a minute. Wait, no, if you turn the dipole 180 degrees, the angle with the field would change by 180 degrees. But how does that affect the potential energy?

Alternatively, sometimes the work done is calculated as the difference in potential energy. So let's think about the change.

The initial angle is θ_i = 64°, and the final angle is θ_f = θ_i + 180° = 244°. Or wait, 64° plus 180° is 244°, but that's the same as 244-360= -116°, but that's probably more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the potential energy in terms of the angle, regardless of the direction.

Wait, the potential energy U is U = -pE cosθ, where θ is the angle between the dipole and the electric field. So when θ increases beyond 90 degrees, the cos(theta) decreases, so U becomes less negative, or more positive depending on the sign.

So if the dipole is turned 180 degrees, the initial angle is θ_initial = 64°, and final angle is θ_final = 64 + 180 = 244°. Wait, but 244° is equivalent to 244 - 360 = -116°, which is the same as 180 - 116 = 64°, but maybe that's not the right way to look at it.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the work done as the change in the potential energy when the dipole is rotated from θ_i to θ_f.

So, the work done W is U_f - U_i.

Wait, but what determines the work done in such a situation. Another approach: the work done in rotating the dipole from θ_i to θ_f is the integral of the torque with respect to the angle over that rotation.

Because torque τ is pE sinθ, since torque is the cross product of dipole moment and electric field, so τ = pE sinθ. The work done is the integral of τ dθ from θ_i to θ_f.

So W = ∫ (from θ_i to θ_f) τ dθ = ∫ (from θ_i to θ_f) pE sinθ dθ.

But wait, wait, no, because in this case, the torque is pE sinθ, but the work done is the integral of torque multiplied by dθ. So integral of pE sinθ dθ.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, when torque is applied, the work done is the integral of torque multiplied by the infinitesimal rotation dθ. So W = ∫ τ dθ. But torque τ here is not just pE, it's pE sinθ. So τ = pE sinθ.

So W = ∫ (from θ_i to θ_f) (pE sinθ) dθ.

Wait, but in our case, the dipole is being turned 180 degrees, which is a full rotation. So the initial angle is 64°, and the final angle is 64 + 180 = 244°, but that's more than 180. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the angle relative to the field. Alternatively, perhaps the angle is taken as the angle with the field, so regardless of direction, it's the effective angle.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Suppose the dipole is turned by 180 degrees in the same direction as the field. Hmm, but in any case, the work done in rotating it from θ_i to θ_f is the integral of torque dθ. Let me compute that.

Wait, let me compute the integral. The torque τ is pE sinθ. So the work done is the integral from θ_i to θ_f of τ dθ.

Which is W = pE ∫ sinθ dθ from θ_i to θ_f.

The integral of sinθ dθ is -cosθ. So,

W = pE [ -cosθ_f + cosθ_i ] = pE (cosθ_i - cosθ_f )

Wait, that's a key point. So W is pE (cosθ_i - cosθ_f )

Wait, but wait, let me get the signs right. Since torque is pE sinθ and work is the integral of torque times dθ (assuming that the torque is the same direction as dθ, which may not always be the case, but in this scenario, since the dipole is being rotated in the same direction, the torque would be in the same direction as the rotation. So the integral would be correct.

Wait, but wait, when the dipole is rotated from θ_i to θ_f, if θ_f is larger than θ_i, then cosθ_f is smaller than cosθ_i. So the work done W is positive, which makes sense because it's the energy being added.

Wait, but in our problem, the dipole is turned 180 degrees, so θ_f = θ_i + 180? Or is it θ_f = θ_i + 180 degrees. Wait, but in terms of the angle with the electric field, 180 degrees would flip the dipole. So for example, if the initial angle is 64°, the final would be 64 + 180 = 244°, but since angles in physics are taken modulo 360, 244 is the same as -116°, which is 180 - 116 = 64°, but that's perhaps not important for the calculation.

So, let's proceed with the formula:

W = pE (cosθ_i - cosθ_f )

But wait, but wait, let me think again. Oh, wait, the torque is τ = pE sinθ, right, and the work done is the integral of torque times dθ. So,

W = pE ∫ (from θ_initial to θ_final) sinθ dθ

Which is pE [ -cosθ_initial + cosθ_final ].

So, W = pE (cosθ_final - cosθ_initial )

Wait, I think I made a sign error earlier. Let me recalculate.

The integral is from θ_i to θ_f of pE sinθ dθ. The antiderivative is -pE cosθ.

So when substituting, it's (-pE cosθ_f) - (-pE cosθ_i) ) → pE (cosθ_i - cosθ_f )

Wait, no. Let's compute it step by step.

Integral from a to b of sinθ dθ = [-cosθ]_a^b = -cosb + cosa = cos a - cos b.

So, since W = pE (cosθ_i - cosθ_f ), because the integral is pE [ (-cosθ_f ) - (-cosθ_i ) ] = pE ( cosθ_i - cosθ_f )

So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but because θ_i is 64°, θ_f is 64° + 180° = 244°, which is same as 244 - 360 = -116°, but I don't think that's important for the calculation.

So now, substituting the numbers.

p is given as 3.02e-25 C·m.

E is 46.0 N/C.

θ_i is 64 degrees, θ_f is 244 degrees (or 64 + 180 = 244).

Wait, but wait, because 244 is more than 180, but the cosine function is periodic. The cosine of 244 is the same as the cosine of 244 - 360 = -116, which is the same as cos(116), but wait, cos is even function, so cos(244) = cos(116), but wait, no. Because 244 is in the third quadrant (180 to 270), so cos is negative. Let me compute the values.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute cosθ_i and cosθ_f numerically.

So, θ_i is 64 degrees.

cos(64°) ≈ 0.4384.

θ_f is 244 degrees. Let's compute cos(244 degrees).

244 = 180 + 64. So cos(180+64) = -cos(64) = -0.4384.

Alternatively, let me compute it exactly.

Wait, 244 degrees is 180 + 64 degrees. So cos(244) = cos(180 +64) = -cos(64) = -0.4384.

So, cosθ_i = 0.4384, cosθ_f = -0.4384.

So,

cosθ_i - cosθ_f = 0.4384 - (-0.4384) = 0.8768.

Now, W = pE (0.8768 )

Wait, but wait, let's compute that.

pE is (3.02e-25 C·m) * (46.0 N/C) → let's compute that.

3.02e-25 *46 = ?

3 *46 is 138, 0.02e-25 *46 is 0.92e-25 → 138.92e-25 → 1.3892e-23.

So pE = 1.389e-23 J (since N/C * C·m = N·m = J).

Wait, no, pE is (3.02e-25 *46) → 3.02 *46 = 138.92 → 138.92e-25 → 1.3892e-23 J.

So,

W = (1.3892e-23 J) * 0.8768 ≈ let's compute that.

1.3892 * 0.8768 ≈ let's see: 1.3892 * 0.8 = 1.11136; 1.3892*0.0768≈0.1061 → total ≈ 1.2175 → so W ≈ 1.2175e-23 J.

Looking at the options:

Looking back at the options, option I is 1.22e-23 J. Which is about 1.22e-23.

But wait, the options don't have exactly 1.22e-23. Wait, let me check the options.

Wait, the options are:

A: 2.05e-23

B:7.32e-23

C:2.44e-23

D:5.50e-23

E:3.66e-23

F:1.83e-23

G:0.92e-23

H:0.61e-23

I:1.22e-23

J:4.88e-23

So, option I is 1.22e-23 J, which matches our calculation of about 1.2175e-23. So I think the answer is I.

Wait, but wait another thing: wait, the problem says the angle is turned 180 degrees, but the calculation uses the change in the cosθ. Let me ensure that I'm not making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: when you turn a dipole by 180 degrees, the change in potential energy is ΔU = U_final - U_initial.

The potential energy U is given by U = -pE cosθ.

So,

U_initial = -pE cosθ_i

U_final = -pE cosθ_f

ΔU = U_final - U_initial = -pE cosθ_f - (-pE cosθ_i) = pE (cosθ_i - cosθ_f )

Which is the same as I computed earlier.

So, our calculation is correct.

So, the work done is 1.22e-23 J, which is option I.

To determine the work required to turn an electric dipole 180° in a uniform electric field, we use the relationship between the work done and the change in potential energy of the dipole. The potential energy of a dipole in an electric field is given by:

\[
U = -pE \cos\theta
\]

where \( p \) is the dipole moment, \( E \) is the electric field strength, and \( \theta \) is the angle between the dipole moment and the electric field. The work done to rotate the dipole from an initial angle \( \theta_i \) to a final angle \( \theta_f \) is:

\[
W = \Delta U = U_{\text{final}} - U_{\text{initial}}
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( U_{\text{final}} \) and \( U_{\text{initial}} \):

\[
W = -pE \cos\theta_f - (-pE \cos\theta_i) = pE (\cos\theta_i - \cos\theta_f)
\]

### Given Data:
- Dipole moment: \( p = 3.02 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{C} \cdot \text{m} \)
- Electric field: \( E = 46.0 \, \text{N/C} \)
- Initial angle: \( \theta_i = 64^\circ \)
- Final angle: \( \theta_f = \theta_i + 180^\circ = 244^\circ \)

### Calculations:
1. Convert angles to radians for computation (not necessary here, as we use cosine directly):
   - \( \cos(64^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \)
   - \( \cos(244^\circ) = \cos(180^\circ + 64^\circ) = -\cos(64^\circ) = -0.4384 \)

2. Compute the difference in cosines:
   \[
   \cos\theta_i - \cos\theta_f = 0.4384 - (-0.4384) = 0.8768
   \]

3. Calculate \( pE \):
   \[
   pE = (3.02 \times 10^{-25}) \times 46.0 = 1.3892 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

4. Compute the work done:
   \[
   W = pE (\cos\theta_i - \cos\theta_f) = (1.3892 \times 10^{-23}) \times 0.8768 \approx 1.2175 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The work required to turn the dipole 180° is approximately \( 1.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to **option I**.
