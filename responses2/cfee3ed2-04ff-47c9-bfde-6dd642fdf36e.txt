Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reaction rates and order. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that when the concentration of reactant A is tripled, the reaction rate also triples. And the concentrations of all other reactants are kept constant. So, I remember that the rate law depends on the concentration of each reactant raised to some power, determined by their orders.

Wait, the general form of a rate law is rate = k [A]^m [B]^n, etc. In this case, since all other reactants except A are held constant, the rate change is only due to [A]. So, when [A] changes, the rate changes proportionally to [A]^m.

In the problem, when [A] is tripled (so from, say, 1 to 3), the rate also triples. Let's think about how that affects the rate equation. Let's assume that the rate before is k [A]_initial^m. After tripling [A], the rate becomes k (3 [A]_initial)^m = k 3^m [A]_initial^m.

The problem states that the rate increases by a factor of 3. So, the ratio of new rate to old rate is 3. So, (k 3^m [A]_initial^m) / (k [A]_initial^m) ) = 3.

The k and [A]_initial^m terms cancel out, so we're left with 3^m = 3. Since 3^1 is 3, that implies m is 1. So, the order of A is 1.

Looking at the options, J is 1. So the answer should be J.

The reaction rate is directly proportional to the concentration of reactant A raised to the power of its order, determined by the rate law. When the concentration of A is tripled, the rate also triples. This implies that the order of A in the rate law is 1, as the ratio of the new rate to the old rate is 3, leading to 3^m = 3, where m is the order. Solving this gives m = 1. Among the options, the correct exponent for A in the rate law is 1.

Answer: J
