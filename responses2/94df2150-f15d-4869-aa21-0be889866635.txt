Okay, so I need to figure out the right answer to this psychology question. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a psychologist designing a study to investigate how age affects intelligence. The result should show that test scores decline in early adulthood if she uses a certain research design. The options are A through J, each with a different research design.

Hmm, let's break it down. The key here is understanding what each research design entails and how it relates to the relationship between age and intelligence.

So, first, I should recall what each of these terms means. 

Case study: This involves a detailed analysis of a specific individual or group. It's pretty in-depth, looking at a single case over time. But I'm not sure how this would show a trend across ages.

Longitudinal: This sounds like it's tracking the same individuals over a period. That makes sense because it would allow looking for changes over time. If the psychologist uses longitudinal, she could measure intelligence at different ages and see if scores drop as they get older.

Observational: This usually involves observing subjects without influencing them. It's more about identifying patterns without intervention. I don't think this would naturally show a decline over time, unless it's specifically set up that way.

Experimental: This involves manipulating one variable to see the effect on another. Like, maybe increasing some factors and seeing if intelligence changes. But I don't think the question is about an experiment here.

Experimental control isn't relevant here because the question is about investigating the impact of age, not treatment effects.

Comparative: This is comparing different groups, like comparing people from different age groups. But that usually shows differences between groups, not a trend over time.

Survey: Collecting data from a sample. It's good for data collection but doesn't inherently show trends over time unless it's designed over a period.

Cross-sectional: Looking at data from different groups at the same time. Doesn't show trends over time.

Cross-sequential: This term isn't familiar to me as I know cross-sectional and longitudinal. Maybe it's a less common term, perhaps referring to both cross-sectional and longitudinal data together? Or perhaps it's a term I'm not sure about, so I might need to think about other options.

Correlational: Measures the association between variables. It shows that as age increases, scores may decrease, but it doesn't establish causation. It just shows association.

Wait, the question is about which design would indicate that intelligence test scores decline in early adulthood. So we're looking for a study that shows a decline in test scores as age increases, specifically in early adulthood.

So, longitudinal studies are exactly those that track the same individuals over time to look for changes. If the psychologist uses a longitudinal study, she could compare someone at age 18 with someone at age 30 and see if the latter has lower scores, assuming the decline is consistent with age.

Looking at the options, option B is longitudinal. That seems to fit.

Other options: Case study (A) would look at one individual over time, which might show a trend but probably not as clearly. Observational (C) would be more of a study without direct manipulation. Experimental (D) is about controlling variables, not directly about age. Cross-sectional (F) is snapshot data. Comparative (G) would compare different age groups but might not show a specific decline. Survey (J) is data collection, not showing trends. Cross-sectional and cross-sequential (I and E) aren't clear. Correlational (H) shows association but not causation.

So the correct answer should be B: longitudinal.

The correct answer is B: longitudinal. A longitudinal study involves tracking the same individuals over a period, allowing researchers to observe changes in intelligence test scores as age increases. This design is well-suited to demonstrate a decline in scores in early adulthood.

Answer: B
