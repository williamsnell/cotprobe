Okay, so I've got this question about the ratio of intensities of Rayleigh scattering for two hydrogen lines. Hmm, I remember Rayleigh scattering is when light scatters off particles in the same medium, and the intensity depends on the square of the electric field of the scattered light. Oh right, the formula is something like I ∝ (1/λ²), where λ is the wavelength of the light.

The question gives me two wavelengths: lambda 1 is 410 nm and lambda 2 is 656 nm. I need to find the ratio I1/I2. Let me write that down.

I1/I2 = (1/λ1²) / (1/λ2²) = (λ2²) / (λ1²) = (λ2/λ1)².

So, first, I'll compute the ratio of the wavelengths. λ2 is 656 nm, λ1 is 410 nm. So 656 divided by 410. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 410 times 1.6 is about 656. Because 400 times 1.6 is 640, so 410 *1.6 = 656. So 656/410 is approximately 1.6. But let me be more precise. 410 *1.6 is 656? Let me compute 410 * 1.6: 410 * 1 = 410, 0.6 *410=246. So 410 +246=656. Oh yeah, exactly. So 656/410 is 1.6 exactly. Wait no, wait, because 410 times 1.6 is 656? Let me double-check. 410 * 1.6 = 410 * 1 + 410 *0.6 = 410 + 246 = 656. Yep, that's correct.

So the ratio λ2/λ1 is 1.6. Now square that ratio for the intensity ratio: (1.6)^2 = 2.56. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 2.56. Wait, the options are all in the tens or maybe others. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me calculate 656 divided by 410. 

656 ÷ 410 = ?

Hmm, perhaps I can divide both numerator and denominator by 2: 328/205. Let me see if that simplifies. 205 times 1 is 205, 205 *1.6 is 328. Yes, so 328/205 = 1.6. So my initial calculation was correct.

So I1/I2 = (1.6)^2 = 2.56. Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option D: 2.98:1. But 2.56 isn't any of the options. Did I do something wrong here?

Wait, wait, another possibility: Maybe the question is asking for the ratio I2/I1 instead of I1/I2. Because sometimes in these problems, the order matters. Let me check the question again. Oh, the question says "the ratio of intensities of Rayleigh scattering for the two hydrogen lines λ1=410 nm and λ2=656 nm." It says "the ratio of intensities", so which one is the numerator and denominator?

Wait, intensity ratio I1/I2 is 2.56, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula? Or perhaps the question is giving the ratio as I2/I1, which would be 1.6^2=2.56, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the ratio of I2/I1, which would be 2.56, but I don't see that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 656 divided by 410: Let me compute it properly.

410 * 1.6 = 656.

Wait, but maybe I should compute 656/410.

410 × 1 = 410.

410 × 0.6 = 246.

410 ×1.6 =656.

So 656/410 is exactly 1.6.

So (1.6)^2 is 2.56. So the ratio I1/I2 is 2.56.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 2.98:1, but I don't see a 2.56.

Wait, looking again: The options are:

A:4.23:1

B:10.24:1

C:8.67:1

D:2.98:1

E:5.67:1

F:7.81:1

G:5.32:1

H:3.14:1

I:9.00:1

J:6.55:1

Hmm, none of these options match 2.56. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another angle: The intensity of Rayleigh scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. Because I = (8π^4 n e^4) / (3 h^3 λ^4), where n is number density of particles, e is the charge, h is Planck's constant. So I ∝ 1/λ^4. So the ratio I1/I2 would be (λ2/λ1)^4.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's (λ2/λ1)^2. So perhaps I was wrong. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the formula for intensity in Rayleigh scattering is I = (8 π^4 n e^4) / (3 h^3 λ^4) * (1/(4π)) * (e^2/(4π ε_0))^2 ) / (4π/λ^2) ) * I0, but perhaps it's easier to remember that the intensity is proportional to (1/λ^4). So I1/I2 = (λ2^4)/(λ1^4).

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion comes from the dependence on wavelength. So if I1 is the intensity for λ1, and I2 for λ2.

I1 ∝ 1/λ1^4.

I2 ∝ 1/λ2^4.

So the ratio I1/I2 is (λ2^4)/(λ1^4) = (λ2/λ1)^4.

So in that case, (656/410) = 1.6, so 1.6^4 is (1.6^2)^2 = (2.56)^2 = 6.5536. So approximately 6.55:1.

Looking again at the options, option F is 7.81:1, which is about 7.8, but our calculation is approximately 6.55. Option J is 6.55:1. So that would be option J.

Wait, but earlier I thought the intensity is proportional to 1/λ², but that's when considering the scattering cross-section and the solid angle. Oh wait, no. Wait, another thought: The absorption coefficient (or absorption) and the absorption cross-section.

Wait, the formula for Rayleigh scattering intensity is I ∝ (n_e λ^4) * (1/(4π λ^2)) ), which simplifies to n_e λ²/(4π), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe it's easier to consult the formula. The intensity of Rayleigh scattering is given by:

I(λ) = (8 π^4 n e^4) / (3 h^3) * (1/(4 π λ^2)) ) * (e^2/(4 π ε_0))^2 * (4 π/λ^2) ) * I_0

Wait, maybe that's not the best way. Alternatively, I'm pretty sure that the intensity of Rayleigh scattering depends on 1/λ^4. Because the scattered intensity is inversely proportional to the wavelength to the fourth power.

So if that's the case, the ratio I1/I2 is (λ2/λ1)^4.

So (656/410) =1.6, 1.6^4 is 6.5536. So the ratio is approximately 6.55:1.

Looking at the options, option J is 6.55:1. So the correct answer would be option J.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that the ratio I1/I2 was (λ2^2)/(λ1^2), which would be 2.56, which isn't in the options. So that suggests that the formula was incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the exact formula. Another approach: the scattering cross-section for Rayleigh scattering is given by sigma = (8 π/3) (n_e e^4) / (λ^2), and the intensity is sigma times the incident intensity times the cross-section factor. Alternatively, the intensity formula is I = (8π n_e e^4) / (3 λ^4) * something. So the intensity is proportional to 1/λ^4.

Therefore, I1/I2 = (λ2^4)/(λ1^4) = (656/410)^4.

Compute 656/410 = 1.6. 1.6^2 is 2.56. 2.56 squared is (2.56)^2= 6.5536. So approximately 6.55.

Looking at the options, J is 6.55:1, which matches.

So the correct answer is J.

To determine the ratio of intensities of Rayleigh scattering for the two hydrogen lines \( \lambda_1 = 410 \, \text{nm} \) and \( \lambda_2 = 656 \, \text{nm} \), we use the fact that the intensity of Rayleigh scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. This is because the intensity \( I \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\lambda^4} \), and the ratio of intensities is given by:

\[
\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \left( \frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1} \right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Compute the wavelength ratio
First, calculate the ratio of the wavelengths:
\[
\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1} = \frac{656}{410} = 1.6
\]

### Step 2: Compute the intensity ratio
Using the formula for the intensity ratio:
\[
\frac{I_1}{I_2} = (1.6)^4
\]
Breaking this down:
\[
1.6^2 = 2.56
\]
\[
(1.6)^4 = (1.6^2)^2 = (2.56)^2 = 6.5536
\]
Thus, the ratio of intensities is approximately \( 6.55:1 \).

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The calculated ratio \( 6.55:1 \) corresponds to option **J**.
