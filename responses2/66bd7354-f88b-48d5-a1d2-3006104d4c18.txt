Okay, so I have this legal question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a car accident where a wealthy man died, and a woman's mother worked as a secretary for him for years. She filed a claim, saying she was his daughter. At trial, the woman's attorney called the Butler, who testified that in her household, the wealthy man and his mother were having an affair. Also, the Butler testified that the wealthy man often told him shortly after her birth that she was his daughter. The executor's estate's attorney is objecting to this testimony.

The options are A to J, each giving a possible outcome. I need to determine which option is correct based on the evidence presented.

First, I remember that hearsay is a statement that needs to be admitted in court. The hearsay rule requires that the statement be made before the person in question is personally aware of it. So, evidence that's hearsay could be inadmissible.

But let's look at the butler's testimony. He said two things: 1) the mother and wealthy man had an affair, and 2) the wealthy man often told him shortly after her birth that she was his daughter.

Now, the key here is the use of "common knowledge." In the context of the hearsay rule, common knowledge is when it is generally known by all parties involved. If the butler's testimony relies on the fact that the mother and wealthy man were having an affair, that might be considered common knowledge.

Wait, but in evidence law, especially under the hearsay rule, statements that are common knowledge are generally admissible because they're not specific enough for the hearsay rule to apply. Alternatively, in some cases, when the statement is made under circumstances that make it common knowledge, it might not be hearsay.

So in this case, the butler is testifying that the mother and wealthy man were having an affair. If the mother and the wealthy man were in a relationship or had an affair without the butler's knowledge, that might be considered common knowledge. Because the butler is the one who knows, but the other party (the mother and wealthy man) were aware of it.

Alternatively, if the mother and wealthy man had an affair without the butler's knowledge, that statement would be considered common knowledge. So the butler's testimony would be based on the fact that the mother and wealthy man were having an affair, which they knew about in the household.

Another point is about the hearsay rule and the " privileged communication" part. Butler is testifying about his own knowledge, which is a privilege under the law. But that's about the butler's own knowledge, not the statement made by the butler to the mother.

Wait, the hearsay rule requires that the statement be made before the person is aware. So if the butler is asserting a statement about a relationship that wasn't known by his co-parties (the mother and the wealthy man), then that might not be hearsay. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, but common knowledge is about what is generally known by everyone. So if the butler is testifying that the mother and wealthy man were having an affair, and that the butler himself knew about it (since he's the one who called him), but the other parties didn't know, then that's common knowledge. So the statement is not hearsay because it relies on common knowledge.

So the butler's testimony would be considered admissible as a statement of common knowledge, meaning it doesn't violate the hearsay rule.

Now, looking at the options, which one applies?

Option G says that the testimony would be in violation of attorney-client privilege. But the butler is testifying about the matter, and the privilege applies to statements made by the client to the client. The butler is testifying about the mother and wealthy man's relationship, which the other parties (the mother and wealthy man) didn't know. So the butler's testimony about the mother's knowledge is privileged if it's about a matter the client (the butler) was not directly asked to state.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The "attorney-client privilege" applies to statements the client makes to the client. Here, the butler is testifying to the mother and wealthy man's relationship, not directly stating that they were having an affair. So the privilege would apply to the mother's knowledge, but the butler's testimony about that is about the relationship, which the client (the butler) did not make a direct statement of.

Wait, no. Let me think about this differently. The butler is testifying about the mother and wealthy man's relationship, which is not directly stated by the client. The privilege is about statements the client makes to the client. So if the butler is testifying about the mother's knowledge, which the client (butler) has, does that count as privileged? Maybe not. Because the privilege is about statements the client made to the client, not about the client's own knowledge about the matter.

Wait, no, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to recall. The attorney-client privilege applies when the client is testifying about a matter that the client was not directly asked to state. It doesn't apply if the client is directly stating the matter.

In this case, the butler is testifying about the mother's knowledge. The mother and the wealthy man were in a relationship without the butler's knowledge. So the butler's testimony is about the mother's knowledge, which the client (butler) has. So is this a matter the client was directly asked to state? I don't think so because the butler isn't directly stating the matter. So the privilege doesn't apply here.

Alternatively, if the butler is testifying about the mother and wealthy man's relationship, which the client (butler) wasn't directly asked to state, then the privilege does not apply. So the butler's testimony would be admissible.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the mother and wealthy man were in a relationship. Butler is testifying that they were. If they were in a relationship without the butler's knowledge, then the butler's testimony is about the matter the client (the butler) was not directly asked to state. So this would fall under the privilege, making the testimony admissible.

But wait, but the question is about whether the testimony is inadmissible. If the butler is testifying about the mother's knowledge, which the butler has, then the privilege wouldn't apply because the privilege is about the client's knowledge or statements (not necessarily the client's knowledge about the matter, but the client's statements). So the butler's statements about the matter (the mother's relationship) would be privileged if the client was not asked to state it. 

Wait, no. The privilege is about the client's statements to the client. If the butler is directly stating the mother's knowledge, that would be privileged. But if the butler is testifying about the matter without directly stating it, then the privilege doesn't apply.

In this case, the butler is testifying that the mother and wealthy man were having an affair, and that the wealthy man told him shortly after her birth that she's his daughter. So the butler is not directly stating that they were having an affair; he's asserting a statement about their relationship. So the privilege (which applies when the client is not directly asked to state the matter) would not apply here.

Therefore, the butler's testimony would be admissible as a statement of common knowledge if the statements are made under circumstances where the parties know each other. Or perhaps the mother and wealthy man were aware of the affair, making the butler's statement a fact they knew.

Wait, the butler's testimony is about the mother and wealthy man's affairs, which they knew about. So the butler is testifying about the fact that they were having an affair. So the statement would be based on the fact that the mother and the wealthy man were in a relationship (even if the butler didn't know about it). 

So, if the butler's testimony relies on the fact that the mother and the wealthy man were in a relationship, which they knew about, then that makes the statement a fact and not hearsay. Therefore, the butler's testimony would be inadmissible because it's hearsay, but wait, no. Because the statement is based on common knowledge, it might not be hearsay.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to use the hearsay rule. The statement made by the butler is about the mother and the wealthy man's relationship. If the mother and wealthy man were in a relationship without the butler's knowledge, then the statement is a fact, not hearsay. So, the butler's testimony would be admissible as a fact.

But wait, the question is about what the court will most likely do. If the butler's testimony is considered inadmissible, then the court would overrule the objection.

Alternatively, if the testimony is admissible, the court would sustain the objection.

Wait, the question is, which option is correct. Let's look at the options again.

Option G says, "Sustain the objection because the butler's testimony is in violation of attorney-client privilege."

But if the butler is testifying about the matter, but the client (the butler) was not directly asked to state it, then the privilege doesn't apply. So the testimony would be admissible.

Wait, but the mother and wealthy man were in an affair. So the butler is testifying that the mother and wealthy man were having an affair. Butler's testimony is about their relationship, not directly stating that. So the privilege applies only if the client was directly asked to state the matter. Since the butler isn't directly stating the matter, the privilege doesn't apply. Therefore, the testimony would be admissible.

But then, another angle: if the butler's testimony is about the mother's knowledge (the fact that the mother was involved in the affair), and the mother was in a relationship, then the butler's statement is based on facts that the mother and wealthy man knew. So the statement is not hearsay because it's based on common knowledge.

So, the butler's testimony is admissible, so the court would not overrule the objection. Therefore, the correct option is E: overrule the objection because the butler's testimony is admissible.

Wait, but then looking at the options, option G is about attorney-client privilege. So which applies?

Wait, another thought. The butler is testifying about the mother and the wealthy man's relationship. If the mother and wealthy man were in a relationship, then the butler's statement is about their relationship. If the butler's knowledge comes from the mother's knowledge, then the statement is based on common knowledge, making it admissible.

So, in this case, the butler's testimony would be admissible as a statement of fact because it's about a matter the client (butler) was not directly asked to state. So the objection is overruled because the testimony is admissible.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Another approach: the mother and the wealthy man were having an affair. The butler is testifying about their relationship. Since the mother and wealthy man were in a relationship without the butler's knowledge, their knowledge is common knowledge. So the butler's statement is a fact (not hearsay). Therefore, the testimony is admissible, so the objection is overruled.

Looking back, the options:

E: overrule objection because butler's testimony is admissible.

So E would be the answer.

But wait, another angle: the mother and the wealthy man were in an affair. So, the butler is testifying that they were, but the butler doesn't know about it. So the statement is about the matter the client (butler) was not directly asked to state. Therefore, the privilege doesn't apply, and the testimony is admissible.

So the court would overrule the objection because the butler's testimony is admissible. So the correct option is E.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the butler's testimony is admissible under the hearsay rule. The butler testifies that the wealthy man and his mother were having an affair and that the wealthy man told him shortly after her birth that she was his daughter. The issue is whether this testimony is inadmissible.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Hearsay Rule**: Statements made without the speaker being personally aware of them are generally inadmissible. The butler is testifying about the mother and wealthy man's relationship, which the parties involved knew about, making it a matter of common knowledge.

2. **Attorney-Client Privilege**: This applies when the client is not directly asked to state a matter. In this case, the butler is testifying about the relationship without being directly asked to state it, so the privilege does not apply. Thus, the butler's testimony is not considered privileged.

3. **Common Knowledge**: The butler's testimony is based on the fact that the mother and wealthy man were in a relationship without the butler's knowledge. This makes the statement a fact, not hearsay, and thus admissible.

4. **Options Evaluation**:
   - **E**: Overrules the objection because the butler's testimony is admissible. This is correct because the butler's testimony is about a matter the client was not directly asked to state, and it is based on common knowledge.

ANSWER: E
