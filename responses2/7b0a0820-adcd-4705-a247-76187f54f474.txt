Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about auditing, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question is about designing tests of details to ensure sufficient audit evidence supports which of the following. The options are A through J, each with a different statement.

Hmm, I remember that auditing involves several key areas. Fundamentals of audit sampling, risk assessment, control, etc. Let me think about each option.

Option A: The planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level. Wait, assurance is about confidence in assertions. But the question is about ensuring sufficient evidence, which I think relates more to risk assessment rather than assurance.

Option B: The planned level of detection risk. Detection risk is the risk that the auditor will fail to detect a material misstatement. So designing tests to support detection risk makes sense because detecting risks would ensure that the auditor's evidence is sufficient to find issues.

Option C: The effectiveness of the organization's risk management. That seems broader. It's more about ensuring the risk management plan is effective, which could support multiple audit procedures. But the question is about ensuring evidence supports a specific assertion.

Option D: Management’s assertions about internal controls. I'm not sure. This seems more about management's knowledge or suspicion, which relates to control risk rather than the audit evidence supporting a planned level of control risk.

Option E: Management’s assertions about future profitability. That's more about financial statements and management's expectations, possibly related to control risk or audit objectives.

Option F: Financial statements free from material misstatement. That sounds like the audit's main objective. It's about the integrity of the financial statements, but the question is about designing tests to support specific assertions, not about the actual content of the statements.

Option G: Planned level of control risk. Control risk is the risk that uncontrolled deviations from normal business processes will affect outcomes. So designing tests for control risk makes sense because it's about identifying and evaluating controls.

Option H: Organization’s compliance with laws and regulations. Compliance is a different aspect, more about the business's adherence to rules. It might relate to audit objectives like ensuring proper records or reporting.

Option I: Accuracy of financial reporting. Again, this is about the integrity of the financial statements, which is about the audit objective, not the specific assertion support.

Option J: Effectiveness of internal controls. Effective internal controls are crucial for detecting and preventing fraud, which would relate to detecting risk.

So the question is asking what is supported by the tests of details. Tests of details are designed to provide sufficient evidence about specific assertions. The options that pertain to ensuring that the evidence supports a planned level of risk are B (detection risk) and G (control risk).

Wait, but the question says "sufficient audit evidence supports which of the following." So the assertion is about whether the evidence (tests of details) support a certain plan.

Option B: planned level of detection risk. That's about whether the auditor can detect material misstatements, which is a specific risk that the tests would support.

Option G: planned level of control risk. That's about the effectiveness of controls.

Now, which one is the correct answer? The question is about supporting a specific assertion. If the tests are designed to support a planned level of control risk, that directly relates to internal controls' effectiveness. Alternatively, detection risk is about finding misstatements.

Wait, the question is about ensuring that the tests of details support which assertion. So the tests would be designed to assess certain risks, and the answer is the risk that's being planned. So options B and G are both possible.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about the assertions that the tests of details support. For example, when designing tests, you might plan for the detection risk (how likely you are to find a material misstatement) and the control risk (how likely you are to find a deviation from controls). 

So the tests are designed under the assumption that they will support the planning of a certain level of control risk. So the correct answer would be G: the planned level of control risk.

Because the tests of details are designed to assess control risk, ensuring that the evidence supports the planned level of control risk. Alternatively, if it was detection risk, the tests would support detection risk, but the question is about which assertion the tests support.

Wait, another angle. In auditing, when you set up tests, you plan for the risk associated with the assertion. So if you plan for a certain level of control risk, you set up tests that can support that level. So the answer is G.

Alternatively, if the question were about the audit's effectiveness, the tests might be set up to ensure that the audit's outcomes are reliable.

Wait, the question is specifically about supporting which assertion. So the tests are designed to assess the planned level of control risk, which is G.
</think>

The correct answer is **G: The planned level of control risk**.

**Explanation:**
The question asks which assertion is supported by the tests of details. Tests of details are designed to assess risks like control risk and detection risk. Among the options, **G** refers to the planned level of control risk, which is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls. Tests are intended to ensure that the planned level of control risk is effectively managed and identified.
