Question:

Farmer Fred was the owner of Grapeview Farm, the largest farm in the County of Grapeview. Fred was advised by his gift and estate attorney to begin making annual fractionalized gifts of the property to his children. Fred executed a conveyance instrument, stating the gifts as "one-thirtieth of my ownership interest in Grapeview County, the eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property is hereby given to all my children per capita." This description of the land to be conveyed is

Options:

A: Sufficient, because it gives a clear description of the fractional gift.
B: Sufficient, because it mentions the name of the county and the property.
C: Sufficient, because it includes the name of the property and a portion of it.
D: Insufficient, because it doesn't state the exact measurements of the land to be given.
E: Insufficient, because the gifts to the children lacked consideration.
F: Insufficient, because it doesn't specify the exact location of the eastern one-tenth.
G: Insufficient, because it is too vague.
H: Sufficient, because the property can be identified.
I: Sufficient, because it satisfies the title of seisin.

Okay, so I've got this question about fractional gifts and what's considered sufficient. Let me try to break it down. 

So, the question is about whether Farmer Fred's conveyance was sufficient as a fractional gift. The conveyance he made was a bit odd—he gave one-thirtieth of his ownership interest and then said that the eastern one-tenth of the western corner is given to all his children per capita. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me think.

First, I remember that fractional gifts are those where the entire ownership interest is divided among the transferees. But the way they're described here is a bit different. So, he's giving a portion (one-third) as his own interest and then another part (one-tenth) as a gift to his children. Wait, does that make sense? Because if he's giving a fractional portion, the total should add up to the original interest. So the total would be 1/3 + 1/10, which is 13/30, not the whole 1. So that doesn't add up. So, is the total ownership interest being split? Or is the conveyance incomplete?

Wait, maybe not. Maybe he's saying that he's giving a third of his interest plus a tenth as a gift. So, if you give a third, that's 10/30, and then an additional 3/30 as a gift. Wait, but that would make 13/30, which is less than 1. So, is that a fractional gift? Or is he trying to give a third, and separately, a tenth as a gift? I'm a bit confused here.

The question asks whether the description is sufficient. Let me check the options. The options talk about whether it's sufficient or not in terms of details. 

Option A says it's sufficient because it gives a clear description. But wait, the unclear part is whether the total adds up to the original ownership. If the total is less than the whole, then it's not a complete fractional gift. So, the description is incomplete because it doesn't mention that the third and tenth add up to the whole. So, the conveyance isn't a fractional gift, it's just an allocation without specifying the total. So, the description lacks the necessary information.

Option B says it's sufficient because it mentions the county and the property. But I don't think that's enough. The description is vague about the exact measurements. Without knowing the exact size, you can't really distribute it properly. So, the description is too vague, which is a problem.

Option C says it's sufficient because it includes the property and a portion. Well, the property is named, so that's part of it. But again, without the exact measurements, it's not sufficient. So, C isn't correct.

Option D says it's insufficient because it doesn't specify the exact location. Oh right, the description says "eastern one tenth of the western corner." Wait, the western corner's location isn't specified. So, the location is unclear. That makes it insufficient because the gift's location is not clear. So, D is correct because it's too vague.

Option E says it's insufficient because no consideration was given. Fractional gifts usually require consideration. But wait, in this case, does the transfer require some form of consideration? The question doesn't state whether the children are paying anything. So, the description doesn't include any consideration, which is a problem. But the question is about sufficiency—so if it's insufficient for a fractional gift because it lacks consideration, then E is correct. But wait, the options have other reasons, like whether it's sufficient based on the description.

Wait, let me re-examine. The conveyance is a fractional gift, but the way it's described is ambiguous. It's unclear if he's giving a third of his interest plus a tenth, or if he's considering a third and a tenth separately. So, the description is unclear in terms of the total ownership. So, it's not a proper fractional gift because the total isn't clear. So, it's insufficient.

But wait, let me go back to the options. The question is about whether the description is sufficient. So, if the description lacks the necessary information, it's insufficient.

Looking again at the options:

Option E: Insufficient because no consideration. So, the conveyance itself is a fractional gift, but to be a fractional gift, you need consideration. Since the question doesn't specify that each child is paying something, this might be a problem. But the question is about the sufficiency of the description. So, the description is insufficient for a fractional gift because it doesn't specify the exact measurements. So, E is correct if the issue is lack of consideration, but another reason?

Wait, perhaps the main issue is that the description is ambiguous in terms of the total ownership. It's unclear whether it's one-third plus an additional tenth, or if it's a third and a tenth as separate gifts. So, the description is insufficient because it doesn't specify the total or the exact distribution.

Wait, but the question is whether the description is sufficient. So, the issue is that the description is too vague. Without the exact measurements, it's unclear whether the total is a third plus a tenth or what. So, the description is insufficient because it doesn't specify the exact measurements.

Alternatively, if the description is that it's one-tenth as a gift, but it's unclear where, then it's wrong.

So, looking at the options, option E says it's insufficient because it's too vague. But I thought option D was about lack of exact location. So which is the problem?

Wait, the description in the conveyance is: one-tenth of the western corner. So, the location is not specified. So, the location is unclear. So, that's a problem. So, the description is insufficient because it doesn't specify the exact location. So, option D is correct.

But wait, another point: the conveyance is a fractional gift. Fractional gifts do require consideration. So, if the children are getting a gift, you need to give consideration. But in this case, the description doesn't mention anything about the children paying. So, this is a problem. So, the description is insufficient because it doesn't state the consideration given to the transferees. So, the conveyance itself is a fractional gift (so sufficient), but it's insufficient because it lacks consideration.

But the question is about whether the description is sufficient. So, without consideration, it's not a sufficient description.

Wait, but the options are about sufficiency of the description. So, if the problem is that the description is too vague (like location), that makes it insufficient. So, option D says insufficient because of the exact location. But the issue is that location is not given. So, the description is insufficient because it doesn't specify the exact location, meaning that the location can't be determined. So, the conveyance is a fractional gift (so sufficient), but the description is insufficient because it's too vague. So, the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but the options are about whether the description is sufficient. So, if the description is insufficient, then which option is correct?

Option E: Insufficient because no consideration. So, the conveyance is a fractional gift, but it's insufficient because it lacks consideration. However, the question is about whether the description is sufficient. So, the problem is that the description is too vague because it doesn't specify the exact location. That makes the description insufficient for a fractional gift. So, option D is correct.

Wait, but another angle: the conveyance is a fractional gift only if the total is clear. So, the description is incorrect in that it's not a fractional gift because the total is not clear. So, the description is insufficient because it's ambiguous in total ownership. So, the answer would be E because it's insufficient for a fractional gift, but the question is whether the description is sufficient.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The problem is with the description: it's ambiguous about the total ownership. So, it's not a complete fractional gift. So, the description is insufficient. So, the correct answer is E: Insufficient because it's too vague. But wait, the options include D as insufficient because of the exact location.

Wait, the question is about the sufficiency of the description. So, the issue is that the location is not specified. So, the description is too vague because the location is unknown. So, the answer is D: insufficient because it's too vague.

Alternatively, the problem is that the description doesn't state the total ownership, so it's insufficient for a fractional gift. So, the description is insufficient because it's unclear.

So, looking at the options, the correct reason for insufficient description is that it's too vague because it doesn't specify the exact location. So, the answer is D: insufficient because it's too vague.

Wait, but another point: in fractional gifts, the total ownership must be a whole. So, the description is wrong because it's one-third plus an extra one-tenth, but that's not the right way to describe it. So, the way to describe it is that it's one-third and a tenth, but perhaps the way it's written is that the eastern one-tenth is given to all children per capita. So, that's an additional tenth.

Wait, but the initial description is a bit confusing. So, maybe the way it's described is that one-third is his interest, and the eastern one-tenth is given to the children. But then, wait, one-tenth plus one-third is more than a third, which would require the total to be more than one. So, perhaps the way it's described is that the children get a third and a tenth, making it 13/30, which is less than 1. So, that's not a proper fractional gift.

But the question is about whether the description is sufficient, not whether it's a proper gift. So, the issue is that the description is unclear in terms of the total. So, the description says one-tenth of the western corner, which is unclear. So, the description is too vague because it doesn't specify what's being given as the fractional portion. So, the description is insufficient because it doesn't specify the exact measurements.

So, the answer is D: insufficient because it's too vague.
</think>

The question evaluates the sufficiency of Farmer Fred's conveyance description for a fractional gift. The description provides a portion (one-tenth of the western corner) but lacks clarity on the total ownership, which is necessary for a proper fractional gift. Additionally, the location of the western corner is not specified, making the description too vague. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect because the description is not sufficiently clear.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because the description is not sufficiently vague.
- **Option C**: Incorrect because the description is not sufficiently vague.
- **Option D**: Correct because the description is too vague due to the lack of exact measurements.
- **Option E**: Incorrect because the description is insufficient for a fractional gift (lack of consideration) but not because it's too vague.
- **Option F**: Incorrect because it does not state the exact location.
- **Option G**: Incorrect because the description is insufficient for a fractional gift.
- **Option H**: Incorrect because the description is not sufficient.
- **Option I**: Incorrect because the description does not satisfy the title of seisin.

The correct answer is D: insufficient because it is too vague.
