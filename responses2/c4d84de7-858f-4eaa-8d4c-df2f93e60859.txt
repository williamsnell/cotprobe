Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The reaction given is C₂H₄O decomposing into CH₄ and CO. The rate constant is 0.0123 per minute at 415°C. I need to find the percentage of the original C₂H₄O that will decompose after heating for 1 hour. The options are A through J, with some percentages.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with first-order reactions, the formula relates the time elapsed to the concentration of the reactant. The general formula for a first-order reaction is ln([A]₀/[A]) = kt, where [A]₀ is the initial concentration, [A] is the concentration at time t, k is the rate constant, and t is time.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "percent of original present that will decompose". So, if I calculate [A]₀ - [A], that would be the amount decomposed. But maybe it's easier to think in terms of remaining concentration.

So, let's think about the decomposition. The reaction is C₂H₄O → CH₄ + CO. So, the reactant is turning into two products. So, the rate is dependent on the concentration of C₂H₄O.

The formula for the concentration remaining after time t for a first-order reaction is [A] = [A]₀ * e^(-kt). Because the reaction is 1st order, and the rate depends on the concentration of the only reactant.

Wait, so the initial amount of C₂H₄O is [A]₀, and after time t, it's [A] = [A]₀ * e^(-kt). So, the amount decomposed would be [A]₀ - [A] = [A]₀ (1 - e^(-kt)). And then, the percentage decomposed would be that amount divided by the initial concentration multiplied by 100%.

So, the percentage decomposition is (1 - e^(-kt)) * 100%. Let's plug in the numbers.

Given:
k = 0.0123 min^-1
t = 1 hour. Oh wait, wait a minute, the units for k and t need to be compatible. Because k is per minute, and t is in hours. So, need to convert 1 hour to minutes. 1 hour is 60 minutes.

So, t = 60 min.

So, compute e^(-k t) = e^(-0.0123 * 60).

Let me calculate 0.0123 * 60. Let's see, 0.0123 * 60. 0.01 *60 is 0.6, 0.0023 *60 is 0.138. So 0.6 + 0.138 = 0.738.

So, e^(-0.738). Wait, what's e^0.738? I can approximate that. Alternatively, maybe compute it numerically. Alternatively, I can think that e^0.7 is approximately 2.01375. Wait, wait, e^0.738 is about what? Let me think. Let me use a calculator approach.

Wait, e^0.7 is about 2.01375, e^0.738 would be a bit higher. Alternatively, using a calculator method, but since I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can calculate it step by step.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the approximation ln(2) is about 0.693, and ln(3) is about 1.0986. So, 0.738 is between 0.693 and 1.0986. Wait, wait, no, 0.738 is approximately 0.738.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute it as e^(-0.738). Let me think about what e^-0.7 is. e^-0.7 is about 0.4966. Then, 0.738 is 0.7 + 0.038. So, the difference is 0.038. Since e^x is approximately 1 + x + x^2/2 + ... when x is small. So, for x=0.038:

e^-0.038 ≈ 1 - 0.038 + (0.038)^2/2 = 0.962 + (0.001444)/2 = 0.962 + 0.000722 ≈ 0.9627.

So, e^-0.738 ≈ e^-(0.7 + 0.038) = e^-0.7 * e^-0.038 ≈ 0.4966 * 0.9627 ≈ 0.478.

So, approximately 0.478.

So, 1 - 0.478 = 0.522. So, about 52.2% is decomposed.

Looking at the options, option A is 52.1%, which is very close. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Let me compute 0.0123 * 60. 0.0123 * 60 is 0.738. So e^-0.738.

I think I might have made a mistake in the approximation. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute e^(-0.738).

Alternatively, I can use the fact that ln(2) is approximately 0.693, and e^0.738 is e^(0.693 + 0.045) = e^0.693 * e^0.045. e^0.693 is 2, so e^0.738 = 2 * e^0.045.

e^0.045 is approximately 1 + 0.045 + (0.045)^2/2 + (0.045)^3/6. Let me compute that.

(0.045)^2 = 0.002025, divided by 2 is 0.0010125. (0.045)^3= 0.000091125, divided by 6 is about 0.0000151875.

So, e^0.045 ≈ 1 + 0.045 + 0.0010125 + 0.0000151875 ≈ 1.0460276875.

So, e^0.738 = 2 * 1.0460276875 ≈ 2.092055375.

So, e^-0.738 ≈ 1/2.092055375 ≈ approximately 0.478.

So, 1 - 0.478 is 0.522, which is 52.2% decomposed. So, the percentage is 52.2%, which rounds to 52.2%. Looking at the options, option A is 52.1%, which is very close. So the correct answer should be A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decomposition reaction: **C₂H₄O → CH₄ + CO**. This is a first-order reaction with a rate constant \( k = 0.0123 \, \text{min}^{-1} \) at 415°C. The goal is to calculate the percentage of the original \( \text{C₂H₄O} \) that decomposes after 1 hour (60 minutes).

For a first-order reaction, the concentration of the reactant at time \( t \) is given by:

\[
[A] = [A]_0 e^{-kt}
\]

Here:
- \( [A]_0 \) is the initial concentration of \( \text{C₂H₄O} \),
- \( [A] \) is the concentration remaining after time \( t \),
- \( k \) is the rate constant,
- \( t \) is the time elapsed.

The percentage of the original \( \text{C₂H₄O} \) that decomposes is:

\[
\text{Percentage decomposed} = \left(1 - e^{-kt}\right) \times 100\%
\]

### Step 1: Convert time to minutes
The reaction time is 1 hour, which equals 60 minutes. Thus, \( t = 60 \, \text{min} \).

### Step 2: Calculate \( kt \)
\[
kt = 0.0123 \, \text{min}^{-1} \times 60 \, \text{min} = 0.738
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( e^{-kt} \)
We need to evaluate \( e^{-0.738} \). Using approximations or a calculator (if available), we find:
\[
e^{-0.738} \approx 0.478
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage decomposed
\[
\text{Percentage decomposed} = (1 - 0.478) \times 100\% = 0.522 \times 100\% = 52.2\%
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to 52.2% is **52.1%** (Option A).
