The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A plaintiff sued the insurer of her home after the insurer denied coverage for water damage to the home allegedly caused by a frozen plastic pipe that burst. At trial, the insurer called as an expert witness an engineer, who testified that the pipe had burst because of age rather than freezing. On cross-examination, the engineer admitted that five years earlier, he had been convicted of tax fraud, even though he had asserted that it was his accountant's error. In response, the insurer calls a witness, who is well acquainted with the engineer and his reputation, to testify that (1) in the witness's opinion, the engineer is a truthful person, and (2) the engineer's neighbors all describe him as a truthful person. How much, if any, of the witness's testimony is admissible?

Options:

A: None of the testimony is admissible, because it is collateral, having no bearing on the engineer's qualifications as an expert.
B: Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.
C: Both portions of the testimony are admissible, but only as they relate to the engineer's truthfulness, not his expertise.
D: None of the testimony is admissible, because character evidence is not relevant to the engineer's expertise.
E: All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.
F: Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, as it is directly relevant to his character for truthfulness.
G: Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character is admissible, as it directly relates to his credibility.
H: Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character, because the witness's reporting of the neighbors' comments is hearsay.
I: None of the testimony is admissible, because the witness is biased due to their acquaintance with the engineer.
J: All of the testimony is admissible, but the judge must instruct the jury to consider the engineer's past conviction.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about evidence admissibility. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

The scenario is a plaintiff suing an insurer for water damage caused by a frozen pipe that burst. The insurer denies coverage, so the plaintiff is suing. The expert witness is an engineer who testified that the pipe burst because of age, not freezing. But the engineer was actually convicted of tax fraud five years ago because he asserted his accountant's error. On cross-examination, the engineer admitted that he was convicted of tax fraud but stated it was his accountant's mistake.

Now, the insurer is calling a witness who is familiar with the engineer to testify about two things: first, that the engineer is truthful, and second, that his neighbors describe him as truthful. The question is whether the witness's testimony is admissible.

The options are A to J, each suggesting different admissibility outcomes. I need to determine which is correct.

First, I remember that evidence is admissible under certain rules, like Rule 105 or 106, which allows hearsay if it's in the form of statement, written, or impression, and the statement or statement or impression is made by someone of significant character, like an expert witness who is a peer, a superior, or a superior peer.

Wait, but in this case, the expert witness is the engineer. So the expert's testimony is that the pipe burst because of age. His testimony is about the cause of the damage.

But the witness is trying to add character evidence about the engineer's honesty. Character evidence is typically admissible if it relates to how the witness perceives the character of the expert witness. For example, if a witness's testimony that the expert is honest relates to the expert's qualifications, it's admissible.

But there might be some exceptions. For instance, under Rule 106(b), if the character evidence is offered to prove the expert's character, and the expert's performance was a significant part of the defense, it's not admissible. Wait, no, that's under Rule 106(b). If the character evidence relates to the expert's performance, it might be excluded.

Wait, but in this case, the character evidence is about the engineer's honesty. The expert's testimony is about the cause of the damage, not his character. So the witness is trying to add character evidence about the engineer's honesty, relating to his character.

So, the question is whether the witness's testimony about the engineer's honesty is admissible. Since the engineer was convicted of tax fraud, but he testified that it was his accountant's mistake, maybe he's lying.

But the witness is trying to add character evidence. The Rule 106(b) says that if the character evidence is offered to prove the expert's character, and the expert's performance was a part of the defense, it's excluded. But here, the expert's performance (the cause of the damage) was not the defense. The defense was his tax fraud conviction.

Wait, but the witness is adding character evidence about his own honesty. So perhaps the character evidence is admissible because it's about the expert's character. But wait, Rule 106(b) says that if the witness is trying to prove the expert's character, and the expert's performance was part of the defense, it's excluded. But in this case, the expert's performance was about the cause of the damage, not about his tax fraud. So maybe the character evidence isn't excluded because the expert's performance wasn't the defense.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the rules. Let me think. Rule 106(b) says that if the character evidence is offered to prove the expert's character, and the expert's performance was a part of the defense, it's not admissible. But if the performance was not the defense, then the character evidence is admissible.

In this case, the expert's performance was about the cause of the damage, not the tax fraud. So the expert's performance wasn't the defense. Therefore, the character evidence about the engineer's honesty is admissible.

But wait, there's another rule about witness testimony about the expert's character. If the witness is a friend, the testimony is not admissible unless the friend is willing to testify, which isn't the case here. So the witness's testimony about his own honesty is admissible as character evidence.

So the witness's testimony about (1) the engineer's character and (2) his neighbors' descriptions is admissible. But in this case, the witness is trying to add character evidence. So both portions are admissible, but only as they relate to the engineer's character.

So looking back at the options:

Option C says both portions are admissible, but only as they relate to the engineer's truthfulness, not his expertise. Wait, that's not right. If the witness's testimony about the engineer's character is admissible, then both parts are admissible. But wait, the witness is trying to add character evidence about the engineer's honesty, not his performance.

Alternatively, I think the rule is that character evidence is admissible in the form of a statement that relates to the expert's character, regardless of whether it's about the performance or not. So in this case, the expert's character (truthfulness) is in the form of the witness's testimony about it, so that's admissible.

So the witness's testimony is admissible, both statements (1 and 2). So option C is saying both are admissible as character evidence, not about the expert's performance. So that would be correct.

Alternatively, let me think about whether the neighbors' comments are hearsay. Hearsay is anything that is not part of the transaction and comes from an outside source. The neighbors' descriptions are relevant to the expert's testimony but are hearsay, so they can't be used by the expert. But the witness is adding testimony about the engineer's character, which is a statement from the witness. So the witness's testimony about the neighbor's character is hearsay? Or is it hearsay?

Wait, the neighbor's descriptions are hearsay because they are from an outside source. But the witness is adding a statement about the engineer's character. So the witness's testimony about the neighbor's character is not hearsay because it's a statement from the witness. So it's admissible as character evidence.

So the witness can testify about the engineer's character and the neighbor's character. So both statements are admissible.

Therefore, the answer is C: Both portions of the testimony are admissible, but only as they relate to the engineer's truthfulness, not his expertise.

Wait, but let me check the options.

Option C says: Both portions are admissible, but only as they relate to the engineer's truthfulness, not his expertise.

Wait, that's not correct. Because the witness's testimony is about the engineer's character, which is admissible regardless of whether it's about his performance or not.

So none of the testimony is admissible except the part about character, which is admissible. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The expert's testimony is about the cause of the damage, not about the engineer's character. The witness is adding character evidence about the engineer's honesty. Since the expert's performance wasn't the defense, the character evidence is admissible. But the witness is also adding their own character, so the testimony is about the engineer's character (as a witness) and about the neighbors' character (as an outside witness). So both are admissible.

So the correct option is C: Both portions are admissible, but only as they relate to the engineer's truthfulness, not his expertise.

Wait, no. Because the witness is adding testimony about the engineer's character, which is a statement from the witness, so that's admissible regardless of the expert's performance.

So the answer would be C: Both portions of the testimony are admissible, but only as they relate to the engineer's truthfulness, not his expertise.

Wait, no. Because the engineer's performance was about the cause of the damage, not the tax fraud. So the expert's testimony doesn't relate to the tax fraud. So the character evidence is admissible because it's about the engineer's character, regardless of whether the expert's performance was the defense.

So the correct answer is C.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of a witness's testimony regarding an engineer's character and the neighbors' descriptions. The evidence in question is admissible under Rule 106(b), which allows character evidence if it relates to the expert's character, provided the expert's performance was not the defense. In this case, the expert's performance (the cause of the damage) was not the defense, so character evidence about the engineer's honesty is admissible. Additionally, the witness's own testimony about character is admissible as it relates to the engineer's character. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Both portions of the testimony are admissible, but only as they relate to the engineer's truthfulness, not his expertise.**
