Okay, so I've got this question about an atom and the number of electrons it has. Let's see what I remember about atoms and electron configurations.

The question says that the atom has filled n=1 and n=2 levels. I think n refers to the principal quantum number, which determines the energy level of electrons. Each level can hold a certain number of electrons based on the formula 2*(2n+1). 

Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the maximum number of electrons in each shell is given by 2n². So for n=1, the first shell can hold 2*(1)^2=2 electrons. For n=2, the second shell holds 2*(2)^2=8 electrons. But wait, wait, no— that's the maximum, not the filled state. Because the atom isn't just filling all shells up to n=2 yet; it's filled up to n=2 and n=1.

Wait no, the question says the atom has filled n=1 and n=2 levels. Oh, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The atom has all electrons in the n=1 and n=2 shells. So for the first shell (n=1), it's filled. The second shell (n=2) is also filled. 

So for the first shell, n=1, the maximum electrons are 2*(1)^2=2. Hold on, wait no: The formula is 2*(n^2). But wait, no, wait. The maximum number is 2n². So for n=1, 2*(1)^2 = 2. So that's 2 electrons there. For n=2, 2*(2)^2 =8. So 8 electrons in the second shell.

Then total electrons would be 2+8=10. Wait, but wait— wait, wait a second. Because when you have multiple shells, each shell is filled in order. So the first shell is n=1, then n=2, etc. So for n=1, 2 electrons. n=2, 8. So total electrons would be 2+8=10? That's option F.

Wait, but hold on. I'm a bit confused because sometimes the formula for the maximum number of electrons in the nth shell is 2(2n+1). But that's the capacity for each subshell. Oh, but wait, no. It's the maximum number of electrons in a shell, regardless of subshells. So each shell can hold up to 2n² electrons. So yes, n=1 holds 2, n=2 holds 8. So total 10 electrons.

But wait, wait— wait. Wait another thought: the question says filled n=1 and n=2 levels. So all electrons in these shells are present. So the first (n=1) and second (n=2) are filled, so 2+8=10 electrons.

Looking at the options: F is 10. So the correct answer should be F.

The question asks for the total number of electrons in an atom that has filled n=1 and n=2 levels. Each level n can hold a maximum of \(2n^2\) electrons, where n is the principal quantum number. For n=1, the first level holds \(2(1)^2 = 2\) electrons, and for n=2, the second level holds \(2(2)^2 = 8\) electrons. Adding these together, the total number of electrons is \(2 + 8 = 10\).

Thus, the correct answer is the option F, which corresponds to 10 electrons.
