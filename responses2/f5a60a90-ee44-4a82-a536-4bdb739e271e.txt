Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the U.S. House of Representatives structure. Let me try to think through each option carefully.

The question is asking which statement about the House of Representatives is true. The options are A, B, C, D. I remember that the U.S. Congress is divided into two houses: the House of Representatives and the Senate. 

Option A: "All revenue bills must originate in the Senate before moving to the House." Hmm, I think this is incorrect. From what I remember, revenue bills are passed by the House, not the Senate. The Senate typically handles other legislation, like laws on state and local services. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: "Representation in the House is allocated equally among the states, while representation in the Senate is allocated proportional to population." Wait, that doesn't sound right. I think both houses have representation based on population, but I might be mixing things up. Oh wait, actually, the House has equal representation, meaning each state has one representative, regardless of population. The Senate has proportional representation, so each state's number of representatives is based on the population. So B is incorrect because it's the opposite of what I remember.

Option C: "The Speaker of the House wields less power than the president pro tempore of the Senate." I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think the Speaker of the House is elected, and the president is the head of state. The Speaker has more power than the president, but pro tempore usually refers to the president's role as president, not the Speaker. So I think Option C is wrong because it's mixing up the roles.

Option D: "The House has a Committee on Ways and Means, while the Senate does not." Wait, the Senate doesn't have a committee on ways and means, right? The House does. The House has a Committee on Ways and Means, which is part of the Revenue unmarried Party (RWP), among others. The Senate doesn't have such a committee. So D is correct because the House does have this committee whereas the Senate doesn't.

Putting it all together, option D is the correct answer.

The correct answer is D: "The House has a Committee on Ways and Means, while the Senate does not." 

**Explanation:**
- Option A is incorrect because revenue bills are passed by the House, not the Senate.
- Option B is incorrect because both houses have proportional and equal representation, respectively, but they are based on different criteria.
- Option C is incorrect because the Speaker of the House has more power than the President, not the other way around.
- Option D is correct as the House has a Committee on Ways and Means, while the Senate does not. This committee is part of the House, and the Senate lacks one.
