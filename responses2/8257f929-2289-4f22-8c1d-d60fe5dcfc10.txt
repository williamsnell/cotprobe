Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a salesman for Filler Brush Company. Let me read it carefully.

The salesman is compensated based on his auto costs. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh, right, he's being compensated at a rate of 8 cents a mile. So that's his variable cost because it's per mile. His fixed costs are $500, and his variable cost is 5 cents a mile. The question is asking how many miles he needs to travel to break even, meaning he covers all his expenses without making a profit.

Hmm. Breaking even means that total revenue equals total costs. Total costs would be fixed costs plus variable costs. Revenue is the number of miles driven multiplied by the per-mile rate.

Let me write that down.

Let x be the number of miles driven.

Fixed costs = $500.

Variable cost per mile = $0.05.

So total cost (TC) = Fixed + (Variable * x) = 500 + 0.05x.

Revenue (R) = x miles * $0.08 per mile = 0.08x.

At break-even, Revenue equals Cost, so:

0.08x = 500 + 0.05x.

Let me solve for x.

Subtract 0.05x from both sides:

0.08x - 0.05x = 500.

0.03x = 500.

Now, divide both sides by 0.03:

x = 500 / 0.03.

Let me calculate that. 500 divided by 0.03. Hmm, 0.03 is 3/100, so dividing by that is multiplying by 100/3.

500 * (100/3) = (500 * 100) / 3 = 50,000 / 3 ≈ 16,666.666... miles.

Looking at the options, option F is 16,667 miles. That's the closest, so the answer should be F.

The break-even point is when total revenue equals total costs. Total costs are fixed ($500) plus variable costs (5¢ per mile). Revenue is 8¢ per mile.

Setting up the equation:

8x = 500 + 5x  
3x = 500  
x ≈ 16,666.67 miles.

The closest option is F: 16,667 miles.

Answer: F
