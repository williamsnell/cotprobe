Question:

John noticed that the angle formed by the minute hand and hour hand on a standard 12-hour clock was 110 degrees when he left home after 6 p.m.; it was also 110 degrees when he returned after 6 p.m. but before 7 p.m. that same night. If he left home for more than five minutes, for how many minutes was he away?

Options:

A: 41
B: 45
C: 35
D: 43
E: 37
F: 36
G: 42
H: 40
I: 38
J: 39

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this clock angle problem. Let's see. The question says John left home after 6 p.m., saw the minute and hour hands at 110 degrees, and came back before 7 p.m. that same night, and the angle was still 110 degrees. He left home for more than five minutes, and we need to find out how many minutes he was away. The options are A to J.

First, I need to figure out the possible times when the angle between the hour and minute hands is 110 degrees. I remember that the angle between the hands can be calculated using a formula. Let me recall the formula.

The formula for the angle between the hour and minute hands is |30H - 5.5M| degrees, where H is the hour and M is the minutes. Since it's a 12-hour clock, H would be 6 for both times he left and came back.

Wait, no, H is the hour, so when it's 6 p.m., it's 6 o'clock. So, the times during the night when the angle is 110 degrees could be either after 6 p.m. (so between 6:00 and 7:00) or maybe before 6 p.m. but that's probably not relevant here because John left after 6 p.m. and came back before 7 p.m. So, he left between 6:00 and 7:00, and came back at a time before 7:00.

Wait, but 6:00 and 7:00 are the same time on a 12-hour clock, just different times of the night. So, the times he left and returned are both between 6:00 and 7:00, but the angle is 110 degrees at both times.

I think the angle is the same when the hands are on opposite sides of the clock. So, there are two possible times when the angle is 110 degrees between 6:00 and 7:00.

Let me set up the equation. Using the formula:

Angle = |30H - 5.5M| = 110 degrees.

Since H is 6, plugging in:

|30*6 - 5.5M| = 110
|180 - 5.5M| = 110

This gives two cases:

1. 180 - 5.5M = 110
2. 180 - 5.5M = -110

Let's solve each.

Case 1: 180 -5.5M =110
Subtract 110: 70 =5.5M
M=70 /5.5= 12.7272... minutes.

Wait, 70/5.5 is 12 and 8/11 minutes, which is about 12.7272 minutes past 6.

So the time is approximately 6:12:43.6.

Case 2: 180 -5.5M = -110
180 +110 =5.5M
290=5.5M
M=290/5.5=52.7272... minutes.

So, 52.7272 minutes past 6, which is about 6:52:43.6.

Wait, but 52.7272 minutes is more than an hour, so that would be 7:52.7272, which is after 7 p.m., but John returned before 7 p.m. So that time can't be valid because if he was there between 6:12 and 6:53, and he returned before 7, then the angle would have changed. So perhaps only the first case applies, but wait, the time in the second case is beyond 7 p.m., so that's not acceptable. Oh, wait, but the problem says he left after 6 p.m., came back before 7 p.m. So the return time must be between 6 and 7. So the time in case 2 is 6:52.7272, which is 6:52 and 43.6 seconds, which is still between 6 and 7. So both times are between 6 and 7.

Wait, but in the second case, M is 52.7272, which is 52 minutes and about 43.6 seconds. So the times are 6:12:43.6 and 6:52:43.6.

So John left at one time and returned at the other. The time between the two is how long he was away.

So the difference in minutes between these two times is 52.7272 -12.7272 =40 minutes. Because 52.7272 minus 12.7272 is 40. So he was away for 40 minutes.

Looking at the options, H is 43 (D), I is 38, J is 39. Wait, but wait, 52.7272 minus 12.7272 is 40. So 40 minutes. That's option H, which is 40.

Wait, but let me double-check. The times are 12 and 52 minutes after 6. So 52 -12=40 minutes. So he was away for 40 minutes.

So the correct answer should be H, which is 40.

The angle between the hour and minute hands is 110 degrees at two times between 6:00 and 7:00. The times are approximately 6:12:43.6 and 6:52:43.6. The difference between these times is 40 minutes, so John was away for 40 minutes.

Answer: H
