Question:

A 20-year-old man has had frequent upper respiratory tract infections over the past 4 years. He has daily purulent sputum and has noted decreased exercise tolerance over the past 2 years. He and his wife have been unable to conceive because of his low sperm count. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?

Options:

A: Bronchoscopy
B: Examination of sputum for eosinophils
C: Sputum cytology
D: Sweat chloride test
E: Chest CT scan
F: Echocardiogram
G: Spirometry repeat test
H: Tuberculin skin test
I: Complete blood count
J: Arterial blood gas analysis

Okay, so I've got this question about a man with upper respiratory infections and some other issues. Let's break it down. The man is 20 and has had frequent upper respiratory tract infections for four years. He has daily purulent sputum, which makes me think he's been coughing up a lot, maybe with some secretions like mucus or fluid. He also notes decreased exercise tolerance over two years. That probably means he's fatigued or can't exercise as well, which could be related to his low sperm count.

His wife couldn't conceive because of his low sperm count. Wait, that's a concerning point. Sperm count is a critical factor in fertility. So if he can't conceive, maybe the sperm isn't working properly, which could be due to his condition. 

The symptoms here are scattered expiratory wheezing and rhinchi. I remember wheezing and rhinchi are signs of chronic cough or inflammation. So both his lungs are inflamed or have some infection.

The imaging shows hyperinflation, which in chest X-ray is a sign of lung inflammation. Then the spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. FEV1 is the volume of air expelled during a forced vital capacity, and FVC is the forced vital capacity. A decreased ratio might mean he's not breathing as effectively, maybe because of inflammation or infection.

The options are about how to test for the diagnosis. The question is which of these would confirm it.

Looking at the options:

A: Bronchoscopy - that's a check for lung inflammation, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). But wait, the question is about sputum, which is about secretions, not inflammation.

B: Sputum for eosinophils - Sputum looks for secretions, but finding eosinophils might indicate infection, like a chronic cough or something. But does that confirm the cause? Maybe, but I'm not sure.

C: Sputum cytology - this would look for specific kinds of cells, like B cells or macrophages, which could indicate inflammation or infection. But since he's had sputum, maybe that's part of the condition, but I'm not sure if this is the most direct test.

D: Sweat chloride test - this is used to detect infections, like strep throat. Since he has wheezing and rhinchi, maybe he has a bacterial infection. But if it's a viral infection, I'm not sure.

E: Chest CT scan - CT can show lung structures and maybe inflammation. But would it confirm the diagnosis? Maybe, but again, what's the main thing here.

F: Echocardiogram - That's about heart function, not directly related to the symptoms here.

G: Spirometry repeat test - If spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC, that could indicate some kind of lung disease, like COPD, which is characterized by reduced airflow.

H: Tuberculin skin test - Used to detect bacterial infections on the skin, like strep. If he has wheezing, maybe it's something more.

I: Complete blood count - Not directly related to the symptoms, unless it's a negative result, but the question says he has a low sperm count, so maybe he's not healthy overall.

J: Arterial blood gas analysis - This checks for specific gases in the blood, like oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc. Doesn't seem relevant here.

Wait, the main issues are inflammation (hyperinflation in X-ray) and a decreased FEV ratio. Maybe the sputum is a sign of something else, but the question is, what test confirms the diagnosis.

Looking again, the main symptom is his low sperm count. But his wife can't conceive, which is due to his condition. So the primary diagnosis is probably something related to his respiratory system, like COPD or something. The symptoms suggest chronic inflammation, so probably the test would be a chest X-ray, but the options don't include that. Wait, the options given don't have a chest X-ray, unless I'm missing something.

Wait, the options are: A: Bronchoscopy (chest), B: sputum for eosinophils (sputum), C: sputum cytology, D: sweat chloride, G: spirometry repeat.

If the question is about confirming the diagnosis, the main signs are scattered wheezing, rhinchi, and the FEV ratio. Wait, but the question is about confirming the diagnosis, which is probably COPD.

But the options don't have an X-ray. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: CT scan, which would look for any inclusions like lung inflammation or infection.

Wait, the question says the last character of the answer must be the letter chosen. So if the correct answer is E, the last letter is E.

Alternatively, the question is about confirming the diagnosis. Let me think again about the options. The options given don't include a chest X-ray, but option E is a CT scan. So if the sputum is present, maybe the CT would show any inflammation. But the options don't include a chest X-ray, which is the most direct test for COPD.

Wait, the question is looking for which test would confirm the diagnosis. So if the man has a history of sputum and a low sperm count, the primary issue is probably a chronic respiratory condition. The FEV/FVC ratio would suggest chronic lung disease.

Hmm, the question is about the cause. The symptoms are scattered wheezing and rhinchi, which suggests chronic inflammation. So perhaps the best test is a chest X-ray, but that's not an option. Alternatively, the best possible test given the options is E: chest CT scan, because it can show any lung issues, including inflammation.

Wait, but another thought: sputum cytology (option C) would look for specific cells, like macrophages, which could indicate inflammation. Sputum cytology could help determine whether it's a chronic infection or something else. But the question is about the diagnosis, which is likely more about inflammation.

So, considering all, the correct answer would likely be E: chest CT scan. But wait, option E is a CT scan. However, I'm recalling that chest X-ray is the gold standard for lung inflammation. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the best fit is E.

Wait, but the question is about which test confirms the diagnosis. If the man has a history of sputum and the FEV/FVC is low, the most direct test would be a chest X-ray. Since that's not an option, perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, if the sputum shows specific cells, then C is correct. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because even if the diagnosis is not exactly the same, the CT scan would show any possible issues. But I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the correct answer is E: chest CT scan. But the options don't include that. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the question again.

The options are A to J. The question is, which is most likely to confirm the diagnosis. The diagnosis is likely to be chronic inflammation, so the best test would be to see if there's any evidence of inflammation, like wheezing, which would suggest infection. So, the sputum cytology would look for specific cells that could indicate infection.

But the answer options are: E is a CT scan. Without a chest X-ray, I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the man's symptoms are scattered wheezing and rhinchi. If the sputum has low cells, maybe it's a bacterial infection. But if it's a chronic condition, the sputum wouldn't show low cells. So the best way to confirm the diagnosis is to see if there's any signs of inflammation or infection, which would be a CT scan showing any such findings.

But the options don't have a CT scan. Hmm. Wait, maybe the best possible option is E. So I think the correct answer is E.

The question involves a 20-year-old man with a history of frequent upper respiratory infections, daily sputum, decreased exercise tolerance, and a low sperm count. He cannot conceive due to his condition, and symptoms include scattered wheezing, rhinchi, and a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. The task is to determine which diagnostic test most likely confirms the diagnosis.

The options provided include:

- **A: Bronchoscopy**: This tests for lung inflammation, but it is not among the options.
- **B: Sputum for eosinophils**: This could indicate infection but is not the most direct test.
- **C: Sputum cytology**: This focuses on specific cell types and could show infection, but it is not the gold standard.
- **D: Sweat chloride test**: This detects infections, but the symptoms suggest a chronic condition.
- **E: Chest CT scan**: This can assess for inflammation or other lung abnormalities, making it a likely choice.
- **F: Echocardiogram**: Unrelated to the symptoms.
- **G: Spirometry repeat test**: Decreased FEV1:FVC could indicate chronic disease.
- **H: Tuberculin skin test**: Not relevant here.
- **I: Complete blood count**: Not directly related.
- **J: Arterial blood gas analysis**: Unrelated.

Given the symptoms and the need to confirm the diagnosis, a **chest CT scan (Option E)** is the most direct test to assess for inflammation or potential chronic disease. While sputum cytology (Option C) could provide more specific information about infection, the chest CT scan is the best fit among the options provided.

ANSWER: E
