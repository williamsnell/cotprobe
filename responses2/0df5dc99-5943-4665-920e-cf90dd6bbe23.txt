Okay, so I have this probability question here about convergence in probability and almost surely. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, so I'll take it slow.

The problem says: We have independent random variables X₂, X₃, and so on. Each Xₙ can take three values: n, -n, or 0. The probabilities are given as P(Xₙ = n) = 1/(2n log n), similarly for P(Xₙ = -n) and P(Xₙ = 0) is 1 - 1/(n log n). 

The question is asking about the convergence of the average (n^{-1} times the sum from i=2 to n of X_i) in probability and almost surely.

So, two parts: convergence in probability and almost sure convergence.

First, let's recall some convergence concepts. If a sequence of random variables converges in probability to a constant c, then for any ε > 0, the probability that the absolute difference between the random variable and c is greater than ε goes to zero as n approaches infinity. For almost sure convergence, it's similar but with probability 1.

I think we might need to use the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) or Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for this, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's start by looking at the individual terms and see if they satisfy the conditions for these theorems.

Looking at the variance of each Xₙ. Let's compute Var(Xₙ). 

Since each Xₙ can take values n, -n, or 0, the expectation E[Xₙ] is:

E[Xₙ] = n*(1/(2n log n)) + (-n)*(1/(2n log n)) + 0*(1 - 1/(n log n))
     = (n / (2n log n)) - (n / (2n log n)) + 0
     = 0.

So the mean is 0. That's good because if the mean is zero, the LLN might apply.

Now, the variance Var(Xₙ) = E[Xₙ²] - (E[Xₙ})². Since E[Xₙ}=0, Var(Xₙ) = E[Xₙ²].

E[Xₙ²] is n²*(1/(2n log n)) + (-n)^2*(1/(2n log n)) + 0²*(1 - 1/(n log n))
= (n²/(2n log n)) + (n²/(2n log n)) + 0
= (n/(2 log n)) + (n/(2 log n))
= n/(log n).

So Var(Xₙ) is n/(log n). Hmm, that's interesting because as n increases, the variance increases as well. Wait, but for the Law of Large Numbers, we need the variance to be bounded or to go to zero. Because if the variance doesn't go to zero, then the sample mean can't converge in probability to anything, right? Because if the variance is unbounded, then the sum's variance would be proportional to n, leading the average to have a variance of 1, which doesn't go to zero.

Wait, let me think more carefully. The Central Limit Theorem requires that the variance of each term is finite, but in this case, Var(Xₙ) is n/(log n), which grows as n increases. So the variance is not bounded, so CLT might not apply here. However, for the Law of Large Numbers, I think the necessary condition is that the variance of each term is finite, and that the average of these variances converges to zero.

Wait, let me recall that. The Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN) requires that the variance of the terms goes to zero as n increases. Alternatively, if the variance is bounded and the average of variances tends to zero, then the SLLN holds.

So in our case, Var(Xₙ) = n/(log n). What's the behavior as n approaches infinity? As n increases, log n grows, but n grows faster than log n. So n/(log n) tends to infinity. Therefore, the variance is not going to zero. So the conditions for SLLN aren't met here. Because if the variance doesn't go to zero, the sample mean won't converge almost surely or in probability to anything.

Wait, but even if that's the case, there's another approach. Maybe the sum of X_i's is zero on average, but since each term has a higher variance, the sum's standard deviation would be higher. But let's think about the sum divided by n. So, the average would be (n^{-1}) sum X_i.

The variance of the average would be Var(sum X_i)/n². But sum X_i has a variance of sum Var(X_i) = sum (n/(log n)).

So the variance of the average is (sum (n/(log n)) ) / n² = (sum (1/(n log n)) ) / n. Wait, no: the variance of the sum is sum Var(X_i), which is sum (n/(log n)), so the variance of the average is (sum (n/(log n)) ) / n² = sum (1/(n log n)) / n.

Wait, no, the variance of the sum is sum Var(X_i). So the variance of the average is (sum Var(X_i)) / n².

So let me compute sum Var(X_i) from i=2 to n.

Sum Var(X_i) = sum_{i=2}^n [i/(log i)].

So the variance of the average is [sum_{i=2}^n (i/(log i)) ] / n².

But as n increases, the sum from i=2 to n of i/(log i) is roughly on the order of n²/(2 log n) or something like that. Because the sum of 1/(log i) from i=2 to n is roughly n/(log n) (since the sum of 1/k is about log n). So the sum of i/(log i) would be approximately sum i / (log i) ≈ n²/(2 log n) (since each term is roughly proportional to i/(log i), and when summed from 2 to n, the largest term is about n/(log n), and there are n terms, so perhaps the sum is O(n²/(log n))).

So sum Var(X_i) is O(n²/(log n)), so the variance of the average is (O(n²/(log n))) / n²) = O(1/(log n)).

So as n approaches infinity, Var(average) = O(1/(log n)) → 0. So the variance of the average tends to zero.

Wait, that's a useful result. So, if the variance of the average goes to zero, then by the SLLN, the average converges almost surely to the expectation, which is zero.

Wait, but wait. The SLLN requires that the average of the variances tends to zero. Hmm. Wait, the SLLN conditions are that the individual variables have finite variance, and that the average of the variances tends to zero. So in our case, even though the variance of each X_i is growing with n, the sum of their variances is growing as well, but when we divide by n², the average's variance tends to zero.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The average of X_i's variance is sum Var(X_i) divided by n². So sum Var(X_i) = sum (i/(log i)) from i=2 to n, which is O(n²/(log n)) as I thought earlier. So when we divide by n², the average's variance is O(1/(log n)) → 0 as n→∞. So that means the average converges to zero almost surely.

Additionally, for convergence in probability, we can check the Law of Large Numbers. Since the variance of the average tends to zero, the average converges to the expectation (which is zero), so it also converges in probability to zero.

Wait, but wait. The convergence in probability requires that the probability that |average - 0| > ε approaches zero as n increases. If the variance of the average tends to zero, then yes, the probability of the average being far from zero should go to zero. So both in probability and almost surely, the average converges to zero.

Wait, but let me double-check the SLLN conditions. The SLLN applies when the average of the variances tends to zero. I think that's correct. Because if the average of the variances tends to zero, then the sample mean tends to the expectation.

So, putting it all together:

- The average of X_i's has a variance that tends to zero as n increases. So, the average converges almost surely to zero, and also in probability.

Wait, but wait. Another point: The convergence in probability. For convergence in probability, we can use Chebyshev's inequality. Since the variance of the average is O(1/(log n)), then for any ε>0, the probability that the average is more than ε away from zero is <= Var(average)/ε². As n→∞, this tends to zero. So, by Chebyshev, the average converges in probability to zero.

So both in probability and almost surely cases, the average converges to zero.

So the two answers for the two questions are [0,0]. Looking at the options, that's option F: [0,1]. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the two answers are for convergence in probability and almost surely. So the first part is convergence in probability: 0. The second part is almost sure: 0. So the list is [0,0]. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

F: [0, 1]

H: [1, 1]

Wait no, the options are options A through J. Let me check again.

Wait, options are:

A: [0.5, 0]

B: [1, 0]

C: [0, 0.5]

D: [0.5, 1]

E: [1, -1]

F: [0, 1]

G: [0.5, 0.5]

H: [1, 1]

I: [1, 0.5]

J: [0, 0]

Wait, the question says, 'Does n^{-1}sum_{i=2}^n X_i converge in probability? Does n^{-1}sum_{i=2}^n X_i converges in almost surely?'

So the two answers are in the order: first convergence in probability, second almost sure.

So if both converge to zero, the list is [0, 0], which is option J.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the average's variance tends to zero, so almost surely it converges. So it's 0 in both. So option J.
</think>

The problem involves determining whether the sequence of averages converges in probability and almost surely. Each Xₙ has a mean of 0 and a variance that grows as n increases. The sum of variances is analyzed, and it's found that the average of these variances tends to zero, indicating convergence in both probability and almost surely. Therefore, the correct answer is [0, 0], which corresponds to option J.

Answer: J: [0, 0]
