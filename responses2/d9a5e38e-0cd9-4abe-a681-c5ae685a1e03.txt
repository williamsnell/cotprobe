Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the inverse of the function f(x) = 4 - 5x. Hmm, I remember that an inverse function essentially undoes what the original function does. So, if f(x) gives me y, the inverse function, let's call it f⁻¹(y), should give me back x. 

Wait, but I think the question is asking for the inverse function in terms of x, not y. So, I need to solve for x in terms of y and then write it as a function of x. 

Let me start by writing the function as y = 4 -5x. To find the inverse, I need to switch x and y and then solve for y. So, swapping x and y gives me x = 4 -5y. Now, I have to solve this equation for y.

Subtracting 4 from both sides: x -4 = -5y. Then, divide both sides by -5: (x -4)/(-5) = y. Hmm, that simplifies to y = (4 -x)/5. Alternatively, I can write it as y = (-x +4)/5, which is the same as (4 -x)/5.

Looking back at the options, option A is (x-4)/5. That looks like it's the negative of what I have. Let me check my steps again. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign when solving for y. Let me go through it step by step.

Starting with y = 4 -5x. Swap x and y: x = 4 -5y. Subtract 4: x -4 = -5y. Divide by -5: (x-4)/(-5) = y. Which is the same as y = (4 -x)/5. Alternatively, (x-4)/(-5) is the same as -(x-4)/5, which is (4 -x)/5. So, that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (x-4)/5, which is positive (x-4) over 5. Comparing to what I have, which is (4 -x)/5, that's the same as -(x-4)/5. So, option A would actually be negative of the correct answer. 

Wait, but looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when switching variables. Let me check: original function is f(x) = 4 -5x. So, if I have y = 4 -5x, then the inverse function f⁻¹(y) would be such that y = 4 -5x. So, to solve for x in terms of y: 

y = 4 -5x  
=> y -4 = -5x  
=> x = (4 - y)/5

Wait, that's the same as (4 - y)/5. So, if I write it as a function of x, it's x = (4 - y)/5, which would be the inverse function. So, f⁻¹(x) = (4 -x)/5, which is the same as -(x-4)/5.

Looking at the options again, option A is (x-4)/5, which is the opposite of what I have. Option F is - (x -4)/5, which is exactly what I derived. So, option F is the correct inverse function.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Another approach: maybe I can test with a value. Let's pick x=0. f(0)=4-5(0)=4. So, f(0)=4. So, the inverse function should take 4 and give back 0. Let's plug into each option:

Option A: (0-4)/5 = (-4)/5 = -0.8. Not 0. So A is wrong.

Option F: - (0 -4)/5 = -(-4)/5 = 4/5=0.8. Hmm, but I expected f⁻¹(4) to be 0. So that's not matching. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, x=0 gives f(x)=4, so f⁻¹(4) should be 0. Let me compute each option at y=4:

Option F: - (4 -4)/5 = 0/5=0. That's correct. So, option F gives 0 when y=4.

Wait, but when y=4, f⁻¹(y) should be x=0, which it is. But wait, let me think again. If f(x)=4-5x, then f⁻¹(y)= (4 - y)/5, which is the same as 4/5 - y/5. Let's evaluate f⁻¹(4): (4-4)/5=0. And f⁻¹(0)= (4-0)/5=4/5. So, when y is 0, x should be 4/5, which is correct.

Wait, but if I plug y=4 into option F: y=4, F gives f⁻¹(4)= - (4-4)/5=0. That's correct. So option F works for y=4. Hmm, but earlier when I wrote f⁻¹(x)= (4 -x)/5, which is the same as - (x-4)/5, so that's option F.

But wait, let me double-check the algebra. When I started with y =4 -5x, I solved for x:

y =4 -5x  
y -4 = -5x  
x = (4 - y)/5  
So, f⁻¹(y)= (4 - y)/5, which is same as (4 -x)/5 when written in terms of x. So, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option F is - (x -4)/5. Which is the same as (-x +4)/5, or (4 -x)/5. So, that's exactly what I have. So, option F is the inverse.

Wait, but wait a second. My earlier calculation when I swapped x and y and solved for y gave me x = (4 - y)/5, which would be f⁻¹(x) = (4 -x)/5. So, that's correct.

But why did I think I had an error when plugging in y=4? Because when I plug in y=4, I get x=0, which is correct. So, perhaps I didn't have to check that, but it's a good way to confirm.

So, the correct inverse function is (4 -x)/5, which is the same as -(x -4)/5. Looking at the options, that's option F.

To find the inverse of the function \( f(x) = 4 - 5x \), we start by expressing the function as \( y = 4 - 5x \). To find the inverse, we swap \( x \) and \( y \) and solve for \( y \):

1. Start with \( y = 4 - 5x \).
2. Swap \( x \) and \( y \): \( x = 4 - 5y \).
3. Solve for \( y \): 
   \[
   x = 4 - 5y \implies x - 4 = -5y \implies y = \frac{4 - x}{5} = \frac{4 - x}{5}
   \]
4. Simplify to get \( y = \frac{4 - x}{5} \), which can be rewritten as \( y = -\frac{x - 4}{5} \).

Looking at the options, the correct inverse function is \( -\frac{x - 4}{5} \), which corresponds to option F.
