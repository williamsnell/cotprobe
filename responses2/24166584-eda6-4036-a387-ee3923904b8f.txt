Okay, so I've got this question about Boolean expressions and completeness. Hmm, the question is asking which of the given sets of Boolean operators is NOT complete. Let's think through each option one by one.

First, I remember that a set of Boolean operators is complete if it can express all possible Boolean expressions. So, which of these sets can't do that?

Option A: {NAND}. Wait, I think I've heard that NAND is a universal gate. Because NAND can be used to construct any Boolean function, right? So, that should make this set complete. So A is complete.

Option B: {NOT, NAND}. Oh, that's a classic. Because with NOT and NAND, you can also get OR. Because NOT is just negation, and NAND can create OR. So {NOT, NAND} should also be complete.

Option C: {AND, OR}. Hmm, wait. Do these two alone make a complete set? Because I'm trying to recall. I remember that with AND and OR, you can't create NOT. For example, you can't create a NOT gate using just AND and OR. But wait, what about when you have NAND or NOR? If you have both, can you make NOT? Oh wait, AND and OR are both logical operations, but they can't create NOT. So, perhaps without NOT, this set isn't complete. Wait, but the question is which set is NOT complete. So if this set can't express NOT, then it's incomplete.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If the set is {AND, OR}, can you create NOT? Because with just AND and OR, you can't. So without a NOT, you can't express some functions. So the set {AND, OR} would be incomplete because it can't express NOT. So that would make C the answer? Or wait, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, no, another approach: another way to determine if a set is complete is to see if the set includes all necessary operations. So, is {AND, OR} a complete basis? Or is it just a generating set?

Wait, the set {AND, OR} is not complete because you can't express NOT. But wait, could you make NOT using AND and OR? No, because if you have a function that is a constant true or false, like A AND A (which is A), but that doesn't give NOT. So, without NOT, you can't express NOT, so the set {AND, OR} is incomplete.

But wait, wait. I'm a bit confused now. Let me think about other possibilities. Another way: the set {NAND} is complete because NAND is a universal gate, so A is complete.

Option D: {NOT, OR}. Oh, wait, this is a complete set because with NOT and OR, you can express AND. Because (A OR B) AND (NOT A OR NOT B) is equivalent to A AND B. So, D is complete.

Option E: {XOR, NOT}. Wait, I remember that XOR and NOT can't express all functions. Or wait, is that true? Wait, no, actually, I think XOR along with NOT can express all other operations. Because I believe that with XOR and NOT, you can create any Boolean function. Let me think: for example, NOT A is just NOT A. OR can be expressed as (A XOR (NOT A AND B)) OR B, but maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps XOR alone isn't enough, but with XOR and NOT, you can create all other operations. So, let's see: can you make NOT? Yes, because you have NOT already. Can you make AND? Let me think: A AND B can be expressed as (A XOR B) XOR (A XOR C), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that without NOT, but I think that with XOR and NOT, you can create all other operations. So, {XOR, NOT} is complete. So E is complete.

Option F: {AND, NOT}. This is a classic complete set. Because you can build OR using De Morgan's laws. For example, A OR B is equivalent to NOT (NOT A AND NOT B). So, that's expressible with AND and NOT. So that's complete.

Option G: {OR, NOR}. Hmm, these two can't express NOT. Because OR is a disjunction and NOR is a negation of OR. Let's see: with OR and NOT, you can create all other operations. Wait, but without NOT, can you create NOT? No, but if you have OR and NOR, perhaps you can create NOT by using OR with both inputs being the same. For example, A OR A is just A. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, if you have a function that's always true except when both are true, perhaps. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the set {OR, NOT} is complete. So without NOT, the set {OR, NOR} is incomplete because without NOT, you can't create NOT, and without NOT you can't create AND or OR. So, for example, you can't create NOT A. So if the set is {OR, NOR}, can you express NOT?

Wait, let's think: OR is A ∨ B, NOR is ¬(A ∨ B). But to get NOT A, you can use A OR A (which is A), but that doesn't help. Or, wait: A OR A is A, so that doesn't help. Alternatively, if you have OR and NOT, you can create AND. But without NOT, you can't create NOT, so with OR and NOT you can express everything. So the set {OR, NOT} is complete, but {OR, NOR} is not, because you can't get NOT. So the set {OR, NOR} is incomplete.

But wait, the question is which set is NOT complete. So if the set includes OR and NOR, but can't express NOT, then that set is incomplete. So let's check each option:

Looking at the options, option G is {OR, NOR}. So, if this set can't express NOT, then it's incomplete. So G is the answer.

Wait, but wait again. Another approach: the set {AND, OR} is not complete. Because without NOT, you can't express NOT. So, the answer could be C or G. Let's reevaluate.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's think again. The question is which is NOT complete.

So option G is {OR, NOR}. Let's see if this set is complete.

NOR is equivalent to NOT (A OR B). But wait, without NOT, can we get NOT A? Because if we have only OR and NOR, is that possible?

Wait, let's think: using only OR and NOR.

NOR is equivalent to NOT (A OR B).

But can we get NOT A? Let's see. If we have OR and NOT, we can get NOT A, but without NOT, can we get it? Hmm.

Wait, for example, suppose we have A and B. Can we get NOT (A AND B) using OR and NOR? Let's see:

OR is A | B.

NOR is NOT (A | B).

But without NOT, we can't get the negation. So without NOT, perhaps the set {OR, NOR} can't express NOT. So with OR and NOR, can you create NOT?

Wait, because if you have A and B, and you have OR, which is A | B, and you have OR of both, which is A | B | A | B, which is just A | B. So that doesn't really help.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps using De Morgan's laws, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: to create NOT A, perhaps you can do something like A OR A? That's A, but that doesn't help. Or A | A | A, which is still A.

Wait, perhaps using De Morgan's laws, but without NOT, it's tricky. So perhaps the set {OR, NOR} is incomplete because it can't express NOT.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe {OR, NOT} is complete, so {OR, NOR} isn't because it's equivalent to {OR, NOT} but without the NOT. So {OR, NOR} is not complete because you can't express NOT.

Wait, but let me think again. The set {OR, AND} is complete. But what about {OR, NOT}? That's complete. So if a set doesn't include all the necessary operations, it's incomplete.

So, if G is {OR, NOR}, is that a complete set? Because with OR and NOT, you can create all operations. But without NOT, you can't. But since {OR, NOR} is the same as {OR, NOT}, because OR and NOT are the same as OR and (something). Wait, no, OR and NOT are different. So, if you have OR and NOT, you can express everything. But if you have OR and only NOR (which is equivalent to NOT OR), then you can't express NOT. So, the set {OR, NOR} isn't complete because you can't express NOT.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think of a concrete example. Let's say I have A and B. Can I get NOT A using OR and NOR?

Let's see: Let's assume that I have OR and NOR. So I can do A | B (which is A OR B), and (A | B) | (A | B) (which is A OR B OR A OR B, which is just A OR B).

But how to get NOT A? Well, if I can somehow get an expression that is always true except when A is true. Hmm. Maybe using De Morgan's laws.

Wait, another approach: the set {OR, NOT} is complete. So if I have OR and NOT, I can create all other operations. So, in the set {OR, NOR}, since OR and NOT are equivalent (because OR is the same as A OR B, and NOT A is the same as A | A), so OR and NOT are sufficient. So, {OR, NOR} is complete because you can express NOT.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think: with OR and NOT, any Boolean expression can be represented. So, if the set is {OR, NOT}, which is equivalent to {OR, AND}, wait no, because NOT is a different operator.

Wait, OR and NOT can be used to create NOT A, but OR and NOT is not the same as AND. So, if the set is {OR, NOT}, then it's sufficient to express any Boolean function. So, {OR, NOR} (same as {OR, NOT}) is complete. So, option G is complete. So it's not the answer.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT complete. So perhaps the correct answer is G: {OR, NOR} is NOT complete.

Wait, but earlier I thought that {OR, AND} is complete, but with {OR, AND}, you can't express NOT, so it's incomplete. But {OR, NOT} is complete. So perhaps the set {OR, AND} is incomplete, but the set {OR, OR} (which is just OR) is not sufficient.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me list out the options again.

The options are:

A: {NAND} → complete (NAND is universal, so A is complete).

B: {NOT, NAND} → complete (because you can create AND, OR, etc.), so B is complete.

C: {AND, OR} → incomplete. Because without NOT, you can't express NOT, so you can't create all Boolean functions. So C is not complete.

Wait, but I thought earlier that {AND, OR} are not sufficient to represent all functions. So, the set C would be the answer. Because without NOT, you can't express NOT, so you can't express all functions. So C is not complete.

But wait, wait another thought. Let me think: the set {AND, OR} can't express NOT. So without NOT, you can't express all functions. So that's correct. So the answer would be C: {AND, OR}.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Let me double-check.

Another approach: let's see if each set can express all possible functions, or if they can't.

For each option:

A: {NAND} → yes, because NAND is universal.

B: {NOT, NAND} → yes, because you can create AND, OR, etc.

C: {AND, OR} → can you create NOT? No, because without NOT, you can't create expressions that require it. So without NOT, you can't create, for example, the expression A NOT A (which is False), but you can't express that. So the set {AND, OR} can't express all functions. So C is not complete.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT complete. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the other options.

Option D: {NOT, OR} → can express all functions because you can create AND with De Morgan's laws: (A OR B) AND (NOT A OR NOT B) is equivalent to A AND B.

Option E: {XOR, NOT} → can express all functions. Because for example, you can create NOT via XOR with itself, but I think that's not correct. Wait, XOR is A XOR B. So, if A and B are the same, then A XOR B is false. But wait, no, because XOR is true only when the inputs are different. So if you have A and A, A XOR A is false. But how to get NOT A?

Wait, perhaps using XOR and NOT. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: with XOR and NOT, you can create OR and AND. Because:

A OR B is equivalent to (A XOR B) XOR (A AND B). Not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, I think that with XOR and NOT, you can create all other operations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that with XOR and NOT, you can construct OR and AND. Let me see:

A OR B can be expressed as (A XOR B) XOR (A AND B). Not sure, perhaps a better way is to think that A XOR B equals NOT (A AND NOT B) OR (NOT A) AND B. Wait, that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to accept that {XOR, NOT} is complete, so E is complete.

Option F: {AND, NOT} → complete.

Option G: {OR, NOR} → can we express NOT? Let's see. Let's say we have A and B. Can we get NOT A? Well, OR and NOR are both OR. But wait, if I have OR and NOT, then I can get NOT A. But if I have only OR and NOR, which is equivalent to OR and NOT (because OR is the same as A | A, which is A, but that doesn't help. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things.

Alternatively, perhaps with OR and NOT, you can get all functions. But with OR and only NOR, can you get NOT?

Wait, for example: Let's say A and B are both true. Then, A OR B is true. But with only OR and NOT, you can get NOT A, which is false. But without NOT, I can't express that.

Wait, but if you have only OR and NOT, you can create all functions. So, {OR, NOT} is complete. But if the set is {OR, NOR}, which is the same as {OR, NOT}, then it's also complete. So G is complete.

Wait, but then the only option that is not complete is C: {AND, OR}.

Because without NOT, you can't create NOT, which is a fundamental operation. So, the set {AND, OR} is incomplete. So the correct answer is C.

To determine which set of Boolean operators is NOT complete, we analyze each option based on whether it can represent all possible Boolean expressions. A set is complete if it can express every Boolean function; if it cannot, it is incomplete.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: {NAND}**  
   NAND is a universal gate because it can be used to implement any Boolean function. Therefore, this set is complete.

2. **Option B: {NOT, NAND}**  
   With NOT and NAND, you can express all Boolean functions. For example, NAND can be used to create AND, OR, and other operations. Thus, this set is complete.

3. **Option C: {AND, OR}**  
   The set {AND, OR} is incomplete because it cannot express NOT. Without NOT, you cannot create expressions that require negation, such as ¬A. Therefore, this set is not complete.

4. **Option D: {NOT, OR}**  
   With NOT and OR, you can express all Boolean functions. For example, you can create AND using De Morgan's laws: (A OR B) AND (¬A OR ¬B) = A AND B. Thus, this set is complete.

5. **Option E: {XOR, NOT}**  
   The set {XOR, NOT} is complete because XOR and NOT can be used to express all Boolean functions. For example, you can create NOT, AND, OR, and other operations. Thus, this set is complete.

6. **Option F: {AND, NOT}**  
   The set {AND, NOT} is complete because you can express all Boolean functions using De Morgan's laws and other operations. Thus, this set is complete.

7. **Option G: {OR, NOR}**  
   The set {OR, NOR} is equivalent to {OR, NOT} because NOR is equivalent to NOT OR. Since {OR, NOT} is complete, {OR, NOR} is also complete. Thus, this set is complete.

### Conclusion:
The only set that is incomplete is **Option C: {AND, OR}**, as it cannot express NOT without additional operators.
