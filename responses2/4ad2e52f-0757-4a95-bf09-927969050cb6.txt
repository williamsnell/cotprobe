Okay, so I've got this question about titrating a weak base with a strong acid. Hmm, I remember that when you titrate a base with an acid, the pH changes in a specific way. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the setup is a weak base being titrated with a standard strong acid. Let's think about the pH changes during this process. A weak base will have some Kb, right? And the strong acid will have a concentration we can calculate based on the equivalence point.

When you start the titration, the solution contains the weak base. Since the base is weak, it doesn't dissociate completely. So the pH will be higher than 7 initially. As you add the strong acid (which is a strong monoprotic acid), it will react with the base. The reaction should be something like:

Base + Acid → Neutralization product (which would be the conjugate acid of the base) and water.

Wait, no, the exact reaction should be the base (B) reacting with H+ ions from the acid. So the base is B, and the acid is H+.

So the initial pH decreases as the acid is added because the base is neutralizing H+ ions. Wait, no. Wait, the weak base is being neutralized by H+ from the acid. So the number of moles of base decreases, the number of H+ increases.

But the weak base's pH is determined by its Kb. The initial pH will be higher than 7 because the base is present but not fully deprotonated. As the acid is added, the solution becomes more acidic. The pH should decrease as more H+ ions are neutralized.

Wait, but wait, the initial pH is higher than 7 because the base is present. So, when we start adding acid, the pH should decrease. Let me think about the titration curve.

The titration curve for a weak base and strong acid would have a certain shape. At the beginning, when a small amount of acid is added, the pH drops because the acid reacts with the weak base. But as more acid is added, the solution becomes more acidic. At the equivalence point, the pH should be determined by the salt formed, which is the conjugate acid of the base. Since the base is weak, its conjugate acid is strong? No, wait, the conjugate acid is strong only if the base is strong. But our base is weak, so its conjugate acid is weak as well.

Wait, no. The conjugate acid of a weak base is a weak acid. So at the equivalence point, the solution contains the conjugate acid (HA) of the base. So since the base is a weak base (B), the conjugate acid is weak (HA). So the pH at equivalence point should be higher than 7 because weak acids have pH greater than 7. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the conjugate acid of a weak base is a weak acid. So for example, if the base is NH3, the conjugate acid is NH4+ (ammonium). NH4+ is a weak acid (pKa around 9.25). So the solution at equivalence point would have NH4+ which is a weak acid, pH higher than 7. So the pH at equivalence point is above 7. But wait, wait, when a weak base is titrated with a strong acid, the equivalence point is at the point where moles of acid equal the moles of base. The salt formed is the conjugate acid of the base.

So at equivalence point, the pH is determined by the weak acid (the conjugate acid of the base). Since the conjugate acid is weak, its pH is higher than 7. So the solution becomes acidic (pH <7) at the equivalence point? Wait, no, wait. Wait, weak acids have pH greater than 7. So the solution at equivalence point is acidic (pH <7) or basic? Wait, no: conjugate acid of a weak base is a weak acid, so solution at equivalence point is acidic (pH <7) or basic (pH >7)?

Wait, no. Let me think about the pKa of the conjugate acid. Suppose the base is B with Kb = x. The conjugate acid HA has pKa = pKa = 14 - pKb. So if B is a weak base, its pKb is greater than 7 (since Kb is small). So pKa of HA is 14 - pKb. If pKb is say 5, then pKa is 9. So the conjugate acid is weak. So the solution at equivalence point is a weak acid, which has a pH above 7. So pH is higher than 7.

Wait, but in the titration, before equivalence point, the solution's pH is below 7. So when you add acid, the pH goes down. At equivalence point, it's pH above 7.

So, the question is about the initial and final changes.

Option E says: The pH of the solution gradually decreases throughout the experiment and the pH at the equivalence point is above 7. That would fit because initially, the pH is higher than 7 and decreases as the base is neutralized. But wait, wait, the initial point when adding the first drops of acid — does the pH immediately drop, or is it a gradual decrease?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about whether the pH decreases immediately or if it's a gradual shift. Suppose the weak base is B. Initially, the solution is B. When you add H+ from the strong acid, it starts neutralizing B. Since the base is weak, the reaction is:

B + H+ → BH+ + H2O

The formation of BH+ is a weak acid. So the solution has some concentration of BH+ which is a weak acid. Therefore, the solution is acidic (pH <7). So the initial pH is higher than 7, but as the acid is added, the BH+ is formed, which is a weak acid. So the pH decreases as more H+ is added.

Wait, but the reaction isn't complete. So initially, the solution is B, and as H+ is added, the pH decreases. So the initial pH is higher than 7, and as more acid is added, pH decreases.

Wait, but wait: when a weak base is titrated with a strong acid, the initial pH is higher than 7, and as you add acid, the pH decreases to the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, the solution is acidic (since we have the conjugate acid of the weak base), so pH <7. But wait, no, wait, no. Because the conjugate acid of a weak base is a weak acid. So solution is acidic, meaning pH <7.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think of an example. Take NH3. It's a weak base with Kb ≈1.8e-5. Its conjugate acid is NH4+ with pKa ~9.25. So at equivalence point, you have NH4+ solution, which is a weak acid, so pH >7. So the pH at equivalence point is above 7.

But wait, that's the conjugate acid, not the base. The conjugate acid is weak, so its solution is acidic (pH <7) or basic?

Wait, no, no. Wait, the conjugate acid of a weak base is a weak acid, which means it doesn't dissociate much. So in solution, it's mostly in its undissociated form (since weak acid). So the pH of the conjugate acid is less than 7. So the solution at equivalence point is acidic (pH <7).

In the initial stages, adding acid to a weak base causes the solution to become acidic (pH <7). So the pH decreases as the acid is added. But wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The initial pH is higher than 7 because the weak base isn't fully protonated. Then, as you add acid, the weak base is neutralized, and you get some of its conjugate acid, which is a weak acid. So the solution becomes more acidic. So the pH decreases as you add acid.

Wait, but wait, the initial pH is higher than 7 (weak base). As you add H+, the pH decreases. So the initial pH is higher, and it decreases as you add acid.

But wait, the question is about the progress of the titration. So the initial pH is higher than 7, and as you add H+, the pH decreases. At the equivalence point, the pH is below 7 (since solution is a weak acid, NH4+).

But wait, another point: the equivalence point. When exactly does the pH equal 7? That's when the solution is neutral. So in the titration, the pH is above 7 when you're adding acid before equivalence point, and below 7 after.

So the pH decreases initially, reaches equivalence point, and then continues to drop to below 7. Wait, no. Because after equivalence, you have excess acid? No, wait, wait, no. The equivalence point is the point where moles of acid equals moles of base. So beyond that, you can't add more acid without the base being in excess.

Wait, no. Let me think. Wait, in the titration of a weak base with a strong acid, the equivalence point is when the moles of acid added equal the moles of the weak base. The solution at equivalence point is the salt of the weak base and the strong acid.

So, the pH at equivalence point is determined by the conjugate acid of the weak base, which is a weak acid, so its pH is above 7. So the pH is higher than 7.

Wait, but the initial pH is higher than 7, and as you add acid, the pH decreases. Wait, no, because the weak base is not completely neutralized. So in the beginning, adding acid makes the solution more acidic. So the pH decreases as you add acid. But then, once all the base is neutralized, you have a solution of the conjugate acid of the base. Since the conjugate acid is a weak acid, the solution is acidic, so pH <7. So the pH goes from higher than 7, decreases to 7? Wait, no, because equivalence point is at pH determined by the conjugate acid.

Wait, let me clarify. Let's say the weak base is B, with a pKb of Kb. The conjugate acid of B is BH+, which has pKa = 14 - pKb.

At equivalence point, the solution is a solution of BH+. Since BH+ is a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate much, so [H+] is high, so pH is low (so pH <7).

Wait, but the initial pH is higher than 7. So the pH starts at pH >7, decreases as you add acid, and reaches a point where it's pH equal to 7. But wait, wait. No, because after equivalence point, you can't add more acid without the base being in excess. So the pH would actually be determined by the excess base or the excess acid, but that's not the case here.

Wait, no. The equivalence point is when moles of acid equal moles of base. So beyond that, you would have excess acid. Wait, but in this titration scenario, you're adding a strong acid to a weak base. So beyond equivalence point, you have excess H+ from the strong acid. So the pH would increase.

Wait, but wait, wait! The equivalence point is at a certain pH, but beyond that, you have excess strong acid. So the pH would go above 7, right? Because the solution would be acidic, so pH <7.

Wait, so the pH curve would be like this: starts at high pH, decreases to equivalence point, and then increases again beyond equivalence.

But wait, the options are about what happens during the titration. So when the titration is ongoing, i.e., before the equivalence point, pH decreases as the acid is added.

Wait, but the options presented are all about the progress of titration. So the question is, what's the correct observation about the pH changes?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Initially, pH decreases, then gradual decrease to equivalence point, pH at equivalence is pOH = pKb.

Wait, no. Option A says the pH quickly decreases, then a gradual decrease to equivalence point where pOH equals pKb.

Hmm, pKb is the base's pK. So the pH at equivalence point would be pH = pOH = pKb? No, because at equivalence point, the solution is a salt of the weak base and strong acid. The pH would depend on the strength of the conjugate acid.

Wait, let me think about pH at equivalence point again. The solution is the salt of a weak base and a strong acid. So if the base is B (weak) and the acid is HA (strong), the solution would be A- (conjugate base of the strong acid), right?

Wait, no. The strong acid is HA (like HCl). The base is B (like NH3). The titration is B + H+ → BH+ + H2O. At equivalence point, you have BH+ and A-? Wait, no. Wait, the strong acid is HCl. When you add HCl to NH3, you get NH4Cl. So the solution is NH4+ and Cl-.

NH4+ is the conjugate acid of NH3. So the solution is NH4+ and Cl-.

NH4+ is a weak acid (since NH3 is a weak base). So NH4+ is a weak acid, which has a pH <7. So at equivalence point, the pH is below 7.

Wait, but the pH at equivalence point would depend on the strength of the conjugate acid. So if the conjugate acid is strong (like HCl), then the pH would be neutral. Otherwise, if it's weak (like NH4+), pH would be lower.

Wait, but in our case, the strong acid is HCl. So after the equivalence point, you have excess H+. So the pH would rise. So the pH at equivalence point is determined by the excess H+.

Wait, no. The pH at equivalence point is the pH of the solution after adding excess strong acid. So, in the titration of NH3 with HCl, after the equivalence point, you have excess H+.

But wait, the equivalence point is when the moles of HCl added equal the moles of NH3. So in that case, the solution is neutral (pH 7), but that's only if the acid is strong enough to neutralize all the base. If the acid is strong, the pH would be 7 exactly at equivalence point. But in our case, the acid is strong, but the base is weak. So the equivalence point is when you've added enough H+ to neutralize all the base.

Wait, but the conjugate acid of the weak base is a weak acid, so in the solution, the concentration of H+ comes from both the weak acid (BH+) and the excess strong acid.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

When titrating a weak base with a strong acid, the reaction is:

Base (B) + H+ → BH+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, moles of H+ added are equal to moles of B.

So the solution contains BH+ (conjugate acid of B) and any excess H+ from the strong acid.

So the solution's pH at equivalence point is determined by the concentration of H+ from BH+ and excess H+.

But BH+ is a weak acid. So the solution will have some [H+] from the weak acid, and some from the strong acid.

If the strong acid is strong (like HCl), and you have, say, 0.1 mol in 1 L, then the initial pH is determined by the weak acid.

So the solution would have more H+ from the weak acid than from the strong acid, making the pH <7.

Wait, but after equivalence point, adding more H+ would increase the pH. So the pH at equivalence point is pH <7, as the solution is more acidic than neutral.

Wait, but in the options, looking for things like pH equal to 7. So let me check the options.

Looking at option E: Initially, pH decreases, then another decrease to reach equivalence point with pH equal to 7.

Wait, but my conclusion is that at equivalence point, the pH is below 7. So option E would describe a pH of 7 at equivalence point, which doesn't seem correct unless the strong acid is strong enough to neutralize the weak base completely. But in the question, it's a strong acid titrated with a weak base, so the equivalence point is where the strong acid meets the weak base. So the solution is acidic (pH <7), but not necessarily neutral.

Wait, or wait, when the strong acid is in excess, the solution's pH would be higher (more H+). But in the titration curve, after the equivalence point, the pH starts to rise again.

So the titration curve is:

- Starts with a weak base, pH >7.
- As H+ is added, pH decreases.
- At equivalence point, pH = pOH (no, wait, no. At equivalence point, the pH is determined by the salt formed, which is a weak acid, so pH <7. So the pH at equivalence point is below 7, not equal to 7. So the option that says pH equals 7 at equivalence point would be incorrect.

Wait, so looking at the options, option E says pH equals 7 at equivalence point. That's wrong. So the correct option is E? No, because E says the pH is equal to 7 at equivalence point. But our analysis shows the pH is below 7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, the equivalence point is where moles of acid equal moles of base. The solution is a solution of the conjugate acid of the base. Since the base is weak, the conjugate acid is weak, so the solution is acidic (pH <7). So the pH at equivalence point is below 7.

So the option that says pH equals 7 at equivalence point (option E) is incorrect. So the correct option would have pH below 7 at equivalence point.

Looking at the options again:

A: pH decreases initially, then gradual decrease to equivalence point where pOH equals pKb.

Wait, pKb is the base's pK. So at equivalence point, the pH is determined by the salt (conjugate acid). So whether the equivalence point's pH is equal to pOH?

Wait, the salt's pH is pH = pKa of the conjugate acid. Since the conjugate acid is weak, pKa is higher than pKw (but wait, no, the conjugate acid is a weak acid, so its pKa is higher than 7, so pH is <7).

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck because I'm getting conflicting information from the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH at equivalence point is determined by the salt formed. The salt is the conjugate acid of the weak base. So the pH at equivalence point is pH <7.

So the correct option would be the one that describes the pH at equivalence point being below 7.

Looking at the options:

Option E: pH at equivalence point equals 7.

Option C: pH at equivalence point equals pKb.

Hmm. Since at equivalence point, the pH is determined by the conjugate acid of B. Since B is a weak base, the conjugate acid is a weak acid. So the pH is <7. So option E is incorrect.

Wait, but wait. If the conjugate acid is a strong acid, then the pH would be 7. But in our case, the conjugate acid is a weak acid. So the pH is below 7.

So the correct option must reflect that. Let me look again.

Option E: Initially, pH decreases, then decreases to equivalence point where pH equals 7. That would be incorrect because at equivalence point, pH is below 7.

Option B: pH initially decreases, then increases. No, because the pH decreases until equivalence point, then increases.

Wait, but the titration curve is initially decreasing, then reaches equivalence point, then starts to increase again.

So, the pH at equivalence point is below 7. So the options that don't describe this are E.

Wait, but the question is about the progress of the titration. So the correct answer is the one that says during the titration, the pH decreases to the equivalence point where pH is below 7.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option E says the pH at equivalence point is 7. That's incorrect.

Wait, but in the titration, before equivalence point, the pH decreases. At equivalence point, the pH is below 7, so the curve is a V-shape, with the V pointing downward.

Wait, but the question is about the initial and final changes.

Option E: pH decreases throughout the experiment, and pH at equivalence point is 7.

Wait, no, that's incorrect because the pH at equivalence point is below 7.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake earlier, and the pH at equivalence point is 7. Let me think again.

Suppose I have a weak base and a strong acid. The strong acid is added until it neutralizes the weak base. At that point, the solution is a solution of the conjugate acid of the weak base. Since the conjugate acid is a weak acid, the solution is acidic (pH <7). So the pH at equivalence point is <7.

So the option that says the pH equals 7 at equivalence point (option E) is incorrect.

So, the correct option must have the pH at equivalence point <7.

Looking again at the options:

Option E: pH at equivalence point is 7 → incorrect.

Option D: pH decreases throughout, equivalence point pH is >7 → incorrect.

Option B: pH decreases, then increases → which can't be right, because initial pH is high, but in reality, the pH decreases as you add acid.

Wait, perhaps the initial pH is higher than 7, and as you add acid, pH decreases to the equivalence point. So the pH curve is a decreasing function until the equivalence point, then starts increasing.

So the correct observations during the titration would be that the pH decreases to the equivalence point. So the initial pH is higher than 7, and as you add acid, the pH decreases.

But looking at the options, which option reflects this?

Option A says: Initially, pH decreases, then there's a gradual decrease to equivalence point where pOH equals pKb.

Hmm, but pKb is the base's pK, which is the same as pK_a for the conjugate acid. Wait, but if the solution at equivalence point is the conjugate acid of the base, which has a pKa of 14 - pKb.

So the pH at equivalence point is determined by the conjugate acid.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: pH decreases initially, then another decrease to equivalence point, where pOH = pKb.

Wait, no, because the equivalence point is where the moles of acid equal the moles of base. The pH at equivalence point is determined by the salt formed, which is a weak acid. So the pH is <7.

Option B: pH decreases, then increases → No, because initial pH is high, and as you add acid, pH decreases; once you reach equivalence point, adding more acid would make pH higher.

So the correct option must say that the pH decreases to the equivalence point. So the correct option is the one that says the pH decreases and reaches equivalence point.

Looking again at the options:

Option A says: pH decreases, then another decrease to equivalence point, where pOH = pKb.

Wait, but the equivalence point is where pH is determined by the conjugate acid, which is a weak acid. So the pH at equivalence point is <7, but not equal to 7.

Option E says: pH decreases, then decreases to equivalence point where pH equals 7.

Which is incorrect because the pH doesn't equal 7 at equivalence point.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: the equivalence point is when the moles of acid equal moles of base. So the pH at equivalence point is determined by the concentration of H+ from the excess acid. But wait, that's not correct.

Wait, no. The equivalence point is when you've added enough acid to neutralize all the base. At that point, you have an excess of acid (since it's a strong acid), so the solution would be acidic (pH <7).

But some options describe the pH at equivalence point. Let me see the options again.

Option E: pH at equivalence point is 7 → incorrect.

Option C: pH at equivalence point equals pKb → is it correct?

Wait, pKb is the base's pK. At equivalence point, the pH is determined by the conjugate acid. So the pH is pH = pKa of the conjugate acid.

Since the conjugate acid is a weak acid, its pKa is 14 minus the base's pK. So pH is 14 - pKb.

But the pH at equivalence point is not equal to pKb. So option C is incorrect.

Option B: pH decreases, then increases → No, because the pH decreases as you add acid, reaches equivalence point, and then continues to rise.

So the correct option is the one that says the pH decreases, reaches equivalence point, and the pH at equivalence point is below 7.

Looking back at the options, E says pH equals 7 at equivalence point, which is incorrect. So the correct option is the one that doesn't say pH equals 7.

So the correct option is either A, B, C, or D.

Looking at option A: Initially, pH decreases, then another decrease to reach equivalence point, where pOH equals pKb.

Wait, pKb is the base's pK, and pOH is 14 - pH.

So if the pH at equivalence point equals pKb, then pH equals pKb, which would mean that pH + pKb = 14 → pH = pOH. So pH = pOH.

But wait, the equivalence point is at pH determined by the conjugate acid. So pH at equivalence point is determined by the conjugate acid. So pH equals pKa of the conjugate acid.

But pKb of the base is 14 - pKa of the conjugate acid. So pKa of conjugate acid is 14 - pKb.

So at equivalence point, pH equals 14 - pKb.

Which is not the same as pKb.

So option A is incorrect.

Option B: pH decreases, then increases. No, because the pH decreases to equivalence point, then increases.

Option C: pH decreases, then another decrease to equivalence point where pH equals pKb. No. Because pH equals pKb would be incorrect as pH is determined by the conjugate acid.

Option D: pH decreases, then increases. No, same reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I've got it wrong. Let me think.

Wait, what's the pH at equivalence point in a titration of a weak base with a strong acid?

At equivalence point, the solution is a solution of the conjugate acid of the weak base. Since the conjugate acid is a weak acid, the solution is acidic (pH <7). So the pH at equivalence point is below 7.

So the correct option is the one that correctly describes the pH changes.

Looking at the options again:

Option E: pH decreases, then decreases to 7.

Wait, no, that can't be right because pH can't decrease to 7 (it would be neutral) without the solution being neutral, but in our case, it's an acidic solution.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the pH curve.

The pH curve starts at a high pH (since the base is weak), as the solution is basic. As you add acid, the pH decreases. At equivalence point, the pH is determined by the conjugate acid, which is a weak acid (so pH <7). Then, beyond equivalence point, adding more acid would increase the pH (since it's a strong acid).

So the pH curve is: high pH → decreases to equivalence point → pH <7 → increases beyond.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Initially, pH decreases, then decreases to equivalence point where pH equals 7. → Incorrect.

Option A: Initially, pH decreases, then another decrease to reach equivalence point where pOH equals pKb. → pOH is 14 - pH. If pH equals pKb, then pOH = 14 - pKb. But pH is 14 - pKb, so pOH is 14 - (14 - pOH) → which leads to pOH = pOH. So that's correct. So pH equals pKb would be correct. So option A is correct?

Wait, no. Because the equivalence point's pH is determined by the conjugate acid, which is pH = 14 - pKa of conjugate acid. The conjugate acid's pKa is 14 - pKb. So pH at equivalence point is 14 - (14 - pKb) = pKb. So pH equals pKb at equivalence point.

Wait, that makes sense. So pH at equivalence point equals pKb.

So option A says: pH decreases, then another decrease to reach equivalence point where pOH equals pKb.

Wait, wait. At equivalence point, pOH is not equal to pKb. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. At equivalence point, pH equals pKb. So pOH equals 14 - pH = 14 - pKb.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify.

pH = pKb → pH = pKb.

pOH = 14 - pH = 14 - pKb.

So pOH is not equal to pKb. Wait, pOH is 14 - pH, which is 14 - pKb.

So option A says pOH equals pKb. But that's not correct. Because pOH is 14 - pH, which is 14 - pKb.

So option A's statement is incorrect. Because at equivalence point, pOH is 14 - pKb, not pKb.

So option A is incorrect.

Wait, but then what's the correct option?

Let me think again.

The correct pH curve is:

- High pH (basic) at beginning.

- As you add acid, pH decreases.

- At equivalence point, pH is determined by conjugate acid → pH = pKb.

- Beyond equivalence point, pH increases again.

So during the titration, the pH decreases to the equivalence point, and the pH at equivalence point is pKb.

So the correct option should describe this.

Looking at the options:

Which option says that? Let me recheck.

Option A: Initially, pH decreases, then another decrease to reach equivalence point, where pOH equals pKb.

No, because at equivalence point, pOH is 14 - pKb.

Only option C says pH at equivalence point equals pKb.

Option C: pH decreases, then another decrease to reach equivalence point where pH equals pKb.

Wait, no. The pH at equivalence point is pKb, but the option says 'pH equals pKb'.

So option C says pH equals pKb at equivalence point.

But according to our analysis, the pH at equivalence point is pKb. So option C is correct.

Wait, but I thought pH equals pKb would be correct. So option C is correct.

Wait, but the pH curve is that at equivalence point, the pH is pKb. So option C says "pH equals pKb at equivalence point", which is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option C: pH decreases, then another decrease to reach equivalence point where pH equals pKb.

Wait, no, the option says another decrease to reach equivalence point where pH equals pKb.

Wait, no. The option says: "pH decreases, then another decrease to reach equivalence point where pH equals pKb."

No, that's not correct. The pH at equivalence point is pKb, but the option says 'pH equals pKb at equivalence point', which is correct. So option C is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought pH at equivalence point is 7. But that's incorrect.

So the correct option is C.
</think>

When titrating a weak base with a strong acid, the pH curve behaves as follows:

1. **Initial pH**: The solution starts with a high pH (basic) because the weak base has a higher pH than 7.

2. **Decrease in pH**: As you add acid (H+ ions), the pH decreases. This is because the reaction between the weak base and the strong acid proceeds until the moles of acid equal the moles of base.

3. **Equivalence Point**: At the equivalence point, the moles of acid equal the moles of base. The solution contains the conjugate acid of the weak base, which is a weak acid. The pH at this point is determined by the conjugate acid, and it is equal to the pKb of the conjugate acid.

4. **Beyond Equivalence Point**: Adding excess strong acid increases the pH further because the strong acid contributes additional H+ ions to the solution.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The pH does not decrease to 7 at the equivalence point. The pH at the equivalence point is determined by the conjugate acid, and it is equal to pKb, not 7.

- **Option B**: Incorrect. The pH does not decrease and then increase. The pH decreases to the equivalence point and then continues to increase beyond it.

- **Option C**: Correct. The pH decreases to the equivalence point, and at the equivalence point, the pH equals pKb. This is consistent with the behavior of the conjugate acid in the solution.

- **Option D**: Incorrect. The pH does not decrease and then increase. The pH decreases to the equivalence point and then continues to increase beyond it.

### Conclusion:
The correct description of the pH changes during the titration is given by **Option C**: "The pH decreases, then another decrease to reach equivalence point where pH equals pKb."

ANSWER: C
