Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure out which compound is the least soluble in water. The options are A to I, each with different metal hydroxides and sulfates. Hmm, I remember that solubility rules can help me here.

Let me think. The question is about which is least soluble. So I need to look at each compound and determine their solubility. I'll probably go through each option one by one.

Option A: Cu(OH)2. Copper hydroxide. I think hydroxides of transition metals are usually less soluble than group 1 metals, but wait, wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe copper hydroxide isn't very soluble at all. I think copper hydroxide is actually not very soluble, maybe only sparingly soluble. Alternatively, wait, I remember that group 2 hydroxides are more soluble than group 1, but group 1 hydroxides are less soluble. So for example, NaOH is more soluble than KOH. So, copper hydroxide is probably less soluble than, say, NaOH. But wait, Cu(OH)2 is a solid, so maybe it's more soluble? I'm a bit confused.

Option B: Zn(NO3)2. Zinc nitrate. Nitrate salts are generally soluble. Zinc is a +2 ion. So Zn(NO3)2 should be soluble. So B is soluble, so it's not the answer.

Option C: NiSO3. Nickel sulfate. Sulfate salts are usually soluble, except for some group 2 metals. Wait, sulfate of group 1 is always soluble, but group 2 is a bit tricky. Nickel is group 12, so I think sulfate of group 12 (like Ni) is usually soluble, but wait, no. Wait, I think sulfate salts are generally soluble except for group 2 and ammonium (NH4+). So NiSO3 should be soluble. So C is soluble, so not the answer.

Option D: MgCl2. Magnesium chloride. Chlorides are generally soluble, except for group 1 and ammonium. MgCl2 is Mg^2+ and Cl^-; since Cl is soluble, MgCl2 is soluble. So D is soluble, not the answer.

Option E: Mn(NO3)2. Manganese nitrate. Nitrate salts are usually soluble, but wait, some metals are exceptions. Mn is not a group 2, so nitrate of Mn should be soluble. So E is soluble, so not the answer.

Option F: FeSO4. Iron sulfate. Sulfate of Fe^2+ is usually soluble. So FeSO4 is soluble. So F is soluble, not the answer.

Option G: CrCl3. Chromium(III) chloride. Chlorides of group 1 and 2 are generally soluble, but chromium(III) is an exception. Chromium(III) chloride is not very soluble. Wait, wait, no, I think it's more soluble than group 2. Or maybe it's the opposite. Wait, I'm a bit shaky on this. Alternatively, maybe chromium(III) chloride is soluble in water. Hmm. Let me think again. The solubility rules: sulfates are usually soluble except for group 2. Chlorides: group 1 and 2 are soluble, others (like nitrates, hydroxides, carbonates, phosphates) are usually insoluble. So for CrCl3, since Cl is a group 1 or 2 chloride? Wait, no, Cr is a transition metal. The solubility of CrCl3: according to what I remember, CrCl3 is actually soluble in water but more than, say, AgNO3. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, I think that chromium(III) chloride is actually soluble. Because, for example, I think that BaCl2 is soluble, but CrCl3 might be more soluble than some others. Hmmm, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe CrCl3 is not very soluble. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of other metals. For example, AgNO3 is soluble, but NaCl is not. So CrCl3 might be more soluble than NaCl, but less than AgNO3. Alternatively, maybe CrCl3 is less soluble than some others, like maybe AgNO3 is soluble, but CrCl3 is not. Wait, if CrCl3 is more soluble than FeCl3, for example, which is a more common one. I think FeCl3 is more soluble than CrCl3. Because Fe^3+ is a stronger acid than Cr^3+, so it's more soluble in water. So CrCl3 might be less soluble than FeCl3. Or wait, maybe CrCl3 is more soluble than FeCl3? I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe CrCl3 is less soluble than, say, AgNO3. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consult what I know. Oh wait, I remember that some chromium salts are less soluble. Like, for example, CrCl3 is less soluble than BaCl2 or AgCl. Wait, but I'm getting the details wrong. Alternatively, perhaps CrCl3 is actually more soluble than some others. Hmm, maybe I should check another approach. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's move on and see which is the least soluble.

Option H: NaBr. Sodium bromide. Bromide is a group 1 halide, so it's soluble. So H is soluble.

Option I: KI. Potassium iodide. Iodide is a group 1 halide, so KI is soluble. So I is soluble.

Wait, so the question is which is least soluble. Let's recap:

A: Cu(OH)2—maybe not very soluble, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think that copper hydroxide is not very soluble. But wait, other hydroxides are more soluble.

Wait, what about the group 2 hydroxides? I remember that hydroxides of group 2 metals (like CaOH2, BaOH2) are less soluble than those of group 1. So for example, Mg(OH)2 is less soluble than Ca(OH)2. So if that's the case, Cu(OH)2 is perhaps not as soluble as Mg(OH)2. So perhaps A is more soluble than D. Wait, but I'm not sure, I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Wait, looking back, the question is which is least soluble. So which of the options has the lowest solubility in water.

So let's list all options:

A: Cu(OH)2—maybe less soluble than others.

B: Zn(NO3)2— soluble.

C: NiSO3— likely soluble.

D: MgCl2— soluble.

E: Mn(NO3)2— soluble.

F: FeSO4— soluble.

G: CrCl3— possibly having lower solubility than some others. Or perhaps higher.

H: NaBr— soluble.

I: KI— soluble.

So the least soluble is likely between options A and G.

Wait, but CrCl3 (option G) is an exception. I think that Cr(OH)3 is not very soluble, but that's not an option here. Option G is CrCl3.

Wait, another angle: looking at the list, the solubility is as follows.

Mostly, group 1 hydroxides (like NaOH, KOH) are more soluble than group 2 (like CaOH2, Mg(OH)2). So for example, Mg(OH)2 is more soluble than Ca(OH)2.

Wait, but in our options, the group 2 would be things like Cu(OH)2 being more soluble than another transition metal's hydroxide.

Wait, but for group 1, the solubility order is: NaOH > KOH > CaOH2 > Mg(OH)2 > Sr(OH)2 > etc. So if Cu(OH)2 is more soluble than Mg(OH)2, then perhaps Cu(OH)2 is more soluble than others. Alternatively, I think that the order of hydroxides for group 1 is that the higher the atomic number, the less soluble. So for example, NaOH is more soluble than Mg(OH)2, which is more soluble than Ca(OH)2, etc.

Wait, but that's for group 1. So, for group 2 metals, the order is higher atomic number (like Zn, Fe) is less soluble than lower. Wait, for example, Ba(OH)2 is more soluble than Zn(OH)2.

So, going back: Cu(OH)2 is more soluble than Mg(OH)2. So if MgCl2 is soluble, then Cu(OH)2 would be more soluble than MgCl2. So if I'm looking for the least soluble, then perhaps something else is less soluble.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's see which compounds are known to be less soluble.

Wait, I remember that chromium (III) chloride (CrCl3) is not very soluble. Or wait, no, I think that iron(III) chloride is more soluble than CrCl3. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps CrCl3 is more soluble than some others. Let me think about the solubility of various chlorides.

Wait, for example, AgCl is very soluble, BaCl2 is quite soluble, FeCl3 is more soluble than CrCl3. Hmm, so CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3. So if CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3, then it would be a candidate.

Wait, but which of the options is that? Let's check the options again.

Looking back, option G is CrCl3. So if CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3, then G is less soluble than F which is FeSO4.

Wait, but FeCl3 is Fe(NO3)3, which is more soluble than CrCl3. So FeCl3 is more soluble than CrCl3.

So CrCl3 (G) would be less soluble than FeCl3 (F) and FeSO4 (F is FeSO4, which is Fe(NO3)2, which is soluble. Wait, no, FeCl3 is Fe(NO3)3, which is more soluble than Fe(NO3)2. So CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3, which is more soluble than Fe(NO3)2. So CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3, which is less soluble than Fe(NO3)2. So CrCl3 (G) is less soluble than FeSO4 (F) and FeCl3 (F is FeSO4? Wait, F is FeSO4, which is Fe(NO3)2, so yeah, FeCl3 is Fe(NO3)3, which is more soluble than Fe(NO3)2. So CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3, which is less soluble than Fe(NO3)2.

Wait, so CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3 and Fe(NO3)2. So if CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3, then G is less soluble than FeCl3, which is less soluble than Fe(NO3)2.

But wait, let me think about the solubility of CrCl3. I think that chromium(III) chloride is actually more soluble than sodium chloride but less soluble than barium chloride. So maybe CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3, but more than some others.

Alternatively, perhaps CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3, which would make it the least soluble among the options.

Wait, another angle: which of these compounds is more likely to precipitate out of solution?

So, if a compound in the solution is less soluble, it won't precipitate as much. So the least soluble would be the one with the lowest solubility.

So, which of the options has the lowest solubility in water?

Looking at the options:

A: Cu(OH)2. If it's less soluble than others, it won't precipitate as much.

B: Zn(NO3)2. Soluble.

C: NiSO3. Soluble.

D: MgCl2. Soluble.

E: Mn(NO3)2. Soluble.

F: FeSO4. Fe^2+ and SO4^2-. FeSO4 is Fe(NO3)2, which is soluble.

G: CrCl3. Less soluble than FeCl3 (which is more soluble than Fe(NO3)2).

So, if CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3, which is less soluble than Fe(NO3)2, then CrCl3 would be the least soluble.

Alternatively, maybe others have lower solubility. Let's think of another approach. Perhaps I should list the solubility of each:

1. Cu(OH)2: Not very soluble. I think it's not very soluble, maybe around 0.03 g per 100 mL water. But I'm not sure.

2. Zn(NO3)2: Probably very soluble, so high solubility.

3. NiSO3: soluble, so high.

4. MgCl2: Soluble, high.

5. Mn(NO3)2: Soluble, high.

6. FeSO4: Fe^2+ and SO4^2-. FeSO4 is Fe(NO3)2, so it's more soluble than CrCl3. So FeSO4 is more soluble than CrCl3.

7. CrCl3: Not very soluble. Maybe around 0.003 g per 100 mL.

8. NaBr: Highly soluble, so high.

9. KI: Highly soluble, so high.

So in terms of solubility, the order from most soluble to least:

Zn(NO3)2 > Mn(NO3)2 > Fe(NO3)3 (FeSO4) > Cu(OH)2 > CrCl3 > NaBr > KI.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about the order of Cu(OH)2 and CrCl3.

Alternatively, perhaps CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3, which is less soluble than Fe(NO3)2.

So in this case, CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3, which is less soluble than Fe(NO3)2.

So the least soluble would be CrCl3, as it's less soluble than FeCl3 and Fe(NO3)2.

Wait, but then, if option G is CrCl3, then it's the least soluble.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct order is that CrCl3 is more soluble than some others.

Wait, another angle: The solubility of chromium-based chlorides. Chromium(III) chloride is actually more soluble than sodium chloride but less soluble than, say, barium chloride. So CrCl3 is more soluble than NaCl. So NaCl is much less soluble than CrCl3.

Wait, but then, does that mean that CrCl3 is more soluble than NaCl, which is more soluble than FeCl3?

Wait, no, I think that FeCl3 is more soluble than CrCl3. Because Fe^3+ is a stronger acid than Cr^3+.

Wait, let me think about solubility of nitrates and chlorides. For example, AgCl is more soluble than FeCl3 because Ag+ is a stronger cation.

So, if FeCl3 is more soluble than CrCl3, then FeCl3 (Fe(NO3)3) is more soluble than CrCl3 (CrCl3).

So, CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3.

Now, FeCl3 is more soluble than Fe(NO3)2, which is FeSO4 (option F).

Wait, Fe(NO3)2 is more soluble than CrCl3. So FeCl3 is more soluble than CrCl3. Hence, CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3, which is less soluble than Fe(NO3)2.

So, the least soluble would be CrCl3 (option G).

Wait, but what about Cu(OH)2? I'm not sure if it's less soluble than CrCl3. Wait, but earlier I thought that Cu(OH)2's solubility is lower than Mg(OH)2. So if Mg(OH)2 is more soluble than Cu(OH)2, then Cu(OH)2 would be less soluble than MgCl2, which is more soluble than Cu(OH)2.

Wait, but I'm not certain. So perhaps the order is that CrCl3 is the least soluble, followed by Cu(OH)2, then others.

Wait, but wait, think about the periodic table. Group 2 metals have lower solubility, so their hydroxides are more soluble than group 1. So, for example, Ca(OH)2 is more soluble than Mg(OH)2, which is more soluble than Na(OH) (though NaOH is more soluble than Mg(OH)2). Wait, no, wait. NaOH is more soluble than Mg(OH)2.

Wait, group 1 hydroxides: NaOH more soluble than Mg(OH)2, which is more than Ca(OH)2, which is more than Ba(OH)2, etc. So group 1 hydroxides: NaOH is most soluble. So group 2: Mg(OH)2 is next, then Ca(OH)2, then Ba(OH)2, etc.

So, if that's the case, Cu(OH)2 would be less soluble than Mg(OH)2, which is less soluble than Ca(OH)2. So the order would be NaOH > Mg(OH)2 > Ca(OH)2 > ... etc.

So, among the options, Cu(OH)2 is a group 2 hydroxide, so it's less soluble than group 1, but more than another group 2.

Wait, but if group 2 hydroxides are more soluble than group 1, then for example, Mg(OH)2 is more soluble than NaOH, but less than Ca(OH)2.

So, among the options, Cu(OH)2 would be less soluble than MgCl2? Or more? Because MgCl2 is more soluble than Mg(OH)2.

Wait, but the question is about which is the least soluble.

So, let's suppose that among the group 2 hydroxides, the least soluble is Cu(OH)2, and the most is Mg(OH)2, which is more soluble than Ca(OH)2, etc.

So, among the options, the group 2 hydroxides would be: Mg(OH)2 (more soluble than Cu(OH)2), but perhaps Cu(OH)2 is more soluble than other group 2.

Wait, but if group 2's hydroxides are less soluble than group 1's, the order would be NaOH > Mg(OH)2 > Ca(OH)2 > Ba(OH)2 > Sr(OH)2, etc.

So, if Cu(OH)2 is less soluble than Mg(OH)2, then MgCl2 is more soluble than CuCl2.

But CuCl2 is soluble, so Cu(OH)2 would be less soluble than Mg(OH)2.

Wait, but the question is which of the options is least soluble. So, the options are A: Cu(OH)2, B: Zn(NO3)2, etc. So, if A is less soluble than others, then it's the answer.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to make a table of solubility (from highest to lowest):

Option A: Cu(OH)2 is less soluble than Mg(OH)2.

Option B: Zn(NO3)2 is very soluble.

Option C: NiSO3 is soluble.

Option D: MgCl2 is soluble.

Option E: Mn(NO3)2 is soluble.

Option F: FeSO4 is more soluble than CrCl3, which would be more soluble than FeCl3, which is more soluble than CrCl3.

Wait, but I'm not getting the order right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is that CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3 and Fe(NO3)2.

So, if CrCl3 is the least soluble, then that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another mistake. Let me think about the solubility of chromium-based chlorides. Chromium(III) chloride is actually more soluble than sodium chloride but less soluble than barium chloride. So, CrCl3 is more soluble than NaCl but less than BaCl2.

So, if BaCl2 is more soluble than CrCl3, then CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3, which is more soluble than CrCl3.

So, the order would be: BaCl2 > CrCl3 > FeCl3.

Wait, that's possible. So FeCl3 is more soluble than CrCl3.

So, if that's the case, CrCl3 (option G) is less soluble than FeCl3 (option F).

So, the least soluble would be CrCl3 (G).

Alternatively, I'm not confident about the solubility of BaCl2 and CrCl3. I think that BaCl2 is more soluble than CrCl3, but I'm not certain. So, perhaps if CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3, then it would be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps another option is less soluble.

Wait, but another approach: let me think about which of the given options would precipitate out of solution. The one that is least soluble would remain in solution, because it can't precipitate.

Wait, but the question is about which is least soluble. So, if a compound is less soluble, it won't precipitate. So, the one with the least solubility is the least soluble.

So, among the options, which is least soluble in water.

So, from the options given, which is less soluble than the others.

Assuming that CrCl3 is less soluble than FeCl3 and Fe(NO3)2, then CrCl3 would be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the correct answer is Cu(OH)2. Let me think again.

Wait, if I think that the solubility order goes from most soluble to least as:

Cu(OH)2 < Mg(OH)2 < Ca(OH)2 < ... etc.

Wait, but I thought that Ca(OH)2 is more soluble than Mg(OH)2. So perhaps Mg(OH)2 is less soluble than Ca(OH)2, which in turn is less than NaOH.

Wait, but according to what I know, Mg(OH)2 is more soluble than Ca(OH)2.

Wait, no, I think that Ca(OH)2 is more soluble than Mg(OH)2, because the higher atomic number of Ca leads to stronger acid in hydroxide. So, for example, Ca(OH)2 is more soluble than Mg(OH)2 because the hydroxide is more soluble when the acid is stronger.

Wait, so yes, Ca(OH)2 is more soluble than Mg(OH)2. So, Mg(OH)2 is less soluble than Ca(OH)2.

So, if we're looking for the least soluble, that would be Mg(OH)2.

But wait, the options don't have Mg(OH)2; they have Cu(OH)2.

So, perhaps Cu(OH)2 is less soluble than Mg(OH)2.

If so, then Cu(OH)2 would be the least soluble, making option A the correct answer.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option A: Cu(OH)2.
</think>

To determine which compound is the least soluble in water, we analyze the solubility trends of the given options. Solubility trends generally follow the order of group 1 hydroxides (most soluble) to group 2 hydroxides (least soluble). For example, NaOH is more soluble than Mg(OH)₂, which is more soluble than Ca(OH)₂, and so on. Group 1 hydroxides decrease in solubility as we move down the group, with the highest solubility for NaOH and the lowest for Ca(OH)₂.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Cu(OH)₂**: Copper hydroxide is less soluble than Mg(OH)₂ because the solubility decreases as we move down the group. Thus, Cu(OH)₂ is less soluble than Mg(OH)₂.
2. **Zn(NO₃)₂**: Zn²⁺ and NO₃⁻ ions form a soluble compound (Zn(NO₃)₂), so this is highly soluble.
3. **NiSO₃**: Nickel sulfate (Ni²⁺ and SO₄²⁻ ions) is soluble because both ions form stable compounds.
4. **MgCl₂**: Magnesium chloride is soluble because Mg²⁺ and Cl⁻ ions form a stable compound.
5. **Mn(NO₃)₂**: Manganese nitrate is soluble because Mn²⁺ and NO₃⁻ ions form stable compounds.
6. **FeSO₄**: Iron sulfate is more soluble than FeCl₃ because Fe²⁺ is a stronger cation than Fe³⁺.
7. **CrCl₃**: Chromium(III) chloride is less soluble than FeCl₃ because Fe³⁺ is a stronger ion than Cr³⁺.
8. **NaBr**: Sodium bromide is highly soluble because Na⁺ and Br⁻ ions form stable compounds.
9. **KI**: Potassium iodide is highly soluble because K⁺ and I⁻ ions form stable compounds.

### Conclusion:
The least soluble compound is **Cu(OH)₂** because it is less soluble than Mg(OH)₂, which is itself less soluble than Ca(OH)₂. Among the options provided, **Cu(OH)₂** (option A) is the least soluble in water.
