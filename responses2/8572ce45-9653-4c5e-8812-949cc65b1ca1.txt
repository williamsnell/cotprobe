Okay, so I have this probability distribution problem here. Let me take a deep breath and try to figure this out step by step. The question is about finding the expected value E(X) and the variance Var(X) for a random variable X based on the given probabilities. 

The table provided is as follows:
x_i | Pr(X = x_i)
---|---
0 | 8/27
1 | 12/27
2 | 6/27
3 | 1/27

Hmm, let me start by recalling what E(X) and Var(X) are. I remember that E(X) is the expected value, which is the sum of each possible value multiplied by its probability. And Var(X) is the variance, which is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean. 

So, I'll begin by calculating E(X). That should be straightforward. I'll multiply each x_i by its probability and sum them all up. 

First, let's note down the values:
x=0, p=8/27
x=1, p=12/27
x=2, p=6/27
x=3, p=1/27

Calculating each term:
For x=0: 0 * (8/27) = 0
For x=1: 1 * (12/27) = 12/27. Let me simplify that, 12 ÷ 27 is 4/9.
For x=2: 2 * (6/27) = 12/27, which is again 4/9.
For x=3: 3 * (1/27) = 3/27, which simplifies to 1/9.

Now, adding all these up: 0 + 4/9 + 4/9 + 1/9. Let's add them step by step. 4/9 +4/9 is 8/9, plus 1/9 makes 9/9, which is 1. So E(X) is 1. That's interesting because that's one of the options. Let me check the options quickly:

Options are A to J, with E(X) being one of them. Oh, looking at the options, option D has E(X)=1. So that's a possible answer. But I should check both E(X) and Var(X) to make sure.

Now, onto Var(X). The variance is calculated as E(X²) minus [E(X)]². So I'll need to compute E(X²) first. 

E(X²) is the sum of each x_i squared multiplied by its probability. Let's compute that.

x=0: 0^2 * (8/27) = 0
x=1: 1^2 * (12/27) = 12/27
x=2: 4 * (6/27) = 24/27
x=3: 9 * (1/27) = 9/27

Adding these together: 0 + 12/27 +24/27 +9/27.

Let me add step by step: 12 +24 is 36, plus9 is 45. So 45/27. Simplify that: 45 ÷ 27 is 5/3. So E(X²)=5/3.

Wait, no, wait. 45/27 reduces to 5/3, yes. So E(X²)=5/3.

Wait, let me double-check that. 12+24=36; 36 +9=45. Yes, 45/27 is 5/3. So E(X²)=5/3. 

Now, [E(X)]² is (1)^2 = 1. So Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]² = 5/3 - 1. 

Calculating that: 5/3 minus 3/3 is 2/3. So Var(X) is 2/3.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Did I calculate E(X²) correctly? Let me check each term again.

x=0: 0 * 8/27 =0
x=1:1 *12/27= 12/27
x=2:4 *6/27=24/27
x=3:9 *1/27=9/27

Adding: 0 +12/27 +24/27 +9/27 = (12+24+9)/27 =45/27=5/3. That's correct.

And E(X) is 1, so [E(X)]² is 1. Thus, Var(X)=5/3 -1 =2/3. So Var(X) is 2/3.

Wait, but I should check the options again. The options are:

A: E=3/2, Var=1/4 → E=1.5, Var=0.25 → I think 2/3 is approximately 0.666, so not 0.25. So A is wrong.

B: E=2, Var=1/3 → E=2, which is more than I found (1). So B is incorrect.

C: E=5/3, Var=5/9 → E is 5/3 ≈1.666, but our calculation is 1. So C is wrong.

D: E=1, Var=2/3 → E=1, Var=2/3≈0.666. So that's correct as per our calculations.

E: E=3/4, Var=3/8 → E is 0.75, which is less than 1, so no.

F: E=2/3, Var=1 → E lower than our result, wrong.

G: E=0.5, Var=0.5 → E is way below.

H: E=1.5, Var=1.5 → E is higher, Var=1.5 is higher. So no.

I: E=1/2, Var=1/2 → E=0.5, which is way lower than our 1.

J: E=1/3, Var=2 → E is around 0.33, way lower than 1.

So the correct answer is D: E(X)=1, Var(X)=2/3.

To compute E(X) and Var(X):

1. **Expected Value (E(X))**:
   - Calculate each term: \( x_i \times Pr(X = x_i) \)
   - \( 0 \times \frac{8}{27} = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \times \frac{12}{27} = \frac{12}{27} = \frac{4}{9} \)
   - \( 2 \times \frac{6}{27} = \frac{12}{27} = \frac{4}{9} \)
   - \( 3 \times \frac{1}{27} = \frac{3}{27} = \frac{1}{9} \)
   - Sum: \( 0 + \frac{4}{9} + \frac{4}{9} + \frac{1}{9} = 1 \)
   - So, \( E(X) = 1 \).

2. **Variance (Var(X))**:
   - Compute \( E(X^2) \):
     - \( x_i^2 \times Pr(X = x_i) \)
     - \( 0^2 \times \frac{8}{27} = 0 \)
     - \( 1^2 \times \frac{12}{27} = \frac{12}{27} = \frac{4}{9} \)
     - \( 2^2 \times \frac{6}{27} = \frac{24}{27} = \frac{8}{9} \)
     - \( 3^2 \times \frac{1}{27} = \frac{9}{27} = \frac{1}{3} \)
     - Sum: \( 0 + \frac{4}{9} + \frac{8}{9} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{13}{9} + \frac{3}{9} = \frac{16}{9} \)
   - \( E(X^2) = \frac{16}{9} \)
   - \( Var(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2 = \frac{16}{9} - 1 = \frac{7}{9} \)
   - Wait, this doesn't match our previous calculation. Let me recheck:

Wait, I made a mistake in calculating \( E(X^2) \). Let me correct that:

- \( x=0 \): \( 0^2 \times \frac{8}{27} = 0 \)
- \( x=1 \): \( 1^2 \times \frac{12}{27} = \frac{12}{27} \)
- \( x=2 \): \( 4 \times \frac{6}{27} = \frac{24}{27} \)
- \( x=3 \): \( 9 \times \frac{1}{27} = \frac{9}{27} \)
- Sum: \( 0 + \frac{12}{27} + \frac{24}{27} + \frac{9}{27} = \frac{45}{27} = \frac{5}{3} \)
- So, \( E(X^2) = \frac{5}{3} \)
- Then, \( Var(X) = \frac{5}{3} - (1)^2 = \frac{5}{3} - 1 = \frac{2}{3} \)

So, the correct calculations are:
- \( E(X) = 1 \)
- \( Var(X) = \frac{2}{3} \)

Thus, the correct option is **D: E(X) = 1, Var(X) = 2/3**.
