Okay, so I've got this question about group theory. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the group G with operation 0 is abelian, and asks which statement about G is true. So I need to figure out which of the options (A to H) must be true given that G is abelian.

First, let me recall what an abelian group is. An abelian group is one where the group operation is commutative. That means for any two elements g and h in G, g * h = h * g. So the operation is commutative.

Now, let's look at each option.

Option A: (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G. Hmm. Let me compute both sides. On the left, (g o h)^2 is (g o h) o (g o h). On the right, it's g squared times h squared. But in an abelian group, multiplication is commutative. Wait, but group operation is not necessarily commutative in this case, but since it's abelian, it's commutative. Let me compute:

Left: (g o h)^2 = (g o h) o (g o h) = g o h o g o h.

Right: g^2 o h^2 = (g o g) o (h o h) = g o g o h o h.

But since the group is abelian, the order of multiplication doesn't matter. So the left side is g o h o g o h, which can be rearranged as g o g o h o h, which is exactly the right side. So option A is true.

Wait, but I should check the other options to make sure it's not more than one correct answer. Let me see.

Option B: g = h for every g, h in G. That would mean G has only one element, the identity. But the question says G is abelian, not necessarily of order 1. So this is too strong. So B is not necessarily true.

Option C: g = g^-1 for every g in G. This would mean every element is its own inverse. That's true for groups of exponent 2, but not all abelian groups have that property. For example, consider the Klein four-group which is abelian but every element is self-inverse. Wait, no, that's true. Wait, but the Klein four-group is abelian and every element is self-inverse. But consider another group, like the integers under addition. Wait, no, in additive groups, the inverse is -g, which is not equal to g except when g=0. So in additive notation, the inverse is -g, which is only equal to g if g is the identity. But in multiplicative notation, it's not the same. So for multiplicative groups, this wouldn't hold. Wait, wait, the question says "group (G, 0)"—so the operation is 0. So the operation is commutative, but it's not necessarily addition. So for example, consider the multiplicative group of complex numbers on the unit circle. For example, the group {1, -1, i, -i} under multiplication. Each element is its own inverse because 1^2=1, (-1)^2=1, i^2=-1 (wait no, i squared is -1, which is not 1. Hmm, perhaps another example. Let me think: in multiplicative groups, the inverses are different. So for example, take the multiplicative group of integers modulo 3: {1, 2}. 2 is its own inverse because 2*2=4 ≡1 mod3. So that group satisfies C, but it's abelian. But wait, what about the group Z_2 under addition? It's abelian, and every element is its own inverse (0 has inverse 0, 1 has inverse 1). So C isn't necessarily true because there are abelian groups where not every element is self-inverse. So C is not necessarily true.

Option D: G has a prime number of elements. Wait, not necessarily. For example, the Klein four-group is abelian and has four elements, which is not a prime number. So D is not necessarily true.

Option E: g = g^2 for every g in G. Hmm, that would mean each element is its own inverse. So for all g, g^2 = e. But in an abelian group, this would require that every element is self-inverse. But in additive notation, that's exactly the case for a group where every element is its own negative—like Z_2, but wait, in additive terms, if G is abelian, then for all g, -g = g, which implies that 2g = 0 for all g. So the group has exponent 2. But in multiplicative terms, that's a different story. Wait, let's see:

In multiplicative notation, if g^2 = e for all g, then the group is called an elementary abelian 2-group. But in additive notation, that would mean that for all g, 2g = 0. So the group is a vector space over the field with two elements. But in any case, such a group is necessarily of exponent 2. However, not all abelian groups are of exponent 2. For example, the Klein four-group is exponent 2, but so is the cyclic group of order 4. Wait, the cyclic group of order 4 has elements of order 4, so g^2 would not equal e for all g in that group. So E isn't necessarily true.

Option F: G has exactly one element. That's the identity element. But wait, the question states that G is abelian, but there are abelian groups larger than the trivial group. For example, the cyclic group of order 2 is abelian, but it has two elements. So F is not necessarily true.

Option G: g = e for every g in G. That would mean G has only the identity element, so it's the trivial group. But again, in the question, G is given as an abelian group, not necessarily trivial. So G could be larger, like the Klein four-group. So G is not necessarily true.

Option H: G is of finite order. That would mean the group is finite. But wait, the question doesn't state that G is finite. For example, the group of all integers under addition is infinite and abelian. So H isn't necessarily true.

Option I: G is of infinite order. So if G is infinite, it's abelian. For example, the group of integers under addition is infinite and abelian. But the question doesn't specify whether G is finite or infinite. So I is not necessarily true.

Wait, but wait. Let me go back to option A. Earlier I thought that option A is true. Let me recheck option A. So G is abelian, so for any g, h in G, (g h)² = g² h². Since G is abelian, (g h)² = g² h². So yes, option A is true.

What about option E? If every element is its own inverse, then g = g^2 for all g. But that's not the case for all abelian groups. For example, the cyclic group Z_2 is abelian and every element is its own inverse. But the cyclic group Z_4 is abelian, but 2 is not equal to 2^2 (which is 0 in Z4, but 2 is not 0). So E is not necessarily true.

Wait, but the question is about which of these options is TRUE for G. So if option A is true, then G must satisfy that (g o h)^2 = g² o h². So A must be a correct statement.

So the options that are correct are A and possibly others if applicable. Let me look again.

Wait, earlier I thought A is correct. So the correct answers would be A and perhaps another. Let me review all the options again.

Looking again, option A is (gh)^2 = g²h². Since G is abelian, gh = hg, so (gh)^2 = g²h², as ghgh = g^2h^2 because ghgh = gghh = g^2h^2. So option A is correct.

Other options: B is not true since G could be larger. C is not necessarily true. D is false because G could be of order 4, for example. E is also not necessarily true. F and G are even more incorrect.

So the correct answer is option A.

The question asks which statement about an abelian group (G, 0) must be true. Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: For any g, h in G, (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2. Since G is abelian, (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 holds true. This is correct.

- **Option B**: Every element in G is equal to itself, which is trivially true but not necessarily the case for all abelian groups (e.g., the cyclic group of order 2 has two elements). Thus, this is not necessarily true.

- **Option C**: Every element is its own inverse. This holds for certain abelian groups (e.g., the Klein four-group) but not for all. For example, in the multiplicative group {1, -1, i, -i} under complex multiplication, i^2 = -1, not 1. Hence, this is not necessarily true.

- **Option D**: G has a prime number of elements. This is false because, for example, the Klein four-group has four elements, which is not prime.

- **Option E**: Each element is its own inverse. This requires the group to have exponent 2. While true for groups like the cyclic group of order 2, it's not necessarily true for all abelian groups. For example, the cyclic group of order 4 has elements of order 4, not 2.

- **Option F**: G has exactly one element. This is false because G could be larger, such as the cyclic group of order 2.

- **Option G**: Every element is the identity. This implies G is trivial, which is not necessarily the case.

- **Option H**: G is of finite order. This is false because G could be infinite, like the group of all integers under addition.

- **Option I**: G is of infinite order. This is false because G could be finite, such as the cyclic group of order 2.

The only statement that must be true for any abelian group G is **Option A**.
