Okay, so I have this question about unemployment insurance taxes. Hmm, let me think. The question says that the total taxable payroll is $100,000. The employer pays 0.4% to the federal government and 2.7% to the state. I need to figure out how much each part is and match it to the options given.

Wait, so the federal part is 0.4% of $100,000. Let me calculate that. 0.4% is the same as 0.4/100, so 0.004. Multiply that by $100,000. 0.004 * 100,000 = 400. So federal is $400.

Then the state is 2.7%, which is 2.7/100 = 0.027. Multiply by $100,000. 0.027 * 100,000 = 2700. So state is $2,700.

Now I look at the options. Let's see:

Option C says $400 and $2,700. That's exactly what I calculated. So the answer should be C.

The correct tax payments are federal $400 and state $2,700, which corresponds to option C.
