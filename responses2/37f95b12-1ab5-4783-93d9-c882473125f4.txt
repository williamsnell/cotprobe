Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that an average human produces about 10 MJ of heat each day through metabolic activity. If a human body were an isolated system with a mass of 65 kg and the heat capacity of water, what temperature rise would it experience? The options are various K values, ranging from 20K up to 65K.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that heat capacity relates to how much heat a substance can absorb or release per degree change in temperature. The formula is Q = mcΔT, where Q is heat, m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. The human body when at rest doesn't really produce heat, but when active, like when you're moving, you produce heat. But in this problem, it's given as 10 MJ per day. So the Q here is 10 MJ.

But wait, the mass given is 65 kg, which is a lot! But the human's heat capacity is that of water. Oh right, because the question says "the heat capacity of water." So I think I'll have to use the specific heat capacity of water in this calculation.

Wait, what's the specific heat capacity of water? I remember it's around 4.184 J/g°C. But wait, I should make sure about the units. Because I'm dealing with 65 kg, which is 65,000 grams. Oh, right, so 65,000 grams. So using J/g°C is correct.

So the heat Q is 10 MJ. Wait, 10 MJ is 10,000,000 J. Because 1 MJ is 10^6 J.

Now, using Q = mcΔT, I can rearrange it to find ΔT. So ΔT = Q/(m c).

Plugging in the numbers: Q is 10^7 J. Mass is 65,000 g. Specific heat c is 4.184 J/g°C.

So let's compute that. 10^7 J divided by (65,000 g * 4.184 J/g°C).

Let me compute denominator first. 65,000 *4.184. Let me compute 65 *4.184 first.

65 * 4 = 260, 65*0.184 is about 12. So 260 +12 is 272? Let me do it more accurately.

4.184 *65 = ?

4 *65 = 260. 0.184 *65 = ?

0.1 *65 =6.5, 0.08 *65=5.2, 0.004 *65=0.26. So 6.5 +5.2=11.7 +0.26=11.96. So total is 260 +11.96=271.96 J/g.

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. No, wait. The denominator is 65,000 grams multiplied by 4.184 J/(g·°C). So that's (65,000 *4.184) J/°C.

Wait, 65,000 *4.184 = ?

Let me compute 65 *4.184 = 65 *4 is 260, 65 *0.184 is approx 65 *0.18 is 11.7; 65 *0.004 is 0.26. So 11.7 +0.26=11.96. So 260 +11.96 = 271.96. So 271.96 *1000 (because 65,000 is 65 *1000) = 271,960,000 J/°C.

Wait, no, sorry. 65,000 is 65*10^3. So 65,000 *4.184 = 65 *4.184 *1e3 = 271.96 *1e3 J/°C. So 271,960 J/°C.

Wait, but Q is 10^7 J. So ΔT = 10^7 J / (271,960 J/°C) = ?

Let me compute this. 10^7 is 10,000,000.

10,000,000 divided by 271,960. Let's see. Let me compute 271,960 * 37 = ?

271,960 *30: 8,158,800. 271,960 *7=1,903,720. So 8,158,800 +1,903,720 = 10,062,520. Oh wait, that's larger than 10 million. Because 10 million is 10,000,000. So 37 would give us 10,062,520, which is 62,520 over. So 37 * 271,960 is 10,062,520. But our Q is 10 million, so 10,000,000 is 62,520 less than that.

So 37 gives 10,062,520. So 10,000,000 is 37- (62520/271960) ≈ 37 - 0.23. So about 36.77 K? So about 37 K. But wait, no, wait. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 10^7 / 271960.

Wait, 271960 is approximately 2.7196 x 1e5.

So 1e7 / 2.7196e5 ≈ (1e7 / 2.7196e5) = (1e2) / (2.7196). Because 1e7 /1e5=1e2. So 1e2 is 100, 100 /2.7196 ≈ 36.77.

So approximately 36.77 K. So about 37 K. But wait, wait, I thought the options had 37 as option E. But let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: +55K

B:+65K

C:+42K

D:+60K

E:+37K

F:+30K

G:+25K

H:+50K

I:+45K

J:+20K

Wait, so option E is 37 K. So according to my calculation, the temperature rise would be about 37 K, which is option E.

Wait, but wait a second. The mass is 65 kg, which is 65,000 grams. But wait, wait, I'm using J/(g·°C) for specific heat capacity. Oh, wait, but wait what if the specific heat was in J/(kg·°C)? Because 4.184 J/g°C is 4184 J/kg°C. So perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, no, wait. No, the specific heat is about 4.184 J/g°C, so when I use m in grams, it's correct.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. Q = mcΔT. So 10 MJ is 10,000,000 J. 65,000 g *4.184 J/g°C = 271,960 J/°C. So 10,000,000 / 271,960 ≈ 36.77 K. So ~37 K. So option E.

But wait, wait a second. The problem says the body is an isolated system. But if it's isolated, then all the heat is retained, so the body's temperature would rise by that amount. But the body's own heat production is given as 10 MJ per day.

Wait, but in reality, a human's body doesn't produce heat at that rate. But the question says, if it were an isolated system, so hypothetically, all the heat is being retained. So our calculation is accurate under that assumption.

Another thing: the heat capacity is of water. But perhaps the human body's heat capacity is about the same as water because water has a high heat capacity, but wait, human body's heat capacity is around 4.18 kJ/kg°C (which is same as 4.184 J/g°C). So that would agree.

Wait, but the problem says "the heat capacity of water," so perhaps that's a hint. But in any case, I think I'm correct.

So the answer should be E: +37 K.
</think>

To determine the temperature rise of a human body if it were an isolated system with a mass of 65 kg and the heat capacity of water, we use the formula:

\[
Q = mc\Delta T
\]

where:
- \( Q = 10 \, \text{MJ} = 10,000,000 \, \text{J} \) (heat produced per day),
- \( m = 65 \, \text{kg} = 65,000 \, \text{g} \),
- \( c = 4.184 \, \text{J/g°C} \) (specific heat capacity of water).

Rearranging for \(\Delta T\):

\[
\Delta T = \frac{Q}{mc}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta T = \frac{10,000,000}{65,000 \times 4.184}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
65,000 \times 4.184 = 271,960 \, \text{J/°C}
\]

Now, divide:

\[
\Delta T = \frac{10,000,000}{271,960} \approx 36.77 \, \text{K}
\]

This value is approximately \( 37 \, \text{K} \), which matches option E.
