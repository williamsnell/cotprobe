Alright, so I need to figure out which of these options doesn't relate to developmental models on intelligence. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Triarchic theory of intelligence. I remember that the triarchic theory was proposed by Terman and involves three primary mental abilities: Verbal, Mathematical, andLogical. This is definitely a developmental model, so A is relevant.

Option B: Multiple intelligences theory. This is a well-known developmental theory, suggesting that there are different types of intelligence, like logical-mathematical, spatial, linguistic, etc. Definitely part of the development models, so B is relevant.

Option C: Cognitive development theory. This is about how the brain develops and processes information. It's a foundational theory in educational psychology, so C is relevant.

Option D: The positive manifold. I think this is a concept from the Positive manifold theory, which focuses on the interplay between abilities and their potential. It's part of the broader development theories, so D is relevant.

Option E: G theory. Hmm, I'm not as familiar with G theory. From what I recall, G theory (G-factor) refers to the idea that about 60% of intelligence is genetic. The other 40% is learned. So in developmental models, G theory is about the genetic component, which is definitely part of developmental models, so E is relevant.

Option F: Emotional intelligence theory. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a separate construct. While it's related to emotional development, it's more about how people handle emotions and their emotional abilities, which is a separate domain from the cognitive developmental models discussed here. So F might not be relevant to the question.

Option G: Primary mental ability theory. This is about the idea that intelligence is composed of various primary abilities or factors, like speed, memory, etc. It's a foundational theory in intelligence research, so G is relevant.

Option H: Fluid and crystallized intelligence theory. This theory splits intelligence into two: fluid, which is knowledge and reasoning, and crystallized, which is memory and experience. This is definitely part of the developmental models, so H is relevant.

Option I: Investment theory. I'm not sure about this one. I think investment theory is more related to finance, like how people invest money, but I don't recall it being part of a developmental theory of intelligence. So I might be wrong here; perhaps I should consider whether this applies to development. If not, this might be the answer.

Option J: Information processing theory. This is a broad theory that explains how information is processed and stored in the brain. It's part of cognitive psychology and developmental models, so J is relevant.

The question asks for the construct that is not pertinent to developmental models on intelligence. So I'm looking for the one that doesn't fit into any of the developmental theories I know. 

Reviewing the options, F (Emotional intelligence) and I (Investment theory) are out. But I'm more confident about F because I don't think it's a developmental model. The others all seem to be part of or related to developmental theories. 

Wait, but what about I? I'm not certain, but let me think. Investment theory is about how people invest money, which is a financial topic. I don't think it's part of developmental intelligence models. So F is emotional intelligence, which is about emotions and how people develop them, which might be a different area. 

So the only one that doesn't fit is F. Alternatively, I might be wrong about I. Let me think again. Information processing theory is part of cognitive development, so J is relevant. Emotional intelligence is a separate domain, so F is not part of developmental intelligence models. 

Hence, the correct answer should be F: Emotional intelligence theory.

The construct that is not pertinent to developmental models on intelligence is F: Emotional intelligence theory.

Answer: F
