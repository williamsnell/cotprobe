Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about group theory. I'm a bit rusty on my abstract algebra, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is about two statements related to subgroups and normal subgroups. Let me read the statements again.

Statement 1: If H is a subgroup of a group G and a belongs to G, then aH = Ha. Hmm, I remember that for a subgroup H of G, the left cosets and right cosets are the same. Wait, but wait—if H is normal, then left and right cosets are the same. But Statement 1 doesn't specify that H is normal. So if H is not normal, then aH and Ha might not be equal. So Statement 1 is saying that for any a in G, aH equals Ha. But that's not always true. For example, take G as the symmetric group S3, and let H be a subgroup. If I take a as a transposition, then aH might not equal Ha. So Statement 1 is False.

Statement 2: If H is normal in G and a belongs to G, then ah = ha for all h in H. Wait, no—actually, the statement says aH = aH? No, wait, the statement is aH = ha for all h in H. Wait, no, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read it again. It's "if H is normal of G and a belongs to G, then ah = ha for all h in H." Wait, no. Let me parse it correctly.

Wait, the wording is "aH = ha for all h in H." No, that doesn't sound right. Oh wait, perhaps it's a typo. Let me read the original question again. Oh, I think I misread it. Let me read statement 2 again.

Statement 2: If H is a normal subgroup of G and a belongs to G, then ah = ha for all h in H. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, ah is an element of G, and h is in H. But after multiplying by a, the statement claims that a multiplied by h equals h multiplied by a for all h in H. But that would mean that a and h commute, which isn't necessarily true. Because H is normal, but a is just an element of G. So if a is not in H, then aH is a coset, but aH multiplied by h would be a h h, but that's not necessarily equal to h a.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The group is G, and H is a normal subgroup. So, for normality, aH = Ha. Wait, no, more precisely, H is normal, so the coset aH equals the coset Ha for any a in G. Wait, but that's not what Statement 2 says. Statement 2 is about multiplying a by each h in H. So, Statement 2 says: for all h in H, a multiplied by h equals h multiplied by a. Is that true?

Hmm, because H is normal, but that doesn't mean that a and h commute for all h in H. H is normal, which means that aH = Ha. So that would mean that for any a in G, aH equals Ha. So, for any h in H, a h is in Ha. But does a h equal h a? Not necessarily. Because Ha is the set {h a | h in H}, so a h is an element of that set. But a h could be equal to some h' a, where h' is in H. But that's not necessarily a h = h a.

Wait, no. Let me think of an example. Let G be the dihedral group of order 4, which is abelian, so every subgroup is normal. Let H be a subgroup, say the cyclic subgroup of order 2. Let a be the rotation element. Then aH is the set {a, a*h}, where h is the reflection. But wait, in an abelian group, a and h commute. So each a h would equal h a. So in that case, Statement 2 would be true.

But wait, maybe another example. Let G be S3, H be the subgroup {e, (12)}, and a be (123). Then H is normal in S3 because S3 is a small group. When I multiply a by h, say h=e, a h is a. h is (12), so a h is (123)(12) = (132). On the other hand, h a is (12)(123) = (13). So a h = (132) and h a = (13), which are different. So in this case, Statement 2 is False because a h ≠ h a.

So Statement 2 is False because when a is not in H, a h could not equal h a for all h in H.

Wait, no. Wait, the statement says, 'ah = ha for all h in H.' So in my example, a is (123), h is (12). So a h is (123)(12) = (132), h a is (12)(123) = (13). These are different. So the statement is false in this case.

So Statement 2 is False.

So now, Statement 1: False, Statement 2: False.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A: False, True → No.

B: True, False → No.

C: False, False → Yes, this matches.

D: False, True → No.

E: True, False → No.

F: True, True → No.

G: True, False → No.

H: False, False → Yes.

I: False, True → No.

J: True, True → No.

So the correct answer should be option C or H. Wait, the options are letters, so the question is about whether each statement is True or False.

Wait, each option represents the truth values of Statement 1 and Statement 2. So the options are:

A: False (S1) AND True (S2) → False.

B: True (S1) AND False (S2) → False.

C: False (S1) AND False (S2) → True.

D: False (S1) AND True (S2) → False.

E: True (S1) AND False (S2) → False.

F: True (S1) AND True (S2) → False.

G: True (S1) AND False (S2) → False.

H: False (S1) AND False (S2) → True.

I: False (S1) AND True (S2) → False.

J: True (S1) AND True (S2) → False.

So the correct option is C (False, False) or H (False, False). Both options C and H evaluate to False, False, so which one is correct?

Wait, the options are labeled as A to J, each option has a value for S1 and S2.

Looking back, the correct answer is that both statements are False.

So the correct option is C, because C is "False, False."

Wait, no. Wait, looking back, the answer options are:

A: False, True

B: True, False

C: False, False

D: False, True

E: True, False

F: True, True

G: True, False

H: False, False

I: False, True

J: True, True.

So the correct answer is C and H. Wait, but both options C and H have the same values. No, let me check the question again.

Wait, the options are given as A to J, each with their own options. So in each option, the first number is S1, the second is S2.

The question is, which option correctly states the truth values of the two statements.

So if both statements are False, then the correct option is C and H? No, because each option is a single pair. Let's see:

Looking at the options:

C: False, False.

H: False, False.

Wait, both C and H are the same. No, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, the options are:

A: False, True

B: True, False

C: False, False

D: False, True

E: True, False

F: True, True

G: True, False

H: False, False

I: False, True

J: True, True.

So the correct option is C and H. But in the options, each is a separate choice. So if both S1 and S2 are False, then the only option that matches is option C and H. But no, each option is a single pair. So when the correct answer is both False, the pair is (False, False), which is option C and H are the same. Wait, no, option C is (F,F), and H is (F,F). So both C and H are correct? But that can't be, because each option is unique. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, no. Let's think again about Statement 1 and Statement 2.

Statement 1: If H is a subgroup of G and a is any element of G, then aH = Ha. Is that statement true or false? Well, only if H is normal in G does aH = Ha for all a in G. Since the statement says "for any a in G," which is not necessarily true for all subgroups H. So Statement 1 is false.

Statement 2: If H is normal in G and a is in G, then for all h in H, a h = h a. Wait, no. Because a is just an element of G. So a multiplied by h (an element of H) would not necessarily equal h multiplied by a. For example, in S3, H is a subgroup, and a is an element not in H. Let me think of H as {e, (12)}, and a as (13). Then a h, where h is (12), is (13)(12) = (123). On the other side, h a is (12)(13) = (132). So (123) is not equal to (132), so a h ≠ h a. So Statement 2 is False.

So both statements are False, which means the correct option is C: False, False or H: False, False. Wait, but H is also (False, False). So the correct option is C and H, but in the options, each option is a single pair. So perhaps the correct answer is option C and H, but since each option is a separate choice, perhaps the correct answer is option H.

Wait, no. Let me look at the options again:

Looking at the options, C is (False, False), H is (False, False). So both C and H are the same, but in the options, each is a separate option. So perhaps the correct answer is C and H, but since each option is a single choice, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Wait, no, because H is (False, False), which is also a correct pair.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct option is (False, False), which is both C and H, but since each option is a single choice, perhaps the correct answer is option C and H. But looking at the options, only option C and H are (False, False). So perhaps the options are not distinct in this way, but each is a separate choice.

Wait, the user's question lists the options as options A to J, each with their own pair. So the correct answer is option C: False, False; and option H: False, False. So both options C and H are correct, but perhaps the question expects only one correct option. Or perhaps the options are not the way I think. Wait, perhaps I should reconsider.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of Statement 2. Let me think again: Statement 2 says "If H is normal of G and a belongs to G, then ah = ha for all h in H." Wait, perhaps that's misphrased. Oh, wait, perhaps the statement is that for all h in H, a is in H. Or perhaps not. Let me read the exact statement again.

Statement 2: If H is normal of G and a belongs to G, then ah = ha for all h in H.

Wait, that's not possible because a is in G and h is in H. So ah is in G, and h a is in G. But in group theory, for a general a and h, a h and h a are not necessarily equal. So Statement 2 is claiming that a h = h a for all h in H.

But wait, that's not generally true. For example, in the symmetric group S3, H is {e, (12)}, and a is (13). Then a h and h a are different. So Statement 2 is False.

So both statements are False. So the correct option is C: False, False.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (False, False), and option H is also (False, False). But each option is a separate choice, so perhaps the correct answer is option C and H. But perhaps the correct answer is option C, or H, but in the options, each is a separate choice, so the correct answer is C and H. But no, each option is a single choice. So perhaps the correct answer is option C and H, but since both are (False, False), perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

Wait, but the options are listed as A to J, each with their own pair. So the correct answer would be C and H, but since the options don't allow for multiple correct answers, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate Statement 1 and 2.

For Statement 1: aH = Ha for all a in G. This is true if and only if H is normal in G. Since the statement says "if H is a subgroup", without normality, it's not always true. So Statement 1 is False.

Statement 2: If H is normal and a is in G, then a h = h a for all h in H. Wait, that can't be right. Because H is normal, then aH = Ha. So aH = Ha, which implies that a h = h' a for some h' in H. But that doesn't necessarily mean a h = h a for all h in H.

Wait, but wait: aH = Ha, meaning that for each h in H, there exists some k in H such that a h = k a. So a h = k a → a h a^{-1} = k. So a h a^{-1} is in H for each h in H. But that just shows that a and H are conjugate via a. It doesn't imply that a h = h a.

Ah, so Statement 2 is False.

So both statements are False, so the correct option is C: False, False.

Looking back at the options, C is (False, False), and H is also (False, False). So perhaps the correct answer is option C: False, False. But wait, the options are each distinct, so perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering Statement 2. Let me double-check.

If H is normal in G, then aH = Ha for any a in G. That means for any h in H, a h is in Ha. But Ha is the set {h a | h in H}, so a h must be equal to some h' a, where h' is in H. So a h = h' a for some h' in H. But that doesn't mean a h = h a for all h in H. So Statement 2 is False.

So both statements are False. So the correct option is C and H, but since each is a separate choice, the correct answer is C: False, False. But looking at the options, option C is (False, False), and option H is (False, False). So the correct answer is C and H, but since each is a separate choice, perhaps the correct is C.

Wait, but the options are labeled from A to J. So the correct answer is option C and H. But each is a separate option. So the correct pair is (False, False), which is option C and H, but perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but looking again, the options are:

A: False, True

B: True, False

C: False, False

D: False, True

E: True, False

F: True, True

G: True, False

H: False, False

I: False, True

J: True, True.

So the correct answer is C and H, but each is a separate option. So the answer is C and H. But perhaps the options were intended to be paired, so the correct answer is option C: False, False.

So the correct answer is option C.
</think>

The analysis of the two statements leads to the conclusion that both are false. Statement 1 is false because it does not hold for all elements a in G unless H is normal. Statement 2 is false because multiplying an element a in G with elements h in H does not necessarily commute; it holds only when aH equals Ha, which depends on H being normal and a being in G. Both statements are false, so the correct option is C: False, False.
