Question:

A 36-year-old man comes to the office because of headaches that began 2 weeks ago. The headaches are moderately severe, are present when he awakens in the morning, and are relieved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches. He tells you he was promoted to an upper-level managerial position in his accounting firm about 8 months ago, which necessitated relocating. Physical examination now discloses no abnormalities except for blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

Options:

A: Refer him for consultation with an ophthalmologist
B: Begin a trial of a β-blocking medication
C: Begin a trial of an anti-inflammatory medication
D: Refer him for consultation with a psychiatrist
E: Prescribe over-the-counter analgesics for long term use
F: Refer him for consultation with a neurologist
G: Order CT scan of the head
H: Advise him to reduce stress and monitor symptoms

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about a 36-year-old man with severe headaches that started two weeks ago. He was promoted to a managerial position and moved, which probably affects his nervous system. Physical exam shows no abnormalities except for blurred optic disc margins. 

Hmm. So, the symptoms are headaches, which are moderate severity. They occur when he wakes up in the morning and get relieved with analgesics. No prior history of headaches. He was promoted and moved, but there's nothing else obvious wrong.

Looking at the options: the options are about next steps. Let me go through each.

Option A: Consult ophthalmologist. Well, that's about the optic disc. But the headache is elsewhere, and the exam shows no abnormalities except for the optic disc blurring. So maybe not ophthalmologist.

Option B: β-blocking. That's for migraines and migraines, especially those that come and go. But the question is about headaches. I'm not sure if β-blockers are appropriate here. I think they are for migraines and maybe others, but I'm not certain if it's applicable to headaches. Probably not the first choice.

Option C: Anti-inflammatory. That's for things like arthritis or chronic pain. Headaches can be caused by various issues, not necessarily inflammation. So probably not this either.

Option D: Consult with psychiatrist. He's in a managerial position, which could affect his brain. Maybe there's a psychiatric issue. Also, he's been in a stressful job, which could cause stress-related headaches. So a psychiatrist might be called in to assess for anxiety or depression.

Option E: OTC analgesics. But the question says he has no prior history of headaches. If he's getting them with OTC, it's not clear if it's a new issue. Maybe there's another cause, like chronic pain, but I'm not sure. So E might not be the best next step.

Option F: Consult neurologist. Neurologists deal with brain and nervous system issues. The exam shows no abnormalities except for the optic disc. So if there's a recent injury or something in the brain, a neurologist would see it. But the initial exam didn't show any abnormalities beyond what's noted. So maybe he's not having a brain injury, but perhaps a neurological issue like a stroke. But the symptoms are headaches, so a neurologist would probably advise on that. 

Wait, but if he's a manager and moved, maybe it's more about something else. Or perhaps it's a cognitive impairment. So consulting a neurologist makes sense.

Option G: CT scan. A CT of the head? Well, the question says the physical exam shows no abnormalities except for the optic disc. So a CT might be unnecessary unless there's a finding. But if it's just a blurring of optic disc, maybe no need. So G might not be the best step.

Option H: Advise to reduce stress. Stress can cause headaches. But the question says he's been promoted, which might be a recent change in work environment, not necessarily stress. So maybe stress is a factor, but other factors like depression might be more likely.

So the options are between consulting the neurologist or seeing a psychiatrist.

He's a manager, maybe it's a recent injury or perhaps he's had a stroke. But the question states the physical exam shows no abnormalities except for the optic disc. So if it's just a neurological issue, then a neurologist would see it. If it's a stress-related issue, he might be referred to a PSYCHIATRIST. 

So what's more likely? He was in a managerial position, which is a high-stress job. If stress leads to headaches, especially if there's a recent injury, then a PSYCHIATRIST would be the appropriate next step. They can assess for conditions like anxiety, depression, etc.

So the correct answer should be option D or F.

Wait, the question is which is the most appropriate next step. So if the issue is a stress-related cause, the best next step is to refer him to a PSYCHIATRIST. So the answer would be D or F.

Looking back, option F is consult neurologist. So, both options D and F are possible, but which is correct.

Wait, the question says the last character of the response must be the letter chosen. So options are letters, and the answer must end with that letter.

So, considering all, the appropriate next step is to consult a PSYCHIATRIST (D) because he's in a managerial role, which can cause stress-related headaches, especially if there's a recent injury or a brain injury. Or maybe a neurologist if it's a neurological issue unrelated to stress.

But the physical exam only shows blurred optic disc. So perhaps it's a neurological issue, like a stroke. So a neurologist would do an exam. 

But wait, a stroke would present with a lot of symptoms, but the question says headaches and no other issues. So maybe it's a different neurological issue.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's possible that the headaches are related to his recent job shift, which is stressful.

So, in that case, consulting a PSYCHIATRIST (D) would be appropriate.

So I think the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D: Refer him for consultation with a psychiatrist.

**Explanation:**
The patient is a 36-year-old man with moderate-severity headaches that began two weeks ago, occurring upon waking in the morning and relieved with OTC analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches and was promoted to an upper-level managerial position, which could be a factor in recent stress. The physical exam revealed no abnormalities in the optic disc except for blurring, but no other significant findings were noted. 

Considering the context, consulting a psychiatrist (D) is appropriate because it would assess for conditions like anxiety, depression, or other psychiatric issues, which could be contributing to the headaches. The potential stress from his managerial role may also be a factor, making a PSYCHIATRIST the most direct next step.

Answer: D
