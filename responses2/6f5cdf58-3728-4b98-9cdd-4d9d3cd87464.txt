Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again.

The question says there's a horizontal force of 5 N needed to maintain a velocity of 2 m/s for a box of mass 10 kg on a rough surface. We're supposed to find the work done by this force in one minute.

Hmm, work done by a force is calculated using the formula W = F * d * cos(theta), where F is the force, d is the displacement, and theta is the angle between them. But wait, in this case, the force is horizontal, and the displacement is also horizontal since the velocity is given as 2 m/s. Oh, right, because velocity is a vector, but in this case, the force is applied horizontally and the motion is along that same line. So the angle is zero, because the force and displacement are in the same direction. So cos(0) is 1, so W = F * d.

But wait, how do I find the displacement? The box is moving at 2 m/s, and time is one minute. Oh, right, time is 60 seconds. So displacement d is velocity multiplied by time. Oh, that's d = v * t.

So plug in the numbers: v is 2 m/s, t is 60 s. So d = 2 *60 = 120 meters.

Now, the force is 5 N. So W = 5 N * 120 m = 600 J. Wait, let me make sure. But wait, wait a second. If the box is moving at a constant velocity, that means the net force is zero. Oh, wait! But the problem says a horizontal force is applied, and the box is moving at 2 m/s. That suggests that the force is somehow overcoming friction. Because if the box were moving at constant velocity, the applied force would equal the frictional force.

Wait, but in the problem statement, is the force given as the applied force, or is it the force that's needed to maintain the velocity? Oh, the first line says, "A horizontal force of 5 N is required to maintain a velocity of 2 m/sec." So that's the force needed. So if the box is moving at that velocity, perhaps the net force is zero. Or maybe the box is moving at a constant velocity because the applied force is exactly balancing the friction. So perhaps the displacement is indeed 120 m, as calculated earlier.

So then the work done by the force is 5 N * 120 m = 600 J. But wait, wait, the question is about the work done by the force. But if the force is applied and the box is moving at a constant speed, then the force is in the same direction as the displacement, so the work is positive. So 5 N * 120 m = 600 J. Wait, but the answer options don't have 600 J as an option here. Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: 0 J
B: 240 J
C: 600 J
D: 900 J
E: 480 J
F: 300 J
G: 120 J
H: 100 J
I: 360 J
J: 720 J

So option C is 600 J. So the answer would be C. But wait, let me think again. Oh, wait a second. The box is moving at a constant velocity, so the net force is zero. That means the applied force must be equal and opposite to the frictional force. So the applied force is 5 N, and friction is 5 N.

Now, when the force is 5 N and the box is moving at 2 m/s, the displacement over a minute is 120 m, so the work done by the applied force is 5 *120 =600 J. So the answer is C.

Wait, but wait another point. Another way to calculate work is considering power. Power is work per unit time. So power P = F * v. So P =5 N * 2 m/s =10 W. Then in one minute (60 seconds), work done W = P * t =10 * 60 =600 J. Same result. So this aligns with what I got before. So I think C is the correct answer.

To determine the work done by the force on the box, we use the formula \( W = F \cdot d \cdot \cos(\theta) \), where \( F \) is the force, \( d \) is the displacement, and \( \theta \) is the angle between the force and displacement. Since the force is horizontal and the displacement is also horizontal, \( \theta = 0^\circ \), so \( \cos(0^\circ) = 1 \). Thus, \( W = F \cdot d \).

The displacement \( d \) is calculated as \( d = v \cdot t \), where \( v = 2 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( t = 60 \, \text{s} \). Substituting, \( d = 2 \cdot 60 = 120 \, \text{m} \).

The applied force is given as \( F = 5 \, \text{N} \). Therefore, the work done is:
\[
W = 5 \cdot 120 = 600 \, \text{J}.
\]

Additionally, using power \( P = F \cdot v \), where \( P = 5 \cdot 2 = 10 \, \text{W} \), and work \( W = P \cdot t = 10 \cdot 60 = 600 \, \text{J} \), corroborates the earlier result.

The correct answer is:
