Alright, let me try to figure this out. So the question is asking about the percentage of GDP that the United States spends on the military in 2017. I remember that the U.S. has been a big player in military spending, especially with the Vietnam War and Afghanistan. 

Wait, I think the U.S. has been a major spender in terms of military spending. I'm trying to recall the exact numbers. I think the military expenditure has been significant, maybe around 5% of GDP? Or was it higher? No, wait, I think in 2017, the U.S. military budget was a large portion of its GDP. 

I remember reading that the U.S. spends about 8% of its GDP on military expenses. That makes sense because the military is a big part of national defense. So looking at the options, option D is 8%. That should be the right answer. I don't think it was higher than that, and 8% is a common figure I've heard mentioned before. So yeah, D is the correct choice.
