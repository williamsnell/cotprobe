Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about blood types and allele frequencies. Hmm, let me try to work through it. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question gives me the blood types of the entire population of a mountain village. The blood types are M, N, MN, and a total of 86. Wait, wait, the way it's written is a bit confusing. Oh wait, no, I think each blood type is represented by the alleles. So for example, type M could be M^M and M^N, and type N could be M^M and N^N. Wait, but no, wait. Actually, blood types are determined by the presence of the ABO antigens on the RBCs. But I'm a bit confused about how the alleles work here.

Wait, the question is about the frequency of L^M and L^N alleles. So each blood type has two alleles. For example, an individual with blood type M would have two M alleles, or one M and one m? Wait, no, I think the notation here is a bit different. Wait, wait. Let me think. The way it's written, the possible blood types are M, N, and MN. So perhaps each letter represents the presence of a dominant allele. Oh, wait, I think this is about hemi-sisomies, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, I think blood types are determined by the presence of the ABO antigens. The ABO system has two alleles, A and B. Each person has two alleles, which can be either AA, Aa, or aa. The A allele produces the A antigen, and the B allele produces the B antigen. The blood type is determined by the presence of these antigens.

But wait, the question is about L^M and L^N alleles. So perhaps each blood type is represented by two alleles: for example, blood type M could have alleles L^M and L^M (homozygous), or maybe L^M and L^N (heterozygous). Similarly for N. Hmm, the question is confusing because it refers to L^M and L^N alleles, but in blood types, the letters are usually A, B, etc. Wait, perhaps the letters here are alleles. So perhaps the first letter is the dominant allele, and the second is recessive. Wait, but the question says the last character, so perhaps it's a typo, and maybe it's referring to the presence of a dominant or recessive allele.

Wait, perhaps the blood types given are M, N, and MN. So each individual has two alleles. Let me think about the possible alleles for each blood type.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this systematically.

The problem states that the blood types are M, N, and MN, with a total population of 86. But wait, how is this possible? Because blood types are M, N, and MN, which are three possible types. But the total is 86. Oh, wait, perhaps MN is a typo and it's supposed to be 'M' and 'N' in some way. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake in the question and the correct letters are A, B, C. But perhaps I need to proceed with the given data.

Wait, perhaps the blood types are M, N, and MN, each representing a different genotype. Let's suppose that each blood type corresponds to a genotype. For example:

- Blood type M could be M^M M^N (heterozygous) or M^M M^M (homozygous), but wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the blood types are represented as M and N, and each individual has two alleles. Let's think about it as each blood type being a genotype consisting of two alleles.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The question gives the blood types as M, N, and MN. So perhaps each blood type is a genotype. For example:

- Blood type M: M M (homozygous dominant)
- Blood type N: N N (homozygous recessive)
- Blood type MN: M N (heterozygous)

But wait, that might not fit the standard ABO system, but perhaps in this question, the letters are the alleles. Alternatively, maybe the blood types are represented as M and N, each having their own alleles. Wait, perhaps each blood type is a combination of the alleles.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let's try to approach the problem. The question is about the frequency of the L^M and L^N alleles. Wait, but in blood type terminology, the letters are usually A, B, etc. Hmm, perhaps in this question, the letters are the alleles. So 'L^M' and 'L^N' are alleles, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the letters M and N are the two different alleles for some gene, perhaps the M and N genes. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different system, but perhaps the question is about the M and N alleles, not the A and B. So maybe in this question, the blood type is determined by two alleles: M and N. So each person has two alleles, each being M or N. But how do they combine? Let's think.

Wait, perhaps each blood type is a genotype consisting of two alleles. So for example:

- Blood type M: M M (homozygous)
- Blood type N: N N (homozygous)
- Blood type MN: M N (heterozygous)

But wait, that can't be right because in reality, blood type MN would be M and N, but in this question, the blood types are M, N, and MN. Wait, maybe the question is that the blood types are M, N, and MN, regardless of what they stand for. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is about the blood types being represented by their genes, and the alleles being M and N.

Wait, the question asks for the frequency of the L^M and L^N alleles. But in the given data, the blood types are M, N, and MN, with a total of 86. So perhaps the way to approach this is to count the number of each type and then determine the number of each allele.

Wait, let's break it down. The blood types are M, N, and MN, and the total is 86. So each blood type contributes a certain number of alleles.

If the blood types are M, N, and MN, then:

Number of M blood types: 53
Number of N blood types: 4
Number of MN blood types: 29

Wait, but that adds up to 53 +4 +29=86, which matches. So each of these corresponds to the number of individuals with each blood type.

Now, each individual has two alleles. So the total number of alleles is 86 *2= 172.

Now, each blood type contributes a certain number of allele counts.

So, each individual with blood type M has two M alleles. So 53 individuals contribute 53 * 2 = 106 M alleles.

Each individual with blood type N has two N alleles. So 4 individuals contribute 4 *2=8 N alleles.

Each individual with blood type MN has one M allele and one N allele. So 29 individuals contribute 29 *1=29 M alleles and 29 *1=29 N alleles.

So total M alleles: 106 +29=135

Total N alleles:8 +29=37

Total alleles: 135 +37=172, which matches.

Now, the question is about the frequency of the L^M and L^N alleles. Wait, but in the given data, M and N are the blood types. So perhaps in this question, M and N are the alleles, not the blood types. That is, each individual has two alleles, M and N. But wait, that's not correct because in reality, blood types are determined by two alleles, and the presence of each allele leads to a different phenotype.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. The question is about the L^M and L^N alleles. But in the problem statement, the blood types are M, N, and MN. So perhaps the letters M and N refer to the alleles. So each individual has two alleles, M and N. So the blood types are determined by the presence of these alleles.

Wait, no. Let me think again: if each individual has two alleles, M and N, then the possible blood types would be:

- MM: blood type M
- NN: blood type N
- MN: blood type MN

In that case, the blood types M, N, and MN would correspond to these genotypes. But the question is about the frequency of L^M and L^N alleles. Perhaps the letters M and N in the question are the alleles, and the blood types are represented by the presence of these alleles.

Wait, but the question states that the blood types are M, N, MN, and the total is 86. So perhaps each individual has two alleles, each being either M or N. So let's reevaluate.

Each individual has two alleles. So for example, if someone is homozygous for M (MM), they have two M alleles. If they're heterozygous (MN), they have one M and one N. If they're homozygous for N (NN), they have two N alleles.

So the total number of each allele can be calculated based on the number of each genotype.

But in the given data, the blood types are M, N, and MN. So their counts are:

M:53
N:4
MN:29

Wait, but if each MN person has one M and one N allele, then the total number of M alleles is:

Each M person has two M alleles →53 *2=106

Each MN person has one M allele →29 *1=29

So total M alleles: 106 +29=135

Similarly, each N person has two N alleles →4 *2=8

Each MN person has one N allele →29 *1=29

Total N alleles:8 +29=37

Total alleles:135 +37=172 → which is correct because 86 individuals ×2=172.

Now, the question asks for the frequency of the L^M and L^N alleles.

Wait, wait, the question says "frequency of the L^M and L^N alleles"—but in this scenario, the alleles are M and N. So perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again.

The question says: The last character of your response must be the letter you've chosen.

The question is about the frequency of the L^M and L^N alleles in the population.

Wait, maybe it's a typo, and it should be M and N alleles. Let me proceed under that assumption.

So, frequency of L^M allele: No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps L is another letter. Or is it a typo, and they meant M and N alleles.

Assuming that L is a typo, and they meant M and N.

So, the alleles are M and N.

So, the frequency of allele M is total M alleles divided by total alleles.

Similarly, frequency of allele N is total N alleles divided by total alleles.

In our calculation, total M alleles is 135, total N alleles is 37.

Total alleles: 172.

So frequency of M allele: 135/172 ≈ 0.785 or 78.5%

Frequency of N allele: 37/172 ≈ 0.215 or 21.5%

Looking at the answer choices, let's see.

Looking at the options, option I is frequency L^M = .785, L^N = .215. But wait, in this problem, the alleles are M and N, which would correspond to the frequencies of 78.5% and 21.5%, respectively.

Looking at the options, option I says L^M is 78.5% and L^N is 21.5%. So the answer would be option I.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option I: L^M = .785, L^N = .215.

So yes, that's correct. So the answer is option I.
</think>

The question involves determining the frequency of the alleles L^M and L^N in a population based on the blood types M, N, and MN. The total population is 86 individuals. Each blood type corresponds to a genotype, and the alleles are distributed as follows:

1. **Blood Type M**: 53 individuals, each with two M alleles.  
   - Total M alleles: \( 53 \times 2 = 106 \).

2. **Blood Type N**: 4 individuals, each with two N alleles.  
   - Total N alleles: \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \).

3. **Blood Type MN**: 29 individuals, each with one M and one N allele.  
   - Total M alleles: \( 29 \times 1 = 29 \).  
   - Total N alleles: \( 29 \times 1 = 29 \).

**Total Alleles**:  
- Total M alleles: \( 106 + 29 = 135 \).  
- Total N alleles: \( 8 + 29 = 37 \).  
- Total alleles: \( 135 + 37 = 172 \).

**Frequency of Alleles**:  
- Frequency of L^M allele: \( \frac{135}{172} \approx 0.785 \) or 78.5%.  
- Frequency of L^N allele: \( \frac{37}{172} \approx 0.215 \) or 21.5%.

From the options provided, the frequency of L^M = 0.785 and L^N = 0.215 corresponds to **Option I**.
