Okay, so I have to figure out which external environment factor Robert is influenced by in his promotional campaign. The question is about the last character of the answer, so I need to pick one from the options provided.

Let me read the question again. Robert is a marketer for a global consumer products company. He's designing a promotional campaign aimed at a new international market. He's ensuring the campaign is clearly understood and doesn't offend anyone. The question is about which external factor he's influenced by.

The options given are A to J, each representing different external environments. So, I'm thinking about what factors influence promotional efforts in a global context.

First, the options are:

A: Economic environment
B: Socio-cultural environment
C: Geographic environment
D: Political environment
E: Competitive environment
F: Legal environment
G: Technological environment
H: Natural environment
I: International environment
J: Demographic environment

Hmm, Robert is targeting a new international market. So, he's probably dealing with a global environment. So, factors related to the global context would be relevant.

Looking at each option:

A: Economic environment—this affects purchasing power, costs, etc., which is part of the global market. So, yes, this could influence campaigns.

B: Socio-cultural environment—this refers to the cultural norms and values in the target region. If the target culture is different, it might affect how the campaign is received.

C: Geographic environment—this is about location, geography, and infrastructure. So, the physical aspects of the campaign in different regions would be part of this.

D: Political environment—this includes laws, regulations, and political changes. Companies need to navigate these to avoid issues.

E: Competitive environment—this relates to competitors in the same market. If competitors are well-established, it might affect Robert's campaign.

F: Legal environment—this includes the laws and regulations in the market. Compliance is crucial for any campaign.

G: Technological environment—this is about the technology available. If the target market is tech-savvy, it might affect how the campaign uses digital elements.

H: Natural environment—this is more about the natural resources available, which might not be directly related here.

I: International environment—this is a broad term, encompassing all the other factors. So, it's a general category, but since it's one of the options, it's a possibility.

J: Demographic environment—this involves the age, gender, and population structure of the target audience. If the target is a younger demographic, it might affect the campaign's approach.

Now, Robert is making sure the campaign is understood and not offensive. So, he's probably considering how the campaign is perceived in different regions. Factors in the environment affect how people perceive and respond to his campaign.

For example, the economic environment can influence the cost of the campaign, which in turn affects how people perceive the value. Similarly, the geographic environment affects the logistics—where the campaign is launched, how it's delivered, etc.

The competitive environment affects how Robert's campaign stacks up against others. A strong competitive edge would allow him to reach his target effectively.

The political environment might influence the campaign's feasibility, such as dealing with trade barriers or regulatory compliance.

The legal environment is crucial because companies must comply with local laws, which could affect campaign messaging and credibility.

The technological environment might change how the campaign is delivered, maybe via digital channels, which could influence its effectiveness.

The international environment is general, but the other options are more specific factors. Since Robert is addressing a new market, the most relevant factors would be those that cover global aspects.

Looking at the options, I think the best fit is the international environment (I) or international environment (I). Wait, the options are I: International environment, which is a broader term. But the question is which factor he's being influenced by, and I think each option is a specific factor.

Wait, the question says, "By which of the factors in the external environment is he being influenced." So, each option is a factor, and Robert is influenced by one of these.

If he's working on a new international market, the most relevant factor might be the international environment, which encompasses the global aspects. However, the options are specific, so perhaps I is the correct answer.

Alternatively, the factors are:

A. Economic

B. Socio cultural

C. Geographical

D. Political

E. Competitive

F. Legal

G. Technological

H. Natural

I. International

J. Demographic

So, Robert is working in a new international market, so the external environment is global. Since the options include I: International environment, which is a broader category, but I think it's a possible answer.

Wait, but the question is asking which factor he is influenced by. So, perhaps the factors are the specific aspects of the environment. So, the 'international' environment is one of the options, so I think the correct answer is I.
