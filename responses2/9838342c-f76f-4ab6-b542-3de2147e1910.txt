Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about Perestroika and the options given. Let me read the passage carefully first.

The passage says that Perestroika, or Restructuring, is an urgent necessity for our socialist society. The country is ripe for change, and the people are waiting for it. If they don't start it soon, things could get worse and cause serious social, economic, or political problems.

Then it talks about Mikhail Gorbachev, who wrote about this in 1987. He must be referring to Gorbachev's perspective on how the restructuring should be done.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the one that best describes what Gorbachev argued about restructuring the Soviet Union.

Option A says it wasn't urgent. Well, the passage says it was urgent because the people are waiting. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B states it was forced by external factors. The passage doesn't mention anything about external factors; it's about the urgent nature of the situation. So B might not be right.

Option C claims restructuring would exacerbate the situation. The passage says restructuring would cause more crises, so C seems correct.

Option D says it would have no impact. No, restructuring would lead to problems, so D is wrong.

Option E says restructuring was necessary to avoid the collapse. The passage doesn't mention the possibility of the collapse, just that restructuring was urgent. So E is not supported.

Option F says it was to appease the masses. The passage doesn't suggest that; it's about being necessary, not about purpose. So F is incorrect.

Option G says restructuring would lead to a collapse. The passage says restructuring would cause crises, not a collapse, so G is wrong.

Option H says restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis. The passage says it's urgent and leads to crises, so H is correct.

Option I says it's inevitable. The passage doesn't state that; it's a matter of urgency, not a certainty. So I's probably incorrect.

Option J says restructuring would strengthen the economy. The passage doesn't mention economic impact; it's more about the need to change the system, leading to problems. So J is not supported.

Wait, but which is the best answer? Let me think again.

The passage says that restructuring would lead to "extacerbated the situation." So option C is correct. Alternatively, option H says restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis. The passage says restructuring was urgent, which likely meant it was necessary to avoid collapse. So H is correct.

But wait, the passage doesn't explicitly say that restructuring would avoid the collapse. It's more of a general statement about the urgency. So perhaps the best answer is option C.

Wait, the options are about what Gorbachev argued. Since the passage says restructuring was urgent, which I think means it was necessary. So H says restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis. The passage says "it's urgent, which would lead to more crises." So maybe H is correct.

I think the passage's main point is that restructuring is urgent, leading to problems, but the passage doesn't specify that it's necessary to avoid the collapse. It's more about the necessity to change, leading to problems. So the best answer might be option C or H.

Wait, let's read the passage again: "It has long been yearning for it. Any delay in beginning perestroika could have led to an exacerbated internal situation in the near future, which, to put it bluntly, would have been fraught with serious social, economic, and political crises." So restructuring is urgent, and any delay would cause crises. So the restructuring was necessary and caused crises, but the passage isn't stating that it's necessary to avoid a crisis. So perhaps the answer is H, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, the question asks what Gorbachev argued. He's the one making the argument, so his stance is about what he believed restructuring should be. The passage describes the necessity, but doesn't directly state Gorbachev's stance. Wait, the passage is from Gorbachev's work, so he's a key figure in the argument.

So the passage says that restructuring is urgent because the situation is urgent. Any delay would cause more crises. So the passage is making a general statement, not Gorbachev's stance. Hmm, perhaps the question is about Gorbachev's view, which is that restructuring was necessary, leading to more crises but not necessarily avoiding a crisis. So the correct answer would be H: restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis. But the passage doesn't say that. It says it's urgent, so the restructuring was necessary, leading to problems but not avoiding a collapse. So perhaps the best option is that restructuring was necessary, leading to more problems but perhaps the passage doesn't specify avoidance.

Wait, the question is about what Gorbachev argued. Since the passage is about his argument, the question is about what he thought.

Wait, the question is, "from the passage, one may infer that Gorbachev argued that..." So the passage is Gorbachev's argument, so what does it say.

The passage says restructuring is urgent because the situation is urgent. It doesn't say that restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis. It just says that any delay would cause more crises. So the passage doesn't state that it was necessary to avoid a crisis. So perhaps the correct answer is H is incorrect because it's not about avoiding a crisis, but about being necessary to avoid a crisis. Because the passage implies that the situation is urgent, so restructuring was necessary. So H is correct.

Wait, but the passage says that restructuring was urgent. So the answer must be about necessity.

Alternatively, perhaps the passage is implying that restructuring is urgent and necessary, leading to more crises. So the answer is C, which says restructuring would exacerbate the situation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to restate.

The passage states that restructuring is urgent. Any delay would lead to more crises. So the restructuring was necessary because the situation is urgent. So Gorbachev's argument is that restructuring is urgent, so it's necessary.

Wait, but the question is about what he argued. Since the passage is about his argument, the correct answer would be C: restructuring would exacerbate the situation.

Alternatively, H says restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis, but the passage doesn't state that. It just says any delay would cause more crises. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the passage says that any delay would lead to more crises. It doesn't say that restructuring leads to avoidance. So perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about this again.

The passage says that restructuring is urgent because the situation is urgent. It's about the need to change, leading to problems. So the answer would be that restructuring was necessary, leading to more crises, but not necessarily avoidance.

But the question is about what Gorbachev argued. Since the passage is Gorbachev's argument, the answer must be based on that. The passage states that restructuring is urgent and would lead to more crises, but doesn't specify whether it was necessary to avoid a crisis.

So the options might be:

C: restructuring would exacerbate the situation.

H: restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis.

The passage doesn't say that restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis. It says that any delay would cause more crises, but doesn't specify avoidance.

So perhaps the correct answer is C, because it's about the necessity, leading to more crises, rather than avoidance.

Alternatively, the passage doesn't state that restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis. It just says it's urgent, so restructuring was necessary.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H. Because the passage says restructuring was urgent, so it was necessary. So the answer is H: restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis.

But the passage doesn't say it's necessary to avoid a crisis. It just says that any delay would cause more crises. So perhaps the answer is C. Because it's about the necessity, not avoidance.

Alternatively, the passage's focus is on the urgency, not on the necessity of avoiding a crisis.

Wait, perhaps the best answer is H: restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis. Because the passage says that restructuring is urgent, which implies it's necessary, but the passage doesn't state that it's necessary to avoid a crisis. So maybe H is not the right answer.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think of each option.

Option C: restructuring would exacerbate the situation. The passage says restructuring would lead to more crises, so this is correct.

Option H: restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis. The passage doesn't say this. It says that restructuring is urgent, which suggests the necessity, not the avoidance.

So the correct answer is C: restructuring would exacerbate the situation.

The passage discusses the urgent necessity of restructuring in a socialist society, emphasizing that any delay would lead to more crises. It does not explicitly state that restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis but highlights the urgency and the resulting problems. Based on this, the best answer aligns with the idea that restructuring would exacerbate the situation.

Answer: C
