Okay, so I've got this law question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a lawsuit where a plaintiff is suing a utility company. The company owns a reservoir that's open to the public as a recreation site, based on a license from a federal agency. The plaintiff dove into the reservoir and hit an unmarked submerged island. The plaintiff claims the company was negligent in failing to mark the island.

The options are opinions by the plaintiff's expert, and I need to figure out which one the court would most likely admit.

Hmm. So, the key issue is negligence in the reservoir. The plaintiff argues that the company didn't mark the island, leading to negligence.

When a plaintiff is suing a company, the standard of proof is usually "negligence." So, the company needs to prove that they were negligent in their actions. But the issue here is whether the plaintiff's expert opinion supports that.

Looking at the experts' opinions:

A: "The plaintiff could have avoided the accident if he was more cautious." This seems more like a liability argument, probably not the main defense. It's more about the plaintiff's own caution, not negligence.

B: "The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent." Contributional negligence is a concept where the plaintiff's actions contributed to the plaintiff's injury. If the plaintiff's actions were a significant part of the injury, they can argue that it's not entirely their fault. But I'm not sure how that would be relevant in a negligence case. This might be more about the plaintiff's own fault, not the company's negligence.

C: "The accident probably occurred in the manner shown by this computer-animated film I made." This sounds like the plaintiff is asserting that the accident was a result of poor planning or that the company's actions were not adequately marked. If the expert says that, it would support the plaintiff's case because it's pointing to the company's negligence.

D: "The company's negligence is a result of poor management." This seems like another way of saying the company was negligent, perhaps citing poor management as a cause.

E: "The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300." This is a causation argument. The plaintiff is saying that if the company had marked the island, it could have prevented the accident. This would prove negligence because it shows a plausible cause for the accident.

F: "The company was required by federal law to mark the island." This is a factual issue. The plaintiff is claiming they didn't get the required markings. This is more about the facts being as the case goes.

G: "The federal agency is responsible for this accident." This is a liability issue. The plaintiff is arguing that the company was negligent in failing to follow the agency's license. So, they'd argue that the company's failure to mark caused the accident.

H: "The company is responsible for all accidents in the reservoir." This is a full liability claim. The company is covering all possible accidents, which is a broad claim.

I: "The company was not required by federal law to mark the island." The plaintiff is saying they weren't required, so the company didn't have to follow the license. This is a factual issue, but it's more about whether the company was required to mark it in the first place.

Now, the question is which opinion is the court most likely to admit. The court's ruling will depend on the evidence presented. Since the plaintiff is using an expert opinion, the court's decision depends on whether the expert supported the plaintiff's case.

So, the options that the expert would present are mainly about negligence or liability. If the expert's opinion supports the plaintiff's case, like E or F, or B, then the court would likely admit it.

Looking at the options, E says that the company could have marked the island, which would support the plaintiff's case. If the expert says that, it would be a strong endorsement of the plaintiff's claim for negligence.

Option H is a factual question whether the company was required. If the company wasn't required, then the plaintiff's case for negligence wouldn't hold. But the expert might argue that even if they were not required, they were still negligent for failing to mark.

Wait, but the plaintiff's case is based on negligence. If the company didn't have to follow the license, that's a factual issue, but the court's rule is about negligence.

In this case, the plaintiff's expert is trying to show the company's negligence. So, if the expert says that the accident could have been avoided (E), then the court would likely admit that. Because it's a causation argument that shows the accident was a result of the company's failure to mark.

Alternatively, if the expert says that the accident was in the manner shown by a film (C), that would also support the plaintiff's case because it shows that the accident was caused by the company's negligence.

But the options are about the opinion by the expert. So, which of these is the most likely to be admitted.

The expert would probably argue that the accident was caused by the company's failure to mark, which would support the plaintiff's claim. So, the court would likely admit the plaintiff's case if the expert supports it.

In that case, which of the options supports the plaintiff's claim? Let's think:

If the expert says that the accident could have been avoided if the company had marked the island, that would be a strong argument for the plaintiff's claim. So, E or I? Wait, I is about being required to mark. But the plaintiff's expert is focusing on negligence, not liability.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the differing standards. Contributional negligence and causation are different. Contributional negligence is when the plaintiff's actions were a significant part of the injury. The plaintiff's claim here is contributorily negligent if their actions were a significant part of the accident. But the court is more likely to accept a causation-based case rather than a contribution-based one.

But the options are about what the expert would say. So, the expert's opinion would likely be about whether the accident was caused by the company's negligence (like in E) or that the company acted improperly (like in C or I).

So, the court would likely admit the plaintiff's case if the expert supports it. For example, if the expert says E is true, that the accident could have been avoided, then the court would accept that the company's negligence was a factor. Alternatively, if the expert says that the accident was the result of poor management (D), that would also support the claim.

But looking at the options, both E and I are about the company's actions. E is causation, I is about the requirement of marking.

Wait, the question is about which opinion by the expert is the court most likely to admit. The options are each possible opinion.

So, the court's decision is based on the evidence presented. The expert's opinion is likely to be an opinion that supports the plaintiff's claim. For example, if the expert says that the accident was due to the company's failure to mark the island, that would support the plaintiff's claim for negligence.

Therefore, the court would most likely admit the expert's opinion if it supports the plaintiff's claim.

So, looking for which option would be the expert's opinion. For example, option E says "The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300." That would support the claim that the accident was due to negligence.

Alternatively, option I says the company was not required, which is a factual issue, but the expert might argue that the company did fail to mark, so the plaintiff's claim would still be valid as a negligence case.

So, the court would admit the expert's opinion if it's about the plaintiff's claim. So, perhaps option E is the correct one because it's a causation-based argument.

Wait, but the plaintiff's case is about the company's negligence. So, if the expert says that the accident could have been avoided (E), that would support the claim. If the expert says the company was required to mark (I), that's a factual issue, but the court would still consider it as negligence if the company didn't mark, leading to the accident. But the expert would likely say that the accident was due to the company's failure to mark, not because of the fact of the requirement.

So, the court would likely admit the expert saying that the accident could have been avoided, thus supporting the plaintiff's claim for negligence.

So, the correct answer is option E.

The question revolves around determining which opinion by the plaintiff's expert opinion would be most likely admissible in a negligence case against the utility company. The plaintiff alleges that the company failed to mark a submerged island, claiming negligence. The expert's opinion must support this claim.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A**: Focuses on the plaintiff's caution, not negligence, making it unlikely to support the claim.
- **B**: Discusses contributorial negligence, which is more about the plaintiff's own fault than the company's negligence.
- **C**: Argues that the accident was a result of poor planning as shown by a film, supporting the company's negligence.
- **D**: Suggests the company's negligence stems from poor management, which could support the claim.
- **E**: Proposes that the accident could have been avoided if the company marked the island, directly supporting the plaintiff's claim for negligence.
- **F**: Focuses on federal law requirements, which are factual but do not address the company's negligence.
- **G**: Argues the company was liable for all accidents, a broad liability claim not directly supported by the plaintiff's evidence.
- **H**: Suggests the company wasn't required to mark, which is a factual issue but not a negligence claim.
- **I**: Claims the company wasn't required by law to mark, another factual issue not directly relevant to the claim.

### Conclusion:
The expert's opinion most likely to support the plaintiff's claim is **E**, as it directly demonstrates the company's negligence by showing the accident could have been avoided if the island were marked. This aligns with the standard of proof in negligence cases, where the plaintiff must prove their actions were a significant part of the injury.
