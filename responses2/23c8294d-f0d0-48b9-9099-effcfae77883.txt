Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see. I need to determine the weights of CO2 and H2O produced when 104 grams of C2H2 burns. The equation given is 2 C2H2 + 5 O2 → 4 CO2 + 2 H2O. The molecular weights are CO2=44 and H2O=18. The options are A to J, each giving different grams for CO2 and H2O. 

Alright, so first, I think I should find out how much CO2 and H2O are produced based on the amount of C2H2. Let's start by figuring out the molar masses involved. 

Wait, wait, wait. The molecular weight of C2H2 is (2*12) + 2*(1) = 24 + 2 = 26 g/mol. But the problem gives C2H2's mass as 104 grams. Oh, but wait, maybe the given mass is correct, but I don't think I need the molecular weight of C2H2 itself because that's the reactant. Instead, I need to use the masses of the products based on the reactant.

Wait, but in the reaction, 2 moles of C2H2 produce 4 moles of CO2 and 2 moles of H2O. So the stoichiometric ratio is 2:4:2, which simplifies to 1:2:1. So for every mole of C2H2, you get 2 moles of CO2 and 1 mole of H2O.

So, first, I'll calculate the moles of C2H2. Moles = mass / molar mass. But wait, hold on, the molar mass of C2H2 is 26 g/mol. So 104 g / 26 g/mol = 4 moles. 

Wait, yes: 104 divided by 26 is 4. Because 26 * 4 is 104.

So 4 moles of C2H2. According to the equation, each mole gives 2 moles of CO2 and 1 mole of H2O. So for 4 moles, CO2 is 4 * 2 = 8 moles, and H2O is 4 *1 =4 moles.

Now, I need to calculate the mass of CO2 and H2O from the moles. CO2's molar mass is 44 g/mol, so 8 moles * 44 g/mol = 352 grams. H2O is 18 g/mol, so 4 *18 =72 grams.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 352g CO2 and 72g H2O. So that would be the answer. 

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn’t make a mistake.

Molar mass of C2H2 is 26, correct. 104g /26 =4 moles. Reaction gives 4 CO2 and 2 H2O. Wait, no, wait, the reaction is 2 C2H2 → 4 CO2 + 2 H2O. So 2 moles of C2H2 →4 CO2 and 2 H2O. So per mole of C2H2, you get 2 CO2 and 1 H2O.

So 4 moles of C2H2 would give 8 moles of CO2 and 4 moles of H2O. So CO2 mass is 8 *44 = 352g, H2O is 4*18=72g. So option C matches that. 

Looking at the given options, option C is 352g CO2 and 72g of H2O. So I think that's correct. But wait, wait, are the reaction coefficients correct? The equation is 2C2H2 +5 O2 →4 CO2 + 2 H2O. Oh wait, but when I have 4 moles of C2H2, that's 2 moles of the reaction as written. So, yes, 2 moles in the reaction gives 4 CO2 and 2 H2O. So 4 moles is 2 reactions, so 2*(4 CO2 and 2 H2O) = 8 CO2 and 4 H2O. 

So yes, that's correct. So the answer must be option C: 352g CO2 and 72g H2O.

To determine the weights of CO₂ and H₂O produced when 104 g of C₂H₂ burns, we start by calculating the moles of C₂H₂. The molar mass of C₂H₂ is 26 g/mol, so:

\[
\text{Moles of } C_2H_2 = \frac{104 \, \text{g}}{26 \, \text{g/mol}} = 4 \, \text{moles}.
\]

From the balanced chemical equation:

\[
2C_2H_2 + 5O_2 \rightarrow 4CO_2 + 2H_2O,
\]

we see that 2 moles of C₂H₂ produce 4 moles of CO₂ and 2 moles of H₂O. This simplifies to 1 mole of C₂H₂ producing 2 moles of CO₂ and 1 mole of H₂O. Therefore, 4 moles of C₂H₂ will produce:

\[
\text{Moles of } CO_2 = 4 \times 2 = 8 \, \text{moles},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of } H_2O = 4 \times 1 = 4 \, \text{moles}.
\]

Next, we calculate the masses of CO₂ and H₂O using their molar masses (44 g/mol for CO₂ and 18 g/mol for H₂O):

\[
\text{Mass of } CO_2 = 8 \, \text{moles} \times 44 \, \text{g/mol} = 352 \, \text{g},
\]
\[
\text{Mass of } H_2O = 4 \, \text{moles} \times 18 \, \text{g/mol} = 72 \, \text{g}.
\]

Thus, the weights of CO₂ and H₂O produced are 352 g and 72 g, respectively. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: 352 g of CO₂ and 72 g of H₂O.**
