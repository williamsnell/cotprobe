Question:

A married couple sued a real estate broker for misrepresentation and breach of contract in failing to live up to promises he made regarding the couple's purchase of a residence. They claimed receiving promises from the broker that if they bought the home immediately a $15,000 rebate would be given to them at closing by the sellers. At closing, the sellers claimed no knowledge and didn't pay. At trial against the broker, the couple subpoenaed one of the broker's agents who testified that he was in a meeting with the buyers and he heard the broker make the same promise. The broker objected that the testimony was hearsay. What will the court most likely decide regarding the admissibility of the testimony?

Options:

A: The testimony is admissible  even though it is hearsay, the broker is available to be cross-examined.
B: The testimony is admissible because the agent's statement is considered a present sense impression.
C: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent's statement is considered hearsay within hearsay.
D: The testimony is admissible because it is a party admission made through the party's authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment.
E: The testimony is admissible because it is a statement made by the broker's employee during the course and within the scope of employment.
F: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent's statement is not an exception to the hearsay rule.
G: The testimony is admissible because it is a statement made by a co-conspirator during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.
H: The testimony is inadmissible because it is pure hearsay offered to prove the truth of the matter that is in dispute.
I: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent was not authorized to speak for his principal.
J: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent's statement is considered a past recollection recorded.

Okay, so I've got this real property law question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, a married couple sued a real estate broker for misrepresentation and breach of contract. They're claiming that the broker promised a $15,000 rebate at closing, but the sellers didn't pay. They subpoenaed an agent, who testified that the broker was in a meeting and the broker made the same promise. The broker objected that the testimony is hearsay. The question is about the admissibility of the testimony.

I remember that hearsay has specific exceptions. The main exceptions are: necessity, time, and place. If the statement is hearsay and doesn't fit any of these, it's inadmissible. Also, sometimes statements made by someone else in a certain role can be exceptions, like if it's made by an agent authorized by the party.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the testimony is admissible even though it's hearsay, and the broker is available for cross-examination. That seems possible if it's an exception.

Option B mentions present sense impression. I think present sense impression is another exception, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Option C says the testimony is inadmissible because it's hearsay within hearsay. Wait, if the statement is made within the course of the agent's employment, doesn't that make it a hearsay exception? So if it's within the scope of employment, maybe it can be admitted. So C says it's inadmissible, but maybe it's admissible as an exception.

Option D says it's a party admission made through the party's agent within the scope of employment. That sounds like it's covered by the exception for party admissions.

Option E mentions it's a statement by an employee during employment. That's another way to use the employment exception.

Option F says the statement is pure hearsay. No, because the agent spoke, so it's not hearsay. So F is wrong.

Option G and H talk about co-conspirators and past recollection. Those are less relevant here because the issue is about hearsay exceptions and whether the statement was made under any circumstances.

So, the key points are: the agent testified that the broker made a promise at closing. The agent's statement is hearsay unless it's an exception.

The question is whether the statement is hearsay and if it's admissible. The hearsay issue is about whether it's within the scope of the exception.

In the case of an agent, if the agent was authorized to speak, then it's an exception, making it admissible. But if the agent was not authorized, it's not.

Wait, but the question doesn't say anything about the agent's authorization. However, the agent testified that the broker was speaking. So if the agent was an authorized agent (like a property agent), then it's admissible as an exception.

So looking at the options, option A says the testimony is admissible because it's hearsay but the agent is available. So A is correct.

Option C says it's inadmissible because it's hearsay within hearsay. Wait, that's a misapplication of the hearsay exception. If the statement is made within the scope of employment, it can be admitted as an exception, not as hearsay. So C is incorrect.

Another point: the hearsay exception for the agent is when the statement is made under the authority of the agent, which would allow it to be admitted. So the exception for the agent is under the 'authority of agent' or sometimes 'in the course of his employment'.

Looking back at the options, option A says the testimony is admissible because it's hearsay but the broker is available. So that fits because the exception applies, making it admissible.

Option D and E mention that it's a party admission made through the party's agent, which is a valid exception. So D and E are also correct in that sense. But what's the exact rule?

The rule is that if an agent is speaking on the matter, and the statement is being offered to prove the facts, then it's an exception. So in this case, it's a statement made by the broker (as an agent) at the meeting. So the exception applies.

Option A says it's admissible because it's hearsay and the agent is available. So that's correct.

Option C is incorrect because if it's within the scope of employment, it's an exception.

So the correct answer should be either A or D/E.

Wait, the options: option D says it's a party admission made through the party's agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment. Option E says it's a statement made by the broker's employee during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.

Wait, the problem states that the couple claimed the seller's promise, and the agent testified that the broker made the promise. The broker objected that it's hearsay.

So the key is whether the statement is hearsay or not. Since the agent was an authorized agent, the statement is within the scope of employment, thus admissible as an exception.

So the correct answer is A: the testimony is admissible even though it is hearsay, the broker is available to be cross-examined.

Alternatively, option D says it's a party admission made through the party's agent, which is another valid exception. So why is the option C wrong? Because C suggests it's hearsay within hearsay, which isn't applicable here. If it's within the scope of employment, it's an exception, not hearsay.

So the correct choice is either A or D. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: hearsay, agent available.

D: party admission through agent, employment scope.

I think both A and D are correct in terms of exceptions, but perhaps the way the question is phrased, A is the answer because it's about the hearsay/hum silence exception.

Wait, the question is about whether the statement is hearsay. Since the agent was speaking, it's an exception, so the testimony is admissible. So A is correct.

But wait, the couple's case is about whether the statement is hearsay. The agent is an authorized agent, so the statement is admissible. So A is correct.

Wait, but the options don't have both A and D. Let me read the options again.

Looking at the choices, option A says the testimony is admissible, and the agent is available.

Option D says the testimony is admissible because it's a party admission made through the party's agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment.

Both A and D seem valid, but the options are separate. Maybe the intended correct answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, as the statement is a party admission, which is a valid exception.

Wait, but I think the correct exception is the 'authority of agent' or 'in the course of his employment'. So for the agent's testimony, if they were an agent authorized by the party, the statement is an exception. So A is correct.

Wait, but the options are separate. Let me think again.

The issue is whether the statement is hearsay. Since the agent was an authorized agent, the statement is an exception, so it's admissible. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but the options are:

A: hearsay, agent available.

So the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is D because it's a party admission. But the correct exception is 'in the course of his employment', which is option D.

Wait, looking again, I think the correct answer is A because the statement is hearsay but within the scope of employment, making it admissible as an exception. So the answer is A.

The issue revolves around the admissibility of a statement made by an agent in a real estate transaction, which is otherwise hearsay. The key legal principle at play is the hearsay exception, specifically the "authority of agent" or "in the course of employment" exception. If the agent was authorized to speak and the statement was offered to prove the truth of the matter (the $15,000 rebate), it fits the exception. Therefore, the testimony is admissible as an exception.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct. The testimony is hearsay but admissible as an exception due to the agent's authority.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Present sense impression is not an exception to hearsay.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The statement is not hearsay within hearsay; it's within the scope of employment.
- **Option D**: Partially correct but less precise. While the statement is a party admission, the correct exception is the "in the course of employment" rule.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Past recollection is not an exception to hearsay.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The statement is not hearsay because the agent testified.
- **Option G and H**: Unrelated to the hearsay exception.
- **Options I and J**: Incorrect. The statement is not pure hearsay.

The most accurate answer is **Option A**, as it correctly identifies the exception and the agent's authority.

ANSWER: A
