Okay, so I've got this question about circuits and how adding more lamps in parallel affects the current. Hmm, let's think. I remember from school that when you connect resistors or other components in parallel, they share the same circuit, right? So the same voltage goes across each one, but the current splits among them.

Wait, the question is about current in the power source. So if the lamps are in parallel, the voltage across each lamp is the same as the power source voltage. But what about the current? I think in parallel, the total current is the sum of the currents through each lamp. Because each lamp has its own path, so more lamps should mean more current flowing through the source.

So as more lamps are added, each one's current increases because the total current is the sum. So the current doesn't go down; it goes up. That would mean the current increases, so the answer should be A: increases.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose each lamp contributes some current. If I add another lamp, the same voltage across it (assuming it's the same power source) means more current because V=IR, so I = V/R. If R is the same, then more lamps mean higher R, so lower current per lamp. But wait, no, wait. Each lamp's R depends on its type. But if the lamps are identical, each would have the same R. So if I have more lamps, each would have the same R as before, so each contributes the same current. So the total current is (number of lamps) * (current per lamp). So yes, as more lamps, more current.

Alternatively, if the lamps were in series, adding more would mean more resistance, so lower current. But it's in parallel, so resistance is less. So the current increases.

As more lamps are connected in parallel in a circuit, the total current in the power source increases because the current splits among the lamps. Each lamp contributes to the total current, so more lamps result in a higher total current.
