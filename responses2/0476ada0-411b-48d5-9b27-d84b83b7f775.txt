Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) in horse and human cells. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, so let me think it through carefully.

Alright, the question is asking whether these two molecules would be the same in horse vs. human cells. So, I need to compare their structures and what they do.

First, I remember that tRNA has two main parts: the anticodon and the codon. The anticodon is complementary to the mRNA's codon, right? So, the codon is the same on both, but the anticodon is different. For humans, the anticodon is about 21 nucleotides long, while in horses it's shorter, maybe around 19. Oh wait, I think horse tRNA has a shorter anticodon because their mRNA is shorter, so the anticodon doesn't pair with the same sequence. So that means the anticodons are different between horse and human tRNAs.

As for mRNA, they're made from the same genes, right? So the mRNA sequence is the same in both animals. They have the same nucleotide sequence because they're transcribed from the same DNA. So mRNA would be identical between horse and human.

So looking at the options, option A says that tRNAs are the same, mRNA are different. That fits. Because the tRNAs differ, but mRNA are identical. Option A is about tRNA being same, mRNA different. So that would be correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are the tRNAs same? No, because the anticodons are different. So the tRNA's structure is different, which would mean the tRNA molecules themselves (the RNA part) are different. So option A is correct because tRNA are same? No, wait no. Wait, tRNA is a protein that's made from the same gene. Wait, no, tRNA is a part of the mRNA. Or wait, tRNA is a separate molecule. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, tRNA is a separate entity. In humans, tRNA is from the mRNA. For example, the mRNA in the nucleus has the codon, and the tRNA is the same sequence. So same mRNA for a given gene, same tRNA because it's the same protein. But the tRNA's structure is different because their anticodons are different. So the tRNA molecules (the proteins) are actually the same because same codon. But the tRNA molecules as RNA are different because the anticodons differ.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:

In humans:

- mRNA has a sequence, which is 21 nucleotides long.
- tRNA is the same sequence as the mRNA (same codon), but the tRNA is a separate RNA molecule. The tRNA has an anticodon that's complementary to the mRNA's codon. So for example, human mRNA is ATG ... (21 nucleotides), so the tRNA in the RNP has the same codon (ATG) but the anticodon is complementary. For horse, the mRNA is shorter, say 19 nucleotides, so the tRNA in the RNP has a shorter anticodon.

So the tRNA molecules (the RNA) are different because their anticodons are different. So in horse and human cells, their tRNA molecules (as RNA) are different. But the tRNAs as proteins are same, because their codon is the same. So for the question, the question is about tRNA and mRNA being the same.

Wait, the question is: "Would you expect the transfer RNA molecules and the messenger RNA molecules to be the same..." So they're asking about the RNA molecules. So the tRNA is a separate entity; the mRNA is part of the same RNA (the gene's transcript). So the tRNA would be different, and the mRNA would be same.

So, the correct option is A: tRNA are the same, mRNA are different. Because the mRNA are same, but tRNA (as RNA) are different.

Looking at the options again:

A) tRNA same, mRNA different. Yes, that's correct.

B) tRNA vary, mRNA same. No, because tRNA's anticodon is different, so their RNA structures differ.

C) tRNA and mRNA completely identical. No, because mRNA same, tRNA RNA different.

D) Both vary. No, tRNA same.

E) tRNA different, mRNA conserved. No, mRNA same.

F) tRNA function similar, but different in structure; mRNA same. No, because mRNA same.

G) tRNA and mRNA different. No, tRNA same.

H) tRNA different, mRNA same. No, the opposite.

I) tRNA and mRNA completely different. No.

J) tRNA different, mRNA same. Yes, because for tRNA, the anticodon is different, so mRNA same.

Wait, but the question is about whether the tRNA and mRNA are the same. So the mRNA would be same, but the tRNA (as RNA) would be different.

Looking at the answer options, the only one that states that tRNA are same, mRNA different is option A.

Another point: in humans and horses, the mRNA is the same because they're from the same gene. So the mRNA sequences are same. So the mRNA is same.

The tRNAs have different RNA structures because the anticodons are different. So tRNAs are different as RNA.

So the correct option is A.
</think>

The transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) are two distinct entities, but they share some similarities. Messenger RNA is synthesized from the same genetic code in both horse and human cells, meaning their nucleotide sequences are identical. However, transfer RNA molecules differ because their anticodons, which are complementary to the mRNA's codons, are not the same in horse and human cells. The anticodon length and sequence differ between the two species, leading to distinct tRNA structures. Therefore, while the mRNA sequences are identical, the tRNA molecules are different.

Option A correctly states that tRNA molecules are the same, but mRNA molecules are different. This aligns with the understanding that the tRNA's RNA structure varies due to differences in anticodon sequences, while the mRNA's nucleotide sequence remains unchanged.
