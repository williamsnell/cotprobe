Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which statement is not true. Let's go through each option one by one to check their accuracy.

The question is asking which statement is false. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me start by recalling what I know about each nutrient's deficiency in certain foods.

Option A says Vegan diets are likely to be deficient in protein. I remember that vegan diets exclude all plant-based proteins. So if you eat only animal-based foods like meat, fish, eggs, it's definitely lacking in protein. So A is true.

Option B claims that cereals are deficient in lysine. Wait, I'm trying to remember. Lysine is an amino acid that's found in proteins, like in meat, dairy, and eggs. Cereals are usually high in nitrogen containing amino acids like tryptophan and arginine. So, I think cereals are rich in amino acids, not deficient. So B says they're deficient in lysineâ€”that doesn't sound right. Maybe B is false.

Option C states that legumes are deficient in methionine. Methionine is a crucial amino acid for proteins, especially for muscle structure and growth. Legumes, like beans and lentils, are known to be deficient in methionine. So C is true.

Option D says dairy products are rich in tryptophan. Tryptophan is one of the amino acids in tryptophan protein, which is a common ingredient in dairy products. So D is true.

So putting it together:
- A is true.
- B is false because cereals are actually rich in amino acids.
- C is true.
- D is true.

The question is asking which is not true. So the incorrect statement is B.

The statement that is not true is:

**B: Cereals are deficient in lysine**

**Answer: B**
