Okay, so I've got this question about variables in a study on eating habits. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking what type of variable "whether a person eats breakfast" is. The options are A to J, each representing a different kind of variable.

First, I remember that variables can be categorized into different types. Common types include nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio, categorical, binary, etc. Let's break down each term.

So, the question is about whether someone eats breakfast. The key here is the way the question is phrased. I think "whether" is used here, which doesn't necessarily mean binary. Binary variables have just two categories, like yes/no or success/failure. But in this case, the question is about whether they eat breakfast, which could be more than two options. For example, could someone say they eat breakfast every day, sometimes, or never? So the category isn't just two; it's a broader set.

Looking at the options, B is dependent variable, which makes me think that's not right. Dependent variables are outcomes that depend on other variables. This question is about the participants' eating habits, so the eating habit is the outcome, not the variable causing it.

Option A is nominal variable. Nominal variables are categorical without any order. Like different categories without any hierarchy. But "eats breakfast" could be categorized as 'yes' or 'no,' which are two categories, making it nominal. Wait, but could it be more than two? If participants can say they never eat, sometimes, or always eat, then it's not just two categories. So perhaps it's not purely nominal.

Option C is categorical variable. Categorical variables are similar to nominal but can include order. For example, like 'never,' 'sometimes,' 'often,' etc. So in this case, the variable can have more than two categories, making it a categorical variable. So C might be the answer.

But wait, another point: the way the question is phrased. "Whether or not a person typically eats breakfast" could be interpreted as a yes/no question in a survey, which is a binary variable. Oh wait, but binary variables are a subset of categorical variables. So if the answer is yes/no, which is two categories, it's binary, but if it includes more options, it's categorical.

But the question says "whether," which isn't necessarily implying only two options. It might be open-ended, allowing for more responses. So if it's a yes/no question, then it's binary, but if it's asking for the category of their eating habit, it's a bit different.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: in a study, when you ask whether someone eats breakfast, it's often meant to categorize into 'yes' and 'no.' So the variable would be binary or categorical.

Wait, let me recall. Categorical variables can have more than two categories. For example, gender (male, female, non-binary) is categorical. So "whether they eat breakfast" could have more than two responses. So it's a categorical variable.

Another thought: a binary variable would have only two categories, so that's a subset of categorical variables. So if the question allows for more than two, it's categorical. But if the options are limited, it's binary.

Hmm, the options are A to J. Let me look back: C is categorical variable, which fits because it's more than two categories. B is dependent variable, D is discrete, E is interval, etc. So the correct answer should be C.

The variable "whether a person typically eats breakfast" is categorized as a **categorical variable** because it can encompass more than two categories, such as 'never,' 'sometimes,' or 'often,' depending on the context. This is different from a binary variable, which only has two categories. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: categorical variable**
