Okay, so I'm trying to solve this spring force problem. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that 2 J of work is needed to stretch a spring from its natural length of 30 cm to 42 cm. Then, we need to find how far beyond the natural length a force of 30 N will stretch the spring.

Hmm, I remember that Hooke's Law relates force and displacement in a spring. The formula is F = kx, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from the natural length. But wait, the problem isn't directly asking about the spring constant; it's asking about the displacement when a certain force is applied.

Wait, I think this involves the concept of potential energy stored in a spring. The work done to stretch the spring is actually the elastic potential energy stored. So the work done (2 J) equals the potential energy (1/2 k x^2), where x is the displacement.

First, let's find x. The spring is stretched from 30 cm to 42 cm, so the displacement is 12 cm. But wait, the units are in centimeters, so I should convert that to meters, right? 12 cm is 0.12 meters.

So, work done (W) is 2 J = 1/2 k x². Plugging in x=0.12 m, we can solve for k.

Wait, let me write that equation: 2 = (1/2) * k * (0.12)^2.

Solving for k: 2 = 0.5 * k * 0.0144 → 0.5 * 0.0144 is 0.0072. So 2 = 0.0072 k → k = 2 / 0.0072 → let's calculate that. 2 divided by 0.0072. Hmm, 0.0072 is 7.2e-3. So 2 / 7.2e-3 = 2000 /7.2 → wait, 2000 /7.2 is 277.777... approximately 277.78 N/m.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should double-check that calculation. 7.2 times 277 is 7.2*277 = 7*277=1939, 0.2*277=55.4 → sum to 1994.4. Close to 2000, so 2/0.0072=277.777... N/m.

So the spring constant k is approximately 277.78 N/m.

Now, the next part: how much force is needed to stretch the spring another certain distance beyond its natural length? Wait, no, the question is, a force of 30 N will keep it stretched. So, what displacement does that correspond to?

Using Hooke's Law again: F = k x. So x = F / k. F is 30 N.

So x = 30 / 277.78 → let's compute that. 30 divided by 277.78. Let me see, 277.78 is about 277.778, which is roughly 277.78. So 30 / 277.78 → approximately 0.108 meters, because 277.78 * 0.108 is 30? Let me check: 277.78 * 0.1 is 27.778, *0.008 is 2.222. So 27.778 + 2.222=30. Yes, correct.

So x is 0.108 meters. Since the natural length is 30 cm, the extension is 10.8 cm. Wait, but wait, the options: looking back, the options are labeled A to J. Let me check the options:

A: 13.5 cm
B: 18.0 cm
C: 8.4 cm
D: 12.0 cm
E: 14.4 cm
F: 10.8 cm
G: 20.4 cm
H: 9.6 cm
I:21.6 cm
J:16.2 cm

So option F is 10.8 cm. That's one of the choices.

Wait, but wait, the question says "how far beyond its natural length will a force of 30 N...". So the extension is x=0.108 m =10.8 cm.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another approach: The work done is 2 J, which is equal to the potential energy. The PE is (1/2) k x². So x is 0.12 m as before.

Another way to calculate k is using W = ½ k x² → k = 2W / x² → 2*2 J / (0.12)^2 → 4 / 0.0144 → 277.78 N/m. Correct.

So F = k x → x = F/k =30 / 277.78 = approximately 0.108 m. So 10.8 cm. So option F.

To solve the problem, we use the relationship between work done, potential energy, and Hooke's Law. The work done (2 J) is the elastic potential energy stored in the spring, given by:

\[
W = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
\]

where \(W\) is the work done, \(k\) is the spring constant, and \(x\) is the displacement from the natural length. The spring is stretched from 30 cm to 42 cm, so the displacement is:

\[
x = 42 \, \text{cm} - 30 \, \text{cm} = 12 \, \text{cm} = 0.12 \, \text{m}.
\]

Substituting \(W = 2 \, \text{J}\) and \(x = 0.12 \, \text{m}\) into the equation:

\[
2 = \frac{1}{2} k (0.12)^2.
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
2 = 0.5 \cdot k \cdot 0.0144 \implies k = \frac{2}{0.0072} \approx 277.78 \, \text{N/m}.
\]

Next, we use Hooke's Law to find the displacement corresponding to a force of \(F = 30 \, \text{N}\):

\[
F = k x \implies x = \frac{F}{k}.
\]

Substituting \(F = 30 \, \text{N}\) and \(k = 277.78 \, \text{N/m}\):

\[
x = \frac{30}{277.78} \approx 0.108 \, \text{m} = 10.8 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Thus, the distance beyond the natural length where a force of 30 N will keep the spring stretched is 10.8 cm. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**F: 10.8 cm**
