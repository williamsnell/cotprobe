Question:

One year ago, while driving through an intersection, the defendant's car collided with the plaintiff's car. The plaintiff sued, claiming that the defendant ran a red light. In her case-in-chief, the plaintiff testified that immediately after the accident, a bystander, who was a local resident, screamed at the defendant, "You jerk. . . you drove through the red light. " In his case-in-chief, the defendant now calls a police accident investigator to testify that the plaintiff told him that she "didn't see the color of the light when she entered the intersection because she was dialing a number on her cell phone. "The investigator's testimony should be

Options:

A: admitted, because the plaintiff's statement to the investigator is a prior inconsistent statement.
B: excluded, because the plaintiff's statement to the investigator is hearsay.
C: admitted, because the plaintiff's cell phone use is relevant to the issue of negligence.
D: excluded, because the investigator's testimony is second-hand information and therefore unreliable.
E: admitted, because the accident investigator gathered the information in the course of his official duties.
F: admitted, because the plaintiff's inconsistent statement has bearing on her credibility.
G: admitted, because it is a statement against interest and therefore an exception to the hearsay rule.
H: excluded, because the statement was not made under oath and therefore may not be truthful.
I: excluded, because the defendant did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the plaintiff at the time she made the statement.

Okay, so I've got this law question about hearsay and statement evidence. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario: A defendant's car collided with a plaintiff's car. The plaintiff sued, claiming the defendant ran a red light. Her case in chief was that a bystander screamed at the defendant, saying, "You jerk. You drove through the red light." Then, the defendant called a police accident investigator, who testified that the plaintiff said she didn't see the color of the light because she was dialing a number on her cell phone. Now, the question is about whether the investigator's testimony should be admitted or excluded based on the plaintiff's statement.

Hearsay is a statement that someone else makes that isn't directly part of the facts. So the key is whether the plaintiff's statement to the investigator is hearsay.

The plaintiff's statement to the investigator was that she didn't see the light because she was on a cell phone. But wait, the bystander's statement was an inconsistent one because they thought the light was red. Also, the defendant's cell phone might not be relevant unless the plaintiff's statement is hearsay.

Wait, but the defendant's cell phone testimony is about whether she saw the light. But the issue is whether the statement is hearsay. The hearsay rule says that statements made by someone in the course of their employment can't be used as evidence. Here, the defendant called an investigator who was part of his job—working to find out about the accident. So he had the opportunity to cross-examine the plaintiff.

So the statement the plaintiff made to the investigator is hearsay unless it's under oath. But the statement wasn't made under oath. The bystander's statement was inconsistent and the defendant's cell phone testimony is about her presence. But the main issue is the hearsay part.

Wait, but the statement to the investigator is hearsay unless it's made under oath. The statement wasn't under oath. So the statement by the bystander is not hearsay. The defendant's cell phone testimony is about whether she saw the light. But the issue is about the plaintiff's statement to the investigator.

Wait, the defendant's cell phone testimony is about the plaintiff's statement. So the defendant is using that information as part of his investigation. But the hearsay issue is whether the statement was made by someone other than the defendant, and whether it's hearsay.

The statement to the investigator is hearsay unless the statement was made under oath. Since it wasn't under oath, is it hearsay? Well, the hearsay rule applies when the statement is made by someone in the course of employment and is not under oath. But here, the statement is a personal statement by the bystander, not an employment-related statement. So the statement would be hearsay unless it's proven otherwise.

But the question is whether the statement is hearsay. If the statement is hearsay, then it's excluded unless it's admissible for another reason. The options are whether it's admitted or excluded.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the statement is excluded because it's hearsay. So, is the statement hearsay?

The statement is hearsay only if it's not made under oath. The statement was made by someone not in the defendant's employ—bystanders are not part of the defendant's duties. Wait, no, the defendant is the one who called the investigator. So the statement is made by the bystander, not the defendant. So it's hearsay unless it's admissible for another reason.

Another angle: the statement is a prior inconsistent statement. But prior inconsistent statements are admissible to prove liability if a party can show that the statement was made under oath or that the statement was made under the influence of some element of the truth. But the statement here was made not under oath. So the prior inconsistent statement rule doesn't apply because the statement wasn't made under oath.

So the statement is hearsay, so it's excluded unless another exception applies. The options: option B says it's excluded because it's hearsay. Option F says it's excluded because it's second-hand info. So, second-hand info is when the statement is made by someone else and is not directly part of the facts, but the same person. But here, the statement is made by a bystander, so it's not second-hand. So F is wrong.

Option G is about it being an exception to the hearsay rule. But I don't think that applies here. The exception is about statements against interest, which is about the statement not being made for another purpose. The statement here is about the color of the light, which is a personal statement, not against interest. So G is incorrect.

Option H is about the statement not being made under oath. Since it was made by the bystander, not the defendant, and the hearsay rule requires that if it's not made under oath, it's hearsay. So H is correct. So the statement is hearsay.

So the answer would be option B: excluded because it's hearsay.

Wait, but another point: the plaintiff's statement is about not seeing the light. The defendant's cell phone testimony is about her presence. But the witness in question is the defendant's statement to the investigator. The Investigator's testimony is about the statement made by the bystander. So the Investigator isn't hearsay because they're part of the defendant's duties.

Wait, but the Investigator's testimony is about the statement made by the bystander. So the statement is hearsay because the bystander made it, and that's not under oath. So the statement itself is hearsay, so excluded.

So the correct answer is option B.

The question revolves around determining whether the plaintiff's statement to the police accident investigator is hearsay and, if so, whether it should be admitted or excluded. 

Hearsay is defined as a statement made by someone else that is not directly part of the facts. The key issue is whether the plaintiff's statement is hearsay. 

The statement made by the bystander is hearsay unless it is admissible for another reason. The hearsay rule applies when the statement is made by someone in the course of employment and is not under oath. However, the bystander's statement is not made under oath, so the statement is hearsay. 

The Investigator's testimony is not hearsay because it is part of the defendant's official duties. The hearsay issue pertains solely to the plaintiff's statement to the Investigator. 

Additionally, the statement is not against interest, as it is a personal statement about the color of the light. Therefore, the statement is not an exception to the hearsay rule.
