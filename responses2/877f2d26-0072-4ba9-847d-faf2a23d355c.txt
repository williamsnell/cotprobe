Question:

Let $A$ and $B$ be independent events with $P(A)=$ $1 / 4$ and $P(B)=2 / 3$. Compute $P(A \cap B)$

Options:

A: $\frac{1}{4}$
B: $\frac{7}{12}$
C: $\frac{1}{8}$
D: $\frac{1}{12}$
E: $\frac{3}{4}$
F: $\frac{2}{3}$
G: $\frac{5}{12}$
H: $\frac{1}{2}$
I:  $\frac{1}{6}$
J: $\frac{1}{3}$

Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve. Let me read it again. The question is about independent events A and B. The probabilities are given: P(A) is 1/4 and P(B) is 2/3. I need to find P(A ∩ B). Hmm, wait, but since A and B are independent, I remember that the probability of their intersection is just the product of their individual probabilities. Right? Because for independent events, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B).

So substituting the values, that would be (1/4) multiplied by (2/3). Let me do that calculation. 1 times 2 is 2, and 4 times 3 is 12. So that's 2/12. But that can be simplified. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 2. Dividing 2 by 2 gives 1, and 12 by 2 gives 6. So 2/12 simplifies to 1/6.

Looking at the options, option I is 1/6. So the answer should be I.

Wait a minute, but the question says compute P(A ∩ B). Oh wait, but just to make sure, sometimes people confuse mutually exclusive events, but this is independent. So yeah, for independent events, the intersection is just the product. So the answer is indeed 1/6.

The correct answer is I: $\frac{1}{6}$.
