Okay, so I've got this problem here about arranging parentheses. The question is asking how many ways there are to arrange 6 pairs of parentheses so that they form a balanced sequence. Hmm, I remember this is a classic problem, but I need to think through it step by step.

Wait, what's a balanced arrangement? Oh right, each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, and at no point should the number of closing parentheses exceed the opening ones when you read from left to right. So, for example, "(()())" is balanced, but "())(()" isn't because at some point the closing is too late.

I think this is related to something called Catalan numbers. I remember that Catalan numbers count the number of Dyck paths, which are paths that don't cross a certain boundary. Oh yes, and Dyck paths are a way to model the problem of balanced parentheses. Each step in the path corresponds to an opening or closing parenthesis, and the path never dips below the starting level.

So for n pairs of parentheses, the nth Catalan number gives the number of ways. The formula for the nth Catalan number is (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n). Right? Let me plug in n=6 to find the answer.

First, calculate the binomial coefficient, which is (12 choose 6). Let me compute that. 12 choose 6 is 12!/(6! *6!). 12 factorial is 479001600, 6! is 720. So 479001600 / (720 *720) = 479001600 / 518400. Let me do that division.

518400 * 900 is 466560000, which is less than 479001600. Subtracting, 479001600 - 466560000 = 1,244,1600. Wait, that's 1,244,1600? Wait no, 518400 * 900 is 466,560,000. So 466,560,000 is less than 479,001,600. So 479,001,600 - 466,560,000 = 12,441,600.

Now, 12,441,600 divided by 518400. Let's see: 518400 * 240 = 124,416,000? Wait, wait, maybe another approach. 12,441,600 divided by 518400. Let me factor both:

518400 = 5184 * 100 = 72^2 * 100 = (8*9)^2 * 100 = 8^2 * 9^2 * 100. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute 518400 * 240 = 518400 * 200 + 518400 *40 = 103,680,000 + 20,736,000 = 124,416,000. So 12,441,600 is 124,416,000 / 10 = 12,441,600.

So 518400 * 24 = 12,441,600. So 12,441,600 / 518400 is 24.

So (2n choose n) is 12 choose 6 = 924. Then the Catalan number is (1/7) * 924. Let's compute 924 divided by 7. 7*130=910, so 924-910=14, which is 2*7. So 130 + 2=132. So the Catalan number for n=6 is 132.

Looking at the options, D is 132. So the answer is D.

The number of balanced arrangements of 6 pairs of parentheses corresponds to the 6th Catalan number. Using the formula for Catalan numbers:

Cₙ = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n)

For n = 6:
C₆ = (1/7) * (12 choose 6) = (1/7) * 924 = 132.

Answer: D) 132.
