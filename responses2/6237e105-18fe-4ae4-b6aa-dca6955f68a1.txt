Alright, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Okay, the textbook weighs 30 N at sea level. I need to find its weight on a mountain peak that's 6,000 meters higher. Hmm, I remember that weight depends on gravity, which varies with distance from the Earth's center. So, since the mountain is higher, gravity should be weaker, making the textbook lighter.

Wait, the formula for weight is weight = mass × gravity. Oh right, but since the mass of the textbook doesn't change, the weight depends on the gravitational acceleration at that point. So I can use the inverse square law for gravity, which says that the gravitational force is proportional to 1/r², where r is the distance from the center of the Earth.

So, the textbook's weight at sea level (r1) is 30 N. The mountain peak is at a distance r2 = R + h, where R is Earth's radius and h is the height. R is given as 6,400 km, and h is 6,000 meters. Wait, I should convert all to the same units. Let's convert R to meters. So 6,400 km is 6,400,000 meters. Adding 6,000 meters gives 6,406,000 meters.

So, the ratio of gravitational acceleration at the mountain peak to sea level is (R1 / R2)². Wait, no, wait. Because the gravitational acceleration is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. So, g2 = g1 * (R1 / R2)². Wait, no, wait again. Wait, the mass is the same, so weight is mass times g. So, W2 = W1 * (g2 / g1) = W1 * (R1 / R2)². Or wait, is it (R1 / R2) or (R2 / R1)? Hmm, let me think. Let's clarify:

At sea level, g1 = G*M / R². At higher altitude, g2 = G*M / (R + h)². So, the ratio g2/g1 is (R / (R + h))². So, the textbook's weight on the mountain is W2 = W1 * (R / (R + h))².

Wait, no, wait, because W = m g. So, if W1 = m g1 = 30 N, then m = 30 / g1. Then, W2 = m g2 = (30 / g1) * g2. And since g2 = g1 * (R1 / (R1 + h))², substituting that in: W2 = 30 * (R1 / (R1 + h))².

So, R1 is 6,400,000 meters, and h is 6,000 meters. So R2 = R1 + h = 6,406,000 meters.

So, R1 / R2 equals (6,400,000) / (6,406,000) ≈ (6400 / 6406) ≈ approximately 0.99921875. But let's compute it more accurately.

Compute R1 / R2 = 6,400,000 / 6,406,000. That's 6400 / 6406. Let's divide both by 2: 3200/3203. Hmm, maybe it's better to compute it as a decimal. 6400 / 6406 is 0.99921875 approximately.

But actually, let me compute this precisely. 6406 * 0.99921875 = approx 6406 * (1 - 0.00078125) = 6406 - (6406 * 0.00078125) ≈ 6406 - 5.0046875 ≈ 6400.9953125. Hmm, but that might not help. Alternatively, using calculator approach: 6406000 / 6400000.

Wait, perhaps 6400000 is 6,400,000, and 6,406,000 is 6,400,000 + 6,000.

So, R1 = 6,400,000, R2 = 6,406,000.

Compute R1/R2 = 6400 / 6406. Let me compute this as (6400 * 1000) / (6406 * 1000). So 6400 / 6406 = (6406 - 6) / 6406 = 1 - 6/6406 ≈ 1 - 0.000936.

So, R1/R2 ≈ 0.999064.

Wait, wait, 6/6406 is approximately 0.000936. So 1 - 0.000936 is about 0.999064.

So, the square of that is (0.999064)^2 ≈ 0.998128. Because (a - b)^2 ≈ a² - 2ab when a is close to 1.

Wait, perhaps exact calculation is better. Let me compute (6400/6406)^2.

(6400/6406) = (6400)/(6406) = let me compute 6400 * 6406 = ?

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 6400^2 = 40,960,000.

6406^2 = (6400 + 6)^2 = 6400^2 + 2*6400*6 + 6^2 = 40,960,000 + 76,800 + 36 = 41,036,836.

So, (6400/6406)^2 = (6400^2)/(6406^2) = 40,960,000 / 41,036,836 ≈ approximately 0.9981279.

So, the weight at the mountain is W2 = 30 N * 0.9981279 ≈ 29.944 N, which is roughly 30 N.

Wait, but wait a second. The options don't have 30 N as the best estimate? Looking back: options are from 10 to 70, in increments of 5. So 30 is an option, F: 20, G:30, H:7.5. So, the calculation suggests about 30 N, which is option F (20) or G (30). Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, if the mountain is 6000 meters above sea level, which is 6 km, which is much less than Earth's radius. So, the change in g is very small. But let's make sure.

Wait, actually, I think the confusion arises because I might have the ratio inverted. Because if I'm higher, g is lower, so the weight should be less. So, the mountain's weight should be less than 30 N. The options for the weight are 15,60,45,10,90,20,30,7.5,35,25.

Wait, so if I compute 30 * (R1/(R2))^2, which is 30 * (6400/6406)^2 ≈ 30*(0.999064)^2 ≈ 30*(0.9981279) ≈ 29.944 N, which is about 30 N. So option G is 30 N, but option F is 20. So why is the weight less than 30? Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe I should have used the inverse square law: (R1 / R2)^2.

Wait, no, I think I did the right thing. Let me think again. The textbook's weight is 30 N at sea level. At higher altitude, since g decreases, weight decreases. So, W = W0 * (R0 / R)^2, where R is the new radius. But wait, the formula is W = W0 * (R0/R)^2, because g scales as 1/R². So, if R increases, g decreases, so weight decreases.

Wait, let me rederive it. So, W = m g. At sea level, g = G M / R0². At altitude h, g = G M / (R0 + h)^2. So, the ratio of g at mountain peak to sea level is (R0/(R0 + h))^2. So, W = m g = (m g0) * (R0/(R0 + h))². So, W = 30 * (6400000/(6406000))² ≈ 30 * (0.999064)^2 ≈ 29.94 N, which is about 30 N.

So, the weight of the textbook on the mountain is approximately 30 N. So, the best estimate is 30 N, which is option F. Wait, but wait, I thought the weight would be less than 30 N. Hmm, but maybe I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps the mountain is 6 km, which is about 1/10th of the radius of the Earth. So, 1/10th is 0.1, so (0.1)^2 is 0.01. So, the weight would be 30 * 0.01 = 0.3 N, which is way less than 30 N. Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, wait, no, because 6,000 m is about 1/10th of 64,000 m (the Earth's radius is 6,400 km). So, 6,000 m is 6,000 /6,400,000 = 0.0009375 of R. So, 0.0009375 is 1/1066.666... So, R/(R + h) is 1 / (1 + h/R) ≈ 1 - h/R, using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.

So, h/R is 6000 /6,400,000 = 0.0009375. So, R/(R+h) ≈ 1 - 0.0009375 = 0.9990625. Squaring that gives (0.9990625)^2 ≈ 0.998125.

So, 30 * 0.998125 ≈ 29.944 N, which is approximately 30 N. So, the textbook's weight on the mountain is about 30 N, which is option F. But wait, looking back, the options are:

A:15 B:60 C:45 D:10 E:90 F:20 G:30 H:7.5 I:35 J:25

So, the correct answer would be F, 20, or G, 30? Oh wait, I think my mistake is that I'm considering that the change in g is approximately (h/R)^2. But perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for weight change: W2 = W1 * (R1/(R1 + h))^2.

So, R1 = 6,400,000 m, h=6,000 m.

So, R1 + h = 6,406,000 m.

Compute R1/(R1 + h) = 6,400,000 / 6,406,000.

Let me compute 6400000 /6406000. Let's write this as 6400000 /6406000 = (6400000 ÷ 1000) / (6406000 ÷ 1000) = 6400 /6406.

Compute 6400 ÷ 6406.

6406 = 6400 +6.

6400 = 100 * 64.

Wait, 6406 = 64 * 100 + 6. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute the division:

6400 ÷ 6406 = 0.9990625 approximately.

So, the square is 0.9990625² = 0.998125.

So, 30 * 0.998125 = 29.944 N ≈ 30 N.

Wait, so the textbook's weight is approximately 30 N, which is option G. But wait, looking back, the options are:

A:15, B:60, C:45, D:10, E:90, F:20, G:30, H:7.5, I:35, J:25.

So, the calculation suggests 30 N, which is option G. But wait, the options are presented, so the correct answer would be option F or G.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the problem is in the same units.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait, wait, no, the formula is correct. So, the textbook's weight would be about 30 N, which is option G.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about it in terms of the gravitational field being approximately the same at sea level, but maybe the question expects a rough estimate.

Wait, another thought: the Earth's radius is about 6400 km, so R is 6400000 m. h is 6000 m, which is much less than R. So, the change in g is small. The approximation is (R/(R+h))² ≈ 1 - 2h/R.

So, 2h/R = 12,000 m / 6,400,000 m = 0.001875. So, (R/(R+h))² ≈ 1 - 2h/R = 1 - 0.001875 = 0.998125.

So, the weight is 30 * 0.998125 = 29.94375 N, which is approximately 30 N, option G.

But wait, perhaps I should think about whether the textbook's weight decreases because the g at the mountain is lower. So, the textbook is lighter, so about 30 N is correct.

Wait, the options have 30 as option G. So the correct answer is G:30 N.

To determine the textbook's weight on a mountain peak 6,000 m above sea level, we use the inverse square law for gravity, where weight is proportional to \( \frac{1}{r^2} \), with \( r \) being the distance from the Earth's center. At sea level, the textbook weighs 30 N, and the Earth's radius is approximately 6,400 km (6,400,000 m). The mountain peak is 6,000 m above sea level, so the new distance is \( R + h = 6,400,000 + 6,000 = 6,406,000 \, \text{m} \).

The weight at sea level is \( W_1 = 30 \, \text{N} \), and the weight at the mountain peak is \( W_2 \). Using the formula:

\[
W_2 = W_1 \cdot \left( \frac{R}{R + h} \right)^2
\]

where \( R = 6,400,000 \, \text{m} \) and \( h = 6,000 \, \text{m} \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{R}{R + h} = \frac{6,400,000}{6,406,000} \approx 0.9990625
\]

\[
\left( \frac{R}{R + h} \right)^2 \approx (0.9990625)^2 \approx 0.998125
\]

Thus, the weight at the mountain peak is:

\[
W_2 = 30 \cdot 0.998125 \approx 29.944 \, \text{N}
\]

This value is approximately 30 N. Among the provided options, the best estimate for the textbook's weight on the mountain is **30 N**.
