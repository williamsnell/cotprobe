Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about images formed by a plane mirror. Hmm, let me think. The question says that an object is placed 100 cm from a plane mirror, and I need to find out how far the image is from the object. The options are A to J, with various centimeter measurements. 

Wait, I remember that with plane mirrors, the image is always the same size as the object and it's located as far behind the mirror as the object is in front. So if the object is 100 cm from the mirror, the image must be 100 cm as well, but on the other side of the mirror. 

Oh right! The distance between the object and its image is twice the distance from the object to the mirror. So 100 cm to the mirror, so 200 cm between the object and image. That makes the total distance from the object to the image 200 cm. 

Looking at the options, option E is 150 cm, but that doesn't fit. Wait, no. Let me check the options again. Oh, wait, option E is 150 cm. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Or perhaps I'm confusing the question. Let me double-check the problem statement.

The problem says, "How far is the image from the object?" So the distance between the object and image is indeed twice the distance from the object to the mirror. Since the object is 100 cm away, the image is 100 cm behind the mirror, so the total distance is 200 cm. 

Wait, but the options don't have 200. Let me see the options again. Oh, wait, option E is 150 cm. Did I read the question correctly? Or perhaps the question is about the distance between the object and its image. Oh wait, the options given are A to J, and the correct answer would be 200 cm. But none of the options have 200. Let me look again. 

Options are A:350, B:300, C:100, D:600, E:150, F:250, G:50, H:400, I:500, J:200. Oh, J is 200. So the answer must be J. 

Wait, but wait. Did I interpret the question right? I thought the image is at 100 cm behind the mirror, so the total distance is 200 cm. So the image is 200 cm away from the object. Looking at the options, J is 200. So the correct answer should be J.

The image formed by a plane mirror is located as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of it. Since the object is 100 cm from the mirror, the image is also 100 cm behind the mirror. Therefore, the total distance between the object and the image is 200 cm. Among the given options, the correct answer is 200 cm, which corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
