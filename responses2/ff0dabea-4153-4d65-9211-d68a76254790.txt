Question:

Frank Burger owns a paint and wallpaper store. A customer wishes to paper a room that is 24 feet long, 18 feet wide, and 9 feet high. There is a window 3 feet by 8 feet and a door 4 feet by 9 feet. Allowing for a 10% waste of paper, how many single rolls of paper (36 square feet of paper in a single roll) will be required?

Options:

A: 16 rolls
B: 20 rolls
C: 22 rolls
D: 25 rolls
E: 28 rolls
F: 24 rolls
G: 30 rolls
H: 26 rolls
I: 14 rolls
J: 18 rolls

Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating how many paint and wallpaper rolls Frank needs to buy. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the room's dimensions: 24 feet long, 18 feet wide, and 9 feet high. The customer has a window and a door that the wallpaper needs to cover. Also, there's a 10% waste factor which means we'll probably end up needing a bit more paper than the actual area.

So, the first thing I think is to calculate the total area of the walls. But wait, I should remember to subtract the areas of the window and door because those won't be covered with paper.

Let me break it down. The room has four walls. Two walls are length by height, and the other two are width by height. 

So the area of each pair of walls would be:
- Two walls of 24ft by 9ft: 2*(24*9)
- Two walls of 18ft by 9ft: 2*(18*9)

Let me calculate each part:
24ft * 9ft = 216 square feet. So two of those are 2*216 = 432.
18ft *9ft = 162. Two of those are 2*162 = 324.

Adding those together: 432 + 324 = 756 square feet for the walls.

Now, the window is 3ft by 8ft. Area is 24 square feet. The door is 4ft by 9ft, which is 36 square feet.

So total area not to be wallpaper'd is 24 + 36 = 60 square feet.

Subtract that from the total wall area: 756 - 60 = 696 square feet. That's the area that needs to be covered.

But wait, we have to account for 10% extra waste. So we need to add 10% of 696 to get the total area to cover. 10% of 696 is 69.6, so adding that gives 696 + 69.6 = 765.6 square feet.

Now, each roll is 36 square feet. So how many rolls do we need? We can divide 765.6 by 36.

765.6 รท 36. Let me compute that. 36 * 21 is 756, which is less than 765.6. 36*21.8 would be 765.6? Let me check: 21*36=756, 0.8*36=28.8. 756 +28.8=784.8, which is more than 765.6. Hmm, maybe I should do 765.6 /36.

Alternatively, 36 * 21 =756. Subtract that from 765.6: 765.6-756=9.6. So 21 rolls cover 756, and we need 9.6 more. Since each roll is 36, 9.6/36 is 0.266... So we need 21.266 rolls. But you can't buy a fraction of a roll, so we need to round up to 22 rolls. But wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations because 22 rolls would actually give 22*36=792. So 765.6 is less than 792, so it's sufficient. But let me make sure I didn't miscalculate the area.

Wait, let me go through again.

Total wall area: 2*(24*9) + 2*(18*9) = 2*(216) + 2*(162) = 432 + 324 = 756. Correct.

Window and door area: 3*8=24, 4*9=36. Total 60. Correct.

Subtract: 756 -60 = 696. Correct.

Add 10% waste: 696 *1.1= 765.6. Correct.

Now, roll area is 36. 765.6 /36 = 21.266... So 22 rolls. So answer would be 22 rolls, which is option C. But wait, the options are:

A:16

B:20

C:22

D:25

E:28

F:24

G:30

H:26

I:14

J:18

Wait, but the option is C:22. So the answer is C. But wait, let me check if I made an error in calculations. Because 22 rolls at 36 each is 792, which is more than 765.6, so it's sufficient.

Wait a minute, the options given include 22 as option C. So the correct answer should be C:22 rolls.

The problem requires calculating the number of paint rolls needed for a room with specific dimensions, subtracting window and door areas, and accounting for 10% waste. 

1. **Calculate total wall area:**
   - Two walls: 24ft * 9ft = 216 sq ft each, total 432.
   - Two walls: 18ft * 9ft = 162 sq ft each, total 324.
   - Total walls: 432 + 324 = 756 sq ft.

2. **Subtract window and door areas:**
   - Window: 3ft * 8ft = 24 sq ft.
   - Door: 4ft * 9ft = 36 sq ft.
   - Total non-paperable area: 24 + 36 = 60 sq ft.
   - Paperable area: 756 - 60 = 696 sq ft.

3. **Add 10% waste:**
   - 10% of 696 = 69.6.
   - Total area needed: 696 + 69.6 = 765.6 sq ft.

4. **Determine rolls needed:**
   - Each roll is 36 sq ft.
   - 765.6 / 36 = 21.266, so 22 rolls are needed.

**Answer: C: 22 rolls.**

C
