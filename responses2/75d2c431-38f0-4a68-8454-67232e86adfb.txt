Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure out whether each of the three events represents a change in supply or a change in quantity supplied. Let me take it step by step.

Starting with part a: Cold weather in Florida destroys a great deal of the orange crop. So, fewer oranges are produced. The question is, does this affect supply or quantity supplied? Well, supply refers to the total amount of a good available for sale at a given price. If the orange crop is destroyed, the total supply decreases. So, that's a change in supply because the available quantity is changing. For example, if farmers produce less, the total oranges available go down, which reduces the quantity supplied at the current price.

Moving on to part b: The cost of limes increases, and bar owners raise the price of gin and tonics. Wait, wait. That seems a bit off. Limes are a fruit, but gin and tonics are chemicals, right? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think. Wait, the question says "bar owners raise the price of gin and tonics." Oh, wait, maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding. Let's clarify. If the cost of limes increases, the price of something else increases. But does that relate to supply or quantity supplied? I don't think so. The cost of limes might affect the supply of limes, but the bar owners' actions seem unrelated. Alternatively, maybe it's about the supply of something else. Wait, perhaps it's a separate event. Let me consider each part individually.

Wait, the question is about each of the three parts (a, b, c). So part b says the cost of limes increases. That's a change in the cost of production. Let me think about that. If the cost of limes (an input) increases, how does that affect supply or quantity supplied? The cost of production affects the cost of producing the good. But in this case, bar owners are raising the price of something else, not of limes. So the cost of limes increases, but that's not directly affecting the supply or quantity of limes. So perhaps the bar owners' action isn't connected to the supply or quantity of limes. Or maybe the question is mixing up the goods. Wait, maybe it's about other goods. For example, perhaps they're talking about the supply of gin and tonics, but that doesn't make sense because limes are a fruit, and gin and tonics are different products. Wait, maybe the question is about the supply of something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and should be the cost of limes affecting the supply of limes, but the bar owners are the ones probably raising prices, not the cost. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe part b is about the supply of something else. Let's say that the cost of limes increases, which might allow bar owners to raise the price of other goods, but that's not directly a change in the supply of limes. Alternatively, perhaps the bar owners are buying limes at a higher cost, but that's not about the supply of limes. Maybe the question is mixing up the goods. Let me try to rephrase: If the cost of limes increases, and bar owners raise the price of something else, like maybe a drink or a service, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the supply of limes, but the bar owners are not the ones affecting the supply of limes. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed to the next part and come back.

Part c: The price of leather shoes goes up. This induces manufacturers of leather shoes to increase production. So, when the price goes up, manufacturers produce more—more quantity supplied. Therefore, this is a change in quantity supplied because the quantity of shoes produced increases.

So summarizing:

a) Cold weather destroys oranges, reducing total supply. So change in supply.

b) Cost of limes increases, affecting supply of limes, but the bar owners' actions might not be directly related. Alternatively, perhaps the bar owners are buying something else, but the question is about limes. Alternatively, maybe part b is about the supply of another good, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the bar owners are not directly affecting the supply of limes, so maybe part b isn't about supply or quantity. Wait, but the question is whether each part is a change in supply or quantity. So I might have to think about each part individually.

Wait, part b says: The cost of limes increase, bar owners raise the price of gin and tonics. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps bar owners are buying the limes, but that's not the point here. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me consider that the bar owners are buying something else, but the question is about the supply/demand of limes. Maybe the question is a typo, but I'll proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the bar owners are buying limes, which would change the supply of limes, but that's not stated. The question doesn't say that. So the bar owners raising the price of something else might not be directly affecting the supply of limes. So perhaps part b is not a change in supply or quantity. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the question is making an error in part b. Let me think again. The question is, does each of these represent a change in supply or quantity. So part b is about the cost of limes increasing, which would affect the supply of limes if the price of limes increases, but the bar owners are raising the price of something else. So maybe that's a change in price, not quantity or supply. Or perhaps the bar owners are now buying more limes, which would increase supply. But the question doesn't state that. So perhaps part b is not about supply or quantity.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the supply of limes. Let me think: If the cost of limes increases, that would increase the cost of producing limes, so the supply of limes would decrease (because farmers can't make as much). But that's a change in supply. However, the bar owners are raising the price of gin and tonics, but that doesn't affect the supply of limes. So part b is about the supply of limes (a change), but the bar owners' actions are unrelated. So perhaps part b is a change in supply, but the cause is a separate factor.

Wait, but the question is about whether each part is a change in supply or quantity. So for part b, the change is in the supply because limes are being produced less. But the bar owners are raising prices of something else, which may not be directly affecting the supply of limes. So perhaps part b is a change in quantity? Because the price of another product (gin and tonics) is increasing. Or perhaps bar owners are buying more limes, but that's not part of the question. I think I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the cost of limes increases, which affects the supply of limes. But the bar owners are buying more limes because the price of limes is now higher, so that's a change in quantity (more limes bought), but that's not directly about the supply of limes. Alternatively, the supply of limes is changing because the cost increases, but the bar owners are not directly buying limes but affecting the demand for something else. Hmm, it's a bit confusing.

Wait, let's approach each part again.

a) Cold weather destroys a lot of the orange crop. So total oranges available go down. So change in supply.

b) Cost of limes increases. This affects the supply of limes because the cost of production is rising. But the bar owners are raising the price of gin and tonics, but not limes. So this might be a change in price, but whether it's supply or quantity: I think the bar owners are not directly affecting the supply of limes. So perhaps part b is about the cost affecting the supply of limes, but the bar owners' actions aren't part of that. So part b isn't a change in supply or quantity? Or perhaps it's a change in quantity because bar owners are buying more limes. But the question is about the cost of limes affecting the supply—so the quantity would be affected. Wait, but the question is whether each part is a change in supply or quantity. So part b is about the cost of limes increasing, which affects the supply of limes. So that's a change in supply. The bar owners' actions are about another product, but that's not directly affecting the supply of limes. So perhaps part b is a change in supply.

Alternatively, perhaps the bar owners are buying more limes because the price of limes has gone up, which would change the quantity supplied. But that's a change in quantity, not supply. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps bar owners are buying the limes because they're a good; maybe the price went up, so more people buy it. That's a change in quantity supplied because more limes are available. But the cause is an increase in the price of limes. So the change is in quantity, not supply.

Wait, but the question is about the cost of limes increasing. The cost of limes affects the supply of limes. If the cost increases, the supply curve shifts left, leading to lower quantity supplied at the current price. So that's a change in supply.

So, for part b: the cost of limes increases, which affects the supply of limes. But the bar owners are raising the price of gin and tonics. So perhaps this is a change in the demand for limes (because the price went up). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the bar owners are buying more limes because the price went up, which is a change in quantity supplied. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is: 

- The question is about the change in supply or quantity in each event.

a) Cold weather destroys oranges, reducing the total available. So that's a change in supply.

b) Cost of limes increases. This affects the supply of limes because higher costs mean less is produced. However, the bar owners are raising the price of gin and tonics, but that's a separate event. So part b is about a change in supply of limes (because of higher costs), but the bar owners' actions are unrelated. Alternatively, perhaps the bar owners buying more limes due to price up is a change in quantity, but in this case, it's a change in price. Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think of the supply curve.

If the cost of limes increases, the supply curve shifts left. So, at the original price, less is supplied. If the price goes up, the quantity supplied decreases, but that's a change in quantity. Alternatively, if the price increases, more is bought, which is a change in quantity. But the main issue is whether the event itself is a change in supply or quantity. 

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to think about each event as a change in either supply or quantity. 

For part b, the question is about the cost of limes increasing, which changes the supply of limes. So that's a change in supply.

The bar owners' actions are about another product, so they're not directly related to part b. So part b is a change in supply.

c) The price of leather shoes increases, causing manufacturers to produce more. That's a change in quantity supplied, because more is produced.

So, putting it all together:

a) Change in supply.

b) Change in supply.

c) Change in quantity.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D says a) Change in supply, b) Change in quantity, c) Change in supply. But according to my analysis, part b is a change in supply, and part c is a change in quantity.

Wait, but earlier I thought part c is a change in quantity. Let me check.

Wait, part c: price of shoes increases, manufacturers produce more—so yes, change in quantity supplied.

So D says a) supply, b) quantity, c) supply.

Wait, but according to my analysis, part b is a change in supply.

So looking at the options:

Option D: a) supply, b) quantity, c) supply. So that would have a) and c) correct, but part b as quantity. But according to the analysis, part b is supply.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because in part b, the question is about the cost of limes increasing. So that should affect supply of limes. So for part b, it's a change in supply.

So the options are:

Option D: a) supply, b) quantity, c) supply.

Wait, that would be incorrect because part b is a change in supply.

Looking at the options:

Option D: a) supply, b) quantity, c) supply.

Wait, no, that's incorrect because part b is a change in supply.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine each part.

Part a: Cold weather destroys a lot of the orange crop. So, total oranges available go down. So that's a change in supply.

Part b: The cost of limes increases. This leads to a decrease in the supply of limes (as higher costs reduce production). So that's a change in supply.

Part c: Price of shoes goes up, manufacturers increase production. So that's a change in quantity supplied.

So the correct sequence is:

a) supply

b) supply

c) quantity

Looking at the options:

Looking for an option where a is supply, b is supply, c is quantity. Let's check the options.

Option D is a) supply, b) quantity, c) supply. No, that's not correct.

Option G: a) supply, b) supply, c) quantity.

Wait, that's a) supply, b) supply, c) quantity. That would fit. So the correct option is G.

Wait, but earlier I thought that part b is a change in supply, and part c is a change in quantity.

But according to the correct analysis, part b is a change in supply, part c is a change in quantity.

So the correct option is G: a) supply, b) supply, c) quantity.

Looking at the provided options:

Option G: a) supply, b) supply, c) quantity.

Yes, that matches.

The question asks whether each of the three economic events represents a change in supply or a change in quantity supplied. Here's the analysis:

### Part a:
Cold weather destroys a great deal of the orange crop. This reduces the total supply of oranges available for sale. Therefore, this is a **change in supply**.

### Part b:
The cost of limes increases, and bar owners raise the price of gin and tonics. The cost of limes affects the supply of limes (a change in supply), but the bar owners' actions are unrelated to this event. Thus, this is a **change in supply**.

### Part c:
The price of leather shoes goes up, and manufacturers increase production. This leads to an increase in the quantity of shoes produced at the current price, which is a **change in quantity supplied**.

### Correct Option:
The correct sequence is:
- a) Change in supply
- b) Change in supply
- c) Change in quantity supplied

Looking at the options, **Option G** matches this sequence.
