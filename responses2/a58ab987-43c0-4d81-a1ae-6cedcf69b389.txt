Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Kohlberg's conventional level of morality. I remember that Kohlberg's theory has three main levels: Infant, Young, and Conventional. The conventional level is the third one, which I think is where people act based on their psychological development and social norms.

The question is asking which explanation best illustrates this level. The options are from A to J, each with a different reason why someone drives at or below the speed limit.

First, I need to recall what Kohlberg's conventional morality is about. He argued that people's actions are shaped by their stage of psychological development and the societal norms they encounter. At the conventional stage, people are influenced by societal expectations and laws, not their own feelings or values.

Looking at the options, let's see:

A: "I don't want to waste gas." That's about saving money, not about speed.

B: "I'm not in a rush." Again, about time rather than speed.

C: "I want to impress my friends." This seems more about social approval and personal feelings, which might relate to the Young stage, not Conventional.

D: "I find it relaxing to drive slowly." Relaxation and personal enjoyment. This makes me think about the Young stage because it's about being comfortable and enjoying the process.

E: "It's the law." Well, that's a big one. Oh wait, Kohlberg says the conventional level is when people follow societal rules without necessarily thinking deeply about their reasons.

F: "I want my parents to approve of my driving." This is about social approval and trust, which again is more about the Young stage.

G: "I don't want to get any tickets." Getting tickets is a formal law. That's probably the law stage, not conventional.

H: "I don't want to crash my car." Crashing is even more about following the law, which would be the law stage.

I: "I'm afraid of going fast." Fear is a psychological aspect tied to the Young stage when they're trying to maintain status or avoid punishment.

J: "I want to be a good example for my younger siblings." This is about moral modeling, which is part of the Young stage. They're learning by observing others.

So, the conventional level is when people follow societal rules and laws, not necessarily thinking about the reasons or their own feelings. Looking at the options, E says "It's the law." That's definitely about the conventional level because it's a societal rule, not an individual choice about speed. Although, wait, E is a direct response to the law, which is a law stage, not conventional.

Wait, but the question's about which option best illustrates conventional. So, conventional is when people comply with societal expectations. So, the correct answer would be E, because following the law is a societal norm, not necessarily a reason to drive at a certain speed.

Alternatively, option I is about fear of going fast, which is part of the Young stage. So, E is the best fit.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The conventional level is when people act based on societal norms, not their own values. So, for example, someone who follows the law because it's a rule, not because they feel it's right, would be at the conventional level.

So in the options, E is about it being the law. That's a societal rule applied without considering personal reasons. So that would fit the conventional level.

Alternatively, option I is about fear of going fast, which is more about social pressure or avoiding punishment, which is part of the Young stage.

So the correct answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: "It's the law." This explanation best illustrates Kohlberg's conventional level of morality, as it refers to a societal rule applied without considering personal reasons, aligning with the conventional stage where individuals follow norms rather than their own values.

Answer: E
