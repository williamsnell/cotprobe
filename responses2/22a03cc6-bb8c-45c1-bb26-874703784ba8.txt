Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the horsepower of a hoist. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that a hoist is raising a 330-pound load over a distance of 15 feet in 5 seconds. And I need to find out the rate in horsepower. The options are A through J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Wait, I remember that horsepower is a unit of power. Power is calculated as work done divided by time. Right, power P = work done / time. And work done is force multiplied by distance, so P = F * d / t. But wait, the force here is probably the weight of the load, right? Because the hoist is lifting the load against gravity.

But wait, I think horse power is a specific unit. Oh right, 1 horsepower (hp) is equal to 550 foot-pounds per second. So I'll need to convert the power I calculate into horsepower.

Let me jot down the formula:

P (in power) = (Force * Distance) / Time

But wait, the units here are in pounds for force, feet for distance, and seconds for time. Wait, so the units will be (pound-force * foot) / second. But we need to convert that into horsepower, which uses foot-pounds per second.

So first, calculate the power in foot-pounds per second.

Force is 330 pounds, distance is 15 feet, time is 5 seconds.

So Power = (330 lb * 15 ft) / 5 s.

Let me compute that. 330 * 15 is 4950. Divided by 5 is 990. So 990 foot-pounds per second.

Now, to convert that to horsepower. Since 1 hp is 550 foot-pounds per second, I divide 990 by 550.

990 / 550 = 1.8.

Wait, so 1.8 horsepower. Let me see the options. Option C is 1.8 hp. So the answer must be C.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh, wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, sometimes when I'm dealing with units, I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again.

Power is work done over time. Work is force times distance. 330 pounds times 15 feet. 330 *15 is 4950. Divide by 5 seconds: 4950/5 = 990 ft-lb/s. Then 990 /550 = 1.8 hp. Oh, yeah, that's correct.

So the correct answer is option C: 1.8 hp.
</think>

To determine the power in horsepower, we start by calculating the work done and then convert it to horsepower. The power formula is:

\[ P = \frac{F \cdot d}{t} \]

Where:
- \( F = 330 \) pounds (force),
- \( d = 15 \) feet (distance),
- \( t = 5 \) seconds (time).

First, calculate the power in foot-pounds per second (ft-lb/s):

\[ P = \frac{330 \cdot 15}{5} = \frac{4950}{5} = 990 \, \text{ft-lb/s} \]

Next, convert this to horsepower (hp), knowing that 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/s:

\[ \text{Horsepower} = \frac{990}{550} = 1.8 \, \text{hp} \]

Thus, the hoist is working at 1.8 horsepower. The correct answer is:
