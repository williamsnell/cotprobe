Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. It involves two inertial frames, S and S', and some rocket speeds. Hmm. So, the question is about transforming velocities from one frame to another. I remember that in relativity, when you switch between different inertial frames, the velocity of an object isn't just a simple addition or subtraction; you have to use the velocity addition formulas, which are different from the Galilean ones. Oh wait, because these speeds are close to the speed of light, I think relativistic effects are significant.

So the setup is that in frame S, the rocket is moving at 0.1c in the positive y-direction. Frame S' is moving at 0.6c relative to S along the x-axis. I need to find the velocity of the rocket in S'. I remember that in special relativity, the velocity transformations are different. I think it's the Lorentz velocity transformation equations. The formulas are:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²))
v = (u' + v') / (1 + (u' v')/c²)

Wait, but wait. In this case, I think the S' frame is moving at velocity v relative to S along the x-axis. So v is 0.6c in the x-direction. But the rocket is moving in the y-direction in S. So the problem is about transforming a velocity that's in the y-direction from S to S'.

Wait, in relativity, velocity vectors aren't just added or subtracted. The velocity transformation is a bit more involved because it involves vectors. Since the velocity in S is along the y-axis, and S' is moving along the x-axis, I think the velocity in S' will have components in both x and y directions. Because in S, the rocket's velocity has zero x-component and 0.1c y-component. So in S', the x-component of the rocket's velocity will be different, and the y-component will transform as well.

Alternatively, maybe I should model it using the velocity addition formulas. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form. Let me think. The velocity transformation for each component (x and y) would involve the relative velocity between the frames.

Wait, I think the velocity transformation equations for each component are:

u'_x = [u_x - v] / [1 - (u_x v)/(c²)] / [sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)))]? No, wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the Lorentz transformation for velocity is:

u'_x = [u_x - v] / [1 - (u_x v) / c²]
u'_y = [u_y * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)] / [1 - (u_x v)/c²]

Wait, that makes more sense. Because the denominators are the same. Let me clarify.

The general Lorentz transformation for velocity components is:

u'_x = (u_x - v) / (1 - (u_x v)/(c²))
u'_y = [ (u_y * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) ] / (1 - (u_x v)/(c²) )

Wait, but wait, isn't that when the velocity in S is u = (u_x, u_y, u_z) and we're transforming to S' which is moving at speed v along the x-axis.

So in this case, u_x = 0 (since the rocket is not moving in S's x-direction), u_y = 0.1c. The velocity v that S' has relative to S is 0.6c in the positive x-direction. So v = 0.6c, and it's positive.

So substituting into the equations.

First, compute the denominator for both u'_x and u'_y.

Denominator: 1 - (u_x v)/(c²) = 1 - (0 * 0.6c)/(c²) = 1 - 0 = 1.

So, denominator is 1. That simplifies things.

Then, compute u'_x:

u'_x = (0 - 0.6c) / 1 = -0.6c.

Wait, but that's the x-component. The y-component calculation: u'_y = [ (0.1c) * sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) ] / 1.

Wait, because v is 0.6c, so v²/c² is (0.6c)^2/c^2 = 0.36.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(1 - 0.36) = sqrt(0.64) = 0.8.

So u'_y = (0.1c * 0.8 ) / 1 = 0.08c.

Wait, but that's just the y-component. So the velocity in S' is (u'_x, u'_y) = (-0.6c, 0.08c). So the velocity vector is at an angle θ where tanθ = u'_y / u'_x.

Wait, but u'_x is negative (-0.6), u'_y is positive (0.08). So the velocity vector is in the second quadrant with respect to the x-axis.

So the angle θ can be found by tanθ = (0.08c)/(0.6c) = 0.08/0.6 = 0.133333..., which is 8.13 degrees approximately. But since the x-component is negative and y positive, the angle is 180 - 8.13 degrees, so 171.87 degrees from the x-axis. Or, another way, the direction is 8.13 degrees above the negative x-direction.

Wait, another way to find the angle. Since tanθ = (0.08)/(0.6) = 0.1333. So θ = arctan(0.1333) ≈ 7.63 degrees. But since the x-component is negative, the direction is 180 - 7.63 = 172.37 degrees from positive x. So, 172.37 degrees from x-axis, which is 172.37 - 180 = -7.63 degrees relative to x-axis. Wait, no, perhaps I'm complicating it. Alternatively, since the x-component is negative and the y-component is positive, the direction is in the second quadrant. So the angle from the positive x-axis would be 180 - 7.63 = 172.37 degrees. But the options probably refer to the angle relative to the negative x-axis. So the direction is 7.63 degrees above the negative x-axis.

Wait, the options are given as angle from the negative x-axis, so 7 degrees or 8 degrees. Let me look at the options.

Options B, C, etc.

Option B: 0.605c in a direction making angle of 7°36’ with the negative x-axis.

Hmm, 7 degrees is about 0.1225 radians, or tan(7.36) is about 0.1305. Wait, but our calculation gave tanθ ≈ 0.1333. So maybe 7 degrees is 7.63 degrees, which would make the answer B.

But wait, let me double-check. Let me compute it precisely.

Compute u'_y / u'_x: 0.08 / 0.6 = 0.133333. So the angle θ where tanθ = 0.133333.

What's the arctangent of 0.133333?

Hmm, 1/7 is about 0.142857. So 0.1333 is a bit less than 1/7. So the angle is just a bit less than 7.63 degrees. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity transformation. Because I remember that when the velocity is perpendicular, the transformation is different. Wait, in this case, the rocket's velocity is purely in the y-direction (u_x = 0), so the velocity transformation for u'_y should be different from u'_x.

Wait, perhaps I should re-derive the transformation.

The general formula for velocity transformation from S to S' is:

u'_x = (u_x - v) / (1 - (u_x v)/c² )

u'_y = (u_y * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) / (1 - (u_x v)/c² )

Wait, but in our case, u_x is zero, so u'_x = (-v) / (1 - 0) = -v. So u'_x = -v. Since v is 0.6c, so u'_x = -0.6c.

And u'_y = (u_y * sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ) / (1 - 0) ) → (u_y * sqrt( (1 - (0.6)^2) )) → u_y * sqrt(0.64) * (since 0.6^2=0.36, 1-0.36=0.64) → u_y * 0.8.

u_y is 0.1 c. So u'_y = 0.08 c.

So the components are u'_x = -0.6c, u'_y = 0.08c.

The magnitude of the velocity is sqrt( (0.6c)^2 + (0.08c)^2 ) = c sqrt(0.36 + 0.0064) = c sqrt(0.3664) ≈ 0.605c. Oh, wait, that's option F and G.

Wait, so the speed is sqrt( (0.6)^2 + (0.08)^2 ) c → sqrt(0.36 + 0.0064) → sqrt(0.3664). Let me calculate that. 0.6^2 = 0.36, 0.08^2 = 0.0064, sum is 0.3664. Square root of 0.3664 is 0.605333… which is approximately 0.605c. So that's option F.

But wait, the options have option F as 0.605c in positive y direction without angular deviation. But wait, in our calculation, the y-component is positive. So does that mean the direction is along y only? Because u'_x is negative, but u'_y is positive. So the velocity is at 7 degrees above negative x.

Wait, but in the options, option F is 0.605c in positive y, without any angular change. But according to our calculation, the rocket's velocity has both x and y components. So why is option F an option?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's re-examine. If the rocket's speed is purely along y in S, then in S', its velocity would have a component along x and y. Because when you switch frames, you don't just see the velocity along the same axis. So in S', the velocity would have both x and y components.

Wait, but in our calculation, the x-component is -0.6c and y-component is 0.08c. So that's a vector pointing into negative x and positive y. So the direction is in the second quadrant, making an angle of 7 degrees with the negative x-axis. Because the x-component is opposite in direction, so the angle with the negative x is 7 degrees.

Wait, but in our case, the x-component is -0.6c. So the angle is measured from the negative x-axis. The y-component is positive, so in the second quadrant. So the angle is 7 degrees with the negative x.

Wait, let me compute the angle more accurately. tan(theta) = |u'_y| / |u'_x| ) → 0.08 / 0.6 ≈ 0.1333. So arctan(0.1333) is about 7.63 degrees. So the direction is 7 degrees above the negative x-axis.

So the rocket's speed is 0.605c in the positive y-direction? No, because in S', the y-component is positive. So in S', the rocket is moving in positive y and negative x. So the direction is at 7 degrees above the negative x-axis, but the speed is 0.605c.

Looking at the options, option B says 0.605c in a direction making 7°36' with the negative x-axis. 7.63 degrees is approximately 7°38' (since 0.63 *60 ≈ 38.1), so 7°36' is close. So option B matches.

But wait, what about option D? It says 0.5c in positive y, without any angular change. That's unlikely because our calculation shows a higher speed in the y-direction and a change in direction. Wait, no, because the speed is 0.605c, which is higher than the original 0.1c, but in the y-direction. So option D is not correct.

So the correct answer would be option B: 0.605c in a direction making an angle of 7°36' with the negative x-axis.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The problem says that the observer in S sees the rocket moving at 0.1c in the positive y-direction. So in S, u is (0, 0.1c). Now, S' is moving at 0.6c in the x-direction. So according to the velocity addition, the components are u'_x = -v, and u'_y = 0.8 * 0.1 c = 0.08 c.

So the speed is sqrt( (0.6c)^2 + (0.08c)^2 ) = c * sqrt(0.36 + 0.0064) = c * sqrt(0.3664) ≈ 0.605c. So the speed is 0.605c. The direction is determined by the angle from the negative x-axis. Tan(theta) = (0.08c) / (0.6c) = 1/7.5 ≈ 0.1333. So theta is about 7.63 degrees, which is approximately 7 degrees and 38 minutes. But the options give 7°36'. Hmm, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, wait. Let's compute (0.08)/(0.6) exactly. 0.08/0.6 = 8/60 = 4/30 = 2/15 ≈ 0.13333333.

What's arctangent of (2/15)? Let me calculate it.

Using a calculator, arctan(0.1333) is approximately 7.63 degrees. But the options have 7.63 as 7°38'. Alternatively, perhaps the options are using approximate values.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity transformation. Let me think again about the formula.

Another way to compute the velocity in S' is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, which I think I did correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the rocket's velocity in S is perpendicular to the direction of S' relative to S. So, since u is along the y-axis and S' is moving along the x-axis, the y-component of the velocity in S' will be transformed using the formula.

Wait, but I think that's what I did earlier. So, the calculation seems correct.

So, the rocket's speed is approximately 0.605c, and direction is 7.63 degrees above the negative x-axis, which is approximately 7°38'. But the option B says 7°36'. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the direction is measured from the positive x-axis or negative x-axis. The problem says "the negative direction of the x-axis", so the angle is measured from the negative x-axis. So 7 degrees would be 7 degrees above the negative x-axis, which is the same as 180 - 7 = 173 degrees from the positive x-axis.

So, the direction is 7 degrees relative to the negative x-axis, and speed is 0.605c. So looking at the options, option B matches.

Wait, but option D says 0.5c with no angular change. That's not correct because the speed is higher and the direction is different.

So, the correct answer is B.
</think>

To determine the speed and direction of the rocket as seen by an observer in the S'-system, we use the relativistic velocity transformation equations. The given data is:

- In S, the rocket's velocity is \( u = (0, 0.1c) \), where \( u_x = 0 \) (no motion in the x-direction) and \( u_y = 0.1c \).
- The S'-system moves at \( v = 0.6c \) relative to S along the x-axis.

### Step 1: Velocity Transformation Equations
The velocity transformation equations for each component are:

\[
u'_x = \frac{u_x - v}{1 - \frac{u_x v}{c^2}}
\]
\[
u'_y = \frac{u_y \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}{1 - \frac{u_x v}{c^2}}
\]

### Step 2: Applying the Equations
1. **Compute \( u'_x \):**
   \[
   u'_x = \frac{0 - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{0 \cdot 0.6c}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.6c}{1} = -0.6c
   \]

2. **Compute \( u'_y \):**
   \[
   u'_y = \frac{0.1c \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}}{1 - \frac{0 \cdot 0.6c}{c^2}}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   u'_y = \frac{0.1c \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0.36}}{1} = \frac{0.1c \cdot \sqrt{0.64}}{1} = \frac{0.1c \cdot 0.8}{1} = 0.08c
   \]

### Step 3: Speed in S'
The speed of the rocket in S' is calculated using the magnitude of the velocity vector:
\[
|\mathbf{u}'| = \sqrt{(u'_x)^2 + (u'_y)^2} = \sqrt{(-0.6c)^2 + (0.08c)^2} = \sqrt{0.36c^2 + 0.0064c^2} = \sqrt{0.3664c^2}
\]
\[
|\mathbf{u}'| = c \cdot \sqrt{0.3664} \approx 0.605c
\]

### Step 4: Direction in S'
The direction of the rocket's velocity in S' is determined by the angle \( \theta \) it makes with the negative x-axis:
\[
\tan\theta = \frac{|u'_y|}{|u'_x|} = \frac{0.08c}{0.6c} = \frac{0.08}{0.6} \approx 0.1333
\]
\[
\theta = \arctan(0.1333) \approx 7.63^\circ
\]

Thus, the rocket's speed in S' is approximately \( 0.605c \) and its direction makes an angle of \( 7.63^\circ \) (or approximately \( 7^\circ 38' \)) with the negative x-axis.

### Step 5: Matching with Options
- **Option B:** \( 0.605c \) in a direction making an angle of \( 7^\circ 36' \) with the negative x-axis. This matches closely with our calculation.
- **Option D:** \( 0.5c \) in a direction making an angle of \( 0^\circ \) with the negative x-axis. This is incorrect because the rocket's speed is higher (\( 0.605c \)) and its direction is not purely along the negative x-axis.

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

ANSWER: B
