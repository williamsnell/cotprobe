Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What are the rules regarding the specification of a procedure?

Options:

A: Procedures execute automatically during program execution
B: Procedures require a start statement but do not have a specific ending requirement; they terminate when the program execution completes.
C: Procedures can only be declared at the beginning of the program
D: Procedure blocks must be written in a separate file from the main program and are included during compilation.
E: Procedures can be declared with any number of names, and the END statement is optional, with the block ending at the first RETURN statement.
F: Procedures must be invoked at the start of the program and run continuously until the program ends.
G: Procedure blocks must be labeled with a unique number and can only contain variable declarations.
H: Procedures do not require an end statement
I: Procedures must be declared within the main function and cannot be invoked by other procedures or functions.
J: Procedure block may appear anywhere in the program, must start with a procedure statement with at least one name, must end with an END procedure-name statement, is bypassed during execution unless invoked by a procedure reference.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about programming procedures. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about the rules regarding the specification of a procedure. The options are A through J. I remember that procedures in programming are like functions or subroutines, right? But I'm not entirely sure about all the specifics.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Procedures execute automatically during program execution. Wait, that sounds more like what happens with variables. Variables are just stored and accessed, not executed. So probably not A.

Option B: Procedures require a start statement but don't have a specific ending requirement; they terminate when the program ends. Hmm. I think in some languages, procedures do need an end statement. Like in C, you have a do-while loop with a continue statement, but in some other contexts, like in C's return statement, it's like a return statement which returns and exits the function. Oh, wait, yes, in C, when a function returns, the program ends. So maybe B is correct. Or wait, does a procedure in other languages have to end? Like, in some cases, functions can have return statements, which would end the function. But what about in procedural languages like JVM scripts or JavaScript? Oh, right, in JavaScript, functions don't have a return statement; they just end when they're done. So like, in JavaScript, functions don't return, so they don't have a return statement. So the end is determined by the function's execution. So in that case, a procedure might not require a return or end statement. So perhaps B is correct because it says 'no specific ending requirement; they terminate when the program ends.' But wait, in JavaScript, functions don't end with return, but they end when they're done. So this might be a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe B is incorrect because some procedures do require an end statement.

Option C: Procedures can only be declared at the beginning of the program. That doesn't seem right. I think you can declare procedures anywhere in the code, not just at the beginning. For example, in a function, you can declare a procedure inside it.

Option D: Procedure blocks must be written in a separate file from the main program and are included during compilation. No, that's more about libraries. In procedural languages like Python, you can have code in the main file and use functions imported from a separate module. So D is probably incorrect because it's not a general rule; it's specific to certain languages.

Option E: Procedures can be declared with any number of names, and the END statement is optional, with the block ending at the first RETURN statement. Wait, no, in many languages like C, each function must have a return statement followed by the end of the function. So in that case, the end is via RETURN, not END. But in some other contexts, like in some procedural languages, the end is marked by an END statement. So E could be correct if it's referring to C-like syntax. But I'm not sure. Also, the question is about the specification of a procedure. So, for example, in C, a function must have a return statement and end with end. So a procedure block would require a return statement and end. But option E says END is optional. So I'm not sure. Also, the number of names can varyâ€”maybe in C, you can't have multiple parameters? Or wait, no, C allows functions with any number of parameters. So E's first part about any number of names sounds correct. But the END statement is optional? That doesn't sound right. So probably E is incorrect.

Option F: Procedures must be invoked at the start of the program and run continuously until the program ends. That's not right. You can call a procedure at any time, not just the beginning. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Procedure blocks must be labeled with a unique number and can only contain variable declarations. No, that's not correct. Labels are used for scope management, not for the content. Also, procedure blocks can include statements like if, loops, etc., not just variables. So G is wrong.

Option H: Procedures do not require an end statement. Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Like, in C, functions have return statements and end. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Procedures must be declared within the main function and cannot be invoked by other procedures or functions. No, that's incorrect. Procedures can be declared anywhere, not just main functions. So I is wrong.

Option J: Procedure blocks may appear anywhere in the program, must start with a procedure statement with at least one name, must end with an END procedure-name statement, is bypassed during execution unless invoked by a procedure reference. Hmm, that sounds right. So J is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. So J is about the structure of procedure blocks. Each procedure must be declared with at least one name, and they must be marked with an END statement. So they can be anywhere, not just the beginning. They are bypassed (i.e., not executed) during execution unless they are invoked by another procedure or function. That makes sense.

So looking back, the correct options are J and E. But let's see the options again.

Wait, the options are A to J. Only one correct answer is expected.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option J says: Procedure blocks may appear anywhere in the program, must start with a procedure statement with at least one name, must end with an END procedure-name statement, is bypassed during execution unless invoked by a procedure reference.

That's exactly what I thought about. So J is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought about E. Let me reevaluate E.

Option E: Procedures can be declared with any number of names, and the END statement is optional, with the block ending at the first RETURN statement.

Hmm, in C, functions have a return statement and end. So E is incorrect because in C, you can't have optional END statements. Also, the number of names can vary, but the return is mandatory. So E is wrong.

So the correct answer is J.
</think>

The correct answer is **J**.

**Explanation:**
Option J accurately describes the structure of procedure blocks in programming. Procedure blocks must be declared with at least one name and must end with an `END procedure-name` statement. Importantly, these blocks are bypassed during execution unless invoked by another procedure or function. This aligns with the specifications of procedural languages like C, where functions are defined, can be invoked, and have return statements and end markers. Other options either describe incorrect programming principles or have flaws, making J the correct choice.
