Okay, so I need to find the probability that the product of a and b is positive. Both a and b are real numbers within certain ranges. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that the product of two numbers is positive if both numbers are either positive or both are negative. So, for a·b > 0, either a > 0 and b > 0, or a < 0 and b < 0.

Let me figure out the ranges for a and b. The problem states that a is between -3 and 1, inclusive. So, a can be negative or positive in that interval. Similarly, b is between -2 and 4, so it can also be negative or positive.

I think the best way to visualize this is by using a coordinate system. If I imagine a graph where the x-axis represents a and the y-axis represents b, the total possible area is a rectangle. The length along the a-axis is from -3 to 1, which is a length of 4 units. The length along the b-axis is from -2 to 4, which is 6 units. So the total area is 4 * 6 = 24 square units.

Now, I need to find the area where a·b > 0. That happens in two regions: one where both a and b are positive, and another where both are negative.

Let me break it down:

1. Both a and b are negative:
   - For a: Negative numbers are from -3 to 0. So that's 3 units.
   - For b: Negative numbers are from -2 to 0. That's 2 units.
   - The area here is 3 * 2 = 6 square units.

2. Both a and b are positive:
   - For a: Positive numbers are from 0 to 1. That's 1 unit.
   - For b: Positive numbers are from 0 to 4. That's 4 units.
   - The area here is 1 * 4 = 4 square units.

So, the total favorable area where a·b > 0 is 6 + 4 = 10 square units.

Now, the probability is the favorable area divided by the total area. So that's 10 / 24. Simplifying that, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2, so it becomes 5/12.

Wait, let me double-check. The regions are correct? For a between -3 and 0 is 3 units, b between -2 and 0 is 2 units, so 3*2=6. For a between 0 and 1 is 1 unit, b between 0 and 4 is 4 units, so 1*4=4. Total favorable is 10. Total possible is 4*6=24. 10/24 reduces to 5/12. So the probability is 5/12.

Looking at the options, option E is 5/12, so that should be the answer.

The probability that the product \( a \cdot b \) is positive occurs when either both \( a \) and \( b \) are positive or both are negative. The regions are:

1. **Both negative**: \( a \) from -3 to 0 (3 units), \( b \) from -2 to 0 (2 units). Area = \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \).
2. **Both positive**: \( a \) from 0 to 1 (1 unit), \( b \) from 0 to 4 (4 units). Area = \( 1 \times 4 = 4 \).

Total favorable area = \( 6 + 4 = 10 \). Total possible area = \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \). Probability = \( 10/24 = 5/12 \).
