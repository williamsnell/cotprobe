Okay, so I have this geometry question here about a square-based pyramid. Let me think about what I remember from school. A pyramid is a 3D shape with a polygonal base and triangular faces that meet at a common point, right? So a square-based pyramid has a square as its base.

Wait, the question is asking how many sides there are on the pyramid, including the bottom. Hmm, I'm a bit confused because I remember that the base is considered a face, but when they say "sides," sometimes people count the base as a face. Let me clarify this.

A square has four sides, so the base is a square, which is four-sided. Then there are triangular sides connecting the base to the apex, which is the top point. Since it's a square, there should be four triangular faces. So in total, the base plus the four triangles would be five faces. But wait, the question is about the number of sides, including the bottom. So the base is one face, and then four sides (triangles) attached to it. That would make five sides in total.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again. The term "sides" in a pyramid usually refers to the lateral faces, which are the triangular ones. So if the question is about all the faces, including the base, then it's five. But sometimes, when people say "sides," they might not include the base. Hmm, the question says "including the bottom." So that means the base is included.

So, the square base has four sides, and then four triangular sides. So total of five sides. But looking at the options, option G is five. However, I remember sometimes people count the base as part of the sides, but in some contexts, sides refer to the lateral faces only. Wait, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The square-based pyramid has a square base and four triangular sides. So the faces are 5 in total. But if the question is asking about the sides, does that include the base? The question says "including the bottom," which would mean the base is part of the count. So yes, five sides.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is five. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes "sides" refer only to the triangular faces, not including the base. Let me try to visualize a square-based pyramid. The base is a square, and there are four triangular sides. So if "sides" include the base, that's five. But if they mean the lateral faces (the four triangles), then it's four. So the question is a bit ambiguous in wording.

Wait, the question says "how many sides are on a square-based pyramid, including the bottom." So the bottom refers to the base. So the base is a face, and the rest are the four triangles. So total five faces. So the answer should be G: five.

But wait, wait another moment. I think in some contexts, especially in math, when they say "sides," they might refer only to the triangular faces. Like, a pyramid has a square base and four triangular sides. So the question might be referring to the sides as the four triangles. But the question says including the bottom, which is the base. So the base is a separate face. So the total is five.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me check another angle. The question is about how many sides, including the bottom. So base is one face, and four triangles. That's five. So option G is five.

Alternatively, maybe the person meant the lateral sides, but the question says including the bottom. So I think the correct answer is G: five.
