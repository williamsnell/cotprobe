Okay, so I've got this problem about Eisenstein's criterion. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me recall what Eisenstein's criterion says. From what I remember, it's a way to prove that a polynomial is irreducible over the rationals. So the criterion requires certain conditions to be met by the polynomial.

The given polynomial is 8x³ + 6x² -9x +24. We're talking about whether this is irreducible over Q using Eisenstein's. The options are various p's, like 2,3,5,6,7,8,4, etc. So I need to see if any of these primes satisfy Eisenstein's conditions for this polynomial.

Eisenstein's condition has three parts. For a prime p, if p divides all coefficients except the leading one, and p squared doesn't divide the leading coefficient, and p doesn't divide the constant term, then the polynomial is irreducible.

Wait, let me get that right. So the conditions are:

1. All coefficients except the leading term are divisible by p.
2. The leading coefficient is not divisible by p squared.
3. The constant term is not divisible by p.

If all three are satisfied, then the polynomial is irreducible.

So looking at the given polynomial: 8x³ + 6x² -9x +24.

Let me denote the coefficients as a₀=24, a₁=-9, a₂=6, a₃=8.

I need to see if for any prime p, the above conditions are met.

Let me test each p given in the options. But wait, the options are from A to J, each suggesting a different p. Let me go through each possible p.

Option A: p=7. Let's check.

First, check if 7 divides all coefficients except the leading term. The leading coefficient is 8, which is not divisible by 7. So 8 mod 7 is 1, which isn't 0. So 7 doesn't divide 8. So the first condition is not met. So Eisenstein for p=7 is out.

Option B: No, but it is irreducible over Z. Hmm, but I don't know that yet. I have to check if Eisenstein applies first.

Option C: p=3.

Check condition 1: All coefficients except a₃ are divisible by 3.

a₀=24: 24/3=8, so yes, divisible by 3.

a₁=-9: -9/3=-3, yes.

a₂=6: 6/3=2, yes.

a₃=8: 8/3 is not an integer, so 3 doesn't divide 8. So condition 1 is met.

Condition 2: Does p² divide the leading coefficient? p=3, p²=9. The leading coefficient is 8. 9 doesn't divide 8, so condition 2 is satisfied.

Condition 3: p=3 doesn't divide the constant term a₀=24. 24/3=8, yes, so 3 divides 24. So condition 3 is not met.

Ah, so condition 3 isn't satisfied. So Eisenstein with p=3 fails because p divides the constant term.

Wait, wait, but actually, condition 3 is that p doesn't divide the constant term. So in this case, 3 divides 24, which is the constant term. So condition 3 is violated. So Eisenstein with p=3 isn't applicable here.

So option C is incorrect.

Next, Option D: p=5.

Condition 1: coefficients except a3.

a₀=24: 24 mod 5 is 4 (since 5*4=20, 24-20=4). So 24 is not divisible by 5. So condition 1 fails. So Eisenstein for p=5 is out.

Option E: No, but it's reducible over Z. That's probably incorrect because if Eisenstein applies, it's irreducible. So if Eisenstein doesn't apply, the polynomial could be reducible. But the question is about Eisenstein, so E is about reducibility, but the question is whether it satisfies Eisenstein. So E is a possible answer only if Eisenstein applies. We've ruled out p=7, p=3, and p=5. Let's check p=2 and p=6.

Option F: p=6.

Condition 1: 6 divides a₀=24? Yes, 24/6=4.

6 divides a₁=-9? 9 mod 6 is 3, so no.

So condition 1 fails because 6 doesn't divide all coefficients except the leading term. So Eisenstein with p=6 doesn't work.

Option G: p=8.

Condition 1: 8 divides a₀=24? 24/8=3, yes.

8 divides a₁=-9? 9 mod 8 is 1, so no. So condition 1 is not met.

Option H: p=2.

Condition 1: 2 divides a₀=24? Yes.

2 divides a₁=-9? 9 is odd, so no.

So condition 1 doesn't hold for p=2. So Eisenstein fails.

Option I: No. So if none of the primes in the options satisfy Eisenstein, then the polynomial isn't irreducible by Eisenstein. But maybe I should check p=3 again, but earlier I saw that condition 3 is violated. So let me double-check.

Wait, in condition 3 for p=3, the constant term is 24. So 3 divides 24. So condition 3 is that p doesn't divide the constant term. For p=3, 24 is divisible by 3, so condition 3 is not met.

Wait, let me re-examine. So condition 3 is that p does not divide a₀. So for p=3, 3 divides 24 (since 24/3 is 8), so condition 3 fails. So Eisenstein for p=3 is not applicable.

So looking back, none of the primes in the options satisfy all three conditions of Eisenstein. So the polynomial doesn't satisfy Eisenstein for any of those p's.

Wait, but the question is whether the polynomial satisfies Eisenstein for irreducibility. So if none of the given p's work, then it's not irreducible by Eisenstein, but the question is about whether it's irreducible over Z. Oh, wait, but then the problem could be that Eisenstein isn't applicable, so the polynomial could be reducible.

Wait, no. The question is about whether the polynomial satisfies Eisenstein's criterion for irreducibility. So if it doesn't satisfy Eisenstein for any p in the options, then Eisenstein's criterion does not apply here, and thus we can't conclude irreducibility from it. But the options are about whether the polynomial is irreducible over Z. But the question is phrased: "Determine whether the polynomial in Z[x] satisfies an Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q." So we're to check if Eisenstein's applies.

So if none of the options A-G satisfy Eisenstein, then the answer would be E: No, but it is reducible over Z.

Wait, but the options are about whether it satisfies the Eisenstein criterion. So if none of the p's in the options work, then the polynomial cannot be shown to be irreducible by Eisenstein (because none of the p's meet Eisenstein's conditions). But the question is whether it satisfies Eisenstein, so if none of the options are correct, then the answer is E: No, but it is reducible over Z.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The polynomial is 8x³ +6x² -9x +24.

I should try to factor it. Maybe it's reducible over Z, but Eisenstein doesn't apply. So the question isn't about whether it's irreducible via Eisenstein, but whether it satisfies Eisenstein for irreducibility. So if none of the p's in the options work, then the answer is E: No, but it is reducible over Z.

Wait, but wait. Let me check p=2 again.

Condition 1 for p=2: a₀=24 is even, a₁=-9 is odd, so condition 1 isn't met. So Eisenstein for p=2 is not applicable.

p=3: condition 1 is met, but condition 3 is not. So Eisenstein for p=3 fails.

p=5: condition 1 is not met.

p=7: condition 1 not met.

p=8: condition 1 is met, but condition 3 is not.

p=6: condition 1 is met (since 24/6=4, but 9 is not divisible by 6, so condition 1 fails because 6 doesn't divide all coefficients except a3). So no.

So none of the primes in options A to G meet Eisenstein's conditions. Therefore, the polynomial does not satisfy Eisenstein's for any of those primes, meaning Eisenstein's criterion doesn't apply, and the polynomial may be reducible. So the answer is E: No, but it is reducible over Z.

Wait, but could the polynomial factor in some way that isn't caught by Eisenstein and is still irreducible? But Eisenstein can't prove irreducibility, it can only show it if it satisfies Eisenstein. But in this case, none of the p's in the options satisfy Eisenstein. So the polynomial is not shown to be irreducible via Eisenstein. So the answer is E: No, but it is reducible over Z.
</think>

The polynomial \(8x^3 + 6x^2 -9x +24\) is not irreducible over \(\mathbb{Q}\) by Eisenstein's criterion for any of the given primes \(p\). None of the primes \(p\) in options A to G satisfy all three Eisenstein conditions. Therefore, the polynomial is reducible over \(\mathbb{Z}\), and the correct answer is E.

Answer: E
