Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that light with a wavelength of 400 nm is incident upon lithium, and the work function of lithium is 2.93 eV. They're asking me to calculate the photon energy in eV. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, the photon's energy, but lithium's work function is given. Oh, right, because the energy of the photon must be higher than the work function for it to eject electrons.

Wait, but the question is just asking for the photon energy, regardless of whether it's enough to eject electrons. Oh, but wait, no. Because the work function is the minimum energy needed. So the photon's energy must be greater than the work function. But in this question, they're just asking for the photon's energy, so I think I can ignore that part. Let me focus on what's given.

The wavelength is 400 nm. I remember the formula that relates wavelength to energy. The energy (E) of a photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. But wait, I think it's easier to convert nm to meters for calculation. Alternatively, I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules, and the wavelength can be converted using E= (1240 eV·nm)/λ.

Oh right, because E in eV is 1240 divided by the wavelength in nm. So 400 nm would give E = 1240 / 400. Let me calculate that. 1240 divided by 400. Well, 400 goes into 1240 three times because 400 *3 is 1200. So 1240-1200 is 40, which is 0.1. So 3.1 eV. Wait, so that's 3.1 eV. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option G is 3.1 eV. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but wait, I'm just being a bit nitpicky. The problem might be asking for something else, but no, the question just says 'calculate the photon energy in eV'. So since the photon's energy is 3.1 eV, the correct option is G. But wait, another thought—are there any exceptions? Like, sometimes when I'm dealing with work function, I might confuse whether it's the photon's energy that's being asked. But no, the question says 'photon energy', so I don't need to consider the work function. Oh, but wait, the work function is given, but the question is about the photon's energy. So yeah, just using the formula for photon energy based on wavelength is the way to go.

So the correct answer should be option G: 3.1 eV.

To calculate the photon energy for light incident on lithium with a wavelength of 400 nm, we use the formula:

\[
E = \frac{1240 \, \text{eV·nm}}{\lambda}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength in nanometers. Substituting \( \lambda = 400 \, \text{nm} \):

\[
E = \frac{1240}{400} = 3.1 \, \text{eV}
\]

The work function of lithium (2.93 eV) is provided but is not directly relevant to calculating the photon energy in this context. The photon energy is independent of the work function, as it only depends on the wavelength.

From the options provided, the correct answer is **G: 3.1 eV**.
