Question:

What is the 'equitable result' in the law and practice of maritime delimitation?

Options:

A: It is the only method of delimitation that international courts and tribunals follow
B: An equitable result is what a judge or the arbitrator would decide ex aequo et bono, i.e. upon their discretion and in light of what they consider as fair and equitable in a delimitation case
C: It is the end result that all delimitations of areas of continental shelf and EEZ should achieve, after, however, drawing a provisional 'equidistance line' and adjusting the zone in the light of the relevant circumstances and the proportionality test.
D: Achieving an equitable result is an old method of delimitation which is currently not applicable

Okay, so I need to figure out what the equitable result is in the law and practice of maritime delimitation. Let me start by recalling what I know about maritime delimitation. I remember that delimitation is the process of determining the boundaries between countries, especially around the coast of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The key issue is deciding where a country's land extends into another country's sea.

Now, thinking about the equitability in this context. I think the equitability principle is about fairness. So, an equitable result would be one that's fair to all parties involved, ensuring that neither the parties nor the government have an unfair advantage.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's the only method international courts follow. I don't think that's right. I remember that sometimes international law might not strictly follow it, but it's more about the practice of the courts.

Option B says it's what a judge or arbitrator would decide ex aequo et bono, meaning on their discretion and in a fair, equitable way. That sounds familiar. I think that's the definition of equitable result.

Option C mentions a provisional equidistance line and adjusting zones. That sounds more like a specific method or process, not the result itself. So probably not the equitable result.

Option D says it's an old method not applicable now. I don't recall that being the case. The equitability principle is more relevant now.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be B because it describes what the equitable result entails: a fair, equitable decision by a judge or arbitrator.

The equitable result in maritime delimitation refers to a fair and equitable decision made by a judge or arbitrator, as described in option B.

Answer: B
