Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, it's about a collision between a toy car and a toy truck. The question is about the accelerations during the collision. 

Alright, so the setup: the truck's mass is double that of the car. Wait, so mass of truck is 2m and car is m, right? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? Let me make sure. The problem says the truck's mass is double the car's. So if the car is m, the truck is 2m. Yeah, that makes sense.

The question is about comparing the acceleration of the car to the acceleration of the truck during the collision. So we're looking for the ratio of their accelerations. Wait, but I'm not sure if it's acceleration of the car compared to the truck's. Oh wait, the question says, "compared to the acceleration of the truck, the acceleration of the car..." Wait no, let me read again. Oh, no, wait the question is phrased as: "the acceleration of the car during the collision will be compared to the acceleration of the truck." Oh wait, that's the order. So, acceleration of car compared to acceleration of truck.

Wait no, no. The question says, "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Oh wait, sorry, the question is: "the acceleration of the car during the collision will be compared to the acceleration of the truck." So, the car's acceleration compared to the truck's. So, if the car's acceleration is 'a1' and the truck's is 'a2', then the question is asking what a1 is compared to a2.

Wait, no, wait no. Let me read the question again: "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Oh, no, wait, the question is phrased as: "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Oh wait, the question is, "the acceleration of the car during the collision will be compared to the acceleration of the truck." So, car's acceleration compared to truck's. So, a_car vs a_truck.

Wait, but in collisions, momentum is conserved. So, let's think about that. Let's assume they are moving towards each other before the collision. Let me think about the initial moment, maybe the car is moving right and the truck is moving left. So, their velocities are opposite.

But wait, in terms of momentum and acceleration during collision, it's about the impulse, which is force times time, but perhaps we can relate using momentum.

The key here is that during a collision, the forces are internal, so there's no external force (assuming a closed system). So, the total momentum before equals the total momentum after. But what's important here is the change in momentum for each object.

Wait, another approach: Newton's second law. So, F = ma. But since the forces during collision are internal, the collision doesn't impart external forces. So, the total momentum is conserved.

Wait, but when two objects collide, there's an exchange of momentum. Let's think about the case where one object is much more massive than the other.

Suppose the truck is much more massive than the car. Let's say the truck has mass 2m, car is m.

Let’s assume that before collision, the car is moving with velocity v, and the truck is moving with velocity u. But in which direction? Let's say the car is moving to the right, and the truck to the left. So, the car's velocity is +v, truck's is -u.

So the initial momenta are: car: m*v, truck: 2m*(-u) = -2mu.

Total initial momentum: m*v - 2mu.

After collision, both will have some new velocities. Let's say the car's velocity becomes v', and the truck's becomes u'. 

So, the final momenta are: m*v' and 2m*u'.

Conservation of momentum: m*v - 2m u = m*v' + 2m u'.

Divide both sides by m: v - 2u = v' + 2u'

But wait, that's the equation from momentum conservation. But how does this relate to the accelerations?

Hmm, acceleration is change in velocity over time. But during the collision, the time of collision (time during which they exert forces on each other) is the same for both. So, the change in velocity for each is (final - initial) / same delta t.

But in the problem, perhaps we're considering the magnitudes of acceleration, but the direction matters.

Wait, but in the question, the options are about the magnitude and direction. So, let's think about this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think about the impulse. Impulse is force times time, which equals change in momentum. But during the collision, the forces are internal, so the total impulse on the system is zero. So, the initial and final momenta are the same.

Wait, but how does that help us with acceleration?

Alternatively, let's think about the momentum exchange.

The change in momentum for the car is m(v' - v), and the change for the truck is 2m(u' - u).

But since the system's momentum is conserved, the sum of the changes must be zero.

Wait, but the car is lighter, so perhaps it gains a larger change in momentum and the truck a smaller change.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to think about the relative accelerations. Wait, if the truck is much heavier, would its acceleration be smaller than the car's.

Wait, let's think about an example. Suppose the car has mass m, truck 2m.

Both are moving toward each other. Let's say the car has initial speed v, truck has speed u (but opposite direction, maybe u to the left, so velocity is -u).

After collision, perhaps the car's velocity becomes v', and the truck's becomes u'.

But what's the acceleration? a_car = (v' - v)/Δt, a_truck = (u' - (-u))/Δt = (u' + u)/Δt.

Wait, but we don't know the exact Δt, but it's the same for both.

But perhaps we can relate the accelerations through the change in momentum.

Wait, another approach: change in momentum equals impulse (force * time). But since the forces are internal, the total impulse is zero. So, the change in momentum of the car is - change in momentum of the truck.

Wait, but that's the same as conservation of momentum.

Wait, but the acceleration is delta p / delta t, so a = F/m.

Wait, but during collision, the forces (impulse) are not known, but the change in momentum is known.

Wait, perhaps I should use the concept that in a collision, the force experienced by each object is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But the acceleration is F/m.

Wait, but since the forces are equal and opposite, the accelerations would be a_car = F / m, a_truck = ( -F ) / (2m) = -F/(2m). So, a_car is F/m, a_truck is -F/(2m). So, the magnitude of a_car is F/m, and a_truck is (F/(2m)) but in the opposite direction.

Wait, but that would imply that the magnitudes are F/m for car and F/(2m) for truck. So, the car's acceleration is double that of the truck's, but wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, let's think again.

If the forces F and -F (assuming F is the force on the car), then:

a_car = F/m

a_truck = F/(2m) but since the force is opposite, it's -F/(2m).

So a_car is F/m, a_truck is -F/(2m). So, the magnitudes are F/m and F/(2m), but the directions are opposite.

Wait, so the magnitude of the car's acceleration is (F/m), the truck's is (F/(2m)), but since a_truck is negative, it's in the opposite direction.

Wait, but the question is about the acceleration of the car compared to the truck's acceleration. So, a_car is F/m, a_truck is -F/(2m). So, a_car is double the magnitude (since F/m is twice F/(2m)) and in the same direction as a_truck. Wait, but a_truck is in the direction of the force applied, which might be opposite.

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relative acceleration. Let me think about the concept of relative acceleration during the collision.

In collisions, the relative velocity of the objects is reversed. So, if the car approaches the truck with a certain velocity, and after collision, the relative velocity is the opposite.

Wait, but how does this relate to acceleration?

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the concept of momentum transfer. The change in momentum of each object during the collision.

So, for the car, the change in momentum is m(v' - v). For the truck, it's 2m(u' - u).

But from the conservation of momentum, m(v - u) = m v' + 2m u'.

Wait, but let's think about the change in momentum.

Wait, the car's change in momentum is m(v' - v), and the truck's is 2m(u' - u).

But from the conservation equation:

m(v - u) = m v' + 2m u'

Dividing both sides by m:

(v - u) = v' + 2u'

So,

v' = (v - u) - 2u' ?

Hmm, perhaps not the most helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the impulse experienced by each object. Since the collision is internal, the total impulse on the system is zero. So, the change in momentum of the car equals the negative of the change in momentum of the truck.

So,

m(v' - v) = - [2m(u' - u)]

Which simplifies to:

m(v' - v) = -2m(u' - u)

Divide both sides by m:

v' - v = -2(u' - u)

v' - v = -2u' + 2u

=> v' = -2u' +2u +v

Hmm. Not sure if that helps.

But wait, the acceleration is (v' - v)/Δt and (u' - u)/Δt for each.

But since Δt is the same, we can compare the accelerations.

Alternatively, let's suppose that the time of collision is Δt.

So, a_car = (v' - v) / Δt

a_truck = (u' - u) / Δt

The question is, how is a_car and a_truck related.

But from the change in momentum for each:

m (v' - v) = F_car * Δt. Because F_car is the force on the car, and F_car = ma_car.

Similarly, 2m (u' - u) = F_truck * Δt.

But since F_car and F_truck are internal forces, they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So F_car = -F_truck.

So, m (v' - v) = - F_truck * Δt

and 2m (u' - u) = F_truck * Δt.

Adding these two equations:

m(v' -v) + 2m(u' - u) = 0

Which is the same as before.

But how does this relate to acceleration? Let me see.

From the first equation:

v' - v = (-F_truck * Δt) / m

From the second equation:

u' - u = (F_truck * Δt) / (2m)

So,

a_car = (v' -v)/Δt = [ (-F_truck * Δt) / m ] / Δt = (-F_truck)/(m)

a_truck = (u' -u)/Δt = [ (F_truck * Δt)/(2m) ] / Δt = F_truck/(2m)

So, a_car = (-F_truck)/m, a_truck = F_truck/(2m)

So, the magnitude of a_car is F_truck/m, and the magnitude of a_truck is F_truck/(2m). So, the car's acceleration is double the magnitude of the truck's acceleration, but in opposite directions.

Wait, but the question is about the acceleration of the car compared to the acceleration of the truck.

Wait, the car's acceleration is ( - F_truck ) / m, and the truck's is ( F_truck ) / ( 2 m ). So, the magnitudes are F_truck/m (car) and F_truck/(2m) (truck). So, the car's magnitude is double the truck's, but the directions are opposite. So, the car's acceleration is twice that of the truck's (in magnitude) but in the opposite direction.

Wait, but the question isn't about the magnitudes. Wait, the question is: the acceleration of the car will be compared to the acceleration of the truck. So, the magnitude and direction.

Wait, the car's acceleration is in the opposite direction to the truck's. Because a_car is negative F_truck/m, while a_truck is positive F_truck/(2m). So, they are opposite.

So, the magnitude of the car's acceleration is twice that of the truck's. Direction is opposite.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer was that the car's acceleration is double in magnitude, same direction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-express.

Wait, from the earlier analysis:

a_car = (-F_truck)/m

a_truck = F_truck/(2m)

So, a_car is ( -1 ) * ( F_truck/m )

Which is equal to ( -2 ) * ( F_truck/(2m) )

So, a_car = -2 * a_truck.

So, the car's acceleration is twice as big as the truck's, but in the opposite direction.

Wait, but the question is asking, "the acceleration of the car during the collision will be compared to the acceleration of the truck." So the options are about the magnitude and direction.

So, does the car's acceleration have a larger magnitude but opposite direction, or same direction?

Wait, in my earlier analysis, I thought that the car's acceleration is double the truck's in magnitude but opposite direction. But this is because the F_car is equal in magnitude to F_truck, but opposite in direction.

Wait, but in terms of the car's acceleration, if a_car = ( - F_truck ) / m, and a_truck = ( F_truck ) / ( 2m ), then a_car is -2 a_truck. So, a_car is double the magnitude of a_truck but in the opposite direction.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A: four times the magnitude and same direction

B: half, opposite

C: double, same direction

D: triple, opposite

E: equal, opposite

F: double, opposite

G: four times, opposite

H: same, same

I: half, same

J: triple, same

So, the options are all about same direction or opposite. Let me see what I concluded.

In the analysis, the car's acceleration is opposite to the truck's. And its magnitude is twice that of the truck's. So, the acceleration of the car is in the opposite direction and twice the magnitude of the truck's.

Looking at the options, option F is 'double the magnitude and opposite.'

Wait, but the options don't have a 'same direction' or 'twice magnitude opposite' option. Wait, no, F is 'double the magnitude and opposite direction', which is the case.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Another approach: since the truck is heavier, perhaps it's easier for the car to change velocity more, leading to a higher acceleration. Wait, but another way: if the truck is more massive, its acceleration would be smaller if the same force is applied, but in this case, it's a collision.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this using the concept of momentum transfer. The change in momentum of each object during the collision.

The change in momentum for the car is m(v' - v), and for the truck, 2m(u' - u).

Since the total momentum is conserved, m(v - u) = m v' + 2m u'.

But the change in momentum for the car is m(v' - v), and for the truck is 2m(u' - u).

But how do I relate this to acceleration?

Wait, acceleration is change in velocity over time. So, a_car = (v' - v)/Δt, a_truck = (u' - u)/Δt.

But from the collision, it's possible to find that:

The change in velocity of the car is (v' - v) = (F_car / m) * Δt.

The change in velocity of the truck is (u' - u) = (F_truck / (2m)) * Δt.

But the net change in momentum must be zero, so:

m(v' - v) + 2m(u' - u) = 0.

Substituting the expressions for change in velocity:

m * [ (F_car / m) Δt ] + 2m * [ (F_truck / (2m) ) Δt ] = 0.

Simplify:

(F_car Δt) + ( F_truck Δt ) = 0.

Which again gives F_car = - F_truck.

So, F_car is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to F_truck.

So, the change in velocity for the car is (F_car / m) * Δt = (-F_truck / m) * Δt.

Change in velocity for the truck is (F_truck / (2m)) ) * Δt.

So, a_car = [ (-F_truck / m ) * Δt ] / Δt = (-F_truck)/m.

a_truck = [ (F_truck / (2m) ) * Δt ] / Δt = F_truck/(2m).

So, a_car = - (F_truck/m), a_truck = (F_truck)/(2m).

So, the car's acceleration is - (F_truck/m) and the truck's is (F_truck)/(2m).

So, the car's acceleration is twice the magnitude of the truck's acceleration, but in the opposite direction.

Wait, but the question is: "the acceleration of the car will be compared to the acceleration of the truck." So, the car's acceleration is in the opposite direction to the truck's and twice as big.

So, looking at the options, that's option F: "double the magnitude and opposite direction."

Wait, but in the options, the answer is not present. Let me recheck.

Wait, let me think about this another way. Suppose the car is moving at velocity v, and the truck is moving at velocity u. Let's say the car and truck are moving towards each other, so v is positive and u is negative.

Wait, so initial momentum is m*v + 2m*(-u) = m*v - 2m u.

After collision, their velocities are v' and u', so the final momentum is m*v' + 2m u'.

Conservation gives:

m*v - 2m u = m*v' + 2m u'.

Divide both sides by m:

v - 2u = v' + 2u'.

So, v' = v - 2u - 2u'.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

But let's consider the acceleration.

a_car = (v' - v)/Δt

a_truck = (u' - u)/Δt

We can write:

a_car = (v' - v) / Δt

a_truck = (u' - u) / Δt

But from the equation v' + 2u' = v - 2u,

We can write v' = v - 2u - 2u'

Substituting into a_car:

a_car = ( (v - 2u - 2u') - v ) / Δt = ( -2u - 2u' ) / Δt

a_car = -2 (u + u') / Δt

Similarly, a_truck = (u' - u) / Δt

So, a_car = -2 (u + u') / Δt

a_truck = (u' - u) / Δt

Let me compute a_car in terms of a_truck.

a_car = -2 (u + u') / Δt

But (u' - u) = - (u - u') 

Wait, perhaps it's better to express u + u' in terms of something else.

Alternatively, let's think of the ratio.

(a_car)/(a_truck) = [ -2 (u + u') / Δt ] / [ (u' - u)/Δt ] 

Δt cancels.

= [ -2 (u + u') ] / (u' - u )

= [ -2 (u + u') ] / ( -(u - u') )

= [ -2 (u + u') ] / [ - (u - u') ]

= [ 2 (u + u') ] / ( u - u' )

Hmm. Let's see.

But we don't know the values of u and u'. Wait, in the initial setup, u is the initial velocity of the truck, which I've assumed to be negative because it's moving towards the car with the car moving in the positive direction.

Wait, but without knowing the actual values, it's difficult to find the ratio.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach. Let's think about the relative velocities.

In the absence of external forces, the velocity of each object changes in such a way that the relative velocity of the objects remains constant.

Wait, but in a collision, the relative velocity reverses.

Wait, so before collision, the car is moving at v, and the truck is moving at u (which is opposite to the car's direction, perhaps u = -v'.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the concept of relative acceleration.

The acceleration of the car is a_car = dv/dt.

The acceleration of the truck is a_truck = du/dt.

Since the collision is internal, the net force on the system is zero, which implies that the change in momentum for the car and the truck must cancel each other.

But perhaps the acceleration of the car and the acceleration of the truck are related.

Wait, let's think of the ratio a_car / a_truck.

From the initial equation:

v - 2u = v' + 2u'

Let me rearrange:

v - v' = 2u + 2u' 

Divide both sides by 2:

(v - v')/2 = u + u'

Hmm.

The acceleration of the car is (v' - v)/Δt.

The acceleration of the truck is (u' - u)/Δt.

So, a_car = (v' - v)/Δt.

a_truck = (u' - u)/Δt.

So, the ratio a_car / a_truck is [ (v' - v) / (u' - u) ].

So, (v' - v) = (a_car) Δt.

(u' - u) = (a_truck) Δt.

So, substituting into the earlier equation:

v - v' = 2u + 2u'

Which is v - v' = 2(u + u')

But from a_car and a_truck:

v' - v = a_car Δt

u' - u = a_truck Δt

So, substituting into v - v':

v - v' = (v - v') = (v - v') = (a_car Δt) (since v' - v = - (a_car Δt)).

So, v - v' = - (a_car Δt )

Which equals 2 (u + u').

Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the car and truck are moving towards each other with some velocities, and the collision causes them to exchange velocities in some way.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that the acceleration of the car is a_car, and the acceleration of the truck is a_truck.

From the force balance, since the forces are internal, the sum of the forces on the car equals that on the truck, but that's a bit abstract.

But another approach: since the collision is inelastic, the kinetic energy is lost, but the momentum is conserved.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of relative velocity.

The relative velocity of the truck with respect to the car before collision is u - v.

Wait, but that's the initial velocities, but in reality, the car is moving towards the truck, and the truck is moving in the opposite direction.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the relative velocities after collision.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think of the options and try to reason.

The options are:

A: four times, same direction

B: half, opposite

C: double, same

D: triple, opposite

E: equal, opposite

F: double, opposite

G: four times, opposite

H: same, same

I: half, same

J: triple, same

So, the options suggest that the acceleration of the car is either same, opposite, double, etc.

We know that the acceleration of the car is in the opposite direction to the truck's acceleration, and its magnitude is twice that of the truck's.

So, the correct option would be F: 'double the magnitude and opposite direction.'

But wait, looking at the options again:

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine.

Wait, when I derived a_car = -2 * a_truck, that would mean that the car's acceleration is twice the magnitude of the truck's acceleration but in the opposite direction. So, the correct option is F.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 'double the magnitude and opposite direction.'

So, that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I also thought about the relative velocities and acceleration.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's assume that the car and truck have the same mass, and it's a collision. So, in that case, the acceleration of the car would be equal to the acceleration of the truck, but that's not the case here.

Wait, but in this problem, the masses are different. The truck is twice as massive as the car.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider the ratios.

The acceleration of the car is a_car.

The acceleration of the truck is a_truck.

From the equations:

a_car = F_car / m

a_truck = F_truck / (2m)

But F_car = -F_truck.

So,

a_car = -F_truck / m

a_truck = F_truck / (2m)

So,

a_car = -2 * (F_truck / (2m)) ) * (m/m) ) → Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Wait, let me express a_car in terms of a_truck.

a_car = ( -F_truck ) / m

a_truck = F_truck / (2m )

So,

a_car = ( - (F_truck) / m ) 

= ( - ( (F_truck) / ( (2m) ) ) ) * ( (2m) / m ) )

= a_truck * (2m / m) * ( -1 )

Wait, that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, let me compute the ratio a_car / a_truck.

a_car / a_truck = ( (-F_truck)/m ) / ( F_truck/(2m) ) )

Simplify:

= ( (-F_truck)/m ) * (2m/F_truck )

= (-F_truck * 2m ) / ( m F_truck )

= (-2) 

So, a_car / a_truck = -2 → a_car = -2 a_truck.

So, the car's acceleration is twice the magnitude of the truck's but in the opposite direction. So, the correct option is F: 'double the magnitude and opposite direction.'

Wait, but earlier I thought that the correct answer was that the car's acceleration is double the magnitude of the truck's. But the options include F as 'double the magnitude and opposite direction.'

Wait, but in the problem, the car is heavier, not lighter. So, the acceleration of the car should be less than that of the truck, but in the opposite direction. So, the car's acceleration is half the magnitude of the truck's acceleration but in the opposite direction.

Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, let me re-express.

From the change in momentum:

m (v' - v) = F_car * Δt

2m (u' - u) = F_truck * Δt

Because F_car = -F_truck.

So,

m (v' - v) + 2m (u' - u) = 0

Divide by m:

(v' - v) + 2 (u' - u) = 0

So,

v' - v = - 2 (u' - u )

So,

a_car = (v' -v)/Δt = [ -2 (u' - u) ] / Δt

a_truck = (u' -u)/Δt

So,

a_car = -2 a_truck

So, the car's acceleration is twice the magnitude of the truck's acceleration, but in the opposite direction.

So, the correct option is F.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option F is 'double the magnitude and opposite direction,' which matches our conclusion.

But wait, earlier I thought that a_car = -2 a_truck, so the magnitude is twice, and direction is opposite. So, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but the options give:

F: double the magnitude and opposite.

So, according to that, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused because earlier I thought that a_car is double the truck's in magnitude, but that's not the case. Because a_car = -2 a_truck. So, the car's acceleration is double in magnitude but opposite in direction to the truck's.

So, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

F: double the magnitude and opposite.

So, that's the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the answer was that the car's acceleration is double the magnitude of the truck's, but that's not correct because the direction is opposite.

So, the correct answer is F.

Wait, no, wait. Because in the collision, the truck, being heavier, would have a smaller acceleration than the car. But according to our analysis, the car's acceleration is twice that of the truck's. So, that contradicts intuition.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of the conservation of momentum leading to a situation where the heavier object has a smaller acceleration.

Wait, let me think in terms of the momentum and acceleration.

The momentum change of the car is m (v' - v )

The momentum change of the truck is 2m (u' - u )

Since the system's momentum is conserved, these two changes must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

So, m (v' - v ) = - 2m (u' - u )

Which simplifies to:

(v' - v) = -2 (u' - u )

So,

v' - v = -2 u' + 2 u

So,

v' = v - 2 u' + 2 u

Hmm, but without knowing the values of u' and u, it's difficult to proceed.

Wait, but perhaps we can express u' in terms of u.

Wait, but since the car and truck are moving towards each other, and the collision causes them to exchange velocities, perhaps u' = -u.

Wait, that could be a possibility. Let's assume that.

So, if u = v, and u' = -u, then u' = -v.

So, plugging into the equation:

v' = v - 2 (-v) + 2 v 

= v + 2v + 2v 

= 5v 

Wait, but that seems too high.

Hmm, but perhaps that's not a valid assumption.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is better.

Let me consider the case where the truck is heavier, so m = 1, so 2m = 2.

Let me assume that before the collision, the car is moving at velocity v and the truck is moving at velocity u, which is in the opposite direction, so u = -v.

So, u = -v.

Now, after the collision, the car's velocity is v', and the truck's velocity is u'.

We can use the conservation of momentum equation.

Initial momentum: m v + 2m u = 1*v + 2*1*(-v) = v - 2v = -v.

Final momentum: m v' + 2m u' = 1*v' + 2*1*u' = v' + 2u'.

Conservation gives:

v' + 2u' = -v.

So,

v' + 2u' = -v.

Now, we can relate the velocities of the car and truck after collision.

In a collision, the relative velocity reverses.

So,

u' - v' = -(u - v )

Because before collision, the relative velocity of the truck with respect to the car was (u - v), but after the collision, it's (u' - v'), and since the car slows down and the truck speeds up, the relative velocity reverses.

Wait, but this is an assumption. Let's proceed.

So,

u' - v' = -(u - v )

But u = -v, so:

u' - v' = - ( (-v) - v ) = - ( -v - v ) = - ( -2v ) = 2v.

So,

u' - v' = 2v.

So,

u' = v' + 2v.

Now, substitute u' into the momentum equation:

v' + 2u' = -v.

u' = v' + 2v.

So,

v' + 2(v' + 2v) = -v.

Expand:

v' + 2v' + 4v = -v.

Combine like terms:

3v' + 4v = -v.

Subtract 4v from both sides:

3v' = -5v.

Divide by 3:

v' = (-5/3) v.

Hmm, but that's a negative value, which would imply that the car is moving in the opposite direction.

Wait, but that suggests that the car's velocity after collision is (-5/3) v, which is indeed opposite to the initial velocity.

Wait, but the initial velocity of the car was v, positive, and the truck was moving in the opposite direction at u = -v.

So, after the collision, the car is moving in the opposite direction, with a velocity of (-5/3) v, which is more negative than the initial velocity.

Hmm, that seems strange, but let's proceed.

Now, the acceleration of the car is a_car = (v' - v)/Δt.

v' is (-5/3) v.

v is v.

So,

a_car = [ (-5/3 v) - v ] / Δt.

= [ (-5/3 v - 3/3 v) ] / Δt.

= [ (-8/3 v) ] / Δt.

= (-8/3 v) / Δt.

Similarly, the acceleration of the truck is a_truck = (u' - u)/Δt.

u' is v' + 2v = (-5/3 v) + 2v.

= (-5/3 v) + (6/3 v).

= (1/3 v).

u is -v.

So,

a_truck = [ (1/3 v) - (-v) ] / Δt.

= [ (1/3 v + v ) ] / Δt.

= (4/3 v) / Δt.

So,

a_car = (-8/3 v) / Δt,

a_truck = (4/3 v) / Δt.

So,

a_car = (-2) * (4/3 v / Δt )

= (-2) * a_truck.

Which means,

a_car = -2 a_truck.

So, the car's acceleration is twice the magnitude of the truck's acceleration, but in the opposite direction.

So, the correct answer is F: double the magnitude and opposite direction.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the car's acceleration is twice the magnitude of the truck's, but in the opposite direction. So, the correct option is F.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the acceleration of the car is double the magnitude of the truck's, but that's not correct because the direction is opposite.

So, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but I'm seeing conflicting conclusions. Let me try to think differently.

In a perfectly elastic collision, the velocities are exchanged, but in a perfectly inelastic collision, the objects stick together.

But in this case, since the car and truck are different masses, the collision is not perfectly inelastic. So, the objects will separate.

But the relative velocity reverses.

So, the approach is correct, and the conclusion is that the car's acceleration is double the magnitude of the truck's, but in the opposite direction.

Therefore, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, in the calculation, I found that a_car = (-8/3 v) / Δt,

a_truck = (4/3 v) / Δt.

So, a_car = (-2) * (4/3 v / Δt ) = (-2) a_truck.

Which means a_car is twice as large as a_truck, but in the opposite direction.

So, the correct answer is F.

So, the correct answer is F.
</think>

The correct answer is **F: double the magnitude and opposite direction**.

### Analysis

1. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - The total momentum before and after the collision remains the same.
   - Let the car have mass \( m \) and the truck \( 2m \).
   - Initial momentum: \( m \cdot v + 2m \cdot (-v) = -mv \).
   - Final momentum: \( m \cdot v' + 2m \cdot u' = -mv \).
   - Thus, \( v' + 2u' = -v \).

2. **Relative Velocity**:
   - The relative velocity before the collision is \( u - v \).
   - After the collision, the relative velocity reverses: \( u' - v' = -(u - v) \).
   - Substituting \( u = -v \), we get \( u' - v' = 2v \).

3. **Solving for \( v' \) and \( u' \)**:
   - Substitute \( u' = v' + 2v \) into the momentum equation:
     \[
     v' + 2(v' + 2v) = -v \implies 3v' + 4v = -v \implies v' = -\frac{5}{3}v.
     \]
   - Then, \( u' = v' + 2v = -\frac{5}{3}v + 2v = \frac{1}{3}v \).

4. **Acceleration Calculations**:
   - Acceleration of the car: \( a_{\text{car}} = \frac{v' - v}{\Delta t} = \frac{-\frac{5}{3}v - v}{\Delta t} = -\frac{8}{3}v/\Delta t \).
   - Acceleration of the truck: \( a_{\text{truck}} = \frac{u' - u}{\Delta t} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}v - (-v)}{\Delta t} = \frac{4}{3}v/\Delta t \).
   - Thus, \( a_{\text{car}} = -2a_{\text{truck}} \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The car's acceleration is twice the magnitude of the truck's acceleration, but in the opposite direction.
