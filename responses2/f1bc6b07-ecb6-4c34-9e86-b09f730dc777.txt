Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here: evaluate log base 3 of 81. Hmm, logarithms can be a bit tricky sometimes, but I remember that they're about finding the exponent. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I recall that log_b a = c means that b raised to the power of c equals a. In this case, b is 3, a is 81, so I need to find c such that 3^c = 81.

Wait, 3 to the power of what gives me 81? Let me try multiplying powers of 3. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, and 3^4 is 81. Oh, right! So 3^4 is 81, which means c must be 4. Therefore, log base 3 of 81 is 4.

Looking at the options, option E is 4, so that must be the answer. Let me double-check just to be sure. Yeah, 3 times 3 is 9, times another 3 is 27, and one more 3 gives 81. So four multiplications of 3, which aligns with c=4. So yes, E is correct.

The logarithm $\log_3 81$ evaluates to the exponent required to express 81 as a power of 3. Since $3^4 = 81$, the solution is $4$. 

Answer: E
