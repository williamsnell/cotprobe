Okay, so I've got this math problem here about least common multiples and greatest common divisors. Let me read it again. The problem says that the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers is 240, and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 24. One of the integers is 48, and I need to find the other integer. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember there's a formula that connects LCM and GCD of two numbers. Oh right, it's something like LCM(a, b) multiplied by GCD(a, b) equals the product of a and b. So, LCM(a, b) × GCD(a, b) = a × b. That makes sense, but let me think of the exact formula. Yes, LCM(a,b) * GCD(a,b) = a * b. So, in this case, LCM is 240 and GCD is 24. Let me plug those into the formula.

So, 240 multiplied by 24 equals a times b. Wait, but I know one of the numbers is 48. Let's denote the other number as x. So, 240 * 24 = 48 * x. Let me compute 240 times 24 first. 240 times 24 is... 240 * 20 is 4800, and 240 *4 is 960, so adding them gives 5760. So, 48 * x = 5760. To find x, I just divide both sides by 48.

So, x = 5760 / 48. Let me do that division. 48 goes into 5760 how many times? Well, 48 times 100 is 4800. 5760 minus 4800 is 960. 48 goes into 960 exactly 20 times because 48*20=960. So 100 + 20 is 120. So x is 120. Let me check the options. Option C is 120, so that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I should verify using the GCD. Because sometimes when I do math quickly, I might have a mistake. Let me think: if one number is 48 and the other is 120, what is their GCD and LCM?

First, find the GCD of 48 and 120. Let's break them down into factors. 48 is 16 * 3, which is 2^4 * 3^1. 120 is 8 * 15, which is 2^3 * 3^1 *5^1. The GCD is the product of the smallest exponents of the shared prime factors. So, 2^3 and 3^1, so that's 8*3=24. That matches the given GCD.

Now, the LCM is the product of the highest exponents of all primes present. So, primes are 2,3,5. The highest exponents are 2^4, 3^1, and 5^1. So, 16 *3 *5 = 16*15=240. That matches the given LCM. So yes, 120 is correct. So the answer is C.

The correct answer is C: 120.
