Question:

William Accra has found that his company's output is increasing radically each week. When t is the number of weeks of production, output is a direct function F(t) such that F (t) = - 10,000 + 50t^4 . How many weeks of work will it require them to reach an output of 190,000 ?

Options:

A: 10 weeks
B: 14 weeks
C: 13 weeks
D: 9 weeks
E: 7 weeks
F: 6 weeks
G: 12 weeks
H: 8 weeks
I: 5 weeks
J: 11 weeks

Okay, so I've got this problem here about William Accra's company output. The output function is given as F(t) = -10,000 + 50t⁴, and I need to find how many weeks of work are needed to reach an output of 190,000. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll write down what's given. The function F(t) increases with the fourth power of t, which means it's a rapidly increasing function. So, each additional week adds a large amount to the output, especially as t gets bigger.

The target output is 190,000. So I need to solve for t in the equation:

-10,000 + 50t⁴ = 190,000

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for t⁴. I'll add 10,000 to both sides:

50t⁴ = 190,000 + 10,000
50t⁴ = 200,000

Now, I'll divide both sides by 50 to get t⁴ by itself:

t⁴ = 200,000 / 50
t⁴ = 4,000

Okay, so I need to find t such that t to the fourth power equals 4,000. That seems a bit tricky, but maybe I can take the fourth root of both sides. Alternatively, I can take the natural logarithm or use logarithms to solve for t.

Let me try taking the fourth root. The fourth root of 4,000. Alternatively, I can express 4,000 in terms of powers of 10. Wait, 4,000 is 4 * 10^3. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can approximate it. Let me think: 10^4 is 10,000, which is more than 4,000. So 10^4 is 10,000. So 4,000 is a quarter of that. So 10^4 = 10,000 → 10^3 = 1,000 → 4,000 is 4 * 10^3.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fourth root numerically. Let me try to compute it step by step.

I know that 10^4 is 10,000 as I said. Let me compute 8^4: 8^2 is 64, 8^3 is 512, 8^4 is 4096. Oh wait, 8^4 is 4096, which is just a bit more than 4,000. So let's see:

t^4 = 4,000. So if t is 8, then 8^4 is 4096, which is 4096. Our target is 4,000. So 4096 is higher than 4000. So t is a bit less than 8.

Let me try 7: 7^4 is 7*7=49, 49*7=343, 343*7=2401. So 7^4=2401. That's way lower than 4000. So t is between 7 and 8.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check my calculations. 7^4 is 7*7=49, 49*7=343, 343*7=2401. Yep, right. So 7^4=2401, which is less than 4000.

So 8^4 is 4096, which is 4096. That's 96 more than 4000. So t is 8 minus (4096-4000)/(4096-2401) → but that's a linear approximation, but maybe it's not necessary here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute t as the fourth root of 4000. Let me write that as t = (4000)^(1/4). Let's compute that.

I know that 10^4 is 10,000. So 4000 is 4*(1000), which is 4*10^3. So, 4000 = 4 * 10^3 = 4 * (10^3) = 4 * (10^3). So the fourth root would be (4)^(1/4) * (10^3)^(1/4).

Wait, 10^3 is 1000, and the fourth root of 1000 is 1000^(1/4) = (10^3)^(1/4) = 10^(3/4) ≈ 10^0.75. Let me compute that: 10^0.75 is the same as the square root of 10^1.5, which is sqrt(31.6227766) ≈ 5.6234. Alternatively, 10^(3/4) is approximately 5.6234.

So 4^(1/4) is 4^0.25. 4 is 2^2, so 4^(1/4) is (2^2)^(1/4) = 2^(2*(1/4)) )= 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142.

So putting it together, t ≈ (1.4142) * (5.6234) ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 1.4142 * 5.6234. Let's approximate 1.4142 * 5.6234.

Well, 1 * 5.6234 =5.6234.

0.4142 *5.6234 ≈ approx 0.4 *5.6234=2.2494, plus 0.0142*5.6234≈0.0800.

So 2.2494 +0.08= 2.3294.

So total t ≈5.6234 +2.3294=7.9528.

So t is approximately 7.95 weeks. Since the original function is in whole weeks, we need to round this to the nearest whole number. But let's see, the options are whole numbers, so perhaps we can check which option is closest.

Looking at the options: H is 8 weeks, which is the calculated approximate. So the answer is H:8 weeks.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So in this case, the correct answer is H, which is 'H: 8 weeks'. So the last letter is 'H', which is 'H' as in the letter, but wait no, the options are letters like A, B, etc., so the correct letter is 'H', which is the letter 8. So the last character of the response (which is the letter) is 'H', which is correct.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation because 8^4 is 4096, which is 96 more than 4000. So t is 7.95 weeks, which is approximately 8 weeks. So the correct answer is 8 weeks, which is option H.

To determine when the company reaches an output of 190,000, we solve F(t) = -10,000 + 50t⁴ = 190,000.

1. Rearrange the equation:
   50t⁴ = 200,000 → t⁴ = 4,000.

2. Calculate t as the fourth root of 4,000, which is approximately 7.95 weeks.

3. Since the options are whole numbers, rounding 7.95 gives t = 8 weeks.

Answer: H: 8 weeks.
