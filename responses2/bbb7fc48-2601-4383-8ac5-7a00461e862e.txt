Question:

As reported on CNN, in a May 1999 national poll 43% of high school students expressed fear about going to school. Which of the following best describes what is meant by the poll having a margin of error of 5%?

Options:

A: There is a 0.05 probability that the 43% result is in error.
B: The pollsters are 95% confident that the true proportion is between 38% and 48%.
C: Five percent of the students refused to participate in the poll.
D: The poll's results could be 5% higher or lower due to random chance.
E: Five percent of the students surveyed did not understand the question.
F: There is a 5% chance that the results of the poll are completely inaccurate.
G: Only 5% of the students surveyed gave valid responses.
H: It is likely that the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school is between 38% and 48%.
I: The poll's results are 5% away from the true proportion.
J: Between 38% and 48% of those surveyed expressed fear about going to school.

Okay, so I have this question about polling margins of error, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down.

The question says that in a May 1999 poll, 43% of high school students expressed fear about going to school. The poll had a margin of error of 5%. The question is about what this margin of error means.

The options are A through J. I think I need to understand what a margin of error signifies in statistical terms. From what I remember, the margin of error gives a range within which the true value is likely to fall, based on the sample results. It's a measure of the uncertainty associated with the estimate.

So, if the margin of error is 5%, that means that the true proportion could be 5% higher or lower than the reported 43%. So the range would be from 38% to 48%. That sounds like option H: It is likely that the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school is between 38% and 48%.

Wait, let me think through each option to make sure. 

Option A: 0.05 probability that the 43% result is in error. Hmm, that's not quite right. The margin of error is about the confidence interval, not directly the probability of being wrong. I think the 5% is related to the confidence level, not the error probability. So A might not be correct.

Option B: 95% confident that the true proportion is between 38-48. Oh, that rings a bell. Because usually, a 95% confidence level is associated with a margin of error calculated as 5% when using a certain formula (like when the sample size is large enough and the population proportion is around 50%). So B seems correct.

Option C: Five percent of students refused to participate. That doesn't make sense because the poll's margin of error refers to the error in the results, not the non-response rate. So C is probably not right.

Option D: Due to random chance, results could be 5% higher or lower. That's another way of saying the margin of error. So D is part of the meaning. But the main statement is that the results are likely within that range, so D is a correct statement but maybe more of a part of H.

Option E: 5% of students didn't understand the question. That's about non-response bias, not the margin of error. So E is unrelated.

Option F: 5% chance the results are inaccurate. That's similar to option A. But again, the margin of error is about the confidence interval, not the probability of incorrect outcome. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Only 5% responded. That's similar to C. The margin of error doesn't refer to the participation rate, just the sampling variability. G is not correct.

Option I: Results are 5% off the true proportion. That's correct in a probabilistic sense, but the question is about what the margin of error means. So I is a true statement, but the question is asking which best describes the poll having a 5% margin of error.

Option J: Between 38-48% expressed fear. That's the confidence interval, but it's the range we expect. It doesn't say it's the case, just that it's likely. So J says it's the outcome, but the margin of error gives a confidence interval.

Wait, the question is what the poll's margin of error means. So the correct answer is about the likely range, which is H.

So I think the correct answer is H.

The correct answer is H: It is likely that the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school is between 38% and 48%.
