Question:

 Which of the following is a method of torture that Dershowitz believes is appropriate in those cases where torture is permissible?

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about methods of torture and who Dershowitz considers appropriate. Let me try to figure this out.

The question is asking which method Dershowitz believes is appropriate in cases where torture is permissible. The options are A to J, each with a different method. I remember that Dershowitz is a philosopher known for his work on torture, especially in the context of Wittgenstein's later work. His main argument is about the limits of human rights, especially regarding the use of pain and pain relief.

Looking at the options, option A is prolonged sleep deprivation. I think that's more about psychological comfort rather than torture itself. People can sleep longer, but I'm not sure if that's tied to torture methods. Option B is forced ingestion of harmful substances, which sounds like it could be considered torture because it's about taking something harmful when you don't want to. But I'm not certain if Dershowitz would endorse that as a method when it's permissible.

Option C is submerging the victim in water to feel drowning. That's definitely not a method I associate with torture. It's more of a medical or psychological exercise. Option D is sensory deprivation, where you block certain sounds or tastes. That's a way to limit pain and distress, which I think Dershowitz would consider a permissible method if it's used correctly.

Option E is physical beatings. That's definitely not a recommended method, and I don't think it's tied to either. Option F is none of the above, which would be if none of these methods are appropriate. But I'm pretty sure some of them are tied to his arguments.

Option G is psychological manipulation, like therapy techniques. That's not the same as torture. Option H is using a needle under fingernails, which I think is a medical technique, maybe something like IV or IV lines. Not related to torture. Option I is exposure to extreme cold or heat. That sounds more like a medical procedure, perhaps for shock therapy, but I don't recall it being tied to torture methods.

Option J is electrocution at nonlethal levels. Electrodes can cause shock without causing harm, so this might be used in certain medical procedures. But again, not a torture method. 

So, thinking back to Dershowitz's work, he argues that torture is inherently harmful and uses pain and pain relief as a defense. He would likely not support any methods that cause pain or distress, even if they are permissible in certain cases. So, if the question is about methods permissible when torture is allowed, I think Dershowitz would believe that methods that don't cause pain are okay. 

Looking at the options, I think D (sensory deprivation) might be one of the methods he considers appropriate. Because sensory deprivation is a way to limit pain without causing actual harm, it aligns with his perspective. On the other hand, methods that involve pain, like A, B, or J, would not be appropriate if they cause distress because that's what he argues should be minimized.

Wait, but looking back, option D is sensory deprivation, which I think is about limiting the sensory input, not necessarily the actual physical pain. So if the question is about methods that are permissible when torture is allowed, and if that method doesn't involve pain, then Dershowitz would support it.

So, the correct answer should be D because it's a method that doesn't cause actual pain, which fits Dershowitz's views on when to use such methods.

The correct answer is **D: sensory deprivation**. Dershowitz, known for his arguments against torture, would support methods that limit pain and distress without causing actual harm. Sensory deprivation, which prevents the body from perceiving specific stimuli, aligns with his belief in permissible methods when pain relief is considered a defense. 

Answer: D
