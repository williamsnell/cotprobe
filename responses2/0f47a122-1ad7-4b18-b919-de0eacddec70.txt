Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to express the reciprocal of 0. recurring 7 as a common fraction. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that a recurring decimal can be converted into a fraction by using some algebraic methods. 

First, let me write down the number. It's 0.7777..., right? So, the question is asking for the reciprocal of that, which means 1 divided by 0.7777... I need to figure out what 1 divided by this repeating decimal equals as a fraction.

Let me denote x as 0.7777... So, x = 0.7777... Now, I want to convert this into a fraction. Since it's a repeating decimal with one digit repeating, I can use the method where I multiply both sides by 10 to shift the decimal point. 

Multiplying both sides by 10 gives me 10x = 7.7777... Now, if I subtract the original equation (x = 0.7777...) from this new equation, the repeating parts will cancel out. So, subtracting x from 10x:

10x - x = 7.7777... - 0.7777...
9x = 7

So, solving for x, I get x = 7/9. Therefore, 0.7777... equals 7/9. 

But the question asks for the reciprocal of this. The reciprocal of a number is 1 divided by that number. So, the reciprocal of 7/9 is 9/7. 

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If 7/9 is 0.777..., then 1/(7/9) should be 9/7. That makes sense because dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. 

Looking at the options, option A is 9/7, which matches what I found. So the correct answer should be A.
