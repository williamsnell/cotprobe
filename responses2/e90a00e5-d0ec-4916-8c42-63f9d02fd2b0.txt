Okay, so I've got this question about the onset of labor and which hormones trigger it. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking about the very beginning of labor. I remember that labor starts when the embryo begins to feel the need to give birth. And I think this is related to hormones. There are two main hormones involved here: oxytocin and estrogen. 

Wait, what's the difference between them? Oxytocin is released from the pituitary gland, right? And Estrogen is from the ovaries. I think oxytocin is the first to kick in during labor. But wait, was that the very beginning or just a trigger?

Oh, right! The very beginning of labor is the onset. So maybe it's when the embryo starts to feel the need to labor. From what I recall, the very first thing that happens is the release of Oxytocin from the pituitary gland. This hormone acts as a signal for the brain to recognize the need to labor.

So the options are looking for the mother's pituitary gland. Let's check the options. Option H says the mothers' pituitary gland secretes hormones (specifically oxytocin) that trigger the onset. That seems right.

Other options: Option A is the thyroid, which I think is involved more in growth and metabolism. B is hypothalamus, which is more involved in regulating体温 and other internal processes. C is the adrenal gland, which I associate with stress and maybe other hormonal responses but not the onset of labor. D is the mother's adrenal, which is more about stress and maybe other issues. E is prostaglandins, which are involved in pain and inflammation but not the main trigger for labor. F is pituitary, probably, but not the main one. G and I are about the fetus's parts, which don't apply here as the mother is the trigger. J is ovaries, which are involved but not the very beginning.

So the correct answer should be H, the mothers' pituitary gland.

The onset of labor is triggered by the release of hormones from the mother's pituitary gland, specifically oxytocin (option H). Oxytocin acts as the first signal for labor.

Answer: H
