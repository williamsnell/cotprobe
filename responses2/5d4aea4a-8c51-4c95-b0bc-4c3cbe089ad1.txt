Question:

You’ve made a scientific theory that there is an attractive force between all objects. When will your theory be proven to be correct?

Options:

A: When the theory can predict future observations.
B: As soon as you propose the theory.
C: When your theory becomes a law.
D: You can never prove your theory to be correct only “yet to be proven wrong”.
E: When the scientific community accepts it as a fact.
F: The first time you drop a bowling ball and it falls to the ground proving your hypothesis.
G: After you’ve repeated your experiment many times.
H: When you and many others have tested the hypothesis.
I: After a single successful experiment that supports your hypothesis.
J: When the theory is published in a scientific journal.

Okay, so I have this question about scientific theories and how they get proven. Hmm, I remember that scientific theories are built on evidence and can be tested. Let me think about the options again.

The question is asking when the theory will be proven correct. The options are A through J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Option A says when the theory can predict future observations. I think that's related to falsifiability. The theory should be able to make predictions that can be tested. But does that mean it's proven? Not exactly; it just means it's testable. I remember that sometimes theories aren't proven yet, but their predictions can be checked. So maybe this is a step towards proving, but not the absolute proof.

Option B: As soon as you propose the theory. No, that's too soon. Proposing the theory is more about starting the process, but not the actual proving step. It's more like the initial stage, before any experiments or evidence.

Option C: When your theory becomes a law. Oh, that's a key point. I think laws are statements that are accepted as true based on evidence and are used to explain observations. Theories become laws after they've been extensively tested and supported, so this might be when they are proven, but I'm not sure if it's the exact point. Because I think it's the process of becoming a law, which is a step in the process of being proven. So C might be a possible correct answer.

Option D: Yet to be proven wrong. That sounds more like the final step. I think once a theory is accepted as a law, it's considered proven and can't be disproven. But I'm getting a bit confused. The question is about when it's proven, so maybe it's when it becomes a law, and then it's a proven theory. So C says when it becomes a law, which would be when it's proven. So D says you can never prove it yet, which might be incorrect.

Option E: Scientific community accepts it as a fact. That sounds too vague. The community might accept it, but it's not a proven fact. It's more of a belief. So E might not be the right answer.

Option F: First successful experiment. That seems too early. The theory needs more evidence from multiple experiments to be accepted.

Option G: After repeated experiments. Repeating experiments is part of testing, but not yet proving. It's more about accumulating evidence.

Option H: When many others have tested the hypothesis. That sounds like it's been tested extensively. Maybe when it's widely accepted as a law. But I'm not sure if that's when it's proven.

Option J: Published in a journal. Well, being published is a step towards acceptance, but it's not the proof itself. It's more about being published as a result of the theory being accepted.

So, trying to think again. The theory can be proven if it can predict future observations, which is A. Or perhaps when it becomes a law. But I think the correct answer is when the theory becomes a law, because that's when it's accepted as a scientific theory, meaning it's proven. So option C is correct.

Wait, but I also remember that theories can be proven in the sense that once they've been repeatedly tested and supported by evidence, they become laws, which are considered established facts. So, becomes a law when proven. So option C is correct because when the theory becomes a law, it's proven. So D says you can never prove it yet, which is not true. So the correct answer is C.

The correct answer is C: When your theory becomes a law. This is because a law is a statement accepted as true and used to explain observations, and a theory becomes a law after extensive testing and support. Once a theory is a law, it is considered proven and widely accepted in the scientific community.

Answer: C
