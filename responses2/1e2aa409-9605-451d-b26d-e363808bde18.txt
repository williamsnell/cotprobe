Question:

Let X be the random variable denoting the result of the single toss of a fair coin. If the toss is heads, X = 1. If the toss results in tails, X = 0. What is the probability distribution of X?

Options:

A: f(0) = (0) and f(1) = (1)
B: f(0) = (1/2) and f(1) = (1/2)
C: f(0) = (1) and f(1) = (0)
D: f(0) = (1/6) and f(1) = (5/6)
E: f(0) = (2/5) and f(1) = (3/5)
F: f(0) = (3/7) and f(1) = (4/7)
G: f(0) = (1/5) and f(1) = (4/5)
H: f(0) = (1/4) and f(1) = (3/4)
I: f(0) = (1/3) and f(1) = (2/3)
J: f(0) = (3/8) and f(1) = (5/8)

Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: Let X be the result of a single toss of a fair coin. If the toss is heads, X equals 1. If it's tails, X equals 0. Then it's asking about the probability distribution of X, and there are several options given.

Hmm, probability distribution. That's like a function that tells the probabilities of each possible outcome. So for a coin toss, X can only be 0 or 1, right? Because heads gives X=1, tails gives X=0.

Since it's a fair coin, I know that the probability of heads is 1/2 and tails is also 1/2. So the probability distribution should show that P(X=0) is 1/2 and P(X=1) is 1/2. Let me look at the options.

Option B is f(0) = 1/2 and f(1) = 1/2. That seems to match what I just thought. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.

The other options don't seem right. For example, option A has f(0)=0 and f(1)=1, but that's not a valid distribution because the probabilities should add up to 1. Similarly, option C has f(0)=1, which would mean X is always 0, but that's not the case because there's a chance it's 1. Option D and onwards involve fractions like 1/6, 5/6, 1/4, etc., but those don't make sense for a fair coin. A fair coin has equal probabilities for heads and tails, so 1/2 each.

Wait a second, another thought: sometimes, probability distributions can have probabilities that add up to 1, but they can have more than two outcomes. Oh, but in this case, X can only be 0 or 1, so the distribution is binary. So any distribution where P(0)=1/2 and P(1)=1/2 should be correct.

So looking back, the correct answer should be option B. Are there any other options that look similar? Let me check each option again.

Option D: f(0)=1/6, f(1)=5/6. But that adds to 1, which is correct, but it's not a fair coin, so that's wrong.

Option B is the only one that assigns equal probabilities to both 0 and 1, which is what a fair coin would do.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident that option B is the right answer.

The probability distribution of X must assign equal probabilities to 0 and 1 since the coin is fair. This corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
