Okay, so I need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 252 and 96. Hmm, I remember that the GCF is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. Let me think about the best way to approach this.

I think the most straightforward method is to list all the factors of each number and then find the largest one they have in common. But that might take a while if the numbers are large. Maybe there's a faster way, like using prime factorization.

Let me try prime factorization first. So, I'll break down each number into its prime factors.

Starting with 252. I know 252 is even, so I'll divide by 2 first. 252 ÷ 2 is 126. That's still even, so divide by 2 again to get 63. Now, 63 is divisible by 3 because 6+3=9, which is divisible by 3. So 63 ÷ 3 is 21. 21 ÷ 3 is 7, and 7 is a prime number. So the prime factors of 252 are 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 7, or 2² × 3² × 7.

Now for 96. Let's divide by 2 first. 96 ÷ 2 is 48, ÷2 again is 24, again is 12, again is 6, again is 3. So that's six 2s. Wait, 2⁶ × 3. Because 3 ÷3 is 1, so the prime factors are 2⁶ × 3¹.

Now to find the GCF, I take the lowest power of the common primes in both factorizations. The common primes here are 2 and 3.

For 2: In 252, it's 2², and in 96 it's 2⁶. The lower is 2².

For 3: In 252, it's 3², and in 96 it's 3¹. The lower is 3¹.

So the GCF would be 2² × 3¹ = 4 × 3 = 12.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the exponents. Oh, wait, 252 has 2² and 3², and 96 has 2⁶ and 3¹. So for each prime, we take the minimum exponent. So 2² and 3¹. Multiply them: 4×3 is 12. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is another method. Let me try that to confirm.

The Euclidean algorithm steps are: divide the larger number by the smaller, take the remainder, and repeat.

So, 252 divided by 96. 96×2=192, 252-192=60. So the remainder is 60.

Now, take 96 and divide by 60. 60×1=60, 96-60=36. Remainder 36.

Next, divide 60 by 36. 36×1=36, 60-36=24. Remainder 24.

Divide 36 by 24. 24×1=24, 36-24=12. Remainder 12.

Now, divide 24 by 12. 12×2=24, remainder 0. So the last non-zero remainder is 12, which is the GCF.

Yep, that matches what I found earlier. So the GCF of 252 and 96 is 12. Looking at the options, D is 12. So the answer should be D.

The greatest common factor (GCF) of 252 and 96 is 12.

Answer: D: 12
