Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the vapor pressure of a solution, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that we have 20.0 grams of sucrose, C12H22O11, dissolved in 40.0 grams of water, and we need to find the vapor pressure of this solution at 34°C. Oh right, the vapor pressure of water is given as 40.00 mmHg at that temperature. So the options are from A to J, with various mmHg values.

Hmm, I remember that vapor pressure of solutions depends on the mole fraction of the solute. So this is a Raoult's Law problem. The formula is P = X_solvent * P0_solvent, where X_solvent is the mole fraction of the solvent (water in this case) and P0 is the pure vapor pressure of water.

First, I need to find the moles of water and sucrose. To do that, I'll calculate the molar masses. Water is H2O. Molar mass is (2*1 + 16) = 18.015 g/mol. So moles of water = 40.0g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 2.22 mol.

Sucrose is C12H22O11. Molar mass is (12*12) + (22*1) + (11*16) = 144 + 22 + 176 = 342 g/mol. Moles of sucrose = 20.0g / 342 g/mol ≈ 0.05848 mol.

Wait, wait. So the solvent is water, and the solute is sucrose. So the total moles in the solution are 2.22 + 0.05848 ≈ 2.2785 mol.

The mole fraction of water (X_water) is moles of water / total moles. So X_water = 2.22 / 2.2785 ≈ 0.964.

Then, using Raoult's Law, P = X_water * P0_water. P0 is 40 mmHg. So P = 0.964 * 40 ≈ 38.56 mmHg.

Looking at the options, option A is 38.5 mm, which is close. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake with the moles. Wait, 20 grams of sucrose: 20 / 342 is approximately 0.05848 mol. Oh, wait, 342 * 0.05848 is about 20. Oh, right, that's correct.

Mole fraction of water is 2.22 / 2.2785. Let me compute that more accurately. 2.22 / 2.2785. Let me see: 2.2785 is approximately 2.278, and 2.22 / 2.278 = let's divide 222 by 227.8.

222 ÷227.8 = approximately 0.964. So X_water is ~0.964.

So P = 0.964 * 40 = 38.56 mmHg. So the answer would be around 38.56, which is option A (38.5). But wait, the options don't have an option exactly at 38.5. Let me check the options again.

Oh, the options are:

A: 38.5

The others are B:35, C:37.0, D:40, E:36.5, etc.

So the correct answer should be option A, which is 38.5 mm. But wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake with the mole calculation? Let me recalculate the moles.

Wait, 40.0 grams of water: 40.0 / 18.015 = 40 / 18.015 ≈ 2.22 mol (since 18 * 2.22 is 40. So that's correct.

Sucrose: 20 / 342. Let me compute that more accurately. 342 * 0.05848 = 20.0 grams. So moles are 20/342 = 0.05848 mol. So that's correct.

So X_water = 2.22 / (2.22 + 0.05848) = 2.22 / 2.27848 ≈ 0.964.

So, 0.964 *40 = 38.56 mmHg. So the answer is approximately 38.56, which rounds to 38.5 mm, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, the available option A is 38.5. But the calculated value is 38.56, which is approximately 38.6 mm. But the options don't have that. Oh, because the options for A is 38.5, which is 38.5 mm. So that's the closest.

Wait, but let me double-check: the options are given in the problem. Let me read the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 38.5

B:35.0

C:37.0

D:40.0

E:36.5

F:41.0

G:37.5

H:39.0

I:36.5

J:42.0

So, A is 38.5, which is correct. So the answer is A.

To calculate the vapor pressure of the solution, we use Raoult's Law: 

\[
P = X_{\text{solvent}} \cdot P_0^{\text{solvent}}
\]

where \( X_{\text{solvent}} \) is the mole fraction of the solvent (water), and \( P_0^{\text{solvent}} \) is the vapor pressure of pure water at 34°C, which is given as 40.00 mmHg.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of water and sucrose
- **Molar mass of water (H₂O):** \( 18.015 \, \text{g/mol} \)
  \[
  \text{Moles of water} = \frac{40.0 \, \text{g}}{18.015 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 2.22 \, \text{mol}
  \]

- **Molar mass of sucrose (C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁):** \( 342.3 \, \text{g/mol} \)
  \[
  \text{Moles of sucrose} = \frac{20.0 \, \text{g}}{342.3 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.05848 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total moles in the solution
\[
\text{Total moles} = \text{Moles of water} + \text{Moles of sucrose} = 2.22 + 0.05848 \approx 2.2785 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the mole fraction of water
\[
X_{\text{water}} = \frac{\text{Moles of water}}{\text{Total moles}} = \frac{2.22}{2.2785} \approx 0.964
\]

### Step 4: Apply Raoult's Law to calculate the vapor pressure of the solution
\[
P = X_{\text{water}} \cdot P_0^{\text{water}} = 0.964 \cdot 40.00 \, \text{mmHg} \approx 38.56 \, \text{mmHg}
\]

### Step 5: Match the closest option
The calculated vapor pressure is approximately 38.56 mmHg, which rounds to 38.5 mmHg. The closest option is **A: 38.5 mm**.
