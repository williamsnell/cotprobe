Question:

A state highway runs through the center of a city's business district. As the highway passes through this business district, there is a stretch where the highway is too narrow to satisfS' the safety standards for state roadways. Along this narrow stretch and on opposite sides of the street are located two businesses. Situated on the east side of the street is a bar and grill; directly across the street on the west side is a lounge. In order to comply with state highway regulations, the state highway department, acting pursuant to state statute, ordered the city to prohibit parking on one side of the highway within the business district. The city council convened a special meeting to determine whether parking should be prohibited on the east or west side of the street. During the meeting, the council was unable to resolve the issue. Finally, the city council president decided the only fair way to resolve the matter was to flip a coin. After the coin flip, the city prohibited parking at all times on the west side of the highway. On account of this decision, parking in front of the lounge was permanently prohibited. This caused the lounge to suffer a substantial decline in business because of the unavailability of on-street parking. As a consequence, the owner of the lounge brought suit for declarative relief against the city alleging that the parking ban on his side of the street was unconstitutional. In all likelihood, will the plaintiff be successful in this cause of action?

Options:

A: No, because as a governmental entity, the city enjoys immunity from such suits under the Eleventh Amendment.
B: No, because the city was acting in accordance with state highway safety regulations.
C: Yes, because the action of the city violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
D: No, because the city's action was reasonable.
E: Yes, because the city council failed to consider the economic impact of their decision on the lounge.
F: No, because the city council president's decision to flip a coin was arbitrary and capricious.
G: No, because the state highway department's order supersedes any claim by the lounge owner.
H: Yes, because the prohibition of parking constitutes a taking of property without just compensation.
I: Yes, because the city council's decision unfairly targeted businesses on the west side of the street.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the plaintiff, the lounge owner, will be successful in his suit against the city for declarative relief. The main question is whether the city's decision to prohibit parking on one side of the highway was unconstitutional. Let me go through the facts step by step.

The highway is in a business district, and it's too narrow, violating state standards. So the city ordered the city to prohibit parking on one side and allowed it on the other. Now, the city council didn't agree, so they coin flipped, and the city prohibits parking on the west side. This makes the lounge owner permanently prohibited from parking there.

The plaintiff is suing for declarative relief, which is an argument that the city's action was not the best possible outcome, and that the owner's rights were violated. So the question is whether the city's decision was fair.

Looking at the options, let's see each one.

Option A: The city has immunity from suits under the Eleventh Amendment. Wait, the Eleventh Amendment is about states' rights. The city is a state entity, so it does have immunity from state suits. However, this is a civil case, not a state action. So, the Eleventh doesn't apply here. Plus, it's about the constitutionality of the action, not just rights.

Option B: The city acted in accordance with state highway regulations. State highway regulations would include enforcing such rules, but the plaintiff's argument is about whether the regulation was violated, not compliance. So this might not be the issue.

Option C: The action violated the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. The Fourteenth Amendment doesn't apply to state actions directly; states have a duty to protect the rights of every citizen, but that's a broad standard. The Fourteenth doesn't specifically address state regulation of public spaces. So I don't think this is the issue.

Option D: The city's action was reasonable. The coin flip was a common-sense decision, not arbitrary. So the city's action was reasonable, which would support the plaintiff's argument against the Fourteenth Amendment.

Option E: The council failed to consider the economic impact. The council's decision was arbitrary, but the plaintiff is arguing about fairness, not the council's action. So E might not be the issue here.

Option F: The coin flip was arbitrary. The plaintiff is asking whether the coin flip was fair, but the decision was just, so F is incorrect.

Option G: The department's order supersedes other claims. That's not relevant here because the suit is about the city's decision, not the department.

Option H: The prohibition is a taking without just compensation. Taking without just compensation usually refers to the state taking away someone's property without just compensation and causing harm to the property owner. But in this case, the owner is the one being sued for no parking. The city took parking spot(s) and restricted access. So the owner's claim would be that the city didn't just take but also caused harm, which is a valid argument. But I'm not sure if it's a taking under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause.

Option I: The council's decision was unfair. This is about whether the city council's decision was arbitrary. But the suit is about the city enforcing the rule, not the council. So I don't think I should focus on the council's decision here.

Wait, the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause applies when a state violates a fundamental right. The city is taking the right of way on one side, which could be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. But I'm not sure if that applies here because the state is taking away a right of way, which is a public right. Alternatively, it could be a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's right to privacy, but parking is more about access than privacy.

Alternatively, maybe the suit is about the lack of just compensation. If the owner wasn't compensated, the city might argue that it's unfair. But the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't directly address whether the city took without just compensationâ€”more about whether a state is just in taking away someone's rights.

So, putting it together: the city's decision violates the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause because it's taking away a right that should be protected. Therefore, the plaintiff's argument would be that the city's action was unconstitutional, so the answer should be H: Yes, because the city's action violated the equal protection clause.

The city's decision to prohibit parking on one side of the highway was found to violate the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. By taking away a right of way, the city is taking away a right that should be protected, which supports the plaintiff's argument.
