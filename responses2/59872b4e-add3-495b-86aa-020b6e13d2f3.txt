Okay, I need to calculate the future value of an ordinary annuity. Let me remember what an ordinary annuity is. So, it's a series of equal payments made at the end of each period, right? In this case, the payments are $800 per year for 4 years, and the rate is 5%. 

I think the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity is FV = PMT × [(1 + r)^n - 1]/r. Wait, no, wait. Or is it [PMT × (1 + r)^n - 1]/r? Or maybe it's [PMT × ((1 + r)^n - 1)/r]. Yeah, that sounds right. 

So the variables here: PMT is $800, r is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal, n is 4 years. Let me plug these into the formula. 

First, calculate (1 + 0.05)^4. Let's see, 1.05^4. Let me compute that step by step. 1.05 squared is 1.1025. Squaring that again, 1.1025 squared is about 1.21550625. So (1.05)^4 is approximately 1.21550625. 

Subtract 1 from that: 1.21550625 - 1 = 0.21550625. Then divide by 0.05: 0.21550625 / 0.05. Let's see, 0.05 into 0.21550625. 0.05 * 4.310125 = 0.21550625. So that's 4.310125.

Multiply that by the payment of $800: 4.310125 × 800. Let's calculate that. 4 × 800 is 3200, and 0.310125 × 800 is 248.1. So total is 3200 + 248.1 = 3448.1. 

Looking at the options, option F is 3448.1. So the answer should be F.

The future value of an ordinary annuity is calculated using the formula \( FV = PMT \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \). Plugging in the values:

- \( PMT = 800 \)
- \( r = 0.05 \)
- \( n = 4 \)

First, compute \( (1 + 0.05)^4 = 1.21550625 \). Subtract 1 to get 0.21550625. Divide by 0.05 to get 4.310125. Multiply by 800 to get 3448.1.

The answer is option F.

**Answer:** F: 3448.1
