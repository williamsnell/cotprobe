Okay, so I have this question about an MA(1) model. Hmm, I remember that MA stands for Moving Average. The model is written as Y(t) = ε(t) + θ*ε(t-1), where θ is the moving average coefficient. Oh wait, in this case, the coefficient is 0.4, so θ=0.4.

The question is about the autocovariance at lag 1. Autocovariance, right? Autocovariance function for an MA model. Let me think. Autocovariance function measures the covariance between Y(t) and Y(t+k) for lag k.

Wait, for an MA(1) model, the autocovariance at lag 1, γ(1), is calculated as θ*(variance of ε) maybe? Or wait, no. Wait, the general formula for autocovariance in an MA(q) model is γ(k) = θ^k * σ², where σ² is the variance of the error term ε. But wait, when k=1, it's θ * σ².

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I've seen the formula written as γ(k) = θ^k σ², but maybe for an MA(q) model, the autocovariance is zero for lags greater than q. So for MA(1), γ(1) would be θ σ², right?

Wait, but the question says the series has zero mean. So the model is Y(t) = ε(t) + 0.4 ε(t-1), and the mean is zero. So the variance of Y(t) would be Var(ε(t)) + (0.4)^2 Var(ε(t-1)) since ε(t) and ε(t-1) are uncorrelated. So Var(Y(t)) = σ² + (0.4)^2 σ² = σ² (1 + 0.16) = 1.16 σ².

But wait, the question is about the autocovariance at lag 1. Autocovariance is defined as Cov(Y(t), Y(t+1)). Let me compute that.

Y(t) = ε(t) + 0.4 ε(t-1)
Y(t+1) = ε(t+1) + 0.4 ε(t)

So Cov(Y(t), Y(t+1)) = Cov(ε(t) + 0.4 ε(t-1), ε(t+1) + 0.4 ε(t)).

Expanding that, the cross terms are Cov(ε(t), ε(t+1)) which is zero because they are uncorrelated, and Cov(ε(t), ε(t)), which is Var(ε(t)) = σ². Similarly, Cov(0.4 ε(t-1), ε(t+1)) is zero, and 0.4 Cov(ε(t-1), ε(t)) which is zero. So the only term left is Cov(0.4 ε(t-1), 0.4 ε(t)) = 0.16 Var(ε(t)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me redo that. The product would be ε(t) * ε(t+1) which has covariance zero, and ε(t) * 0.4 ε(t) which is 0.4 Var(ε(t)). Similarly, 0.4 ε(t-1) * ε(t+1)=0 (since uncorrelated), and 0.4 ε(t-1) * 0.4 ε(t) = 0.16 Var(ε(t)).

So total covariance is 0.4 σ² + 0.16 σ² = σ² (0.4 + 0.16) = 0.56 σ². But wait, is that right? Or am I mixing up something?

Wait another approach: the MA(1) has the autocovariance function γ(1) = θ * σ², and γ(0) = Var(Y) = σ² (1 + θ²). So for θ=0.4, γ(1)=0.4 σ². But the question isn't asking about γ(1), it's asking for γ(1) in terms of some value. Wait, but the options don't have 0.4 σ². The options are numbers, like 0.2, 0.4, etc. Hmm, wait, maybe the question is assuming the variance of the error is 1, so γ(1) would be 0.4. Because if σ²=1, then the autocovariance would be 0.4 *1=0.4.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The general formula is γ(k) = θ^k σ². For k=1, γ(1)=θ σ². But in the question, are we told about the variance? No, the question doesn't specify. So if the error variance is σ², then the autocovariance is 0.4 σ². But the options don't have that. So perhaps in the question, it's implied that the variance is 1, or maybe that the variance is some specific value.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the properties. In an MA(1) model, the autocovariance function (ACF) at lag 1 is θ times the variance. So if the variance is 1, then γ(1)=0.4. But the question doesn't mention the variance. So perhaps the answer is 0.4 times the variance. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are numbers. So maybe the question assumes the variance is 1. Or perhaps the question is in a scenario where the variance is 1, so the autocovariance at lag 1 is 0.4.

Wait, but looking back, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the general case. For an MA(q) model, the autocovariance at lag k is θ^k * σ² for k ≤ q, and zero otherwise. So for MA(1), the autocovariance at lag 1 is θ σ².

But if the question is about the value, without any other information, perhaps the question is assuming that the variance is 1. Because otherwise, the answer would depend on σ², but the options are numbers.

So if the variance is 1, then the autocovariance at lag 1 is 0.4. So option F is 0.4. So that would be the answer, I think.

Wait, but the question says zero mean and MA(1). So the variance is fixed, but in the absence of σ², perhaps the answer is 0.4, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming unit variance, which would make the autocovariance 0.4.

Wait, no. Wait, the question isn't giving us any info about the variance, so perhaps the answer is 0.4 times the variance. But the options don't have a variable. So maybe the correct answer is 0.4 because the variance is 1, as in, the standard error is 1.

Wait, but the options don't have 0.4σ². So I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think again: For an MA(1) model, the autocovariance at lag 1 is θ σ². So for θ=0.4, that's 0.4 σ². But the options are numbers, not expressions. So perhaps the variance is 1, making it 0.4. Or perhaps the question is referring to the standard error (which is sqrt(ACF)). Or perhaps it's a trick question.

Wait, another approach: the MA(1) model's autocovariance function is γ(1) = θ σ². So if the disturbance variance is 1, then γ(1)=0.4. So the correct answer would be option F: 0.4.

But wait, the question doesn't specify the variance of the error. Hmm, perhaps the question is assuming the disturbance variance is 1, or perhaps it's a standard case where the variance is normalized to 1.

Wait, but the question is about the value of the autocovariance. So if the variance is 1, the answer is 0.4. But without knowing σ², we can't know the exact value. So maybe the answer is 0.4 times σ², but since the options are numerical, perhaps we're supposed to assume σ²=1.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me recall. For an MA(1) process, the autocovariance function (ACF) at lag 1 is γ(1) = θ * σ². So if θ is 0.4, then γ(1) = 0.4 σ². So if the disturbance variance is 1 (σ²=1), then it's 0.4. So the answer is F: 0.4.

So the correct answer would be option F.
</think>

The question involves an MA(1) model with a moving average coefficient of 0.4 and zero mean. The autocovariance at lag 1 is calculated as θ * σ², where θ is 0.4. Assuming the disturbance variance (σ²) is 1, the autocovariance at lag 1 is 0.4. 

Answer:
F: 0.4
