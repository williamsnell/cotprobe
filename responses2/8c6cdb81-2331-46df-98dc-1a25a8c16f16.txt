Question:

In June a computer retailer ordered 100 computers, with various configurations, from a manufacturer, to be delivered by August 1. The order form expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer. In July the manufacturer sent a confirmation agreeing to the terms and specifications, but stating that "shipment will be made in two deliveries, half by August 10 and the other half by August 20." When shipment was not made by August 1, the retailer withdrew the order. Will the manufacturer prevail in enforcing a contract?

Options:

A: No, because the order was withdrawn before the machines were shipped.
B: Yes, because the manufacturer sent a confirmation agreeing to the terms and specifications.
C: Yes, because there was only a minimal difference between the offer and acceptance.
D: No, because the manufacturer failed to deliver on the agreed date.
E: Yes, because the order was not officially canceled by the retailer.
F: No, because the offer expressly limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.
G: No, because the manufacturer changed the terms without the retailer's explicit consent.
H: Yes, because the retailer assented to the terms by remaining silent until after August 1.
I: Yes, because the manufacturer had the right to change the delivery dates.
J: No, because the retailer has the right to withdraw the order at any time before shipment.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about contracts and whether the manufacturer will enforce their terms even if the retailer withdraws the order. Hmm, I remember something about express contracts and express agreements. Let me think.

So, the scenario: the retailer ordered 100 computers from a manufacturer. The order was supposed to be delivered by August 1. The order form only accepted the terms offered. In July, the manufacturer sent a confirmation saying they agreed to the terms but planned to ship half in August 10 and the other half in August 20. But when shipment wasn't made by August 1, the retailer withdrew the order. The question is whether the manufacturer will enforce the contract.

Wait, the key here is whether the contract was enforceable despite the retailer withdrawing the order. I think express contracts are often enforceable even if they're canceled later. Because express contracts generally have clear terms and limits on withdrawal. So, the retailer didn't bind the manufacturer unless they had a right to refuse, which they likely did.

The manufacturer sent a confirmation, but that doesn't automatically mean the contract is valid. The main point is about express contracts. Wait, the order form explicitly limited acceptance to the terms, but that doesn't mean the retailer can't withdraw. Maybe the express terms are still enforceable.

Looking at the options:

A: No, because order was withdrawn before shipment. I don't think so. The retailer can withdraw, but the contract would still be in place.

B: Yes, because manufacturer sent confirmation. Maybe, but I'm not sure. The confirmation is part of the offer, but express terms might take precedence.

C: Yes, because minimal difference. I don't think minimal difference is a factor here. Express contracts are usually enforceable regardless.

D: No because manufacturer didn't deliver. But the retailer had the right to withdraw, so that's not the case.

E: Yes because retailer assented by being silent until August 1. Wait, the retailer's silence until August 1 might indicate assent. But in some cases, just being silent doesn't mean the other side is assented. Unless the retailer had the right to withdraw, which they did.

F: No because offer limited to terms. But express contracts are enforceable even if you can withdraw, unless you had a right to refuse. So F's reasoning might not hold.

G: No because manufacturer changed terms without retailer's consent. Express contracts usually require prior agreement unless the terms are clear and the retailer can refuse.

H: Yes because retailer assented by remaining silent. If the retailer wasn't making any statement until after August 1, that could be considered assent. But I'm not sure if that's a sufficient reason. Maybe the retailer's silence isn't enough.

I: Yes because manufacturer had the right to change delivery dates. Express terms are often non-negotiable, so the manufacturer's terms would take over.

J: No because retailer has the right to withdraw. But wait, the retailer's right to withdraw might mean the contract is void. But in reality, express contracts are enforceable even if the customer can withdraw.

So, looking at the options, I think I and H are both suggesting the manufacturer can enforce their terms. The retailer's withdrawal gives the manufacturer the right to enforce, right? Because the retailer didn't bind them. But wait, wait. Some contracts require the customer to be entirely silent, but maybe that's more about express vs. implied. If the retailer wasn't making any statements until August, that might be enough to say they assented. But I'm not 100% sure.

Wait, another angle: express contracts are enforceable even if the customer cancels. So, the retailer's withdrawal doesn't negate the contract. So the manufacturer can enforce it.

Looking at the options, option I says yes because the manufacturer had the right to change delivery dates. That's about express terms, I think.

Wait, but the correct reasoning is that the retailer's withdrawal doesn't negate the contract, so the manufacturer can enforce. But the options don't have an option saying that. Wait, looking at the options again.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me see:

A: No, because order was withdrawn before shipment. No, because the retailer can withdraw.

B: Yes because confirmation sent. Maybe, but perhaps the confirmation is part of the offer, but express terms are more important.

C: Yes because minimal difference. No, that's not relevant.

D: No because manufacturer didn't deliver. No, retailer could withdraw.

E: Yes because retailer assented. So this would say the retailer was assenting, which might not be the case if the retailer had to withdraw.

F: No because offer limited to terms. Express contracts are enforceable, so F isn't correct.

G: No because manufacturer changed terms without retailer's consent. No, express terms are enforceable.

H: Yes because retailer assented by remaining silent. I'm not sure about this.

I: Yes because manufacturer had the right to change delivery dates. I think this is correct because express contracts are subject to the terms, so the manufacturer's terms would take over.

J: No because retailer can withdraw. So this would say the retailer is right to withdraw, which would make the contract void.

Wait, J's reasoning is that the retailer can withdraw, so the contract was void. But in some cases, express contracts are enforceable even if the customer can withdraw, unless there's a right to refuse. So if the retailer had a right to refuse, it'd be void. But in this case, the retailer withdrew, which would make the contract void. But the question is if the manufacturer can enforce the contract.

Wait, no. The retailer's right to withdraw means the contract was void, but the manufacturer can still enforce the terms of the offer. Because the retailer's right doesn't negate the contract. So the manufacturer can enforce the terms as per the offer.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says yes, because the retailer can withdraw.

Wait, looking at the options, the correct one is I: Yes because the manufacturer had the right to change delivery dates. Or H: Yes because the retailer assented. Or J: No, because retailer can withdraw.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the retailer's order is canceled, does that make the contract void? Or can the manufacturer still enforce the terms?

I think the retailer's right to withdraw makes the contract void, but the manufacturer can still enforce the terms. Because the manufacturer has the right to offer the terms. So the retailer's ability to withdraw doesn't affect the enforceability of the contract.

So the correct answer is I: Yes, because the manufacturer had the right to change delivery dates.

Wait, but what about option H? H says "Yes, because the retailer assented to the terms by remaining silent." So, if the retailer was not making any statement until August 1, that's enough to be considered assented. But I'm not sure if that's a valid reason. Some courts require the retailer to be completely silent or assented before the contract is invalid.

Wait, but in some cases, the retailer's silence until after August 1 would be a defense against the right to withdraw. But I'm not certain if that's enough.

Alternatively, let's think about express contracts. They are enforceable even if the customer can cancel. So the manufacturer's terms would be binding, and the retailer's order is void. But the manufacturer can enforce the contract's terms.

So, if the manufacturer has the right to change the terms, then yes, they can enforce the terms of the offer.

Looking at the options, option I is "Yes, because the manufacturer had the right to change delivery dates."

Alternatively, option H says the retailer assented by remaining silent. But I don't know if that's a sufficient reason.

Wait, the retailer's right to withdraw would make the contract void, but the manufacturer can still enforce the terms because the terms are part of the contract. So the correct answer would be that the manufacturer can enforce the contract.

Looking at the options, options I and H are possible. But I think the correct reasoning is that the manufacturer had the right to change the terms, so they can enforce the contract as per the offer.

So the correct answer would be option I: Yes, because the manufacturer had the right to change delivery dates.

The question revolves around whether the manufacturer can enforce a contract despite the retailer withdrawing the order. The key points are that express contracts are often enforceable even if the customer cancels, and the manufacturer's ability to change terms takes precedence.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The retailer's withdrawal does not negate the contract; it merely means the retailer is not bound by it.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The confirmation sent by the manufacturer is part of the offer, not the contract terms.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Express contracts are typically enforceable even if the customer cancels.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The retailer's right to withdraw does not absolve the manufacturer of their obligation to enforce the contract.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. While the retailer's silence until August 1 might suggest assent, it's not a sufficient reason for assent.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Express contracts are enforceable regardless of the terms.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Express contracts generally require prior agreement unless the terms are clear.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The retailer's silence does not necessarily mean assent; it only indicates a lack of statements.
- **Option I**: Correct. The manufacturer's ability to change delivery dates makes their terms enforceable.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The retailer's right to withdraw makes the contract void, but the manufacturer can still enforce the terms.

The correct answer is **I: Yes, because the manufacturer had the right to change delivery dates**.
