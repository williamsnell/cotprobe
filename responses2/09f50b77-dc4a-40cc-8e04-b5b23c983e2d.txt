Okay, so I've got this problem here about Martha Michael and her monthly telephone bill. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step.

Alright, the problem says Martha spends $360 on her monthly telephone bills, and that's 6 and 1/4 percent of her yearly earnings. I need to find her yearly earnings. Hmm, percentages can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I should probably convert the percentage into a decimal to make the math easier. So, 6 and 1/4 % is the same as 6.25%. I remember that to convert a fraction to a decimal, I divide the numerator by the denominator. So, 1/4 is 0.25, right? So 6.25% is 0.0625 in decimal form because you move the decimal two places to the left.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let's think again. 6 and 1/4 is 6.25. So, to convert that percentage to a decimal, I divide by 100. So, 6.25 divided by 100 is 0.0625. Yeah, that's correct. So, 6.25% is 0.0625 as a decimal.

Now, the problem states that $360 is 6.25% of her yearly earnings. Let me represent her yearly earnings as E. So, the equation would be:

360 = E * (6.25/100)

Which is the same as 360 = E * 0.0625

I need to solve for E. So, I can rearrange the equation to find E by dividing both sides by 0.0625.

E = 360 / 0.0625

Hmm, doing that division. Let's see, 360 divided by 0.0625. Alternatively, I can think of it as 360 divided by (1/16) because 0.0625 is 1/16. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, 360 * 16.

Wait, 360 * 16. Let me calculate that. 360 * 10 is 3600, 360*6 is 2160. So 3600 + 2160 is 5760. So, E is 5760.

Looking at the options, option E is $5,760. So that's the answer. Let me just double-check.

Wait, another way to see: 6.25% is like 6 and a quarter percent. So, 1% is 360 divided by 0.0625, which is 5760. So yeah, that makes sense. So, Martha earns $5,760 a year.

To find Martha's yearly earnings, we start by noting that her monthly telephone bill of $360 represents 6.25% of her total annual earnings. Let E represent her yearly earnings. The equation is:

\[
360 = E \times 0.0625
\]

Solving for E, we divide both sides by 0.0625:

\[
E = \frac{360}{0.0625} = 5760
\]

Thus, her yearly earnings are $5,760, which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
