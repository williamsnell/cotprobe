Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about cyber security concepts. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question asks which concept doesn't form part of the technical discourse on cyber security. The options are A to I, and the choices are various technical terms.

First, I'll list the options again to make sure I don't miss any:

A: Social networking
B: Business networks
C: Computer experts
D: Computer networks
E: Internet of Things
F: Cloud storage
G: Mobile technology
H: Firewall protection
I: Anti-virus industry

I need to determine which of these isn't part of the technical aspects of cyber security. Let me think about each one.

Starting with A: Social networking. Social networks like Facebook or LinkedIn involve people, but how does that relate to cyber security? Cybersecurity deals with protecting systems and networks from threats, not human behavior. So maybe social networking isn't part of technical cyber security.

B: Business networks. That's about the infrastructure connecting businesses, which is definitely a part of cybersecurity because businesses are targets for cyber threats.

C: Computer experts. This sounds like a group of people who are skilled in IT, which is part of the technical side of cybersecurity.

D: Computer networks. This is about systems and devices connected together, which is a fundamental part of cybersecurity. So D is definitely part of the technical discourse.

E: Internet of Things. IoT deals with connecting devices, like smart home appliances or wearables. Cybersecurity for IoT involves protecting these devices from threats, so E is part of the technical discourse.

F: Cloud storage. Clouds provide shared storage for data, and securing data in the cloud is a key part of cybersecurity measures. So F is part of it.

G: Mobile technology. Mobile devices like smartphones and tablets are part of the IT infrastructure used for communication and transactions. Cybersecurity would involve protecting these from threats, so G is part of it.

H: Firewall protection. This is a specific security measure used to block unauthorized access to a network. Definitely part of cybersecurity.

I: Anti-virus industry. This protects software from viruses and malware, which is a crucial part of cybersecurity.

So looking back, the options are about what's part of technical cyber security. The only one I'm unsure about is A: Social networking. Social networking is more about human relationships and not directly about protecting systems and networks from threats. So the answer should be A.

The correct answer is A: Social networking does not form part of the technical discourse on cyber security.

Answer: A
