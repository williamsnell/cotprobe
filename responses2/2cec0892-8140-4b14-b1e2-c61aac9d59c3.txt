Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me read it again. The question is: If I roll 5 standard 6-sided dice and multiply the numbers on each face, what's the probability that the result is a composite number? The options are labeled from A to J, each with a fraction.

Hmm, I need to find the probability that the product of the five dice rolls is a composite number. Let's think about what a composite number is. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. So, numbers like 4, 6, 8, etc.

First, I should figure out the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Each die has 6 faces, so that's 6^5. Let me compute that: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. So the total number of possible outcomes is 7776. That's the denominator of the probability.

Now, the probability we're looking for is the number of favorable outcomes (where the product is composite) divided by the total outcomes. So, I need to subtract the number of outcomes where the product is not composite (i.e., it's either 1 or a prime number) from the total.

Wait, but actually, what's the product? Each die can roll a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The product is the multiplication of all five numbers rolled. So, the product will be 1 if all dice show 1. Otherwise, it's at least 2.

So, the only cases where the product isn't composite are when the product is 1 (all ones) or when the product is a prime number.

Let's break that down.

Case 1: All dice show 1. That's one specific outcome. So the product is 1, which is neither prime nor composite. So, this is one case.

Case 2: The product is a prime number. For the product to be a prime, exactly one of the dice must show a prime number, and the others must show 1. Because if more than one die shows a number greater than 1, their product would be composite.

Wait, wait. Let me think. For the product to be prime, since primes are only divisible by 1 and themselves, the product must be a prime. So, the product can only be prime if exactly one die shows a prime number (2, 3, or 5), and the other four dice show 1. Because if even one die shows 1, then the product would include 1, which would make the product just the product of the remaining primes. So, for example, if one die is 2 and others are 1, the product is 2, which is prime.

So, the favorable cases for the product being prime are when exactly one die is a prime (2,3,5) and the other four are 1.

So, the number of such favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose which die shows the prime, multiplied by the number of primes available (3) and the number of ways the others show 1 (which is only one way for each die).

So, number of favorable outcomes for prime product: 5 dice positions (C(5,1)) multiplied by 3 primes. So 5*3=15.

So, the total number of unfavorable outcomes (product is 1 or prime) is 1 (all ones) + 15 (one prime, others ones) = 16.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes (composite) is total outcomes minus unfavorable: 7776 - 16 = 7760.

Wait, but wait: 7776 - 16 = 7760. So the probability is 7760 / 7776. Let me simplify that fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 7760 / 16 = 485, 7776 /16=486. So 485/486.

Looking at the options, option J is 485/486. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Because I thought that the product being 1 is only when all dice are 1, which is one outcome. And the product being a prime is 15 outcomes. So 1+15=16, which is the number of unfavorable. So favorable is 7776 -16 = 7760.

So the probability is 7760/7776. Let's see if this reduces to one of the options.

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 7760 ÷16 = 485, 7776 ÷16=486. So 485/486 is the probability, which is option J.

Wait, but let me think again. The options include J as 485/486. But I thought the favorable outcomes were 7776-16=7760, which is 7760/7776=485/486. So yes, J is the answer.

Wait, but wait another moment. What about the case where the product is 1? It's 1, which is not composite. So, the only cases where the product is not composite are 1 (all ones) and primes (15 outcomes). So yes, 16.

But wait, let me think again about the prime product. When exactly one die is 2,3, or5, and others are 1. So for each prime (2,3,5), the number of ways is 5 (positions to choose) ×1 (primes) ×1^4 (others). So 3×5=15.

Yes, that's correct. So the total unfavorable is 16. So the favorable is 7776-16=7760.

So the probability is 7760/7776 = 7760 ÷ 16 = 485, and 7776 ÷16=486. So 485/486. That's option J.

Wait, but looking at the options, J is 485/486. So the correct answer should be option J. But wait, the options are labeled A to J, and the user didn't list the options correctly. Wait, looking back at the question, the options are:

A: 8/7776

B:243/486

C:32/7776

D:400/7776

E:1/486

F:4/7776

G:16/7776

H:100/7776

I:2/7776

J:485/7776

Wait, no, the options are written as:

A: \frac{8}{7776}

B: \frac{243}{486}

C: \frac{32}{7776}

D: \frac{400}{7776}

E: \frac{1}{486}

F: \frac{4}{7776}

G: \frac{16}{7776}

H: \frac{100}{7776}

I: \frac{2}{7776}

J: \frac{485}{7776}

Wait, so option J is 485/7776. But wait, in my calculation, the favorable is 7760/7776, which is 485/486. But none of the options have 485/486 except J, which is 485/7776. Wait, no, J is 485/7776, which is not the same as 485/486.

Wait, wait, that suggests I made a mistake in the calculation. Because 485/7776 is approximately 0.063, but 485/486 is about 0.998.

But wait, 7760/7776 is the same as 7760 ÷7776. Let me compute this fraction.

7760 ÷7776. Let's see, 7760 is 7776-16, so 7760/7776 = (7776-16)/7776 = 1 - 16/7776 = 1 - 1/486 = (486-1)/486 = 485/486. Ah, wait, yes! Because 7776 is 486×16. So 7760 is 7776-16. So 7760/7776 = (7776-16)/7776 = 1 - 16/7776 = 1 - 1/486 = (486-1)/486 = 485/486.

So the probability is 485/486, which is option J.

Wait, but how come my initial calculation thought the favorable was 7760, which is 485/486. So yes, option J is correct.
