Okay, so I've got this question about Hernando de Soto and his expedition. I'm trying to remember what the question is asking. It says that when he crossed a portion of the North American continent, his expedition encountered descendants of which people. The options are a bunch of different cultures, like Mayan, Kwakiutl, etc.

First, I think about Hernando de Soto. He was a Spanish explorer, right? He crossed the Americas, specifically the Great Andes. I remember hearing that he was part of the Spanish conquistadors, the Aztecs, Incas, etc. But wait, he was a Spanish explorer, so perhaps he encountered descendants of the Spanish or his own family.

Wait, no, the question is about the people of the original inhabitants of the lands he was crossing. So, when he set out, he was on a mission to map the Americas. The indigenous peoples he was approaching were the Puebloans. So, the descendants would be the Puebloan people, their direct line.

Looking at the options, option G is "Ancestral Puebloan." So that seems like the correct answer. The other options don't correspond to the indigenous groups he encountered. For example, the Mayans were in Central America, the Incas in South America, the Aztecs in North America, etc. The Puebloans were in the Andes, which is where he crossed.

So, the correct answer should be G: Ancestral Puebloan.
