Okay, so I've got this problem about a glass vase's profit. Let me read it again. The vase sells for $25.00. The net profit is 7%, and the operating expenses are 39%. I need to find the gross profit. Hmm.

Wait, let's break it down. Gross profit is the money left after subtracting the cost of goods sold from the selling price. But wait, the problem gives the net profit and the operating expenses. I think I need to figure out the cost price first.

Net profit is 7% of the selling price. So, the net profit is 7% of $25. Let me calculate that. 7% of 25 is 0.07 * 25 = $1.75. So the net profit is $1.75.

Now, the operating expenses are 39% of the selling price. Let me compute that. 39% of $25 is 0.39 * 25 = $9.75. So operating expenses are $9.75.

Wait, but how do I get to gross profit? Oh wait, gross profit is calculated before subtracting operating expenses and other costs, right? Or wait, maybe I'm confusing gross profit with net profit.

Wait, net profit is usually calculated after all expenses, including operating, marketing, etc. But the problem says the net profit is 7%, and operating expenses are 39%. Hmm. Maybe the net profit is the profit after all expenses, but I need to find the gross profit, which is before those expenses.

Alternatively, perhaps the net profit is the profit after considering the cost of goods sold and operating expenses. Wait, but that might complicate things.

Let me think again. The gross profit is the selling price minus the cost of goods sold. But I don't have the cost of goods sold. Alternatively, perhaps the net profit is the profit after subtracting all other expenses, including operating. So net profit is (Gross Profit - Operating Expenses) = 7% of 25. So, let me set up the equation.

Net Profit = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses

So $1.75 = Gross Profit - $9.75

Adding $9.75 to both sides: Gross Profit = $1.75 + $9.75 = $11.50.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is $11.50. So that's one of the choices. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because I might have made a mistake.

Wait another way: the total cost (cost of goods sold plus operating expenses) plus the net profit should equal the selling price. So,

Selling Price = Cost + Operating Expenses + Net Profit

So, $25 = Cost + $9.75 + $1.75

Adding 9.75 and 1.75 gives 11.50. So,

Cost = $25 - $11.50 = $13.50

Then, the gross profit is Selling Price - Cost of Goods Sold. Wait, but I don't have the cost of goods sold. Alternatively, the gross profit is selling price minus cost, which is $25 - $13.50 = $11.50. So that aligns with my previous calculation. So the gross profit is $11.50, which is option E.

But wait, let me double-check. Let's see: if the cost is $13.50, then operating expenses are 39%, which is $9.75 (since 13.5 * 0.39 = 5.265? Wait, no, 13.5 * 0.39 = let me calculate. 13 * 0.39 is 5.07, plus 0.5 * 0.39 is 0.195 → total 5.265. So operating expenses are $5.265, which doesn't match the 39% of 25, which is $9.75. Wait, this is a problem.

Wait, perhaps I got the gross profit wrong. Let me think again. Let me define the cost of goods sold as COGS.

So, the net profit is 7% of $25, which is $1.75. The operating expenses are 39% of selling price, which is $9.75.

Now, the net profit is calculated as: (Selling Price - COGS - Operating Expenses) = $1.75.

So: 25 - COGS - 9.75 = 1.75 → 15.25 - COGS = 1.75 → COGS = 15.25 -1.75= 13.5.

So, COGS is $13.50.

Gross profit is Selling Price - COGS → 25 -13.5 = 11.5. So, that's $11.50, which is option E.

But wait, when I calculated operating expenses as 39% of the selling price, that's $9.75. So, let me check: COGS is $13.5, operating expenses $9.75, net profit is 1.75. So 13.5 +9.75 +1.75 = 25.00. That adds up. So yes, the calculations make sense.

So the correct answer is E: $11.50.

The gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from the selling price. First, the net profit is 7% of $25, which is $1.75, and the operating expenses are 39% of $25, which is $9.75. Using the equation:

Net Profit = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses

We find Gross Profit as:

Gross Profit = Net Profit + Operating Expenses = $1.75 + $9.75 = $11.50.

Thus, the gross profit is $11.50, which corresponds to option E.
