Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Hooke's law. Let me try to think through it step by step.

Hooke's law says that the force needed to extend or compress a spring is proportional to the distance it is stretched or compressed. The formula is F = -kx, right? Where F is the force, k is the spring constant (a measure of stiffness), and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.

In this question, we're dealing with a tree branch. So when you hang a weight from it, the branch bends. The question is about how the bend changes when the weight is doubled.

So, let's break it down. The first part is when you hang by the branch with a certain weight, say W. The branch bends by a certain amount, x. According to Hooke's law, F = kx. So when you apply a force F, the branch's displacement is x = F/k.

Now, when you double the weight. Let's say the original weight is W, so when you hang off the branch, the force is W. The bending is x. So, W = kx. So, x = W/k.

If the weight is doubled, the new weight is 2W. Using Hooke's law, the new force F' is 2W. So, F' = 2W = k * x'. So x' = (2W)/k = 2*(W/k) = 2x. 

So the bend increases by a factor of 2 when the weight is doubled. So the bend becomes twice as much. Looking at the options, B says twice the bend. That's the first thought.

Wait, what about the options? Let me check all the options:

Option B: twice the bend. Yes, that's what I thought.

Other options: A is three times. No, that's not correct. C says four times if the branch doesn't break, but that's not relevant here because Hooke's law is a linear relationship. So C is more about the relationship for small displacements, but it's not the case here.

E: a bend that is unpredictable. No, Hooke's law is linear, so the bend is proportional to the weight, so it should be predictable.

D: no bend at all. No, because you're hanging, so there's a force.

F: half the bend. No, because doubling the weight increases the bend, not halves it.

G: proportional to the square root of the weight. Wait, no, Hooke's law is linear, so it's proportional to the weight, not the square root. So G is incorrect.

H: 4 times the bend. No, that's not correct. It's only twice.

I: bend decreases with increased weight. That doesn't fit. Hooke's law says the bend increases with weight, so I is wrong.

J: same bend if the branch doesn't break. No, because if the branch breaks, Hooke's law doesn't apply anymore. But the question doesn't mention the branch breaking, but it's about the bend when weight is doubled. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be B.

According to Hooke's law, the bending of a tree branch is directly proportional to the weight hung by it. When the weight is doubled, the force is also doubled, leading to twice the displacement (bend). Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: B
