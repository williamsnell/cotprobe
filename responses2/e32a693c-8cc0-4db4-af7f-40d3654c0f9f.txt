Okay, so I've got this question about a study design. Let me read it again. The question says that a group of people are exposed to an environmental toxin, but they're not treated over time with standard measures. They observed it without treatment. Hmm, what kind of study is that?

I remember that study designs can be categorized into different types based on the methods used. Let's think about each option. 

Option A is longitudinal. That sounds like it's tracking subjects over time, so maybe looking at changes over periods.

Option B is prospective cohort. Prospective means subjects are recruited at the start and followed over time. They're exposed and observed, so this fits because the group is exposed and not treated. 

Option C is randomized controlled trial. That's a type of experiment where subjects are randomly assigned to different groups, usually to test a treatment's effect. But in this case, the subjects were exposed to the toxin, not necessarily compared to a control. So maybe it's not an experiment.

Option D is clinical trial. That's similar to randomized controlled trial but more general. It's about testing treatments, so maybe also not the right fit here.

Option E is retrospective cohort. That's where subjects are followed backward in time, looking at past data. But the question says they're not treated observed over time, which implies it's a forward-looking study, not looking back.

Option F is cross-sectional. That's a snapshot, looking at the population at a certain time. It's not observing over time, so probably not.

Option G is observational. Observational studies are where subjects are exposed without random assignment, so the exposure is just observed. That fits the description because the group is exposed but not treated, so it's observed over time.

Option H is case-control. That's a type of observational study used in case-control designs to look at cause and effect, especially in medical contexts. Not sure if it's the right fit here.

Option I is experimental. That's similar to randomized controlled trials, where treatments are tested, but again, the scenario doesn't involve a treatment but an exposure.

Option J is double-blind. That's about keeping subjects and researchers unaware of treatment assignments, but the question doesn't mention that, so probably not.

Putting it all together: the study is observing a group exposed to a toxin over time, not comparing to a control. So it's an observational study. That's option G.

The correct answer is G: Observational.
