Okay, so I've got this question about "double taxation" and how it affects corporations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. 

I remember that double taxation happens when the same profit made by one company is taxed twice, once for each company. Like, if a corporation makes a profit and then a different company uses that profit, both would be taxed on the same income. That's bad because it increases the overall tax burden. 

The question is asking why this happens and what corporations try to avoid it. The options are A to E. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Through reinvesting profits into tax-exempt securities. Wait, I don't think that's right. Reinvesting in tax-exempt entities like ERAs or endowments doesn't really cause double taxation. It just allows the company to generate more cash. Plus, the profits themselves are taxed as part of the corporate income tax.

Option B: Through merging with or acquiring other companies to consolidate tax liabilities. Oh, that makes sense. If two companies merge, their profits are both generated by the same parent company. So the profits are taxed twice, once for each parent. That definitely creates double taxation. Also, some jurisdictions might try to minimize this by consolidating, but it's a common way.

Option C: Through use of undistributed corporate profits and disguise profits in high salary, pension, and expense accounts. I'm not too familiar with this approach. I think some companies might distribute profits to employees as stock options or other forms, but I don't recall this being a primary strategy against double taxation. It might be more about reducing the amount taxable, but it's probably not the main answer.

Option D: Through issuing stock options to employees instead of cash salaries. Hmm, I'm not sure how this affects double taxation. If an employee receives stock options, the company might have to pay more taxes because the value of the stock they receive is subject to the same corporate tax rates. But I'm not certain if this is a common strategy to avoid double taxation. It might complicate things more than simplifying it.

Option E: Through increased dividend distribution. Dividend distributions are taxed differently than profits. Dividends are taxed at corporate income tax rates, while profits are taxed under capital gains or regular income. So if a company increases its dividends, its profits are taxed once, but dividends are taxed separately. That would reduce double taxation because the same profit isn't taxed again.

Option F: Through high corporate income tax. Well, if the tax rate is high, that's an issue. But it's not a way to avoid double taxation. It's just the rate itself. The problem is about how double taxation arises, not the overall tax burden.

Wait, let me go back. The question is about explaining double taxation and what corporations try to avoid it. So the options that address the issue and the solutions.

Option B seems to address the issue. It's a common strategy because merging can consolidate tax liabilities. But what are corporations trying to avoid? They might seek ways to minimize the double taxation.

Option E talks about increased dividends, but that's more about reducing taxes on dividends than avoiding double taxation. Because using dividends doesn't double the tax; it just lowers it. Double taxation would be when one company taxes profits and another uses them, so the same tax applies again.

So, the correct answer is B: Through merging with or acquiring other companies to consolidate tax liabilities. That's a common approach to avoid double taxation.

The correct answer is **B: Through merging with or acquiring other companies to consolidate tax liabilities**. 

Double taxation occurs when profits made by one company are taxed twice, once for each company. Merging or acquiring other companies helps consolidate tax liabilities by allowing profits to be taxed by a single parent company, thus avoiding double taxation. 

Answer: B
