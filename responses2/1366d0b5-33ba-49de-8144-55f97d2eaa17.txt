Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing ice and water, and I need to find the final temperature. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So the problem says there's 40 grams of ice at 0°C and 100 grams of water at 60°C. The question is, what's the final temperature when they reach equilibrium? Oh right, I remember that when ice and water mix, depending on their masses and temperatures, they might reach a common temperature. 

The given data includes the heat of fusion for water, which is 80 cal/g, and the specific heat capacity, which is 1 cal/g°C. Oh wait, wait. Wait, wait. The specific heat of water is generally around 1 cal/g°C, but I should make sure. Yeah, I think that's correct.

So, when ice and water are mixed, the ice will try to melt if the water's temperature is higher, or the water will cool down. The heat lost by the water should equal the heat gained by the ice. But wait, no—since the ice is at 0°C and the water is hotter, the ice will absorb heat to melt and then possibly reach the same temperature as the original water.

Let me break this down. The heat transfer will happen in two steps for the ice: first, it warms up from 0°C to 0°C (no change, so no heat exchange here) and then it melts into water at 0°C. Then, the melted ice (which is water) will cool down to the final temperature Tf, releasing heat. At the same time, the original water will lose heat as it cools from 60°C to Tf.

So the heat lost by the original water (H_water) is the heat it gives up to cool to Tf. The heat gained by the ice is the heat it takes to melt plus the heat it loses when cooling down. So the equation should be:

Heat gained by ice = Heat lost by water.

Wait, let me write the equations.

Heat required to melt the ice: Q1 = mass_ice * heat_fusion = 40g * 80 cal/g = 3200 cal.

Then, the melted ice (now water) will cool down from 0°C to Tf: Q2 = mass_ice * specific_water * (0 - Tf) = 40g * 1 cal/g°C * (-Tf) = -40 Tf cal.

So the total heat gained by the ice is Q1 + Q2 = 3200 -40 Tf.

Heat lost by the original water is Q_water = mass_water * specific_water * (60 - Tf) = 100g * 1 * (60-Tf) = 100 (60 - Tf) cal.

Setting them equal (heat lost = heat gained):

3200 -40 Tf = 100 (60 - Tf)

Let me solve this equation.

3200 -40 Tf = 6000 -100 Tf

Let's bring like terms together.

3200 -6000 = -100 Tf +40 Tf

-2800 = (-60 Tf)

Divide both sides by -60:

Tf = (-2800) / (-60) = 2800/60. Let's compute that.

2800 divided by 60. Well, 60 * 46 is 2760, which leaves 40. So 46 and 40/60, which is 46 and 2/3. So approximately 46.666... degrees Celsius. 

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one is option A, which is 40°C. But wait, that doesn't match. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait a minute, perhaps I missed something. Oh wait, maybe the ice doesn't completely melt. Because when you mix ice and warm water, sometimes the water might not have enough to melt all the ice. Let me think again.

The initial mass of ice is 40g, and the mass of water is 100g. The heat capacity of water is 1 cal/g°C, so when the ice melts, it needs 40g ×80 =3200 cal. The water will give up heat as it cools. But the amount of heat the water can give depends on how much it cools. 

Wait, another approach: The total heat available from the original water is 100g ×1 cal/g°C × (60 -0) = 6000 cal. The heat needed to melt some ice would be 3200 cal. So, if all the ice melts, that would require 3200 cal, but the water can provide 6000 cal. So 6000 -3200 = 2800 cal left. This remaining heat would make the water cool down.

Wait, but wait. So, the total heat that can be released is 6000 cal. The heat needed to melt the ice is 3200 cal. The remaining is 6000 -3200 = 2800 cal. This remaining heat will cause the water to cool to Tf. So, the equation would be:

Q_remaining = mass_water × specific × (60 - Tf) = 2800 cal.

Wait, that's another way to set it up. So,

100g ×1 cal/g°C × (60 - Tf) = 2800 → 6000 - 100 Tf = 2800 → 100 Tf = 6000 -2800 → 3200 → Tf=3200/100 → 32°C.

Wait, that's different. So earlier I thought Tf was around 46.66, but this approach gives Tf=32°C.

Hmm, which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach when I assumed all the ice melts. If the heat from the water is 6000 cal, and the heat required to melt all the ice is 3200 cal, then the remaining heat is 6000-3200=2800 cal. So, that would be the heat left after melting. So, the water would cool by 2800 cal. Since the specific heat is 1 cal/g°C, and 100g, the temperature change is 2800 cal / (100g ×1) = 28°C. So initial temp is 60, so Tf = 60 -28 =32°C.

But wait, that would mean 40g of ice is melted, because the heat from the remaining 60g of water (since 40g melted, 60g remains) would be 40g ×1 cal/g°C ×28°C, which is 1120 cal. But wait, the remaining heat is 2800 cal, so where's the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I confused the initial setup. Let's go back.

The correct approach is to consider that the ice will absorb heat to melt and then cool down. The heat the water gives away is all used to melt the ice (if possible) and then to cool the resulting water (now melted) down to Tf.

Wait, but the ice has to absorb heat. The water can give up all its heat, but the heat needed to melt the ice is 3200 cal. If the water can give that, then the ice melts, and the remaining water (60g) will cool from 60°C to Tf, releasing heat. The total heat from the water is 6000 cal, but 3200 cal is used to melt the ice. So, 6000 -3200=2800 cal will be used to cool the melted ice (60g) to Tf.

So the equation is:

6000 = 3200 + (60g *1cal/g°C * (60 - Tf)) 

So 6000 -3200 =60*(60 - Tf)

2800 = 60*(60 - Tf)

Divide both sides by 60:

2800/60 =60 - Tf → 2800 ÷60 is about 46.6667.

So, 46.6667 =60 - Tf → Tf =60 -46.6667 → 13.3333°C.

Wait, that can't be right because that would be a lower temperature than before. But earlier I thought Tf would be 32. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting results.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the heat. Let me think again.

Wait, the heat lost by the water is the heat that the ice absorbs. So:

Heat lost by water: 100g *1 cal/g°C * (60 - Tf) = 60*(60 - Tf) cal.

Heat gained by ice: 40g *80 cal/g =3200 cal, plus 40g *1 cal/g°C * (Tf -0) =40 Tf cal.

So, 60*(60 - Tf) =3200 +40 Tf.

Let me compute:

60*60=3600. 60*(60-Tf) =3600 -60 Tf.

So,

3600 -60 Tf =3200 +40 Tf.

Bring like terms:

3600 -3200 = 60 Tf +40 Tf.

400 =100 Tf → Tf=4°C.

Wait, that's 4°C. But that's not matching any of the options. The options are 40,30,20,50.

Hmm, that suggests I have a problem. Because the options don't include 4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the equation correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should set the heat lost by the water equal to the heat gained by the ice.

Heat lost by water: m_water * c_water * (T_initial - T_final) → 100*1*(60-Tf) =100*(60-Tf) cal.

Heat gained by ice: m_ice * heat of fusion + m_ice * c_water * (T_final - 0) → 40*80 +40*1*Tf →3200 +40 Tf.

So,

100*(60 - Tf) =3200 +40 Tf.

Let me compute.

Left side: 6000 -100 Tf.

Right side:3200 +40 Tf.

Bring all terms to left:

6000-100 Tf -3200 -40 Tf =0 → 2800 -140 Tf =0.

So,

2800 =140 Tf → Tf=2800/140 → 20°C.

Ah, that gives 20°C, which is option C. 

Wait, but earlier when I thought of it as all the ice melting, that gave a different result. Let me see why.

Wait, in the first approach, I considered that the heat from the water is 6000 cal, which is enough to melt all 40g of ice, which needs 3200 cal. The remaining 2800 cal is used to cool the melted 60g of water down to Tf.

So the equation would be:

Heat from water = heat needed to melt ice + heat needed to cool melted water.

So,

100*1*(60 - Tf) =3200 +60*1*(60 - Tf).

Wait, no. Wait, the 60g of melted water would cool down from 60 to Tf, so the heat lost is 60*(60 -Tf).

So,

Left side: 100*(60 -Tf) =6000 -100 Tf.

Right side:3200 +60*(60 -Tf) →3200 + 60*60 -60 Tf →3200 +3600 -60 Tf →6800-60 Tf.

Equation:6000 -100 Tf =6800 -60 Tf.

Bring terms together:

6000 -6800 = 100 Tf -60 Tf → -800 =40 Tf → Tf= -20°C.

That's not possible because the ice is initially at 0°C, and the water is at 60. The final temp shouldn't go below 0. So this approach is wrong.

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me correct.

The correct setup is the heat lost by the water equals the heat gained by the ice.

Heat lost by water: 100g *1 (cal/g°C) * (60 - Tf) →60*(60-Tf) cal.

Heat gained by ice: 40g *80 (cal/g) +40g *1 (cal/g°C) * (Tf -0) →3200 +40 Tf.

So,

60*(60 - Tf) =3200 +40 Tf.

Let me compute.

60*(60-Tf) =3600 -60 Tf.

So, 3600 -60 Tf = 3200 +40 Tf.

Subtracting 3200 →400 =100 Tf → Tf=4°C.

But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, looking back, the options are A:40, B:30, C:20, D:50.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the heat from the water is 100g *1 cal/g°C * (60 - T) → Correct.

Heat gained by ice is 40g *80 →3200, plus 40g *1*(T-0) →40T. So the ice's total is 3200 +40T.

So equation:

60*(60-T) =3200 +40T.

Compute,

3600 -60T =3200 +40T.

3600 -3200 = 60T +40T →400=100T → T=4°C.

But the options don't have 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, wait. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says 40g ice at 0°C, 100g water at 60°C.

Wait, perhaps I forgot about the actual heat of fusion. Oh wait, the problem states that the specific heat is 1 cal/g°C. So, I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that all the ice doesn't melt because the water can't provide enough heat.

Wait, the maximum heat that can be extracted from the water is when it's all converted into ice, but that would require a lot of heat.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the maximum possible.

The heat needed to melt all 40g of ice is 40g *80=3200 cal.

The heat available from the 100g water is 100 *1 *60 =6000 cal.

So, since 6000 >3200, all the ice will melt, and the water will cool down.

So, during melting, all 40g of ice is melted, and the resulting 60g of water (from melted ice) will cool down.

So, the heat from the water is 6000 cal.

Heat needed to melt 40g:3200 cal.

Heat left:6000-3200=2800 cal.

So, this remaining heat is used to melt the ice and then to cool the melted 60g of water.

Wait, but that's not the case. Alternatively, the heat from the water is used to melt the ice and then to cool the melted water.

Wait, let me think again. The 40g of ice will absorb 3200 cal, melting. Then, the melted 40g of water (now 40g) will cool from 0 to Tf, releasing heat.

So, the heat given up by the water is 100g *1 cal/g°C * (60 - Tf) =60*(60-Tf) =3600 -60 Tf.

Heat gained by ice:3200 (melting) + 40g *1 cal/g°C * (Tf -0) →3200 +40 Tf.

So:

3600 -60 Tf =3200 +40 Tf.

3600 -3200 = 100 Tf.

400 =100 Tf → Tf=4°C.

Which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the ice doesn't melt completely. Because when the ice is at 0, the water is at 60. Let me check if the water can provide enough heat to melt all 40g of ice, and whether the water can bring the melted ice to 0.

Wait, the heat from the water is 100*1*(60-Tf) =60*(60-Tf).

The heat needed to melt ice is 3200.

The heat left after melting is 60*(60-Tf) -3200.

Ah, but the rest of that heat is used to cool the melted water from 0 to Tf.

So,

60*(60-Tf) -3200 =40*1*(Tf -0) →40 Tf.

So,

60*(60-Tf) -3200 =40 Tf.

Expand:

3600 -60 Tf -3200 =40 Tf.

400 -60 Tf=40 Tf.

400=100 Tf → Tf=4°C.

Same result. So the options don't have 4, so perhaps I made a mistake in another approach.

Wait, perhaps considering that the final temperature is 0°C, because the ice can't melt. Then, the heat lost by the water will be used to cool the ice.

Wait, but let me check.

If the final temperature is 0°C, then the heat lost by the water is 100 *1 *60 =6000 cal.

Heat gained by the ice:40 *80 *0=0, plus 40 *1 *0=0. So, no heat is gained, which can't be.

So, the final temperature must be higher than 0°C. So, the correct approach is to find the Tf>0.

So, given the heat from water is 3600-60 Tf, and heat needed to melt 40g of ice is 3200, then the remaining heat is 40 Tf.

So, 3600-60 Tf =3200 +40 Tf.

3600-3200=100 Tf +60 Tf.

400=160 Tf →Tf=2.5°C. Hmm, but I don't see any option close to that.

Wait, maybe I should think of the ice as not being fully melted, but somehow, the heat from the water is enough to melt some ice and then bring the rest to Tf.

Wait, let me set up the equation correctly.

Heat lost by water: 100*(60-Tf) → this should equal the heat gained by the ice.

Heat gained by ice: 40*80 (to melt) +40*1*(Tf) (to reach Tf).

So,

100*(60-Tf) =3200 +40 Tf.

Let me compute:

6000-100 Tf=3200 +40 Tf.

6000-3200=100 Tf +40 Tf →2800=140 Tf →Tf=2800/140 →20°C.

Ah, that's 20°C. So, the correct answer is 20°C, which is option C.

But wait, earlier approach gave 4°C. So where is the mistake.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.

Wait, let's re-express the equation correctly.

Heat lost by water: 100*(60-Tf) =6000 -100 Tf.

Heat gained by ice: 40*80 (melting) +40*1*(Tf) →3200 +40 Tf.

Set them equal:

6000 -100 Tf =3200 +40 Tf.

Bring terms:

6000-3200=100 Tf +40 Tf →2800=140 Tf →Tf=20°C.

So that's the correct approach. Earlier mistake was in the setup.

Alternatively, when I set up the equation with the ice and water's heat, I should have:

Heat lost by water = Heat gained by ice.

So,

100*(60-Tf) =40*80 +40*1*Tf.

Compute:

6000-100 Tf =3200 +40 Tf.

6000-3200=100 Tf +40 Tf →2800=140 Tf →Tf=20°C.

So, the correct answer is 20°C, which is option C.

But wait, earlier I thought that the heat from the water allows 40g of ice to melt, but that's not correct because the water can't provide enough heat to melt all the ice, it just provides 6000 cal, which is more than the heat required to melt 40g of ice (which is 3200 cal). However, the way the heat is distributed is that part of the heat is used to melt the ice, and the remaining part is used to cool the melted ice to the final temperature.

Wait, but with the correct approach, the final temperature comes to 20°C, which is option C.

But wait, looking at the options, 20 is option C, but the correct answer is 20°C. So, the right answer is C.
</think>

To determine the final equilibrium temperature of the system, we analyze the heat transfer between the ice and the water. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Heat lost by the water**:  
   The water has a mass of 100 g, a specific heat of \(1 \, \text{cal/g°C}\), and an initial temperature of \(60 \, \text{°C}\). The heat lost by the water is calculated as:  
   \[
   Q_{\text{lost}} = m_{\text{water}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot (T_{\text{initial, water}} - T_{\text{final}})
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   Q_{\text{lost}} = 100 \cdot 1 \cdot (60 - T_{\text{final}}) = 6000 - 100T_{\text{final}}
   \]

2. **Heat gained by the ice**:  
   The ice has a mass of \(40 \, \text{g}\), a specific heat of \(1 \, \text{cal/g°C}\), and an initial temperature of \(0 \, \text{°C}\). The heat gained by the ice includes two components:  
   - **Heat to melt the ice**:  
     \[
     Q_{\text{melt}} = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot L_{\text{fusion}}
     \]  
     Substituting the values:  
     \[
     Q_{\text{melt}} = 40 \cdot 80 = 3200 \, \text{cal}
     \]  
   - **Heat to warm the melted ice from \(0 \, \text{°C}\) to \(T_{\text{final}}\)**:  
     \[
     Q_{\text{warm}} = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - 0)
     \]  
     Substituting the values:  
     \[
     Q_{\text{warm}} = 40 \cdot 1 \cdot T_{\text{final}} = 40T_{\text{final}}
     \]  
   The total heat gained by the ice is:  
   \[
   Q_{\text{gained}} = Q_{\text{melt}} + Q_{\text{warm}} = 3200 + 40T_{\text{final}}
   \]

3. **Equating heat lost by the water to heat gained by the ice**:  
   Since the system reaches thermal equilibrium, the heat lost by the water equals the heat gained by the ice:  
   \[
   Q_{\text{lost}} = Q_{\text{gained}}
   \]  
   Substituting the expressions:  
   \[
   6000 - 100T_{\text{final}} = 3200 + 40T_{\text{final}}
   \]  

4. **Solving for \(T_{\text{final}}\)**:  
   Rearranging the equation:  
   \[
   6000 - 3200 = 100T_{\text{final}} + 40T_{\text{final}}
   \]  
   \[
   2800 = 140T_{\text{final}}
   \]  
   \[
   T_{\text{final}} = \frac{2800}{140} = 20 \, \text{°C}
   \]

Thus, the final equilibrium temperature of the system is \(20 \, \text{°C}\), which corresponds to **option C**.

ANSWER: C
