Okay, so I've got this biology problem here about membrane materials. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question has two parts, (a) and (b). Part (a) is about calculating the average density of a membrane material, and part (b) is about centrifuging it. The question gives me some data about the membrane's composition and specific gravity.

Wait, let me start with part (a). The membrane has about 60% protein and 40% phosphoglycerides. But wait, how does that add up? Oh, right, because the percentages are by mass. So the other 20% must be something else, like lipids or other proteins. Wait, but the question says "about 60% protein and 40% phosphoglycerides." So that's 100% of the membrane's components, right? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me see the question again.

Oh, the question says "most membranes... 60% protein and 40% phosphoglycerides." So maybe the rest is other proteins or maybe it's just a simplification. Wait, perhaps I can proceed with that as given.

So, I need to calculate the average density. The formula for density is mass over volume. But since we're dealing with percentages, maybe I can find the average density based on the given densities of protein and phosphoglycerides.

Wait, but wait. The membrane's overall density is a weighted average of the densities of its components. Because each component contributes a certain percentage to the total mass, and their densities are given. So I can calculate the average density as (0.6 * density of protein) + (0.4 * density of phosphoglycerides). But wait, wait, no, because the percentages are by mass, but the total volume of the membrane would be the sum of the volumes of each component. So, no, the correct approach is to take the mass fractions and multiply each by their respective densities, then add them.

Wait, but wait again. The membrane's total mass can be considered as 100% (assuming the percentages are by mass). So the average density would be (60% * density of protein) + (40% * density of phosphoglycerides). Let me plug in the numbers.

Density of protein is 1.2 g/cm³. Phosphoglyceride is 0.92 g/cm³.

So 0.6 * 1.2 = 0.72 g/cm³, and 0.4 * 0.92 = 0.368 g/cm³. Adding these together gives 0.72 + 0.368 = 1.088 g/cm³. So about 1.088 g/cm³. Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options:

Looking at the options, option H is 1.08 g/cm³. So that's close. Wait, but wait another thing—maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check.

60% of 1.2 is (0.6 * 1.2) = 0.72. 40% of 0.92 is (0.4 * 0.92)= 0.368. Sum is 0.72 + 0.368 = 1.088. So that's approximately 1.088, which is about 1.09 g/cm³. But wait, the options don't have 1.088 as an option. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 1.06, float

B: 0.92, float

C: 1.05, float

D: 0.99, float

E: 1.03, sediment

F: 1.09, sediment

G: 1.15, float

H: 1.08, float

I: 1.2, sediment

J: 1.00, sediment

So the closest is option F (1.09) and H (1.08).

Wait, but wait. I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, 0.6 * 1.2 is indeed 0.72. 0.4 * 0.92: 0.4 * 0.9 is 0.36, 0.4 * 0.02 is 0.008; sum is 0.368. So together, 0.72 + 0.368 = 1.088. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 1.09. So option F or H. But let me check the options again.

Wait, the options: option H is 1.08 g/cm³. But 1.088 is approximately 1.09, so why is option H 1.08?

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation. Let me see if I added correctly. 1.2 * 0.6 is 0.72, 0.92 * 0.4 is 0.368. 0.72 plus 0.368 is 1.088. That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the membrane's density is the average of these two components, but perhaps the question is more about something else. Wait, no, the question says "average density of a membrane." So that would be the correct approach. So, 1.088, which is approximately 1.09. But looking at the options, F is 1.09. So the answer would be F? But wait, another thought: are there any other factors, like the presence of other components? Wait, the problem says that the membrane contains about 60% protein and 40% phosphoglycerides. So perhaps those are the only two components, and the others are ignored. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, but the options don't have 1.088, so looking at the options, the closest is F (1.09) and H (1.08). Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the percentages are by weight or volume? No, the problem states they are by mass.

Wait, wait a moment. Let me re-calculate. 0.6 * 1.2 is 0.72. 0.4 * 0.92 is 0.368. Sum is 1.088. So 1.088 is 1.09 g/cm³. So option F is 1.09.

Wait, but the options don't have H as 1.08, but option F is 1.09. So the average density is about 1.09 g/cm³. So moving to part (b).

Part (b): If a sample of membrane material is centrifuged in NaCl solution of 1.05 specific gravity, would it sediment or float? Wait, wait. Specific gravity is the ratio of the density of the material to the density of water. So if the specific gravity is 1.05, the material is denser than water. Because 1.05 >1.00. So when you centrifuge, the material with density >1.00 would cause the pellet to float or sink? Wait, wait. Let me think.

Wait, no. When you centrifuge, the denser components go to the bottom, and the less dense go to the top. So if the membrane material's specific gravity is 1.05, which is higher than water (1.00), the material will float on water. So when centrifuged, if the material is denser, the sedimentation would be on the bottom (the higher density part), and the water would go to the top. So the membrane would float, so the material would float, meaning it would not sediment but float. So the answer would be option E or F, etc.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Options are A to J. Let's see the options:

E: 1.03 g/cm³, sediment

F: 1.09 g/cm³, sediment

G: 1.15, float

H: 1.08, float

I: 1.2, sediment

J: 1.00, sediment

Wait, wait. So if the specific gravity is 1.05, the material is 5% denser than water. So it will float. So when you centrifuge, the denser material will settle at the bottom, while the less dense floats on top. So the membrane material would float. So the centrifugation will cause it to sediment in the layer at the bottom. So the membrane would float, so the answer is F or G? Wait, looking at the options, option F is 1.09, and option G is 1.15. But the material has a specific gravity of 1.05, which is less than 1.15 and more than 1.05.

Wait, wait, wait. The specific gravity is the ratio of the membrane's density to water's density. So if the specific gravity is 1.05, the membrane is 5% denser than water. So when you centrifuge, the membrane would sink to the bottom. So the material would settle, meaning it will sediment. So in centrifugation, the more dense component settles. So the membrane material would sediment. So the answer would be E or F or G, but wait, no. Because the options are about whether it "sediments" or "floats".

Wait, no, the options are about whether it would sediment or float. So if the membrane material has a specific gravity of 1.05, which is greater than 1.00, the material is denser than water. So it would float.

Wait, but the options are about the outcome of centrifuging. So when you centrifuge, the more dense part (denser than water) will go to the bottom. So the membrane would sediment at the bottom, so the material would settle (sediment). So the membrane material would sediment, which would be option E or F, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option E is 1.03 g/cm³, which is less than water's specific gravity (1.00), so it would sediment. Wait, no, wait: wait, 1.03 is less than 1.00? No, wait, 1.03 is higher than 1.00, so it's denser than water. So when you centrifuge, the more dense part goes to the bottom. So the membrane would settle, so the answer is E or F, etc.

Looking at the options:

E: 1.03 g/cm³, sediment

F: 1.09, sediment

So the material is 1.05, which is between 1.03 and 1.09. So it would definitely sediment. So the answer for part (b) is E or F.

Wait, but the options are for the membrane material. Let me go back to the question.

The membrane's density is about 1.088. So the specific gravity is 1.088/1.00 = 1.088.

Wait, no. Specific gravity is the density of the material divided by the density of water. So if the membrane's density is 1.088 g/cm³, the specific gravity is 1.088. So when you centrifuge, the material with specific gravity >1.00 (i.e., 1.088) will settle. So when centrifuged in NaCl solution (which has specific gravity 1.05), the material will sink.

So the answer for part (b) is that it would sediment. So looking at the options, the answer for part (b) is either E or F. But part (a) is about the average density.

Wait, but the question is part (a) and part (b). So the question is a) calculate, b) determine sediment or float.

So for part (a), the average density is 1.088, which is approximately 1.09 g/cm³. Looking at the options, the closest is F (1.09) and H (1.08). So part (a) is 1.09, and part (b) would cause sedimentation.

But wait, looking at the options, I have to choose the answers for both parts. Wait, looking again, the options are A to J. Each option has a density and a sediment/floating status.

Wait, the question says: for part (a), compute the average density. For part (b), determine whether it would sediment or float.

So the correct answer would be for part (a) the average density is approximately 1.09 (option F) or 1.08 (option H). But wait, 1.088 is approximately 1.09, so option F would be the average density.

Wait, but the options for part (a) are in the same question, so it's a multiple-choice question with options A-F each for (a) and (b). So the options are given as:

Each option is about a certain density and a sediment/floating status.

So the question is to choose the correct pair of (density, sediment/flo) from these options.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the options are not separated into (a) and (b). Let me reread the question.

The question says: calculate the average density (part a), and if after centrifuging, it would sediment or float (part b).

So the options are a list of possible answers, each with (density, sediment/flo) for the membrane.

So we have to choose the correct pair.

Wait, the options are A through J, each with (density, sediment/flo) for the membrane.

So for part (a), the average density is approximately 1.09 g/cm³. Looking at the options:

Option F: 1.09, sediment.

Option H: 1.08, float.

So wait, the membrane's density is 1.088, which is closer to 1.09 than 1.08. But in options, F is 1.09. So part (a) would be F.

But wait, the options are for the options in the list. So the question is, which option (A-F) is the correct answer—i.e., the pair of average density and sediment/float status.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous, but the correct approach is to choose the pair where the average density is 1.088, and the material would float because the specific gravity is 1.088 (which is more than 1.00).

Looking at the options:

Option F: 1.09g/cm³, sediment. No, because 1.09 is higher than 1.088, so it would actually float.

So, the membrane's density is 1.088, which is 1.09 approximately. So which option has 1.09 and 'float'?

Looking at the options, no such option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the average density calculation.

Wait, another approach. Let me recheck the calculation.

Protein: 60% at 1.2 g/cm³.

Phosphoglyceride: 40% at 0.92 g/cm³.

Average density: 0.6 * 1.2 + 0.4 * 0.92.

0.6 *1.2 = 0.72.

0.4 *0.92 = 0.368.

Sum: 0.72 + 0.368 = 1.088 g/cm³.

So 1.088 g/cm³.

So the options are looking for something close. The options for average density are: F is 1.09, H is 1.08.

Wait, perhaps the question's options are not accurate, and I should consider that I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another way to calculate: perhaps the membrane is considered as only protein and phosphoglycerides, with no other components. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the average as a weighted average of the two components.

Wait, perhaps the percentages are by volume, but the question says by mass. So that's correct.

So the average is 1.088, which is approximately 1.09.

So option F is 1.09, but it's the specific gravity, yes.

So part (a) is 1.09, part (b) the material has a specific gravity of 1.088, which is greater than 1.00, so it will float.

Looking at the options, which option has 1.09 and 'float'? Let me check.

Looking at the options:

A: 1.06, float

B: 0.92, float

C: 1.05, float

D: 0.99, float

E:1.03, sediment

F:1.09, float

Wait, no, option F is 1.09, but its specific gravity is 1.09, which is more than 1.00. So the material would float.

So the correct answer is F: 1.09 g/cm³, float.

But wait, the membrane's average density is 1.088, which is approximately 1.09. So the correct answer would be F: 1.09, float.

Wait, but the options don't have 1.09 and 'float' as a pair. Wait, looking back, the options list each option as (density, sediment/flo). So the correct option is the one that has the average density, and 'float' or 'sediment' as per the material's specific gravity.

Wait, but the membrane's specific gravity is 1.088. So the material would float, so the correct option is F: 1.09, float.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me read the options again.

Oh wait, looking at the options:

Option F: 1.09 g/cm³, float.

Yes, that's the pair.

Wait, but wait another thing. The membrane's average density is 1.088, which is approximately 1.09. So that's option F. So part (a) is 1.09, part (b) is F's 'float' status. So the correct answer is F.

But wait, the options are for each part? No, each option is a possible answer to part (a) and part (b) together. So for example, option F is 1.09 and 'float', which is exactly what we need.

So the correct answer is F.

Wait, but wait, the question's options are A-F, each being a possible answer for the entire question. So the correct answer is F: 1.09, float.

But earlier, I thought the part (b) would be 'sediment', but that's incorrect. Because 1.088 is more than 1.00, so it's float.

Wait, but why did I think part (b) would be 'sediment'? Because I thought that 1.05 is less than 1.00, so it would appear as 'sediment' when centrifuging. Wait no, wait:

Wait, no, wait: wait, when the material's specific gravity is 1.05, it's denser than water, so it's 5% more than water. So when you centrifuge, the more dense material goes to the bottom, so it will settle. Therefore, it will 'sediment' at the bottom. So in centrifugation, the material would settle, so the answer for part (b) is 'sediment'—so the membrane would settle.

Wait, this is conflicting with my earlier conclusion.

Wait, let me get this straight. The specific gravity of the membrane is 1.088. So it's 8.8% denser than water. When you centrifuge, the material with density higher than water will settle at the bottom, causing the membrane to settle. So the answer for part (b) is 'sediment'.

But wait, wait, let me think again. Wait, the membrane has a specific gravity of 1.088, which is 1.088/1.00 =1.088. So it's 0.088 denser than water. So when centrifuging, the more dense component (the membrane) would settle at the bottom, causing the membrane to settle. So the answer for part (b) is 'sediment'.

So now, putting it all together:

Part (a): The average density is approximately 1.09 g/cm³, so the correct option is F.

Part (b): The membrane would sediment, so the correct option is F.

But the options are a list of possible answers for both parts. So each option is a combination of average density and sediment status.

Wait, the options are A through J, each with their own density and sediment status.

So each option is (density, sediment/flo) for the membrane.

So for the membrane, the correct option would be the one where the density is approximately 1.09 and the sediment status is 'float' or 'sediment' as appropriate.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not seeing the exact option.

Wait, let me check the options again:

The options are:

A: 1.06, float

B: 0.92, float

C: 1.05, float

D: 0.99, float

E: 1.03, sediment

F: 1.09, float

G: 1.15, float

H: 1.08, float

I: 1.2, sediment

J: 1.00, sediment

So, the membrane's average density is approximately 1.09, so looking for the option where the density is 1.09.

Option F is 1.09, and it says 'float'. So the membrane's specific gravity is 1.09, so it would float.

But wait, part (b) is about whether it would 'sediment' or 'float' when centrifuged. So if the material is 1.09 (higher than water), it would float.

So the correct option for part (b) is F. So the overall correct answer is F.

Wait, but in the initial part (a), the question is to find the average density. So the average is 1.09, so the correct option for part (a) is F.

But wait, the provided options for part (a) are not given, but the question is about a multiple-choice with options A-J, each one being a possible answer for both parts.

Wait, wait, perhaps the question is structured as such that each option is a possible pair of (density, sediment) for the membrane.

So each option is a possible pair. So for the membrane, the average density and the sediment status are part of the same option.

So, for the membrane, we need to find the correct pair.

So, for example, option F is 1.09 and 'float'.

So the correct answer is F.

So the overall answer is F.

Wait, but earlier I thought part (b) is 'sediment', which would be option F's 'float' status.

Wait, now I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me clarify the correct answer.

The membrane's average density is approximately 1.09 g/cm³. So the correct option for part (a) is F, which is 1.09.

The membrane's specific gravity is 1.09, which is greater than 1.00, so it would float.

So for part (b), the answer is 'float'.

So the correct pair is F: 1.09, float.

So the overall correct answer is F.

But I need to confirm.

Wait, another way: Let's see the options.

Which option has the membrane's average density of 1.09 and the 'sediment' status? No, because 1.09 is greater than 1.00, so it would 'float' during centrifugation.

So the correct pair is F: 1.09, float.

Thus, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but wait, the question is about both parts a and b. So the correct option would be F, because:

Part a: average density is about 1.09 g/cm³.

Part b: the membrane would float.

So the correct answer is F.

But wait, earlier I thought part (b) would be 'sediment', but that's incorrect. Because 1.09 is more than 1.00, so the membrane would float.

So the correct answer is F.

But looking back, I'm not sure if the options are correctly structured. Let me try to summarize.

The problem asks you to calculate the average density and determine whether the membrane would sediment or float after centrifuging.

The options are A to J, each with a density and a status.

So the correct option is the one where the membrane's average density is approximately 1.09 and the status is 'float'.

So the correct option is F.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the average density of a membrane and determining whether it would sediment or float after being centrifuged. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

### Part (a): Calculate the Average Density
The membrane is composed of 60% protein and 40% phosphoglyceride. The densities are given as:
- Protein: 1.2 g/cm³
- Phosphoglyceride: 0.92 g/cm³

Using the weighted average formula:
\[
\text{Average Density} = (0.6 \times 1.2) + (0.4 \times 0.92)
\]
\[
\text{Average Density} = 0.72 + 0.368 = 1.088 \, \text{g/cm}³
\]

Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
\text{Average Density} \approx 1.09 \, \text{g/cm}³
\]

### Part (b): Determine Sediment or Float
The membrane's specific gravity is calculated as:
\[
\text{Specific Gravity} = \frac{\text{Average Density}}{\text{Density of Water}} = \frac{1.088}{1.00} = 1.088
\]

Since the specific gravity (1.088) is greater than 1.00, the membrane will float when centrifuged.

### Final Answer
The correct option combines the average density of approximately 1.09 g/cm³ and the floating status:
\[
\boxed{F}
\]
