Okay, so I've got this physics problem about an x-ray equipment that discharges a capacitor. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says the capacitor has a capacitance of 0.25 microfarads, which is 0.25e-6 farads. It's discharged from 100 kV to 40 kV during a 0.1-second exposure. I need to find the charge supplied, the average current, and the energy dissipated.

Right, so first, when a capacitor discharges, it's losing charge. But wait, the question is about the charge supplied to the x-ray tube. Oh wait, no—when the capacitor discharges, the charge that leaves the capacitor goes to the tube. So the charge supplied is the initial charge minus the final charge.

Wait, the formula for charge on a capacitor is Q = CV. So initial charge Q_initial is C multiplied by V_initial. Similarly, Q_final is C multiplied by V_final. The charge that flows through the tube is the difference between these two.

So let's calculate Q_initial and Q_final. 

C is 0.25 μF, which is 0.25e-6 F. V_initial is 100 kV, which is 100e3 volts. V_final is 40 kV, so 40e3 volts.

So Q_initial = 0.25e-6 F * 100e3 V. Let me compute that. 0.25e-6 * 1e5 is 0.25 * 10^( -6 +5 ) = 0.25 * 10^-1 = 0.025 C. Wait, wait, no: 0.25e-6 * 100e3 = (0.25 * 100) * 1e-6 * 1e3 → 25 * 1e-3 → 0.025 C. Yep.

Q_final is 0.25e-6 F * 40e3 V. So 0.25e-6 * 4e4. 0.25 * 4 is 1, then 1e-6 * 1e4 is 1e-2. So 1e-2 C, which is 0.01 C.

So the charge supplied is Q_initial - Q_final. That's 0.025 C - 0.01 C = 0.015 C. So that's the charge, which is one of the options. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

A: 0.02
B:0.015
C:0.022
D:0.01
E:0.018
F:0.025
G:0.008
H:0.012
I:0.03
J:0.017

So the charge is 0.015 C, which is option B. So that's the first part.

Now, the average current. Current is charge per time. We have 0.015 C over 0.1 seconds. So 0.015 / 0.1 = 0.15 A, which is 150 mA. So that's the average current.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh wait, no—charge is Q, current is Q/t. So yes, 0.015 C / 0.1 s = 0.15 A = 150 mA. So option B says current is 150 mA, which matches.

Next, energy dissipated. Energy stored in a capacitor is (1/2) C V^2. But wait, what's the initial energy? But in this case, the capacitor discharges from V_initial to V_final, so the energy dissipated is the initial energy minus the final.

Wait, or is it the energy that's dissipated during discharge? Because when the capacitor discharges, it's losing charge, and that charge goes into the tube. So the energy dissipated would be the initial stored energy minus the final stored energy.

Alternative approach: The initial energy is (1/2) C V_initial^2, and the final energy is (1/2) C V_final^2. The energy dissipated is the difference.

So initial energy is (1/2) * 0.25e-6 F * (100e3 V)^2. Let me compute that.

(100e3)^2 is 1e8. So (1/2) * 0.25e-6 * 1e8 → 0.25e-6 * 5e7 → Let's compute: 0.25 *5 =1.25e1 → 12.5 J.

Wait, 0.25e-6 * 1e8 = 0.25e2 = 25. Then 0.5 *25 =12.5 J. So initial energy is 12.5 J.

Final energy is (1/2) *0.25e-6 * (40e3)^2. 40e3 is 4e4, so (4e4)^2 is 1.6e9. So 0.25e-6 *1.6e9 = 0.25 *1.6e3 = 0.4e3 =400. Then 0.5 * 400 = 200 J.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, initial energy is 12.5 J, final is 200 J? That would mean the energy is increasing, which can't be right. Oh no, that's a problem.

Wait, wait. Because when the capacitor discharges, the energy stored should decrease. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate:

Initial energy: ½ * C * V_initial² = ½ * 0.25e-6 F * (100e3)^2.

(100e3)^2 is 1e8. So 0.25e-6 * 1e8 = 0.25 * 1e2 =25. Half of that is 12.5 J. So initial energy is 12.5 J.

Final energy: ½ * 0.25e-6 F * (40e3)^2.

(40e3)^2 = 1.6e9.

So 0.25e-6 *1.6e9 = 0.25 * 1.6e3 = 400. Half of 400 is 200 J. Wait, that can't be right because the final energy is higher than initial, which is impossible when the capacitor discharges. That suggests I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I confused the initial and final voltages. Oh wait, no. The capacitor discharges from 100kV to 40kV. So the stored energy should decrease. But according to my calculation, it goes from 12.5 J to 200 J? That's not possible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recompute.

(100e3 V)^2 is (1e5)^2 V². 1e5 squared is 1e10. Oh, wait, 1e5 is 10^5. So (1e5)^2 is 1e10. So 100e3 is 1e5? Wait, 100,000 is 1e5, yes.

Wait, so initial energy: 0.5 * 0.25e-6 F * (1e5 V)^2.

Wait, 0.25e-6 F * (1e5 V)^2 = 0.25e-6 * 1e10 = 0.25 * 1e4 = 2500. Half of that is 1250 J.

Wait, that's different. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation. Let me recompute:

(1e5)^2 = 1e10. So 0.25e-6 * 1e10 = 0.25e4 = 2500. Half of that is 1250 J.

Similarly, final energy: (40e3 V)^2 is (4e4)^2 = 1.6e9.

0.25e-6 * 1.6e9 = 0.25 * 1.6e3 (since 1.6e9 * 1e-6 is 1.6e3) → 0.25 * 1600 → 400. Half is 200 J.

But that can’t be right. So the initial energy is 1250 J, final 200 J. So energy dissipated is 1250 -200 = 1050 J. Which matches option B's energy of 1050 J.

Wait, but earlier I thought the initial energy was 12.5 J, which is wrong. Oh, I'm getting confused. So let's redo the calculations correctly.

Wait, initial energy: Q=CV, so Q=0.25e-6 F *100e3 V = 0.025 C. Then energy is ½ CV².

Compute ½ * 0.25e-6 F * (100e3 V)^2.

100e3 is 1e5 V. Squared is 1e10 V².

So 0.25e-6 F * 1e10 V² = 0.25 * 1e4 (since 1e10 * 1e-6 is 1e4) → 2500. Then ½ * 2500 = 1250 J.

Similarly, final energy: 0.25e-6 F * (40e3)^2 V².

40e3 is 4e4. Squared is 1.6e9.

So 0.25e-6 * 1.6e9 = 0.25 * 1.6e3 = 400. Half of that is 200 J.

Wait, so initial energy is 1250 J, final is 200 J. So the energy dissipated is 1250 - 200 = 1050 J. Which matches option B's 1050 J.

So, the energy dissipated is 1050 J.

But wait, another thought: when the capacitor discharges, the energy stored decreases. So the initial energy is higher than the final. So the energy dissipated is the difference, which is 1050 J. That's correct.

So the energy dissipated is 1050 J, which is option B.

Wait, but wait another moment. What about the total charge being 0.015 C, which is 150 mA current over 0.1 s, which is 150 mA. So option B says current is 150 mA, which is correct.

So the three values are charge 0.015 C, current 150 mA, energy 1050 J. Which matches option B.

To solve the problem, we calculate the charge supplied to the x-ray tube, the average current through it, and the energy dissipated during the discharge of the capacitor. 

### Step 1: Charge Supplied
The charge on a capacitor is given by \( Q = CV \). The capacitor has a capacitance \( C = 0.25 \, \mu\text{F} = 0.25 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \), and the voltage changes from \( V_{\text{initial}} = 100 \, \text{kV} = 100 \times 10^3 \, \text{V} \) to \( V_{\text{final}} = 40 \, \text{kV} = 40 \times 10^3 \, \text{V} \). The charge supplied is the difference between the initial and final charges:

\[
Q_{\text{initial}} = C \cdot V_{\text{initial}} = 0.25 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 100 \times 10^3 = 0.025 \, \text{C}
\]

\[
Q_{\text{final}} = C \cdot V_{\text{final}} = 0.25 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 40 \times 10^3 = 0.01 \, \text{C}
\]

\[
Q_{\text{supplied}} = Q_{\text{initial}} - Q_{\text{final}} = 0.025 - 0.01 = 0.015 \, \text{C}
\]

### Step 2: Average Current
The average current is given by \( I = \frac{Q_{\text{supplied}}}{t} \), where \( t = 0.1 \, \text{s} \):

\[
I = \frac{0.015}{0.1} = 0.15 \, \text{A} = 150 \, \text{mA}
\]

### Step 3: Energy Dissipated
The energy stored in a capacitor is \( E = \frac{1}{2} CV^2 \). The initial and final energies are:

\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} C V_{\text{initial}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.25 \times 10^{-6} \cdot (100 \times 10^3)^2 = 1250 \, \text{J}
\]

\[
E_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} C V_{\text{final}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.25 \times 10^{-6} \cdot (40 \times 10^3)^2 = 200 \, \text{J}
\]

The energy dissipated is the difference between the initial and final energies:

\[
E_{\text{dissipated}} = E_{\text{initial}} - E_{\text{final}} = 1250 - 200 = 1050 \, \text{J}
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations, the charge supplied is \( 0.015 \, \text{C} \), the average current is \( 150 \, \text{mA} \), and the energy dissipated is \( 1050 \, \text{J} \). These match the values in **Option B**.
