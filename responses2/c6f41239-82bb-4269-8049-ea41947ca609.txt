Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a human resources manager using a hidden market for hiring. I need to figure out which option best represents this scenario. Let me think through each option step by step.

First, the question says the manager hires new personnel through a hidden market. I remember that a hidden market, also known as a non-traditional hiring method, is when a company recruits staff without directly listing the job on a public platform. Instead, they might use other channels like job postings in private places, referrals, or even social media.

Looking at the options:

A: Advertising job openings on job sites. That's more like traditional recruitment, so probably not the answer.

B: Walk-in interviews. That's more of a personal interview process, not a hidden market.

C: Mass email. That's similar to B, just more frequent communication, not a hidden market.

D: Posting in a newspaper or magazine. Again, traditional, so probably not.

E: Recruit through an agency. That's an alternative method, not a hidden market.

F: Posting on social media. That's a common way to reach potential candidates without going through the standard job boards.

G: Posting on the company's website. If the company already has its own website, that's another traditional method. Could also be part of a hidden market if they plan to reach a broader audience.

H: Recommening from an employee. That's more like a referral system, not a market.

I: Headhunter. Headhitters can be done through various channels, including hidden markets. So this fits the scenario.

J: participates in career fair. That's more of an event-based recruitment method, not a market.

So the best fit is option I, using a headhunter to find candidates through a hidden market. This makes sense because a hidden market is about recruiting elsewhere, not just listing the job on public sites.

The correct answer is I: Using a headhunter to find potential candidates through a hidden market.
