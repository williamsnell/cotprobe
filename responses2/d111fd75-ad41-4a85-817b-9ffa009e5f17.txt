Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"In Northern India the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words. A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion."

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the history of Indian states, specifically regarding zamindars and the Mughal Empire's policies. Let's try to break it down.

The question states that in Northern India, states like Zamindar, Rajputana, and Chota Nagpur often referred to as "separate States" are usually just a question of words. The main point is about why zamindars could establish a claim to sovereignty, especially when they had to refuse revenue. So the key here is understanding the policy that allowed them to do that.

The text mentions that Zamindars had an ability to establish sovereignty largely due to the Mughal Empire's policy. The options given are a list of different policies. I need to figure out which one fits best.

The options are:
A: censorship
B: military conscription
C: universal taxation
D: diplomatic immunity
E: martial law
F: feudal system
G: religious toleration
H: free trade
I: martial law
J: suffrage

Wait, I notice some options are repeated, like E and I are the same. So I can consider that.

The question is about the policy that allowed zamindars to refuse revenue, which would indicate a form of control over their revenue without coercion. So the policy in question must relate to how the Mughal government handled the collection of taxes or revenues.

I remember reading that the Mughal Empire implemented a system where the Mughals controlled the collection of taxes to a large extent. They enforced certain rules and might have had some form of censorship. But wait, another option is the idea that the Mughals had the power to tax without the need for consent, which is something like universal taxation. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, the options are:

C: universal taxation. That's a policy where the state collects taxes without the need for the people to consent. Like, you just pay whatever you can, not requiring the government to impose taxes without their consent. But how does that tie into the zamindar's ability to refuse revenue?

Wait, the text says that zamindars had the ability to establish sovereignty by refusing revenue because they paid to the Mughal. So if the government allowed them to do that, the policy probably prevented them from collecting revenue. So that would imply that the Mughal had the power to tax and collect without the people's consent. So the policy is that the Mughals allowed the collection of taxes without the people's consent.

Wait, but that's more like the Mughal's enforcement. Alternatively, perhaps the Mughals had a policy of universal taxation, which would allow them to tax everyone without the people's consent. So that would be option C.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the Mughals were using censorship to control the collection of taxes. Censorship would mean that the government only tax certain classes or allowed certain activities, so that the people couldn't demand their taxes. So that's another option, perhaps.

Wait, the question is about the 'primarily' policy. The options are the policies themselves, not the mechanisms. So which policy refers to the government's ability to enforce revenue collection policies.

Let me think about each option.

A: Censorship. This would be more about restricting certain activities, like not allowing certain classes or religious groups to use the state, so the state doesn't burden certain people. But the question is about the ability to refuse revenue, which is more about taxation.

B: Military conscription. That's about the state restricting the military to certain classes, so that the state can't enforce certain laws. But that's not directly related to revenue collection.

C: Universal taxation. This would mean the state collects taxes from all citizens without requiring their consent. So this would allow the state to tax everyone, including the people, so that the people can't demand their taxes without the state's consent. But the question is about the ability to refuse revenue, so perhaps that's the opposite. If universal taxation allowed the state to tax everyone, but perhaps the state could impose taxes without the people's consent when needed. Or maybe the state could impose taxes without the people's consent, which would be the same as universal taxation.

Wait, if the Mughals implemented universal taxation, they could tax everyone, so the people couldn't demand their taxes. So in that case, it's the Mughals' ability to impose tax without the consent of the people. But the question is about the policy that allowed them to refuse revenue. So perhaps the policy was the state's ability to tax without the people's consent.

Alternatively, the policy might have been that the Mughals allowed the collection of taxes by letting the people pay, without the need for the state to impose taxes. So that would be the Mughals controlling the collection process, perhaps by not imposing taxes, which is a form of censorship.

Another thought: The question mentions that the zamindars were able to establish sovereignty by refusing revenue. So the state (Mughal) was allowing the people to not pay. That suggests that the Mughals could tax without the people's consent, which would be a form of censorship or perhaps the ability to impose taxes without the people's support.

Wait, but the options are:

C: universal taxation. This is about the state collecting taxes from everyone, so it allows them to tax without people's consent. So that would be the primary policy.

Alternatively, the Mughals might have had a policy of universal taxation, which would mean that the state collects taxes from all people. So the people can't demand their taxes without the state's consent. That would fit the idea that the Mughals allowed the people to refuse revenue.

Wait, the question is about the policy. So the correct answer is the one that best describes the Mughal policy allowing them to tax without the people's consent.

So, the policies listed are about the state's actions. So, looking at the options, which one describes the ability to impose taxes without the people's consent.

C: universal taxation. That's a policy where the state collects taxes from all, so people can't demand their taxes. So that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the state's ability to impose taxes without the people's consent, which is the same as universal taxation.

So the correct answer would be option C: universal taxation.

The question focuses on understanding the policy that allowed zamindars in Northern India to establish sovereignty by refusing revenue, which implied the ability to impose taxes without the people's consent. The text mentions that the Mughal Empire's policy likely involved controlling the collection of taxes, allowing the state to impose taxes without the need for the people's consent. This aligns with the concept of universal taxation, where the state collects taxes from all citizens without requiring their consent. 

Analyzing the options:

- **C: Universal taxation** best describes the policy, as it allows the state to tax everyone without the need for the people's consent, which fits the scenario where zamindars refused revenue.
- Other options like censorship or military conscription are less relevant to the ability to refuse revenue.
- Options such as religious toleration or diplomatic immunity are unrelated to the question.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: universal taxation**.
