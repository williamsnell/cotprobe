Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the effects doctrine in the context of criminal law. Hmm, I remember that the effects doctrine is related to how courts determine jurisdiction when evaluating the effects of a crime. Let me try to break this down.

First, I think the effects doctrine is a principle that states that the law applies to the person affected by the crime, not necessarily the person responsible. So, the idea is that the effects of the crime cause some physical or mental harm, and that harm is what determines the jurisdiction. 

Looking at the options, the question is about what the effects doctrine specifically states. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: States that jurisdiction exists only when it's ineffective. Wait, I'm not sure about this. I think the ineffective jurisdiction idea is more about the principle of non-viability as applied to the offense, where if the crime is not effectively carried out, the jurisdiction might be limited. So maybe A isn't correct.

Option B: Says effects doctrine grants jurisdiction to the State sharing the nationality of the victim. That doesn't seem right. I think the effects doctrine is about jurisdiction based on the harm caused, not the nationality of the victim. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: Claims jurisdiction is given to the State sharing the nationality of the offender. Again, that seems off. The effects doctrine is about the harm, not the nationality of the person. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: States the effects doctrine posits jurisdiction is solely determined by the severity of harmful conduct. That doesn't seem right either. The effects doctrine is about the consequences, not the severity. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: The effects doctrine grants jurisdiction to the State on whose territory the conduct produces effects. That makes some sense. The effects are the result, so the jurisdiction would be based on the location where the effect occurs. So E could be a contender.

Option F: Claims the effects doctrine gives jurisdiction to the State on whose territory the conduct originated. Wait, does it matter where the effect originated? I thought it's about the place where the effect happens, not the origin. So maybe F is not correct.

Option G: States jurisdiction exists only when it's effective. That seems similar to the ineffective jurisdiction idea. So G might not be the right answer.

Option H: Says effects doctrine grants jurisdiction to the State that is most affected. That doesn't sound right. The effects are about the harm caused, not who is most affected. So H is likely incorrect.

Option I: Proposes that jurisdiction is given to the State with an effective link to the harmful conduct. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. An effective link might refer to a chain of causation where the crime's effects are linked to a specific place. So maybe I is correct.

Option J: States jurisdiction is given to the State where the offender resides. That lines up with what I was thinking earlier. So J seems correct.

Wait, but I need to make sure. Let me think again. The effects doctrine, as I remember, determines jurisdiction based on the place where the effects (harmonies) occur. So the jurisdiction is determined by the location. So options E and I both seem relevant in a way.

Wait, let's re-examine the options. The question is asking which option correctly describes the effects doctrine.

Looking again:

E says the effects doctrine grants jurisdiction to the State on whose territory the conduct produces effects. That sounds right because the location matters.

I says it grants jurisdiction to the State with an effective link to the harmful conduct. An effective link might mean a physical link, like a chain of causation. Like, if a person is the only one who can be held liable because the effect came from them. So perhaps I is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Which option is more accurate? Let me think about the law.

In some jurisdictions, the effects doctrine (as in the law of effect) is that the jurisdiction is determined by the place where the effect occurs. So for example, if a crime's effects cause harm in a specific area, then the jurisdiction is on that area. So option E is correct in that.

Option I might be referring to the "effective link" which is more about the chain of causation. So if the harm is caused by the offender, then the location where the harm originated (offender's location) would be the link. But I'm not sure if that's how it's framed.

Wait, the effects doctrine is about the place where the effects occur, not where the harm originated. So option E is correct because it states the effects are on the place where the effect happens.

Wait, but looking at the options, I and J both seem to relate to the location. Let me think about the options again.

The question is about what the effects doctrine is. The options are:

E: effects doctrine grants jurisdiction on the state's territory where the conduct produces effects.

J: effects doctrine grants jurisdiction on the state where the offender resides.

So, if the effects are about the place where the harm occurs, then E is correct. But J suggests the location of the offender.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. The effects doctrine in some places (like the United States, I think) states that the effects of a crime cause harm in a specific place, and the jurisdiction is based on that place. So option E is correct.

Wait, but the options E and J are both about the place. So why are they different?

Option E says "the state on whose territory the conduct produces effects." So it's about the place where the effect is produced.

Option J says "on whose territory the conduct originated." So it's about the location where the effect originated.

Wait, but in the effects doctrine, the effect is on the place where the harm occurs, not the origin. So J might not be correct.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of a real example. Suppose someone commits a crime that causes physical harm in a specific location. The effects doctrine would say that the jurisdiction is on that location.

So the effects are on the location, so the location where the effect is produced is where the jurisdiction is determined. So E is correct.

Wait, but I think that's the opposite of what I thought before. Let me try to recall. Oh wait, in the US, the effects doctrine is that the jurisdiction is determined by the place where the effect is produced. So if the crime's effects are in a specific area, that's where the jurisdiction is. So option E is correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another source I remember says that the effects doctrine is that the law applies to the person affected by the harm, not the person who committed the crime. So the effects are on the place where the harm is done, not on where the crime was committed.

So for example, if a crime causes harm to a person in New York, then the effects doctrine would say that New York is where the jurisdiction is granted.

So that would align with option E.

Alternatively, another possible framing is that the effects are on the location where the harm occurs, so the jurisdiction is on that location. So E.

Wait, but the options also include J, which says the state where the offender resides. So perhaps I'm conflating the offense and the effect.

Wait, another approach: The effects doctrine is about the effect being on the defendant. So the jurisdiction is based on the place where the effect is, regardless of where the crime was committed.

So, the correct answer would be E.

The effects doctrine in criminal law states that jurisdiction is determined by the place where the effects of the crime occur. These effects, which cause harm, are located in a specific geographic area, and the jurisdiction is granted to the state on whose territory these effects are produced. This principle emphasizes that the law applies to the person or place affected by the harm caused by the crime, rather than the individual responsible for the crime itself.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option E**: Correct. The effects doctrine grants jurisdiction to the state on whose territory the conduct produces effects. This aligns with the principle that the effects of the crime are located in a specific place, determining the jurisdiction.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. While the effects doctrine involves the location where the effect occurs, it does not specifically refer to the location where the crime was committed.

Thus, the effects doctrine focuses on the geographic area where the harm is produced, not where the crime was committed.
