Okay, let's tackle this question about transformers. The question asks about what a step-up transformer can step up in an electric circuit. The options are various things like resistance, magnetic field, voltage, current, etc. 

I remember that transformers work on electromagnetic induction. They have two coils, one with more turns than the other. When you connect a transformer, you apply a voltage to the primary coil, and the voltage increases in the secondary coil if it's a step-up transformer. So, voltage must be one of the options here.

Looking at the options, option E is voltage. That makes sense because a step-up transformer increases the voltage. So E is in the correct category.

What about the other options? Let me think. Does a step-up transformer step up current? Well, the current depends on the turns ratio. If the secondary has more turns, the current would be higher. But does it step up the current or just increase voltage? Wait, the question is about the transformer's ability to step up, so both voltage and current would be affected.

Wait, but the question might be focusing on what the transformer can do. So, a step-up transformer can step up voltage because the voltage increases. It can also step up current because the current increases when the number of turns increases (if the voltage source is kept constant). So both voltage and current would be correct.

Looking at the answer options, option E is voltage, and then option I is current. So, do both of these apply?

Wait, but the options are separate choices. The question says the transformer can step up in which of the options. So, both E and I would be correct. So the correct answer would include both voltage and current.

Looking at the options, option C is "Both of these." So that's one possibility. Let me check other options. For magnetic field, transformers don't create magnetic fields; they change the voltage and current. So B and F are incorrect. Power is about energy transfer, which isn't the focus here. Frequency is more about alternating current systems, not transformers. Capacitance isn't a transformer part.

So the correct options are E and I. The question is, which option says both E and I? Looking at the options, option C says both. So the correct answer should be C.

The step-up transformer in an electric circuit can step up both voltage and current. Voltage is increased because the secondary coil has more turns, and current is increased due to the higher number of turns, assuming the voltage source remains constant. Both voltage (E) and current (I) are correct. 

Answer: C
