Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a conducting solid sphere with an unknown charge. The sphere has a radius of 10 cm. An electric field 15 cm from the center of the sphere has a magnitude of 3.0e3 N/C and is directed radially inward. We need to find the net charge on the sphere, and there are multiple-choice options given.

Wait, wait, wait. I remember that in electrostatics, the electric field outside a conducting sphere behaves like that of a point charge at the center. Because a conducting material allows charges to move freely, so the electric field outside is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So even though the sphere is conducting, the field outside depends only on the total charge inside, because the charges rearrange themselves on the surface.

So the problem is giving the electric field at a point outside the sphere (15 cm from center, which is bigger than 10 cm, so outside the sphere). The field is directed inward, which means it's a negative charge.

The formula for the electric field outside a conducting sphere (or a point charge) is E = k * |Q| / r². But wait, the direction matters here. Since the field is inward, the charge must be negative.

So the given E is 3.0e3 N/C, and r is 15 cm, which is 0.15 meters.

Wait, but wait, wait again. The sphere's radius is 10 cm, which is 0.10 meters. The electric field is measured at 15 cm away, so it's outside the sphere. So the formula applies.

So let's plug the numbers in. The Coulomb constant k is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So E = (k * |Q|) / r². We can rearrange this to solve for |Q|.

|Q| = (E * r²) / k.

Let me compute that. E is 3e3 N/C. r is 0.15 m, so r squared is (0.15)^2 = 0.0225 m².

Multiply E by r squared: 3e3 * 0.0225 = 67.5 N·m²/C².

Wait, 3e3 is 3000. 3000 * 0.0225 is 67.5. Then divide by k (8.988e9). So |Q| = 67.5 / 8.988e9.

Hmm, let me compute that. 67.5 divided by 8.988e9 is approximately 7.55e-9 Coulombs. Wait, because 67.5 / 8.988e9 is about 7.55e-9 C.

Wait, 8.988e9 is about 9e9. 67.5 / 9 is about 7.5. So |Q| is approximately 7.5e-9 C. But I should be more precise.

Let me calculate 67.5 / 8.988e9.

Wait, 8.988e9 is 8.988 x 10^9. So 67.5 / (8.988e9) = (67.5 / 8.988) * 1e-9.

67.5 divided by 8.988 is approximately 7.55. So |Q| is about 7.55e-9 C. That's 7.55 nC. But since the field is inward, the charge is negative. So Q is -7.55 nC. Looking at the options, option D is -7.5 nC, which is the closest. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Could I have made a mistake in the formula? Oh wait, the field outside is E = k*|Q|/(r²). But since the sphere is conducting, the charge is on the surface. So the field outside is due to the enclosed charge. So yes, the formula applies.

Another thought: what if the charge is on the sphere, but the field is outside. So the sphere's radius is 10 cm, but the point is 15 cm away. So yes, it's outside, so we use the same formula.

So the calculation seems correct. So the correct charge is D: -7.5 nC.

To determine the net charge on the conducting sphere, we use the fact that the electric field outside a conducting sphere behaves like that of a point charge at the center. The given electric field at a distance of 15 cm (0.15 m) is inward, indicating the charge is negative. The formula for the electric field is:

\[
E = \frac{k \cdot |Q|}{r^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(|Q|\):

\[
|Q| = \frac{E \cdot r^2}{k}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(E = 3.0 \times 10^3 \, \text{N/C}\),
- \(r = 0.15 \, \text{m}\),
- \(k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2\),

we calculate:

\[
|Q| = \frac{(3.0 \times 10^3) \cdot (0.15)^2}{8.988 \times 10^9}
\]

First, compute \(r^2\):
\[
r^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225 \, \text{m}^2
\]

Then, calculate the numerator:
\[
E \cdot r^2 = (3.0 \times 10^3) \cdot 0.0225 = 67.5 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2
\]

Finally, divide by \(k\):
\[
|Q| = \frac{67.5}{8.988 \times 10^9} \approx 7.55 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{C}
\]

Since the electric field is inward, the charge is negative. Thus:
\[
Q = -7.55 \, \text{nC}
\]

Comparing with the options, the closest match is \(Q = -7.5 \, \text{nC}\), which corresponds to option D.
