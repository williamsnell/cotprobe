Okay, so I have this economics problem here about saving schedules. Let me read it again.

The question says that consumption (C) is given by the equation C = 200 + (2/3)Y. I'm supposed to find the savings schedule, which is S, and determine when savings would be zero. There are multiple-choice options, so I need to figure out the correct formula for S and the corresponding Y value.

Wait, what's the relationship between C, S, and Y? I remember that in macroeconomics, total income (Y) is equal to consumption plus savings. So, Y = C + S. That makes sense because Y is all the money people have to spend, and savings is the money they set aside.

So, let's plug in the given C into that equation. We have C = 200 + (2/3)Y. So Y is equal to C plus S. So substituting C:

Y = (200 + (2/3)Y) + S.

Hmm, let's solve for S. So, Y = 200 + (2/3 Y) + S. Let me rearrange this to get S by itself.

Subtract (2/3 Y) from both sides: Y - (2/3 Y) = 200 + S.

What's Y minus (2/3 Y)? Well, Y is the same as (3/3)Y, so (3/3 - 2/3)Y = (1/3)Y. So, (1/3)Y = 200 + S.

Wait, no, because I had Y = 200 + (2/3 Y) + S. Subtract (2/3 Y) from both sides: Y - (2/3 Y) = 200 + S.

Y - (2/3 Y) = (1/3 Y). So, (1/3)Y = 200 + S.

So, solving for S: S = (1/3 Y) - 200. Alternatively, S = (1/3)Y - 200. Let me write that as S = (1/3)Y - 200.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Option A says S = -300 + (1/2)Y. No, that's negative 300, not negative 200. So probably not A.

Option B: S = -100 + (1/3)Y. Hmm, but I got -200. So maybe not B.

Option C: S = -200 + (3/4)Y. No, that's 3/4, but my calculation was 1/3.

Option D: S = Y - 200 - (2/3)Y. Let's compute that. Y minus (2/3 Y) is (1/3 Y), so this becomes (1/3 Y) - 200. That's the same as what I got earlier. So D's formula is correct, S = (1/3)Y - 200.

But wait, let me double-check. Let me compute D again.

S = Y - 200 - (2/3)Y. Let me express Y as 3/3 Y to have the same denominator.

So, Y is (3/3)Y. So, (3/3 Y) - (2/3 Y) = (1/3 Y). Then, minus 200. So S = (1/3)Y - 200. Yep, same as before.

So, the formula for savings is S = (1/3) Y - 200. Looking at the options, is that any of them?

Looking at the options, option A is S = -300 + (1/2)Y. No, not that.

Option C: S = -200 + (3/4)Y. No, not that.

Option D: S = Y - 200 - (2/3)Y. Hmmm, that's correct as I found out.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option E says S=0, but that's when Y is 300? Or maybe when savings are zero, Y is 300. Let me think. Oh, part b is the question about when savings are zero, so that's a separate part.

Wait, the question is in two parts: a) find the savings formula, and b) find when S=0.

So in part a, the formula is S = (1/3) Y - 200, which is option D's formula. So D is correct for part a.

Wait, no, looking at option D: S = Y - 200 - (2/3)Y. Let's compute this.

Y - (2/3 Y) is (1/3 Y), so S = (1/3 Y) - 200. Which is the same as S = (1/3)Y - 200. So that's correct.

Now, for part b: when is S zero? So set S=0 and solve for Y.

So, 0 = (1/3) Y - 200.

Adding 200 to both sides: 200 = (1/3) Y.

Multiply both sides by 3: Y = 600.

So savings would be zero when Y is 600. So the answer for part b is Y=600.

Looking at the options, option D's part b would be Y=600. Because D's formula is S = Y - 200 - (2/3)Y, which leads to S=0 when Y=600.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option D: S = Y - 200 - (2/3)Y, Y=600.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but what about option E: S=0, Y=300. That would imply that when Y=300, S=0. Let's see if that's possible.

Using the formula S=(1/3)Y-200, when Y=300, S would be (1/3)*300 -200 = 100-200= -100. So S=-100, not zero. So E is incorrect.

Option A: S = -300 + (1/2) Y. So, when Y=300, S= -300 + 150 = -150. Not zero.

Wait, no, because for S=0, (1/3) Y must be 200, so Y=600.

So the correct answer for part a is D (S=(1/3)Y -200), and for part b, Y=600.

So looking at the options, the correct option matching both is option D, because it has the correct formula for S and Y=600 is the correct value for that.

Wait, but wait the options are a) and b). Let me look for the option that has S = (1/3) Y - 200 and Y=600.

Looking at the options:

Option D: S = Y - 200 - (2/3)Y â†’ which is correct, and Y=600.

Yes, option D as per the options has the correct formula and Y=600.

Other options: Let's see.

Option A: S=-300 + (1/2)Y, which would be S when Y=600: (1/2)*600=300, so 300-300=0. So S would be zero, but the formula is wrong. So A's formula is wrong.

Option B: S = -100 + (1/3) Y. So at Y=600, (1/3)(600)=200. So S=200-100=100. So not zero.

Option C: S= -200 + (3/4)Y. At Y=600, (3/4)*600=450. So S=450-200=250, not zero.

Option E: S=0, Y=300. That's a different Y.

So the correct option is D.

To determine the savings schedule and the value of Y when savings (S) are zero, we start with the given consumption schedule:

**Given:**  
\( C = 200 + \frac{2}{3}Y \)

**Key relationship:**  
\( Y = C + S \)  

Substituting the given C into the equation:  
\[
Y = \left(200 + \frac{2}{3}Y\right) + S
\]

Rearranging to solve for S:  
\[
Y - \frac{2}{3}Y = 200 + S
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3}Y = 200 + S
\]
\[
S = \frac{1}{3}Y - 200
\]

Thus, the savings schedule is:  
\( S = \frac{1}{3}Y - 200 \)

**Part (a):**  
The correct formula for savings is \( S = \frac{1}{3}Y - 200 \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

**Part (b):**  
To find when savings are zero:  
\[
0 = \frac{1}{3}Y - 200
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3}Y = 200
\]
\[
Y = 600
\]

Thus, savings are zero when \( Y = 600 \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

### Correct Option:
- **a)** \( S = \frac{1}{3}Y - 200 \) (Option D)
- **b)** \( Y = 600 \) (Option D)
