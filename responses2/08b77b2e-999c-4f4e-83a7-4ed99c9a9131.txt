Okay, so I've got this question here about the minimum escape velocity of a spacecraft from the moon. Hmm, I remember that escape velocity is the speed needed for an object to break free from a planet's gravitational pull without further propulsion. But wait, how exactly does that work?

I think the formula for escape velocity is something like v = sqrt(2GM/r), right? Where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and r is the radius of the planet. So for the moon, I need to plug in the moon's mass and radius into that formula.

Wait, I don't remember the exact values for the moon. I know Earth's escape velocity is about 11.2 km/s. But the moon is much less massive and smaller. Let me think. The moon's mass is about 7.35% of Earth's mass, and its radius is about 1738 km. Oh wait, but wait, the escape velocity formula depends on both mass and radius. So the moon's escape velocity would be sqrt( (M_moon / M_earth) * (r_moon / r_earth)^2 ). Because escape velocity is proportional to sqrt(M/r), so for the moon, it's sqrt( (0.0735)*( (1738/6371)^2 ) )

Wait, let me calculate that. 1738 is roughly 0.275 times 6371 because 6371/4 is about 1592.75, so 6371 is 4 times 1592.75. 1738 is a bit more than that, perhaps around 0.275 * 6371 ≈ 1753 km? But wait, no, that's not right. Because 6371 is the Earth's radius, which is approximately 6371 km. Oh, wait, I'm mixing up units. Let me clarify.

Wait, the escape velocity from Earth is about 11.2 km/s. The moon's escape velocity would be smaller. Let me think, perhaps it's around 1.7 km/s? Because the moon is much less massive. But wait, maybe I should look it up in my notes. Oh, wait, I think the moon's escape velocity is about 2.38 km/s. But wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I can think of the escape velocity from the moon as being approximately 1.66 km/s. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should derive it.

Escape velocity from moon: v = sqrt(2 * G * M_moon / r_moon )

G is 6.674×10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

Mass of the moon, M_moon, is about 7.35×10^22 kg. The radius of the moon, r_moon, is approximately 1737.4 km, which is 1.7374e6 meters.

So plugging into the formula: v = sqrt(2 * 6.674e-11 * 7.35e22 / 1.7374e6 )

Let me compute the numerator first: 2 * 6.674e-11 *7.35e22 = 2 * 6.674 *7.35e11. Let's compute 6.674 *7.35 first. 6 *7 is 42, 0.674*7 is about 4.718, 6*0.35 is 2.1, 0.674*0.35≈0.2359. So 42+4.718+2.1+0.2359=50.0539. So approximately 50.0539e11 (since 1e-11 *1e22 is 1e11). So 2 *50.0539e11 = 100.1078e11.

Now divide by 1.7374e6: 100.1078e11 / 1.7374e6 = (100.1078 / 1.7374) *1e5. Let me calculate 100.1078 divided by 1.7374.

100.1078 / 1.7374 ≈ let's see: 1.7374 *57 is about 57 *1.7374 =57 *1.7 is 96.9, 57 *0.0374≈2.13, so total about 99.03. So 57 gives about 99.03, so 100.1078 is a bit more. So 57.1? Let me compute 1.7374 *57.1 ≈ 1.7374 *57 = 99.03, plus 0.1 *1.7374 =0.17374. So 99.03 +0.17374=99.203. So 57.1 gives 99.203. Our numerator is 100.1078, which is 0.9048 more. So 0.9048 /1.7374 ≈ 0.522. So total is 57.1 plus 0.522 ≈57.622.

Wait, but wait, 1.7374 * 57.622 is approximately 57.622 *1.7374. Let me calculate that. 57 *1.7374 = approx 99.03, 0.622 *1.7374≈1.080, so total about 100.11. Which matches the numerator. So 57.622 is the factor, so 57.622e5 m/s.

The square root of that is v = sqrt(57.622e5) m/s.

Wait, 57.622e5 is 5.7622e6. Square root of 5.7622e6 is sqrt(5.7622) *1e3. Because sqrt(5.7622e6) = sqrt(5.7622) * 1e3. So sqrt(5.7622) is approximately 2.4 (since 2.4^2=5.76). So v≈2.4e3 m/s, which is 2400 m/s.

Looking at the options, option B is 2470, option A is 2100, C is 2600, D is 2380. Wait, our calculation was about 2400, so the closest would be option B (2470) or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, did I compute the escape velocity correctly? Let me double-check the formula. The escape velocity is sqrt(2GM/r). Let me compute it again.

M_moon = 7.35e22 kg, r_moon = 1.7374e6 m. G=6.674e-11.

Calculating 2 * G * M / r:

= 2 *6.674e-11 *7.35e22 /1.7374e6 

Multiply numerator:

6.674e-11 *7.35e22 = (6.674 *7.35) *1e11 = ~49.01e11.

Then multiply by 2: 98.02e11.

Divide by 1.7374e6: 98.02e11 /1.7374e6 = (98.02 /1.7374) *1e5.

Compute 98.02 /1.7374 ≈ 56.55.

So 56.55e5 m²/s². So sqrt(56.55e5) m/s.

Wait, 56.55e5 is 5.655e6. The square root of 5.655e6 is sqrt(5.655)*1e3.

sqrt(5.655)= approx 2.378. So 2.378e3 m/s, which is about 2378 m/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 2380. So our calculation comes close to 2380 m/s. Hmm, but wait, earlier I thought the calculation was about 2400, but when I recheck, it's 2378. So that's option D.

Wait, but wait another moment. Did I correctly compute M and r? Let me make sure.

Yes, M_moon is 7.35e22 kg, correct. r_moon is 1.7374e6 meters. So the calculation seems correct.

So the escape velocity is approximately 2378 m/s. Looking at the options, option D is 2380. So the closest is D.

To determine the minimum escape velocity of a spacecraft from the moon, we use the formula for escape velocity:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}
\]

where \( G \) is the gravitational constant (\( 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{m^3 \, kg^{-1} \, s^{-2}} \)), \( M \) is the mass of the moon (\( 7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \mathrm{kg} \)), and \( r \) is the radius of the moon (\( 1.7374 \times 10^6 \, \mathrm{m} \)).

### Step 1: Compute the numerator
\[
2GM = 2 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 7.35 \times 10^{22}
\]
\[
2GM = 2 \times 6.674 \times 7.35 \times 10^{11}
\]
\[
2GM = 98.02 \times 10^{11} \, \mathrm{m^3 \, s^{-2}}
\]

### Step 2: Divide by \( r \)
\[
\frac{2GM}{r} = \frac{98.02 \times 10^{11}}{1.7374 \times 10^6}
\]
\[
\frac{2GM}{r} = 56.55 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{m^2 \, s^{-2}}
\]

### Step 3: Take the square root
\[
v = \sqrt{56.55 \times 10^5}
\]
\[
v = \sqrt{5.655 \times 10^6}
\]
\[
v \approx 2378 \, \mathrm{m/s}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The calculated escape velocity is approximately \( 2378 \, \mathrm{m/s} \). Among the given options, the closest value is \( 2380 \, \mathrm{m/s} \), which corresponds to option **D**.
