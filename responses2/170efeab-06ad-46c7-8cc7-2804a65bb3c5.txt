Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"But you, my dear Pangloss," said Candide, "how can it be that I behold you again?"
"It is true," said Pangloss, "that you saw me hanged&….A surgeon purchased my body, carried home, and dissected me. He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&…[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&….
One day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&….She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&….We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us."
"Well, my dear Pangloss," said Candide to him, "when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?"
"I am still of my first opinion," answered Pangloss, "for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis."
Voltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Voltaire's philosophy and which other philosopher he critiques similarly. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the question refers to a passage from Voltaire's "Candide." The passage discusses the outcomes of being hanged, dissected, and whipped, and how Voltaire thinks everything happens for the best. He then goes on to critique Leibniz, arguing that his views are not wrong because of Leibniz's claims.

The question is asking which other philosopher Voltaire critiques in a similar way. So I need to think about other philosophers whose works Voltaire would find insightful or comparable in his critique of foundational concepts like harmony, causality, and the importance of principles like Leibniz's.

Let me go through the options:

A: David Hume — Hume is known for his skepticism about causality and existentialism. His work is more about how we should act based on observable events rather than underlying principles.

B: Cesare Baccaria — Not sure about this one. I don't recall Baccaria being a major figure in philosophy.

C: Karl Marx — Marx is more about history and economics, critique of society, and the idea of class struggle. Not directly related to Voltaire's critique of fundamental principles.

D: Adam Smith — Smith is about economics and the idea of the market. His work is more about individualism and free markets, not necessarily similar to Voltaire's philosophical critique.

E: Jean-Jacques Rousseau — Rousseau was a social theorist, especially with his "Social Contract." His ideas are more about the role of the state and individual freedom. Not directly related to Voltaire's critique.

F: Friedrich Nietzsche — He's known for his existentialism and anti-philia. His work is about the afterlife and the meaning of life, which is different from the philosophical critique in the question.

G: John Locke — Locke's work is about natural law, individualism, and the idea that rights are inherent and not subordinate to power. His ideas are on the basis of natural rights and the view that the state is only there to maintain order, not for the greater good.

H: Søren Kierkegaard — He's a philosopher in Christian tradition, especially regarding the nature of God and the state of being. His ideas are different, more religious.

I: Immanuel Kant — Kant is known for his critical philosophy, ethics, and the idea of the categorical imperative. His work is more about moral principles and the ethics of action, contrasting with the more existentialist and critical philosophical views.

J: Thomas Hobbes — Hobbes is the father of modern rationalism, focusing on the idea that governments should be ordered by reason, and that individuals should have the freedom to decide what to do. His work is also about the natural state of society and the importance of individual reason.

Wait, so Voltaire was critical of Leibniz, who is an atomist (opposed to the atomism of Descartes), and he was also a rationalist. So he was critical of ideas that suggest that the universe is governed by underlying principles, not by human will.

Looking at the options, the ones that focus on principles, underlying causes, and not human will are Adam Smith (D), John Locke (G), and maybe Immanuel Kant (I). Wait, but Adam Smith is more about economics, whereas the question is about Voltaire's critique of principles, not really about individualism or economic systems.

Wait, but I think the best fit is Adam Smith because he's about the foundation of society, individualism, the principle of self-interest. But wait, the passage in the question is about Voltaire's critique of Leibniz, so perhaps the other philosopher he's critiquing is Adam Smith, who might focus on the foundation of society, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the person Voltaire critiques is Adam Smith because he's critical of the idea that the universe is governed by underlying principles, as in Voltaire's "Candide." But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: the passage talks about being hanged, which is a form of execution, and Voltaire is arguing that everything happens for the best. So in this context, he's critiquing the idea that human actions and events are optimal, without considering the underlying causes or the possibility of human error.

Looking at the options, the person who might be similarly critiquing foundational principles is John Locke. He's a rationalist who believed in the natural state of society and the importance of individual reason, but his work is more about the moral ideal than critique of existence.

Wait, but Voltaire was also a rationalist. So perhaps the other philosopher he critiques is Adam Smith, but I'm not certain.

Wait, alternatively, the question is about the same style of critique. Voltaire's "Candide" is known for its critical, philosophical approach. So what other philosophers would adopt such a method?

John Locke's "Two Treatises" are also philosophical critiques, but more focused on human rights and the natural state. Alternatively, perhaps Immanuel Kant, but his approach is more about ethics and the categorical imperative.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The question is asking which other philosopher Voltaire would share his critique. So Voltaire is criticizing Leibniz's ideas, but what else?

Looking at the options, the correct answer is probably John Locke because he's known for his rationalism and the idea that all human actions are based on reason. But wait, in the passage, Voltaire is critiquing the idea that everything is for the best, which ties into Leibniz's optimized world view. So perhaps the other philosopher shares a similar critique of optimizing the world, which is more about Leibniz than Locke.

Wait, but the options don't have Leibniz. The options are among the given names. So perhaps the correct answer is Adam Smith because his work is about the foundation of society, individualism, and the idea of the natural state. However, the passage in the question is more about the idea that "everything happens for the best," which is a more philosophical critique.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is Immanuel Kant, but I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: the passage says that Voltaire thinks that everything is for the best, which is a more general philosophical stance. So which other philosophers have such a stance?

Wait, I think the answer is John Locke. Because he is a rationalist who focuses on human rights and the natural state, which aligns with the idea that the universe is governed by underlying principles and not human will.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the passage in the question is about Voltaire's critique of Leibniz's optimized world view. So, the other philosopher he would similarly critique would be someone who is a rationalist, focusing on the underlying principles of existence.

So among the options, the best fit is John Locke, because his "Two Treatises" are about the natural state, individualism, and the importance of reason.
