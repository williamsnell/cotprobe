Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about how images and sounds are maintained in sensory memory. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's see, I remember that sensory memory is the temporary storage of information processed by the senses. So when we see something or hear something, our brain holds it in memory until it's needed.

The question is asking about the time frame during which images and sounds remain in sensory memory. The options are A to J. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact duration, but I think it's something like 5-60 seconds or so. Wait, I think the typical duration is less than a minute. Let me think about each option:

A: less than 5 seconds. That seems too short. I don't think sensory information stays that short. Even in a classroom, I can see things quickly.

B: 30 to 45 seconds. That's a common time frame I've heard before. For example, when you look at something, you might remember it for a few seconds before forgetting. Maybe I remember a classmate's face for a couple of seconds before forgetting.

C: only while the sensory input is present. Hmm, that's a bit vague. Does it mean that the information is present during the time of input, or that it's only stored during that time? I think it's more about the duration of storage, not just presence.

D: 10 to 15 seconds. That's shorter than B. I'm not sure if that's the correct timeframe. Maybe it's a different study or maybe I'm mixing it up with something else like eye movements or something.

E: exactly 5 minutes. That's a longer timeframe. I don't think sensory memory holds information for that long. It's probably more like 5 seconds to a minute.

F: about 60 to 90 seconds. Wait, that's longer than B. I thought maybe 30-45 was more common, but maybe 60-90 is possible? I'm not entirely sure, but I remember that for some types of information, it's longer. Like when you're listening to a long audio clip, you might remember it for a while.

G: minutes to days, depending on the depth of encoding. That sounds a bit technical. If the information is encoded deeply, maybe it stays longer, but I'm not sure. I don't think it's minutes to days, that's a very long time.

H: an hour to a day. That's way too long. I don't think sensory memory holds information for that duration.

I: until the information is transferred to short-term memory. Wait, no. That's the opposite. Sensory memory is the short-term, immediate storage, whereas short-term memory is longer but still temporary. So this seems to mix up the storage times.

J: an indefinite period of time. No, that's not right. It's a temporary storage, so indefinite doesn't fit.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be B: 30 to 45 seconds. I think that's the standard timeframe for images and sounds in sensory memory. I might have confused it with other memory types, but based on what I remember, B makes sense.

The correct answer is B: 30 to 45 seconds. This timeframe aligns with the typical duration during which sensory information, such as images and sounds, is stored in sensory memory. 

Answer: B
