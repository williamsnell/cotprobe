Question:

A gardener sued a homeowner for breach of contract. The gardener claims that the homeowner hired him to perform landscape work at his home. After performing the gardening services, the homeowner paid him $100. The gardener, who speaks only English, contends that the homeowner, who speaks only Japanese, originally agreed to pay him $200 for the work. When the parties entered into their agreement, the gardener was accompanied by his friend, who is now deceased, who spoke both English and Japanese. This jurisdiction has a typical Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the gardener now seeks to testify to the terms of his agreement with the homeowner as communicated to him by his friend. Upon objection by the homeowner's attorney, the gardener's proposed testimony is

Options:

A: inadmissible, as it is hearsay and not an exception under the Dead Man's Statute.
B: inadmissible, because the gardener did not have a translator present during the agreement.
C: admissible, as it is relevant to the case and not excluded by the Dead Man's Statute.
D: admissible as non-hearsay to corroborate evidence of a verbal act.
E: inadmissible, because the friend was not an official translator.
F: admissible, because it is a statement of a deceased person.
G: admissible as an admission by a party-opponent.
H: inadmissible, unless it is established that the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms of the contract.
I: admissible, as it is a statement made during the course of employment.

Okay, so I have this hire contract question here. Let me try to break it down. The scenario is a gardening services case where the gardener sued the homeowner. The key points are that the gardener claims the homeowner hired him to do landscape work, but the homeowner paid $100. The gardener says the original agreement was for $200. Now, the issue is about whether the gardener can testify to the terms he was told by a friend who spoke both English and Japanese.

Wait, the legal term here is Dead Man's Statute. I remember that the Dead Man's Statute is a rule in some jurisdictions that allows some statements made by someone not of the same nationality or language as the parties to be used as evidence. It's similar to the hearsay rule, but it's more inclusive.

So the question is, did the friend act as an official translator? The friend was accompanied by his deceased friend, who spoke both languages. The parties entered into the agreement. The friend spoke both languages, but the original agreement was in English. The problem is whether the friend's statements can be used as evidence.

Hmm. The Dead Man's Statute applies if the statement is made by someone not of the same national language or nationality as the parties. Since the parties are the gardener and the homeowner, and the friend is not their native speakers (he spoke both), maybe this applies.

Wait, but in this case, the friend is deceased. So when the parties were discussing the agreement, did the friend speak English and Japanese? If the friend is deceased, the only way the statement is made is through his deceased friend. So the statements he made before his death would be based on the friend's words. But the issue is whether the friend's own words can be used.

Wait, the Dead Man's Statute says that statements made by someone not of the same nationality as either party are inadmissible unless they meet certain conditions. If the statement is made by someone who is not of either party's nationality, but the parties themselves are of different nationalities, then maybe it's allowed. Or is it only if the statement is made by someone not of the same nationality as either party?

Wait, I think the rule is that a statement made by someone not of the same nationality as either party is admissible under the Dead Man's Statute. So if the statement was made by someone not from the gardener or homeowner's nationalities, then it's admissible.

In this case, the friend spoke both languages, but the parties are the gardener and the homeowner. The statements were communicated to the gardener by the friend, who is not a native speaker of either party. So the statements could be considered as being made by someone outside the parties' nationalities.

Wait, but the friend is deceased. So if he spoke to the gardener, did he use the Dead Man's Statute? Or is the issue that the friend is not an agent of the parties? Because the problem states that the friend spoke both languages. If the statement was made by someone who is not an official translator, then perhaps it's admissible.

Wait, the question says the friend was accompanied by his deceased friend, who spoke both languages. So when the parties were discussing the agreement, the friend spoke both languages. So the statements were made by the friend, who is an out-of-court third party.

In the context of the Dead Man's Statute, the statement made by a third party (like a friend) who is not part of the original parties but is not of the same nationality as either, is admissible.

Wait, but the original parties are the gardener and the homeowner. If the friend is not of their nationalities, then the statement would be inadmissible unless it's being used to establish that the parties intended it. But the question is about whether the gardener can testify to the terms communicated by the friend.

Wait, but the friend is not an official translator. So the statement might not be admissible unless the parties intended to use it to prove that the agreement was properly communicated. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the Dead Man's Statute is more about statements made by individuals not of the same nationality as either party. So if the friend is not a native speaker of either, then their statement would be allowed. But in this case, the friend is not a native speaker of either party. So I think that the statement by the friend is allowed under the Dead Man's Statute.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Dead Man's Statute says that a statement made by a person not of the same nationality as either party is inadmissible unless certain conditions are met, such as the statement being made under the direction of an official agent of the parties.

In this case, the friend is a deceased person. So he might not have been an official agent. So the statement by him would not be admissible. Because he wasn't an official agent, so the statement wouldn't qualify under the Dead Man's Statute.

Wait, another angle: the parties were the gardener and the homeowner. The friend is not their agent, but spoke both languages. So the statements were made by him, but since he's not an agent, the statement wouldn't be allowed.

Wait, but the question says the friend was accompanied by his deceased friend. So perhaps he was an agent. Or maybe not. Hmm, the problem states that the friend is deceased, but when the parties were discussing, the friend spoke both languages.

Wait, perhaps the friend is acting as a third party, not an official agent. So when the parties were discussing the contract, the friend made the statements. If the friend is not from the same nationalities as the parties, then the statements would be inadmissible.

Wait, the Dead Man's Statute allows statements by non-English-speaking individuals if they were made under the direction of an official agent. So if the friend was an official translator, then it's allowed. But in this case, the friend is deceased and perhaps not an official agent.

Wait, the problem states that the friend was accompanied by his deceased friend, who spoke both languages. The parties were discussing the agreement. So perhaps the friend was communicating with the gardener, but not as an agent of the parties.

Wait, but the question is whether the friend's statements can be used as evidence. The Dead Man's Statute might not apply if the statement came from a third party who is not an official agent. So if the statement was made under the direction of an officer from the gardener or homeowner, then it's allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the friend was acting as an agent, but since he's deceased, maybe he didn't have time to act, so he didn't make the statements. Or perhaps he did.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. I think the key point is: under the Dead Man's Statute, statements from a third party (non-parties) are allowed only if they were made under the direction of an official agent. So if the friend was an official agent, the statement would be admissible. But if the statement was made without an agent, then it's not.

In this case, the friend was accompanied by his deceased friend, but the question doesn't specify if the friend was acting as an agent. If he wasn't, then the statements wouldn't be admissible.

Alternatively, the friend might have spoken to the gardener directly, perhaps as an agent. But if the friend was deceased, maybe he didn't have time to act, so the statements were made by him as a third party.

Wait, but the problem says the friend spoke both languages. So the statements were made by him, but since he's not a native speaker of the parties, the statements wouldn't be allowed.

Wait, but the problem says the friend was accompanied by his deceased friend, who spoke both languages. So perhaps the friend was acting as an agent, but was deceased. So he was an official agent, perhaps.

In that case, the statement would be admissible because it was made under the direction of an official agent.

Wait, but if the friend was deceased, perhaps he couldn't have been actively acting as an agent. Hmm. That might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the friend is not acting as an official agent, so the statement wouldn't qualify under the Dead Man's Statute.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is about whether the friend's statements can be used as evidence.

The Dead Man's Statute allows statements from non-parties to be inadmissible unless they were made under the direction of an official agent of the parties. So, if the friend was an official agent, then the statements would be admissible. If not, then they are not.

But the problem doesn't specify that the friend was acting as an official agent. It just says he spoke with his deceased friend. So perhaps the friend was an agent but was deceased, so he couldn't have made the statements in time.

Wait, but if the statement was made by a third party without any agent, it's not allowed. So if the friend was not an agent, the statements would be inadmissible. But if the friend was an agent, it's allowed.

Alternatively, maybe the friend is not an agent, so the statements are not inadmissible. But the problem states that the friend was accompanied by his deceased friend, which makes me think that the friend was acting as an agent.

So, I'm getting confused again. The problem says the friend (who is deceased) was accompanied by his deceased friend. So perhaps the friend was acting as an agent for the parties, but was deceased.

Wait, but if the friend was an agent, then their statements (as communicated to the gardener) would be allowed as evidence. But if not, then it's inadmissible.

Alternatively, perhaps the statements were made by the deceased friend, so the statements would be based on the deceased friend's words. But regardless, the issue is whether the statements are inadmissible.

Wait, the question states that the friend is not a native speaker of the parties, so the statement would be allowed under the Dead Man's Statute only if the statement was made under the direction of an official agent.

If the friend was an agent, then yes. But if not, then no.

But the problem says the friend was accompanied by his deceased friend. So perhaps the friend was acting as an agent. So the statements were made under the direction of the deceased friend.

In that case, the statements would be admissible.

Wait, but if the deceased friend was acting as an agent, then the statements would be admissible. The issue here is whether the statements were made by the friend himself or by someone else.

Alternatively, perhaps the statements were made by the deceased friend, but since he's deceased, the statements are based on his words. But the key is whether the statements were made under the direction of an official agent.

If the friend was an official agent, then yes. If not, then no.

In the problem, the friend is accompanied by his deceased friend. So perhaps the friend was acting as an agent. However, since the friend is deceased, perhaps he didn't have a chance to make the statements. So the statements were made without proper agent's approval.

Wait, but even if a statement was made without an agent, it's not admissible under the Dead Man's Statute. So the statements would not be admitted unless they were made with the agent's authority.

So, without an agent, the statements would be inadmissible. But the problem doesn't say the friend was acting as an agent. It just says he spoke both languages.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck because the problem's key point is whether the statements are admissible under the Dead Man's Statute. The issue is the friend's origin of the language.

Wait, the parties are the gardener and the homeowner. The friend is not from either of their nationalities. So their statements would be allowed unless they were made by a third party without an agent. But since the friend is deceased, perhaps he didn't have a chance to act as an agent. So their statements wouldn't be admissible.

Wait, but the problem says they were communicated to the gardener by the friend, who is deceased. So perhaps the statements were made under the friend's own statement, not under an agent's direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the statements were made directly by the deceased friend, but since he's not an agent, the statements would not be admitted.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that the statements were made under an agent. So if the friend was not acting as an agent, the statements wouldn't be admissible.

So, the answer would be that the statements are inadmissible because the friend was not an official translator. Therefore, option B: inadmissible because the gardener did not have a translator present during the agreement.

Wait, but wait. Another angle: the friend was not a translator, but the original agreement was in English. If the statement was made by someone who is a third party (non-parties), but the statement was made by someone who is not from the parties' nationalities, then it's allowed under the Dead Man's Statute.

Wait, the Dead Man's Statute is about statements made by a third party (not of the same nationality as either party) being inadmissible unless they were made under the direction of an official agent. So, if the friend is not a native of either party, their statements would be inadmissible unless they were directed by an official agent.

In this scenario, the friend spoke both languages. But is he an agent? Since the friend was accompanied by his deceased friend, perhaps he was acting as an agent. But if he's deceased, he can't have acted as an agent. Therefore, the statements would not be admissible.

So, the correct answer would be that the statements are inadmissible because the friend wasn't an official translator, so the answer is B.

Wait, but if the friend was acting as an agent, then the statements would be admissible. But since the friend is deceased, perhaps he didn't have time, so he couldn't have made the statements. So the option B is correct.

Wait, but another thought: the issue is whether the statement was made by an agent. If the friend was an agent, then the statements are admissible. But if not, then they're not.

But the problem doesn't specify that he was. So perhaps the answer is that the statements are inadmissible because the friend wasn't an agent of either party.

So, looking at the options, option B says inadmissible because the gardener didn't have a translator present. That makes sense if the friend wasn't acting as an agent. Therefore, B is the correct answer.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the statements made by a deceased friend, who spoke both languages, can be admitted as evidence of the terms of a contract under the Dead Man's Statute. The key issue is whether the friend's statements were made by someone not of the parties' nationalities and whether they were directed by an official translator.

The Dead Man's Statute allows statements made by a third party (not of the same nationality as either party) to be inadmissible unless they were made under the direction of an official agent of the parties. In this case, the friend is not a native speaker of either the gardener or homeowner, and the problem does not specify whether the friend acted as an official translator or was merely a third party. However, since the friend was accompanied by his deceased friend, it is plausible that the friend was acting as an agent. If the friend was an agent, their statements would be admissible. If not, the statements would not be allowed.

Given the lack of explicit information that the friend was acting as an official translator, it is reasonable to assume that the statements were not made under the direction of an agent. Therefore, the statements would not be inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute.

ANSWER: B
