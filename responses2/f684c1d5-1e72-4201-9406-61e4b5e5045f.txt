Options:

A: 187 + 223 - 25 + 4
B: 187 + 223 - 30 + 3
C: 180 + 230 - 30 + 3
D: 185 + 225 – 25 + 1
E: 190 + 220 – 30 + 4
F: 200 + 200 – 30 – 4
G: 190 + 220 - 25 + 2
H: 187 + 223 - 26 + 2
I: 200 + 200 – 25 – 1
J: 190 + 220 - 25 + 1

Okay, I'm trying to solve this math problem. Let me read it again. So, Max picked 187 strawberries and Jonathan picked 223. Together, they ate 26 strawberries. The question is asking which expression shows the total number of strawberries they have left.

Hmm, so first I'll calculate how many they had together before eating. Then subtract the 26 they ate. Let me break it down.

Max picked 187. Jonathan picked 223. Adding those together: 187 plus 223. Let me do that math. 187 + 223 equals 410. So together, they had 410 strawberries.

They ate 26 of those. So I subtract 26 from 410. 410 - 26 is 384. So the total left is 384.

Now I need to look at the options to find which one equals 384.

Looking at the options:

A: 187 + 223 -25 +4 → That's (187+223)=410, then -25 is 385, +4 is 389. Not 384.

B:187+223-30+3 → 410-30=380 +3=383. Not 384.

C:180 +230 -30 +3 → 180+230=410, minus 30 is 380, plus 3=383. Same as B.

D:185 +225 –25 +1 → 185+225=410, minus25 is 385, plus1=386. Close, but not 384.

E:190 +220 –30 +4 → 190+220=410, minus30=380, plus4=384. Oh wait, that's 384. So E is 384.

Wait, but let me check all options.

Wait, another way. Let's think about the options again.

Wait, the total after eating 26 is 410-26=384.

Looking for an expression that adds 187 and 223, subtracts 26, and equals 384.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option E is 190 +220 –30 +4. Let's compute that:

190 +220 is 410. Then -30 is 380, plus 4 is 384. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, the initial numbers Max and Jonathan picked were 187 and 223. So their sum is 410. So any expression must be equivalent to 410 -26 =384.

Looking for an expression that equals 384.

Wait, another approach: Let's see if any option correctly represents 187 +223 -26.

Let me look at the options again.

Option H: 187 +223 -25 +2 → 187+223=410, minus25=385, plus2=387. Not 384.

Option I:200+200-25-1. 200+200=400. 400-25=375. 375-1=374. No.

Wait, none of the options seem to match 410 -26=384. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, 187 +223 is 410. Minus 26 is 384.

Looking for an expression that adds 187 and 223, then subtracts 26.

Looking at the options, let me see:

Option B:187 +223 -30 +3 → 187+223=410, then -30 is 380, +3 is 383. Not 384.

Option E:190 +220 -30 +4 → 190+220=410, minus30 is 380, plus4 is 384. Yes, that's correct.

But wait, the sum of 187 and 223 is 410. So any option that adds those two and then subtracts 26 should be correct.

Looking through the options:

Option C:180 +230 -30 +3 → 410-30=380 +3=383. No.

Option D:185 +225 –25 +1 → 185+225=410, minus25=385. +1=386. No.

Option E:190+220-30+4 → 410-30=380 +4=384 → Yes.

Wait, but let me see another approach: perhaps the options are using rounded numbers.

Maybe they rounded each number to the nearest hundred or so. Let me see.

Wait, Max picked 187, which is approximately 190. Jonathan picked 223, which is approximately 220. So 190 +220=410.

Then they ate 26. So 410 -26=384.

Which option is 190+220-26? Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option G is 190 +220 –25 +2. So that would be 190+220=410. Minus25=385. Plus2=387. Not 384.

Option H is 187+223-25+2. That's 410-25=385 +2=387. No.

Another option: option E is 190+220-30+4. So 190+220=410. Minus30=380. Plus4=384. That's correct.

So the correct option is E.

The correct expression is E: 190 + 220 – 30 + 4, which equals 384.
