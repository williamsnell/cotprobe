Okay, so I've got this question about marginal benefits and marginal costs, which I remember relates to consumer decision-making. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about Skylar eating a second piece of cake at a birthday party. The options are about the conditions that must be true for this to happen. I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, I recall that marginal benefit (MB) is the additional satisfaction or utility someone gets from consuming one more unit of a good. Marginal cost (MC) is the additional cost incurred by producing or consuming another unit. The decision to consume more is based on whether the MB is greater than or less than MC.

So, if someone is eating a second piece, this means they've already consumed one. But wait, that doesn't affect the decision about the second piece. Each piece might have the same MB and MC. However, each piece adds to the total benefit.

Now, I think about the conditions under which a person would stop consuming. The basic rule is that a person will keep consuming until the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost, and any additional consumption would result in a negative marginal benefit. So, for each additional unit, MB should be greater than or equal to MC, and the total benefit keeps increasing until MB equals MC.

Wait, but in this case, the person is eating the second piece. But the options are about the conditions that must be true for this action. So, what's the condition for them to stop after having already consumed one?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the scenario where the second piece is being consumed. So, the first piece is already consumed, and the person is now considering the second. So, the conditions would relate to whether the MB of the second piece is greater than or less than the MC.

Wait, but each piece's MB and MC might be the same as the first. So, the decision to eat the second piece would be based on whether MB is greater than MC. If the MB of the second piece is greater than the MC, the person will eat it. If it's less, they won't. If equal, they might decide to eat it.

So, the situation in the question is that the second piece is being eaten. That implies that MB for that piece is greater than MC. Because if it were equal, they might just consider it neutral, not necessarily stopping. But in most cases, people consider MB >= MC.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: MB < MC. If MB is less than MC, the person would not want to eat the second piece. So this condition is not correct in this scenario.

Option B: Total benefit is falling. Wait, if MB is less than MC, the total benefit would be increasing, not falling. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Ratio of MB over MC less than 1. This would mean MB < MC, which again would mean the person is not eating the second piece. So C is incorrect.

Option D: MB > MC. This would mean that each additional piece provides more utility than its cost. So the person would prefer to eat it, which fits the scenario where the second piece is being eaten. So D is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the question is about the "last character" of the answer. Oh, the options are letter choices, so the correct answer is D.

The question involves determining the condition under which the second piece of cake is consumed. The key concept here is marginal benefit (MB) and marginal cost (MC). MB is the additional satisfaction gained from eating another piece, while MC is the additional cost. The decision to eat the second piece depends on whether MB exceeds MC. If MB is greater than MC, the person will consume the second piece. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A**: Incorrect because if MB < MC, the person would not consume the second piece.
- **B**: Incorrect because a falling total benefit would occur if MB > MC.
- **C**: Incorrect because MB < MC would prevent consumption.
- **D**: Correct because MB > MC aligns with the scenario of eating the second piece.

Thus, the correct answer is **D**.

Answer: D
