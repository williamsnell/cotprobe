Question:

A homeowner buys a new leaf blower and is so impressed with its power that he gets carried away and blows large amounts of his work onto the next door neighbor's yard. In addition to leaves, he also blew large amounts of pest-infested plant debris onto the neighbor's property. The material has accumulated into large, unsightly piles and caused damage to the neighbor's healthy plants. He has to pay workers to haul the material away and he incurs expenses to replace infected perennials. The neighbor sues for the tort of trespass. The homeowner files a motion to dismiss because the neighbor cannot prove that homeowner acted with an intent to trespass or to do harm. Will the court grant the motion to dismiss?

Options:

A: Yes, because the homeowner expected the wind to carry the debris away and did not think that it would accumulate on the neighbor's property.
B: No, because the homeowner's actions resulted in a direct invasion of the neighbor's property.
C: Yes, because the debris was not intentionally directed at the neighbor's property.
D: Yes, because the homeowner was not aware of the pest-infested debris.
E: No, because the neighbor was able to prove financial loss from the damage caused.
F: No, because trespass is based on an intentional act of entering the land or sending something onto the land, and the actor does not have to intend harm to be liable for the tort.
G: Yes, because the homeowner had no practical way of controlling where the material went and he acted without malice or ill will.
H: Yes, because the homeowner did not physically enter the neighbor's property.
I: No, because the infected debris constituted an abnormally dangerous condition and homeowner could be held strictly liable for the trespass.
J: No, because the act of blowing debris onto the neighbor's land constitutes a trespass regardless of intent.

Okay, so I have this torts question here, and I need to figure out whether the motion to dismiss is granted or not. Let me read through the question again.

The homeowner buys a new leaf blower and blows a lot of debris, including plant debris, onto his neighbor's property. The debris has been built into piles that damage the neighbor's healthy plants. The neighbor sues for trespass. The homeowner files a motion to dismiss because the neighbor can't prove he acted with intent to trespass or did harm. I need to determine if the court will grant the motion.

Hmm, let's break this down. The key here is understanding what trespass involves. From what I remember, trespass is an act of entering the land with the intent to commit an act that is unlawful or dangerous to the land or its inhabitants. It doesn't necessarily require intent to cause harm, but it does involve intent to enter or to commit an act that's dangerous.

Looking at the options, I need to see which option supports the idea that the homeowner acted with intent to trespass. So, the neighbor can't prove the homeowner intended to harm, so the intent to trespass is a factor.

Option A says the homeowner expected the wind to carry the debris away and didn't think it would accumulate. That seems like intent to leave the debris away, which doesn't directly involve trespass. trespass is about entering or committing an act that's dangerous. So A probably isn't the answer.

Option B suggests the actions resulted in a direct invasion. That's about invasion, which is a separate element. trespass is about intent to enter or commit an act dangerous to land. So B isn't about trespass.

Option C says the debris was not intentionally directed. Again, this is about intent to leave or direct, not trespass.

Option D states no malice or ill will. Malice is intent to cause harm, which is related but not the same as intent to trespass. trespass requires intent to enter or commit an act, not to cause harm.

Option E claims the neighbor could prove financial loss. While financial loss is a defense, it's not the basis for a trespass claim. The defense is about the neighbor's case, not the law.

Option F: trespass is based on intent to enter or send something onto the land. That's exactly what F says. So if the intent is there, then the neighbor can't prove otherwise.

Option G says no practical way to control. That's more about negligence. If the homeowner couldn't control where the debris went, maybe it's negligence, but that's about negligence. Here, the question is about intent to trespass.

Option H suggests no malice or ill will. Malice is intent to cause harm, which isn't required for trespass. So H is about intent to cause harm, not trespass.

Option I says the debris was abnormal and he's strictly liable. I think this is about the dangerous condition, which is a separate element. The neighbor can't prove the condition is dangerous, so this isn't the basis for a trespass claim.

Option J says it's trespass regardless of intent. That's F's point. The neighbor can't prove intent because it's about the act's intent. So J is suggesting that, but the options don't have a choice about intent. Looking at the options, F says that intent isn't required because it's about the act's intent.

Wait, looking at the options again: Option F is "No, because trespass is based on an intent to enter the land or send something onto the land, and the actor does not have to intend harm to be liable for the tort." Hmm, so F is saying that intent to enter or commit the act is required, but not intent to cause harm.

So the question is whether the neighbor can prove intent to trespass. If F is correct, then the intent is required, so the neighbor can't prove intent, so the motion to dismiss would be granted.

So the correct answer is F, which says the neighbor cannot prove intent to trespass or harm, so the court grants the motion.

The neighbor cannot prove the homeowner acted with intent to trespass or harm, so the court will grant the motion to dismiss. This is because trespass requires intent to enter or commit an act that is inherently dangerous to the land or its inhabitants.
