Okay, so I've got this question about neutrons in a reactor. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question is about when the number of neutrons reaches half a billion. The reactor starts up, and the number of neutrons doubles each minute. After 10 minutes, there's one billion neutrons. So they're asking when the neutrons hit 500 million.

Wait, wait. Let me think. So the number doubles every minute. That sounds like exponential growth. The formula for exponential growth is N = N0 * 2^t, where N is the final number, N0 is the initial, and t is time in minutes. But wait, in this case, the number doubles each minute, so N0 is the number at t=0.

Wait, but the question is about when N becomes 500 million. But wait, the given is that after 10 minutes, the number is one billion. So let's see: 10 minutes gives 1e9. So 1e9 is 2^10 * N0. Wait, because each minute it doubles, so after 10 minutes, it's N0 * 2^10 = 1e9.

Wait, so N0 is the initial number at t=0. But the question is asking when the number reaches 500 million, which is half a billion, so 5e8. So I need to find t where 5e8 = N0 * 2^t.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. So the problem says that the number of neutrons doubles each minute. So, perhaps the initial number is 1, or maybe it's something else. Wait, the given is that after 10 minutes, it's 1e9. So 1e9 = N0 * 2^10. So solving for N0: N0 = 1e9 / (2^10) = 1e9 / 1024 ≈ 976,562.5. So N0 is about 976,562.5.

But wait, the question is asking when the number of neutrons reaches half a billion. So 5e8. So 5e8 = N0 * 2^t. So substituting N0, 5e8 = (1e9 / 1024) * 2^t. Let me compute that.

Wait, 5e8 = (1e9 / 1024) * 2^t
Multiply both sides by 1024: 5e8 * 1024 = 1e9 * 2^t
So 5e8 * 1024 is 5e8 * 1e3 = 5e11? Wait no, 1024 is 1e3 approx. Wait, 5e8 * 1e3 is 5e11? Wait, wait, 1024 is 1.024e3, so 5e8 * 1.024e3 = 5e8 * 1.024e3 = 5e11 * 1.024, so approximately 5.12e11.

So 5.12e11 = 1e9 * 2^t
Divide both sides by 1e9: 5.12e11 / 1e9 = 512 = 2^t
Because 1e9 *2^t =5.12e11 → 2^t = 5.12e11 / 1e9 = 512.

512 is 2^9 because 2^9 is 512. So t=9 minutes.

So the answer should be 9 minutes, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me think about it in reverse. Starting from 1e9 at 10 minutes. Since it doubles each minute, going back one minute would be 1e9 /2 =5e8. So 5e8 is at 9 minutes. So yes, option A is correct.

The number of neutrons doubles each minute. After 10 minutes, there are one billion neutrons. The question asks when the number of neutrons reaches half a billion (500 million). 

Using the formula for exponential growth, \( N = N_0 \cdot 2^t \), where \( N \) is the final number of neutrons, \( N_0 \) is the initial number, and \( t \) is time in minutes, we can determine the time when \( N = 500,000,000 \). 

Given that after 10 minutes (\( t = 10 \)), \( N = 1,000,000,000 \), we can find \( N_0 \):  
\[
1,000,000,000 = N_0 \cdot 2^{10} \implies N_0 = \frac{1,000,000,000}{1024} \approx 976,562.5.
\]

To find the time \( t \) when \( N = 500,000,000 \):  
\[
500,000,000 = 976,562.5 \cdot 2^t \implies 2^t = \frac{500,000,000}{976,562.5} \approx 512.
\]  
Since \( 512 = 2^9 \), \( t = 9 \) minutes. 

Thus, the number of neutrons reaches half a billion at 9 minutes.
