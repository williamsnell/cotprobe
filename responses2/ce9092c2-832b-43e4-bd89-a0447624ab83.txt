Okay, so I've got this economics question here about the impact of a major earthquake on the West Coast on the equilibrium price level and quantity of output. Hmm, let's think this through.

The question says that the earthquake destroys much of the plant and equipment on the West Coast. I remember that plant and equipment relate to the production function, specifically how much output a country can produce given the factors of production. So if a lot of these are destroyed, it probably affects the supply side of the economy.

The assumption here is that the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping. I recall that an upward sloping AS curve means that as output increases, the price level can also increase. The economy is at equilibrium when the aggregate demand (AD) curve intersects with the AS curve.

When the West Coast plants and equipment are destroyed, this would reduce the supply of goods and services that can be produced. So, for example, suppose a country's economy relies on certain industries that have become unusable. Without these plants, that industry's output would drop. This would shift the AS curve to the left because the economy's ability to produce goods and services decreases.

Wait, but the AS curve is upward sloping. So if the economy can't produce as much, the AS curve shifts left. Now, where does this lead the economy? The AS curve left shifts left, and the AD curve remains the same unless AD changes. So the new equilibrium would be at a lower price level and lower output because both the AD and AS are lower.

Wait, let me make sure. Let's go step by step. Before the earthquake, AS is to the right (high output, high price level). After destruction, AS shifts left. So to the left, which is a decrease in potential output. So the new equilibrium occurs where AD meets the left-shifted AS. That should happen at a lower price level and lower output because the economy can't produce as much.

So what are the options? The options are about the price level and quantity of output. The options are A through J.

Option D: Price level increases, output decreases. Wait, no. Because AS shifts left. So the economy can't produce as much, so output should decrease. So for D, price level would increase? No, that's not right. Because if AS is left, the intersection point is lower. So price level would go down, output goes down.

So looking at the options, D says price level increases and output decreases. That's the opposite of what's happening. So let's think again.

The destruction causes the AS curve to shift left. So the new equilibrium will have a lower price level and lower output. So which option says that? Looking at the options:

Option E: Price level remains same, output increases. No, that's not it. 

Option F: Both same. No.

Option G: Price level same, output decreases. No, because when AS left, output would decrease, but price might not change. Wait, but does a left shift in AS affect the price level when AD is unchanged? Let me think about the AD-AS model.

Suppose that before the earthquake, the economy was at equilibrium with a certain AD and AS. After the earthquake, AS shifts left. Now, if the AD curve remains the same, the new equilibrium is where the left-shifted AS meets AD. So output will be lower than before, and the price level will also be lower, right? Because both AD and AS are lower.

Wait, but why would the price level decrease if both are lower? Because when both curves shift left, the lower point is where both are. So the price level would go down, and output goes down.

So the new equilibrium will have lower price level and lower output. So looking at the options, which one fits this? Let's see:

Option E: Price level same, output up. No.

Option G: Price same, output down. No.

Which option says both down? Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

E: Price same, output up.

F: Same, same.

G: Same price, down output.

H: Price down, output same.

I: Price down, output up. (Not sure.)

J: Price down, output up.

Wait, no. Wait, the options given:

Looking back, the options are:

Options A to J are:

A: Price level up, output same.

B: Both up.

C: Both down.

D: Price up, output down.

E: Price same, output up.

F: Both same.

G: Price same, output down.

H: Price down, output same.

I: Price down, output up.

J: Price down, output up.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me recheck the options.

Wait, the user provided the options as:

Options:

A: Price up, same output.

B: Both up.

C: Both down.

D: Price up, output down.

E: Price same, output up.

F: Both same.

G: Price same, output down.

H: Price down, output same.

I: Price down, output up.

J: Price down, output up.

Wait, no, the options are:

E says price level remains same, output increases. No, that's not correct.

G says price level and output stay same? No, because the destruction reduces production, so output should decrease.

So going back, after the destruction, AS shifts left. So the new equilibrium will have lower output and lower price level.

Looking for an option where price level is down and output is down. Let's look for such an option.

Option G is price same, output down. No.

Other options: none of the options say both down. Wait, looking again, I think I might have misread the options. Let me check again.

Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

If the destruction leads to a left shift in AS, and the AD curve remains unchanged, then the new equilibrium will have lower price and lower output. So which option is that?

Looking back at the options:

Looking at the options again:

E: same price, up output.

No.

F: same, same.

No.

G: same price, output down.

No.

H: price down, output same. No.

I: price down, output up. No, because output would decrease.

J: price down, output up. No.

Wait, none of the options seem to describe both down. Did I make a mistake in my previous reasoning?

Wait, perhaps the destruction affects the production function, so the long run AS is fixed. But the question states the destruction is on the plant and equipment, which affects the short run. So in the short run, AS shifts left.

But in the long run, if technology is the same, they might adjust. But the question doesn't specify whether it's short run or long run. Hmm, but usually, the question mentions short-run effects.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous, but in the absence of specific info, it's likely about the short run.

Wait, but the question says "the equilibrium price level and quantity of output", which I think refers to short-run. So let's proceed under that.

In the short run, if AD remains the same and AS shifts left, then the new equilibrium is lower price and lower output. So this would be option G if it exists. But looking at the options provided, there's no option for both price and output down. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me reevaluate.

The destruction of plants and equipment: so suppose the economy's production capacity is reduced. So the same level of output cannot be achieved as before. This leads to a left shift in the short-run AS curve.

So when AD is unchanged, the new equilibrium is at a lower price level and lower output.

Looking at the options:

Looking for a situation where price level and output both decrease. If the options don't have such a choice, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, looking back at the options, option G says price level same and output decreases. No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the effect is different. Let me think again.

Another approach: when destruction occurs, the supply of goods and services reduces. So for example, if the entire West Coast is destroyed, the country's total production capacity might decrease, leading to lower potential output but also lower actual output.

In the short run, the AS curve is fixed (if we're assuming fixed technology and capital), so it would shift left.

But if in the short run, the AS shifts left, and the AD remains the same, the new equilibrium would be at a lower price level and lower output.

So the equilibrium price level and quantity both decrease.

But looking at the options, is there such an option? Let me check again.

Wait, the options given are:

A: price up, output same.

B: both up.

C: both down.

D: price up, output down.

E: price same, output up.

F: same, same.

G: price same, output down.

H: price down, output same.

I: price down, output up.

J: price down, output up.

Wait, option C says both down. So if my analysis is correct, the correct answer should be option C: price level and output both decrease.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the destruction would lead to a left shift of the AS curve, which would lead to lower prices and lower output. So the correct answer would be option C. But according to the options given, option C is present.

Wait, but looking at the original options again, option C is "The equilibrium price level and quantity of output decrease." So that would be the correct choice.

But wait, earlier I thought that after the destruction, the output would decrease, but price level would decrease as well. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer would be option C.
</think>

The destruction of much of the plant and equipment on the West Coast reduces the economy's production capacity, causing the short-run aggregate supply (AS) curve to shift to the left. This shift leads to a new equilibrium where both the price level and the quantity of output decrease. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The price level does not increase; instead, it decreases.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Both the price level and output do not increase.
- **Option C**: Correct. Both the price level and quantity of output decrease as a result of the leftward shift in the AS curve.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The price level does not increase; it decreases.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The price level does not remain the same; it decreases.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Both the price level and output are not the same.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The price level does not remain the same; it decreases.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The price level does not decrease; it decreases.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The price level decreases, not increases.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The price level and output do not both increase.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: The equilibrium price level and quantity of output decrease**.
