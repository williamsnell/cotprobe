Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question says that eleven pencils cost as much as three pens. And they told us that seven pens cost $9.24. We need to find the cost of one pencil in cents.

Hmm, okay, first, I think I should figure out how much one pen costs. Then, since eleven pencils equal three pens, I can find the total cost for three pens and then divide by eleven to get the cost per pencil.

Wait, the seven pens cost $9.24. So, maybe I should convert that to cents first because the final answer needs to be in cents. Let me do that. $1 is 100 cents, so $9.24 is 924 cents.

So, if seven pens cost 924 cents, then one pen must cost 924 divided by 7. Let me calculate that.

924 ÷ 7: 7 goes into 924. Let me see, 7*132 is 924 because 130*7 is 910, plus 2*7 is 14, so 910+14=924. So each pen is 132 cents.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 7*130=910, and 7*2=14, so 910+14=924. Yes, that's correct. So each pen is 132 cents.

Now, since eleven pencils cost as much as three pens, let's find the total cost for three pens first. Three pens would be 3 times 132 cents. 3*132 is 396 cents.

So, 11 pencils cost 396 cents. Therefore, one pencil costs 396 divided by 11. Let's do that division.

396 ÷ 11: 11*36=396 because 11*30=330, 11*6=66, so 330+66=396. So each pencil is 36 cents.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Oh, wait no, I think I made a mistake in the pen calculation. Wait, 7 pens cost 924 cents, so one pen is 924/7=132 cents. Three pens would be 396. 396 divided by 11 is 36.

Looking at the options, option J is 36. So the answer should be J:36.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options include other numbers. Let me make sure I didn't mix up which unit. The question says the answer must be in cents. So yes, 36 cents is correct.

The cost of seven pens is $9.24, which is 924 cents. Each pen costs 924 ÷ 7 = 132 cents. Three pens cost 3 × 132 = 396 cents. Since eleven pencils cost the same as three pens, each pencil costs 396 ÷ 11 = 36 cents.

Answer: J:36
