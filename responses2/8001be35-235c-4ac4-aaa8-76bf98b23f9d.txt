Okay, so I have this question about Mr. Morris wanting to buy an MGB convertible. Let's see... He called a dealer and got a quote in British pounds, and I need to figure out if he can afford it based on the exchange rate. Hmm, the question is split into two parts: part a) asks if he can afford it, and part b) asks what the exchange rate must be for him to buy it.

Alright, the exchange rate given is £1 = $2.20. Mr. Morris planned to spend no more than $7500. So first, I'll probably need to convert the £3500 to dollars to see if it's within his budget.

Wait, let me think. If £1 is $2.20, then £3500 would be how much in dollars? Oh right, I multiply 3500 by 2.20. Let me calculate that. 3500 * 2.20. Let's see, 3500 * 2 is 7000, and 3500 * 0.20 is 700. So together, that's 7700. Oh, so £3500 is $7700. But he only has a budget of $7500. Since 7700 is higher than 7500, he can't afford it. So part a) is no, he can't afford it.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, wait—no, because if the exchange rate is £1 = $2.20, then the value of the pound is stronger than that. So a higher value of the pound would mean that the same dollar buys less. So if the rate is £1 = $2.20, then a higher exchange rate would make the car more expensive in dollars. Or wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the exchange rate is £1 = $2.20. So that means 1 British pound is worth $2.20. So if the exchange rate is higher, it would mean the British pound is stronger. Wait, no, wait: a higher exchange rate means 1 British pound equals more dollars. So, for example, if the exchange rate is £1 = $2.20, that's the current rate. If it were higher, say £1 = $3.00, that would mean more pounds can be bought for a dollar, meaning the pound is stronger. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, wait, no, exchange rates are usually presented as how much you get in the foreign currency per unit of the base currency. So, £1 = $2.20 means 1 British pound is worth $2.20. So to get dollars, you multiply pounds by that rate.

Wait, but if the exchange rate were, say, £1 = $3.00, that means 1 pound is worth more dollars, so it's stronger. So to get dollars from pounds, you'd multiply by 3.00. So if Mr. Morris's car costs £3500, then in dollars that's 3500 * 2.20 = $7700. So he can't afford it, as 7700 is more than 7500.

So part a) is "No, he can't afford the car." So looking at the options, any option where he can't afford is A, B, C, D, E, F. E says he can't, and the rate is $1.90. But wait, that's not matching my calculation.

Wait, wait. Wait, the options are about the required exchange rate for him to afford. So, for part a), the exchange rate is given as £1 = $2.20. Since he needs to pay more, his exchange rate would be higher. Wait, no, because if the exchange rate is higher, he would have to pay more in dollars, which he can't afford. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The question is about the exchange rate, which affects how much the car costs in dollars. If the exchange rate is stronger (i.e., £1 is worth more dollars), then Mr. Morris would have to pay more. Wait, but in this case, the exchange rate is given as £1 = $2.20, which is a stronger pound. So he needs more dollars to buy the same car.

Wait, no. I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The exchange rate is given as £1 = $2.20. So, for every 1 British pound, you get 2.20 dollars. So, if Mr. Morris buys a car that costs £3500, that would cost 3500 * 2.20 = $7700. He only has £7500. Wait, no—wait, wait, no—wait, no, no, wait. Wait, the question is: Mr. Morris is quoting a price in pounds, and he's planning to spend no more than $7500.

Wait, the question says he's quoted a price of £3500. He plans to spend no more than $7500. So, he's willing to spend up to $7500. So, if the exchange rate is £1 = $2.20, then £3500 is 3500 * 2.20 = $7700. So he can't afford it because 7700 is more than 7500. So part a) is 'can't afford'—so the correct option would be one where he can't afford and the exchange rate is such that he can't afford. But wait, the options for the exchange rate are for the exchange rate that allows him to afford the car.

Wait, let me re-read the question. The question is part a) whether he can afford it given the exchange rate is £1 = $2.20. So, the first part is a yes/no question based on the given exchange rate.

So, part a) is "If the exchange rate is £1 = $2.20, can he afford the car?" The answer is no, he can't afford it.

Then part b) is "How low must the exchange rate be in order for Mr. Morris to buy the car?" So, he wants the exchange rate so that £3500 converts to $7500.

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait—the question says he plans to spend no more than $7500. So for part b), he's willing to spend up to $7500. So, he wants to know the exchange rate at which £3500 is equal to $7500. So let's calculate what exchange rate would make 3500 pounds = 7500 dollars.

So, exchange rate would be 7500 dollars / 3500 pounds = 2.142857 approximately. So 2.142857 dollars per pound. So the exchange rate would need to be £1 = $2.142857.

So the exchange rate should be approximately £1 = $2.142857. So if the exchange rate is lower than that, he can afford it.

But wait, let me think again. The exchange rate is the value of one unit of the foreign currency in terms of the base currency. So, if the exchange rate is £1 = $2.20, that means 1 pound is worth 2.20 dollars. So to get how many pounds you get per dollar, it's 1 / 2.20 = 0.4545 pounds per dollar. But Mr. Morris has a budget of $7500. He can't afford the car if the car costs more than 7500 dollars.

Wait, so if the exchange rate is £1 = $2.20, then the car is £3500, which is 3500 * 2.20 = $7700. So he can't afford it. So part a) is no.

But for part b), he wants the exchange rate that allows the car to cost him $7500. So:

£3500 = $7500.

Therefore, exchange rate (denoted as R) is such that 1 R = 7500 / 3500 = 2.142857.

So the exchange rate must be £1 = $2.142857.

Wait, but wait—wait, no. Because exchange rate is usually presented as how much you get in the foreign currency. So, if the exchange rate is R, then 1 R = R dollars. But in this case, we're looking for the exchange rate that would make £3500 equal to $7500.

So, R is the amount of dollars per pound. So, R = 7500 / 3500 = 2.142857, so R is approximately 2.142857 dollars per pound.

So, the exchange rate is £1 = $2.142857. So, for part b), he must have the exchange rate at or below that, because if the exchange rate is lower, then a pound buys more dollars. So, if exchange rate is £1 = $2.14, then £3500 would cost 3500 * 2.14 = 7490, which is less than 7500. So he can afford it.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute. 3500 * 2.14 = ?

3500 * 2 = 7000.

3500 * 0.14 = 490.

So sum is 7000 + 490=7490. So if the exchange rate is £1 = $2.14, then the car would cost 7490, which is less than 7500. So he can afford it.

So, the exchange rate must be at least approximately 2.142857.

Looking at the options, each option gives a certain exchange rate, and for option E, it says exchange rate must be £1 = $1.90. Wait, no, option E says exchange rate is £1 = $1.90, but that's not correct because in that case, the car would cost 3500 *1.90 = 6650, which is way below 7500. So, option E is not correct.

Wait, but the options are about what exchange rate would allow him to buy the car. So, for part b), he can afford the car only if exchange rate is at least R=7500/3500 ≈2.142857.

Looking at the options, let's see which option has exchange rate R=2.142857. Looking at the options:

A: exchange rate is 1.50.

B: 1.80.

C: 2.50.

D: 1.60.

E: 1.90.

F: 3.00.

G: 2.40.

H: 2.00.

I: 2.14.

J: 2.00.

Wait, none of them have R=2.142857. The closest is option I, which says the exchange rate must be £1 = $2.14.

Wait, so if the exchange rate is £1 = $2.14, then 3500 pounds would be 3500 * 2.14 = 7490, which is just under 7500. So he can afford it.

So the lowest exchange rate he can accept is approximately 2.142857. So the exchange rate must be at least 2.142857. So the exchange rate must be £1 = $2.14.

Looking at the options, option I says exchange rate is £1 = $2.14. So that's the correct one.

So the options:

E: exchange rate is £1 = $1.90. He can afford? Then no, because 3500 *1.90=6650<7500.

Option I: exchange rate is 2.14. He can afford because 3500*2.14=7490≤7500.

So for part b) the answer is exchange rate must be £1 = $2.14, which is option I.

So, the options for part a) is 'can he afford it' when exchange rate is 2.20. The answer is no, so he can't.

But the question is in the options A-F, I-J, and I think the options are about both parts a) and b).

Wait, the question says: Mr. Morris can afford the car if the exchange rate is 2.20. So, a) is yes.

Wait, let's check.

Wait, no, the first part (a) is a yes/no question based on exchange rate being 2.20. So the answer is 'can he afford the car?'. Since his car is £3500, and at 2.20 per pound, it's 3500 *2.20 = 7700, which is more than his budget of 7500, so he can't afford it.

So, part a) is no, he can't. So, looking for the option where he can't afford, and the exchange rate is such that he can't afford.

Wait, but let's look at the options:

The options are for each part. I think each option is a combination of part a) and part b).

Wait, the options are:

A: He can't afford the car; the pound must be $1.50.

B: He can afford the car; the pound must be $1.80.

C: He can afford the car; the pound must be $2.50.

D: He can afford the car; the pound must be $1.60.

E: He can't afford; the pound must be $1.90.

F: He can't afford; the pound must be $3.00.

G: He can afford; the pound must be $2.40.

H: He can afford; the pound must be $2.00.

I: He can't afford; the pound must be $2.14.

J: He can't afford; the pound must be $2.00.

Wait, so for each option, part a) is about whether he can afford based on exchange rate, part b) is about the exchange rate required. Wait, no, no. Looking at the options, each option is a choice where part a) is whether he can afford, and part b) the exchange rate. But wait, I think the options are combining both a) and b) for each choice.

Wait, perhaps each option is saying whether he can afford, and what exchange rate is required. Or maybe only one of a) and b) is considered.

Wait, maybe each option is a possible answer that combines both a) and b). For example, option A says he can't afford and the exchange rate is 1.50. But that doesn't make sense in context. Wait, no, perhaps each option is a possibility where the exchange rate is a certain value, and for a) it's whether he can afford, and for b) it's what exchange rate he must have.

Wait, perhaps the options are:

Each option is a possible situation: for example, option A is: He can't afford the car; exchange rate must be £1 = $1.50.

Wait, but that can't be right because when exchange rate is 2.20, he can't afford. So the exchange rate in option A is 1.50, which is £1 would be $1.50, meaning the pound is stronger. So, if exchange rate is 1.50, that's stronger than 2.20.

Wait, maybe I'm getting it backwards. The exchange rate of £1 = $2.20 means that 1 pound is worth 2.20 dollars. So, if the exchange rate is higher (higher value), the pound is stronger. So, for part a), exchange rate given is 2.20. So, Mr. Morris's car is £3500, which is 3500 * 2.20 = 7700 dollars. He can't afford it, so part a) is 'can't afford', so in the options, the correct one for a) is 'He cannot afford the car' (as in options A, F, etc.), and the exchange rate needed for part b) is when the car's cost is within his budget.

So, the exchange rate for part b) is the one that makes 3500 pounds cost him 7500 dollars. So, exchange rate R must satisfy 3500 * R = 7500 → R = 7500 / 3500 = 2.142857.

So the exchange rate must be at least approximately 2.142857 dollars per pound.

Looking at the options, option I says exchange rate is 2.14, so that would make the car's cost 3500 * 2.14 = 7490, which is under 7500. So he can afford it.

So for part a) (exchange rate is 2.20), he can't afford. So the correct option is the one where a) is 'He can't afford' and b) is exchange rate must be 2.14. Looking at the options, option I is that he can't afford and the exchange rate is 2.14.

Wait, but option I says exchange rate is £1 = $2.14. So if that's the case, then 'can't afford' is part a), and exchange rate is 2.14. So option I is the correct one.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The exchange rate given in the question is 2.20. So, when the exchange rate is 2.20, Mr. Morris can't afford the car because the car would cost 3500 * 2.20 = 7700, which is more than 7500.

So part a) is 'He can't afford the car.' So the options that have 'He can't afford' are A, F, I.

Now, for part b), the exchange rate must be such that 3500 pounds cost him less than or equal to 7500 dollars. So, exchange rate R must satisfy R = 7500 / 3500 ≈ 2.142857.

So the exchange rate must be at least approximately 2.142857. So, the exchange rate must be at least around 2.14. So, looking at the options, option I says exchange rate must be £1 = $2.14, which is correct.

So, the correct answer is option I: He can't afford the car, and the exchange rate must be £1 = $2.14.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the options again. The options are for each choice, a) whether he can afford and b) the exchange rate.

Wait, perhaps the options are:

A) He can't afford, exchange rate must be 1.50.

B) He can afford, exchange rate must be 1.80.

C) He can afford, exchange rate must be 2.50.

D) He can afford, exchange rate must be 1.60.

E) He can't afford, exchange rate must be 1.90.

F) He can't afford, exchange rate must be 3.00.

G) He can afford, exchange rate must be 2.40.

H) He can afford, exchange rate must be 2.00.

I) He can't afford, exchange rate must be 2.14.

J) He can't afford, exchange rate must be 2.00.

Wait, perhaps each option is a possible situation—like, Mr. Morris can afford the car only if the exchange rate is 1.50, etc. But that doesn't make sense because for a) and b) to be correct, the exchange rate needs to be 2.14.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are each a possible combination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that Mr. Morris can't afford the car at exchange rate 2.20, and the exchange rate must be at least 2.142857.

So, looking at the options, the correct one is I: He can't afford, exchange rate must be 2.14.

Wait, but in the options, I also have option F as 'He can't afford, exchange rate must be 3.00.' That would be incorrect because 3.00 would make the car cost 10500, which is way over.

Wait, no, wait, 3.00 is higher than 2.142857, so the car would cost more. So option I is correct.

So, the correct answer is option I.
</think>

Mr. Morris is quoted to purchase a car priced at £3500. He plans to spend no more than $7500. 

### Part a)
To determine if he can afford the car based on the given exchange rate of £1 = $2.20:
- The car's cost in dollars: \( 3500 \times 2.20 = 7700 \) dollars.
- Since 7700 > 7500, he **cannot afford the car** at £1 = $2.20.

### Part b)
To find the exchange rate at which he can afford the car:
- Set up the equation: \( 3500 \times R = 7500 \) dollars.
- Solving for R: \( R = \frac{7500}{3500} \approx 2.142857 \) dollars per pound.
- Thus, the exchange rate must be at least approximately £1 = $2.14.

### Answer
- For part a), he **cannot afford the car**.  
- For part b), the exchange rate must be **£1 = $2.14**.
