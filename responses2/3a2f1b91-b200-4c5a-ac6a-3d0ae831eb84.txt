Okay, so I need to figure out this question about ABC Corporation's income before taxes. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that ABC Corporation had a 1976 net income of $1,000,000 and pays 50% taxes. I need to find the income before taxes, right? Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that the net income is after taxes, so I should calculate the total before considering taxes.

Wait, wait. So if net income is after taxes, and they're paying 50% in taxes, that means the net income is half of the pre-tax income because 50% is taken as tax. Let me think: Let's say the pre-tax is X. Then tax is 50% of X, which is 0.5X. So the net income is X minus 0.5X, which equals 0.5X. Oh right, so net = 0.5 * pre-tax.

The net income here is $1,000,000. So 0.5 * pre-tax = $1,000,000. Therefore, pre-tax must be $2,000,000. Looking at the options, option C is $2,000,000. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure. Oh, wait, in 1976, was there a tax system where 50% is a flat tax? I think in many countries, especially in the US, the tax rates vary, but in 1976, maybe it was similar. Like, the corporate tax rate was around 25%, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should double-check because 50% seems a high rate. Oh wait, wait, the question says they pay 50% taxes. So that's a 50% rate. So the calculation I did earlier should still hold.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, in some tax systems, the tax is calculated after the income is taxed, but in this case, the question says they pay 50% taxes. So, yes, net is after taxes. So if net is 1/2 of pre-tax, then pre-tax is double the net. So $2 million. So the answer is C.

The question involves calculating the income before taxes given the net income and the tax rate. The net income is $1,000,000, and the tax rate is 50%. 

Since the net income is after taxes, and 50% is paid as tax, the net income represents half of the pre-tax income. Therefore, the pre-tax income is calculated as:

\[ \text{Pre-Tax Income} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{1 - \text{Tax Rate}} = \frac{1,000,000}{1 - 0.5} = \frac{1,000,000}{0.5} = 2,000,000 \]

Looking at the options, the correct answer is **C: $2,000,000**.
