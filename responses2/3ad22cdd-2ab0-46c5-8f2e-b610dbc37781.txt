Okay, so I have this problem about a ladder leaning against a building. Let me read it again. The ladder is 26 feet long, and its foot is moving away from the building at 3 feet per second. I need to find how fast the top of the ladder is moving down when the foot is 10 feet away. The options are given, so I should figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, this sounds like a related rates problem from calculus. I remember that for related rates, we use the chain rule because the variables are changing with respect to time.

So, let's think about the variables involved. Let’s call the distance from the foot of the ladder to the building as x(t), and the height of the top of the ladder on the building as y(t). Since the ladder's length is fixed at 26 feet, by Pythagoras, we have x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 = 26^2.

Wait, actually, I should write the equation correctly. It's x squared plus y squared equals the ladder squared, so x² + y² = 26². But 26 squared is 676, so x² + y² = 676.

Now, we can differentiate both sides with respect to time t to find the rates of change. The derivative of x² is 2x dx/dt, and the derivative of y² is 2y dy/dt. So, 2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0. Because the ladder's length isn't changing, the sum of the rates multiplied by their respective x and y should be zero.

Wait, but wait, the ladder's length is constant, so the sum of their derivatives should be zero. So, 2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0. Let me write this as 2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0. Or simplifying, x dx/dt + y dy/dt = 0.

Now, we can solve for dy/dt in terms of dx/dt. So, dy/dt = (-x dx/dt) / y. That makes sense because as x increases, y must decrease, so dy/dt should be negative.

We are given that dx/dt is 3 ft/s. But wait, at the moment when the foot is 10 feet from the building, we need to find dy/dt. So, I need to find the value of y at that moment.

Since x is 10 feet, plug into the Pythagorean theorem: x² + y² = 676 → 10² + y² = 676 → 100 + y² = 676 → y² = 576 → y = 24 feet. Because y is the height, it's positive.

So, y is 24 when x is 10. Now, plug x = 10, y =24, and dx/dt =3 into dy/dt = (-x dx/dt)/y.

So, that's (-10 * 3)/24. Let me compute that. 10*3 is 30, so negative 30 divided by 24. That simplifies to -30/24.

Wait, but the question says the top is moving down, so dy/dt is negative, which makes sense. But the problem asks for the rate at which it's moving down, so the magnitude is 30/24. Let's simplify that fraction.

30/24 can be reduced. Both are divisible by 6. 30 ÷6=5, 24 ÷6=4. So it becomes 5/4. So, the rate is 5/4 ft/s.

Looking at the options, option C is 5/4. So, the correct answer should be C.

The ladder forms a right triangle with the building and the ground. Using the Pythagorean theorem:

x² + y² = 26²  
x = 10 ft when we need to find dy/dt.  
So, y² = 26² - 10² = 676 - 100 = 576 ⇒ y = 24 ft.

Differentiating both sides with respect to time t:

2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0 ⇒ x dx/dt + y dy/dt = 0  
Solving for dy/dt: dy/dt = (-x dx/dt) / y.

Substituting the values at the moment x = 10 ft, dx/dt = 3 ft/s, and y = 24 ft:

dy/dt = (-10 * 3) / 24 = -30/24 = -5/4 ft/s.

Since dy/dt is negative, it indicates the top is moving downward at 5/4 ft/s.
