Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given names has never belonged to a Pope. The options are A to F, with the names Lucas, Leo, Linus, Lando, Lawrence, and Lucius. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that the Pope is typically named after the Italian word for "king of kings" or "prince of kings," which is "pope." So any name that doesn't fit that pattern might not have been a Pope. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Lucas. I'm pretty sure Lucas was the name of a pope. Oh right, John Paul II was Lucas. So Lucas is a valid Pope.

Option B: Leo. Leo was the name of a pope as well. Leo X is a well-known pope. So Leo is also a valid name.

Option C: Linus. Wait, Linus is a fictional character from the show "Milkman's Diner." I'm pretty sure Linus isn't a real person, let alone a Pope. So this one is definitely not the answer.

Option D: Lando. Lando isn't a real name I can think of as a pope. The only real name I remember is Lando X, but that's not a real pope either. So Lando isn't a valid name.

Option E: Lawrence. I'm pretty sure Lawrence was a nickname used by several Pope's. For example, Lawrence V. and Lawrence X. So Lawrence is a valid Pope.

Option F: Lucius. Lucius is the Latin name for "king of kings," and that's exactly the title of the Pope. So Lucius is a valid name.

So putting it all together, the names that are valid are A, B, E, F, but the options that aren't valid are C and D. Therefore, the question is asking which has never belonged to a Pope, so the answer must be either C or D.

Wait, let me double-check. I think Linus was a character from "Milkman's Diner," so definitely not a real name. Lando is not a real name either. So the names that have never belonged are C and D.

The correct answer is C: Linus, as it is not a real name of a Pope.
