Okay, so I have this question about antennas and their directivity. Let me try to figure it out. I remember that antenna directivity has something to do with how well it focuses radiation in a particular direction. The question says the directivity is 50, and the wavelength is 4 meters. They're asking for the maximum effective aperture.

Hmm, I think the formula for the effective aperture involves the directivity and the wavelength. Oh right, the formula is A = D * λ² / (4π), but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, sometimes I've seen it presented as A = (D * λ²) / (4π), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, maybe it's more like A = (D * λ²) / (4π), but let me make sure. Alternatively, another version I've heard is A = (D * (λ)^2) / (4π). Or wait, maybe the formula is A = (D * λ^2)/(4π), but I'm a bit confused. 

Wait, another approach. I remember that effective aperture is related to the radiation pattern. The formula for the effective aperture is A = (D * λ²) / (4π). Let me double-check. Oh wait, yes, the effective area is given by A = (D * λ²) / (4π). So D is the directivity, λ is the wavelength, and A is the effective area.

So plugging in the numbers: D is 50, λ is 4 meters. So A = (50 * (4)^2) / (4π). Wait, let's compute that. 4 squared is 16. Multiply by 50 gives 800. Then divide by 4π. What's 4π? Approximately 12.566. So 800 divided by 12.566. Let's calculate that. 800 ÷ 12.566. Let's see, 12.566 times 63 is about 800 (since 12.566 * 63 ≈ 800). So roughly 63.63, which rounds to about 63.6.

Looking at the options: option H is 63.6, option B is 50, option G is 80. So 63.6 is the correct one. So the answer should be H.

To determine the maximum effective aperture of an antenna with a directivity of 50 and a wavelength of 4 meters, we use the formula:

\[
A = \frac{D \cdot \lambda^2}{4\pi}
\]

Where:
- \( D = 50 \) (directivity),
- \( \lambda = 4 \) meters,
- \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \).

Plugging in the values:
\[
A = \frac{50 \cdot (4)^2}{4\pi} = \frac{50 \cdot 16}{12.566} \approx \frac{800}{12.566} \approx 63.6 \, \text{square meters}.
\]

The closest option is **63.6 meter²**, which corresponds to **option H**.

Answer: H
