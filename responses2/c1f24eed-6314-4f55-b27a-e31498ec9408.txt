Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Cavendish balance. Hmm, what do I remember about this? Oh right, it's a device used to measure gravitational forces between small and large masses, something like a scale of gravity. I think the basic idea is that you have a small sphere and a large one, and you measure the gravitational force between them.

The question gives the mass of the small sphere as 0.0100 kg, the large one as 0.500 kg, and the distance between their centers is 0.0500 meters. The gravitational force on each due to the other is X * 10^-10 N, and we're supposed to find X.

Wait, I remember the formula for gravitational force. Oh yeah, Newton's law of universal gravitation. The formula is F = G * (m1 * m2) / r², where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses, and r is the distance between them.

So first, I need to plug in the numbers. The gravitational constant G is about 6.674×10^-11 N(m/kg)². Let me write that down.

m1 is 0.0100 kg, m2 is 0.500 kg. The distance r is 0.0500 m.

Putting it all into the formula: F = (6.674e-11) * (0.0100 * 0.500) / (0.0500)^2.

Let me calculate step by step. First, multiply m1 and m2: 0.0100 * 0.500 is 0.005 kg².

Then, divide by r squared: (0.0500)^2 is 0.0025 m².

So the equation is F = (6.674e-11) * 0.005 / 0.0025.

Wait, 0.005 divided by 0.0025 is 2. So that part is 2.

So F = 6.674e-11 * 2.

6.674e-11 times 2 is 1.3348e-10 N.

Wait, the question says the force is X *10^-10 N. So X is 1.3348 approximately. Looking at the options, option B is 1.33, which would be the closest. But wait, the options are A to J, and B is 1.33.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Did I compute the division correctly? Oh yes, 0.005 / 0.0025 is 2, so that's right. And 6.674e-11 * 2 is 1.3348e-10. So X is 1.33, which matches option B. But wait, the options have some more points, like some might have more decimal places.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me compute it more accurately.

m1*m2 = 0.0100 * 0.500 = 0.005 kg².

r squared is (0.0500)^2 = 0.0025 m².

So the denominator is 0.0025.

So F = (6.674e-11) * (0.005) / 0.0025.

Wait, 0.005 / 0.0025 is 2. So 6.674e-11 * 2 = approximately 1.3348e-10.

So X is 1.3348. Looking at the options, the closest is B: 1.33. But wait, earlier I thought option G was 3.00, which is maybe a typo. So the answer should be B.

To solve the problem, we use Newton's law of gravitation:

\[
F = G \cdot \frac{m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
\]

where:
- \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \),
- \( m_1 = 0.0100 \, \text{kg} \),
- \( m_2 = 0.500 \, \text{kg} \),
- \( r = 0.0500 \, \text{m} \).

First, calculate \( m_1 \cdot m_2 \):
\[
m_1 \cdot m_2 = 0.0100 \cdot 0.500 = 0.005 \, \text{kg}^2.
\]

Next, calculate \( r^2 \):
\[
r^2 = (0.0500)^2 = 0.0025 \, \text{m}^2.
\]

Now, substitute these values into the formula:
\[
F = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \cdot \frac{0.005}{0.0025}.
\]

Simplify the division:
\[
\frac{0.005}{0.0025} = 2.
\]

Thus:
\[
F = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 2 = 1.3348 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{N}.
\]

The problem states the gravitational force is \( X \cdot 10^{-10} \, \text{N} \), so \( X = 1.3348 \). Among the options, the closest value is \( X = 1.33 \).
