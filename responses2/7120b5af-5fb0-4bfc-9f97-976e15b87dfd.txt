Question:

Devise an experiment which would distinguish between Decay and Interference theories of forgetting. What results would have to be obtained to support the Decay theory? To support the Interference theory?

Options:

A: Decay Theory is supported if the experimental group recalls significantly more than the control group, indicating that time strengthens memories. Interference Theory is supported if recall is unaffected by additional learning tasks.
B: Interference Theory is supported if the control group recalls more than the experimental group when a competing task is introduced immediately after learning, indicating that immediate interference affects recall.
C: Interference Theory is supported if both groups recall the same amount from learning task A
D: Decay Theory is supported if the recall is unaffected over time, while Interference Theory is supported if recall decreases with the introduction of a competing task shortly after learning.
E: Decay Theory is supported if the experimental group demonstrates improved recall with the introduction of a competing task, indicating that interference can actually enhance memory retention.
F: Decay Theory is supported if both groups recall the same amount from learning task A, proving that time fades memories. Interference Theory is supported if the experimental group recalls significantly less than the control group, indicating interference from other memories
G: Decay Theory is supported if the experimental group recalls significantly less than the control group
H: Decay Theory is supported if recall diminishes in the absence of any competing tasks over a long period, indicating that memories fade naturally over time. Interference Theory is supported if recall diminishes only when a competing task is introduced during the retention interval.
I: Both theories are supported if the control group recalls significantly less than the experimental group
J: Interference Theory is supported if both groups show improved recall over time, suggesting that memories consolidate rather than decay or interfere with each other.

Okay, so I need to figure out the right answer to this multiple-choice question about distinguishing between Decay and Interference theories of forgetting. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Decay theory suggests that forgetting follows an exponential decay model. That means each time you try to remember something, the strength of the memory decreases by a certain percentage. So, over time, the forgetting becomes less likely, and the memory fades away. The longer you wait, the easier it is to forget.

On the other hand, the Interference theory posits that prior learning can interfere with subsequent learning. So, if someone has already learned a lot of information, it might make it harder to remember new information. For example, if I learn a lot about a subject and then later study another subject, the interference would be that the new information is hard to remember because of the old ones.

The question is asking which experiment would distinguish between these two theories. The options involve what the results would support each theory.

Looking at the options, I need to find which setup would show consistent with Decay or Interference.

Option A says Decay is supported if the experimental group recalls more than the control, implying time strengthens memories. That doesn't make sense because Decay suggests time slows down memory strength. So A is likely wrong.

Option B suggests Interference is supported if, after a competing task, recall is lower. Wait, no. Option B says immediately after learning, the control group (which should be the experimental group) recalls more. Because in Decay theory, the same task should show decay over time. If they're the same group, that doesn't make sense. For Interference, if a competing task is introduced, maybe the group's recall is lower. But I'm not sure. Let me think more about the theories.

Wait, the options might be more about the outcomes when certain conditions are met. Let me parse each option.

Option B says: "Interference Theory is supported if the control group recalls more than the experimental group when a competing task is introduced immediately after learning." Hmm. If, after a learning task, the control group (the one that should be the experimental group, perhaps, or maybe the control group is the one not exposed to a competing task) shows higher recall, that would suggest interference. Because the control group didn't have a competing task, so should have better recall. So this would support Interference Theory. But according to Decay theory, the same group should have decayed. So B is checking for interference, but the theory is about decay. So B would support Interference, not Decay.

Option C: Interference is supported if both groups recall the same amount. That doesn't make sense because, under Decay, the same group should have more decay, so they would have lower recall. So if they're same, no decay, meaning same as before. So this would contradict Decay, supporting Interference. But that's not the case. So C seems to support Interference.

Option D: Decay is supported if recall is unaffected over time. That's the opposite of Decay. Because Decay suggests that time slows down the strength. So if the recall doesn't change, that's more like the opposite of Decay. So D would support Interference.

Option E: Decay is supported if the experimental group shows improved recall with a competing task. Wait, that suggests that the group's memory was enhanced when a competing task was added. But in Decay theory, the group's memory should fade, not improve. So this would support the opposite of Decay, meaning it's more like the opposite of what Decay predicts, so maybe supporting Interference.

Option F: Decay is supported if both groups recall the same amount, proving time fades. Wait, but for Decay, the same group should have less (faded) compared to before. If the same group's recall is same as before, that's not decay. So F would support Decay, which is the opposite of what Decay theory suggests. But the question is to support Decay, so this might not fit. So F says both groups recall same, which supports Decay. But that's not correct because Decay would predict decay. So I'm a bit confused here.

Option G: Decay is supported if experimental group recalls less. That fits Decay. Because if the same group's recall decreases over time, that's decay. So G says that. So G is a possible candidate.

Option H: Decay is supported if recall diminishes without a competing task. And Interference is supported if recall doesn't diminish when a competing task is introduced. Wait, so this is confusing. Let me read again.

Option H says: Decay theory is supported if recall doesn't change (no decay, same as before). Interference theory is supported if, when a competing task is introduced, the recall diminishes. That doesn't make sense. Because under Interference, the presence of a competing task should interfere, causing worse recall.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that directly corresponds to each theory's expectations.

Let me think about what each theory predicts about the experimental results.

For Decay Theory: Over time, forgetting decreases. So if the experimental group's recall is less than the control, over time suggests decay. So if the experimental group's recall is lower, that's decay.

For Interference Theory: The presence of a competing task, which might be a different learning task, interferes with the original task. So, if a new task is learned, and then the original task is learned again, the recall would be lower because of interference. Therefore, in an experiment where a competing task is presented, the original task's recall would decrease.

So to test the theories, in an experiment.

Let's say you have an experimental condition and a control condition. Or perhaps you have a single group that's tested with and without different conditions.

But the question is about an experiment that would distinguish between the two.

So perhaps the setup is: you have a group that's tested on Task A, and a control group that's tested on Task A without any additional conditions. Then, perhaps, you introduce a competing task (Task B) after a certain period, and see if the recall changes.

Wait, but I need to think about the options.

Wait, the user provided options but not the setup of the experiment. So perhaps I'm to infer what each option would do.

Wait, the question is about what results would support each theory. So, each option presents a scenario of the experimental group and control group, and what the results would mean.

So for example, option B says: "Interference theory is supported if the control group recalls more than the experimental group after a competing task is introduced immediately after learning." Wait, no. Wait, the wording is: "immediately after learning." So, if learning Task A, then immediately after, a competing task is introduced. The control group (could be the experimental group) is letting go of that competing task. So in the control group, they don't have the competing task, so their recall is higher. That would mean that interfering with the task makes the control group worse. So that supports Interference theory.

Wait, but according to the Decay theory, the same group should have less recall over time. So if the experimental group's recall is lower, that would support Decay.

So, option F says: "Decay theory is supported if both groups recall the same amount from learning task A. Prove that time fades memories." So, same as before, same as before. So that would support Decay, but according to Decay, the same group should have less. So option F would not likely support Decay.

Wait, but let me go back. Let me re-express each option's setup.

Option F: "Decay theory is supported if both groups show same recall, proving memory fades." That's not correct because, under Decay, the same group should have less. So that's not the case. So F would not support Decay.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about each option.

Option D: Decay theory is supported if the experimental group's recall is unaffected over time. That would mean that the same group's recall doesn't decrease, which would support Interference, because under Interference, the same group should have worse recall when a new task interferes.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

In the study of forgetting, the two theories predict different things. Decay suggests that each time you try to remember, the strength fades, so more repeated attempts lead to lower recall. Interference suggests that prior learning can interfere with the current task, so even if you try to remember a task, it's harder because you've learned something else before.

So in an experiment, you might test how participants remember a task (Task A). Then, you present them with a new task (Task B). 

If Decay is correct, then after a while, their Task A recall would fade, but Task B might have some effect. Or perhaps in the same group, the presence of Task B might interfere with Task A, making them forget it more easily.

Wait, but the question is about an experimental group and a control group. So perhaps the setup is:

- Experimental group: learns Task A, then Task B.

- Control group: learns Task A.

In this case, under Decay theory, the control group (only Task A) should have less recall because it's a single task. But wait, if the experimental group learns Task A and then Task B, perhaps the order matters. Alternatively, perhaps the control group doesn't learn Task B, so their memory of Task A is only affected by the initial learning, not by the new task.

Alternatively, perhaps the experiment is: 

- Both groups learn Task A, then the experimental group also learns Task B.

In this case, under Decay theory, the experimental group (with Task B) should have their Task A recall decrease over time, but Task B's recall might be unaffected or perhaps even increased, depending on the task.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the structure of the experiment. But perhaps the way to test the theories is different.

Let me think about each option again.

Looking for options that describe what each theory predicts.

Option D: Decay theory is supported if experimental group's recall is unaffected over time. That's not correct because under Decay, the same group's recall should decrease. So D would not support Decay.

Option F: Both groups recall same amount. So under Decay, the same group should have less. So F would not support Decay, supporting Interference.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about each option:

Option A: Decay theory is supported if experimental group has higher recall. No, because decay predicts lower. So A is wrong.

Option B: Interference theory is supported if control group has higher recall. That would mean the control group (no competing task) has better recall, so interference is not happening. So B supports Interference.

Option C: Interference theory is supported if both groups have same recall. That would support Decay, which is the opposite. So C is wrong.

Option D: Decay supported if group's recall is unaffected. So same as before, D is wrong.

Option E: Decay supported if experimental group's recall is improved with a competing task. That's more like the opposite, supporting Interference.

Option F: Decay supported if both groups have same recall. That's an incorrect setup because under Decay, same group should have less. So F would support Interference, but not Decay.

Option G: Decay supported if experimental group's recall is lower. That would support Decay.

Option H: Decay supported if recall doesn't change, which is not correct. So that supports Interference.

Option I: Both theories supported if control group has lower, which is not correct.

Option J: Interference supported if both groups have lower, which would be more like the opposite of Decay.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to match the options.

Which option would show that the experimental group's recall is lower than the control group, supporting Decay.

Looking for an option where the experimental group has lower recall.

Option G says: Decay is supported if experimental group's recall is lower. That would fit.

Option F says, "Decay theory is supported if both groups show same, proving memory fades." That's not correct, as under Decay, same group's recall should decrease, so F would not support Decay.

So, the correct option is G.

Wait, but wait, option F says that the control and experimental groups have same recall, which would support Decay. Because under Decay, same group's recall should decrease over time.

Wait, but the user provided F as an option. So, I need to see which options actually support each theory.

Wait, let me clarify:

The decay theory is that forgetting follows an exponential decay. So each time you try to remember, the strength fades. So, the same group's recall would decrease over time.

Interference theory is that prior learning interferes with current learning, leading to forgetting. So, when a new task is presented, the recall is lower.

So, in an experiment where you have an experimental group and a control group.

The setup could be: learn Task A, then a competing task is introduced. The control group doesn't have the competing task, so their recall is higher. The experimental group has the competing task.

If Decay theory is correct, then the experimental group's Task A recall would decrease over time. The control group's would remain higher, so they would have higher recall. So, in this case, the experimental group's recall would decrease, supporting Decay.

In the same setup, under Interference Theory, the experimental group's Task A recall would be lower than the control group's, because the new task interferes. So, in that case, the experimental group's recall is lower.

So, the question is which experiment would support Decay and which would support Interference.

So, for Decay, the experimental group's recall should be lower than the control group's over time. So, if the experimental group's recall decreases, that supports Decay.

Wait, but in this case, the control group's recall is higher, so that's not the same as the experimental group's.

Wait, perhaps the setup is that in the same group, the experimental group learns Task A and then Task B, and the control group just Task A. So, under Decay, the control group's Task A recall should be lower, but the experimental group's Task B might interfere.

But I'm getting into specifics that I'm not fully confident about.

Wait, perhaps the best way is to evaluate each option's proposed results.

Option G says, Decay is supported if experimental group's recall is lower. That would fit Decay.

Option F says, Decay is supported if both groups have same recall. That's not correct because under Decay, same group's recall would decrease, so same group's would be lower than before.

So, the correct options are those that describe the experimental group's recall being lower.

Looking again, the question is about which setup would support each theory.

So, let me think about each option.

Option F: "Decay theory is supported if both groups show improved recall over time, indicating that memories fade naturally over time." That's not correct for Decay because under Decay, same group's should decline, not improve.

Option G: "Decay is supported if experimental group's recall is lower than control group." Wait, no, perhaps the groups are the same. Hmm, no. Because in a single group, the experimental group's recall would be lower over time, while the control group's would remain higher.

Wait, perhaps in option F, the groups are different. Let me re-examine the options. Each option presents a scenario between the experimental group and a control group.

Wait, perhaps the options are: both groups are the same, and one group is the experimental. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup is: the experimental group is exposed to Task A and then Task B, while the control group is exposed only to Task A. In this case, under Decay, the control group's Task A should have lower recall than the experimental group's (if Task B is interfering). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a single group that's tested at two time points.

Wait, to avoid getting stuck, let's think about each option and what would happen.

Option F: Both groups show same recall, proving memory fades. That can't be because under Decay, same group would have lower. So F doesn't support Decay.

Option G: Experimental group has lower recall, supporting Decay.

Option H: Both groups have lower, but that's not correct.

So, the only option that would support Decay is G: "Decay is supported if the experimental group's recall is lower than the control group."

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is F, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of each option's outcome.

Option A: Experimental group's recall higher: no, decay suggests lower.

Option B: Control group higher after competing task. That would mean interference is happening, but the theory says decay, so B supports interference.

Option C: Groups same: that suggests no decay, supporting interference.

Option D: Experimental group's recall unaffected: that's wrong because decay would lower.

Option E: Experimental group's recall improves: that suggests enhancing, not decay.

Option F: Both groups same: decay suggests they should have lower, so same is wrong.

Option G: Experimental group's recall lower: correct for decay.

Option H: Both groups lower but no decay: no, because same group would have lower.

So, the only option that directly aligns with the decay theory is option G.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think again. So, the setup is that the experimental group learns a task, then a new task is introduced, which interferes. So, the experimental group's recall would be lower because of interference. That supports Interference.

In an experiment where the same group is tested with and without a competing task, and if the experimental group's recall drops over time (decay theory), then the control group would have higher recall.

So, an experiment that shows that the experimental group's recall is lower doesn't directly answer the question, but perhaps the correct option is F, which says both groups show same, so memory fades.

Wait, no. Option F says that both groups show same, proving memory fades. That's not correct, because under Decay, same group would have lower. So F would support Interference, as the groups don't show decay.

Wait, I think I came back to the same confusion. Let me try to think about which options are about an experiment that would support each theory.

Option F: Both groups show same, so memory fades. That would support the opposite of Decay, which is not what the question is about. So F wouldn't support Decay.

Option G: Experimental group's recall is lower, which supports Decay.

Option H: Both groups lower, which is not correct for Decay.

So the correct answer is G.
</think>

To distinguish between Decay and Interference theories of forgetting, we analyzed each option based on the expected outcomes of each theory. The goal was to determine which experiment would support each theory.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A**: Suggests Decay is supported if the experimental group has higher recall. This contradicts the theory, so **not correct**.

2. **Option B**: Proposes Decay is supported if the control group has higher recall after a competing task. This aligns with the theory of Interference, where the control group (without interference) retains higher recall. **Does not support Decay**.

3. **Option C**: States Decay is supported if both groups have the same recall, proving memory fades. This contradicts the theory, as under Decay, the same group should have lower recall. **Does not support Decay**.

4. **Option D**: Suggests Decay is supported if the experimental group's recall is unaffected over time. This contradicts the theory, as under Decay, the same group should have lower recall. **Does not support Decay**.

5. **Option E**: Indicates Decay is supported if the experimental group's recall improves with a competing task. This contradicts the theory, as under Decay, the experimental group's recall should decrease. **Does not support Decay**.

6. **Option F**: Proposes Decay is supported if both groups have the same recall, proving memory fades. This contradicts the theory, as under Decay, the same group should have lower recall. **Does not support Decay**.

7. **Option G**: States Decay is supported if the experimental group's recall is lower than the control group. This aligns with the theory of Decay, as the same group's recall would decrease over time. **Supports Decay**.

8. **Option H**: Suggests Interference is supported if both groups have lower recall. This contradicts the theory, as under Interference, the control group (without interference) should retain higher recall. **Does not support Interference**.

### Conclusion:
The correct option is **G**, as it directly supports the Decay theory by indicating that the experimental group's recall decreases over time, which aligns with the theory that forgetting follows an exponential decay pattern.
