Okay, so I need to find the units digit of 7^25. Hmm, units digits usually cycle in a pattern, so maybe I can find the cycle length and then see where 25 falls in that cycle. Let me think about the powers of 7.

I remember that the units digit of powers often repeats every few exponents. Let's list them out to see the pattern.

7^1 is 7, so units digit is 7.
7^2 is 49, so units digit is 9.
7^3 would be 7*9 = 63, so units digit is 3.
7^4 is 7*3=21, so units digit is 1.
7^5 would be 7*1=7, so units digit cycles back to 7.

Wait, so the pattern is 7, 9, 3, 1, and then repeats every 4 exponents. So the cycle length is 4. That means the units digits cycle every 4 powers.

Now, I need to find where 25 is in this cycle. Since the cycle repeats every 4, I can divide 25 by 4 to find the remainder. 25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1. So the first position in the cycle would be 7^1.

Looking back, the first position in the cycle (remainder 1) is 7. So the units digit of 7^25 should be 7.

Wait, let me double-check. 7^1 is 7, 7^2 is 9, 7^3 is 3, 7^4 is 1, 7^5 is 7 again. So the cycle is 7,9,3,1, and repeats.

So 25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1. So 7^(4k +1) would have the same units digit as 7^1, which is 7. So the units digit is 7, which is option G.

The units digit of 7^25 follows a repeating cycle of 7, 9, 3, 1 every four exponents. Since 25 mod 4 is 1, the units digit is the first in the cycle, which is **7**.

Answer: G
