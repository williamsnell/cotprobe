Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this coupon question. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The question is asking which type of coupon is included in a package for later purchase. The options are A through J, each with a different kind of coupon.

I remember that coupons can be various types. Let me think about each option. 

Option A: an in-store coupon. That's when you apply the coupon at the time of purchase, usually in stores like stores or online. So you can use it at the store, but it's not a package for later purchase. So maybe that's not the right one.

Option B: a rebate coupon. rebate is when you get a discount for doing something, like applying for a refund or bonus. rebate coupons are often used for small purchases, but they're typically given for immediate use, not part of a package for later purchase. Hmm, maybe not the answer.

Option C: a discount coupon. This one is for when you buy something and get a discount. For example, buy one, get one free. These are usually available online, maybe at stores, and you can redeem them for cash when you're ready. So this sounds like it fits the description.

Option D: a mail-in coupon. That's when you send a form to the mail, and the company stamps it or sends it back. mail-in coupons are usually for things like coupons for services, like travel or medical. They might be used for later purchase, but I'm not sure if they're part of a package. Or maybe they're standalone. I need to think more about this.

Option E: a digital coupon. This could be a coupon that's sent via email, like a digital version of a physical coupon. These are often used now for online shopping, like certain electronics or clothing. They are processed through email and not typically handed in physically. So they might be part of a package for later purchase, but I'm not certain.

Option F: a promotional coupon. Promotional coupons are used for events, sales, or special offers. They might be used for later purchase if the offer is ongoing, but they can also be used for immediate purchases. But the question is about being part of a package for later purchase, which might mean they're set up to be redeemable when the offer ends.

Wait, the question is about coupons included in a package for later purchase. So the package is meant to be used after purchase, not immediately. So which coupons are part of a package that gets used after purchase?

Option C: discount coupon. That's often given to customers when they make a purchase, like buying two items and getting a discount. So these can be used later when the customer is ready to cash them out.

Option F: promotional coupons are often used for events, and if the promotion ends, the coupons can be used later. So maybe that's included in a package for later purchase.

Option H: a peel-off coupon. Wait, I think peel-off coupons are when you can take the coupon off the package and use it later. For example, if you're redeeming a coupon for a service, you might use it when you're ready. So that's included in a package for later purchase.

Option I: an instant-redemption coupon. This is when you can use the coupon immediately, like a discount that's automatically applied when you make the purchase. So it's included in the package for later purchase.

Option J: a free-standing coupon. These aren't attached to anything else; you just use them when you're ready. So they can be part of a package for later purchase.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about which is included in a package for later purchase. So the options that are meant to be used after purchase.

Option C: discount coupon. Yes, as in buy one, get one free. So this is a common package that's meant to be used later.

Option H: peel-off coupon. That's a type where you can take it off and use it later, like in some electronics promotions.

Option I: instant redemption. This is when the coupon is applied immediately, like using a discount that's automatically applied during checkout.

So now I'm a bit confused because multiple options could fit. Let me check the definitions.

In-store coupons are used at the time of purchase. So they're for immediate redemption. So they're not part of a package for later purchase.

Rebate coupons are given for immediate use, so they're for when you do something and get a discount, not for later purchase.

Mail-in coupons are used when you send a form, but they're often used for later purchase if they're part of a package.

Digital coupons are sent via email, so they might be part of a package meant for later purchase.

Promotional coupons are for events; they can be used for later purchase if the promotion ends.

Peel-off coupons are used after purchase, taking the coupon off the package and using it later.

Instant-redemption coupons are applied immediately, like when using a coupon that's automatically applied.

So the question is about including in a package for later purchase, meaning the coupon is meant to be used after you make the purchase.

So the options that fit this are:

C: discount coupon (used after purchase)
H: peel-off coupon (used after purchase)
I: instant-redemption coupon (used after purchase)

Wait, but the options are in the list, so which one is correct.

Wait, let me see the options again.

Option C: discount coupon. So they're used in a package where you can redeem them later.

Option H: peel-off coupon. These are often used in packages where you can take them off and use later.

Option I: instant redemption. So they're used later.

But the question is about which is the name for a coupon included in a package for later purchase.

I think the answer intended is "C: a discount coupon." Because discount coupons are typically part of a package that is redeemable later. 

Wait, but some packages might have both, like in-store and mail-in, but the question is about a single type. So, for later purchase, a discount coupon is a package that's meant for later.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is "C: a discount coupon." Because the others are more about the method of use rather than being part of a package.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is "I: an instant-redemption coupon." Because those are meant for later purchase. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question says "included in a package for later purchase." So the package is meant to be used after purchase. So the coupons included in that package are for later.

So, which types of coupons are part of a package meant for later purchase.

In that case, the answer might be "C: a discount coupon." But I'm not 100% certain.

Alternatively, "I: an instant-redemption coupon." Because they're meant for later purchase.

Wait, the options are:

C: discount coupon

I: instant-redemption coupon

So both could be part of a package for later purchase.

Wait, but the question is from a set of options, so the correct answer is likely one of them. Based on my previous knowledge, I think that a discount coupon is a package that's meant for later purchase. So the answer is C.

The correct answer is C: a discount coupon. Discount coupons are typically part of a package meant for later purchase, as they are often used after the purchase is made. They can be applied immediately or later, depending on the package.
