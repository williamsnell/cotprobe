Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the chi-squared (χ²) test. I need to figure out which statements are true. Let's break it down step by step.

The question gives three statements, I, II, and III. So, I'll go through each one and assess its validity.

First, let's look at statement I: "In order to use a χ² procedure, the expected value for each cell of a one- or two-way table must be at least 5." Hmm, I remember that the chi-squared test usually requires a minimum expected frequency in each cell. I think the rule is that each cell's expected count should be 5 or more. So, I think statement I is correct.

Next, statement II: "In order to use χ² procedures, you must have at least 2 degrees of freedom." Degrees of freedom (df) in a chi-squared test depend on the number of rows and columns in the table. The formula is df = (r-1)(c-1), where r is rows and c is columns. For example, a 2x2 table has 1 df. Wait, but 1 is less than 2. So, can you use chi-squared when df is 1? I think yes, but the rule says you need at least 2 df. So statement II is incorrect because you can use it when df is 1, but it's not required to have at least 2.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no—the rule is that the chi-squared test can be used even with df less than 2, but whether it's recommended or not. Some sources say that the expected counts must be at least 5, but the degrees of freedom can be less than 2 as long as the test is conducted. So, statement II says you must have at least 2 df, which is not correct. So II is false.

Wait, let me double-check. Because in some cases, people use chi-squared even with low degrees of freedom. For example, if there are 100 cells and 1 degree of freedom, the test might still be used. Or maybe the rule is that you must have at least 5 expected counts, regardless of the degrees of freedom. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Oh wait, the rule about expected counts being at least 5 is more strict. So statement I is correct, and statement II is incorrect.

Wait, but statement II says "must have at least 2 degrees of freedom." So if you have 1 df, it's not required. So statement II is false.

Now, statement III: "In a 4 × 2 two-way table, the number of degrees of freedom is 3." Let's calculate df for a 4x2 table. Using the formula (r-1)(c-1) = (4-1)(2-1) = 3*1=3. So yes, the degrees of freedom are 3. So statement III is correct.

So putting it all together: I is correct, II is incorrect, III is correct. Which options include I and III? Let's look at the options:

Option C: I and III only. So that's the correct choice.

To determine which statements are true, let's analyze each one:

1. **Statement I**: The expected value for each cell in a chi-squared test must be at least 5. This is correct because the chi-squared test requires that each cell's expected frequency meets or exceeds 5 to ensure the test's validity.

2. **Statement II**: The chi-squared procedure requires at least 2 degrees of freedom. This is incorrect because the degrees of freedom (df) depend on the table's dimensions. For a 4 × 2 table, df = (4-1)(2-1) = 3, which is less than 2. Thus, the statement is false.

3. **Statement III**: In a 4 × 2 table, the degrees of freedom are 3. This is correct as calculated by (4-1)(2-1) = 3.

Based on this analysis, statements I and III are correct. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: I and III only.**
