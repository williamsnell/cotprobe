Question:

A widow owned an apartment building. Several years ago, a student, in a signed writing, entered a three-year lease agreement with the widow. The student agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the widow's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the student had continued to pay his rent, and the widow continued to accept it. If the widow had chosen to evict the student immediately upon the end of the three-year period, and before she had accepted the next rent check, the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction, if true, would have been that

Options:

A: the student had a right to stay as he had been residing there for more than three years.
B: the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a term of years.
C: the student had made improvements to the property, thus extending the leasehold.
D: the student had a verbal agreement with the widow to extend the lease.
E: the terms of the leasehold contract were binding on both parties.
F: the widow had accepted rent for the following month before the three-year period ended.
G: the student was protected from eviction due to his status as a student.
H: the widow had not clearly communicated the end of the lease term.
I: the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a periodic tenancy.
J: the leasehold contract was void ab initio.

Okay, so I have this question about property law, specifically regarding unexpired leases and eviction. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The scenario is this: A widow owns an apartment. A student signed a three-year lease, paying $800 monthly for the third-floor apartment. Now, the term has expired, but the student is still paying. The widow is considering evicting him upon the end of the lease term. But before she does, the student is asking for the strongest argument.

Let me first recall what I know about unexpired leases and eviction.

Unexpired leases: When the term ends, sometimes the tenant can choose to evict without any notice. The standard rule is that a tenant can opt out of a lease that has already expired. But there are exceptions, especially if the lease is a periodic tenancy.

Periodic tenancy vs. fixed term. A fixed term lease has a set end date, which is usually a fixed number of years. A periodic tenancy, like a lease that automatically ends after a certain number of years (like a tenancy in common), doesn't have a fixed end date. So, for example, a lease that ends after 3 years but with possibility of renewal.

If the lease is a periodic tenancy, the tenant has the right to terminate at any time without notice. But if it's a fixed term, the tenant can't do that unless the lease includes a termination clause.

In this question, the lease is three years long, so it's fixed-term. So the student can't evict him without prior notice. Unless there's a specific reason, like the student has a prior right to stay.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: "the student had a right to stay as he had been residing there for more than three years." That's about the right to remain. Some properties allow students to stay without eviction if they've lived there for a certain period. But the question is about the strongest argument, so this might be a possible point, but I'm not sure if it's the strongest.

Option B: widow didn't give the student requisitenotice. Requiring notice is about whether the tenant can evict. If the tenant has been paying without notice, they might argue the notice wasn't given. But the question is about the strongest argument, not about whether notice was given.

Option C: student made improvements. That might tie into the lease. If the lease had an extension clause, the student could have extended it. But the question is about eviction, not the lease terms.

Option D: verbal agreement to extend. If the lease had a clause allowing extension, the tenant could argue that. But again, the issue is about the strongest argument.

Option E: terms were binding. That's about the contract's validity. If the terms were binding, perhaps eviction could occur. But it's not about the student's argument for eviction; it's about the tenant's rights.

Option F: widow accepted rent for the next month before the term ends. That's about the lease being ongoing, but would that affect eviction? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the strongest argument.

Option G: status as a student. So, perhaps as a student, having a student status gives protection. Some laws allow students to be evicted if they can no longer work or live. That's a common argument. So the student's strongest argument might be that he's a student and thus protected.

Option H: terms were void. If the terms weren't binding, eviction might happen, but that's about the contract's validity, not the student's rights.

Option I: widow didn't give notice. So, the tenant can argue that they failed to provide notice before eviction. That's a strong argument, but the question is about why the student's strongest argument would be true.

Option J: lease was void. If the lease was void, eviction could happen, but that's a broader issue.

So considering the options, the student's strongest argument would probably be G: the student was protected from eviction due to his status as a student. Because as a student, he can be evicted under certain conditions, like when he can't work or lives without rent, which seems to fit the scenario given.

The options are about the strongest argument. So I think G is the correct answer.

The student's strongest argument to prevent eviction, if true, would be that he was protected from eviction due to his status as a student. As a student, this status gives him a right to evict him when he can no longer work or lives without rent. 

Answer: G
