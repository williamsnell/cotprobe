Okay, so I need to find the GDP per capita in the United States in 1950 when adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices. Wait, I'm a bit confused about what exactly that means. Let me think through this step by step.

First, GDP per capita is the GDP of a country per person. So in 1950, that would be the total GDP of the US in that year divided by the population. But the question is about adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what PPP stands for. I think it stands for Purchasing Power Parity, which adjusts for changes in the price levels of goods and services over time.

So the idea is to take the nominal GDP per capita in 1950 and adjust it to PPP 2011. That way, we're comparing apples to apples by adjusting for inflation. So the process would involve taking the 1950 GDP per capita, finding the inflation rate from 1950 to 2011, and then converting that value to 2011 prices.

Wait, but how do I calculate that? I think you need to use a price index to convert. For example, if the inflation rate from 1950 to 2011 is, say, 100%, you'd adjust the 1950 GDP per capita accordingly. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact method.

Alternatively, maybe I remember that PPP rates are based on the exchange rate of 2011 relative to 1950. So the formula would be something like: Adjusted GDP per capita = (1950 GDP per capita) * (PPP rate for 2011 / PPP rate for 1950). 

I think the PPP rate in 1950 compared to 2011 was around 8.3% or something like that. Wait, no, I think the PPP rate between 1950 and 2011 is about 8%. Let me think more accurately. I recall that in the mid-1950s, the US dollar was weaker, so PPP rates were lower. But specific numbers might be tricky in my head. Maybe I can think of the formula differently.

Wait, I might be overcomplicating this. Perhaps I should look up the actual 1950 GDP per capita and then apply the PPP conversion. But since I don't have that exact figure, maybe I can recall approximate values.

I remember that in the 1950s, the US had a GDP of around $3 billion. The population was about 150 million. So GDP per capita in 1950 would be $3 billion divided by 150 million people. Let me do the math: 3,000 / 150 = 20. So in 1950, the GDP per capita was about $20,000.

Wait, but that's nominal GDP per capita. The question asks for the adjusted figure in 2011 prices, so I need to adjust that. So I need to find the inflation rate from 1950 to 2011 and apply that to the 1950 GDP per capita.

I think the inflation rate from 1950 to 2011 was about 8.3%. So applying that, the adjusted GDP per capita would be $20,000 multiplied by (1 + 0.083) = 1.083, so approximately 20,000 * 1.083 ≈ $21,660. That's around $22k.

Looking at the options provided:

A: About $30k

B: About $3k

C: About $10k

D: About $20k

E: About $40k

F: About $8k

G: About $50k

H: About $5k

I: About $25k

J: About $15k

So the closest would be option D, $20k, but wait, our calculation came to about $22k, which is close to $20k. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact PPP conversion.

Wait, maybe I got the inflation rate wrong. Let me think again. I think the PPP rate between 1950 and 2011 is approximately 8.3%. So using that, $20k (1950) would increase by 8.3% to $21,660, which is roughly $22k. But none of the options have $22k. The closest is D ($20k) and I ($25k). Alternatively, maybe I should double-check the initial GDP per capita.

Wait, another way to think: 1950 GDP per capita could be different. Let me try another approach. I think the 1950 nominal GDP per capita was about $3,000 for the US in 1950. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think: 1950 was before the introduction of the Current Cost of Living Index, so the US was smaller and the dollar was weaker. Let me get more precise.

In 1950, the US population was about 250 million. The nominal GDP was around $3 billion. So $3,000 million divided by 250 million people: 3,000 / 250 = 12. So $12,000 per capita in 1950. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Hmm, maybe I mixed up the numbers.

Wait, perhaps in 1950, the GDP was around $3 billion, and the population was about 250 million. Wait, but 250 million is 0.25 billion, so 3 / 0.25 = 12. So in 1950, the GDP per capita was $12,000.

But that conflicts with what I thought earlier. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the 1950 GDP was around $3.3 billion, making it $13.2 per capita for a population of 250 million. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should rely on a more accurate source.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach. I think the real GDP in 1950 (adjusted for inflation) is around $3.3 billion. So if I adjust that to 2011 PPP, perhaps it would be lower. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I've heard that in 1950, the real GDP was about $3.3 billion. So in 1950, the GDP per capita would be around $13,200 (3.3 billion divided by 250 million). But again, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, if the 1950 GDP per capita was $12,000, then applying an inflation rate of 8.3%, the 2011 PPP would be 12,000 * 1.083 ≈ 13,000. That's approximately $13k. Hmm, looking at the options, E is $40k, F is $8k, etc. So 13k is closer to F ($8k) or I ($25k). Not sure.

Wait, perhaps my initial GDP per capita in 1950 was incorrect. Let me try another approach. I found that the 1950 U.S. real GDP was about $3.3 billion. So a population of about 250 million (250 million people or 0.25 billion), so 3.3 / 0.25 = 13.2, so $13,200 per capita. 

So in 2011, adjusting for 2011 PPP, what would that be? The inflation rate from 1950 to 2011 is approximately 8.3%. So 13,200 * 1.083 ≈ 14,270. So about $14,300.

Looking at the options, the closest is F ($8k) and I ($25k). Hmm, that's not matching. Did I make a mistake in the initial GDP per capita?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the real GDP in 1950 compared to 2011. The real GDP in 1950 was around $3.3 billion, and in 2011, the real GDP was about $8,000 billion (since the US economy grew from around $1 billion in 1950 to over $800 billion by 2011). So if I adjust the 1950 GDP per capita to 2011 PPP, it would be 3.3 / 800 ≈ 0.004125, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing nominal and real GDP. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that PPP 2011 is about the 1950 GDP adjusted for inflation.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact value, but since I can't, I'll have to proceed with what I think is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: About $20k. Because I remember that in 1950, the US was growing rapidly, and the PPP in 2011 would adjust that growth into a higher figure. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, another approach: The US GDP in 1950 was $3 billion, and population was 250 million. So $12,000. If that's adjusted to 2011 PPP, which is about 8.3% higher, so $12,000 * 1.083 ≈ $13,000. So closest to $13k, which is about $10k? Hmm, but none of the options match. Wait, perhaps the 1950 GDP per capita was $3,000, leading to $3,000 * 1.083 ≈ $3,250. But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the 1950's GDP per capita. I think it was around $13,000. So 13k adjusted by 8.3% gives about $14,270. That's closer to $15k, which is option J. But that's a big jump.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the population in 1950. If the population was 250 million, then 3,300,000,000 divided by 250 million is 13.2, so $13,200.

Wait, I'm getting stuck in circles. Maybe I should try to think of the correct answer from the options. Since the options are A to J, with D being $20k, and I being $25k.

I think the correct answer is D: About $20k. Because earlier I thought the 1950 GDP per capita was about $12k, which after adjustment to 2011 would be approximately $13k, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps in 1950, the GDP per capita was higher. Wait, perhaps I should recall that in the mid-1950s, the US was growing rapidly, so the nominal GDP per capita was around $30k in 1950. Wait, but that can't be right because population would be higher.

Wait, let's do the math again. If in 1950, the US population was about 250 million (0.25 billion) and the GDP was about $3.3 billion, then GDP per capita is 3.3 / 0.25 = 13.2, so $13,200.

Now, applying the 2011 PPP rate of 8.3%, the adjusted value would be 13,200 * 1.083 = 14,270. So around $14k. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: About $20k. Because maybe the 1950 figure was higher. Alternatively, perhaps I have the wrong number for 1950 GDP per capita.

Another approach: I've heard that in 1950, the US had a per capita real GDP of about $13k. Then, applying the 2011 PPP rate of around 8.3%, it would be about $14k, so closest to $15k. But that's option J.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the answer being $20k. Maybe I should look for a figure where, when adjusted, it's about $20k. So if the original 1950 GDP per capita was $20k, and adjusted by 8.3%, it's 20k*1.083≈21.66k, which is closer to $20k? No, 21.66k is about $22k, which is closer to $20k (only 2k difference) than to $25k (4.6k difference). So if the adjusted value is around $22k, but the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is D: $20k.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: About $20k, as I thought earlier.

Wait, but in 1950, I thought the GDP per capita was around $13k. So if that's adjusted to 2011, it's $14k, which is closer to $10k or $20k. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: About $20k. I think that's the most reasonable option given the options and the calculations I've done.

To determine the GDP per capita in the United States in 1950 adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the 1950 GDP per capita**: The 1950 U.S. nominal GDP was approximately $3.3 billion, and the population was around 250 million. Thus, the GDP per capita in 1950 was $3.3 / 0.25 = $13.2 per capita.

2. **Adjust for inflation**: The inflation rate from 1950 to 2011 is approximately 8.3%. Applying this adjustment, the 1950 GDP per capita is multiplied by (1 + 0.083) = 1.083.

3. **Calculate the adjusted GDP per capita**: $13.2 * 1.083 ≈ $14,270. This is approximately $14,300.

4. **Compare with options**: The closest option to $14,300 is $20k (Option D).

Thus, the adjusted GDP per capita in 1950 in 2011 PPP prices is closest to $20k.
