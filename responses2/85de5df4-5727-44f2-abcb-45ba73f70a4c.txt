Okay, so I have this accounting question here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about retained earnings and how they change when the reserve for contingencies increases. The given data includes some numbers, and I need to determine the correct change in retained earnings after the reserve for contingencies increases by $10,000.

Let me look at the data provided. The statement says:

Retained Earnings: Reserved for contingencies $25,000. Reserved for plant expansion $20,000. Total reserves $45,000. Free retained earnings $50,000. Total retained earnings $95,000.

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me check the values. The first line is "Retained Earnings: Reserved for contingencies $25,000 Reserved for plant expansion $20,000 Total reserves $45,000." Hmm, that's the total reserves, not the free retained earnings. Free retained earnings is the part of retained earnings not tied up in contingencies and plant expansion. Then it says "Free retained earnings $50,000 Total retained earnings $95,000."

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the total reserves are $45k, and the free retained earnings are $50k, that would exceed the total reserves, which seems impossible. Maybe I read the data wrong. Let me re-examine.

Oh wait, maybe "Total retained earnings" is the sum of all retained earnings, which includes free and retained. Hmm, that can't be right. Let me think. Normally, retained earnings are divided into two parts: free retained earnings and retained in retained earnings. So, perhaps the data given is that the free retained earnings are $50k and total retained earnings are $95k. But that can't be because the free would be part of it and the total can't exceed the reserves.

Wait, perhaps the data is correct. So, the total reserves are $45k, which is the sum of the two reserves: contingencies and plant. The free retained earnings are $50k, which are the retained earnings not allocated to contingencies or plant. Then the total retained earnings would be the sum of free and retained, which would be $50k + retained in retained earnings. But the given total is $95k. That doesn't fit. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the data is that the free retained earnings are $50k, and the total retained earnings are $95k. So, total retained earnings is the sum of free and retained, so 50 + R = 95 → R = 45. But the reserves are $45k. So, that matches. So, the free retained earnings are $50k, and the retained in retained earnings is $45k. So, the total retained earnings is $95k, and the total reserves are $45k.

Wait, but the total reserves are the sum of the two contingencies and plant. So, if the free retained earnings are $50k, but the total is $95k, which is higher than the total reserves, that can't be. Hmm, maybe I need to get this straight.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to understand that the free retained earnings are the retained earnings that are not tied up in contingencies or plant. So, the total retained earnings = free retained + retained in retained. So, in the given data, free is $50k, total is $95k, so retained in retained would be $45k. But the total reserves are $45k as well. So, that part makes sense.

So, if the reserve for contingencies increases by $10,000, how does that affect the free retained earnings? Let me think about the accounting equation. The reserves are a liability, and the retained earnings are part of equity. When a company increases its reserve for contingencies, it's using retained earnings, which affects the retained earnings figure.

Wait, the free retained earnings are the portion not tied up in contingencies. So, if the company uses some of its retained earnings to increase the contingencies reserve, that would increase the total reserves and free retained earnings. But wait, the free retained earnings are part of the total retained earnings. So, perhaps the free retained earnings remain the same, but the total retained earnings increases.

Wait, no. Because if the company uses retained earnings to increase the contingencies reserve, then the free retained earnings would remain the same because it's part of the total retained earnings. Or perhaps the free retained earnings are fixed, and any increase in the contingencies reserve affects the total retained earnings.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think in terms of the accounting equation.

The accounting equation is: Assets = Liabilities + Equity.

Equity consists of retained earnings and other equity. So, when a company increases one part of retained earnings, it's affecting the equity, which comes from retained earnings.

Wait, but the question is about the change in free retained earnings. So, if the reserve for contingencies increases, that would mean the company is taking more from retained earnings to cover that reserve. So, the free retained earnings would decrease, because the company is no longer retaining as much.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the company has a reserve of $25k for contingencies. If it increases this reserve by $10k, it needs to use some of its retained earnings. So, the free retained earnings would decrease by $10k because the company is now using retained earnings to cover the increase in the contingencies reserve.

But wait, let me think about the numbers. The original free retained earnings are $50k, total retained is $95k. The total reserves are $45k. So, when the contingencies reserve increases by $10k, that would require the company to use $10k from retained earnings. So, the free retained earnings would decrease by $10k to $40k. Then, the total retained earnings would be $95k - $10k (used for contingencies) = $85k. But according to the data, the total retained earnings are $95k, which suggests that the increase in the contingencies reserve is not affecting the total retained earnings, but that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the concept. The contingency reserve is a liability that represents potential obligations if certain events occur. The company can choose to retain the excess from retained earnings to cover the contingency reserve or to use it as a reserve. If the contingency reserve increases, the company must either keep more from retained earnings or it would have to adjust its reserve.

But wait, the question is about the effect on free retained earnings. Free retained earnings are the part of retained earnings that's not tied up in the contingency reserve. So, if the contingency reserve increases, the company is using retained earnings to cover that. So, the free retained earnings would decrease by the amount used to increase the reserve.

Wait, but in the data, the free retained earnings are $50k, and total retained is $95k. Total reserves are $45k. So, in the scenario, the contingency reserve increases by $10k. Wait, but the total reserves are already $45k, so perhaps the company is increasing the contingency reserve beyond the total reserves? No, that can't be. The total reserves are the sum of contingencies and plant. So, if the company increases the contingencies reserve, it's only possible if the plant reserve is adjusted as well. But that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach it step by step.

Original numbers:

- Contingencies reserve: $25k
- Plant: $20k
- Total reserves: $45k
- Free retained earnings: $50k
- Total retained earnings: $95k

If the contingencies reserve increases by $10k, making it $35k. But the total reserves are $45k, which is the sum of contingencies and plant. So, the plant reserve can't be increased beyond $20k unless it's adjusted.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the total reserves are fixed—so if the contingencies reserve increases, the plant reserve must decrease by the same amount. But in this question, the plant reserve is $20k, so if the contingencies increase by $10k, the plant reserve must decrease by $10k to keep the total reserves at $45k.

But the question only talks about the contingencies reserve increasing by $10k. So, the plant reserve drops by $10k, so the total reserves remain at $45k.

Now, how does this affect free retained earnings?

The free retained earnings are the retained earnings not tied up in the contingency reserve. So, if the contingencies reserve increases, the company is using more retained earnings for that, which reduces the free retained earnings.

Wait, but in the original scenario, the free retained earnings are $50k. If the company uses more retained earnings (specifically, the contingencies reserve) to cover the increase, the free retained earnings would decrease by the amount used.

Wait, but the question is only about the change in the free retained earnings. The question doesn't mention using retained earnings for plant expansion. So, perhaps the plant reserve isn't affected. So, the plant reserve remains at $20k. So, the total reserves remain at $45k.

So, when the contingencies increase by $10k, the plant can't increase, so the plant reserve remains at $20k. Therefore, the total reserves remain at $45k.

But the company is increasing the contingencies reserve by $10k. So, the contingency reserve is now $35k. The plant is still $20k. So, the total reserves are still $45k.

Now, how does this affect the free retained earnings? The free retained earnings are the retained earnings not tied up in contingencies. So, if the company keeps the same amount of retained earnings, the free retained earnings would decrease by the $10k used for contingencies. Because the contingency reserve is higher, the company has to retain less, so free retained earnings go down.

Wait, but in the original data, free retained is $50k. If the company has to use $10k of retained earnings for contingencies, then free retained would be $50k - $10k = $40k. So, the free retained earnings would decrease by $10k.

Looking at the options, the answer choices are A to J. Let me check the options.

Options are:

A: $40,000

B: $35,000

C: $70,000

D: $45,000

E: $50,000

F: $55,000

G: $20,000

H: $30,000

I: $60,000

J: $65,000

So, the correct answer would be A: $40,000.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the way the question is presented, the contingency reserve is $25k, and it's increased by $10k. So, the free retained earnings would decrease by $10k, so $50k - $10k = $40k. So, the correct answer is A.

The question involves understanding the impact of increasing the contingency reserve on free retained earnings. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initial Data**: 
   - Contingencies reserve: $25,000
   - Plant expansion reserve: $20,000
   - Total reserves: $45,000
   - Free retained earnings: $50,000
   - Total retained earnings: $95,000

2. **Impact of Contingencies Reserve Increase**:
   - The contingency reserve increases by $10,000, making it $35,000.
   - Since the total reserves remain at $45,000, the plant reserve must decrease by $10,000 to stay within the total.
   - The free retained earnings are calculated as total retained earnings minus the contingency reserve.

3. **Effect on Free Retained Earnings**:
   - The contingency reserve increases by $10,000.
   - Therefore, free retained earnings decrease by $10,000.
   - New free retained earnings = $50,000 - $10,000 = $40,000.

4. **Answer Option**:
   - The correct answer is **A: $40,000**.
