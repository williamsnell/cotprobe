Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about the World Bank's 1997 findings regarding the percentage of the world's population living in low and lower-middle income countries. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the World Bank is a significant international organization that provides data, research, and reports on global development and economic conditions. The question is from 1997, so I should focus on that time frame.

The question says the fraction of the population living in countries with per capita income of $1230 or less. I'm trying to recall any data I know about that. I think there was a report or a study from the World Bank in the late 90s that categorized income levels. 

Wait, I remember that in 1997, the World Bank had data from the World Development Indicators (WDI) report. Let me think: I think in that report, the percentage of the world population living in the lowest three income groups (which would include countries with incomes below $1230) was about 70%. 

But wait, sometimes the exact numbers can be a bit fuzzy. Let me double-check. I think in 1997, it was around 70%, but I'm not entirely sure. I also remember that there was a time when the global wealth became more concentrated, and countries like China and India were growing rapidly, but that might have happened after 1997. 

Alternatively, I should think about other reports. Another source I recall is the World Bank's latest report, but without specific dates, it's hard to pin down. However, the question gives options that include numbers around 70%, which is one of the choices. 

Looking at the options provided: A is 70%, F is 55%, G is 60%, H is 75%, I is 80%, J is 45%. The question is about low and lower-middle income countries, which would include the bottom three quintiles as well as the bottom two. But I'm not sure if it includes the bottom three or the bottom two. Let me clarify that. In income terms, the first quintile is the lowest 20%, the second 20%, the third 20%, and so on. So, the "lowest three" would be the bottom 60% (20% each). 

Wait, the question says "low and lower-middle income countries" which typically refers to the bottom three quintiles. So, the first three quintiles would be 60% of the population. The World Bank's 1997 report would have given the distribution around that point. 

I think the exact number might have been 70%, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, some sources I've read before mention that in 1997, the fraction was about 70%. So the correct answer would be A:70%. However, I might have to consider other sources. 

Wait, another angle: the World Bank's World Development Indicators report for 1997 might have had data. Let me think: I believe that in 1997, the lowest three quintiles (low, lower-middle, and middle) accounted for about 70% of the world's population. So that would match option A. 

Alternatively, I might have heard that in 1997, the fraction was around 70%, so that's the answer. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes percentages can shift a bit. For example, I've also heard that in 2000, the number might have changed a bit, but since the question is about 1997, it's the 1997 figure. 

Another thought: maybe the percentage was higher. Let me think again. I've read that in 1997, the World Bank reported that the lowest three quintiles accounted for roughly 70% of the global population. So, the correct answer should be A:70%.

The World Bank's 1997 report indicated that the fraction of the world's population living in low and lower-middle income countries (the bottom three quintiles) was approximately 70%. 

Answer: A
