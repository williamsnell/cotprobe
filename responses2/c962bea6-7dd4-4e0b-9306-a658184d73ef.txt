Question:

A group of scientists wanted to estimate the proportion of geese returning to the same site for the next breeding season. Suppose they decided to increase the sample size from 200 to 2,000. How will this affect the distribution of the sample proportion?

Options:

A: The shape of the distribution of the sample proportion will change significantly.
B: There will be no noticeable change in the distribution of the sample proportion.
C: The distribution of the sample proportion will become more uniform.
D: The distribution of the sample proportion will become skewed.
E: The distribution of the sample proportion will be more spread out.
F: The distribution of the sample proportion will more closely resemble the binomial distribution.
G: The distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.
H: The spread of the distribution of the sample proportion will remain unaffected.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this statistics question about sample proportions. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question says that a group of scientists wants to estimate the proportion of geese returning to a site for breeding. They initially plan to take a sample of 200 geese, but they decide to increase the sample size to 2,000. The question is, how will this affect the distribution of the sample proportion?

The options are A to H, each describing a different aspect of the distribution.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with sample proportions, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) comes into play. The CLT states that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample proportion becomes approximately normal, regardless of the population distribution. So, the shape of the distribution should become more like a normal distribution.

Wait, but what about the mean and standard deviation? The mean of the sample proportion is equal to the population proportion, p. The standard error (which is the standard deviation of the distribution) is sqrt(p(1-p)/n). So when n increases, the standard error decreases. That means the distribution becomes narrower because the spread of the distribution is smaller. So the distribution is more concentrated around the mean.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the shape changes significantly. Well, the CLT says the distribution becomes more normal, but does it change significantly? Or does it just become more normal? I think it becomes more normal, so A might not be correct.

Option B: No noticeable change. Well, the distribution becomes more normal and becomes narrower. So it's definitely changing. B is probably wrong.

Option C: Uniform. That doesn't make sense. Uniform distribution is when all outcomes have the same probability, which isn't the case here.

Option D: Skewed. No, because as n increases, the distribution becomes more symmetric and approaches a normal distribution, which is symmetric. So D is wrong.

Option E: More spread out. Wait, wait, no. The spread is about variance and standard deviation. The standard error decreases, so the distribution's spread (standard deviation) decreases. So E says it's more spread out, which would be incorrect. So E is wrong.

Option F: More closely resembles the binomial distribution. But the binomial distribution is for counts, not proportions. As n increases, the binomial distribution can be approximated by the normal distribution. So F is about the distribution of the sample proportion. The binomial distribution describes the number of successes, but the sample proportion's distribution (the question is about that) is different. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Less spread out. That's correct because the standard error is getting smaller, so the distribution is less spread out, or more concentrated. So G is correct.

Option H: Spread remains unaffected. No, because as n increases, the spread (standard error) decreases.

So looking back at the options, the correct answer is either A, G, or H. Wait, option A says the shape changes significantly. But the CLT says the distribution becomes more normal. So the shape isn't significantly different; it's becoming more normal. So option A is incorrect. So the distribution's shape changes from something like a binomial distribution (which is skewed) to a normal distribution. So the change is significant.

Wait, but perhaps the initial shape for n=200 is different. For n=200, the standard error would be sqrt(p(1-p)/200). For n=2000, it's sqrt(p(1-p)/2000). So the standard error is smallerâ€”so the distribution is less spread out. So the spread becomes narrower, so the distribution becomes more concentrated.

So looking again, the correct answer is G: The distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.

Wait wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The options:

A: The shape of the distribution of the sample proportion will change significantly. Incorrect. The shape becomes more normal.

B: No change. Incorrect.

C: Uniform. No, it's not uniform.

D: Skew. No, it's more normal.

E: More spread out. No, it's less spread out.

F: More closely resembles binomial. No, sample proportion's distribution isn't binomial; it's approximately normal.

G: Less spread out. Correct.

H: Spread remains. No.

So the correct answer is G: the distribution becomes less spread out. So the sample size increase leads to a less spread-out distribution.

Wait, but wait. The spread is about the standard error. Let me think about the actual wording. The question says, how will this affect the distribution. So the options are about the distribution's characteristics.

So the distribution is becoming more normal (so A is incorrect because it's not significant change in shape), G is correct because the distribution is more concentrated (we're less spread out).

So the correct answer is G.

The question asks how increasing the sample size from 200 to 2,000 affects the distribution of the sample proportion. The key points are based on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), which states that the distribution of the sample proportion becomes more normal as the sample size increases. 

- **Option A** is incorrect because the distribution becomes more normal, not significantly so.
- **Option B** is incorrect because there is a noticeable change in the distribution.
- **Option C** is incorrect because the distribution is not becoming uniform.
- **Option D** is incorrect because the distribution is not becoming skewed but becomes approximately normal.
- **Option E** is incorrect because the distribution is becoming more concentrated, not more spread out.
- **Option F** is incorrect because the distribution is not resembling the binomial distribution.
- **Option G** is correct because the distribution becomes less spread out, becoming more concentrated.
- **Option H** is incorrect because the spread decreases with increasing sample size.

Thus, the correct answer is **G: The distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.**
