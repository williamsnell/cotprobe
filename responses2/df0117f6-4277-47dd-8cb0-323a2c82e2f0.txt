Okay, so I have this question about mean-square quantization error during signal quantization. Hmm, I remember that quantization involves approximating a continuous signal with a set of discrete values. The error is the difference between the original signal and the quantized value. The question says the error is equally likely to be in the range from -S/2 to +S/2, where S is the step size.

Wait, the mean-square error (MSE) is the average of the squared errors. So I need to compute the average of the square of the quantization error over all possible values. Since the error is equally likely to be in any part of the range, it's a uniform distribution.

Oh right, for a uniform distribution over an interval, the MSE is given by the square of the variance. The variance for a uniform distribution over [-a, a] is (a²)/3. Wait, is that right? Let me think. The variance for a uniform distribution from -b to +b is (b²)/3. No, wait, wait, let me get it right.

The variance σ² is (1/(2b)) ∫ (from -b to b) x² dx. The integral of x² from -b to b is 2*(b³/3) )= 2b³/3. Then σ² is (2b³/3) / (2b) )= (b²)/3. So the variance is b²/3. The mean-square error is the variance because it's the same as the mean of the squared error. So the MSE is (S²)/3. Because S is the step size, which I think is the width of the interval. Wait, the range is from -S/2 to +S/2, so the total range is S. So S is the step size. So substituting, the MSE is S²/3. So looking at the options, option A is S²/3 which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. The error is the difference between the original and the quantized value. So if the quantization step is S, then the range is S. So the interval from -S/2 to +S/2. So the variance would be ((S/2)^2) / 3? Or wait, no, because the interval is from -S/2 to +S/2, that's a range of S. So when I model it as a uniform distribution over [-a, a], a is S/2. So variance would be (a)^2 /3 = (S/2)^2 /3 = S²/(12). So the mean-square error is S²/(12), which is option B.

Wait, so which one is correct? Did I make a mistake in substituting a as S/2?

Wait, I think I got confused. Let me recompute. The interval is from -S/2 to +S/2. That's a length of S. So a is S/2. Then the variance is (a)^2 /3 = (S²/4)/3 = S²/12. So the MSE is S²/12. So the correct answer would be option B. But I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was S²/3. Hmm, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The formula for the mean-square error in uniform quantization is (S^2) /12. So option B. I think I was initially right the first time. Oh wait, no, wait. My confusion arises because the interval is S in length, but the step is S. Oh, no, the step size S is the width of each quantization level. So the number of steps would be S/(step size). Wait, no, step size is the difference between consecutive quantization levels. So for example, if you have steps at -S/2, -S/2 + S, etc., each step is S apart. So between -S/2 and +S/2, the total is S. So the quantization step is S, right?

Wait no, wait. If the step is S, then each level is S apart. Between -S/2 and +S/2, the total is S. So the interval is S, so the variance would be ( (S/2)^2 ) /3 = S²/(12). So the mean-square error is S²/12. So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think about the general formula. For a uniform distribution over [-a, a], the variance is a²/3. So if the interval is of width 2a, then the variance would be (a)^2 /3. But in this case, the interval is from -S/2 to S/2, so the width is S. So a is S/2. So variance = (S/2)^2 /3 = S²/(4 *3) = S²/12.

So the correct answer is option B: S²/12.

The question asks for the mean-square quantization error (MSE) during the quantization of a signal, where the quantization error lies uniformly in the range \(-S/2\) to \(+S/2\), with \(S\) being the step size. The MSE is the average of the squared errors and is equivalent to the variance of the error distribution.

For a uniform distribution over the interval \([-a, a]\), the variance is given by \(\sigma^2 = \frac{a^2}{3}\). In this case, the interval is \(-S/2\) to \(+S/2\), so the width of the interval is \(S\). Thus, \(a = S/2\). Substituting this into the variance formula:

\[
\sigma^2 = \frac{(S/2)^2}{3} = \frac{S^2}{4 \times 3} = \frac{S^2}{12}.
\]

Therefore, the mean-square quantization error is \(\frac{S^2}{12}\), which corresponds to option **B**.
