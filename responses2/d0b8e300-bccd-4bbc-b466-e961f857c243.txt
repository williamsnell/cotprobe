Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a sand bag has a mass of 5 kg and a weight of 50 N on Earth. Then it's asking, what's the mass and weight of this sand bag on a planet that has half the gravity compared to Earth.

Hmm, I remember that weight is related to mass and the gravitational acceleration. The formula for weight is W = m * g, where W is weight, m is mass, and g is the gravitational acceleration.

On Earth, the sand bag has a mass of 5 kg and a weight of 50 N. Let me check that: using the formula, W = m * g. So 50 N equals 5 kg times Earth's gravity. Wait, Earth's gravity is about 9.8 m/s². Let me confirm: 5 kg * 9.8 m/s² equals 49 N, which rounds to 50 N. So that makes sense.

Now, the question is about a planet that's half the gravity of Earth. So the planet's g is 4.9 m/s² (since 9.8 / 2 = 4.9). Because the planet's gravity is half, the weight on this planet will be less than on Earth.

Wait, the mass of the sand bag doesn't change because mass is a property of the object itself, regardless of the planet. So the mass remains 5 kg. But the weight would change because weight depends on g.

So the sand bag's mass is still 5 kg. Now, what's its weight on the new planet? Using the same formula: W = m * g. So 5 kg times 4.9 m/s² equals 24.5 N. Wait, let me calculate that: 5 * 4.9 = 24.5 N.

Looking at the options, I see option B: 5kg, 25N. Oh wait, 25 is close to 24.5, so perhaps rounding. Or maybe the planet's gravity is exactly half, so 5kg * (9.8/2) = 5*4.9 = 24.5 N. So the correct weight would be approximately 24.5 N, which isn't exactly an option. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A: 5kg, 75N → That would be if g was 15, which is way too high.
B: 5kg, 25N → 25 is 5 times 5, which doesn't fit.
Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate.

Wait Earth's g is 9.8 m/s², so half is 4.9 m/s². So 5 kg *4.9 = 24.5 N. But the options don't have 24.5. Let me see.

Looking at the options, option B is 25 N. So that's the closest. But wait, let me see the other options.

Option G says 2.5 kg. That would be if the mass was halved, which isn't correct because mass doesn't change with gravity. So G is wrong.

Option C: 2.5 kg, 12.5 N. That would be 5 kg divided by 2 (mass) and 50N divided by 4 (since weight is mass times g, and g is halved, so W becomes W/2.

Wait, 50 N on Earth is 5kg * 9.8 m/s². On the planet, the weight is (5kg * 4.9) = 24.5 N, which is approximately 25 N. So the correct weight is about 25 N.

So the options are:

Looking again, option B is 5kg, 25N. So the mass is correct, but weight is 25 N. But wait, 25N is higher than 24.5. Hmm. Or maybe I should think about this differently.

Wait wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check:

Planet's g is half of Earth's. So, Earth's g is 9.8 m/s², so 9.8 / 2 = 4.9 m/s².

Weight on the planet: W = m * g = 5 kg * 4.9 m/s² = 24.5 N, approximately 25 N.

So the correct answer should have a mass of 5 kg and weight of 25 N. Looking at the options:

Option B says 5kg, 25N. So that's correct. But wait, I'm getting confused because sometimes options might have 50N as the weight on Earth, which is the original weight. But that's not the case here.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Options:

A:5,75 → 75 is 5kg * 15, which is way too high.

B:5,25 → 25 is 5kg * 5. So that's 25 N.

C:2.5, 12.5 → 12.5 is 5kg *2.5 (half g). So that would be correct if the mass was halved, but mass doesn't change.

D:5,100 → 100 is 5kg *20, which is incorrect.

E:10,25→ 10kg *2.5 (half g) → mass would be 10kg, which is wrong because mass is 5kg.

F:10,100→ same as E, but both wrong.

G:2.5,25→ mass is 2.5 kg, which would be if mass was halved and g stayed the same. But mass can't be halved.

H:5,50 → same as Earth’s weight, but that’s weight on Earth, not the planet.

I:5,10 →5kg *2 → mass is correct, but weight is 10 N. That would be correct for g=2 m/s², but the planet's g is 4.9.

J:10,50→ mass is 10kg, which is wrong. Weight is 50 N, which would be 10kg *5 m/s². So that's incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B: mass 5kg, weight 25 N.

To determine the mass and weight of the sand bag on a planet with half the gravity of Earth, we start by noting that the mass of the sand bag remains constant, as mass is independent of location. On Earth, the sand bag has a mass of 5 kg and a weight of 50 N, which aligns with the formula \( W = m \cdot g \). This confirms that \( g_{\text{Earth}} = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

On the planet in question, the gravitational acceleration is halved, so \( g_{\text{planet}} = \frac{9.8}{2} = 4.9 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Using the same formula, the weight of the sand bag on the planet is calculated as:

\[
W_{\text{planet}} = m \cdot g_{\text{planet}} = 5 \, \text{kg} \cdot 4.9 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 24.5 \, \text{N}.
\]

The mass of the sand bag remains 5 kg, as mass does not change with location. The closest option to the calculated weight of 24.5 N is 25 N. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Mass: 5 kg, Weight: 25 N**.
