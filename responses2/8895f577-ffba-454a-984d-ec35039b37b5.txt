Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation. Hmm, I remember depreciation is when you allocate an expense over time to reflect the decrease in value of an asset. The question gives me an electric sign that cost $4,500 with a life of 11,250 hours and a scrap value of $450. I need to find the depreciation charge for a month when it was used for 478 hours.

Wait, the question is about monthly depreciation. Oh right, I think the straight-line depreciation method is used when the asset is used evenly. Straight-line assumes a constant depreciation expense each year.

So the formula for straight-line depreciation is (Cost - Scrap Value) divided by the useful life in years. Or wait, sometimes the useful life is given in hours, so I have to adjust for that.

First, let's calculate the total depreciation over the entire useful life. The cost is $4,500, scrap is $450, so the total depreciable amount is $4,500 - $450 = $4,050.

Now, the useful life is 11,250 hours. So the depreciation per hour would be $4,050 divided by 11,250 hours. Let me calculate that.

4050 / 11250. Let's see, 4050 รท 11250. Hmm, dividing numerator and denominator by 150: 4050 รท150 is 27, 11250 รท150 is 75. So 27/75 = 0.36 per hour.

Wait, wait, 0.36? So each hour, the depreciation is $0.36. But wait, that doesn't seem right because $4,050 divided by 11,250 is 0.36 per hour.

So for a month, if the sign was used for 478 hours, the depreciation would be 478 hours multiplied by $0.36 per hour.

Let me compute that. 478 * 0.36. Let's break it down: 400 * 0.36 is 144, and 78 * 0.36 is 28.08. So 144 +28.08 = 172.08. So the depreciation would be approximately $172.08 per month.

Looking at the options, option G is $172.08. So that should be the answer.

To calculate the monthly depreciation charge for the electric sign, we use the straight-line method. The total depreciable amount is $4,050, and the useful life is 11,250 hours. The depreciation per hour is $4,050 / 11,250 = $0.36. For 478 hours, the depreciation is 478 * $0.36 = $172.08. The correct answer is $172.08.
