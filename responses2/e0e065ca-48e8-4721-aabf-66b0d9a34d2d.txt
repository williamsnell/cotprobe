Okay, so I've got this question here about an enzyme found in a transgenic mouse. The enzyme is involved in synthesizing an unknown product and uses two reactants. When they study it with radiolabeled compounds, they found that it switches a nitrogen group on one reactant to the other. I need to figure out which category this enzyme falls into.

Hmm, let me think about the options. Let me go through each one to see which fits.

Option A: Ligase. Ligases catalyze reactions that form double bonds, like in DNA synthesis. They usually add a phosphate group. But wait, here the enzyme is switching a nitrogen group, not adding one. So probably not ligase.

Option B: Hydrolase. This breaks down a molecule into two parts. The enzyme here is involved in synthesis, not breaking down something, so hydrolase doesn't fit.

Option C: Transferase. Transferases transfer groups from one molecule to another. For example, in peptide synthesis, amino acids are transferred. But here, it's a switch between two nitrogen-containing groups. Not sure, maybe, but maybe another option.

Option D: Synthetase. These enzymes catalyze the formation of multimeric or larger organic molecules, often through nucleophilic attack. They could transfer groups, but the question is about switching, not transferring. Also, if it's switching, maybe it's more like an isomerization or a transfer, but synthetases might not be doing that.

Option E: Phosphatase. These cleave phosphates. Again, the enzyme here isn't doing that, so probably not.

Option F: Lyase. This enzyme cleaves esters, specifically lactones and lactones from cyclic structures like lactases. It's not about transferring or switching groups, so probably not.

Option G: Oxidoreductase. These enzymes change oxidation states. The enzyme here is about transferring a nitrogen group, not about oxidizing or reducing. So probably not.

Option H: Decarboxylase. This enzyme removes CO2 from a molecule, like in cellular respiration. Not related to group switching.

Option I: Kinase. These are involved in converting a substrate to an active site. Like in DNA replication, converting the primer to a nucleophile. Not the same as group transfer.

Option J: Isomerase. Oh, right! Isomerase is an enzyme that converts one molecule into another with the same molecular weight but different structures. For example, in DNA, isomerase changes the structure, like in the DSB repair process, turning a single-stranded DNA into a double-stranded one. It specifically transfers a group, like a nitrogen, from one reactant to another. 

Wait, but the question says the enzyme catalyzes a process that switches a nitrogen group on one to the other. So that matches what isomerase does. It transfers a group from one to the other, not adding or removing.

Another thought: transferases do transfer groups, but in this case, it's switching a nitrogen group. That's more like an isomerase action. Because in isomerase, the structure changes by transferring a group. So the enzyme is an isomerase.

The enzyme in question catalyzes a process where a nitrogen group on one reactant is switched to the other. This suggests a specific type of catalytic action. Let's analyze the options:

- **Ligase**: Involves forming double bonds, not group switching.
- **Hydrolase**: Breaks down molecules, not involved in synthesis.
- **Transferase**: Transfers groups, but the mechanism here is more specific to structure change.
- **Synthetase**: Typically forms larger molecules through nucleophilic attack, not switching groups.
- **Phosphatase**: Cleave phosphates, unrelated to the described process.
- **Lyase**: Cleave esters, not group transfer.
- **Oxidoreductase**: Changes oxidation states, not group switching.
- **Decarboxylase**: Removes CO2, unrelated to group transfer.
- **Kinase**: Converts substrates to active sites, not relevant here.
- **Isomerase**: Converts one molecule to another with the same weight, specifically transferring groups, which matches the described action.

The enzyme's described function aligns with **isomerase**, which transfers a group, such as a nitrogen, between molecules. 

**Answer: J: Isomerase**
