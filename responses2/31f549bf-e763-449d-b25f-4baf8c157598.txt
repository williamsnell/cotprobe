Question:

The Department of Health plans to test the lead level in a specific park. Because a high lead level is harmful to children, the park will be closed if the lead level exceeds the allowed limit. The department randomly selects several locations in the park, gets soil samples from those locations, and tests the samples for their lead levels. Which of the following decisions would result from the type I error?

Options:

A: Keeping the park open when the lead levels are within the allowed limit
B: Closing the park based on a predicted future lead level increase
C: Keeping the park open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit
D: Closing other parks when their lead levels are within the allowed limit
E: Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit
F: Not testing the lead levels at all and closing the park
G: Keeping other parks open when their lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit
H: Disregarding the test results and keeping the park open regardless of the lead levels
I: Closing the park when the lead levels are within the allowed limit
J: Closing the park based on lead levels from a different park

Okay, so I've got this question about hypothesis testing and type I errors, right? Let me try to break it down.

The question is about the Department of Health testing lead levels in a park. They want to close the park if the level exceeds the allowed limit because lead is harmful to children. They randomly select locations, take soil samples, test for lead. Now, the question is about a type I error resulting from their decision.

Hmm, I remember that type I error is when a false positive occurs. That is, you reject the null hypothesis when it's actually true. The null hypothesis (H0) is usually the status quo or the default assumption. In this case, the null hypothesis might be that the lead levels are within the allowed limit. The alternative hypothesis (H1) would be that they're over the limit.

So, if the department concludes that the lead level is too high (H1 is true) but mistakenly rejects H0, that's a type I error. Which would mean they decide to close the park (by opening when lead is within limits or closing when it's over, depending on the result.)

Looking at the options:

Option E says they close when the lead is over. That's a correct action if they make a type I error.

Option I says they close when within limits. That's a correct action when the null is true, but it's not a type I error. It's a correct decision.

So, the type I error would be when they incorrectly close the park because of a false positive (over the limit), leading them to do so even though it's not actually harmful.

Wait, but let's make sure. Type I is rejecting H0 when it's true. So if their test shows lead levels are over (H1), and they decide to close (which is the opposite of H0), that's a type I error.

So in the options, which choice corresponds to closing when over? Option E: Closing when the lead is in excess. That's a type I error because they are closing when it's beyond the limit, which is the wrong decision (but that's a false alarm).

Wait, but the question is about what decision would result from a type I error. So, the scenario where they incorrectly close the park because they think the lead is too high. So if the lead is actually within limits, but they decide to close anyway, that's correct (no type I error). But a type I error would be when the lead is beyond the limit, and their decision is to close.

Looking back, option E is "Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit." That's a type I error because they think it's harmful (H1) when it's not.

Wait, but what about option I (Closing when within the limit)? That's a correct decision, not an error.

So the correct answer should be option E.

The correct answer is **E: Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit**. This decision represents a type I error because it incorrectly closes the park when the lead levels are actually within the safe limit. 

Answer: E
