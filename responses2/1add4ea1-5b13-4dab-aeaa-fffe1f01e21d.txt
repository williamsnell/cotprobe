Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Hume's views on natural law. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question asks what Hume's argument is based on regarding natural law. The options are A through J, each making a statement about natural law. I remember that Hume, a Scottish philosopher, was a proponent of the social contract theory and was critical of natural law. 

Hume's arguments often revolve around the idea that natural law is too vague or doesn't account for all factors. I think he might have said that natural law isn't a fixed concept because it's based on particular circumstances and isn't a universal principle. So, maybe one of the options reflects that.

Looking at the options:

A: No universal agreement on natural law. Hmm, that could be a possibility because if there's no consensus, it's not a solid foundation.

B: Natural law is an arbitrary concept. That seems to fit because Hume might argue that natural law isn't a fixed, objective thing; it's more about the state of things as they are.

C: Does natural law apply to all cultures? Well, Hume might not necessarily dismiss all cultures, but I'm not sure. The question is about what constitutes natural law, so if natural law isn't specific to certain cultures, that could be a point, but it's not the main argument.

D: Backward-looking. I think backward-looking theories are more of a social contract perspective, not Hume's natural law argument.

E: Social contract. Hume is against social contracts because he thinks they're not real. So E is about social contracts, which isn't the focus of the question.

F: We can't know morally right or wrong. Hume might not be arguing that we can't know, but that moral rightness and wrong are a priori, meaning they can't be known through reason. But I'm not sure if that's the main point of his natural law argument.

G: Natural law is outdated. I don't think Hume would say natural law is outdated; he might argue it's still relevant but not a fixed concept.

H: Empirical evidence. Hume did argue that natural law can't be based on empirical evidence because it's synthetic a priori. But the question is about what constitutes natural law, not the basis of its conclusions.

I: State against attacks. I don't think that's Hume's focus; he's more concerned with the concept of natural law.

J: Individual rights. Hume might argue that natural law doesn't consider individual rights because it's seen as a general system that doesn't account for specific cases.

Putting it together, the question is about what Hume's argument is based on. I think the main point is that natural law isn't a fixed concept, so option B: Natural law is an arbitrary concept. Alternatively, option A says there's no universal agreement, which also makes sense because Hume might have thought that natural law isn't a universal principle, relying more on specific cases.

Wait, but the options are separate statements. The question says Hume's attack is based on his argument that something.

Hume's natural law was criticized for being too vague and not applicable to all cases, and his main thesis was that natural law isn't a fixed system but rather a system that varies depending on the particular circumstances of each society. So the correct answer would probably be option B: Natural law is an arbitrary concept.

Alternatively, if the question is about the argument that natural law isn't a universal or fixed concept, then A would be correct. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Hume's natural law theory was that it's a system that applies to each society, but it's not a fixed one because it's contingent on particular conditions. So it's not a universal agreement, but Hume might argue that natural law is arbitrary because it's not a fixed system.

Wait, the options are the statements about Hume's argument. The question is what his argument is based on. So the argument is that natural law isn't a universal agreement. Oh, no, wait. Hume's natural law was that it's not a universal system because it's contingent on the state of things. So he might say that natural law isn't a fixed concept, which fits option A: There is no universal agreement on what constitutes natural law.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought Hume's natural law was more about being contingent on circumstances, not arbitrary. So maybe the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, maybe B is correct because Hume's natural law is seen as an arbitrary, speculative concept. Let me recall. Hume's views on natural law include that it's not a fixed system, it varies, and is not a priori. So, perhaps the argument is that it's an arbitrary concept. But I think the key point is that natural law isn't a fixed system, so option A.

Wait, no. I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me think: Hume's natural law theory was that it's not a fixed system because it depends on particular circumstances and isn't a priori. So the argument is that natural law is not a fixed system, which is option A.

Alternatively, option B says natural law is an arbitrary concept. That might also be correct because Hume's natural law theory is that it's not a fixed system, so it's arbitrary. So both A and B could be correct. But the question is about what constitutes natural law, so option B says it's an arbitrary concept. That makes sense because he's arguing it's not a fixed system.

Wait, but the options are separate statements. The question is, which statement is based on Hume's argument. So the argument is that natural law doesn't have a universal agreement. So the answer is option A: There's no universal agreement on what constitutes natural law.

Wait, no. Because Hume's natural law isn't a fixed system. It's a contingent system. So the argument is that natural law isn't a fixed, universal concept. So option A is correct. But some sources say that Hume's natural law is an arbitrary system because it's contingent.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. The question is about what Hume's argument is based on regarding natural law. So his argument is that natural law isn't a fixed system, which is option A or B.

I think the correct answer is A: There is no universal agreement on what constitutes natural law.

Wait, but no. Because Hume's natural law is about applying to all societies, but it's not a universal system. So perhaps the argument is that natural law isn't a universal system. So option A.

Alternatively, the argument is that natural law isn't a fixed system, so the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but the options are about what constitutes natural law. So if the argument is that natural law isn't a fixed system, then the correct answer is A. But another thought: perhaps Hume's main point is that natural law is not a fixed system, so the answer is A.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try recalling what Hume's argument is. Hume believed that natural law is not a fixed system because it's contingent on particular circumstances and is not a priori. So the argument is about the arbitrariness of natural law. So the answer would be option B: Natural law is an arbitrary concept.

Wait, but the question is about what Hume's attack is based on. So the attack is that natural law isn't a universal or fixed system. So the correct answer is A. Or is it B?

I think I'm getting confused between A and B. Let me think of it this way: the question is about what Hume's argument is based on regarding natural law. So if Hume argues that natural law isn't a fixed system, the answer would be A. But if he argues that natural law is arbitrary, it's B.

I think that Hume's natural law is an arbitrary concept because it's not a fixed system. So the argument is that natural law is arbitrary, which is option B.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to recall. Hume's natural law was a system that could vary with the circumstances of each society, but it's not a priori. So it's not a fixed system, but the focus is on its arbitrariness. So the argument is that natural law is not a fixed system, which is option A.

Alternatively, Hume might argue that natural law is an arbitrary system because it's based on particular circumstances, not a universal principle. So option B.

I think I'm not 100% sure, but I think the correct answer is A: There is no universal agreement on what constitutes natural law.

Wait another thought. Natural law is a system that applies to all societies, but it's not a fixed system. So the argument is that natural law isn't a universal system, which would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps it's that natural law is an arbitrary concept, so option B.

I think I've read that Hume's natural law is that it's a general system that applies to various societies, but it's not a fixed system because it's contingent on the state of things. So the argument is that natural law isn't a fixed system, which is option A.

But I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, I think the correct answer is A: There is no universal agreement on what constitutes natural law.

Wait, no, I remember that Hume's natural law is not a fixed system but is contingent. So the argument is that natural law isn't a fixed system, which is option A.

Wait, I'm getting more and more confused. I think I'll have to go with option A: There is no universal agreement on what constitutes natural law.

The question asks which statement reflects Hume's argument on natural law. Hume, a proponent of social contract theory, argued that natural law is not a fixed system and that it varies with the circumstances of each society. The key point is that natural law is not a universal or fixed concept but is contingent on particular conditions.

- **Option A**: "There is no universal agreement on what constitutes natural law."  
  Hume's argument centers on the idea that natural law is not a fixed system, so this statement aligns with his view.

- **Option B**: "Natural law is an arbitrary concept."  
  While Hume's natural law is arbitrary, the focus of his argument is more on its contingency and variability rather than its arbitrariness.

- **Option C**: "Natural law does not apply to all cultures and societies."  
  This is unrelated to Hume's specific argument about the nature of natural law.

- **Option D**: "Natural law is backward-looking."  
  Hume's views do not address backward-looking principles.

- **Option E**: "There is no such thing as a social contract."  
  Hume's social contract theory is not his main focus.

- **Option F**: "We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong."  
  This is unrelated to Hume's argument about natural law.

- **Option G**: "Natural law is an outdated concept."  
  Hume did not argue that natural law is outdated.

- **Option H**: "Natural law fails to protect the state against attacks."  
  This is unrelated to Hume's argument.

- **Option I**: "Natural law fails to protect the state against attacks."  
  This is unrelated to Hume's argument.

- **Option J**: "Natural law does not give adequate consideration to individual rights."  
  This is unrelated to Hume's argument.

After evaluating the options, the statement that best aligns with Hume's argument is **Option A**: "There is no universal agreement on what constitutes natural law." This reflects his belief that natural law is contingent and not a fixed system.
