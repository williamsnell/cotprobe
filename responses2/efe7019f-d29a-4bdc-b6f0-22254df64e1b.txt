Okay, let's tackle this multiple-choice question. So, the question is asking which list includes only minerals. I remember that minerals are natural substances formed in Earth's crust that have a chemical composition distinct from everything else on Earth's surface. They're classified into igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary rocks, and they're often categorized into types like marble, quartz, feldspar, etc.

Looking at the options from A to J, each option lists a bunch of minerals or related substances like salts or other earth materials. I need to find the list where all the listed items are minerals, not other earth materials like salts or minerals that are derived from other rocks or sources.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Coal, chert, limestone, dolomite, halite.
Hmm, coal is a mineral. Chert is a type of sandstone, so that's a mineral. Limestone is another mineral. Dolomite is a mineral, and halite is sodium chloride, which is an inorganic compound, a salt. So this mix includes a salt. So A isn't all minerals.

Option B: Iron, copper, zinc, lead, granite.
Iron, copper, zinc are metals, which are elements, not minerals. Granite is a rock, not a mineral. So B has some metals and a rock, so definitely not all minerals.

Option C: Diamond, quartz, gypsum, salt, chalk.
Diamond is a mineral. Quartz is a mineral. Gypsum is a mineral. Salt is a mineral. Chalk is an aggregate of calcium carbonate, which is a mineral. So all items here are minerals. So C seems correct, but wait, let me look at more options just in case.

Option D: Gneiss, schist, phyllite, chlorite, mica.
Gneiss is a mineral. Schist is a rock. Phyllite is a mineral. Chlorite is a mineral. Mica is a mineral. So all in D are minerals. Hmm, but I thought the question is which list includes only minerals. So all items must be minerals. But wait, I'm not sure yet.

Option E: Coal, quartz, gold, diamond, copper.
Coal is a mineral. Quartz is a mineral. Gold is an element (Au, not a mineral). Diamond is a mineral. Copper is a metal. So this list has some non-minerals. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Marble, obsidian, basalt, quartz, diamond.
Marble is marble. Obsidian is an metamorphic rock but it's a mineral. Basalt is a mineral. Quartz is a mineral. Diamond is a mineral. So F is all minerals.

Option G: Sandstone, shale, limestone, diamond, gold.
Sandstone is a rock, not mineral. Shale is a rock. Limestone is a mineral. Diamond is a mineral. Gold is a metal. So this list has a rock and a metal, so not all minerals.

Option H: Granite, gabbro, diorite, quartz, feldspar.
Granite is a rock. Gabbro is a rock. Diorite is a mineral. quartz is a mineral. feldspar is a mineral. So H has some rocks and minerals; not all minerals.

Option I: Gold, quartz, topaz, diamond, corundum.
Gold is a metal. quartz is a mineral. Topaz is a mineral (topaz is an example). Diamond is a mineral. Corundum is a mineral. So I has a metal and several minerals. Not all minis.

Option J: Granite, topaz, marble, quartz, feldspar.
Granite is a rock. Topaz is mineral. Marble is marble. quartz is mineral. feldspar is mineral. So J has a rock and four minerals. So not all minis.

Wait, but the question is which list includes only minerals. So each item in the list must be a mineral. Let me check each option.

Option C: All items are minerals. Diamond, quartz, gypsum, salt, chalk. All are minerals. So that's correct.

Option D: All in D are minerals. Gneiss (mineral), schist (rock, so not mineral?), wait no, wait. Wait, no, schist is a rock, so that's not a mineral. So D includes a rock (schist) and four minerals. So D isn't all minerals.

Wait, but I thought earlier that C was correct. So let me recheck.

Looking back, option C: all items are minerals. Diamond is a mineral. quartz is a mineral. gypsum is a mineral. salt is a mineral. chalk is a mineral. So yes, C is all minerals.

Option D: Gneiss (min), schist (rock), phyllite (min), chlorite (min), mica (min). So D has a rock, so not all minerals.

So the correct answer is either C or D. Wait, but in option C, all items are minerals, so C is correct. Let me see if any other options have all minerals.

Option D: four minerals and a rock. So only C is all minis.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine which list includes minerals only, we need to ensure that every item in the list is a mineral, not a rock or metal. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: Contains halite (a salt), which is not a mineral.
- **Option B**: Includes metals (iron, copper, zinc) and a rock (granite).
- **Option C**: All items (diamond, quartz, gypsum, salt, chalk) are minerals.
- **Option D**: Includes a rock (schist) and four minerals.
- **Option E**: Contains gold (a metal) and a rock (diamond).
- **Option F**: All items (marble, obsidian, basalt, quartz, diamond) are minerals.
- **Option G**: Contains sandstone (a rock) and gold (a metal).
- **Option H**: Includes gabbro (a rock) and diorite (a mineral).
- **Option I**: Contains gold (a metal) and a mineral (topaz).
- **Option J**: Includes a rock (granite) and several minerals.

The only list where all items are minerals is **Option C: Diamond, quartz, gypsum, salt, chalk**.

**Answer: C**
