Okay, so I have to figure out the major difference between naturalism and positivism. I remember both are related to political philosophy, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

I think naturalism is about the natural order or the reasons behind human behavior. It's often associated with the concept of natural rights, like the right to life, free thought, and property rights. Naturalism might focus on why things happen naturally, rather than human agency.

On the other hand, positivism is more about the structure and how society should function. It's about building systems based on observable facts and logic, rather than trying to explain the underlying causes. Positivism seems more about what's correct or right based on evidence.

Looking at the options:

Option A says naturalism is based on universal and objective rules, and positivism on a legal system created by states with their own interests. That sounds correct. Naturalism is about natural laws, while positivism is about the legal framework.

Option B says naturalism is for human rights law, which doesn't sound right. Naturalism isn't about human rights; it's more about the right conditions for existence.

Option C says naturalism deals with values and positivism with rules. Wait, isn't positivism more about the rules themselves? Or is it that naturalism is value and positivism is rule? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. I think naturalism is about values like justice and rights, while positivism is about the rules that society follows, like laws.

Option D says naturalism is outside Europe and positivism is Euro-centric. That's not necessarily true; both are theories that apply across Europe, but naturalism is more about the underlying reasons, while positivism is more about the specific rules.

So putting it together, the major difference is between the values (naturalism) and the rules (positivism). So option A is correct.
