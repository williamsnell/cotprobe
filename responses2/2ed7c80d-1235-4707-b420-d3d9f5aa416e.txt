Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution containing sodium acetate and acetic acid. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that sodium acetate is a salt that comes from a weak acid and a strong base. Sodium is a spectator ion, so it doesn't affect the pH much. Acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, which is a weak acid. So when sodium acetate dissolves in water, it dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^- ions. The acetate ions will react with water to form some H+ ions, making the solution acidic. But since it's a weak base, the pH won't be too low.

The problem gives me the concentrations of both sodium acetate and acetic acid. Sodium acetate is 0.10 M, and acetic acid is 0.03 M. Also, the apparent pK_a for acetic acid is 4.57 at the given ionic strength. Oh wait, the apparent pK_a is the same as the actual pK_a, right? Because apparent usually refers to activity coefficients, but at ionic strength 4.57, maybe it's close enough to the real value.

Wait, no, wait. The question says "apparent pKfor acetic acid at this ionic strength is 4.57." So I think that's the pKa value. Because apparent pKa is the same as the actual pKa when the ionic strength is low enough, but here it's given as 4.57. So I can use that as the pKa value. That simplifies things.

So the formula for pH of a buffer solution is the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]), where [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).

In this case, the conjugate base is acetate (A-), and the weak acid is acetic (HA). So plugging in the numbers: 

pH = 4.57 + log(0.10 / 0.03)

Wait, let's calculate that. 0.10 divided by 0.03 is approximately 3.333... The log of 3.333 is about 0.522 (since log(3) is approx 0.477, log(3.333) is a bit more). Let me think—since 10^0.52 is about 3.31, so yeah, log(3.333) is about 0.522.

So pH would be 4.57 + 0.522 = about 5.092. Looking at the options, option J is 5.09.

Wait, but I should double-check. What are the concentrations again? Sodium acetate is 0.10 M, so acetate is 0.10 M. Acetic acid is 0.03 M. So [A-] is 0.1, [HA] is 0.03. So ratio is 0.1/0.03 = 3.333. Log of that is about 0.522. Adding to 4.57 gives 5.092, which rounds to 5.09. So the pH is around 5.09.

Looking at the options, option J is 5.09. Alternatively, are there any other factors I should consider? I don't think so. The problem gives the pKa as 4.57, so that's the starting point. Since both the acid and its conjugate base are in solution, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies. So the answer should be option J.
</think>

To calculate the pH of a solution containing 0.10 M sodium acetate and 0.03 M acetic acid at 25°C, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right)
\]

Here:
- The concentration of the conjugate base (\( [\text{A}^-] \)) is 0.10 M (from sodium acetate).
- The concentration of the weak acid (\( [\text{HA}] \)) is 0.03 M (acetic acid).
- The apparent \( \text{pKa} \) for acetic acid at the given ionic strength is 4.57.

The ratio of the concentrations is:

\[
\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{0.10}{0.03} = 3.333
\]

The logarithm of this ratio is:

\[
\log\left(3.333\right) \approx 0.522
\]

Substituting into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.57 + 0.522 = 5.092
\]

The pH is therefore approximately 5.09. Among the given options, the closest value is **5.09**, which corresponds to option J.
