Okay, so I've got this electrostatics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The setup is a point charge q at the center of a spherical conducting shell. The shell has inner radius r₁ and outer radius r₂. I need to calculate the electrostatic energy of this system.

Hmm, electrostatic energy... I remember that for a point charge, the electrostatic energy is (1/(2ε₀)) * (q² / r), but wait, that's for an isolated point charge. But here it's a conducting shell, so I think the charge is going to induce some charges on the conducting shell's surfaces.

Wait, in a conducting shell, the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero. So the point charge q at the center would induce a charge of -q on the inner surface of the shell because the conducting material allows charges to redistribute. And then, the outer surface would have a charge of +q to maintain electrostatic equilibrium.

Oh right, because the conducting shell is neutral (I assume) initially, so the inner surface gets -q and the outer gets +q. But wait, if the shell itself is conducting, would that mean the charges are on the outer surface? Or does the conducting shell just have the outer surface with the induced charges, and the inner is just the point charge?

Wait, no, because the conducting shell has a cavity. The cavity is the point charge. So when you have a point charge inside a conducting shell, the inner surface of the conductor will have a charge that cancels the field inside the conductor. Since the point charge is q, the inner surface of the conducting shell must have a charge of -q. Then, the outer surface of the conducting shell must have a charge of +q to balance the charges, right?

So the conducting shell itself as a whole has a net charge of zero because it's a conductor. So the charge distribution is: the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q.

Now, what's the electrostatic energy here? I think the potential energy depends on the charge configuration.

The formula for the electrostatic energy (U) of a system is generally given by U = (1/(2ε₀)) ∫ E² dV, but that's for continuous charge distributions. Alternatively, for two point charges, the energy is (1/(2ε₀)) (q1 q2) / r, but that's when they are point charges a distance r apart. But this is a bit different because we have a conducting shell with induced charges.

Wait, but maybe I can model this by considering the charges on the outer surface. Because the inner surface is induced by the point charge, the outer surface has a charge of +q. So the outer surface is a conducting sphere with charge +q. So then, the potential energy is the energy stored in the outer surface.

Wait, but the outer surface is a sphere with charge +q. So the energy stored in that would be (1/(2ε₀)) (q^2 / r₂), but wait, I might be missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the conducting shell's energy is the energy stored in the induced charges, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the energy is the sum of the energy of the point charge and the energy of the induced charges on the shell.

Wait, but the point charge is at the center. The conductor's inner surface has -q. So the energy would come from the electric fields from all charges.

Another approach: The system can be considered as a point charge q at the center and a shell with +q on its outer surface. So the potential energy is the energy stored in the electric field of the total charge configuration.

Wait, but how to calculate that? Alternatively, perhaps the energy is the sum of the potential energies of each charge. For a point charge and a shell, the potential at the center due to the shell's charge.

Wait, I think the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the electric field inside the conductor is zero because the charges are on the surface. The point charge is at the center, and the shell's outer surface has +q.

The potential at the center due to the shell's charge. Wait, the potential inside the conducting shell (since it's a conductor) is the same everywhere, right? Or wait, no, because the conducting shell has a cavity. The potential at the center is due to the induced charges on the inner surface and the charge on the outer surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential inside the conducting material is the same, but the potential at the surface of the conductor is different.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model the system. The point charge q is at the center. The conducting shell has inner radius r₁ and outer radius r₂. The inner surface of the conducting shell has charge -q, and the outer has +q.

So the outer surface is a sphere of radius r₂ with charge +q.

So the potential at the center of the system (which is the same as the center of the conducting shell) is due to the +q on the outer surface and the -q on the inner surface.

Wait, but the point charge q is at the center. So the inner surface's charge (-q) is located at r₁, but wait no. The inner surface's charge is on the inner radius r₁. So the inner surface charge is at r₁.

Wait, but the conducting shell is a separate object. Oh wait, the conducting shell is a separate entity. So the charges on the inner surface of the conducting shell are at a distance r₁ from the point charge q. Similarly, the charges on the outer surface are at r₂.

Wait, so the point charge is at the center of the conducting shell. The conducting shell has inner radius r₁ and outer radius r₂.

So the conducting shell's inner surface has a charge of -q, and the outer surface has a charge of +q.

The potential at the center of the system (the point charge's location) due to the inner surface charge is (due to the inner surface charge) which is a spherical shell. The potential at the center of a spherical shell of charge Q is (Q)/(4πε₀ r). So the inner surface charge is -q, so the potential from that is (-q) / (4π ε₀ r₁), where r₁ is the inner radius.

The outer surface charge is +q at radius r₂. The potential at the center from the outer surface is (+q) / (4π ε₀ r₂).

So the total potential at the center is the sum of these two:

V_center = [ (-q) / (4π ε₀ r₁) ) ] + [ q / (4π ε₀ r₂) ) ]

That makes sense because the point charge q is at the center, so the inner surface's charge creates a potential at the center, and the outer surface's charge also contributes.

Now, the electrostatic energy is (1/(2 ε₀)) times the integral of E² dV. But since we have a distribution of charges, perhaps it's easier to model it as the sum of two point charges at different locations.

Wait, but the conducting shell is a conductor, which is a bit tricky. Oh wait, but in terms of energy, perhaps we can model the system as the point charge q and the induced charge on the inner surface. But maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the conducting shell can be treated as a distribution of charge, but it's a conducting shell, so the charges are on the surfaces.

Wait, perhaps the total energy is the sum of the energies of the point charge and the induced charges on the shell.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Another approach: the energy stored in a system is the energy of the charges, which for a system with charges q1 and q2 is (1/2) k q1 q2 / r, but that's when they are a distance r apart. But in this case, the point charge is inside a conducting shell, so the charges are on the conducting shell's surfaces.

So let's model the system as having a point charge q at the center, and a conducting shell with inner surface -q and outer surface +q. The total charge is zero.

The potential energy U of such a system would be the sum of the potential energies of each charge.

Wait, but the point charge is q, and the conducting shell's charges are -q and +q on their surfaces.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the potential at each surface. Because the potential at the inner surface would be due to both the point charge and the inner surface charge.

Wait, let's calculate the potential at the inner surface (r = r₁). Because the inner surface is a sphere of radius r₁, the potential there would be due to the point charge q and the inner surface charge (-q).

The potential from the point charge at a distance r is V_point = (1/(4π ε₀)) (q / r).

The potential from the inner surface charge (-q) at a distance r is V_inner = (1/(4π ε₀)) (-q / r₁).

So at r = r₁, the total potential is V_inner + V_point = [ (-q) / (4 π ε₀ r₁) ) ] + ( q / (4 π ε₀ r₁) ) ) = 0.

Similarly, the potential at r = r₂ (the outer surface) would be due to the inner surface charge and the outer surface charge.

The inner surface charge (-q) is at r₁, so its contribution at r₂ is [ (-q) / (4 π ε₀ r₂) ) ].

The outer surface charge (+q) is at r₂, so its contribution is [ q / (4 π ε₀ r₂) ) ].

So the total potential at r₂ is (-q/(4 π ε₀ r₂)) + q/(4 π ε₀ r₂) ) = 0.

So both the inner and outer surfaces have zero potential. That makes sense because in a conductor, the electric field inside the conductor is zero, so the potential is constant throughout the conductor.

Wait, but how does that help with the energy? The electrostatic energy is the sum of the energy stored in the fields. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the energy stored when considering the induced charges.

Wait, the conducting shell's outer surface has a charge of +q. The energy stored in a spherical shell with charge Q at radius R is (1/(2 ε₀)) (Q² / R). Because the potential energy is (1/2) * (Q^2) / (4 π ε₀ R) ) * (1/ (1/(4 π ε₀ R)) )) )? Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think.

The potential energy of a charge distribution is the integral of the energy density. For a spherical shell of charge Q at radius R, the potential energy is (1/2) Q^2 / (4 π ε₀ R). Because the energy is (1/2) Q V, where V is the potential. The potential at the center of the shell is V = Q/(4 π ε₀ R), so energy is (1/2) Q^2/(4 π ε₀ R).

Wait, but in our case, the conducting shell is a sphere with charge +q, at radius r₂. So the potential energy from that would be (1/(2 ε₀)) * (q^2 / r₂) ).

Wait, but that's only part of the story. The system also has the point charge q at the center. So what's the total energy?

The point charge q is at the center, and the conducting shell has charge +q on its outer surface. So the potential energy is the sum of the energy from the point charge and the energy from the shell.

Alternatively, the energy is the sum of the terms from each charge. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the system can be found by considering the potential energy of the system as the sum of the energy due to the point charge and the energy due to the induced charges on the shell.

The induced charges on the shell consist of -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface. The point charge is +q at the center, and the inner surface is -q, and the outer surface is +q.

I think the energy is the sum of the energies from each of these sources.

Wait, the energy from the point charge would be (1/(2 ε₀)) (q^2 / r_0), where r_0 is the distance from the point charge to the center. But that's only the point charge. The shell's induced charges also contribute.

Alternatively, maybe the energy is the sum of the potential energies of the charges. Since the point charge and the shell's charges are independent, perhaps the total energy is the sum of the energy from each.

Wait, the point charge is at the center, and the shell's charge is outside, so the potential energy of the point charge is zero because it's at the center. But the shell's charge contributes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the energy stored in the conducting shell. The conducting shell has the charge +q on its outer surface. So the potential energy of the conducting shell is (1/(2 ε₀)) (q^2 / r₂).

But the point charge is inside the conducting shell. So what is the potential energy of the point charge due to the conducting shell? The conducting shell's charge is at r₂, so the potential at the point charge's location (r=0) is the same as the potential at the center of the shell, which is zero, as we found earlier (because each surface's potential is zero). So the point charge has zero potential energy due to the shell's charge.

Wait, but in reality, the shell's charge is at r₂, so the potential at r=0 (the point charge location) is (1/(4π ε₀)) (q / r₂). But since the potential is zero at the center, the point charge has zero potential energy due to the shell.

So the total energy would be the energy from the induced charges on the shell. That is, the energy stored in the conducting shell is (1/(2 ε₀)) (q² / r₂).

Looking at the options, option G is {1/(4π ε₀)} (q² / r₂), which would be the energy stored in the shell's charge. So that's probably the answer.

Check the other options to see if any others could fit. For example, option F is {1/(4π ε₀)} (1/ (2) ) q² (r₂ - r₁) / (r₁ r₂) ). That looks like an average potential multiplied by charge squared, but I don't think that's correct.

Alternatively, the energy from the induced charges might involve the inner surface's charge. The inner surface's charge is -q at radius r₁. The potential at the point charge's location is (1/(4 π ε₀)) ( (-q) / r₁ ) ), because the point is at the center. The energy from this would be (1/(2 ε₀)) [ (-q)^2 / r₁^2 ] * (1/(4 π ε₀)) ? No, wait, the potential energy is (1/(2 ε₀)) (q1 q2) / r where r is the distance between them. So the point charge is q, the inner surface of the shell is -q, and the distance is r₁. So the potential energy is (1/(2 ε₀)) [ (q)(-q) ) / r₁ ] = ( -1/(2 ε₀) ) (q² / r₁ ). But that's negative, which doesn't make sense because energy should be positive. Hmm, so perhaps the absolute value is taken.

Wait, but the potential at the center due to the inner surface is ( - q / (4 π ε₀ r₁ ) ), so the potential energy is (1/(2 ε₀)) ( q * (-q) ) / r₁ ) = (-1/(2 ε₀)) (q² / r₁ ), but energy should be positive, so taking the absolute value, it's (1/(2 ε₀)) (q^2 / r₁ ). But wait, that doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in that approach. Because the point charge is inside the shell, which is a conductor, the charge -q on the inner surface is at r₁, and the potential at the center is the same as the potential of the shell, which is zero. So the point charge doesn't contribute any energy from the inner surface.

So the only contribution to the energy comes from the outer surface charge of +q at r₂. So the energy is (1/(2 ε₀)) (q² / r₂). Looking at the options, option G is that.

To calculate the electrostatic energy of a system consisting of a point charge \( q \) located at the center of a spherical conducting shell of inner radius \( r_1 \) and outer radius \( r_2 \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Charge Distribution**:  
   - The conducting shell has a net charge of \( +q \) (since the point charge \( q \) at the center induces an equal and opposite charge \( -q \) on the inner surface of the shell).
   - The outer surface of the shell has a charge of \( +q \) to maintain electrostatic equilibrium.

2. **Potential at the Center**:  
   - The potential at the center of the shell is determined by the contributions from the point charge \( q \) and the inner surface charge \( -q \).  
     - The potential due to \( q \) at a distance \( r \) is \( \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r} \), and at the center (\( r = 0 \)), this term is undefined.  
     - The potential due to the inner surface charge \( -q \) at a distance \( r \) is \( \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{-q}{r} \), and at the center (\( r = 0 \)), this term also becomes undefined.  
   - However, the potential at the center is zero because the electric field inside the conducting material is zero, and the potential is constant throughout the conductor.

3. **Electrostatic Energy**:  
   - The electrostatic energy of a system is given by \( U = \frac{1}{2\epsilon_0} \int E^2 dV \), where \( E \) is the electric field.  
   - For the conducting shell, the only contribution to the energy comes from the outer surface charge \( +q \) at radius \( r_2 \).  
     - The potential energy of a spherical shell with charge \( Q \) at radius \( R \) is \( U = \frac{1}{2\epsilon_0} \frac{Q^2}{R} \).  
     - Substituting \( Q = q \) and \( R = r_2 \), the energy stored in the shell is:  
       \[
       U = \frac{1}{2\epsilon_0} \frac{q^2}{r_2}.
       \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The energy is not proportional to \( \frac{1}{r_1} \), which would correspond to the inner surface charge.  
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The energy is not proportional to \( \frac{1}{r_2} \), which would correspond to the outer surface charge.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The energy is not proportional to \( \frac{1}{r_1 r_2} \), which would correspond to a product of terms involving the inner and outer surfaces.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The energy is not proportional to \( \frac{1}{r_1^2} \), which would correspond to the inner surface charge.  
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The energy is not proportional to \( \frac{1}{r_1 r_2} \), which would correspond to a product of terms involving the inner and outer surfaces.  
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The energy involves \( \frac{1}{2} \), which is not consistent with the formula for the energy of a spherical shell.  
   - **Option G**: Correct. The energy stored in the outer surface of the shell is \( \frac{1}{2\epsilon_0} \frac{q^2}{r_2} \), which matches the derived result.
