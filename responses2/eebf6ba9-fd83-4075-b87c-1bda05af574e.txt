Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. It says that a chemical reaction requires two atoms of phosphorus for five atoms of oxygen. I need to find out how many grams of oxygen are needed by 3.10 grams of phosphorus.

Hmm, so I think I should set up a mole ratio or something. Let me think. The reaction is between P and O. The given ratio is 2 P atoms to 5 O atoms. So for every 2 moles of P, 5 moles of O are used.

Wait, but I have grams of P, not moles. I need to convert grams of P to moles. So first, I should find the molar mass of phosphorus. Phosphorus is P, atomic weight around 30.97 g/mol, right? So 3.10 grams divided by 30.97 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 3.10 / 30.97 is approximately 0.1001 moles of P. Wait, wait, no, wait. 30.97 multiplied by 0.1 is about 3.097, so 3.097 is almost 3.10. So 3.10 / 30.97 ≈ 0.1 moles. Wait, wait, wait, 3.10 divided by 30.97: 30.97 * 0.1 is 3.097, which is just a bit less than 3.10. So 3.10 / 30.97 is approximately 0.1001 moles of P.

Now, the ratio of P to O is 2:5. So for every 2 moles of P, you need 5 moles of O. So the moles of O needed would be (5/2) * moles of P. So (5/2)*0.1001 ≈ 0.2501 moles of O.

Wait a minute, let me make sure. So 2 P :5 O, so O is (5/2) times P. So yeah, 0.1001 * (5/2) = approx 0.2501 moles O.

Now, convert moles of O to grams. The molar mass of O is 16.00 g/mol. So 0.2501 * 16.00 = let's compute that. 0.25 *16 is 4. So 0.25 is 4.00. But wait, 0.2501 is a tiny bit more. 0.0001 *16 is 0.0016. So 4.00 + 0.0016 = 4.0016 grams. So about 4.00 grams of O needed. Looking at the options, option C is 4.00 g O. So that's the answer.

Wait another thought, were there any steps I missed? Oh, wait, the stoichiometric ratio is 2 P :5 O. So for every 2 P, 5 O is needed. So moles of O would be (5/2) * moles of P. I think that's correct. Let me double-check the calculations.

Molar mass of P: 30.97 g/mol. So 3.10 grams /30.97 is approx 0.1001 moles P. Then 0.1001 * (5/2) = 0.2501 moles O. Then 0.2501 * 16 = 4.0016 g. Rounding to two decimal places, 4.00 g. So option C is correct.

To determine how many grams of oxygen are required by 3.10 g of phosphorus, we start by using the given stoichiometric ratio of 2 phosphorus atoms to 5 oxygen atoms. 

1. **Convert grams of phosphorus to moles**:  
   The molar mass of phosphorus (P) is approximately 30.97 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of P} = \frac{\text{Mass of P}}{\text{Molar mass of P}} = \frac{3.10}{30.97} \approx 0.1001 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Use the stoichiometric ratio to find moles of oxygen**:  
   The ratio of phosphorus to oxygen is 2:5. Thus, moles of oxygen are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of O} = \frac{5}{2} \times \text{Moles of P} = \frac{5}{2} \times 0.1001 \approx 0.2501 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Convert moles of oxygen to grams**:  
   The molar mass of oxygen (O) is 16.00 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Mass of O} = \text{Moles of O} \times \text{Molar mass of O} = 0.2501 \times 16.00 \approx 4.00 \, \text{g}.
   \]

Thus, approximately 4.00 g of oxygen are required. The correct answer is **C: 4.00 g O**.
