Okay, so I've got this question about Parfit's philosophy and pains. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the question is about whether Parfit's philosophy says that pains can be compared in certain ways. The options are A, B, C, D.

I remember that Parfit is a philosopher who works in epistemology and the philosophy of mind. His main work, I think, is on pain and the mind. So, he might be discussing the nature of pains and how they're perceived or measured.

The question is about the magnitude of pains. So, can they be precisely compared? Or compared, but only roughly? Or can they be compared within individuals but not between? Or can't they be compared either way?

I recall that in his work, Parfit distinguishes between sensation and pain. sensation is the actual physical feeling, while pain is the subjective experience. He proposes that sensation can be compared because it's a real, measurable phenomenon. But pain is a different story. According to some interpretations, pain might not have a magnitude that's easily comparable because it's the subjective experience, which Parfit argues is not reducible to sensation.

Wait, so Parfit might say that pain can't be compared in terms of magnitude because it's subjective. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. I think he might say that pain is not reducible to sensation, so you can't directly compare the magnitudes of pains across individuals because that would require a subjective scale, which he argues isn't possible.

Alternatively, another angle: some might say that sensation can be measured, so within an individual, you can compare how much pain they feel. But pain is subjective, so between individuals, comparing pain might not be possible because it's a subjective experience that might vary a lot.

Wait, but Parfit's view on pain might have more nuance. I think he argues that pain is a kind of sensation, but not in the same way. sensation is physical, pain is subjective. So, perhaps he allows for a way to compare pain in terms of subjective intensity, but not precisely because pain isn't reducible to sensation. So, he might say that pain can be compared within individuals (because you can rate pain levels) but can't be compared between individuals because pain is subjective and varies widely.

So, looking at the options:

A: can be compared.

B: can be compared, but only roughly.

C: can be compared within individuals, but not between.

D: cannot compared either within or between.

I think the correct answer is C. Because Parfit allows for pain to be compared within individuals by rating them, but between individuals, pain is subjective and can't be precisely compared because it's a subjective experience that varies widely.

Wait, but another thought: in some interpretations, Parfit might actually say that pain can't be compared at all between individuals because it's subjective. So maybe the correct answer is D. Or is it C?

Wait, another angle. I think Parfit argues that pain is a kind of sensation, but not reducible to sensation, so you can compare pain within individuals by their subjective intensity, but between individuals, you can't compare pain magnitudes because pain is subjective and varies a lot.

So, the answer would be C: can be compared within individuals, but not between individuals.

Alternatively, if Parfit allows comparing pain within individuals, but between them, it's not possible because pain is subjective. So, the answer is C.

The question concerns Parfit's view on the comparability of pains. Parfit argues that pain cannot be precisely compared between individuals because it is a subjective experience, not reducible to sensation. However, he allows for pain to be compared within individuals by rating their subjective intensity. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A (can be compared):** Incorrect, as pain cannot be precisely compared across individuals.
- **B (can be compared, but only roughly):** Incorrect, as Parfit allows for precise comparison within individuals.
- **C (can be compared within individuals, but not between individuals):** Correct, as pain can be compared within individuals but not between them due to subjectivity.
- **D (cannot compared either within individuals or between individuals):** Incorrect, as pain can be compared within individuals.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
