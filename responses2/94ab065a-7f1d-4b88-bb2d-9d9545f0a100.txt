Okay, so I've got this question about Altman's work and speech codes. Hmm, I remember that Altman wrote a book called "The Four Horsemen of Speech: Causation, Credibility, Meaning, and Consequences." The question is about justifying speech codes, specifically which kinds of harm they address.

The options are A: causal harm, B: expressive harm, C: both, D: auxiliary. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think the main points from the book are about the four factors that help in speech effectiveness.

Causation has to do with the logic behind the speech, making sure the cause is clearly stated. Credibility is about trust, so that's important. Meaning is about what the speaker wants to get across. Consequences are the effects of the speech.

Wait, the question is asking which kind of harm has the best prospects. So, the options are asking which combination of these elements would be most effective in preventing harm.

I think causal harm and expressive harm are both about the wrong elements. Causal harm is when someone makes a cause incorrect, leading to misunderstanding. Expressive harm is when the speech is too positive, ignoring negative aspects. Both of these would be bad because they could lead to misunderstandings or negative outcomes.

Auxiliary harm, on the other hand, is about side effects or unintended consequences. Like, if the speech includes irrelevant information, that's auxiliary harm. But wait, I'm not sure if auxiliary harm is the best option. Alternatively, maybe auxiliary harm isn't as directly addressing the core issues as the others.

So, the best justified speech codes would be the ones that prevent these kinds of harms. So, both causal and expressive harmâ€”because addressing these issues would help in preventing misunderstandings and negative outcomes. That would make option C the correct answer.

I think I got it right. So, the answer is C: both causal and expressive harm.

The correct answer is C: both causal and expressive harm.
