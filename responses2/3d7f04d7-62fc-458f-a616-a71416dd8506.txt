Okay, I have this problem about calculating the annual interest rate for an installment purchase. Let's see, the camera costs $98. They bought it on an installment plan with 10% down payment and 24 weekly payments of $4 each. I need to find the annual interest rate.

Hmm, so first, I should probably figure out the total amount paid and the amount financed. The down payment is 10%, so that's 10% of $98. Let me calculate that: 10% of 98 is $9.80. So the amount financed is the total minus the down payment. 98 minus 9.8 is $88.20. 

Now, the total amount paid over 24 weeks would be 24 payments of $4 each. 24 times 4 is $96. 

Wait, so the total amount paid is $96, and the amount financed is $88.20. So the interest paid is $96 minus $88.20, which is $7.80. But wait, is that all the interest? Or is there more to it?

I think the interest rate is calculated based on the finance charge, which is the interest part, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the interest rate per period multiplied by the number of periods, considering the time value of money.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the present value formula to find the interest rate. The present value (PV) is the amount financed, which is $88.20. The payment per period (PMT) is $4. The number of periods is 24. So the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r], where r is the periodic interest rate.

So, rearranging to solve for r would be complicated because it's an equation. Maybe I can use the formula and solve for r numerically. Alternatively, I can use the approximation formula for the interest rate.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the periodic interest rate: r = (PV * (1/PMT) )^(1/n) - 1. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct formula is PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r]. So I need to find r such that when plugged into this formula, it equals the present value.

Given PV = $88.20, PMT = $4, n = 24.

So the equation is 88.20 = 4 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-24 ) / r ]

I can rearrange that to 22.05 = [1 - (1 + r)^-24 ] / r.

That's a bit tricky to solve algebraically, so I might need to use trial and error or a financial calculator approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can approximate. Let's try some values for r.

But wait, another approach: the total interest is $7.80, but the amount is $88.20, so the interest rate is such that 88.20*(1 + r)^24 = 96. Wait, no. Because the installments are equivalent to the present value of the interest. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the installment payments as an annuity. The present value of the payments should equal the amount financed. So PV = 88.20. PMT is 4. n is 24.

The formula is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

So 88.20 = 4 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-24 ) / r ]

Dividing both sides by 4: 22.05 = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-24 ) / r ]

So, 22.05 = (1 - (1 + r)^-24 ) / r.

Hmm, solving for r seems difficult without a calculator. Alternatively, I can try to estimate r.

Let me think: the present value of the payments should equal $88.20. Let me try a few interest rates.

If r is 10% per period (which is 10% per week?), wait no, because 10% per week is too high. Let me think about the context. It's a movie camera, so maybe the interest rate is higher. Let's see.

Wait, 24 weeks is a year, so the annual rate is 24 times the weekly rate. But in this problem, the payments are weekly, so perhaps the r is the weekly rate.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to compute it step by step.

Alternative approach: Maybe I can use the formula for the effective interest rate per period. Let's see.

Assume that the interest rate is x per week. Then each payment is $4, and there are 24 payments.

The present value of these 24 payments should be $88.20.

The present value formula for an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

So:

88.20 = 4 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-24 ) / r ]

So, 22.05 = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-24 ) / r ]

We need to solve for r.

Let me try r = 0.01 (1% per week). Let's compute the right side.

(1 - (1.01)^-24 ) / 0.01.

First, (1.01)^24 is approximately e^(24 * 0.01) = e^0.24 ≈ 1.27125. So 1/(1.01)^24 is about 0.7863.

1 - 0.7863 = 0.2137.

Divide by 0.01: 21.37. That's much larger than 22.05. So r must be a bit higher than 1%.

Wait, but 21.37 is less than 22.05, so maybe r is around 1.03? Let's try r=1.03 (3% per week).

Compute (1.03)^24. Let's calculate this step by step.

1.03^1 = 1.03

^2: 1.0609

^3: 1.092727

^4: 1.1255088

^5: 1.1592741

^6: 1.1940523

^7: 1.2298537

^8: 1.2667700

^9: 1.3047993

^10: 1.3443975

^11: 1.3842538

^12: 1.4257612

^13: 1.4681352

^14: 1.5116509

^15: 1.5556967

^16: 1.5999983

^17: 1.6486475

^18: 1.6978741

^19: 1.7487696

^20: 1.7997523

^21: 1.8529359

^22: 1.9082863

^23: 1.9655442

^24: 2.0260420

So 1.03^24 ≈ 2.026. Thus, (1.03)^-24 = 1/2.026 ≈ 0.493.

So (1 - 0.493) = 0.507.

Divide by 0.03: 0.507 / 0.03 = 16.9.

But 22.05 is higher than 16.9, so r must be lower than 1.03. Wait, no, wait: 1.03 gives us 16.9, which is less than 22.05. Wait, no, 1.03's calculation gives 16.9, which is much less than 22.05.

Wait, no. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Because the equation is [ (1 - (1 + r)^-24 ) / r ] = 22.05.

Wait, when r=1% (0.01):

(1 - (1.01)^-24)/0.01 ≈ 21.37 as earlier.

So 21.37 is less than 22.05. So r must be higher than 1% because the value increases with r.

Wait, let me try r=1.05% (0.0105).

Compute (1.05)^24. Let's approximate. 1.05^24 is around (1.05^5)=1.276, ^10=1.629, ^15=2.079, ^20=2.653, ^25=3.386. So 1.05^24≈3.386.

So (1.05)^-24≈1/3.386≈0.2954.

Thus, 1-0.2954=0.7046.

Divide by 0.0105: 0.7046 / 0.0105 ≈ 66.72. Which is way higher than 22.05.

Wait, that's a big jump. So maybe I'm making a mistake. Because when r increases, the denominator increases, but the numerator also increases.

Wait, perhaps I should try a lower r. Wait, what about r=0.018 (1.8% per week)?

Compute (1.018)^24. Let's see, 1.018^24. Let me compute it step by step.

1.018^1 = 1.018

^2: 1.036324

^3: 1.055198

^4: 1.075445

^5: 1.097013

^6: 1.119816

^7: 1.143961

^8: 1.169307

^9: 1.195711

^10: 1.223479

^11: 1.252066

^12: 1.281410

^13: 1.311272

^14: 1.341890

^15: 1.373296

^16: 1.405754

^17: 1.439385

^18: 1.474268

^19: 1.510523

^20: 1.547975

^21: 1.586825

^22: 1.626987

^23: 1.668458

^24: 1.711354

So (1.018)^24 ≈ 1.711354.

Thus, (1.018)^-24 ≈ 1/1.711354 ≈ 0.584.

(1 - 0.584) = 0.416.

Divide by 0.018: 0.416 / 0.018 ≈ 23.11. That's very close to 22.05.

So r is approximately 1.8% per week.

Wait, but wait: 23.11 is near 22.05, but a little higher. So maybe r is a bit less than 1.8% per week.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use linear approximation between r=1.7% and r=1.8% to find the exact value.

At r=1.7% (0.017):

(1.017)^24. Let's compute.

1.017^1=1.017

^2=1.034289

^3=1.051896

^4=1.069937

^5=1.088525

^6=1.107878

^7=1.127922

^8=1.148588

^9=1.170036

^10=1.191850

^11=1.214387

^12=1.237725

^13=1.262141

^14=1.287470

^15=1.313783

^16=1.340815

^17=1.368369

^18=1.396561

^19=1.425252

^20=1.454408

^21=1.484035

^22=1.514203

^23=1.544740

^24=1.576147

So (1.017)^24 ≈1.576147.

(1.017)^-24 ≈1/1.576147≈0.635.

So (1 - 0.635)=0.365.

Divide by 0.017: 0.365 /0.017 ≈21.47. Which is less than 22.05.

So between r=1.7% and r=1.8%, the result moves from 21.47 to 23.11.

We need 22.05.

So, the difference between 21.47 and 23.11 is about 1.64 per 0.01 change in r.

The desired value is 22.05, which is 22.05-21.47=0.58 higher than the lower bound.

So, 0.58 /1.64 ≈0.353 of the interval.

So r≈1.7% + 0.353*(0.01)=1.7353%.

So approximately 1.735% per week.

But wait, the problem asks for the annual interest rate. Since 24 weeks make a year, the annual rate is r*24.

So 1.735% per week * 24 weeks = approximately 41.64% per year.

Wait, that's about 41.6%, but the options don't have that exactly. The closest option is C:42%, which is about 42%.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, my calculation for r=1.8% gives approximately 23.11%, which is higher than desired. But the desired is 22.05. So perhaps the actual rate is a bit lower than 1.8%.

Alternatively, perhaps I can adjust. Let me try r=1.75%.

Compute (1.0175)^24.

Hmm, this would take time. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is around 1.8% per week, leading to 41.64% per year, which is closest to 42%.

Looking back at the options, option C is 42%, which seems to match.
</think>

To determine the annual interest rate for the installment plan, we analyze the given details:

1. **Amount financed**: The total cost is $98, with 10% down payment.  
   - Down payment = 10% of $98 = $9.80.  
   - Amount financed = $98 - $9.80 = $88.20.

2. **Total payments**: 24 weekly payments of $4 each.  
   - Total payments = 24 × $4 = $96.

3. **Interest paid**: Total payments minus amount financed.  
   - Interest paid = $96 - $88.20 = $7.80.

4. **Installment plan details**:  
   - Down payment = 10% (per week? Likely, as the problem presents weekly payments).
   - Payment period = 24 weeks (1 year).

5. **Present value formula**: The present value of the payments equals the amount financed.  
   - PV = PMT × [(1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r], where r is the weekly interest rate.

6. **Trial and error**: Solving for r using trial values (e.g., 1.7%, 1.8%, etc.) shows that the interest rate per week is approximately 1.735%.  

7. **Annual interest rate**: Multiply the weekly rate by 24 (weeks/year).  
   - Annual rate = 1.735% × 24 ≈ 41.64%.

8. **Closest option**: The closest option to 41.64% is **42%**.
