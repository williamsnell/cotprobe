Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with heat transfer calculations. Let's take it step by step. 

The problem says there are two 50 kg pieces of copper. One is at 175°C and the other is at 40°C. They're in contact, and I need to find the final temperature and the amount of heat transferred. The heat transfer is given by q = mCΔT, where C_P is 385 J/(kg·K). 

Hmm, right. I remember that when two substances of different temperatures are in contact, heat flows from the hotter to the colder until they reach the same temperature. So the hotter piece will lose heat, and the cooler will gain heat until they're at equilibrium.

So, let's denote the two masses as m1 and m2. Since both are 50 kg, m1 = m2 =50 kg. Initial temperatures: T1 =175°C (which is 448 K) and T2=40°C (which is 313 K). Wait, but when calculating, I think I can keep the temperatures in Celsius because the specific heat and the mass are the same. But I should convert them to Kelvin for the calculation, but I'm not sure. Let me think: for the equation, the ΔT is in Kelvin, so whether I use Celsius or Kelvin, the change would be the same. So I can keep them as is if I convert to Kelvin.

Wait, no, the formula is q = mCΔT, where ΔT is the change in temperature. Since the units for ΔT would be in K or °C, but in the formula, since it's a difference, K and °C are the same. So, either way, the calculation should be fine.

So the approach would be: since both pieces have the same mass and same specific heat, the amount of heat lost by the hotter piece equals the heat gained by the cooler piece. So, the heat lost (q1) is equal to the heat gained (q2).

So, q1 = -q2. But wait, because the heat lost by the hotter is negative in our convention, and the heat gained by the cooler is positive. Or maybe I should set up the equation considering the heat flows.

Alternatively, since heat lost by the hotter is positive, and heat gained by the cooler is negative, but perhaps it's easier to set up the equations as heat lost equals heat gained.

So, the heat lost by the first piece is q1 = m * C * (T1_initial - T_final), and the heat gained by the second piece is q2 = m * C * (T_final - T2_initial). Because the first piece cools down, so its heat is negative (as per convention), and the second piece warms up, so its heat is positive.

So setting q1 = q2 (in magnitude, but considering the directions):

m C (T1 - T_final) = m C (T_final - T2 )

Wait, but wait, the masses and C are the same for both. So let's plug in the numbers.

m =50 kg, C=385 J/(kg·K), T1=175, T2=40.

So:

50 kg * 385 * (175 - T_final) = 50 kg * 385 * (T_final - 40)

Wait, but both sides have 50 kg * 385, so they can be divided out. So,

175 - T_final = T_final -40

Adding T_final to both sides:

175 = 2T_final -40

Adding 40 to both sides:

215= 2 T_final

So T_final = 215/2 = 107.5°C.

Wait, that's one of the options. Looking at the options, option H says 107.5°C and -1299.4 kJ. So the final temp is correct, but what about the heat?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the amount of heat transferred. Let's compute q.

q can be calculated using one of the equations. Let's use q = m C (T_final - T_initial).

Wait, for the first piece, it's cooling, so the heat lost is q1 = m C (175 - T_final). For the second, it's heating, so q2 = m C (T_final -40). But since they are equal in magnitude, let's compute either.

So, choose q1:

q1 =50 kg * 385 J/(kg·K) * (175 -107.5) K.

Compute 175-107.5 = 67.5 K.

50 *385 = 19250 J. Multiply by 67.5.

19250 *67.5 = let's compute this.

First, 19250 * 60 = 1,155,000.

19250 *7.5 = let's compute 19250 *7 = 134,750, and 19250 *0.5=9625.

So 134750 +9625=144375.

So total q1 is 1,155,000 +144,375 = 1,299,375 J.

Convert that to kilojoules: 1,299,375 J = 1299.375 kJ. So approximately 1300 kJ? But looking at the options, option G is -935 kJ, which is the negative of this. Wait, no, because q is the heat lost, so the heat transferred (q) is positive, but the amount of heat is what is being transferred. Wait, no, the problem says "the amount of heat transferred between the two". Oh, so in our calculation, the heat lost is 1299.4 kJ, which would be the heat that the hot piece loses. So the answer would have the sign as negative, because it's heat lost. So the heat transferred is -1299.4 kJ, which is option G.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 130°C and -935 kJ. Wait, no, G is 130°C and -935 kJ. So the heat is negative, which would be correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 175 - T_final= 175-107.5=67.5. So 50*385=19250. 19250 *67.5 = 19250 *60= 1,155,000; 19250 *7.5=144375. Total 1,299,375 J, which is 1299.375 kJ. So the amount of heat transferred is 1299.375 kJ, but since it's heat lost by the first piece, the heat transfer is negative. So the heat is -1299.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option G is 130°C and -935 kJ, which doesn't match. Wait, what about option F: 110°C, -1100 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching. Hmm, let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The final temperature comes out correctly as 107.5°C. So the heat lost (q1) is 50 *385*(175-107.5)=50 *385*67.5.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated 50*385. 385 *50 is 19250 J/K. Then multiplied by 67.5 K gives 19250 *67.5. Let's compute that again.

19250 *67.5: let's break it down.

67.5 is 60 +7.5.

19250 *60 = 1,155,000.

19250 *7.5 = 144,375.

So 1,155,000 +144,375 = 1,299,375 J. So that's 1,299.375 kJ. Rounded to four significant figures, it's 1,299.4 kJ. So that's the heat lost, so the heat transferred is -1299.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, which one matches this? Option G says 130°C and -935 kJ. No, that's not it. Option H is 107.5°C and -1299.4 kJ. Yes, that's option H.

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option H is 107.5°C and -1299.4 kJ. So that's correct. So the final temperature is 107.5°C, and the heat transferred is -1299.4 kJ. So the correct answer should be option H.

To solve the problem, we analyze the heat transfer between two 50 kg pieces of copper with initial temperatures of 175°C and 40°C. Since the specific heat capacity (C_P) and mass (m) are the same for both pieces, the heat lost by the hotter piece equals the heat gained by the cooler piece. The final temperature is determined using the equation:

\[
q_1 = -q_2
\]

Substituting the heat transfer formula \( q = mC\Delta T \), we equate the heat lost by the hotter piece to the heat gained by the cooler piece:

\[
mC (T_1 - T_f) = mC (T_f - T_2)
\]

Simplifying, the masses and specific heat capacity cancel out, leaving:

\[
T_1 - T_f = T_f - T_2
\]

\[
T_f = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{2}
\]

Substituting the initial temperatures:

\[
T_f = \frac{175 + 40}{2} = 107.5 \, \text{°C}
\]

Thus, the final temperature is **107.5°C**, which matches options H, G, and others.

Next, calculate the heat transferred. Using the heat transfer formula for the hotter piece:

\[
q = mC (T_1 - T_f)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
q = 50 \, \text{kg} \cdot 385 \, \text{J/(kg·K)} \cdot (175 - 107.5)
\]

\[
q = 50 \cdot 385 \cdot 67.5 = 1,299,375 \, \text{J} = 1,299.4 \, \text{kJ}
\]

Since the heat is lost by the hotter piece, the heat transferred is negative:

\[
q = -1,299.4 \, \text{kJ}
\]

Now, check the options:

- **Option H**: 107.5°C and -1299.4 kJ → Correct.
- Other options do not match the calculated values.

Thus, the correct answer is **H: 107.5°C and -1299.4 kJ**.
