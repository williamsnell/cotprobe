Okay, so I've got this question here about e-mails and patient privacy. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that Dr. Brenda Browne is seeing a client who has a substance abuse disorder. She wants to forward the client's file to her. She tells them to sign a release, which probably authorizes them to do so. Now, I need to figure out the correct action based on the options given.

Hmm. From what I remember, patient privacy laws are strict. I think the main thing is not to share sensitive information unless it's necessary. So, the client signed a release, meaning she's authorizing the release. But can she forward the file without consent?

The options are A-J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Refuse to forward the file. Wait, but the release says the client has signed, which authorizes her to do so. So I think she can forward it. Refusing would probably be against the law, so A is probably not the right choice.

Option B: Wait until the client sends a request. I don't think that's the way to go. She should do it immediately if the client has already signed the release. Waiting might be considered an act of kindness, but it's not legal here.

Option C: Directly send the original file. That seems risky. She might not have all the necessary info in the original file. Plus, if the client's file is not up-to-date, sending it directly might cause issues. Plus, without any prior discussion, it's not secure.

Option D: Photocopy the file. That's a temporary measure, but she might not have all the necessary details. Plus, photocopying doesn't protect against unauthorized access.

Option E: Delete records related to the client's substance abuse. That's not about privacy; it's about security. Deleting records might make the client's files inaccessible, which is bad for privacy.

Option F: Send only the current file. But the client signed a release, so the entire file is needed. Sending parts might mean they might have sensitive info in pieces, which is not allowed.

Option G: Send a summary. That's even worse, as summaries can still contain personal information.

Option H: Ask Dr. Browne for a copy. That's a legal action. The client signed a release, so they have authority to forward the file. So, requesting a copy might be viewed as giving the client access they don't have, which is against privacy laws.

Option I: Send the file digitally. That's good. It's a secure method and doesn't require any prior discussion. Plus, the client signed the release, so it's appropriate.

Option J: Contact the client. That's not the right approach. They've already signed the release, so she shouldn't be complicit.

So, looking at all the options, the correct approach is to send the file directly. So the answer should be I.

The correct action is to send the file directly. This is appropriate as it's in compliance with privacy laws and secure. 

Answer: I: send the entire file digitally to the psychologist as requested.
