Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the sum of all integer solutions to the inequality |n| < |n-3| < 9. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably break down the compound inequality into two separate inequalities: |n| < |n-3| and |n-3| < 9. That way, I can solve each part separately and then find the intersection of the solutions.

Let me start with the first part: |n| < |n-3|. I remember that absolute value inequalities can sometimes be tricky, but I think there's a way to square both sides to get rid of the absolute values, which might make it easier to handle. So I'll square both sides:

(|n|)^2 < (|n-3|)^2

Which simplifies to:

n² < (n - 3)²

Expanding the right side: (n - 3)² = n² - 6n + 9.

So now the inequality is:

n² < n² - 6n + 9

Subtract n² from both sides to simplify:

0 < -6n + 9

Which can be rearranged as:

6n < 9

Divide both sides by 6:

n < 9/6 → n < 3/2.

So from the first part, n has to be less than 3/2. But wait, n is an integer, so n can be ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 2.5, etc. But since n must be an integer less than 1.5, the possible integer values are n ≤ 1.

Wait, no, 3/2 is 1.5, so n must be less than that, so integers less than 1.5 are n ≤ 1.

Wait, let me think again: n < 1.5. So n can be 1, 0, -1, -2, etc., but wait, n can't be 2 because 2 is not less than 1.5. Wait, no. Wait, 2 is 2, which is greater than 1.5, so the inequality n < 1.5 would exclude 2. So n can be any integer less than 1.5. So possible integers are n ≤ 1.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here because when I squared both sides I might have lost some information. Let me think: the inequality |a| < |b| implies that a² < b², but it's possible that a and b can have opposite signs, which complicates things. Alternatively, maybe I should approach this differently.

Another approach could be to consider the function f(n) = |n| - |n-3|. When is this function positive, i.e., when |n| > |n-3|? Let's think about where n is on the number line.

The critical points are at n=0 and n=3. So, for n < 0, both |n| and |n-3| are positive, but |n| is larger than |n-3| perhaps? Let me test with n=-1: |n| is 1, |n-3|=4. So 1 < 4, which satisfies |n| < |n-3|. Hmm, so n < 0 may not satisfy the inequality.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch the number line. Let's consider different intervals for n:

1. n < 0: Here, |n| = -n, and |n-3| = -(n-3) = -n +3. So |n| < |n-3| becomes -n < -n +3 → 0 <3, which is always true. So all n <0 satisfy |n| < |n-3|.

Wait, wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Let me test n=-1: |n|=1, |n-3|=4. 1 <4 is true. What about n=1: |n|=1, |n-3|=2. 1 <2 is true. So n=1 is allowed.

Wait, but earlier I thought that n < 3/2, which is 1.5, so n=1 is allowed. But if n=2, |n|=2, |n-3|=1. 2 <1 is false, so n=2 is not allowed.

Wait, but the first part of the inequality allowed n <1.5, which makes sense because when n=1.5, |n| = |n-3|, so the inequality is strict.

So, for the first inequality, n < 1.5. But since n is an integer, n can be any integer less than 1.5, i.e., n ≤1.

So the first inequality |n| < |n-3| holds for n ≤1.

But wait, let me double-check for n=1.5, which is 3/2. Let me check n=1.5: |1.5| =1.5, |1.5-3|=1.5, so they're equal, which doesn't satisfy the strict inequality. So n must be less than 1.5, so n ≤1.

Now, moving on to the second inequality: |n-3| <9.

That's straightforward: |n-3| <9 implies that -9 < n-3 <9.

Adding 3 to all parts: -6 <n <12.

So combining both inequalities:

From the first part, n ≤1.

From the second part, n > -6 and n <12.

So overall, n must satisfy both n ≥-6 and n ≤1.

But since n is an integer, the possible values are n =-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1.

Wait, let me list all integers between -6 and 1, inclusive: -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1.

Wait, but wait. The first inequality was n <1.5, so n can be up to 1, but including 1. So all those integers are included.

Wait, but I should verify if each of these integers actually satisfies both inequalities.

Wait, no, because the first part was |n| < |n-3|, which for n=1:

|1|=1, |1-3|=2 → 1 <2, which is true.

So all n ≤1 are allowed, but also, the second part restricts n to be greater than -6, but since n is an integer, the lower bound is n ≥-5 because n must be greater than -6, so n can be -5, -4, etc.

Wait, hold on: the second inequality is |n-3| <9 → -9 <n-3 <9 → n> -6 and n<12.

But n is an integer, so n must be ≥-5 (since n must be greater than -6, so the smallest integer is -5) and n ≤1.

So possible integer values of n are -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1.

Wait, but let me check if each of these integers satisfies the first inequality, |n| < |n-3|.

So for each n in this list:

n=-5: |n|=5, |n-3|=8 →5 <8 → true.

n=-4: |n|=4, |n-3|=7 →4<7 → true.

n=-3: |n|=3, |n-3|=6 →3<6 → true.

n=-2: |n|=2, |n-3|=5 →2<5 → true.

n=-1: |n|=1, |n-3|=4 →1<4 → true.

n=0: |n|=0, |n-3|=3 →0 <3 → true.

n=1: |n|=1, |n-3|=2 →1 <2 → true.

So all these n values satisfy both inequalities.

Now, the question asks for the sum of all integer solutions. So I need to add up -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1.

Let me compute the sum step by step.

Start with -5 + (-4) = -9.

Add (-3): -9 + (-3) = -12.

Add (-2): -12 + (-2) = -14.

Add (-1): -14 + (-1) = -15.

Add 0: -15 +0 = -15.

Add 1: -15 +1 = -14.

So the total sum is -14.

Looking at the options, option F is -14.

Wait, but I should double-check the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to calculate the sum of an arithmetic series.

The integers from -5 to 1 inclusive. Let's see how many terms there are.

From -5 to 1: that's 7 terms. The sequence is -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1.

Sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms) × (first term + last term) / 2.

Number of terms: from -5 to 1 is 7 terms.

First term: -5, last term:1.

Sum = 7 × (-5 +1)/2 = 7 × (-4)/2 = 7 × (-2) = -14.

Yep, that's correct.

So the answer should be F: -14.
