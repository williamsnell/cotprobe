Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Keynesian economics and why they changed their minds after being rejected. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Okay, the question is asking why Keynesians changed their minds and included both monetary and fiscal policy as options after being rejected. The options are A through J, with each being a different reason.

First, I remember that Keynesian theory was mainly focused on the role of government spending and investment in the economy. He was concerned about the stickiness of prices and the importance of full employment. But he was rejected for some reason. What was that reason again?

Wait, I think it was because of the limitations of his earlier work. He tried to address some issues but didn't cover all aspects. Oh right, he wasn't convinced that the government could fix the economy because money was a bit sticky. So he thought fiscal policy alone might not be sufficient.

But why did he change his mind and include both? Maybe because he realized that the government could help, but considering the limitations of money. So he combined fiscal and monetary policies. So the reason would be about combining these two methods.

Looking at the options:
A: Monetarism influencing Keynesians. I think that's more about the oppositeâ€”monetarists focused on money supply, while Keynes was more on fiscal. So probably not A.

B: Unavailability of empirical research. That's more about whether data existed. But I don't think Keynesian was stuck on that. He did conduct some empirical work, but maybe he didn't see the full picture.

C: Technological issues. That's about technological changes, but I don't recall the connection between money supply and economic stagnation. Like, if money was stuck, but that's more about income and prices.

D: New economic theory replacing Keynesian. So if he thought there was a better theory, he might have dismissed his own approach. But I don't think that's the main reason.

E: Fiscal policy ineffective during high inflation. Hmm, perhaps he thought fiscal was bad for inflation, so he didn't believe it would work. But why did he change his mind? Maybe because he didn't accept fiscal's effectiveness but did think it could help.

Wait, another angle: Maybe he realized that fiscal and monetary policies could complement each other. So when he was rejected, he thought it would be better to combine them. So the answer is about combining both, which would make E an option. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about why he changed his mind. Why did he think that including both was better. So when he was rejecting one, he realized he needed both. So the reason is about combining the two.

Looking at the options:
E says the discovery of a new theory. Hmm, perhaps that he didn't believe in that theory, so he was skeptical of his own approach, leading him to try combining. Alternatively, maybe he thought fiscal was ineffective, but realized that it worked when combined with monetary.

Wait, another thought. Maybe he thought that fiscal alone was ineffective because of money's stickiness. So, when money supply didn't change much (like in a period of high inflation), he thought fiscal alone couldn't help. But he changed his mind and realized that combining them (monetary and fiscal) would work better.

So the answer would relate to combining both methods. Looking at the options, E is about the effectiveness of fiscal policy, but perhaps the main reason is that he was convinced that including both was better.

Wait, another alternative: Maybe he thought that fiscal alone was ineffective, but he realized that it's only one part of the puzzle when combined with monetary. So in that case, the main reason would be about combining both, which isn't directly listed except for E perhaps, but E is about the effectiveness of fiscal.

Wait, but the question is why did they change their minds and include both. So considering that he was initially focused on fiscal, perhaps he realized that fiscal was ineffective and thus decided to include both.

So the correct answer might be E: The discovery of a new economic theory that replaced Keynesian economics. Wait, no, E is about fiscal policy's ineffectiveness, but that was his initial worry.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is E. Because he thought fiscal alone wouldn't work, so he tried combining it with monetary.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E. Because when he thought fiscal alone was ineffective, he decided to include both.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps he thought that fiscal alone couldn't address the issues, so he changed his mind and tried combining both. So the answer is that he realized fiscal alone was ineffective and thus decided to include both.

So among the options, E says the discovery of a new theory that replaced Keynesian. If that theory didn't exist, he was skeptical. So perhaps he thought that the new theory was the way to go, but he wasn't convinced. But why did he change his mind? Maybe because he dismissed his own approach.

Wait, perhaps the real reason is that he thought that fiscal alone was ineffective, so he changed his mind and concluded that both were needed. So the answer would be about the ineffective nature of fiscal.

So I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the options again.

Option E: The discovery of a new economic theory that replaced Keynesian economics.

If that happened, he might have dismissed his own approach, thinking the new theory was better. But the question is why he changed his mind, so it's more about combining the methods.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reason was that money was becoming more sticky. So he thought that without a change in money supply, fiscal alone couldn't be effective because the money wouldn't change much. So he thought both were needed.

So the correct answer would be E, because he thought fiscal alone was ineffective, but when combined with monetary, it works.

Wait, but the options don't specify that. So the correct answer is probably E. Because he thought fiscal alone was ineffective, so he changed his mind and decided to include both.

Alternatively, another angle: Maybe he realized that fiscal alone isn't enough because of the money stickiness. So when money supply changes, he thought fiscal alone could drive the economy, but he realized that if money isn't changing, fiscal alone isn't enough. So he changed his mind and thought both were needed.

So in that case, the answer would be E, because the discovery of a new theory (maybe the idea that fiscal alone isn't enough) led him to think both are needed.

Wait, but the question says why did they change their minds and include both. So considering that he was initially focused on fiscal, perhaps he realized fiscal alone was ineffective and thus decided to include both.

So the correct answer is E: The discovery of a new economic theory that replaced Keynesian economics. But wait, if he dismissed his own approach, that might not be the reason. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E because he thought that fiscal alone was ineffective, so he tried combining it with monetary policy. So the reasoning is that fiscal alone didn't work, but combining with money did.

So the correct answer would be E.

The question asks why Keynesians changed their minds after being rejected, leading them to include both monetary and fiscal policy as options. The correct reasoning involves recognizing the limitations of fiscal policy, particularly the stickiness of money, which made fiscal policy ineffective during periods of high inflation. By including both fiscal and monetary policies, they sought to address the underlying issues of money supply and its impact on economic stability. 

Answer: E: The discovery of a new economic theory that replaced Keynesian economics.
