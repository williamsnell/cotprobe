Question:

Hart argues that secondary rules are 'power-conferring' but this seems unconvincing in the case of the rule of recognition because:

Options:

A: It is not a social rule.
B: It both confers power and imposes duties on judges to decide cases.
C: It is a primary rule, not a secondary rule.
D: It is applicable only in the case of federal constitutions.
E: It fails to specify the source of authority.
F: It does not confer power but only recognizes it.
G: It applies only in the case of unitary constitutions.
H: It is more of a procedural rule than a power-conferring rule.
I: It only imposes duties on judges without conferring power.
J: It confers power on the legislature, not the judiciary.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Hart's argument on secondary rules and how it applies to the rule of recognition. I'm a bit rusty on my legal studies, but I'll try to think it through.

First, Hart's argument about secondary rules is where he argues that they are more nuanced than primary rules. Primary rules are the foundational ones that directly affect the judiciary, like the Constitution. Secondary rules are things that the judiciary can't directly regulate, but they do influence how the judiciary operates. Examples include the rule of recognition, which Hart thinks is power-conferring.

The question is about why Hart's view is unconvincing in the case of the rule of recognition. So, Hart says it's a secondary rule, which confers power. But someone might argue that it's more of a procedural rule, not a power-conferring one. 

Looking at the options: 

Option H: "It fails to specify the source of authority." That makes sense. Hart's argument is that the rule of recognition doesn't clearly define who is responsible for it. If it's just a procedural rule, there's no indication of who is the authority. But if it's a power-conferring rule, it should specify who gets it.

Option J: "It confers power on the legislature, not the judiciary." Wait, no, Hart's main point is that the rule of recognition confers power on the judiciary. So J might be the opposite. But Hart is arguing it's a power-conferring rule, so J would be against him.

Option F: "It does not confer power but only recognizes it." That's a bit confusing. Hart's argument is that it confers power, but if someone says the opposite, that doesn't fit his argument. So F might be incorrect.

Option H seems to be the right answer because Hart's view hinges on whether the rule of recognition is power-conferring. If it's a procedural rule, then Hart's claim doesn't hold. Hart thinks it's power-conferring, but if it's procedural, then Hart's reasoning is invalid.

The other options don't fit. Option E is about being a primary rule, which it's not. Option C talks about primary vs. secondary, but Hart's argument is about the nature of the rule. Option B says it both confers power and imposes duties on judges, which is opposite of Hart's point. So, I'm leaning towards H being the correct answer.

The correct answer is H, as Hart argues the rule of recognition is power-conferring, but if it's not specified, Hart's argument is flawed.

Answer: H
