Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. It's about finding a recursive sequence y[n] based on some given initial conditions and a recurrence relation. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem says: y[1] = 3, y[0] = 2, and for n >= 2, y[n] - 3y[n-1] + 2y[n-2] = 0. So I need to find the correct sequence from the options provided.

First, I remember that a recurrence relation like this is a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients. The standard approach to solving such recursions is to find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for a recurrence relation like y[n] - a y[n-1] + b y[n-2] = 0 would be r² - a r + b = 0.

In this case, the coefficients are a=3 and b=2. So the characteristic equation should be r² - 3r + 2 = 0. Let me solve this quadratic equation.

r² -3r +2 =0. Let's factor it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 2 and add up to -3. Hmm, -1 and -2. So, (r-1)(r-2) =0. So the roots are r=1 and r=2.

So the general solution for the recurrence relation is y[n] = A (1)^n + B (2)^n. Because each root is a solution, and the general form is a linear combination of these.

Now, let's apply the initial conditions to find A and B.

Given y[0] = 2. Plugging n=0 into the general solution:

y[0] = A*(1)^0 + B*(2)^0 = A + B = 2. Equation 1: A + B = 2.

Next, y[1] =3. Plugging n=1:

y[1] = A*(1)^1 + B*(2)^1 = A + 2B =3. Equation 2: A + 2B =3.

Now, I have a system of two equations:

1) A + B = 2

2) A + 2B =3

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate A:

(A + 2B) - (A + B) = 3 - 2 → B =1.

Substituting B=1 into equation 1: A +1=2 → A=1.

So A=1 and B=1. Therefore, the general solution is y[n] =1*(1)^n +1*(2)^n =1 + 2^n.

Wait, but let me think about the options given. Let's compute the terms step by step to see what the sequence looks like.

n=0: y[0]=1 +2^0=1+1=2 (which matches the given condition).

n=1: y[1]=1+2^1=1+2=3 (also matches).

n=2: y[2]=1+2²=1+4=5.

n=3: y[3]=1+8=9.

n=4: y[4]=1+16=17.

n=5: y[5]=1+32=33.

Wait, but looking at the options, the user is asking for the sequence starting from n >=2.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. Let me look.

Option D says y[n] =3,5,9,... starting from n>=2. Because y[1]=3, y[2]=5, y[3]=9, etc. So that would match the general solution I found.

Wait, but looking at the options, each option lists y[n] starting at n=2.

Wait, the options are:

Option D: y[n] =3,5,9,...;n >=2.

But according to our solution, starting from n=0 it is 2,3,5,9,17, etc. So for n >=2, the sequence would be 5,9,17, etc.

Wait, wait, the general solution is y[n] =1 + 2^n. So for n=0, y=2; n=1, y=3; n=2, y=5; n=3, y=9; n=4, y=17; n=5, y=33. So the sequence is 2,3,5,9,17,33,... So for n>=2, the sequence is 5,9,17, etc. So looking for the option where starting at n=2, the terms are 5,9,17,...

Looking at the options:

Option A: y[2}=5,9,15,...

Option B:5,9,17,...

Option C: y[2}=2,5,9,...

Option D:3,5,9,...

Wait, option C starts with 2,5,9, which would be n=0,2,3. That doesn’t fit, because n >=2 starts at 2.

Wait, the options are for y[n] when n >=2.

Wait, the question says: find the sequence y[n] for n>=2. So each option lists y[2], y[3], etc. So for n >=2, the sequence starts at y[2].

So in the general solution, for n >=2, y[2] =5, y[3]=9, y[4]=17, etc.

So the sequence starting at n=2 is 5,9,17,33,65,...

Looking at the options, which one starts with 5,9,17?

Option B says y[n]=5,9,17,... starting at n=2. So that would mean option B is the correct choice.

The problem involves finding the sequence \( y[n] \) defined by the recurrence relation \( y[n] - 3y[n-1] + 2y[n-2] = 0 \) with initial conditions \( y[1] = 3 \) and \( y[0] = 2 \). To solve this, we first find the characteristic equation:

\[
r^2 - 3r + 2 = 0
\]

Solving this quadratic equation, we get the roots \( r = 1 \) and \( r = 2 \). Thus, the general solution is:

\[
y[n] = A(1)^n + B(2)^n
\]

Using the initial conditions to determine \( A \) and \( B \):

1. For \( n = 0 \):
   \[
   y[0] = A + B = 2
   \]
2. For \( n = 1 \):
   \[
   y[1] = A + 2B = 3
   \]

Solving this system of equations, we find \( A = 1 \) and \( B = 1 \). Therefore, the general solution is:

\[
y[n] = 1 + 2^n
\]

For \( n \geq 2 \), substituting values gives:
- \( y[2] = 1 + 2^2 = 5 \)
- \( y[3] = 1 + 2^3 = 9 \)
- \( y[4] = 1 + 2^4 = 17 \)
- \( y[5] = 1 + 2^5 = 33 \)

Thus, the sequence for \( n \geq 2 \) is \( 5, 9, 17, 33, \dots \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is **Option B**, which lists \( y[n] = 5, 9, 17, \dots \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
