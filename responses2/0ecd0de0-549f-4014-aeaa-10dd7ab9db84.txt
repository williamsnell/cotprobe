Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A business purchased a computer from a seller's web site. The purchase form had a prominent hyperlink connection to a page that contained "important additional terms and conditions of sale," but the purchaser did not access that page. The delivered product included the additional terms in writing, along with a bold-lettered notice requiring the purchaser to return the product within 30 days if it did not accept the stated terms and conditions. After 35-days, the business became dissatisfied with the computer, and sued the seller for breach of contract. The seller demanded that the dispute be decided by private arbitration as per the additional terms and conditions to the agreement. Is the purchaser legally bound to participate in arbitration?

Options:

A: No, because federal law requires that a company give 90 days for return and the 30-day provision was null and void.
B: No, because there was no contract formed due to the purchaser's lack of assent to the additional terms and conditions.
C: Yes, because by not returning the computer within 30 days, the purchaser was bound to the additional terms and conditions that were a part of the contract.
D: Yes, because the seller provided the additional terms and conditions in writing with the delivered product.
E: No, because the purchaser did not explicitly agree to the terms and conditions that include private arbitration.
F: Yes, because the purchaser was aware of the additional terms and conditions, despite not accessing them.
G: No, because the seller did not clearly communicate the additional terms and conditions to the purchaser.
H: Yes, because the additional terms and conditions were part of the contract, regardless of whether the purchaser read them or not.
I: No, because the seller did not obtain explicit consent from the purchaser for the additional terms and conditions.
J: Yes, because federal law requires that arbitration must be used to attempt an initial resolution with respect to sales that take place on the internet.

Okay, so I'm looking at this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically about whether the purchaser is legally bound to participate in arbitration. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The scenario is that a business purchased a computer from a seller. The purchase form had a hyperlink to a page with additional terms, but the purchaser didn't click on it. The delivered product included those terms in writing, and there was a return requirement within 30 days. The business sued the seller for breach of contract, and the seller agreed to arbitration based on the additional terms and conditions.

The question is whether the purchaser is legally bound to participate in arbitration. The options are from A to J, each offering a different reason.

First, I need to recall the key points of contract law regarding return clauses and arbitration.

1. **Return Clauses in Contracts**: Generally, a contract typically requires payment and sometimes a return of goods if the seller fails to meet a condition. However, some contracts explicitly state that a certain condition must be met before the goods are returned. If the contract doesn't specify the return condition, the seller is often required to provide a return unless there's a mutual agreement that the buyer isn't obligated to return.

2. **Breach of Contract**: If the seller breached the contract by not fulfilling the return condition, the purchaser might sue. But the question is whether the purchaser is bound to arbitrate.

3. **Arbitration in Sales on the Internet**: Federal law often requires that the seller provide a 90-day return period if there's no agreement specifying otherwise. If the seller didn't provide this, the contract might be null and void. However, if the seller agreed to arbitration automatically, perhaps because the additional terms were part of the contract, then the purchaser might not need to participate in a separate arbitration clause.

4. **Additional Terms and Conditions**: The extra terms were included in the delivery, so the purchaser was aware of them. The seller's obligation to arbitration these terms would be if the terms are part of the contract and the seller is required to arbitrate them regardless of whether the purchaser read them.

Looking at the options:

A: "No, because federal law requires that a company give 90 days for return and the 30-day provision was null and void." Hmm. If the contract didn't specify return, federal law might require 90 days. But the question states that the purchaser did not access the page. But the contract didn't mention a return condition, so maybe the contract was void because there was no return condition. So the seller may not have had the right to arbitration unless the contract was valid. But I'm not sure if this applies here.

B: "No, because there was no contract formed due to the purchaser's lack of assent to the additional terms and conditions." This seems incorrect because the terms were included in the delivery. As part of the contract, they were part of the agreement.

C: "Yes, because by not returning the computer within 30 days, the purchaser was bound to the additional terms and conditions that were a part of the contract." Wait, the contract already included the return condition. So the purchaser was already obligated to return the product, so they weren't bound by the terms. So this option says they are because returning within 30 days binds them. That doesn't make sense because the return condition was part of the contract.

D: "Yes, because the seller provided the additional terms and conditions in writing with the delivered product." The terms were included in the delivery, so yes, the purchaser was aware. But whether the seller is bound to arbitrate these terms depends on whether they were part of the contract that required arbitration.

E: "No, because the purchaser did not explicitly agree to the terms and conditions that include private arbitration." The terms were included in the delivery, so the purchaser did agree. So this is incorrect because the purchaser did agree to the terms.

F: "Yes, because the purchaser was aware of the additional terms and conditions, despite not accessing them." Well, they were aware, so this is true. But the question is about being bound to arbitration.

G: "No, because the seller did not clearly communicate the additional terms and conditions to the purchaser." The terms were included, so the seller did communicate. Incorrect.

H: "Yes, because the additional terms and conditions were part of the contract, regardless of whether the purchaser read them or not." The terms are part of the contract, so if the contract required arbitration, then yes. But the contract didn't require 90 days, so maybe the seller is not required to arbitrate. But in this question, the seller is offering arbitration as per the terms, so perhaps the terms themselves are part of the contract and require arbitration regardless.

Wait, but the contract might not have required arbitration, so the additional terms are not part of the contract. So the purchaser is bound to the contract by the terms, but if the contract required arbitration, perhaps the terms are part of the contract regardless.

Alternatively, the contract may have had a 90-day return period, making the contract void if the additional terms weren't included. But the question states that the terms were included, so the contract isn't void.

Wait, the situation is that the seller had a contract with the purchaser. The delivery included the terms, and the contract may have required the purchaser to return within 30 days (a condition). So the contract may have been that the purchaser must return the product within 30 days. The seller's obligation to arbitration is tied to whether the contract required it.

But the contract in this case includes the additional terms. So the contract probably required the purchaser to return, making the contract enforceable. So the seller is required to arbitration because the contract itself requires it.

But the options are about whether the purchaser is bound to participate. So if the contract was valid, the seller must arbitrate. But the purchaser was aware, but does that mean they're bound to arbitrate?

Wait, the purchaser didn't access the page, but the contract included the return condition. So the purchaser was bound to return if the contract requires it. But the contract may have required the return, so the purchaser was already bound by it.

But option C says the purchaser was bound because returning within 30 days binds them. So if the contract required the return (even though the terms were included), then they were bound. But this depends on whether the contract was valid.

Alternatively, if the contract didn't require a return, then the seller may not have been required to arbitrate, but the question says the seller did because the terms were included.

Wait, the question says the seller agreed to arbitration based on the terms. So whether the contract required arbitration or not is a separate issue. If the contract itself didn't require arbitration, then the purchaser may not have to participate in it.

But in this case, the terms were included, so the return condition was part of the contract. So the contract requires the return, so the purchaser was bound to return if they didn't comply. But that doesn't affect whether the purchaser has to arbitrate, because they were already bound by the contract.

Wait, the question is about being bound to participate in arbitration. So the purchaser's obligation to return (if the contract requires it) is their main obligation, but whether they're bound to arbitrate depends on whether the contract requires it.

If the contract required the return, then the purchaser's obligation is part of the contract, so the seller is bound to arbitrate. But if the contract didn't require the return, the purchaser isn't bound to arbitrate.

But the question says that the seller agreed to arbitration, which suggests that the contract required it. So in this case, the purchaser is bound to participate in arbitration because the contract required it.

Wait, but option C says the purchaser is bound because returning within 30 days binds them. That's correct because if the contract requires the return, then the purchaser was bound to do so, but does that mean they're required to arbitrate?

Wait, maybe the purchasing obligation (returning) is a part of the contract, so the contract itself required arbitration. Alternatively, the contract may have required arbitration regardless of the return condition.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The key points are:

1. The contract includes a return condition (the 30-day return period).
2. The purchaser was unaware of this condition, but the delivery included it.
3. So the contract likely requires the purchaser to return, as it's part of the contract.
4. Therefore, the contract was enforceable.
5. The seller is then required to arbitrate because the contract requires it.
6. Arbitration is a form of dispute resolution outside of court.

So, if the contract requires arbitration, then the purchaser is bound to participate. Therefore, the answer may be H: Yes, because the additional terms and conditions were part of the contract, regardless of whether the purchaser read them or not.

Wait, but the issue is whether the purchaser is bound to participate in arbitration because the contract itself required it. So the correct answer would be that the purchaser is bound to participate because the contract requires arbitration.

But looking at the options, option H says yes, because the terms were part of the contract. That seems correct.

Alternatively, option C says yes because returning within 30 days binds them. So returning is part of the contract, so the purchaser is bound to return. But does that mean they're bound to arbitrate? Or is it that the contract itself required arbitration, perhaps making option H the correct answer.

Wait, the question is whether the purchaser is bound to participate in arbitration, not whether they must return. So if the contract requires arbitration, the purchaser is bound. So the correct answer would be H.

But option C says yes because returning within 30 days binds them. That's correct, but does that mean the purchaser is bound to arbitrate?

Wait, maybe the contract included the return condition, so the purchaser was already bound to return, and hence, the seller is bound to arbitrate. So their obligation is a part of the contract, so the contract requires arbitration.

In that case, the purchaser is bound to participate in arbitration. So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but the options are whether the purchaser is bound to participate. So if the contract requires arbitration, then the purchaser is bound to participate.

Therefore, I think that option H is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because option C is also correct. Let me re-examine.

Option C: Yes, because by not returning the computer within 30 days, the purchaser was bound to the additional terms and conditions that were a part of the contract.

But the contract already included the return condition. So the purchaser was bound to return if they didn't. So not returning is their obligation. But does that mean they're bound to arbitrate? Or is it that the contract itself required arbitration, so the purchaser is bound.

Hmm.

Alternatively, the contract didn't require arbitration. So the seller's obligation to arbitration is separate. So the purchaser may not have to participate in arbitration because the contract didn't require it.

But the question says the seller did not access the page and the terms were included, so the contract included the return condition, which might require arbitration. So the purchaser was bound to return, hence the contract required arbitration.

But the question is about participation in arbitration, not return. So even if the contract required arbitration, the purchaser was already bound by the terms, which include the return condition.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the contract was valid because the seller was required to provide a return period without the terms, but in this case, the terms were included, so the contract may have been valid.

But regardless, the main point is whether the purchaser is bound to participate in arbitration. 

The correct answer is H: Yes, because the additional terms and conditions were part of the contract, regardless of whether the purchaser read them or not. But wait, that's not correct because the contract already included the return condition, which is a part of the contract.

Alternatively, option C: Yes, because the purchaser was bound to return. But that's not about arbitration.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H. Because the contract required arbitration, so the purchaser is bound to participate.

But I'm getting mixed up. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: Yes, because by not returning the computer within 30 days, the purchaser was bound to the additional terms.

But the 30-day return period is part of the contract, which includes the terms. So the purchaser was bound to return if they didn't. But the contract might have required arbitration. So the purchaser was already bound to return, so they are bound to participate in arbitration.

Alternatively, whether the contract required arbitration is not the same as whether the purchaser is bound to arbitrate.

Wait, the contract may have required the return condition, which is part of the contract. So the contract itself required arbitration. Therefore, the purchaser is bound to arbitrate because the contract requires it.

So the correct answer is H: Yes, because the additional terms and conditions were part of the contract, regardless of whether the purchaser read them or not.

Wait, but the contract's terms included the return condition, so the contract was part of the contract, meaning that the purchaser was bound to the terms, including the return condition. So the contract required arbitration, so the purchaser is bound to participate.

Alternatively, perhaps the contract didn't require arbitration, but the seller agreed to arbitration regardless of the terms, so the purchaser is bound to participate.

I'm a bit stuck. Let's think about what the options imply.

Option C says the purchaser was bound because returning within 30 days binds them. So that's correct because if return is required, the purchaser is bound to do so, but does that mean they're bound to arbitrate?

Probably not, but maybe in that case, the contract required arbitration. So the answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H because the contract included the return condition, so the purchaser is bound to participate in arbitration.

So I think the correct answer is H: Yes, because the additional terms and conditions were part of the contract, regardless of whether the purchaser read them or not.

Wait, but the contract did include the terms, so the purchaser was already bound to return, but the contract itself required arbitration, so the purchaser was bound to participate.

Alternatively, perhaps the contract didn't require arbitration, so the purchaser isn't bound to arbitrate. But in this case, the terms were included, making the contract valid. But the question says the seller agreed to arbitration as per the terms, which suggests that the contract required it.

I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe the correct answer is H: Yes, because the additional terms and conditions were part of the contract, regardless of whether the purchaser read them or not.

Wait, but the contract already includes the return condition. So the contract is valid, which would mean the seller is required to arbitrate. So the purchaser is bound to participate.

So the correct answer is H: Yes, because the additional terms and conditions were part of the contract, regardless of whether the purchaser read them or not.

But that's not the case because the 30-day return is part of the contract. So the contract required arbitration, so the purchaser is bound to participate.

Wait, I'm going around in circles. Let's look for the correct answer.

The correct answer is H: Yes, because the additional terms and conditions were part of the contract, regardless of whether the purchaser read them or not.

Alternatively, if the contract didn't require arbitration, but the terms were included, then the contract was valid. The seller was bound to arbitrate. But the question says the seller agreed to arbitration as per the terms, so the contract required it.

So the correct answer is H: Yes, because the additional terms and conditions were part of the contract, regardless of whether the purchaser read them or not.

Wait, but the contract included the return condition, so the purchaser was already bound. So the answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the contract included the return condition, so the purchaser was bound to return. But that doesn't imply arbitration participation. However, the question is about being bound to participate in arbitration, which might be a separate issue.

But the options are whether the purchaser is bound to participate in arbitration. So if the contract required arbitration, then the purchaser is bound to participate.

I think the correct answer is H, but I'm not 100% confident.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the purchaser is legally bound to participate in arbitration after purchasing a computer and failing to return it within 30 days, despite the seller's inclusion of additional terms in the contract. The key points are the enforceability of the contract and the obligation to arbitration.

1. **Contract Inclusion of Terms**: The additional terms and conditions were included in the delivery of the product, making them part of the contract. The purchaser was aware of these terms, so they were bound to return the product if they failed to comply.

2. **Return Condition**: The contract likely required a 30-day return period. The purchaser was unaware of this condition, so they were not obligated to return the product. However, the terms were included, meaning the contract itself required the return, making the purchaser bound to comply with it.

3. **Arbitration Requirement**: The seller agreed to arbitration as per the additional terms and conditions. If the contract itself required arbitration, the purchaser was bound to participate. Since the terms were included, the contract likely required arbitration, making the purchaser legally bound to arbitrate.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **A**: Incorrect. The contract required a return, so the purchaser was not bound by the terms.
   - **B**: Incorrect. The terms were included, so the purchaser was aware.
   - **C**: Incorrect. The purchaser was bound by the terms, but this does not automatically mean they are bound to arbitrate.
   - **D**: Incorrect. The terms were included, so the purchaser was aware.
   - **E**: Incorrect. The contract included the return condition, so the purchaser was bound by it.
   - **F**: Incorrect. The purchaser was aware of the terms, so this is irrelevant.
   - **G**: Incorrect. The seller communicated the terms, so participation in arbitration is not the issue.
   - **H**: Correct. The terms and conditions were part of the contract, and the contract likely required arbitration, making the purchaser legally bound to participate.

ANSWER: H
