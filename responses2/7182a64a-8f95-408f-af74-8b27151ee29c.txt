Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The Chinese are all infidels: they worship images, and burn their dead just like the [Hindus]. The King of China is a Tartar, and one of the descendants of [Ghenghis] Khan…In all the Chinese provinces, there is a town for the [Muslims], and in this they reside. They also have cells, colleges, and mosques, and are made much of by the Kings of China…
When we approached this city [of Hangzhou] we were met by its judge, the [elders] of Islamism, and the great merchants. The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall. In the first reside the guards, with their commander. I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand…In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city. Their streets are well disposed, and their great men are exceedingly wealthy. There are in the city a great number of [Muslims], with some of whom I resided for fifteen days; and was treated most [honorably]…"

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the differences between the Chinese and Mongol administration periods. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question gives an extract from a text about the Chinese, which talks about their religious practices, policies, and the city of Hangzhou. The text mentions that in China, Muslims and other religious groups are present, and the Chinese government has structures like bulls (dams) and a centralized government. It also mentions that the Mongol administration in Russia from 600 CE to 1450 CE had a different approach.

The question is asking what the Mongol administration in Russia (not China) differed from the Chinese in terms of their policies. The options are A to J, each making a statement about their policies, social structures, religious practices, etc.

I remember that the Mongol Empire was known for their centralized administrative structures. They had a unified government, which was different from the Chinese, which had a more decentralized system. The Chinese had a multiparty government, with various regions having their own kingdoms or provinces. The Mongol Empire, on the other hand, had a unified government with administrative divisions, which were more organized and centralized.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Isolation vs. trade. I don't think the Mongol Empire isolated regions. They were more of a unified nation, and there was a lot of trade. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Orthodoxy vs. many religions. I think the Mongol Empire was more tolerant of various religions, not just Orthodox. The Chinese were more rigid with their orthodoxy, so B might not be right.

Option C: Traction vs. centralized bureaucratic. This seems correct. The Mongol Empire had a centralized system, while the Chinese had a more decentralized one.

Option D: Autonomy vs. direct control. The Mongol Empire was a unified state, so D is likely incorrect.

Option E: Islamic law vs. diverse religion. The Mongol Empire didn't implement Islamic law as we know it. They had a more loosely regulated system, and they encouraged various religious practices, not strict Islamic. So E might not be right.

Option F: Favorable subjects vs. unrest. The Mongol Empire had internal instability, like civil wars and internal strife. The Chinese had a more stable society. So F is probably wrong.

Option G: Decline vs. urban development. The Mongol Empire did have urban centers, like cities like Beijing, and they were very developed. The Chinese had cities too, but maybe a different focus.

Option H: No structure vs. well-defined structure. The Mongol Empire had a well-defined administrative structure, including the Centralized Government of the Empire. The Chinese had a fragmentation, with multiple regions and their own states.

Option I: Trade vs. control. The Chinese encouraged trade, but the Mongol Empire didn't impose strict control on Chinese trade, which was seen as a challenge. So I might be wrong.

Option J: Disregard vs. cultural integration. The Mongol Empire promoted cultural integration, but I'm not sure about that. The Chinese were more introverted and perhaps disintegrated, while the Mongol Empire encouraged integration.

So considering all that, the correct answer should be option C: relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, while the Mongol administration in China emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state. The Mongol Empire had a unified system, whereas China had a more decentralized one. So their policies would differ in this aspect.

The Mongol administration in Russia from 600 CE to 1450 CE differed from the Chinese in that it relied heavily on a centralized bureaucratic state, unlike the Chinese, which had a more decentralized and multiparty government.
