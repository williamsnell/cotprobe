Okay, so I need to figure out how to write 4 and 4 over 5 as an improper fraction. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. 

First, I remember that an improper fraction is a fraction where the numerator (top number) is greater than or equal to the denominator (bottom number). So, for example, 5/4 is an improper fraction because 5 is bigger than 4. 

Now, the question is asking to convert a mixed number, which is 4 and 4/5, into an improper fraction. Mixed numbers have a whole number part and a fractional part. So I need to combine these two parts into a single fraction.

Let me break it down. The whole number is 4, and the fraction is 4/5. To convert this, I think I need to multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction. So 4 multiplied by 5 equals 20. That gives me 20 over 5 from the whole number part.

Then, I add the numerator of the original fraction to this result. So 20 plus 4 equals 24. So the improper fraction should be 24 over 5. 

Let me double-check. 4 and 4/5 is the same as 4 + 4/5. Converting 4 to fifths gives me 20/5. Adding 20/5 and 4/5 gives 24/5. Yep, that makes sense. 

Looking at the options, option F is 24 over 5, which is what I got. So the correct answer should be F.

The correct answer is F: 24 over 5.

**Answer:** F: 24 over 5
