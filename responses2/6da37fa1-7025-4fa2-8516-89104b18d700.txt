Okay, so I've got this question about how many kcal are in one gram of ethanol. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with the exact numbers, but I remember that it's related to the enthalpy of combustion. Wait, ethanol's combustion is exothermic, right? So when ethanol burns, it releases a lot of heat. 

I think the key here is to look up the standard enthalpy of combustion of ethanol. Oh wait, wait, but the question is about calories, not kilojoules. So I need to convert between kJ and kcal. I remember that 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So to convert kJ to kcal, I can divide by that number.

I'm trying to recall the value. I'm pretty sure the standard enthalpy of combustion of ethanol is around 1367 kJ per mole. But wait, that's per mole, and the question is per gram. So I need to find the value per gram.

First, I should find the molar mass of ethanol. Ethanol is C2H5OH, so that's 2 carbons, 6 hydrogens, and one oxygen. Let me calculate that: carbon is 12.01 g/mol each, so 2 of them would be 24.02. Hydrogen is 1.008 each, so 6 * 1.008 = 6.048. Oxygen is 16.00. So total is 24.02 + 6.048 + 16.00 = 46.068 g/mol.

So the molar mass is approximately 46.07 g/mol. Now, the enthalpy per mole is 1367 kJ/mol. So per gram, it's 1367 kJ/mol divided by 46.07 g/mol.

Let me compute that. 1367 / 46.07 ≈ 29.7 kJ/g. Wait, but the question is about kcal. So to convert 29.7 kJ per gram to kcal, since 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ, I divide 29.7 by 4.184.

29.7 / 4.184 ≈ approximately 7.04 kcal per gram.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 29.7 kJ or 7.1 kcal per g. Option I is 33.3 kJ and 7.9. Hmm, but I think I did the math correctly, but maybe I should double-check.

Wait, another way: the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol is about 1367 kJ per mole. Let me find the exact value. Oh wait, I'm not sure about the exact number, but I think it's 1367 kJ/mol. So per gram, it's 1367 divided by 46.07, which is approximately 29.7 kJ/g.

Now, to convert that to kcal: 29.7 / 4.184 ≈ 7.04 kcal/g. So the options are looking for both kJ and kcal per gram.

Wait, the options are in two parts: for example, option H is 29.7 kJ and 7.1 kcal. Option I is 33.3 kJ and 7.9 kcal. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact value. Another source I remember says that the standard enthalpy of combustion of ethanol is about 1367 kJ/mol, which is correct. So 1367 / 46.07 ≈ 29.7 kJ/g. Then, 29.7 / 4.184 ≈ 7.04 kcal/g. So the closest option would be H: 29.7 kJ and 7.1 kcal.

But wait, let me make sure. Because sometimes the exact value might be slightly different. Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy is 1367 kJ/mol, which is about right. So 29.7 kJ/g is correct. Then, converting to kcal: 29.7 /4.184 is approximately 7.04, which would round to 7.1. So option H says 29.7 kJ or 7.1 kcal per gram. That must be the correct answer.

To determine how many kcal are in one gram of ethanol, we start by calculating the molar mass of ethanol (C₂H₅OH). The molar mass is:

- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol × 2 = 24.02 g/mol  
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol × 6 = 6.048 g/mol  
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol  

Total molar mass = 24.02 + 6.048 + 16.00 = 46.068 g/mol.

Next, we use the standard enthalpy of combustion of ethanol, which is approximately 1367 kJ/mol. To find the enthalpy per gram, we divide this value by the molar mass:

\[
\frac{1367 \, \text{kJ/mol}}{46.068 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 29.7 \, \text{kJ/g}.
\]

To convert this to kcal, we use the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ}\):

\[
\frac{29.7 \, \text{kJ/g}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal}} \approx 7.04 \, \text{kcal/g}.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the values are approximately 29.7 kJ and 7.1 kcal per gram. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct choice is:

**H: 29.7 kJ or 7.1 kcal per g.**
