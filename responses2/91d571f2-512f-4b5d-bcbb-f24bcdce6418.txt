Okay, let's tackle this question. The question is about Clovis points and which location they're not found in. I remember that Clovis points are related to the stock market, specifically the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). So, I need to figure out which of the given options isn't a place where the NYSE is located.

Looking at the options: A is Canada, B is Mexico, C is the continental United States, and D is Alaska. I know the NYSE is in New York, New York. Canada's stock exchanges are different, like the Toronto Stock Exchange. Mexico's stock market includes the Mexican Stock Exchange, but I'm not sure about points there. The continental U.S. has the NYSE, so that's a location they are found. Alaska is in the northern part of the U.S., but I don't think they have a stock exchange there. The NYSE is primarily in New York and New Jersey, so Alaska isn't the right place for Clovis points. 

Wait, but what about Mexico? I think the Mexican Stock Exchange (MEX) doesn't use Clovis points, but rather points from the Mexican Stock Exchange itself. So the NYSE is in Canada, Mexico, the U.S., and the U.S. territories. But the question is about Clovis points, which are NYSE. So the answer would be D: Alaska because they're not part of the NYSE.
