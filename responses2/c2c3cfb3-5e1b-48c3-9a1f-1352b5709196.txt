Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about group theory, specifically homomorphisms between groups. Hmm, I remember that a homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two groups. The key point is that the image of a group under a homomorphism is a subgroup of the target group.

Statement 1 says: The image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism may have 12 elements. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because the image of a group under a homomorphism must be a subgroup of the target group. So, the image's size, which is the order, can't exceed the order of the target group. 

But Statement 1 claims it can have 12 elements. If the source group has 6 elements, the image can't be larger than 6. So Statement 1 is false. 

Statement 2 says there is a homomorphism from a group of 6 elements into a group of 12 elements. Hmm. Let's think. The image must be a subgroup of the target group. The target group has 12 elements, so the image can have up to 12 elements. But wait, the source group is of order 6. So, the image of the source group under a homomorphism can't have more elements than the source group. So the image must divide the order of the source group, by Lagrange's theorem. So the image size must divide 6. Therefore, the image can have 1, 2, 3, or 6 elements. So Statement 2 is also false because it's claiming the image can be 12, which is impossible.

So both statements are false. Looking at the options, option B is False, False. So the answer should be B.

The image of a group under a homomorphism must be a subgroup of the target group. Statement 1 claims the image can be 12 when the source group has 6 elements, which is impossible because the image's size must divide 6. Statement 2 claims a homomorphism from a 6-element group to a 12-element group exists, but the image must divide 6, so it can only be 1, 2, 3, or 6. Both statements are false, so the answer is B.

Answer: B
