Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the interest rate needed to earn $12 on a $1,200 investment over 90 days. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my finance formulas, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the simple interest formula is I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate, and T is the time in years. But wait, sometimes people use different time periods, so I should make sure I'm using the right units here.

The question says 90 days. Since a year is 365 days, 90 days would be roughly 90/365 of a year. Let me calculate that. 90 divided by 365. Hmm, 365 divided by 10 is 36.5, so 90 is about 2.4658 times that. So, approximately 2.4658% of a year? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 90 days is 90/365 of a year, which is roughly 0.246575 of a year. So, T = 0.246575 years.

Wait, but sometimes in finance, especially with short-term loans, they might use exact dates or days between dates. Oh, right, in some cases, especially in exams, they might use exact number of days, but wait, 90 days is a standard period for things like Treasury bills, maybe. But I think the simple interest formula assumes time is in years. So, I'll proceed with T = 90/365.

So, I know I want the interest I to be $12. The principal P is $1,200. So, plugging into the formula: 12 = 1200 * R * (90/365). Let me solve for R.

Rearranging the formula: R = 12 / (1200 * (90/365)). Let's compute that step by step.

First, calculate 1200 * (90/365). Let's compute 90/365 first. 90 divided by 365 is approximately 0.246575. So 1200 * 0.246575 = 1200 * 0.246575. Let me compute 1200 * 0.246575.

Calculating that: 1200 * 0.2 is 240, 1200 * 0.04 is 48, 1200 * 0.006575 is approximately 7.89. So adding those up: 240 + 48 = 288, plus 7.89 is 295.89. So the denominator is approximately 295.89.

So R = 12 / 295.89 ≈ 0.04057, which is 4.057%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E: 2.5%, but that's lower. Option H is 7%, which is way higher. Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact fraction instead of an approximate. So 90/365 is exactly 18/73 (because 90 ÷5=18, 365 ÷5=73). So 12 = 1200 * R * (18/73).

So R = 12 / (1200 * (18/73)).

Which simplifies to R = (12 * 73) / (1200 * 18).

Let me compute numerator and denominator. Numerator: 12 *73. 12 *70 is 840, 12*3=36. So 840+36=876. Denominator: 1200 * 18 = 21,600.

So R = 876 / 21600. Let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 876 ÷12=73, 21600 ÷12=1800. So R =73/1800 ≈ 0.040555, which is approximately 4.056%. So about 4.06% interest rate.

Looking at the options, option H is 7%, which is higher than that. Option J is 4%, which is close. So perhaps the answer is J:4%.

Wait, but wait another moment. Did I use the correct time period? 90 days is a fraction of a year. Another possibility is that in some contexts, like in the context of simple interest with exact days, but I don't think that's the case here. I'm pretty sure the simple interest formula uses time as a fraction of a year based on the number of days in the year.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe it's a different formula, like simple interest with the number of days, but in that case, the time factor would be 90/365, which I've already considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different interest calculation method, like compound interest, but that's unlikely because the wording says "rate of interest" which typically refers to simple interest unless stated otherwise.

Wait, another approach: maybe the question expects the calculation to be based on a 360-day year, which is common in some financial calculations, but I don't think that's the case here. 90 days is still about 0.25 of a year, so that wouldn't change the calculation much. Let's see.

If I use 360 days, then T would be 90/360 = 0.25. So, R = 12/(1200 * 0.25) = 12/(300) =0.04, which is 4%. So again, 4% would be the rate.

So both 365-day and 360-day methods give the same R of approximately 4.056% or 4%, which is about 4%.

Looking at the options, option J is 4% and option H is 7%. So the closest is 4%, so the answer is J.

To determine the interest rate that produces $12 on $1,200 over 90 days, we use the simple interest formula \( I = P \times R \times T \). Here, \( I = 12 \), \( P = 1200 \), and \( T = \frac{90}{365} \).

Rearranging the formula for \( R \):
\[
R = \frac{I}{P \times T} = \frac{12}{1200 \times \frac{90}{365}}
\]
Calculating \( T \) as approximately 0.24658, the denominator becomes:
\[
1200 \times 0.24658 \approx 295.896
\]
Thus:
\[
R = \frac{12}{295.896} \approx 0.04056 \, \text{or} \, 4.056\%
\]
Considering the options provided:
- Option J: 4% is the closest to 4.056%.
