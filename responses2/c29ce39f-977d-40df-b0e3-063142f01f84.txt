Okay, so I've got this Laplace transform problem to solve. The question is asking for the inverse Laplace transform of 1 divided by [s(s² + 1)], and I need to use convolution. Hmm, right, I remember that convolution is involved with inverse Laplace transforms. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the function is 1/(s(s²+1)). I think I should break this into partial fractions first. So 1/(s(s²+1)) can be split into A/s + (Bs + C)/(s²+1). Let me compute that.

Multiplying both sides by s(s²+1), I get 1 = A(s² + 1) + (Bs + C)s. Expanding that, 1 = A s² + A + B s² + C s. Combining like terms: 1 = (A + B)s² + C s + A. 

Now, equating coefficients on both sides: the coefficient of s² is A + B, which must equal 0 because the left side has no s² term. The coefficient of s is C, which should be 0 because there's no s term on the left. The constant term is A, which equals 1. So A = 1, then B must be -1 (since A + B = 0 => B = -1). And C is 0. So the partial fractions are 1/s - (s)/(s² +1).

Wait, but how does that help with the inverse Laplace? Oh, right, the inverse Laplace of each term can be found separately. So L^{-1}[1/s] is 1, and L^{-1}[s/(s²+1)] is cos t. So the inverse transform should be 1 - cos t. But wait, the question says to use convolution. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to express the function as a convolution of two functions.

Wait, another approach: 1/(s(s²+1)) can be written as 1/s multiplied by 1/(s² +1). The inverse Laplace of 1/s is 1, and the inverse of 1/(s² +1) is sin t. So their convolution would be the integral from 0 to t of f(τ)g(t-τ) dτ. So f(t) is 1, g(t) is sin t. So convolution is integral from 0 to t of (1)*sin(t-τ) dτ. Which is ∫₀^t sin(t-τ) dτ. Let me compute that.

Let u = t-τ. When τ=0, u=t; when τ=t, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=t to 0 of sin u (-du) because the substitution. So ∫₀^t sin u du = [-cos u] from 0 to t = (-cos t) - (-cos 0) = -cos t + 1. So the convolution is 1 - cos t. So that's the same as the partial fractions method. 

Wait, but the options include 1 - cos t as option B. So that's the answer, right? But wait, the question says to use convolution. So maybe the question is expecting me to express it as a convolution, but the result is the same as the partial fractions. So the inverse Laplace is 1 - cos t, which is option B.

Wait, but let me think again. The inverse Laplace transform using convolution means that maybe the function is expressed as a product of two functions, and the inverse of their product is the convolution. But in this case, 1/(s(s²+1)) is the product of 1/s and 1/(s² +1). So the inverse is the convolution of their individual inverse functions. So f(t) = 1, g(t) = sin t. So the inverse Laplace is the convolution, which we found as 1 - cos t. So all right, that's consistent.

So the correct answer is option B: 1 - cos t.

To find the inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 1)} \) using convolution, we start by decomposing the function into partial fractions. We express \( \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 1)} \) as:

\[
\frac{1}{s(s^2 + 1)} = \frac{1}{s} - \frac{s}{s^2 + 1}.
\]

The inverse Laplace transforms of these terms are:

\[
\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{1}{s}\right\} = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{s}{s^2 + 1}\right\} = \cos t.
\]

Thus, the inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 1)} \) is \( 1 - \cos t \). To confirm this using convolution, we note that the inverse Laplace transform of a product of functions is the convolution of their inverse Laplace transforms. Here, \( \frac{1}{s} \) corresponds to \( f(t) = 1 \) and \( \frac{s}{s^2 + 1} \) corresponds to \( g(t) = \sin t \). The convolution is:

\[
f(t) * g(t) = \int_0^t f(\tau)g(t - \tau) d\tau = \int_0^t 1 \cdot \sin(t - \tau) d\tau.
\]

Using substitution \( u = t - \tau \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^t \sin u \, du = -\cos u \Big|_0^t = -\cos t + 1 = 1 - \cos t.
\]

Thus, the inverse Laplace transform is \( 1 - \cos t \), corresponding to option B.
