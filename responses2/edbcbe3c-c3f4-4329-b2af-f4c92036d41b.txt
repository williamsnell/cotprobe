Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about productivity, recreation hours, and wages. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

Alright, the problem says that productivity (P) is affected by the number of hours of recreation (r) and the wage (W). The relationship is given by the equation P = a*r + b*W. We have two surveys with different values for these variables.

In Survey 1, they found P = 170, r = 51, and W = 136. So plugging those into the equation, I get:
170 = a*51 + b*136. Let me write that as equation (1): 51a + 136b = 170.

In Survey 2, P is 425, r is 68, and W is 204. Plugging these in:
425 = a*68 + b*204. That's equation (2): 68a + 204b = 425.

Now I have a system of two equations with two variables (a and b). I'll need to solve them simultaneously.

Let me write down the equations again:

1) 51a + 136b = 170
2) 68a + 204b = 425

Hmm, maybe I can use the elimination method. Let's try to eliminate one variable. Let's see which would be easier to eliminate. Let's try to eliminate 'a' first.

To do that, I'll find the least common multiple (LCM) of 51 and 68. Let's factor them:

51 factors into 3*17.
68 factors into 4*17. So LCM is 4*3*17 = 204.

So I'll multiply equation (1) by 4 and equation (2) by 3 to make the coefficients of 'a' equal to 204.

Equation (1) *4: 204a + 544b = 680
Equation (2) *3: 204a + 612b = 1275

Now subtract equation (1)*4 from equation (2)*3 to eliminate 'a':

(204a + 612b) - (204a + 544b) = 1275 - 680
Which is: 68b = 595

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the calculations. Hmm, wait: 1275 - 680 is 595? Wait, 1275 minus 680: 1275 - 600 is 675, minus 80 is 595. So yes.

So 68b = 595 → b = 595 /68.

Let me compute that. 68 * 8 = 544. 595 -544 is 51. So 8 + 51/68 → which is 8.75. So b = 8.75.

Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express:

Wait, perhaps I should have used a different approach. Let me see if using substitution would be better.

From equation (1): 51a + 136b = 170. Let me solve for a in terms of b.

a = (170 - 136b)/51.

Then substitute into equation (2):

68*(170 - 136b)/51 + 204b = 425.

Hmm, let's compute this.

First, compute 68 * (170 - 136b) / 51. Let's see:

68/51 is approximately 1.333... which is 4/3. So 4/3*(170 - 136b) = (4/3)*170 - (4/3)*136b.

Compute 4/3 *170: 170 *4=680; 680/3≈226.666...

4/3 *136 = 544/3≈181.333...

Wait, let me compute 170 *4 = 680, so 680/3 is 226.666...

Similarly, 136 *4=544; 544/3≈181.333...

So (4/3)(170 -136b) = (680 -544b)/3.

So putting it back into equation (2):

(680 -544b)/3 + 204b = 425.

Multiply everything by 3 to eliminate denominators:

680 -544b + 612b = 1275.

Combine like terms:

680 + (612b -544b) = 1275 → 680 +68b = 1275.

Subtract 680 from both sides:

68b = 1275 -680 = 595.

So 68b=595 → b=595/68=8.75. So same result as before. So b=8.75.

Now plug this back into equation (1) to find a.

Equation (1):51a +136*(8.75)=170.

Compute 136 *8.75: Let's break it down. 136 *8=1088, 136*(0.75)=102. So total is 1088+102=1190.

So 51a +1190 =170 → 51a=170-1190= -1020 → a= -1020/51.

Dividing 1020/51: 51*20=1020 → 51*20=1020 → 1020/51=20. So a= -20.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, option H is a=-20, b=8.75. So that's one of the options.

Let me check the options again to see if this matches.

Option H: a = -20, b =8.75. So that's correct.

To determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \), we start with the given equations from the two surveys:

1. \( 51a + 136b = 170 \)
2. \( 68a + 204b = 425 \)

Using the elimination method, we first find the least common multiple (LCM) of 51 and 68, which is 204. We multiply the first equation by 4 and the second by 3 to align the coefficients of \( a \):

- Equation 1 multiplied by 4: \( 204a + 544b = 680 \)
- Equation 2 multiplied by 3: \( 204a + 612b = 1275 \)

Subtracting the first new equation from the second eliminates \( a \):

\[
(204a + 612b) - (204a + 544b) = 1275 - 680
\]

Simplifying:

\[
68b = 595 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = \frac{595}{68} = 8.75
\]

Substituting \( b = 8.75 \) into the first original equation:

\[
51a + 136(8.75) = 170
\]

Calculating \( 136 \times 8.75 = 1190 \):

\[
51a + 1190 = 170 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 51a = -1020 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = -20
\]

Thus, the values are \( a = -20 \) and \( b = 8.75 \), which corresponds to option H.
