Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here, and I need to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = e^x - c x, where c is greater than 0. Hmm, I remember that to find the minimum of a function, I should look for its critical points by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the function is f(x) = e^x - c x. I need to find its derivative because the critical points occur where the first derivative is zero or undefined. Since e^x is differentiable everywhere and so is the linear term, the derivative should exist everywhere, so I don't have to worry about that.

Taking the derivative of f(x) with respect to x, f'(x) should be the derivative of e^x minus the derivative of c x. The derivative of e^x is e^x, and the derivative of c x is just c, because c is a constant. So f'(x) = e^x - c.

To find the critical points, I set f'(x) equal to zero: e^x - c = 0. Solving for x, I get e^x = c. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, x = ln(c). So the critical point is at x = ln(c).

Now, to determine if this critical point is a minimum, I should check the second derivative. The second derivative of f(x) is the derivative of f'(x), which is e^x. Since e^x is always positive, the second derivative is positive at x = ln(c). That means the function is concave up there, so the critical point is indeed a minimum.

So the minimum value of f occurs at x = ln(c). Therefore, the value of f at this point is f(ln(c)).

Looking back at the options, I need to see which one is f(ln(c)). Let me check the options:

A: f(e^-c) — Not ln(c), probably not.
B: f(sqrt(c)) — Not ln(c).
C: f(log c) — Wait, log c is the same as ln(c) only if it's natural log. But log without a base is often base 10, but in math problems, it's usually base e. But wait, sometimes in calculus, log is natural. Hmm, but ln(c) is the same as log base e of c. So C would be f(ln(c)), which is the correct point.
Wait no, the options are written as f(log c), but maybe they're using log as natural log. Alternatively, perhaps it's written as log base 10, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the options are written as f(log c), but perhaps in this context, log c is the natural logarithm. So yes, C is f(ln c) which is the correct point.

Wait, another thought: wait, perhaps the options have other expressions that evaluate to the same minimum point. Let me check each option:

Option C is f(log c). If log c is the natural logarithm, then that's correct. But if log is base 10, then it's not ln(c). But in calculus, ln is the standard. So assuming that log c is natural log, then option C is correct.

But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me compute f at x = ln(c):

f(ln(c)) = e^{ln(c)} - c * ln(c) = c - c ln(c) = c(1 - ln c).

Wait, but looking at the options, I think the correct expression is f(ln c), which is option C. So why am I confused? Oh wait, alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me check all the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: f(e^-c)
B: f(sqrt(c))
C: f(log c)
D: f(-c)
E: f(e^c)
F: f(2c)
G: f(0)
H: f(c)
I: f(c^2)
J: f(1/c)

Wait, so option C is f(log c). If log c is natural log, that's correct. So perhaps the answer is C.

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the function. What is f(ln(c))? It's e^{ln c} minus c times ln c. e^{ln c} is c, so f(ln c) is c - c ln c = c(1 - ln c). That's the minimum value.

So the minimum value is f(ln c). So looking at the options, option C is f(log c). Assuming log c is ln c, then yes, option C is correct.

Wait, but let me look at the other options to see if any of them evaluate to the same point or if I made a mistake.

Option D is f(-c). Let's compute f(-c) = e^{-c} - c*(-c) = e^{-c} + c². That's definitely not the minimum.

Option G is f(0) = e^0 - c*0 = 1 - 0 =1. That's a possible value, but not the minimum.

Option C is f(ln c), which is the minimum. So I think the correct answer is C.

Wait, but wait, another thought: the options are A to J, and the question is about the minimum value of f, which is the value of f at x=ln c. So which option gives that.

So option C is f(log c). If log c is ln c, then yes. So option C is correct.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose log c refers to log base 10. Then log c is not equal to ln c. So unless the options are using ln c as log c, which is unusual, but possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses log as the natural logarithm, so option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the minimum value. Because I'm supposed to find the minimum value of f, not the x at which it occurs.

Wait, no, the question says, "the minimum value of f", not "the value of x where the minimum occurs". Wait, that's a crucial point. Wait, the options are functions evaluated at certain points, but maybe the question is asking for the value of f(x) at the minimum point.

Wait, the wording is: "the minimum value of f is...", which is the value of f at x=ln c. So yes, option C: f(log c) would be correct if log c is ln c.

But wait, perhaps the options are not using log as natural log. Let me recheck the problem.

The problem states: "the minimum value of f is..." and the options are functions evaluated at x = ..., so each option is the function f evaluated at a particular x.

Wait, that's a different question. So actually, the question is asking which of the options gives the value of f at the point where f has its minimum, which is at x = ln c.

So option C is f(log c) (assuming log c is natural log). Then yes, C is correct.

So the correct answer is C.
</think>

The function f(x) = e^x - c x has its derivative f'(x) = e^x - c. Setting f'(x) = 0 gives the critical point at x = ln(c). The second derivative f''(x) = e^x is positive, confirming a minimum at x = ln(c). Thus, the minimum value of f is f(ln(c)). Among the options, option C, which is f(log c) assuming log c is the natural logarithm, correctly represents the function evaluated at the minimum point.
