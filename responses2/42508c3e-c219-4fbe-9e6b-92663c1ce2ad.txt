Okay, so I need to answer this question about the major categories of human senses. The question is asking what the two main categories are based on what the senses gather from the outside world. Let me think about this.

I remember that the human senses are divided into two main groups. One of them deals with things we can see, like light and color. The other must be something different. Oh right, one is visual, and the other probably has to do with touch or something else.

Wait, the options given are A to J. Let me go through them. Option A is auditory and visual. Hmm, no, because auditory is about sound, not what you see. So A is probably not right.

Option B is internal and external. Internal sounds like things inside the body, and external is outside. But the senses gather from the outside, so maybe B isn't correct either.

Option C is tactile and olfactory. Oh, I think that's right. Tactile is about touch, and olfactory is about smell. Because these are both outside senses.

Option D: biological and physical. Hmm, biological refers to biology, which is the study of living things. Physical is about matter and energy. That doesn't directly classify the senses into two categories based on what they gather from the outside.

Option E: energy and chemical. No, that's more about what kind of information the senses process, not what they receive.

Option F: mechanical and thermal. These are types of motion and heat, not about what the senses detect.

Option G: bichromatic and trichromatic. Bichromatic is about vision, like color, and trichromatic is color vision in some animals, but I'm not sure if that's the main categories. The question is about the two major categories based on what they gather from the outside. I think trichromatic is more about vision, but I'm not certain.

Option H: conduction and transduction. Conduction is movement of signals, transduction is converting one form of energy to another. Not directly about what the senses detect.

Option I: sensation and perception. Sensation is the process of receiving information, and perception is the interpretation of that information. So the question is asking about the categories of the senses themselves, not the processes. So I is more about the types of information, not the senses.

Option J: proximal and distal. Proximal is close, distal is far. That's more about location, not about the senses themselves.

Wait, going back, the two main categories are visual and tactile. So the answer should be option C: tactile and olfactory.

Wait, wait, did I mix something up? Oh no, no. Let me think again. The other options for the categories:

Wait, I might be confusing with another question. Oh, another thought: the human senses are divided into two: one for light (visual) and one for touch (tactile). So the correct answer should be C: tactile and olfactory. Oh no, no, I'm mixing. Wait, option C is tactile and olfactory. So that's correct. So the answer is C.

The human senses are divided into two major categories based on what they gather from the outside world: tactile (touch) and olfactory (smell). These two categories are the correct answer.

Answer: C
