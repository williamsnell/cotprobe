Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about moral theories, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully. It says: "The idea of 'using someone as a mere means' is centrally relevant to which of the following moral theories?" The options are A through J, each corresponding to different theories.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is about a concept that's central to various ethical theories. The phrase "means as a mere means" makes me think of utilitarianism because that's about maximizing overall happiness or well-being, which is about the total effect. But wait, let me think about each option.

Option A: Utilitarianism. Utilitarians believe that the best action is the one that maximizes happiness or "good" for the greatest number. So they focus on the consequences of actions, not just the means. They would consider the end goal, not just the means. So using someone as a means would be seen as contributing to the overall good, which is part of utilitarianism's stance.

Option B: Kantianism. Kant's moral philosophy is deontological, meaning it's about duties and rules rather than consequences. He emphasizes the moral imperatives of actions, not just their outcomes. So he would probably say that you shouldn't use someone as a means, but that depends on their duty. I don't think this is the central aspect of Kantianism.

Option C: Egoism. That's another deontological theory. It focuses on individual self-interest and the intrinsic value of actions. So using someone as a means might not be a central issue; it's more about whether an action is good or bad based on what the individual does, not just the means involved.

Option D: Existentialism. This theory emphasizes individual freedom and the importance of respecting others' rights. It's about how actions affect others and the well-being of the community. Using someone as a means might not be central; instead, it's more about how one's actions impact others.

Option E: Natural Law Theory. This is about the idea that laws are naturally created, enforcing certain rules without rational reason. It's more about the consequences of human actions leading to natural laws, which is different from the idea of using someone as a means.

Option F: Virtue Ethics. This is about character and moral behavior, not just outcomes. So it's more about how one acts rather than the means used.

Option G: Relativism. This theory says that moral beliefs are relative to culture and context. So using someone as a means might not be a core concept here.

Option H: Divine Command Theory. This is about the commandments granted by God. It's more about what God deems right, not about the consequences of human actions.

Option I: Hedonism. This is about the highest good being the least bad, so actions are evaluated for their negative consequences. So using someone as a means would be seen as contributing to the overall good, which is part of hedonism's approach.

Option J: Consequentialism. This is about the end result. So using someone as a means would be seen as contributing to the overall outcome, which is central to this theory.

Wait, but the question is asking which theory centrally relates to the idea of using someone as a mere means. So both A and J seem relevant, but let's think about the options.

Wait, the question is which theory is central to using someone as a means. So, utilitarianism and consequentialism both focus on the outcome of actions. Utilitarianism (A) is about maximizing overall happiness, and consequentialism (J) is about the end result, which is about what the overall consequences are, so both are about the means contributing to the end.

Wait, but looking back, the question is a bit ambiguous because both A and J seem related. Let me think again. The question is phrased as "the idea of using someone as a mere means is centrally relevant to which of the following." So the concept is about using someone to achieve a good end.

In utilitarianism, the focus is on the total effect of actions, so using someone as a means would be seen as contributing to the overall good. Therefore, utilitarianism (A) is central to this idea.

Consequentialism, J, also focuses on the outcome. So both A and J are about the end result. But the question is about which theory is central to this. Wait, the options include multiple possible answers, but in the question, each option is a single choice. Oh, no, each option is a theory, and the question is which of these theories is the correct one.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each theory's focus. Utilitarianism is about the total effect, so it's about means contributing to ends. Consequentialism is about the consequences, which is about the ends. So both A and J are about the end. But the question is specifically about using someone as a means, which is about the means contributing to the end.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "is centrally relevant to," meaning which theory's moral framework includes this concept.

Wait, another angle: using someone as a mere means might be a key part of various theories. For example, utilitarianism includes this concept because they focus on the consequences (means) leading to the end. So, for example, the act of using a drug is seen as a means to an end (recovery), and the end is the overall good. So utilitarianism would consider the end and how the means contribute to it.

On the other hand, consequentialism also focuses on the end. So, both A and J are correct? But the options are single letters, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no. The options are single choices, so I think the answer is between A and J. But I'm a bit confused because both seem relevant. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: the question asks which theory is relevant. So the correct answer is either A or J. Now, looking at the options, the possible correct answers. The options are given as A to J, and the question is which is correct.

Wait, but I remember that I think the answer is J, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about each option again. The key is that the idea is about the means being used as a mere means to achieve an end. So both utilitarian and consequentialist focus on that. But perhaps the question is about which is a core concept.

Wait, another approach: the question is about the concept of using someone as a mere means. So in utilitarianism, you evaluate actions based on the overall effect (the end), so using someone as a means is part of that. For example, using a drug as a means to get better. So, in utilitarianism, you look at the end (better health) and the means (using the drug) as part of the evaluation.

Consequentialism, on the other hand, looks at the end result (health) from the consequences (using the drug). So both theories consider the end result, but the question is about the use of someone as a means.

Wait, perhaps the answer is J: Consequentialism, because it's about the consequences that lead to the end.

But wait, the options are multiple-choice, so I need to pick one. Let me think about the options again.

The question is about which theory is central to the idea that someone is used as a mere means. So, the correct answer is J, because in consequentialism, the focus is on the consequences of actions leading to the end. So, using someone as a means is a way of achieving that end through consequences.

On the other hand, utilitarianism is about maximizing overall happiness, which is the same as the end. So both are relevant.

Wait, but the options don't have both A and J as correct. The question must have only one correct answer. So perhaps I'm wrong, and the correct answer is J.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to remember what each theory emphasizes.

Utilitarianism: Focuses on the consequences of actions, aiming to maximize total happiness. So using someone as a means (e.g., a drug) is seen as contributing to the overall happiness (good) outcome.

Consequentialism: Focuses on the end result. So, using someone as a means would affect the outcome, which is the end.

So, both theories are about the end result. But the question is which theory is central to the idea. So perhaps both are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps the answer is J, because the question is about the end result. Alternatively, the answer could be A, utilitarianism.

Hmm, perhaps in the context of the question, the correct answer is J: Consequentialism.

Wait, another angle: when someone says "the idea of using someone as a mere means," it's about the means contributing to the end. So, in utilitarianism, the focus is on the end, so using means would be part of that. So A is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think about the key points. The concept of means as a mere means is a concept that's used in both utilitarianism and consequentialism.

Wait, perhaps the answer is J: Consequentialism. Because that's more about the consequences leading to the end, which would use someone as a means to achieve the end.

Wait, but another thought: the options include J as "Consequentialism." So perhaps that's the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought that both A and J are correct, but the options are single letters, so perhaps I'm missing something about the question.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the most accurate answer. Let me try to recall what I've learned before. The concept of using someone as a means is primarily central to consequentialism, where the focus is on the consequences. So the answer would be J: Consequentialism.

Alternatively, I might have the concepts inverted. Let me think about each theory again.

Utilitarianism (A): Focuses on the total good of the overall situation. So using someone as a means is part of maximizing overall happiness.

Consequentialism (J): Focuses on the end result. So using someone as a means leads to the end outcome, which is the end.

So the question is about which theory's moral framework includes the idea of using someone as a mere means. Both seem to include this, but perhaps the question is referring to the end result.

Wait, no, the question is about the means being used as a means, which is part of both theories. But perhaps the correct answer is J: Consequentialism.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Another approach: the options are A to J. The correct answer must be J because the concept of using someone as a means is a central part of the end result in consequentialism.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer might be A. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J because the focus is on the consequences leading to the end, which uses someone as a means. So, the answer is J: Consequentialism.
</think>

The idea of "using someone as a mere means" is central to understanding how moral theories evaluate actions based on their outcomes. Utilitarianism (A) focuses on maximizing overall happiness, where using someone as a means is seen as contributing to the good end. Consequentialism (J), on the other hand, emphasizes the consequences of actions leading to the end, making it central to the concept of using someone as a means. While both theories are relevant, the question likely seeks the answer that aligns with the focus on the end result, making **Consequentialism (J)** the most appropriate choice.

Answer: J
