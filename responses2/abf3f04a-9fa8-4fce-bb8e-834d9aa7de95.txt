Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the percentage of US GDP that agriculture made up in 2015. Let me start by recalling what I know about the US economy back then.

I remember that agriculture was a significant part of the US economy, especially during the early 20th century. I think it contributed a lot, but maybe not the largest. I think the 2015 GDP was around the time when the US economy started to grow, so I'm guessing it was in the early to mid-20th century.

I think the total US GDP in 2015 was something like $17 trillion or so. Now, about the breakdown of GDP by industry: agriculture was a big part of that. I recall that in the 1900s, agriculture made up around 15-20% of the total GDP. Wait, but wait, maybe that was before the industrialization? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: I think the 2015 GDP was approximately $17.2 trillion. I remember reading that the agriculture sector was a major contributor, but maybe not the largest. Let me think of some quick data. I think in 2010, the agricultural GDP was around 5% of the total. So in 2015, maybe it's similar or a bit higher.

Looking at the options: D is 15%, H is 5%, I is 30%, and E is 7%. So which one is more likely? I think in 2015, the agriculture sector contributed about 12-15% of the total GDP. That would make option C (12%) a strong candidate.

Wait, I should double-check. I'm trying to remember the exact numbers. I think in 1990, the share might have been around 10-15%, but by 2010, it had increased a bit. So in 2015, it's likely around 12-15%. So option C, 12%, seems correct.

The correct answer is C: 12%. 

Explanation: In 2015, agriculture made up approximately 12% of the total US GDP. This aligns with historical data, where agriculture was a significant contributor to the economy during the early to mid-20th century.
