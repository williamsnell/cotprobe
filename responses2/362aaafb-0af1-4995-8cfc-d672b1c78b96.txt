Okay, so I've got this gas problem to solve. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about oxygen leaking from a container, and I need to find out how many pounds of oxygen leaked out. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the initial state: the container has a volume of 2.5 cubic feet. The oxygen is at 125 psia (pounds per square inch absolute) and a temperature of 75°F. Then, the pressure drops to 100 psia, but the temperature stays the same. The question says to assume ideal gas behavior, which is good because it means we can use the ideal gas law.

I remember the ideal gas law is PV = nRT, or maybe mRT/M, where M is the molar mass. Since we're dealing with mass, maybe the molar form is better. Oh right, PV = (mRT)/M, where m is mass, R is the specific gas constant for oxygen, and T is the temperature in absolute (Kelvin) units.

Wait, but the units here are a bit tricky. The volume is in cubic feet, pressure is psia, and temperature is in Fahrenheit. I need to convert all the units to SI or another consistent system. Oh wait, maybe I can use R in English units because that's what's given.

Wait, R for oxygen—what is its value? I think for oxygen, R is 1545 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R), but wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait no, R in English units is 1545 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R). But sometimes I've heard R expressed differently, like 1545 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R) but that's per mole. So for m, the specific gas constant, it's R divided by the molecular weight.

Oh wait, oxygen's molecular weight is about 32.01 g/mol. So m = R/M. Let me calculate that. R is 1545 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R). M is 32.01 lbm/lbmol. So m = 1545 / 32.01 ≈ 48.26 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should use R in lbf·ft/(slug·°R), which is another way.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should look up the specific gas constant for oxygen. Oh, I think oxygen's specific gas constant R is 0.06855 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R). Because I remember that R for air is about 0.06855, and oxygen is a subset of air, so maybe same value? Or maybe it's 1545 divided by the molecular weight. Let me compute it: 1545 /32.01 ≈ 48.26, which is ft·lbf/(lbm·°R). Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the units. Let me think again.

Another approach: the ideal gas law in terms of mass. The equation I need is m = (P1 V)/(R T1) [when using R in appropriate units].

So P1 is 125 psia, which is 125 * 144 psf (since 1 psia = 144 psf). So 125 * 144 = 18,000 psf. Wait, wait, wait, no: 1 psia = 144 psf, correct. So 125 psia = 125 * 144 = 18,000 psf. Similarly, 100 psia is 100 * 144 = 14,400 psf.

Wait, but actually, I should probably convert the pressure to absolute (psia) into pascals, but wait, maybe it's easier to convert all to SI units.

Wait, let's think about the steps:

1. Convert the initial and final pressures to pascals or another unit where R is known.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for mass change when pressure changes, keeping temperature constant.

Oh wait, the formula for mass when pressure changes (T constant) is m2 = m1 * (P1 / P2), but that's only if the volume and temperature are constant. Wait, but in this case, the container's volume might change if it's not rigid, but the problem says the container's volume is constant. Oh wait, the problem says "the container having a volume of 2.5 ft^3 initially contains oxygen..." so the volume is fixed. The pressure decreases, so the mass must decrease because pressure is proportional to mass (with R and T fixed). So the formula would be m1 = m2 * (P1 / P2). Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. Since T is constant, the ideal gas equation becomes P1 V = m1 R T, P2 V = m2 R T. So m1/m2 = P1 / P2. So m2 = m1 * (P2 / P1). But wait, that's when T is constant and V is fixed. So if the pressure drops from 125 to 100 psia, then the mass will decrease.

Wait, so the initial mass is m1, the final is m2. So m2 = m1 * (P2)/(P1) = m1 * (100/125) = m1 * 0.8.

So the mass that leaked is m1 - m2 = m1 (1 - 0.8) = 0.2 m1.

But wait, no, wait. Wait, the process is, the pressure drops, so the mass also drops. So the initial pressure is 125 psia, final is 100. So m2 = m1 * (P2)/(P1) = m1 * (100/125) = 0.8 m1.

So the mass that leaked is m1 - 0.8 m1 = 0.2 m1. But wait, I'm not getting the numerical value yet. I need to find m1.

To find m1, I can use PV = mRT. So rearranged, m = (P V)/(R T). Let me compute that.

But let's get all the units right. Let me define R in appropriate units. Let's use R = 1545 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R). Wait, but what about the temperature? The initial temperature is 75°F. I need to convert that to °R.

75°F is 75 + 459.67 = 534.67 °R. Because F to R is T(R) = T(F) + 459.67.

So R = 1545 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R). So m = (P V) / (R T).

Let me compute each part.

P is 125 psia. Wait, but I need to convert that to psf (pounds-force per square foot). 125 psia = 125 * 144 = 18,000 psf.

V is 2.5 ft³.

T is 75°F = 534.67 °R.

Now, m = (18000 psf * 2.5 ft³) / (1545 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R) * 534.67 °R)

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 18000 * 2.5 = 45,000.

Denominator: 1545 * 534.67 ≈ let's compute 1545 * 500 = 772,500, and 1545 * 34.67 ≈ 1545 *30=46,350, 1545*4.67≈7,350. Total is 46,350 +7,350 = 53,700. So total denominator is 772500 +53700 = 826,200. So denominator ≈ 826,200.

So m = 45000 / 826200 ≈ 0.0545 lbm. So initial mass is about 0.0545 lbm. Then the final mass is m2 = 0.8 * 0.0545 ≈ 0.0436 lbm.

Leaked mass is 0.0545 - 0.0436 = 0.0109 lbm. But wait, that can't be right. Because the answer options don't have that.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the units. Because the units for R are in ft·lbf/(lbm·°R), but when I'm using P in psf, which is lb_f per square foot, and V in ft³, which is ft*ft*ft. So P V is (lb_f/ft²) * ft³ = lb_f ft. Then R T is in ft·lbf/(lbm·°R) * °R (which cancels °R), so R T is in ft·lbf / lbm.

So let me redo the calculation in the correct units.

m = (P V) / (R T) → units: (lb_f / ft² * ft³) ) / ( (ft·lbf/(lbm·°R)) * °R ) )

= (lb_f * ft) / ( (ft·lbf / lbm) )

Because (ft·lbf/(lbm·°R)) * °R gives (ft·lbf/lbm), so the denominator is (ft·lbf/lbm). So the units become (lb_f * ft) / (ft·lbf/lbm) ) → (lb_f * ft) * (lbm / (ft·lbf)) ) → (lb_f * lbm) / (lbf) ) → lbm.

So the units work out.

Now, let's compute the numerator and denominator again.

Numerator: P is 125 psia → 125 * 144 = 18,000 psf. V is 2.5 ft³. So P V = 18,000 * 2.5 = 45,000 ft·lb_f.

Denominator: R = 1545 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R), T = 534.67 °R. So R*T = 1545 * 534.67 ≈ 1545 * 500 = 772,500, 1545 *34.67≈53,700. Total ≈ 826,200 ft·lbf/lbm.

So m = 45000 / 826200 ≈ 0.0545 lbm.

Wait, but 45000 divided by 826200 is approximately 0.0545 lbm. So the initial mass is 0.0545 lbm.

After pressure drops to 100 psia, m2 = 0.8 * 0.0545 = 0.0436 lbm.

So the mass leaked is 0.0545 - 0.0436 = 0.0109 lbm. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of R*T. Let me compute 1545 * 534.67.

1545 * 500 = 772,500.

1545 * 34.67: Let's compute 1545 * 30 = 46,350. 1545 *4.67 = ?

1545 *4 = 6180.

1545 *0.67 = 1545 * 0.6 = 927, 1545 *0.07=108.15 → 927 + 108.15=1035.15. So 6180 +1035.15=7215.15.

So 34.67 ×1545 = 46,350 +7,215.15 = 53,565.15.

So total R*T = 772,500 +53,565.15=826,065.15.

So m=45,000 / 826,065.15 ≈ 0.0545 lbm.

Hmm, but the answer options don't have that. Wait, let me look again.

The options for lbm are:

A: -0.25

B: -0.347

C: -0.347 lbm.mol

D: -0.40 lbm

E: -0.45 lbm

F: -0.35 lbm

G: -0.50 lbm

H: -0.34 lbm

I: -0.30 lbm

J: -0.20 lbm

So all options are negative, but I'm getting 0.01 lbm, which is positive. Wait, but wait—this suggests that maybe I made an error in units.

Wait, let me double-check the initial assumption. The problem says oxygen leaks until pressure drops to 100 psia while temperature remains same. So the mass should decrease, so the change is negative. Because if initial mass is m1 and final is m2, m1 - m2 is positive.

But according to my calculation, m1 is 0.0545 lbm and m2 is 0.0436 lbm. So the leak is 0.0109 lbm. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the R calculation.

Wait, perhaps I got the wrong R value. Let me double-check the specific gas constant for oxygen.

Wait, for molar mass of O2 is 32.01 lbm/lbmol. So R = R_univ / M, where R_univ is the universal gas constant in Lbf·ft/(lbmol·°R).

Wait, wait, I think R_univ is 1545 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R), so R = R_univ / M.

So R = 1545 /32.01 ≈ 48.26 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R).

Ah, I think I made a mistake here. Because earlier, I thought R was 1545 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R), but actually, R_univ is 1545, so R = R_univ / M = 1545 /32.01 ≈ 48.26 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R). Oops, that's the mistake.

So let's recalculate m.

m = (P V) / (R T).

Wait, but with R now being 48.26 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R).

So P is 125 psia = 18,000 psf.

V is 2.5 ft³.

T is 534.67 °R.

So m = (18,000 * 2.5 ) / (48.26 * 534.67).

Compute numerator: 18,000 *2.5 = 45,000.

Denominator: 48.26 *534.67 ≈ let me calculate.

48 * 530 = 25,440.

But let's compute precisely.

534.67 *48.26.

I can compute 534.67 *48.26.

Let me break it down.

=534.67 * (48 + 0.26) = 534.67 *48 + 534.67*0.26.

534.67 *48 = ?

Well, 500 *48=24,000. 34.67 *48= (34 *48)=1,632, (0.67 *48)=32.16 → 1,632+32.16=1,664.16. So total 24,000 +1,664.16=25,664.16.

Then 534.67 * 0.26 = ?

Approximately 534.67 *0.25 is 133.6675, and 534.67 *0.01=5.3467 → 133.6675 +5.3467 = 139.0142.

So denominator ≈25,664.16 +139.0142 =25,803.174.

So m=45000 /25,803.174 ≈ approx 1.73 lbm.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the initial pressure is 125 psia, which is 125 *144=18,000 psf. So when I compute m, the mass is 45000 (psf*ft) divided by (R*T) which is in ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R) *°R.

Wait, let's recalculate R*T:

R = 48.26 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R).

T = 534.67 °R.

So R*T = 48.26 *534.67 ≈ let's compute 48 *530 =25,440; 0.26 *530=137.8 → 25,440 +137.8=25,577.8.

Then 48 *0.67=32.16; 0.26 *0.67=0.1742 → 32.16 +0.1742=32.3342.

So 48.26 *534.67 = (48 *534.67) + (0.26 *534.67) → 25,577.8 +32.3342=25,610.1342.

So denominator is approximately25,610.13.

So m =45000 /25610.13 ≈ 1.73 lbm.

But the initial mass was 0.0545 lbm? But that can't be. Because if R is 1545, which I thought, but actually it's 48.26, then my calculation leads to m being 1.73 lbm, which is higher than initial, which is impossible.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again: the formula is m = (P V)/(R T). So R is 48.26, but wait, wait: No, R is in ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R). So when we calculate (P V)/(R T), the units are (lb_f ft) / ( (ft·lbf)/(lbmol·°R) * °R ) → (lb_f ft) * (lbmol) / (ft·lbf) → lbmol. Because (ft·lbf) cancels.

So the units are correct.

So m = (18,000 *2.5) / (48.26 *534.67) → 45000 / (48.26 *534.67)

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the R*T calculation. Let me compute R*T as 48.26 *534.67.

48.26 *534.67 = ?

Let me compute 48 *534.67 = 25,610.16.

Then 0.26 *534.67 = let's compute 0.26 *500=130, 0.26*34.67=9.0142 → 130 + 9.0142=139.0142.

So total R*T =25,610.16 +139.0142 =25,749.174.

So m =45000 /25,749.174 ≈ 1.73 lbm.

Wait, but earlier when I thought R was 1545, I got m=0.0545 lbm. But that was incorrect because R was actually 48.26, not 1545. So now, the initial mass is 1.73 lbm.

Wait, but that can't be right because 125 psia is way higher than 100 psia. So if the pressure drops, the mass should decrease.

Wait, I'm getting this wrong because when I calculated with R as 48.26, I got m=1.73 lbm, which is higher than initial, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the units conversion.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R in terms of ft·lbf/(lbm·°R) and then multiplied by T.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate R*T correctly.

Wait, R is 48.26 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R), T is 534.67 °R.

So R*T =48.26 *534.67 ≈ 48 *534.67 =25,610.16, plus 0.26 *534.67 ≈139.0142. So total is 25,749.174.

So m=45000 /25749.174 ≈ 1.73 lbm.

Wait, but that's higher than the initial m, which can't happen. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R = 1545 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R) and then T is 534.67 °R. Then R*T=1545 *534.67 ≈ 826,200, as before.

Then m =45000 /826200 ≈0.0545 lbm.

Hmm, but in that case, if m is 0.0545, then the initial mass is 0.0545. Then the final mass is m2 =0.8 *0.0545≈0.0436 lbm. So the leaked mass is 0.0545 -0.0436 =0.0109 lbm, which is positive, but the options are negative.

Wait, perhaps I missed a negative sign. Let me check the units again.

The formula is m = (P V) / (R T). If P is in psf, V in ft³, R in ft·lbf/(lbm·°R), T in °R.

Wait, but when we compute (P V), it's (psf * ft³) → (lb_f * ft²). Because psf is lb_f/ft², so multiply by ft³ → lb_f * ft².

Then R*T is (ft·lbf/(lbm·°R)) *°R → (ft·lbf/lbm).

So (lb_f * ft²) / (ft·lbf/lbm) → (lb_f * ft²) * (lbm) / (ft·lbf) → lbm.

So the units are correct.

But in the calculation, I got m = 0.0545 lbm. But that would mean the initial mass is about 0.0545 lbm, which is a small number. So if the pressure drops, the mass decreases. So the change is negative.

So the correct calculation should be m = (P V) / (R T) → 0.0545 lbm.

Then m1 = 0.0545 lbm, m2 = 0.8 *0.0545 =0.0436 lbm. So the leaked mass is 0.0545 -0.0436=0.0109 lbm.

But the options are negative. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation step.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R = 1545 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R) and not R =48.26.

Let me recalculate for R=1545.

m= (P V) / (R T) → (18000 *2.5) / (1545 *534.67) →45000 / (1545 *534.67).

Compute denominator: 1545 *534.67 =826,065.15.

So m=45000 /826,065.15 ≈0.0545 lbm.

Which is the same as before.

So now, the initial mass is 0.0545 lbm. After the pressure drops, m2=0.8 *0.0545=0.0436 lbm.

Leaked mass is 0.0545 -0.0436=0.0109 lbm. Which is positive, but the options are negative. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the direction of the process.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the oxygen is being removed, so the mass is decreasing. So the change is m1 -m2 = negative.

But according to the calculation, m1 -m2 is positive. So perhaps the correct answer is the negative of 0.0109, which is -0.0109 lbm. But none of the options are that.

Wait, looking again at the options, I see that options A to J are all negative, except options F and G are positive.

Wait, the options are:

A: -0.25 lbm

B: -0.347 lbm

C: -0.347 lbm.mol

D: -0.40 lbm

E: -0.45 lbm

F: -0.35 lbm

G: -0.34 lbm.mol

H: -0.30 lbm

I: -0.30 lbm

J: -0.20 lbm

Wait, option G is -0.34 lbm.mol. Hmm, that's a mole, but the question is about mass, not moles.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R*T.

Wait, let me compute R*T again.

Wait, R =1545 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R), T=534.67 °R.

So R*T=1545 *534.67.

Let me compute 534.67 *1545.

Let me compute 500 *1545=772,500.

34.67 *1545:

Compute 30 *1545=46,350.

4.67 *1545: Let's compute 4 *1545=6,180.

0.67 *1545= approx 0.67 *1500=1,005 and 0.67 *45=30.15 → total 1,035.15.

So 4.67 *1545=6,180 +1,035.15=7,215.15.

So 34.67 *1545=46,350 +7,215.15=53,565.15.

So total R*T=772,500 +53,565.15=826,065.15.

So m=45,000 /826,065.15 ≈0.0545 lbm.

So initial mass is 0.0545 lbm, final mass is 0.8*0.0545=0.0436 lbm. So the mass lost is 0.0545 -0.0436=0.0109 lbm.

But the options are all negative. So perhaps the problem is that the calculation leads to a positive change, but the options are negative. Therefore, the correct answer is the negative of the calculated value, which would be -0.0109 lbm. However, none of the options are that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the actual answer is one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R = 48.26 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R) and T = 534.67 °R.

So m= (18000 *2.5) / (48.26 *534.67) →45000 / (48.26 *534.67).

Compute denominator: 48.26 *534.67=25,749.174.

45000 /25,749.174 ≈1.73 lbm.

So initial mass is 1.73 lbm, final mass is 1.73 *0.8=1.384 lbm. So the mass lost is 1.73 -1.384 =0.346 lbm. But none of the options is 0.346.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 48.26 *534.67 again.

48.26 *534.67:

Let me compute 48 *534.67 =25,610.16.

0.26 *534.67 =139.0142.

Total=25,749.174.

So denominator is 25,749.174.

So m=45,000 /25,749.174 ≈1.73 lbm.

Wait, initial mass is 1.73 lbm. Final mass is 1.73 *0.8=1.384 lbm. So the mass lost is 1.73 -1.384=0.346 lbm. But none of the options have this value.

Wait, looking at the options, option G is -0.34 lbm.mol. Hmm, but that's a mole, not mass.

Wait, option F is -0.35 lbm.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R =48.26. Let me recalculate m.

m= (18000 *2.5) / (48.26 *534.67) →45000 / (48.26 *534.67).

Denominator=48.26 *534.67=25,749.174.

45000 /25,749.174 ≈1.73 lbm.

So initial mass is 1.73 lbm, final mass is 1.384 lbm. So mass lost is 0.346 lbm.

But the options are all negative. So perhaps the correct answer is -0.35 lbm. But that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R =48.26 and T =534.67, but the initial mass is 1.73, final mass is 1.384, so the mass lost is 0.346 lbm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R =48.26 and T =534.67, but the initial pressure was 125 psia, which is 18,000 psf.

Wait, perhaps I should have used m = (P V)/(R T), where P is in psf, V in ft³, R in ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R), T in °R.

Wait, but in that case, the calculation is correct, leading to m=1.73 lbm. So the mass lost is 0.346 lbm, but none of the options have this.

Wait, looking again, the options are:

A: -0.25 lbm

B: -0.347 lbm

C: -0.347 lbm.mol

D: -0.40 lbm

E: -0.45 lbm

F: -0.35 lbm

G: -0.34 lbm.mol

H: -0.30 lbm

I: -0.30 lbm

J: -0.20 lbm

Hmm, none of the options give 0.346 lbm, but option F is -0.35 lbm, which is an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the specific gas constant in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R =48.26 and T =534.67, but my calculation led to m=1.73 lbm. But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used R =48.26 and T =534.67, but the initial pressure is 125 psia, which is 18,000 psf.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.

Wait, another way to calculate m is:

m = (P / R T) * V.

Where P is in psf, V in ft³, R in ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R), T in °R.

So m = (125 * 2.5) / (48.26 *534.67) * V.

Wait, but V is 2.5 ft³. So m = (125 * 2.5 * 2.5) / (48.26 *534.67).

Wait, no, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I should have converted the pressure into the same units.

Wait, perhaps I should have used P =125 psia =125 psf * 144 =18,000 psf.

Then, m = (18,000 *2.5) / (48.26 *534.67) →45,000 / (48.26 *534.67).

Which is 45,000 /25,749.174 ≈1.73 lbm.

So the mass lost is 0.346 lbm, which is positive, but the options are all negative.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F: -0.35 lbm, but that's an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

So the mass lost is 0.346 lbm. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option F: -0.35 lbm, but that's an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option G: -0.34 lbm.mol, but that's a mole, not mass.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R in another unit.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R =1545 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R) and T =534.67 °R.

So m= (18,000 *2.5) / (1545 *534.67) →45,000 / (1545 *534.67).

Compute denominator:1545 *534.67 ≈826,065.15.

So m=45,000 /826,065.15 ≈0.0545 lbm.

So initial mass is 0.0545 lbm, final mass is 0.0436 lbm. So mass lost is 0.0545 -0.0436 =0.0109 lbm.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option F: -0.35 lbm, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R=48.26 and T=534.67, but the correct answer is option F: -0.35 lbm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used R=48.26 and T=534.67, but the correct answer is option G: -0.34 lbm.mol.

Wait, but that's a mole, not mass.

I think perhaps the correct answer is option F: -0.35 lbm, as it's an approximation of the 0.346 lbm, which is positive, but perhaps the problem expects the negative, which would be option F.

To solve the problem, we use the ideal gas law in the form:

\[
m = \frac{P \cdot V}{R \cdot T}
\]

Where:
- \( P \) is the pressure (in psia),
- \( V \) is the volume (in ft³),
- \( R \) is the specific gas constant (in ft·lbf/(lbm·°R)),
- \( T \) is the temperature (in °R).

### Step 1: Convert Pressure
The pressure is given as 125 psia. To convert this to psf:
\[
P = 125 \, \text{psia} = 125 \times 144 = 18,000 \, \text{psf}
\]

### Step 2: Plug in the Values
The volume \( V = 2.5 \, \text{ft}^3 \), the specific gas constant \( R = 48.26 \, \text{ft·lbf/(lbm·°R)} \), and the temperature \( T = 534.67 \, \text{°R} \).

\[
m = \frac{18,000 \cdot 2.5}{48.26 \cdot 534.67}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Denominator
\[
48.26 \cdot 534.67 \approx 25,749.174
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Mass
\[
m = \frac{45,000}{25,749.174} \approx 1.73 \, \text{lbm}
\]

### Step 5: Determine Mass Lost
\[
\Delta m = 1.73 - (1.73 \cdot 0.8) = 1.73 - 1.384 = 0.346 \, \text{lbm}
\]

### Step 6: Match with Options
The calculated mass lost is \( 0.346 \, \text{lbm} \), but none of the options exactly match this value. The closest option is **F: -0.35 lbm**, which is an approximation of the positive value \( 0.346 \, \text{lbm} \).
