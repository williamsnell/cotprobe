Question:

Police officers had probable cause to believe that a man had committed a series of armed bank robberies with an accomplice. The officers obtained a valid arrest warrant for the man and went to his house to arrest him. The officers found the front door ajar and could hear a radio playing inside. They knocked on the door, identified themselves as police officers, and stated that they had a warrant. Getting no response, the officers entered the house. After the officers called the man's name several times and again identified themselves as police officers, the man emerged from the basement and was arrested. The officers went into the basement to look for the accomplice. They opened a closet door and found cocaine in plain view. They did not find the accomplice. The man was indicted for cocaine possession. He has moved to suppress the cocaine as evidence on the ground that it was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?

Options:

A: No, because the officers discovered the cocaine during a lawful protective sweep of the house looking for the man's accomplice.
B: Yes, because the man was not given a chance to surrender before the officers entered the house.
C: Yes, because the officers did not find the accomplice in the house.
D: No, because the officers had a valid arrest warrant for the man.
E: Yes, because the officers entered the house without permission.
F: Yes, because the officers did not have probable cause to believe that cocaine would be in the closet.
G: No, because the search was incident to the man's arrest.
H: No, because the officers had probable cause to believe that the man was involved in criminal activity.
I: No, because the cocaine was in plain view when the officers opened the closet.
J: Yes, because the officers did not have a search warrant.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the court should grant the suppression of the cocaine evidence based on the facts given. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the man was arrested for cocaine possession. He moved to suppress the evidence, claiming it was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The main points I need to consider are the Fourth Amendment rights, specifically regarding the protection of the Fourth Amendment, which protects the right to bear arms and the Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.

The officers obtained a valid arrest warrant, so that's a positive point. They went to the house with the warrant and identified themselves as police officers, which is probably to deter potential threats or to maintain the integrity of the arrest process. They knocked on the door, identified themselves as police, and called the man's name a few times. No response was received.

Then, they went into the house and found the man emerged from the basement. They opened a closet door and found cocaine in plain view. They didn't find the accomplice. 

I think the key here is whether the officers had a lawful search and seizure. I remember the Fourth Amendment has a rule about searches that are lawful, like protective searches. A protective search is when the officer is in a position of trust and can keep the suspect in a safe area to prevent them from escaping or interacting with the officer, while the search is still conducted.

In this case, they entered the house without permission. Wait, no, they did have the arrest warrant, so they were in a position of trust. The officers were in their house, which is a secure area, so they could keep the man's foot in the closet door and the police in the basement. They entered the house looking for the man's accomplice, not the man himself. So, it's a protective sweep.

So the officers were using a protective sweep to search the closet door. A protective sweep is a lawful search, as long as it's done in a secure area. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, but the officer's actions were lawful in this context because they were in their house and kept the suspect in the closet door. 

Therefore, the officers didn't have a lawful search that was unreasonable. So the Fourth Amendment doesn't protect against this. Thus, the suppression of the evidence should be denied because the officers were not in a position of trust to make an unreasonable search and seizure.

Looking at the options, option A says "No, because the officers discovered the cocaine during a lawful protective sweep." That makes sense because the protective sweep was legal, so the evidence was not obtained unlawfully.

Wait, option B says "Yes because the man wasn't given a chance." No, because the officers found the man in the basement, so the search was in his house. The fact that the man emerged didn't imply he wasn't in the house, so B is incorrect.

Option C says "Yes because they didn't find the accomplice." But the issue isn't about finding the accomplice; the suppression is about the cocaine. So C is incorrect.

Option D says "No because they had a warrant." But that's not a problem; it's a positive point for the Fourth Amendment. The fact that they had a warrant doesn't negate the suppression claim.

Option E says "Yes because they entered without permission." Wait, they did have the arrest warrant, so E is incorrect because they were in a position of trust.

Option F says "Yes because they didn't have probable cause to believe the man would be in the closet." But the officers had probable cause to believe the man was involved in the robbery, but that doesn't necessarily mean the man wasn't in the closet. So F is incorrect.

Option G says "No because the search was incident to arrest." That's not the issue here. The search was about the man's activity, not his arrest. So G is incorrect.

Option H says "No because they had probable cause to believe the man was involved." That's not relevant to the suppression claim either.

Option I says "No because the cocaine was in plain view." But the issue is that the officers didn't enter the house to look for the accomplice, so they didn't do a protective sweep to get the man's shoes out. The search for the accomplice was a different scenario. So I's incorrect.

Option J says "No because they didn't have a search warrant." The officers did have a warrant, so J is incorrect.

So the correct answer is A.

The court should **not** grant the suppression of the cocaine evidence. The officers' actions were lawful under the Fourth Amendment, as they employed a protective sweep in a secure area to prevent the suspect from leaving, while the search was conducted in accordance with the law. Therefore, the suppression claim is invalid.

**Answer: A**
