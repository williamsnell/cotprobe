Okay, so I need to figure out what 60% of 30 is. Hmm, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that percentages involve parts per hundred. So, 60% means 60 per 100, which is the same as 0.60 in decimal form. 

Wait, yeah, right. So to find 60% of 30, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply it by 30. Let me write that out. 60% is 0.60, so 0.60 multiplied by 30.

Let me do the math step by step. 0.6 times 30. Maybe I can think of this as 30 multiplied by 0.6. Oh wait, 30 times 0.6 is the same as 30 times 6 divided by 10. So, 30 times 6 is 180. Divided by 10, that's 18. So, 18 is the result.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one is 18. Option I is 18. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 60% is 0.6, 0.6 times 30 is indeed 18. Yep, looks right. So the answer is I: 18.
