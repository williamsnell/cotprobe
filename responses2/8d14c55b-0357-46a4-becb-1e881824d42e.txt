Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this bioelectrical impedance question. So the question is about why an electrical current travels faster through muscle than fat. I remember that bioelectrical impedance measures body composition, so maybe it's related to the conductance of the tissues.

I think conductivity plays a role here. If a material conducts electricity well, it allows more current to flow quickly. So, if muscle conducts electricity faster, that means it has a higher resistance or lower resistance? Wait, wait. Wait, the current would flow faster if the material is more conductive. So if muscle conducts better, the current moves quicker through muscle.

But why muscle is better? I remember something about water content and electrolytes. Muscle is more water than fat, right? Because fat is less dense and has fewer water molecules. Oh wait, wait. Let me think. Muscle is denser, so it's more conductive? Or is it because it has more water, which increases conductivity?

Oh right, muscle has more water, which increases its conductivity. So when you apply a current, the more water, the higher the resistance. Wait, no, higher resistance means less current. Wait, no, higher conductivity means more current. So higher conductivity means the current flows faster.

Wait, but the question is why does the current go faster through muscle. So, if muscle has higher conductivity, it allows the current to travel faster.

So, which factors affect conductivity? Conductivity is related to the material's resistivity. Conductivity (σ) is 1/Resistivity (ρ). So materials with higher conductivity allow more current to flow.

Factors that increase conductivity: materials with higher water content. Because water increases the number of ions available for conduction. So, if muscle has more water, it has higher conductivity, so the current flows faster.

So looking at the options, which factors are about water content.

Option C: Fat contains less water than muscle. Because fat has less water, it's less conductive. So muscle is better, so current flows faster.

Wait, but the question is why muscle conducts better. So if fat has less water, it's less conductive, so muscle conducts better. So the correct answer would be C: Fat contains less water than muscle.

But wait, another thought: muscle is more water, which increases its conductivity. So more water → higher conductivity → faster current.

So the correct option is C.

The electrical current travels faster through muscle than fat because muscle has more water, which increases its conductivity. Conductivity is inversely related to resistance, so higher conductivity allows the current to flow more easily. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Both materials conduct electricity, but muscle is more conductive due to its higher water content.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While fat is denser, water is more conductive than fat.
- **Option C**: Correct. Muscle contains more water than fat, which increases its conductivity and allows the current to flow faster.
- **Other options**: Incorrect as they either describe factors unrelated to conductivity or inaccurately state the relationship between water content and conductivity.

ANSWER: C
