Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

There are 30 students from 5 classes. Each student solves at least one math problem. The key points are:

1. Every two students in the same class solved the same number of questions.
2. The number of questions solved by any two students from different classes is different.

The question is asking for the maximum possible number of students who only answered one question. The options are A to J, with numbers ranging from 10 to 28.

Hmm, so let's break this down. First, the students are divided into 5 classes. Each class has some number of students, but not necessarily the same number in each class. Let's denote the number of students in each class as n1, n2, n3, n4, n5. So, n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 = 30.

Now, for each class, every student in that class has solved the same number of questions. Let's denote the number of questions solved by a student in class i as ki. So, each student in class i has answered ki questions.

The students from different classes have different numbers of questions solved. So, the set of ki's across all classes must all be distinct. That means that for any two classes, the ki's are unique. So, if one class has students solving 2 questions, no other class can have students solving 2, 3, etc., depending on how many classes there are.

But wait, there are 5 classes, so each class's ki would be unique. So, the ki's across all 5 classes must be 5 distinct integers. Let's say the ki's are k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, all distinct.

Now, each student in a class has the same ki, and all students in different classes have different kj. So, the problem is to maximize the number of students who only answered one question. That is, we need as many students as possible to have ki = 1, but making sure that the other classes have different kj values.

But wait, the students from the same class can have different kj? No, wait, no. Because the problem says that every two students in the same class solved the same number of questions. So, for each class, all students have the same ki. So, each class has students with the same ki.

But the students from different classes have different kj. So, for example, class 1 has all students with ki = k1, class 2 with ki = k2, etc., and each of these kj's are distinct across classes.

So, the maximum number of students who only answered one question would be the number of students in classes where ki=1. But we need to make sure that:

1. The number of students in each class is such that the sum is 30.

2. The ki's across classes are all distinct.

3. We need as many students as possible to have ki=1, but without violating the distinct kj condition.

Wait, but that's not the case. Because each class's ki is fixed. So, if a class has ki=1, then all students in that class have 1 question. So, the number of students in that class is, say, n1, and each of them has k1=1. Then, the other classes have different kj's, which are not 1.

So, the maximum number of students with ki=1 would be n1, as long as the other kj's are all different and not 1, and that the total number of students is 30.

But wait, let's think about the constraints. We have 5 classes, each with ki being a unique number. Also, the students in each class must have the same ki, and the students from different classes have different kj.

So, to maximize the number of students with ki=1, we should have as many students as possible in a class where ki=1.

But each class must have at least 1 student, since each student must answer at least one question. So, the minimal number of students per class is 1. But wait, wait. Wait, the problem says that every two students in the same class solved the same number of questions, and each student must answer at least one question. So, each class must have at least one student, but you could have more.

But if we have a class with ki=1, then that class must have at least one student. But to maximize the number of students with ki=1, we should have as many as possible in that class, but ensuring that the other classes' kj are all different.

Let's think about this. Suppose we have a class with ki=1. Then, all other classes have kj's that are different from 1. So, the other classes can't have ki=1. So, the other classes can't have ki=1.

But wait, the number of possible ki's is limited because there are 5 classes. Each class has a unique ki. So, the ki's for each class must be distinct. So, if one class has ki=1, the other classes can't have ki=1.

So, the other classes' ki's must be different from 1 and from each other. So, the other classes must have ki's that are at least 2, but all different.

Wait, but ki's can be more than 1. So, for example, the possible ki's could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But wait, each class has a unique ki, but classes can have the same ki? No, wait, no, because each class's ki is fixed. So, if class A has ki=1, then all students in class A have 1. Class B has ki=2, etc., or any permutation. So, for each class, ki is unique.

So, the five ki's are all distinct. So, the possible ki's must be five different integers, each at least 1 (since each class has at least one student, and each student has at least one question). But wait, actually, a class can have ki=0? No, because each student must solve at least one question. So, ki can't be zero. So, ki must be at least 1.

But wait, the problem says each student must answer at least one question, so each student in a class has ki ≥1. So, for the classes, ki must be at least 1, but not necessarily higher than that.

Wait, but the students in a class solve the same number of questions. So, ki is the number of questions each student in class i solved. So, ki can be 1, 2, etc.

But the problem says that the number of questions any two students from different classes solved is different. So, for any two students from different classes, their ki's are different. So, all ki's across all classes must be distinct.

So, the ki's across the five classes are all distinct positive integers. Let's denote them as k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, all distinct.

The goal is to maximize the number of students with ki=1. So, to have as many students as possible in a class where ki=1.

But each class must have at least one student because each student in that class has ki=1. So, if a class has ki=1, it must have at least one student.

But to maximize the number of students with ki=1, we need to have that class as large as possible. So, the size of this class is the number of students who have ki=1. Let's denote this number as n1.

But since each class has ki=1, each of these students has ki=1. So, the other classes must have ki's that are different from 1 and different from each other.

So, the other classes can't have ki=1, so their ki's must be unique and different from 1.

Now, the ki's across the five classes are all distinct positive integers. Let's think about the possible ki's.

We have five classes, so the ki's must be five distinct integers. Let's say the ki's are a, b, c, d, e, all distinct, and each ≥1.

To maximize the number of students with ki=1, we should have as many students as possible in a class with ki=1.

So, let's assume that one class has ki=1, and the other classes have the next possible ki's.

Wait, but the ki's must be distinct across classes. So, if one class has ki=1, the others can't have ki=1. So, their ki's must be different.

So, the other classes can have ki=2, 3, 4, 5, but that's only four options. Wait, but we need five classes, so the ki's must be five distinct integers, including 1.

Wait, wait, no. If one class has ki=1, the other classes must have ki's that are different from 1, so they can be 2,3,4,5, but that's only four options, so five classes would require five distinct ki's. So, that's not possible.

Wait, that's a problem. Let me think again.

Wait, if we have five classes, each with a unique ki, and one of these ki's is 1, then the other four classes must have ki's that are 2,3,4,5. But that's four ki's, but we have five classes, so we can't have five distinct ki's if one is 1 and the others are 2,3,4,5. Because that's five ki's in total. Wait, 1,2,3,4,5 are five distinct integers. So, that's possible.

Wait, so if the ki's are 1,2,3,4,5, then each class has a unique ki. So, one class has ki=1, another ki=2, and so on up to ki=5.

So, that's possible.

So, the maximum number of students with ki=1 is the number of students in the class where ki=1. Since each class must have at least one student, the minimal number of students is 1 per class. But wait, to maximize the number of students with ki=1, we'd want as many students as possible in that class.

Wait, but each class must have at least one student, but we can have as many students as we want, right? But wait, the problem says 30 students in total.

So, if the class with ki=1 has as many students as possible, then the other classes can have as few as possible.

Wait, but the other classes can't have ki=1, so their ki's must be 2,3,4,5. So, for example, the class with ki=2 must have at least one student, and so on.

So, let's think about this: the class with ki=1 can have n1 students, each solving 1 question. The other classes (4 classes) have ki=2,3,4,5, each with at least 1 student.

So, the minimal number of students in the other classes is 1 each. So, the total number of students would be n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = n1 +4.

But the total must be 30. So, n1 +4 =30 → n1=26.

Wait, but that would make the class with ki=1 have 26 students, each solving 1 question, and the other four classes have 1 student each, solving 2,3,4,5 questions respectively.

Wait, but that's a possible scenario. So, the number of students with ki=1 is 26, which would be option E (26). But wait, let's check if that's allowed.

Wait, but the problem says that every two students in the same class solved the same number of questions. So, in this case, the class with 26 students would all have solved 1 question, which satisfies that.

The other classes have 1 student each, solving 2,3,4,5 questions. So, all the ki's across classes are 1,2,3,4,5, which are all distinct. So that's fine.

But wait, is that possible? Because then the ki's are all distinct, so any two students from different classes have different kj's. So, that's acceptable.

So, the maximum number of students with ki=1 is 26, which is option E.

Wait, but let me think again. Because maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let's consider another possibility.

Another scenario: what if the class with ki=1 has fewer students, but the other classes have ki=2,3,4,5, each with more than one student. Would that allow a higher number of students with ki=1?

Wait, no, because the class with ki=1 would have fewer students, so the total number of students would be less. So, to maximize the number of students with ki=1, we need to maximize n1, the number of students in that class. So, that scenario where n1=26 and others have 1 seems optimal.

But wait, let me check the options. Option E is 26, which would be the case here. So, the answer would be E.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure that this configuration is possible. Because sometimes, these problems have constraints that might prevent such a scenario.

Wait, another thought: the total number of students is 30. So, n1=26, and the other four classes have 1 student each, so 26+1+1+1+1=30. That's correct.

But the ki's for the other classes are 2,3,4,5. So, each of these ki's is unique across classes, which satisfies the problem's condition.

Wait, but what about the students in the class with ki=2? Are they allowed to have more than one question each? Yes. The problem only requires that students in the same class have the same number of questions, which they do (all 2). Also, the students from different classes have different numbers.

So, that's acceptable.

So, the maximum possible number of students who only answered one question is 26, which is option E.

Wait, but let me think again. The options given are:

A: 22

B: 24

C:25

D:30

E:26

F:18

G:20

H:28

I:15

J:10

So, the correct answer is E:26.
</think>

The problem requires determining the maximum number of students who answered exactly one question, given that each class has students with the same number of questions and different numbers across classes.

1. **Understanding Constraints**:
   - 30 students across 5 classes.
   - Each class's students have the same number of questions.
   - Students from different classes have different question counts.

2. **Maximizing Students with ki=1**:
   - Let the class with ki=1 have n1 students.
   - Other classes (4 classes) must have ki=2,3,4,5, each with at least 1 student.
   - Total students: n1 + 4 (each class has 1 student) = 30 → n1=26.

3. **Verification**:
   - 26 students with ki=1, others with ki=2,3,4,5.
   - All ki's are distinct, satisfying the condition.

Thus, the maximum number is 26, option E.
