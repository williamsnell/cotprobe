Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the absolute minimum value of the function f(x, y) = x² + y², but it's subject to the constraint x² + 2y² = 1. Hmm, I remember from my calculus class that when you have a function to minimize or maximize with a constraint, you can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Or wait, maybe there's another way using substitution. Let me think.

So the function we're trying to minimize is f(x, y) = x² + y². The constraint is x² + 2y² = 1. I'm trying to find the smallest value that f can take while still satisfying the constraint.

Hmm, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other using the constraint. Let's see. From the constraint, x² = 1 - 2y². Then I can substitute this into f(x, y). So f becomes (1 - 2y²) + y² which simplifies to 1 - y². Oh wait, so f = 1 - y². Now, since y² is always non-negative, the smallest f can be is when y² is as large as possible. But wait, no. Because we're trying to find the minimum of f, which is 1 - y². So to minimize f, we need to minimize 1 - y², which would occur when y² is as large as possible. But wait, that's the opposite of what I thought. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Because f = 1 - y². So f increases as y² decreases. Oh, wait, no. If y² increases, then 1 - y² decreases. So to minimize f, we need y² to be as large as possible. But wait, y² can't be more than 0.5 because from the constraint, x² + 2y² =1. So x² is at least 0, so 2y² can be up to 1, so y² up to 0.5. So the maximum value of y² is 0.5. So when y² is 0.5, f becomes 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. And when y² is 0, f is 1.

Wait, so according to this, the minimum f is 0.5 when y² is 0.5. So the minimum is 0.5, which is option E.

Wait, but wait another thought. Let me try using Lagrange multipliers properly. The method says that the gradient of f is equal to λ times the gradient of the constraint function g(x, y) = x² + 2y² -1.

So, gradient f is (2x, 2y). Gradient g is (2x, 4y).

So, setting up the equations: 2x = λ * 2x --> 2x = 2λ x --> which simplifies to x(1-λ) =0. So either x=0 or λ=1.

Similarly, 2y = λ *4y --> 2y = 4λ y --> 2y (1 - 2λ) =0, so y=0 or λ=0.5.

Hmm, so possible cases:

Case1: x=0 and y=0. But then the constraint x² +2y²=1 would be 0=1, which isn't possible. So this case is invalid.

Case2: x=0, but then y² would have to be 0.5, so y=±√(0.5). Then f would be 0 + 0.5 =0.5. So that's the same as before.

Case3: y=0, then x²=1, so x=±1. Then f=1 +0=1. That's higher than 0.5.

Case4: λ=1. Then from 2y=4*1*y → 2y=4y → 2y=0 → y=0. Then x²=1, so x=±1. Then f=1. Which again is higher than 0.5.

Case5: λ=0.5. Then from 2x=2λ x → 2x=λ=0.5 → 2x= x → x=0. Then y²=0.5. So f=0 +0.5=0.5. Same as case2.

So the minimal value is indeed 0.5, which is option E.

To find the absolute minimum value of \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \) subject to the constraint \( x^2 + 2y^2 = 1 \), we can use substitution. From the constraint, \( x^2 = 1 - 2y^2 \). Substituting into \( f \), we get \( f = 1 - y^2 \). The minimum occurs when \( y^2 \) is maximized, which is 0.5, leading to \( f = 0.5 \). This matches option E.
