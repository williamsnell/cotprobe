Okay, so I have this question about the WISC score distribution and I need to find out what percent of the population scores between 70 and 130. Hmm, wait, WISCâ€”I think that stands for Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, right? So I'm trying to remember how that's scored.

I recall that WISC scores are based on a normal distribution, which is a bell curve. The average score is 100, and the standard deviation (SD) is 15. So most people score around 100, and the spread out scores are within 15 points above or below that.

Now, the question is asking about the range from 70 to 130. Let me think about how that translates in terms of SDs. 70 is 30 points below the mean, and 130 is 30 points above. So that's 2 SDs below and above the mean.

In a normal distribution, about 68% of the scores fall within 1 SD of the mean. That's a rule of thumb. So between 85 to 115, approximately 68% score there. But wait, the question is about 70 to 130, which is wider. Since 70 is 2 SD below, and 130 is 2 SD above, the range from 70 to 130 should cover more than 68% of the population.

The empirical rule (68-95-99.7) tells me that about 95% of scores fall within 2 SDs. So 70-130 should cover a larger percentage than 68%. Let me see the options. The options are A to J, with numbers 25, 90, 75, 68, 95, 50, etc.

Looking at the options, 95% is an option (E). Alternatively, since 70-130 is two SDs, and 95% is the approximate for two SDs around the mean. So the answer should be E, 95%.

The WISC scores are normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The range 70-130 spans two standard deviations below and above the mean (2 SDs). According to the empirical rule, approximately 95% of the population falls within this range. 

Answer: E (95)
