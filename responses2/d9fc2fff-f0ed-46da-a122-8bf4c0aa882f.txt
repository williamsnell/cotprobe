Alright, so I've got this problem here about finding the volume of a block of wood. Let me see, the dimensions are given in meters, centimeters, and millimeters. Hmm, I need to figure out the volume in cubic centimeters since the options are in cc. 

Wait, right. Volume is length times width times height. But the units aren't all the same, so I need to convert them all to the same unit first. Since the answer needs to be in cc, which is cubic centimeters, I should convert everything to centimeters. 

Let me list out the given dimensions: 25.0 meters, 10.0 centimeters, and 300 millimeters. Oh wait, that's a mix of meters, cm, and mm. I need to convert everything to centimeters because 1 m = 100 cm, and 1 cm is 10 mm. So let's break it down.

Starting with the first dimension: 25.0 meters. Since 1 m is 100 cm, I multiply 25.0 by 100. That gives me 2500 cm. That makes sense because 25 m is 2500 cm.

The second dimension is already in cm, so that's 10.0 cm. No conversion needed there.

The third dimension is 300 mm. Since 1 cm is 10 mm, I divide 300 mm by 10 to get centimeters. 300 /10 is 30 cm. So that's 30 cm.

Now, I have all dimensions in centimeters: 2500 cm, 10 cm, and 30 cm.

Volume is length × width × height. So multiply them together: 2500 * 10 * 30. Let me compute that.

2500 * 10 is 25,000. Then 25,000 * 30 is 750,000. So the volume is 750,000 cubic centimeters.

Wait, but let me double-check the units to make sure. Because sometimes when you mix units, it's easy to make a mistake. So all the original units were meters, centimeters, and millimeters. Converting all to centimeters is correct because 1 m is 100 cm, 1 cm is 10 mm, so 1 m is 1000 mm. So 25 meters is 2500 cm, 300 mm is 30 cm. Yep, all correct.

So the volume is 750,000 cc. Let me look at the options. 

Option B is 75000 cc. That's exactly what I got. Another option is option A, which is 7.50e5 (750,000) which is option B. So the correct answer should be B.

To determine the volume of the block of wood, we first convert all dimensions to centimeters:

- \(25.0 \, \text{m} = 2500 \, \text{cm}\)
- \(10.0 \, \text{cm}\) (already in cm)
- \(300 \, \text{mm} = 30 \, \text{cm}\) (since \(1 \, \text{cm} = 10 \, \text{mm}\))

The volume is calculated as:
\[
\text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} = 2500 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} \times 30 \, \text{cm} = 750,000 \, \text{cc}.
\]

Looking at the options, the correct answer is **B: 75000 cc**.
