Okay, so I have this question about blood types and probabilities. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question is: Two individuals, one with type B blood and one with type AB blood, have a child. What's the probability the child has type O blood? The options are from A to J.

I remember that blood type is determined by the presence of certain antigens on red blood cells. The ABO system has three main antigens: A, B, and the neutral D antigen. The blood type is determined by the combination of these antigens.

Type A blood has A antigens, type B has B antigens, and type O has neither. Type AB is the universal receiver because it has both A and B antigens.

Each person's blood type is determined by their alleles. For example, type A has two A alleles (A and A), while type B has one A and one B allele (B and B), and type AB has one A and one B allele (A and B). 

So, if one parent is type B and the other is type AB, I need to figure out the possible alleles each parent can contribute to the child and then determine the possible blood types of the child.

Let's break it down. 

Type B blood: The genotype is IA and IB. Wait, no, actually, I think I should correct that. The correct genotype for type B is IA and IB. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Type B can be either IA and IB, or IA and AB. Wait, no, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, no, the correct way is that type B has one B allele and one A allele? No, wait, no, the way it's structured is that each person has two alleles. So, for example, type A is A/A (two A alleles), type B is B/B (two B alleles), type AB is AB (one A and one B allele). Type O is OO, meaning neither A nor B.

So, let's take the two parents: one is type B, which would have alleles B and B (since B is B/B), and the other is type AB, which has alleles A and B (A/B). Wait, no, wait: type AB is A/B, meaning each allele is A and B. So, parent 1: type B is B/B. Parent 2: type AB is A/B.

Each parent contributes one allele for the child. So, for the child's blood type, we need to find all possible combinations of the alleles from each parent.

Parent 1 can give either B (from their two B alleles) or... Wait no. Wait, parent 1 is type B, so their two alleles are B and B. So when they donate an allele, it's either B or B. So, they always give a B allele to the child.

Parent 2 is type AB, which has alleles A and B. So, when they donate an allele, they can give either A or B.

So the child's genotype will be the combination of the alleles from each parent.

Parent 1 contributes B. Parent 2 can contribute A or B. So possible genotypes are:

- B (from parent 1) and A (from parent 2) → genotype AB.
- B (from parent 1) and B (from parent 2) → genotype BB.

Wait, but wait, no, the child's genotype is formed by combining the alleles. So, if parent 1 gives B and parent 2 gives A, the child has A and B, so AB. If parent 2 gives B, the child has B and B, so BB.

So the possible genotypes for the child are AB and BB.

Now, mapping to blood types:

- BB is type B.
- AB is type A.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, blood types are determined by the presence of antigens. So, if a person has both A and B antigens, their blood type is AB. If they have only A, it's type A, and only B is type B.

So, the possible blood types of the child are AB and type B.

Wait, but how does this relate to the possible O blood type?

Wait, the options include O, which is type O (no antigens). So, can the child have type O blood?

Wait, to get O blood, the child would need neither A nor B antigens. But according to the parents, one is B (so they have B allele) and one is AB (so they have A and B). 

So, the child's genotype would be:

If the parent B gives B and parent AB gives A: genotype AB → blood type A.

If the parent B gives B and parent AB gives B: genotype BB → blood type B.

So the child can't be O because that would require neither A nor B. 

So the possible blood types for the child are A and B.

Wait, but wait, another way to think about this: the parents are B (B/B) and AB (A/B). So the possible gametes are from each parent.

Parent B can produce gametes with B only (since their genotype is B/B). 

Parent AB can produce gametes A and B, each with equal probability (50% each).

So the child's possible blood types are:

Each parent's gamete combines.

So, the possible combinations are:

B (from parent B) + A → AB.

B (from parent B) + B → BB.

So the child can be either AB (type A) or BB (type B). 

So, the probability of each outcome is 50% each.

Wait, but the question is asking for the probability of the child being O blood type. Since the options don't have an O blood type, but in reality, the possible outcomes are A and B, not O.

Wait, but wait. Is there a possibility that the parent's genotype might be different? Let me check.

Wait, the parents are B and AB. So their genotypes are B/B and A/B, respectively.

Possible gametes from parent B: B only. Because they're homozygous for B.

Possible gametes from parent AB: A and B, each 50%.

So the child's genotype can be:

- B (from parent B) + A → AB (type A)
- B (from parent B) + B → BB (type B)

So, the child can be type A or type B.

Therefore, the probability of the child being O blood type is zero, because the only possible blood types are A and B.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 0%. That's the answer.

So the options are:

A:50% (probably not)
B:100% (no)
C:0% (yes)
D:10% (no)
E:75% (no)
F:33% (no)
G:20% (no)
H:66% (no)
I:80% (no)
J:25% (no)

So the correct answer is C: 0%.

The question involves calculating the probability that a child born to a type B blood parent (genotype B/B) and an AB blood parent (genotype A/B) has type O blood. Blood types are determined by the presence of antigens on red blood cells, with type O being the universal receiver (no A or B antigens). 

To determine the child's blood type, consider the possible alleles each parent can contribute:

1. **Parent 1 (Type B)**: Genotype is B/B. They can only contribute the B allele.
2. **Parent 2 (Type AB)**: Genotype is A/B. They can contribute either the A allele or the B allele.

The possible genotype combinations for the child are:
- **B (from Parent 1) + A (from Parent 2) → AB (Type A)**
- **B (from Parent 1) + B (from Parent 2) → BB (Type B)**

Thus, the child can only be Type A or Type B. Type O blood requires neither A nor B antigens, which is impossible in this scenario. Therefore, the probability of the child having type O blood is **0%**.
