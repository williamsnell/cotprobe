Okay, so I need to find the value of b where the parabola y₁ = x² + 2x + 7 and the line y₂ = 6x + b intersect at only one point. Hmm, when two graphs intersect at only one point, that means they are tangent to each other. So, I think I should set the equations equal to each other and then ensure that the resulting equation has exactly one solution. That would happen when the discriminant is zero.

Let me write that down. So, setting y₁ equal to y₂: x² + 2x + 7 = 6x + b. Let's bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. Subtract 6x and b from both sides: x² + 2x + 7 - 6x - b = 0. Simplify that: x² - 4x + (7 - b) = 0.

Now, this is a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a is 1, b is -4, and c is (7 - b). Wait, no, I think I need to be careful here. The variable is x, so the coefficients are a = 1, b_coeff = -4, and c = (7 - b). 

But wait, the standard form is ax² + bx + c = 0, so in this case, the variable is x, so the coefficients are:

a = 1
b_coeff (from x term) = -4
c = (7 - b)

Wait, hold on, the original line is y₂ = 6x + b, so when I set it equal, I subtracted 6x and b, so the equation becomes x² -4x + (7 - b) = 0. So yes, that's correct.

Now, for the quadratic equation to have exactly one solution, the discriminant should be zero. The discriminant D is given by D = (b_coeff)^2 - 4ac. Plugging in the values: D = (-4)^2 - 4*1*(7 - b).

Calculating that: (-4)^2 is 16. Then 4ac is 4*1*(7 - b) = 4*(7 - b) = 28 - 4b.

So D = 16 - (28 - 4b) = 16 - 28 + 4b = (-12) + 4b.

Set D = 0 for the equation to have exactly one solution: 0 = -12 + 4b.

Now solving for b: 4b = 12 → b = 3.

Wait, that can't be right because 3 is one of the options. Let me check the options again. The options are A:10, B:5, C:3, D:12, E:4, F:6, G:8, H:7, I:2, J:9. So yes, option C is 3. That's one of the options, so I think that's correct.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Let me go through it again.

Start with y₁ = x² + 2x + 7 and y₂ = 6x + b. Setting them equal: x² + 2x +7 =6x + b → x² +2x +7 -6x -b =0 → x² -4x + (7 -b) =0.

Quadratic in x: a=1, b_coeff=-4, c=7 -b.

Discriminant D = (-4)^2 -4*1*(7 -b) = 16 -28 +4b = (-12)+4b.

Set D=0: -12 +4b=0 → 4b=12 → b=3.

Yes, that's correct. So the value of b is 3, which is option C.

To determine the value of \( b \) where the parabola \( y_1 = x^2 + 2x + 7 \) and the line \( y_2 = 6x + b \) intersect at only one point, we set the equations equal to each other:

\[
x^2 + 2x + 7 = 6x + b
\]

Rearranging terms gives:

\[
x^2 - 4x + (7 - b) = 0
\]

For the line and parabola to intersect at only one point, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be zero. The discriminant \( D \) is given by:

\[
D = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(7 - b) = 16 - 28 + 4b = -12 + 4b
\]

Setting \( D = 0 \):

\[
-12 + 4b = 0 \implies 4b = 12 \implies b = 3
\]

Thus, the value of \( b \) is **3**.
