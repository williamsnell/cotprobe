Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to break it down. The question says we have a diatomic gas that's being compressed reversibly and adiabatically. We're given some data, and we need to find the change in internal energy, ΔU.

First, I remember that for an adiabatic process, there's no heat exchange, so Q is zero. The first law of thermodynamics is ΔU = Q - W. Since Q is zero, ΔU equals negative work done on the system. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Let me think again: ΔU is Q plus W for the system. Since it's adiabatic, Q is zero. So ΔU equals negative the work done by the system. Or wait, maybe I have that backwards. Let me get this straight.

Wait, no, the first law is ΔU = Q + W, where W is the work done on the system. So in an adiabatic process, Q is zero, so ΔU = W (on the system). So if work is done on the system, ΔU is positive. But wait, in this case, the gas is being compressed. So work would be done on the system because the system is being compressed. So the work done on the system is positive, which would make ΔU positive.

Wait, but wait another thing. The process is reversible and adiabatic. So for a reversible adiabatic process, the work done is related to the temperature change. I think the formula for adiabatic processes is TV^(γ-1) = constant, and for monoatomic gases, γ is 5/3, but for diatomic gases, γ is 7/5. Oh right, because diatomic gases have more degrees of freedom, increasing γ.

Wait, the question gives us CV,m as 27.5 J/(K·mol). For diatomic gases, I remember that the molar heat capacities are CV,m = (3/2)R for monatomic, and for diatomic, it's (5/2)R because they have more degrees of freedom. Let me calculate γ. γ is (Cp)/(Cv), right? And Cp = Cv + R. So for diatomic, Cv,m is (5/2)R, and Cp,m is (7/2)R. So γ is (7/2 R) / (5/2 R) )= 7/5 = 1.4. Yeah, that's right.

So here, the process is adiabatic. So we can use the relation between temperature and volume: TV^(γ-1) = constant. Alternatively, we can find the work done during the process, then use ΔU = n Cv,m (T2 - T1).

Wait, since it's an adiabatic process, and we're given that it's a compression, the temperature increases, so the internal energy increases. The internal energy change would be positive, so our answer should be a positive ΔU.

The problem states that the gas is diatomic, so Cv,m is 27.5 J/(K·mol). The number of moles is 3.00. The final temperature is 250 K, initial is 200 K.

So, ΔU = n Cv,m (T2 - T1). Let me plug in the numbers. 

n = 3.00 mol.

Cv,m = 27.5 J/(K·mol).

T2 = 250 K, T1 = 200 K.

So the difference is 50 K. Multiplying 3 * 27.5 * 50.

Let me compute that: 3 * 27.5 is 82.5, multiplied by 50 gives 4125 J. Which is 4.125 kJ. So about 4.1 kJ. Looking at the options, I see option G is +4.1 kJ. But wait, none of the options beyond G are correct.

Wait, let me double-check. I used the formula correctly. So, the change in internal energy is positive because the temperature increases, which for a diatomic gas, is expected. So option G is +4.1 kJ.

But wait, the answer options are A to J. Oh, looking back, the options are:

A: +5.8 kJ

B: +6.3 kJ

C: +2.5 kJ

D: +3.0 kJ

E: +3.7 kJ

F: +7.0 kJ

G: +4.1 kJ

H: +5.2 kJ

I: +4.8 kJ

J: +4.5 kJ

So G is +4.1 kJ, which matches my calculation. But wait, is there another approach?

Alternatively, since it's an adiabatic process, the work done is W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / (γ-1). But I don't have the pressures or volumes. Alternatively, since it's a reversible process, we can use the relation PV^γ = constant.

Wait, another approach: For an adiabatic process, the change in internal energy is ΔU = n Cv,m (T2 - T1). We have all the values, so it's straightforward. So the internal energy change is 3 * 27.5 *50 = 4125 J = 4.125 kJ, which is about 4.1 kJ. So correct answer is G.

To determine the change in internal energy, ΔU, for the given adiabatic compression process, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta U = n C_{v,m} (T_2 - T_1)
\]

### Given Data:
- \( n = 3.00 \, \text{mol} \)
- \( C_{v,m} = 27.5 \, \text{J/K·mol} \)
- \( T_1 = 200 \, \text{K} \)
- \( T_2 = 250 \, \text{K} \)

### Calculation:
1. Compute the temperature difference:
   \[
   \Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 250 \, \text{K} - 200 \, \text{K} = 50 \, \text{K}
   \]

2. Multiply the values:
   \[
   \Delta U = 3.00 \, \text{mol} \times 27.5 \, \text{J/K·mol} \times 50 \, \text{K} = 4125 \, \text{J} = 4.125 \, \text{kJ}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The change in internal energy is approximately \( +4.1 \, \text{kJ} \), which matches option G. Since the temperature increases during the compression, the internal energy increases, making the result consistent with the sign of the calculation.
