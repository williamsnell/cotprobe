Question:

This question refers to the following information.
[T]he the end and measure of this power, when in every man's hands in the state of nature, being the preservation of all of his society, that is, all mankind in general, it can have no other end or measure, when in the hands of the magistrate, but to preserve the members of that society in their lives, liberties, and possessions, and so cannot be an absolute, arbitrary power over their lives and fortunes, which are as much as possible to be preserved, but a power to make law, and annex such penalties to them, as may tend to the preservation of the whole by cutting off those parts, and those only, which are so corrupt that they threaten the sound and healthy, without which no severity is lawful. And this power has its original only from compact, and agreement, and the mutual consent of those who make up the community. â€¦
Whensoever, therefore, the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about John Locke's philosophy, specifically from his second Treatise on Government. The question is about what Locke believed a government loses its legitimacy when. Let me try to unpack this.

First, I'll read through the passage again to make sure I understand it. The passage talks about a power called the "power of the magistrates" and its relationship to the preservation of society. It mentions that when the magistrates have power, they can enforce laws through penalties. However, if they don't follow through on these penalties properly, the people lose this power because they can't achieve the results they desired.

So, the key points here are about the balance between the government's power and its legitimacy. If the magistrates can't enforce penalties properly, the people lose their right to obey them because they can't cut off the parts that threaten society's health.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one fits this scenario. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: When the people wish to change governors. Hmm, I'm not sure. The passage doesn't mention the people wanting to change governors. It's more about the consequences of the magistrates not fulfilling their role properly.

Option B: It does not have penalties for breaking the law. Well, the passage says that penalties are in place when the magistrates have power, but if they're broken, the people lose this power. So this option is the opposite of the scenario we're considering. The question is about losing legitimacy, not about the absence of penalties.

Option C: It tries to exercise absolute power. The passage mentions that the magistrates have a primary role in enforcing laws, but the original power comes from the community's agreement through compact and mutual consent. If they try to exercise absolute power, that's a different scenario, maybe a form of tyranny, but it's not exactly what the passage is talking about.

Option D: It does not have a legislative body. The passage says the magistrates have a power, but it's not explicitly stated whether they don't have their own legislative body. The original power was through compact agreements, but if they tried to enforce without a body, that's a different issue. But the question is about the consequences of their actions, so this might not be the correct answer.

Option E: It does not enact laws. The passage says that when the magistrates have power, they can enforce penalties, but it doesn't say they don't enact laws. In fact, the magistrates do enact laws, which are then enforced. So this option is incorrect.

Option F: It is weak and can be overthrown. The passage says that if the magistrates don't enforce penalties correctly, the people's power is gone. So the government isn't weak in any way but is compromised. So this isn't correct either.

Option G: The people do not follow the laws. The passage implies that if the magistrates enforce penalties, the people can't do anything about it. So if the magistrates don't act, the people lose their authority. But why would the people not follow the laws if the magistrates are supposed to enforce them? Maybe because if the laws are broken, the people lose control. So the people don't follow the laws because they can't enforce them. Therefore, maybe G is the answer.

Wait, but the original point was that if the magistrates can't enforce penalties, the people lose their power. So the people don't follow the laws because the magistrates have power to enforce them. But the question is about what Locke believed the government loses its legitimacy when. So when the magistrates have power and can enforce, but if they don't, the people don't follow the laws. So in that case, the people can't follow the laws because their own authority is compromised. So which option says that?

But looking back, the options are about the state of the government's legitimacy. The passage says that when the magistrates (the government) have power, they can enforce laws. But if they don't, the people lose their power because they can't comply. So the government's power is compromised when the magistrates have the power without proper enforcement. But what does the question ask? It's asking what the government loses when...

Wait, the wording of the question is a bit tricky. Let me read the question again: "it loses its legitimacy when..." So when does the government lose its legitimacy? It seems like when the magistrates (the government) can't properly enforce their laws, the people lose their power because they can't comply. That means the government's power is compromised. So the government's legitimacy is gone when they can't enforce laws.

But the options don't mention the government losing its power directly. Let me look at the options again. Option D is "it does not have a legislative body." The passage says the magistrates have their power through a compact agreement, so they have a body (the magistrates). So that's not the case. So D is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question's answer is about the consequences of the magistrates not following through on their role. So when the magistrates don't follow through, the people lose their power. So they cannot follow the laws when the magistrates have the power. Therefore, the answer is G.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The passage says that the magistrates have a primary role, but the authority of the people comes from their hands. If the magistrates have power, they can enforce laws. But when they don't, the people lose the ability to enforce. So the people can't follow the laws because their power is gone. So when the magistrates (the government) have the power without acting, the people lose their authority. Therefore, the state loses its legitimacy when the magistrates don't properly enforce their laws.

So the answer relates to the state losing its power when the magistrates don't effectively enforce their laws. So the options, looking for the one that states that the government doesn't have the authority to enforce laws without consequences.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is G: the people do not follow the laws. Because without the magistrates enforcing, they can't do so because they lose their power to follow the laws.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C: it tries to exercise absolute power. Wait, the original power comes from the community's agreements, not absolute power. So C isn't correct.

Wait, the passage says that the magistrates' power comes from the community's agreement and mutual consent. If they try to exercise absolute power, they break the compact. So if they try to enforce without the community's consent, that would be a different issue. But in the passage, they do enforce when they have power, so the issue is when the power is correctly used.

So the question is, when does the government lose its legitimacy? It's when the magistrates don't enforce their laws properly. So the people can't comply, which means the state loses its authority.

Wait, but the options: looking for the point where the government's power is compromised. The passage says that if the magistrates (the government) have power, they can enforce. But if they don't, the people lose their power. So the state's legitimacy is compromised when the magistrates fail to enforce. Therefore, the state's power is weakened.

Which option corresponds to that? Let's read the options again.

Option G: the people do not follow the laws.

So when the magistrates have the power, they enforce. If they don't, the people can't follow. So when the magistrates lack enforcement, the people can't follow the laws. So the state loses its power when the magistrates don't properly enforce. So the state loses its authority when the people can't follow the laws because the magistrates have proper power to enforce.

Wait, but the options don't mention the people losing their power. The options are about the state losing its legitimacy. So the answer relates to the state losing its power when they lack enforcement.

But the options provided don't include this. Let me re-examine the options.

Option G says: "it is weak and can be overthrown." If the state is weak, it could be overthrown. But the passage says the magistrates have the power to enforce, but without enforcement they lose power. So the state isn't weak; their power is compromised. So option G isn't correct.

Wait, another approach. The passage says that when the magistrates have power, they enforce. If they don't, the people cannot comply. So the state's power is compromised when the magistrates have the power but can't enforce. So the state loses its authority.

Now, looking at the options, the correct answer is the one that states "the people do not follow the laws," which would happen when the magistrates have the power to enforce but fail. So the state's power is lost because the people can't follow the laws. So the answer would be G.

Wait, but let's think about the options. The question is asking what the government loses when. So when the magistrates can't enforce, the state loses its power. But the options don't directly state that. The options suggest that the state's power is compromised.

The options are:

A: when people change governors. Unrelated.

B: no penalties. Unrelated.

C: tries to exercise absolute power. Unrelated.

D: doesn't have legislative body. The passage says they have a compact, so D is incorrect.

E: doesn't enact laws. No, they do.

F: is weak. No, state isn't weak.

G: people don't follow laws. That's what happens when the magistrates have the power without enforcement.

So the correct answer is G: the people do not follow the laws.
</think>

The question asks about the state's loss of legitimacy when the magistrates have power but fail to enforce laws. The analysis of the passage reveals that when the magistrates (the government) have the power to enforce laws, they do so by enacting penalties. However, if they fail to do so, the people lose their authority to follow the laws. This scenario leads to the state losing its legitimacy because the people can no longer comply with the law.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The state does not lose its power when people wish to change governors.
- **B**: Incorrect. The state does not lack penalties; they do enforce them when the magistrates have power.
- **C**: Incorrect. The state does not try to exercise absolute power; it relies on the compact and mutual consent of the community.
- **D**: Incorrect. The state does have a legislative body, as the compact ensures its existence.
- **E**: Incorrect. The state does enact laws, and the consequences of breaking these laws are addressed.
- **F**: Incorrect. The state is not weak; it is compromised when the magistrates fail to enforce.
- **G**: Correct. The state loses its legitimacy when the people cannot follow the laws, as the magistrates' power is undermined.
