Okay, so I've got this problem to solve: I need to find the sum of all positive integers less than 196 that are relatively prime to 98. Hmm, relative prime means they have a GCD of 1, right? So, I need to count all numbers less than 196 that don't share any factors with 98 except 1.

Wait, 98 is an even number, so it's factors are 2 and 49. Because 98 divided by 2 is 49, which is 7 squared. So the prime factors of 98 are 2 and 7.

Now, I need to find numbers less than 196 that aren't divisible by 2 or 7. Because if they are, they won't be relatively prime to 98.

I remember that Euler's Totient Function φ(n) gives the count of numbers less than n that are coprime to n. But here, we're dealing with a range up to 195, not just up to n-1. So maybe I can use a formula to calculate the sum directly.

Wait, how does that work? I think the sum of numbers less than n and coprime to n can be expressed in terms of φ(n) multiplied by some average or something. Because φ(n) counts how many numbers are coprime, but their average might be (n-1)/2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the density of numbers not divisible by 2 or 7. Since 2 and 7 are the prime factors of 98, any number not divisible by 2 or 7 is coprime to 98.

So, the count of such numbers is φ(98) multiplied by something. Wait, no, φ(98) is the count of numbers less than 98 that are coprime to it. But we need up to 195, which is more than 98.

Wait, let's compute φ(98). Since 98 is 2 * 7^2, φ(98) = 98 * (1-1/2) * (1-1/7) = 98 * 1/2 * 6/7 = 98 * (3/7) = 42. So there are 42 numbers less than 98 that are coprime to 98. But we need up to 195.

Hmm, perhaps the numbers from 1 to 195. The total count would be the count up to 195. But 195 is 98 * 2 -1? Wait, 98*2 is 196, so 195 is one before 196. So up to 195, which is 98*2 -1.

I think I can use the fact that every block of 98 numbers will have 42 numbers coprime to 98. So, how many full blocks are there in 195? Let's see, 195 divided by 98 is 1 full block (98 numbers) and then 97 more numbers (since 98*2 is 196, which is beyond 195). So, 1 full block and a partial block of 97 numbers.

Wait, no: 198 is 98*2=196, so 195 is just 196-1=195. So the first 98 numbers (1-98) have 42 coprimes. Then the next 98 (99-196) would also have another 42 coprimes, but we're stopping at 195, which is 196-1. So the last block includes 95 numbers (since 195-98=97, but starting from 99, the numbers are 99-195, which is 97 numbers).

So, the total count of coprimes would be 42 (from 1-98) + 42 (from 99-196) minus the ones beyond 195. Wait no, because 196 is not included, so the last block from 99-195 is 97 numbers. So how many coprimes are there in the last 97 numbers?

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to compute the sum of coprimes less than 196, which is the same as numbers from 1 to 195 that are coprime to 98.

Alternatively, the sum from 1 to N of numbers coprime to n can be calculated by considering how many complete cycles of n are there and then the partial cycle.

Wait, but 196 is 2*98, so perhaps the sum can be found by considering the sum of coprimes in each 98 block and then adding the sum of coprimes in the partial block (1-195).

Wait, but perhaps I can model this as follows:

The sum of numbers coprime to 98 less than 196 is equal to the sum of numbers from 1 to 195, minus the sum of numbers not coprime to 98 in that range.

But that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the sum of numbers coprime to n up to a certain limit.

Wait, I think there's a formula that the sum of numbers coprime to n up to N can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion or using the formula involving Euler's totient function, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that the sum of numbers less than or equal to m that are coprime to n can be found in terms of the totient function and the average.

Wait, another approach: numbers less than 196 that are coprime to 98 are those not divisible by 2 or 7. So, the sum would be the sum of all numbers from 1 to 195 minus the sum of numbers divisible by 2 and 7 in that range.

But wait, that would be the sum of numbers coprime to 98 in 1-195. Because numbers not divisible by 2 or 7 are coprime.

Yes, that's a good approach.

So, Sum = sum(1 to 195) - sum(numbers divisible by 2 in 1-195) - sum(numbers divisible by 7 in 1-195) + sum(numbers divisible by both 2 and 7 in 1-195). Because when you subtract numbers divisible by 2 and 7, you've subtracted the multiples of 14 twice, so you need to add them back once.

So let's compute each part.

First, sum(1 to 195) is (195 * 196)/2 = (195 * 196)/2.

Sum(1-195) = (195 * 196)/2 = (195 * 98) = 195 * 98. Let me compute that: 200*98=19600, minus 5*98=490 → 19600-490=19110.

Next, sum of numbers divisible by 2 up to 195: these are the even numbers. The count of such numbers is floor(195/2)=97 (since 196 is even, but 196 is beyond 195). So 97 numbers. The sum is 2 + 4 + ... + 194. The sum is 2*(1 + 2 + ... + 97). The sum from 1 to 97 is (97*98)/2. So the sum is 2*(97*98/2) = 97*98 = 9506.

Wait, 97*98: 100*98=9800, minus 3*98=294 → 9800-294=9506. So sum divisible by 2 is 9506.

Now, sum of numbers divisible by 7 up to 195: the count is floor(195/7). 7*27=189, 7*28=196. So 27 numbers. The sum is 7*(1 + 2 + ... +27) =7*(27*28/2) =7*(378)=2646.

Wait, 27*28/2 = (27*28)=756/2=378. Multiply by 7: 378*7. 300*7=2100, 78*7=546 → 2100+546=2646. So sum is 2646.

Now, the sum of numbers divisible by both 2 and 7 (i.e., by 14) up to 195: the count is floor(195/14). 14*13=182, 14*14=196. So 13 numbers. The sum is 14*(1+2+...+13) =14*(13*14/2) =14*(91) = 1274.

Now, putting it all together:

Sum = (195*196/2) - (sum divisible by 2) - (sum divisible by 7) + (sum divisible by 14)
= 19110 - 9506 - 2646 + 1274

Let me compute step by step.

19110 - 9506 = 9604
9604 - 2646 = 6958
6958 + 1274 = 8232.

So the sum is 8232. Looking at the options, option C is 8232. So the answer should be C.

The sum of all positive integers less than 196 and relatively prime to 98 is calculated by considering numbers not divisible by 2 or 7. Using inclusion-exclusion, the sum is computed as 8232.
