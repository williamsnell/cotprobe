Okay, so I have this question about the Pleiades star cluster. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Pleiades.

The Pleiades is a well-known open star cluster, right? I remember it's located towards the northwest of the galaxy. I think it's one of the oldest star clusters in the galaxy, older than the Pleiades, which is about 12 billion years old. Wait, no, I think the Pleiades is actually the oldest open cluster, which is about 12 billion years old. But I'm not entirely sure about its position.

The question is about what it plays into ancient stories and what it contains. Oh right, the Pleiades is a common setting for ancient myth, like in the story of Orion the Great, where the Pleiades are the stars he sees on his way to the horizon. So that's probably why it's bright.

Now, the question asks about the number of bright stars it contains. The options are 5,7,9,12. I'm trying to remember if there's a specific number tied to the Pleiades. Oh wait, I think the Pleiades consists of 12 individual stars. Each Pleiad is a small, bright star. So if there are 12 stars, that would make the answer D:12.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I think the cluster name is connected to the number. Let me think again. I think the cluster is named after the Pleiades, which is 12 bright stars. So each of these stars is part of the cluster, making the total count 12. So the question is about what the cluster contains, which would be 12 bright stars.

The Pleiades is an open star cluster containing 12 bright stars. Each star in the Pleiades is part of the cluster, making the total count 12 bright stars.
