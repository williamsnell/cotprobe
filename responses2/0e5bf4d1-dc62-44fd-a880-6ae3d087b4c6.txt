The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man kidnapped a victim in State A and transported the victim across the state border into State B. These actions violated the kidnapping laws of both states, which are identical. A jury convicted the man in a State A court, but the trial judge gave what prosecutors in State B deemed an unduly lenient sentence. The state prosecutor in State B then commenced a kidnapping case against the man for violating State B's kidnapping statute. The man's lawyer has filed a motion in State B to dismiss the charge based on the double jeopardy protection against a second prosecution for the man's single act of kidnapping. Should the court grant the motion to dismiss?

Options:

A: No, because the man committed two separate acts of kidnapping, one in each state.
B: Yes, because the man was already tried and convicted for the same crime in State A.
C: Yes, because the double jeopardy protection applies to both state and federal laws.
D: No, because the man's conduct violated the laws of two different states, and each has the right to enforce its laws. right to enforce its laws.
E: No, because the double jeopardy protection only applies to federal law.
F: Yes, because the double jeopardy protection applies even when laws of different states are identical.
G: No, because the man's sentence in State A was deemed unduly lenient in State B.
H: Yes, because the government is collaterally estopped under the double jeopardy protection from prosecuting a defendant a second time for the same conduct that led to an earlier conviction.
I: Yes, because the double jeopardy protection prohibits a second prosecution following a conviction for the same offense.
J: No, because the double jeopardy protection only prohibits a second prosecution following an acquittal for the same offense.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the court should dismiss the man's kidnapping charge in State B. The question is about the double jeopardy protection, which I remember is a legal principle that states a person can't be tried twice for the same offense. 

Let me think about the facts. The man was kidnapped in State A and transported to State B. Both states have the same laws. So, if he's guilty of kidnapping in State A, State B's laws are identical, so the charge in B is the same as in A.

But the problem is, in State A, he was tried and convicted. Then, in State B, the prosecutor thinks the sentence given was unduly lenient. The man's lawyer is suing for a second chance in State B, claiming double jeopardy applies because he's already tried and convicted.

Double jeopardy is about not being tried twice for the same offense. So in State A, he's tried once and convicted. Now, in State B, he's being tried again for the same offense. So according to double jeopardy, the second trial should be dismissed, right?

Looking at the options, option I says that the double jeopardy protection prohibits a second prosecution following an acquittal for the same offense. That seems correct. But wait, in State A, he was convicted, but State B is a different state. The prosecution in B is under the same laws as in A, but the double jeopardy applies regardless of the state. So the state of the country doesn't matter, just the same offense.

Wait, but the double jeopardy applies to the same offense in the same jurisdiction. So in State A, he's guilty. In State B, if he's tried again for the same offense, the second trial is barred. So the first trial was in A, and the second in B. But wait, each state's law is the same, so the double jeopardy applies to the same offense regardless of state.

So, the man's motion in State B is based on double jeopardy, which should be allowed. Therefore, the court should dismiss the charge in B. So looking at the options, option I says that the double jeopardy protection prohibits a second prosecution following an acquittal. But wait, was he acquitted or tried again? Oh, the man is being tried again in State B. So the prosecution in B is a second trial.

Wait, actually, in State B, the prosecution is based on the same law because the states have identical laws. So if he was convicted in A, and now he's being tried again in B, that's a second prosecution. So under double jeopardy, he can't be tried again for the same offense. Therefore, the motion should be granted to dismiss. So the correct answer is I.

Wait, but let me look at the options again:

Option I: Yes, because the double jeopardy protection prohibits a second prosecution following an acquittal for the same offense.

So if he's being tried again, and it's a second trial, then yes. So the answer is I. But wait, the man was already convicted, so did he get acquitted? The question doesn't say he's acquitted, just that he was convicted in A and now facing a second charge in B. So he's being tried again, so a second trial. Hence, he's under double jeopardy, so the motion should be granted.

Wait, the options don't have I as the correct answer. Let me double-check the options.

Looking back:

Option I: Yes, because the double jeopardy protection prohibits a second prosecution following an acquittal for the same offense.

Wait, in State A, he was convicted (acquitted or not?)â€”the question doesn't say if he was acquitted. It just says he was convicted in A and now facing a second charge in B. So he was tried again, which would be a second trial. So according to double jeopardy, yes, the motion should be granted.

Another option is option H: Yes, because the government is collaterally estopped under the double jeopardy protection from prosecuting a defendant a second time for the same conduct that led to an earlier conviction. Hmm, but I'm not sure if collaterally estopped applies here. The double jeopardy applies to the same offense regardless of the state, so collaterally estopped might not be the right term. So perhaps option I is the right answer.

Wait, another thought: The double jeopardy applies even if the prosecution is in a different state. The fact that it's the same state's law in terms of the crime doesn't affect the double jeopardy. So regardless of where he's tried, if he's convicted, a second trial is barred.

Wait, but wait, double jeopardy is in the same jurisdiction. So if he's convicted in one jurisdiction, he's barred from being tried again in the same jurisdiction. So in State A, he's tried once, convicted, so no second trial in A. But in State B, he's being tried again for the same offense, so double jeopardy applies.

Looking at the options again, option I says that the second prosecution is barred because of an acquittal. So if he was acquitted, then I think the first trial was a conviction, leading to a second trial. But if he was already convicted, then the second trial is barred. 

But the problem doesn't state whether he was acquitted. So the prosecution in B is for the same offense he was convicted of in A. So the man's motion is that he's being tried again, which is a second trial for the same offense, and thus, under double jeopardy, the trial should be dismissed.

So the correct answer is I. But wait, looking at the options, option H says that the government is estopped under double jeopardy. But I think the correct reasoning is that the double jeopardy applies regardless of where the prosecution is in the same state.

Wait, another angle: State A and State B have the same laws. So the double jeopardy protection applies because he's being tried again for the same offense in State B. So the answer is I.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is correct. So the answer is I.

The correct answer is I. The double jeopardy protection prohibits a second prosecution following an acquittal for the same offense. In this case, the man was convicted in State A and now faces a second charge in State B for the same offense. Since he was already tried and convicted in State A, he is barred from being tried again for the same offense in State B, as the double jeopardy protection applies regardless of the state in which the prosecution is conducted. This defense would allow the court to dismiss the charge in State B.
