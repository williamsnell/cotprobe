Okay, so I've got this pulley problem here. Let's see what it's about. I remember that pulleys have different diameters and when they rotate, their speeds are related. But wait, there's a belt driving them, so I think the key here is the no-slip condition, which means the belt doesn't slip, so the linear speed at the edge of both pulleys must be the same.

The problem says the driver pulley's diameter is 15 inches, and the driven one is 8 inches. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the driver is driving a pulley. So the pulley with 8-inch diameter is the driver? Or wait, no, the first line says: "A pulley 8 in. in diameter rotates at 500 rpm and drives a 15 in. diameter pulley." So the 8-inch pulley is the driver, it's driving the 15-inch pulley. So the 8-inch is the one making the 15-inch rotate slower because it's faster but the belt has to move around both.

So the first part is about no slip condition, so their linear speeds must be equal. So the speed of the edge of the driver pulley equals the edge of the driven pulley.

The formula for linear speed is v = π * d * rpm / 60. Or wait, no, wait. No, maybe it's v = ω * r, but ω is in radians per second. Alternatively, since we can relate the speeds through their diameters.

Wait, another approach: the linear speed v is the same for both pulleys. So v = (diameter) * ω * (1/60). Or maybe v = (diameter) * (rotations per minute) * (π/30) because ω in rad/s is (rpm * 2π)/60 = π/30 rad/s.

Wait, but perhaps for this problem, it's easier to use the ratio of diameters. Because when two pulleys are connected by a belt, the linear speed is the same, so v = ω1 * r1 = ω2 * r2. Since r is diameter over two, so ω1 * (d1/2) = ω2 * (d2/2). The 2's cancel, so ω1 * d1 = ω2 * d2. Wait, no wait, if ω is in rpm, then the formula for linear speed would be v = (diameter * rpm) * (π/30). Because rpm is per minute, so in radians per minute, each rpm is 2π radians per minute. So to get per second, divide by 60. So ω in rpm is equal to (2π * rpm) / 60 = π/30 * rpm per second.

Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of rpm and diameters. The linear speed v for a pulley is v = (diameter) * (rpm) * (π/30). Because circumference is π*d, so per minute, it's π*d * rpm. But since that's per minute, to get per second, we divide by 60. So v = (d * rpm * π) / 60. Alternatively, v = (d * rpm) / (60/π) )? Hmm, maybe I'm complicating.

Alternatively, the linear speed is the same for both pulleys. So v = (d1 * ω1) = (d2 * ω2), where ω is in radians per second. But since we're dealing in rpm, we can relate them as:

v = (d1 * rpm1) * (π/30) = (d2 * rpm2) * (π/30)

Wait, because for each rotation, the distance covered is the circumference, which is π*d. So in one minute, the linear speed is d rpm * π (since circumference is π*d). But wait, no. Wait, for each revolution (60 rpm), the distance moved is the circumference. So 60 rpm is 60 * π * d. So in one minute, the belt moves 60 * π * d inches. So for 500 rpm, the belt moves 500 * π * 8 inches per minute. Then, for the driven pulley, 15-inch diameter, so the rotational speed ω2 is (500 * π * 8) / (15 * π) ) = (500 * 8) / 15. Because the linear speeds must be equal.

Wait, let me rephrase that. The linear speed v is the same for both. So v = 8 inches * 500 rpm * (π/30) ? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for linear speed is v = ω * r, where ω is in radians per second, and r is in meters or inches. But perhaps another approach is to think in terms of the number of teeth, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since the belt is moving, the distance moved per unit time is equal for both pulleys. So for the driver (8-inch diameter, 500 rpm), the belt moves 500 rpm * circumference of driver. The circumference is π*d, so 8 * π inches per rpm. So the belt moves 500 * 8 * π inches per minute.

This same distance is then covered by the driven pulley, which has a diameter of 15 inches. So the driven pulley's rotational speed, ω2, must satisfy: 15 inches * ω2 (in inches per second) = 500 * 8 * π inches per minute. Wait, but wait, let me think about units.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the linear speed in inches per minute, and then find the rotational speed in rpm.

So, driver's linear speed: v = 8 inches * 500 rpm = 4000 inches per minute.

Then, this same v must equal the driven pulley's linear speed, which is 15 inches * ω2 (in rpm). So 15 * ω2 = 4000. So ω2 = 4000 / 15 ≈ 266.666... rpm. So approximately 266.666 rpm.

Wait, but the question is about the driver's pulley. Wait, no, no, the first part is about the driver pulley's speed when no slip occurs, but wait the first part is the driver's speed. Wait, no, wait, the first part asks about the driver pulley's speed, but wait, no: the question is, the driver pulley is driving a 15-inch diameter pulley. So the driver is 8-inch, so when it rotates at 500 rpm, it drives a 15-inch pulley. So the question is, what is the speed of the driver pulley? Wait, no, wait the question says, "Determine the speed of the driver pulley for a condition of no slip between the pulley and the belt and then for a total loss (slip and creep) of 2%."

Wait, no, wait. No, the question is phrased: "Determine the speed of the driver pulley for a condition of no slip between the pulley and the belt and then for a total loss (slip and creep) of 2%."

Wait, wait, the wording is confusing. Oh wait, the question says: "the driver pulley" and "the driven pulley." So in the first part, no slip. So the driver's speed is the 500 rpm, and the driven pulley's speed is 4000/15 ≈ 266.666 rpm.

But the question is, "the speed of the driver pulley." Oh wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Wait, the question is about the driver pulley's speed. So when the driver is driving the 15-inch pulley, the driver's speed is 500 rpm, because the driver is the one rotating. Wait, no, no: no slip implies that the driver is the one rotating, and the driven pulley is being driven by the driver. So the driver's speed is 500 rpm, and the driven one is 4000/15 ≈ 266.666 rpm.

Wait, but then the question says "the speed of the driver pulley for a condition of no slip." So the driver's speed is 500 rpm. Wait, but the second part is when there's a total loss (slip and creep) of 2%. So that's when the speed is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the first part is the driver's speed, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, let me re-examine the question.

The question says: "Determine the speed of the driver pulley for a condition of no slip between the pulley and the belt and then for a total loss (slip and creep) of 2%."

Wait, that phrasing is a bit confusing. Because when the driver (8-inch) drives the 15-inch, the driver's speed is 500 rpm. But the driven pulley's speed is slower. So if the question is about the driver's speed, in the no-slip case, it's 500 rpm. Then, for total loss of 2%, the driven pulley's speed would be lower.

Wait, I think perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me clarify.

The driver pulley is the one that is rotating, and it's the one that is driving the 15-inch pulley. So in the no-slip case, the driver's speed is 500 rpm, and the driven pulley's speed is 500 * (d1/d2) (since linear speed is same). Wait, no, wait. No, the linear speed is same for both.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The linear speed at the edge of the driver (8-inch) is v = (π * d1) * (rpm1) / 60. So for 8-inch, 500 rpm: v = (π * 8) * 500 / 60 = (8000 π ) / 60 ≈ 418.879 inches per minute.

Then, the driven pulley (15-inch) has the same linear speed, so v = (π * 15) * rpm2 / 60.

Set equal: (π *8 *500)/60 = (π *15 * rpm2)/60.

We can cancel π and 60 from both sides:

8 * 500 = 15 * rpm2.

So rpm2 = (8 *500)/15 = 4000 / 15 = 266.666... rpm, which is 266.666... rpm.

So the driver's speed is 500 rpm (no slip case), and the driven is 266.666 rpm.

But wait, the question is phrased as "determine the speed of the driver pulley for a condition of no slip..." So it's about the driver's speed. So the first part would be 500 rpm, the second part is 266.666 rpm.

But the answer options don't have 500 as a choice. Wait, the options are A to J, and the options are all lower. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing which pulley is the driver. Oh, wait, the problem states that the driver pulley is the 8-inch one, and it's driving the 15-inch pulley. So in the no-slip case, the driver's speed is 500 rpm, and the driven's is 266.666 rpm.

But looking at the options, the only 266.666 is not in the choices. Wait, let me check the options. The options include 261.4, 250, 265, etc. Hmm, 266.666 isn't listed. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the first part is the driver's speed when no slip. Wait, no: the driver is the one that's driving, so its speed is the one we're to find for the no-slip case, which is 500 rpm. But in the options, that's not present. Wait, perhaps I read the problem wrong.

Wait, the problem says: "Determine the speed of the driver pulley for a condition of no slip..."

Ah! No, wait, no. The driver is the 8-inch, so the driver's speed is the one that's being driven by the belt. Or wait, no, perhaps the driver is the 15-inch pulley? Hmm, no, the problem says the 8-inch is the driver, so it's the one that drives the 15-inch.

Wait, perhaps the initial statement is that the 8-inch is the driver, and the 15-inch is the driven. So in the no-slip case, the driver's speed is 500 rpm, and the driven is 266.666 rpm.

But in the options, the closest is option B: 261.4. Hmm, why the difference?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.

So, the linear speed of the driver's edge is 8 inches * 500 rpm.

Each minute, the driver's edge moves 8 * 500 = 4000 inches.

The driven pulley's circumference is 15π inches. So the driven pulley must rotate such that 15π inches * (number of rotations) = 4000 inches.

So number of rotations per minute (rpm) is 4000 / (15π) ≈ 4000 / (47.1239) ≈ 84.823 rpm.

Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Wait, no. Wait, no, because that's not considering the 60 seconds. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the units.

Wait, let me think in terms of linear speed.

The linear speed v is 8 inches * 500 rpm = 4000 inches per minute.

The driven pulley's circumference is 15 inches * π = 47.1239 inches.

So each rotation, the driven pulley moves 47.1239 inches.

So to cover 4000 inches, the driven pulley must rotate 4000 / 47.1239 ≈ 84.823 rpm.

Wait, 4000 divided by 47.1239 is approximately 84.823. So 84.823 is about 84.8 rpm, but none of the options are close to that. The options are like 250, 261, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula that v = π * d * (rpm) / 60. So for driver, v = (π *8) * 500 / 60 = (8000 π) / 60 ≈ 418.879 inches per minute.

Then the driven pulley's v is the same. So for the driven, v = (π *15) * rpm2 /60 = same 418.879.

So rpm2 = (418.879 *60) / (15 π) = (25132.74) / (47.1239) ≈ 25132.74 /47.1239 ≈ 535.41. Wait, that can't be because 15-inch driven at 535 rpm would have a linear speed of 15 *535 * π /60 ≈ (7990 *3.1416)/60 ≈ 7990*0.05236 ≈ 418.87, which matches the driver's 500 rpm.

Wait, but that gives driven speed as 535 rpm, which is not among the options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should compute it in a different way.

Another approach: the linear speed of the driver is v = π * (d1) * (rpm1) /60.

So v = π *8 *500 /60 = (8000 π)/60 = 133.333 π inches per minute.

Then, the driven pulley's speed is same: v = π *15 * rpm2 /60.

Set equal: 133.333 π = (15 rpm2 * π ) /60.

Simplify: 133.333 = (15 rpm2)/60.

Multiply both sides by 60: 133.333 *60 =15 rpm2.

133.333 *60 = 8000; so 8000 =15 rpm2 → rpm2 = 8000/15 ≈533.333 rpm.

Wait, but again, none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for belt speed, which is v = π * d * (rpm) /60. But no, that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be v = (d * rpm) * (π/30), because 60 is 2π per minute, but I think I'm getting stuck.

Wait, maybe I can compute it another way.

The driver's pulley's rotational speed is 500 rpm. The linear speed is v = 8 * 500 * π / 60 = (8 *500 *3.1416)/60 ≈ (4000 *3.1416)/60 → (12566.4)/60 ≈ 209.44 inches per minute.

Wait, 209.44 inches per minute is the linear speed. So the driven pulley's circumference is 15 inches.

So the driven pulley's rotational speed is (209.44) / (15 * π) ) → but wait, 15 inches is the circumference. So, the driven pulley's rotational speed is (v) / (15 * π/ 30) ), perhaps.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe the problem is intended to use the formula where the linear speed is (d * rpm) /60, and the driven pulley's rpm is (d * rpm) / (d2 * π) )? No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps an alternative formula: the speed ratio is the ratio of the diameters. So with no slip, the driver's speed is 500 rpm, the driven's is (d1/d2) *500 = (8/15)*500 ≈266.666 rpm.

Ah, so perhaps the correct way is that the ratio of the diameters is the ratio of the speeds. So for no slip, 500 rpm is the driver's speed, and the driven's speed is (8/15)*500 ≈266.666 rpm.

But the options don't have this. Wait, the options are A:282, B:261.4, C:250, D:240, E:225, F:210, G:200.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try a different approach: using the linear speed formula v = (d * rpm) / 60.

So, driver speed: v = (8 *500)/60 = (4000)/60 ≈66.666 inches per minute.

The driven pulley's v =66.666 = (15 * rpm2)/60 → 66.666 = rpm2 *15/60 → 66.666 = rpm2 *0.25 → rpm2 =66.666 /0.25= 266.664 rpm.

Wait, but 266.664 is not an option. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the driver's speed as the 500 rpm, but the driven's speed is 266.666 rpm, but the options include 261.4, which is close to 266.666 (but not exact). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value. Let me compute the linear speed of the driver: 8 inches *500 rpm=4000 inches per minute.

Then, the driven pulley's linear speed is 4000 inches per minute. So, since the circumference is 15 inches, the number of rotations per minute is 4000 /15 = 266.666... rpm.

So the driven pulley's speed is 266.666 rpm.

But looking at the options, the closest is B:261.4. Hmm, but why?

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the belt speed differently. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is v = (π * d) * (rpm) / 60.

So for driver: v = (8 * π *500)/60 = (8 *500 *3.1416)/60 → (4000 *3.1416)/60 → (12566.4)/60 ≈ 209.44 inches per minute.

Then, driven pulley's rpm: 209.44 / (15 * π ) → 209.44 /47.1239 ≈4.444 rpm. Wait, that's not possible because the driver is rotating at 500 rpm. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the problem is that the driver's speed is 500 rpm, and the driven's speed is 266.666 rpm.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps the problem intended to use a different formula.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the driver's speed is:

v = (π * d1) * (rpm1) / 60.

Then, for the driven, same v, so:

v = (π * d2) * (rpm2) / 60.

So, (π *d1 * rpm1 ) /60 = (π *d2 * rpm2 ) /60.

Cancel π and 60:

d1 * rpm1 = d2 * rpm2.

So, rpm2 = (d1 /d2 ) * rpm1.

So, rpm2 = (8/15)*500 = 266.666... rpm.

So, the driven's speed is 266.666 rpm.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula where the belt's speed is v = (d * rpm) / 60, and the driven pulley's rpm is (v * 60)/(d2 * π).

Wait, let's compute this way.

v = (8 *500)/60 = 4000/60 ≈66.666 inches per minute.

Then, rpm driven = (66.666 *60)/(15 * π ) → (4000)/(47.1239) ≈84.823 rpm.

Wait, but again, this is not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me look for the correct formula.

Ah! I think I was correct earlier. The formula for the linear speed is v = (d * rpm) /60.

So, driver is 8-inch, 500 rpm: v =8*500/60= 4000/60≈66.666 in/min.

Then, driven pulley's rpm: 66.666 *60/(15 * π ) ≈66.666 *60/(47.1239) ≈66.666 *1.273≈84.823 rpm.

But this isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using the formula for the driver's speed, but using the total loss.

Wait, the problem says 'determine the speed of the driver pulley for a condition of no slip between the pulley and the belt and then for a total loss (slip and creep) of 2%.' So, first, no slip, which gives 500 rpm for the driver, 266.666 for the driven. Then, for total loss of 2%, perhaps the driven's speed is (266.666) * (1 - 0.02) =261.333 rpm. But none of the options are close except option B: 261.4. Oh, wait, 261.333 is approximately 261.333, which is 261.333, which rounds to 261.33.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute it as the driver's speed is 500, and the driven is 266.666, but the total loss is such that the driven's speed is (1 - 2/100) *266.666 = 0.98 *266.666 ≈261.333 rpm.

So the options have B) 261.4, which is 261.4, very close to 261.333.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B)261.4.

But why? Because the problem is asking for the driver's speed when no slip, which is 500, and when for a total loss of 2%, the driven's speed is 261.4.

Wait, but the options don't have 500. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says, "Determine the speed of the driver pulley for a condition of no slip between the pulley and the belt and then for a total loss (slip and creep) of 2%."

So, perhaps the first part is about the driver's speed, which is 500 rpm, and the driven's speed is 266.666 rpm. The second part is about the driven's speed with a total loss of 2%, which is 266.666 *0.98=261.333, which is 261.333. So the options have 261.4, which is close.

Hence, the correct answer is B)261.4.

Wait, but I'm not sure why the first part is about the driver's speed. Because the driver is the one that's driving the driven, so the driver's speed is 500 rpm, and the driven's speed is 266.666 rpm.

Therefore, the answer is B)261.4, but I'm not sure why they're asking for the driver's speed in the first place. Maybe I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the driver's speed as (d1 * rpm1) /60.

So, driver's speed = (8 *500)/60 =4000/60=66.666 in/min.

Then, the driven's speed is same, so:

driven's speed = (15 * rpm2 ) /60.

Set equal: 66.666 = (15 * rpm2 )/60 → 66.666 *60 =15 rpm2 →4000 =15 rpm2 → rpm2 =4000/15≈266.666.

So, driven's speed is 266.666 rpm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is using a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is v = π * d * rpm /60.

So, driver: v= π*8*500/60= (8*500*3.1416)/60= (4000 *3.1416)/60≈12566.4/60≈209.44 inches per minute.

Then, driven's rpm: v=π*15* rpm2/60 →209.44= (15 rpm2 *3.1416)/60 →209.44 = (47.1239 rpm2)/60 → 209.44 *60=47.1239 rpm2 →12566.4=47.1239 rpm2 → rpm2=12566.4/47.1239≈266.666.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to use the formula v = (d * rpm) * (π/30).

So, driver's speed: v = (8 *500) * π/30 =4000 * π /30 ≈4000 *1.0472 ≈4188.8 inches per minute.

Then, driven's rpm: v = (15 * rpm2) * π/30 →4188.8 = (15 rpm2) * π/30 →4188.8 = (15 rpm2 *3.1416)/30 →4188.8 = (47.1239 rpm2)/30 →4188.8 *30=47.1239 rpm2 →125664=47.1239 rpm2 → rpm2=125664/47.1239≈266.666.

Again, same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using the formula for belt speed, which is v = π * d1 * rpm1 /60 = same as before.

So, v= π *8 *500 /60 = (4000 *3.1416)/60≈12566.4/60≈209.44 inches/min.

Then, v= π *15 * rpm2 /60 →209.44= (47.1239 rpm2 )/60 →209.44 *60=47.1239 rpm2 →12566.4=47.1239 rpm2 → rpm2=12566.4/47.1239≈266.666.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is intended to have a different formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the formula for the linear speed as v = (d * rpm) /60, and the driven pulley's rpm is v / (d2 * π) ).

So, v= (8 *500)/60=4000/60≈66.666 in/min.

Then, driven's rpm=66.666 / (15 * π ) →66.666/(47.1239)≈1.406 rpm.

But that's not in the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should just proceed with the options.

So, the correct answer is B)261.4, perhaps because the problem intended to use the formula for the driver's speed as 500 rpm, and the driven's speed as 266.666, but for the total loss of 2%, the driven's speed is 266.666 *0.98=261.333, which is approximately 261.4.

So, the answer is B)261.4.
</think>

The problem involves a pulley system with the driver pulley rotating at 500 rpm and the driven pulley rotating at a lower speed. To account for a total loss of 2%, the driven pulley's speed is adjusted downward by 2%. The correct answer is **B) 261.4 rpm**, as it reflects the adjusted speed after considering the 2% loss.

ANSWER: B
