Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a proton's de Broglie wavelength, and I need to figure out the potential it must fall through. Hmm. Let's see. I remember that the de Broglie wavelength is related to the momentum of a particle. Oh right, the formula is lambda = h/(p), where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum.

Wait, but the proton is initially at rest. So if it's at rest, its velocity is zero, but when it falls through a potential, it gains kinetic energy. Oh right, the kinetic energy (KE) is equal to the charge of the proton times the potential V, because the proton will have charge +e, and the work done by the electric field is eV. So KE = eV.

And since it's a proton, its mass is m_p, which I think is about 1.67e-27 kg. Oh wait, but sometimes I see m_p as 938 MeV/c², but in terms of mass, 1e-27 kg is more manageable here.

So KE is (1/2)mv², but wait, but the proton is moving, so its momentum p is mv. So KE can also be written in terms of p: since p = mv, v = p/(m). So KE = (1/2) m (p²)/(m²) ) = p²/(2m). So KE = p²/(2m). 

But wait, the de Broglie wavelength lambda is h/p, which implies p = h/(lambda). So substituting p into the KE equation: KE = (h²) / (2 m lambda²). 

So KE = (h²)/(2 m lambda²). 

But wait, I think another approach is better here. Because the proton's kinetic energy comes from the potential V it's fallen through. So KE = eV. So equating the two expressions for KE:

eV = (h²)/(2 m_p lambda²)

So solving for V: V = (h²) / (2 m_p e lambda² )

Wait, yeah. Because e is the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 Coulombs. So I can plug in the numbers.

But wait, let me write down all the known values:

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s
m_p = mass of proton = 1.67e-27 kg
e = 1.6e-19 C
lambda = 1e-10 m.

So plugging into the equation:

V = (h²) / (2 m_p e lambda² )

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute h squared: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 (since (6.626)^2 is about 43.9, and 1e-34 squared is 1e-68, making 4.39e-67).

Denominator: 2 * m_p * e * lambda^2.

Calculate lambda squared: (1e-10)^2 = 1e-20.

So denominator: 2 * 1.67e-27 kg * 1.6e-19 C * 1e-20 m^2.

Wait, let me compute that:

Multiply 2 * 1.67e-27 * 1.6e-19 = 2 * (1.67 * 1.6) * 1e-27-19 = 2 * 2.672 * 1e-46.

Hmm, 1.67 * 1.6 is about 2.672. Multiply by 2: 5.344.

So 5.344e-46.

Then multiply by 1e-20 (from lambda squared): 5.344e-46 * 1e-20 = 5.344e-66.

So denominator is 5.344e-66 kg·C·m².

So V = (4.39e-67) / (5.344e-66) = approx (4.39 /5.344 )e-67+66 → 4.39/5.344 is about 0.819.

So V ≈ 0.819e-1 → 0.0819 volts.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: 0.082 V. So the correct answer should be J.

To determine the potential \( V \) through which a proton must fall to achieve a de Broglie wavelength of \( \lambda = 1.0 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \), we start by equating the proton's kinetic energy (\( KE \)) to the work done by the electric field (\( eV \)), where \( e \) is the elementary charge. The relationship between the de Broglie wavelength and momentum is given by \( \lambda = \frac{h}{p} \), so \( p = \frac{h}{\lambda} \). Substituting \( p \) into the kinetic energy formula (\( KE = \frac{p^2}{2m} \)), we get:

\[
KE = \frac{h^2}{2m\lambda^2}.
\]

Since \( KE = eV \), we equate the two expressions:

\[
eV = \frac{h^2}{2m\lambda^2}.
\]

Solving for \( V \):

\[
V = \frac{h^2}{2m e \lambda^2}.
\]

Using the constants:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \),
- \( m_p = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \mathrm{kg} \),
- \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \),
- \( \lambda = 1.0 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \),

we calculate:

1. \( h^2 = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 = 4.39 \times 10^{-67} \, \mathrm{J^2 \cdot s^2} \),
2. \( 2m_p e \lambda^2 = 2 \cdot (1.67 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (1.6 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (1.0 \times 10^{-10})^2 \),
   - \( 2 \cdot 1.67 \cdot 1.6 = 5.344 \),
   - \( 1.0 \times 10^{-10} \)^2 = \( 1.0 \times 10^{-20} \),
   - \( 2m_p e \lambda^2 = 5.344 \times 10^{-66} \, \mathrm{kg \cdot C \cdot m^2} \).

Finally, substituting into \( V \):

\[
V = \frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{5.344 \times 10^{-66}} = 0.819 \, \mathrm{V}.
\]

The closest option to this calculated value is **J: 0.082 V**.
