Okay, so I've got this question about cross-price elasticity of demand. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question is asking: When the cross-price elasticity of demand is negative, the goods in question are necessarily... and then there are several options. I need to choose the correct one from A to J.

Wait, cross-price elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good. Oh right, it's calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in the price of another good.

So, if the cross-price elasticity is negative, that means when the price of one good increases, the quantity demanded of another good decreases. Or, when the price of another good decreases, the quantity demanded of the first increases. So that's the opposite of substitutes, which are things that are used together. Substitutes have positive cross-price elasticity because if one goes up, the other goes up too.

Wait, but I might be getting this backwards. Let me think again. Cross-price elasticity of demand (E) is computed as (dQ1/dP2) * (P2/Q1). So if E is positive, it means that a change in P2 leads to a change in Q1 in the same direction. So if P2 increases and Q1 increases, they are substitutes. If P2 increases and Q1 decreases, then E is negative; they are complements.

So, a negative cross-price elasticity implies that when the price of one good increases, the quantity demanded of the other good decreases. That's characteristic of complementary goods. Because if I have two goods, like coffee and tea, if the price of coffee increases, I might buy less tea, because I prefer tea to coffee. So coffee and tea are complements.

Wait, but wait. Wait, let me make sure. For substitutes, the cross-price elasticity is positive. So if E is positive, substitutes. If E is negative, they are complements. So the answer should be about the relationship between the goods, not necessarily their own price elasticity.

Looking back at the options. The options are A through J. The options include "complements" and "substitutes." So when cross elasticity is negative, the goods are necessarily complements. Because if they are substitutes, their cross elasticity would be positive.

Wait, but let me read the question again. It says, "necessarily" which of the options. So it's asking what must be true. So if cross price elasticity is negative, the goods are necessarily complements. Because that's the definition.

Wait, but wait another thing. Are there exceptions? Like, maybe if the two goods are perfect substitutes, then the cross elasticity would be infinite or something. But the options don't include that. The closest is "complements" and "substitutes."

So the correct answer should be D: substitutes? No, wait, no. Because substitute goods have positive cross elasticity, so if it's negative, they can't be substitutes. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the options are A: normal, B: inelastic, C: non-durable, D: substitutes, E: elastic, F: durable, G: independent, H: inferior, I: luxuries, J: complements.

Wait, the options are not about elasticity types (elasticity is more about the degree of responsiveness) but about the categorization of the goods. So the question is about the nature of the relationship between the goods, not their price responsiveness.

So when cross elasticity is negative, the goods are complements. So D: substitutes is not correct because it's the opposite. So the correct answer is J: complements. But wait, the options don't have J as the answer? Let me check.

Wait, in the question, the options are:

Options:

A: normal

B: inelastic

C: non-durable

D: substitutes

E: elastic

F: durable

G: independent

H: inferior

I: luxuries

J: complements

So yes, J is an option. So the correct answer would be J.

Wait, but the question says "necessarily" which of the options. So if cross elasticity is negative, the goods are necessarily complements, so the answer is J. So I should choose option J.

Wait, but let me make sure. Are there any other possibilities? What about substitutes and complements. Substitute goods are things that are used together, and their cross elasticity is positive. If cross elasticity is negative, it's complementary, so they're used together but in opposite directions. Like coffee and tea. So yes, complements.

So the answer is J: complements.

The cross-price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to a change in the price of another good. When cross-price elasticity is negative, it indicates that the goods are complements. This is because an increase in the price of one good leads to a decrease in the demand for the other good, indicating an inverse relationship. 

Analyzing the options:

- **D: substitutes** is incorrect because substitutes have positive cross-price elasticity.
- **J: complements** is correct because a negative cross-price elasticity indicates complementary goods.
- The other options (normal, inelastic, non-durable, independent, inferior, luxuries) do not describe the relationship between the goods based on their cross-price elasticity.

Thus, the correct answer is **J: complements**.

**Answer: J**
