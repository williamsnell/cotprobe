Okay, so I've got this question about capillary rise and bubble pressure. Hmm, I remember that capillary rise depends on surface tension and density, but I need to think through the specifics.

The question states: The capillary rise for liquid A is 1.0 cm at 25°C. Part a is asking what the rise would be for liquid B if liquid A has half the surface tension and twice the density of B. Part b is about the maximum bubble pressure being how many times greater for B compared to A with the same tube.

Let me start with part a. Capillary rise (h) is given by the formula h = 2γ cosθ / (rρ), where γ is surface tension, θ is contact angle, r is radius, and ρ is density. Wait, actually, the exact formula might be a bit different. Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh right, the formula for capillary rise is h = (2γ cosθ)/(rρ). Since the question doesn't mention contact angle or radius, I think it's assuming that the radius and density are the same for both liquids, or maybe that the radius is the same? Wait, the question says "using the same capillary" for both liquids. So the radius r is the same for both A and B. So h is proportional to γ divided by ρ. Because the other factors (cosθ and r) are same.

So, for part a, liquid A has half the surface tension of B. So γ_A = 0.5 γ_B. And liquid A has twice the density of B. So ρ_A = 2 ρ_B. 

So substituting into h, which is proportional to γ/ρ. So h_A / h_B = (γ_A / ρ_A) / (γ_B / ρ_B) = (0.5 γ_B) / (2 ρ_B) ) * (ρ_B / γ_B) ) → the γ_B and ρ_B terms cancel, giving 0.5/(2) = 0.25. So h_B = h_A / 0.25 = 4 h_A. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Let me think again. If h is proportional to γ/ρ, then h_A = (γ_A)/(ρ_A) * constant. So h_B = (γ_B)/(ρ_B) * same constant. So h_B/h_A = (γ_B/ρ_B) / (γ_A/ρ_A) ) = (γ_B/γ_A) * (ρ_A/ρ_B). 

Since γ_A = 0.5 γ_B → γ_B = 2 γ_A. And ρ_A = 2 ρ_B → ρ_A = 2 ρ_B. So substituting, (2 γ_A) / ( (2 ρ_B) ) ) * (2 ρ_B / ρ_B) ) → (2 γ_A)/(2 ρ_B) ) * 2 → (γ_A / ρ_B) ) * 2. So h_B = 2 h_A. Oh, that's the correct calculation. So h_B is twice h_A, meaning 2 times. So part a's answer is h_B = 2 h_A. So the options for part a are either A, C, etc.

Now part b: the maximum bubble pressure. Wait, bubble pressure is the pressure required to make a bubble form. For that, I think the pressure is related to the Laplace pressure, which is similar to the capillary rise but for gas. The Laplace pressure is (2γ)/r. But wait, in this case, since the tube is the same, the radius r is the same for both liquids. But wait, what determines the pressure? For liquid A, P_A = 2 γ_A / r. For liquid B, P_B = 2 γ_B / r. 

Alternatively, wait, the capillary rise formula for gas is P = (ρ V g) / (2 A), but maybe I'm confusing. Alternatively, the bubble pressure (which I think is the pressure inside the bubble) is the Laplace pressure: P = 2γ / r. Since the capillary tube has the same radius, r is same for both. So P_B / P_A = γ_B / γ_A. 

In part a, we found γ_A = 0.5 γ_B, so γ_B = 2 γ_A. So P_B = 2 γ_B / r = 2*(2 γ_A)/r. So P_B = (4 γ_A)/r. P_A = 2 γ_A / r. So P_B = 2 P_A. So liquid B's bubble pressure is twice that of A. So part b's answer is that P_B is twice P_A.

Now looking at the options. For part a, the answer is h_B=2h_A. Looking at the options, option A says h_B=2h_A, and the pressure is half as much. But wait, earlier I found that the pressure for B is twice as much. So let's check the options.

Looking at the options: The options are about h and pressure. 

The options given are A to J. Let me read each.

Option A: h_B=2h_A, pressure half as much for B as A. So pressure B is 0.5 * pressure A.

Wait, wait, in part a, the question is: what is the rise using the same capillary for liquid B? So part a's answer is h_B=2 h_A. Then, part b's question is the maximum bubble pressure for B is how many times for A when same tube. So pressure B is 2 times pressure A.

So the options that have h_B=2h_A and pressure twice as much would be part a's answer and part b's. Let's look:

Looking for h_B=2h_A and pressure is twice as in some option.

Let me check each option:

Option A: h_B=2h_A, pressure is half as much for B as A → so pressure B is 0.5 * pressure A. But this is the opposite of our calculation. So A is wrong.

Option C: h_B=4h_A, pressure 4 times as much. So that's not the case.

Option D: h_B=h_A/4, which is 0.25 h_A. So no.

Option F: h_B=4h_A, pressure twice as much. So h_B is 4 times A, and pressure is 2 times A. So that would be correct for part a (h) and part b (pressure). Because h_B is 4h_A (so correct for part a's h), and pressure is 2 times, correct for part b.

Wait, the question asks for part a and part b. So the options:

For part a, h_B = 2h_A. For part b, pressure is twice as much for B as A.

Looking for the option where h is 2h_A and pressure is double. So which option has that?

Looking at the options again:

Option F: h_B=4h_A, pressure is twice as much for B as A → No, because in part a, h is 2h_A, not 4.

Wait, none of the options seem to have h_B=2h_A and pressure=2 times. Let me check again. What's the correct answer for part a and part b.

Wait, the question is phrased: "a) What will be the rise using the same capillary for liquid B..." So part a is about h, and part b is about pressure. So the options must have both.

So the correct answer for part a is h_B=2h_A, and for part b, pressure is twice that of A. So which options match this?

Looking at the options, option F: h_B=4h_A, pressure twice as. No, because 4h is more.

Option A: h=2h_A, pressure half for B. No, pressure for B is twice.

Option C: h_B=4h_A, pressure four times. No.

Option G: h_B=3h_A, pressure three times. No.

Option I: h_B=3h_A, pressure half. No.

Option E: h_B=0.5h_A, same pressure. No.

Option B: h_B=2h_A, pressure same. No, because our pressure is double.

Option D: h_B= h_A/4, pressure thrice. No.

Option F: h_B=4h_A, pressure twice. No.

Option H: h_B=h_A/2, pressure twice. No.

Wait, none of the options have both h=2h_A and pressure=2 times.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, part a: h_B = 2 h_A, as I calculated. Part b: pressure for B is twice that of A.

Looking at the options, which option has h=2h_A and pressure=2 times? Let me see.

Looking at the options:

Option A: h=2h_A, pressure half. No.

Option F: h=4h_A, pressure twice. No.

Option C: h=4h_A, pressure four times.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the part b calculation.

Wait, part b is about the maximum bubble pressure. I thought it was P = 2γ/r. So if γ_B is twice γ_A, then P_B = 2 * (2 γ_A) / r = 4 γ_A / r. P_A is 2 γ_A / r. So P_B is 2 times P_A. So yes, part b's answer is pressure B is twice that of A.

So which option has h_B=2h_A and pressure B is twice P_A?

Looking through options:

None of the options have both. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option F: h_B=4h_A, pressure is twice as much for B as A. So h is 4h_A, which is more than part a's 2h_A. So perhaps it's not the correct option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about part a.

Capillary rise h = (2 γ cosθ) / (r ρ). Assuming cosθ is same, since it's the same liquid and same medium, so it's (2 γ) / (r ρ).

So h_a / h_b = (γ_a / γ_b) * (ρ_b / ρ_a).

Given γ_a = 0.5 γ_b → γ_b =2 γ_a.

And ρ_a = 2 ρ_b → ρ_b = ρ_a / 2.

So substituting, (γ_a)/(γ_b) = 1/2. (ρ_b/ρ_a) = (1/2)/1 = 1/2.

So h_b = (1/2) * (1/2) h_a = 1/4 h_a. Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Did I make a mistake in part a's calculation?

Wait, I think I've made a mistake. Let me recalculate part a.

Wait, h ∝ γ / ρ.

h_a = (γ_a) / (ρ_a) * K.

h_b = (γ_b) / (ρ_b) * K.

So h_b/h_a = (γ_b/ρ_b) / (γ_a/ρ_a) ) = (γ_b/γ_a) * (ρ_a/ρ_b).

Given γ_a = (1/2) γ_b → γ_b = 2γ_a.

And ρ_a = 2 ρ_b → ρ_a/ρ_b = 2.

So,

h_b/h_a = (2γ_a) / ( γ_a ) * (2) → 2 * 2 = 4. So h_b =4 h_a. So that's part a.

Ah, I see, I made a mistake earlier. So h_b is four times h_a. So part a says h_B=4h_A.

Wait, so earlier calculation was correct. So part a's answer is h_B=4h_A, and part b's answer is pressure B is twice that of A.

Looking at the options, option C says h_B=4h_A, pressure four times. No, pressure is twice.

Wait, looking again, option F: h_B=4h_A, pressure twice. No, because part b is pressure twice.

Wait, looking at all the options:

Option F: h_B=4h_A, pressure is twice as much for B as A → No, because pressure is twice.

Wait, perhaps none of the options have both. No, I must have made a mistake. Let me check.

Looking at the options again:

Option F: h_B=4h_A, pressure is twice as much for B as A → No, because pressure B is 2 times A.

Wait, perhaps I confused the pressure formula. Another possibility: the maximum bubble pressure for a liquid is given by the Laplace pressure, which is 2γ/(r). So for same r, P_B = 2 γ_B / r = 2*(2γ_A) / r = 4 γ_A / r. P_A is 2 γ_A / r.

So P_B = 2 * P_A → so for part b, pressure is twice as much.

So the correct answer for part a is h=4h_A, and part b's pressure is twice that of A.

Looking for an option that matches this. None of the options seems to have this.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option F: h_B=4h_A, pressure is twice as much for B as A → so pressure is 2x, which is correct.

But wait, looking back, the question says: "b) How many times will the maximum bubble pressure for liquid B be greater than liquid A using the same tube for both liquids."

So the answer for part b is that pressure for B is twice as that of A. So which option has h_B=4h_A and pressure twice as much.

Looking at the options, that would be option F.

Wait, no. Option F says h_B=4h_A, and pressure is twice as much. So that's correct.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option F: h_B=4h_A, pressure is twice as much for B as A → So in part b, the pressure is twice as much as A.

Wait, but the options are for the question, which includes both a and b.

So the correct option must have h_B=4h_A and pressure B is twice as A.

Looking, that would be option F.

Wait, but let me check each option.

Looking:

Option F: h_B=4h_A, pressure is twice as much for B as A → So for part a, h is 4h_A, which is correct. For part b, pressure is 2 times, which is correct.

So the correct answer is option F.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options:

Looking again:

Option A: h=2h_A, pressure is half.

Option B: h=2h_A, pressure same.

Option C: h=4h_A, pressure four times.

Option D: h= h_A/4, pressure thrice.

Option F: h=4h_A, pressure twice.

Now, for part a, h_B=4h_A. So options C and F have that.

Now, for part b, pressure is twice that of A. So which option has pressure twice?

Looking for the part b's answer is twice. So the option where h_B=4h_A and pressure is twice.

Looking at the options, option F has h_B=4h_A and pressure twice, which is correct.

Wait, but wait, but the options for part b are actually part b's answer as a whole. So the question asks for both parts a and b.

So the correct option is F.

Wait, but I thought option F says h_B=4h_A and pressure is twice as much for B, which is correct.

So the answer is option F. But let me check the options again.

Wait, the question says option F is h_B=4h_A, pressure is twice as much. So that's correct for part a and b.

So the correct option is F.

To solve the problem, we analyze the capillary rise and bubble pressure for liquids A and B under the given conditions.

---

### Part (a): Capillary Rise for Liquid B
The capillary rise formula is:

\[
h = \frac{2\gamma}{r\rho}
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the surface tension,
- \( \rho \) is the density,
- \( r \) is the radius of the tube.

Given:
- \( \gamma_A = 0.5\gamma_B \),
- \( \rho_A = 2\rho_B \).

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\frac{h_B}{h_A} = \frac{\gamma_B / \rho_B}{\gamma_A / \rho_A} = \frac{\gamma_B / \rho_B}{(0.5\gamma_B) / (2\rho_B)} = \frac{\gamma_B}{\rho_B} \cdot \frac{2\rho_B}{0.5\gamma_B} = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4.
\]

Thus, \( h_B = 4h_A \).

---

### Part (b): Maximum Bubble Pressure for Liquid B
The maximum bubble pressure is given by the Laplace pressure:

\[
P = \frac{2\gamma}{r}.
\]

For liquids A and B, with the same tube radius \( r \), we have:

\[
\frac{P_B}{P_A} = \frac{\gamma_B}{\gamma_A} = \frac{\gamma_B}{0.5\gamma_B} = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2.
\]

Thus, \( P_B = 2P_A \).

---

### Final Answer
For part (a), the capillary rise for liquid B is \( h_B = 4h_A \).

For part (b), the maximum bubble pressure for liquid B is twice that of liquid A.

The correct option is **F**, which states:

\[
h_B = 4h_A, \quad \text{pressure} = \text{twice as much for B as A}.
\]
