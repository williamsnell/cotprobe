Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about the distance between Miriam’s house and Debbie’s house, which is 444.44 meters. I need to figure out which statement about the digits in this number is true.

First, I'll break down the number 444.44 into its place values. The number is in the hundreds, tens, ones, tenths, and hundredths places. Let me write it out:

- The first '4' (from the left) is in the hundreds place. So, it's worth 4 * 100 = 400 meters.
- The second '4' is in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40 meters.
- The third '4' is in the ones place. That's 4 * 1 = 4 meters.
- The decimal part, the '4' after the decimal, is in the tenths place: 4 * 0.1 = 0.4 meters.
- The next digit after that is '4' in the hundredths place: 4 * 0.01 = 0.04 meters.

Now, let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: The value of the 4 in the tens place is 10 times greater than the 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, the tens place is 40 meters and the hundreds is 400. 40 is 10 times less than 400, not greater. So A is false.

Option B: The 4 in tenths equals the 4 in hundreds. Tenths is 0.4, hundreds is 400. Definitely not equal. B is wrong.

Option C: The 4 in tenths is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens. Tenths is 0.4, tens is 40. 0.4 is 1/10 of 4, but wait, 0.4 is 4 tenths, which is 0.4, and 40 is 4*10. So 0.4 is one-tenth of 4, but not the 4 in the tens place. Hmm, something's off. Wait, the 4 in the tens place is 40, which is 10 times the value of 4 tenths (0.4)? No, because 0.4 is 4 tenths, which is 0.4, and 4 in the tens is 40. So 40 is 10 times 4 tenths (since 4 tenths is 0.4, 0.4 *10 = 4.0, which is 4 in the tens place). So the 4 in tenths is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens. So C says the 4 in tenths is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens. So that's correct. Because 0.4 is one-tenth of 4.0. So C is correct.

Wait, but I should check the other options as well.

Option D: The 4 in the hundredths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones. The hundredths is 0.04, and the ones is 4. 0.04 is 1/10 of 0.4, not of 4. So 0.04 is 0.4 tenths, which is 4 tenths. So 0.04 is 0.4 tenths, which is 0.4, and the 4 in the ones is 4. So 0.4 is 1/10 of 4. So the 4 in the hundredths is 1/10 of 0.4, not 4. So D is incorrect.

Option E: The 4 in the hundredths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens. The 4 in the hundredths is 0.04, and the tens is 40. 0.04 is 1/10 of 0.4, but again, 0.04 is 0.4 tenths. So it's (0.4 tenths) which is (4 tenths) tenths? Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. The 4 in the tens is 40, the 4 in the hundredths is 0.04. So 0.04 is 1/10 of 0.4, but 0.4 is not 40. So E is incorrect.

Option F: The value of the 4 in the hundreds place is 10 times greater than the 4 in the ones. The 4 in the hundreds is 400, the 4 in the ones is 4. 400 is 100 times 4, not 10 times. So F is wrong.

Option G: The 4 in the ones is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tenths. 4 in ones is 4, 4 in tenths is 0.4. 0.4 is 1/10 of 4. So G is correct because 0.4 is 1/10 of 4. So wait, G says the 4 in the ones is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tenths. That's correct. So both C and G are correct? But wait, let me see the options again.

Wait, looking back: option C says the 4 in the tenths is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens. We determined that's true because 0.4 is 1/10 of 4.0. So option C is correct.

Option G says the 4 in the ones is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tenths. So 4 is 10 times the tenths place (since 0.4 is 4 tenths, and 4 is 4). So yes, 4 is 10 times tenths. So G is correct.

Wait, but the question says "which statement is true" and the options are A to J, so perhaps more than one can be correct? Oh wait, no, the options are A to J, so each is a separate statement, and the correct answer is the one that is true.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Wait, looking at option G: The value of the 4 in the ones place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tenths place. So, 4 in ones is 4, 4 in tenths is 0.4. So 0.4 is 4 tenths. So the 4 in ones is 10 times greater than the 4 in tenths. So option G is correct.

Wait, but I thought C was correct. So which is correct?

Wait, let me re-examine each option.

Option C: 4 in tenths (0.4) is 1/10 the value of 4 in tens (40). 0.4 is 4 tenths, which is 4 * 0.1. So 0.4 is 4 tenths, which is 4 * 10^-1. So 0.4 is (4) * (10^-1). So 0.4 is 1/10 of 4. So 0.4 = (4)* (1/10). So, 0.4 is 1/10 of 4. So 4 tenths is 1/10 of the 4 in tens. So, 4 in tenths is (1/10) * 4 in tens. So option C says the 4 in tenths is 1/10 the value of the 4 in tens. So that's correct.

Option G: 4 in ones is 4, 4 in tenths is 0.4. So 4 is 10 times greater than 0.4. Because 4 = 10 * 0.4. So yes, G is correct.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is true. So both C and G are correct? Or perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, but let's look again. The distance is 444.44 meters. So, the structure is:

- Hundreds place: 4 (400)
- Tens place: 4 (40)
- Ones place: 4 (4)
- Tenths place: 4 (0.4)
- Hundredths place: 4 (0.04)

Looking at the options again:

Option C: The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place. Tenths is 0.4, tens is 40. 0.4 is 1/10 of 4.0, which is correct. So C is correct.

Option G: The 4 in the ones place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tenths place. 4 (ones) is 4, 4 (tenths) is 0.4. 4 is 10 times 0.4 (since 0.4 *10 =4). So G is correct.

Wait, but the options are A-F and G-H, but each is a separate statement. So, both C and G are correct? Or maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, but let me check each statement again.

Wait, the question says "which statement is true," so perhaps multiple options are correct. But looking back, no, the options are given as A to H, each being a statement. So perhaps only one is correct. But according to my analysis, both C and G are correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in evaluating them. Let me re-examine each statement.

Option C: The 4 in the tenths (0.4) is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens (40). So 0.4 is 1/10 of 40. So 0.4 = 40 * (1/10). So yes, correct.

Option G: The 4 in the ones place (4) is 10 times greater than the 4 in the tenths place (0.4). So 4 is 10 times 0.4 (because 0.4 *10=4). So yes, correct.

Wait, but how can two options be correct? Let me check if any of the options are the same or conflicting.

Wait, the options are all separate, so perhaps only one is correct. But according to my analysis, both C and G are correct. But looking back, I might have misread the options.

Wait, let me re-examine each option:

Option C: The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place. So 0.4 is 1/10 of 40. Correct.

Option G: The value of the 4 in the ones place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tenths place. 4 is 10 times 0.4. Correct.

Wait, but that would mean both C and G are correct. However, looking at the options, both C and G are present. But the question says "which statement is true," which might imply only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let's double-check option C.

Wait, the 4 in the ones place is 4 meters. The 4 in the tens is 40 meters. So 4 is 10 times less than 40. So 4 is 1/10 the value of 40. So option C is correct.

Option G: 4 in ones is 4, 4 in tenths is 0.4. 4 is 10 times 0.4, so yes.

Wait, but the options are given as separate, so perhaps both C and G are correct. But looking at the options, I think that's not the case. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question says "which statement is true," and the options are A to H, each a single statement. So perhaps more than one option is correct, but the way the question is worded, it's possible that only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, let me think again. Let's list all the options and their correctness.

Option A: tens (40) is 10 times greater than hundreds (400). No, tens is 40, hundreds is 400. 40 is 10 times less than 400. So A is wrong.

Option B: 4 in tenths (0.4) equals 4 in hundreds (400). 0.4 is not 400. B is wrong.

Option C: Tenths (0.4) is 1/10 of tens (40). 0.4 is 1/10 of 40. So yes, correct.

Option D: Hundredths (0.04) is 1/10 of ones (4). 0.04 is 4 tenths, which is 4 tenths, so 0.04 is 0.4 tenths. 0.4 tenths is 0.4, which is 1/10 of 4. So the hundredths place is 0.04, which is 4 tenths, not 4. So 0.04 is 1/10 of 0.4, which is 4 tenths, but not 4. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Hundredths (0.04) is 1/10 of tens (40). 0.04 is not 4, so 4 tenths is 0.4, which is 1/10 of 4. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Hundreds (400) is 10 times greater than ones (4). 400 is 100 times greater than 4. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Ones (4) is 1/10 of tenths (0.4). 4 is 10 times 0.4. So G is correct.

Option H: Tenths (0.4) is 10 times greater than hundredths (0.04). 0.4 is 10 times 0.04 (since 0.04 *10=0.4). So H is correct.

Wait, wait, that can't be. Wait, what's the correct analysis:

Wait, let me re-examine option H: The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place. Tenths is 0.4, hundredths is 0.04.

0.4 / 0.04 = 10. So yes, 0.4 is 10 times greater than 0.04. So H is correct.

Now, this suggests that options C, G, and H are correct. But the original question should have only one correct option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, but looking back at the options, perhaps the question is testing for which statement is true. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, G, or H.

Wait, but the options are presented as separate choices, so I think the correct answer is option C and G, but perhaps the question allows for multiple correct answers. However, the options are labeled A to H, each being one statement, and the question is to choose which is true. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the problem statement. The question is: "Which statement about the values of the digits in the distance, in meters, between their houses is true?"

Looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the correct options.

Let me list all options again:

A: Tens (40) is 10 times greater than hundreds (400). 40 is 10 times less than 400. So A is incorrect.

B: Tenths (0.4) equals hundreds (400). 0.4 is not 400. B is incorrect.

C: Tenths (0.4) is 1/10 of tens (40). 0.4 is indeed 40 divided by 10, so 0.4 is 1/10 of 40. C is correct.

D: Hundredths (0.04) is 1/10 of ones (4). 0.04 is 0.4 tenths, which is 0.4, which is 1/10 of 4. So D says 0.04 is 1/10 of 4, which is not correct. Because 0.04 is 0.4 tenths, which is 0.4, which is 1/10 of 4. So D says 0.04 is 1/10 of 4, which is correct. Wait, that can't be. So D says 0.04 is 1/10 of 4, which is correct because 0.04 is 0.4 tenths, and 0.4 is 1/10 of 4. So D is correct.

Wait, no, because 0.04 is 0.4 tenths. So 0.04 = 0.4 * 0.1. So 0.04 is 0.4 tenths. So 0.04 is 4 tenths tenths? I'm getting confused. Alternatively, 0.04 is 0.4 tenths, which is 0.4, which is 1/10 of 4. So 0.04 equals (4 tenths)/10 = 0.4 /10=0.04. So D is correct.

Wait, but that would mean D is correct. But in that case, the correct options are C, D, and H.

Wait, but let me check each option again.

Option D: The 4 in the hundredths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones. So the 4 in ones is 4, the 4 in hundredths is 0.04. 0.04 is 1/10 of 0.4, but 0.4 is not 4. So 0.04 is 1/10 of 0.4, but 0.4 is not 4. So D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine each option.

Option C: 4 in tenths (0.4) is 1/10 of 4 in tens (40). Yes, because 40 is 10 times 4. So 0.4 is 1/10 of 40. So C is correct.

Option D: 4 in hundredths (0.04) is 1/10 of 4 in ones (4). 0.04 = (0.4)/10 = (4 tenths)/10 = 0.4/10 = 0.04. So 0.04 is 1/10 of 0.4, but 0.4 is not 4. So D is incorrect.

Option H: 4 in tenths (0.4) is 10 times greater than 4 in hundredths (0.04). Because 0.4 /0.04 = 10. So H is correct.

So now, the correct options are C, H.

But wait, earlier I thought H is correct, but the question says "which statement is true," so perhaps both C and H are correct. But looking back, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C and H, but the options are presented as A to H, each a separate statement. So the correct options would be C and H.

But let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Tens (40) is 10 times greater than hundreds (400) → 40 is 10 times less than 400. So A is incorrect.

B: Tenths (0.4) equals hundreds (400) → 0.4 is not 400. B incorrect.

C: Tenths (0.4) is 1/10 the value of tens (40) → 0.4 = 40 * (1/10) → 0.4 =4, which is correct. So C is correct.

D: Hundredths (0.04) is 1/10 of ones (4) → 0.04 is 1/10 of 0.4, but 0.4 is not 4. So D is incorrect.

E: Hundredths (0.04) is 1/10 of tens (40) → 0.04 is not 40. E incorrect.

F: Hundreds (400) is 10 times greater than ones (4) → 400 is 100 times greater than 4. F incorrect.

G: Ones (4) is 1/10 of tenths (0.4) → 4 is 10 times 0.4, which is correct. So G is correct.

H: Tenths (0.4) is 10 times greater than hundredths (0.04) → 0.4 is 10 times 0.04, which is correct. H is correct.

So the correct options are C, G, and H.

But the question says "which statement is true," implying that only one option is correct. However, according to my analysis, C, G, and H are correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem statement. The distance is 444.44 meters.

Let me think again: 444.44 meters.

Breaking it down:

- Hundreds: 4 * 100 = 400.
- Tens: 4 * 10 =40.
- Ones:4*1=4.
- Tenths:4 * 0.1=0.4.
- Hundredths:4*0.01=0.04.

So, with that, the 4 in the hundreds is 400, which is 100 times the 4 in the tens (40). So hundreds is 100 times the tens. But the question is about which statement is true.

Now, looking at the statements again:

Option C: The 4 in the tenths (0.4) is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens (40). So 0.4 is 1/10 of 40, which is correct. So C is correct.

Option G: The 4 in the ones (4) is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tenths (0.4). Wait, 4 is 10 times 0.4, not 0.4. Wait, 0.4 is 4 tenths, which is 0.4, which is 1/10 of 4. So the 4 in the ones is 10 times greater than the 4 in the tenths. So G is correct.

Option H: The 4 in the tenths (0.4) is 10 times greater than the 4 in the hundredths (0.04). 0.4 is 10 times 0.04, so H is correct.

Wait, but according to this, C, G, and H are correct. But looking back, the options are A to H, each a single statement.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C and H, but the problem statement may have some mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only testing for one correct option, and I made a mistake in evaluating one of them.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the place values again.

Wait, the 4 in the ones place is 4.

The 4 in the tenths place is 0.4.

The 4 in the hundredths place is 0.04.

So, the 4 in the ones is 4, the 4 in the tenths is 0.4.

So, 4 in ones is 10 times 0.4, so G is correct.

Similarly, 0.4 is 1/10 of 4.0, which is 4, so C is correct.

And 0.4 is 10 times greater than 0.04, so H is correct.

Thus, the correct answers are C, G, and H.

But the question says, "which statement is true," implying that only one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is C, as it's the only one that's directly comparing the place values.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects multiple correct options, but the way it's presented, I think C is correct.

Wait, considering that, perhaps the correct answer is option C and H, but the way the problem is presented, the options are A to H, each a single statement.

Looking back, perhaps the correct answer is option C and H.

But in the multiple-choice format, the options are likely to have only one correct answer, but according to my analysis, there are three correct options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C and H, but the question is expecting only one correct option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option G.

Option G: The value of the 4 in the ones place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the tenths place.

So, 4 (ones) is 4, 4 (tenths) is 0.4.

So, 4 is 10 times 0.4, so yes, G is correct.

So, the correct options are C, G, and H.

But in the multiple-choice format, perhaps the answer is C and H, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the problem again to see if I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the place values. Let's re-express 444.44 meters to understand the place values correctly.

The number is 444.44.

Breaking it down:

- Hundreds: 4 * 100 =400.
- Tens:4*10=40.
- Ones:4*1=4.
- Tenths:4*0.1=0.4.
- Hundredths:4*0.01=0.04.

So the place values are correct.

Now, looking at the statements:

Option C: The 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.

So, tenths is 0.4, tens is40.

0.4 is 1/10 of 40. So correct.

Option G: The 4 in the ones place is 10 times greater than the 4 in the tenths place.

So, 4 in ones is 4, 4 in tenths is 0.4.

4 is 10 times 0.4, so correct.

Option H: The 4 in the tenths place is 10 times greater than the 4 in the hundredths place.

So, tenths is 0.4, hundredths is 0.04.

0.4 is 10 times 0.04. So correct.

Thus, the correct options are C, G, and H.

But the problem statement says "which statement is true," and the options are A to H, each a separate statement. So, perhaps the question expects us to select multiple correct options, but in the way it's presented, I'm supposed to choose all that apply.

But given that, perhaps the correct answer is C and H, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But given that, I think the correct answer is option C and H, but I'm not entirely sure, perhaps I should proceed to select option C as the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is option C: The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 of the value of the 4 in the tens place.

**Explanation:**

In the number 444.44 meters, the digit 4 in the tens place is 40, and the digit 4 in the tenths place is 0.4. Since 0.4 is exactly one-tenth of 40, option C is correct.

ANSWER: C
