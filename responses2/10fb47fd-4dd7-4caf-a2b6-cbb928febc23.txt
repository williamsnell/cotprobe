Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Baier's views on moral rules. Hmm, I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about Baier's philosophy. I think Baier is a philosopher who discussed moral rules and their implications.

The question asks about what Baier argues about genuine moral rules. The options are A to J, each with a different idea. I remember that Baier's work often emphasizes how moral rules are constructed and their impact on society.

Looking at the options, option F says, "must be for the good of human beings." That sounds familiar. I think Baier supports the idea that moral rules are meant to serve the human good. He might have argued that moral rules are not just arbitrary but are designed to maximize overall human welfare.

Option B mentions "all sentient beings." Wait, Baier's argument might be more about human beings rather than all sentient beings. Because Baier's approach is about human morality, not necessarily the broader animal aspects. So maybe B isn't the right choice.

Option E says they're based solely on religious doctrines. No, that doesn't fit because Baier's focus isn't purely religious; he's talking about general moral principles.

Option D says they must align with societal norms. That's about how they're formed, but Baier's argument is more about the nature of those norms, not their origin.

Option J says they're only applicable to those who choose to follow them. That seems too restrictive, as Baier would probably include a broader range of people.

Option F still feels right. Baier's concept is that moral rules are designed with the purpose of the good for humans. So the answer should be F.

The correct answer is F: "must be for the good of human beings."

**Answer:** F
