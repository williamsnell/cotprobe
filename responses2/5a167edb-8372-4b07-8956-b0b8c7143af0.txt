Okay, so I have this vector problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again.

The question says: If x is a vector [2, 3i, 1-i] and y is another vector [-1+i, 2, 3-i], I need to find the inner product (y, y). The options are given from A to J, with numbers ranging from 10 to 22.

Hmm, I remember that the inner product of a vector with itself is the square of its magnitude, or the sum of the squares of its components. But wait, since the components here involve complex numbers, I need to be careful with the calculations. Oh right, for complex vectors, the inner product involves taking the conjugate of one of the components. 

Wait, no—actually, the inner product of two vectors is the sum over all indices of the product of the corresponding components, where one of them is conjugated. So for (y, y), it's the sum of y_i times the conjugate of y_i for each component i. So each term is y_i * conjugate(y_i), which is the modulus squared of y_i.

So I need to compute for each component of y, multiply it by its complex conjugate, and then add all those up.

Let me write down the components of y:

y1 = -1 + i
y2 = 2
y3 = 3 - i

Now, the conjugate of y1 is (-1 - i) because we change the sign of the imaginary part. The conjugate of y2 is 2 because it's real. The conjugate of y3 is (3 + i).

So for each component:

For y1: (-1 + i) * (-1 - i)
For y2: 2 * 2
For y3: (3 - i) * (3 + i)

Now, let's compute each of these.

Starting with y1:

(-1 + i)(-1 - i) = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-i) + i*(-1) + i*(-i)
= 1 + i - i - i²
Wait, i² is -1, so this becomes 1 + 0 - (-1) → 1 + 1 → 2.

Wait, wait, let me compute step by step.

(-1 + i)(-1 - i) = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-i) + (i)(-1) + (i)(-i)
= 1 + i - i - i²
The i and -i terms cancel: 1 - i².
Since i² is -1, this is 1 - (-1) = 2. So y1's contribution is 2.

Next, y2 is 2. The conjugate is 2, so 2 * 2 =4.

Now y3: (3 - i)(3 + i) = 3*3 + 3*i -i*3 -i*i
=9 + 3i -3i -i²
Again, 3i and -3i cancel, and i² is -1.
So 9 - (-1) = 10.

Adding all three contributions: 2 (from y1) + 4 (y2) +10 (y3) = 16.

Looking at the options, J is 16. So the answer should be J.

The inner product (y, y) is calculated by summing the products of each component with its complex conjugate. For y = [−1+i, 2, 3−i], the calculations are:

1. y₁ = −1 + i → y₁ * conjugate(y₁) = (−1 + i)(−1 − i) = 2
2. y₂ = 2 → y₂ * conjugate(y₂) = 2 * 2 = 4
3. y₃ = 3 − i → y₃ * conjugate(y₃) = (3 − i)(3 + i) = 10

Summing these gives 2 + 4 + 10 = 16. 

Answer: J
