Okay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out the answer to this blood group genetics problem. So, the question is about calculating the frequency of two alleles, L^m and L^n, in a population of college students. 

The problem statement says that the blood groups are determined by two codominant alleles: L^m and L^n. So, each person carries two copies of these alleles, but one is dominant over the other. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no. Wait, I think in this case, the two codominant alleles would be L^m and L^n. So, each person's genotype would be something like L^m L^n, L^m L^m, or L^n L^n. Because, wait, if it's codominant, both alleles are expressed.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the notation. Oh, right, L^m and L^n are the codominant alleles. So each person has two copies, and the phenotype depends on which allele they have. Wait, but in blood groups, the typical alleles are A and B, and the presence of the B allele (or another allele) determines the type. So in this case, perhaps the alleles are M and N, and their presence determines the blood group (M, MN, or N). 

Wait, perhaps it's a simplified version. The way the question is phrased: M, MN, and N blood groups are determined by two codominant alleles: L^m and L^n. So each person in the population has two copies of these alleles, and the phenotype depends on which allele they have. Oh, wait, but the way the question is written, the blood group numbers are M, MN, and N. So perhaps each person has two copies of these alleles, and the presence of M and N determines their group.

Wait, maybe I should think of each person as having two copies of a gene, which are M and N. So, the genotype would be M M, MN, or N N. Then, the phenotype is determined by whether they have M, N, or both. So, the blood group is determined by the presence of M or N.

But the question is about the frequency of the alleles L^m and L^n. Wait, no, wait. The problem provides the number of people with M, MN, and N blood groups. But the alleles are L^m and L^n. Oh wait, perhaps I'm mixing up things. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the M, MN, and N blood groups are determined by two codominantalleles: L^m and L^n. So each person has two copies of these alleles, and the phenotype is based on which allele they have. So, for example, if a person has L^m and L^n, they express both, which would result in a phenotype that's like MN, but wait, in reality, the presence of M and N would result in blood group MN. Hmm, perhaps the question is using L^m and L^n as the two alleles, and the presence of either determines the blood group.

Wait, but the question is about calculating the frequency of the alleles L^m and L^n. But the way the problem is presented, the blood groups are M, MN, N, which are determined by two codominant alleles, which are assumed to be L^m and L^n. So perhaps the individual's genotype is L^m and L^n, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, thinking again, maybe the M and N are the actual blood group alleles, but the question refers to the "two codominantalleles" as L^m and L^n. So perhaps each person has two copies of these alleles, and the combination determines the blood group. So, for example, if someone has L^m and L^m, they have blood group M. If they have L^n and L^n, they have blood group N. And if they have one of each, they have blood group MN. But that doesn't fit the problem statement, because M, MN, and N are the blood groups, not the alleles. So maybe the question is using L^m and L^n as the alleles, and the blood group is determined by which allele is present.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a standard blood group problem. Let me think of the problem as: two codominant alleles, L^m and L^n, determine the blood group. So each person has two copies of these alleles, but the way they express is that if they have at least one L^m, they have blood type M, if at least one L^n, they have blood type N, and if they have both, they have blood type MN. But wait, the problem says M, MN, N are the blood groups. So that would make sense: if an individual has at least one M allele, they have blood group M; same with N. So, for example, if someone has L^m and L^n, they have blood group MN. If someone has L^m and L^m, they have blood group M. If someone has L^n and L^n, they have blood group N. That way, the blood groups M, MN, N correspond to the presence of M, presence of N, or both.

But wait, in reality, blood groups are determined by M and N alleles, and the presence of M is M, presence of N is N, and presence of both is MN. So this is the same as what's described.

So, in this problem, the presence of L^m and L^n alleles determine the blood group. So each person has two copies of these alleles, but the blood group is determined by which of these alleles they have.

Wait, but the question is about the frequency of the L^m and L^n alleles. But wait, the way the problem is presented, the blood groups are M, MN, and N, determined by two codominant alleles L^m and L^n. So each person has two copies of these alleles. So, the presence of each allele would affect their blood group.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because in reality, each person has two alleles for each gene, but their blood group is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele. If the alleles are codominant, then their phenotype is a mixture of both.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the data. There are 800 students. Let's list the numbers:

Blood Group | Number of students
M         | 392
MN        | 336
N         | 72

Wait, 392 + 336 +72 = 800. Yes, that adds up correctly.

So, the blood groups M, MN, and N. Now, the question is about the frequency of L^m and L^n alleles. But wait, the problem states that the blood groups are determined by two codominant alleles L^m and L^n. So each person has two copies of these alleles. So, for example, someone could have L^m and L^n, which would make them express both, hence blood group MN. But the blood group is determined by which of the alleles they have.

Wait, but the problem asks for the frequency of the L^m and L^n alleles. So perhaps each person has two copies of these alleles, and the presence of L^m and L^n determines their blood group.

Wait, but perhaps the notation here is that the two codominant alleles are M and N, and the blood group is determined by having either M or N. So, the presence of at least one M allele gives blood group M, presence of at least one N gives blood group N, and presence of both gives MN. So, in this case, each person's genotype is determined by their alleles.

But how does that relate to the problem? Because the question is about the allele frequencies of L^m and L^n. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between L and M. Let me re-read the question.

The problem says that the M, MN, and N blood groups are determined by two codominantalleles: L^m and L^n. So each person has two copies of these alleles, and their phenotype is based on which allele they have. So, for example, if someone has L^m and L^m, they have blood group M. If they have L^n and L^n, they have blood group N. If they have L^m and L^n, they have blood group MN.

Wait, but wait, the numbers given are for M, MN, and N blood groups. So each person is classified into one of these categories based on their blood group. So, for example, 392 have blood group M, 336 have MN, and 72 have N.

Now, the question is about the frequency of L^m and L^n alleles. But I'm a bit stuck because the problem says that the blood groups are determined by L^m and L^n. So, each person has two copies of these alleles. So, the presence of at least one of each allele determines their blood group. 

Wait, but if someone has two copies of L^m, they have blood group M. If someone has two copies of L^n, they have blood group N. And if someone has one of each, they have blood group MN.

But the problem is about allele frequencies of L^m and L^n. So, we need to find the proportion of each allele in the population.

Wait, but let me think about how to approach this. Each person has two copies of each allele. So, for each individual, the two alleles they have are for the same gene (since it's codominant), and each of those alleles is either L^m or L^n.

So, for the M blood group, the genotype is either L^m L^m or L^n L^n. Wait, no, because in reality, the presence of any M allele leads to M blood group. So, the presence of L^m in the genotype leads to M blood group, presence of L^n leads to N, and presence of both leads to MN. So, the blood group determination is based on which allele they have, not their presence.

Wait, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me think differently. The problem states that the blood groups are determined by two codominant alleles: L^m and L^n. So, each person has two copies of these alleles. The presence of any one of each allele determines the blood group, but in codominant cases, both are expressed.

Wait, perhaps I should model each person's genotype as having two alleles of L^m and L^n, but their blood group is determined by whether they have L^m or L^n. So:

If the genotype is L^m L^m → M blood group.

If the genotype is L^n L^n → N blood group.

If the genotype is L^m L^n (codominant) → MN blood group.

Wait, but in this scenario, the presence of either allele leads to the corresponding blood group. So, the blood group MN is a result of having both alleles, but the presence of at least one determines the blood group.

But the question asks about the frequency of L^m and L^n alleles. So I need to compute how many people have L^m and how many have L^n alleles in total.

But wait, for each person, they have two alleles, each of which is L^m or L^n. So the total number of alleles in the population is 800 * 2 = 1600.

So, each of the 800 students has 2 alleles, so 1600 alleles in total.

Now, let's compute how many people have L^m and L^n alleles.

But wait, for each person:

- If they have L^m and L^m → 2 L^m alleles.

- If they have L^n and L^n → 2 L^n alleles.

- If they have L^m and L^n → 1 L^m and 1 L^n allele.

So, for each person, the number of alleles contributed by each allele is either 2, 1, or 1.

Wait, no. Each person contributes two alleles. So, for example, if an individual has two L^m alleles, they contribute both as L^m. If they have two L^n, both as L^n. If they have one of each, one L^m and one L^n.

So, to compute the total number of L^m alleles in the population, we can sum the number of L^m alleles each person contributes.

But since the blood groups are determined by the presence of L^m or L^n, each person's genotype is either L^m L^m, L^n L^n, or L^m L^n.

So, for each person:

- If genotype is L^m L^m → two L^m alleles.

- If genotype is L^n L^n → two L^n alleles.

- If genotype is L^m L^n → one L^m and one L^n.

So, for the entire population, the number of L^m alleles is equal to the number of people who have two L^m alleles (i.e., genotype L^m L^m) multiplied by 2, plus the number of people with genotype L^m L^n (each contributes one L^m) multiplied by 1. Similarly for L^n.

Wait, but the problem is about the frequency of L^m and L^n alleles. So, we need to calculate the total alleles for each.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: each person has two alleles. So, the proportion of L^m alleles is equal to the sum over all the L^m alleles, divided by the total number of alleles (1600).

Wait, so let's calculate the number of people with L^m and L^n.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is to look at each blood group and see how many people have each genotype.

For example, M blood group: 392 people, each has genotype L^m L^m (since they have at least one L^m allele). So each of these 392 contributes 2 L^m alleles. So total L^m alleles in M group: 392 * 2 = 784.

Similarly, for N blood group: 72 people, each has genotype L^n L^n. So each contributes 2 L^n alleles. So total L^n alleles in N group: 72 * 2 = 144.

Now, for MN blood group: 336 people. Each has genotype L^m L^n, which means 1 L^m and 1 L^n allele. So each contributes 1 L^m and 1 L^n. So total L^m alleles for MN group: 336 * 1 = 336. Similarly, L^n alleles: 336 * 1 = 336.

So, the total number of L^m alleles is 784 (from M) + 336 (from MN) = 1120.

The total number of L^n alleles is 144 (from N) + 336 (from MN) = 480.

Total alleles: 1600.

Now, frequencies:

Frequency of L^m = (1120) / 1600 = 0.7.

Frequency of L^n = (480) / 1600 = 0.3.

Wait, so the frequency of L^m is 70%, and L^n is 30%.

Looking at the options, let's see which option has 0.7 for L^m and 0.3 for L^n.

Option G: 0.7 for L^m and 0.3 for L^n.

So the correct answer is option G.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the blood group distribution and calculate the frequency of the alleles L^m and L^n. The blood groups are determined by codominant alleles L^m and L^n, and the population consists of 800 college students with the following phenotypes:

- Blood Group M: 392 students  
- Blood Group MN: 336 students  
- Blood Group N: 72 students  

### Step 1: Calculate the number of individuals with each genotype
- Blood Group M (L^m L^m): All individuals with this blood group have two copies of L^m. There are 392 students with this blood group.  
- Blood Group N (L^n L^n): All individuals with this blood group have two copies of L^n. There are 72 students with this blood group.  
- Blood Group MN (L^m L^n): All individuals with this blood group have one copy of L^m and one copy of L^n. There are 336 students with this blood group.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of alleles
Each student has two alleles for each gene. Therefore, the total number of alleles in the population is:

\[
800 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ alleles/student} = 1600 \text{ alleles}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of L^m and L^n alleles
- **L^m alleles from Blood Group M (L^m L^m):** Each of the 392 students contributes 2 L^m alleles.  
  \[
  392 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ L}^m/\text{student} = 784 \text{ L}^m \text{ alleles}.
  \]  
- **L^n alleles from Blood Group N (L^n L^n):** Each of the 72 students contributes 2 L^n alleles.  
  \[
  72 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ L}^n/\text{student} = 144 \text{ L}^n \text{ alleles}.
  \]  
- **L^m alleles from Blood Group MN (L^m L^n):** Each of the 336 students contributes 1 L^m allele.  
  \[
  336 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ L}^m/\text{student} = 336 \text{ L}^m \text{ alleles}.
  \]  
- **L^n alleles from Blood Group MN (L^m L^n):** Each of the 336 students contributes 1 L^n allele.  
  \[
  336 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ L}^n/\text{student} = 336 \text{ L}^n \text{ alleles}.
  \]  

### Step 4: Calculate allele frequencies
- **Frequency of L^m alleles:**
  \[
  \frac{\text{Total L}^m \text{ alleles}}{\text{Total alleles}} = \frac{784}{1600} = 0.47.
  \]
- **Frequency of L^n alleles:**
  \[
  \frac{\text{Total L}^n \text{ alleles}}{\text{Total alleles}} = \frac{144 + 336}{1600} = \frac{480}{1600} = 0.3.
  \]

### Step 5: Match the results to the options
The calculated frequencies are:
- Frequency of L^m: 0.47  
- Frequency of L^n: 0.3  

The correct option is:

**G: 0.7 for L^m and 0.3 for L^n.**

ANSWER: G
