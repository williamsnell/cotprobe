Question:

Suppose that the Durbin Watson test is applied to a regression containing two explanatory variables plus a constant with 50 data points. The test statistic takes a value of 1.53. What is the appropriate conclusion?

Options:

A: Residuals appear to be negatively autocorrelated
B: There is a strong linear relationship between the variables
C: The regression model is incorrectly specified
D: The residuals are heteroscedastic
E: Residuals appear not to be autocorrelated
F: The residuals are homoscedastic
G: There is no relationship between the variables
H: Residuals appear to be positively autocorrelated
I: Residuals appear to be perfectly autocorrelated
J: The test result is inconclusive

Okay, so I've got this Durbin-Watson test question to tackle. Let me think through it step by step. So, the question is about interpreting the Durbin-Watson (DW) test statistic. I've heard that the DW test is used to check for autocorrelation in the residuals from a regression analysis. 

The problem states that a regression model includes two explanatory variables and a constant. There are 50 data points. The DW test statistic is 1.53. I need to figure out what conclusion to draw.

First, I remember that the Durbin-Watson test produces a statistic between 0 and 4. The value of 2 is the midpoint and indicates no autocorrelation. Values below 2 suggest positive autocorrelation, while values above 2 indicate negative autocorrelation.

So, the test statistic here is 1.53, which is less than 2. That should mean positive autocorrelation in the residuals. So, the residuals are appearing to be positively correlated with their lagged values. 

Looking at the options, option A is "Residuals appear to be negatively autocorrelated." But wait, our statistic is below 2, so that's not correct. Option B says strong linear relationship, but the DW test is specifically about autocorrelation, not just linear relationships. So B probably isn't the right answer.

Option C says the model is incorrectly specified. Autocorrelation doesn't necessarily imply a wrong model. It could be due to other factors, like omitted variables or incorrect functional form. So I don't think C is the conclusion we can draw. The DW test doesn't directly test for model misspecification; it's more about the error structure.

Option D is about heteroscedasticity, which is a different issue. The DW test is about autocorrelation, not heteroscedasticity. So D is incorrect.

Option E says residuals are not autocorrelated. Since our DW is 1.53, which is less than 2, I would say residuals are autocorrelated. So E is not correct.

Option F is about residuals being homoscedastic. Again, this is a different issue. Homoscedasticity is about variance, not about autocorrelation. So F is incorrect.

Option G is no relationship, which would be the opposite of what the test statistic suggests. So G is wrong.

Option H is positive autocorrelation, which is what our test statistic indicates. So H is a possible correct answer.

Options I and J talk about perfect or inconclusive autocorrelation. The test statistic of 1.53 isn't perfect (which would be 0 or 4) and it's not inconclusive. So neither I nor J is correct.

So the appropriate conclusion is that the residuals appear to be positively autocorrelated. So the correct answer should be H.

The correct answer is H: The residuals appear to be positively autocorrelated.
