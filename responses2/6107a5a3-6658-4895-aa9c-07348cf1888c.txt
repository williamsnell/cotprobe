Okay, so I've got this integral to solve here. Let's see what it's asking. The integral is from 0 to 0.4 of y cubed times (1 minus y) squared, multiplied by Gamma(7) divided by [Gamma(4) times Gamma(3)] dy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the Gamma functions, but I remember that Gamma(n) is related to factorials. Oh right, Gamma(n) = (n-1)! for positive integers. So Gamma(4) should be 3! which is 6, Gamma(3) is 2! which is 2, and Gamma(7) is 6! which is 720. 

So plugging those in, the denominator is 6 * 2 = 12. So the integral simplifies to (720 / 12) times the integral of y^3 (1-y)^2 dy from 0 to 0.4. 720 divided by 12 is 60. So the integral becomes 60 times the integral of y^3 (1-y)^2 dy over 0 to 0.4.

Now, I need to compute that integral. Let me think about how to integrate y³(1-y)². Expanding that would make it easier. (1-y)² is 1 - 2y + y². So multiply that by y³: y³*(1 - 2y + y²) = y³ - 2y⁴ + y⁵.

So the integral becomes the integral of (y³ - 2y⁴ + y⁵) dy. Integrating term by term:

- ∫y³ dy = (y⁴)/4
- ∫-2y⁴ dy = -2*(y⁵)/5
- ∫y⁵ dy = (y⁶)/6

So putting it all together, the integral from 0 to 0.4 is [ (y⁴/4) - (2 y⁵)/5 + (y⁶/6) ] evaluated at 0.4 minus the same at 0. But at 0, all terms are zero, so it's just the expression at 0.4.

Let me calculate each term:

First term: (0.4)^4 /4. Let me compute 0.4^4: 0.4 *0.4=0.16, *0.4=0.064, *0.4=0.0256. Divided by 4 is 0.0064.

Second term: (0.4)^5 * 2/5. 0.4^5 is 0.0256 * 0.4 = 0.01024. Multiply by 2: 0.02048. Divide by 5: 0.004096.

Third term: (0.4)^6 /6. 0.4^6 is 0.01024 * 0.4 = 0.004096. Divide by 6: approximately 0.000682666...

So the integral is 0.0064 - 0.004096 + 0.000682666.

Adding those up: 0.0064 - 0.004096 is 0.002304. Then add 0.000682666 gives 0.002986666.

Wait, or perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me check that again.

Wait, wait. Let me redo the calculations step by step.

Compute each part:

At y=0.4:

First term: (0.4)^4 /4 = (0.0256) /4 = 0.0064.

Second term: (-2 y^5)/5. So y^5 is 0.4^5 = 0.0256? Wait, 0.4^5: 0.4^4 is 0.0256, multiplied by 0.4 gives 0.01024. So y^5 is 0.01024.

Multiply by -2: -0.02048. Then divide by 5: -0.004096.

Third term: (y^6)/6. y^6 is (0.4)^6. Let's compute that:

0.4^2 is 0.16,
0.4^3 is 0.064,
0.4^4 is 0.0256,
0.4^5 is 0.01024,
0.4^6 is 0.004096.

Divide by 6: 0.004096 /6 ≈ 0.000682667.

So the integral is [0.0064] - [0.004096] + [0.000682667] = ?

0.0064 minus 0.004096 is 0.002304.

Adding 0.000682667 gives 0.002986667.

So the integral from 0 to 0.4 is approximately 0.002986667.

Multiply that by 60 (from earlier factor): 0.002986667 *60 = let's compute that.

0.002986667 * 60. Well, 0.003 *60 is 0.18. So 0.002986667 is slightly less than 0.003. So 0.002986667 *60= 0.002986667 *60= (0.003 - 0.000013333)*60= 0.18 - (0.000013333 *60)= 0.18 -0.00079998≈ 0.17920002.

Wait, that can't be right because when I did the integral, the approximate value is about 0.002986667, multiplied by 60 gives 0.1792.

So the integral is approximately 0.1792.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.1792. So the correct answer should be F.

The integral is evaluated as follows:

The integrand simplifies to 60 times the integral of \( y^3(1-y)^2 \) from 0 to 0.4. Expanding the integrand gives \( y^3 - 2y^4 + y^5 \). Integrating term by term:

- \( \int y^3 \, dy = \frac{y^4}{4} \)
- \( \int -2y^4 \, dy = -\frac{2y^5}{5} \)
- \( \int y^5 \, dy = \frac{y^6}{6} \)

Evaluating these from 0 to 0.4:

- First term: \( \frac{(0.4)^4}{4} = 0.0064 \)
- Second term: \( -\frac{2(0.4)^5}{5} = -0.004096 \)
- Third term: \( \frac{(0.4)^6}{6} = 0.000682667 \)

Summing these gives \( 0.0064 - 0.004096 + 0.000682667 \approx 0.002986667 \). Multiplying by 60 gives approximately 0.1792.

Thus, the correct answer is:
