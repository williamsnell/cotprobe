Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the pH of a strong electrolyte solution. The question is about KOH, which is potassium hydroxide. I remember that KOH is a strong base, so it should dissociate completely in water. 

The problem says the concentration is 0.001 M, which is 1e-3 M. Wait, wait. Strong electrolytes, right. Strong electrolytes are ones that completely dissociate in water. So KOH should break down into K+ and OH- ions. 

Right, KOH → K+ + OH-. So each mole of KOH gives one mole of OH- ions. So in 0.001 M KOH, the concentration of OH- ions would be 0.001 M as well because it's a 1:1 ratio.

Now, the question is about the pH. I recall that pH is calculated using the formula pH = -log[H+]. But wait, since the solution is basic, the H+ ions are low. Alternatively, I can use the pOH and then convert to pH using pH = 14 - pOH because at 25°C, Kw is 1e-14, so pKw is 14.

So pOH is the negative log of [OH-]. Let's compute that. [OH-] is 0.001 M. So we take the log of 0.001. Hmm. Wait, log(0.001)= log(1e-3) which is -3. So pOH is -(-3) =3. Then pH is 14-3=11. So the pH should be 11.

Looking at the options, option H is 11. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: calculating pH using [OH-]. [OH-] is 0.001. So [H+] would be 1e-14 / 0.001. Wait, because Kw is [H+][OH-] = 1e-14. So [H+] = 1e-14 / 0.001. 0.001 is 1e-3. So 1e-14 / 1e-3 = 1e-11. So [H+] is 1e-11. So pH is -log(1e-11) = 11. Yep, same answer.

So the pH is 11, which is option H.

To determine the pH of a 0.001 M aqueous solution of the strong electrolyte KOH, we start by noting that KOH dissociates completely in water into K⁺ and OH⁻ ions. Therefore, the concentration of OH⁻ ions is equal to the concentration of KOH, which is 0.001 M.

Next, we calculate the pOH using the formula:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-]
\]

Substituting [OH⁻] = 0.001 M:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(10^{-3}) = -(-3) = 3
\]

Since the relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH}
\]

we find:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 3 = 11
\]

Thus, the pH of the solution is 11. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

H: 11
