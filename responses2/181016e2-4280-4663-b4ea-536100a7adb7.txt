Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about the percentage of U.S. residents who think political parties are corrupt in 2013. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that there were significant debates in the 2010s about political corruption. But wait, the question is about 2013, which is a bit after that period. So maybe I should think about the trends around that time.

I think in 2013, there was a growing awareness of corruption, but it wasn't completely resolved. In some states, the government has taken steps to address it, but the issue isn't completely settled. So the percentage of people who think there's corruption might have decreased a bit over time, but it's not completely gone yet.

Looking at the options: A is 36%, B is 46%, C is 66%, D is 26%, E is 16%, F is 56%, G is 96%, H is 90%, I is 86%, J is 76%.

Wait, 66% is quite high. I'm not sure about that. Maybe in 2013, a majority thought it was a problem. But I thought the percentage was lower. Let me think again. I think in 2013, some estimates might have put it around 46% or 36%. I've heard that around that time, the majority of people didn't feel it was a problem. So perhaps around 36% or 46%.

Wait, another approach: I remember that in 2013, the issue was still debated, but the majority of Americans didn't believe it was a problem. So maybe around 46%? Or maybe 56%? I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall if I've seen any statistics before.

Wait, I think the majority of people in 2013 thought that political parties were corrupt, but it wasn't a widespread belief. Or was it the opposite? No, I think the majority didn't think so. So perhaps the figure is lower than 50%. Let's see: 46% is B, 36% is A. I've read that in 2013, 46% of people thought there was corruption. So that would be option B.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the years. Maybe I should check. Oh wait, I'm pretty sure that by 2013, the majority of Americans believed that political corruption was a problem. Wait, no, that can't be right because then the percentage would be higher. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the political climate. In 2013, the Democratic party had a strong majority, and that made people think there was enough power in the system. So the percentage of people who thought the parties were corrupt would be lower. Like maybe around 36% or 46%.

Wait, I think I've read that in 2013, 46% of the U.S. population believed that corruption was a problem. That would make option B the correct answer. Alternatively, I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the question is about the last character of the answer, which is the chosen letter. So the correct answer is B, which is 46%.

The correct answer is B: 46%.

Answer:
     B: 46%
