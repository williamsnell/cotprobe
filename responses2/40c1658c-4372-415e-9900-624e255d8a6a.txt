Okay, so I've got this integral to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me see what I can remember. The problem is to evaluate the triple integral of the divergence of A over a volume V, which is a sphere of radius a centered at the origin. A is given as kr^n times r hat in spherical coordinates. Hmm, wait, I think the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates involves some terms with derivatives of the radial part.

Wait, the vector field A is written in spherical coordinates as kr^n r̂. So A is a vector field with only the radial component, right? Because r̂ is the unit vector in the radial direction.

I remember that the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is given by the sum of (1/(r^2) times the derivative of (r A_r) with respect to r, plus 1/(r sinθ) times the derivative of (A_θ sinθ) with respect to θ, plus 1/(r sinθ) times the derivative of A_φ with respect to φ). But in this case, A_θ and A_φ are zero because it's only the radial component. So the divergence simplifies a lot.

So the divergence of A would be (1/r^2) d/dr (r A_r) + 0 + 0. Because A_θ and A_φ are zero, their terms in the divergence formula disappear.

Substituting A_r = kr^n, so let's compute that. The divergence would be (1/r^2) * d/dr (r * kr^n). Let's compute r*A_r: r times kr^n is kr^{n+1}. Then take the derivative with respect to r: d/dr (kr^{n+1}) = k(n+1) r^n.

Multiply by (1/r^2): (1/r^2) * k(n+1) r^n = k(n+1) r^{n-2}.

So the divergence is k(n+1) r^{n-2}.

Now, the integral is the triple integral of this divergence over the volume V, which is a sphere of radius a.

So I need to compute the integral of k(n+1) r^{n-2} dV, where dV in spherical coordinates is r^2 sinθ dr dθ dφ.

So the integral becomes k(n+1) ∫ (from r=0 to a) r^{n-2} * r^2 dr ∫ (θ=0 to π) sinθ dθ ∫ (φ=0 to 2π) dφ.

Let me compute each integral step by step.

First, the radial integral: ∫ from 0 to a of r^{n-2} * r^2 dr. That's r^{n} dr. So the integral is [r^{n+1}/(n+1)] from 0 to a, which is a^{n+1}/(n+1) minus 0. So the radial part evaluates to a^{n+1}/(n+1).

Next, the angular integrals: ∫ sinθ dθ from 0 to π is 2. Because the integral of sinθ is -cosθ, evaluated from 0 to π: -cos π + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2.

The φ integral is ∫ dφ from 0 to 2π, which is 2π.

Putting it all together: k(n+1) * (a^{n+1}/(n+1)) ) * 2 * 2π.

Simplify the terms: k (n+1) * a^{n+1} / (n+1) simplifies to k a^{n+1}.

Then multiply by 2 * 2π: 2 * 2π =4π. So the entire integral is k a^{n+1} * 4π.

Looking at the options, option G is 2π k a^{n+1}. Hmm. Wait, no: option G is 2π k a^{n+1}, option E is 6π k a^{n+1}, etc.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the integral. Oh wait, no, wait: I think I forgot the (n+1) in the radial integral.

Wait, let me write it again:

The radial integral is ∫ r^{n-2} * r^2 dr = ∫ r^{n} dr from 0 to a. That's [r^{n+1}/(n+1)] from 0 to a → a^{n+1}/(n+1).

So the integral is k(n+1) * (a^{n+1}/(n+1)) ) * 2 * 2π.

So the (n+1) cancels out, leaving k a^{n+1} multiplied by 4π, which is 4πk a^{n+1}.

So the integral equals 4πk a^{n+1}, which is option G? Wait, no. Let me check the options:

Option G is 2π k a^{n+1}.

Wait, no, let me look at the options again. The options are labeled A to J.

Looking back:

A: 4πk a^{n+2} (no, wait, no, A is 4πk a^{n+2}).

Wait no, the options are:

Options:

A: 4π k a^n+2 → no, I think I misread.

Wait, no, the options are:

A: 4π k a^{n+2}
B: π k a^{n+2}
C: 2π k a^{n+1}
D:5π k a^{n+3}
E:6π k a^{n+1}
F:4π k a^{n+1}
G:2π k a^{n+2}
H:4π k a^{n-1}
I:4π k a^n
J:3π k a^n

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in reading the options. Let me check again.

Wait, no, the options are:

A: 4π k a^{n+2}
B: π k a^{n+2}
C: 2π k a^{n+1}
D:5π k a^{n+3}
E:6π k a^{n+1}
F:4π k a^{n+1}
G:2π k a^{n+2}
H:4π k a^{n-1}
I:4π k a^n
J:3π k a^n

Wait, no, perhaps I got the exponents wrong. No, wait, the problem says evaluate the integral, which I came up with 4πk a^{n+1}.

So looking for 4πk a^{n+1}, which is option F (since F is 4π k a^{n+1}).

Wait, but I thought I got 4πk a^{n+1}. So the correct answer would be option F.

Wait, but looking back, the question is "Evaluate the integral (the triple integral) of the divergence of A over V." And I found that the integral is 4πk a^{n+1}. So that's F.

But wait, I thought another approach could lead to a different result. Let me think again.

Wait another thought: maybe I made a mistake in the divergence calculation. Let me go through it again.

Vector field A = kr^n r̂. So in spherical coords, A_r = kr^n, A_theta=0, A_phi=0.

divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r A_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (sinθ A_θ) + (1/(r sinθ)) dφ/φ (A_φ).

Since A_θ and A_φ are zero, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r * kr^n).

Inside the derivative: r * kr^n = kr^{n+1}.

Derivative with respect to r: k (n+1) r^n.

Multiply by 1/r^2: k(n+1) r^{n-2}.

So the integrand is k(n+1) r^{n-2}.

The volume integral in spherical coordinates is:

Integral over r from 0 to a: ∫ r^{n-2} * r² dr → r^{n} dr.

Integrate r^{n} from 0 to a: a^{n+1}/(n+1).

Multiply by the other terms:

The angular integrals: dΩ = sinθ dθ dφ.

So the integral becomes:

k(n+1) * (a^{n+1}/(n+1)) ) * ∫0^{2π} dφ * ∫0^π sinθ dθ.

Compute the angular parts:

∫0^{2π} dφ = 2π.

∫0^{π} sinθ dθ = 2.

So the angular integral is 2 * 2π =4π.

Putting it all together:

k(n+1) * (a^{n+1}/(n+1)) ) * 4π =4π k a^{n+1}.

So the integral is 4π k a^{n+1}, which is option F.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is written as 4π k a^{n+1}, yes.

So the correct answer is option F.

To evaluate the integral \(\int\int\int_V \nabla \bullet \mathbf{A} \, dV\), where \(V\) is a sphere of radius \(a\) centered at the origin and \(\mathbf{A} = kr^n \hat{r}\) in spherical coordinates, we proceed as follows:

1. **Divergence of \(\mathbf{A}\):**  
   Since \(\mathbf{A}\) has only the radial component, \(\mathbf{A}_\theta = 0\) and \(\mathbf{A}_\phi = 0\), the divergence simplifies to:  
   \[
   \nabla \bullet \mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r \mathbf{A}_r \right).
   \]  
   Substituting \(\mathbf{A}_r = kr^n\), we find:  
   \[
   \nabla \bullet \mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r \cdot kr^n \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( kr^{n+1} \right) = k(n+1) r^{n-2}.
   \]

2. **Integral in Spherical Coordinates:**  
   The integral becomes:  
   \[
   \int_0^a \int_0^\pi \int_0^{2\pi} k(n+1) r^{n-2} r^2 \sin\theta \, d\phi \, d\theta \, dr.
   \]  
   Simplifying the integrand:  
   \[
   k(n+1) \int_0^a r^{n} \, dr \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi.
   \]

3. **Evaluating Angular Integrals:**  
   - \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi = 2\pi\).  
   - \(\int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta = 2\).  
   The product of these gives \(4\pi\).

4. **Evaluating Radial Integral:**  
   \[
   \int_0^a r^{n} \, dr = \frac{a^{n+1}}{n+1}.
   \]

5. **Combining Results:**  
   Substituting back:  
   \[
   k(n+1) \cdot \frac{a^{n+1}}{n+1} \cdot 4\pi = 4\pi k a^{n+1}.
   \]

6. **Matching with Options:**  
   The result matches **option F: \(4\pi k a^{n+1}\)**.
