Question:

Carol Collector was a serious antique car buyer, and was always searching for Thunderbirds in good shape. She saw a newspaper ad offering a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe for $25,000, The ad also gave a website address "to view a picture of the car," which Carol visited, and which showed a T-Bird with a perfect body and interior. Carol paid the $25,000 and signed a sales contract which specified that the Thunderbird was "used and sold as is." When Carol went to pick up the car, she learned it was a 1968 model, which was not at all rare and worth much less than the advertised 1964 model. If Carol brings suit against the seller, the likely outcome is for

Options:

A: Carol, because the seller was not negligent in providing a picture of the car.
B: Carol, because the "as is" disclosure was not totally effective.
C: The seller, unless they can prove Carol had knowledge that the car was a 1968 model.
D: The seller, because the car was misrepresented in the advertisement.
E: The seller, because the buyer was aware the Thunderbird was sold "as is."
F: Carol, unless the seller can prove the 1968 model was of equal value to the 1964 model.
G: The seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.
H: The seller, if Carol can prove she relied on the picture when making her purchase.
I: Carol, because the seller provided a picture of the car, regardless of its condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question about a case involving a sale contract and negligence. Let me read the question again carefully.

Carol Collector bought a Thunderbird and saw an ad offering it for $25,000. The ad included a website with a picture of the car. She viewed it, and the car she received was a 1968 model, which was not rare and actually much cheaper. She sued the seller and wants to know the likely outcome.

The question is about whether Carol's damages are valid. The key points to consider are what the contract terms say and whether the seller can prove the contract was broken.

The contract says the car is "used and sold as is." So, for that, the contract must specify that the car is to be sold as is. That means the seller has to tell Carol the actual condition, even if that's not what she viewed. Otherwise, Carol's claim might be based on a misrepresented image.

In this case, Carol saw a picture of a 1964 Thunderbird, but the actual car was a 1968. The contract doesn't say anything about the condition of the car being displayed. So Carol's claim is based on the image showing a 1964 car, but the actual car is 1968.

Now, the question is about whether Carol can recover damages based on the contract. If the contract says it's "used and sold as is," then the seller is responsible for the representation. But is that enough? I think the contract must include a statement that the car is to be sold as is. If it doesn't, the seller can be held liable for any misrepresentation.

So, the question is, did the seller make a mistake? The ad included a picture, which Carol thought was a 1964, but the actual model was 1968. The contract doesn't specify the condition of the car. So the seller is supposed to tell Carol what the car is. Since they didn't, Carol can't rely on the contract terms and can sue.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Carol is right because the seller wasn't negligent in providing a picture. But the contract requires the seller to tell the actual condition, so here the seller didn't do that. So she's right.

Option B: Carol is right because the "as is" wasn't totally effective. Wait, I think "as is" is a standard contract term meaning the seller is responsible for the condition. So it's not that it's not totally effective; the contract requires it. So B might not be correct.

Wait, no. The "as is" clause requires that the seller tell the buyer the actual condition of the goods. If the contract doesn't specify, then the seller isn't bound, and Carol can sue for damages.

So, Carol's claim is based on a misrepresentation. So she can sue unless the seller can prove that the contract was breached.

Looking at the options again. Option G says the seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car. Wait, the contract says "as is," which is a general term, not specific. So the seller didn't state the actual condition, so Carol can sue unless the seller can show that the contract was breached.

Option C: seller, unless they can prove Carol had knowledge that the car was 1968. That doesn't sound right. Because the contract doesn't specify the condition, Carol's only defense is the contract being breached.

Option E: seller because Carol was aware. No, the contract says "used and sold as is," not that the buyer knew. So E is incorrect.

Option F: seller because it was equally valued. But the contract doesn't say anything about value. It just says "used and sold as is." So Carol can sue for the actual damages, not just because it's equal value.

Option H: seller, unless they were negligent in not stating the picture. Again, the contract doesn't specify. So H is incorrect because the contract doesn't say anything about the picture.

Option I: Carol because seller provided a picture regardless of condition. Correct, because the contract requires the seller to tell the actual condition, and Carol can sue for damages.

So the correct answer is I.

Carol Collector's case hinges on the contract terms specifying that the Thunderbird, to be sold, must be "used and sold as is." The ad included a picture of a 1964 Thunderbird, but the actual car was a 1968 model. Since the contract does not require the seller to disclose the actual condition, Carol can sue for damages. The key issue is whether the seller breached their contract by omitting crucial information.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A:** Correct. Carol can recover damages as the seller breached the contract by not providing the necessary information.
- **B:** Incorrect. The "as is" clause requires the seller to disclose the actual condition; it does not prevent Carol from recovering damages.
- **C:** Incorrect. Carol's claim is based on a misrepresentation, not knowledge of the car's condition.
- **D:** Incorrect. The contract does not imply equal value; it only specifies that the car is to be sold as is.
- **E:** Incorrect. The contract does not entitle the buyer to know the car's condition.
- **F:** Incorrect. Carol can recover damages based on actual damages, not mere value equivalence.
- **G:** Incorrect. The seller is not liable for breach of contract by omitting the actual condition.
- **H:** Incorrect. The contract does not require the seller to state the condition.
- **I:** Correct. Carol can sue for damages because the seller provided a picture regardless of the car's condition.

The most accurate outcome is that Carol can recover damages, so the answer is **I**.
