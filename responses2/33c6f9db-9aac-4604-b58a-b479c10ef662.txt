Okay, so I've got this question here about converting a written number into a numeral. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says Manuel bought a used car for six thousand forty-nine dollars. I need to find out what that cost is written as a numeral and then choose the correct option from A to J. 

First, I'll break down the phrase. "Six thousand" is straightforward. That should be 6,000. Then there's "forty-nine." I remember that in numbers, forty is 40 and nine is 9, so forty-nine is 49. 

Putting that together, it should be 6,000 plus 49. Let me add them: 6,000 + 49 = 6,049. So the total cost is $6,049.

Now, looking at the options, let me check each one. The options are:

A: $6049
B: $604.9
C: $6,490
D: $6,940
E: $6,409
F: $9,406
G: $6,049
H: $649
I: $60,490
J: $4,069

So option G is $6,049, which matches what I calculated. The other options don't seem right. For example, option A is missing the commas and the dollar sign. Option B is way smaller, only 604.9, which is way less than 6,049. Option C is 6,490, which is more than 6,049. Option D is 6,940, which is higher. Option E is 6,409, still higher than 6,049. Option F is 9,406, which is a higher number but with a comma missing. Option H is 649, which is way too small. Option I is 60,490, which is way bigger. Option J is 4,069, which is also smaller than 6,049.

So the correct answer must be option G: $6,049.
