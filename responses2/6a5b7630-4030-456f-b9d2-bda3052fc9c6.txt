Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the the following petition to answer questions.
The Scribbling-Machines have thrown thousands of your petitioners out of employ, whereby they are brought into great distress, and are not able to procure a maintenance for their families, and deprived them of the opportunity of bringing up their children to labour. … The number of Scribbling-Machines extending about seventeen miles south-west of Leeds exceed all belief, being no less than one hundred and seventy! And as each machine will do as much work in twelve hours, as ten men can in that time do by hand, … [And, as the machines do] as much work in one day as would otherwise employ twenty men, … [a] full four thousand men are left to shift for a living how they can, and must of course fall to the Parish, if not timely relieved. … How are those men, thus thrown out of employ to provide for their families; and what are they to put their children apprentice to, that the rising generation may have something to keep them at work, in order that they may not be like vagabonds strolling about in idleness? … Many more evils we could enumerate, but we would hope, that the sensible part of mankind, who are not biased by interest, must see the dreadful tendency of their continuance; a depopulation must be the consequence; trade being then lost, the landed interest will have no other satisfaction but that of being last devoured.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about a petition to understand which historical event it's referring to. The question gives me a lot of text about a petition to Leeds Woolen Workers Petition from 1786. Let me break it down.

First, the petition mentions that a lot of people are being thrown out of work by machines, which are extending about 17 miles southwest of Leeds. Each machine works twelve hours, but ten men can do as much in that time. So the machines are doing as much work as twenty men would. That suggests these machines are doing more than enough to replace laborers, which makes me think about industrialization and the role of machinery.

The petition says that a full four thousand men are left to shift for a living. They have to go to the parish, which implies that these workers are being excluded from their families and communities. So the issue is about the loss of working-class participation in society due to machines.

Looking at the options:

A: Luddite movement in eighteenth century Britain. The Luddite movement was about people escaping debt by working in poor conditions, which is similar but seems more about debt relief. This petition is about workers and machines, not debt.

B: Decline of British economy in eighteenth century. The text doesn't indicate a decline in economic activity, especially since it mentions machines and replacement of laborers, which suggests an industrial revolution.

C: Protest against child labor in eighteenth century. The text does mention child labor, but more about machines replacing workers. It's possible, but I'm not sure if it's the main point.

D: Rise of trade unions in eighteenth century. This seems off because the text doesn't mention unions. It's more about machines, not union organizing labor.

E: Spread of revolutionary ideas in working class. Again, the text doesn't support revolutionary ideas; it's about industrialization and exclusion.

F: More use of child labor. The text doesn't mention increased child labor; it's about machines replacing other workers, not more.

G: Replacement of traditional laborers by machines. This seems to fit because the petition talks about machines replacing the need for labor, which is a key point here. The text mentions that each machine does as much work as ten men, implying a shift from human labor to machine-based production.

So the petition is addressing the issue of machines replacing traditional labor, which is a significant event in the history of British industrialization. That's the replacement of labor with machinery, leading to economic change. So the correct answer should be G.

The Leeds Woolen Workers Petition refers to the replacement of traditional laborers with machinery, which is a significant event in the history of British industrialization. This aligns with option G, which describes the shift from traditional labor to machinery.

**Answer: G**
