Okay, so today I came across this question about Kant's moral philosophy, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about what makes an action morally worth doing, according to Kant.

I remember that Kant talked a lot about ethics being based on moral principles. The question mentions four options: A is the moral character of the agent, B is the consequences, C is the maxim, and D is all of the above.

Alright, let's break it down. Kant's moral principles are meant to guide how we should act. I think he talked about 'maxims,' which are the rules or commands that ought to be followed. So the maxim would be the rule that determines what's right. That would support option C.

But the question is about what makes an action morally worth doing, so it's more than just the maxim. The maxim is a rule, but the worth comes from the consequences. So even if the rule is followed, the actual outcome matters. For example, if you have a choice between two actions that both fit the maxim, but one leads to a happy end and the other a sad one, the consequences would determine which is better. That's option B.

Also, I think Kant considered the moral character as part of the maxim. The character can determine the action's worth beyond just the consequences. So the character (option A) plays a role. So all three—consequences, maxim, and character—might be factors.

Wait, but the question is asking what determines the moral worth. So all three (A, B, C) are involved. That would mean the correct answer is D: all of the above.

Alternatively, maybe the maxim is a rule that's meant to guide the agent. So the agent's character would determine whether they follow the maxim. Like, if the maxim is being good, then the agent's character (how they act) would determine if they act in accordance with it.

So putting it all together, the moral worth depends on both the consequences (B), the maxim (C), and the agent's character (A). So all three are considered, making D the correct answer.

According to Kant, the moral worth of an action depends on both the consequences of the action (B), the maxim that is acted on (C), and the moral character of the agent performing it (A). Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: D
