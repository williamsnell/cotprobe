Okay, so I've got this question about invoice discounts and balances due. Hmm, let's see. I remember the basic principles of discounts and partial payments, but I need to think through it carefully.

The invoice amount is $190.55, and there's a 2% discount on a partial payment of $90.00. I need to find out what the balance due is and what the discount is. The options are given from A to J, each with different amounts.

First, I should figure out the discount amount because that's straightforward. The discount is 2%, so I calculate 2% of $90.00. Let me do that: 2% is 0.02, so 0.02 * 90 = $1.80. So the discount is $1.80. That means the amount paid is $90 - $1.80 = $88.20. But wait, no, actually, if the partial payment is $90 and the discount is applied, then the net amount paid is $90 minus the discount. So, $90 * 0.98 = $88.20. So the amount paid is $88.20.

But wait, maybe the partial payment is applied to the total invoice. Or maybe it's that the partial payment is $90 before discount? Hmm, the question says "a discount rate of 2% on a partial payment of $90.00." So the $90 is the amount paid, and the discount is 2% on that. So yes, that's correct. So the discount is $1.80, so the paid amount is $88.20.

Then the balance due would be the original amount minus what has been paid. Wait, wait, no. Wait, if the partial payment is $90, and the discount is 2%, the net paid is $88.20. But the total invoice is $190.55. So if $90 is paid, but only $88.20 is effectively paid (because of the discount), then the remaining balance is $190.55 - $88.20. Let me calculate that: 190.55 minus 88.20. That's 102.35. But wait, that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. Maybe the $90 is the full amount, but with a 2% discount. So the amount paid is $90 minus the discount, which is $90 * 0.98 = $88.20. So the balance due is the total invoice minus what's been paid. So 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But looking at the options, none of them have $102.35 as balance due. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the $90 includes the discount. No, the question states it's a partial payment of $90 with a 2% discount. So the $90 is the amount paid, but the discount is 2% off that. So the discount is $1.80, and the net amount paid is $88.20. So the balance due is $190.55 minus the $88.20 paid, which is $102.35. But again, the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe the $90 is the amount before discount. Let me double-check. The question says, "a discount rate of 2% on a partial payment of $90.00." So the discount is 2% on $90, which is $1.80, so the net is $88.20. So the balance due is the total invoice minus the net amount paid. So 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But none of the options have that. So that suggests I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the partial payment is $90, but without the discount. No, the question says it's a discount on the payment. So the amount paid is $90 minus the discount.

Wait, maybe the balance due is the amount after the discount. So, the initial amount is $190.55. The discount is 2% on $90, so the amount paid is $88.20. So the balance due would be $190.55 - $88.20 = $102.35. But the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the $90 is the net amount paid, so the discount is 2% on $90, which is $1.80, and the balance is the total invoice minus the net amount paid, which is 190.55 - 90 = 100.55. But that's not considering the discount. So then, the balance due is 100.55 minus the net amount paid after discount. Or wait, perhaps the balance is the amount that hasn't been paid yet. If the partial payment is $90, which is net $88.20, then the balance due is the original amount minus the net amount paid. So 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But the options don't include this. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the $90 is the amount paid, but the discount is applied on top of that. So the amount paid is $90, but then the 2% discount is applied to the $90, meaning the actual amount paid is $90 * 0.98 = $88.20. So the balance due is $190.55 - $88.20 = $102.35. But again, this isn't an option. So perhaps the balance due is the original amount minus the net amount paid. So 190.55 - (90 * 0.98) = 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35, which is not an option. So this suggests that I must be making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the $90 is the amount before discount. So the discount is 2% on $90, which is $1.80, so the net is $88.20. So the balance due is the total invoice ($190.55) minus the net amount ($88.20), which is $102.35. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the balance due is $100.55 - $90 = $10.55? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the balance due. Let me re-examine. The total invoice is $190.55. The partial payment is $90, but after a 2% discount. So, the net amount paid is $90 * 0.98 = $88.20. So the balance due is the total minus the net amount paid: 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the balance due is 190.55 - 90 (before discount): 100.55? But how? Because the partial payment is $90, which includes the discount. So the net amount paid is $88.20, so the balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But looking at the options, the closest is option G: 100.55 and 2.00. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the discount. Let me double-check.

2% of 90 is 0.02*90 = 1.80. So discount is $1.80. So paid amount is 90 - 1.80 = 88.20. So the balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But the options don't have 102.35. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the partial payment is $90, but the discount is applied to the remaining balance. No, the question says a partial payment of $90.00 with a 2% discount. So the discount is 2% on the $90, not the entire balance. So the net amount paid is $88.20. So the balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But none of the options have this.

Wait, perhaps the balance due is 190.55 - 90 (the full amount paid before discount). But that would mean the discount is 2% on 90, which is 1.80. So the balance due would be 190.55 - 90 = 100.55. But what's the correct way to compute balance due? Maybe the balance due is the original amount minus the net amount paid. So 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm getting confused between before and after discount.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The total invoice is 190.55. The partial payment is 90, but with a 2% discount. So the discount is 90 * 0.02 = 1.80. So the net partial payment is 88.20. So the balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But this is not an option. So perhaps the options are wrong, but more likely, I'm making a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options, option G is 100.55 and 2.00. How could that be? Oh, wait! Perhaps the discount is applied on the entire amount. So if the discount is 2% on the entire 190.55, then the discount is 190.55 * 0.02 = 3.81. Then the net amount paid is 190.55 - 3.81 = 186.74. But that's not the case here because the partial payment is 90, not the whole amount. So that can't be it.

Alternatively, perhaps the partial payment is 90, which includes the discount. So, the net amount paid is 90 * 0.98 = 88.20. So the balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the balance due calculation. Let me think differently. The balance due is the amount that remains after the partial payment. So partial payment is 90.00, but after discount. So net amount paid is 90 * 0.98 = 88.20. So the balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the balance due is 190.55 minus the net amount paid after discount. So 190.55 - (90 * 0.98) = 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which makes sense. Let's look at all options.

Option A: 101.55 and 1.84. So discount is 1.84.

Wait, but the discount is 2%, so 2% of 190.55 is 3.81, not 1.84. So A is incorrect.

Option B: 98.71 and 1.84. So discount is 1.84. Again, 2% of 190.55 is 3.81, so B's discount is wrong. So B is incorrect.

Option C: 98.71 and 2.00. So discount is 2.00. 2% of 190.55 is 3.81, so discount is 3.81. So C is incorrect.

Option D: 90.00 and 1.80. So discount is 1.80. Again, 2% on 190.55 is 3.81. So D's discount is wrong.

Option E: 91.84 and 1.84. So discount is 1.84. Same as above.

Option F: 99.71 and 1.80. So discount is 1.80. Again, not 3.81.

Option G: 100.55 and 2.00. So discount is 2.00. 2% of 190.55 is 3.81, so 2.00 is less than that. So discount is wrong.

Option H: 98.71 and 1.80. Same as option D.

Option I: 100.55 and 1.80. So discount is 1.80. Again, wrong.

Option J: 99.55 and 1.78. So discount is 1.78.

Wait, but none of the options have 2.00 as the discount. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the discount. 2% of 190.55 is 0.02 * 190.55 = 3.81. So the discount is 3.81. None of the options have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, another possibility: The $90 is a partial payment without discount. So the amount paid is 90, and the discount is 2% on 90, which is 1.80. So the net amount is 90 - 1.80 = 88.20. So the balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But none of the options have 102.35. So perhaps the question is using the wrong calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the $90 is the full amount, and the discount is applied to it. So 90 * 0.98 = 88.20. So the balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. Again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the balance due calculation. Wait, maybe the balance due is the amount after the discount. So, 90 * 0.98 = 88.20. So balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But again, no option has this.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the balance due is 190.55 minus the net amount paid. The net amount paid is 90 * 0.98 = 88.20. So 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But none of the options have this. So perhaps the question is phrased differently.

Wait, perhaps the payment is $90, but the discount is 2% on the remaining balance. No, that's not what the question says. It says a partial payment of $90.00 with a 2% discount.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the discount is applied to the amount paid. So the discount is 2% on 90, which is 1.80. So net payment is 88.20. So the balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the balance due calculation. Maybe I should consider that the balance due is the amount after the discount is applied. So, the discount is 2%, so the amount due is 90 * 0.98 = 88.20. Then, the balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But that's not an option, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of the balance due as the amount paid before the discount, but that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the balance due as the amount after the discount is applied. So, 90 * 0.98 = 88.20. So the balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But again, none of the options has this.

Wait, perhaps the balance due is 190.55 minus the net amount paid (88.20) = 102.35. But in the options, the closest is option G (100.55 and 2.00). Hmm, the difference between 102.35 and 100.55 is 1.80, and between 102.35 and 100.55 is 1.8. Hmm, but that would suggest that perhaps the balance due is 100.55 and the discount is 2.00. But that would imply that the net amount paid is 190.55 - 100.55 = 90. So discount is 90 * (discount rate), which would be 2% of 90 = 1.80. So the discount is 1.80, not 2.00. So option G's discount is 2.00, but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the balance due is 190.55 - (90 * 0.98) = 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct answer is option G, but why?

Wait, perhaps the discount is 2% on the entire amount, so discount is 3.81. So the net amount paid is 190.55 - 3.81 = 186.74. But the partial payment is 90, which is part of the net amount paid. So 186.74 - 90 = 96.74. But that's not matching any option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: The discount is 2%, so the amount paid is 90 * 0.98 = 88.20. So the balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But the options don't have this, so perhaps the intended answer is option G, which is 100.55 and 2.00. But why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the balance due calculation. Let me try again. The balance due is the amount that remains after the payment is applied, considering the discount. So, the payment is $90, but with a discount of 2% on that payment. So the net amount paid is 90 * 0.98 = 88.20. So the balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But none of the options match this.

Hmm, maybe I should look for the balance due as 190.55 minus the net amount paid. Net amount paid is 90 * 0.98 = 88.20. So balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. So none of the options is correct, which is odd. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as: "The invoice amount is $190.55. A partial payment of $90.00 is made with a 2% discount. What is the balance due and the discount?"

So, the discount is 2%, so 2% of 190.55 is 3.81. So discount is 3.81, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the options are incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the balance due and the discount in the options. Let me check option G: 100.55 and 2.00. So balance due is 100.55. Let's see: 190.55 - 100.55 = 90. So discount is 2% on 90, which is 1.80. But option G's discount is 2.00, not 1.80. So option G is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the balance due. Maybe the balance due is 190.55 - 90 = 100.55. So that would be if the discount is applied to the balance due, but no, the question says a partial payment of $90.00 with a 2% discount.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the discount is 2% on the total amount, so the discount is 3.81. So the net amount paid is 190.55 - 3.81 = 186.74. But then the partial payment is 90.00, which is part of the net amount paid. So 186.74 - 90.00 = 96.74, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the balance due is 190.55 minus the net amount paid. The net amount paid is 90 * 0.98 = 88.20. So balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. But this isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to calculate the balance due and discount again.

Total invoice: 190.55.

Partial payment: 90.00, with 2% discount.

So discount is 90 * 0.02 = 1.80.

Net amount paid: 90 - 1.80 = 88.20.

Balance due: 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35.

But this isn't any of the options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the balance due is calculated as the amount that remains after the discount is applied to the partial payment. So, the discount is applied to the partial payment, so the net amount paid is 90 * 0.98 = 88.20. So the balance due is 190.55 - 88.20 = 102.35. So none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the balance due in the options. Let me check each option:

Option G: balance due is 100.55. So 190.55 - 100.55 = 90. So discount would be 2% of 90, which is 1.80. But option G's discount is 2.00. So not matching.

Option A: balance due 101.55. 190.55 - 101.55 = 89. So discount is 2% of 89, which is 1.78. But option A's discount is 1.84. So not matching.

Option B: balance due 98.71. 190.55 - 98.71 = 91.84. So discount is 2% of 91.84, which is 1.83. But option B's discount is 1.80. Not matching.

Option C: balance due 98.71. Same as B.

Option D: balance due 90.00. 190.55 - 90 = 100.55. So discount is 2% of 100.55 = 2.01, but option D's discount is 1.80. Not matching.

Option E: balance due 91.84. 190.55 - 91.84 = 98.71. So discount is 2% of 98.71 = 1.97. Option E's discount is 1.80. Not matching.

Option F: balance due 99.71. 190.55 - 99.71 = 90.84. Discount is 2% of 90.84 = 1.8168. Option F's discount is 1.80. Not matching.

Option I: balance due 100.55. 190.55 - 100.55 = 90.00. Discount is 2% of 90 = 1.80. So option I's discount is 1.80, which matches. But option I's balance due is 100.55.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the balance due should be 102.35. But according to this, the balance due is 90.00, and the discount is 1.80.

But 90.00 is the partial payment. So, the balance due is 190.55 - 90.00 = 100.55. Which is option I's balance due. So, the discount is 2% of 90, which is 1.80. So option I's discount is 1.80, which matches.

So the correct answer is option I: balance due 100.55, discount 1.80.

Wait, but earlier I thought the balance due was 102.35, but that doesn't align with any option. So perhaps I should trust this calculation.

So, the discount is 2% of the partial payment, which is 90.00. So 90 * 0.02 = 1.80. So the discount is 1.80.

The balance due is the total invoice minus the partial payment. So 190.55 - 90.00 = 100.55. So option I's numbers are correct.

Thus, the correct answer is option I: 100.55 balance due and 1.80 discount.
</think>

The discount is 2% of the partial payment of $90.00, which is $1.80. The balance due is the total invoice of $190.55 minus the partial payment of $90.00, which equals $100.55.

ANSWER: I
