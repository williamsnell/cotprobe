Okay, so I've got this question about aggregate supply and aggregate demand. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through. 

The question says that both the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) and aggregate demand (AD) increase. And I'm supposed to pick which statement is certain. The options are A to J.

Wait, what do I remember about AD and SRAS? Aggregate demand is the total demand for all goods and services in an economy. SRAS is the total supply of goods and services, but at a specific price level. So if AD and SRAS both increase, what does that mean for the economy?

I think when AD increases, it can either shift right (increase) or come from a shift in the equation. But here, both are increasing. Let me think about the simultaneous increase. 

In the short run, if AD increases, it might shift right. For SRAS, if it increases, it also shifts right. But what happens to the two? Well, in the short run, the economy might try to adjust. If both are increasing, what's the effect?

Wait, the short-run equilibrium is where AD intersects SRAS, and then the AD/AS model shows that. If both AD and SRAS shift right, it's like a rightward shift of both. So the new equilibrium could be at a higher price level and higher real GDP, same real GDP, or maybe different. But is that certain?

Wait, no. Because if both AD and SRAS shift right, the new point depends on the slopes of the curves. But the question is about certain conclusions, not about the possibility.

In the long run, the SRAS curve is vertical (assuming constant technology and labor), so if AD increases, SRAS remains fixed. Then AD shifts right, leading to higher price level and higher real GDP. So in the long run, both AD and SRAS increase. So the economy would be at a higher Y and higher P, I think.

But wait, the question says "short-run" in the question. So does the question refer to short-run or long-run?

Wait, the question says "both short-run aggregate supply and aggregate demand increase." Oh wait, no, the question is about the effect of both increasing. So perhaps the question is about the short-run analysis.

Wait, but in the short run, the SRAS curve is not vertical. If both AD and SRAS shift right, what happens? Let's say AD increases by 100, and SRAS increases by 50. The new equilibrium will depend on which shifts more.

Wait, but the question is about what can be said for certain. So if both AD and SRAS increase, what is certain?

Let me think about possible outcomes.

In the short run: If AD increases and SRAS increases, the new equilibrium could be at higher P and higher Y. Or maybe lower P and higher Y, depending on how much each shifts.

But the question says both increase. So let's say AD increases by some amount, and SRAS increases by some other amount.

In the SRAS curve, when it shifts right, it's because the price level is lower. So if SRAS shifts right, the equilibrium real GDP would increase. But AD shifting right would increase both P and Y.

But wait, the initial equilibrium is at AD0 and SRAS0, leading to P0 and Y0.

If AD increases to AD1 and SRAS increases to SR1, so AD1 > AD0 and SR1 > SR0.

Where does AD1 and SR1 intersect?

If AD1 is to the right of SR1, then the new equilibrium would have P1 > P0 and Y1 > Y0.

But if AD1 is not to the right of SR1, then maybe the equilibrium is at a lower P but higher Y? Or even if they cross, could it be lower Y?

Wait, no, in the SRAS curve, when it shifts right, for a given price level, real GDP increases. So if AD is increasing and SRAS is also increasing, the new equilibrium could be two possibilities: either both prices and real GDP go up, or one goes up and the other goes down if the shifts are too large.

But the question is about what is certain. So, looking at the options:

Option E says price level rises and real GDP falls. That can't be, because SRAS shifts right (so real GDP rises). Unless AD shifts left, but here AD is increasing. So E is incorrect.

Option J says both rise. But if AD shifts more than SRAS, then yes. But if SRAS shifts more, then no. But the question says both increases, but doesn't specify how much. So the conclusion isn't certain. So J can't be certain.

Option F says price level rises and real GDP remains same. No, because SRAS shifted right, so real GDP would rise.

Option D: Real GDP falls but change in P is uncertain. No, because SRAS shifted right, so real GDP increases.

Option B: Price level rises but change in real GDP is uncertain. So, for example, if AD shifts more than SRAS, then real GDP would rise. But if AD shifts less, real GDP might remain the same or even fall. But since both are increasing, perhaps the AD effect is more than SRAS.

Wait, but the question is about what is certain. So, let's think about the possible outcome.

In the short run, SRAS is upward sloping, so shifting right increases Y. AD is also upward sloping, so shifting right increases P.

But the net effect is ambiguous unless we know the magnitudes. However, the question is about which statement is "certain"—i.e., what must happen.

Wait, the question is about the short-run. So in the short-run, SRAS is not vertical. So, if AD increases and SRAS increases, the new equilibrium will have P higher than before, and Y higher than before. Because both shifts cause higher values on both axes.

So, both P and Y would rise. So the correct option is E: Price level rises and real GDP falls. No, wait—no, I think it should be both rise.

Wait, wait, no. So, for example, if AD increases more than SRAS, the equilibrium is higher P and higher Y. If AD increases less, maybe P doesn't rise as much, but Y does. But the question is about what can be said for certain.

Wait, but the question is about what is certain in the short-run. So, the correct outcome would be that both P and Y increase. Because in the short run, SRAS is not vertical, so both shifts cause their respective variables to increase.

So looking at the options, which one states that both P and Y increase. Option J says both rise. So E is incorrect because price rises and Y falls? No, Y would rise. Wait no, E says price level rises but real GDP falls. That can't be right because SRAS would cause real GDP to rise.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option E: Price level rises but real GDP falls. No, that's impossible because if SRAS shifts right, real GDP should rise. So that's not correct.

Option J: Both P and Y rise. That's possible, but only if AD shifts more than SRAS. But the question says both increase. So perhaps the outcome could be that both rise, but could it also be that one rises and the other falls? Not in the short run. So, if both AD and SRAS increase, does the equilibrium have both rising?

Wait, the question is about the short-run. So in the short-run, SRAS is upward sloping. So when AD increases, SRAS increases as well. So the intersection point would have higher P and higher Y.

Wait, but what if SRAS increases more? Then perhaps Y increases by more than AD causes. Hmm, no, AD is in the equation: AD = Yf + (slope)(P- Pe). So if AD increases, and SRAS increases, then the new equilibrium could have higher P and Y.

But the question is about which conclusion is certain. So, if both AD and SRAS increase, then the equilibrium could have higher P and higher Y. So both rise. So the correct option would be J.

Wait, but what about the options:

Looking at the options again:

Options:

A: Both price and real GDP fall. Unlikely, because both AD and SRAS are increasing.

B: Price rises, real GDP changes uncertain. Could be, but not certain.

C: Price falls, real GDP changes uncertain. Unlikely, since SRAS is increasing.

D: Real GDP falls, change in P is uncertain. No, because SRAS increases.

E: Price rises, real GDP falls. No.

F: Price rises, real GDP unchanged. Unlikely, because SRAS shifted.

G: Price falls, real GDP rises. Unlikely.

H: Both rise. Possible.

I: Real GDP rises, change in P is uncertain. No, because AD is in equilibrium.

J: Both rise. This is possible.

Wait, so the question is asking which can be said for certain.

If both AD and SRAS increase, then in the short-run equilibrium, both will have to adjust.

Because SRAS is upward sloping, the increase in SRAS will cause the equilibrium to move right along SRAS. But AD also is an increase—so the new AD could cross SRAS at a higher point.

Wait, but in the short-run, SRAS is upward sloping, meaning that as P increases, Y increases.

So, when AD increases, the economy will shift to a higher P and higher Y. Similarly, when SRAS increases, the economy will also shift to a higher P and higher Y.

But both shifts happen at the same time. So, the new equilibrium is higher in both P and Y.

So, both would rise, so J is correct.

Wait, but I think in the short run, the economy could have a lower or higher P depending on the relative shifts. But the question is about what can be said for certain.

Wait, the question is not about whether the two shifts can lead to a certain outcome, but what must be true.

So, when both AD and SRAS increase, the short-run equilibrium must be that P rises and Y rises.

So the correct answer would be J: Both the price level and real GDP rise.
</think>

When both short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) and aggregate demand (AD) increase, the short-run equilibrium shifts to the right. In the SRAS curve, an increase in SRAS causes real GDP to rise, as higher prices lead to higher quantities of goods and services. Similarly, an increase in AD causes the price level to rise, as higher demand leads to higher prices. Since both curves are upward sloping, the new equilibrium will indeed have both the price level and real GDP rising.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Both price and real GDP cannot fall.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Price rises, but real GDP is uncertain whether it rises or remains unchanged.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Price cannot fall; it must rise.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Real GDP does not necessarily fall; it could rise.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Price rises, but real GDP must rise.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Price rises, but real GDP does not remain unchanged.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Price cannot fall; it must rise.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. While both price and real GDP rise, it is not certain; they depend on the relative magnitudes of the shifts.
- **Option J**: Correct. Both the price level and real GDP rise in the short run.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Real GDP does not necessarily rise; it depends on the relative shifts.
- **Option K**: Incorrect. The question only allows one correct answer.

Thus, the correct answer is that both the price level and real GDP rise.
