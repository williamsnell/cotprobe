Question:

A radioactive isotope, which is used in diagnostic imaging, has a half-life of 6.0 hours. If a quantity of this isotope has an activity of 150 mCi when it is delivered to a hospital, how much activity will remain 24 hours after delivery? (mCi = microcuries)

Options:

A: 150 mCi
B: 9.4 mCi
C: 4.7 mCi
D: 12.5 mCi
E: 25 mCi
F: 50 mCi
G: 19 mCi
H: 75 mCi
I: 38 mCi
J: 2.3 mCi

Okay, so I've got this problem here about radioactive decay and activity. Let me think through this step by step. The question says that a radioactive isotope used in diagnostic imaging has a half-life of 6 hours. When it's delivered, the activity is 150 mCi, and I need to find out what the activity will be 24 hours later.

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows the formula for activity, which is A = A₀ * (1/2)^(t / T½). Right? Where A is the activity after time t, A₀ is the initial activity, T½ is the half-life.

Wait, wait, but I'm a bit confused about the units here. The half-life is 6 hours, and the time passed is 24 hours. So how many half-lives have passed? Let me calculate. 24 divided by 6 is 4. So four half-lives have passed.

Oh wait, so the activity would be the initial activity divided by 2 raised to the number of half-lives. So that's 150 mCi divided by 2^4. 2^4 is 16, so 150 divided by 16 is... let me calculate that. 16 times 9 is 144. 150 minus 144 is 6. So 9.375 mCi. Wait, but wait another thing. The options don't have 9.375. Oh, but option B is 9.4 mCi. Close enough. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternative approach: each half-life reduces the activity by half. So after 6 hours, it's 150 / 2 = 75 mCi. Then another 6 hours (12 total), it's 75 /2 = 37.5 mCi. Another 6 hours (18), 37.5 /2 = 18.75 mCi. Another 6 hours (24), 18.75 /2 = 9.375 mCi. Yep, that's 9.375, which rounds to 9.4 mCi. So option B.

The activity of the radioactive isotope decreases by half every 6 hours due to radioactive decay. After 24 hours (which is 4 half-lives), the activity can be calculated using the formula:

\[
A = A_0 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / T_{1/2}}
\]

Here, \(A_0 = 150 \, \text{mCi}\), \(T_{1/2} = 6 \, \text{hours}\), and \(t = 24 \, \text{hours}\). Substituting the values:

\[
A = 150 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{24 / 6} = 150 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = 150 \times \frac{1}{16} = 9.375 \, \text{mCi}
\]

This rounds to \(9.4 \, \text{mCi}\), which corresponds to option B.

**Answer:** B
