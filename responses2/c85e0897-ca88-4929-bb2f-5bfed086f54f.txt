Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about asymptotic notation, and I need to figure out which function grows the smallest as n increases. Let me think through this step by step.

The options are A through J, each with different time complexities. The question is asking for the smallest asymptotically, which probably means the one that grows the slowest as n gets large.

So, first, I should recall what each notation represents. Let's list them out:

A: O(n^2) → Quadratic growth, which is pretty fast.
B: O(sqrt(n)) → Square root growth, which is slower than linear but still increases as n increases.
C: O(1) → Constant time, doesn't grow at all.
D: O(n^1/2) → Wait, n^1/2 is the same as sqrt(n), same as option B. So D is also O(sqrt(n)).
E: O(2^n) → Exponential growth, which is way faster than any polynomial function. So E is the fastest growing here.
F: O(log n) → Logarithmic growth, which grows very slowly, like the number of bits needed to represent n in binary.
G: O(n) → Linear growth, which is better than O(n^2) but worse than O(log n)? Wait, no, wait. O(n) is better than O(n^2), but worse than O(sqrt(n)) or O(n^1/2), which is the same as sqrt(n). So G is O(n), which is better than B and D.
H: O(n log n) → This is better than O(n^2) but worse than O(n^2) itself. Wait, O(n log n) grows faster than O(n) but slower than O(n^2). So it's better than A and B but worse than D and G.
I: O(n!) → Factorial growth. I remember that factorial grows faster than any exponential function. So I is worse than E (2^n) and worse than H.

J: O(n^3) → Cubic growth, which is worse than quadratic but better than linear.

So arranging them in order of growth rate (from slowest to fastest):

C (O(1)) is the smallest. Then B and D (sqrt(n)), which are same as each other. Then F (log n), then G (n), H, J (n^3), and I (n log n).

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Let me re-express this. Let's list all the options and their growth rates from slowest to fastest.

The options are:

A: n² → grows quickly
B: sqrt(n) → slower than O(n)
C: O(1) → fastest, as it's a constant time operation.
D: O(n^½) → same as sqrt(n), same as B
E: 2^n → fastest growing
F: O(log n) → very slow
G: O(n) → better than B and D?
Wait, no. O(n) is worse than O(sqrt(n)) because n grows faster than sqrt(n). So G is n, which is worse than B and D. So, order is:

C (O(1)) is the smallest.

Then B and D (both sqrt(n)).

Then F (log n) is next.

Then comes G (n), then H (n log n), J (n^3), and I (n!) is the largest.

So the smallest asymptotically is C, which is O(1).

The smallest asymptotically grows is O(1), as it represents constant time complexity.

Answer: C
