Question:

Which statement about intestinal "brakes" and "accelerators" is FALSE?


Options:

A: Short-chain fatty acids which move from colon to caecum (reflux) promote ileo-caecal motility
B: The arrival of fiber in the colon causes an increase in motility and a switch from the "fasting" to the "feeding" pattern.
C: The arrival of lipid in the duodenum causes an immediate reduction in motility and a switch from the "fasting" to the "feeding" pattern.
D: Food in the stomach causes gastrin release, which stimulates acid secretion
E: Protein ingestion leads to immediate increase in intestinal motility
F: Gastric acid secretion inhibits small intestinal motility
G: The presence of bile in the intestine slows down motility
H: The presence of undigested food in the colon stimulates intestinal motility
I: Dietary starch is a potent stimulator of small intestinal motility because it causes insulin release from the pancreas
J: The presence of glucose in the duodenum accelerates intestinal motility

Okay, so I have this question about the intestinal "brakes" and "accelerators." Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking which statement is false. The options are A through J, each making a claim about how certain substances affect motility in the intestine.

I remember that the digestive system has different stages: the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and rectum. Each part has different functions, including promoting and inhibiting motility. I think the "brakes" slow things down, and accelerators speed them up.

Looking at option A: Short-chain fatty acids moving from colon to caecum (reflux) promote ileo-caecal motility. That sounds right. I recall that fatty acids in the colon (reflux) slow things down, promoting movement from the colon into the caecum, which is the lining of the small intestine. So this statement is correct.

Option B: Fiber in the colon increases motility and switches from fasting to feeding. Yes, fiber is a good absorber, slows digestion, but also speeds up motility. So this is correct.

Option C: Lipid in duodenum causes immediate reduction in motility and switching from fasting to feeding. Wait, I thought that lipid in the duodenum is actually a brake because it slows down. So if this statement says it's an immediate reduction, that might be false. Or maybe I'm getting the timing wrong. I'm a bit confused here.

Option D: Food in the stomach causes gastrin release, which stimulates acid secretion. Yes, I remember gastrin is a hormone that promotes the secretion of HCl, which speeds up the acid response. So this is correct.

Option E: Protein ingestion causes immediate increase in motility. Oh, right, protein breakdown releases amino acids, which can stimulate motility. So E is correct.

Option F: Gastric acid inhibits small intestinal motility. No, wait. I thought that the absorption of HCl from the stomach actually slows the small intestine. So F is the opposite of what I remember. So F is a false statement.

Wait, but let me recheck. In the stomach, HCl is produced and it's a brake. It slows the small intestine. So F says it inhibits small intestinal motility, which is incorrect. So F is a false statement. But the question is which is the FALSE statement, so if F is false, then it's an option.

Option G: Bile slows down motility. I think that's right. Bile is a slow-moving substance that can slow up the small intestine's motility. So G is correct.

Option H: Undigested food in colon stimulates motility. Yes, undigested food (like peptic ulcers) can cause a quick increase in motility. So H is correct.

Option I: Dietary starch stimulates small intestinal motility because insulin from pancreas is released. Yes, that's right. Starch is a slow-moving substance and it's a stimulator. So I is correct.

Option J: Glucose in duodenum accelerates motility. Wait, I thought that glucose slows the small intestine by promoting absorption. So if J says it accelerates, that would be incorrect. So J is a false statement.

Wait, so the question is which is false. So evaluating each statement.

The question is which is false. So possible options are F or J.

Wait, but let me reevaluate. In the stomach, HCl is produced and it's a brake. So the presence of HCl slows down the small intestine's motility. So statement F says it inhibits small intestinal motility, which is incorrect. So F is the wrong statement.

Option J says that glucose in duodenum accelerates motility. That's wrong because glucose slows the small intestine. So J is false.

Wait, but the question is which statement is false. So if both F and J are false, but the options only have one correct answer, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about F. Let me double-check. The statement F says that gastric acid inhibits small intestinal motility. So if the stomach's HCl is a brake, it slows the small intestine. So F is incorrect because it says it inhibits, which is the opposite. So F is false.

But wait, the question is about the false statement. So the options are A to J; the correct answer would be the false one.

So, the options that are false are F and J.

Wait, but the question is which statement is FALSE. So among the options, which is incorrect.

Let me go through each option one by one.

A: Correct. Fatty acids slow, promoting movement.

B: Correct. Fiber increases motility, leading to feeding.

C: Incorrect. If lipid in duodenum causes a reduction, that would be a brake, which would slow down. But the statement says it's an immediate reduction, which is a brake, but the statement says a switch from fasting to feeding. So it's correct in the result but the initial reason is wrong. Wait, no. The statement says 'immediate reduction in motility and switch to feeding.' That's correct because the presence of lipid acts as a brake, slowing down and causing a switch.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. What's the immediate effect of lipid in duodenum: it causes a reduction in motility and causes the shift to the feeding pattern (because it's a brake). So the statement C is correct.

Wait, but I thought that the presence of lipid in the duodenum is a brake, causing a reduction in motility and a switch. So statement C is correct.

Wait, so I thought that statement C was correct. But if it's the opposite, then perhaps it's a false statement.

Wait, the question is about which is false, so if statement C is correct, then that's not the answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The question is which option is false.

Re-evaluating each option:

A: Correct. Fatty acids slow, promoting movement.

B: Correct. Fiber increases motility, leading to feeding.

C: Statement says lipid causes immediate reduction and switch. So that's correct because lipid is a brake, slowing down and causing a switch. So C is correct.

Wait, but wait, I thought that in the duodenum, the presence of lipids causes a brake, which slows down. So statement C is correct. So that can't be the false option.

Hmm, perhaps I was wrong about another statement. Let me look back.

Option J: Glucose in duodenum accelerates motility. That's incorrect because glucose slows the small intestine.

So statement J is false.

So the false statements would be F and J.

But the question says which statement is FALSE. So the options are A to J, and only one is wrong.

Wait, the question says "which statement is FALSE."

Wait, but looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in option F.

Wait, in the stomach, HCl is produced. It's a brake, slowing down the small intestine, which would cause a switch from fasting to feeding. So F says it inhibits small intestinal motility. That's incorrect. So F is a false statement.

Similarly, J says that glucose in duodenum accelerates. That's incorrect, so J is also false.

Wait, but the question is asking which is false. So perhaps both F and J are false, but that's impossible because the options are single.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of the statements.

Wait, another approach: Let me list which options are correct, then find the false ones.

A: Correct. Fatty acids slow, promoting movement.

B: Correct. Fiber increases motility, switch to feeding.

C: Correct. Lipid in duodenum causes immediate reduction, switch.

D: Correct. Food in stomach causes HCl, which is a brake, so correct.

E: Correct. Protein in stomach increases motility.

F: Incorrect. It's a brake, so F is false.

G: Correct. Bile slows down, so G is correct.

H: Correct. Undigested food stimulates motility.

I: Correct. Starch stimulates small intestinal motility.

J: Incorrect. Glucose in duodenum slows, not accelerates.

So the false statements are F and J.

Wait, but the question says which is FALSE. So both F and J are incorrect. But that's not possible because each option is a single statement. So perhaps the question has one false.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in one of the statements.

Wait, let's re-examine statement F.

F says: Gastric acid secretion inhibits small intestinal motility. Is that correct?

No, because I thought that HCl in the stomach is a brake. So F is incorrect.

So F is false.

Similarly, J says glucose in duodenum accelerates. That's incorrect.

So which is the false statement?

The question presents each as a possible statement, and only one is false.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating statement F. Let me think again.

Gastric acid (HCl) is a brake. It slows the small intestine. So statement F says it inhibits motility, which would be correct only if it's a brake. But no, it's a brake, which is a slow down. So statement F is wrong because it says it inhibits. It should be a brake.

So F is a false statement.

So, the answer would be F or J. But the question is which is false.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is FALSE. So the false statements are F and J.

But the options are single-lettered. So perhaps I messed up.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about statement J again.

Statement J: The presence of glucose in the duodenum accelerates intestinal motility.

Wait, I thought that glucose slows the small intestine. So J is false.

So, now I'm a bit confused because the options are single letters. So how can only one be false? Maybe I made a mistake in one of the statements.

Wait, going back to the options, perhaps statement F is correct. Another way to think: in the stomach, HCl is a brake. So if F says it inhibits, that's incorrect.

So I think the correct answer is F and J are false. But since the question requires selecting one, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think of another approach. Perhaps statement F is the correct answer.

Wait, no, because F says it inhibits, which is the opposite of what's happening. So F is incorrect.

So the false statements are F and J. But the options can't have two. So perhaps only one is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me think again about statement J.

Statement J: The presence of glucose in the duodenum accelerates motility.

No, because glucose slows. So J is incorrect.

So the false statements are F and J. But the question has only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of the statements.

Wait, another possibility: statement G.

Statement G says the presence of bile slows down the small intestine. That's correct, because bile is a slow-moving substance that slows down motility.

So G is correct.

So the false options must be F and J.

Wait, perhaps the question is a multiple-choice where only one option is false, but I'm getting two. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the order of the statements. Let me reevaluate each statement.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about whether the presence of certain substances causes acceleration or deceleration.

Looking again:

Option F: Gastric acid (HCl) causes inhibition of small intestinal motility. So it's incorrect.

Option J: Glucose causes acceleration. So incorrect.

So both F and J are false.

But the question is which one is false. So perhaps the options have only one, but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating statement F.

Wait, another way to look: when does HCl act? It's a brake, slowing down. So statement F says it inhibits. So that's incorrect.

But maybe the question is referring to the absorption of HCl. So perhaps statement F is correct in the sense that it inhibits, but that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's summarize the options as I see them:

Which statement is false? The incorrect one.

The options are:

A: Correct.

B: Correct.

C: Correct.

D: Correct.

E: Correct.

F: Incorrect.

G: Correct.

H: Correct.

I: Correct.

J: Incorrect.

So, the false statements are F and J.

But the question only allows one option. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of them.

Alternatively, perhaps statement J is correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Wait, perhaps statement J is correct.

Wait, in the small intestine, high glucose leads to increased breakdown of proteins, which inhibits motility. So statement J is incorrect.

So both F and J are false, but that's not possible. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the other statements.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F. Let me think again.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the presence of undigested food (proteins) in the colon stimulates motility. That is correct. So H is correct.

Wait, perhaps statement J is correct. So statement J is correct.

So, what is the false statement?

Looking back, perhaps the false statement is J, not F.

Wait, but F says HCl inhibits, which is incorrect.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the false statement.

Wait, another approach: the false statement is J.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm now led to think it's J.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J because the presence of glucose in the duodenum does not accelerate, but rather slow down. So the statement J is false.

So, the options are:

Which is false: J.

So J is the false statement.

So the answer is J.

To determine which statement about intestinal "brakes" and "accelerators" is false, let us analyze each option carefully:

### Option A:  
"Short-chain fatty acids which move from colon to caecum (reflux) promote ileo-caecal motility."  
This is correct. Fatty acids in the colon slow down the small intestine, promoting movement from the colon to the caecum.  

### Option B:  
"The arrival of fiber in the colon causes an increase in motility and a switch from the "fasting" to the "feeding" pattern."  
This is correct. Fiber slows digestion by increasing motility and facilitates feeding.  

### Option C:  
"The arrival of lipid in the duodenum causes an immediate reduction in motility and a switch from the "fasting" to the "feeding" pattern."  
This is correct. Lipid in the duodenum acts as a brake, slowing down motility and causing a shift from fasting to feeding.  

### Option D:  
"Food in the stomach causes gastrin release, which stimulates acid secretion."  
This is correct. Gastrin in the stomach stimulates the secretion of HCl, an acid that speeds up motility.  

### Option E:  
"Protein ingestion leads to immediate increase in intestinal motility."  
This is correct. Protein breakdown in the stomach releases amino acids, which stimulate motility.  

### Option F:  
"The arrival of fiber in the colon causes an increase in motility and a switch from the "fasting" to the "feeding" pattern."  
This is **incorrect**. Fiber slows digestion and promotes motility, but it does not cause an increase in motility. Instead, it facilitates a switch from fasting to feeding.  

### Option G:  
"The presence of bile in the intestine slows down motility."  
This is correct. Bile is a slow-moving substance that slows down motility in the small intestine.  

### Option H:  
"The presence of undigested food in the colon stimulates intestinal motility."  
This is correct. Undigested food slows digestion by increasing motility.  

### Option I:  
" Dietary starch is a potent stimulator of small intestinal motility because it causes insulin release from the pancreas."  
This is correct. Starch slows digestion and stimulates motility by causing insulin release from the pancreas.  

### Option J:  
"The presence of glucose in the duodenum accelerates intestinal motility."  
This is **incorrect**. Glucose slows down the small intestine by promoting absorption.  

### Conclusion:  
The false statements are **F** (incorrect) and **J** (incorrect). However, since the question asks for the single false statement, **J** is the best choice as it directly contradicts the expected effect of glucose in the duodenum.
