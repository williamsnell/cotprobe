Question:

A woman sued her former employer in state court, asserting age and sex discrimination claims under both state and federal law. The woman's attorney had recently been embarrassed in court by the judge to whom the case was assigned. Wishing to avoid difficulties with the judge, the woman's attorney promptly removed the case to federal court on the basis of federal-question jurisdiction. The employer's attorney has timely moved to remand. How is the federal court likely to proceed?

Options:

A: Retain the case, because the employer's attorney did not provide sufficient reasons for remand.
B: Remand the entire case.
C: Retain the case to avoid the risk of bias and impropriety in having it proceed before a judge who has shown clear hostility toward the woman's attorney.
D: Retain the case, because the woman's attorney has a valid concern about possible bias in state court.
E: Retain the case, as federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over federal claims.
F: Retain the case, as the employer's attorney has not objected to the removal.
G: Retain the case, because it was timely removed and the woman alleges federal claims.
H: Remand the state claims but keep the federal claims.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let's take it step by step. The question involves a woman suing her former employer in state court, and she's asserting age and sex discrimination claims under both state and federal laws. Now, her attorney was in an embarrassing situation when assigned to the state court case. She then moved the case to federal court because the employer's attorney moved to remand. The question is about how the federal court is likely to proceed.

First, I need to recall the rules about federal jurisdiction. The key point here is whether the state claims are within the federal court. In the U.S., federal courts have broad jurisdiction over state court cases, but the state retains some authority over the federal court. So if the state claims are under federal law, the state might have some exceptions.

The woman's attorney moved to federal court on the grounds that the state court had some issues, possibly because of bias. She's worried about bias in state court. But federal courts generally don't review state court laws, so the state's claims aren't directly subject to federal review. So, federal courts shouldn't be remanded to handle the state claims, only the federal ones.

Now, the employer's attorney moved to remand. But federal courts are supposed to handle federal cases, so why would the employer move to remand? I think the employer's attorney might be trying to avoid the state's jurisdiction or to prevent the state court from handling the claims. But wait, in this scenario, the woman's attorney moved first, so she's challenging the state court's jurisdiction. The employer's attorney's move might be a separate issue. But the question is about how the federal court is likely to proceed.

So, the federal court's first step is to determine whether to remand. Since the state's jurisdiction isn't being challenged, the state's claims probably aren't remanded. But the federal court can still hold the case even without federal jurisdiction. However, the main issue is whether the state's claims are within the federal court's jurisdiction.

In the scenario, the woman's attorney moved to federal court, thinking the state court had some issues. Federal courts typically don't review state court cases. So, the state's claims aren't being remanded, and the federal court can hold the matter as it is. But the employer's attorney moved to remand. Do federal courts have authority to remand state cases?

Wait, I remember that federal courts can't remand state cases. They can only hold federal cases. So, the employer's attorney might be trying to avoid federal court's jurisdiction, but that's not correct. Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over federal claims. So, federal courts won't remand state cases. So, the employer's move is probably irrelevant.

Wait, but the employer's attorney moved to remand. If the employer's attorney wanted to prevent the state court from handling the issue, then the federal court would still hold the case as it's. But I think the key point is that the state's claims aren't being remanded, so the federal court can proceed with the state's claims unless the state's claims have exceptions that allow federal review.

But the question is about the federal court's likely proceeding. So, since the state's claims aren't being remanded, the federal court should proceed without remanding the state's case. So, the federal court would likely retain the case because the state's jurisdiction isn't being challenged. Wait, but the options include whether the court should remand or retain the case.

Wait, the options are: A to H. Let me look at the options again.

Option E says the federal court will retain the case because federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over federal claims. That makes sense. Because federal courts are only responsible for federal claims, so if the state's claims are under federal law, the federal court doesn't have to handle them. So, the federal court can retain the case as is because the state's claims aren't being remanded, and federal courts have jurisdiction over federal claims.

So, the correct answer should be E. But wait, another point: the employer moved to remand. But federal courts can't remand state cases. So, the employer's move is probably a red herring. They might have wanted to prevent the state court's issues, but that doesn't affect the federal court.

Wait, but the question is about the federal court's likely proceeding. The main issue is whether federal jurisdiction affects the state's claims. Since the state's claims are under federal law, federal courts don't need to handle them. So, the federal court will retain the case as it is.

So, the correct answer should be E. Retain the case because federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over federal claims.
