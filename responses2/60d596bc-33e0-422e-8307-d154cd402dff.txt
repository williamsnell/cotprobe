Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the mode of inheritance for a particular character. The setup is that a certain animal character is always transmitted from the mother to the offspring, but never from the father. I need to choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that inheritance can be from parents, but sometimes it's from the mother (female) and sometimes from the father. But wait, in some cases, like in certain animals or plants, there's something called sex-linked inheritance. I think that's when the gene is on a chromosome that isn't inherited by males. Like, in some cases, like the X chromosome, the gene is on the X, so females get it from their mother, and males get it from their father. So in that case, females would pass the gene to their sons, and males to their daughters.

But wait, the question says the character is always transmitted from the mother to the offspring but not from the father. So that would mean that the father can't pass it on. So if it's transmitted from the mother, it's probably autosomal recessive. Because for recessive traits, the homozygous state is not expressed, and the heterozygous shows the dominant trait. But when the father can't pass it on, that might suggest that the gene isn't on the X chromosome, but is instead on an autosomal (non-sex) chromosome. So the presence of the gene in the mother would mean that the offspring (males) would get it from the mother, but not from the father.

Wait, but the question says the character is never transmitted from the father. So the father cannot pass the gene to the offspring. So if the gene is on the X, then the father would pass it to the daughters, not the sons. So if the father can't pass it on, it's likely the gene isn't on the X. So the gene might be on an autosomal.

So, in autosomal recessive, both parents need to carry the gene for it to be passed to the offspring. But wait, in the question, all the offspring receive it from the mother, but not from the father. So if the father can't pass it on, that implies that the father doesn't carry the gene. But wait, the question says the character is always transmitted from the mother to the offspring. So it's always from the mother. That suggests that the father doesn't carry the gene, meaning the gene is recessive and is not on the X. So the parents don't carry it, but wait, the presence of the gene in the mother would mean that when she passes it on, the offspring (males) get it but not the father.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's break it down. If the gene is autosomal recessive, both parents must carry the gene for it to show. But if the father cannot pass it on, that suggests he doesn't have the gene. So that would mean that the father doesn't have the recessive allele. But in this scenario, the mother is always passing it on, so she must carry it. So the father can't pass it on because he doesn't have the gene. That fits with the idea of autosomal recessive.

Alternatively, could it be sex-linked? In sex-linked inheritance, the gene is on a chromosome that isn't inherited by males. For example, females have two copies of the X, and the X that is passed to sons. So if the gene is on the X, then the father doesn't pass it to the sons, but the mother does pass it to the sons. But in our case, the question says the father never transmits the gene to the offspring. So if the gene is on X, the father would pass it to his daughters. So in that case, all sons would receive it from the mother, but the father wouldn't pass it to any, which isn't the case here. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's something else. The question says the character is always transmitted from the mother, never from the father. So perhaps the gene is on an X, but the father can't pass it on because he doesn't have the gene. So the gene is on the X, but the father doesn't have it. So in that case, the mother passes it to sons, but the father doesn't. So the gene is on an X, which makes it a sex-linked recessive trait. So the parent's genotype would be X^a Y for the mother, and X^a X^b for the father (assuming a is the recessive allele and b is dominant, but wait, no—it depends on which allele is dominant). But in this scenario, the father cannot pass the Xa, so the father has X^a Y or X^a X^b?

Wait, if the father has X^a Y (so he has the recessive allele on his X), and the mother has X^a Y (so she has the same), then sons get X from mother and X from father. Wait no—males receive one X. So the mother gives X^a, the father gives X^a. So all sons would get X^a, but the father can't pass the X to sons. That doesn't fit, because the father can't pass it on. So perhaps the father doesn't have the X^a allele. So the mother's X must carry the gene, but the father doesn't. So the mother's genotype must be X^A X^a, and the father has X^A X^B, where the father can't pass the gene (so X^B is the dominant allele, so the father is X^B_). But wait, in this case, the father can't pass it on, which would require that the father doesn't have the recessive allele. So the father must carry the recessive allele? Or not.

Wait, perhaps the father can't pass it on because he doesn't have it. So the father's genotype is X^B X^B (since he doesn't have X^a). And the mother is X^a X^A. So when the father gives X^B, he can't pass X^a to sons, but the mother has X^a, which she can pass. So the sons would receive X^A from mother and X^B from father, so they get X^A X^B. If the father can't pass X^a, then this scenario isn't possible because sons would get X^a from the mother, which would be recessive. But the question states that the father never transmits the gene. So this scenario wouldn't hold unless the father doesn't have X^a.

Wait, perhaps the father has a different X chromosome. Let me think again. If the gene is on the X, the father can't pass it to sons. So in the question, the father doesn't pass the gene to the offspring. So if the father cannot pass it on, that implies the father doesn't have the gene. So the mother has the gene, and the father doesn't. So the gene is X-linked recessive. So the answer would be C: sex-linked dominant inheritance? No, because it's recessive. Or wait, C is sex-linked dominant, which would imply the gene is on X and dominant. But if the gene is recessive, and not on X, then it's autosomal.

Wait, but the question says the character is always transmitted from the mother. So the gene must be on an X. But the father can't pass it to the offspring. So perhaps the gene is on the X, but the father doesn't have the recessive allele. So the father's genotype is X^A X^B? Wait, no. Because if the father has X^A, he can't pass the recessive allele. Oh, wait, no. Let me think again. If the gene is on the X, and the father can't pass it, then he must not have the recessive allele. So the father has X^A X^B where X^A is the dominant allele (so he can pass it on), and the mother has X^a X^B (so she can pass X^a). So all sons (who get X from mother) would receive X^a, but the father doesn't have it. Wait, but the father can't pass it on. So sons would get X^a from mother and X^B from father. So they have X^a X^B. If the father is X^A X^B, then the father can only pass X^B. But that's not the case because the father can't pass it on. So perhaps in this scenario, the father doesn't have the recessive allele. So the father's genotype would be X^A X^B (if he has a dominant allele), but he can't pass the recessive allele. So in that case, the father would not pass the recessive allele to the sons, so all sons would get X^A from mother and X^B from father, making their genotype X^A X^B. But wait, if the father can't carry the recessive allele, then the father's genotype is X^A X^B, and he can only pass on X^B. So sons would get X^A from mother and X^B from father, but the father can't pass the X^a, so the sons don't get X^a. But that's not the scenario. The question says the father never transmits the gene, so the father can't pass it on. So perhaps the father doesn't have the gene, so the gene is recessive on the X. So the father can't give it to the sons. So the mother must have at least one copy of the gene to pass it to the sons. But wait, the father can't give it to the sons, so the father doesn't have the recessive allele. So the mother must have the recessive allele, so she can pass it to the sons. So what's the mode of inheritance? It's sex-linked recessive. Because the gene is on the X, and the father can't pass it to sons due to not having the recessive allele.

Wait, but the question options are:

A: Mutation

B: Codominance

C: Sex-linked dominant inheritance

D: Absence of certain genes in the father

E: Polygenic inheritance

F: Environmental influence

G: Extrachromosomal inheritance

H: Autosomal recessive inheritance

I: Inheritance from the father

J: Inheritance from the father

So the correct answer here is C: sex-linked dominant inheritance? No, wait. If the gene is recessive on the X, then it's recessive, not dominant. So the mode of inheritance is recessive, and it's on an X.

Wait, but the question says the gene is always transmitted from the mother. So what if the gene is on X, and the mother passes it to the sons, but the father cannot pass it to the sons. So the gene is recessive. So the mode is recessive, but it's on an X chromosome. So which option is that? Let me look back at the options.

Option H is Autosomal recessive inheritance. So that's a possibility. But wait, the father can't pass the gene to sons if it's on X. So in that case, the father can't pass it to sons. So the only way for the father not to pass it is if the father doesn't have the recessive allele. So the father's genotype is X^A X^B (assuming the recessive allele is A and B is dominant). So the father can only pass B to sons.

So in this scenario, the mother must carry the recessive allele, so she can pass it to the sons. So the mother's genotype is X^A X^a. The father's X is X^A X^B. So all sons receive X^a from mother and X^B from father. So their genotype is X^a X^B. Since the father can't carry the recessive allele, he can't pass it on.

Wait, but the question says the father never transmits the gene. So in this case, all sons get the gene from the mother, but not from the father. So the mode is X-linked recessive. But the options don't have X-linked recessive as an option. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

C: Sex-linked dominant inheritance: which is when the gene is on X and dominant.

D: Absence of certain genes in the father: meaning the father doesn't carry the gene.

Wait, but in the case where the gene is on X and recessive, the father can't transmit it. So the father doesn't have the recessive allele, so the gene is absent in the father. So the answer would be D: Absence of certain genes in the father. Because the father doesn't have the recessive allele.

But wait, I thought earlier that the answer is C: sex-linked recessive. But the options don't have that. The options are:

Option C: sex-linked dominant inheritance.

Option D: absence of certain genes in the father.

In the scenario where the gene is on X and recessive, the father doesn't have the recessive allele. So the father can't transmit it. So the correct conclusion is that the gene is absent in the father. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but the other options: what if the gene is autosomal recessive? Then the father could carry it, but if the father can't pass it on, perhaps he doesn't have it. But in that case, the father would have the recessive allele, so he could pass it on. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think about the options again.

If the gene is on X and recessive, the father can't pass it to sons. So the father doesn't have the recessive allele. So the father's genotype is X^A X^B (assuming B is dominant). So the father can't pass the recessive allele. So the father's absence of the recessive allele in his genotype (so can't pass on the gene) explains why he can't pass it to sons. Therefore, the gene is absent in the father. So the conclusion is that the father doesn't have the recessive allele.

So the correct answer is D: Absence of certain genes in the father.

But wait, another option is H: Autosomal recessive inheritance. But that's not correct because the gene is on X. So the correct mode of inheritance is recessive, but it's on X, not autosomal. But the options don't have an option for X-linked recessive. Let me check the options again.

Looking back:

H: Autosomal recessive inheritance.

So the issue is between H and D. Which is correct?

Because the gene isn't on the X chromosome; it's on an X chromosome, which makes it X-linked. So the correct mode of inheritance is X-linked, but the options don't have that. So the closest option is D: absence of certain genes in the father.

Wait, but what if the gene is not on X? Then the father could have it. But the question says the father can't pass the gene. So the only way that doesn't work is if the father has the gene but can't pass it on. But that doesn't happen unless the father doesn't have the recessive allele. So the gene is recessive, and the father can't pass it on because he doesn't have it.

So the answer is D: the father doesn't have the gene.

Wait, but the question says the gene is always transmitted from the mother to the offspring, but not from the father. So if the father doesn't have the gene, he can't pass it on. So the gene is not present in the father. Therefore, the mode is that the father doesn't have the recessive allele.

So the answer would be D: Absence of certain genes in the father.

Wait, but what if the gene is autosomal recessive? Then the father could carry it, but if he has the recessive allele, he might pass it on. So the question says the father never passes it on. So the father doesn't have the recessive allele, so the gene is absent in the father.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.
</think>

The question involves determining the mode of inheritance for a character that is always transmitted from the mother to the offspring but never from the father. This suggests that the gene in question is on a specific type of chromosome and that the father cannot transmit it to his offspring.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Option A: Mutation**  
   A mutation is a general term for changes in DNA, but it does not specifically describe the mode of inheritance. This option is too broad.

2. **Option B: Codominance**  
   Codominance occurs when two alleles of the same gene interact, and both are expressed simultaneously. This does not explain the specific pattern of inheritance described in the question.

3. **Option C: Sex-linked dominant inheritance**  
   Sex-linked inheritance involves genes located on non-sex chromosomes (like the X or Y chromosome). A dominant allele on the X chromosome would allow the gene to be transmitted to sons. However, the question specifies that the gene is never transmitted from the father, which implies the gene is on an X chromosome but not dominant. Thus, this option is incorrect.

4. **Option D: Absence of certain genes in the father**  
   This option fits the scenario described. If the gene is on the X chromosome and the father does not have the recessive allele (e.g., X^A X^B), he cannot transmit the gene to his sons. This matches the observation that the gene is always transmitted from the mother but never from the father.

5. **Option E: Polygenic inheritance**  
   Polygenic inheritance involves multiple alleles affecting the same trait. This does not explain the specific pattern of transmission described in the question.

6. **Option F: Environmental influence**  
   Environmental factors can influence gene expression, but they do not explain the lack of transmission from the father to the offspring in this case.

7. **Option G: Extrachromosomal inheritance**  
   Extrachromosomal inheritance refers to genes located outside the DNA of the parent chromosome. This does not apply here, as the question focuses on a specific pattern of inheritance.

8. **Option H: Autosomal recessive inheritance**  
   Autosomal recessive inheritance involves genes located on non-sex chromosomes. If the gene were autosomal recessive, the father could carry the recessive allele (e.g., X^a X^A) and pass it to his sons. However, the question specifies that the father cannot transmit the gene, which rules out this option.

9. **Option J: Inheritance from the father**  
   This option contradicts the observation that the gene is never transmitted from the father.

### Conclusion:
The gene in question is on the X chromosome and is recessive. Since the father does not have the recessive allele (e.g., X^A X^B), he cannot transmit the gene to his sons. This matches the scenario described in the question. Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Absence of certain genes in the father**.
