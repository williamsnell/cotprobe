Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optimal transactions for holding bonds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the optimal number of transactions (n) when you're holding bonds. The formula I remember is something like n = sqrt[(2*T*i)/(b)], where T is the total interest needed, i is the interest rate, and b is the transaction cost. Wait, no, maybe it's n = sqrt(2 * i * T / b). Oh right, the formula for the optimal number of transactions when considering both interest and transaction costs.

Wait, but in this case, the problem gives me some numbers. Let me see: the question says, for part a, the variables are the interest rate (i) and the cost of transactions (b). But for part b, it's more specific: $10,000 in bonds, 10% interest rate, and $5 transaction cost. So I think part a is general, and part b is a specific instance.

Wait no, the initial part (a) is a general question, and part (b) is a specific example. So I think the question is structured so that part a is the general formula, and part b is an application of that formula.

Wait, the question is actually a bit confusing. Let me read again. The question says, "a) If you are holding interest bearing bonds (Z), the interest rate is (i), and the cost of transactions is (b), what is the optimal number of transactions to make (n)..." So part a is a general question, and part b is a specific case.

But the user provided the question as part a and part b being separate. Wait, no, the way the question is presented, part a is the general scenario, and part b is a specific example. So the answer options are for a general case, but the options given are specific numbers. Wait, looking at the options, they're all numbers like 10, 8, etc. So perhaps in the initial question, part a is the formula, and the actual question is part b, which is part a's specific case.

So the user's actual question is part b: given $10,000 in bonds, 10% interest rate, $5 transaction cost, what is the optimal number of transactions.

So for part a, the general formula is n = sqrt( (2 * i * T) / b ), but wait, I'm a bit confused about the formula. Alternatively, the formula I recall is n = sqrt( (2 * i * T) / b ). Let me think: the total interest received is i * n, and the transaction cost is b * n, but wait, no, because each transaction costs b, so the total transaction cost is b * n. Wait, I think the formula is derived from the point where the interest earned equals the cost of transactions, or perhaps the optimal n is when the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost.

Wait, the optimal number of transactions is when the benefit of the next transaction equals the cost. So for each additional transaction, the interest earned from that transaction should equal the cost of that transaction. Alternatively, the formula n = sqrt( (2 * i * T) / b ), but I might be mixing up the exact coefficients.

Wait, another approach: the net gain from each transaction is (i * n) - (b * n), but that's the total gain. The optimal point is when the marginal gain equals zero. Alternatively, the total net gain should be considered. Let me think again.

The net gain per transaction would be the interest earned minus the transaction cost. But I'm not sure that's the right way to model it. Maybe it's better to model the total interest received minus the total transaction cost, and find the n that maximizes this.

Wait, perhaps the formula is n = sqrt( (2 * i * T) / b ). Let me check with some numbers. Suppose i is 10% (0.1), T is $10,000, b is $5. Then n would be sqrt( (2 * 0.1 * 10000) /5 ). Let's compute that.

2 * 0.1 is 0.2. 0.2 * 10000 = 2000. 2000 /5 = 400. sqrt(400) is 20. So n would be 20. Looking at the options, option I is 20 transactions. So the answer would be I: 20 transactions.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Another way to model this is using the formula for the optimal number of transactions when you have both a benefit and a cost. The formula is n = sqrt( (2 * i * T) / b ). Alternatively, perhaps it's n = sqrt( (2 * i * T)/b ), but sometimes the formula is written as n = sqrt(2 * i * T / b) or n = sqrt( (i*T)/(b/2) ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: if the interest earned from each transaction is i * (n), but each transaction costs b. So the total interest is i*n, and the total transaction cost is b*n. The net gain is i*n - b*n.

To find the maximum net gain, we set the derivative of the net gain with respect to n to zero. Let’s model net gain as G = (i - b) * n. The derivative of G with respect to n is i - b. Setting this to zero gives i -b =0 → n=0. But that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps that approach is incorrect because it's a linear function, and the net gain increases indefinitely as n increases, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, that suggests that my initial approach is wrong. Maybe the problem is more about the total interest and total cost, and we need to find n where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost. The marginal benefit per transaction is the interest earned from that transaction, which is i. The marginal cost is the transaction cost per transaction, which is b. So setting i = b would mean that each additional transaction costs as much as the interest it brings. So if i > b, each transaction is worth it, and you can do as many as you can afford. Wait, but that depends on how the costs scale.

Wait, perhaps the formula is based on the total interest earned being i*n, and the total cost being b*n. Wait, but that's not correct because the total cost would be b multiplied by the number of transactions, but if you do more transactions, the interest from each transaction increases. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up things.

Wait, perhaps the formula comes from considering that the interest earned per transaction is i, and the cost per transaction is b. So the optimal number of transactions is when the interest earned equals the cost, i.e., n = i / b. But that doesn't make sense because if i is higher than b, each transaction is profitable. Let's plug in the numbers from part b: i is 10%, which is 0.1, b is $5. So n = 0.1 /5 = 0.02. That's 2% of what? That seems way too low. But in reality, the formula I remember is n = sqrt(2*i*T / b ), which in this case would be sqrt(2 * 0.1 * 10000 /5 )= sqrt( (0.2 * 10000)/5 )= sqrt(2000/5)=sqrt(400)=20, which matches the earlier option. So perhaps the correct formula is n = sqrt( (2 * i * T) / b ), which gives 20.

So, given that, the answer is I: 20 transactions.

The problem involves determining the optimal number of transactions (n) for holding bonds to maximize interest received while accounting for transaction costs. The optimal number of transactions is calculated using the formula:

\[ n = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot i \cdot T}{b}} \]

where:
- \( i \) is the interest rate (10% or 0.1),
- \( T \) is the total interest needed (which is not explicitly given but can be inferred as the total value of bonds, $10,000),
- \( b \) is the transaction cost ($5).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Substitute the values into the formula**:
   \[ n = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot 0.1 \cdot 10000}{5}} \]
2. **Calculate the numerator**:
   \[ 2 \cdot 0.1 \cdot 10000 = 2000 \]
3. **Divide by the transaction cost**:
   \[ \frac{2000}{5} = 400 \]
4. **Take the square root**:
   \[ \sqrt{400} = 20 \]

### Conclusion:
The optimal number of transactions is 20, which corresponds to option **I**.
