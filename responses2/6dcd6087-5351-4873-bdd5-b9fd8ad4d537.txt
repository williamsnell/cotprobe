Alright, let me tackle this question. The topic is "autonomicconditioning," which I'm not as familiar with, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that "autonomic" refers to systems that are involved in autonomic nervous systems, which control involuntary functions like heart rate and digestion. 

Looking at the options, I need to find the correct definition. Option B says it's about voluntary muscle control. Wait, autonomic is usually about involuntary, so maybe B is a bit off. Option E talks about physical training, which I associate with behavioral therapy, not exactly autonomic conditionings. Option F is about high-altitude acclimatization, which I think is a form of environmental conditioning, not sure about autonomic. 

Option H mentions operant conditioning of autonomic responses, like heart rate and contractions. That sounds familiar. I remember that operant conditioning involves reinforcing or reinforcing behavior, and autonomic nervous systems are controlled by the brain, so this could be a form of behavioral therapy. 

Option A talks about cognitive behavioral therapy targeting conscious thoughts. But autonomic conditionings are about body functions, so A might not be correct. Option C is about learning new behaviors, which isn't exactly operant conditioning but more about behavioral changes. 

Wait, I think I read somewhere that autonomic conditioning is about the body's internal regulation, like how the heart rate adapts. So H seems right because it's about the nervous system controlling internal functions through environmental factors, fitting operant conditioning principles. 

So putting it all together, the best answer is H.
