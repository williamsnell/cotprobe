Question:

You are told that the cross-price elasticity between goods X and Y is +2.0. This means that

Options:

A: goods X and Y are independent goods.
B: goods X and Y are Giffen goods.
C: goods X and Y are luxury goods.
D: goods X and Y are substitute goods.
E: goods X and Y are Veblen goods.
F: goods X and Y are normal goods.
G: goods X and Y are inferior goods.
H: goods X and Y are perfect substitutes.
I: the demand for good X is unit elastic with respect to the price of good Y.
J: goods X and Y are complementary goods.

Okay, so I have this economics question about cross-price elasticity. Hmm, let me think. I remember that cross-price elasticity measures how the demand for one good responds to a change in the price of another good. The formula is Îµ = (% change in quantity demanded of X) / (% change in price of Y). 

The question says the cross-price elasticity between X and Y is +2.0. Wait, positive elasticity means that the two goods are substitutes, right? Because if the price of Y increases, people will buy more of X, and vice versa. So, when the price of Y goes up, X's demand goes up too. That sounds like substitutes.

Let me look at the options. Option D is substitute goods. That sounds right. What about the other options? Option A says they're independent, but I think that's not the case. If elasticity is positive, they are substitutes, not independent.

Option B is Giffen goods. Giffen goods are ones where the demand increases as the price goes up, but only because the good is a inferior. Wait, no, Giffen goods are usually when a good becomes more expensive, and its demand increases because it's a inferior good. But the elasticity would be negative, not positive. So B doesn't fit.

Option C: luxury goods. Luxury goods are typically not very responsive to price changes, but cross-price elasticity being positive implies they are substitutes. So C is probably not correct.

Option E: Veblen goods are rare and are usually high end, their demand is highly sensitive to price changes. So if V is high, cross elasticity would be high and positive. But I'm not sure if Veblen is the same as substitutes. Maybe they are, but I'm not certain. But the formula for Veblen is different, so maybe E is incorrect.

Option F: Normal goods. Normal goods have positive cross elasticity because as price goes up, quantity demanded increases. So F and G would both be related, but the question is about positive elasticity. So F is about normal, G about inferior.

Wait, what defines normal and inferior goods? Normal goods have a positive cross elasticity, meaning their demand increases when price of other good increases. Inferior goods have negative cross elasticity; as price increases, demand decreases.

So if cross elasticity is positive, goods are substitutes or income elasticities.

So looking back:

- Positive cross elasticity => substitute goods (D)
- Negative => complement
- Elasticity >1 => substitutes are strong
- Elasticity <1 => substitutes are weak

So for D, the correct answer is D: substitute goods.

The cross-price elasticity of +2.0 indicates that goods X and Y are substitute goods. This is because a positive cross-price elasticity means that the demand for X increases when the price of Y increases, suggesting that they are substitutes.
