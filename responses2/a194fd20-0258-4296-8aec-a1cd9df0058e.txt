Okay, let me try to figure out this question. So, the question is about the income elasticity of the demand for real money. Hmm, I remember that income elasticity relates the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to changes in income. But wait, this is about real money demand, so it's about how real money demand responds to changes in income.

The problem states that the income elasticity is 0.8. Oh right, the formula for income elasticity of money is usually something like EM = (ΔM/ΔY) * (Y/M), but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the income elasticity of money demand (EM) is given by EM = (dM/dY) * (Y/M), which is the same as (dM/dY) * (Y/M) = (dM/dY) * (M/Y)^(-1) )? Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the elasticity formula.

Wait, I remember that the income elasticity of money demand is usually the percentage change in real money demand divided by the percentage change in real income. So, if EM is the income elasticity, then EM = (ΔM/ΔY) * (Y/M). Oh wait, no, that's the same as the formula for price elasticity, but in terms of money demand, perhaps. Alternatively, I think the formula is EM = (d ln M / d ln Y). Or, another way: if the demand for real money is dM/Y, then the elasticity would be (dM/Y) * (Y/M), which simplifies to dM/Y * Y/M = d(M/Y)/M, so (d(M/Y)/M) = (dM/dY)*(Y - M)/M². Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the income elasticity of money demand is the same as the price elasticity of demand for money. Because the demand for money depends on income and price levels. So, money demand is M = k * Y * P, where k is a constant. Taking logs, ln M = ln k + ln Y + ln P. Differentiating both sides: (1/M) dM = (1/Y) dY + (1/P) dP. So the elasticity of M with respect to Y is (dM/dY) * (Y/M) = (1/Y) dY * (Y/M) )= (1/Y) * (M) * (dY/Y) * (1/M) ? Wait, no. Let me think again. The elasticity is (ΔM/ΔY) * (Y/M). So taking the derivative of ln M with respect to ln Y gives (dM/dY) * (Y/M) = (1/Y) dY * (Y/M) )= (1/Y) * (M) * (dY/Y). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because M is dY/Y multiplied by Y/M. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the income elasticity of money demand is the same as the price elasticity of demand for money. Because money demand is M = k * Y * P. So, if Y increases, and people hold more money, the price level must adjust so that M remains approximately constant. So the elasticity would be the same as the price elasticity, which is defined as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. So, in this case, the demand for real money is dM/dY. So, the income elasticity is (dM/dY) * (Y/M).

Wait, but more accurately, the formula for the income elasticity of demand for money (EM) is EM = (dM/dY) * (Y/M). So, EM is the percentage change in M divided by the percentage change in Y. So, if EM is 0.8, that means that a 1% increase in income leads to a 0.8% increase in real money demand.

The question says that the demand for real money appears to be increasing at a rate of 2.6% per year. So, the growth rate of real money demand is 2.6% per year.

We need to find the growth rate of real income (Y). So, using the formula for EM: EM = (dM/Y) * (Y/M) = (dM/dY) * (Y/M). So, EM = (dM/dY) * (Y/M) = (dM/dY) * (1/Y) * M / M? Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, the formula for income elasticity is EM = (d ln M / d ln Y) = (dM/M) / (dY/Y). So, that's the same as (M's growth rate) divided by (Y's growth rate) is the elasticity. So, EM = (growth rate of M) / (growth rate of Y).

Wait, no, because EM is (dM/dY) * (Y/M). So, (dM/dY) is the slope of M vs Y, which is (ΔM/ΔY). So, the growth rate of M (g(M)) is (ΔM/ΔY) * (Y/M) = (dM/dY) * (Y/M) = EM. So, ΔM/ΔY is the growth rate of M over growth rate of Y. So, the elasticity EM is (g(M) / g(Y)).

Wait, so if EM is 0.8, and the growth rate of M is 2.6%, then:

0.8 = (2.6%) / (g(Y)).

We can solve for g(Y):

g(Y) = 2.6% / 0.8 = 3.25%.

Wait, that's 3.25% per year. Looking at the options, that's option E: 3.25% Per year.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Let me go through the steps again.

Given: EM = 0.8.

The growth rate of real money demand is 2.6% per year. So, growth rate of M is 2.6%.

We have the formula: EM = (g(M) / g(Y)).

So,

0.8 = (2.6%) / g(Y)

=> g(Y) = 2.6% / 0.8 = 3.25% per year.

So, the growth rate of real income is 3.25%, which is option E.

To determine the growth rate of real income, we use the formula for income elasticity of demand for money:

\[
\text{Income Elasticity (EM)} = \frac{\text{Growth rate of real money demand}}{\text{Growth rate of real income}}
\]

Given that the income elasticity of demand for money (\( \text{EM} \)) is 0.8 and the growth rate of real money demand is 2.6% per year, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the growth rate of real income (\( g(Y) \)):

\[
g(Y) = \frac{\text{Growth rate of real money demand}}{\text{Income Elasticity}}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
g(Y) = \frac{2.6\%}{0.8} = 3.25\% \text{ per year}.
\]

Thus, the growth rate of real income is 3.25% per year, which corresponds to option E.
