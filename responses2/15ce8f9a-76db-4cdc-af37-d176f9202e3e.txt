Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

So, there are two people on an ice-covered pond. One is 100 kg, the other 50 kg. They're facing each other, and the heavier one pushes the lighter one with a force F. The question is about the forces and accelerations felt by each.

Hmm, I remember that in physics, when two objects push each other, they exert equal and opposite forces on each other. Oh wait, Newton's Third Law. Right, Newton's third law says that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. So, if person A pushes on person B with a force F, then person B pushes on person A with a force -F. But wait, maybe I should think about the signs here. Maybe the direction matters.

Wait, the problem says the heavier person pushes the lighter one with force F. So, the larger mass (100 kg) is pushing the smaller (50 kg) with F. According to Newton's third law, the lighter person would push back with a force of -F. But wait, that's the reaction force. So, the force felt by each person is F and -F. Wait, but the question says, "the force felt by the heavier person is [option]." So, the heavier person experiences a force of F? Or is it -F?

Wait, no. Wait, the heavier person is pushing the lighter with F. So, from heavier's perspective, the force F is applied, but from the lighter's perspective, it's a force of -F. Or do I have it reversed?

Wait, let me clarify. The heavier person is exerting a force F on the lighter. So, F is the force the heavier feels on their own. The lighter person would feel a force of -F on their own. Because the heavier pushes the lighter with F, so the lighter feels -F. But looking at the options, some options mention the force felt by each. Let me look at the options.

Option A: force on heavier is 2F. That doesn't seem right, because the push is F. So option A would be if the force felt by the heavier person was twice, which isn't the case.

Option E: force felt by the heavier is -2F. Also not matching.

Wait, but wait. The force is the same in magnitude but opposite in direction. So the heavier person experiences a force of F, the lighter person experiences a force of -F.

But wait, no. Let me think in terms of Newton's third law. If person A (mass 100 kg) pushes person B (50 kg) with a force F, then person B pushes back on A with a force F as well, but in the opposite direction. So, the person A feels a force F, and the person B feels a force of -F (but since forces are vectors, it's -F in the opposite direction).

Wait, but the question says, "the force felt by the heavier person is..." So the heavier person feels F, the lighter one feels -F.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the force felt by the lighter is -2F. No, because it's -F. So C is not correct.

Option F: magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person is twice that of the lighter's. Let's think about acceleration. Acceleration is force divided by mass. So, a = F/m.

So for the heavier person, F=100 kg, so a = F/100. For the lighter, a = F/50, because the force is F (but maybe considering that the lighter has a force of -F). Wait, but the actual force is F for the heavier, -F for the lighter.

Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify. The heavier person's force is F. So for the heavier, a = F/(100). For the lighter, their force is -F, so acceleration is (-F)/50 = -F/50.

Wait, but the magnitudes: a_heavier = F/(100) = 1/(100) F. a_lighter = F/(50) = 2/(100) F (since F/50 is 2 F/100). So the acceleration of the lighter is twice the acceleration of the heavier. So the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter is twice that of the heavier. So, which option matches that?

Looking at option F: "the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter." No, wait, our calculation shows that the acceleration of the heavier is 1/100 F, lighter is 2/100 F. So the heavier's a is half of the lighter's. So the magnitude of the heavier's a is half the lighter's. So the statement in option F is the opposite: it says the heavier's a is twice that of the lighter's. So option F is incorrect.

Wait, let me recheck. For the heavier, a = F/(100) = (1/100) F.

Lighter's a: F_light = F (if we consider magnitude, ignoring direction), so a_light = F/(50) = (2/100) F.

So a_heavier is (1/100) F. a_lighter is (2/100) F. So a_heavier is half of a_lighter's acceleration. So the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier is half that of the lighter. So which option says that? Option F says the magnitude of the heavier is twice that of the lighter. No, that's not correct. So option F is incorrect.

Wait, what's option F? It says "the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person." Which isn't correct, because the heavier's a is half that of the lighter.

Looking again, option F: "the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person." So F says a_heavier = 2 * a_lighter. Which can't be correct because a_heavier is 0.01 F, a_lighter is 0.02 F. So 0.01 is half of 0.02, meaning a_heavier is 0.5 a_lighter. So the magnitude of the heavier's a is half that of the lighter's. So option F is incorrect.

Which brings me to think about the options again.

Option B says the acceleration of the heavier is half that of the lighter. So that's correct because a_heavier = F/(100) and a_light = F/(50) = 2 F/(100), so a_heavier is half of a_lighter. So option B is correct.

Wait, but I'm thinking about the signs. The force F is applied by the heavier on the lighter. So the lighter person feels a force of -F (because the direction is opposite). But the question is about the force felt (which is the force on them). So the force felt by the heavier is F, the force felt by the lighter is -F.

But the options don't mention the directions, only the magnitude. So in the options, the question is about the magnitude.

Wait, the question says, "the force felt by the heavier person is..." So, the heavier person feels F, the lighter feels -F (but magnitude is F). So which option says that the magnitude of the heavier's a is half of the lighter's?

So the acceleration of the heavier is (F / 100), and the lighter's is (F / 50) = 2F/100. So a_heavier is (1/2) * a_lighter. So the magnitude of the heavier's acceleration is half of the lighter's. So in the options, looking for that.

Looking again:

Option B: "the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person will be half of the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person." Yes, that seems correct.

Option D: "the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be half of the magnitude of the heavier." That's the opposite, which is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but let's check the other options. Option D says the lighter's acceleration is half of the heavier's. Which is the opposite. So D is incorrect.

Option G: "the force felt by the lighter person is (-1/2) F." Wait, that's a force of -F/2? But the actual force felt by the lighter would be F. So G is incorrect because it's not equal to F but half.

Option H: "the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be twice the magnitude of the heavier." No, because the lighter's a is (2/100) F, and the heavier's is (1/100) F. So the lighter's a is twice that of the heavier. So option H says a_lighter is twice a_heavier. No, that's opposite. So H is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B and option D: but in the options, B and D are two separate options.

Wait, but the question is phrased as a multiple-choice with options A to F. So which option correctly describes the situation.

So, the correct answer is option B. Because the acceleration of the heavier is half that of the lighter.

Now, let's think about the options again. The problem is about the forces and accelerations. Since the heavier pushes with F, the lighter feels a force of -F. So the acceleration of the heavier is F/(100) = (1/100)F, and the acceleration of the lighter is F/(50) = (2/100)F. So the a_heavier is half of a_lighter.

So the correct statement is option B.
</think>

The problem involves two people on an ice-covered pond, with masses 100 kg and 50 kg, pushing against each other. The heavier person (100 kg) exerts a force \( F \) on the lighter person (50 kg), and according to Newton's Third Law, the lighter person exerts an equal and opposite force \( -F \) on the heavier person. 

To analyze the accelerations, use Newton's Second Law (\( a = F/m \)):
- The acceleration of the heavier person is \( a_{\text{heavier}} = F / 100 \).
- The acceleration of the lighter person is \( a_{\text{lighter}} = F / 50 = (2F) / 100 \).

Thus, the acceleration of the heavier person is half that of the lighter person. 

Now, evaluate the options:
- **A**: Incorrect. The force felt by the heavier person is not \( 2F \). The force is \( F \).
- **B**: Correct. The magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person is half that of the lighter person.
- **C**: Incorrect. The force felt by the lighter person is not \( -2F \). It is \( -F \).
- **D**: Incorrect. The magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person is twice that of the heavier person.
- **E**: Incorrect. The force felt by the heavier person is not \( -2F \). It is \( F \).
- **F**: Incorrect. The magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person is not twice that of the lighter person. It is half.
- **G**: Incorrect. The force felt by the lighter person is not \( -F/2 \). It is \( -F \).
- **H**: Incorrect. The magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person is not twice that of the heavier person. It is half.
- **I**: Incorrect. The force felt by the heavier person is not \( -F/2 \). It is \( F \).

The correct answer is **B**.
