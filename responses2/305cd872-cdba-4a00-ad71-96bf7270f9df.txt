Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question is about the reaction when ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) is heated. The reaction produces laughing gas, N2O, and water. So the reaction must be something like NH4NO3 decomposing into N2O and H2O. I think the balanced equation is NH4NO3 → N2O + 2H2O. Let me check: on the left, there's one N in NH4NO3 and three in NO3. On the right, N2O has two N, so that seems right. Each side has one N, so that's balanced. Hydrogen and oxygen: on the left, NH4NO3 has 4 H and 3 O. On the right, each H2O has 2 H, so 2 H2O gives 4 H. So yes, balanced. Then the O: NH4NO3 has 3 O, and each H2O has one O. So 2 H2O gives 2 O, bringing total O to 5 on the right. Wait, but originally, the left had 3 O. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, NH4NO3 has 3 O in the nitrate and 4 H. The right side has N2O: O=1, and 2 H2O: O=2. So total O on right is 3 (1+2). So the O is balanced. Hydrogen: left has 4 H, right has 4 (2*2). So yes, balanced. So the equation is correct.

Now the problem says that 10 grams of NH4NO3 are heated, and we need to find out how many liters of N2O are produced at STP. STP is standard temperature and pressure, which is 0°C and 1 atm. At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters.

The plan is: find the moles of NH4NO3, determine how much N2O is produced, then convert moles of N2O to liters.

First, calculate the moles of NH4NO3. The molar mass of NH4NO3: let's see, NH4+ is NH4+ which is 14 + 4(1) = 18 g/mol. N in NO3 is 14 + 3(16) = 62. So NH4NO3 is 18 + 62 = 80 g/mol. Wait, wait, let me calculate that again. NH4NO3 is NH4+ and NO3^-.

NH4+ has a molar mass of 14 (N) + 4(1) (H) = 18 g/mol. NO3^- is 14 (N) + 3(16) (O) = 62 g/mol. So NH4NO3 is 18 + 62 = 80 g/mol.

So 10 grams of NH4NO3 would be 10 / 80 = 0.125 moles.

The balanced equation is NH4NO3 → N2O + 2H2O. So the mole ratio is 1 mole of NH4NO3 produces 1 mole of N2O.

So moles of N2O produced = 0.125 mol.

At STP, 1 mole is 22.4 L. So 0.125 * 22.4 = ?

Let me calculate that. 0.125 * 22.4 = 2.8 liters.

Wait, but wait—ammonium nitrate reacting to produce N2O. Is that correct? Because sometimes when you have NH4NO3 heating, sometimes the products are N2 and O2, but maybe here it's N2O and H2O. Also, I should confirm if all the NH4NO3 is consumed into N2O.

Wait, but the balanced reaction is NH4NO3 → N2O + 2 H2O. So one mole NH4NO3 produces one mole N2O. So the moles of N2O are equal to moles of NH4NO3. So 10 grams gives 0.125 moles, so N2O is 0.125 moles.

At STP, 0.125 moles * 22.4 L/mol = 2.8 liters. So the answer should be 2.8 liters, which is option G.

Looking at the options, option G is 2.2 liters, H is 2.8. Hmm, so I think the correct answer is option G.

To determine how many liters of laughing gas (N₂O) could be collected from the decomposition of 10 grams of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) at STP, we proceed as follows:

1. **Balanced Reaction**: The decomposition reaction is  
   **NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O**.  
   From the balanced equation, 1 mole of NH₄NO₃ produces 1 mole of N₂O.

2. **Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃**:  
   - NH₄⁺: 14 (N) + 4(1) (H) = 18 g/mol.  
   - NO₃⁻: 14 (N) + 3(16) (O) = 62 g/mol.  
   Total molar mass = 18 + 62 = 80 g/mol.

3. **Moles of NH₄NO₃**:  
   Moles = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 80 g/mol = 0.125 mol.

4. **Moles of N₂O Produced**:  
   From the balanced reaction, 1 mole of NH₄NO₃ produces 1 mole of N₂O.  
   Therefore, moles of N₂O = 0.125 mol.

5. **Volume of N₂O at STP**:  
   At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L.  
   Volume = moles × 22.4 L/mol = 0.125 mol × 22.4 L/mol = 2.8 L.

6. **Answer Selection**:  
   The calculated volume of N₂O is 2.8 L, which corresponds to option **G**.
