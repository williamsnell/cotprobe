Question:

An investor owned a building in a city. This was the only piece of real estate that the investor owned. The three-story building had a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two floors. The investor entered into a leasehold agreement with a tenant, who would lease the first floor, where she planned to open a sporting goods store. After identifying the parties, the operative words of the lease were as follows: "Landlord hereby agrees to lease for the three years the first floor of his building in the city to tenant, reserving unto said landlord annual rental in the sum of $12,000 payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. "After the tenant took possession and the investor accepted her rent payment for the first floor of the building, which of the following most accurately describes the legal relationship between the parties?

Options:

A: A joint tenancy was created.
B: The tenant became the freeholder of the property.
C: The tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term.
D: The tenant became a subtenant of the investor.
E: A tenancy at sufferance was created.
F: A periodic tenancy from month-to-month was created.
G: The tenant's three-year term became a periodic tenancy.
H: A tenancy at will was created.
I: A periodic tenancy from year-to-year was created.

Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, the question is about real estate law, specifically about the tenancy in common or tenancy in common law. Let me break it down.

The scenario is that an investor owns a building and has a lease with a tenant. The building is three stories: ground floor has a store, and the other two floors have apartments. The lease says the landlord is leasing the first floor to the tenant. The lease terms are that the tenant will occupy the first floor, and the landlord is paying $12k annually as rent, in monthly installments of $1k. 

Now, after the tenant takes possession and the landlord pays the first month's rent, the question is about the legal relationship between the parties.

The options are A to I, each describing a different type of tenancy. I need to figure out which one applies here.

Let me think about the basics. A lease in real estate can be a tenancy in common, tenancy in common law, or maybe a tenancy in subletting. But in this case, it's a lease where the landlord is leasing an entire floor to the tenant.

In real property law, a lease that allows the landlord to sublet an entire floor is called a tenancy in common. Wait, but sometimes it's referred to as a tenancy in common law because it's between two parties. Alternatively, maybe it's a tenancy in subletting, which is a type of tenancy in common.

Wait, but in the options, option D says the tenant became a subtenant of the investor. Subtenant typically refers to a tenant who occupies the same property as the landlord, but perhaps in a different part. So, the landlord is a subtenant, and the tenant is occupying a different part. That makes sense.

But what about the month-to-month or periodic tenancy? If the landlord has a lease that allows subletting, then the lease is a tenancy in common. So, the tenant would have a tenancy in common with the landlord, which is a period of tenancy. So, the lease would be a tenancy in common, which is a periodic tenancy from month to month.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. In the original lease, the landlord is leasing the entire first floor, so the tenant occupies one floor, and the landlord occupies the other floors. That's a subtenant arrangement. So the tenant is a subtenant of the landlord, who is the landlord of the building. So, the tenant has a tenancy in common with the landlord, but the landlord is a subtenant. So, the correct term is that the tenant is a subtenant of the landlord.

Looking back at the options, option D says the tenant became a subtenant of the investor. Wait, wait, the landlord is the one who leases the first floor. So the landlord is the tenant here. So, the tenant is the investor, and the landlord is the tenant. So, the tenant (the landlord) is the subtenant.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me clarify the roles. In real estate, the landlord is the one who owns the property and has the right to lease it to a tenant. So, the tenant is the one who occupies the first floor, and the landlord is the one who has the lease. So, the tenant is the one who took the first floor, and the landlord is the one who has the lease with the investor. So, the tenant is the subtenant of the landlord.

So, in this case, the tenant (the landlord) is occupying the first floor. The landlord is a subtenant of the landlord's landlord, which is the investor. So, the relationship is that the tenant is a subtenant of the landlord, who is the investor.

Wait, but the question is, after the tenant took possession and the landlord accepted the rent, what's the legal relationship? So, in this setup, the landlord is the tenant of the investor, and the tenant (the landlord) is the subtenant. So the tenant (the landlord) has a tenancy in common with the landlord, but the landlord is a subtenant of the landlord's landlord (the investor).

But wait, the options don't mention subtenant in that sense. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: The tenant became a subtenant of the investor.

Wait, no. The tenant is the landlord, so the landlord is a subtenant of the investor. So the tenant (the landlord) is a subtenant of the investor (the landlord). So, the correct term is that the tenant is a subtenant of the landlord, who is the investor.

But looking at the options, option D says the tenant became a subtenant of the investor. Wait, no. The tenant is the landlord, and the landlord is a subtenant of the investor. So, the subtenant is the landlord, and the tenant is the landlord. So, the tenant (the landlord) is a subtenant of the investor. So, option D is correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the tenancy in common. In a tenancy in common, the landlord and tenant both own a portion of the property. So, in this case, the landlord is leasing part of the property to the tenant. So, the tenant (the landlord) is a subtenant of the landlord, who is the tenant of the investor. So, the tenant is the subtenant of the landlord, who is the investor.

So, in this case, the tenant (the landlord) is a subtenant of the landlord, who is the investor. So the correct statement is that the tenant became a subtenant of the investor, which is option D.

Wait, but another angle. Let me think about the options. The options are about the type of tenancy.

Option A: Joint tenancy. That would be if two parties (the landlord and the tenant) each own a portion. But the landlord is the one who has the lease, and the tenant is occupying the floor. It's a tenancy in common, not a joint tenancy.

Option B: Tenant becomes the freeholder. A freeholder is someone who owns the entire property, and the others sublet. But in this case, the landlord is subletting, so the freeholder is the landlord's landlord (the investor). So the tenant (the landlord) is not a freeholder; instead, the freeholder is the landlord's landlord. So option B is incorrect.

Option C: The tenant's term became a legal three-year term. No, in a tenancy in common, each has a tenancy in common with the other, and their terms are considered part of a three-year period. So, the term is a period, not a legal term. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: Tenant became a subtenant. Yes, as I thought earlier. The tenant (the landlord) is a subtenant of the landlord (the investor). So option D.

Option E: Periodic tenancy. No, because the term is a three-year period, which is a type of tenancy in common, not periodic. Periodic tenancy is when the term is determined by the parties. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Monthly tenancy. That's not correct. Periodic tenancy is a type of tenancy in common, not monthly.

Option G: Periodic tenancy from year-to-year. No, that's same as E, not F.

Option H: Tenancy at will. That's a type of tenancy created by a court order, not something the parties created. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Periodic tenancy from year-to-year. Same as H, incorrect.

So the correct answer is option D: The tenant became a subtenant of the investor.

The question involves understanding the legal relationship between the landlord and the investor after the landlord occupies the first floor of the building and accepts the first month's rent. The lease specifies that the landlord leases the first floor to the tenant, but the landlord is also the tenant of the investor, who owns the entire building.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Option A: Joint tenancy**  
   A joint tenancy exists when two parties own a joint interest in the property. Here, the landlord and the tenant share a portion, but this is a tenancy in common, not a joint tenancy.

2. **Option B: Tenant becomes the freeholder**  
   A freeholder owns the entire property, while subletting involves subtenants. The landlord is a subtenant of the landlord (investor), not a freeholder. Thus, this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C: Tenant's term became a legal three-year term**  
   In a tenancy in common, the term is a period, not a legal term. This option is incorrect.

4. **Option D: Tenant became a subtenant of the investor**  
   The landlord is the tenant of the landlord (investor), making the landlord a subtenant. This is correct.

5. **Option E: Periodic tenancy from month-to-month**  
   A periodic tenancy is a type of tenancy in common, not a monthly tenancy. This option is incorrect.

6. **Option F: Monthly tenancy**  
   A monthly tenancy is not the case here; the term is a three-year period. This option is incorrect.

7. **Option G: Periodic tenancy from year-to-year**  
   Again, this describes a periodic tenancy, not a year-to-year term. This option is incorrect.

8. **Option H: Tenancy at will**  
   A tenancy at will is created by a court, not a creation by the parties. This option is incorrect.

9. **Option I: Periodic tenancy from year-to-year**  
   This option is the same as G and is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **D: The tenant became a subtenant of the investor**, as the landlord (tenant) is subletting the first floor, making him a subtenant of the landlord (investor).
