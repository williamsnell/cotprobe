Okay, so I've got this gas problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my gas laws, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that 750 ml of gas is at 300 torr pressure and 50°C. Then it's heated until the volume increases to 2000 ml and the pressure drops to 700 torr. We need to find the final temperature, and choose the correct option from the given choices.

Hmm, I remember the gas laws. Since the amount of gas is constant, which I think is implied here because it's a gas problem without changing the number of moles, we can use the combined gas law. The combined gas law is (P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2. Oh wait, wait, right, the formula is (P1 V1)/T1 = (P2 V2)/T2, but I have to make sure about the units.

Wait, let me get the variables right. P is pressure, V is volume, T is temperature. And all the temperatures should be in Kelvin, right? Because Celsius and Kelvin differ by 273.15.

So, initial conditions: P1 = 300 torr, V1 = 750 mL, T1 = 50°C. We need to convert T1 to Kelvin, which is 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 K.

Final conditions: P2 = 700 torr, V2 = 2000 mL, T2 is what we're looking for.

Plugging into the formula:

(300 * 750) / 323.15 = (700 * 2000) / T2.

Wait, let me write that equation again:

(P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2.

So, (300 * 750) / 323.15 = (700 * 2000) / T2.

I need to solve for T2. Let me rearrange the equation:

T2 = (700 * 2000 * 323.15) / (300 * 750).

Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

First, numerator: 700 * 2000 = 1,400,000.

Multiply that by 323.15: 1,400,000 * 323.15. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute that in parts.

Wait, but maybe I can factor some terms out to simplify. Let's see:

T2 = (700 * 2000 * 323.15) / (300 * 750).

Simplify the equation by factoring:

700 = 7 * 100; 2000 = 20 * 100; 300 = 3 * 100; 750 = 7.5 * 100.

Wait, wait, perhaps I can factor out the 100s.

So, let me factor:

700 = 7 * 100, 2000 = 20 * 100, 300 = 3*100, 750=7.5 * 100.

So, the equation becomes:

(7*100 * 20*100 * 323.15) / (3*100 * 7.5 * 100).

The 100s will cancel in numerator and denominator.

So, 7 * 20 * 323.15 / (3 * 7.5).

Compute numerator: 7 *20 = 140; 140 *323.15.

Denominator: 3 *7.5 = 22.5.

So, T2 = (140 * 323.15) / 22.5.

Let me compute 140 * 323.15.

Hmm, 140 * 300 = 42,000. 140 *23.15 = let's see. 140 *20 is 2800, 140*3.15=441. So 2800+441=3241.

So 42000 + 3241 = 45241.

So numerator is 45241; denominator is 22.5.

So T2 = 45241 / 22.5.

Let me compute that.

22.5 * 2000 = 45000. So 45241 is 2000 *22.5 =45000, plus 241.

So 2000 + (241/22.5) = 2000 + 10.6222 ≈ 2010.6222 K.

Wait, no, because 22.5 * 2010 = 2010 *22.5 = 2010*(20+2.5)= 2010*20=40200 + 2010*2.5=5025 → 40200 +5025=45225. So 2010 K would be 45225.

But our numerator is 45241. So 45241 -45225=16. So 2010 + (16/22.5) → 2010 + 0.7111 = approx 2010.7111 K.

Convert to Celsius by subtracting 273.15: 2010.7111 -273.15 = 1737.56 C.

Looking at the options: option C is 1737°C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when you're converting, it's easy to make a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation steps. Let me re-calculate the T2.

Alternative approach: Let me compute the numbers step by step.

Compute numerator: 700 * 2000 * 323.15.

700 * 2000 = 1,400,000.

Multiply by 323.15: 1,400,000 * 323.15 = let's compute 1,400,000 * 300 = 420,000,000; 1,400,000 *23.15 = ?

Wait, 1,400,000 *23 =32,200,000; 1,400,000 *0.15=210,000. So 32,200,000 +210,000= 32,410,000.

So 420,000,000 +32,410,000 = 452,410,000.

Denominator: 300 *750 = 225,000.

So T2 = (452,410,000) / (225,000).

Wait, 452,410,000 ÷ 225,000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 452410 ÷ 225.

Wait, 225 * 2000 = 450,000. So 2000 gives 450,000. 452410 -450000= 2410.

So 2410 /225 = let's compute that.

225 * 10 =2250 → 2410-2250=160.

So 10 + 160/225 = 10 + (32/45)= approximately 10.7111.

So 2000 +10.7111= 2010.7111 K.

Convert to Celsius: 2010.7111 -273.15 = 1737.56°C. So around 1737.56. So the options are given as J: 2000, F: 2250, C: 1737, etc.

So the closest is option C:1737°C. But wait, I should check if I made a calculation mistake somewhere.

Wait, another approach: cross-multiply the combined gas law.

(P1 V1)/T1 = (P2 V2)/T2.

So, T2 = (P2 V2 T1) / (P1 V1).

Plugging in the numbers:

T2 = (700 torr * 2000 mL * 323.15 K) / (300 torr * 750 mL).

Wait, but torr units would cancel, as would mL.

So, compute numerator: 700 * 2000 *323.15.

Denominator: 300 *750.

Compute numerator: 700 *2000 = 1,400,000. 1,400,000 *323.15 = same as before 452,410,000.

Denominator: 300 *750=225,000.

So T2= 452,410,000 /225,000 = 2010.7111 K → 1737.56°C.

So the correct answer is option C: 1737°C.

To solve the problem, we use the combined gas law:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}
\]

### Given:
- \( P_1 = 300 \, \text{torr} \), \( V_1 = 750 \, \text{mL} \), \( T_1 = 50^\circ \text{C} \) (converted to \( 323.15 \, \text{K} \)).
- \( P_2 = 700 \, \text{torr} \), \( V_2 = 2000 \, \text{mL} \), \( T_2 \) (to be determined).

### Rearranging for \( T_2 \):
\[
T_2 = \frac{P_2 V_2 T_1}{P_1 V_1}
\]

### Substituting values:
\[
T_2 = \frac{700 \cdot 2000 \cdot 323.15}{300 \cdot 750}
\]

### Simplifying:
1. **Numerator**: \( 700 \cdot 2000 = 1,400,000 \), then \( 1,400,000 \cdot 323.15 = 452,410,000 \).
2. **Denominator**: \( 300 \cdot 750 = 225,000 \).
3. **Calculate \( T_2 \)**:
\[
T_2 = \frac{452,410,000}{225,000} = 2010.7111 \, \text{K}
\]

### Convert to Celsius:
\[
T_2 = 2010.7111 - 273.15 = 1737.56^\circ \text{C}
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest option is **1737°C**.
