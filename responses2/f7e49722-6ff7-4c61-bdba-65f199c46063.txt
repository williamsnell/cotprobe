Question:

A new severe respiratory illness caused by a newly identified virus is discovered. Which of the following properties of a killed vaccine relative to a live vaccine is the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness?

Options:

A: Is more likely to provide sterilizing immunity
B: Can be administered in higher doses
C: Develops more rapid protective immunity
D: Is less likely to require subsequent boosters for lifelong immunity
E: Is less likely to cause an allergic reaction
F: Is more effective for immunocompromised individuals
G: Is most likely to generate mucosal immunity
H: Is less likely to cause local adverse reactions at the site of injection
I: Avoids the concern for reversion to virulence
J: Is less likely to be affected by preexisting antibodies

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about vaccines and their properties. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question is about why a killed vaccine is developed for a new severe respiratory illness. The options are A to J, each talking about different properties of the killed vaccine relative to the live one.

First, I need to understand what a killed vaccine does. I remember that a killed vaccine is the same as a substitute vaccine used in emergencies, like a flu shot or COVID vaccine. It's designed to be used when the live vaccine is no longer effective or available.

Now, the question is asking about the most appropriate property of a killed vaccine relative to a live vaccine. So, I need to think about what makes a killed vaccine suitable.

Let me look at each option:

A: Is more likely to provide sterilizing immunity. Sterilizing immunity would mean the virus can't be killed by the immune system. I think that's more relevant for vaccines that target specific pathogens, like those used for a specific illness. So, maybe this is about specific immunity.

B: Can be administered in higher doses. I'm not sure why higher doses would be preferred. Maybe it's for effectiveness, but why would a killed vaccine need higher doses? I'm not sure, but perhaps it's more about the strength rather than the reason.

C: Develops more rapid protective immunity. Rapid protective immunity would mean the body reacts quickly to the infection. I'm not sure if killed vaccines have this advantage, but I think live vaccines sometimes need boosting, and killing them might make them more effective perhaps.

D: Is less likely to require subsequent boosters for lifelong immunity. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. A killed vaccine is usually given once, and then you don't need to get boosted again. But live vaccines require multiple boosts. So if the killed vaccine can be used once, then D might be correct. But how does that relate to the question?

Wait, the question is about why a killed vaccine is developed. So the reason is about why it's used instead of another vaccine. The question is which property of the killed vaccine makes it the most appropriate. So, maybe it's about the reasons for using it.

Let me think about the reasons why a killed vaccine is used. I think some properties are about whether the vaccine can be used in emergencies, why it's more effective, or why it's less likely to require reboosts.

Another thought: some vaccines are designed to be effective at very high doses. So option B about higher doses. Like, you just give it once and it's effective. That might be a selling point because you don't have to take it repeatedly.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes higher doses are used because they're more effective, but more doses may be worse if the immune system is working well.

Wait, but the question is about the properties of the killed vaccine relative to a live one. So, the reason for using a killed vaccine might be about whether it's more likely to provide specific immunity or whether it's less likely to require reboosts.

I read somewhere that live vaccines require multiple boosts because the immune response can wane, but once the vaccine is killed, you don't need to boost again. That would mean option D is correct because it's less likely to require subsequent boosters.

But wait, why is that? Because a killed vaccine is targeted to the specific pathogen, so it's already specific. So, you don't need to get the same immune response again. That's why option D is correct because it's less likely to require boosters.

Looking back at the options, D says "Is less likely to require subsequent boosters for lifelong immunity." That makes sense because after being given the killed vaccine once, you don't need to get another one. So, the reason is about the effectiveness in emergencies, perhaps.

Another thought: Option A is about providing sterilizing immunity, which is specific. But why would you want a killed vaccine to have that? Maybe that's more about the method of making it (like using specific proteins), not the reason why it's developed.

Option E is about being less likely to cause adverse reactions. That's a benefit, but the question is about the rationale for developing it, not the benefits.

Option J is about not being affected by preexisting antibodies. So, if the person has some immunity from another illness, the killed vaccine might not cause an allergic reaction. That's another benefit, but the question is about the rationale for developing it.

So, the question is about the reason why a killed vaccine is used. The reason is that it's less likely to require subsequent boosters because once you've been given it, you don't need to get another one. So, the correct answer would be D.
</think>

The correct answer is **D: Is less likely to require subsequent boosters for lifelong immunity**. 

A killed vaccine is designed to be effective and specific, providing immediate protection against the specific pathogen. Once administered, it does not require subsequent boosts to maintain lifelong immunity, making it less likely to necessitate reboosts. This property aligns with the purpose of a killed vaccine, which is to be used in emergencies and avoid the need for repeated immunization, thus minimizing the risk of reversion to virulence and ensuring effectiveness in rapidly changing conditions.
