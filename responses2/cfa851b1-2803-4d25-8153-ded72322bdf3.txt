Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the acrosome and cortical reactions during fertilization. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the options correctly describes what happens immediately after fertilization. The options are A through J, each presenting a different scenario.

First, I remember that during the formation of an embryo, before fertilization, the zygote enters the endoplasmic reticulum (acrosome) and forms a membrane. Then, the egg (cortical) membrane forms. This is known as the acrosome and cortical reaction. So, I think this part is correct. 

Now, the options that involve acrosome and cortical reactions are A (zygote doesn't divide) and E (zygote begins to divide normally). The acrosome and cortical reaction is a phase before fertilization. So, the answer can't be A or E because those are the phases that happen before fertilization. So options A and E are not the correct ones.

Looking at the options, A says the zygote doesn't divide into two embryos, producing twins. That's what happens during the acrosome and cortical reaction, isn't it? Wait, but the acrosome and cortical reaction is part of the early stages before fertilization. So, the immediate reaction after fertilization (like the first division) would be when the zygote splits into two (zygotes) and each splits into eggs. So the acrosome and cortical reaction is the phase that occurs before fertilization.

So, the options that involve this reaction are A and E. But the question is about the immediate reaction after fertilization. After fertilization, the zygote divides. So the first division is when the zygote divides into two, which are the two eggs. So the immediate reaction after fertilization would be the splitting of the zygote into two.

Looking at the options, which one reflects that? Let me check the options again.

Option A: The zygote won't divide into two embryos, producing twins. So this is what happens during the acrosome and cortical reaction. The acrosome and cortical reaction is the initial stage, not the immediate division after fertilization. So the immediate division after fertilization would mean the zygote splits into two, so the correct option would be an option that says the zygote divides.

Looking at the options, option E says the zygote will begin to divide normally. Well, the acrosome and cortical reaction is part of that process. But the immediate reaction after fertilization is the first division. So E is correct, but wait, the acrosome and cortical reaction (A) is part of that, not the immediate reaction.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The acrosome and cortical reaction is the initial stage when the zygote enters the nucleus and becomes a single cell. Then, the next stage (like the acrosome) is when the cell undergoes division. Oh wait, the acrosome is a phase that occurs prior to the actual division. So the acrosome and cortical reaction is the first phase, before the cell starts dividing.

So after the acrosome and cortical reaction, the cell will start dividing. So the immediate reaction after fertilization would be the division of the zygote into two. So the options should reflect that.

Looking at the options:

A) The zygote won't divide into two embryos, producing twins. That's the acrosome and cortical reaction, not the immediate division.

E) The zygote will begin to divide normally. That's correct because the acrosome and cortical reaction is the initial stage, followed by cell division. So the immediate division after fertilization is the splitting of the zygote.

So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but option E says the zygote begins to divide. That's the correct immediate reaction after fertilization. Because after fertilization, the zygote (which is a single cell) will divide. So the correct option is E, but let me think again.

Wait, the acrosome and cortical reaction is the initial phase. So what comes after that is the actual division. So during the acrosome and cortical reaction, the cell enters the nucleus and undergoes some structural changes. Then, the actual cell division starts, leading to the first split into two zygotes. So the immediate reaction after fertilization is the division of the zygote.

So the correct option is E: The zygote will begin to divide normally. Because that's the first step after fertilization. The acrosome and cortical reaction is part of the process leading up to the division.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an option that says the cell starts dividing. Option E says the zygote will begin to divide, which is correct.

Wait, but another thought: option E might not be correct because the acrosome and cortical reaction is the initial phase, and the actual division is the next step. So after fertilization, the cell begins to divide, but that division is not immediately, it's the result of the acrosome and cortical reaction.

Alternatively, considering the question's wording: "The acrosome and cortical reactions that occur immediately after fertilization ensure which of the following?"

So, the acrosome and cortical reaction is a phase that happens before the cell starts dividing. So the immediate reaction after fertilization would be the cell division. So the answer would be option E.

But wait, no. Because the acrosome and cortical reaction is the phase that occurs before cell division. So the actual division happens after that. So the immediate reaction after fertilization is the cell division.

Wait, perhaps the acrosome and cortical reaction is part of the process, but the first division is the result of the acrosome and cortical reaction leading to cell division. So the answer is E.

But looking again at the options, let's check:

E: The zygote will begin to divide normally.

Yes, that's correct. Because after the acrosome and cortical reaction, the cell begins to divide, leading to the formation of two zygotes.

So the correct answer is E.

The acrosome and cortical reaction is a phase that occurs before the actual division of the zygote. This reaction is responsible for the structural changes in the zygote, but the immediate division of the zygote into two embryos (twins) begins after this phase. The question asks which option reflects this immediate reaction after fertilization.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The zygote does divide into two embryos, producing twins, but this occurs after the acrosome and cortical reaction.
- **B**: Incorrect. The sperm must bind to the egg during the acrosome and cortical reaction.
- **C**: Incorrect. The sperm does not fertilize the egg; fertilization involves both the sperm and the egg interacting.
- **D**: Incorrect. Multiple sperms do not fertilize the egg; only one sperm can fertilize the egg.
- **E**: Correct. The zygote begins to divide normally after the acrosome and cortical reaction.
- **F**: Incorrect. Only one sperm typically fertilizes the egg.
- **G**: Incorrect. The zygote does not divide into two embryos.
- **H**: Incorrect. The zygote does not begin to divide abnormally.
- **I**: Incorrect. Multiple sperms do not fertilize the egg.
- **J**: Incorrect. The zygote does not begin to divide.

The correct answer is **E**, as the acrosome and cortical reaction ensures the immediate division of the zygote into two embryos.
