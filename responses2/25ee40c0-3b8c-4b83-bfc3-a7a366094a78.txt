Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the cost of each order from a list of three options each. The options are labeled (a), (b), and (c), each with different quantities and prices. Then, I have to choose the correct costs from the given answer choices A through J.

Let me break this down step by step. I'm a bit nervous about this, but I'll take it slowly. So, for each order, I'll calculate the total cost.

Starting with part (a): 346 glasses at 50 cents each. Hmm, 50 cents is half a dollar, so each glass is $0.50. So, 346 times 0.50. Let me compute that. 346 * 0.50 is the same as 346 divided by 2. 346 divided by 2 is 173. So, that's $173.00. I'll write that down as the cost for part (a).

Moving on to part (b): 870 nails at 3 and a half cents each. Three and a half cents is 3.5 cents, which is $0.035 each. So, 870 multiplied by 0.035. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 870 * 0.035. Let me break it down. 870 * 0.03 is 26.10, and 870 * 0.005 is 4.35. Adding those together gives 26.10 + 4.35 = 30.45. So, the cost for part (b) is $30.45.

Now, part (c): 125 chains each costing $16.48. So, 125 multiplied by 16.48. Let me think. Breaking it down, 100 * 16.48 is 1648, and 25 * 16.48 is 412. So, 1648 + 412 = 2060. So, the cost is $2060.00.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation because 125 * 16.48. Another way is to compute 100 times 16.48, which is 1648, plus 25 times 16.48. 25 * 16 is 400, 25 * 0.48 is 12, so 400 +12= 412. So, 1648 +412 is 2060. Yes, that's correct.

So, the three costs are $173.00, $30.45, and $2060.00.

Now, looking at the answer options, I need to see which option has these three values. Let's look at option E: $200, $35, $2500. No, that's not matching.

Option F: $150, $30.45, $2060. Hmm, the first number is 150, but I calculated 173. So, no.

Option G: 180, 33.45, 1960. First value is 180, which is higher than 173. So, no.

Option H: 173, 30.45, 2060. Oh, that matches! The three numbers are 173, 30.45, and 2060. So, H should be the correct option.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are labeled A to J. Let me see: 

Option H says 173, 30.45, 2060.

Looking at the options:

Option H: $173.00, $30.45, $2,060.00.

Yes, that's what I calculated. So the correct answer is H. But wait, the options are labeled A to J, but the question says the answer must end with the letter chosen. So the correct option is H, so the letter would be H, but the options are labeled A to J. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are labeled A to J, each with three values. Let me check each one.

Option H: 173, 30.45, 2060. Yes, that's our calculated values.

Looking at the options:

Option H: $173.00, $30.45, $2,060.00. That's correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, I see that option E is $200, $35, $2500. No. Option F is 150, 30.45, 2060. So F's first number is 150, which is less than 173. So, no.

Option G is 180, 33.45, 1960. No.

Option A: 150, 33.45, 2500. No.

Option B: 173, 35, 2100. Hmm, 35? Wait, my calculation for (b) was 30.45, not 35. So no.

Option C: 150, 25.45, 2100. No, 150 is wrong.

Option D: 173, 30.45, 2500. Wait, 2500 is different from 2060. So no.

Option E: 200, 35, 2500. No, first number is 200, which is not 173.

Option F: 150, 30.45, 2060. Hmm, 150 is wrong.

Wait, the only option that matches is H: $173, $30.45, $2060. So the correct answer is option H.

Wait, but looking back, the answer options are labeled A to J. So option H is the correct one.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check:

Looking for the third option, which is $2060.00.

Which option has that? H does.

And the first two options are correct.

So yes, the correct option is H.

The correct answer is H: $173.00, $30.45, $2,060.00.
