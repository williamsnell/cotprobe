Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about supply from four firms. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question asks for the combined supply of four firms. Each firm has their own supply schedule given by an equation. I remember that supply schedules are functions where the quantity supplied depends on the price. So, each firm's supply is a function of the price P, and I need to add all these together to get the total supply.

The four supply equations are:
Q1^S = 16 + 4P
Q2^S = 5 -5P
Q3^S = 32 +8P
Q4^S =60 -10P

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I might have misread. Let me check again. Oh, right, the equations are:

Q1^S = 16 + 4P → Q1 is 16 +4P
Q2^S = 5 -5P → Q2 is 5 -5P
Q3^S =32 +8P → Q3 is 32 +8P
Q4^S =60 -10P → Q4 is 60 -10P

Wait, no, no. Wait, no, the question actually says: Q_1^S = 16 +4P, Q_2^S =5−5P, Q_3^S=32+8P, and Q_4^S=60−10P. Wait, wait, but that can't be right because the units and the equations don't fit. Because if each firm's supply is given by Q = something, adding them up would give the total. So I'll proceed.

Wait, but wait a second. The way the question is written, the supply schedules are given by these equations. So, for each firm, you have a function of P. So, to get the total supply, you sum all these individual functions.

So the total supply Q_total is Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4.

Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Normally, supply functions are functions of P, and each firm's supply is a function of P. So yes, adding them should give the total supply.

So let's compute each term.

Q1^S = 16 +4P → so that's 16 +4P per firm 1.

Q2^S =5-5P → firm 2's supply is 5 -5P.

Q3^S=32+8P → firm3:32 +8P.

Q4^S=60-10P → firm4:60 -10P.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait a minute, maybe I should check if the units are correct. Because 16 +4P implies that at a certain price, the quantity supplied is 16 plus 4 times the price. But that would mean that each firm's supply increases with price, which makes sense. But let me think about the possible values.

Wait, but wait a moment. If Q2^S is 5 -5P, that would mean that at P=0, Q2 is 5. At P=1, it's zero. But maybe the prices are positive, so that makes sense. Similarly, Q4^S is 60 -10P. So at P=6, Q4 is zero, which could be possible. But perhaps I should proceed.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the combined supply, so I should add up all the Q's.

So, let's add all four equations.

Q_total = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4
= (16 +4P) + (5−5P) + (32+8P) + (60−10P)

Now I can combine the constants and the P terms.

Constants: 16 +5 +32 +60. Let's add them: 16+5 is 21, +32 is 53, +60 is 113. So the constant term is 113.

The P terms: 4P -5P +8P -10P.

Let me compute that: 4-5 is -1, plus 8 is 7, minus 10 is -3. So the P term is -3P.

So the total supply equation would be Q_total = 113 -3P.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check what's there. Option E is 113 -3P, and option A is 113 -5P. So E is 113 -3P, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait, let's make sure I added correctly.

Wait, adding the constants: 16 +5 is 21, +32 is 53, +60 is 113. Correct.

P terms: 4 -5 is -1, +8 is 7, -10 is -3. So yes, -3P.

So the total supply is 113 -3P, which is option E.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the options include other combinations. Let me double-check the equations.

Wait, but wait, the four supply functions are:

Q1 =16 +4P,

Q2=5-5P,

Q3=32+8P,

Q4=60-10P.

Yes, adding all together gives 16+5+32+60=113 for constants, and 4P -5P +8P -10P = (4-5+8-10)P = ( (4-5) is -1, +8 is7, -10 is -3) → -3P.

So yes, Q_total=113 -3P, which is option E.

To determine the combined supply of the four firms, you sum their individual supply functions:

1. **Individual supply functions:**
   - \( Q_1^S = 16 + 4P \)
   - \( Q_2^S = 5 - 5P \)
   - \( Q_3^S = 32 + 8P \)
   - \( Q_4^S = 60 - 10P \)

2. **Combine the functions:**
   \[
   Q_{\text{total}} = Q_1^S + Q_2^S + Q_3^S + Q_4^S
   \]
   \[
   Q_{\text{total}} = (16 + 4P) + (5 - 5P) + (32 + 8P) + (60 - 10P)
   \]

3. **Simplify the expression:**
   - **Constants:** \( 16 + 5 + 32 + 60 = 113 \)
   - **P terms:** \( 4P - 5P + 8P - 10P = -3P \)

   So, the combined supply equation is:
   \[
   Q_{\text{total}} = 113 - 3P
   \]

4. **Compare with the options:**
   - Option E: \( Q_{\text{total}} = 113 - 3P \)

Thus, the correct answer is **E**.
