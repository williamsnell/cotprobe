Question:

The boolean expression a[i] == max || !(max != a[i]) can be simplified to

Options:

A: a[i] < max || a[i] > max
B: a[i] == max
C: TRUE
D: FALSE
E: a[i] <= max
F: a[i] == max || a[i] != max
G: a[i] != max
H: a[i] >= max
I: !(max != a[i])
J: !(a[i] == max)

Okay, so I've got this boolean expression to simplify. Let's see what it is. The expression is a[i] == max || !(max != a[i]). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on boolean logic, but let me think.

First, I remember that '||' stands for logical OR. So the expression is saying that either a[i] is equal to max, or it's not the case that max is not equal to a[i].

Wait, the second part is a bit tricky. The '!' is negating the condition inside. So ! (max != a[i]) is the same as (max == a[i]), right? Because if max is not equal to a[i], then the negation is that they are equal. So the entire expression becomes a[i] == max || (max == a[i]).

Wait, but that's the same as a[i] == max. Because both conditions are the same. So the entire expression is just a[i] == max.

Looking at the options, option B is a[i] == max, which matches. So I think the correct answer is B.

The expression simplifies to a[i] == max because both parts of the OR condition are logically equivalent. 

Answer: B
