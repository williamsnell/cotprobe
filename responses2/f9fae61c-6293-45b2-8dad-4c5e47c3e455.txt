Question:

While visiting at his son's home, a grandfather tripped on a toy left on the floor by his four-year- old grandson. The grandfather fell and was severely injured. The grandfather regularly visited his son's home and was aware that the grandson routinely left toys scattered about the house. The son had never warned the grandfather to look out for toys. The grandfather brought an action against his son to recover for his injuries. At trial, after the close of evidence, both the grandfather and the son have moved for judgment as a matter of law as to liability. The jurisdiction has abolished intra-family immunity and applies the traditional rules of landowner liability. What action should the court take?

Options:

A: Grant the grandfather's motion, because the son is liable as a matter of law for failing to warn about the risk of toys being left on the floor.
B: Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on premises liability.
C: Grant the son's motion, because the grandfather was aware of the risk and still chose to visit.
D: Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on strict liability.
E: Grant the son's motion, because the grandfather failed to exercise due care in avoiding the toy.
F: Deny the grandfather's motion, because the son had no duty to control the behavior of his child.
G: Grant both motions, as both parties share equal liability for the incident.
H: Grant the grandfather's motion, because the son had a duty to maintain a safe environment for visitors.
I: Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on negligence.
J: Grant the son's motion, because the son had no duty to warn that the grandson might leave toys on the floor.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about negligence and intra-family immunity. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the scenario is a grandfather who tripped on a toy left on the floor by his four-year-old grandson. The grandfather fell and was injured. He visited his son's home regularly and was aware the grandson leaves toys, but the son never warned. The grandfather is suing the son for injuries, and after closing evidence, both moved for judgment as a matter of law. The jurisdiction has abolished intra-family immunity and applies traditional landowner liability rules.

So what's intra-family immunity? From what I remember, intra-family immunity is a rule that prevents the child from proving that the parent was negligent based on their own actions. But here, the question says intra-family immunity has been abolished. So the son might be able to claim that the grandfather was negligent because he was aware of the risk and didn't act, but maybe the grandfather can still prove that the son had a duty to warn because he was a parent.

Wait, but the question is about whether the son can be found liable. The son never warned, but he's the parent here. So the traditional rule is that the parent has a duty to warn children about dangers. Like, if you leave something in a place that could be dangerous, you should be responsible. So the son would be liable. But the grandfather's claim about the son being liable as a matter of law is about intra-family immunity.

But wait, the jurisdiction has abolished intra-family immunity, so the son can't claim that the grandfather was negligent based on his actions. So the son's liability is not an intra-family immunity issue. His duty is to warn, so he's liable for negligence.

Now, the grandfather moved for judgment as a matter of law. That means he's claiming that the son was negligent because of his actions. But since intra-family immunity has been abolished, the son can't claim that. So the grandfather's motion would be granted only if he can prove the son acted without a duty to warn.

But wait, the question is whether the son should be liable under traditional rules. So if the son's action was negligent, and the traditional rule applies, then the son is liable. But the grandfather is suing for injuries, so he's trying to prove negligence.

Wait, the options are about whether the grandfather should get the motion or the son. The options are A to J. Let's look at each.

Option A: Grant the grandfather's motion, because the son is liable as a matter of law for failing to warn.

But since intra-family immunity has been abolished, the son's liability isn't based on the grandfather's actions. So the grandfather can't claim that the son was negligent. If the son is liable under traditional rules, then the grandfather's motion might be granted only if he can show the son was negligent, which he can't because intra-family immunity applies. So the grandfather can't get the motion. So option A is incorrect because the grandfather's motion would be granted only if the son was negligent, which he isn't.

Option B: Deny both motions and submit to jury based on premises liability.

If the son is liable, as he had a duty to warn, then the grandfather should get the motion, but that depends on whether the traditional rule applies. Wait, no, because the son is liable, the grandfather is trying to prove negligence, which he can't because intra-family immunity applies, so the son is liable regardless.

Wait, no, the traditional rule (landowner) applies. So the son is liable for negligence. So the grandfather's motion would be granted only if he can show the son acted in a way that was negligent, which he can't because intra-family immunity applies. So the grandfather's motion should be denied because he can't prove the son was negligent.

So option B says to deny the grandfather's motion because the son had no duty. Wait, but the son had a duty to warn, so his duty isn't about negligence, but that's a separate issue. So the issue here is whether the son is liable. If the traditional rule is applied, he is, unless the son is found negligent.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The question is what should the court do. The options are whether the grandfather should get the motion, the son, or a jury trial.

Option A: grandfather gets motion because son is liable as a matter of law for failing to warn. But since intra-family immunity is gone, the son's liability isn't based on the grandfather's actions. So the grandfather can't claim the son was negligent. So option A is wrong.

Option B: both motions denied, jury based on premises. But if the son is liable via traditional rule, then the grandfather can't get a motion because he can't prove negligence. So option B is wrong.

Option C: grant son's motion because grandfather was aware of the risk and still chose to visit. But the question says the son had no warning, and the grandfather was aware. But the traditional rule says the parent is liable for negligence. So if the son was not negligent, the grandfather can't claim. Therefore, the son's motion should be granted, but I'm not sure about this.

Wait, no, the court would probably say that the son is liable, so the grandfather's motion is denied because he can't prove the son was negligent. So option B is correct, but wait, option B is about the son having no duty, which is a different issue. The son's duty is to warn, not to control the child's behavior.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the son is liable because he had a duty to warn. But the question is about the grandfather's motion. So the grandfather is suing because he thinks that the son was negligent. But the son's duty is to warn, not to control.

So the son is liable, so the grandfather's motion would be denied.

Wait, but the question is what should the court do. So if both moved for judgment as a matter of law, what would happen?

In traditional landowner liability, the parent is liable for negligence. So if the son was negligent, the grandfather can't argue. So the motion should be denied.

So the options are:

Which option says the court should deny both motions?

Option B says "deny both motions and submit to jury based on premises liability."

Wait, but if the son is liable, then the traditional rule applies, so the son is on the hook. But the grandfather is suing for injuries, so perhaps he can argue that the son acted in a way that was negligent.

But no, intra-family immunity has been abolished, so son can't claim the grandfather's negligence. So the son is liable and the grandfather can't argue, so he should get the motion denied. But the problem is whether the son is liable.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the son is liable, so the grandfather's motion is denied. But the options are about whether the grandfather should get his motion.

Wait, the question is phrased as: the jurisdiction has abolished intra-family immunity and applies traditional rules of landowner liability. So the son is liable because he had a duty to warn. So the grandfather is suing for negligence, so he's trying to prove that the son was negligent.

But because intra-family immunity applies, the son can't claim the grandfather's negligence. So the grandfather can't argue his motion. So the son's motion should be granted.

So the options are about whether the grandfather should grant his motion. So the correct answer is that the son is liable, so the grandfather cannot argue, and his motion is denied. So which option says that?

Looking at the options again:

Option B: Deny both motions and submit to jury based on premises liability.

But the question is whether the son is liable. So if the son is liable, the grandfather's motion is denied because he can't prove the son was negligent.

But the options don't directly state that. So what is the correct choice? Let's go through each option.

Option A: Grant grandfather's motion. The son is liable as a matter of law for failing to warn. But the grandfather can't argue, as intra-family immunity applies. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: Deny both motions and submit to the jury. If the son is liable, then the grandfather's motion is denied. So the correct court would proceed to a jury trial based on premises liability, which the son is liable for.

Wait, but the question is what should the court do. So if the son is liable, the court should decide it by the jury, not grant a motion. So option B says to deny both motions, so the court would go to the jury. But the son is liable, so the court can't decide it for the grandfather. So the court would proceed to a jury based on premises liability, but the son is on the hook.

Wait, but the options are about the motion. So the grandfather is suing for injury, so he's arguing the son was negligent. But since the son is liable, the grandfather can't argue, so his motion is denied. So the court would order a jury to decide the case on the basis of traditional premises liability.

But the question is about the motion. The motion to judgment as a matter of law would be granted only if the son was found negligent, which he isn't. So the grandfather's motion is denied. So the correct option would be one that says the grandfather doesn't get the motion.

Looking back, the options:

Option B: Deny both motions and submit to the jury based on premises liability.

Option A: Grant grandfather's motion, son is liable as a matter of law for failing to warn. (Not applicable because intra family immunity applies.)

Option C: Grant son's motion because grandfather was aware of the risk and still chose to visit. (Same issue as above.)

Option D: Deny both motions and the jury based on strict liability. Strict liability is a different principle, but the question says traditional rules apply.

Option E: Grant son's motion, because the grandfather failed to exercise due care. (Again, same issue.)

Option F: Deny grandfather's motion because the son had no duty. (Again, same.)

Option G: Grant both motions as equal liability. (No, the son's duty is to warn, which is different.)

Option H: Grant grandfather's motion because son had a duty to warn. (But the son is liable, so grandfather can't argue.)

Option I: Deny both motions and jury on negligence. So this is the option that the son is liable, which is correct, but the motion is denied. But the options are about whether the grandfather gets the motion or the son.

So, the son is liable, so the grandfather can't argue, so his motion is denied. So the court would proceed to a jury trial.

So the correct answer is option B, which says to deny both motions and submit to the jury based on premises liability. Because the son is liable, the grandfather can't get his motion, so the court should go to a jury trial based on this liability.

Wait, but some people might argue that the son's duty is to warn, so the grandfather is seeking to show that the son was negligent, but since the son has a duty to warn, the grandfather can't argue. Thus, the son is liable, so the grandfather's motion is denied, and the court would proceed to a jury trial based on the son's liability.

So the correct answer would be option B.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the grandfather should grant his motion for judgment as a matter of law against his son, given that the son had a duty to warn about leaving toys on the floor. The jurisdiction has abolished intra-family immunity, applying traditional rules of landowner liability. The son was aware of the risk but failed to warn, and the grandfather is suing for injuries. The options analyze the legal implications of the facts.

The son had a duty to warn, but the jurisdiction's rule against intra-family immunity means the son cannot claim the grandfather was negligent. The traditional rule of landowner liability applies, making the son liable for negligence. This conclusion is based on the duty to warn and the absence of intra-family immunity.

Given this, the grandfather's motion to grant judgment as a matter of law would be denied because he cannot prove the son was negligent. The court should proceed to a jury trial based on the son's traditional liability for premises liability.
