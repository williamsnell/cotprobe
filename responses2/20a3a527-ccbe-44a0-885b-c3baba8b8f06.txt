Okay, so I've got this question about Silicon and Germanium. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let's try to think this through. The question is asking what type of elements they are in terms of valency. The options are from A to J, each describing different valency levels.

Wait, Silicon and Germanium are both semiconductor materials, right? I remember that silicon is commonly used in semiconductors. Oh right, because they have a band gap, similar to germanium. I think in these materials, the atoms have a valency of four. Like, each atom donates four electrons to form bonds. So, their valency is usually four, which means they're tetravalent. That would make option B the correct answer.

But wait, I should double-check. Silicon has an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d^10 4s^0, so in bonding, it donates one electron each to form bonds with three other atoms. Wait, no. Oh wait, wait. Oh no, actually, silicon is valent in a way. Each silicon atom can donate four electrons to form four covalent bonds. So yeah, tetravalent.

Germanium is similar. It's also a semiconductor and has a higher band gap than silicon, but its valency is also four. So both have a tetravalent (four valence electrons) configuration.

Looking at the options, option B is tetravalent. So the correct answer should be B, which is option B.

Wait, let me make sure about the other options. Option A says monovalent, so that's one valence. But both have four. C is octavalent, which is eight. That's too high. D is hexavalent, six. E is heptavalent, seven. F is trivalent, three. G is divalent, two. H is nonavalent, zero. J is pentavalent, five. So the only one that fits is B, tetravalent.

Silicon and Germanium are semiconductor materials with a valency of four, making them tetravalent. This corresponds to option B: tetravalent.

Answer: B
