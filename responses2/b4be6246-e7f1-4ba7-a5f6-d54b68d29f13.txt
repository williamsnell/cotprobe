Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. It says, "If we project a body upward with a speed of 1000 cm/s, how high will it rise?" And there are multiple-choice options from A to J. Hmm, wait, the options are given, but the user wants the answer in a specific format. Oh right, the user will just pick the correct letter and the last character of the response must be the letter chosen. So I need to figure out which option is correct.

Wait, but let me focus on the physics part. The question is about projectile motion. I remember that when you throw something straight up, it slows down due to gravity until it stops, then comes back down. The maximum height is the highest point it reaches. 

The formula I think I should use is the kinematic equation that relates initial velocity, acceleration, and displacement. Oh right, the equation is:

v² = u² + 2as

Where:
- v is the final velocity (at the highest point, the object stops, so v = 0)
- u is the initial velocity
- a is the acceleration (which is negative because it's acting opposite to the direction of motion, so a = -g, where g is about 980 cm/s²)
- s is the displacement, which is the height we're trying to find.

Wait, let me make sure I got the signs right. Since the acceleration is downward, it's -g. So plugging in the values:

0 = (1000 cm/s)² + 2*(-980 cm/s²)*s

Wait, no, because a is negative, so 2a is 2*(-g) = -2g. Let me re-do that.

v² = u² + 2as

0 = (1000)^2 + 2*(-980)*s

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the equation: 0 = (1000)^2 + 2*(-980)*s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, substitute the known values into the equation.

v is 0 (at the peak), u is 1000 cm/s, a is -980 cm/s² (because it's deceleration), and s is the displacement, which is the height.

So 0 = (1000)^2 + 2*(-980)*s

Let me compute (1000)^2 first. 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000 cm²/s².

So, 0 = 1,000,000 - 1960 * s

Wait, no, because 2*a is 2*(-980) = -1960. So equation becomes:

0 = 1,000,000 - 1960 s

Now, solving for s:

1960 s = 1,000,000

s = 1,000,000 / 1960

Let me compute that.

1960 goes into 1,000,000 how many times?

Well, 1960 * 500 = 980,000 (since 1960 * 500 = (2000-40)*500 = 1,000,000 - 20,000 = 980,000). So 1960 * 500 = 980,000, which is 20,000 less than 1,000,000.

So 1,000,000-980,000 = 20,000. So 20,000 divided by 1960 is approximately 10.204.

So s is 500 + 10.204 = 510.204 cm.

Looking at the options, the closest is C:510 cm or G:450 cm... Wait, wait the options are given in whole centimeters. Wait, 510 cm is option C. But wait, let me recheck my math.

Wait, 1960 * 510 would be 1960*500=980,000 and 1960*10=19,600. So 980,000 + 19,600 = 999,600. So 1960 *510 = 999,600. So 1,000,000 - 999,600 = 400. So 510 is 400 cm less than 1,000,000. So 400/1960 is approximately 0.204. So 510.204 cm. So the height is approximately 510.2 cm. So the closest option is C:510 cm.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, when you calculate the height using the formula, is there any other factor I'm missing? Oh wait, wait. I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the equation.

Wait, the correct equation is v² = u² + 2 a s. So when an object is projected upwards, it slows down due to gravity. So the acceleration a is -g (since it's acting opposite to the direction of motion). So the equation becomes:

0 = (1000)^2 + 2*(-980)*s

So, 0 = 1,000,000 - 1960 s

So 1960 s = 1,000,000.

s = 1,000,000 / 1960.

Let me compute this accurately.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 100,000 / 196.

So, 196 * 500 = 98,000. 196 * 510 = 196*(500+10) = 98,000 + 1960 = 99,960.

100,000 - 99,960 =40. So 510 + (40 / 196) = 510 + approx 0.204. So 510.204 cm.

So the height is approximately 510.2 cm. So the closest option is 510 cm. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 510 cm, but option G is 450 cm. So why would 450 be an option? Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, wait, perhaps I should have used a different acceleration. Oh wait, wait another thing: sometimes, in some formulae, g is taken as 9.8 m/s², but here in the problem, the speed is given in cm/s. So 1000 cm/s is 10 m/s. That's a crucial mistake.

Oh wait! I think I got that wrong. Oh no! Because 1000 cm/s is 10 m/s. Because 1 m = 100 cm, so 1000 cm/s = 10 m/s.

Oh, that's a mistake. So when I calculated earlier, I used g as 980 cm/s². But if g is 9.8 m/s², then it's 980 cm/s². Wait, no, wait again: 9.8 m/s² is 980 cm/s² because 1 m = 100 cm. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me reconsider. Because 1000 cm/s is 10 m/s. So the problem is expressed in cm/s, so I should use 98 cm/s² as the acceleration.

Wait no, the problem is, when I did the calculation earlier, I used g as 980 cm/s², which is correct. So 10 m/s is 1000 cm/s.

Wait, but that doesn't change the result. So 510 cm is the correct answer. So the option is C:510 cm.

But wait, the initial calculation using the correct g gives s=510.2 cm which is approximately 510 cm. So option C is 510 cm.

But looking at the options, option G is 450 cm. Wait, is there another approach?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me think again. The correct equation is v² = u² + 2 a s.

v=0, u=1000 cm/s, a is -980 cm/s².

So 0 = (1000)^2 + 2*(-980)*s.

So 0 = 1,000,000 - 1960 s.

So 1960 s = 1,000,000 → s = 1,000,000 / 1960.

As computed earlier, s ≈ 510.2 cm.

So correct answer is C:510 cm.

So the answer should be C.
</think>

To determine the height reached by a body projected upward with an initial speed of 1000 cm/s, we use the kinematic equation:

\[
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
\]

Where:
- \(v = 0\) (final velocity at the highest point),
- \(u = 1000 \, \text{cm/s}\) (initial velocity),
- \(a = -980 \, \text{cm/s}^2\) (acceleration due to gravity, negative because it acts opposite to the direction of motion),
- \(s\) is the displacement (height we want to find).

Substituting the values:

\[
0^2 = (1000)^2 + 2(-980)s
\]

\[
0 = 1,000,000 - 1960s
\]

Solving for \(s\):

\[
1960s = 1,000,000
\]

\[
s = \frac{1,000,000}{1960} \approx 510.2 \, \text{cm}
\]

The closest option to this value is **510 cm**, which corresponds to option **C**.
