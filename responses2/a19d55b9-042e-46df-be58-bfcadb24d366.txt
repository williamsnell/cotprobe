Okay, so I've got this question here about UV photons and comparing their energy to a typical bond energy. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking me to calculate the energy of one mole of UV photons with a wavelength of 300 nm and then compare it to a bond energy of 400 kJ/mol. The options are from A to J, each with a different value. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, right, the energy of a photon is calculated using the equation E = hc/λ. Oh wait, but I remember that h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. Oh, but wait, I think this equation is for a single photon. Since the question asks for a mole of them, I'll have to convert per photon to per mole, right?

First, let me jot down the given data. Wavelength λ is 300 nm. Oh wait, nm to meters is 300e-9 meters. So 300 nm is 300 * 1e-9 m. Oh, and I think I have to convert that into proper meters for the calculation.

So the Planck constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3.0e8 m/s. Oh but wait, when I calculate E for a single photon, I get energy in joules. Then, to get per mole, I need to multiply by Avogadro's number, which is 6.022e23 mol^-1.

Wait, but sometimes I see the equation written as E = (1240 eV·nm) / λ. Oh, that might be easier. Because 1240 eV·nm is hc in eV·nm units. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, but perhaps that's complicating things. Let me think which is easier.

So, using the second method: E (per photon) in eV is 1240 / λ (in nm). So for 300 nm, that's 1240 / 300 = approximately 4.133 eV per photon. Wait, 1240 divided by 300 is about 4.1333 eV. So each photon has about 4.133 eV of energy.

Wait, but the question asks for one mole of these photons. So one mole is 6.022e23 photons. So the energy per mole would be 4.133 eV * 6.022e23 photons. Let me compute that.

4.133 * 6.022e23 = approximately (4 * 6.022e23) + (0.133 * 6.022e23). Hmm, let's see. 4 * 6e23 is 2.4e24 (because 4 *6 is 24, plus 23 zeros). 0.133 *6.022e23 is approximately 0.801e23 (since 6 * 0.133 is about 0.8, so 0.8e23). So adding those: 2.4e24 + 0.8e23 = 2.48e24 eV per mole.

Wait, but 1 eV is 1000 kJ per mole (since 1 kJ is 1e3 eV). Wait no, wait. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, but 1 kJ is 1e3 J, so 1 eV = 1e3 kJ * (1e-19) = 1e-16 kJ. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait no, perhaps I should think in terms of eV to kJ/mol.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1 eV = (1.602e-19 J) * (1 kJ / 1e3 J) )= 1.602e-22 kJ. So 1 eV is 0.000000000001602 kJ. So 4.133 eV per photon is 4.133 * 0.000000000001602 kJ per photon.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to calculate in terms of kJ per mole. Let's see. E per mole is (4.133 eV/photon) * 6.022e23 photons/mol. So 4.133 * 6.022e23 eV/mol. Then, convert eV to kJ. Since 1 eV = 1e3 kJ? Wait no, wait, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, and 1 kJ = 1e3 J, so 1 eV is (1.602e-19 J) / (1e3 J/kJ) )= 1.602e-22 kJ. So 4.133 eV is 4.133 * 1.602e-22 kJ.

Wait, 4.133 * 1.602e-22 is approximately 6.625e-22 kJ per mole. So that's 6.625e-22 kJ/mol. Wait, but that seems really small. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, another way: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 4.133 eV is 4.133 * 1.602e-19 J = approx 6.625e-19 J. Then, 6.625e-19 J / (1e3 J/kJ) )= 6.625e-22 kJ. So that's the energy per mole. Wait, but I was expecting something in the order of 700-500 kJ per mole. Because the options are 200, 300, 400, 500, etc. So according to this, 6.6e-22 kJ/mol is way too small. That can't be right. I must have messed up the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I confused the exponent somewhere. Let me re-calculate that. So, 4.133 eV/photon * 6.022e23 photons/mol. So 4.133 *6.022e23 eV/mol.

What is 4 *6.022e23? 2.4088e24. 0.133 *6.022e23 is approx 8.01e22. So total is 2.4088e24 + 8.01e22 = 2.4889e24 eV/mol.

Now, converting eV to kJ. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 2.4889e24 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 2.4889e24 * 1.602e-19 J.

Let's calculate that. 2.4889e24 * 1.602e-19 = (2.4889 * 1.602) * 1e5 (since 24-19=5) → 2.4889 *1.602 is about 3.986. So 3.986e5 J/mol. Now, 1 kJ is 1e3 J, so 3.986e5 J is 398.6 kJ/mol.

Oh, so approximately 399 kJ/mol. So the energy is about 399 kJ per mole.

Looking at the options, option H is 399 kJ/mol, which matches. So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but wait, the question says to compare it with a typical single-bond energy of 400 kJ/mol. So UV photon energy is 399, which is just slightly less than 400. So the UV photon energy is slightly lower than the typical bond energy.

So the answer is H: 399 kJ/mol.

To calculate the energy of one mole of UV photons with a wavelength of 300 nm, we use the formula for the energy of a single photon:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)), \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)), and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength in meters. For \( \lambda = 300 \, \text{nm} \), we convert to meters:

\[
\lambda = 300 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 3.0 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
\]

Using the equation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), the energy of one photon is:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{3.0 \times 10^{-7}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
\]

To find the energy of one mole of photons, we multiply by Avogadro's number (\( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \)):

\[
E_{\text{mole}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-20} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 3.986 \times 10^4 \, \text{J/mol}.
\]

Converting joules to kilojoules (\( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 10^3 \, \text{J} \)):

\[
E_{\text{mole}} = 3.986 \times 10^4 \, \text{J/mol} \times 10^{-3} \, \text{kJ/J} = 398.6 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the energy of one mole of UV photons is approximately \( 399 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).

Comparing this to the typical single-bond energy of \( 400 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), the UV photons have slightly less energy than the typical bond energy.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: 399 kJ/mol**
