Okay, so I've got this problem here about depreciation using the sum-of-years' digits method. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, Bob bought a car for $10,000. The car is estimated to last 10 years with no residual value. So, the car will depreciate over 10 years, and it's fully sold at the end of that time.

The question is asking how much the car will depreciate in the seventh year. I remember that the sum-of-years' digits method is used to calculate accelerated depreciation. Unlike straight-line depreciation, which spreads the cost evenly over the useful life, this method gives more weight to older assets, which makes sense because they're more valuable.

So, the first thing I need to do is calculate the total sum of the digits for the years. Since it's 10 years, the sum would be 1+2+3+...+10. I think the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2. Let's plug that in: 10*11/2 = 55. So the sum is 55.

Now, each year's depreciation is calculated by multiplying the depreciable amount (the cost minus residual value, which is the full value here) by (n/(sum)), where n is the year. Wait, no, actually, each year's depreciation is (remaining useful years / total sum) multiplied by the depreciable cost.

Wait, let me clarify. The depreciable cost is the cost minus salvage value. Since the car has no residual value, that's $10,000 - $0 = $10,000. So each year's depreciation is based on the remaining years.

So for the first year, the depreciation would be (10 years remaining) / 55 * $10,000. That's (10/55)*10,000 = (100,000)/55 ≈ $1818.18. Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, 10/55 is 2/11, so 10,000 *10/55 = 20,000/11 ≈ $1818.18. That seems high, but given that it's the first year, maybe it's correct.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me make sure I have the formula right. The sum is 55, each year's depreciation is (remaining years) / sum * depreciable cost.

So for the first year: 10/55 * 10,000 = 10,000 * 10/55 = 1818.18...

Second year: 9/55 * 10,000 = 1636.36...

Third year: 8/55 *10,000 = 1454.55...

And so on. 

But wait, the question is about the seventh year. So let's find out how much is depreciated in the seventh year.

In the seventh year, the remaining years are 4, because 10-7+1=4? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is (n remaining) / sum, but for the seventh year, the remaining years would be 10 - (7-1) = 10-6=4? Or wait, maybe I'm getting the formula mixed up. Let me think again.

The sum of the years' digits is 55. For the first year, it's 10/55. Second is 9/55, third is 8/55, down to the 10th year being 1/55.

So for the seventh year, the numerator is 10 - (7-1) = 4? Because each year, the numerator decreases by 1. Let's think: 

Year 1: 10

Year 2:9 

Year3:8 

Year4:7 

Year5:6 

Year6:5 

Year7:4 

So yes, for the seventh year, the numerator is 4.

So the depreciation for the seventh year is (4/55)*10,000.

Let me calculate that: 4/55 = 0.072727...

Multiply by 10,000: 0.072727 * 10,000 = 727.27.

Wait, but looking at the options, H is 666.67, G is 727.27. So H is one of the options.

Wait, wait a second, did I get the formula right? Let me double-check.

Yes, the formula is: Depreciation in year n is ( (n) / sum_remaining ) * deprec_cost.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Another way: the depreciation for each year is ( (n) * deprec_cost ) / sum, where n is the year.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct formula is deprec_cost multiplied by ( (n) / sum_remaining ), where sum_remaining is the sum of the digits up to that point.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the sum of the years' digits up to the year before. For the seventh year, the sum of years up to sixth is 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21. So the numerator is 10 - (7-1) =4, denominator is 55. So 4/55.

So 4/55 is approximately 0.0727, multiplied by 10,000 is 727.27. So the seventh year's depreciation is $727.27.

Looking at the options, option G is $727.27. So that's the answer.

To determine the depreciation of Bob's car in the seventh year using the sum-of-years' digits method, we first calculate the total sum of the years' digits for 10 years: 

\[
\text{Sum of years' digits} = \frac{10 \times 11}{2} = 55
\]

Depreciation each year is calculated as:

\[
\text{Depreciation in year } n = \left( \frac{n}{\text{Sum of years' digits}} \right) \times \text{Cost}
\]

For the seventh year:

\[
\text{Depreciation} = \left( \frac{4}{55} \right) \times 10,000 = \frac{40,000}{55} \approx 727.27
\]

Thus, the car depreciates by $727.27 during the seventh year.
