Alright, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about Spitz's study on sensory deprivation and social settings. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.

So, the question is about Spitz's 1945 study. I remember that Spitz was a psychologist who did a lot of work on how people respond to deprivation. The study involved experiments where participants were deprived of sensory inputs, like touch or smell, and then observed their reactions and development.

The key here is the part about social settings. So, the study probably looked at how deprivation affects people in social situations. I think he found that deprivation can impact development in various ways, both positively and negatively.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Social deprivation has no significant impact on emotional growth. That doesn't sound right because Spitz's study did show effects, especially when it comes to social interactions.

Option B: Sensory and social deprivation enhance development. Hmm, not sure. Enhance might mean positive, but I'm not certain that both aspects together do that.

Option C: Sensory deprivation can improve problem-solving abilities. I don't think that's what he found. Problem-solving might be a different area.

Option D: Spitz's study suggests that social deprivation can lead to accelerated cognitive development. That sounds plausible. I thought he showed that deprivation can speed up learning and problem-solving, especially when it's in a social context.

Option E: Sensory and social deprivation only affect physical growth. No, because his study involved more than just physical aspects; he looked at emotional and cognitive development as well.

Option F: Only language development. That seems off, as he looked at broader aspects.

Option G: Sensory deprivation is beneficial for short periods. No, I don't think he focused on short-term benefits.

Option H: No effect on development. That's opposite of what he found.

Option I: Adverse effects on normal development. Hmm, maybe, but I think he found positive effects.

Option J: Improved social skills later in life. That's possible, but I'm not certain it's the direct conclusion of his study.

Now, putting it together. I recall that Spitz's experiments showed that deprivation can have both positive and negative effects. For instance, in a social setting, deprivation might lead to better performance in tasks or even improve social interactions. So, in a social context, maybe social deprivation does lead to better problem-solving or cognitive skills.

Looking back, option D says that social deprivation can lead to accelerated cognitive development. That aligns with what I was thinking. So, the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is:

**D: Spitz's study suggests that social deprivation can lead to accelerated cognitive development.**

**Explanation:** Spitz's study, conducted in a social setting, revealed that social deprivation can positively influence cognitive development. This finding highlights that deprivation can enhance learning and problem-solving abilities, particularly in social contexts.
