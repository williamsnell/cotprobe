Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem. Let me read through it again.

Ms. Susan Wane and Ms. Dolly Watson invested $35,000 and $20,000 respectively in a corkscrew factory. They share profits equally after each gets 8% interest on their investments. The business made $24,200 profit. I need to find out how the $24,200 is distributed between them.

Hmm, right. So the first thing I think is that each of them gets 8% interest on their investment. So I should calculate that.

Let me calculate 8% of each investment. 

For Wane: 8% of $35,000. Let's see, 8% is 0.08. So 35,000 * 0.08 = 2,800. That's Wane's share.

For Watson: 8% of $20,000. 20,000 * 0.08 = 1,600. So Watson gets $1,600 from the interest.

So together, they get 2,800 + 1,600 = $4,400 in interest.

But the total profit is $24,200. So the profit after interest would be 24,200 minus 4,400. Let me calculate that: 24,200 - 4,400 = 19,800. So the remaining $19,800 is distributed as profit.

The problem says they share the profit equally. So each of them gets half of $19,800.

So half of 19,800 is 9,900. So Wane gets $9,900 and Watson also gets $9,900.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this. Option G says both get $9,900 each. That seems right.

Wait, let me double-check. So total interest: 35k*8% + 20k*8% = 2800 + 1600 = 4400. Profit left: 24200 - 4400 = 19800. Each gets 9900. So yes, Option G is correct.
</think>

The total interest each partner receives is calculated as 8% of their respective investments. For Wane, this is $35,000 * 0.08 = $2,800, and for Watson, it's $20,000 * 0.08 = $1,600. Combined, the interest is $4,400. The remaining profit of $24,200 - $4,400 = $19,800 is split equally, resulting in $9,900 each. Both options G match this calculation.

Answer: G
