Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two ice skaters colliding and sticking together. I'm a bit rusty on my momentum and energy concepts, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

So the problem says there are two skaters on frictionless ice. The 50-kg one is moving west at 4 m/s, and the 75-kg one is moving north at 2 m/s. After the collision, they stick together. The question is about what's conserved here.

First, I remember that in collisions, momentum is generally conserved because there's no external force. But wait, the problem says frictionless ice, right? So no external forces. That means the total momentum before and after the collision should be the same. So the linear momentum is conserved.

Wait, but the options are about whether kinetic energy is conserved. Oh, right, in inelastic collisions (like this one because they stick), kinetic energy isn't conserved. But linear momentum is always conserved if no external forces act. So the system's momentum is conserved. So the kinetic energy isn't conserved.

Now, the options. Let me look at them.

Option A: Neither KE nor linear momentum conserved. But that can't be right, because linear momentum is always conserved in absence of external forces. So A's statement would be wrong because momentum is conserved.

Option B: Momentum conserved because net force is zero. Wait, no, because the net force on the system is zero because there's no external force (frictionless ice). But why would that affect momentum? Actually, the net force being zero implies that momentum is constant. So the system's momentum is conserved. So B might be correct, but wait, the option says because net force is zero. But the reasoning should be the net force is zero, so momentum is same before and after. So B is saying that because the net force is zero, the momentum is conserved. That's correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The net force is zero, so the change in momentum is zero (F_net * delta t = delta p). So yes, the momentum is conserved.

Option C: Linear momentum not conserved because net force is zero. That's incorrect. Because net force is zero, so momentum is conserved. So C is wrong.

Option D: Only kinetic energy conserved because inelastic. No, because linear momentum is conserved. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Both KE and momentum conserved because elastic. No, because it's inelastic. So E is wrong.

Option F: Momentum not conserved because net force is nonzero. No, because net force is zero. So F is incorrect.

Option G: KE conserved because collision is frictionless. No, that's not right. Because KE isn't conserved in inelastic collisions, even if it's frictionless. So G is wrong.

Option H: KE conserved because elastic. No, same reason. KE isn't conserved unless it's perfectly elastic, which it's not. So H is wrong.

Option I: Momentum conserved because net force nonzero. No, I think that's wrong. Because net force is zero, momentum is conserved.

Option J: Momentum conserved because net force nonzero. No, same as I.

Wait, wait. Let me re-examine. The problem says the collision is inelastic, so linear momentum is conserved. But wait, because they stick together, is it an inelastic collision? Yeah, so the collision is inelastic. So let me go back to the options.

Looking at the options again, which one correctly states whether momentum and KE are conserved.

The options are about what's conserved. Let me re-examine all the options.

Wait, the options are:

A: Neither KE nor linear momentum conserved.
B: Momentum conserved because net force is zero.
C: Momentum not conserved because net force is zero.
D: KE conserved because inelastic.
E: Both KE and momentum conserved because elastic.
F: Momentum not conserved because net force is nonzero.
G: KE only conserved because frictionless.
H: KE conserved because elastic.
I: Momentum conserved because net force nonzero.
J: Momentum conserved because net force nonzero.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's look at the options again.

Wait, the question is, which is true? Let's think about the conservation laws.

The skaters collide on frictionless ice, so no external forces. So momentum is conserved. The collision is inelastic, so KE is not conserved.

Wait, but what about the linear momentum? Since no external forces, the total momentum before the collision equals the total after. So linear momentum is conserved. So the system's linear momentum is conserved.

Now, the options:

Option B says: The linear momentum is conserved because the net force is zero. That's correct because net force is zero, so momentum is same before and after.

Option F says: momentum not conserved because net force is nonzero. That's wrong because net force is zero, so momentum is conserved.

So the correct options are about whether momentum is conserved.

So:

Which options are correct?

Which options state that momentum is conserved. Let's see:

Options B and F. B says net force zero, so momentum conserved. F says net force is nonzero, momentum not conserved. So F is incorrect, B is correct.

So which options are correct?

Looking at the options:

A: Neither KE nor linear momentum conserved. No because linear momentum is conserved.

B: Momentum conserved because net force zero. Correct.

C: Momentum not conserved because net force zero. No, because net force is zero, so momentum is conserved. So C is wrong.

Wait, so B is correct. So the correct answer is B or another option?

Wait, the question is which is true. So let's see the options:

Looking for what is true. So which statements are correct.

Option B: Momentum conserved because net force is zero. Correct.

Option C: Momentum not conserved because net force is zero. No, that's incorrect.

So which options are correct?

Option B is correct. So the answer would be option B.

Wait the options are A to J. The question is which is true.

Wait, let me look again at the options:

Option B: The linear momentum of the system is conserved because the net force on the system is zero.

Yes, that's correct.

Another option: Option F: momentum not conserved because net force is nonzero. No, because net force is zero, so momentum is conserved.

So the correct option is B.

The problem involves two ice skaters colliding on frictionless ice, where the 50-kg skater moves west at 4 m/s and the 75-kg skater moves north at 2 m/s. After the collision, they stick together. The task is to determine which statement about momentum and kinetic energy conservation is correct.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the ice is frictionless, there are no external forces acting on the system. According to Newton's first law, the total momentum of the system is conserved. This applies to both linear momentum and kinetic energy.

2. **Kinetic Energy**:  
   The collision is inelastic (they stick together), so kinetic energy is not conserved. This is because some kinetic energy is converted into internal energy during the collision.

3. **Options Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. Linear momentum is conserved because there are no external forces.  
   - **Option B**: Correct. Linear momentum is conserved because the net force on the system is zero (frictionless ice).  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. Linear momentum is conserved because the net force is zero.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. Linear momentum is conserved, not just kinetic energy.  
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. Both kinetic energy and linear momentum are not conserved because the collision is inelastic.  
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. Linear momentum is conserved because the net force is zero.  
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. Kinetic energy is not conserved because the collision is inelastic.  
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. Kinetic energy is not conserved because the collision is inelastic.  
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. Momentum is conserved, not because the net force is nonzero.  
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. Momentum is conserved, not because the net force is nonzero.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it accurately states that linear momentum is conserved because the net force on the system is zero.
