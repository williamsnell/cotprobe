Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these options is inadmissible to prove the insured's correct date of birth in a court setting. The options are A through J, each presenting different types of evidence. The question is multiple-choice, so I need to choose the correct one.

First, I recall that when trying to prove a date of birth, the evidence must be directly related and credible. Commonly, a birth certificate is used because it's official and has a lot of documentation backing it up. But sometimes, relying on others' recollections can be tricky. 

Looking at the options, I need to think about which of these might not be reliable or might be misused. 

Option A: A diary entry from the mother. That could be direct, but it's from a mother, which might not be as reliable as a birth certificate. But wait, a diary entry from a mother is personal and could be a way to prove the date, but it's not as professional or official as a birth certificate.

Option B: A family Bible. That's a religious document. I don't think a family Bible can be used to prove a specific date of birth because it's based on religious principles and can be interpreted differently. It's not a credible source for an official date.

Option C: A social media post celebrating the birthday. Social media can sometimes be misleading because it's not a formal document. It could be a picture, but it's not a record or proof in court.

Option D: The insured's hospital birth record. Hospital records are official, but they might be more detailed than a simple date. They might include other information like the date of birth, but I'm not sure if they are considered a direct proof. Alternatively, a birth certificate is more direct.

Option E: A driver's license. That's probably not relevant unless the date is on it, but I don't think that's a direct way to prove the date of birth. The date would be on the license plate, but unless it's the birth date, which is unlikely, it's not useful.

Option F: A photocopy of the birth certificate. That's a copy of something already established. Using a photocopy would not add new evidence; it's just a scaled version of the same document. It might be seen as a substitute, but I'm not sure if photocopying is considered inadmissible. I think it's more about the original document's authenticity than the copy itself.

Option G: A family portrait engraved with ages. This is a bit vague. If it's engraved with the ages, it might be a photo, but I don't think it's a credible way to prove a specific date of birth. It's subjective and might not hold up in court.

Option H: A letter from a childhood friend. That could be a possible source, but it's a personal letter, and unless it's from a trusted friend, it might not be reliable. It could be a way to prove the date, but I'm not certain if it's inadmissible.

Option I: A school record indicating the date of birth. This is a record, but it's from a school, which might not be a solid foundation for the date. It's more of an academic record than a personal record.

Option J: A sworn affidavit from the brother. Affidavits are statements made by someone, and while they can be used, if they're not directly tied to the date of birth, they might be inadmissible. Alternatively, if the brother is the one who knows the correct date, that could be a source, but not sure.

Now, considering each option, which one is inadmissible. The question asks which is inadmissible if offered. So, the correct answer is the option that is not credible, not supported by evidence, or is not a direct source of proof.

Family Bible (B) is not credible because it's religious. Family portraits (G) are subjective and not a direct proof. Social media (C) is unreliable. The hospital record (D) is an official document but perhaps not as direct. A photocopy (F) is a copy and not original. The school record (I) is a record but not the date. The affidavit (J) is a statement, but if it's not from a trusted source, it could be inadmissible.

Wait, but what about the mother's diary (A)? A diary entry from a mother is personal and could be a way to prove the date, but I'm not sure if it's considered inadmissible. Or is it? I think a birth certificate is more reliable because it's official and legally binding. But if the mother's diary is from an insurance company, maybe it's not directly tied to the insured. Alternatively, the insurance company might not have a record of the date.

Wait, the issue is if the evidence offered is used to prove the date of birth. The options are what's offered to prove it, so any evidence offered that doesn't directly tie to the date would be inadmissible.

So, family Bible (B) is not credible because it's religious. So if the court tries to prove the date, using a family Bible would be inadmissible as it's not a credible source.

Another option: the hospital record (D) is another possibility. But I think the birth certificate is the best option. So, the options that are not credible would include family Bible, social media, photocopy, school record, etc.

Looking at the options, option B is a family Bible. Since it's based on religious principles and not a credible source of historical data, it's inadmissible. So the answer is B.

The correct answer is B: A family Bible with the insured's birth date inscribed on the cover. This is inadmissible because a family Bible is a religious document and not credible for proving a specific date of birth. It is not a reliable source of historical data and is therefore not used as evidence in court.

Answer: B
