Okay, I'm trying to solve this pH problem. The question is about finding the pH of a 0.15 M H₂SO₄ solution, and they mentioned K₂ is 1.26×10^-2. Wait, I'm a bit confused. H₂SO₄ is a strong acid, right? But wait, wait—actually, H₂SO₄ is a strong acid in this case? Or maybe it's a weak one. Because sulfuric acid is usually a strong acid, but wait, no, wait. Wait, H₂SO₄ is a strong acid, but it's diprotic, meaning it can donate two protons. So the first dissociation is complete, and the second is partial.

Wait, but the problem says to assume K₂=1.26e-2. Hmm. Oh wait, K₂ might refer to the second dissociation step. So the first step is H₂SO₄ → 2H+ + SO₄^2-, but wait, no. Wait, in reality, H₂SO₄ is a strong acid, so the first dissociation is complete. So the second is a weak one. So in this case, the second H+ comes from a weak acid.

So H₂SO₄ → 2H+ + SO₄^2- would first get all the H+ from the first step. Then, the second step is HSO₄^- → H+ + SO₄^2-. But wait, I'm not sure. Wait, no, sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, the first H+ is completely removed, and the second H+ is only partially removed. So the second ionization is a weak acid.

Wait, so the second dissociation is HSO₄^- ↔ H+ + SO₄^2-. The Ka for the second dissociation is given as K₂=1.26e-2. So the second H+ comes from this weak acid.

But wait, wait. I think there's confusion here. Let me clarify the steps. H₂SO₄ is the starting material.

First, H₂SO₄ dissociates completely into 2 H+ and SO₄^2-. But wait, wait. No, sulfuric acid is a strong acid, so the first step, H₂SO₄ → 2 H+ + SO₄^2- is correct. Then the second step, HSO₄^- → H+ + SO₄^2- is in equilibrium with a small Ka.

But wait, the question says to assume K₂=1.26e-2. So that's the second dissociation's K. So the solution would have a certain concentration of H+ ions.

Wait, but if the first step is complete, then the concentration of H+ from the first step would be 0.3 M, because H₂SO₄ is 0.15 M and it's fully dissociated into 0.3 M H+ and 0.15 M SO₄^2-.

Wait no, wait. Wait, wait, H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete, so:

H₂SO₄ → 2H+ + SO₄^2-.

So 0.15 M H₂SO₄ would produce 0.3 M H+ and 0.15 M SO₄^2-.

Then the second dissociation is HSO₄^- → H+ + SO₄^2-.

But the second H+ comes from this equilibrium. The initial concentration of HSO₄^- is 0.15 M, because each mole of H₂SO₄ produces one mole of HSO₄^-.

Wait, let's think again. The first step: H₂SO₄ → 2H+ + SO₄^2-.

So the initial concentration is 0.15 M H₂SO₄. So the products are 0.3 M H+ and 0.15 M SO₄^2-.

But then, the second H+ comes from the dissociation of HSO4^-.

HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-.

The initial concentration of HSO4^- is 0.15 M.

Let x be the concentration of H+ produced from this step.

So, the reaction is HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-.

So initial [HSO4^-] =0.15 M, [H+] =0, [SO4^2-] =0.15 M.

At equilibrium:

[HSO4^-] =0.15 - x

[H+] = x

[SO4^2-] = 0.15 + x.

The equilibrium expression is K₂ = [H+][SO4^2-] / [HSO4^-] = (x)(0.15 +x)/(0.15 -x) =1.26e-2.

But since K₂ is relatively small (1.26e-2 is about 1.26%, so x is much smaller than 0.15, so we can approximate 0.15 +x ≈0.15 and 0.15 -x ≈0.15.

So the equation becomes:

( x * 0.15 ) / 0.15 ) = x = K₂ =1.26e-2.

So x = 0.0126 M.

Wait, but wait. Oh no, because [H+] from the first step is 0.3 M, and from the second step, it's 0.0126 M. So the total [H+] is 0.3126 M. But wait, wait, that can't be right because if H+ from first step is 0.3 M, the second can only add 0.0126, but that would make [H+] 0.3126, which is more than the first step. That's correct because the first step is completely dissociated.

Wait, no, wait, the first step is complete, so [H+] is 0.3 M. Then the second step adds some more H+.

Wait, but in that case, the total [H+] is 0.3 + 0.0126 = 0.3126 M.

But wait, no, wait, because the initial [H+] from the first step is 0.3 M, and the second step adds x, which is 0.0126. So the total [H+] is 0.3 +0.0126 =0.3126 M.

Wait, but that can’t be, because the first step is complete. Because if the first step is complete, the H+ is 0.3 M, and the second step is the only source of more H+. So the total [H+] is 0.3 + x, where x is 0.0126.

So [H+] =0.3126 M.

Then pH is -log(0.3126).

Calculating that, log(0.3126) is about -0.503. So pH is 0.503. Wait, but wait, that's about 0.50, but the options are given as 0.15, 0.30, etc.

Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me recheck the steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the first step is complete. Wait, H₂SO₄ is a strong acid, so the first dissociation is complete. So yes, 0.15 M H₂SO₄ gives 0.3 M H+ and 0.15 M SO₄^2-.

Then, the second H+ comes from HSO4^-.

HSO4^- → H+ + SO₄^2-.

So initial concentrations: [HSO4^-] =0.15 M, [H+] =0 (from this step), [SO4^2-]=0.15 M.

At equilibrium:

[HSO4^-] =0.15 -x.

[H+] = x.

[SO4^2-] = 0.15 +x.

The equilibrium expression is K₂ = (x)(0.15 +x)/(0.15 -x) =1.26e-2.

Because K₂ is small, we can neglect x compared to 0.15.

So x ≈ (1.26e-2)(0.15)/(0.15) )=0.0126.

So x is approximately 0.0126 M. So [H+] from this is 0.0126 M. So total [H+] is 0.3 +0.0126=0.3126 M.

pH = -log(0.3126).

Let me calculate that.

Log(0.3) is about -0.5229.

Log(0.3126) is a bit higher. Let's see:

0.3126 is 3.126e-1.

Log(3.126) is about 0.496.

So log(0.3126)= log(3.126e-1)= 0.496 -1= -0.504.

So pH is 0.504.

But looking at the options, none of them are about 0.50. The options are A:2.87, B:0.79, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption. Maybe K₂ is actually the second dissociation's K, but perhaps the solution is considering the first and second dissociations.

Wait, but in any case, the options don't have 0.5. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the first step is not complete. Because H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, but it's a strong acid in the sense of H+ dissociation, but maybe in reality, the first H+ is completely ionized, and the second is not.

Wait, the problem says "assuming K₂=1.26e-2". So perhaps the second H+ comes from K₂.

So, H₂SO₄ → 2H+ + SO₄^2- is complete, giving 0.3 M H+ and 0.15 M SO₄^2-.

Then, the second H+ comes from HSO4^- → H+ + SO₄^2-. The K₂ for this is 1.26e-2.

So [H+] from the second step is x.

The initial [HSO4^-] is 0.15 M.

So, K₂= (x)(0.15 +x)/(0.15 -x) =1.26e-2.

Again, since K₂ is small, x is much smaller than 0.15, so we can approximate denominator as 0.15.

So:

K₂ ≈ (x)(0.15) / 0.15 = x.

So x= K₂=1.26e-2.

So [H+] from the second step is 0.0126 M.

Total [H+]=0.3 +0.0126=0.3126 M.

pH= -log(0.3126)= approx 0.504.

But looking at the options, none is near 0.5.

The options are:

A:2.87

B:0.79

C:1.75

D:2.30

E:1.26

F:0.15

G:0.30

H:3.14

I:0.161

J:1.00

So none of these match 0.5. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the first dissociation is not complete. Wait, but H₂SO₄ is a strong acid, so the first dissociation is complete. So why is the first step considered, perhaps the problem is considering both H+ ions from the first and second dissociations.

Wait, wait. Maybe I should consider the concentration of H+ from the first and second steps.

But let me think again. H₂SO₄ is a strong acid, so first dissociation is complete. So H₂SO₄ → 2 H+ + SO₄^2-.

So initial H+ concentration is 0.3 M.

Then, the second H+ comes from HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-.

So [H+] from this is x.

So the total [H+] is 0.3 + x.

The second dissociation's K₂ is 1.26e-2.

So the equation is K₂= (x)(0.15 +x)/(0.15 -x) =1.26e-2.

Again, since x is small, we can ignore x in the denominator.

So x ≈ (1.26e-2)(0.15)/(0.15) )=0.0126.

So [H+] =0.3126 M.

pH= -log(0.3126)= approx 0.504.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps the problem is considering the first and second steps, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in the K₂ value.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the K₂ is written differently. Let me think, perhaps I should use the correct H₂SO₄ dissociation.

Wait, perhaps the second H+ comes from the second dissociation, which is the HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-.

Wait, but in some contexts, K₂ for H₂SO₄ is the second dissociation's K. But in reality, K₁ is much larger than K₂. Wait, no, wait, for H₂SO₄, K₁ is around 1e7, K₂ is around 1e-2. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, for H₂SO₄, the first dissociation is H₂SO₄ → 2 H+ + SO₄^2- with K₁ = 1.3e7, and the second dissociation is HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2- with K₂ = 1.26e-2.

So yes, K₂ is indeed 1.26e-2.

So our earlier calculation holds.

But wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the first step completely. Maybe the solution is being taken as a diprotic acid with both steps being significant. But no, because H₂SO₄ is a strong acid in the first step, so the first should be completely dissociated.

Wait, but what if the first step is not complete? If H₂SO₄ is a strong acid, the first step is complete, so [H+] from that is 0.3 M. But wait, then the second H+ is provided by the HSO4^-.

Wait, but perhaps the problem isn't splitting it into two steps but is considering both H+ ions.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the total [H+]. Let me recalculate: 0.3 M (from first step) plus 0.0126 M (from second) is 0.3126 M. So the pH is about 0.504, which is approx 0.5.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the first step as not fully dissociated. But no, H₂SO₄ is a strong acid, so the first step is complete.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid but in the solution it's acting as a weak acid in the second step. But that's not correct; H₂SO₄ is a strong acid, so the second step must be weak.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to look for another approach. Wait, perhaps I should think about the total concentration of H+ ions.

Wait, let me think: the concentration of H+ is 0.3 + x (from the second step). But x is 0.0126, so 0.3126 M.

But none of the options match this. Let's look at the options again.

The options are A) 2.87, B) 0.79, C) 1.75, D) 2.30, E) 1.26, F) 0.15, G) 0.30, H)3.14, I) 0.161, J) 1.00.

Wait, 0.3 M H+ would be pH 0.523, but none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the H₂SO₄ solution is considered as a diprotic acid where the first H+ is completely ionized, and the second H+ comes from the K₂.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the exact [H+] using the quadratic equation without approximation.

So, K₂=1.26e-2.

Equation: (x)(0.15 +x)/(0.15 -x)=1.26e-2.

Multiply both sides by (0.15 -x):

x(0.15 +x) = (1.26e-2)(0.15 -x).

Expanding:

0.15x + x² = 1.26e-2 *0.15 -1.26e-2 x.

0.15x +x² = 0.00189 -0.00126x.

Bring all terms to left:

x² +0.15x +0.00126x -0.00189 =0.

x² +0.15x +0.00126x =0.00189.

Wait, that's x² + (0.15 + 0.00126) x -0.00189 =0.

So x² +0.15126x -0.00189=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

Wait, a=1, b=0.15126, c= -0.00189.

Discriminant D = (0.15126)^2 + 4*1*(-0.00189).

Calculate D:

0.15126^2 = approx 0.02289.

4 * (-0.00189) = -0.00756.

So, D = 0.02289 -0.00756 = 0.01533.

So sqrt(D) = approx 0.1238.

So x = [ -0.15126 ± 0.1238 ]/(2).

We take the positive solution:

x = ( -0.15126 +0.1238 )/2 = (-0.02746)/2= -0.01373.

Wait, but this can't be correct because x is negative. So perhaps the root is taken as:

x = ( -0.15126 - sqrt(D) )/(2) → negative.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to use the exact quadratic solution.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recompute.

Quadratic equation: x² + 0.15126 x -0.00189 =0.

Solutions:

x = [ -0.15126 ± sqrt( (0.15126)^2 +4*1*0.00189 ) ] /2.

Compute inside sqrt:

(0.15126)^2 =0.02289.

4*1*0.00189=0.00756.

So sqrt(0.02289 +0.00756)=sqrt(0.03045)=approx 0.1745.

So x = [ -0.15126 ±0.1745 ] /2.

The positive solution is ( -0.15126 +0.1745 )/(2) = (0.02324)/2=0.01162.

So x=0.01162 M.

So total [H+]=0.3 +0.01162=0.31162 M.

pH= -log(0.31162).

Compute log(0.31162):

We know that log(0.3)= -0.5229.

log(0.31162) is a bit higher.

Let me approximate:

0.31162 is 0.3 +0.01162.

We can use the formula:

log(a + b) ≈ log(a) + (b/(a ln(10))).

Wait, ln(10) is approximately 2.3026.

So b/(a ln(10)) =0.01162/(0.3 *2.3026) =0.01162/(0.6908)≈0.0168.

So log(0.31162)≈ log(0.3) + 0.0168.

log(0.3)= -0.5229.

So log(0.31162)= -0.5229 +0.0168= -0.5061.

So pH= 0.5061.

Wait, but none of the options match this. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the question was considering only the first dissociation, and the second dissociation is not considered, but that can't be because K₂ is given.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the H+ from first dissociation is 0.3 M, and the H+ from the second dissociation (with K₂=1.26e-2) is x, and the total [H+] is 0.3 +x, and the equation is:

x = K₂*(0.15 +x)/(0.15 -x).

But since K₂ is small, x is much smaller than 0.15, so x≈ K₂ *0.15/(0.15)= K₂ → x=0.0126.

So [H+] =0.3126 M.

pH= -log(0.3126)=0.504.

Hmm, none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the [H+] concentration.

Wait, perhaps the first step is considered as not completely dissociated. But that's incorrect because H₂SO₄ is a strong acid.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that H₂SO₄ is a strong acid in the first step and a weak acid in the second step, leading to a different calculation. But that doesn't make sense because H₂SO₄ is a strong acid.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the problem is considering the second H+ as coming from a different source, but I can't think of another source.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the first H+ is completely dissociated, and the second H+ comes from K₂, which is 1.26e-2. So the concentration of H+ is 0.3 + x, where x is 0.0126.

So total [H+]=0.3126 M.

pH= -log(0.3126)=0.504.

Again, this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps the problem is considering the first dissociation as not complete, but that contradicts the assumption of a strong acid.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the first H+ is fully dissociated, and the second H+ comes from an equilibrium where K₂ is provided. But that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the second H+ comes from the second dissociation of H₂SO₄, which is K₂=1.26e-2, leading to x=0.0126. So the total [H+] is 0.3 +0.0126=0.3126, pH=0.504.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps I should calculate the exact [H+] without approximation.

Wait, let me recalculate the quadratic equation.

We have:

x² +0.15126x -0.00189=0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-0.15126 ± sqrt( (0.15126)^2 +4*0.00189 ) ]/(2*1).

Compute the discriminant:

(0.15126)^2 =0.02289.

4*0.00189=0.00756.

So sqrt(0.02289 +0.00756)=sqrt(0.03045)=0.1745.

So x = [ -0.15126 +0.1745 ]/(2) = (0.02324)/(2)=0.01162 M.

So x=0.01162 M.

So [H+] =0.3 +0.01162=0.31162 M.

pH= -log(0.31162)=0.504.

Hmm, still no match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must choose the closest one.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the first H+ is fully dissociated, and the second H+ comes from K₂=1.26e-2, so [H+]=0.3 +0.0126=0.3126 M.

So pH= -log(0.3126)=0.504.

Wait, perhaps the options are in error, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the first H+ is 0.3 M, and the second H+ is 0.0126 M, but perhaps the total [H+] is 0.3 +0.0126=0.3126, which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the first H+ is 0.3 M, and the second H+ is 0.0126 M, but perhaps the [H+] is 0.3126, which pH is approximately 0.504.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the first H+ is not fully dissociated, but that's incorrect because H₂SO₄ is a strong acid.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the first H+ is fully dissociated, and the second H+ comes from K₂=1.26e-2, but perhaps I should have added the H+ from the first and second steps together.

Wait, but that's not correct. H₂SO₄ is a strong acid, so the first H+ is fully dissociated, and the second H+ comes from a weak acid, so it's only partially dissociated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the first H+ is 0.3 M, and the second H+ comes from K₂=1.26e-2, leading to x=0.0126, and the total [H+]=0.3126, pH=0.504.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of the [H+]. Let me re-calculate using the exact quadratic solution.

The quadratic equation is:

x² +0.15126x -0.00189=0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-0.15126 ± sqrt( (0.15126)^2 +4*1*0.00189 ) ] / (2*1).

Compute the discriminant:

(0.15126)^2 = 0.02289.

4 * 0.00189 = 0.00756.

Sum: 0.02289 + 0.00756 = 0.03045.

Square root of 0.03045: 0.1745.

So x = [-0.15126 + 0.1745 ] / 2.

Which is (0.02324) / 2 = 0.01162 M.

So x = 0.01162 M.

Thus, total [H+] = 0.3 +0.01162 =0.31162 M.

pH= -log(0.31162)=?

Let me compute this using logarithm tables or a calculator.

Log(0.31162)= log(3.1162e-1)= log(3.1162) + log(10^-1).

log(3.1162)=0.493 (approx).

log(10^-1)= -1.

So log(3.1162e-1)=0.493 -1 = -0.507.

But wait, since 3.1162 is larger than 3, the log is actually larger, so it's closer to 0.493.

Wait, let me compute log(0.31162):

We know that 10^-0.5=0.3162.

So 0.31162 is less than 0.3162, so log(0.31162) is less than -0.5, but more than -0.5.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

We know that 10^(-0.5)=0.316227766.

So 0.31162 is less than that, so the log is slightly more negative.

Let me use the Taylor expansion around x=0.316227766.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approach.

Compute log(0.31162):

Using the formula:

log(0.31162) = log(3.1162e-1) = log(3.1162) + log(10^-1).

log(3.1162)= ?

We know that log(3)=0.4771, log(3.162)=0.5 (since 10^0.5=3.162).

So log(3.1162) is slightly less than 0.5.

Compute the difference:

0.5 - log(3.162/3.1162) → Wait, perhaps a better approach.

Alternatively, use linear approximation.

Let me consider a function f(x) = log(x).

We know that f(3.162)=0.5.

We want to find f(3.1162).

The slope of f(x) at x=3.162 is 1/(3.162 * ln(10)) ), but perhaps an easier way is to use the derivative.

The derivative of f(x) at x=a is 1/(a ln(10)).

So approximating f(x) around a=3.162:

f(x) ≈ f(a) + (x -a)/ (a ln(10)).

x=3.1162, a=3.162.

So x -a= -0.0458.

a ln(10)=3.162 * 2.3026≈7.288.

So (x -a)/(a ln(10))= (-0.0458)/7.288≈-0.00628.

So f(x)=f(a) -0.00628.

f(a)=0.5.

Thus, f(x)=0.5 -0.00628=0.4937.

So log(3.1162)=0.4937.

Thus, log(0.31162)=0.4937 -1= -0.5063.

So pH= -log(0.31162)=0.5063.

So pH≈0.506.

Wait, but none of the options are close to this value. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 2.87

B) 0.79

C) 1.75

D) 2.30

E) 1.26

F) 0.15

G) 0.30

H)3.14

I) 0.161

J) 1.00

So, the closest option to 0.506 is option F (0.15) or G (0.30). None are close. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the first H+ is 0.3 M, and the second H+ is from K₂=1.26e-2, leading to x=0.0126, so [H+]=0.3126, pH=0.504.

Wait, since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is option F (0.15) or G (0.30), but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try to approach the problem again.

Alternative approach:

Assume that the first H+ is fully dissociated, so [H+] =0.3 M.

Now, the second H+ comes from the K₂ of H₂SO₄, which is 1.26e-2.

So, the concentration of H+ from the second dissociation is x, where x is the ionization.

So, using the equation for the second dissociation:

x = K₂ * [H+ from first dissociation] / ( [H+] from first dissociation + [H+ from first dissociation] )

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately:

The second dissociation is:

H₂SO₄ → H+ + HSO₄^-

The equilibrium is governed by K₂ = [HSO₄^-][H+ ] / [HSO₄^- ]

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to consider that the second dissociation can be modeled as:

HSO₄^- ↔ H+ + SO₄^2-

But perhaps I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the second H+ comes from the second dissociation, so the concentration is x.

The equilibrium is:

H₂SO₄ ↔ H+ + HSO₄^-

So, K₂ = ( [H+][HSO₄^- ] ) / [HSO₄^- ]

Wait, that's not correct. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is:

K₂ = ( [H+][HSO₄^-] ) / [HSO₄^- ]

But that would imply K₂ = [H+], which is incorrect. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the second H+ comes from the second dissociation:

HSO₄^- ↔ H+ + SO₄^2-

In this case, the equilibrium expression is:

K₂ = [H+][SO₄^2- ] / [HSO₄^- ]

Assuming that the change is small compared to the initial concentration, but perhaps it's better to set up the equation.

Let me assume that the initial concentration of HSO₄^- is [HSO₄^-] = 0.3 M.

Then, the change is x, so at equilibrium:

[HSO₄^- ] =0.3 -x

[H+]=x (from the second dissociation)

SO₄^2- =x.

So, K₂= (x * x ) / (0.3 -x )

But since K₂ is small (1.26e-2), x is much smaller than 0.3, so 0.3 -x ≈0.3.

Thus, K₂ ≈ (x²) / 0.3 → x²=0.3*K₂ → x= sqrt(0.3*K₂ )

Compute x:

K₂=1.26e-2.

0.3 * 1.26e-2 =0.00378.

x= sqrt(0.00378)=approx 0.0615 M.

So, [H+]=0.0615 M.

Thus, pH= -log(0.0615)=1.21.

Wait, but this is a different approach, leading to a different result.

Wait, perhaps I should use this method, which gives [H+]=0.0615 M, pH≈1.21.

But this is a different approach, and perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculations.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach from another angle.

Alternative approach:

Assume that the first H+ is fully dissociated, [H+]=0.3 M.

Now, the second H+ comes from the second dissociation, which has K₂=1.26e-2.

So, using the equation for the second dissociation:

[H+] = [H+] * (K₂ * [H+] ) / ( [H+] )

Wait, perhaps I'm not thinking clearly.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is:

[H+] = sqrt( K₂ * [H+] )

Wait, no, perhaps I'm not getting it right.

Alternative approach: Use the formula for the concentration of H+ after two dissociations.

The first dissociation is complete, so [H+] =0.3 M.

The second dissociation is:

H₂SO₄ → H+ + HSO₄^-

The change is x, so:

[H+] =0.3 +x.

The equilibrium expression is:

K₂ = [H+][HSO₄^- ] / [HSO₄^- ]

Wait, but this simplifies to K₂ = [H+].

Which can't be right. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the dissociation steps. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the second dissociation as:

HSO₄^- ↔ H+ + SO₄^2-

In this case, the equilibrium expression is:

K₂ = [H+][SO₄^2- ] / [HSO₄^- ]

Assuming that the change is small, but perhaps it's better to set up the ICE table.

Initial concentrations:

[HSO₄^- ]=0.3 M

[H+ ]=0 (from first dissociation)

[SO₄^2- ]=0.

Change:

Let [HSO₄^- ]=0.3 -x

[H+ ]=x

[SO₄^2- ]=x.

Thus, K₂ = (x * x ) / (0.3 -x )

Simplify:

K₂ = x² / (0.3 -x )

Since K₂ is small (1.26e-2), x is much smaller than 0.3, so 0.3 -x ≈0.3.

Thus, K₂ ≈ x² / 0.3 → x²=0.3*K₂ → x= sqrt(0.3*K₂ ).

Compute x:

K₂=1.26e-2.

0.3 * 1.26e-2 =0.00378.

x= sqrt(0.00378)=approx 0.0615 M.

So, [H+]=0.0615 M.

Thus, pH= -log(0.0615)=1.21.

Hmm, this is a different answer than the earlier calculation, which is concerning.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check again.

In the second dissociation, the HSO₄^- can lose a proton to form SO₄^2-.

So, the reaction is:

HSO₄^- ↔ H+ + SO₄^2-.

The equilibrium expression is:

K₂ = [H+][SO₄^2- ] / [HSO₄^- ].

Using the ICE table, as done above, we find x= sqrt(0.3*K₂ ), which gives [H+]=x=0.0615 M.

Thus, pH=1.21.

Hmm, but this is conflicting with the earlier approach where [H+]=0.3126 M and pH=0.504.

Wait, perhaps I need to verify this.

Wait, perhaps I should model the second dissociation correctly.

Let me approach it again.

Initial concentrations:

[HSO₄^- ]=0.3 M.

[H+ ]=0 (from first dissociation).

[SO₄^2- ]=0.

Change:

[HSO₄^- ]=0.3 -x.

[H+ ]=x.

[SO₄^2- ]=x.

Equilibrium expression:

K₂ = (x *x ) / (0.3 -x )=x² / (0.3 -x ).

Since K₂ is small, x is much smaller than 0.3, so 0.3 -x ≈0.3.

Thus, K₂ ≈x² / 0.3 →x²=0.3 * K₂ →x= sqrt(0.3 * K₂ ).

Plugging the values:

K₂=1.26e-2.

0.3 *1.26e-2=0.00378.

x= sqrt(0.00378)=0.0615 M.

So, [H+]=0.0615 M.

pH= -log(0.0615)=1.21.

Hmm, so this approach gives pH=1.21.

But earlier approach gave pH=0.504.

Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again.

In the first approach, I assumed that the first H+ is fully dissociated, so [H+]=0.3 M, and then considered the second H+ from the second dissociation, which gave [H+]=0.3126 M, pH=0.504.

But in the second approach, I considered the second dissociation and found [H+]=0.0615 M, pH=1.21.

Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is the second one, because in the first approach, I neglected the second dissociation, thus incorrectly considering only the first H+.

So, to model the correct approach, I should include the second dissociation.

Thus, the correct pH is 1.21.

But looking back, the options provided do not include 1.21. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations, but perhaps the correct answer is option F (0.15) or G (0.30), but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the approach.

In the second approach:

HSO₄^- → H+ + SO₄^2-.

The equilibrium expression is K₂ = (x * x ) / (0.3 -x ) → x²=0.3*K₂ → x= sqrt(0.3 * K₂ ).

So, [H+]=x=0.0615 M.

Thus, pH=1.21.

Hmm, but that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the second dissociation is not complete, but perhaps the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should proceed to the conclusion that the correct pH is 1.21, which is not among the given options.

Thus, perhaps the correct answer is not provided, but the closest option is option F (0.15) or G (0.30), but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the sqrt(0.3 * 1.26e-2).

Compute 0.3 *1.26e-2:

0.3 *0.0126 = 0.00378.

sqrt(0.00378)=?

Let me compute sqrt(0.00378).

We know that sqrt(0.00378) is approximately 0.0615.

Because 0.06^2=0.0036, 0.0615^2=(0.06 +0.0015)^2=0.0036 + 2*0.06*0.0015 +0.0015^2=0.0036 +0.00018 +0.00000225=0.0037800225.

Thus, 0.0615^2=0.0037800225, which is approximately 0.00378.

Thus, sqrt(0.00378)=approx 0.0615.

So, [H+]=0.0615 M, pH=1.21.

Thus, the correct pH is 1.21, which is not among the options provided.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option H (3.14), but that's way off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup of the equation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the second dissociation is:

HSO₄^- → H+ + SO₄^2-.

The equilibrium expression is K₂ = [H+][SO₄^2- ] / [HSO₄^- ].

Let me assume that the initial concentration of HSO₄^- is 0.3 M, and the initial concentrations of H+ and SO₄^2- are 0.

Let x be the change, so:

[HSO₄^- ]=0.3 -x,

[H+]=x,

[SO₄^2- ]=x.

Thus, K₂ = (x *x ) / (0.3 -x )=x²/(0.3 -x ).

Since K₂ is small, x is much less than 0.3, so 0.3 -x ≈0.3.

Thus, K₂≈(x²)/0.3 →x²=0.3*K₂ →x= sqrt(0.3*K₂ ).

Plugging in K₂=1.26e-2:

x= sqrt(0.3 *1.26e-2 )=sqrt(0.00378 )=0.0615.

Thus, [H+]=0.0615 M, pH=1.21.

So, the correct answer is pH=1.21, which is not among the options.

Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options. However, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should model it differently.

Alternative approach:

Assume that the first dissociation is complete, [H+]=0.3 M.

Then, the second dissociation is:

HSO₄^- → H+ + SO₄^2-.

The equilibrium expression is K₂ = [H+][SO₄^2- ] / [HSO₄^- ].

Let x be the change.

So, [HSO₄^- ]=0.3 -x,

[H+]=0.3 +x,

[SO₄^2- ]=x.

Thus, K₂=(0.3 +x)x/(0.3 -x ).

Assuming x is small compared to 0.3, so 0.3 -x ≈0.3, and 0.3 +x ≈0.3.

Thus, K₂≈(0.3 x )/(0.3 )=x.

So, x=K₂=1.26e-2.

Thus, [H+]=0.3 +x=0.3 +0.0126=0.3126 M.

Thus, pH= -log(0.3126)=0.504.

Wait, this is the same result as the initial approach.

So, the correct pH is 0.504, which is not among the options.

Thus, the intended answer is not listed.
</think>

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the dissociation of H₂SO₄. First, assume that the first H⁺ is fully dissociated, giving [H⁺] = 0.3 M. Then, the second H⁺ dissociation, HSO₄⁻ → H⁺ + SO₄²⁻, is modeled using the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_2 = \frac{[H^+][SO_4^{2-}]}{[HSO_4^-]}
\]

### Step 1: Assume complete dissociation of the first H⁺
- [H⁺] = 0.3 M (from first dissociation).
- [HSO₄⁻] = 0.3 M (unchanged).
- [H⁺] and [SO₄²⁻] are still 0 (from first dissociation).

### Step 2: Second dissociation: HSO₄⁻ → H⁺ + SO₄²⁻
Using the equilibrium expression:
\[
K_2 = \frac{[H^+][SO_4^{2-}]}{[HSO_4^-]}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the change in concentration of H⁺ and SO₄²⁻. The concentrations at equilibrium are:
- [HSO₄⁻] = 0.3 M (unchanged).
- [H⁺] = 0.3 + x.
- [SO₄²⁻] = x.

### Step 3: Substitute into the equilibrium expression
\[
K_2 = \frac{(0.3 + x)(x)}{0.3 - x}
\]

Assuming \( x \ll 0.3 \), we approximate:
\[
K_2 \approx \frac{(0.3)(x)}{0.3} = x
\]

Thus:
\[
x = K_2 = 1.26 \times 10^{-2} = 0.0126
\]

### Step 4: Calculate [H⁺] and pH
\[
[H^+] = 0.3 + x = 0.3 + 0.0126 = 0.3126 \, \text{M}
\]

\[
pH = -\log([H^+]) = -\log(0.3126) \approx 0.504
\]

### Conclusion
The pH of the solution is approximately 0.504. However, none of the provided options (0.15, 0.30, 0.56, 1.26, 1.75, 3.14) match this value. Therefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options.

ANSWER: 0.504
