Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this question about stable isotopes for measuring total body water. Hmm, I remember that measuring body water is usually done by counting the number of heavy atoms, like oxygen and hydrogen. But wait, what's the exact isotope used?

Wait, I think about the different stable isotopes. Nitrogen has a bunch of isotopes, but I'm not sure about the specific ones used. Oxygen has O-16 and O-18. But wait, is it about heavy water, which is made of O-18? Oh right, because in the body, water is mostly O-18, which is heavier than O-16. So if you count the number of O-18 atoms in a sample, that gives you an estimate of body water.

Looking at the options, option B is Oxygen 16. That would give you the number of oxygen atoms that are lighter, which isn't what's needed. Option C is Oxygen 18. Oh, that's definitely what's used. So the correct answer should be C, Oxygen 18.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there other isotopes involved? Like maybe deuterium? Because heavy water is made up mostly of deuterium. Oh wait, I'm mixing things up. Deuterium is a different isotope, so maybe not. So the key is that total body water is measured by counting oxygen-18, which is option C.

The correct answer is **C: Oxygen 18**, as it is commonly used to measure total body water by counting the number of heavy oxygen atoms (O-18) present in the sample. 

Answer: C
