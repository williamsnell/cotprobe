Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the density of hydrogen gas. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember density is mass divided by volume. Oh wait, but the units are important here.

The problem says 2.02 grams of hydrogen gas occupies 22.4 liters. And I need to find the density in grams per milliliter. Right, because milliliters are smaller units than liters, so the density should be quite high since hydrogen is pretty light.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I got the units right. Oh yeah, density is mass/volume. So I have the mass, which is 2.02 grams. The volume is 22.4 liters. But wait, the question wants it in grams per milliliter. Oh right, because 1 liter is 1000 milliliters. So I need to convert liters to milliliters.

So first step: convert liters to milliliters. 22.4 liters multiplied by 1000 (since 1L=1000ml) gives 22400 milliliters. Oh wait no, wait: 22.4 liters is 22,400 milliliters? Wait, 22.4 liters is 22.4 × 1000 = 22400 mL? Yeah. So that's the volume.

Now, density is mass divided by volume. So 2.02 grams divided by 22400 mL. Let me do that calculation. 2.02 / 22400. Hmm, let me think about this.

Wait, 2.02 divided by 22400—what's that approximately? Let me calculate. 22400 is 2.24 × 10^4. So 2.02 / 22400 = (2.02 / 2.24) × 10^-4. Let me compute 2.02 / 2.24.

Hmm, 2.24 is 2 and 0.24, which is 2 + 0.24. Let me see, 2.02 divided by 2.24. Let's approximate. 2.02 is about 2, so 2/2.24 is approximately 0.89286. So 2.02/2.24 would be a little higher, around 0.895.

So that's approximately 0.895 × 1e-4, which is 8.95e-5 g/mL. Wait, but the options are in different exponents. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact decimal calculations. Let me do 2.02 ÷ 22400.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 2.02 / 22400 = 2.02 / (22.4 × 1000) = (2.02 / 22.4) × 1e-3.

Wait, 2.02 divided by 22.4, let's compute that. 22.4 is 22.4. 2.02 / 22.4 = ?

Well, 22.4 × 0.09 = 2.016. Oh, because 22.4 *0.09 = 2.016. So 2.02 is 2.016 + 0.004. So 0.09 + (0.004/22.4) = 0.09 + 0.00017857 ≈ 0.09017857.

So 0.09017857 is approximately 0.09017857. So this is 0.09017857 × 1e-3 = 9.017857e-6 grams per milliliter? Wait, wait wait. Because wait, 2.02 / 22400 mL is 2.02 / 22400 = 9.017857 × 1e-5 grams/mL? Because 1e-4 is 0.0001, so 9e-5 is 0.00009.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of exponents.

22400 = 2.24e4. So 2.02 / (2.24e4) = (2.02 / 2.24) * 1e-4.

2.02 / 2.24 is approximately 0.895. So 0.895 * 1e-4 is 8.95e-5 grams/mL. Wait, but 8.95e-5 is 8.95 ×10^-5, which is 0.0000895 g/mL.

Looking at the options, option J is 8.0 ×10^-5, H is 9.0 ×10^-5, etc.

Wait, but my calculation gives approximately 8.95e-5, which is about 8.95 ×1e-5, which is 8.95 ×10^-5. So the closest option is J: 8.0 ×10^-5, but wait, 8.95 is closer to 9.0 than 8.0. Hmm, but wait, the options are all 10^-5 scaled. Let me look again.

Option G is 6.0e-5, H is 9.0e-5, etc. But my calculation is around 8.95e-5. So perhaps the exact value would be better.

Wait, let me do the exact division. 2.02 divided by 22400.

22400 is 224 x 100. So 2.02 / (224 *100) = (2.02/224) * 1e-2.

2.02 / 224: Let's compute 224 into 2.02.

Wait, 224 is 2.24e2. So 2.02 / 224 = (2.02 / 2.24) * 1e-2.

Earlier I approximated 2.02/2.24 as 0.895, so 0.895e-2 = 8.95e-3. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, 2.02 is 2.02 grams, volume is 22400 mL. So 2.02 / 22400 = 2.02/(22.4 * 1000) ) = (2.02/22.4) * 1e-3.

Wait, 2.02 /22.4 is same as 202 /2240. Let me compute 202 ÷ 2240.

Hmm, 2240 is 2.24e3. So 202 /2240 = (2.02e2)/(2.24e3) )= (2.02/2.24) * 1e-1.

2.02 / 2.24 is about 0.895, so 0.895 * 0.1 = 0.0895.

So 0.0895 × 1e-3 is 8.95e-5. So 8.95 ×10^-5 g/mL. Rounding that, it's approximately 9.0e-5, which is option H.

Wait, but wait, what about the significant figures? The given data is 2.02 g and 22.4 L. The 2.02 has three sig figs, 22.4 has three as well. So the answer should have three sig figs.

Our calculation gave 8.95e-5, which is 8.95 ×10^-5. Rounded to three sig figs, that's 8.95 → 8.95 is already three sig figs.

Wait, 8.95e-5 is 8.95 ×10^-5. The options:

Option H is 9.0 ×10^-5. But 8.95 is closer to 9.0 than 8.9. So maybe H is the answer, but wait the exact calculation: 2.02 /22400.

Let me compute that more precisely.

2.02 ÷ 22400.

Hmm, 22400 × 9e-5 = 22400 * 0.00009 = 2.016.

Oh wait, because 22400 * 0.00009 = 2.016 grams. So 2.02 grams is 2.016 grams × (2.02/2.016) → approximately 1.0029 times. So 0.00009 × (2.02/2.016) → 0.00009 * 1.0029 ≈ 0.00009026.

So 9.026 ×10^-5 grams/mL. Which is approximately 9.0 ×10^-5, so option H.

But wait, earlier I thought 8.95e-5 is approximately 8.95, which is closer to 9.0. So why isn't the answer option H?

Wait, perhaps the problem is the units. Let me check again.

Wait, the volume is 22.4 liters, which is 22400 mL. That's correct.

So, density = 2.02 g / 22400 mL.

Wait, but what's 22400 mL? 22400 is 2.24 liters. Wait, 22400 mL is 22.4 L. So perhaps I should have considered the volume in liters.

Wait, if I do 2.02 g / 22.4 L, that would be 2.02/22.4 = 0.09017857 g/L. Since 1 g/mL is 1000 g/L. So 0.09017857 g/L = 0.09017857 g/L * (1 L/1000 mL) = 0.09017857 / 1000 g/mL = 9.017857e-5 g/mL.

Which is approximately 9.0e-5, so option H.

Wait, but earlier I thought the volume should be in mL, but perhaps the question expects to use liters.

Wait, so which approach is correct?

Wait, the units for density are g/mL. So if I compute grams per liter, I can convert it to g/mL.

Because 1 liter is 1000 mL. So 2.02g /22.4 L = (2.02/22.4) g/L.

2.02 divided by 22.4. Let me compute that.

22.4 × 0.09 = 2.016. So 2.02/22.4=0.09017857 g/L.

To convert to g/mL, divide by 1000: 0.09017857 / 1000 = 9.017857e-5 g/mL.

Which is approximately 9.0e-5 g/mL. So the correct answer would be H, 9.0 ×10^-5.

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe I was supposed to use mL volume. Oh, but the question asks for grams per milliliter, so mL is correct.

So why in the earlier calculation did I get 8.95e-5? Because I might have miscalculated.

Wait, let me redo the division:

2.02 / 22400.

22400 = 2.24 ×10^4.

So 2.02 / 2.24e4 = (2.02/2.24) × 1e-4.

2.02 /2.24 is 0.895357.

Multiply by 1e-4: 0.895357e-4 = 8.95357e-5, which is 8.95357 ×1e-5.

So that's about 8.95e-5. So close to 9.0e-5.

Wait, but the options don't have 8.95e-5. The options are:

G: 6.0e-5

H:9.0e-5

So given that, the correct answer is H. But wait, let me look at the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A:5.5 ×10^-5

B:12.0 ×10^-5

C:10 ×10^-5

D:4.5 ×10^-5

E:1.1 ×10^-5

F:11 ×10^-5

G:6.0 ×10^-5

H:9.0 ×10^-5

I:9.0 ×10^-5 (same as H?)

J:8.0 ×10^-5

Wait, options G and I are the same. So the correct option is H.

But wait, the initial approach got me 8.95e-5. So approximately 9.0e-5 would be option H.

So the correct answer is option H:9.0 ×10^-5 g/mL.

To calculate the density of hydrogen gas, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}
\]

The problem states that 2.02 g of hydrogen gas occupies 22.4 L. Density is expressed in grams per milliliter (g/mL). Since 1 L = 1000 mL, the volume must be converted from liters to milliliters:

\[
22.4 \, \text{L} = 22.4 \times 1000 = 22400 \, \text{mL}
\]

Now, calculate the density:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{2.02 \, \text{g}}{22400 \, \text{mL}} = \frac{2.02}{22400} \, \text{g/mL}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{2.02}{22400} = 0.00009017857 \, \text{g/mL} \approx 9.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{g/mL}
\]

Thus, the density of hydrogen gas is approximately \( 9.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{g/mL} \).

Among the given options, the closest match is:

- **H: \( 9.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{g/mL} \)**
