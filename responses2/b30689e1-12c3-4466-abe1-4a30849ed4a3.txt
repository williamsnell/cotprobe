Okay, so I need to figure out where the optic nerve starts being processed in the brain. Hmm, I remember that the optic nerve comes from the retina, which is located in the back of the eye. But where does the processing happen?

Wait, the optic nerve is a nerve signal that starts in the retina. The retina contains photoreceptors, which are tiny cones that detect light and color. These receptors are part of the visual pathway. So the initial processing is in the retina, which is in the occipital lobe. Or is it the thalamus?

Oh right, the brain processes visual information through the visual pathway. The visual pathway starts in the retina, which is in the occipital lobe. But wait, another thought: sometimes the brain's structures are involved in processing, so maybe the thalamus is involved in connecting the retina to the rest of the brain.

Wait, the question is about where the information is initially processed. The optic nerve is a nerve signal, so it's the nerve that starts in the retina. But the brain processes this signal. So the initial part where the optic nerve is sent out is the retina. So the processing happens in the occipital lobe because that's where the photoreceptors are.

Wait, but another approach: the optic nerve originates in the retina, which is in the occipital lobe. So the optic nerve starts in the occipital lobe. So the answer should be C: occipital lobe.

Alternatively, sometimes the brain processes the visual information, but the initial processing is in the retina. So the optic nerve begins in the retina, which is in the occipital lobe. So the answer should be C.

The optic nerve originates from the retina, which is located in the occipital lobe. Therefore, the optic nerve is initially processed in the occipital lobe.

Answer: C
