Question:

Consider the number pattern 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29. Which rule could have been used to make the pattern?

Options:

A: Start with 5. Subtract 4 each time to get the next number.
B: Start with 5. Add 4 each time to get the next number.
C: Start with 5. Add 5 each time to get the next number.
D: Start with 0. Add 5 each time to get the next number.
E: Start with 9. Subtract 4 each time to get the next number.
F: Start with 1. Add 4 each time to get the next number.
G: Start with 0. Add 4 each time to get the next number.
H: Start with 0. Add 3 each time to get the next number.
I: Start with 5. Add 3 each time to get the next number.

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct pattern rule for the sequence 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29. Let me think through each step carefully.

First, the sequence starts at 5. Let's list the numbers: 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29.

I should check how each number is obtained from the previous one. Let's compute the difference between consecutive terms.

9 - 5 = 4
13 - 9 = 4
17 - 13 = 4
21 - 17 = 4
25 -21=4
29-25=4.

So, each time, the next number is obtained by adding 4. Let me look at the options again.

Option B says start with 5 and add 4 each time. That fits because 5+4=9, 9+4=13, and so on. That makes sense.

Let me check other options to make sure.

Option A: Starts with 5 but subtracts 4. That would give 5-4=1, which isn't the second term. So A is wrong.

Option C: Starts with 5 and adds 5. 5+5=10, but next term is 9, so no.

Option D: Starts with 0 and adds 5. 0+5=5, which is the first term. Then next would be 10, but the sequence starts at 5. Not matching.

Option E: Starts with 9 and subtracts 4. 9-4=5, which is the first term, then 1, which isn't the case. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Starts with 1 and adds 4. 1+4=5, which is the first term, then 9, which is correct. But the starting point is 1, which isn't the first term of our sequence. So F is not the right rule.

Option G: Starts with 0 and adds 4. 0+4=4, which isn't the first term. So G is wrong.

Option H: Starts with 0 and adds 3. 0+3=3, not 5. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Starts with 5 and adds 3. 5+3=8, which isn't the next term. So I is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B: Start with 5 and add 4 each time.

The pattern increases by 4 each time, starting from 5.
