Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about lunar maria. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think this through step by step. 

The question is asking about what the lunar maria are made of. The options are A through J, each describing different features. I remember that the Moon has a lot of these dark regions called maria, and they're pretty interesting.

First, I'll go through each option. Option A says maria are valleys formed by tectonic activity. Wait, I don't think that's right. Valleys I associate with are the craters, not the basins or basins between them. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: lighter colored regions. Hmm, I think the basins of the Moon's crust are darker, not necessarily lighter. So maybe B is not correct.

Option C: dark regions caused by meteorite impacts. Oh, that rings a bell. I remember that the Moon was formed by a collision of Earth's moon and Earth's parent planet, and that process left behind basins and craters. These basins and craters are dark and caused by impacts, specifically by meteorites. So C sounds correct.

Option D: ice-filled craters near the poles. Well, I know that craters are dark, but I think they're more commonly associated with the Moon's poles. Wait, but I'm not sure. I think the craters themselves are dark, but the question says 'near the poles.' Does that make sense? I think craters are found near the poles, but the question is about dark regions, not specifically craters. So maybe D isn't the best answer.

Option E: dark lavas inside impact basins. Lava refers to molten rock. I think that the basins are filled with basaltic lava, which are dark. So E sounds like it's saying the basins themselves are dark, but the question is about dark regions, which could include both the basins and the underlying structures. But I'm not sure if E is correct.

Option F: the Moon's oceans equivalent. I don't think so. The basins and craters are made of basalt, which is different from water. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: high mountain ranges. No, I don't think so. The basins are more like valleys, not high mountains. So G is wrong.

Option H: dark lavas inside volcanic activity. Wait, probably similar to E. So H is another way of saying the basins are filled with dark lava, which is dark. So I think E and H are both correct in that aspect, but I need to see if the question is about the structure or the composition.

Option I: bright regions. No, bright regions are probably craters, not dark. So I is incorrect.

Option J: ancient heavily cratered highlands. Highlands would imply hills, not valleys. So J is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is C: dark regions caused by meteorite impacts.

The lunar maria are dark regions formed by meteorite impacts. These impacts left behind basins and craters on the Moon's surface, which are described as dark. 

Answer: C
