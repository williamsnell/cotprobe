Okay, so I have this question about the Kubler-Ross model, specifically about the initial reaction when a terminally ill patient is informed. Hmm, I remember that Kubler-Ross has a model for treating patients who are in terminal situations. The model is a set of steps for giving the patient and their caregivers a chance to "get their act together."

Let me try to recall the steps. The first step is to inform the patient that their condition is serious. So, when someone is first informed, the patient might be feeling really angry or frustrated. Looking at the options, option A says, "I hate everybody and everything!" That sounds like the first step. The patient is upset because the condition is serious.

Other options might describe different stages. Option B is about negotiating a deal with God, which sounds more like therapy with a therapist or a different approach. Option C is about hoping to change one's life, which is more of a positive response, not the first reaction. Option D says "No. it's not possible!" That's more of a definitive negative reaction, not the initial one. Option E is about giving up, which is a strong negative but not the first step. Option F is about not believing in terminal illnesses, which is more of a factual reaction, not the first step. Option G talks about being ready, which is more of a positive state after the initial reaction. Option H is about knowing the situation, which is more about the patient's awareness. Option I is about fighting and winning, which is a proactive step, but it's the last step. Option J is about fairness, which doesn't fit the first response.

So the first step is to inform the patient that the condition is serious. So the correct answer should be option A.
