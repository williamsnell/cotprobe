Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy stored in a solenoid's magnetic field. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electromagnetism, but let me think this through.

The question says the solenoid is 30 cm long and 3 cm in diameter. It has 1000 turns of wire carrying a current of 10 amps. I need to find the energy stored, and the options are given from A to H. 

Wait, right, the energy stored in the magnetic field of a solenoid is given by the formula U = (1/2) L I². Where L is the inductance and I is the current. So I need to find the inductance first.

Inductance of a solenoid is calculated using L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l. Oh wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me recall. The formula for the inductance of a solenoid is L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l, yes. Where μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is 4π × 10^-7 H/m. N is the number of turns, A is the cross-sectional area, and l is the length.

So, let's plug in the numbers. First, let's convert all measurements to meters to keep the units consistent. 

Length l is 30 cm, which is 0.3 meters. Diameter is 3 cm, so radius r is 1.5 cm, or 0.015 meters. The cross-sectional area A is π r². Let me compute that: r is 0.015 m, so r squared is 0.000225 m². Multiply by π, so A is approximately 0.0007065 m².

Number of turns N is 1000. Current I is 10 A.

Now, let's compute L. μ₀ is 4π × 10^-7. So L = (4π ×1e-7) * (1000)^2 * 0.0007065 / 0.3.

Wait, let's calculate each part step by step.

Calculating numerator: μ₀ * N² * A = (4πe-7) * (1e6) * (0.0007065).

Let me compute each part:

4πe-7 is approximately 1.2566e-6.
1e6 is 1,000,000.
Multiply 1.2566e-6 * 1e6 = 1.2566.

Multiply that by A which is 0.0007065: 1.2566 * 0.0007065 ≈ 0.000888.

Denominator is 0.3 meters.

So L = 0.000888 / 0.3 ≈ 0.00296 H. Hmm, that seems low or maybe high? Wait, wait, let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me recompute the multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each step carefully.

Wait, let me compute μ₀*N^2*A step by step.

μ₀ = 4π × 1e-7 H/m.

N=1000, so N²=1e6.

A = π r². r=0.015 m, so r² is 0.000225 m². A = π * 0.000225 ≈ 0.0007065 m².

So, μ₀*N²*A = (4πe-7) * 1e6 * 0.0007065.

Breaking it down: 4π is about 12.566.

So 12.566e-7 * 1e6 = 12.566e-1 = 1.2566.

Multiply by 0.0007065: 1.2566 * 0.0007065 ≈ 0.000888.

Divide by 0.3 m: 0.000888 / 0.3 = 0.00296 H.

So L is approximately 0.00296 H.

Now, the energy U is (1/2) L I². So I is 10 A.

I² is 100.

(1/2) * 0.00296 * 100 = (1/2) * 0.296 = 0.148 joules.

Wait, that's approximately 0.15 J. Looking at the options, option E is 0.15 millijoules, which is 0.00015 J. Option G is 0.15 J.

Hmm, so my initial calculation gives approximately 0.15 J. But wait, let me double-check the calculation because sometimes the formula for inductance might be different. Oh wait, I think I might have mixed up the formula. Wait, another formula for inductance of a solenoid is L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l.

Wait, so L = (μ₀ N² A) / l.

Let me recalculate the inductance.

μ₀ = 4πe-7 H/m.

N=1000, so N²=1e6.

A = π (0.015)^2 = π * 0.000225 ≈ 0.0007065 m².

So, μ₀ * N² * A = (4πe-7) * 1e6 * 0.0007065.

Let me compute this: 4pi is ~12.566, so 12.566e-7 * 1e6 = 1.2566.

Multiply that by 0.0007065: 1.2566 * 0.0007065 ≈ 0.000888.

Divide by 0.3 m: 0.000888 / 0.3 ≈ 0.00296 H.

So, L ≈ 0.00296 H.

Now, U = 0.5 * L * I² = 0.5 * 0.00296 * (10)^2.

10² is 100. So U = 0.5 * 0.00296 * 100.

0.5 * 0.00296 is 0.00148. Multiply by 100: 0.148 J.

So, about 0.15 J. Looking at the options, option E is 0.15 mJ, which is 0.00015 J, but that's much less than what I got. Hmm. Option G is 0.15 J. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, another thing. Oh, wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the formula. Let me think. Is the formula for the energy in the magnetic field of a solenoid correct?

Wait, the energy stored in a solenoid's magnetic field is given by U = (1/2) L I², which is correct. So the calculation should be right.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L. Let me re-calculate L more precisely.

μ₀ = 4π ×1e-7 H/m ≈ 1.2566e-6 H/m.

N=1000. N²=1e6.

A = π*(0.015)^2 = π * 0.000225 ≈ 0.000706858 m².

Multiply μ₀ * N² * A: 1.2566e-6 * 1e6 = 1.2566. 1.2566 * 0.000706858 ≈ let's compute 1.2566 * 0.000706858.

0.000706858 is about 7.06858e-4.

1.2566 * 7.06858e-4 = approximately 0.000888 H·m.

Wait, no: H/m * m² * 1/m. Wait, no, the formula is correct. So the product is (μ₀ * N² * A) = (1.2566e-6 H/m) * (1e6) * (0.000706858 m²) → (1.2566e-6 * 1e6) is 1.2566. Multiply by 0.000706858 → 1.2566 * 0.000706858 ≈ 0.000888 H.

Then, L = 0.000888 / 0.3 m → 0.00296 H.

So, U = 0.5 * 0.00296 * 100 = 0.148 J.

So about 0.148 J, which is approximately 0.15 J.

Looking at the options:

H says 15 millijoules, which is 0.015 J. No. E is 0.15 mJ (0.00015 J), which is much less. So option G is 0.15 J.

Wait, or did I miscalculate? Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, the energy in the solenoid's field is indeed U = (1/2) L I². So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the inductance. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the cross-sectional area. Let me recalculate A.

diameter is 3 cm → radius is 1.5 cm = 0.015 m. So area is π * (0.015)^2 = π * 0.000225 = 0.000706858 m². So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the formula for the energy in the solenoid as U = (B² A l) / (2μ₀), where B is the magnetic field strength. Wait, that's another approach. Let me see if that gives me the same result.

The magnetic field B in a solenoid is given by B = μ₀ N I / l. So I can compute B first.

B = (4πe-7 H/m) * (1000) * (10 A) / (0.3 m)

Calculating numerator: 4πe-7 * 1000 * 10 = 4πe-7 * 1e4 = 4πe-3. That's approximately 0.012566 H/m * 1e4? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4πe-7 * 1e3 * 1e1 = 4πe-7 * 1e4 = 4πe-3. So 4πe-3 is about 12.566e-3.

Divide by 0.3 m: 12.566e-3 / 0.3 ≈ 0.04188 T.

So B is approximately 0.04188 Tesla.

Now, the energy U can be found by U = (B² A l) / (2μ₀).

Compute B²: (0.04188)^2 ≈ 0.001754 T².

Multiply by A (0.000706858 m²): 0.001754 * 0.000706858 ≈ about 1.237e-6 T²·m².

Multiply by length l (0.3 m): 1.237e-6 * 0.3 ≈ 3.712e-7.

Divide by (2μ₀) which is 2*(4πe-7) ≈ 8πe-7 ≈ 2.513e-6.

So U = (3.712e-7) / (2.513e-6) ) = approx 0.1479 J.

That's about 0.148 J, same as before. So that's 0.15 J. So the correct answer is option G: 0.15 J.

To determine the energy stored in the magnetic field of the solenoid, the formula for the energy stored is:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} L I^2
\]

where \( L \) is the inductance of the solenoid and \( I \) is the current. The inductance \( L \) of a solenoid is given by:

\[
L = \frac{\mu_0 N^2 A}{l}
\]

where:
- \( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{H/m} \) (permeability of free space),
- \( N = 1000 \) (number of turns),
- \( A = \pi r^2 \) (cross-sectional area of the solenoid),
- \( l = 0.3 \, \text{m} \) (length of the solenoid).

### Step 1: Calculate the cross-sectional area \( A \)
The diameter of the solenoid is \( 3 \, \text{cm} \), so the radius \( r = 1.5 \, \text{cm} = 0.015 \, \text{m} \). The cross-sectional area is:

\[
A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.015)^2 = \pi (0.000225) \approx 0.000706858 \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the inductance \( L \)
Substitute the values into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = \frac{\mu_0 N^2 A}{l} = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) (1000)^2 (0.000706858)}{0.3}
\]

First, calculate \( \mu_0 N^2 A \):

\[
\mu_0 N^2 A = (4\pi \times 10^{-7}) (1000)^2 (0.000706858) \approx 0.000888 \, \text{H}
\]

Now divide by \( l = 0.3 \, \text{m} \):

\[
L = \frac{0.000888}{0.3} \approx 0.00296 \, \text{H}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the energy \( U \)
Using the formula \( U = \frac{1}{2} L I^2 \), substitute \( L = 0.00296 \, \text{H} \) and \( I = 10 \, \text{A} \):

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} (0.00296) (10)^2 = \frac{1}{2} (0.00296) (100) = 0.148 \, \text{J}
\]

### Final Answer
The energy stored in the magnetic field of the solenoid is approximately \( 0.15 \, \text{J} \). Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**G: 0.15 J**
