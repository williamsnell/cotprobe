Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, there are two parts here, (a) and (b), each comparing different discount series to a single rate. I need to figure out which option is correct.

Starting with part (a): The two discount series are 30-10-2(1/2)% and 25-15-2%. I remember that in discount series, each discount is applied cumulatively. So, each series is a series of discounts that are compounded over time.

I think the way to compare these is to calculate the overall discount factor for each series and then compare them to the single rate. The better series would be the one that gives a higher effective discount, meaning a lower remaining value.

Let me break down the first series: 30-10-2(1/2)%.

Wait, the notation is a bit confusing. I think the numbers before the % are the discount rates, and the last part is the series of discounts on top of each other. So, the series is 30, 10, 2, (1/2). So, each of these is a discount rate applied to the remaining amount.

So, the first discount is 30%, then the next is 10% on the new amount, then 2%, and finally 1/2% on that new amount. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Wait, I think the correct way is that each discount is applied sequentially, so each is subtracted from the remaining amount. So, the first discount is 30%, so the remaining is 70% of the original. Then the next discount is 10% on that 70%, so 70% * 90% = 63%. Then 2% discount on 63%: 63% * 98% = 61.74%. Then (1/2)% on that: 61.74% * 99.5% ≈ 61.74 * 0.995 ≈ 61.4073%. That's the remaining value. So the total discount is 100% - 61.4073% ≈ 38.5927%.

Now the second series: 25-15-2%. So, let's compute that. Starting with 100%, first discount is 25%, so 75% remains. Then 15% discount: 75% * 85% = 63.75%. Then 2% discount: 63.75% * 98% ≈ 63.75 * 0.98 ≈ 62.475%. So the remaining value is 62.475%. Total discount is 100% - 62.475% ≈ 37.525%.

Wait, but wait a second—this seems different. Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the first series.

Wait, the first series is 30-10-2(1/2)%. So the first discount is 30%: 70% remains. Second discount is 10%: 70% * 90% = 63%. Third is 2%: 63% * 98% = 61.74%. The last part is (1/2)%: 61.74% * 99.5% ≈ 61.4073%. So the remaining is 61.4073%, so the total discount is 100% - 61.4073% ≈ 38.5927%.

The second series is 25-15-2%. So, 75% after first discount, then 85% after second (75 * 0.85 = 63.75%), then 98% after third (63.75 * 0.98 ≈ 62.475%). So the remaining is 62.475%, total discount 37.525%.

Wait, so the first series gives a higher remaining value, so a lower discount. So the 30-10-2(1/2)% series is better than the 25-15-2% series. So, in part (a), the better series is 30-10-2(1/2)%.

Now, part (b) is comparing 15-15% and a single rate of 30%. So, again, I need to find the effective discount.

The discount series is 15-15%, which means 15% first, then another 15% on the remaining. So:

Start with 100%:
After 15% discount: 85% remains.
After another 15% discount: 85% * 85% = 72.25%. So the remaining value is 72.25%, so total discount is 27.75%.

The single rate of 30% would mean a discount of 30%, so remaining value of 70%.

Comparing both, 72.25% is higher than 70%, so the series 15-15% is better than the single rate of 30%. So part (b) says the series 15-15% is better.

Wait, no. Wait, in part (b) the question is which is better: the series of 15-15%, or the single rate of 30%. Since the series gives a higher remaining value (72.25% > 70%), the series is better. So in part (b), the series 15-15% is better.

Now, looking back at the options, the options are A through J, each combining parts (a) and (b). Let me look at each option.

Option A: The series 30-10-2(1/2)% and the single rate of 25% are better. Wait, wait, part (a) says 30-10-2(1/2)% is better, but part (b) says 15-15% is better. So option A suggests the first series is better, and a single rate of 25%. But that can't be right because part (b) says the series 15-15% is better. So option A is wrong.

Option B: The single rate of 25% and the series 15-15% are better. Wait, in part (a), the 30-10-2(1/2)% is better, not the 25%. So this option is incorrect because part (a) says the series is better.

Option C: The series 30-10-2(1/2)% and the series 15-15% are better. That's possible because in part (a) the series is better and in part (b) the series is better as well.

Option D: The series 25-15-2% and the single rate of 30% are better. From part (a), the 30-10-2(1/2)% is better than 25-15-2%. Wait, no—what's the relative performance? Earlier, in part (a), 30-10-2(1/2)% gave 61.4073%, while 25-15-2% gave 62.475%. Wait, wait, no:

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating part (a). Let me recalculate.

Wait, in part (a), the first series is 30-10-2(1/2)%.

Wait, perhaps the notation is different. Maybe the discounts are applied cumulatively, so each discount is subtracted from the current value.

Wait, the first series is 30-10-2(1/2)%. So, the first discount is 30%, so remaining is 70%. Then 10% discount on that, so 70 * 0.9 = 63%. Then 2% discount on that: 63 * 0.98 = 61.74%. Then (1/2)% discount on that: 61.74 * 0.995 = approximately 61.4073%. So the remaining value is about 61.4073%. So the overall discount is 38.5927%.

The second series is 25-15-2%. That is 75% * 0.85 = 63.75% after first two discounts. Then 98% on that: 63.75 * 0.98 = 62.475%. So remaining is 62.475%, discount is 37.525%.

So 30-10 is better than 25-15-2%. Wait, but part (a) says which is better. So the series 30-10-2(1/2)% is better than 25-15-2%.

In part (b), 15-15% is better than 30%.

So the options are:

A: 30-10-2% and 25% single rate. But part (a) says the series is better, so A is wrong.

B: single rate 25% and series 15-15%. But part (a) says series 30-10-2% is better, which is not 25%. So B is wrong.

C: series 30-10-2% and series 15-15% are better. So in part (a), the series is better, and in part (b), the series is better. So yes, that's correct. So C is correct.

Wait, but what about part (b)? The options in C say "the series 30-10-2% and the series 15-15% are better." So that would fit, since in part (a) the series 30-10-2% is better, and in part (b) the series 15-15% is better.

So option C is correct.

The problem involves comparing two discount series and determining which is better. The analysis proceeds as follows:

(a) For the series 30-10-2(1/2)%:
- The remaining value is 61.4073%.
- Total discount: 38.5927%.

For the series 25-15-2%:
- The remaining value is 62.475%.
- Total discount: 37.525%.

**Conclusion for part (a):** The series 30-10-2(1/2)% is better.

(b) For the series 15-15%:
- The remaining value is 72.25%.
- Total discount: 27.75%.

For the single rate of 30%:
- The remaining value is 70%.
- Total discount: 30%.

**Conclusion for part (b):** The series 15-15% is better.

**Evaluation of options:**
- **A:** Incorrect. Part (a) states the series 30-10-2(1/2)% is better, not the series 25-15-2%.
