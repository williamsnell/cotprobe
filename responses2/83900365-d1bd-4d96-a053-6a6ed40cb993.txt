Question:

Rawls argues that parties in the original position would not accept utilitarianism because:

Options:

A: it is too difficult to determine which policies would maximize happiness.
B: doing so would be too risky.
C: it requires us to do unjust things, such as executing innocent people.
D: they would be behind the veil of ignorance and thus would never have heard of utilitarianism.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Rawls and the original position. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about why Rawls would argue that parties in the original position wouldn't accept utilitarianism. The options are A to D. I remember Rawls talked a lot about original position and the principle of justice. So, the original position is when no one has control over the outcome, like in a society without any power to decide what's right.

So, the idea is that if parties are in the original position, they can't really make decisions because there's no authority or power over the outcome. That's where Rawls probably makes a point. He might say that utilitarianism requires a lot of deliberation, like choosing policies to maximize happiness, which could be too risky because it's impractical and would involve a lot of moral uncertainty.

Looking at the options:

A: It's too difficult to determine policies to maximize happiness. I think this makes sense because in the original position, there's no guidance, so it's hard to know which policy would lead to the best outcome. That's a valid point.

B: Doing so would be too risky. This is another good point because implementing policies to maximize happiness in the original position isn't feasible. It's risky because it depends on predicting the future and ensuring all possible outcomes are considered, which is impossible.

C: It requires us to do unjust things, like executing innocent people. No, I don't think that's how Rawls was speaking. He was more about justice and fairness, not about specific actions like execution. So I don't think C is correct.

D: They would be behind the veil of ignorance and thus would never have heard of utilitarianism. Wait, the veil of ignorance is the idea that a person might not have personal knowledge of all the facts, so even if they knew about utilitarianism, they wouldn't recognize it because they don't have the necessary information. But Rawls's argument here is about whether people in the original position would accept utilitarianism. He might argue that in the original position, there's no way to know what's right, so utilitarianism can't be accepted. But this option is about the original position leading to ignorance, not the acceptability of the theory itself. So I'm not sure if D is the right choice here.

Putting it together, I think A and B are both correct points. But the question is asking which option is correct. Let me recall if I remember the exact reasoning. Rawls probably says that in the original position, it's too difficult to determine the policies because there's no way to know which one would maximize happiness. Additionally, doing so could be too risky, as predicting the best outcome is impractical. So both A and B are correct, but the question only allows for one option to be chosen.

Wait, the question is which option is correct. So if I have to choose between A and B, which is the best answer? The question is about why Rawls would argue against utilitarianism in the original position. So both A and B are reasons. But the options are separate.

Looking back, the original position is a state of no power. Rawls talks about the original position in the context of justice. He might argue that in the original position, it's impossible to determine the best policies because there's no authority. So the parties can't evaluate the best course of action, which would require deliberation. So that's option A.

Alternatively, option B says doing so would be too risky. But maybe the argument is that it's impractical because you can't know what's best. So perhaps A is the more direct point.

Wait, I think the correct answer is A: it's too difficult to determine which policies would maximize happiness. Because in the original position, there's no way to know, making it impossible to maximize happiness without risking the wrong choice.

So the answer should be A.
</think>

The correct answer is A: it is too difficult to determine which policies would maximize happiness. 

Rawls argues that in the original position, where there is no authority or power to dictate the outcome, it is impractical to evaluate policies to maximize happiness. This difficulty arises because there is no way to predict the best outcome, making the process too risky and impractical.

Answer: A
