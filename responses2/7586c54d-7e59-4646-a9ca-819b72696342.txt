Okay, I'm trying to figure out which of the given options is not a non-coding RNA. So, the question is about different types of RNAs and whether they are coding or non-coding, specifically looking for non-coding RNA.

Let me start by recalling what I know about RNA types. I remember that RNA can be classified into different categories, such as tRNA, rRNA, miRNA, siRNA, miRNA (which I think is another name for miRNA), and so on.

First, I know that tRNA (transfer RNA) is definitely a type of RNA. It's part of the ribosomal RNA complex and helps in protein synthesis. So tRNA is a coding RNA because it encodes for specific proteins. So option E (tRNA) is a coding RNA, not the answer we're looking for.

Next, rRNA (ribosomal RNA) is another type of RNA. It's involved in the structure of ribosomes and is also a coding RNA because it encodes for proteins. So option C (rRNA) is coding, not the answer.

miRNA stands for microRNA. I think it's a type of small RNA that can bind to mRNA and regulate gene expression. Since it's involved in regulating gene expression, it's a non-coding RNA. So option F (miRNA) is non-coding, which makes it a candidate for the answer.

Looking at siRNA, which stands for small interfering RNA. It's similar to miRNA in that it's involved in gene regulation. I believe it's also non-coding. So option D (siRNA) is non-coding, so it's not the correct answer.

Now, miRNA is another name for the same class as miRNA. So that's covered.

Next, miRNA (option F) is definitely non-coding.

gRNA, which stands for guanosine nucleotide RNA, I think is a type of non-coding RNA. It's involved in RNA interference and regulation of gene expression. So option J (gRNA) is non-coding.

Looking at lncRNA (option A), it's long non-coding RNA. It doesn't code for proteins but plays a role in various cellular processes. So option A is non-coding.

siRNA (option D) is non-coding.

tRNA (option E) is coding.

rRNA (option C) is coding.

miRNA (option F) is non-coding.

gRNA (option J) is non-coding.

So the options left are lncRNA (A) and mRNA (I). Let's see, mRNA is a type of RNA that does code for proteins. So option I (mRNA) is definitely a coding RNA.

So the non-coding RNAs in the options are F, D, J, and J (wait, no, J is another option). Wait, the options are A to J. So the non-coding RNAs are F, D, J. The question asks which is not a non-coding RNA. So the answer is the one that's coding. 

The options are:

A: lncRNA (non-coding)
B: piRNA (non-coding)
C: rRNA (coding)
D: siRNA (non-coding)
E: tRNA (coding)
F: miRNA (non-coding)
G: siRNA (non-coding)
H: Ribozyme (I think this is a type of RNA, but I'm not certain. Ribozymes are RNA molecules capable of catalyzing chemical reactions. They don't code for proteins, so they're non-coding. So option H is non-coding.
I: mRNA (coding)
J: gRNA (non-coding)

Wait, so the question is which is not a non-coding RNA. So the options that are non-coding are A, B, D, F, G, J, H, I. The only one not in this list is option I, which is mRNA (coding), so it's the non-coding RNA that is not listed as a non-coding RNA. So the question is asking which is NOT a non-coding RNA. So the correct answer is the one that's coding, which is mRNA.

Wait, but wait. The options are: the question is which is not a non-coding RNA. So the answer is the RNA that is coding.

Looking back, the options are:

A: lncRNA (non-coding)
B: piRNA (non-coding)
C: rRNA (coding)
D: siRNA (non-coding)
E: tRNA (coding)
F: miRNA (non-coding)
G: siRNA (non-coding)
H: Ribozyme (non-coding)
I: mRNA (coding)
J: gRNA (non-coding)

So the non-coding RNAs are options C, E, F, G, J, H, I.

The question is which is not a non-coding RNA. So the answer must be the one that is coding. So among the options, I (mRNA) is the only one that is coding. So the answer is I, which is option I. But wait, the options are labeled A to J, and the question is which is not a non-coding RNA. So the answer would be the coding RNA, which is option I, mRNA. So the correct answer is option I. But wait, looking back at the options, the choices for the answer are A to J, each as a possible answer.

Wait, wait, the options are:

A: lncRNA
B: piRNA
C: rRNA
D: siRNA
E: tRNA
F: miRNA
G: siRNA
H: Ribozyme
I: mRNA
J: gRNA

So the options are the types, and the question is which is not a non-coding RNA. So the list of answers to the question are which of the following is non-coding? No, wait, the question is phrased: "Which of the following is not a non-coding RNA?" So the correct answer is the one that is a coding RNA.

The options are C (rRNA), E (tRNA), F (miRNA), G (siRNA), J (gRNA), H (Ribozyme), and I (mRNA). So the non-coding are A, B, D, F, G, J, H, I. Only I is coding. So the correct answer is I, which is option I.

Wait, but the options are labeled A to J, so the answer must be one of those letters. So the question is, which is not a non-coding RNA. So the correct answer is option I, which is mRNA, which is a coding RNA. So the correct answer letter is I. But let me double-check the options again.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I confused which are non-coding.

Wait, miRNA is non-coding, siRNA is non-coding, gRNA non-coding. RNA types like lncRNA, piRNA, rRNA, tRNA, miRNA, siRNA, gRNA â€” these are all non-coding. So the only coding RNA is mRNA (I). So the answer is I. So the letter is I, which is option I.

To determine which of the given options is not a non-coding RNA, we need to analyze each type of RNA:

1. **lncRNA (A)**: Long non-coding RNA. It does not code for proteins but has regulatory roles.
2. **piRNA (B)**: Piwi-interacting RNA. It is non-coding and involved in RNA interference.
3. **rRNA (C)**: Ribosomal RNA. It is a coding RNA that encodes for proteins.
4. **siRNA (D)**: Small interfering RNA. It is non-coding and also involved in gene regulation.
5. **tRNA (E)**: Transfer RNA. It is a coding RNA that encodes for proteins.
6. **miRNA (F)**: MicroRNA. It is non-coding and regulates gene expression.
7. **gRNA (J)**: Guanosine nucleotide RNA. It is non-coding and plays roles in RNA interference.
8. **Ribozyme (H)**: RNA capable of catalyzing chemical reactions. It is non-coding.
9. **mRNA (I)**: RNA that codes for proteins. It is a coding RNA.
10. **siRNA (D)**: Already listed as non-coding.

The question asks which of these is **not a non-coding RNA**. Since mRNA (I) codes for proteins, it is the only coding RNA listed. Therefore, the correct answer is **I: mRNA**, as it is the non-coding RNA that is not listed as a non-coding RNA.

**ANSWER: I**
