Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I have the function f(x) = [(x - 2)^2 - 9]/3, and I need to find the area of the polygon formed by connecting the x- and y-intercepts of its graph. Hmm, okay, so first things first, I should find where the graph intersects the x-axis and the y-axis.

Starting with the y-intercept. The y-intercept occurs where x = 0. So I'll plug in x = 0 into the function. Let me compute that:

f(0) = [(0 - 2)^2 - 9]/3
= [4 - 9]/3
= (-5)/3
= -5/3.

So the y-intercept is at (0, -5/3). Wait, that's negative, so it's below the x-axis. Hmm, okay, that's settled.

Next, let's find the x-intercepts. The x-intercepts happen where y = 0, so I set f(x) = 0 and solve for x:

[(x - 2)^2 - 9]/3 = 0.

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:
(x - 2)^2 - 9 = 0
=> (x - 2)^2 = 9.

Take the square root of both sides:
x - 2 = ±3.

So x = 2 ± 3. That gives two solutions:
x = 2 + 3 = 5,
x = 2 - 3 = -1.

Therefore, the x-intercepts are at (5, 0) and (-1, 0). 

So now I have three points: two x-intercepts at (-1,0) and (5,0), and the y-intercept at (0, -5/3). Wait, but the problem says to connect the x- and y-intercepts to form a polygon. Hmm, so which points are being connected? Let me visualize this.

The x-intercepts are on the x-axis, and the y-intercept is on the y-axis. So connecting these three points would form a triangle. Because three points not on the same line will form a triangle. So the polygon we're talking about is a triangle with vertices at (-1, 0), (5, 0), and (0, -5/3). 

To find the area of this triangle, I can use the formula for the area of a triangle given three vertices. Alternatively, since two of the points are on the x-axis, I can use the base and height approach. Let me think.

The base can be the distance between the two x-intercepts. The x-intercepts are at x = -1 and x = 5, so the distance between them is 5 - (-1) = 6 units. That's the base.

The height is the distance from the y-intercept to the x-axis, which is the absolute value of the y-coordinate of the y-intercept. The y-intercept is at (0, -5/3), so the height is |-5/3| = 5/3 units.

Wait, but actually, in the formula, the area is (base * height)/2. So if I take the base as 6 and the height as 5/3, then the area would be (6 * (5/3))/2. Let me compute that.

6 * 5/3 = 30/3 = 10. Then, 10 divided by 2 is 5. So the area is 5. Hmm, that's one of the options. Let me check if that makes sense.

Alternatively, using the coordinate points to calculate the area. The formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) is:

Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|.

Plugging in the points (-1, 0), (5, 0), (0, -5/3):

Compute each term:

First term: (-1)*(0 - (-5/3)) = (-1)*(5/3) = -5/3

Second term: 5*((-5/3) - 0) = 5*(-5/3) = -25/3

Third term: 0*(0 - 0) = 0

Sum these: (-5/3) + (-25/3) + 0 = (-30/3) = -10.

Take the absolute value and divide by 2: | -10 | /2 = 10/2 = 5.

So that confirms the area is 5. So looking back at the options, option B is 5. So I think the answer is B.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the polygon correctly. The problem says the x- and y-intercepts are connected to form a polygon. So maybe it's a triangle, but perhaps more points? Wait, no, the x-intercepts are two points on the x-axis, and the y-intercept is one point on the y-axis. So connecting them would form a triangle with three vertices, which is what I considered. So the area is indeed 5.

I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. The base is 6, height is 5/3, area is 5. So the answer is 5, which is option B.

The area of the triangle formed by the intercepts is calculated as follows:

- **Y-intercept**: (0, -5/3)
- **X-intercepts**: (-1, 0) and (5, 0)

Using the base as the distance between the x-intercepts (6 units) and the height as the absolute y-coordinate of the y-intercept (5/3):

Area = (base × height)/2 = (6 × 5/3)/2 = 5.
