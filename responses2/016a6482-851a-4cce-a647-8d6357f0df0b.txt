Question:

A man conveyed land by quitclaim deed as a gift to his cousin, who did not then record the deed or take possession of the land. Six months later, when the man was still in possession, he conveyed the land by quitclaim deed as a gift to a friend, who knew nothing of the deed to the cousin. The friend did not record his deed. The man then vacated the land, and the friend took possession. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides as follows: "No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record." Recently, the cousin learned about the friend's deed and possession, immediately recorded her deed, and sued the friend for possession and to quiet title. The friend then recorded his deed and raised all available defenses. For whom is the court likely to decide?

Options:

A: For the friend, because the cousin did not take possession of the land.
B: For the friend, because the cousin did not record her deed in time.
C: For the cousin, because she has the original deed.
D: For the friend, because a subsequent good- faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.
E: For the cousin, because the friend failed to first record.
F: For the cousin, because the friend did not pay for the land.
G: For the cousin, because the man had already given the land away before giving it to the friend.
H: For the friend, because he was first in possession.
I: For the friend, because he was not aware of the previous deed.
J: For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser.

Okay, so I have this property law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

So, a man conveys land by quitclaim deed to his cousin. But the cousin didn't record the deed or take possession yet. Six months later, he conveys again, but to a friend who didn't know about it. The friend didn't record either. Then the man vacated the land, and the friend took it. The recording law says that no unrecorded conveyance or mortgage can be against subsequent purchasers without notice, who must first record. Now, the cousin learned about the friend's deed and immediately recorded, then sued the friend.

So, the question is, who gets the court's decision? The options are A to J.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to recall the rules about quitclaim deeds and recording. So, when a person conveys land by quitclaim deed, it's not recorded until the property is actually used. The initial conveyance is the original deed, and any subsequent deeds are considered subsequent conveyances.

Wait, but after the initial conveyance, the property is in the owner's possession. So the initial conveyance is not recorded until they use it. But in this case, the man gave the cousin a quitclaim deed, which is the original conveyance. So, that's the original deed. Then, six months later, he gave the friend a quitclaim deed again, which is a subsequent conveyance.

So, the cousin didn't record her deed until... when? Wait, no: the cousin didn't record, but according to the recording act, the recording must be done by the purchaser. So, the cousin didn't record her deed because she didn't take possession. So, she had the original deed but didn't record it. Then, six months after that, when the man gave the friend a quitclaim deed, the friend didn't record either. Then, the man vacated the land, so the friend took possession.

Wait, but in the recording law, the recording is required by the purchaser. So, the original conveyance is from the man to his cousin. The cousin didn't record her deed because she didn't take possession. But wait, no, wait: the cousin didn't take possession. The cousin didn't record her deed because she didn't take possession. Because the recording must be by the purchaser (the original owner, right?), so the cousin didn't record.

Then, six months later, the man conveys to his friend. The friend didn't record, because the friend didn't know about the deed. So, his deed is a subsequent conveyance without recording. The friend later takes possession, then the recording law comes into play.

Now, the cousin learns about the friend's deed and immediately records her. So the cousin recorded her deed before the friend did. But the friend didn't record his because he didn't know about it.

So the question is, who is liable for possession?

The cousin records her deed first, but she didn't take possession. The friend didn't record, but he took possession.

Wait, but the friend's deed is a subsequent conveyance, so he's a subsequent owner. The recording must be done by the subsequent owner. But the friend didn't record, which may cause him to lose his right to possession.

Alternatively, the cousin's original deed (original conveyance) was not recorded, so her interest is not yet recorded. But then she recorded her own deed, which is her subsequent deed, but she didn't have the right to do so because she didn't take possession. So, perhaps she can't claim the right to possession because she didn't take possession, but she recorded hers.

But wait, the cousin's deed was given to the friend, but she didn't take possession. So, the friend's possession is when he takes it. The friend then records his deed, but since he's a subsequent owner, the recording must be done by him, right?

But the recording act requires that the purchaser (subsequent owner) must record. So, if the friend didn't record, then he can't claim possession because his deed is unrecorded. But wait, the friend later records his deed. So, when he records, he's the one doing the recording, which should be sufficient. But wait, the recording act says that an unrecorded conveyance cannot be against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who must first record. So, the friend's deed is unrecorded, so the friend can't record, but in this case, he did. So, the friend's deed is unrecorded, so the friend's interest is unrecorded and thus not subject to the recording requirement. Wait, no. The recording act says that any subsequent conveyance must be recorded by the purchaser. So, if the friend didn't record his deed, that's a problem, because he's a subsequent owner, so he needs to record. But the friend did record his deed, so that's okay.

So, the friend's deed is unrecorded because he didn't record it himself. So, the recording act would say that this unrecorded deed can't be used against subsequent purchasers for value without notice. But the friend's deed is unrecorded, so the friend can't record. Wait, no: Wait, the friend didn't record. So, the friend's deed hasn't been recorded, meaning that the friend's ownership is unrecorded. So, the friend's deed is unrecorded, so he can't be recorded, but he did record his deed. So, that's contradictory. Because the friend didn't record his deed, but he did the recording himself. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me clarify. The recording act says that any subsequent conveyance (i.e., after the initial conveyance) must be recorded by the purchaser. So, the friend is a subsequent owner, so he must record his deed. But the friend didn't record it himself. So, the friend's deed is unrecorded. Therefore, the friend's interest is unrecorded. So, the friend cannot record his deed. But in the facts, the friend did record his deed. So, that can't be right. So, perhaps I'm understanding something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the friend's deed is unrecorded because he didn't record it. But the friend did record it, so he's a subsequent owner, but his deed is unrecorded, meaning that his deed is unrecorded. So, in that case, the friend's deed is unrecorded, so he can't record it. But the friend did record it. So, this seems contradictory. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the friend didn't record his deed, but he later did. But the recording act requires that the purchaser record. So, he didn't record it, but he later did. But that's a mistake in recording. But the question states that the friend did record his deed. So, that's correct.

So, in that case, the friend's deed is unrecorded because he didn't record it himself, but he did later. So, when he later records it, that fulfills his obligation to record. Because the recording act requires the purchaser to record. So, the friend's deed is unrecorded because he didn't record it. But he later recorded it, so it's not a problem.

Therefore, the friend's deed is unrecorded, so he can't claim possession because the recording act says the subsequent owner must record. Since he didn't record, he can't do so. But the friend later recorded his deed. So, the recording act is fulfilled.

Wait, but the friend's deed is unrecorded because he didn't record it. So, when the friend later records it, he's doing the required step. So, that's not a problem.

So, the friend can't record the deed because he didn't record it himself. But he did, so it's okay. So, the friend's deed is unrecorded, so he can't record, but he did, so it's okay. So, the friend's interest is unrecorded, which means that the court can't prevent the friend from taking possession without recording.

But, the cousin's original deed was unrecorded because she didn't take possession. She recorded hers after the friend took possession. So, the cousin's deed is unrecorded because she didn't take possession. So, when the friend took possession, the cousin's deed was not yet recorded, but she recorded hers later.

Wait, but when the friend took possession, the friend records his deed. So, the friend's deed is now recorded. So, the friend's interest is recorded. But the cousin's original deed is unrecorded because she didn't take possession. So, if the friend claims the cousin's original deed, the court would have to consider whether the recording act applies.

Wait, the recordation act says that a subsequent owner must record their deed. So, the friend is a subsequent owner, so the recording must be done. Since the friend did record his deed, that's correct. But the cousin's original deed hasn't been recorded, because she didn't take possession. So, the cousin's original deed is unrecorded.

So, when the friend records his deed, he's the one doing the recording, which is required for subsequent owners. So, the court can't prevent the friend from using the recording for his purposes.

Wait, the recording act says that an unrecorded conveyance cannot be used against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who must first record. So, if the friend's deed is unrecorded (because he didn't record it before), but he later records it, then the recording act is satisfied. So, the friend's interest is recorded, but it's unrecorded at the time of the friend's possession. So, the court can't prevent the friend from using the recording because the recording was done by the subsequent owner.

So, the friend can take possession. But wait, the friend's deed is unrecorded because he didn't record it before. So, when he later records it, that's sufficient because the recording act requires the purchaser (subsequent owner) to record. So, the friend is a subsequent owner, so he must record. So, he did, which is correct.

Now, the question is, who is entitled to possession? The friend's deed is unrecorded at the time of his possession, so the friend can't record, but he did record it. So, the friend can use his recorded deed against any subsequent owners, including the cousin, because the recording is done by him. Wait, no. Wait, the recording is done by the subsequent owner, not the original owner. So, the cousin's original deed was unrecorded because she didn't take possession. So, when the friend takes possession, the cousin's original deed is still unrecorded. So, the friend can't claim the cousin's original deed because the cousin didn't record hers. The friend's deed is unrecorded when he takes possession, but when he later records it, that's okay.

So, the friend can record his deed because he's a subsequent owner. So, the friend's deed is now recorded, and he's the one who's responsible for the subsequent owners. So, the friend's deed can be used against the subsequent owner (the cousin) because the recording was done by him. But wait, the recording act requires that the purchaser (subsequent owner) records. So, the friend is the subsequent owner, so he must record. So, he did, and that's sufficient.

But the cousin's original deed was not recorded because she didn't take possession. So, the cousin's deed is unrecorded. So, when the friend takes possession, and the friend records his deed, the recording is for his use, not the cousin's.

Now, the cousin recorded her deed after the friend took possession. So, the cousin's deed was unrecorded when the friend took possession, so she can't claim it because the recording act requires the subsequent owner (the friend) to record. But the friend later recorded his deed, which is sufficient. So, the friend's deed is recorded and is valid against any subsequent owners, including the cousin, because the recording was done by the friend.

Wait, but the cousin's original deed is unrecorded, so she can't use the friend's recorded deed against her because that's the original deed. The recording act says that only subsequent owners can record. So, the friend did record, which is correct.

So, the friend's deed is recorded, so he can use it against the cousin. The cousin's original deed was unrecorded. So, the friend's recorded deed is against the cousin because the cousin didn't take possession.

Wait, but the cousin's original deed was not recorded because she didn't take possession. So, the cousin didn't record her deed. The friend later recorded his. So, the friend's recorded deed is against the cousin, because the cousin didn't take possession of it.

So, the court would likely decide that the friend is at fault because the cousin's original deed was unrecorded, and the friend recorded his own. But let me look at the options.

Options:

A: For the friend, because cousin didn't take possession. → No, cousin didn't take possession, so this is not correct.

B: For the friend, because cousin didn't record her deed in time. → The cousin didn't record her deed because she didn't take possession. So, the friend didn't record either, but he did later. So, that's not the reason.

C: For the cousin, because she has the original deed. → No, the friend recorded his own deed.

D: For the friend, because a subsequent donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record. → I'm not sure about this. The recording act says that a subsequent owner must record, so if the friend is a subsequent owner, he must record, which he did. But the original owner's deed (original deed) is not recorded.

Wait, the recording act says that the original owner's deed is unrecorded, so that's why the cousin can't record her deed. The friend recorded his own deed, which is a subsequent owner, so that's correct.

So, the friend's recorded deed is against the cousin. So, the court would likely decide for the friend because the cousin's original deed was unrecorded and the friend recorded his own deed. So, the friend's recorded deed is valid against the cousin's unrecorded deed.

So, the answer would be D: for the friend because a subsequent donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.

Wait, but the friend did record his own deed. So, perhaps it's the cousin who didn't record her deed, so the friend is at fault.

Looking at the options, D says "because a subsequent donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record." So, the prior donee (the cousin) failed to record her deed, which is a prior donee who fails to record. The subsequent donee (the friend) recorded his deed. So, the friend's recorded deed is against the prior donee's unrecorded deed. So, the friend's deed is recorded, and thus the court will decide that the friend is at fault because the prior donee's deed was unrecorded, and the friend recorded his own deed.

So, option D would be correct.

The question revolves around the recording act in property law, which requires that subsequent owners record their deeds for the benefit of subsequent purchasers. Here's the analysis of the facts and options:

1. **Initial Conveyance**: The man conveys the land by quitclaim deed to his cousin, who does not record it. Since the recording act requires the purchaser (subsequent owner) to record, the cousin's original deed is unrecorded.

2. **Subsequent Conveyance**: Six months later, the man conveys the land by quitclaim deed to his friend, who also does not record it. The friend is a subsequent owner, so he must record his deed.

3. **Friend's Action**: The friend later records his deed. While the friend's deed was initially unrecorded, the recording act requires the subsequent owner (the friend) to record. Recording is satisfied, and the friend's deed is now recorded.

4. **Cousin's Deed**: The cousin's original deed was unrecorded because she did not take possession. The recording act requires subsequent owners (the friend) to record their deeds. The friend's recorded deed is valid against the cousin's unrecorded deed because the friend is a subsequent owner.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A**: Incorrect. The cousin did take possession, not the friend.
   - **B**: Incorrect. The cousin did not record her deed because she did not take possession.
   - **C**: Incorrect. The cousin did not have the original deed.
   - **D**: Correct. The cousin failed to record her deed, a prior donee who fails to record (the cousin) has priority over a subsequent donee (the friend) who records. The friend's recorded deed is valid against the cousin's unrecorded deed.
   - **E** and **F** and **G**: Incorrect. The friend's recorded deed is valid against the cousin's unrecorded deed.
   - **H**: Incorrect. The friend did not record his deed; he did.
   - **J**: Incorrect. The friend was not first in possession.

The court will likely decide that the friend is at fault because the cousin's original deed was unrecorded, and the friend recorded his deed. This aligns with the recording act's requirement that subsequent owners record their deeds.
