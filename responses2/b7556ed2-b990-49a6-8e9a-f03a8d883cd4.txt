Okay, so I have this problem here about estimating how many more books the Mills Library has compared to the Springvale Library. Let's see. The problem states that Mills has 1,007,199 books and Springvale has 907,082 books. I need to find the difference between these two numbers and then choose the best estimate from the options provided.

First, I should probably subtract the number of books in Springvale from Mills. So, 1,007,199 minus 907,082. Hmm, let me do that calculation. Let me write it out:

1,007,199
- 907,082
= ?

Let me subtract step by step. Starting from the right:

9 - 2 =7

9 -8 =1 (but wait, actually, the numbers are ...199 and ...082, right? Let me line them up properly.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of both numbers as approximately 1,007,200 and 907,080 for estimation. That might make the subtraction easier.

So, 1,007,200 minus 907,080 is... 100,120? Let me check. 

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact difference first. Let me compute 1,007,199 - 907,082.

1,007,199 minus 907,082. Let me subtract the thousands, millions, etc.:

1,007,199 is 1 million and 7 thousand and 199. 907,082 is 907 thousand and 82. So, subtracting:

1,007,199 is 1,007,199
-907,082
= ?

I can do this digit by digit.

But perhaps it's easier to subtract 907,082 from 1,007,199.

Wait, let me try to compute it step by step:

1,007,199
-907,082
= ?

Starting from the right:

9 - 2 =7

9 -8 =1

1 (the ten-thousands place) minus 0 =1

7 minus 7 =0

The next digits: 0 minus 0 is 0, and then 1 minus 9? Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me subtract each place.

Wait, perhaps it's better to break it down into parts. Let's see:

1,007,199 is 1,000,000 + 7,000 + 199.

907,082 is 900,000 +7,000 +82.

So, subtracting:

1,000,000 - 900,000 = 100,000.

7,000 -7,000=0.

199 -82=117.

So the total is 100,000 + 0 +117= 100,117.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 907,082 is larger than 900,000 but 7,000 is the same, so the thousands might affect differently. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me try again.

Let me write it down as:

1,007,199
-907,082
= ?

Let me subtract each digit:

Starting from the units place:

9 -2 =7

9 -8=1 (tens place)

1 -0=1 (hundreds place)

7 (thousands place) -7=0 (thousands place)

0 (ten thousands place) -0=0

1 (hundred thousands place) -9= Hmm, but 1 is less than 9. So I need to borrow from the next higher place.

Wait, that's not possible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let's try another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact difference is 100,117. Let me check with exact subtraction:

1,007,199
- 907,082
= 100,117.

Wait, that seems correct. So the exact difference is 100,117 books.

Wait, but the question is asking for an estimate. So perhaps the exact difference is 100,117, but the options are in thousands, like 200,000 or 10,000, etc. So let's see which option is closest.

Wait, but the options are in thousands, so the choices are: 200,000; 20,000; 120,000; 10,000; 8,000; 80,000; etc.

Wait, the exact difference is 100,117. The options are A:200k, B:20k, C:120k, D:10k, E:8k, F:90k, G:100k, H:50k, I:8k, J:80k.

So the closest is either 100k (option G) or 10k (option D). Since 100,117 is about 100k, which is option G. Alternatively, option D is 10k, which is way too low.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should consider if the exact difference is approximately 100,117. So the nearest option would be 100,117. But the options don't have 100,117. The closest is 100,000, which is option G.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Oh wait, option G is 100,000 books. So the estimated difference is about 100,117, which is approximately 100,000. So the best estimate is 100,000, which is option G.

Wait, but in the options, option H is 50,000 and I is 8,000. Wait, but 100,000 is much closer to option G than any of those. So the correct answer would be option G: 100,000 books.

The exact difference between the two libraries is 100,117 books. Among the options provided, the closest estimate is 100,000 books, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
