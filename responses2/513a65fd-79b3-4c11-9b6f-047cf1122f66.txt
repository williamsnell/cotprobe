Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about escape velocity and root mean square (rms) velocity for hydrogen gas. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

The question is asking at what temperature the rms velocity of H2 equals the escape velocity of the Earth. Oh wait, the escape velocity is given as 1.1e6 cm sec^-1. I remember the formula for escape velocity is sqrt(2GM/r), but wait, maybe I don't need the actual numbers here, just the relationship between escape velocity and the rms velocity.

The formula for rms velocity is sqrt(3kT/m), where k is Boltzmann's constant and m is the mass of the molecule. Right, because for each molecule, the kinetic energy is (3/2)kT, and since the rms is about the square root of the mean, that's where the 3/2 comes from.

So I need to set the rms velocity equal to the escape velocity and solve for T. So: sqrt(3kT/m) = escape velocity. Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root. That gives 3kT/m = (escape velocity)^2.

Wait, but m is the mass of the hydrogen molecule. H2 has two hydrogen atoms, each with mass ~1 amu. So the molar mass is 2 g/mol, but wait no, it's given as the atomic weight. Oh yeah, the problem says "at. wt: H = 1." So the molar mass M is 2 g/mol, since H2 is two atoms.

But wait, maybe I should carry units through. Let me think about the units. K is in Kelvin, T in Kelvin. The escape velocity is in cm/s, so let's make sure the units are compatible.

Wait, but the value for k is given in ergs per mole per Kelvin. Because 1 erg = 1 g cm^2/s^2. So if I'm using these units, I need to make sure I convert correctly.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Write the equation: (3kT/m) = (escape velocity)^2.
2. Solve for T: T = ( (escape velocity)^2 * m ) / (3k).

But I need to get all the units right. Let's break down the variables.

Escape velocity, v_esc = 1.1e6 cm/s.

Mass m of H2: Each H is 1 g/mol, so H2 is 2 g/mol. But since we're dealing with per molecule mass, we need to convert to grams per molecule. Because the ideal gas law uses moles.

So m = (2 g/mol) / (N_A) ), where N_A is Avogadro's number, 6.022e23 mol^-1. So m = 2/(6.022e23) g. Let's calculate that, but maybe I can keep it as 2/(N_A) grams per molecule.

Wait, k is Boltzmann's constant, which is R/(N_A). Because R is given as 8.3e7 erg/(mol·K) and R = kN_A. So R = kN_A, so k = R/(N_A). So substituting into the equation.

So let's plug in k = R/(N_A).

So T = ( (v_esc)^2 * m ) / (3 * (R/(N_A)) ) )

Simplify this equation:

T = (v_esc^2 * m * N_A) ) / (3 R )

Wait, m is in grams per molecule, so let's see. The m variable is 2/(N_A) grams per molecule.

So substituting m:

T = ( v_esc^2 * (2/(N_A)) * N_A ) / (3 R )

Hmm, wait the N_A cancels out.

Wait, m = 2/(N_A) grams per molecule. So m = 2/(N_A) g.

So substituting m into the equation:

T = [ (v_esc^2) * (2/(N_A)) ) * N_A ) ] / (3 R )

The N_A terms cancel, so T = (v_esc^2 * 2) / (3 R )

Wait, that's better.

So:

T = (2 v_esc^2) / (3 R )

Wait, but wait: the m is (2 g/mol) / Avogadro's number, so m = 2/(N_A) g. So putting that into the equation:

m = 2/(N_A) g.

So T = (v_esc^2 * m) / (3k) 

But k is R/(N_A), so:

T = (v_esc^2 * (2/(N_A)) ) / (3*(R/(N_A)) ) 

Which is (v_esc^2 * 2/(N_A)) ) * (N_A/(3 R) ) )

The N_A cancels out again, leading to T = (2 v_esc^2) / (3 R )

Wait, that's the same as before. So T = (2 v_esc^2) / (3 R )

Wait, but R is given in ergs per mole per Kelvin. So units: cm^-1 because:

v_esc is in cm/s, R is in erg/(mol·K) and erg is g cm^2/s^2. So let's make sure the units come together.

Wait, v_esc^2 is (cm/s)^2, R is erg/(mol K) = (g cm^2/s^2)/(mol K). Let's compute the units for (2 v_esc^2)/(3 R):

v_esc^2 is (cm²/s²). R is (g cm²)/(s² mol K).

( v² ) / R → (cm²/s²) / (g cm²/(s² mol K)) ) → ( (1/s²) * cm² ) / ( (g cm²)/(s² mol K) ) ) → (1/s²) * cm² * s² mol K / (g cm² )

The cm² cancels, s² cancels, so units become (1) * mol K / g.

Wait, but wait, T is in Kelvin. So perhaps I'm getting mixed up with units. Maybe it's easier to plug in the numbers directly, using appropriate unit conversions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for rms velocity in terms of temperature and molar mass.

Wait, another approach: The rms velocity is given by sqrt(3kT/m). So setting that equal to the escape velocity, sqrt(3kT/m) = v_esc.

Squaring both sides: 3kT/m = v_esc^2.

So solving for T: T = v_esc^2 * m / (3k)

But m is the molar mass, 2 g/mol, but I might want to express m in terms of grams per molecule.

So m = 2 g/mol * (1 mol / N_A) = 2/(N_A) g.

So substituting into T:

T = (v_esc^2 * (2/(N_A)) ) / (3 * (R/(N_A)) )

Because k is R/(N_A). So:

T = (v_esc^2 * 2/(N_A)) ) / (3 R/(N_A)) )

The N_A cancels again, so T = (2 v_esc^2) / (3 R) )

Yes, same as before.

So plugging in the numbers:

v_esc = 1.1e6 cm/s.

R is 8.3e7 erg/(mol·K).

Wait, let's compute T:

T = (2 * (1.1e6 cm/s)^2 ) / (3 * 8.3e7 erg/(mol·K) )

Wait, but I'm getting units here. Because (cm/s)^2 is cm²/s², R is erg/(mol·K) = (g cm²/s²) / (mol K). So:

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 2 * (1.1e6)^2 = 2 * 1.21e12 = 2.42e12 (cm²/s²).

Denominator: 3 * 8.3e7 = 24.9e7 (erg/(mol·K)).

Wait, but cm²/s² divided by erg/(mol·K) → let's see, cm²/(s²) * mol K / (erg).

But 1 erg is 1 g cm²/s².

So the denominator in terms of units:

3R = 3*(8.3e7 erg/(mol K)) = 24.9e7 erg/(mol K) = 24.9e7 (g cm²/(s² mol K)) ) / (mol K).

Wait, no, it's (erg/(mol·K)) ) → (g cm²/(s² mol K)).

So the denominator is 3R = 3 * (8.3e7 erg/(mol·K) ) = 24.9e7 (g cm²)/(s² mol K^2).

Wait no, perhaps better to compute the overall units. Let's make the numerator and denominator in compatible units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to choose to compute everything in base units.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for rms velocity in terms of temperature and molar mass.

The rms velocity is given by sqrt(3kT/m). So:

v_rms = sqrt( (3 k T) / m )

We want v_rms = v_esc.

So,

v_esc = sqrt(3kT/m) → v_esc^2 = 3kT/m → T = (m v_esc^2) / (3k)

But m is the molar mass, which is 2 g/mol. So m = 2 g/mol.

So T = (2 g/mol * (1.1e6 cm/s)^2 ) / (3 * k )

But k is R/(N_A). R is 8.3e7 erg/mol/K, and N_A is 6.022e23 mol^-1.

So substituting:

k = R/(N_A) = (8.3e7 erg/mol/K) / (6.022e23 mol^-1 ) = 8.3e7 / 6.022e23 erg/(K mol) → 1.378e-16 erg/(K)

Wait, erg is g cm²/s², so substituting into T.

But let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 2 g/mol * (1.1e6 cm/s)^2 = 2 * (1.21e12 cm²/s² ) * g/mol.

Denominator: 3 * k = 3 * (8.3e7 erg/mol/K) / (6.022e23 mol^-1 ) = 3 * (8.3e7 / 6.022e23) erg/(K) → 3 * (1.378e-16 erg/K) → 4.134e-16 erg/K.

Wait, so numerator is 2.42e12 * g cm²/(s²) * (1/mol), and denominator is 4.134e-16 erg/K.

Wait, but let me see, erg is g cm²/s². So denominator is (g cm²/s²) / K.

So the units for T would be (g cm²/s² * 1/mol ) / (g cm²/s² / K) ) → (1/mol) * (1/( (g cm²/s²) )) * (g cm²/s² / K) ) → 1/mol * (1/K) → 1/(mol K), which is not correct. Wait, this can't be right. What's going on?

Oh, wait, because m is in g/mol, and k has units erg/(mol K). So perhaps I should have considered the units differently.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck in the unit conversion. Maybe I should plug in the numbers and compute T numerically, then check the units.

So, T = (2 * (1.1e6)^2) / (3 * 8.3e7) )

Wait, but let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 2 * (1.1e6)^2 = 2 * (1.21e12) = 2.42e12.

Denominator: 3 * 8.3e7 = 24.9e7 = 2.49e8.

So T = 2.42e12 / 2.49e8 = (2.42/2.49) * 1e4 = approx 0.978e4 → 9780 K.

Wait, but the given options are much larger. Hmm, the options are 1.5e4, 1.2e4, etc. So maybe I made a mistake in the unit calculations.

Wait, wait. Another approach: Maybe I should compute T in terms of the formula, but using the correct units.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can use the formula for rms velocity in terms of temperature and molar mass.

Wait, the rms velocity is given by sqrt(3kT/m), and k is Boltzmann's constant. So if I solve for T, T = (m * v_esc^2 )/(3k).

But m is the molar mass, which is 2.016 g/mol (for H2). Wait, but wait, the atomic weight is 1, so H is 1 g/mol, so H2 is 2 g/mol.

So m = 2 g/mol.

So plug in the numbers:

T = (2 g/mol * (1.1e6 cm/s)^2 ) / (3 * 8.3e7 erg/(mol·K) )

Compute numerator: 2 * (1.21e12) = 2.42e12.

Denominator: 3 * 8.3e7 = 24.9e7.

Wait, but erg is g cm²/s². So the units would be:

( (g/mol) * (cm^2/s^2) ) / ( erg/(mol·K) ) )

= (g cm²/(s² mol) ) / (g cm²/(s² K) )

= (1/mol) * (K)

Wait, that gives K/(mol), which is not correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the units of R into erg/(g K) to make the calculation work.

Wait, R is given as 8.3e7 erg/mol·K.

So 1 erg = 1 g cm²/s². So 8.3e7 erg/(mol·K) = 8.3e7 (g cm²/(s² mol K)).

So, the denominator is (3 * 8.3e7) erg/(mol·K) ) → 24.9e7 erg/(mol·K).

Wait, but the numerator is:

(2 g/mol) * ( (1.1e6 cm/s)^2 ) = 2 * (1.21e12 cm²/s²) g/mol → 2.42e12 cm²/(s² mol).

So T = (2.42e12 / (3 * 8.3e7 )) * (g cm²/(s² mol)) / (g cm²/(s² K mol)) )

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think in terms of units:

The numerator is (g/mol * cm²/s²) → (g cm²)/(s² mol)
Denominator is (erg/(mol·K)) → (g cm²)/(s² K mol)

So T = [ (g cm²)/(s² mol) ) ] / [ (g cm²)/(s² K mol) ) ]

The (g cm²)/(s²) terms cancel, and mol cancels, leaving 1/(K).

So, the units for T are 1/K? That can't be right. Hmm, I must have messed up somewhere. Maybe I should compute the numerical value without considering the units, and see if it makes sense.

So T = (2 * (1.1e6)^2) / (3 * 8.3e7 )

Compute numerator: 2 * (1.21e12) = 2.42e12.

Denominator: 3 * 8.3e7 = 24.9e7.

So T = 2.42e12 / 2.49e8.

Wait, 2.42e12 / 2.49e8 equals (2.42/2.49) * 1e4 → approx 0.978e4 → 9780 K.

But the options are in the range of 1e4 K. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used for rms velocity is wrong. Let me double-check. Oh wait, the formula for rms velocity is sqrt(3kT/m). So that's correct. But perhaps I forgot to account for the molar mass correctly.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the problem is considering the root mean square velocity for the entire gas, not per molecule. But no, the formula for rms velocity (sqrt(3kT/m)) is per molecule.

Wait, I think the mistake is in the formula. Maybe the correct formula for rms speed is sqrt(3RT/M), but I'm using k instead of R. Because R = k N_A.

Wait, let's try that. So the rms velocity is sqrt(3 (R/(N_A)) T / M )

So T = (m v_esc^2 )/(3 R)

Wait, no, because that's the same as before.

Wait, but then (v_esc^2) is (1.1e6 cm/s)^2 = 1.21e12 cm²/s².

Multiply by m (2 g/mol): 2 * 1.21e12 = 2.42e12.

Divide by 3 R (3 * 8.3e7 = 24.9e7).

So T = 2.42e12 / 24.9e7 = (2.42 / 24.9) * 1e5 → approx 0.0986 * 1e5 → 9.86e4 K.

Wait, that's about 1e5 K, which is 100,000 K. But the options are in 1e4 K.

Wait, but the options are all around 1e4 K. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Hmm. Maybe I should calculate using the formula for rms velocity in terms of molar mass.

The rms velocity is sqrt( (3k T) / m )

m is the molar mass, which for H2 is 2 g/mol.

So, we can write the rms velocity as sqrt( (3 k T) / (2 g/mol) )

We want this to be equal to the escape velocity v_esc.

So:

sqrt( (3 k T ) / (2 g/mol) ) = v_esc

Squaring both sides:

(3 k T) / (2 g/mol) )= (v_esc)^2

Solving for T:

T= (2 g/mol * (v_esc)^2) / (3 k )

But k is R/(N_A), so substituting:

T= (2 g/mol * v_esc^2) / (3 R / N_A )

= (2 g/mol * v_esc^2 * N_A ) / (3 R )

So substituting the numbers:

g/mol =1 (since H is 1, H2 is 2, but wait, no, m is 2 g/mol).

Wait, no. m is 2 g/mol. So:

T= ( 2 * v_esc^2 * N_A ) / (3 * R )

So,

T = (2 * (1.1e6)^2 * 6.022e23 ) / (3 * 8.3e7 )

Compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 2 * (1.21e12) * 6.022e23 = 2 * 1.21e12 *6.022e23 → let's compute 1.21e12 *6.022e23 = 7.28e35, multiplied by 2 gives 1.456e36.

Denominator: 3 *8.3e7 = 24.9e7 = 2.49e8.

So T = 1.456e36 / 2.49e8 = (1.456/2.49) ) * 1e28 → 0.586 * 1e28 → 5.86e27 K. That's way too high, which doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula for rms velocity as sqrt(3kT/m), but I should have used the correct units for each variable.

Let me try using SI units.

v_esc is in m/s.

k is Boltzmann's constant in J/K.

m is in kg.

So, the formula is T = (3 m k v_esc^2 ) / (8 pi^2 )

Wait, no, wait. The rms speed is sqrt(3kT/m) = v_esc.

So, T = v_esc^2 m / (3k )

So in SI units:

m = 2 kg (H2).

k = 1.38e-2 m² K^{-1}.

v_esc = 1.1e6 m/s.

So T = (1.1e6)^2 * 2 / (3 * 1.38e-2 )

Compute numerator: (1.21e12) * 2 = 2.42e12.

Denominator: 3 * 1.38e-2 → 4.14e-2.

So T = 2.42e12 / 4.14e-2 → 2.42e12 / 4.14e-2 = (2.42 /4.14) ) * 1e14 → 0.586 * 1e14 → 5.86e13 K.

That's even higher than before. Hmm, but none of the options are in the 1e4 K range.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the formula. Let me try to compute T using the formula for rms velocity, but with the correct formula.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can use the formula for rms velocity in terms of temperature and molar mass.

The rms speed is given by sqrt( (3kT)/m ), where m is the molar mass.

So, setting that equal to the escape velocity:

sqrt( (3kT)/m ) = v_esc → (3kT/m) = v_esc² → T = (m v_esc²) / (3k )

Again, plugging in the numbers:

m = 2 kg (H2).

v_esc =1.1e6 m/s.

k = 1.38e-2 m²/K.

So,

T = (2 * (1.1e6)^2 ) / (3 * 1.38e-2 )

Compute numerator: 2 * 1.21e12 = 2.42e12.

Denominator: 3 * 1.38e-2 = 0.0414.

So T = 2.42e12 / 0.0414 → approximately 5.86e13 K.

Again, way higher than any of the given options.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the question. Because the options are in the range of 1e4 K, but according to my calculations, T is about 1e5 K or higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula with the correct variables and units.

Wait, maybe I should convert the problem into SI units and see.

Wait, the problem states that the escape velocity is 1.1e6 cm/s. So in meters per second, that's 1.1e6 cm/s = 1.1e6 * 0.01 m/s = 1.1e4 m/s.

Wait, but wait, 1 cm = 0.01 m. So 1.1e6 cm/s is 1.1e6 * 0.01 m/s = 1.1e4 m/s.

So, v_esc = 1.1e4 m/s.

Now, let's use the formula for rms velocity:

v_rms = sqrt( (3kT)/m )

Set this equal to v_esc.

So,

sqrt( (3kT)/m ) = v_esc → (3kT)/m = v_esc^2 → T = (m v_esc²) / (3k )

Again, m is 2 kg, v_esc is 1.1e4 m/s, k is 1.38e-2 m²/K.

So,

T = (2 * (1.1e4)^2) / (3 * 1.38e-2 )

Compute numerator: 2 * (1.21e8 ) = 2.42e8.

Denominator: 3 * 1.38e-2 = 0.0414.

So T = 2.42e8 / 0.0414 → approx 5.86e9 K.

Wait, that's even higher. So I'm getting T as about 1e5 K, which is still higher than any of the options. So I'm probably making a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the temperature at which the rms speed equals the escape velocity. So according to my calculations, the temperature would be about 1e5 K.

But the options are 1.5e4, 1.2e4, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I should use the formula for rms speed in terms of the gas constant R.

The rms speed is sqrt( (3k T)/m ), and since k = R/(N_A), substituting gives:

v_rms = sqrt( (3 R T) / (m N_A) )

Setting this equal to escape velocity.

So,

sqrt( (3 R T)/(m N_A) ) = v_esc → (3 R T)/(m N_A) ) = v_esc^2 → T = (m N_A v_esc^2 )/(3 R )

Wait, that's the same as before.

So, m is 2 kg, N_A is 6.022e23 mol^-1, R is 8.3e7 erg/mol/K, v_esc is 1.1e4 m/s.

Wait, let me compute T using this formula.

T = (2 * 6.022e23 * (1.1e4)^2 ) / (3 * 8.3e7 )

Compute numerator:

2 * 6.022e23 = 1.2044e24.

(1.1e4)^2 = 1.21e8.

Multiply numerator terms: 1.2044e24 * 1.21e8 = 1.454e33.

Denominator: 3 * 8.3e7 = 2.49e8.

So T = 1.454e33 / 2.49e8 → approx 5.84e24 K.

That's still way higher than any of the options. So I'm definitely making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula for rms velocity again.

Yes, rms velocity is sqrt(3kT/m). So that's correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is in the units of the given R. If R is in different units, that could change the result.

Wait, if R is in erg per mole, then when calculating using the formula, it's correct. But if R is in different units, the calculation would be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the formula for rms speed in terms of the molar mass.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the rms speed in terms of the temperature and molar mass, then set that equal to the escape velocity.

So, the rms speed is given by:

v_rms = sqrt( (3kT)/m )

But k is R/(N_A). So substituting:

v_rms = sqrt( (3 (R/(N_A)) T)/m )

= sqrt( (3 R T) / (m N_A) )

We can rearrange to solve for T:

T = (m N_A v_rms^2 )/(3 R )

So, T = (m N_A v_esc^2 )/(3 R )

Wait, but if I use this formula, and m is 2 kg, N_A is 6e23, v_esc is 1.1e4 m/s, R is 8.3e7 erg/K.

Let me compute this:

Numerator: m * N_A * v_esc^2 = 2 * 6.022e23 * (1.1e4)^2

= 2 * 6.022e23 * 1.21e8

= 2 * 7.26e31 → 1.452e32.

Denominator: 3 R = 3 * 8.3e7 → 2.49e8.

So, T = 1.452e32 / 2.49e8 = approx 5.84e23 K.

That can't be right.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the formula with the units of R in erg/mol/K.

Because R is given in erg/mol/K, that's correct.

Hmm, I'm getting the same result every time, which doesn't match any of the answer options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should compute the temperature in K given the escape velocity, but perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, perhaps I should think of m as the molar mass, which is 2 g/mol, and v_esc as 1.1e6 cm/s.

So, the formula is T = (m v_esc^2 )/(3k )

Wait, no, because k is R/(N_A).

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should try plugging in the given options to see which one gives a v_rms close to 1.1e6 cm/s.

Let's take option B: T =1.2e4 K.

Compute v_rms = sqrt( (3k T)/m )

k = R/(N_A), so substituting:

v_rms = sqrt( (3 (R/(N_A)) T ) / m )

= sqrt( (3 R T) / (m N_A) )

Plugging in R=8.3e7 erg/mol/K, T=1.2e4 K, m=2 kg:

v_rms = sqrt( (3 * 8.3e7 * 1.2e4 ) / (2 * 6.022e23) )

Compute numerator: 3 * 8.3e7 * 1.2e4 → 3 * 8.3 →24.9; 24.9 * 1e7 → 2.49e8; 1.2e4 → 2.49e12.

Denominator: 2 *6.022e23 → 1.2044e24.

So,

v_rms = sqrt( 2.49e12 / 1.2044e24 ) = sqrt( 2.068e-13 ) ≈ 4.547e-7 m/s.

But the escape velocity is 1.1e6 cm/s, which is 1.1e4 m/s, which is way higher than 4.5e-7 m/s.

So, option B is way too low.

What about option A: T=1.5e4 K.

Compute v_rms:

v_rms = sqrt( (3*8.3e7 * 1.5e4)/(2*6.022e23) )

Numerator: 3*8.3e7 → 2.49e8; 2.49e8 * 1.5e4 →3.735e13.

Denominator: 2 *6.022e23 →1.2044e24.

So,

v_rms = sqrt( 3.735e13 / 1.2044e24 ) = sqrt(3.10e-11) ) ≈5.57e-6 m/s.

Still much lower than 1.1e6 cm/s.

Hmm, perhaps I should try option C: T=9.7e3 K.

v_rms = sqrt( (3*8.3e7 *9.7e3)/(2*6.022e23) )

Numerator:3*8.3e7 →2.49e8; 2.49e8 *9.7e3 →2.49e8 *9.7e3 = let's compute 2.49 * 9.7 = 23.953, and exponents: 8+3=11 → 2.3953e11.

Denominator:2*6.022e23 →1.2044e24.

v_rms = sqrt( 2.3953e11 / 1.2044e24 ) = sqrt(1.987e-13) ≈4.46e-7 m/s.

Still way too low.

Option D: T=3.0e4 K.

Compute v_rms:

v_rms = sqrt( (3*8.3e7 *3.0e4)/(2*6.022e23) )

Numerator:3*8.3e7=2.49e8; 2.49e8 *3.0e4=7.47e12.

Denominator:2 *6.022e23=1.2044e24.

v_rms = sqrt(7.47e12 / 1.2044e24 )= sqrt(6.2e-13)=~7.87e-7 m/s.

Still way too low.

Hmm, but all the options give a v_rms way below the escape velocity.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the v_rms for each option and see which one is closest to the escape velocity.

Wait, the escape velocity is 1.1e6 cm/s =1.1e4 m/s =11,000 m/s.

Wait, let me check option C again.

Option C: T=9.7e3 K.

v_rms= sqrt( (3 *8.3e7 *9.7e3)/(2 *6.022e23) )

Compute numerator: 3 *8.3e7 =2.49e8; 2.49e8 *9.7e3=2.49e8 * 9.7e3 = let's compute 2.49 *9.7 =24.053, exponents 8+3=11 →2.4053e12.

Denominator:2 *6.022e23=1.2044e24.

v_rms= sqrt( 2.4053e12 / 1.2044e24 )=sqrt(2.00e-13)=~4.47e-7 m/s.

Still way too low.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is to find the temperature at which the rms speed equals the escape velocity, but the given options are higher than necessary.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should compute the rms speed for each option and see which one is close to 1.1e4 m/s.

Looking for v_rms ≈ 1.1e4 m/s.

So, let's compute v_rms for each option.

Option A: T=1.5e4 K.

v_rms= sqrt( (3*8.3e7 *1.5e4)/(2*6.022e23) )

As before, this is 4.547e-6 m/s.

Option B: T=1.2e4 K.

v_rms= sqrt( (3*8.3e7 *1.2e4)/(2*6.022e23) )=4.547e-6 m/s.

Option C: T=9.7e3 K.

v_rms= sqrt( (3*8.3e7 *9.7e3)/(2*6.022e23) )=4.46e-7 m/s.

Option D: T=3.0e4 K.

v_rms= sqrt( (3*8.3e7 *3.0e4)/(2*6.022e23) )=4.46e-7 m/s.

None of them reach close to 1.1e4 m/s, which is 11,000 m/s.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for rms velocity is v_rms = sqrt( (3kT)/m ), which I have been using.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is to find T when v_esc = v_rms. So, substituting the values.

Wait, perhaps the problem is given in a different unit system. For example, in the problem statement, perhaps the escape velocity is given in kilometers, but perhaps in the problem, it's given in another unit system.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in terms of the formula, but I'm just missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the temperature for each option and see which one gives a v_rms close to the escape velocity.

But as I saw, all options give v_rms << escape velocity.

Wait, perhaps I should compute v_esc in the same units as the given options.

Wait, the given options are in Kelvin, and the units of R are erg/mol/K.

So, perhaps I should compute the v_rms for each option in the same units and see which one gives a v_rms close to the escape velocity.

But as I saw, all options give v_rms << escape velocity.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the formula and the answer is 1e4 K, but I'm not seeing why.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the temperature for which v_rms = v_esc.

So, set v_rms = 11,000 m/s.

Then, T = (m v_esc^2 )/(3k )

Wait, but k is R/(N_A), so substituting:

T = (m v_esc^2 )/(3 (R/(N_A)) ) = (m N_A v_esc^2 )/(3 R )

So, T = (m N_A v_esc^2 )/(3 R )

Plugging in the values:

m =2 kg, N_A=6.022e23 mol^-1, v_esc=1.1e4 m/s, R=8.3e7 erg/mol/K.

Compute numerator: 2 *6.022e23 * (1.1e4)^2.

(1.1e4)^2 =1.21e8.

So numerator: 2 *6.022e23 *1.21e8 =2 *6.022 *1.21 *1e31 → 2 *7.26 *1e31 →14.52e31.

Denominator:3 *8.3e7 =24.9e7.

So,

T =14.52e31 /24.9e7 = (14.52/24.9) *1e24 →≈0.598 *1e24 →5.98e23 K.

Wait, that's even lower than the options given. So, I'm getting T as 6e23 K, but the options are much lower.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting T in terms of the formula but with the result being 1e4 K, but I must have made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, maybe I should consider that in the formula, the units of R are in different forms, but I'm not taking that into account.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the formula and an approximate answer, but I'm not considering the correct exponents.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the v_rms for each option and see which one is closest to the escape velocity.

Wait, but as I saw, all options give v_rms << escape velocity.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the v_rms for each option and see which one is closest to the escape velocity.

Wait, in the options, option C is 9.7e3 K, which is about 10,000 K.

Compute v_rms for option C: T=9.7e3 K.

v_rms= sqrt( (3*8.3e7 *9.7e3)/(2*6.022e23) )

As before, this is 4.46e-7 m/s.

Which is way too low.

So, none of the options give a v_rms close to the escape velocity.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting T in terms of the formula but with the result being 1e4 K, but I'm not considering the correct exponents.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should try to look for the correct answer elsewhere.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the v_rms when T=1e4 K.

v_rms= sqrt( (3*8.3e7 *1e4)/(2*6.022e23) )

Compute numerator:3*8.3e7 *1e4= 3 *8.3e7 *1e4=3 *8.3e11=24.9e11=2.49e12.

Denominator:2*6.022e23=1.2044e24.

v_rms= sqrt(2.49e12 /1.2044e24 )=sqrt(2.06e-13)=~4.54e-7 m/s.

Still too low.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. I think I'm missing something, but I can't see it.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the v_esc for each option and see which one makes sense.

But the options are T=1.5e4 K, 1.2e4 K, etc.

Wait, let me compute the v_rms for each option and see which one is closest to the escape velocity.

Wait, but all options give v_rms << escape velocity.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the formula and the answer is 1e4 K, but I'm not seeing why.

Wait, perhaps I should make the substitution as follows:

T = (m v_esc^2 )/(3k )

But k= R/(N_A), so,

T = (m v_esc^2 N_A )/(3 R )

Plugging in the values:

m=2 kg, v_esc=1.1e4 m/s, N_A=6.022e23, R=8.3e7.

So,

T = (2 * (1.1e4)^2 *6.022e23 )/(3 *8.3e7 )

Compute numerator:

(1.1e4)^2 =1.21e8.

2 *1.21e8 *6.022e23 =2.42e8 *6.022e23 =1.456e32.

Denominator:

3 *8.3e7 =2.49e8.

So,

T=1.456e32 /2.49e8 =5.84e23 K.

Which is way higher than the options given.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. I think I'm missing an obvious mistake somewhere, but I can't see it.

Perhaps the correct answer is option C, which is T=9.7e3 K, but I don't know why.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is expecting the use of the formula, but the units are mixed up. For example, in the formula, R is given in different units than k, which is R/(N_A). So, perhaps I should convert R to erg/mol/K and k to erg/mol/K.

Wait, but R is already given in erg/mol/K, so that shouldn't change anything.

Wait, perhaps I should convert R to J/mol/K, but that's not necessary here.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I have to give up and say that I can't find the correct answer.
</think>

After carefully analyzing the problem and calculations, it becomes evident that none of the provided options result in a v_rms close to the escape velocity of 1.1e4 m/s. This suggests that there may be an error in the problem setup or an oversight in the solution process. Therefore, the correct answer is not among the given choices.

ANSWER: None of the options provide the correct temperature for the given conditions.
