Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Why is the sky blue?

Options:

A: Because the Earth's magnetic field causes the sky to appear blue.
B: Because the human eye is more sensitive to blue light.
C: Because the Earth's atmosphere contains a large amount of blue pigment.
D: Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.
E: Because blue is the most abundant color in the color spectrum.
F: Because the molecules that compose the Earth's atmosphere have a blue-ish color.
G: Because the ozone layer reflects blue light.
H: Because the sun emits blue light more than any other color.
I: Because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially absorbs all other colors.
J: Because the sky reflects the color of the Earth's oceans.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the sky is blue. I've heard a lot about the atmosphere and how light interacts with it before. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Earth's atmosphere is composed mainly of gases, like nitrogen and oxygen. These gases absorb and scatter light. So when the sun's light reaches Earth, it enters the atmosphere. The atmosphere doesn't absorb all colors equally. I think blue light is absorbed more than red or green light. So the blue gets scattered more.

Wait, but the Earth's atmosphere is a thick layer, right? So maybe the light is passing through more of the atmosphere. The longer the light travels, the less it's absorbed because the atmosphere doesn't absorb blue as much. So the blue light makes it through more, and the longer path means more blue gets absorbed by the atmosphere. Oh wait, no, the atmosphere absorbs blue more, so the blue gets scattered more.

Wait, no, the Earth's atmosphere is transparent to some colors but absorbs others. For example, blue light is scattered more, so it doesn't pass through as much as red or green. So when the light comes back up, it's more blue than the original. That would make the sky appear blue.

So the main reason the sky is blue is because blue light is scattered more in the atmosphere than other colors. That would be option D. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: 

A: Earth's magnetic field causes sky blue. I don't think that's right. I remember that the Earth's atmosphere has a lot of oxygen, not much of a magnetic field, so that's probably not the reason.

B: Human eye is more sensitive to blue. Well, the eye does see blue, but that's more about what we see, not the cause of the color. So that's not the cause.

C: Earth's atmosphere has a lot of blue pigment. No, the atmosphere is transparent, not absorbing blue. So that's not it.

D: Earth's atmosphere scatters blue. That's correct because blue is scattered more than other colors in the atmosphere.

E: Blue is most abundant in color. No, the sky's color isn't about the most abundant color in the spectrum. It's about the scattering.

F: Earth's atmosphere has blue-colored molecules. Wait, but the atmosphere consists of gases, not molecules. So F is probably incorrect.

G: Ozone layer reflects blue. I think ozone is in the upper atmosphere, reflecting more UV, not blue. Blue light is transmitted through ozone, though. So G is incorrect.

H: Sun emits more blue. No, the sun emits a broad range of colors, but blue is just one part. The sky is blue because of scattering, not because the sun emits more blue.

I: Atmosphere absorbs all other colors. No, because blue is absorbed more. So the opposite is true.

J: Sky reflects Earth's oceans. That's more about the sky's color being a result of the atmosphere absorbing and re-emitting. But the sky's color is caused by scattering, not reflection. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer is D.
</think>

The sky appears blue because blue light is scattered more in the Earth's atmosphere than other colors. This scattering occurs as light passes through the atmosphere, and since blue light is absorbed less efficiently, it is scattered preferentially, making the sky appear blue. Other options either describe incorrect mechanisms or unrelated phenomena. 

Answer: D
