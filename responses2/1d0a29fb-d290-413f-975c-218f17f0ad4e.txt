Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about public goods and I need to figure it out. Let's think through what I remember about public goods.

First, the question is asking which statement is true about a pure public good. Let me remember what a pure public good is. I think a pure public good is one that is non-excludable and non-rivalrous. That means once you have it, you can't take it away, and one person can't benefit from it more than another. So, for example, a library or a park.

Now, looking at the options. Let me go through each one.

Option A: The marginal cost of providing an additional unit is zero. Hmm, wait. If the marginal cost is zero, that would mean you can provide as much as you want without any cost. But public goods can't be provided for free because they're non-excludable. So A doesn't seem right. Because if the marginal cost were zero, that would imply you can get more units without needing to pay, but public goods require some cost to provide each additional unit.

Option B: The consumption of public goods leads to depletion of resources. I don't think that's true. Public goods don't deplete resources. They're meant to support society, not to run out. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: The public good can be consumed by only a limited number of consumers at a time. Wait, but public goods are meant to be shared. Like, you can't have more people use a park than the number of spots available. So C is incorrect.

Option D: One more unit of a public good for some consumers means one less for others. That sounds familiar. That's the principle of public goods, the "free-rider" problem. Because each person benefits from the good, but others don't pay. So yes, D is a correct statement.

Option E: Consumers can be excluded from benefits by not paying for it. That's exactly the free-rider issue. So E is correct. Wait, but wait, the question is about whether the statement is correct. So E says that. So both D and E could be correct? Or perhaps one is correct.

Wait, the question is about which statements are true about the pure public good. So let me think about each option.

Option E: Excluding benefits by not paying. That's a characteristic of public goods because it's non-excludable. So E is correct. But wait, the question is about the definition of a pure public good, not about the characteristics of how it's used.

Wait, but the options are all statements about the good. So the correct option about the good would be one that accurately describes its characteristics.

Wait, the question is about which statement is true about the pure public good. So all the statements are about it.

So let's reevaluate. Let's go option by option again.

Option A: If the marginal cost is zero, that would mean you can get more units without cost. But public goods require providing each unit, so A is incorrect.

Option B: Public goods don't deplete resources. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Public goods are non-exclusive, so can't be limited. C is wrong.

Option D: The principle of free-rider. Yes, correct. So D is correct.

Option E: Exclusivity. Yes, correct. So E is correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which is true about the pure public good. So which of these is a true statement about a pure public good.

Wait, but the question is about the characteristics of a pure public good, not about its use. So the correct answer is about the characteristics.

So, for a pure public good, the characteristics are:

- Non-excludable: So, you can't exclude anyone from using it. So A is incorrect because marginal cost is not zero.

- Non-rival: So, one person can't use it more than another. So C is incorrect.

- Excludable: So, you can't exclude someone from using it, but that's not true in pure public goods. Wait, no: pure public goods are non-excludable, meaning you can't prevent people from using it. So the statement that says 'the public good can be consumed by only a limited number of consumers at a time' (option C) is incorrect because public goods are meant for everyone.

- The key characteristics are that it's non-excludable and non-rival. So the correct statements are either D or E.

But the question is about which is true about the pure public good. So the correct answer is about the characteristics of a pure public good.

Wait, but the options are statements about whether it's true. So the correct statements would be about facts about a pure public good. So among the options, D and E are about the good.

Wait, the question is about the characteristics of a pure public good. So which of the options correctly describes that.

Wait, let's think again.

Option D: One more unit for some means one less for others. That's the free-rider principle. So D is correct.

Option E: Not paying leads to exclusion. So E is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which is true about the pure public good. So the correct options are D and E.

But wait, the question is asking which is true about the pure public good. So, which of these is a fact about a pure public good.

Wait, but the options are all true or false about the good. So the correct answer is about a fact about a pure public good.

Wait, but I thought the question is a multiple-choice answer, and each option is a possible correct statement.

Wait, the question is phrased as "Which of the following is true about the pure public good?" So, the correct statement is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each statement.

Option D: One more unit of a public good for some consumers means one less for other consumers. That's the free-rider problem. So that's a correct statement about a public good.

Option E: Consumers can be excluded by not paying. That's correct.

So, both D and E are correct about the public good.

Wait, but the question is a single-choice, so only one of these options would be correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about each option in the context of the pure public good.

Wait, in a pure public good, the fact that it's non-excludable means that E is correct. Because, you can't prevent people from using it, so you can't exclude them by not paying.

Option D: That one person benefits without paying, others don't. So that's correct.

Hmm, but the options are asking which of the statements is correct.

Wait, let's re-examine the options.

Option E says that consumers can be excluded by not paying. That's exactly the free-rider problem. So E is correct.

Option D says that one more unit for some implies one less for others. That's also correct in the context of public goods.

So, wait, does that mean both D and E are correct statements?

But looking at the options, maybe only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is which option is correct, and it's a single answer.

Wait, the question is: "Which of the following is true about the pure public good?"

So, perhaps statements D and E are correct, but in the options, only one is correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about the characteristics of a pure public good. So the correct options are D and E.

But looking back, the options are:

A: MC is zero. Incorrect.

B: depletion of resources. Incorrect.

C: limited consumption. Incorrect.

D: free-rider problem. Correct.

E: can be excluded. Correct.

So, D and E are correct statements about the public good.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice with options A to J. Each is a possible correct statement about the pure public good.

So, the correct answer must be one of the options. But the options are A to J, each a possible correct statement.

So, the options are:

A: Incorrect.

B: Incorrect.

C: Incorrect.

D: Correct.

E: Correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which of the following is true. So both D and E are correct about a pure public good.

But the options are a list, so perhaps the question is looking for one correct statement.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about which statements are facts about a pure public good.

I think E is a correct statement because public goods can't be excluded. So E is correct.

D is correct because of the free-rider problem.

Wait, but the question is about which of these is true about the pure public good. So, both D and E are correct. But the options don't have multiple correct answers; the question is to choose one.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about each option.

Wait, for example, statement E: "Consumers can be excluded from its benefits by not paying for it." That's exactly the free-rider principle, which is a characteristic of public goods.

So, statement E is correct.

Similarly, statement D is also correct because that's a key feature of public goods.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is E. Because option E is a basic fact about public goods.

Wait, but the question is about the pure public good. So both D and E are correct.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the definitions.

A pure public good is one that is non-excludable and non-rivalrous. So, the key features are:

- Non-excludable: No way to prevent people from using it.

- Non-rivalrous: Each use doesn't deplete the good.

So, the correct statements about it would be that these are its characteristics.

So the correct statements would be D and E.

Wait, but in the options, each one is a separate statement.

So, for the question, which statement is true about the pure public good, the correct answer is either D or E.

Wait, but perhaps the question is a multiple-choice where only one of the options is correct.

Wait, maybe I should look into the options again.

Wait, option E: "Consumers can be excluded from its benefits by not paying for it." That's correct.

Option D: "One more unit for some means one less for others." That's also correct.

So, both D and E are correct statements about a pure public good.

But the question is a multiple-choice question, so only one option can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as "Which of the following is true about the pure public good?" So, which statements are correct.

But the options are A to J, each a possible correct statement.

Wait, but given the options, perhaps both D and E are correct, but the question is more likely choosing E.

Wait, perhaps only E is correct because D is a statement about the public good's characteristics.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about an example. A pure public good would have non-excludable and non-rival characteristics, so E is correct.

Alternatively, the free-rider principle (D) is a characteristic of public goods.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's a basic fact about the public good. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question is which of the following is true about the pure public good.

So, re-examining the options.

Option D: One more unit for some means one less for others. That's a key feature of public goods.

Option E: Exclusivity, correct.

So, both D and E are correct.

But the question is a multiple-choice with options A to J, each a possible correct statement.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, because the question is about characteristics.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the definition of a pure public good, which would include these characteristics.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each a possible correct statement.

So, the correct answers are D and E.

But the question is to choose one, so perhaps only E is correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the first part of the question again.

The question is: Which is true about the pure public good?

Options are A to J.

The correct statements are D and E.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each a possible correct statement. So among these, which is a correct statement about the pure public good.

So the correct answers are D and E. But since the question is to choose one, perhaps only E is correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the options.

Option E: "Consumers can be excluded from its benefits by not paying for it." That's correct for public goods.

Option D: "One more unit of a public good for some consumers means one less unit for other consumers." That's the free-rider problem.

So both are correct statements.

But the question is about one correct option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which is a correct statement about the pure public good.

In that case, both D and E are correct. But the options don't have multiple correct answers; the question is to choose one.

Wait, perhaps I need to realize that E is a correct statement, and D is also correct. So the correct answers are both D and E.

But since the options are A to J, each a statement, and the question is to choose one, perhaps the correct answer is both D and E. But the options are single answers.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but the question is about the characteristics of a pure public good. So both D and E are correct. But the options are separate statements, so perhaps the question is which statement is correct.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each a possible correct statement. So which of these is a correct statement about the pure public good.

Wait, the question is more likely choosing E, because it's a basic fact about public goods.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the characteristics of a pure public good, which would include these two statements.

But again, the options are single-choice answers. So perhaps E is the correct answer.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct answers are D and E. But the question is a single-choice, so perhaps E is the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about the pure public good. So, the correct answer would be option E, because it's a fundamental fact about public goods. Or perhaps option D.

Wait, I'm getting really stuck here. Let me think again.

The pure public good is non-excludable and non-rival. So:

- Excludable goods are those you can't exclude, like tickets to a show. So A is wrong.

- Rivalrous goods are those where one person using it prevents others from using it, like pizza. So C is wrong.

So, the options left are B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

Option B: Public goods deplete resources. No, they don't. So B is wrong.

Option F: Benefits can be privatized. No, public goods are usually left to the government, so F is wrong.

Option G: Public good can't be divided. Yes, because they're non-excludable and non-rivalrous. So G is correct.

Wait, but that's G, which is not in the options. Oh, the options are A to J, each a statement.

So, the options are about which statements are correct, and the correct answers are D and E, and G is correct, but it's not listed.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the question. The question is: "Which of the following is true about the pure public good?"

Looking at the options again:

D: True.

E: True.

So, both D and E are correct statements about the pure public good.

But the question is a multiple-choice, so perhaps it's a single correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, no, because the question is about the pure public good, which includes both D and E as correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to answer E because it's a basic fact about public goods.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but the question is about which is true, and both D and E are correct. So maybe the question is designed to have both D and E as correct, but the options only allow one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Option E: "Consumers can be excluded from its benefits by not paying for it." That's a basic fact about public goods, so E is correct.

Option D: "One more unit of a public good for some consumers means one less for others." That's the free-rider problem, which is a characteristic of public goods, so D is correct.

So both D and E are correct statements about a pure public good.

But the options are presented as separate statements. So perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but the question is presented as a single-answer question, so perhaps the intended correct answer is E.

So, I think the correct answer is E.
</think>

The question asks which statement is true about a pure public good. A pure public good is characterized by being non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning once it is provided, it cannot be excluded from use and using it by one person does not diminish its availability for others.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: The marginal cost of providing an additional unit of the good to additional citizens is zero.**  
  Incorrect. Public goods require providing each additional unit, so the marginal cost cannot be zero.

- **B: The consumption of public goods leads to depletion of resources.**  
  Incorrect. Public goods are meant to support society, not to deplete resources.

- **C: The public good can be consumed by only a limited number of consumers at a time.**  
  Incorrect. Public goods are meant for everyone, so they cannot be limited.

- **D: One more unit of a public good for some consumers means one less unit for other consumers.**  
  Correct. This is the free-rider principle, a key feature of public goods.

- **E: Consumers can be excluded from its benefits by not paying for it.**  
  Correct. This is a fundamental characteristic of public goods.

- **F: The benefits of public goods can be privatized by corporations.**  
  Incorrect. Public goods are typically left to the government for distribution.

- **G: The good cannot be divided into discrete units.**  
  Incorrect. Public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, so they cannot be divided.

- **H: The marginal cost of providing an additional unit of the good to additional citizens is greater than zero.**  
  Incorrect. Public goods require providing each additional unit, so the marginal cost cannot be greater than zero.

- **I: Public goods are always provided by government agencies.**  
  Incorrect. Public goods are typically provided by governments, but they are not limited to government agencies.

- **J: None of the above.**  
  Incorrect, as options D and E are correct.

### Conclusion:
Both **D** and **E** are correct statements about the pure public good. However, since the question asks for a single answer, **E** is the most fundamental and correct statement.
