Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about regression models and R². I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says: Suppose that the value of R² for an estimated regression model is exactly zero. Which of the following are true? The options are from i to iv, each making a statement.

First, I need to remember what R² represents. R², or the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. So, R² = 0 would mean that the model doesn't explain any of the variance in the dependent variable.

Now, let's go through each statement one by one.

i) All coefficient estimates on the slopes will be zero. Hmm. Well, R² is 0, which means the model explains none of the variance. But does that mean all the coefficients are zero? Not necessarily. For example, imagine a simple linear regression with just one explanatory variable. R²=0 could mean that the slope is zero, but it's also possible that there are multiple variables, and none of them are significant. Or even if there's one variable, it just doesn't correlate with y, meaning the slope could be zero, but maybe not all coefficients. Wait, but wait. If R² is zero, does that necessarily mean all coefficients are zero? I don't think so. For example, if I have a model like y = 0 + 0x + error, then R² is zero, but the coefficients (the slope and intercept) are zero. But that's a trivial case. Alternatively, if I have a model like y = 0 + 1x + error, and R² is zero, that implies that the slope is zero, so the model is just a horizontal line (since the intercept is zero). But wait, no. That's not possible because the slope being zero would make the model y = 0 + 0x + error, not y = 0 + 1x + error. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, if R² is zero, the model doesn't explain any variance. So the sum of squares explained is zero. So the regression line is flat, but doesn't necessarily mean all coefficients are zero. For example, if I have a model: y = 0 + 0x + error. Then R² is zero, but all coefficients are zero. But what if the model is y = 0 + 1x + error, and R²=0. That would imply that the slope is zero, but that's a different model. Wait, if the slope is zero, then the model is y = intercept + error. If R² is zero, then the variance explained is zero, meaning the model can't explain any of the y's variance. So in this case, the slope would be zero, and the intercept would be zero, but that's a special case. Wait, is that possible? Well, for any model, R²=0 doesn't imply all coefficients are zero. For example, if I have y = 1 + 0x + error. Then R²=0, but the slope is zero, and the intercept is non-zero. So in this case, the statement i) is not true. So i) is false.

Wait, but wait. Wait, that's only if the model is simple. Suppose we have multiple variables. For example, y = a + b1x1 + b2x2 + error. If R²=0, then what? It doesn't necessarily mean all coefficients are zero. It could mean that none of the variables are significant. So statement i) is not necessarily true. So i) is false.

ii) The fitted line will be horizontal with respect to all of the explanatory variables. Hmm. A horizontal line would imply that the fitted values are constant for any given value of x. But in regression, the fitted line is the best linear fit. If the model's R² is zero, does that force the fitted line to be horizontal? I don't think so. For example, if the model is y = 0 + 1x + error, which has an R² of zero only if x is one of the variables that's not related to y. Wait, no, that's not correct. If x is a variable, then the R² would be zero if x isn't a significant predictor. So, for example, if you have y = 0 + 1x + error, where x is not correlated with y, then the slope is zero, and the intercept is zero? Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, wait. Let me clarify. No, if x is not a significant variable, then the slope might be close to zero. So the model could be y = 0 + 0x + error, which makes R² zero. But the fitted line would be horizontal, because the slope is zero. Alternatively, if the model is y = 0 + 1x + error, but R² is zero, that would require that x isn't a significant predictor, but then the slope is zero. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing this. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement ii) is correct. Because if R² is zero, that means the model can't explain any variance. So the best fit line would have an intercept and a slope such that the variance isn't explained. But can that line be horizontal? Well, if the line is horizontal, that would mean the slope is zero. So if R² is zero, the best fit could have a slope of zero, which is horizontal. Wait, but only if the model is y = intercept + error. But then the R² would be zero because there's no relationship between x and y. So in that case, the fitted line is horizontal. But is that the only possibility? Or could there be a model where the fitted line is not horizontal but has zero R²? Like, say, intercept and slope non-zero, but the variance isn't explained. But I don't think that's possible. Because if the sum of squares explained is zero, then that's only possible if the model's slope is zero (for a simple model) or the model is not able to capture any variance. So, in any case, R²=0 implies that the model can't explain any variance, but the fitted line could be horizontal only if the slope is zero. Because if the slope were non-zero, maybe the variance was explained, but the model could have a non-zero slope. Wait, no. If the model's slope is non-zero, then the model would have explained some variance. So if R² is zero, the model can't explain any variance, which would require that the slope is zero. So in that case, the fitted line is horizontal. So statement ii) is true.

Wait, but wait. Let me think of an example. Suppose y is a constant, say y=5. Then the model could be y = 5 + 0x + error, which would have R²=1. So, if R² is zero, the model can't have any intercept or slope. So, in this case, the fitted line would be horizontal (since slope is zero), intercept is zero. So yes, statement ii) is correct.

iii) The regression line has not explained any of the variability of y about its mean value. The mean of y is the average value. The regression line passes through the mean of both x and y. The total variability in y is the sum of the variance around the mean and the variance explained by the model. If R² is zero, the model doesn't explain any of that variability. So the line doesn't explain any of y's variability about its mean. So statement iii) is correct.

iv) The intercept coefficient must be zero. Hmm. If R² is zero, does that mean the intercept has to be zero? Well, let's think. If the model is y = intercept + slope*x + error, and R² is zero, then the model can't explain any variance. But the intercept can be non-zero. For example, if you have y = 1 + 0x + error, and R² is zero, but the intercept is non-zero. Wait, no. Because if the slope is zero, the model reduces to y = intercept + error. Then, the R² would be zero only if the model can't explain any variance. So in this case, intercept could be non-zero, but the model's slope is zero, which would be R²=0. So in this case, the intercept is non-zero, but statement iv) says the intercept must be zero. So statement iv) is false.

So now, the statements:

i) False

ii) True

iii) True

iv) False

Wait, wait. But wait, earlier I thought statement i) was false. Let me check statement i again. Statement i says, "All coefficient estimates on the slopes will be zero." So, if R² is zero, does that mean all the slope coefficients are zero? That's not necessarily true. For example, suppose we have a model where the intercept is zero, and the slope is zero. Then R² is zero. But the intercept could be non-zero, and the slope could be zero. So R² is zero, but the intercept isn't zero. So statement i) is false.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: if the model is y = 0 + 0x + error, then R² is zero, but all coefficients are zero. So in that case, i) is true. But if the model is y = 0 + 0x + error, but the intercept is zero, but the slope is zero, then i) is true. Oh, but statement i) says that all slopes are zero. So, if any slope is non-zero, then i) is false. But in reality, R² being zero doesn't imply that all slopes are zero. For example, R² could be zero because the model isn't including a variable (so both intercept and slope are zero), but R² could be zero even if, say, the slope is non-zero if that variable isn't a significant predictor. But in that case, statement i) would be false because some coefficients (the slopes) are non-zero. So, statement i) is false.

So, statements i) and iv) are false. Statements ii) and iii) are true.

Looking at the options, which option includes ii) and iii) only? Let's look at the options:

Options:

A: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) → includes i which is false.

B: (i) and (ii) only → includes i which is false.

C: (i) and (iii) only → includes i which is false.

D: (iii) and (iv) only → includes iii which is true, but iv is false, so option D is wrong.

E: (ii) and (iii) only → yes, this seems correct.

F: (ii), (iii), and (iv) → includes iv which is false.

G: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only → iv is false, so no.

H: (i) and (iv) only → i and iv are false.

I: (i), (iii), and (iv) only → i and iv are false.

J: (i), (ii), and (iii) only → includes i (false) and iii (true), so no.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check statement ii). So, if R² is zero, can the fitted line be horizontal? For example, if the model is y = intercept + error, and that's the only variable, then the slope is zero, so the fitted line is horizontal. That's one case. But suppose the model has multiple variables. Let's say y = intercept + slope1*x1 + slope2*x2 + error. If R² is zero, that implies that the model can't explain any variance. So the best fit line must be such that it doesn't explain any variance. So, the model's slope coefficients would all be zero, leading to a horizontal line. So, in that case, statement ii) is correct.

Wait, but what if the model is y = 0 + 1*x + error, and R² is zero? That would imply that the slope is zero, so the model reduces to y = 0 + 0*x + error, R²=0, but the fitted line is horizontal. So statement ii) is correct.

So statement ii) is correct.

Statement iii) says the regression line has not explained any variability of y about its mean. Yes, because in that case, the model's variance is zero, so the regression line passes through the mean, and the total variation in y is all explained by the model. So, the model's variance doesn't contribute to the variability around the mean. So statement iii) is correct.

So, among the options, which one includes ii) and iii) only?

Looking back at the options:

Options:

E: (ii) and (iii) only. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but what about statement iv)? Oh, earlier I thought statement iv) is false because intercept can be non-zero. But let me think again. So, statement iv) says "The intercept coefficient must be zero." If R² is zero, the model's intercept doesn't have to be zero. So statement iv) is definitely false.

So, statements ii) and iii) are correct. So option E.

The question asks which statements about an estimated regression model with $R^2 = 0$ are true. Each statement is analyzed as follows:

1. **Statement i):** All coefficient estimates on the slopes will be zero.  
   - $R^2 = 0$ indicates that the model does not explain any variance in the dependent variable. However, this does not imply that all slope coefficients are zero. For example, a model like $y = 0 + 1x + \text{error}$ with $R^2 = 0$ has a non-zero slope. Thus, statement i) is false.

2. **Statement ii):** The fitted line will be horizontal with respect to all of the explanatory variables.  
   - A horizontal line implies a slope of zero. If $R^2 = 0$, the model cannot explain any variance, meaning the best fit line must be horizontal. This statement is true.

3. **Statement iii):** The regression line has not explained any of the variability of y about its mean value.  
   - The regression line passes through the mean of the dependent variable. If $R^2 = 0$, the model's variance is zero, meaning it does not explain any variability of $y$ about its mean. This statement is true.

4. **Statement iv):** The intercept coefficient estimate must be zero.  
   - The intercept can be non-zero even if $R^2 = 0$. For example, a model like $y = 1 + 0x + \text{error}$ has $R^2 = 0$ but a non-zero intercept. Thus, statement iv) is false.

From the analysis, statements ii) and iii) are true, and statements i) and iv) are false. The correct option is E.
