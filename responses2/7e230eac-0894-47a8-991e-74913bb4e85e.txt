Okay, so I've got this problem here about a salesman's brush sales increasing from 927 to 1,059. I need to find the percentage increase. Hmm, percentage increase, right. I think that's calculated by taking the difference between the new and old numbers, dividing by the old number, and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. Let me think through the steps.

First, I should find the increase in sales. That's the new amount minus the old amount. So 1,059 minus 927. Let me calculate that: 1,059 minus 927. Hmm, 1,059 minus 900 is 159, then minus 27 more is 132. Oh wait, that's 132. So the increase is 132 brushes.

Next, I need to find what percentage 132 is of the original sales, which was 927. So the formula is (increase/original) * 100. So that's (132 / 927) * 100.

Let me compute that. 132 divided by 927. Let me see, 927 goes into 132 about 0.1438 times because 927 * 0.1438 is approximately 132. So 0.1438 multiplied by 100 gives about 14.38%. So that's roughly 14.4%.

Looking at the options, option C is 16.8%, which is higher. Option I is 14.239%, which is closer to what I got. Wait, did I make a calculation mistake? Let me double-check.

Wait, 132 divided by 927. Let me do it more accurately. 927 * 0.1438 = 927 * 0.1 is 92.7, 0.04 is 37.08, 0.003 is 2.781, 0.0008 is 0.7416. Adding them up: 92.7 +37.08 is 129.78, plus 2.781 is 132.561, plus 0.7416 is 133.3026. Hmm, that's a bit over 132. So maybe the exact value is a bit less than 0.1438, giving a percentage a bit less than 14.38%.

Wait, but maybe I should do the division more accurately. Let me calculate 132 ÷ 927.

Let me use a calculator approach in my head. 927 goes into 132 zero times. So we add a decimal point and a zero, making it 1320. 927 goes into 1320 once (927), subtract, we get 393. Bring down another zero, making 3930. 927 goes into 3930 four times (4*927=3708), subtract to get 222. Bring down another zero, making 2220. 927 goes into 2220 twice (2*927=1854), subtract to get 366. Bring down a zero, making 3660. 927 goes into 3660 three times (3*927=2781), subtract to get 879. Bring down another zero, making 8790. 927 goes into 8790 nine times (9*927=8343), subtract to get 447. Bring down another zero, making 4470. 927 goes into 4470 4 times (4*927=3708), subtract to get 762. Bring down another zero, making 7620. 927 goes into 7620 8 times (8*927=7416), subtract to get 204. Bring down another zero, making 2040. 927 goes into 2040 two times (2*927=1854), subtract to get 186. Bring down another zero, making 1860. 927 goes into 1860 once (927), subtract to get 933. Bring down another zero, making 9330. 927 goes into 9330 ten times (10*927=9270), subtract to get 60. Bring down another zero, making 600. 927 goes into 600 zero times, so we can stop here.

Putting it all together, the decimal is approximately 0.1438. So 0.1438 multiplied by 100 is approximately 14.38%. So the percentage increase is about 14.38%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 14.239%. Hmm, wait, but I calculated around 14.38. Let me check if I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 132/927 exactly. Let me try that.

927 × 0.14 = 130. 927 × 0.143 = 927 × 0.1 = 92.7; 0.04 = 37.08; 0.003 = 2.781. Adding gives 92.7 +37.08=129.78 +2.781=132.561. So 0.143 gives 132.561, which is higher than 132. So 0.143 is a bit higher than needed. So 0.143 is 0.143 × 927 = 132.561, which is 132.561. We have 132, so 0.143 is a bit over. So the exact value is a little less than 0.143.

So 132 /927 = approximately 0.1438 (as I thought earlier). So 14.38% is the exact value. Now checking the options, the closest is option I: 14.239%. Hmm, that's a bit lower. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe my approach is wrong. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the percentage increase as (new - old)/old, but maybe the question is using a different method. Or perhaps I made a mistake in initial calculation.

Wait another approach: 927 to 1059 is an increase of 132. So, 132 is what percentage of 927. So 132/927 ×100 = ?

Let me compute 132 ÷ 927 exactly. Let me write it as 132 ÷927.

Let me see, 927 × 0.14 = 130. So 0.14 is 130, and 0.143 would be 132.561, as before. So 132 is 0.1438 ×927, which is 14.38%. So about 14.38%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 14.239%. Hmm, but that's a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the exact calculation without rounding.

Wait, let me try to compute 132 divided by 927 more accurately. Let's do the division step by step.

927 ) 132.0000

927 goes into 1320 once (1 ×927=927). Subtract: 1320-927=393.

Bring down 0: 3930.

927 goes into 3930 four times (4×927=3708). Subtract: 3930-3708=222.

Bring down 0:2220.

927 goes into 2220 twice (2×927=1854). Subtract: 2220-1854=366.

Bring down 0:3660.

927 goes into 3660 three times (3×927=2781). Subtract: 3660-2781=879.

Bring down 0:8790.

927 goes into 8790 nine times (9×927=8343). Subtract: 8790-8343=447.

Bring down 0:4470.

927 goes into 4470 four times (4×927=3708). Subtract: 4470-3708=762.

Bring down 0:7620.

927 goes into 7620 eight times (8×927=7416). Subtract:7620-7416=204.

Bring down 0:2040.

927 goes into 2040 two times (2×927=1854). Subtract:2040-1854=186.

Bring down 0:1860.

927 goes into 1860 once (1×927=927). Subtract:1860-927=933.

Bring down 0:9330.

927 goes into 9330 ten times (10×927=9270). Subtract:9330-9270=60.

Bring down 0:600.

927 goes into 600 zero times. So we have 0.

So the decimal is 0.143848450...

So up to 0.143848.

Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 14.3848%.

So approximately 14.38%, which is about 14.4%. So looking at the options:

A:10% → nope.
B:22.7% → nope.
C:16.8% → nope.
D:20.4% → nope.
E:17.3% → nope.
F:18.6% → nope.
G:13.5% → nope.
H:12.5% → nope.
I:14.239% → close to 14.38% but a bit lower.
J:15.2% → nope.

Wait, so none of the options exactly match 14.38%. But option I is 14.239. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check the initial increase.

Wait another approach: maybe the question is about the percentage increase from 927 to 1059, so the increase is 132, which over the original 927 is 132/927. Let me compute that using a calculator.

Wait, maybe I'll do it more accurately. Let me try:

927 ) 132.000000

Wait, 927 goes into 1320 once. 1×927=927. 1320−927=393.

Bring down 0: 3930.

927 goes into 3930 four times (4×927=3708). 3930−3708=222.

Bring down 0:2220.

927 goes into 2220 twice (2×927=1854). 2220−1854=366.

Bring down 0:3660.

927 goes into 3660 three times (3×927=2781). 3660−2781=879.

Bring down 0:8790.

927 goes into 8790 nine times (9×927=8343). 8790−8343=447.

Bring down 0:4470.

927 goes into 4470 four times (4×927=3708). 4470−3708=762.

Bring down 0:7620.

927 goes into 7620 eight times (8×927=7416). 7620−7416=204.

Bring down 0:2040.

927 goes into 2040 two times (2×927=1854). 2040−1854=186.

Bring down 0:1860.

927 goes into 1860 once (1×927=927). 1860−927=933.

Bring down 0:9330.

927 goes into 9330 once (1×927=927). 9330−927=8370? Wait, no, 9330−927=8403.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the previous step. Let me correct that.

Wait, 9330 minus 927 is 8403? No, 927 is 927, so 9330-927=9330-927=8403? Wait, 927 is 927, so 9330-927=9330-927= 9330-900=8430, minus 27 gives 8403.

So 8403.

Bring down a 0:84030.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused, let me recount:

After 927 goes into 8403 once (927), the remainder is 8403-927=7476. Then bring down another 0: 74760.

Wait, this is getting complicated, but the point is that the decimal is approximately 0.143848, which is about 14.38% as before.

So none of the options exactly match this. Looking at the options, option I is 14.239%, which is close but a bit lower. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me try another approach: maybe I should compute (1059-927)/927 *100.

1059-927=132.

132 /927 = ?

Let me compute 132 ÷ 927.

Perhaps I can write it as 132/927 = (132 ÷ 927) = 0.1438.

But looking at the options, let's see what 132/927 is as a percentage.

Wait, maybe I can cross-check with the options. For example, option I is 14.239%, which is higher than 14.38%? No, wait 14.239 is less than 14.38. So perhaps I'm off by a small margin.

Wait, perhaps the question is to find the increase, but maybe it's using a different method, like percentage points or something else. But that's not likely.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute (1059 /927) -1, which is the growth rate.

Wait, that's exactly what I did. So 1059/927 is 1.1438, minus 1 is 0.1438, which is 14.38%.

So the correct percentage increase is approximately 14.38%, which is closest to option I: 14.239%. But wait, 14.38 is 14.38. Option I is 14.239, which is about 14.24. So that's a difference of about 0.14%.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, the closest is option I. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another thought: perhaps the question is using a different formula. Let me make sure. Percentage increase is always (new - old)/old *100. So 132/927=14.38%. So the correct answer should be 14.38%, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer is option I:14.239%.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate 132/927 without rounding. Let me do that.

132 ÷ 927.

Let me use long division:

927 ) 132.000000

First, 927 goes into 1320 once (1×927=927). Subtract from 1320: 393.

Bring down a 0: 3930.

927 goes into 3930 four times (4×927=3708). Subtract: 3930−3708=222.

Bring down a 0:2220.

927 goes into 2220 twice (2×927=1854). Subtract: 2220−1854=366.

Bring down a 0:3660.

927 goes into 3660 three times (3×927=2781). Subtract:3660−2781=879.

Bring down a 0:8790.

927 goes into 8790 nine times (9×927=8343). Subtract:8790−8343=447.

Bring down a 0:4470.

927 goes into 4470 four times (4×927=3708). Subtract:4470−3708=762.

Bring down a 0:7620.

927 goes into 7620 eight times (8×927=7416). Subtract:7620−7416=204.

Bring down a 0:2040.

927 goes into 2040 two times (2×927=1854). Subtract:2040−1854=186.

Bring down a 0:1860.

927 goes into 1860 once (1×927=927). Subtract:1860−927=933.

Bring down a 0:9330.

927 goes into 9330 once (1×927=927). Subtract:9330−927=8403.

Bring down a 0:84030.

927 goes into 84030 nine times (9×927=8343). Subtract:84030−8343=603.

Bring down a 0:6030.

927 goes into 6030 six times (6×927=5562). Subtract:6030−5562=468.

Bring down a 0:4680.

927 goes into 4680 five times (5×927=4635). Subtract:4680−4635=45.

Bring down a 0:450.

927 goes into 450 zero times. So we have the decimal as 0.143848...

So up to four decimal places, it's 0.1438.

So 0.1438 ×100 is 14.38%.

So the correct percentage is 14.38%, which is approximately 14.38%, but the options don't have that. The closest is option I:14.239%, which is a bit lower. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake earlier. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1059 - 927)/927 *100.

1059-927=132.

132/927=0.1438.

So 0.1438 ×100=14.38%.

Which is 14.38%. So the correct answer is not listed, but if I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer is option I:14.239%, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the percentage using a different method. For example, sometimes people calculate the percentage increase as (new - old) / (new) ×100, which is the same as what I did. So that's correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But if I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the closest is option I:14.239%.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 132/927.

Wait, let me compute 132 ÷927 again.

I can write this as 132 ÷927 = (132 ÷ 927).

But perhaps I can simplify the fraction.

Let me see if 132 and 927 have any common factors.

132: factors are 2×2×3×11.

927: let's see, 927 ÷3=309. 309 ÷3=103. 103 is a prime number. So factors of 927 are 3×3×103.

So the common factor between 132 and 927 is 3.

So divide numerator and denominator by 3:

132 ÷3=44.

927 ÷3=309.

So now the fraction is 44/309.

Can this be simplified further? Let's see, 44 and 309.

44 factors: 2×2×11.

309: 309 ÷3=103. So 309=3×103.

No common factors between 44 and 309. So the fraction is 44/309.

Compute 44 ÷309.

So 44 ÷309 = approximately 0.14237.

Which is approximately 0.14237, which is about 14.237%.

Looking at the options:

H:12.5% → no.

I:14.239% → which is 0.14239, which is approximately 14.239%.

So 14.237% is approximately 14.237%, and option I is 14.239%, so they are very close.

So the correct answer is approximately 14.237%, which rounds to 14.24%. Option I is 14.239%, which is very close. So the correct answer is option I.

Wait, but wait, the calculation of 44/309 is approximately 0.14237, which is 14.237%, which is approximately 14.24%. Option I is 14.239%, which is 14.24 when rounded to three decimal places.

So the correct answer is option I.

So I think the answer is option I:14.239%.

But wait, let me double-check the exact value of 132/927.

Wait, 132 ÷927.

Using a calculator, 132 ÷927 = 0.14384848...

Which is 0.14384848..., which is approximately 14.3848%.

So the exact percentage increase is approximately 14.3848%, which is approximately 14.38%, which is 14.38%.

But the options don't have that. So the closest option is option I:14.239%, which is 14.239%.

So the answer is option I.
