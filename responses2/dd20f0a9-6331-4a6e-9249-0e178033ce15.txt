Okay, so I've got this history question about the Chinese feudal system. Hmm, I remember that the question is about when Yang-shan took over Lung-shan. Let me think about how I learned this before.

Wait, the question says the last character of the response must be the letter I choose. Oh, right, so I don't have to worry about that part. The question is about the time period.

I think the order of the feudal system was established by the Cultural Revolution, which happened in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The key events were the establishment of the Three Kingdoms, the Seven Dynasties, and then the Cultural Revolution.

So, the Cultural Revolution started around 1912, right? That's about 1912 B.P., but I think it's often said to have started in 1895-1912. Then after that, the feudal systems began to fall apart. I remember that the last part, the Liang (factions like Yang-shan and Lung-shan), took over in 1934. That's around 1934 B.P.

Looking at the options, let's list them out:

A: 1,000 B.P.
B: 8,000 B.P.
C: 7,000 B.P.
D: 3,000 B.P.
E: 6,000 B.P.
F: 2,000 B.P.
G:9,000 B.P.
H:5,000 B.P.
I:1,500 B.P.
J:4,000 B.P.

So, the right answer is 1934 B.P. Looking at the options, that's J:4,000 B.P. Wait, no. Wait, 1934 is J? Let me count the options. The options go from 2000 to 1500 in steps of 1000. So 1900s would be 1900-1999, but the options don't have that. Wait, the options list 2000s as F:2,000, and then 3000s are D, E, etc. So 1934 is 4,000 B.P., which is option J. So the correct answer is J.

The correct answer is J:4,000 B.P., as it corresponds to 1934 B.P., the year when the last character of the response (J) is chosen.

Answer: J
