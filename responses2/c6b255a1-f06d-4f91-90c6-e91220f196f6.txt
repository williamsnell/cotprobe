Okay, so I've got this question about what happens when a potato is immersed in pure water. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when you drop something into water, it can move things around, but in this case, it's a potato in pure water. 

So, pure water means there's no solutes or other chemicals around to affect the potato. The potato, I think, is a plant cell, right? So when you put it into water, water will enter it. That makes sense because water is a solvent, and it'll try to move into the potato's cells.

Wait, but the options are a bit tricky. Let me look at them again. Option A says water moves from surrounding into potato. That sounds correct because the potato is in pure water, so water should enter it. So A would be correct.

But what about the other options? Option B talks about solutes moving into the potato. But wait, the water is already the solvent, and if it's pure water, there's no solute. Unless the potato has something, but the question just says a potato is immersed. I'm guessing the potato is water-holding, so maybe it's just taking up water, not solutes. So B might not be right.

Option C says no movement. But that can't be right. There's definitely movement because water will enter the potato.

Option D: Plasmolyzing. That's when the cell undergoes crenulation and expansion. But plasmolyzing usually happens when you add something that's absorbed by the cell, like food. If it's just water and pure, the cell should just absorb water, not break down. So D might not happen.

Option E: Solutes moving into the water. No, because the potato is in water, so solutes would be in the water. But the question is about what happens to the potato. So E is about solutes in water, which is the other way around. The potato's solutes are probably the same as the surrounding, so E is probably incorrect.

Option F: Water and solutes moving equally. That would mean the potato is neither absorbing nor losing water. But since the water is in pure, the potato would absorb water, so F is wrong.

Option G: The potato dissolves in water. No, potatoes are solid. They don't dissolve in water. So G is wrong.

Option H: Water moves from potato into surrounding. Wait, no, because the potato is in pure water, so water shouldn't move back. So H is incorrect.

Option I: The potato absorbs all the water. That's probably right because the potato is a cell that can take in water. But wait, does it take all? Well, maybe. But does it absorb all, or does it just take in water, which could be a lot. So I think I is correct.

Option J: The potato cells burst. I don't think so. If the potato is just absorbing water, it should expand, but not burst. So J is wrong.

So the correct options should be A and I. Wait, but wait, the question says 'which describes the activity.' So all the options are possibilities. So the question is which options are correct after immersion.

So A is correct. What about I? Does the potato absorb all the water? Well, if it's just a potato, it's a solid cell. So it can't take in that much water. It can only take in as much as it's able to. So maybe I is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the potato is in a beaker with pure water. So the potato is absorbing water, but maybe it doesn't take all the water. So in that case, I wouldn't be correct. So the correct answer should be A and... what about H and I? 

Wait, if I is the potato absorbs all, that might not be correct. So the question is which describes the activity. Let's see the options again.

Wait, the options are about what happens. So which of the options is correct.

Wait, in a pure water environment, the potato absorbs water because water is the solvent. So the potato's cell would take up water, expanding. So the correct answer is A: water moves from surrounding into the potato. Also, the potato's cell plasmolyzes because it's absorbing water, which leads to plasmolysis.

Wait, but the question is about the activity after immersion. So which options are correct.

The options are about what happens. So the first option (A) is definitely correct. The second (I) is not correct, because the potato can't absorb all the water. So only one of A or I can be correct.

Wait, but the question is which of the options describe the activity. So perhaps the correct options are A and I.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice question with options A to J, each a statement, and we need to pick which are correct. But the way the question is phrased, it's a single-answer question; wait no, the options are A to J, and the user is to pick the correct one. Wait, noâ€” the question is, which describes the activity, and the options are A to J, but the user is supposed to choose the correct one, but the user says 'selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. The answer must end with the letter you've chosen.' So, I think the question is asking which of the options A to J is correct. But in the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait no, the options are all possible correct statements, but only one is correct. No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the question is structured as "which of the following describes the activity [...]?" So multiple options could be correct, but the question is presented in a way that expects one letter answer. Wait, perhaps the question is in a setup where only one option is correct.

Wait, the actual question is: which of the following describes the activity after immersion.

So the options are A to J, each a statement, and the user is to choose the correct one.

So the options are:

A: Water moves from surrounding into the potato.

B: Solutes in the water move into the potato.

C: No movement.

D: Plasmolyze.

E: Solutes in the potato move into water.

F: Water and solutes move equally.

G: Potato dissolves.

H: Water moves from potato to surrounding.

I: The potato absorbs all the water.

J: Potato burst.

So which of these is correct.

So A: Correct, because the potato absorbs water from the surroundings.

B: The potato is absorbing water, but solutes can't move into it unless it's absorbing solutes. Since the beaker is pure water, solutes are not present. So B is incorrect.

C: No movement. Incorrect.

D: Plasmolyzing, which occurs when a cell takes in water, expanding. So if the potato absorbs water, it would plasmolyze, making D correct.

But the question is about the activity after immersion. So D is correct because the potato would plasmolyze (absorb water).

Wait, but the question is about what happens. So after immersion, the potato absorbs water. So D is correct.

Wait, but A and D are both correct? Or perhaps only one is correct. Let's re-examine.

A: Water moves from surrounding into potato. Correct.

D: Plasmolyze. Correct, because water is absorbed, expanding.

But the question is about the activity. So both A and D would be correct? Or is there only one correct?

Wait, the options are A to J, but the correct answer should be one. So perhaps options A and D are both correct, but the question is presented as a multiple choice with each option being a possible answer.

Wait no, the question is a single-answer question, so only one option is correct. So that suggests that perhaps both A and D are correct. But that's not possible, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps D is incorrect. Because when a potato absorbs water and expands, it undergoes plasmolysis, which is the process of absorbing water leading to expansion. But the question is about the activity, which would imply the result rather than the process.

So, both A and D could be correct. But the options don't allow that. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, but the question is about the activity after immersion. So the correct options are A and D. But the given options are individual statements. So in a multiple-choice question, perhaps both A and D are correct, but the way the options are presented, perhaps the correct one is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is structured so that only one option is correct. So which of the options is correct.

Another angle: when a potato is immersed in pure water, water is taken up by the potato's cells, causing them to expand. So the activity is that the potato absorbs water, which leads to plasmolyzing. So both A and D are correct. But the options don't have an 'A and D' option. So perhaps only A is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option D: Potato cells plasmolyze. That's correct.

Option A: Water moves from surroundings into potato. Correct.

So both A and D are correct. But the way the question is posed, perhaps only one option is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, but the question is about the activity. So both A and D are correct. But the options are presented as separate options, each a statement. So, perhaps the correct answers are A and D. However, in the options provided, I don't see an option that combines A and D.

Wait, perhaps the question is only expecting one correct option, so perhaps D is correct because it's a direct consequence of water absorption.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as 'which of the following describes the activity,' implying that only one is correct. So perhaps only A is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The activity after immersion would involve water moving into the potato, which is option A. Also, the potato would expand (plasmolyze), which is option D.

But the question is about the activity, so all the correct statements are that water moves into the potato, and the potato expands. So both A and D would be correct. But in the options, each is presented as a separate option. 

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 'The potato cells plasmolyze.' That's correct because when water is absorbed, the cells expand. So the activity would be both water moving and the cell expanding.

But if the options are presented as separate, the correct answers would be A and D. But the user is to pick the letter, so perhaps the intended answer is A, and D isn't an option.

Wait, no, the user is to select which of the options is correct. So perhaps both A and D are correct, but in the options given, perhaps only A and D are presented as correct.

Wait, but in the actual options, each is presented as an independent option. So for a multiple-choice question, perhaps only one is correct. So perhaps the intended correct answer is A, and D is correct as a result.

Wait, but if the potato is absorbing water, it's plasmolyzing. So that's correct. So options A and D are correct.

But the options are presented as separate choices. So in the given options, the correct answers are A and D. But the user is to pick one letter. So perhaps the intended correct answer is A, and D is also correct.

Wait, the user is to choose the letter. So the options are multiple choice where only one option is correct.

Looking back, the correct statements are A and D. But in the options, each is an individual option.

So perhaps the answer is A, and D is also correct. But since the user is to choose one, perhaps the intended answer is A.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A and D are both correct, but the options don't allow for that. So perhaps the intended correct answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, but that's not considering the movement.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A. Because when the potato absorbs water, water moves into it, and the activity is that. The plasmolyzing is a consequence.

So the correct answer is A.

The question asks about the activity after a potato is immersed in pure water. Let's analyze the options:

- **A: Water moves from the surrounding water into the potato.**  
  This is correct because pure water lacks solutes, so water will enter the potato.

- **B: Solutes in the water move into the potato.**  
  Incorrect because the potato is in pure water; solutes are not present.

- **C: No movement of water or solutes occurs.**  
  Incorrect because water will enter the potato.

- **D: Potato cells plasmolyze.**  
  Correct because the potato absorbs water, causing it to expand (plasmolyzing).

- **E: Solutes in the potato move into the water.**  
  Incorrect because the potato is in pure water, so solutes remain there.

- **F: Water and solutes move equally in both directions.**  
  Incorrect because water moves into the potato, and solutes remain in the water.

- **G: The potato dissolves in the water.**  
  Incorrect because potatoes are solid and do not dissolve in water.

- **H: Water moves from the potato into the surrounding water.**  
  Incorrect because water moves into the potato, not out.

- **I: The potato absorbs all of the water.**  
  Incorrect because the potato can only absorb as much water as it can.

- **J: The potato cells burst due to water intake.**  
  Incorrect because the potato does not burst; it simply expands.

Both **A** and **D** are correct, but since the question asks for the activity and not the process, the most direct and complete answer is **A**. The potato's expansion due to water absorption is a key activity after immersion.
