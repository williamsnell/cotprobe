Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the doctrine of substantial performance, and I need to figure out which option correctly illustrates that concept. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should remember what substantial performance means. From what I recall, substantial performance is about the contract being satisfied beyond just the performance of the work. It's about the contract being fulfilled as intended, not just the work being done. So it's about the work and the conditions being met.

The options are A to H, each giving a different scenario. Let me go through each one.

Option A: A contract required hair styling to be done to Toby's satisfaction but Toby was in good faith dissatisfied. Wait, if the work is required to be done to satisfy the contract, then satisfying it (doing the styling) would be substantial performance. But here, it's about Toby being dissatisfied. So maybe this is about satisfaction, not performance. So maybe this isn't substantial performance.

Option B: Leslie painted an entire room but failed to put the electrical outlet covers back on. This seems to be about the work done (painted the room) and the condition of the work (electrical covers not put on). So the work was done, but the condition wasn't met. So this is about performance but not substantial performance because the conditions weren't satisfied.

Option C: Blair ordered a dozen blue chairs but Kyle delivered red. This is about the quantity and type of chairs. The contract might specify the type, but if the delivery doesn't meet the type, it's just wrong quantity or type, not substantial performance. So not this one.

Option D: A carpenter built a bookshelf but used pine instead of oak. So the contract probably required oak, but the work used another material. So the work wasn't done as per the contract. So this is about performance not met, so not substantial performance.

Option E: A dentist extracted Lee's tooth correctly but mistakenly pulled another. So the work was done correctly, but the wrong tooth was removed. The performance was correct, but the outcome was wrong. So this would not be substantial performance because the work was done correctly, but the outcome was wrong. So this doesn't fit.

Option F: A builder forgot to install the kitchen sink. So he did the work (constructed the house) but didn't put in the kitchen sink. So the work was done, but the condition wasn't met. So no substantial performance.

Option G: A chef used pepper instead of salt. So he did the work but didn't follow the terms. The contract probably required salt, but he used pepper. So same as D, performance not met, so not substantial.

Option H: A mechanic fixed a car but forgot to change the oil. So the work is done (fixed the car), but the condition wasn't met (oil changed). So performance was done, but conditions weren't. So this is substantial performance because the work was done as intended.

So reviewing each, the only option where the work was done as intended and the conditions were met is option H.

The correct answer is H. In option H, the mechanic fixed the car without changing the oil, fulfilling the contract's requirement and meeting the necessary condition. This exemplifies substantial performance. 

Answer: H
