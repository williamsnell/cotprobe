Okay, so I've got this question about the experience of feeling shame and guilt upon admitting to a counselor about a family problem. The options are various ethnic groups, and I need to pick which one is correct. Let me think through this.

First, I remember that there's a concept called "Americanization" in the context of American culture and how different groups have historically contributed to it. Americanization refers to the process by which non-English speaking groups have integrated into the American culture, often through cultural exchange and influence.

So, the question is about someone who says, "I've been feeling intense feelings of shame and guilt," which could be part of the process of Americanization. This is because many groups have historically contributed to the development of American culture. The question is about what group is most commonly associated with this phenomenon.

Looking at the options, A is Eastern European-Americans. But I'm not sure if that's the primary group. B is Asian-Americans, C is African-Americans, D is Native North Americans, E is European-Americans, F is Hispanic, G is Caribbean-Americans.

I know that the integration of various groups into the US has been a big part of Americanization. For example, African Americans have a strong presence in the cultural and social landscapes of the country. Similarly, Native Americans have been a significant part of the nation's identity. Asian-Americans, especially from certain regions, have also contributed a lot. European-Americans, like those from the Midwest or Northeast, have been a big part of US life.

I recall that the term "Americanization" often refers to the integration of non-English speaking populations, but it can also include the integration of various cultural groups. Since the question is about the last character of the answer being the chosen option, I think the correct answer is likely African-Americans because they've been a major part of the cultural fabric of the US. African Americans have been a significant cultural force, contributing to the nation's identity through music, literature, and daily life.

So, looking at the options, the correct answer should be C: African-Americans.

The correct answer is C: African-Americans. African-Americans have been a significant cultural force in the United States, contributing to its identity through various cultural practices and contributions. This aligns with the concept of Americanization, which often involves the integration of non-English speaking groups into the cultural landscape.

Answer: C
