Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the electrostatic force between two down quarks in a neutron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to figure it out step by step.

Wait, the problem says the neutron has one up quark and two down quarks. The charges are given: up is +2e/3 and each down is -e/3. Right, e is the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs.

The question is about the electrostatic force between the two down quarks. Oh wait, I remember Coulomb's law formula. It's F = k * |q1 * q2| / r², where k is Coulomb's constant (8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

So the two down quarks each have a charge of -e/3. Since they're both negative, their product is positive. So the force should be attractive, but the question just asks for the magnitude, so the sign doesn't matter here.

Let me write down the values. Each down quark has a charge of (-e/3) and there are two of them. So the product q1*q2 would be ( (-e/3) ) * ( (-e/3) ) = (e^2)/(9). Since the product is positive, the force will be positive.

Now, let's plug in the numbers. The distance between them is given as 2.6e-15 meters. Wait, exactly 2.6 × 10^-15 m.

So F = k * (e^2)/(9) / r².

Wait, let me compute each part.

Calculating e^2: (1.602e-19 C)^2 = (approx) (2.56e-38 C²).

But wait, let me do it accurately. 1.602^2 is about 2.566. So e^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

Then, (e^2)/(9) is (2.566e-38) /9 ≈ 2.851e-39 C².

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute e^2 first: 1.602e-19 squared is (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = 2.566e-38 C².

Divide by 9: 2.566e-38 /9 = approximately 2.851e-39.

So (e^2)/(9) is about 2.851e-39 C².

Now, the denominator is r squared: (2.6e-15 m)^2. Let me compute that.

2.6 squared is 6.76. So r² = (6.76) * (1e-30) m². Because (1e-15)^2 is 1e-30. So 6.76e-30 m².

Now, the force F is k times that divided by r². 

So F = 8.988e9 * (2.851e-39) / (6.76e-30) 

Wait, wait, no. Let me rearrange the formula correctly.

F = (k * |q1 q2|) / r².

So substituting:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

q1 q2 = (e/3)^2 * (-)(-) = (e²)/(9) = (2.566e-38 C²)/(9) ≈ 2.851e-39 C².

r = 2.6e-15 m. So r squared is (2.6e-15)^2 = 6.76e-30 m².

So F = (8.988e9) * (2.851e-39) / (6.76e-30).

Let me compute the numerator first: 8.988e9 * 2.851e-39.

Multiply 8.988e9 by 2.851e-39.

Hmm, 8.988 * 2.851 = approximately let's see. 8 * 2.851 is 22.808, 0.988 * 2.851 ≈ ~2.82. So total is about 25.628. The exponents are 1e9 * 1e-39 = 1e-30. So numerator is about 25.628e-30.

Wait, wait: 8.988e9 * 2.851e-39 = (8.988 * 2.851) * 1e(9-39) = 25.628 * 1e-30 = 2.5628e-29.

Wait, wait no. Wait, 8.988e9 is 8.988 × 1e9, and 2.851e-39 is 2.851 × 1e-39. Multiplying them: 8.988 * 2.851 = approx 25.628. Then the exponents are 1e9 * 1e-39 = 1e-30. So 25.628e-30 = 2.5628e-29.

Then, divide by 6.76e-30 m².

So F = (2.5628e-29) / (6.76e-30) 

Let me compute that. 2.5628e-29 / 6.76e-30 = (2.5628 /6.76) * (1e-29 /1e-30) 

2.5628 /6.76 ≈ approx 0.3787.

1e-29 /1e-30 = 10.

So 0.3787 *10 = 3.787. So F ≈ 3.787 N.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the exponents.

Wait, the formula is F = (k |q1 q2|) / r².

Let me compute k * |q1 q2| first.

k is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

q1 and q2 are both (-e/3), so |q1 q2| is (e/3)^2 = e²/9.

So |q1 q2| = (e²)/9 = ( (1.602e-19)^2 ) /9.

Which is (2.566e-38) /9 = approx 2.851e-39 C².

So F = (8.988e9) * (2.851e-39) / ( (2.6e-15)^2 )

Wait, wait, (2.6e-15)^2 is 6.76e-30 m².

So F = (8.988e9 * 2.851e-39) / 6.76e-30.

Multiply 8.988e9 * 2.851e-39 = (8.988 *2.851) *1e9 *1e-39 = 25.628 *1e-30 = 2.5628e-29.

Divide that by 6.76e-30: 2.5628e-29 / 6.76e-30 = (2.5628 /6.76 ) * (1e-29 /1e-30) ) → 0.3787 * 10 = 3.787.

So approximately 3.787 N.

Looking at the options, option H is 6.3N, option I is 5.1N, option D is 3.8N, option E is 3.2N, option C is 2.5N, option F is4.3N, etc.

Wait, my calculation is about 3.787 N, which is approximately 3.8 N. So the closest option is D: 3.8 N.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let me redo the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute it step by step.

Compute each part.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

q1 and q2 are both (-e/3), so their product is (e/3)^2 = e²/(9) = (1.602e-19)^2 /9.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

Divide by 9: 2.566e-38 /9 ≈ 2.851e-39 C².

r = 2.6e-15 m, so r squared is (2.6e-15)^2 = (2.6)^2 * (1e-15)^2 = 6.76e-30 m².

Now, F = (8.988e9) * (2.851e-39) / (6.76e-30).

Compute numerator first: 8.988e9 * 2.851e-39.

= 8.988 * 2.851 * 1e9 *1e-39.

Compute 8.988 *2.851.

8 *2.851=22.808, 0.988 *2.851= approx 2.82. So sum is 25.628.

Exponents: 1e9 *1e-39 =1e-30.

So numerator is 25.628e-30 = 2.5628e-29.

Now, denominator is 6.76e-30 m².

So F = (2.5628e-29) / (6.76e-30) = (2.5628 /6.76) * (1e-29 /1e-30) 

2.5628/6.76 ≈ let's compute:

6.76 × 0.378 = ?

6.76 × 0.378: 6 × 0.378 = 2.268. 0.76 × 0.378 ≈ 0.287. Sum 2.268 +0.287= 2.555. So 6.76 × 0.378 ≈ 2.555, which is close to 2.5628.

So 2.5628 /6.76 ≈ 0.3787.

Then (1e-29)/1e-30 is 10.

So 0.3787 *10 =3.787 → approx 3.8 N.

So the magnitude is about 3.8 N. Looking at the options, option D is 3.8N. So the answer should be D.

To calculate the electrostatic force between the two down quarks in a neutron, we use Coulomb's law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}
\]

### Given:
- Charge of each down quark: \( q_1 = q_2 = -\frac{e}{3} \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \).
- Distance between quarks: \( r = 2.6 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{m} \).
- Coulomb's constant: \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the charges
The charges of the quarks are:
\[
q_1 = q_2 = -\frac{e}{3} = -\frac{1.602 \times 10^{-19}}{3} \approx -5.34 \times 10^{-20} \, \mathrm{C}.
\]

The product of the charges is:
\[
q_1 q_2 = \left(-\frac{e}{3}\right) \left(-\frac{e}{3}\right) = \frac{e^2}{9} = \frac{(1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2}{9}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( e^2 \)
\[
e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \mathrm{C^2}.
\]

Thus:
\[
q_1 q_2 = \frac{2.566 \times 10^{-38}}{9} \approx 2.851 \times 10^{-39} \, \mathrm{C^2}.
\]

### Step 3: Square the distance
\[
r^2 = (2.6 \times 10^{-15})^2 = 6.76 \times 10^{-30} \, \mathrm{m^2}.
\]

### Step 4: Apply Coulomb's law
Substitute into Coulomb's law:
\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} = \left(8.988 \times 10^9\right) \cdot \frac{2.851 \times 10^{-39}}{6.76 \times 10^{-30}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.851 \times 10^{-39} = 25.628 \times 10^{-30} = 2.5628 \times 10^{-29}.
\]

Then, divide by the denominator:
\[
\frac{2.5628 \times 10^{-29}}{6.76 \times 10^{-30}} = \frac{2.5628}{6.76} \cdot \frac{10^{-29}}{10^{-30}} \approx 0.3787 \cdot 10 = 3.787 \, \mathrm{N}.
\]

### Final Calculation
The magnitude of the electrostatic force is approximately \( 3.787 \, \mathrm{N} \). Comparing with the options, the closest value is **3.8 N**.
