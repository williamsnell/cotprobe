Question:

A witness lived next door to a victim. Late one night, the witness overheard the victim scream, "The defendant, please don't do it!" The next day the victim was found dead in her bedroom. The defendant was arrested and charged with murdering the victim. At trial, the witness proposes to testify to the victim's statement. Upon objection by defendant's counsel, the court should rule the witness's testimony regarding the victim's statement

Options:

A: admissible as a past recollection recorded if the witness can confirm the statement was made.
B: admissible as a dying declaration if the jury determines that the victim believed that her death was imminent.
C: admissible as a dying declaration if the judge, by preponderance of the evidence, determines that the victim believed that her death was imminent.
D: inadmissible, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
E: inadmissible, because the statement was not made under oath.
F: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
G: inadmissible, because the statement is considered a character evidence.
H: admissible, because the statement is a present sense impression.
I: inadmissible, because the statement can lead to a character attack on the defendant.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically concerning whether a statement from a victim can be admissible as a dying declaration. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that a witness heard a victim scream, "The defendant, please don't do it!" The next day the victim died in her bedroom, and the defendant was charged with murder. The witness tried to testify to this statement, but the defendant's counsel opposed it. The question is whether the testimony is admissible.

Hmm, I remember that dying declarations are a recognized hearsay exception. They can be used if a person was in a position of emergency, and their statement was made when they believed their death was imminent. But wait, there are some conditions for when a dying declaration can be used.

First, the statement must be made under oath. Because if it's not, it's not a hearsay exception. The statement here was made by the witness, but wait, the witness is the one whose statement is being used as evidence. So, the statement is made by the witness. But the question is whether that's admissible.

Wait, another point: the statement was made late, and the victim was found dead the next day. But the key is that the statement was made when the victim was dying. So, I think that makes it a dying declaration.

But wait, the fact that it's a statement made by the witness and not an oath may be a problem. Because hearsay requires the statement to be made under oath, so if it's not under oath, it's not hearsay. So, if the statement was told in person, not by an oath, it's not a hearsay exception.

Wait, but let me think again. The question says the witness proposed to testify, so that's the statement. The statement was made, but is it under oath? The question doesn't say. So, if it's not under oath, then it's not a hearsay exception. So, it can't be admitted as a dying declaration because it's not under oath.

Wait, what about the options?

Looking at the options, option E says it's inadmissible because the statement wasn't made under oath. That sounds correct because if it's not under oath, it can't be used as a dying declaration. So E would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, if the statement was made under oath, then it's a dying declaration. But in this case, I think it's not. Because the witness is the one making the statement, and the question doesn't specify whether it was under oath. So, the answer depends on that.

Wait, but the question says the witness proposed to testify, which doesn't necessarily mean it was under oath. So the statement is not under oath, so it's not a dying declaration. So the statement cannot be admitted as a dying declaration.

So the options: E says inadmissible because the statement wasn't made under oath. That would make sense.

Another point: the statement was made late and the victim was found dead. Does that affect anything? Well, if the statement was made when the victim was dying, regardless of when it was made, it's a dying declaration.

So the correct answer is E.

The statement made by the witness is not admissible as a dying declaration because it was not made under oath. The correct answer is E, as the statement was not under oath.

Answer: E
