Okay, so I have this logic problem about truth tables to determine if a set of propositions is consistent. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about using indirect truth tables to determine consistency. Consistency means that there's at least one way to assign truth values to the variables without causing a contradiction. If it's consistent, there's a valuation that makes all the propositions true. If it's inconsistent, no such valuation exists.

The propositions given are:

1. A ⊃ (~B ∨ C)  --> This is equivalent to (¬A ∨ (¬B ∨ C)) or (¬A ∨ ¬B ∨ C)
2. C ⊃ D  --> (¬C ∨ D)
3. A ∨ (B · ~D)  --> (A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ ¬D)
4. A ≡ (B ⊃ D)  --> (A → (B → D)) which is equivalent to (¬A ∨ (¬B ∨ D)) or (¬A ∨ ¬B ∨ D)

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break each down.

First, maybe I can simplify each statement to their logical forms. Let me see:

1. A implies (not B or C). So if A is true, then either B is false or C is true.
2. C implies D. So if C is true, D must be true. If C is false, D can be anything.
3. A or (B and not D). So if A is true, that makes the whole statement true. If B is true and D is false, then it's true.
4. A if and only if (B implies D). So A equals (B implies D). Which again is (A implies B implies D). Wait, maybe it's easier to think of it as (A → (B → D)), which is equivalent to (¬A ∨ (¬B ∨ D)). So if A is true, then either B is false or D is true.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find a way to represent all of this and see if there's a possible assignment where all are true.

Alternatively, maybe I can try to find a consistent assignment by looking for a combination where each proposition holds.

Let me think about different scenarios.

Option A: All variables are true.

Let me check each proposition.

1. A ⊃ (~B ∨ C) → T ⊃ (~T ∨ T) → T ⊃ (F ∨ T) → T ⊃ T → T → holds.

2. C ⊃ D → T ⊃ T → holds.

3. A ∨ (B ∧ ~D) → T ∨ (T ∧ F) → T ∨ F → T → holds.

4. A ≡ (B → D) → T ≡ (T → T) → T ≡ T → holds. So all propositions hold when A, B, C, D are true. So this valuation is consistent. So option A says it's inconsistent, which can't be; because I found a valuation that works. So A is incorrect.

Wait, looking back, the options are labeled A to J, and the question is about whether the set is consistent. If it's consistent, pick the option. So which option is correct?

Wait, the problem also says, "If the set is consistent, choose an option with a consistent valuation. (There may be other consistent valuations.)" So I need to find which option describes a consistent set, i.e., one that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again.

Wait, the question is to determine if the set is consistent. If it's consistent, pick the option that says it is, otherwise pick the option saying it's inconsistent and provide the valuation.

So the answer options are A to H, and I and J are about inconsistency.

Wait, looking at the options:

A: Inconsistent. Inconsistent valuation when B and D are true and A and C are false.

Wait, if A is inconsistent, that means there's no assignment where all four are true. But I found one assignment where all are true, so A is incorrect.

Option B: Consistent. Consistent valuation when A, B, C, and D are all false.

But if A is false, then let's see:

1. A ⊃ (¬B ∨ C) → F ⊃ (T ∨ T) → F → T is T, so holds.

2. C ⊃ D → T → F → T → holds.

3. A ∨ (B ∧ ~D) → F ∨ (F ∧ T) → F ∨ F → F → so proposition 3 would be false. So this would not satisfy all propositions. So option B's valuation doesn't work, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Consistent. Valuation when A and D are true, B and C are false.

So A=T, D=T; B=F, C=F.

Check each:

1. A ⊃ (¬B ∨ C) → T ⊃ (T ∨ F) → T ⊃ T → T → holds.

2. C ⊃ D → F ⊃ T → T → holds.

3. A ∨ (B ∧ ~D) → T ∨ (F ∧ T) → T → holds.

4. A ≡ (B → D) → T ≡ (F → T) → T ≡ T → T → holds.

All hold. So this is a consistent valuation. So C is a possible answer. But wait, I have to check other options to see if any others are also consistent.

Option D: Inconsistent. Inconsistent valuation when A, B, C, and D are all true. We already saw that they are all true works, so D is incorrect.

Option E: Consistent. Valuation when B, C, D are true and A is false.

Check:

1. A=T → A is F (since A is false), so A ⊃ (¬B ∨ C) → F ⊃ (T ∨ F) → F → T → holds.

2. C ⊃ D → T → T → holds.

3. A ∨ (B ∧ ~D) → F ∨ (F ∧ T) → F ∨ F → F → proposition 3 is F → so this makes the third proposition false. So E's assignment doesn't work, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Consistent. Valuation when C and D are true and A and B are false.

So A=F, B=F, C=T, D=T.

Check each:

1. A ⊃ (¬B ∨ C) → F ⊃ (T ∨ T) → F → T → holds.

2. C ⊃ D → T → T → holds.

3. A ∨ (B ∧ ~D) → F ∨ (F ∧ F) → F ∨ F → F → so third prop is F → so this makes third prop false. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Consistent. Valuation when A, B, D are true and C is false.

So A=T, B=T, C=F, D=T.

Check each:

1. A ⊃ (¬B ∨ C) → T ⊃ (F ∨ F) → T → F → so 1st prop is F → so this makes the first prop false. So G's assignment doesn't work, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Consistent. Valuation when A, B, and C are true and D is false.

So A=T, B=T, C=T, D=F.

Check each:

1. A ⊃ (¬B ∨ C) → T ⊃ (F ∨ T) → T → holds.

2. C ⊃ D → T → F → so C → F is false. So this makes the second prop false. So H's assignment doesn't work. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Inconsistent. Valuation when A, C, D are true and B is false.

So A=T, C=T, D=T, B=F.

Check each:

1. A ⊃ (¬B ∨ C) → T ⊃ (T or T) → T → holds.

2. C ⊃ D → T → T → holds.

3. A ∨ (B ∧ ~D) → T ∨ (F ∧ F) → T ∨ F → T → holds.

4. A ≡ (B → D) → T ≡ (F → T) → T ≡ T → T → holds.

So all four propositions are true under this assignment, which makes the set consistent. So option I's assignment works, but I thought C is correct? Wait, no. Let me check the options.

Wait, so the options are A through H, and I is an incorrect option.

Wait, looking back at the options, H is: Consistent. Valuation when A, B, and C are true and D is false. I checked that and it doesn't hold. So the correct consistent valuation is when A, B, D are T and C is F (option H is incorrect), and another is when A=T, B=F, C=F, D=T (option G, which is incorrect).

Wait, but option C is when A=T, B and C=F, D=T. Which works, so option C is correct.

Wait, I thought I had found that, but I should make sure.

Wait, but I had another option, option H, which seems to work. Let me double-check. Option H: A=T, B=T, C=T, D=F.

Check each proposition:

1. A ⊃ (~B ∨ C) → T ⊃ (F ∨ T) → T → holds.

2. C ⊃ D → T → F → F → so this is false. So H's assignment doesn't satisfy all propositions. So H is incorrect.

So only option C's assignment works. So the correct answer is option C.

But wait, I had another option, option H, which also seems to work. Wait, I must have made a mistake. Let me check option H again.

Option H says: Consistent. Valuation when A, B, and C are true and D is false.

So A=T, B=T, C=T, D=F.

Check each:

1. A ⊃ (¬B ∨ C) → T ⊃ (F ∨ T) → T → holds.

2. C ⊃ D → T → F → F → so this is false. So the second proposition fails.

Therefore, option H is incorrect.

So the only correct option is option C, which is Valuation when A=T, B=F, C=F, D=T.

Wait, but wait, let me check option F again. Option F says when C and D are true and A and B are false.

So A=F, B=F, C=T, D=T.

Check each:

1. A ⊃ (¬B ∨ C) → F → (T ∨ T) → F → so the first prop is F, which is bad.

So F is incorrect.

Similarly, option G: when A=T, B=T, C=T, D=F.

1. T → (¬T ∨ T) → T → holds.

2. C=T → D=F → F → so prop 2 is false. So G is incorrect.

So the correct consistent valuation is option C.

Wait, but earlier when I thought of option H, which is incorrect. So the correct answer must be option C.
</think>

The correct answer is option C, as it provides a consistent valuation where A, B, and C are true, and D is false. This assignment satisfies all the propositions without leading to a contradiction.
