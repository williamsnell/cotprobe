Okay, so I've got this problem about Halley's Comet and its orbit. Hmm, the question is asking me to find the maximum distance from the comet to the sun. The orbit is an ellipse with an eccentricity of 0.97, and the major axis is 36.18 AU. One focus is at the sun, so that's like one of the foci of the ellipse.

Wait, right, in an ellipse, the major axis is the longest diameter, and the distance from the center to each end is half the major axis. But wait, actually, the major axis is the longest distance, so each end would be half of that. But wait, no, the major axis is the full length, so each end is the semi-major axis length. Oh, right, the semi-major axis (a) is half of the major axis. So if the major axis is 36.18 AU, then a is 36.18 / 2 = 18.09 AU. Wait, no, wait, no, wait. Wait, major axis is 2a, so a is half of that. So 36.18 / 2 is 18.09 AU.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. So in an ellipse, the semi-major axis is 'a', and the semi-minor axis is 'b'. The distance from the center to each focus is 'c', and the relationship between a, b, and c is a² = b² + c². But in this case, the sun is at one focus. So the sun is at one of the foci of the ellipse.

Wait, but the major axis is the longest diameter. So the distance from the sun to the farthest point (the aphelion) is a + c. Because the semi-major axis is a, and the distance from the center to each focus is c. So the farthest point from the sun would be the vertex of the ellipse along the major axis, which is at a + c.

Wait, but wait, in the case of an ellipse, the farthest point (aphelion) from the sun is a + c, and the closest point (perihelion) is a - c. But in this case, the sun is at one focus, so the distance from the sun to the farthest point (aphelion) is a + c, and to the closest is a - c.

So, the maximum distance from the sun is a + c. But I don't know c yet. I know the eccentricity e is 0.97. And I also know that e is c/a. So since e = c/a, c = e * a. So c = 0.97 * 18.09 AU.

Let me compute that: 0.97 * 18.09. Let me do 18 * 0.97 first. 18 * 0.97 is 17.46, and 0.09 * 0.97 is about 0.0873, so total is 17.5473 AU. So c ≈ 17.5473 AU.

Wait, but wait, that seems large. Let me double-check. 0.97 times 18 is indeed 17.46, and 0.97 times 0.09 is 0.0873, so yes, about 17.55 AU. So c ≈ 17.55 AU.

Then, the maximum distance from the sun is a + c. a is 18.09, so 18.09 + 17.55 = 35.64 AU. Hmm, wait, looking at the options, option J is 35.64 AU. So that's the maximum distance.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The major axis is 2a, so a is 18.09 AU. The distance from the focus to the farthest point is a + c. So yes, that's 18.09 + 17.55 ≈ 35.64 AU. So the answer would be option J.

Wait, but wait, another thought. The semi-major axis is a, and the distance from the center to the focus is c. So in an ellipse, the relationship is a² = b² + c². But I don't think that's needed here since we don't have to find b, but we just need c to find the maximum distance.

Wait, unless there's a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the calculation for c.

e = c/a → c = e*a = 0.97 * 18.09.

Calculating 0.97 * 18.09:

Let me compute it step by step.

18.09 × 0.97:

First, 18.09 × 0.9 = 16.281

Then, 18.09 × 0.07 = 1.2663

Adding them together: 16.281 + 1.2663 = 17.5473 AU.

So c ≈ 17.5473 AU.

Then, a + c = 18.09 + 17.5473 = 35.6373 AU. Which is approximately 35.64 AU, so option J.

So the maximum distance from the sun is 35.64 AU, which is option J.

To determine the maximum distance from Halley's Comet to the sun, we analyze the given parameters of its elliptical orbit. The orbit has a major axis of 36.18 AU, so the semi-major axis \( a \) is half of that:

\[
a = \frac{36.18}{2} = 18.09 \, \text{AU}.
\]

The eccentricity \( e \) of the orbit is given as 0.97, and the relationship between \( e \), the semi-major axis \( a \), and the distance from the center of the ellipse to the focus \( c \) is:

\[
c = e \cdot a = 0.97 \cdot 18.09 = 17.5473 \, \text{AU}.
\]

The maximum distance from the comet to the sun, known as the aphelion, is the sum of the semi-major axis and the distance to the focus:

\[
\text{Aphelion} = a + c = 18.09 + 17.5473 = 35.6373 \, \text{AU}.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the maximum distance is approximately \( 35.64 \, \text{AU} \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**J: 35.64 AU**
