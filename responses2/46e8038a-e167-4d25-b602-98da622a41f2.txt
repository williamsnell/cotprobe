Okay, so I've got this economics question here about monopolistic competition and pure competition. Let me try to think through it.

The question is asking whether a purely competitive market could eventually become monopolistically competitive. And then, why would lower prices in pure competitors not drive out higher-priced monopolistic competitors.

Hmm. I remember that pure competition is characterized by many small firms, homogeneous products, perfect information, and free entry. Monopolistic competition has many firms, differentiation among products, imperfect information, and also free entry.

Monopolistic competitors have higher average costs than pure competitors. So, in pure competition, firms are making normal profits because there are lots of them and perfect competition. Monopolistic competitors have higher costs, so they might make economic profits.

The question is whether a competitive market could become monopolistically competitive. That would mean that the number of firms increases, and each firm has more differentiation. So, the number of firms grows because they can differentiate their products, maybe by introducing unique features.

Now, why would the lower prices not drive out the monopolistic competitors? Well, in monopolistic competition, firms have some control because they're not as homogeneous as in pure competition. But in pure competition, firms are price takers. Monopolistic competitors might set higher prices because they can differentiate their products, maybe through branding, product design, or innovation.

Wait, in pure competition, the price is set by the firms. Monopolistic competitors have higher costs, so their average cost is higher. If the market is competitive but with a large number of firms, maybe the average cost lowers as more firms enter, leading to lower prices. Or perhaps the differentiation is so much that even with lower costs, the extra differentiation isn't enough, so prices don't drop enough to drive them out.

Wait, but in the question, the monopolistic competitor has higher average cost than pure competitor. So in pure competition, each firm is producing at a low average cost, maybe even at normal profit. Monopolistic competitor has higher, maybe higher average cost, so they could be making economic profits.

So, if the market were to shift towards monopolistic competition, perhaps the number of firms increases, and each has more differentiation. So, more firms would mean lower average costs. So, if the average cost is lower, the price could fall. But wait, the question says that the monopolistic competitor has higher average cost than pure competitor. So, perhaps the average cost of the pure competitor is lower, and the monopolistic is higher. So, if the market were to shift to monopolistic competition, maybe the average cost would fall, leading to prices falling. But in this scenario, the monopolistic competitor already has higher average cost.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the shift from pure competition to monopolistic competition. So, the number of firms increases, each with differentiation. That would mean that the average cost could lower if more firms enter. But the question says that the monopolistic competitor has higher average cost. Wait, perhaps the original question is more about whether a competitive market (with free entry) could become monopolistically competitive.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about whether the market could shift from perfect competition to monopolistic competition, which would mean the number of firms increases. So, if all the existing firms decide to differentiate, perhaps the average cost would fall.

Wait, but the question is, if a competitive market becomes monopolistically competitive, why wouldn't lower prices drive out higher-priced monopolistic competitors. So, in monopolistic competition, the firms have some differentiation. If they have higher average cost, maybe the price cannot be driven down enough because the differentiation is enough to keep them profitable. Or perhaps they have less differentiation, so they can lower prices and drive out others.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think about what drives price in a competitive market. In perfect competition, price is determined by the market supply and demand. Firms are price takers. Monopolistic competition has more differentiation, so perhaps the firms can set higher prices because they're more unique. But if the average cost is higher, perhaps they can't. Wait, no, if the average cost is higher, the firm would have to set a higher price to cover costs and make a profit.

Wait, maybe the key is that in perfect competition, firms are price takers and have zero market power. Monopolistic competition has some market power. So, in a competitive market (with free entry), maybe the number of firms increases, leading to lower prices. But why wouldn't the lower price drive out monopolistic competitors?

Oh, wait, perhaps in perfect competition, the number of firms is so high that the average cost is low enough that firms can't cover their costs. Whereas in monopolistic competition, the average cost is higher, so prices are higher. If perfect competition is replaced by monopolistic competition, with lower prices, then the higher prices of monopolistic competitors could drive out the lower prices, but in this case, the question is about the opposite.

Wait, the question is, could a competitive market become monopolistically competitive, and why would the lower prices not drive out the higher-priced monopolistic competitors.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this backwards. Let me think about the shift from perfect competition to monopolistic competition. In perfect competition, there are many firms, homogeneous products, low barriers to entry. Monopolistic competition is more differentiated, so more firms, but each has some differentiation.

If the market becomes monopolistically competitive, perhaps the number of firms increases, and each has more differentiation. If each has higher average cost, then perhaps the price would be higher. But wait, in the question, the monopolistic competitor already has higher average cost than pure competitor. So, perhaps the average cost would be lower in monopolistic competition.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the options.

The options are A to J. Let's go through them.

A: Adoption of homogeneous marketing strategies by all firms. That's more like pure competition, so probably not.

B: Introduction of product differentiation. That would be a key feature of monopolistic competition. So this might be the reason why a competitive market could become monopolistically competitive. Because if you have more differentiation, it's more like monopolistic competition.

C: Price war. If firms are price competition, but considering the scenario, perhaps not. Because if firms are differentiating, maybe the price war isn't the main factor.

D: Mergers of pure competitors into a single entity. That would reduce the number of firms, so perhaps not leading to more differentiation.

E: Increase in production cost. Wait, but the question is about why lower prices wouldn't drive out higher prices. If costs are increasing, maybe prices can't keep up, but that's not directly related to differentiation.

F: Decrease in consumer demand. If demand drops, prices might drop, but that's unrelated to the shift to monopolistic competition.

G: Consumer preference for uniform products. That would mean the market becomes more like perfect competition, so not going from competitive to monopolistically competitive.

H: Elimination of all competition through collusion. That would make it more like pure competition, but if it were to eliminate competition, it wouldn't be monopolistically competitive.

I: Sudden increase in market entry barriers. Maybe, but I'm not sure how that would influence the shift.

J: Shifts in government regulations. Not sure.

So, considering the options, B says product differentiation is introduced. That's key for monopolistic competition. So a competitive market could become monopolistically competitive if product differentiation is introduced, perhaps.

Now, why wouldn't lower prices drive out higher-priced monopolistic competitors. Well, in monopolistic competition, the firms have some differentiation, which might mean they can't lower prices as much. Or, perhaps, their differentiation allows them to set higher prices without necessarily lowering them. Or, maybe, the lack of perfect differentiation means that even if they set higher prices, the lower cost (if any) might allow them to still make a profit.

Wait, but the question states that the monopolistic competitor has higher average cost than the pure competitor. So, in perfect competition, average cost is lower, so firms can set lower prices and make profits. In monopolistic competition, higher average cost. So, perhaps the average cost is higher, so they can't make a profit at the same price, or they have to set higher prices. But why would the lower prices in pure competition not drive the higher prices in monopolistic competitors out.

Wait, but in monopolistic competition, the prices are higher than in perfect competition, because average cost is higher. So, maybe in monopolistic competition, the price is higher, but they can't make the same profit as in pure competition. When the market shifts to monopolistic competition, the prices would be higher. If they set lower prices, they might not make enough profit. But in the question, the monopolistic competitor already has higher prices than the pure competitor. So, if perfect competition is a substitute for monopolistic competition, perhaps the lower prices in perfect competition would drive out monopolistic competitors.

Wait, no, the question is about whether a competitive market (with free entry) could become monopolistically competitive. So, perhaps the number of firms increases, and each has more differentiation, so average cost decreases. That would mean lower prices if more firms enter.

But the question says that the monopolistic competitor has higher average cost. So, perhaps the number of firms is higher, leading to lower average cost. So, perhaps the lower prices (if any) would allow the new firms to lower prices, but that doesn't make sense if they are monopolistically competitive.

Wait, perhaps the key is about why lower prices wouldn't drive out higher prices. Because in monopolistic competition, the average cost is higher, perhaps the firms can't lower prices enough to compete. Or, considering that in perfect competition, each firm is a price taker and can set their own prices, but in monopolistic competition, with differentiation, perhaps the price can't be as low as in perfect competition.

Alternatively, perhaps in perfect competition, the number of firms is so high that the average cost is too low, making everyone make normal profits. Monopolistic competition requires some differentiation, so perhaps the number of firms is so high that the average cost is higher, so the prices are higher.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me think about the options again. The question is about why prices wouldn't drive out higher-priced monopolistic competitors.

So, in perfect competition, each firm has low average cost, so they can set lower prices. Monopolistic competition requires some differentiation, so perhaps the number of firms is so high that the average cost is higher, so the prices are higher. Then, if the market shifts to monopolistic competition, the prices would be higher. But why wouldn't lower prices drive them out? Because in perfect competition, the prices are lower, allowing firms to make profits. In monopolistic competition, the prices are higher, but the higher average cost makes them not profitable. So, the lower prices in perfect competition allow the monopolistic competitors to not compete as much.

Wait, but the question is about the scenario where the market is shifting from perfect competition to monopolistic competition. So, if the number of firms increases, and each is more differentiated, then the average cost would decrease, prices would fall. But in the question, the monopolistic competitor has higher average cost, so perhaps after the shift, the average cost would be lower, causing lower prices.

Wait, but the question says that the monopolistic competitor has higher average cost than pure competitors. So, if the market shifts to monopolistic competition, perhaps the average cost would decrease, making prices fall. So, the lower prices would drive out the higher-priced monopolistic competitors, but the question is why that wouldn't happen.

Wait, perhaps the key is the differentiation itself. Monopolistic competition has more differentiation, so even if the price is higher, they can't lower it as much, so the higher price doesn't drive out the lower.

Wait, but in perfect competition, the price is determined, and each firm is making normal profits. Monopolistic competition would require higher prices to make profits, but perhaps the higher prices are sustainable because of differentiation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to match the options.

Option B: Introduction of product differentiation. That's a key feature of monopolistic competition. So, perhaps a competitive market (which already has differentiation) could become monopolistically competitive.

So, the answer would be B.

The question explores whether a purely competitive market could shift to a monopolistically competitive market and why lower prices in a competitive market would not drive out higher-priced monopolistic competitors. To address this, we analyze the options provided:

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Adoption of homogeneous marketing strategies by all firms**  
   This aligns with pure competition, not monopolistic competition, so this is unlikely to be the reason.

2. **Option B: Introduction of product differentiation**  
   Monopolistic competition is characterized by product differentiation, which is a key feature. A competitive market could indeed shift to monopolistic competition if differentiation is introduced. This option aligns with the scenario described.

3. **Option C: Introduction of price war**  
   Price war is more typical in markets with imperfect competition. While differentiation could lead to price competition, this is not the primary reason for the shift to monopolistic competition.

4. **Option D: Mergers of pure competitors into a single entity**  
   This would reduce the number of firms, not increase differentiation, so it does not explain the shift to monopolistic competition.

5. **Option E: Increase in production cost**  
   While increased costs could affect profitability, the question focuses on the shift in market structure, not immediate cost changes.

6. **Option F: Decrease in consumer demand**  
   Lower demand would affect prices but does not explain the structural shift to monopolistic competition.

7. **Option G: Consumer preference for uniform products**  
   This resembles perfect competition, not monopolistic competition, so it is not the correct reason.

8. **Option H: Elimination of all competition through collusion**  
   Collusion would reduce the number of firms, leading to perfect competition, not monopolistic competition.

9. **Option I: Sudden increase in market entry barriers**  
   Increased barriers could prevent new firms from entering, but this does not explain the structural shift to monopolistic competition.

10. **Option J: Shifts in government regulations**  
    This would affect market structure, but it does not directly address the structural shift.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is **Option B**, as a competitive market could indeed shift to monopolistic competition if product differentiation is introduced. This differentiation is a defining feature of monopolistic competition, allowing firms to maintain higher prices while still making profits due to the differentiation itself.
