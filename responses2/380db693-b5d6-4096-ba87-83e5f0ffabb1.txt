A:  7200$\mathrm{ft-lb}$
B: 14400$\mathrm{ft-lb}$
C: 6000 ft-lb
D: 3000 ft-lb
E: 2400 ft-lb
F: 1800$\mathrm{ft-lb}$
G: 9000 ft-lb
H: 3600$\mathrm{ft-lb}$
I: 10800 ft-lb
J: 4800 ft-lb

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a gorilla climbing a tree. Hmm, the question is asking for the work done by the gorilla. Let me think about how to approach this.

I remember that work is calculated as force multiplied by distance, and the formula is W = F * d. But wait, I should make sure about the units. The force here is given in pounds (lb), and the distance is in feet (ft). Oh, right, in the imperial system, work done against gravity would be force (force in pounds) multiplied by the height climbed in feet. 

So the problem states the gorilla weighs 360 pounds and climbs 20 feet. So the force should be 360 lb, and the distance is 20 ft. Multiplying them together: 360 * 20 = 7200 ft-lb. Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, wait, isn't the formula for work (force) times (distance), yes. So 360 lb times 20 ft gives 7200 ft-lb. Looking at the options, option A is 7200 ft-lb. So that's the answer. 

But wait, another thought: sometimes work can also be considered as mass times acceleration due to gravity times distance. Oh right, but in this problem, they might be expecting you to use the given weight (which is mass times gravity) directly, so yes, that's correct. Because weight is in pounds, which already accounts for the gravitational force, so using force in pounds to multiply by the height gives the work.

So the answer should be option A, 7200 ft-lb.

The work done by the gorilla is calculated using \( W = F \times d \), where \( F = 360 \, \text{lb} \) and \( d = 20 \, \text{ft} \). Thus, \( W = 360 \times 20 = 7200 \, \text{ft-lb} \). 

Answer: A
