Okay, so I've got this question about measurements and precision and accuracy. Hmm, let me think about what I know. 

The question says the true length is 1.010 cm. They took three measurements: 1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm. I need to figure out which statement about these measurements is true.

First, I remember that precision refers to how close the measurements are to each other. So if all the measurements are close, they're precise. Accuracy is about how close each measurement is to the true value. 

So let's look at the measurements: 1.4, 1.2, 0.9. The true value is 1.010. 

Calculating the absolute differences: 

1.4 - 1.010 = 0.390 cm
1.2 - 1.010 = 0.190 cm
0.9 - 1.010 = -0.110 cm → absolute is 0.110 cm.

So the differences are about 0.39, 0.19, and 0.11. The largest difference is about 0.39 cm, and the smallest is 0.11. That suggests the measurements are somewhat close to each other, so they are precise. 

Now about accuracy. The true value is 1.010, and each measurement's distance to this is 0.39, 0.19, 0.11. So they're all not exact, but they are somewhat accurate because they’re all within a reasonable margin of error. 

Wait, but how precise are they? Precision is about consistency, so they're not the same each time. The differences are about 0.39, 0.19, 0.11. So they aren't all the same, so they are somewhat precise.

Putting it together: They are somewhat precise (since they are close to each other) and somewhat accurate (since they are close to the true value). So the correct statement should be option A: They are somewhat precise and somewhat accurate.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me double-check. Sometimes, the term 'precise' can involve how consistent they are, whereas 'accurate' is about being close to the true value. So, yes, they have some precision but aren't all the same, and they are somewhat accurate as well.

Looking at the options again. Option A says they are somewhat precise and somewhat accurate. That fits. 

Other options: Option I says they're accurate but not precise. But we saw that the measurements are not all the same, so they are not precise. So I is incorrect. Option E says they're precise and accurate. That would mean they’re both precise and accurate. But wait, are they accurate? The true value is 1.010 cm. The measurements are 1.4, 1.2, 0.9. The smallest difference is 0.11 cm. So they are not too far off. But for accuracy, each measurement is off by about 0.1 to 0.39 cm. So they are somewhat close to the true value, so they are somewhat accurate. So both precision and accuracy are somewhat true.

Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe there's a nuance I'm missing. Let me think. Precision is about the spread of the measurements. The range here is from 0.9 to 1.4, but the actual true value is in the middle. The spread is 0.5 cm. So they are somewhat precise. 

But what about if the measurements are more spread out? If the spread is large, they're less precise. So in this case, the spread isn't too big, so they are somewhat precise.

As for accuracy, since they are all within 0.11 cm of the true value (the smallest difference is 0.11, the largest is 0.39). So they're not exact, but they are close. So they are somewhat accurate.

So the correct statement is A: They are somewhat precise and somewhat accurate.

The correct statement is:

A: They are somewhat precise and somewhat accurate.

**Explanation:**
- **Precision:** The measurements (1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, 0.9 cm) are close to each other, indicating some level of precision.
- **Accuracy:** The measurements are somewhat close to the true value (1.010 cm), but they are not exact. The largest difference is 0.39 cm, so they are not extremely accurate.

Thus, the measurements are both somewhat precise and somewhat accurate.
