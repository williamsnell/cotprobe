Okay, so I have this question about how many Americans were in favor of the Social Security Act in 1935. The options are A to J, with various percentages. I'm a bit rusty on my history, so I need to think through this carefully.

First, I remember that Social Security was established in 1935 as a social safety net for working Americans. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact numbers of people in favor. I think the total number of Americans in 1935 was around 200 million. That seems right because, by then, the country was still recovering from the Great Depression.

Now, I'm trying to recall the actual numbers of people who supported Social Security. I think the majority were working class and middle class. I remember hearing that around 50-60% of the working class were in favor. So if there were about 200 million people, then 50% would be about 100 million. That would put it around 50%, which is option J. But wait, I also remember that the government's stance varied. Some people might have voted against it, but I think the majority were favorable.

Alternatively, I've heard that the Social Security Act passed, so people might have supported it. But the question is asking for the number in favor, so maybe it's the percentage rather than the absolute number. But the options are percentages, so perhaps the answer is 50%. But wait, another angle: I think the exact percentage of people in favor might have been higher. Or maybe it was exactly 50%, which is option J.

Let me think if I'm mixing up the numbers. I think around 40-50% of the working class were in favor, so 50% of 200 million is 100 million. But I also remember reading somewhere that the majority of the population was in favor. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. I think the majority of people, including non-working class, were against it. So perhaps the working class was a bigger group.

Wait, another approach: I think the Social Security Act passed, so many people were in favor, but the exact percentage might have been around 50%. So the answer would be option J: 50%.

The correct answer is J: 50%. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The question asks for the percentage of Americans in favor of Social Security in 1935.
2. The total population around that time was approximately 200 million.
3. The majority of working class individuals, around 50%, supported the Social Security Act.
4. This percentage aligns with option J: 50%.

Answer: J
