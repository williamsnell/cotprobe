Okay, so I have this differential equation to solve: x squared times y double prime minus 2y equals zero. The initial conditions are y(1) equals 1 and y prime of 1 equals gamma. I need to find gamma such that the solution is bounded as x approaches zero. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, the equation is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation. It looks like it's in the form of x² y'' - 2y = 0. Maybe I can rewrite it as y'' - (2/x²) y = 0. That might help me see the type of equation it is. Wait, I remember that equations of the form y'' + P(x) y' + Q(x) y = 0 can sometimes be solved using power series, especially around a regular singular point.

But wait, in this case, the equation is y'' - (2/x²) y = 0. Let me think about the singular points. The coefficient is (2/x²), which is undefined at x=0, so x=0 is a regular singular point. Hmm, but maybe it's more about the behavior near zero.

I also remember that for equations like this, we can use Frobenius method, which involves assuming a solution of the form y = x^r times a series. So, let's try that approach.

Assume y = x^r (A_0 + A_1 x + A_2 x² + ...) 

Then y' would be r x^{r-1} (A_0 + ...) + x^r (A_1 + 2A_2 x + ...). Similarly, y'' would be r(r-1)x^{r-2} (A_0 + ...) + 2 r x^{r-1}(A_1 + ...) + x^r (2A_2 + 6A_3 x + ...). 

Plugging into the equation: x² y'' - 2y = 0. Let me write each term:

x² y'' = x² [r(r-1)x^{r-2} (A_0 + ...) + 2 r x^{r-1}(A_1 + ...) + x^r (2A_2 + ...) ].

So x² y'' is r(r-1)x^{r} (A_0 + ...) + 2 r x^{r} (A_1 + ...) + x^{r+2} (2A_2 + ...).

Subtracting 2y, which is 2x^r (A_0 + ...), gives:

[r(r-1) x^r + 2 r x^r] (A_0 + ...) + [2A_2 + ...] x^{r+2} - 2x^r (A_0 + ...) = 0.

Wait, perhaps I should factor x^r terms. Let's group them:

x^r [r(r-1) + 2r - 2] A_0 + ... + x^r [2A_2 + 6A_3 x + ...] = 0.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the grouping. Let me re-express x² y'' - 2y:

x² y'' = [r(r-1) x^r A_0 + 2 r x^r A_1 + (r(r-1)+2r) x^{r+1} A_0 + ...] ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to match the coefficients for each power of x.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the indicial equation.

In the Frobenius method, the indicial equation is obtained by looking at the lowest power of x. So, in the equation after substitution, the coefficient of x^r would be the indicial equation. Let's see:

From x² y'' -2y = 0, the coefficient of y'' is x², so when we expand y'', we get:

y'' = [r(r-1) x^{r-2} + 2r x^{r-1} + (r(r-1) + 2r) x^{r} + ... ] A_0 + ...

Wait, perhaps I should write the equation again:

x² y'' - 2y = 0 → y'' = (2/x²) y.

So, substituting the Frobenius series into this equation, we get:

x² [r(r-1) x^{r-2} A_0 + 2r x^{r-1} A_0 + (r(r-1) + 2r) x^r A_0 + ... ] - 2 [x^r (A_0 + A_1 x + A_2 x² + ...) ] = 0.

Let me compute each term:

y'' term:

r(r-1) x^{r-2} A_0 → multiplied by x² gives r(r-1) x^r A_0.

Similarly, 2r x^{r-1} A_0 → multiplied by x² gives 2r x^{r+1} A_0.

And (r(r-1) + 2r) x^r A_0 → multiplied by x² gives (r² -r +2r) x^r A_0 = (r² + r) x^r A_0.

Subtracting 2y:

2 [x^r A_0 + x^{r+1} A_1 + x^{r+2} A_2 + ... ].

So putting it all together:

The terms with x^r:

From y'':
r(r-1) A_0 x^r + 2r A_0 x^{r+1} + (r² + r) A_0 x^r.

Subtract 2y:
-2 A_0 x^r.

So the coefficient of x^r is:

[r(r-1) + (r² + r) - 2] A_0.

Wait, no. Wait, let me collect all the x^r terms:

From y'':
r(r-1) A_0 x^r + (r(r-1) + 2r) A_0 x^r → which is r(r-1) A_0 x^r + (r² + r) A_0 x^r.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express:

The coefficient of x^r in the entire equation (y'') - 2y = 0 is:

[r(r-1) A_0 + (r(r-1) + 2r) A_0] - 2 A_0.

Wait, no. Because the terms from y'' are:

From the first part (from y''), the x^r term is [r(r-1) + (r(r-1) + 2r)] A_0 x^r.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write it more clearly.

The coefficient of x^r is:

From y'': [r(r-1) x^{r-2} * x²] A_0 + [r(r-1) + 2r] x^r A_0.

But wait, y'' is (from the series) r(r-1) x^{r-2} A_0 + 2r x^{r-1} A_0 + (r(r-1) + 2r) x^r A_0 + higher terms.

Then multiplied by x² gives:

r(r-1) x^r A_0 + 2r x^{r+1} A_0 + (r² + r) x^r A_0.

But wait, that's not correct. Because x² y'' would be x² multiplied by each term. So, for each term in y'':

r(r-1) x^{r-2} A_0 → multiplied by x² → x^{r} A_0 r(r-1).

2r x^{r-1} A_0 → multiplied by x² → x^{r+1} A_0 2r.

(r(r-1) + 2r) x^r A_0 → multiplied by x² → x^{r+2} A_0 (r² + r).

Then, subtracting 2y, which is 2 times (x^r A_0 + x^{r+1} A_1 + x^{r+2} A_2 + ...). So the second term is -2x^r A_0, -2x^{r+1} A_1, etc.

So combining all x^r terms:

From y'': [r(r-1) A_0 x^r + (r² + r) A_0 x^r ].

From -2y: [ -2 A_0 x^r ].

So the total x^r coefficient is:

[r(r-1) + (r² + r) - 2] A_0.

Wait no, because the y'' term contributes r(r-1) A_0 x^r and (r² + r) A_0 x^r, and the -2y term contributes -2 A_0 x^r.

So total is [ r(r-1) + (r² + r) - 2 ] A_0 x^r.

Wait, solving for the indicial equation, we set the coefficient of the lowest power (x^r) to zero.

So:

r(r-1) + (r² + r) - 2 = 0.

Simplify this:

r² - r + r² + r -2 = 0 → 2 r² - 2 = 0 → 2(r² - 1) = 0 → r² = 1 → r = 1 or r = -1.

So the roots are r1 = 1 and r2 = -1. Since they are distinct, the general solution is y = C1 x^{1} + C2 x^{-1}.

Wait, but the problem is about the behavior as x approaches zero. The term x^{-1} (1/x) will blow up to infinity as x approaches zero. So to have the solution bounded, we must choose the solution y = C1 x. So we have to discard the x^{-1} term, so C2 must be zero.

So the solution is y = C1 x.

Now, applying the initial conditions.

At x=1, y=1. So plug x=1 into y = C1 x:

1 = C1 * 1 → C1 = 1.

So the solution is y = x.

Wait, but wait, the general solution is y = C1 x + C2 x^{-1}. But since we have to choose C2=0 for boundedness, the solution is y = C1 x.

So y(1)=1 → C1=1.

So the solution is y = x.

But wait, hold on. Let me verify this. Let's plug y = x into the original equation.

Compute y'' = 0, because y is linear.

So x² * 0 - 2 y = -2 y.

But y = x, so -2x = 0? That can't be right. Wait, that would imply -2x = 0, which is only true when x=0, not for all x. So something is wrong here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Frobenius method. Let me double-check.

Wait, the original equation is x² y'' - 2 y = 0. If y = x, then y'' = 0, so substituting gives 0 - 2x = -2x = 0, which is only true when x=0, which isn't the case here. So y=x is not a solution. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

Wait, the equation is x² y'' - 2 y = 0. Let's suppose y = x^r.

Then y'' = r(r-1) x^{r-2}.

Substituting into the equation: x² * r(r-1) x^{r-2} - 2 x^r = [r(r-1) x^r] - 2 x^r = (r² - r - 2) x^r = 0.

So r² - r - 2 = 0 → (r-2)(r+1) = 0 → r=2 or r=-1.

So the general solution is y = C1 x^2 + C2 x^{-1}.

Ah, I see. I must have made a mistake in the earlier calculation. The correct indicial equation is r² - r - 2 = 0 → r=2 and r=-1.

So the two solutions are y1 = x^2 and y2 = x^{-1}.

So the general solution is y = C1 x^2 + C2 x^{-1}.

Now, applying the initial condition y(1) = 1:

At x=1, y=1 = C1 (1)^2 + C2 (1)^{-1} → C1 + C2 =1.

Also, we have y' = 2 C1 x + (-1) C2 x^{-2}.

At x=1, y'=gamma:

y' = 2 C1 (1) + (-1) C2 (1)^{-2} = 2 C1 - C2 = gamma.

So, we have two equations:

1) C1 + C2 =1
2) 2 C1 - C2 = gamma

We can add equations 1 and 2 to eliminate C2.

Adding:

( C1 + C2 ) + (2 C1 - C2 ) = 1 + gamma → 3 C1 = 1 + gamma → C1 = (1 + gamma)/3.

Then from equation 1, C2 = 1 - C1 = 1 - (1 + gamma)/3 = (3 -1 - gamma)/3 = (2 - gamma)/3.

But we also have to consider the boundedness as x approaches zero. The solution is y = C1 x^2 + C2 x^{-1}.

As x approaches zero, x^{-1} term goes to infinity unless C2 is zero. So to have the solution bounded, C2 must be zero.

So, C2 = (2 - gamma)/3 = 0 → 2 - gamma =0 → gamma =2.

So gamma must be 2. Looking at the options, option C is 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the solution in Frobenius method had C2 x^{-1}, but that led to a problem when plugging in. So perhaps I should have done the Frobenius method correctly.

Wait, no, in the correct Frobenius method, the general solution is y = C1 x^2 + C2 x^{-1}. The x^{-1} term is only present when the roots are r=2 and r=-1. So to make the solution bounded as x approaches zero, the coefficient C2 must be zero.

So C2 =0 → (2 - gamma)/3 =0 → gamma=2.

So the answer is 2, which is option C.

To solve the differential equation \( x^2 y'' - 2y = 0 \) with initial conditions \( y(1) = 1 \) and \( y'(1) = \gamma \), we use the Frobenius method. The equation is regular singular at \( x = 0 \), so we seek a solution of the form \( y = x^r \).

### Step 1: indicial equation
Substituting \( y = x^r \) into the equation:
\[
x^2 \cdot r(r-1)x^{r-2} - 2x^r = 0 \implies [r(r-1) - 2]x^r = 0.
\]
The indicial equation is:
\[
r^2 - r - 2 = 0 \implies (r-2)(r+1) = 0 \implies r = 2, -1.
\]

### Step 2: General solution
The general solution is:
\[
y = C_1 x^2 + C_2 x^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Applying initial conditions
At \( x = 1 \):
\[
y(1) = C_1 (1)^2 + C_2 (1)^{-1} = C_1 + C_2 = 1.
\]
At \( x = 1 \), the derivative is:
\[
y' = 2C_1 x + (-1)C_2 x^{-2} \implies y'(1) = 2C_1 - C_2 = \gamma.
\]

### Step 4: Boundedness condition
For \( y \) to be bounded as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( C_2 x^{-1} \) must vanish. Thus, \( C_2 = 0 \).

Substituting \( C_2 = 0 \) into the equations:
1. \( C_1 + 0 = 1 \implies C_1 = 1 \),
2. \( 2C_1 - 0 = \gamma \implies \gamma = 2 \).

Thus, \( \gamma = 2 \).
