Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out which formula correctly symbolizes the sentence "Dylan likes neither math nor science." Hmm. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, I remember that in logic, when someone says "A and B," it's represented by "A ∧ B," and "A or B" is "A ∨ B." Also, the negation of "A and B" is "¬A ∨ ¬B" and the negation of "A or B" is "¬A ∧ ¬B." 

The sentence is "Dylan likes neither math nor science." So, that means he doesn't like math and he doesn't like science. So, two separate negations. 

Let me assign some variables. Let M be "Dylan likes math" and S be "Dylan likes science." So, the sentence is saying both M is false and S is false. In logical terms, that's "¬M ∧ ¬S." 

Now, let's look at the options. 

Option A: M ∨ ~S. This means either he likes math or he doesn't like science. That doesn't make sense because the sentence is about disliked subjects, not liked ones. So A is probably not correct.

Option B: ~M ∨ S. This is either he doesn't like math or he likes science. Again, that's not matching the original statement. The original says he likes neither, so this seems off.

Option C: ~M ∧ ~S. This is the conjunction of both M and S being false. That directly matches what the sentence is saying. So C seems correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option D: M ∨ S. This is either he likes math or science. Doesn't fit because the sentence is about disliked subjects.

Option E: M ∧ S. Both true. Again, that's liking both, not liking either. So no.

Option F: ~(~M ∨ S). Let's parse this. The negation of "either he doesn't like math or likes science." Wait, that's a bit tricky. If I negate "either he doesn't like math or likes science," it's saying that it's not the case that he either doesn't like math or likes science. Which would mean he likes neither. So this is the same as the original. Hmm, so both C and F seem correct. Wait, but can that be? Let's think.

Wait, let's evaluate both. Option C is ~M ∧ ~S. Option F is ~(~M ∨ S). Let me simplify F. Using De Morgan's Law, ~(A ∨ B) is equivalent to ~A ∧ ~B. So ~M ∨ S is equivalent to ~M ∨ S. Negating that gives ~ (~M ∨ S) which is M ∧ ~S. Wait, no—that's not right. Wait, no: ~(~M ∨ S) is the same as M ∧ ~S, because De Morgan says that the negation of (A or B) is (not A) and (not B). So, ~(~M ∨ S) is equivalent to M ∧ ~S. So F is actually M ∧ ~S, which is different from C. So which one is correct?

Wait, wait. The original sentence is "Dylan likes neither math nor science." That means both M and S are false. So the formula should represent both being false, which is ~M ∧ ~S. So option C is correct. But what about option F?

Wait, let me re-express F. F is ~(~M ∨ S). Let's see: ~(~M ∨ S) is equivalent to ~ ~M ∧ ~S, which is M ∧ ~S. Which is "Dylan likes math but not science." That's not the same as the original sentence, which says he likes neither. So F is not correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that F might be equivalent to C. No, that's not right. So the correct formula must be C.

Wait, but another thought: option F is ~(~M ∨ S), which is M ∧ ~S. So option C is ~M ∧ ~S, which is different. So the correct answer is option C, because the original sentence is about liking neither, which is both being false.

The correct symbolization is option C: ~M ∧ ~S, as it accurately represents that Dylan does not like math (~M) and does not like science (~S).

Answer: C
