Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see. The question is about a car starting from rest and reaching a speed of 30 miles per hour in 8 seconds, and we're supposed to find its acceleration. Oh wait, the options are all in feet per second per second, which is the unit for acceleration, right?

Hmm, right. I remember that acceleration is the change in velocity over time. Oh yeah, the formula is a = (v_f - v_i) / t. Since the car starts from rest, the initial velocity v_i is zero. So the acceleration should just be the final velocity divided by the time taken.

But wait, the units here are a bit tricky. The speed is given in miles per hour, but the acceleration options are in feet per second per second. So I need to convert 30 mph to feet per second. 

Let me think. Okay, 1 mile is 5280 feet, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So 30 mph is 30 miles per hour. To convert that to feet per second, I can use the conversion factors.

30 miles/hour = 30 * (5280 feet) / (3600 seconds). Let me compute that. 5280 divided by 3600 is... let's see, 5280 ÷ 3600. Well, 3600 goes into 5280 once with a remainder. 3600 times 1 is 3600, subtract that from 5280, we get 1680. So 1680/3600 is 0.4667. So 30 * 1.4667 is about 44 feet per second? Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 30 * (5280)/3600 = (30 * 5280)/3600. Simplify that: 30/3600 is 1/120. So 5280 * (1/120) is (5280 / 120). 5280 divided by 120. Let me do 5280 ÷ 120. 5280 ÷ 12 is 440, then ÷10 is 44. So 44 ft/s. 

So the final velocity is 44 ft/s, time is 8 seconds. So acceleration a = 44 ft/s divided by 8 s. 44/8 is 5.5 ft/s². So the acceleration is 5.5 ft/s².

Looking at the options, option C is 5.5. So the correct answer should be C.

To determine the acceleration of the car, we use the formula for acceleration:

\( a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \)

Since the car starts from rest, the initial velocity \( v_i \) is 0. The final velocity \( v_f \) is given as 30 miles per hour, which needs to be converted to feet per second. Using the conversion factors:

\[
1 \, \text{mile} = 5280 \, \text{feet}, \quad 1 \, \text{hour} = 3600 \, \text{seconds}
\]

\[
v_f = 30 \, \text{mph} = 30 \times \frac{5280 \, \text{ft}}{3600 \, \text{s}} = 44 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

Now, calculate the acceleration:

\[
a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t} = \frac{44 \, \text{ft/s} - 0}{8 \, \text{s}} = 5.5 \, \text{ft/s}^2
\]

The correct answer is **C: 5.5 ft per sec per sec**.

Answer: C
