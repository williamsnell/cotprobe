Okay, so I've got this question here about the recommended sugar intake. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that a 12-ounce soft drink has 41 grams of sugar, and that's 14% of the normal daily allowance. I need to find out what the normal daily sugar intake is. The options are A to J, with numbers varying from 5.74 up to 293, I think.

First, I should understand what "normal daily allowance" means in this context. From what I remember, the daily recommended intake for sugar (or other nutrients) is a standard amount that people are generally recommended to consume. For most adults, the RDA is around 2,000 to 3,000 mg of sugar a day, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact number. Wait, but in the question, it's given as 14%, so I need to calculate what the total would be based on that percentage.

So, the 12-ounce drink has 41 grams of sugar, which is 14% of the normal daily allowance. Let me write that down:

14% of daily allowance = 41 grams. 

I need to find the daily allowance. So, I can set up the equation as:

14% × Daily Allowance = 41 grams.

To find the Daily Allowance, I'll divide both sides by 14% (or 0.14 in decimal form).

Daily Allowance = 41 grams / 0.14.

Let me calculate that. Hmm, 41 divided by 0.14. Let's see, 0.14 times 300 is 42, right? Because 0.14 * 300 = 42, so 0.14 * 300 = 42. But 41 is one gram less than 42. So if 0.14 * 300 = 42, then 41 would be 300 - (1/0.14) * 1. Wait, that's not making sense. Maybe I should just do the division more accurately.

Let me calculate 41 ÷ 0.14. 

41 divided by 0.14 is the same as 41 multiplied by (1/0.14). 1 divided by 0.14 is approximately 7.142857. So 41 * 7.142857.

Let me compute that. 40 * 7.142857 is 285.71428, and 1 * 7.142857 is 7.142857. Adding those together gives 285.71428 + 7.142857 ≈ 292.857 grams. Wait, but that's in grams, right? Oh wait, because the 41 grams is already in grams, so the calculation is correct. 

So approximately 292.86 grams. Looking at the options, option J is 293. That's pretty close. So the correct answer should be J, 293 grams. 

Wait, but let me double-check the math. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 41 divided by 0.14 again.

Another approach: 0.14 × 300 = 42. So 300 × 0.14 = 42. So if 0.14 × X = 41, then X is 300 - (1/0.14), but wait, that's not right. Alternatively, since 0.14 × 300 =42, so 41 is 1 gram less than 42. So each gram we reduce by 0.14 grams, the divisor increases by 1/0.14. So 41 is 42-1, so X = 300 - (1/0.14) * (1/0.14). Wait, that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can do it step by step.

Wait, 0.14 × 300 =42.

So 42 -1 =41.

So 0.14 × (300 - (1/0.14)) )=41.

Wait, that's not right. Alternatively, 41 is 42 minus 1, so 0.14*(300) - 0.14*(X) =41.

Wait, maybe this is getting too confusing. Let me just do the division.

41 ÷ 0.14 = ?

Well, 0.14 goes into 41 how many times?

Compute 41 / 0.14:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals: 4100 / 14.

What's 14 × 292= 4100? Let me check: 14 × 200=2800, 14 ×92=1288. 2800+1288=4088. Wait, that's 292 ×14 =4088, which is 12 less than 4100. So 292 ×14 =4088.

So 4100-4088=12. So 12/14 = 6/7 ≈0.857.

So 292 + 6/7 ≈292.857.

So that's approximately 292.86 grams. So the correct answer is approximately 293 grams, which is option J.

The question asks for the normal daily sugar intake based on a 12-ounce drink containing 41 grams of sugar, which is 14% of the daily allowance. To find the total daily allowance, divide 41 grams by 0.14 (14% as a decimal):

\[
\text{Daily Allowance} = \frac{41}{0.14} \approx 292.86 \text{ grams}.
\]

This value is closest to option J, which is 293 grams. 

Answer: J
