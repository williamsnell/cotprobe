Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about GARCH models and their standardized residuals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through each part.

The question is asking which statements about standardized residuals from a GARCH model are true. The options are i to iv, and the answer options are A to J, each combining some of these statements.

First, I need to remember what a GARCH model is. GARCH stands for Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity. It's used to model volatility in financial time series data. The standardized residuals in a GARCH model are the residuals divided by their respective conditional standard deviations. I remember that in GARCH models, the residuals are supposed to be uncorrelated with their own squared values, which is a key assumption for the model to work correctly.

Looking at the statements:

i) They are assumed to be normally distributed.

Wait, that's not right. I thought that the residuals in GARCH models are not normally distributed. They are usually assumed to have a certain distribution, which I think is a normal distribution or perhaps t-distributed. Or wait, wait—no. The residuals in GARCH models are typically assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), but their distribution isn't necessarily normal. Actually, the distribution is often something else, like normal, but in some cases, people might use a t-distribution to account for fat tails. But the key point is that they aren't assumed to be normally distributed. So statement i is false.

ii) Their squares will be related to their lagged squared values if the GARCH model is appropriate.

This seems correct. In a well-specified GARCH model, the squared residuals (like the squared residuals from the mean equation and the variance equation) should be related to their lagged counterparts. For example, in the GARCH equation, the variance at time t includes a term with the squared residuals from the previous period. So if you square the standardized residuals and look at their relationship with their lagged squared values, you'd expect some correlation. So statement ii is probably true.

iii) In practice, they are likely to have fat tails.

Yes, that makes sense. GARCH models often account for the fact that financial returns are more prone to extreme values—so their residuals have fatter tails than a normal distribution. This is an important feature because it means the standard errors are underestimated if we assume normality, which can lead to incorrect inference. So statement iii is true.

iv) If the GARCH model is adequate, the standardised residuals and the raw residuals will be identical.

Wait, what's the difference between raw and standardized residuals? Raw residuals are the actual residuals, like e_t. Standardized residuals are e_t divided by the conditional standard deviation. So if the conditional standard deviation is 1, then standardized and raw residuals are the same. But if not, they differ. So if the model is adequate, that would mean that the residuals are correctly scaled and the variance structure is captured. But the residuals themselves (raw) would still be e_t, while standardized residuals are e_t / sigma_t. So they are not identical unless sigma_t=1. So statement iv is false. Because even with an adequate model, the standardized residuals are different from the raw residuals unless the variance is 1. So iv is incorrect.

Now, let's look at the statements:

i) False

ii) True

iii) True

iv) False

So the statements that are true are ii and iii.

Now, looking at the options, the options are:

A: i, ii, iii
B: i, ii, iii, iv
C: iii and iv
D: i and iv
E: i and iii
F: i, iii, iv
G: ii and iv
H: i and ii
I: ii and iii
J: ii, iii, iv.

Wait, the correct ones are ii and iii. So the only option that includes ii and iii is option F: ii, iii, iv? No, F says ii, iii, iv. Wait, no. Option F is (i), (iii), (iv) only. So that includes iii and iv, which we thought were both true. Wait, no.

Wait, our analysis is: ii and iii are true; i and iv are false. So the correct statements are ii and iii. So the option that includes ii and iii is F: ii, iii, iv? No, looking again, options:

Looking at the options:

H: (i) and (ii) only

I: (ii) and (iii) only

F: (i), (iii), (iv) only.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me list the options again.

Option A: i, ii, iii
Option B: i, ii, iii, iv
Option C: iii and iv
Option D: i and iv
Option E: i and iii
Option F: (i), (iii), (iv) only
Option G: (ii) and (iv) only
Option H: (i) and (ii) only
Option I: (ii) and (iii) only
Option J: (ii), (iii), (iv) only.

So, the correct statements are ii and iii. So looking for which option includes ii and iii.

Looking at the options, option F is (i), (iii), (iv) only. So it includes iii and iv, but not ii. So that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's recheck the statements.

The correct statements are ii and iii. So which options include those?

Looking again:

Option I is (ii) and (iii) only. So option I includes ii and iii.

So the correct answer should be option I.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-examine statement ii. The statement says, "Their squares will be related to their lagged squared values if the GARCH model is appropriate." So that is correct. In a GARCH model, the squared residuals are likely to be correlated with their lagged squared values.

Statement iii is correct as fat tails are a feature of GARCH models.

So the correct options are ii and iii, which is option I.

Wait, but looking at the available options. Option I says (ii) and (iii) only. So the answer should be option I. But the options don't have an option I as one, wait, looking at the options:

Wait, the options are:

A: (i), (ii), (iii) only

B: (i), (ii), (iii), (iv)

C: (iii) and (iv) only

D: (i) and (iv) only

E: (i) and (iii) only

F: (i), (iii), (iv) only

G: (ii) and (iv) only

H: (i) and (ii) only

I: (ii) and (iii) only

J: (ii), (iii), (iv) only.

So option I is (ii) and (iii) only. So option I is correct.

Wait, but I thought the correct answer was option I. So the correct answer should be I, which is option I. But in some cases, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, but let's double-check each statement:

i) They are assumed to be normally distributed.

No, incorrect. They are not assumed to be normal.

ii) Their squares are related to lagged squared values.

Yes, correct.

iii) They have fat tails.

Yes.

iv) If model is adequate, std residuals same as raw.

No, because std residuals are raw divided by sigma. So unless sigma is 1, they are different.

So statements ii and iii are correct.

So among the options, the correct one is I: (ii) and (iii) only.

Looking back at the options, option I is option I: (ii) and (iii) only.

So the correct answer is option I, which is (ii) and (iii) only.

The question asks which statements about standardized residuals from a GARCH model are true. Let’s analyze each statement:

1. **i) They are assumed to be normally distributed.**  
   This is false. GARCH models do not assume normality of residuals; they are typically assumed to have fat tails or follow a different distribution.

2. **ii) Their squares will be related to their lagged squared values if the GARCH model is appropriate.**  
   This is true. In a well-specified GARCH model, the squared residuals are correlated with their lagged counterparts, a key feature of the model.

3. **iii) In practice, they are likely to have fat tails.**  
   This is true. Financial returns often exhibit fat tails, meaning standardized residuals have higher kurtosis than a normal distribution.

4. **iv) If the GARCH model is adequate, the standardised residuals and the raw residuals will be identical.**  
   This is false. Standardized residuals are raw residuals divided by their conditional standard deviations. Unless the standard deviation is 1, they differ from raw residuals.

**Correct statements**: ii and iii. These correspond to option I, which states that (ii) and (iii) are true.

**Correct Answer**: I
