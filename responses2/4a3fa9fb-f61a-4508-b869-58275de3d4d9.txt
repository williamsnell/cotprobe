Okay, so I've got this question here about signal processing. Let me see what it's asking. The problem says: we have a function x(t) which is equal to 10 cos(20πt - π/4) minus 5 cos(50πt). And we're supposed to find the minimum sampling rate in Hz such that y(t) equals x(t). The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when you sample a signal, you have to make sure the sampling rate is at least twice the highest frequency component in the signal. This is the Nyquist theorem, right? So the minimum sampling rate is twice the maximum frequency.

Looking at x(t), it's a sum of two cosine functions. Each cosine function has a different frequency. The first term is 10 cos(20πt - π/4), and the second is 5 cos(50πt). Oh, wait, the arguments of the cosines are in radians, right? So the frequencies are the coefficients divided by 2π.

Right, frequency f is given by (angular frequency ω) divided by 2π. So for the first term, ω is 20π. So f1 = 20π/(2π) = 10 Hz. The second term has ω =50π, so f2=50π/(2π)=25 Hz.

So the two frequencies are 10 Hz and 25 Hz. The maximum frequency is 25 Hz. According to Nyquist, the minimum sampling rate is twice that, so 50 Hz. That would be option H.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum sampling rate such that y(t) equals x(t). Oh, wait, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because sometimes when dealing with multiple frequency components, you might have to consider the sum of their frequencies, but in this case, it's not like you're adding two signals with the same frequency. So I think the Nyquist rate is straightforward here.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the time domain. The first term completes a cycle every T1 = 1/10 seconds, so a period of 0.1 seconds. The second term has T2 = 1/25 seconds, or 0.04 seconds. So the signal is a combination of these two periodic functions.

But for sampling, the Nyquist rate is determined by the maximum frequency in the signal. So the highest is 25 Hz, so 50 Hz is the sampling rate needed.

Wait, but what if there's a problem with the way the signals are represented? Like, are there any harmonics or something else that I'm missing? Like if the signal is a sum of multiple frequencies, the sampling rate just needs to be at least twice the highest one.

I think that's right. So the answer should be 50 Hz, which is option H.

To determine the minimum sampling rate such that \( y(t) = x(t) \), we apply the Nyquist theorem, which states that the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency component in the signal. The given signal \( x(t) \) is a sum of two cosine functions:

1. \( 10 \cos(20\pi t - \pi/4) \): The angular frequency here is \( 20\pi \), so the frequency is \( f_1 = 20\pi / (2\pi) = 10 \, \text{Hz} \).
2. \( 5 \cos(50\pi t) \): The angular frequency here is \( 50\pi \), so the frequency is \( f_2 = 50\pi / (2\pi) = 25 \, \text{Hz} \).

The maximum frequency in the signal is \( f_2 = 25 \, \text{Hz} \). According to the Nyquist theorem, the minimum sampling rate is twice this maximum frequency:

\[
f_{\text{min}} = 2 \times f_{\text{max}} = 2 \times 25 \, \text{Hz} = 50 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

Thus, the minimum sampling rate required is \( 50 \, \text{Hz} \), which corresponds to option **H**.

Answer: H
