Okay, so I've got this question here about energy intake and digestion. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact concepts, but I'll try to break it down.

The question says that a healthy woman has a daily gross energy intake of 9279 kJ. Her faeces and urine have energy contents of 647 kJ and 318 kJ respectively. I remember that digestible energy intake (DEI) is what she actually consumes that gets broken down by the digestive system. Also, the metabolisable energy intake (MEI) is what's actually used for activity, like burning fat or burning calories to keep active.

Wait, the question is asking for the average daily digestible and metabolizable energy intake. So I think the gross intake is the total she eats, which is 9279 kJ. The DEI is the intake minus the energy in her faeces and urine because those are what she doesn't need to use. So DEI would be 9279 minus the sum of faeces and urine.

Wait, no. Because she might have some waste that's excreted, but I think the faeces and urine are the main waste products. So DEI would be 9279 - (647 + 318). Let me do the math: 647 plus 318 is 965, so 9279 minus 965 is 8314 kJ. That's the DEI.

What about metabolizable energy intake? I think MEI is the energy intake that's actually used for activity, like burned into fat or muscle. Oh, wait, I remember that MEI is generally about 85% of the energy intake, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's the energy used for maintenance, like burning fat. So maybe MEI is the intake minus the waste. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps MEI is the energy intake minus the waste. Or is it the energy consumed that's actually used for activity?

Wait, another approach: I think the formula for MEI is the energy intake (GI), minus the energy lost (waste). So MEI would be 9279 minus (647 + 318) = 8314 kJ as well. But wait, that would mean both DEI and MEI are the same, which doesn't make sense because I thought MEI is higher than DEI. Or am I mixing it up?

Wait, no, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me clarify. The total energy intake is the sum of what she eats (GI) and what she absorbs and uses (probably not, because GI is what she eats, but MEI is the energy used for activity, which is the same as the energy she uses, so maybe it's the same as the energy that's actually used, which is the same as the DEI? Or is there a difference.)

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. The energy that's actually used for activity (MEI) is about what she uses, like burning fat. The energy that's not used (like stored) is in her waste, which is the faeces and urine.

So, the question is about calculating DEI and MEI. The formula I'm thinking is:

DEI = GI - (FAECes + UREs) = 9279 - (647 + 318) = 9279 - 965 = 8314 kJ.

MEI would be the energy intake that is actually used for activity or maintenance. I'm a bit confused about this part. I thought that MEI is about 90-95% of the energy intake, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps MEI is the same as the energy used to perform activities, which is the same as the energy that's not in the waste.

Wait, another thought: the energy that is actually excreted (FAECes and UREs) is not used for activity, so the energy used for activity would be the GI minus those. Wait, but that would make MEI equal to DEI, which doesn't make sense. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps in the context of this question, MEI is the energy intake minus the waste. So MEI = GI - (FAECes + UREs) = 9279 - 965 = 8314. So both DEI and MEI would be 8314. But that can't be right because a healthy woman would have a higher MEI than DEI. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the way to look at it is that DEI is the energy intake minus the waste, which would be the same as MEI. That can't be right because MEI is supposed to be higher.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula differently. The energy that's actually used for activity (MEI) is about what she uses, like burning fat. The energy that's not used (waste) is in her faeces and urine. So the energy intake is GI. The energy that's actually used is the same as the energy intake minus the waste. So MEI = GI - (FAECes + UREs) = 8314 kJ.

Wait, but that would mean both DEI and MEI are the same, which doesn't make sense. I must be making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that MEI is the energy intake minus the waste, but I thought the waste is not 'used' but stored. So perhaps in this context, MEI is the same as DEI. That doesn't make sense because MEI should be higher. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, another angle. The energy that's not needed for active processes is in the waste. So the energy that is needed is the GI minus the waste. So for both DEI and MEI, the same value.

But the question is about the two. So the DEI is 9279 - (647+318) = 9279 - 965 = 8314.

As for MEI, the formula is perhaps the same as DEI, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps MEI is the same as the energy that is used for activity, which is the same as the energy intake minus the waste. So MEI would be 8314 kJ as well. But that would mean both DEI and MEI are the same, which seems incorrect because I thought MEI is higher.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again. The energy intake is 9279. The energy in faeces and urine is 965. So the energy that's not in the waste is 9279 - 965 = 8314. This is the energy that's used for activity (MEI) and possibly maintenance.

So, DEI and MEI would both be 8314 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any option that shows both as 8314. Let me check the options.

Option B: 9279-318 and 9279-318. So both are 9279-318 = 8961, which is more than what I calculated. Wait, no, 9279-318 is 8961. I thought DEI was 8314. So that's not the same. So perhaps option B can't be correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating. Let me recalculate. 647 +318 = 965. 9279 - 965 = 8314. So DEI and MEI would both be 8314.

Looking back at the options, none of them seem to have both as 8314. Hmm, so perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the formula DEI = GI - (FAEC + URE), and MEI is the same as that, but that would be same, which is not correct. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definitions. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is DEI = GI - (FAEC + URE), and MEI is perhaps the same as the energy used, which is the same as the energy that's not in the waste, which would be the same as DEI.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps MEI is the energy intake minus the waste, which would be same as DEI.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

Option A: 9279-318 and 9279-647.

Option B: both 9279 -318.

Option C: DEI is 9279 - 318 + 647, which would be 9279 - 965 = 8314, and MEI is 9279-647 = 8632. So the options for DEI would be 8314, and for MEI, 8632.

Wait, but according to the question, we're to find the correct DEI and MEI.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct formula is DEI = GI - (FAEC + URE), and MEI is the same as that. Or perhaps MEI is the same as the sum of the waste and the energy used for activity. No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the two. Let me think again. The energy intake is the total food consumed. The waste is the excreted material. So the energy used for activity (MEI) would be the energy intake minus the waste. So MEI = GI - (FAEC + URE) = 9279 - 965 = 8314.

So DEI is 8314, and MEI is 8314. But looking at the options:

Looking for which option has DEI as 8314 and MEI as 8314. But none of the options have both as 8314. Let me check the options again.

The options are as follows:

A: 9279-318 and 9279-647 → DEI = 8961; MEI = 8632.

B: 9279-318 and same → DEI and MEI both are 8961.

C: DEI is 9279-965 = 8314, and MEI is 9279-647 = 8632.

D: DEI as 9279 + 647 → 9926; MEI as 9279-318=8961.

E: DEI as 9279+318 → 9597; MEI as 9279-647=8632.

F: DEI as 647, MEI as 647+318=965.

G: DEI as 647, MEI as 647+318=965.

H: DEI as 9279+647=9926; MEI as 9279+318=9597.

I: DEI as 9279; MEI as 9279-647=8632.

J: DEI as 647, MEI as 647+318=965.

Looking at the options, which one matches DEI as 8314 and MEI as 8314? None of the options have both as 8314. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the waste is not 647+318. Maybe I should think that the waste is just the faeces and the urine, so 647 kJ. So the energy that is used for activity is 9279 - 647 = 8632 kJ.

Wait, but that would mean MEI is 8632, and DEI is 9279 - 647 = 8632. So both are 8632. Hmm, looking for an option where both are 8632.

Looking at the options, option B says both are 9279-318, which is 8961. Not matching. Option C says DEI is 8314, MEI is 8632.

So option C: DEI = 8314, MEI=8632. But I thought MEI is 8632 and DEI is 8314. So that would be option C.

Wait, but wait. If MEI is 8632, that's higher than DEI, which doesn't make sense because MEI should be higher than DEI. Or is it?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. MEI is the energy used for activity, which could be less than the energy that's not in the waste. Hmm, no, that can't be. Because if waste is 647, then the energy not in waste is 9279-647=8632. So that's the energy used for activity. So MEI would be 8632. And the DEI would be that minus the waste? No, because DEI is 9279-647=8632. So DEI equals MEI in this case. But that can't be right because the user's question says both options are in the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definitions.

Wait, perhaps I should check the definitions again. 

DEI (Energy Intake Decomposed) is the energy that is not in the waste products (faeces and urine) and is used for active processes. So DEI = GI - (FAEC + URE) = 9279 - 965 = 8314.

MEI (Metabolic Energy Intake) is the energy that is used for activity, which is the same as the energy used in metabolism. So MEI = GI - (FAEC + URE) = DEI.

So MEI would be 8314.

But looking at the options, I don't see any option that has both as 8314. So perhaps the correct option is C: DEI is 9279 - (647+318) = 8314, and MEI is 9279 - 647 = 8632. But wait, that would mean MEI is higher than DEI. But that's not correct because MEI should be higher than DEI.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe MEI is the same as the energy that's used for activity, which is less than the energy that's not in the waste. So in this case, MEI would be 8314, and DEI is also 8314. But that can't be because I thought MEI is generally higher.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I'm confusing MEI with something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that MEI is the energy that's used for activity, which is the same as the energy in the body that's not in the waste. So in this case, MEI would be 8632, and DEI is 8632 as well, because both are equal.

Wait, but that would mean both are the same, which isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to subtract the waste from the GI, so DEI is 8632, and MEI is 8632. But that can't be right because MEI should be higher than DEI.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the definitions. Let me think: 

Energy that is used for activity (MEI) is the energy that the body uses to perform physical activity, like burning fat or muscle. So that would be the same as the energy that is not in the waste. So MEI = GI - (FAEC + URE) = 9279 - 965 = 8314.

So DEI is the same as MEI because both are 8314. But that can't be right because the user's question seems to imply that DEI and MEI are different.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake. DEI is the energy that is actually used for decomposition (so not in the waste). MEI is the energy that is used for activity (so in the body, not just decomposition).

So perhaps the correct way is:

DEI = GI - (FAEC + URE) = 9279 - (647+318) = 8314.

MEI = GI - (FAEC + URE) = same as DEI. So both are 8314. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C: DEI is 9279 - (647+318) = 8314, and MEI is 9279 - 647 = 8632. Which would mean MEI is 8632 and DEI is 8314. But that can't be correct because MEI should be higher than DEI.

Wait, maybe the MEI is just the energy that's not in the waste, which is the same as DEI. So both are 8314. But that's not possible because MEI should be higher.

I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should look for the correct option. The options are:

Option C: DEI is 8314, MEI is 8632.

But according to the definitions, MEI should be the same as the energy not in the waste, which is 8632. So if that's the case, the correct option would be C, because DEI is 8314 and MEI is 8632.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. MEI is the energy used for activity, which is the same as the energy available (GI) minus (FAEC + URE). So MEI = 9279 - 965 = 8314. DEI is the energy used for decomposition, which is same as MEI. So both are 8314. But that's not possible because MEI is supposed to be higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. The user is asking for the average daily DEI and MEI. So, according to the options, option C says DEI is 8314 and MEI is 8632. That would be correct according to the definitions, but perhaps in reality, MEI is higher than DEI.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the correct way to compute DEI and MEI. So perhaps the correct way is:

DEI = GI - (FAEC + URE) = 9279 - 965 = 8314.

MEI = GI - (FAEC + URE) = same as DEI = 8314.

But that can't be right because the user's question states that on average, the energy is 9279, and the correct options are given.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake and the correct answer is option C. Because according to the question, the correct answer would be both DEI and MEI equal to 8314. But that doesn't make sense because MEI should be higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the definitions wrong. Let me think again.

MEI is the energy used for maintenance, which is the same as the energy not in the waste. So MEI = GI - (FAEC + URE) = 9279 - 965 = 8314.

DEI is the energy that is used for decomposition, which is the same as the energy not in the waste. So DEI = GI - (FAEC + URE) = 8314.

But that would mean MEI and DEI are the same, which is not correct. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because DEI is 8314 and MEI is 8632.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think of it this way: the energy that is not in the waste is 965. So, the energy that is used for activity (MEI) is 8632, and the energy that is used for decomposition (DEI) is 8314.

So, the correct option would be C: DEI is 8314 and MEI is 8632.

But wait, according to the options, option C says DEI is 9279- (647+318)=8314, and MEI is 9279-647=8632.

So that would be DEI=8314 and MEI=8632, which would make sense because MEI is higher than DEI.

So the correct answer is option C.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the definitions of DEI (Energy Intake Decomposed) and MEI (Metabolic Energy Intake). 

1. **DEI**: This is the energy that is not in the waste products (faeces and urine) and is used for active processes. It is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{DEI} = \text{GI} - (\text{FAEC} + \text{URE}) = 9279 - (647 + 318) = 9279 - 965 = 8314 \, \text{kJ}.
   \]

2. **MEI**: This is the energy used for activity (e.g., burning fat) and is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{MEI} = \text{GI} - (\text{FAEC} + \text{URE}) = 9279 - 965 = 8314 \, \text{kJ}.
   \]

However, this result suggests that MEI equals DEI, which contradicts the typical understanding that MEI should be higher than DEI. Upon reevaluating the definitions, we realize that MEI is actually the energy used for activity, which is the same as the energy not in the waste (MEI = GI - (FAEC + URE)). This aligns with the correct definitions, where both MEI and DEI refer to the same value, 8314 kJ.

But based on the options provided, the correct choice is **C**, which states that DEI is 8314 kJ and MEI is 8632 kJ. This discrepancy arises from a potential misunderstanding of the definitions, but the option aligns with the calculations if MEI is interpreted as the energy not in the waste, which is 8632 kJ.

ANSWER: C
