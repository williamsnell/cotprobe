Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A person can stand outside on a cold day for hours without ill effect, but falling into a cold lake can kill a person in a matter of minutes. Which of the following is the primary reason for this phenomenon?

Options:

A: Water has more molecules per volume than air, increasing molecular contact with the person.
B: Thermal energy moves from high concentration areas (hot) to low concentration areas (cold).
C: The molecules of the person are, on average, moving faster than those of the surroundings.
D: The person's body is more resistant to cold in air than in water.
E: Water has less heat capacity than air, causing a quicker heat loss.
F: As heat flows out of the person and warms the fluid surrounding the person, the warmer fluid rises, allowing fresh cool fluid to come in contact with the person and increasing the rate of heat transfer.
G: The person is more buoyant in water, causing a faster heat transfer.
H: The person's clothing provides more insulation against cold air than against cold water.
I: Water molecules are polar, increasing heat transfer when in contact with the person.
J: Air is less dense than water, so heat transfer is slower in air.

Okay, so I've got this question about why you can stand outside for hours without problems, but falling into a cold lake kills you quickly. Hmm, I remember something about water and air having different properties. Let me think.

So, the person can stand outside because the body doesn't lose heat as much. Wait, but the lake is cold. Oh, right! Water has a lower heat capacity than air. I think that's the key here. Heat capacity is how much heat something can store. So, air is a poor conductor of heat and has high heat capacity, meaning it can absorb and store more heat. But water is a good conductor and has a much lower heat capacity. So when you're in cold water, the body can't lose heat as quickly. That makes sense why it's cold.

Looking at the options, option E says water has less heat capacity than air, so it loses heat faster. That sounds right. But wait, what about the other options?

Option A: Water has more molecules. I'm not sure if that's the primary reason. Maybe it affects the rate of molecular transfer, but the main point is the heat capacity.

Option B: Thermal energy moves from hot to cold. That's conduction, but the primary reason is the capacity, not the movement direction.

Option C: Person's molecules moving faster. While that's true, it's not the main reason. It's more about the heat transfer, not the speed.

Option D: Body more resistant to cold. No, that's not the main reason. The main thing is the heat capacity, not the body's resistance to cold.

Option F: Warmer fluid rises. That's convection, which does allow heat transfer, but the primary reason is the heat capacity, not about the movement of fluids.

Option G: Buoyant in water. Buoyancy doesn't directly explain why you die quickly; it's more about how you're submerged.

Option H: Polar molecules increase heat transfer. That's true, but again, the main factor is the heat capacity, not the polarity.

Option I: Clothing insulation. That's a factor, but the question is about the environment, not the clothing. The option says water has less heat capacity, which is the right reasoning.

Option J: Air is less dense than water. That's a different factor, but not the primary reason for heat loss. The main reason is the heat capacity, which relates to how much water can hold heat.

So the primary reason is E. Because water has less heat capacity than air, so it loses heat faster when cold. So the correct answer is E.

The primary reason for the phenomenon described is that water has a lower heat capacity than air. This means water can absorb and store more heat compared to air, leading to rapid heat loss when exposed to cold conditions. 

Answer: E
