Question:

A brick mason was hired by a builder under a written one-year contract, at an annual salary of $45,000, with employment to begin on March 1. Because the builder was unable to secure enough building contracts to keep all its employees busy during the season beginning March 1, it notified the brick mason on February 15 that it could not afford to employ him as a mason. At the same time, however, the builder offered to employ the mason, for the same contract period, as a night guard at an annual salary of $25,000. The mason declined the offer and remained unemployed during the year. No offer and remained unemployed during the year. No employment for brick masons was available in the community during the year, but the mason could have obtained other employment as a day laborer that would have paid up to $25,000 a year. At the end of the year, in an action against the builder for breach of contract, how much, if anything, is the mason entitled to recover?

Options:

A: $20,000 (the difference between the mason's contract price and the salary offered for the night guard position).
B: $45,000 (the contract price).
C: Nothing, because the mason turned down a reasonable alternative employment offer.
D: Nothing, because the mason did not mitigate his damages.
E: $20,000 (the $45,000 contract price less the $25,000 the mason could have earned in other employment).
F: $45,000 plus damages for emotional distress.
G: Nothing, because the builder did not act in bad faith when it discharged the mason.
H: $25,000 (the amount he could have earned as a day laborer).
I: $45,000 minus any unemployment benefits the mason received during the year.
J: $25,000 (the amount he could have earned as a night guard).

Okay, so I've got this contract question to tackle. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to contract law, so I'll have to think carefully.

Alright, the scenario is that a brick mason was hired by a builder under a written one-year contract. The annual salary is $45,000, starting March 1. The builder could not secure enough contracts to keep employees busy during March, so it notified the mason on Feb 15 that it couldn't afford to hire him. The builder offered to hire him as a night guard for $25,000 for the same contract period. But the mason declined, remained unemployed, and no other employment options were available. His alternative job as a day laborer could have paid up to $25,000 a year.

Now, the question is about what the mason is entitled to recover in an action against the builder for breach of contract. The options are from A to J, with J being $25,000, etc.

First, I need to recall the elements of a contract. A contract must be made out of whole dollars, clear, and specific. It must also be express and certain. If the contract is unexpressed, it's void. Here, the contract was written, so that's good.

Wait, but the key here is what the builder did. The builder offered the mason a night guard position for $25k, but the mason declined. The builder claims he made the offer because he couldn't hire him. But the mason didn't accept.

In contract law, if one party offers an alternative and the other declines, the alternative is treated as part of the contract. So the mason's employment is considered as part of the contract. That means the builder still breached by not having the mason employed at the agreed salary.

Wait, but what's the standard for breach? If the contract is for a salary, and the mason didn't accept, it's considered a breach. But if the builder offered an alternative job, which the mason could have taken, the mason didn't accept, so that's a breach.

Now, what can the mason recover? He's entitled to the difference between what he was paid and what he could have earned elsewhere. Because he was employed at $45k, but could have had $25k elsewhere.

Wait, the options mention A) $20k (diff between 45k and 25k), J) $25k. But the mason was employed at 45k, but offered 25k elsewhere. So he was paid 45k, but could have had 25k elsewhere. So the mason's loss is 45k - 25k = $20k. So the difference is $20k.

Wait, but also, the mason could have earned up to $25k, so that's the maximum he would have made elsewhere. So the mason's damages would be $20k.

Looking at the options, A is $20k (the difference between mason's contract price and the salary offered for night guard). So that's one option.

But wait, what about if the builder made the offer, but the mason declined? So the mason is at 45k but could have had 25k elsewhere. So the mason's loss is 45k - 25k = 20k. So he can claim that.

Alternatively, could the mason be entitled to the difference? Or is it about the contract terms?

Wait, another angle: The contract is for a salary. So the mason's employment constitutes a contract. The builder entered into a contract for 45k, but the mason declined. So the mason's employment is a breach of contract.

But the builder's alternative offer of 25k elsewhere. The mason didn't accept, so the mason's employment is part of the contract. So the builder breached by not providing the mason at the agreed salary. The mason's loss is the difference between the contract price and the alternative where he could have worked elsewhere.

So the mason's damages would be 45k - 25k = 20k.

Wait, but the options have J as $25k, which is the alternative he could have made. But the question is about the loss, which is the difference.

Looking at the options, option A is $20k, which is the difference. Option J is $25k, but that's what he could have earned elsewhere, not the difference.

So the correct answer should be A: $20k.

The mason was hired under a contract for $45,000 per year, but the builder offered him a night guard position for $25,000. The mason declined, and the builder claims the offer was made because the builder could not hire him. The mason's employment constitutes a breach of contract because he was not provided with the agreed salary. The builder's alternative offer of $25,000 as a day laborer is a reasonable alternative, and the mason could have earned that amount elsewhere.

The mason's loss is the difference between the contract price ($45,000) and the alternative offer ($25,000), which is $20,000. Therefore, the mason is entitled to recover this amount as damages for breach of contract.
