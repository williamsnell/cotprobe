Okay, so I've got this question here about earnings per share (EPS). Let me try to figure it out. The question says that the annual EPS has a mean of $8.6 and a standard deviation of $3.4. We need to find the probability that an observed EPS is less than $5.5. 

Hmm, I remember from my statistics class that when dealing with normally distributed data, I can use the z-score to find probabilities. So, the z-score formula is z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value we're interested in, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. X is $5.5, μ is $8.6, and σ is $3.4. So, z would be (5.5 - 8.6) divided by 3.4. Let's calculate that step by step. 

5.5 minus 8.6 is... let's see, 5 minus 8 is -3, and 0.5 minus 0.6 is -0.1, so together that's -3.1. Then, divide by 3.4. So, -3.1 / 3.4 equals approximately -0.9118. 

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculation. Oh, wait, wait, I think I messed up the subtraction. It's 5.5 minus 8.6. So, 8.6 minus 5.5 is 3.1, but since it's 5.5 - 8.6, it's negative 3.1. So, yes, -3.1 divided by 3.4 is about -0.9118. 

Now, I need to find the probability that a z-score is less than -0.9118. I recall that in the standard normal distribution, this corresponds to the area to the left of z = -0.9118. 

Looking at a z-table or using a calculator, but since I don't have one in front of me, I need to think about the values. Alternatively, I can remember that around z = -1, the probability is about 0.1587 (which is option J). For z = -0.9, the probability is around 0.1841, but wait wait, wait. Let me think again. 

Wait, the z-table gives the area from 0 up to z. So, for z = -0.91, the area is about 0.1814. Oh wait, but I'm getting a z-score of approximately -0.9118. So, looking at the options, option F is 0.1814. That's the area for z = -0.91. But wait, what about the exact value? 

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the exact z-score. Let me compute that again. 

5.5 minus 8.6 is indeed -3.1. Divided by 3.4: 3.4 times 0.9 is 3.06, which is less than 3.1. So, 0.91 times 3.4 is 3.4 * 0.9 = 3.06, 3.4 * 0.01 = 0.034. So together, 3.094. Wait, but I have 3.1 as the numerator. So 3.4 * 0.9118 is 3.1. Wait, that's probably a miscalculation. Let me think differently. 

Wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let's see, 3.4 * 0.91 is 3.094, which is very close to 3.1. So, 0.91 gives 3.094, which is just under 3.1. So, 3.1 - 3.094 is 0.006. So, 0.006 is 0.006/3.4 = 0.00176. So, the z-score is approximately -0.91 + 0.00176 = -0.90824. So, about -0.9082. 

Looking up z = -0.9082 in the standard normal table: I know that at z = -0.91, the area is about 0.1841, and at z = -0.90, it's 0.1831. Wait, but that's a bit confusing because as z increases, the area increases. Wait, no, actually, the area to the left is higher as z approaches zero. Wait, no, wait: for negative z-scores, the area is less than 0.5. So, for example, z = -1 corresponds to about 0.1587, which is option J. 

Wait, but our z is -0.91, which is more than -1. So, the area should be higher than 0.1587. Let me think about the exact value. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator or a z-table. But since I can't, I'll recall that z = -0.91 corresponds to about 0.1841 (from standard tables), and z = -0.90 is 0.1831. So, for z = -0.9082, which is very close to -0.91, the area would be approximately 0.1841. But wait, no, wait. Because z = -0.91 is less than z = -0.9082. Wait, no, wait, no, z increases as you go to the right. So, a higher z means a higher area. So, z = -0.91 is less than z = -0.90, so the area for z = -0.91 is smaller. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, wait, let me clarify. 

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The z-table gives the area from negative infinity up to z. So, for z = -0.91, the area is approximately 0.1840. For z = -0.90, the area is approximately 0.1831. So, if our z is -0.9082 (which is just a hair above -0.91), the area will be slightly higher than 0.1840. Hmm, but wait, no, that doesn't make sense because as z increases (becomes less negative), the area increases. So, a z of -0.9082 is more than -0.91, so the area would be higher than 0.1840. Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier thought. No, wait, no: when z is less negative (closer to zero), the area is higher. So, a z of -0.91 is more negative than -0.90. So, the area for z=-0.91 is lower than for z=-0.90. So, if our z is -0.9082, which is a little higher than -0.91, which is more negative. So the area would be higher than 0.1840. Wait, that's correct. So, it would be just a bit higher than 0.1840. So, the options given are F:0.1814, which is lower than 0.1840. So, perhaps the correct answer is F. But wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value. 

Wait, let me think again. The z-score is -0.9118. So, looking at the standard normal distribution, the area for z = -0.91 is 0.1841. For z = -0.912, which is very close to -0.91, the area would be around 0.1841, but a bit lower, perhaps 0.1840 or 0.1841. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 0.1814, which is option F. So, why would that be? Because maybe I made a miscalculation in the z-score. 

Wait, let's recalculate the z-score. X is 5.5. μ is 8.6, σ is 3.4. So, (5.5 - 8.6) = -3.1. Divided by 3.4: 3.1 divided by 3.4 equals 0.91176... So, the z-score is -0.9118. So, that's correct. 

Looking at the standard normal table, the area for z=-0.91 is about 0.1841. For z=-0.912, it's approximately, perhaps, 0.1840 or 0.1839. So, the closest option is F: 0.1814, but that's lower than 0.1839. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator. Alternatively, maybe the answer is F: 0.1814.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the z-score. The question says 'less than $5.5', which is to the left of the mean. So, in the left tail. The area is less than the mean. So, the z-score is negative. So, I think the correct area is 0.1814, which is option F. But wait, another thought: maybe I should find the probability of z being less than -0.9118. So, looking up in the standard normal table, the exact z is -0.91. So, the area is 0.1841, but how precise is this?

Wait, considering that z = -0.9118 is very close to -0.91. So, the area would be approximately 0.1841 rounded, but perhaps option F is 0.1814. Hmm, wait, maybe I should compute the exact value using the formula. Let me try another approach. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact z-score value. So, the z-score is (5.5 -8.6)/(3.4) = (-3.1)/3.4 = -0.91176470588... So, approximately -0.9118. 

Looking up the standard normal distribution for z = -0.9118, we can get the exact area. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator. But since I don't have one, perhaps it's better to think of it as approximately 0.1814. Hmm, but wait, wait, no, 0.1841 is for z = -0.91, which is lower than our z. So, perhaps the correct answer is F: 0.1814? Or, perhaps I should consider that the z is -0.91, which is option F. But wait, the question is about less than 5.5, which is a bit more negative than -0.91, meaning the area is slightly less than 0.1841. But the options don't have 0.1841. So, perhaps it's option F: 0.1814 because that's the closest. Alternatively, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula correctly. Let me calculate again. 5.5 minus 8.6 is indeed -3.1. Divided by 3.4: it's -0.91176. So, the z-score is approximately -0.9118. Now, looking up the standard normal distribution for z = -0.9118. 

Looking at the standard normal table, the z of -0.91 gives 0.1841. The z of -0.912 would be a bit less, so perhaps around 0.1840. So, considering that, the answer could be F: 0.1814. But wait, that doesn't make sense because 0.1814 is less than 0.1841. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the z calculation, perhaps the standard deviation is 3.4? No, the question says 3.4. Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's not the case. 

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator or a formula for more precise calculation. But without a calculator, I'll proceed with the approximation. 

So, the correct probability is approximately 0.184, which isn't an option. The closest option is F:0.1814. But none of the options match exactly, so perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the correct answer is 0.1814, which is option F.

Wait, but why is the z of -0.9118 leading to such a value? Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the process again.

Wait, another way: perhaps the z-score is correctly calculated, but the area for z=-0.91 is 0.1841, and for z=-0.92 is 0.1788. So, our z is -0.9118, which is between -0.91 and -0.92. So, the area is between 0.1788 and 0.1841. So, 0.1814 is in between. But that's because the area increases as z becomes less negative. So, our area is between 0.1788 and 0.1841.

Wait, but I'm supposed to choose the answer from the options. The options for the answers are:

A: 0.3571

B: 0.0625

C: 0.2345

D: 0.5000

E: 0.4112

F: 0.1814

G: 0.3035

H: 0.0923

I: 0.2756

J: 0.1587

So, 0.1814 is option F.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact z-score and use a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps using the empirical rule, but that's for normal distributions but not exact. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, 0.1814. 

Wait, but wait another thought: when X is less than the mean, the probability is less than 0.5. So, options A, C, E, G, I, J are options less than 0.5, which makes sense. F is 0.1814, which is less than 0.5. So, that's plausible.

Wait, but 0.1814 is approximately 0.1814, so that's a small probability, which makes sense because 5.5 is significantly below the mean of 8.6, given the standard deviation of 3.4. 

Wait, but let me think about another approach: the options. 0.1814 is about 18.14% chance of being below 5.5. That seems correct because 5.5 is more than one standard deviation below the mean (since 8.6 - 3.4 = 5.2, so 5.5 is 0.3 above that), which would mean it's about 0.3/(3.4) = approx 0.09, so 9% below mean. So, the area would be about 9% + some, but perhaps around 18%? Or wait, no: wait, the z-score is -0.9118, which is about 0.3 standard deviations below the mean. Wait, no, 0.3 is in terms of what? Oh, 0.3 standard deviations is 0.3*3.4=1.02. So, 8.6 -1.02=7.58. So, 5.5 is 8.6 -5.5=3.1. So, 3.1 is 3.1/3.4=0.91 standard deviations below. So, that's where the z-score comes from.

So, the area for z=-0.91 is approximately 0.1841, which is option F:0.1814. But wait, that's a bit off, but perhaps the options are rounded. So, the correct answer is F.

To determine the probability that an observed EPS is less than $5.5, we use the z-score formula:

\[
z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

where \( X = 5.5 \), \( \mu = 8.6 \), and \( \sigma = 3.4 \). Plugging in the values:

\[
z = \frac{5.5 - 8.6}{3.4} = \frac{-3.1}{3.4} \approx -0.9118
\]

Next, we find the area under the standard normal curve to the left of \( z = -0.9118 \). Using a standard normal table or calculator, the area (probability) corresponding to \( z = -0.91 \) is approximately \( 0.1841 \). However, this value is not an option provided. The closest option is \( 0.1814 \), which corresponds to \( z = -0.91 \). 

Thus, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: F
