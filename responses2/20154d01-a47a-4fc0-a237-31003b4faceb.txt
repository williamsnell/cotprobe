Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about linear regression and regularization. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that a model is overfitting, and the person is adding ℓ₂ regularization. They want to know how bias and variance change as the regularization coefficient increases.

First, I remember that overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, which makes it perform poorly on new, unseen data. Regularization is a technique to prevent this by adding a penalty to the loss function.

What's ℓ₂ regularization? Oh right, it's also called Ridge Regression. It adds a term to the cost function, which is the sum of the squares of the model's weights multiplied by a coefficient (the regularization strength). So the cost function becomes something like adding (λ * sum(w²)) to the original cost.

Now, when you increase λ (the regularization coefficient), what happens? Well, with a higher λ, the model's weights are penalized more. This tends to make the model's weights smaller because the added term is a penalty. So if the weights are getting smaller, that might relate to bias.

Bias is the average of the output across all the examples in the training set, right? In a model that's not using ℓ₂ regularization, the weights could be large, leading to high bias. But when regularization is added, the weights get smaller, which would bring the model closer to having zero bias. So bias should decrease as λ increases.

But wait, I remember that ℓ₂ regularization doesn't add any bias. It affects the model's weights. So the model's bias (the model's tendency to make predictions based on the mean of the data) is not directly affected by ℓ₂ regularization. But maybe it does affect the model's variance.

Variance is the model's sensitivity to changes in the training data. Overfitting implies high variance. So when the model becomes too complex (due to high λ), it starts to fit the noise in the training data instead of the underlying pattern. That's why increasing regularization would make the model more complex, increasing variance.

Wait, but does ℓ₂ regularization actually affect variance? Or is it more about reducing bias and thus possibly lowering variance? Hmm, maybe I should think about this differently. 

In regular linear regression (without regularization), the model has a certain bias and a certain variance. With regularization, the model's complexity is controlled by the regularization strength. If you have a very high λ, the model's weights become very small, which might make it less complex. But wait, does that make it less prone to overfitting? No, I think that's the opposite. High λ makes the model more complex because the weights are larger in magnitude. 

Wait, no, wait. Oh, no, wait. Oh wait, I think I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. When you increase λ, the regularization term becomes larger, so the cost function increases. This forces the model to have smaller weights because the penalty is higher. So the model's complexity is reduced.

Wait, wait, maybe I have the model's capacity the other way around. If you increase λ, the model becomes more constrained, so it's less likely to overfit. So in that sense, the model's variance decreases because it's less likely to fit the noise.

But wait, the question says that the model is already overfitting. So adding ℓ₂ regularization is meant to prevent that. So the model's variance is increasing, because without regularization, it might have low bias and high variance. With regularization, the model's variance increases because it's more likely to overfit the noise.

Wait, no. Let me think about what happens when you increase λ. The model's weights are smaller, which means that the model's predictions are less sensitive to the training data. Because the model can't change as much as before because the weights are smaller. So if the weights are smaller, the model is less likely to vary much with different training sets. That would decrease the variance.

But wait, in the case of overfitting, the model's variance is high. So adding regularization (ℓ₂) would make the model's variance lower? But that seems contradictory because I thought that adding regularization would make the model less likely to overfit, which would lower variance.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me try to recap:

1. Without regularization: model has high variance, low bias.
2. With regularization: model's weights are smaller, so the model's predictions are less sensitive to the data.
   - This means the model is less likely to overfit, so variance decreases.
   - But this also reduces the bias because the model's predictions are based on a smaller set of weights, so the model doesn't have to account for the same noise as before.

So when you increase λ, you get a model with lower bias and lower variance.

Wait, but the question says the model is overfitting, so they're adding ℓ₂ regularization. So adding ℓ₂ regularization should reduce overfitting, which would mean lower variance. But the options given don't all show both bias and variance changing the same way.

Wait, the question says: when you increase the regularization coefficient, what happens to bias and variance.

So, according to my reasoning:

- Bias decreases (because weights are smaller)
- Variance decreases (because model is less likely to overfit)

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is "Bias increase; variance decrease." Option F is "Bias remains; variance increases." Option H is "Variance remains; bias increases." But none of these options have both decrease.

Wait, let me think again. If I add ℓ2 regularization, the model's weights get smaller. So the model's bias (the mean prediction) decreases because it's not being pulled towards the data as much. 

But what about variance? Variance is the model's sensitivity to the training data. If the model's weights are smaller, it's less likely to overfit. So the model's variance decreases because it's less prone to fitting noise.

Wait, but the question says the model is overfitting. So adding regularization should make it less overfitting, which would lower the variance. So that would mean:

- Bias decreases.
- Variance decreases.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option where both are decreasing (except perhaps option E, which says both decrease, but E says bias increases, which is the opposite of what I said).

Wait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think about this again.

Wait, wait another thought. The initial question says the model is overfitting. This suggests that as you increase the regularization, it's not helping to reduce overfitting. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the effect of increasing the coefficient.

Wait, no. Adding ℓ2 regularization (which is a form of L2 regularization) will increase the penalty on large weights. So higher λ makes the model's weights smaller, which makes the model less sensitive to the data.

So the model's bias (the average prediction) would decrease because the model is not making as big a prediction for each data point. But since it's less likely to overfit, the model's variance would decrease.

Wait, but in the scenario where the model is already overfitting, adding more regularization (higher λ) would actually make it even more likely to overfit. But in this question, the model is being trained to not overfit, so perhaps the λ is being increased beyond the optimal point.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about what each option says.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Bias increase; variance decrease. => Both happen, but I thought bias would decrease.

Option F: Bias remains; variance increases. => No, variance should decrease.

Option G: Neither... => Both remain.

Option I: Bias decrease; variance decrease.

So option I says both decrease. But according to my reasoning, both would decrease.

Wait, but does ℓ₂ regularization actually decrease the model's variance? Because if you add a penalty, you're making the model less likely to overfit, which would mean lower variance.

Wait, but when you add ℓ₂ regularization, the model's variance decreases because the weights become smaller, so the model is less prone to overfitting.

So the correct scenario is that both bias and variance decrease.

Looking back to the options, option I is "Bias decrease; variance decrease."

Wait, but in the problem statement, the question is saying that the model is overfitting, and when adding ℓ2 regularization, what happens.

But this scenario is about adding regularization even though the model is already overfitting. So perhaps the question is about when you add more λ, which would make the model less likely to overfit, thus reducing variance.

But in the question, it's about what happens when you increase the regularization coefficient. So perhaps the model's variance decreases.

Wait, but in the scenario where the model is overfitting, adding more regularization (higher λ) would make it even more confident, thus reducing variance.

So according to the options, which includes option I (both decrease) as a possibility.

But looking again, none of the options except option E and F and I seem to have both decreasing.

Wait, no, option E says bias increases, variance decreases. Option I says both decrease.

But according to my reasoning, when you add ℓ₂ regularization, the model's weights get smaller, leading to lower bias and lower variance.

So the correct option should be I: Bias decrease; variance decrease.

But wait, looking at the options again, the options are:

E: Bias increase; Variance decrease.

H: Variance remains; Bias increases.

I: Bias decrease; Variance decrease.

So the correct answer should be I.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes I remember that adding regularization tends to reduce variance. But in this case, if the model is already overfitting, perhaps increasing λ would make it more prone to overfitting, which would increase variance.

Wait, no, wait. Oh! Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought that increasing λ reduces the weights, which reduces variance. But in the case of an overfitting model, perhaps the regularization is meant to prevent that. So if you increase λ beyond the optimal point, the model starts to overfit more, leading to higher variance. But in the question, the model is already overfitting, so adding more λ would make it worse.

Wait, but the question is about what happens when you increase the regularization coefficient. So it's not about going beyond the optimal point. It's just adding more λ.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong in my initial reasoning. Let me re-examine.

When you increase λ, you're adding a stronger penalty on the weights. So the model's weights are smaller. 

So the model's bias decreases (since it's less likely to have a mean prediction that's way off from the data), and the model's variance decreases because it's less likely to fit the noise.

But if the model is already overfitting, perhaps that suggests that adding more λ (i.e., increasing the regularization coefficient) would make it even worse. Hmm, but the question is about what happens as you increase the coefficient, not necessarily whether it's beyond the optimal point.

So perhaps the model's bias and variance would both decrease as λ increases.

So looking at the options, the only option that says both decrease is option I.

But wait, looking at the options again, option E says bias increases and variance decreases. So that's the opposite of what I thought.

Wait, what's the difference between bias and variance when you increase λ.

Wait, let me think with an example. Imagine linear regression with no regularization. The model has high variance and low bias.

As you increase λ, the model's weights get smaller. So the model's predictions are less confident. So the model's bias decreases because the predictions are centered around a smaller mean. Variance decreases because the predictions are more stable and less likely to vary much between different training sets.

So in this case, both bias and variance decrease.

Looking back, that would be option I.

So the correct answer is option I: "Bias decrease; Variance decrease."

The question involves a linear regression model that is overfitting due to the addition of ℓ₂ regularization. The task is to determine how bias and variance change as the regularization coefficient increases.

### Key Analysis:
1. **ℓ₂ Regularization (Ridge Regression):**  
   Adding ℓ₂ regularization penalizes the sum of the squares of the model's weights, increasing the cost function. This forces the weights to become smaller as the regularization coefficient (λ) increases. Smaller weights lead to:
   - **Bias Decrease:** The model's predictions become less influenced by outliers and noise, reducing the mean prediction.
   - **Variance Decrease:** The model becomes less sensitive to training data fluctuations, reducing its variance.

2. **Overfitting Context:**  
   The initial overfitting suggests that increasing λ might further exacerbate this issue. However, the question focuses on the effect of increasing λ while the model is already overfitting. This implies that the regularization is applied beyond the optimal point, potentially making the model even more prone to overfitting if λ continues to increase. However, the question is about the immediate effect of increasing λ, not whether it surpasses the optimal value.

3. **Options Analysis:**  
   - **Option E (Bias increase; Variance decrease):** Incorrect. Increasing λ reduces bias and variance.  
   - **Option F (Bias remains constant; Variance increases):** Incorrect. Increasing λ reduces bias and variance.  
   - **Option G (Neither bias nor variance affected):** Incorrect. Regularization directly impacts bias and variance.  
   - **Option I (Bias decrease; Variance decrease):** Correct. Increasing λ reduces both bias and variance.  
   - **Option J (Bias remains constant; Variance decreases):** Incorrect. Increasing λ reduces both bias and variance.  
   - **Option H (Variance remains constant; Bias increases):** Incorrect. Regularization reduces both bias and variance.  
   - **Option A (Bias increase; Variance increase):** Incorrect. Regularization reduces both bias and variance.  
   - **Option B (Bias decrease; Variance increase):** Incorrect. Regularization reduces both bias and variance.  
   - **Option C (Neither bias nor variance affected):** Incorrect. Regularization directly impacts bias and variance.  
   - **Option D (Variance remains constant; Bias decreases):** Incorrect. Regularization reduces both bias and variance.  
   - **Option E:** Correct. Both bias and variance decrease.

### Conclusion:
As the regularization coefficient (λ) increases, both bias and variance decrease. This aligns with **Option I**.
