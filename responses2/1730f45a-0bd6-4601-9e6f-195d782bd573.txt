Question:

When the graph of a certain function $f(x)$ is shifted $2$ units to the right and stretched vertically by a factor of $2$ (meaning that all $y$-coordinates are doubled), the resulting figure is identical to the original graph. Given that $f(0)=0.1$, what is $f(10)$?

Options:

A: 0.01
B: 32
C: 3.2
D: 5
E: 1
F: 0.2
G: 0.5
H: 2
I: 10
J: 20

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a function f(x) that, when shifted 2 units to the right and stretched vertically by a factor of 2, becomes identical to the original graph. Interesting. I need to find f(10) given that f(0) is 0.1. The options are from A to J, so I'll need to figure out which one is the correct answer.

First, let me try to understand what the problem is saying. The function is being transformed in two ways: shifted 2 units to the right and stretched vertically by 2. So, mathematically, what does that transformation look like?

When a function is shifted to the right by 2 units, that's a horizontal shift. I remember that shifting a function f(x) right by h units is done by replacing x with (x - h). So, shifting f(x) right by 2 would give f(x - 2). 

Next, stretching vertically by a factor of 2. Vertical stretching is a transformation that affects the y-values. If I have a function multiplied by a factor, say 2 times f(x), that's a vertical stretch. So, stretching f(x) vertically by 2 would give 2f(x).

Putting it all together, the transformed function is 2 * f(x - 2). According to the problem, this transformed function is identical to the original function f(x). So, we can write this as:

2 * f(x - 2) = f(x)

That's the key equation here. So, for all x, twice f(x - 2) equals f(x). Hmm, this suggests that the function f(x) is related to its value two units to the left (since it's shifted right, the equation relates f(x) to f(x - 2)), but scaled by 2.

I think this is a functional equation. Maybe I can solve it by recognizing a pattern or finding a recursive relation. Let's try to express f(x) in terms of f(x - 2):

f(x) = 2 * f(x - 2)

So, this means that every time x increases by 2, the function's value is doubled. So, if I can find f(x) for some x, I can find f(x + 2) by just doubling it.

Given that, let's see if we can express f(10) in terms of f(0). Since 10 is 2*5, maybe we can apply this transformation multiple times.

Starting from x = 0, f(0) is given as 0.1.

Let's compute f(2): f(2) = 2 * f(0) = 2 * 0.1 = 0.2.

Then, f(4) = 2 * f(2) = 2 * 0.2 = 0.4.

f(6) = 2 * f(4) = 2 * 0.4 = 0.8.

f(8) = 2 * f(6) = 2 * 0.8 = 1.6.

f(10) = 2 * f(8) = 2 * 1.6 = 3.2.

Wait, so f(10) is 3.2? Let me see if that makes sense. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting at f(0) = 0.1.

f(2) = 2*f(0) = 0.2.

f(4) = 2*f(2) = 0.4.

f(6) = 2*f(4) = 0.8.

f(8) = 2*f(6) = 1.6.

f(10) = 2*f(8) = 3.2.

Yes, that seems consistent. So, each step is doubling the previous value, so after five doublings (from 0 to 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), the value would be 0.1 * 2^5 = 0.1 * 32 = 3.2.

Wait, 2^5 is 32, so 0.1 * 32 is 3.2. That matches f(10) = 3.2, which is option C.

Let me make sure I didn't mix up the direction of the shift. The function is shifted right by 2, which affects the x inside the function, so f(x - 2). Then it's stretched vertically by 2, so multiply by 2. And the result is the same function, so 2f(x - 2) = f(x). That seems correct.

Alternatively, sometimes when you have functions that repeat or scale, it's helpful to think of them as geometric sequences. Since every 2 units, the function value doubles, it's a geometric progression with ratio 2, starting at x=0.

So, f(n*2) = 0.1 * 2^n, where n is the number of 2-unit steps. For x=10, n=5, so 2^5=32, 0.1*32=3.2. Yep, that's solid.

Looking at the options, option C is 3.2. So, I think that's the answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the functional equation resulting from the transformation. The function f(x) satisfies 2f(x - 2) = f(x), indicating a doubling every 2 units. Starting from f(0) = 0.1, each subsequent value is double the previous one after every 2 units. Thus, f(10) = 0.1 * 2^5 = 3.2.

Answer: C
