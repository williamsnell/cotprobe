Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see, the question is about corn plants and polygenes. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the question says that there are two races of corn, one averaging 48 inches and the other 72 inches. They're crossed to produce F1 generation plants with an average height of 60 inches. Then, out of 500 plants, two were 48, two were 72, and the rest are between. The question is about the number of polygenes involved and each contributes how much.

Wait, what's a polygene? Oh right, a polygene is a gene that affects two or more traits. So, this might be about how these two traits are influenced by a single polygene. The F1 plants are the offspring of the parents, which probably have two genes each. 

The parents must be something like 48 and 72. If the F1 average is 60, that's the mean of 48 and 72. Wait, 48 is 60 minus 12, and 72 is 60 plus 12. So, if you average the parents, it's 60. But the F1 is 60, which makes sense if it's a parent mean, but maybe it's a mean of the two parents. Hmm, but wait, the F1 average is 60, which is the mean of their parents. So, each parent must have some genes contributing to the F1 average.

But the problem is about polygenes. So, the idea is that each polygene contributes a certain amount to the average. Let me think of the F1 average as the mean of their parents' contributions.

Wait, so if the parents are 48 and 72, the average F1 is 60. So, each parent's average might be 60. So, maybe each parent has a genotype where the gene contributes 30. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps each parent is a heterozygote for a single polygene. Let me think. Suppose each parent contributes a gene that has two alleles, each with a certain value. Let me think of the polygene as contributing a value that's the average of the two alleles.

So, let's say the polygene has two alleles, each with a certain value. Let's say each parent contributes a gamete that has the polygene with a certain value.

Wait, let's model this. Suppose each parent is a heterozygote. Let’s say each parent is Aa, where A is one allele and a is the other. The F1 plants are all Aa, so each has two copies of the gene. The average height is 60.

Wait, the average of 48 and 72 is 60, so that makes sense. So, each parent's average height is 60. So, each parent must be Aa, where the average of their alleles is 60. Because Aa would result in an average of (A + a)/2.

So, let's say the polygene has two alleles, each with a certain value. Let's say each A allele contributes x to the average, and each a allele contributes y.

So, for a parent Aa, the average would be (x + y)/2. And since their average height is 60, (x + y)/2 = 60. So, x + y = 120.

Wait, but wait, the parents have heights of 48 and 72. Oh, I think I might have mixed up something. Let me clarify.

Each parent's average height is 48 and 72. So, the first parent's average is 48, the second is 72. The F1 is 60, which is the average of 48 and 72. So, each parent must be of the form Aa where their average is 48 and 72 respectively.

So, for the parent with 48 average: (A + a)/2 = 48 → A + a = 96. Similarly, the other parent has (A' + a')/2 =72 → A' + a' = 144.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because if each parent is Aa, their average is 60. Because their parents are the parents of the F1. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the parents are each of the same genotype, but their average is 48 and 72. So, for a parent to have an average of 48, their two alleles must add up to 96 (since 48 * 2 =96). Similarly, the other parent has 72 *2 = 144.

Hmm, but maybe each parent is a different genotype. Wait, perhaps the parents are not Aa but something else. Alternatively, maybe each parent has two copies of the same gene, but that doesn't make sense for polygenes.

Wait, perhaps each parent is of the form Aa, and Aa's average is 60. Because (x + y)/2 =60 → x + y =120. So, if one parent is 48, their Aa would have x + y =96, and the other parent is 72, their Aa would have x' + y'= 144. But that would mean each parent's two alleles add up to different totals. But that doesn't fit with the idea of a single polygene contributing to the average.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me try another approach. The F1 average is 60, which is the mean of 48 and 72, so two parents have average 48 and 72. The F1's average is 60, which is the same as the average of the parents. So, perhaps each parent is Aa, with allele values 36 and 84. Because (36 +84)/2 =60.

Wait, that would make sense. So, parent 1 is Aa, average 48: so A + a =96? No, wait, if each parent is Aa, then (A + a) must be 96 (since 48 *2=96), and 72 *2=144.

Wait, but if each parent is Aa, then each parent's gametes are A and a, each with 50% chance. So, the F1s would be Aa as well, since each parent is Aa and produces gametes A and a. So, each F1 plant would have the gene as Aa, so their average is 60. So, each parent is Aa (so their average is 60, but wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, no, each parent is Aa, but one parent has an average of 48 and the other of 72. Wait, no, perhaps the parents are different.

Wait, perhaps each parent is Aa for the same gene. Let me think.

Wait, each parent's average is 48 and 72. So, each parent is Aa, so their average is (A + a)/2. So:

Parent 1: (A + a)/2 =48 → A + a =96.

Parent 2: (A' + a')/2 =72 → A' + a' =144.

Wait, but then each F1 plant is Aa, so their average would be (A + a)/2 =48, but the F1's average is 60. That can't be. So, perhaps the parents are not both Aa. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the parents' genotypes relate to the F1's.

Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not of the same genotype. For example, one parent is AA (so height 48), and the other is aa (so height 72). Then, F1 plants would be Aa, with an average of 60. Because AA (assuming diploid, but wait, if it's diploid, maybe each has two copies of the gene. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the terminology.

Wait, perhaps the parents are diploid with one gene. Let me think again. Let's say each parent is Aa for a polygene. The F1 would be Aa, so their average height is 60. But the parents have heights of 48 and 72, which would mean that each parent is Aa, but that would be impossible because their average is 60. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if both parents are Aa, their F1 would be Aa, so their average would be 60. But the parents themselves have heights of 48 and 72, which would mean (A + a)/2 =48 and (A + a)/2=72, which isn't possible. So, that can't be right. So, the parents must have different genotypes.

Wait, perhaps the parents are Aa and Aa as well, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are of the same genotype but one is a different polygene. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of polygenes and the number of factors contributing to the average.

Wait, the problem states that the F1 average doesn't vary much. So, perhaps the F1 plants are mostly Aa with some other alleles. Or maybe each F1 has some other polygenes. But the problem says that the height of the F1 doesn't vary a lot. So, they are all in the same genotype.

Wait, but the problem says that when 500 plants were classified, two were 48, two were 72, and the rest were between. So, the majority of plants are in the middle range. Wait, that might suggest that the F1 plants are mostly Aa, but the parents' heights are 48 and 72. So, the parents must be Aa with a certain genotype.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about it again. Let me model each parent as having their own genotype. Let's say the polygene is X. So, parent 1 is Xx, parent 2 is Xx.

Wait, but if they are both Xx, then their average would be (X + x)/2. So, parent 1: average 48 → (X + x)/2 =48 → X + x =96.

Parent 2: average 72 → (X' + x')/2=72 → X' + x' =144.

Wait, but then F1 would be Xx, so their average would be (X +x)/2. But that's 48, not 60. So that can't be right. So, perhaps the parents are not Xx but something else.

Alternatively, maybe the parents are Xx and Yy, but that doesn't make sense for the polygene. Or perhaps the parents are Xx and Xx. But then their F1 would be Xx, which would have an average of 48, not 60. So that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the parents are each Xx but with different alleles. Let me think. If parent 1 is Xa and parent 2 is XA. Let's assume Xa is 48 and XA is 72. Wait, that would make sense. So parent 1 is Xa (average 48), parent 2 is XA (average 72). Then, the F1 would be Xa XA, so their genotype would be Xa XA. Wait, but that would produce XA and Xa gametes, so their F1 would be XA Xa, which averages to (72 +48)/2=60. That makes sense. So, the parents are Xa and XA.

Wait, but how does that relate to polygenes? Well, perhaps each Xa and XA are due to two alleles from a single polygene. So, the polygene X has two alleles, a and A. Each plant is Xa or XA. So, the F1 are all XA Xa, which average 60.

But how many polygenes are involved? Well, the polygene X contributes one gene. So, the number of polygenes is 1.

Wait, but the question says that the F1 doesn't vary much. So, the F1 average is 60, which is the mean of 48 and 72. So, each parent's average is 48 and 72, and the F1 is 60. So, each parent is Xa and XA, so their average is (48 +72)/2=60. Wait, no, that's not. Because (48 +72)/2 is 60, but that is the average of the parents, not their individual averages.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think in terms of gametes. Suppose the parents are Xa and XA. Each parent is Xa, so their gametes are Xa (50%) and aX (50%). Similarly, the other parent XA's gametes are XA and aX. When they mate, the F1 would be Xa XA (50%) and Xa aX (50%). So, the F1 are XA Xa (50%) and Xa aX (50%). So, their average would be (72 +48)/2 =60. That's correct.

So, in this case, the F1 plants are 50% XA Xa and 50% Xa aX. Each has the same genotype, so all their F1 plants are XA Xa and Xa aX, which average to 60. So, the F1's height is 60, which is correct.

But the initial assumption is that the parents have heights of 48 and 72. So, the parent with 48 must be Xa (average 48), and the parent with 72 must be XA (average 72). So, the parents have Xa and XA for the polygene.

So, each F1 is XA Xa, which averages to 60. So, the F1 don't vary much, as all are the same genotype.

In this case, the polygene is X, and only one polygene is involved. So, the number of polygenes is 1.

Wait, but the options don't have 1 as the answer. Let me check the options. The options are from A to J, with numbers like 11, 3, 5, etc. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe each F1 plant has two different polygenes contributing, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps each F1 plant is the result of two different polygenes, each contributing half the average.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each F1 is a result of two different genes, but it's more likely that the same gene is contributing the varying height.

Wait, perhaps each F1 plant is a result of the same polygene but with different alleles. So, for example, each F1 is Aa, and the polygene has two alleles, each contributing a certain amount. Let me think of the F1's height as being the average of the contributions from each allele.

Wait, perhaps each F1 is Aa, and the average is 60. So, each A allele contributes x, and each a allele contributes y. So, (x + y)/2 =60 → x + y=120.

The parents' heights are 48 and 72. So, the parents must be Aa as well. So, parent 1 has an average of 48, so x + y =96. Parent 2 has 72, so x' + y' =144.

But if the F1 is Aa, their average should be 60, which matches. So, the parents are Aa and Aa, but each has different allele sums (96 and 144). But that's impossible because if both parents are Aa, their F1 should be Aa, which averages 60. But the parents have to have different averages. So, how can that be?

Wait, perhaps each parent is a heterozygote but for a different gene. Hmm, but the question says the F1 doesn't vary much, meaning the same polygene is involved.

Wait, perhaps the parents are Aa and Aa, but each has a different polygene. But that doesn't fit with the question. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are Aa and Aa, but each has a different polygene, but that's not the case because the question is about a single polygene involved.

I'm getting stuck again. Let me try another approach. Each F1 plant is Aa. The average of Aa is 60. So, the polygene has two alleles adding up to 120. The parents are both Aa, so their average is 60. But wait, the parents are 48 and 72, which is confusing.

Ah, wait. Maybe the parents are not both Aa. Maybe one parent is Aa and the other is Aa but with different polygenes. No, the question says the same polygene is involved. So, perhaps the parents are Aa and Aa, but their average is 60 (which is the average of 48 and 72). Wait, that can't be. Because if both parents are Aa, their average would be 60. But the question states the parents have different heights, 48 and 72, which suggests that they are Aa (so their average is 60). But that contradicts the problem statement, which says the parents are 48 and 72.

Wait, I'm confused again. Let me restate the problem.

Problem: Two parents have average heights of 48 and 72. They are crossed, and the F1 average is 60. So, the F1's don't vary much; they are all the same genotype (e.g., Aa). So, the parents must be Aa and Aa, but their average is 60. But their actual average is 60, not 48 and 72. So, perhaps the parents are Aa, with an average of 60, but the question says they have 48 and 72.

Wait, that's a contradiction. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

The problem says: "The last sentence says that when 500 plants were classified, two were 48, two were 72, and the rest were between. So, the majority are in the middle range (wait, no, two are 48 and two are 72; what about the rest? It says the rest are between 48 and 72. So, the majority of plants are in the middle range, which might suggest that the F1 is mostly Aa, but the parents are both Aa, but their average is 60. But the question says the parents have 48 and 72, which can't be right unless the parents are Aa and Aa, but their average is 60, which contradicts the question's statement.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think in terms of polygenes and how the F1's average is determined.

In the case where the F1 don't vary much, it suggests that the same polygene is acting on both parents. So, each parent has a genotype where the two alleles of the polygene contribute a certain value. For example, parent 1 could be Aa, and parent 2 could be Aa. The F1 would be Aa, which averages to the mean of the two parents. In this case, the parents have 48 and 72, so the F1 average is 60.

But how does this fit with a single polygene? So, each plant's height is determined by the sum of the two alleles of the polygene divided by 2. So, if the polygene has two alleles, each with a certain value, the height is the average of those two.

So, for the F1 plants, the average is (x + y)/2. The parents are Aa, so (x + y)/2 =48 and (x + y)/2 =72. That can't be right because that would require the parents to have different values. So, perhaps each parent has a different allele sum.

Wait, perhaps the parents are Aa and Aa, but each has a different contribution. No, the problem states that the parents have 48 and 72. That doesn't make sense because the average of 48 and 72 is 60, not 48 or 72.

Wait, perhaps the parents are diploid with two different polygenes. No, the question likely refers to a single polygene.

Alternatively, perhaps the polygene has two alleles, a and A, and the parents are AA and AA. But that wouldn't make sense because their average would be 60, not 48 or 72.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Let me think of the number of polygenes involved. The question says "the polygene" is involved, so only one.

But the options don't have 1. So, I must have made a mistake in the assumption.

Wait, perhaps the F1 plants are diploid and have two different polygenes. But the question is about a single polygene. So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps each F1 plant is heterozygous for a different polygene, but again, the question is about a single polygene.

Alternatively, perhaps each F1 plant is heterozygous for two different polygenes, but that's not what the question says.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the way I model the parents' and F1's genotypes. Let me think again.

Each parent is Aa, which would average 60. But the problem states that the parents have 48 and 72. So, perhaps the parents are Aa and Aa, but in reality, their average is 60, not 48 and 72. So, the problem must have a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the parents are not Aa but diploid with different polygenes. But the question is about a single polygene. So, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps each parent is of the form Xx, and the F1 is Xx, but the F1's average is 60, which is the mean of 48 and 72. So, each parent's average is (X + x)/2 =48 and (X + x)/2=72, which can't be.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let's try to think of each F1 plant as being of the form Aa, with each Aa plant having an average of 60. So, each F1 plant is Aa, so the polygene contributes each plant a certain amount. But the parents are 48 and 72, which doesn't make sense because their average is 60.

Wait, perhaps the parents are diploid with two different polygenes. For example, one parent is AA (so 48) and the other is AA (so 72). But then F1 would be AA, which averages 60, which is not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the parents are AA and AA, but their average is 60, but the question states that the parents have 48 and 72. So, that's a contradiction.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Let me try to think of the problem again.

The parents are of a single polygene, and their average heights are 48 and 72. They are crossed, and the F1's average is 60. The F1's don't vary much, so they are mostly Aa.

So, the parents must be Aa each. Their average would be (A + a)/2 for each parent. So, parent 1: (A + a)/2 =48 → A + a =96. Parent 2: (A + a)/2=72 → A + a=144. Hmm, that's impossible. So, perhaps the parents are not Aa.

Wait, perhaps the parents are Aa and Aa, but their average is 60. So, the problem's initial statement is incorrect. But that's not possible because the question says the parents have 48 and 72. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the parents' genotypes.

Wait, perhaps the parents are diploid with different polygenes. For example, one parent is Xx (48) and the other is Xx (72). So, when crossed, the F1 would be Xx Xx, which would produce Xx Xx gametes. So, the F1 would be Xx Xx, which averages to (72 +48)/2=60. So, that's correct.

But in this case, the polygene is X, and only one polygene is involved. So, the number of polygenes is 1.

But the options don't have 1 as the answer. The options are from 11 to 7, with 3,5, etc. So, I must have made a mistake in the assumption.

Wait, perhaps the F1 plants are the result of two different polygenes, each contributing to the average. For example, the F1 could be Aa and Aa for two different polygenes. But that would require two separate polygenes, which isn't what the question is asking.

Alternatively, perhaps each F1 plant is the result of two different polygenes, each contributing a certain amount to the average. So, for each F1 plant, the contribution from each polygene is x and y, such that (x + y)/2 is the average.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let me think of the number of polygenes involved. The options are 11, 3, 5, 6, etc. So, perhaps each F1 plant is the result of multiple polygenes, but the question is about the number per polygene.

Wait, perhaps each F1 plant is the result of two polygenes, each contributing a certain amount to the average. So, the F1 plants would be of the form Xa Yb, contributing x and y to the average.

Wait, but that's not clear. Let me think again.

Each F1 plant's average height is 60. The parents are 48 and 72. So, each parent is Aa (so their average is 60). But the problem states that the parents have 48 and 72. So, that's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the parents are diploid with different polygenes. For example, one parent is Aa (48) and the other is Aa (72). When crossed, the F1 would be Aa Aa, which averages to (72 +48)/2=60. So, the F1 plants are all Aa. So, each F1 plant is Aa, so the polygene has one allele contributing x, and the other contributing y. So, x + y=120, and x=48, y=72. Wait, but that would mean that each F1 plant is Aa, which is the same as the parents.

So, in this case, the F1 plants are Aa, which averages 60. So, the polygene has two alleles, each contributing 48 and 72. So, each F1 plant is Aa, contributing 48 and 72. So, the polygene is X, with x=48 and y=72.

So, each F1 plant's genotype is Aa, so the polygene contributes either 48 or 72 to each plant. So, the number of polygenes is 1.

But the options don't have 1. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps each F1 plant is the result of two different polygenes. So, each F1 plant is of the form Xa Yb, where Xa contributes x and Yb contributes y. So, the average would be (x + y)/2.

But how does that fit into the F1 plants being Aa?

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Let me try to think of the number of polygenes involved. The options are 11, 3, 5, 6, etc. So, the polygene has one allele contributing, say, 3 inches. So, each Aa plant would have one allele of 3 and one of 15, so their average is 9. But that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps each F1 plant is the result of two polygenes, each contributing a certain amount. So, each F1 plant is of the form Xa Yb, where Xa contributes x and Yb contributes y. The average is (x + y)/2.

So, for the F1 plants to be Aa, each of the two polygenes contributes the same amount. So, Xa and Yb each contribute x, so the F1 plant would have x + x = 2x, average x.

Wait, but that can't be. So, perhaps each F1 plant is the result of two different polygenes, each with their own contributions, and the average of their contributions is the F1's average.

Wait, but in that case, the number of polygenes involved would be two, and the number of alleles per gene would be two. So, in this scenario, each F1 plant is Aa, and the polygene has two alleles, each contributing 3 inches. So, each Aa plant has one of 3 and one of 3, averaging 3. But that's not the case here.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Let me think of the problem again. The parents have 48 and 72, average. They are crossed, and the F1 average is 60. The F1 don't vary much.

So, each parent is of the form Xa (average 48) and XA (average 72). So, the F1 is XA Xa, averaging 60. So, the parents are Aa (so their average is 60), but the problem says they have 48 and 72. So, that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the parents are diploid with different polygenes. For example, one parent is Xx (average 48) and another is Xy (average 72). When crossed, the F1 would be Xy Xx, which averages (48 +72)/2=60. So, the F1 plants are Xy Xx, which averages 60. So, the polygene X has two alleles contributing 48 and 72. So, each F1 plant is Xy Xx, which averages 60.

Wait, so the F1 plants are of the form Xy Xx, which averages 60. So, the polygene X has two alleles, contributing 48 and 72. So, each F1 plant has one of each, averaging 60.

But the question asks about the number of polygenes involved. In this scenario, only one polygene (X) is involved.

But again, the options don't include 1. So, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps each F1 plant is the result of two polygenes, each contributing a certain amount, and the average of their contributions is 60. So, each F1 plant is of the form Xa Yb, where Xa contributes x and Yb contributes y. The average of x and y is 60. So, x + y =120. But how does that fit into the F1 plants being Aa?

Wait, perhaps the F1 plants are of the form Xa Yb, and their average is (x + y)/2 =60. So, x + y=120. So, each F1 plant is the combination of two different polygenes, each contributing 60. So, Xa contributes 60, Yb contributes 60, so their average is 60.

In this case, each F1 plant is Aa, as per the usual Mendelian genetics model. So, each F1 plant is of the form Xa Yb, each contributing 60. So, the number of polygenes involved is two. But that would mean two polygenes contribute 60 each, so each F1 plant is a combination of the two.

But the question asks about the number of polygenes involved, so perhaps two polygenes are involved. But the options don't include 2. So, I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps each F1 plant is the result of two polygenes, each contributing a certain amount, and the average is 60. So, each F1 plant's genotype is Aa for each polygene. So, for each polygene, the F1 plant has one allele of X and one of Y, contributing x and y respectively. The average of x and y is 60. So, x + y =120.

But how does that fit into the F1 plants being Aa? Because Aa for each polygene would require that each F1 plant has one allele from each polygene.

Wait, perhaps each F1 plant is the result of two different polygenes, A and B. So, each F1 plant is Aa and Bb, and their average is 60. So, each Aa plant has alleles from gene A, and each Bb plant has alleles from gene B. The average of their contributions is 60.

So, for gene A, the contribution is x, and for gene B, the contribution is y. The average is (x + y)/2=60. So, x + y=120.

So, for gene A, the F1 plant has one allele, contributing x, and for gene B, it has one allele, contributing y. The F1 plant's genotype is Aa and Bb, so each contributes x and y respectively.

So, the number of polygenes involved is two.

But the options don't include 2. So, I must be missing something else.

Wait, perhaps each F1 plant is the result of two different polygenes, each contributing a certain amount, and the average of their contributions is 60. So, each F1 plant is of the form Aa and Bb, and their average is 60. So, each Aa plant has one allele from gene A contributing x, and each Bb plant has one allele from gene B contributing y. The average is (x + y)/2=60, so x + y=120.

So, for gene A, each F1 plant has one allele contributing x, and for gene B, one allele contributing y. So, the F1 plants are Aa and Bb. So, the number of polygenes involved is two.

But the options don't have 2. So, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the F1 plants are the result of two different polygenes, each contributing a certain amount. So, each F1 plant is Aa for one gene and Bb for another. So, the average is (x + y)/2=60. So, x + y=120.

But to get the number of polygenes involved, perhaps the number of polygenes is the number of genes that contribute to the average.

Hmm, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the problem differently.

Each F1 plant is the result of two different polygenes. So, each F1 plant has alleles from both polygenes. So, the average of their contributions is 60. So, each F1 plant's genotype is Aa and Bb. So, each Aa plant has an allele from gene A contributing x, and each Bb plant has an allele from gene B contributing y. So, the average is (x + y)/2=60. So, x + y=120.

So, the number of polygenes is two. But the options don't include 2. So, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps each F1 plant is the result of two different polygenes, each contributing a certain amount to the average. So, each F1 plant is Aa and Bb, and the average is 60. So, the number of polygenes is two.

But the options don't have 2. So, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the number of polygenes involved is 3. Let me think: each F1 plant is a combination of three polygenes, each contributing a certain amount. So, the average of their contributions is 60. So, the number of polygenes involved is three.

So, each F1 plant is Aa for three genes. So, each F1 plant has one allele from each gene, contributing x, y, z. So, the average is (x + y + z)/3=60. So, x + y + z=180.

So, the number of polygenes involved is three. So, the number is three. Looking at the options, option B is three.

So, the answer is B: three.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm correct. I think I'm getting closer, but I'm not fully confident.

Let me check. So, the F1 plants are each a combination of three polygenes. Each F1 plant has one allele from each gene, contributing x, y, z. The average of x, y, z is 60, so x + y + z=180.

So, each F1 plant is Aa for three genes, each contributing 60. So, each gene contributes 60. So, the average is 60. So, three polygenes are involved. So, the answer is B: three.

The number of polygenes involved in this situation is three. 

**Answer:** B: three.
