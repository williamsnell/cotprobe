Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question. Let's break down the question.

The question is about the circumstances under which an officer may arrest someone without a warrant. The options are A, B, C, D, and I have to pick which one is not one of those. So, I'll think about each option in detail.

First, what do I know about criminal arrest without a warrant? I remember that arrest without a warrant is a legal procedure, but it's not always allowed, especially in some jurisdictions. It's more common in certain situations, like when a person is under arrest and needs to be released, but that's a different scenario. Here, the focus is on the circumstances when an arrest can be made without a warrant.

Option A: A misdemeanor has occurred, and an officer must believe that the person he has arrested committed it.
Hmm, I think when an officer is arresting someone, they need to have probable cause. For a misdemeanor, perhaps they have to believe that the person is guilty. But wait, maybe the reasoning is that if a misdemeanor has occurred, the officer must believe it. Or perhaps it's not about belief but about the actual occurrence. Wait, I think for misdemeanor criminality, the officer has to believe that the person is guilty of the misdemeanor, so that's a scenario where arrest without a warrant isn't allowed unless belief is present. Or maybe for misdemeanors, they do require belief. Or perhaps for misdemeanors, the officer can't arrest without a warrant unless the crime is a misdemeanor. Wait, no, the way the option is phrased, it says "a misdemeanor has occurred" — perhaps that's the trigger. But whether that's a condition for arrest without a warrant depends on the specific law. I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: An officer must have probable cause that a felony has occurred and that the arrested person committed it.
Wait, but this option says "feeling has occurred." So for a felony, which is a higher crime, the officer must have probable cause that the felony has occurred and that the person is guilty of it. But for a misdemeanor, I think the law generally doesn't require that. So if the crime is a misdemeanor, the officer might not need to have the felony occurred condition. So if the option B is about a felony, then it's a condition for felony arrest without a warrant, but for misdemeanor, it's not required. So if the option is stating that for a misdemeanor, the officer must have this condition, then that's not an acceptable scenario. Wait, but the option says, "feelon has occurred" — which I think is a typo, probably meant 'misdemeanor'. So, if the option is talking about a misdemeanor, then the condition isn't required for arrest without a warrant. So Option B is a scenario that's not applicable when a misdemeanor is being arrested without a warrant.

Option C: An officer may arrest for a felony committed in his presence.
This seems correct. I remember that in some jurisdictions, an officer can arrest someone for a felony even if they're present, especially if they're on a duty to stay with the arrested person. So, for example, an officer might be at the scene and can't take the person off, but can still arrest for a felony if the felony was committed during that time. So this is a valid situation.

Option D: An officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that is a breach of peace and committed in arresting party's presence.
Hmm. Breach of peace could imply that the person is in a dangerous situation, perhaps being arrested. But I'm not sure if that's a legal basis for arrest without a warrant. Wait, I think that's more about why the person is being arrested in the first place, not whether the officer can arrest them without a warrant. So whether the misdemeanor is a breach of peace doesn't directly affect whether the officer can commit the arrest without a warrant. But perhaps for a misdemeanor, you have to have probable cause that the misdemeanor occurred and the person is guilty. If the misdemeanor is a breach of peace, it's part of a larger situation, but perhaps the officer can still arrest a person in that situation. But I'm not certain if that's a condition for arrest without a warrant. Alternatively, maybe for a misdemeanor, arrest without a warrant isn't allowed unless certain conditions are met.

Wait, going back to Option B. The question is, which is not a possible circumstance for arrest without a warrant. Let's consider each option:

- A: For a misdemeanor, the officer must believe the person is guilty. So if the misdemeanor is a misdemeanor, then if the officer believes the person is guilty, they can arrest without a warrant. So this is a scenario that's possible. So A is a condition, not the answer.

- B: For a misdemeanor, the officer must have probable cause that the felony has occurred and that the person is guilty. But if the crime is a misdemeanor, then the occurrence of a felony isn't a condition for arrest without a warrant. So for a misdemeanor, the officer does not need to have that condition. Therefore, B is a scenario that's not applicable when arresting a misdemeanor without a warrant. So B is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For a misdemeanor, the officer can arrest without a warrant unless the person is in a situation where the crime is considered a misdemeanor. I think the key point is that for a misdemeanor, the person must be believed to be guilty of the misdemeanor. If it's a misdemeanor, then the occurrence of a felony doesn't affect the arrest condition. So B's condition is only applicable to felonies. So if someone is being arrested for a misdemeanor, the condition (feelon occurred) isn't needed. Therefore, B is not a circumstance that allows arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor.

Wait, but if the option is about felony, then B would be a condition. But the option says 'feelon has occurred', which is probably a typo. So if the scenario is a misdemeanor, then B is not a valid condition. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

The correct answer is **B**. 

**Explanation:**
- **Option A** states that an officer must believe the person is guilty of a misdemeanor to be arrested without a warrant. This is a valid scenario, so it is not the correct answer.
- **Option B** claims that an officer must have probable cause that a felony has occurred and the person is guilty of it to arrest for a misdemeanor. However, for a misdemeanor, arrest without a warrant does not require this condition because a misdemeanor is a lower crime level, and the occurrence of a felony is not a requirement. Therefore, this is not a valid situation for arresting a misdemeanor without a warrant, making it the correct answer.
- **Option C** is correct because officers can arrest for a felony even if they are present, as it's a permissible procedure.
- **Option D** is also correct because officers can arrest someone in a situation where the misdemeanor is a breach of peace, as this is part of the arrest process.
- **Option E** is not provided, so it is irrelevant.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**, as it describes a scenario that does not apply to arresting a misdemeanor without a warrant.
