Okay, so I've got this question here about a freight train traveling at a certain speed for a certain amount of time, and I need to figure out how far it travels. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says the train is traveling at 20 miles per hour for 6 hours. Hmm, I remember from school that distance is calculated using the formula: distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, that's d = s * t.

Let me plug in the numbers. The speed is 20 mph, and the time is 6 hours. Multiplying 20 by 6... 20 times 6 is 120. So the distance should be 120 miles. Let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Yeah, 20 mph for 6 hours would be 20 * 6 = 120 miles. That sounds right.

Now, looking at the options provided:

A: 90 miles  
B: 120 miles  
C: 150 miles  
D: 140 miles  
E: 26 miles  
F: 100 miles  
G: 80 miles  
H: 110 miles  
I: 160 miles  
J: 12 miles  

So option B is 120 miles, which matches my calculation. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The formula was applied correctly, and the numbers add up properly. I don't see any other option that makes sense. So the correct answer should be B.

The correct answer is **B: 120 miles**.
