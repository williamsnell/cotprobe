Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a helium-cadmium laser. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think. The question is about how far away the two laser components are separated by 1 cm. Oh right, diffraction-limited performance implies something about the diffraction limit of the laser beam.

The beam is 2 mm in diameter, so the radius is 1 mm, which is 1e-3 meters. The wavelengths are 325 nm and 488 nm, so 325 is 3.25e-7 m, and 488 is 4.88e-7 m. 

Wait, the separation between the two components should come from the diffraction of the laser beam. I remember that the Rayleigh criterion for resolution is about the angular separation. But wait, the question is about the linear separation. So I think the separation d in meters is related to the angular resolution θ (in radians) by d = θ * L, where L is the distance.

So how do I find θ for a diffraction-limited beam? The diffraction limit for a circular aperture (like a laser beam) is given by the formula θ ≈ 1.22 * λ / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. Oh wait, yes, the diffraction-limited angular resolution is approximately θ ≈ 1.22 λ / (2r), where r is the radius. Since the diameter D is 2r, so θ ≈ λ/(D). Wait no, wait. Let me get it right. The formula for the minimum angular separation between two point sources (like the two wavelengths) is θ ≈ 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture.

Wait, in this case, the beam is 2 mm in diameter, so D = 0.002 m. So θ = 1.22 * λ / D. But wait, which λ are we using? Because the question says the two components are separated by 1 cm. So which two wavelengths are responsible for that separation? Oh wait, the separation is due to the diffraction from the same beam. So the separation occurs because the two wavelengths (325 and 488 nm) interfere, and the angular separation between them is θ, leading to a linear separation d = θ * L.

So for each wavelength, the angular separation is θ1 = (1.22 λ1) / D, and θ2 = (1.22 λ2) / D. But since both are in the same beam, the separation between the two wavelengths would be the difference in their angles. So the relative angular separation is θ = |θ1 - θ2| = (1.22 / D) * |λ1 - λ2|.

Wait, because θ1 and θ2 are both proportional to λ, so their difference is (λ2 - λ1) * 1.22 / D. So θ = (1.22 * (λ2 - λ1)) / D.

Wait, let me double-check. So two sources separated by Δλ = λ2 - λ1. The angular separation is θ = (Δλ * 1.22) / D. So the linear separation d is θ * L, so d = (Δλ * 1.22 / D) * L. Solving for L, L = d * D / (Δλ * 1.22).

Wait, but wait, the question is about the separation between the two components, which are at different wavelengths. So the two wavelengths are 325 and 488 nm. So the separation is 488 - 325 = 163 nm. So Δλ = 163e-9 m.

So substituting in the values: L = (1 cm) * (0.002 m) / (163e-9 m * 1.22).

Wait, 1 cm is 0.01 m. So:

L = (0.01 m * 0.002 m) / (163e-9 m * 1.22)

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.01 * 0.002 = 2e-5 m².

Denominator: 163e-9 * 1.22 = approx 163e-9 *1.22 = let's compute 163 * 1.22 = 198.46, so 198.46e-9 m².

So L = (2e-5) / (198.46e-9) = (2e-5) / (1.9846e-7) ≈ (2e-5) / (2e-7) ) = 100 meters? Wait, but wait, let me compute exactly.

2e-5 / 1.9846e-7 = (2 / 1.9846 ) * (1e-5 / 1e-7) ) → 2/1.9846 is about 1.0078, and 1e-5 / 1e-7 is 100. So 1.0078 * 100 ≈ 100.78 meters.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Because the separation d is the product of θ and L. So θ is (Δλ * 1.22) / D.

Wait, but let me re-derive the formula to make sure.

The diffraction angle θ is given by θ ≈ 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture (which is the beam waist, so 2 mm, so D=0.002 m).

Each wavelength causes a diffraction angle θ1 = 1.22 λ1/D and θ2 = 1.22 λ2/D. The relative angle between them is θ = |θ2 - θ1| = 1.22/(D) (λ2 - λ1).

Wait, no, θ2 - θ1 = (1.22/ D)(λ2 - λ1). So the angular separation is delta_theta = (1.22 * (lambda2 - lambda1)) / D.

So delta_theta = (1.22 * 163e-9) / 0.002.

Compute that: 1.22 *163= 198.46, so 198.46e-9 /0.002 = (198.46e-9) / (2e-3) )= 99.23e-6 radians.

Wait 198.46e-9 / 2e-3 = 198.46e-9 / 0.002 = (198.46 / 0.002) * 1e-9.

Wait 198.46 / 2e-3 is (198.46 / 2) *1e3 = 99.23e3 → 99230. Multiply by 1e-9: 99230e-9 = 0.009923 radians.

Wait, wait, 198.46e-9 / 0.002 is 198.46e-9 / 2e-3 = (198.46 / 2) * 1e-6. 198.46/2 is 99.23 → 99.23e-6 → 0.00009923 radians. So delta_theta is about 9.923e-5 radians.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, because 1.22 *163e-9 is about 0.000200366 meters. Divided by 0.002 meters (D=2mm) gives 0.000200366 / 0.002 = 0.100183 radians.

Wait, that makes more sense. So 0.100183 radians is the angular separation.

So d = theta * L → L = d / theta.

d is 0.01 m (1 cm) in this case.

So L = (0.01 m) / (0.100183 rad ) ≈ 0.0998 meters, which is about 100 meters.

Hmm, which would match the earlier calculation. So the answer is approximately 100 meters. Looking at the options, option A is 100 m, and option E is 50 m, etc.

Wait wait, but wait, wait. I'm getting 100 meters, but let me double-check.

Wait, our formula for theta: theta = (Δλ * 1.22 ) / D.

Wait, D is the diameter, so 0.002 m. So:

theta = ( (488e-9 m - 325e-9 m) * 1.22 ) / 0.002 m.

Compute 488-325=163e-9. Multiply by 1.22 → 163e-9 *1.22 = 198.46e-9 m.

So theta = 198.46e-9 / 0.002 = (198.46e-9) / (2e-3) )= 99.23e-6 radians.

Wait, 99.23e-6 is 0.00009923 radians.

So then L = d / theta = 0.01 / 0.00009923 ≈ 100.78 meters.

So approximately 100.8 meters. Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 100 m, or option E:50 m. Oh wait, wait. Wait, 100 meters is 10^2 meters, but the options are in the hundreds. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in units.

Wait no, the separation is 1 cm, which is 0.01 meters. The calculation gives L ≈ 100.78 meters, which is 100.8 meters. Wait, but the options given are A is 100 m, which is about right.

So the correct answer should be A:100 m. But wait, looking again at the options, let me check.

Wait, the options are:

A:100 m

B:50 m

C:120 m

D:150 m

E:75 m

F:250 m

G:200 m

H:300 m

I:75 m

J:500 m

So the answer should be A)100 m.

But wait, wait another thing. Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Because the formula for diffraction is theta ≈ (lambda * 1.22) / D.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the diffraction formula as theta = (lambda * m) / D, where m is the diffraction order, but I don't think that matters here because we're considering the first-order diffraction. So the formula is correct.

Alternatively, another approach: the angular resolution (theta) is given by (1.22 * lambda) / D.

So for each wavelength, the diffraction angle is theta1 = (1.22 * lambda1)/D, theta2 = (1.22 * lambda2)/D.

So the angle between them is theta = |theta2 - theta1| = (1.22/D)(lambda2 - lambda1).

So d = theta * L → L = d / theta.

Which is L = d * D / (lambda2 - lambda1) * 1.22.

Wait, substituting values:

d = 0.01 m (1 cm)

D =0.002 m.

lambda2 - lambda1 = 163e-9 m.

So L = (0.01 * 0.002) / (163e-9 * 1.22)

Compute numerator: 0.00002 m².

Denominator: 163e-9 * 1.22 = 198.46e-9 m².

So L = (2e-5) / (1.9846e-7) = (2e-5) / (1.9846e-7) = 2e-5 / 1.9846e-7 = (2 /1.9846) * (1e-5 /1e-7) )

2 /1.9846 ≈ 1.0078,

1e-5 /1e-7 = 100.

So 1.0078 * 100 = 100.78 meters.

So approximately 101 meters.

Looking at the options, the nearest is A) 100 m. But wait, why is the answer not option A? But let's see the options again.

Wait, the options I have are:

A:100 m 

B:50 m

C:120 m

D:150 m

E:75 m

F:250 m

G:200 m

H:300 m

I:75 m

J:500 m

So the correct answer is approximately 100.78 meters, which is closest to 100 m.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Another approach: the diffraction limit is given by theta ≈ 1.22 lambda / D.

So 1.22 * (163e-9 m) / (0.002 m) = (1.22 * 163e-9) / 0.002 = ( (163 * 1.22) )e-9 / 0.002.

163 *1.22= 198.46.

So 198.46e-9 / 0.002 = 99230e-6 → 0.09923 radians.

So theta is 0.09923 rad.

Then L = d / theta → d is 0.01 m.

So L= 0.01 / 0.09923 → approximately 0.1008 m, which is 10.08 cm. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, wait, no, I must have made a mistake in the units.

Wait, no: theta is 0.09923 radians. So 0.09923 rad is approximately theta.

So L = d / theta → d is 0.01 m.

So L≈ 0.01 / 0.09923 → ≈0.1008 m, which is 10.08 centimeters. That can't be right because the separation is 1 cm. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. Oh! Because I think I messed up the formula. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. The diffraction angle theta is given by theta = (lambda * m) / D, where m is the order of diffraction. For the first diffraction maximum, m=1.

Wait, but if the beam is circular, then the first diffraction maximum is at theta where sin(theta) ≈ mλ/D. So another way: theta = (lambda) / (D). Wait, but no, that's not the case. The exact formula for the diffraction minimum is given by mλ = D sin(theta), but for small angles, sin(theta) ≈ tan(theta) ≈ theta. So theta ≈ m lambda / D.

Wait, but for the first minimum, m=1, so theta = lambda/D.

Wait, but for the first maximum, it's at m=1, so theta = (1.22 lambda)/D (as per the Rayleigh criterion). Oh, wait, no: actually, the Rayleigh criterion is based on the first minimum. So the angular separation between two wavelengths would correspond to the first minimum, which is at theta = lambda/(2D) for the first minimum. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is theta ≈ 1.22 lambda / D. So theta is approximately 1.22 times the wavelength divided by the beam width.

So for each wavelength, the diffraction angle is theta1= (1.22 * lambda1)/(D), theta2=(1.22 * lambda2)/(D).

The separation delta_theta= theta2 - theta1= (1.22/D)(lambda2 - lambda1).

So delta_theta= (1.22 * 163e-9 m) / (0.002 m) → (198.46e-9) / 0.002 → 99.23e-6 radians.

So delta_theta= 0.00009923 radians.

So the separation d= 0.01 m.

So L = d / delta_theta → 0.01 / 0.00009923 ≈ 100.8 meters.

Ah, so the correct answer is approximately 100.8 meters, which is closest to 100 meters (option A).

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe I mixed up the formula. But now, the calculation seems correct.

To determine the distance at which the two components of the helium-cadmium laser are separated by 1 cm, we use the diffraction-limited angular resolution formula:

\[
\theta \approx 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}
\]

where:
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength difference (\( \lambda_2 - \lambda_1 \)),
- \( D \) is the beam diameter (2 mm = 0.002 m),
- \( \theta \) is the angular separation.

The separation in linear distance is given by:

\[
d = \theta \cdot L
\]

Rearranging for \( L \):

\[
L = \frac{d}{\theta}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the angular separation
The wavelengths are \( \lambda_1 = 325 \, \text{nm} = 3.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \) and \( \lambda_2 = 488 \, \text{nm} = 4.88 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). The wavelength difference is:

\[
\Delta \lambda = \lambda_2 - \lambda_1 = 488 \times 10^{-9} - 325 \times 10^{-9} = 163 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}
\]

Using the diffraction formula for the angular separation:

\[
\theta = \frac{1.22 \cdot \Delta \lambda}{D} = \frac{1.22 \cdot 163 \times 10^{-9}}{0.002}
\]

First, calculate \( 1.22 \cdot 163 \):

\[
1.22 \cdot 163 = 198.46
\]

Now, calculate \( \theta \):

\[
\theta = \frac{198.46 \times 10^{-9}}{0.002} = 99.23 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{radians}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance \( L \)
The linear separation \( d \) is given as 1 cm = 0.01 m. Using \( L = \frac{d}{\theta} \):

\[
L = \frac{0.01}{99.23 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{0.01}{0.00009923} \approx 100.8 \, \text{meters}
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The calculated distance \( L \approx 100.8 \, \text{meters} \) is closest to option **A: 100 m**.
