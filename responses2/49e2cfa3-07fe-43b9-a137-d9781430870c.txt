Okay, so I've got this question about water pipes freezing, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question says we need to calculate the minimum depth where water pipes should be positioned below ground to avoid freezing. The geographical area has a mean winter temperature of 7°C, but the ambient air suddenly drops to -8°C and stays there for 60 hours. 

Hmm, I remember that freezing in pipes is related to the freezing point depression of water. The idea is that if the surrounding temperature is lower than the pipe's freezing point, the water might freeze inside. But wait, the pipe's freezing point is based on the ambient temperature. So when the ambient temperature drops, the pipe's freezing point also drops. 

The formula I think is Q = (L) * (ΔT) * (time), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I recall that the time factor is involved in calculating the depth. The formula I've heard is D = (Q) / (L * T), but maybe it's D = (Q * t) / (L * ΔT). Or another version: D equals (Q * t) divided by (L multiplied by the temperature difference). 

Wait, another approach: The minimum depth required is given by the formula D = (Q * t) / (L * ΔT), where Q is the heat loss, t is time, L is the length of the pipe, and ΔT is the temperature difference. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Another way I remember it is that the depth depends on the time it takes for heat to flow from the pipe into the surrounding air. 

The temperature difference is ΔT. When the ambient drops from 7°C to -8°C, the change is 15°C. So ΔT is 15°C. 

The time given is 60 hours. I think the formula for the depth is D = (Q * t) / (L * ΔT), but Q here is the heat loss. Alternatively, another formula I've seen is D = (t * L * ΔT) / (h * A), but I'm getting a bit tangled here. 

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the depth is D = ( L * t * ΔT ) / ( h * A ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I think the formula is D = (L * ΔT * t) / (k * A * ΔT), but I'm not getting it right. Maybe I should think about the heat loss through conduction. 

Wait, another approach: the depth required is based on the heat loss from the pipe into the surrounding air. The formula for the depth is D = (L * ΔT * t) / (h * A), but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the depth is (L * ΔT * t) divided by (h * A * ΔT), which simplifies to (L * t) / h. Wait, that can't be right because h is the convection coefficient, which I don't have here. 

Wait, perhaps I should look for a standard formula for freezing pipe depth. I recall that the formula for the depth of the freezing layer is D = (Q * t) / (L * ΔT), but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think: the depth depends on how quickly the heat from the pipe propagates into the ground. So the time factor is involved. 

Alternatively, the depth of the freezing layer (D) can be calculated using the formula D = (L * ΔT * t) / (s * A), where s is the thermal conductivity and A is the area. Wait, perhaps it's better to find a standard formula. 

I found that the depth of the freezing layer can be determined using the formula:

D = (Q * t) / (L * ΔT)

Wait, but Q is the heat loss rate. But I don't have Q. Wait, perhaps another approach: the heat loss over the time t is Q = (h * A * ΔT) / (1 - exp(-t/τ)), but that's for convection. Alternatively, for ground freezing, the depth is given by D = (Q * t) / (L * ΔT), where Q is the heat loss. 

Wait, another formula I've seen is D = (L * ΔT * t) / (h * A), but when I don't have h—the convection coefficient—it's hard to compute. So perhaps I'm mixing up different formulas. 

Alternatively, the depth can be found using the formula D = (L * ΔT * t) / (k * (L * ΔT) / (ΔT)), but this seems off. 

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the formula I've heard before. Oh, wait! The depth of the freezing layer due to conduction is given by D = (L * ΔT * t) / (k * A), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is to consider the heat flow. 

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is D = (L * ΔT * t) / (k * A), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I think the depth is given by D = (L * ΔT * t) / (k * (L * T)), but that doesn't seem right. 

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up with the time factor. Let's think of the time it takes for heat to transfer from the pipe to the ground. The time factor is given by t = (L * ΔT) / (k * A * h), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the time factor for the depth is (L * ΔT) / (k * A * h), but I'm not sure. 

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is D = (L * ΔT * t) / (h * A), but without h, this isn't directly helpful. Alternatively, if we're assuming that the heat transfer is via conduction, the formula for the time is t = (L * ΔT) / (k * A * h), but again, without h, I'm stuck. 

Wait, perhaps the key is to remember that the depth is D = (Q * t) / (L * ΔT), but without Q, which is the heat loss rate, this is problematic. Unless I can find Q in another way. 

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the freezing depth is D = (L * ΔT * t) / (k * A * h), but again, without values for k, A, and h, I can't calculate it. Hmm. 

Wait, but in this problem, perhaps the freezing depth is determined using the formula D = (t * L * ΔT) / (h * A), but without h, I'm stuck. 

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is D = (L * ΔT * t) / (k * (L * ΔT)), which would simplify to D = t / k. But I don't have k. 

Wait, maybe the correct formula is D = (Q * t) / (L * ΔT), but without knowing Q, I can't proceed. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the time factor.

Wait, another approach: I think the formula for the depth is D = (t * L * ΔT) / (k * A). But without knowing k, that's again a problem. 

Wait, perhaps the formula is D = (L * ΔT * t) / (h * A), but without h, I'm stuck. 

At this point, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the typical values of these parameters. 

The mean winter temp is 7°C, and the ambient drops to -8°C, so ΔT is 15°C. The time is 60 hours. Let's think about the units. Well, 60 hours is 2.5 days. 

The formula for freezing depth (D) is given by D = (Q * t) / (L * ΔT), where Q is the heat loss. But without knowing Q, perhaps I should think of the freezing depth in terms of the time it takes for heat to flow. 

Wait, another formula I remember is D = (L * ΔT * t) / (k * A * h), but again, without k and h, this isn't possible. Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps another approach: the depth of the freezing layer is calculated using the formula D = (L * ΔT * t) / (h * A), but without h, I can't compute. Alternatively, perhaps the time is related to the time constant of the system, but again, without k, this isn't helpful.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the time factor for freezing, which is the time it takes for the heat to transfer from the pipe to the surrounding air. The time factor is t = (L * ΔT) / (k * A * h), but without knowing k and h, I can't compute t. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a simplified formula, such as D = (L * ΔT * t) / (h * A), but again, without h, this is impossible. 

An alternative approach is to think about the heat loss through conduction. The heat loss Q from the pipe to the ground is given by Fourier's law: Q = (k * A * ΔT * L) / t, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Wait, no, Fourier's law is Q = (k * A * ΔT * L) / t, where t is the time. So Q is the heat loss over time t. 

Wait, but let's consider D = L * (ΔT) * t / (h * A), but since I don't have h, perhaps I can relate h and k. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is D = (Q * t) / (L * ΔT), since Q is the heat loss, which is (k*A*ΔT*L)/t. So substituting Q into the formula for D:

D = ( (k*A*ΔT*L/t) * t ) / (L*ΔT) ) 

Simplifying: 

D = (k*A*ΔT*L) / (L*ΔT) ) 

Which simplifies to D = k * A. But without knowing k or A, I can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is simplifying this. Maybe the formula is D = (L * ΔT * t) / (k * A), but without k, I can't compute it. 

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should refer to the options given. Let's see the options:

A: 27.9 cm
B: 30.5 cm
C: 25.4 cm
D: 20.3 cm
E: 12.7 cm
F: 22.5 cm
G: 17.8 cm
H: 35.6 cm
I: 10.2 cm
J: 15.2 cm

I think the typical freezing depth is around 20-30 cm. So option B is 30.5 cm, which is a possibility.

Wait, but let's think again. The formula I recall is D = (L * ΔT * t) / (h * A). 

Wait, another thought: The formula for the depth of freezing where the temperature drops below the freezing point of water (0°C) is D = (L * ΔT * t) / (h * A). But without h and A, perhaps I can express A in terms of area. Alternatively, perhaps I can use A as the contact area between pipe and ground, but I don't have that data. 

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is D = ( t * L * ΔT ) / (k * A ), but again, without the values for k, A, and h, this is not helpful.

Wait, but here's another approach. The freezing depth D is given by D = ( t * L * ΔT ) / (k * A ). But unless I know k, A, or h, it's impossible. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a simplified version, where D = (L * ΔT ) * (t) / (h * A). But without the values, I can't compute it. 

Wait, perhaps I should think about the time factor. The time factor is the ratio of the time to the time constant of the system. The time constant τ is (L * k) / (h * A). So τ = (L * k) / (h * A). 

Then, the time factor is t / τ = (h * A * t) / (L * k).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the time to reach freezing is when the time factor is equal to the time constant. So t equals τ. 

Wait, but without knowing k, h, and A, this is difficult. 

Hmm. Maybe I should think of the problem differently. The key parameters are the pipe's freezing point, which depends on the ambient temperature. The pipe is at 7°C, and then the ambient drops to -8°C. So the pipe's freezing point drops from 7°C to -8°C - 0°C (since water freezes at 0°C). So the freezing point of the pipe now is -8°C.

Wait, no. Wait, water freezes at 0°C. So the pipe's freezing point is based on the ambient temperature. So when the ambient drops below 0°C, the pipe's freezing point comes into play. So the pipe is now at -8°C (0°C minus 8°C), so the pipe's freezing point is -8°C. But the pipe is submerged in the ground at a lower temperature, so perhaps it will freeze.

Wait, but the question is about the depth at which the pipes can be installed so that they don't freeze. So perhaps the freezing depth is the distance from the surface where the pipe is installed, so that the pipe's temperature doesn't drop below the freezing point of water (0°C) in that region. 

Wait, no. The pipe is installed at a certain depth. The surrounding air is at -8°C, so when the pipe is installed at depth D below ground, the temperature of the pipe's surface is (ground temperature) + D * (thermal expansion coefficient). But assuming the pipe is installed at a temperature that is high enough, but perhaps if the pipe is installed at a depth where the ground temperature plus the pipe's expansion due to freezing is below the freezing point. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Wait, perhaps the freezing depth is determined by the heat lost from the pipe into the ground. The formula I think is D = (Q * t) / (L * ΔT), but without knowing Q, unless I can express Q in terms of other variables.

Wait, but perhaps the correct formula for the depth is D = ( Q * t ) / (L * ΔT ), where Q is the heat loss. But I don't know Q. Alternatively, I think the formula for the freezing depth is D = (L * ΔT * t) / (h * A), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought. The time it takes for the freezing to occur is related to the heat loss. So perhaps the time factor is t = (L * ΔT) / (k * A * h), but without knowing k, A, or h, I can't compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps the time factor is t = (L * ΔT) / (k * A * h). So the time it takes for the heat to transfer is (L * ΔT) / (k * A * h). 

But again, without knowing any of these, perhaps I'm stuck. 

Wait, perhaps the way to proceed is to use a standard formula. I remember that the freezing depth is approximately D = (L * ΔT * t) / (h * A), but I don't have the values. 

Wait, but perhaps the formula is D = (L * ΔT * t) / (k * A), but again, without k, it's not helpful. 

Wait, perhaps the formula is D = (L * ΔT) * (t) / (k * A). But without the thermal conductivity (k) or the area (A), this can't be computed. 

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options. The options are all in the range of 10-35 cm. 

Wait, perhaps I should think about the time factor. The time factor is t = (L * ΔT) / (k * A * h), and the freezing depth D is L * (ΔT) * t / (h * A). So substituting t, we get D = L * ΔT * (L * ΔT) / (k * A * h) ) / (h * A) )? No, that doesn't seem right. 

Alternatively, since I'm stuck, perhaps I should think of the problem as using the formula D = (L * ΔT * t) / (k * A), but without the variables, perhaps the answer is 20-30 cm. Looking at the options, B is 30.5 cm, which is a possible answer.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is D = (L * ΔT * t) / (k * A * h), but without the values, this is a dead end. 

Wait, perhaps the freezing depth is calculated using the formula D = (h * A * t) / (k * L * ΔT), but again, without h and k, can't compute. 

Hmm, perhaps I should look up the correct formula, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is around 20-30 cm. Looking at the options, option B is 30.5 cm. So I'll go with B.

To calculate the minimum depth at which water pipes must be positioned below ground to avoid freezing, we consider the freezing point depression of water and the heat transfer dynamics. The key parameters are:

1. **Mean winter temperature**: \( T_{\text{winter}} = 7^\circ \text{C} \)
2. **Ambient air temperature**: \( T_{\text{ambient}} = -8^\circ \text{C} \)
3. **Temperature difference**: \( \Delta T = T_{\text{ambient}} - T_{\text{winter}} = 15^\circ \text{C} \)
4. **Time**: \( t = 60 \, \text{hours} = 2.5 \, \text{days} \)

The freezing depth \( D \) is influenced by the heat transfer from the pipe to the surrounding air. The formula for freezing depth is:

\[
D = \frac{L \cdot \Delta T \cdot t}{k \cdot A \cdot h}
\]

However, without the values for thermal conductivity \( k \), surface area \( A \), and convection coefficient \( h \), the exact calculation cannot be performed. Instead, the problem likely relies on standard assumptions or approximations. The options provided suggest a depth in the range of 10–35 cm. Based on typical values for freezing depth in such scenarios, **30.5 cm** (option B) is the most plausible answer.
