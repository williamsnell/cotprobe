Okay, so I've got this logic question to work through. Let me read it again.

The question is asking me to translate the statement "Marco moves from Italy to Spain" into predicate logic. The options are A through F, each with different structures. The given predicate is Mxyz, which I think stands for "x moves to y from z." So x is the origin, y is the destination, and z is where x moves from.

Let me break down the statement. Marco is moving, so that's m. He's moving from Italy, so that's i. He's moving to Spain, which is s. So the origin is Italy, destination is Spain.

In predicate logic, the structure would be something like Mxz(y), but wait, let me think about how the variables are used. Mxyz would mean x moves to y from z. So for this case, x is Marco (m), y is Spain (s), and z is Italy (i). So substituting, it should be Mm i (s). Wait, no, let me correct that.

Wait, Mxyz is x moves to y from z. So for Marco moving from Italy to Spain, x is Marco (m), y is Spain (s), and z is Italy (i). So the predicate would be Mm s i. Looking at the options, that's option E, Mmsi.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not getting the order wrong. Mxyz: x moves to y from z. So the structure is x (origin) → y (destination) via z. So in this case, Marco is moving to Spain from Italy. So Mxyz would be M m s i. So yes, that's Mmsi, which is option E.

Wait, but sometimes the order might be different. Another way to think about it is: x moves from z to y. So for Marco moving from Italy to Spain, it's from z=Italy to y=Spain via x=Marco. So Mxyz would be M x z y, so M m i s. So that's M mis. Wait, no, that can't be right because the options don't have M mis. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: Mism

B: Mssi

C: Msim

D: Mmis

E: Mmsi

F: Mims

Wait, M mis is M m i s? No, wait, M mis would be M m i s, which would be "Marco moves from Italy to Spain." So M mis is M m (origin) i (z) s (destination). So M mis is M mis. Looking at the options, option D is M mis. Wait, but earlier I thought option E, Mmsi, is the correct one.

Wait, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The correct structure is x moves from z to y. So Mxyz is x from z to y. So for Marco, x=m; z=i; y=s.

So Mxyz would be M m i s. So M mis is correct. But looking at the options, option D is M mis.

Wait, but the options are A: Mism, B: Mssi, C: Msim, D: Mmis, E: Mmsi, F: Mims.

Wait, so M mis is D. But earlier I thought Mmsi is E. Which is correct?

Wait, another way: Mxyz is x moves to y from z. So Mxyz is x as origin, y as destination, and z as source. So for "Marco moves from Italy to Spain", the origin is z=Italy, destination is y=Spain, origin is x=Marco. So the predicate would be M m i s.

Wait, the options:

A: Mism → M m i s → M m i s → E is M m i s?

Wait, no. Option E is Mmsi. So M m i s would be M mis, which is D, and M m i s is E.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the order. Let's look at the options again.

M mis is D. M m i s is E. So M mis is the correct structure.

But wait, the correct translation should be " Marco moves from Italy to Spain," so the origin is Italy, destination is Spain. So in Mxyz, x is Marco, z is Italy, y is Spain. So Mxyz is M m i s.

So the correct predicate is M mis, which is option D. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's E. So I'm getting conflicting thoughts.

Wait, let's clarify. The predicate is Mxyz, meaning x moves to y from z. So for Marco moving from Italy to Spain, x=m, y=s, z=i.

So Mxyz would be M m i s. Which is M mis. So the correct option is D: M mis.

Wait, but another way: when you see "x moves from z to y," it's equivalent to Mxyz. So M m i s is the same as M mis, which is option D.

So the correct answer should be D: M mis.

The correct answer is D: M mis.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the components of the statement**: Marco (m) moves from Italy (i) to Spain (s).

2. **Use the predicate structure**: Mxyz represents "x moves to y from z."

3. **Substitute the variables**: x = Marco, y = Spain, z = Italy.

4. **Formulate the predicate**: M m i s, which is "M Marco from Italy to Spain."

5. **Match with options**: Option D is M mis, matching the substitution.
