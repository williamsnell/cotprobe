Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about linkage disequilibrium. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, what do I remember about linkage disequilibrium (LD)? I think LD refers to the non-random association of alleles at different loci in a given population. So, it's when certain alleles are more likely to be inherited together than would be expected by chance. If that's right, then factors that promote this non-random association would affect LD.

The question is asking which factor does NOT promote LD. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's look at each one.

Option A: Asexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction is about reproduction without gamete formation, like in some bacteria or fungi. I'm not sure how this directly affects LD. But wait, if a population reproduces a lot without crossing over, maybe there's less recombination, which is a factor in LD. So a lack of recombination would reduce LD. Asexual reproduction might not be the main source of recombination, so this could promote or not promote LD. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Option B: Coadapted gene complexes. Coadaptation happens when two or more genes have developed a close interaction, so one affects the development of the other. This can lead to more linkage disequilibrium because the alleles interact, making them more likely to be inherited together. So this factor promotes LD.

Option C: Epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene depends on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes.' For example, one gene might mask the effect of another. I think epistasis can lead to higher levels of LD because it increases the recombination between loci. So, epistasis promotes LD.

Option D: Random mating. Random mating is when parents mate randomly, which is the basis for genetic equilibrium in many cases. But wait, if the mating is random, that would mean that alleles assort independently. In that case, the alleles at different loci wouldn't tend to be inherited together, so LD would decrease. So LD is the opposite of random mating. But does random mating promote LD? I think no, because random mating leads to no LD. So if the question is which factor does NOT promote LD, then random mating would be the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another thought. LD is when they are not randomly inherited, so if the population is in random mating (option D), then LD would be zero. So option D would not promote LD.

So the question is which factor does NOT promote LD. So the factors that promote LD are B, C, and A (maybe?), and the one that does not is D.

Wait, let me double-check about option A. Asexual reproduction is about no crossing over. In a population reproducing asexually, there's less recombination between loci. So if recombination is reduced, LD would decrease. So factors that promote LD would include things like non-random mating, but asexual reproduction doesn't involve recombination. So the question is, which factor doesn't promote LD.

Wait, the question says which factor does NOT promote LD. So the correct answer is D, random mating, because that leads to no LD. So the options are: A, B, C, D. The one that does not promote LD is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me think again. LD is more about the association between alleles at different loci. If you have a population that is randomly mating, then the alleles are assorting independently, so LD is low. So option D doesn't promote LD.

So the answer would be D: Random mating.

To determine which factor does NOT promote linkage disequilibrium (LD), we analyze each option:

- **Option A: Asexual reproduction**  
  Asexual reproduction involves reproduction without gamete formation, such as in bacteria or fungi. This reduces recombination between loci, as recombination is a key factor in LD. Without recombination, LD decreases. Thus, asexual reproduction does not promote LD.

- **Option B: Coadapted gene complexes**  
  Coadaptation occurs when gene complexes evolve in close proximity, influencing the interaction of alleles. This can lead to higher LD because alleles interact, increasing their tendency to be inherited together. Therefore, this factor promotes LD.

- **Option C: Epistasis**  
  Epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene depends on the presence of another. This can increase LD by increasing recombination between loci, so it promotes LD.

- **Option D: Random mating**  
  Random mating leads to the independent assortment of alleles, resulting in no LD because alleles assort randomly. Thus, random mating does not promote LD.

The factor that does NOT promote LD is **random mating**.
