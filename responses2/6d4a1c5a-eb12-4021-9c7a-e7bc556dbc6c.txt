Question:

A buyer expressed interest in purchasing an industrial air-conditioning system manufactured by the seller. The parties agreed orally on a price of $100,000 for the system, but continued to negotiate over several points. When all matters regarding the air-conditioning system were finally settled, the parties signed a written agreement. It provided that the price for the system, which would be delivered on June 1, would be $110,000. The written agreement, a lengthy form contract, did not contain a merger clause. The seller delivered the system on June 1, but the buyer refused to pay more than $100,000, citing the earlier oral agreement as to price. The seller sued the buyer for the additional $10,000 under the written agreement. Is the court likely to admit the evidence of the orally agreed price of $100,000?

Options:

A: Yes, because the oral price term is relevant to whether the writing should be reformed.
B: No, because the oral price term would contradict an express term in the written agreement.
C: Yes, because the buyer can refuse to pay more than the orally agreed price.
D: Yes, because the oral agreement is considered more binding than the written agreement.
E: Yes, because the seller cannot increase the price without the buyer's consent.
F: Yes, because the written agreement did not contain a merger clause.
G: No, because the court does not consider oral agreements.
H: No, because the buyer assumed the risk of any mistake as to price.
I: No, because the written agreement takes precedence over the oral agreement.
J: No, because the seller has the right to increase the price in the written agreement.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the court would admit the evidence of the orally agreed price of $100,000 in this case. Let me break down the situation.

The buyer and seller were considering purchasing an industrial AC system. They orally agreed on a price of $100,000. Then they went into a lengthy contract, but it didn't have a merger clause. The written agreement later said the price would be $110,000, delivered on June 1. The buyer refused to pay more than $100,000, citing the oral agreement as the price. The seller then sued for the extra $10k.

The question is about whether the court would admit the oral price of $100k. The options are A to J. I need to determine which option is correct.

First, what's the rule about oral agreements and written contracts? I remember that there are different precedents. If the parties orally agreed on a price, does that make it binding? I think there's a concept called "merger clause consideration." If the contract says a price will be set, does the oral term take precedence?

Wait, in some cases, an oral agreement is more binding than a written one. For example, if the contract says the price will be set in writing, but the parties had an oral agreement, the written may not take effect. But in this case, the written contract later says the price is $110k. So the written agreement is against the seller's initial oral agreement. But the buyer refused to pay more than the oral price.

Wait, but the written contract was later entered. So the written agreement was for $110k, but the buyer agreed to $100k. So the buyer's price is lower. The seller is suing for the extra $10k.

But what's the main issue here? The court is asking whether the court will admit the oral price. So the question is about the validity of the oral price in evidence. Let's think about how evidence is treated in cases where there are conflicting terms.

There's a case called the "merger clause issue." If a contract specifies a price, does that make it enforceable? Or does the prior oral agreement have a stronger impact? I think that if the contract says a price will be set, but the parties had a prior agreement, the prior one is more binding. But wait, the written contract comes after, so if the contract was for $110k, but the buyer is demanding $100k. Wait, the buyer's price was $100k, which was the oral agreement. So the written contract is for $110k, which is higher than the buyer's claim.

But the problem is about the evidence of the oral price. So the buyer is using the written contract's terms as evidence. Or does the written contract's price take precedence?

In such cases, the written contract's price is usually binding unless there's a merger clause. Merger clauses allow for the consideration of oral agreements, but if the contract later specifies a price, the written might supersede it. Wait, but the written contract here is for $110k, while the buyer only paid $100k. The written contract states that the price will be $110k, but the buyer paid less, so the seller is seeking extra.

Wait, but the buyer is using the written agreement's terms as evidence. So the question is, would the court admit the $100k price as evidence? Or does the written agreement being for $110k make it non-binding for the buyer's payment.

I think the key point is whether the written contract's price is enforceable. If the contract says a price will be set in writing, then the written agreement is binding. But if the buyer is paying more than the written price, that might be an issue.

Wait, but the written contract says the price will be $110k. So under standard precedents, if a contract says a price will be set, the written contract's terms take effect. So the buyer should have paid $110k. But in this case, the buyer only paid $100k. So the seller is seeking $10k extra.

But the question is about the evidence. The seller's evidence is the written agreement's price of $110k. The buyer's payment is $100k, which is less than the written price. So the seller is trying to enforce the written contract's terms.

Wait, but the written contract is for $110k. The buyer paid $100k, so the seller is seeking $10k extra. But the written agreement was for $110k, so the seller's evidence is the $110k, not the $100k. So the buyer's payment is less than what the contract said, which could be a breach.

But the question isn't about whether the agreement is valid, but about whether the evidence of the oral price is admitted. So the court's question is: does the written contract's $110k price take effect, or is the oral price, $100k, admissible as evidence?

Another angle: if the contract says the price will be set in writing, then the written contract's terms are enforceable. But if the contract later says a price, and the buyer pays less, that's a breach.

Wait, but the written contract says the price will be $110k, but the buyer paid $100k. The seller is suing for the extra $10k. So the buyer is correct in their payment, but the written contract is for a different price.

The issue here is about the admissibility of the oral price as evidence. So when a written contract is signed, does the written price take precedence over the oral terms?

Alternatively, the written contract is for $110k, but the buyer only paid $100k. The seller's contract is for $110k, but the buyer only pays $100k. So the seller is seeking $10k extra. But the written contract is for $110k, so the buyer should have paid that. But the buyer is paying less. So the seller has a valid claim.

But the question is about whether the court will admit the evidence of the oral price. So the written contract is for $110k, but the buyer's payment is $100k. So the seller is suing for the $10k difference.

The issue is whether the written contract's $110k is considered evidence to be admissible. So the buyer is using the written price as the basis for their payment, which is incorrect because the contract says the price is $110k, but the buyer paid $100k.

Wait, but the buyer's payment is $100k, which is less than what the contract says. So the seller is seeking $10k. The written contract's price is $110k. So the seller is trying to enforce the written contract's terms.

But the question is about the admissibility of the oral price as evidence. So if the written contract is for $110k, but the buyer is paying $100k, which is less, that's a breach, but the issue is the evidence of the written price, not the buyer's payment.

Wait, the buyer's payment is $100k, which is less than the written price. So the seller is seeking $10k extra. But the written contract's price is $110k, so the buyer should have paid that. But the buyer did pay less. So the seller is correct in seeking the extra money.

But the question isn't about whether the contract is valid, but whether the written price is admitted as evidence. So the written contract's price is $110k, which would be admissible as evidence. But the buyer is paying $100k, so the seller is seeking $10k. But the seller is suing the buyer, not the seller. So the seller's evidence is the written price.

But the issue is about the admissibility of the oral price. So the written contract's price of $110k is evidence, but the buyer's $100k is not. So the court would admit the written contract's price as evidence (so option A is correct), because it's written and thus binding. Or maybe the buyer's own agreement doesn't matter; the written contract's price is the enforceable one.

Wait, but the question is about whether the court will admit the evidence of the orally agreed price. So, the buyer's own oral agreement is not the issue here; the written contract's price is the enforceable one.

Wait, no. The written contract's price is $110k, which is the enforceable one, so the buyer is paying $100k, which is less. So the seller is seeking $10k.

But the question is whether the court will admit the evidence of the oral price as $100k. So the written contract's price is $110k, which would be admissible as evidence. So the court would likely admit that price as evidence, so option A would be correct.

Wait, but the written contract was for $110k, so the buyer is paying less, which might be a breach. But the question is about the evidence of the orally agreed price. The written contract's price is $110k, which is an enforceable price. So the court would admit the written agreement's price as evidence, so answer A.

Alternatively, maybe the written contract's price isn't binding because it didn't contain a merger clause. Wait, no, the written contract did contain a merger clause. Wait, no, the written contract did not contain a merger clause. The merger clause is about whether the contract is subject to merger.

Wait, the written contract doesn't have a merger clause. So, the written contract is a standard contract, which would be enforceable. So the written price is binding, and the buyer is paying less, which is a breach.

But the question is about whether the court will admit the evidence of the oral price. So the written contract's price is $110k, so the court would accept that as evidence, so option A is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The parties orally agreed on a price of $100k. Then they signed a written contract for $110k. The buyer, knowing the oral agreement, pays the written price. But the buyer tried to claim the oral price as evidence.

The court's question is whether the evidence of the oral price would be admitted. So, the written contract's price is $110k, which is binding. So the court would likely admit that. So answer A: Yes, because the oral price term is relevant.

Wait, but another angle: if the contract says the price will be set in writing, but the buyer's payment is less than the written price, that's a breach. But the question isn't about the contract's validity, but about the admissibility of the oral price as evidence.

So if the written contract's price is $110k, then the buyer's payment of $100k is incorrect, and the seller is seeking $10k extra. But the seller's claim is based on the written contract's terms, so the court would likely admit the written price as evidence.

Wait, but the written contract's terms take precedence because it's written. So the written price is the enforceable one. So the buyer's payment is wrong, but the seller is suing for the extra money, so the court would admit the written price as evidence. So option A is correct.

The question revolves around whether the court will admit the evidence of the orally agreed $100,000 price as part of the written contract. The key issue is the enforceability of the written contract's price and its relevance to the oral agreement.

1. **Understanding the Contract Terms**: The oral agreement specifies a price of $100,000, while the written contract later states the price will be $110,000. The written contract does not include a merger clause, which is relevant because merger clauses typically require the parties to agree to a price in writing if they later disagree.

2. **Relevance of the Oral Agreement**: The oral agreement is stronger because it is a prior agreement that explicitly states the price. While the written contract sets the price, the oral agreement typically supersedes the written contract in terms of enforceability unless a merger clause explicitly allows for a price to be set in writing.

3. **Evidence of the Oral Price**: The seller's evidence focuses on the written contract's price of $110,000. The buyer's payment of $100,000 is less than the written price, indicating a breach of contract. However, the question specifically asks whether the court will admit the evidence of the orally agreed price of $100,000. The written contract's price is enforceable, and thus the court would likely admit this price as evidence.

4. **Conclusion**: The written contract's price is relevant to the enforceability of the contract, and since the written agreement was for $110,000, the price is admissible as evidence. Therefore, the court will admit the oral price term as relevant.
