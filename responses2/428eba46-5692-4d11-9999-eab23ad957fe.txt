Okay, so I have this math problem here about finding the domain of a function and then determining the sum of three numbers that aren't in the domain. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The function given is f(x) = 1 / [1 + 1 / (1 + 1/x)]. That looks a bit complicated, but I think if I simplify it step by step, I can figure out where it's undefined. 

First, I remember that the domain of a function includes all the real numbers x for which the expression is defined. So, for this function, I need to find the values of x that make the denominator zero because division by zero is undefined. Also, I need to check each inner part of the function to see if any of them can cause division by zero.

Starting from the inside, the innermost part is 1/x. So, x cannot be zero because division by zero is undefined. That's one restriction: x ≠ 0.

Moving outward, the next part is 1 + 1/x. Let's call this part A. So, A = 1 + 1/x. To find when A is zero, we can set up the equation 1 + 1/x = 0. Solving for x, subtract 1 from both sides: 1/x = -1. Then, taking reciprocals, x = -1. So, x cannot be -1 either because that would make A zero, and thus the denominator in the next fraction would be zero.

Next, moving to the outermost part, which is 1 + A. Let's call this part B. So, B = 1 + A = 1 + (1 + 1/x). Simplify that: B = 2 + 1/x. We need to find when B is zero because that would make the entire denominator zero. So, set 2 + 1/x = 0. Subtracting 2: 1/x = -2. Taking reciprocals, x = -1/2. So, x cannot be -1/2 because that would make B zero.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Is B = 1 + A, so if A is 1 + 1/x, then B is 1 + (1 + 1/x) = 2 + 1/x. So, setting 2 + 1/x = 0, as I did before, gives x = -1/2. So, that's another restriction.

So far, I have three restrictions: x cannot be 0, -1, or -1/2.

Wait, but let me make sure I haven't missed anything. Let me write out the function step by step.

f(x) = 1 / [1 + 1 / (1 + 1/x)].

Let me rewrite it step by step to find where it's undefined.

1. The innermost part is 1/x. As I said, x ≠ 0.

2. The next part is 1 + 1/x. Let's denote that as A. So, A = 1 + 1/x. If A is zero, then the function is undefined because we'd have division by zero in 1/A. So, solving 1 + 1/x = 0: 1/x = -1 → x = -1. So, x ≠ -1.

3. Then, moving outward, we have 1 + A. Let's denote that as B. So, B = 1 + A = 1 + (1 + 1/x) = 2 + 1/x. If B is zero, then the function is undefined. So, set 2 + 1/x = 0 → 1/x = -2 → x = -1/2. So, x ≠ -1/2.

Wait, but could there be any other points where the function is undefined? Let me check each step again.

Wait, could there be any other denominators in the denominators? Let me make sure I didn't miss any.

Let me write out the function more explicitly:

f(x) = 1 / [1 + 1 / (1 + 1/x)].

First, the denominator inside the denominator is (1 + 1/x). Then, the denominator of the entire expression is 1 + that. So, as I did before, each denominator we have is (1 + 1/x) and then (1 + (1 + 1/x)).

So, we have:

Denominator1: 1 + 1/x → x ≠ 0.

Denominator2: 1 + Denominator1 → 1 + (1 + 1/x) = 2 + 1/x → x ≠ -1.

Denominator3: 1 + Denominator2 → 1 + (2 + 1/x) = 3 + 1/x → x ≠ -1/3? Wait, hold on. That seems different from what I had before.

Wait, let me correct that. Because in the initial breakdown, I might have miscalculated.

Wait, no, let me take it step by step.

Let me denote D1 = 1 + 1/x. Then D2 = 1 + 1/D1, and D3 = 1 + 1/D2. Then f(x) = 1/D3.

So, D1 = 1 + 1/x → x ≠ 0.

D2 = 1 + 1/D1 = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/x). So, 1/D1 = 1/(1 + 1/x). Let's compute that:

1/(1 + 1/x) = 1/( (x + 1)/x ) = x/(x + 1). So, D2 = 1 + x/(x + 1) = ( (x + 1) + x ) / (x + 1 ) = (2x + 1)/(x + 1).

So, D2 = (2x + 1)/(x + 1). So, D2 is defined when x + 1 ≠ 0 → x ≠ -1.

Then, D3 = 1 + 1/D2 = 1 + (x + 1)/(2x + 1). Let me compute that:

1 + (x + 1)/(2x + 1) = ( (2x + 1) + (x + 1) ) / (2x + 1) ) = (3x + 2)/(2x + 1).

So, D3 is defined when 2x + 1 ≠ 0 → x ≠ -1/2.

So, putting it all together, the function f(x) is undefined when any denominator is zero. So, we have:

1. x ≠ 0 (from D1)

2. x ≠ -1 (from D2)

3. x ≠ -1/2 (from D3)

Therefore, the domain excludes x = 0, x = -1, and x = -1/2.

But wait, the question says there are three real numbers x not in the domain. Wait, that can't be right because I have three points: 0, -1, -1/2. So, the three numbers are -1, -1/2, and 0? Wait, but the options don't include 0, or they do? Let me check the options. Option F is 0, G is 1, H is -1, etc. So, 0 is included.

Wait, but the question is asking for three numbers. So, the three numbers are x = 0, x = -1, and x = -1/2. Let's sum them up: 0 + (-1) + (-1/2) = -1.5. So, the sum is -1.5, which is option G.

Wait, but hold on, let me double-check because sometimes I might have missed something.

Wait, but when I simplified, I found that the function is undefined at x = 0, x = -1, and x = -1/2. So, those are the three numbers, and their sum is 0 + (-1) + (-0.5) = -1.5.

Let me confirm by plugging in each of these values into the function and seeing if the denominator becomes zero.

At x = 0: 1 + 1/x is undefined, so x=0 is excluded.

At x = -1: 1 + 1/(-1) = 1 - 1 = 0, so D1 becomes 0, making the denominator of the next fraction undefined, so x=-1 is excluded.

At x = -1/2: 1 + 1/(-1/2) = 1 - 2 = -1, so D2 becomes -1, then 1 + (-1) = 0, so the denominator becomes zero, making the function undefined. Thus, x=-1/2 is also excluded.

So, the sum is indeed -1.5, which is option G. So, the answer should be G: -1.5.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other points where the function is undefined. Let me check each step again.

Starting with the innermost part: 1/x, which is undefined at x=0.

Then, 1 + 1/x is undefined at x=-1 because 1 + (-1) = 0, which would make the denominator zero in 1/(1 + 1/x).

Then, 1 + (1 + 1/x) is 2 + 1/x. So, when is 2 + 1/x = 0? 1/x = -2 → x = -1/2. So, that's another point where it's undefined.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I considered D3 as 1 + 1/D2, which is 1 + (x + 1)/(2x + 1), which is (3x + 2)/(2x + 1). So, that's undefined when 2x + 1 = 0 → x = -1/2.

So, yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me think about whether any other points could cause issues. For instance, if 1 + 1/x is undefined, that's x=0. If 1 + 1/x is zero, that's x=-1. If 1 + 1/(1 + 1/x) is zero, that's x=-1/2. So, these are the three points where the function is undefined. Thus, the three numbers are 0, -1, -1/2, and their sum is -1.5.

So, the answer is -1.5, which is option G.

Wait, but before I settle on that, I want to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.

Let me recompute each step:

1. Denominator1: 1 + 1/x → x ≠ 0.

2. Denominator2: 1 + (1 + 1/x) = 2 + 1/x → 1/x ≠ -2 → x ≠ -1/2.

Wait, hold on, wait, no. Denominator2 is 2 + 1/x, which is undefined when 2 + 1/x = 0 → 1/x = -2 → x = -1/2. So, yes, x=-1/2 is excluded.

Denominator3: 1 + (2 + 1/x) = 3 + 1/x → 1/x ≠ -3 → x ≠ -1/3. Wait, hold on, that's a different point. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I confused the steps. Let me go back.

Wait, D2 is 1 + (1 + 1/x) = 2 + 1/x. So, D2 is 2 + 1/x. So, D2 is undefined when 1/x is undefined, which is when x=0, but D2 is 2 + 1/x. So, actually, D2 is defined for all x except x=0, but when is D3 undefined?

Wait, D3 is 1 + (2 + 1/x) = 3 + 1/x. So, D3 is undefined when 1/x is undefined, which is when x=0, but that's already considered. But wait, is that the case?

Wait, no, because D3 is 3 + 1/x. So, 3 + 1/x is undefined when 1/x is undefined, which is when x=0. But also, D3 is being used in the outermost function, which is 1/D3. So, D3 must be defined and non-zero for the outer function to be defined. So, D3 must be non-zero.

Wait, perhaps I should check each step again.

Wait, actually, in the function f(x), the domain is where 1 + 1/(1 + 1/x) is defined, and the denominator cannot be zero. So, let me compute the denominator of the outermost function, which is 1 + [1 / (1 + 1/x)].

So, the denominator is 1 + [1 / (1 + 1/x)].

Let me compute that denominator:

Let me denote D = 1 + 1/x.

So, D = 1 + 1/x, which is undefined at x=0.

Then, 1/D = 1/(1 + 1/x). Let me compute that:

1/(1 + 1/x) = x/(x + 1). So, that's defined when x ≠ -1.

Then, 1 + [x/(x + 1)] = (x + 1 + x)/ (x + 1) ) = (2x + 1)/(x + 1).

So, the denominator of the outermost function is (2x + 1)/(x + 1). So, this is undefined when x + 1 = 0 → x = -1, and when 2x + 1 = 0 → x = -1/2.

Wait a minute, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me clarify:

1. The innermost denominator is 1 + 1/x → x ≠ 0.

2. Then, D2 = 1 + 1/D1 = 1 + x/(x + 1) = (2x + 1)/(x + 1). So, D2 is undefined when x + 1 = 0 → x = -1.

3. Then, D3 = 1 + 1/D2 = 1 + (x + 1)/(2x + 1) = (3x + 2)/(2x + 1). So, D3 is undefined when 2x + 1 = 0 → x = -1/2.

Therefore, the points where the function is undefined are x = 0, x = -1, and x = -1/2. So, three numbers: 0, -1, -1/2. Their sum is 0 + (-1) + (-1/2) = -1.5, which is option G.

I think that’s correct. So, I was correct earlier. So, the answer is G: -1.5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{G}
</think>

To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{x}}} \), we need to identify the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero or undefined.

1. The innermost part is \( \frac{1}{x} \), which is undefined at \( x = 0 \).
2. The next part is \( 1 + \frac{1}{x} \). Setting \( 1 + \frac{1}{x} = 0 \) gives \( x = -1 \), so this part is undefined at \( x = -1 \).
3. The outermost part is \( 1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{x}} \). Simplifying this, we find that it is undefined when \( 1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{x}} = 0 \), which occurs at \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \).

Thus, the function is undefined at \( x = 0 \), \( x = -1 \), and \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \). The sum of these three numbers is:

\[ 0 + (-1) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -1.5 \]

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{G}\).
