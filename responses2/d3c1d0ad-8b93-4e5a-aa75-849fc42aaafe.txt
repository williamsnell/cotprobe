Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this personnel selection question. Let me read the question again. It's about when it's appropriate to ask a person's age in the selection process. The options are A through G, each giving a different reason.

Hmm. The question is asking about when it's appropriate to ask age. I remember that age can sometimes be a factor in hiring decisions. Let's think through each option.

Option A: Standardized test results show the incumbent doesn't have all the aptitudes. I don't think this directly relates to asking age. That's more about the test's ability to assess skills, not personal age.

Option B: Age is a bona fide requirement. This makes sense. Some jobs might require age because you need a certain age to handle the job. For example, certain positions might only hire people above a certain age, so the interviewer might ask for the age to verify eligibility.

Option C: Intended future performance issues. This seems more about the future suitability of the candidate, not the age itself. Age isn't necessarily a problem with future performance; it's more about the person's age group.

Option D: Interviewer is curious about age. I don't see why the interviewer would specifically ask for age unless the candidate is interested or the company is curious about age distribution, which I think is covered elsewhere.

Option E: For company demographics and stats. Age could be a factor here, like if they're looking for a certain age group. But that's more about the population being considered rather than the person's age.

Option F: Incumbent near retirement age. If the candidate is near retirement, maybe they're not willing to work anymore, but again, it's more about the company's retirement policy, not the age being asked.

Option G: Policy for age group. If the company has a specific age group, they might prefer to hire people from that group. So asking for the age can be part of the process to ensure people fit the desired demographic.

Wait, but the question is about when it's appropriate to ask age. So which options are about when rather than why. The correct approach is to consider when age is a factor in the selection process.

Option B and G are possible. Let's think about when age is a factor. Age is often a requirement for certain jobs, like medical professionals, certain professions, or specific positions. For example, some companies might prefer hiring older employees for reliability or stability. So in such cases, the interviewer would ask for the age. So option B is about age being a requirement.

Option G is about age being part of the company's age group policy. That's a valid reason for asking age, but it's more about the company's hiring criteria rather than an explicit request for age during the interview.

So the question is about when to ask age. The correct answer would be when age is a bona fide requirement. So option B is the answer.

The correct answer is B: age is a bona fide occupational requirement. This is because age is often a factor in certain jobs, and asking for the incumbent's age can be appropriate when it is a requirement for the job.

Answer: B
