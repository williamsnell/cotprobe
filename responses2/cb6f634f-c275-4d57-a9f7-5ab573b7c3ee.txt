Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm. The question is about power and work done when dragging an object across a rough surface. Let me read it again.

So, a constant horizontal force of 10 N is required to drag an object across a rough surface at a constant speed of 5 m/s. I need to find the power being expended and the work done over 30 minutes. The options are from A to J, each giving different power values and work done in W-hr units.

Wait, power is power equals force times velocity, right? Because power is the rate at which work is done. So the formula is P = F * v. Oh yeah, since the force is constant and the speed is constant, the power should be straightforward.

Given F is 10 N and v is 5 m/s. So 10 * 5 is 50 W. Right, so the power is 50 watts. That's the first part.

Now, work done is power multiplied by time. Work equals power times time, W = P * t. But wait, time here is 30 minutes. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, power is in watts, which is Joules per second. So to find work in joules, I need to convert time to seconds.

30 minutes is 30 * 60 = 1800 seconds. So work W is 50 W * 1800 s. Let's calculate that. 50 * 1800 is 90,000 J, which is 90,000 joules. But the options are given in W-hr, so 90,000 J is equal to 90,000 / (3600) = 25 W-hr. Wait, because 1 W-hr is 3600 J. So 90,000 J is 25 W-hr. Because 25 * 3600 is 90,000.

Looking at the options, let me see:

Option D: 50 W and 90 W-hr.

Yes, that matches. So the power is 50 W, and work is 25 W-hr (since 90,000 J is 25 * 3600 J). So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Another way to think: Work done is force times distance. Since it's moving at constant speed, the distance is velocity multiplied by time. So distance is 5 m/s * 1800 s = 9000 meters.

So work done is F * d = 10 N * 9000 m = 90,000 J, which is 25 W-hr because 90,000/3600=25. So yes, that's correct.

So the power is 50 W, and the work done is 25 W-hr. So the correct option is D: 50 W and 90 W-hr. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Wait a minute, 90,000 J is 25, so does the work done in 30 minutes equal 25 W-hr? Because 1 W-hr is 3600 J. So 25 * 3600 = 90,000 J. So yes, 25 W-hr. So the work is 25 W-hr. But looking at the options, option D says 50 W and 90 W-hr. Does that match?

Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait the question says "How much work would be done in 30 min?" So the work done is 90,000 J, which is 25 W-hr. But looking at the options, the choices are in terms of  W and W-hr. Wait, none of the options have 25 W-hr. Let me check the options again.

Wait, let me look again. The options are A to J. The first part is the power, the second is work done in W-hr.

Wait, option D is 50 W and 90 W-hr. But 90 W-hr is 90 * 3600 J, which is much higher than 90,000 J.

Wait, wait. Oh, I see. Oh, wait, no. Wait, 90,000 J is 25 * 3600 J, which is 25 W-hr. So 90,000 J is 25 W-hr. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 1 W is 1 J per second. So 25 J/s * 3600 s = 90,000 J. So 25 W is 90,000 J. So 25 W-hr is 25 * 3600 = 90,000 J. So the work would be 25 W-hr.

But the options don't have that. Let me look again:

Options:

A: 50 W and 15 W-hr

B: 60 W and 30 W-hr

C:40 W and 20 W-hr

D:50 W and 90 W-hr

E:70 W and 35 W-hr

F:30 W and 15 W-hr

G:50 W and 25 W-hr

H:60 W and 18 W-hr

I:40 W and 60 W-hr

J:70 W and 21 W-hr

Wait, option G is 50 W and 25 W-hr. Oh! So the work is 25 W-hr, which is option G. So the correct answer is D for the power, but the work is 25 W-hr, which is option G. But wait, looking back, option D's work is 90 W-hr, which isn't correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. The work done is 10 N * 5 m/s * 30 min. Wait, no, wait. Let me think in terms of units.

Power is in Watts (J/s). Work is in Joules (J) = Power (W) * time (s).

Wait, 30 minutes is 1800 seconds. So 50 W * 1800 s = 90,000 J. 90,000 J is 90,000 / 3600 = 25 W-hr. So the work done is 25 W-hr.

Looking at the options, the only option with power 50 W is D, but the work is 90 W-hr (which is 324,000 J), which doesn't match. Oh wait, no. Wait, 90 W-hr is 90 * 3600 = 324,000 J. But our work is 90,000 J. So the correct work is 25 W-hr, which is option G. But the options don't have G as the correct work.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

Option D: 50 W and 90 W-hr → but 90 W-hr is 324,000 J, which is way more than 90,000 J. So that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me recalculate the work:

Power is 50 W. Time is 30 minutes, which is 30 * 60 = 1800 seconds.

Work done, W = P * t = 50 * 1800 = 90,000 J.

Convert to W-hr: 90,000 J = (90,000 J) / (3600 J/s) )=25 W * 3600 s → but wait, that's not correct. Wait, 1 W is 1 J/s. So 90,000 J is 90,000 / 3600 = 25 W. Wait, but that's incorrect because W-hr is a unit where 1 W-hr = 3600 J. So the correct way is:

90,000 J is equal to (90,000 / 3600) W = 25 W. So 90,000 J is 25 W * 3600 seconds = 25 W-hr.

Wait, no. Wait, 25 W is 25 J per second. So in one hour (3600 seconds), 25 * 3600 J = 90,000 J. So 90,000 J is 25 W * 3600 s → 25 * 3600 = 90,000 J. So 90,000 J is 25 W-hr.

Wait, so the work done is 25 W-hr, which is option G.

Hmm, but looking at the options, only option D has the power as 50 W. But the work done is 25 W-hr, which is option G. So which option is correct?

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again:

The options are:

D: 50 W and 90 W-hr

G:50 W and 25 W-hr

Wait, the answer is 50 W for power and 25 W-hr for work. So the correct option is G. But looking at the options, the correct pair is 50 W and 25 W-hr. So the only option matching this is G. But wait, I thought the work done is 90,000 J, which is 25 W-hr. So the correct answer would be option G: 50 W and 25 W-hr.

Wait, but I thought the correct pair is D. Because option D says 50 W and 90 W-hr, but that's way too high.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial understanding. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The problem states that the same object is being dragged with a constant horizontal force. So the work done is force times displacement. Displacement is velocity times time. So displacement s = v * t. So in 30 minutes (1800 sec), s = 5 m/s * 1800 = 9000 m.

Work done W = F * s = 10 N * 9000 m = 90,000 J. Now, 90,000 J is 25 * 3600 J → 25 W-hr. So the work done is 25 W-hr.

Looking at the options, the only option with 50 W and 25 W-hr is option G. So the correct answer is G. No, wait, no. Wait, the options are:

Option E: 70 W and 35 W-hr → no.

Wait, no, looking again: The options are:

A to J. Let's list them:

A: 50 W and 15 W-hr → no, because W is 50, and work is 15 W-hr.

B:60 W and 30 W-hr → 60*60=3600 seconds, 60*30=18000 J. Not 90,000.

C:40 W and 20 W-hr → 40*20=800 J. No.

D:50 W and 90 W-hr → 50*90=4500 J. No, because 90 W-hr is 324,000 J.

E:70 W and 35 W-hr → 70*35=2450 J, no.

F:30 W and 15 W-hr → 30*15=450 J.

G:50 W and 25 W-hr → 50*25=1250 J. No, 25 *3600 is 90,000.

H:60 W and 18 W-hr → 60 *18=1080 J.

I:40 W and 60 W-hr → 40 *60=2400 J.

J:70 W and 21 W-hr → 70 *21=1470 J.

Wait, none of these options have 50 W and 90 W-hr. So the correct option is G, even though G's work is 25 W-hr, but 25 W-hr is 90,000 J. So the answer is G. But looking at the options, the correct answer is 50 W and 25 W-hr, which is option G. So the correct answer is G.

Wait, but the options don't have option G as the correct answer, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the work done is 25 W-hr, which is correct, so the correct answer is G. But looking at the options, another possibility is that I made a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check the work:

Power is 10N (force) * 5 m/s (velocity) = 50 W. So that's correct.

Time is 30 minutes = 1800 seconds.

Work done = 50 * 1800 = 90,000 J.

90,000 J is 25 * 3600 J → so 25 W-hr. So the answer is 50 W and 25 W-hr. Which is option G.

But in the options, option D is 50 W and 90 W-hr. That's 90 * 3600 = 324,000 J, which is way more than our 90,000 J.

So the correct answer should be G, but wait, the option G is there. So the correct answer is G:50 W and 25 W-hr.

Wait, but the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.

Looking back:

The options are:

A:50 W and 15 W-hr

B:60 W and 30 W-hr

C:40 W and 20 W-hr

D:50 W and 90 W-hr

E:70 W and 35 W-hr

F:30 W and 15 W-hr

G:50 W and 25 W-hr

H:60 W and 18 W-hr

I:40 W and 60 W-hr

J:70 W and 21 W-hr

So yes, option G is 50 W and 25 W-hr. So the correct answer is G.

To determine the power expended and the work done, we start with the given data:

- **Force (F):** 10 N
- **Speed (v):** 5 m/s
- **Time (t):** 30 minutes

### Step 1: Calculate Power
Power is given by the formula:
\[
P = F \cdot v
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
P = 10 \, \text{N} \cdot 5 \, \text{m/s} = 50 \, \text{W}
\]
Thus, the power expended is **50 W**.

### Step 2: Calculate Work Done
Work done is given by the formula:
\[
W = P \cdot t
\]
First, convert the time from minutes to seconds:
\[
t = 30 \, \text{minutes} \cdot 60 \, \text{s/min} = 1800 \, \text{s}
\]
Now, calculate the work done:
\[
W = 50 \, \text{W} \cdot 1800 \, \text{s} = 90,000 \, \text{J}
\]
Convert the work done to **W-hr** units (1 W-hr = 3600 J):
\[
W = \frac{90,000 \, \text{J}}{3600 \, \text{J/s}} = 25 \, \text{W-hr}
\]
Thus, the work done over 30 minutes is **25 W-hr**.

### Step 3: Match with Options
From the calculations:
- Power: 50 W
- Work done: 25 W-hr

The correct option is **G: 50 W and 25 W-hr**.
