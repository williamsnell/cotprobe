Okay, so I've got this question about general partnerships and what a partner isn't allowed to do. Hmm, I remember from my studies that in a partnership, each partner has certain responsibilities and rights. Let's break this down.

The question is asking which option a partner isn't entitled to. The options are A, B, and C. Let me go through each one.

Option A: To review accounting records. I think partners in general partnerships are allowed to review their own records. They might not have to review the entire business's records unless they have a duty to do so. So, A could be the answer because the question is about what they aren't entitled to. But wait, maybe there's more to it.

Option B: To participate in management. Yes, I remember that in partnerships, each partner usually has the right to manage the business. So B is something they can do, so it's not the answer to the question.

Option C: To be liable only for personal negligence. Wait, I think in general partnerships, the partners are not personally liable for the partnership's debts. So they're not obligated to cover their own business-related debts. But they're also not entirely at fault for business decisions, so maybe they can be liable for the partnership's debts if someone else's actions cause problems. But the question is about what they aren't entitled to. So, being liable for personal negligence would mean they're not responsible for their own negligence, which is correct. So C is a right, not a reason they aren't entitled to it.

Putting it all together, the question is asking which option a partner isn't entitled to. So the answer would be A because reviewing accounting isn't their right. They can review their own records, but the partnership's accounting isn't their responsibility unless they have a duty. So the correct answer is A.

The correct answer is **A: To review accounting records**. 

**Explanation:**  
In a general partnership, a partner is not entitled to review the partnership's accounting records unless they have a duty to do so, such as reviewing their own records. They are not responsible for the partnership's financial statements. 

Answer: A
