Question:

What prevents the stomach from being digested by itsown secretions?

Options:

A: The stomach has a high permeability to hydrogen ions
B: The presence of beneficial bacteria that neutralize stomach acid
C: The stomach lining is replaced every month
D: The stomach lining secretes digestive enzymes only when food is present
E: The production of bile in the stomach neutralizes the digestive acids
F: A thick layer of muscle tissue that is resistant to digestive enzymes and acids
G: The stomach is protected by a layer of fat
H: The mucus layer, the permeability of the membranes and the continual replacement of the cells comprising the lining all help protect the stomach from being digested by its own secretions.
I: The stomach secretes a special hormone that prevents digestion of its own tissues
J: The stomach contents are too acidic for the enzymes to function properly

Okay, so I've got this question about the stomach and why it doesn't get digested by its own secretions. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question is asking what prevents the stomach from being eaten by its own secretions. So, I'm trying to remember what I know about the digestive system. The stomach is the first part to absorb food, right? It has a layer of lining called the mucous membrane, which is made up of smooth muscle cells. These cells absorb the acids from the food, making it easier to digest.

I remember hearing that the stomach lining secretes enzymes, like amylases, which break down starches into smaller sugars. But why does the stomach not get digested by its own secretions? Oh, wait! The presence of beneficial bacteria is important. Bacteria in the stomach can neutralize the acid, making it easier for the enzymes to work. So, option B says the presence of beneficial bacteria that neutralize stomach acid. That sounds right.

Other options: Option C says the lining is replaced every month. That's true, but it doesn't explain why the secretions don't digest the food. It's just the lining changes, not the function. Option D says the lining only secretes enzymes when food is present. That's more about the timing, not the reason. Option E mentions bile neutralizing acids. Bile is actually produced in the intestines, not the stomach, so that's probably not relevant.

Option A talks about hydrogen ions. I'm not sure about that. The stomach has a low pH, but hydrogen ions are more about the acid environment. The main issue is the acid being neutralized by bacteria. Option F suggests thick muscle tissue that's resistant. I don't think that's the main factor. Option G says it's protected by fat, but I think the main defense is the lining and the presence of enzymes and bacteria.

Option H suggests the mucus and cell replacement help protect. While that's true, it's not the primary reason why the digestion doesn't happen by secretions. The main reason is the presence of beneficial bacteria.

Option J says the stomach is too acidic. That seems to be the opposite of what's happening. The stomach is actually acidic, but the secretions are neutralizing it.

Option I is about a hormone, but I don't think the stomach uses a hormone for this purpose. It's more about enzymes and bacteria.

So, putting it all together, the best answer is B: The presence of beneficial bacteria that neutralize stomach acid. That's the key factor why the stomach doesn't get digested by its own secretions.

The correct answer is **B: The presence of beneficial bacteria that neutralize stomach acid**. This is because beneficial bacteria in the stomach effectively neutralize the stomach acid, making it easier for digestive enzymes to function. 

Answer: B
