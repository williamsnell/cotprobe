Okay, so I've got this problem here about carbon diffusing in steel, right? I'm a bit rusty on my diffusion concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says a hot mild steel rod is placed in a carbonaceous substance. The initial carbon concentration is 0.22% by weight. The surface concentration is 1.4% at equilibrium. We need to find the time it takes for a point 0.15 cm below the surface to reach 0.78% carbon concentration. The diffusivity is given as 5.7e-6 cm²/sec.

Hmm, I remember Fick's laws of diffusion might be involved here. Oh wait, but wait, this is probably a steady-state situation because it's at equilibrium. So maybe it's using the steady-state solution for diffusion.

In diffusion, the concentration profile is such that the concentration gradient doesn't change with time. The formula for the concentration at a distance x in a semi-infinite solid is... I think it's C = C0[1 - (x/L)], where L is the length of the diffusion path. Wait, but wait, I might be mixing it up. Let me think again.

Wait, no. For the case where the concentration at the surface is higher than the initial, and assuming steady-state, the concentration profile is linear. So the concentration at a point x from the surface is given by C(x) = C0 + (C_s - C0) * (x/L), where L is the length of the material, and C0 is the initial concentration. But wait, no, I think it's C(x) = C0 + (C_s - C0) * (x/L). Because at x=0, it's C0, and at x=L, it's Cs.

Wait, no. Wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the concentration at x is given by a linear function. So if the surface is at x=0, then when x increases, the concentration increases as well. So C(x) = C0 + (Cs - C0) * (x/L), where L is the length over which the diffusion occurs. But wait, wait. Let me get the exact formula.

Wait, the equation is actually C(x) = C0 + (Cs - C0) * (x/L) for a semi-infinite solid. Or is it the other way around? Because when x is zero, the concentration is C0, and when x is L, it's Cs. So if the rod is L = x_total long, then at any x, the concentration increases from C0 to Cs as x increases.

But wait, in this problem, the surface concentration is higher than the initial. So the initial is 0.22%, surface is 1.4%, so the surface is higher. So the concentration increases with x. So the formula is correct.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the concentration at x is given by C(x) = C_s * (1 - (x/L)) + C_0 * (x/L). Let me make sure. Hmm, I think the correct formula is C(x) = C0 + (Cs - C0) * (x/L). So at x=0, it's C0; at x=L, Cs.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if we're considering the concentration increases from C0 to Cs, then yes, that formula makes sense.

So the problem states that at a point 0.15 cm below the surface (so x=0.15 cm), the concentration is 0.78%. So let's set up the equation.

Wait, the initial concentration C0 is 0.22% (0.0022 in decimal?), and the surface concentration Cs is 1.4% (0.014). The point we're considering is x=0.15 cm. The desired concentration is 0.78% (0.0078).

So plugging into the equation C(x) = C0 + (Cs - C0) * (x/L).

Wait, but what's L here? Wait, wait, L is the distance from the surface to the point we're considering. Oh, but wait, the diffusivity given is for the entire rod. So the rod is L cm long, and the point is x cm below the surface. So x is 0.15 cm. So L should be the total length of the rod. But wait, the problem doesn't give us L. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, because the equation needs L to solve for time. But the question doesn't give L. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different because of the halfway point?

Wait, no. Wait, another approach. The time for diffusion in a semi-infinite solid is given by the formula t = x^2 / (2 D L), where D is the diffusivity and L is the length of the material. Wait, wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The general formula for the time to reach a certain concentration in a semi-infinite solid is t = (x^2) / (2 D L), where L is the length of the rod. Wait, no, perhaps it's L being the length of the rod. Wait, but in this setup, how do I find L if I don't have time?

Wait, the problem gives us the time, but I don't think that's the case. Wait, no. The question is, for a point x below the surface, what's the time t? Wait, no, that's not possible because without knowing L, you can't compute t. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the rod is considered to be a semi-infinite solid, and the length L is the distance from the surface to the farthest point we're considering. Wait, but no, because L is fixed, but in this problem, the point is 0.15 cm below the surface, but the total length of the rod is perhaps much longer. Wait, but without knowing L, we can't compute t.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let's think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentration profile is linear, and the time for a point x is given by a more complex formula, perhaps considering the entire length. But without knowing L, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the problem statement. Oh, wait, the problem says the rod is placed in a carbonaceous substance. Wait, but the carbon concentration at the surface of the rod is 1.4%, which is higher than the initial. So the diffusion is happening from the surface into the rod. So the rod is semi-infinite, and the surface is at x=0, and the point of interest is at x = 0.15 cm. So L would be the length of the rod, which is unknown.

But wait, the problem doesn't give us the length of the rod. Oh wait, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that L is the same as the distance to the point of interest plus some other distance? Or perhaps I've got it backwards.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the time to reach a certain concentration at a certain distance in a semi-infinite solid, where the time depends on the square of the distance and the diffusivity and the length. But without knowing L, perhaps the formula can't be applied directly.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe it's not a semi-infinite rod but a finite one. But the problem states it's a hot mild steel rod placed in a carbonaceous substance, but doesn't specify the length. So I think it's a semi-infinite rod.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The problem gives us the surface concentration (1.4%) and initial concentration (0.22%), and wants to find the time when a point 0.15 cm below the surface has 0.78% concentration.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the concentration profile. If the surface is at x=0, then the concentration increases linearly towards x=L. So, the concentration at x is C(x) = C0 + (Cs - C0) * (x/L). 

So, in our case, C(x) = 0.22% + (1.4% - 0.22%) * (x/L) = 0.22% + (1.18%) * (x/L).

We want C(x) = 0.78% at x=0.15 cm, so:

0.78% = 0.22% + (1.18%)(0.15 cm / L)

Let me compute the right side:

0.78 - 0.22 = 0.56. So 0.56 = (1.18) * (0.15 / L) → 

0.56 = (1.77) / L → 

L = 1.77 / 0.56 → Let me compute that. 1.77 / 0.56. 

Let me calculate: 0.56 * 3 is 1.68. 1.77 -1.68 = 0.09. So 3 + (0.09/0.56) → approximately 3 + 0.16 = 3.16 cm. So the length L is about 3.16 cm.

Wait, but how does that help us find the time?

Because the time for the diffusion is given by t = (x^2)/(2 D L), but wait, actually, the formula for the time in a semi-infinite solid when you're at a point x is t = x^2 / (2 D L). But wait, wait, no, that's for when the system is at steady state. Or is it the inverse?

Wait, no, perhaps I should think more carefully. The time to reach a certain concentration in a semi-infinite solid is given by the formula:

t = (x²) / (2 D L) * (C_s - C_0) / (C_0 - C_s) )

Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps I should use Fick's second law for the concentration profile, but that's a PDE. It's more involved.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, perhaps I should refer to the correct formula for the time to reach a certain concentration in a semi-infinite solid.

Wait, I think the correct formula is t = x²/(2 D L). Wait, but that seems off. Because if the rod is very long, L would be the same as x, making t = x^2/(2 D x) )= x/(2 D). Hmm, but let me be more precise.

The general solution for the concentration in a semi-infinite solid due to a step change in concentration at the surface is C(x,t) = (C_s - C_0) * (x)/(2 D t) ) * e^{-x²/(4 D t)}. Wait, no, that's for the transient case. Alternatively, maybe in the case of steady-state, the solution is C(x) = C_0 + (C_s - C_0) * (x/L), but in that case, the time aspect isn't involved. But the problem is about the time when a point reaches a certain concentration, which implies it's the transient case.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the cases. If the problem is about the time when a point in the solid reaches a certain concentration, then it's the transient solution.

Wait, the concentration profile for a semi-infinite solid due to a surface concentration is given by C(x,t) = (C_s - C_0) * (x)/(2 D t) ) * e^{-x²/(4 D t)} + C_0.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the time is given by the formula t = x²/(2 D L) * (1/(C_s - C_0)) ) * (C_0 - C(x)).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the time to reach a concentration C(x) in a semi-infinite solid is given by:

t = (x²)/(2 D L) * (C_s - C_0)/(C_0 - C(x)).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula involves the square of x divided by (2 D L). Let me think about the units. The units of time would be (cm)^2/(cm^2/sec) ) → seconds. So that makes sense.

But wait, in our equation, the concentration is given by C(x) = C_0 + (C_s - C_0)*(x/L). So for x=0.15 cm, C(x) is 0.78% and we have C_s=1.4%, C_0=0.22%, so let me plug that into the equation.

Let me compute (C_s - C_0) = 1.18% (since 1.4% - 0.22% = 1.18%). So:

0.78 = 0.22 + 1.18 * (0.15 / L)

Subtract 0.22 from both sides:

0.56 = 1.18 * (0.15 / L)

So 0.56 = 0.177 / L → L = 0.177 / 0.56 ≈ 0.316 cm.

Wait, that's the length of the rod. But then, to find the time t, should I use L in the formula?

Wait, I think I'm getting confused between the length and the x in the equation. Let me restate: the rod has a length L, and in the problem, the point x is 0.15 cm. So in the equation, x is 0.15 cm.

The formula for the time is t = x²/(2 D L). But wait, no. Wait, another approach: For the diffusion in a semi-infinite solid, the time for a particular concentration is given by the formula:

t = (x^2) / (2 D L) ) * (1/(C_0 - C(x))) * (C_s - C_0)

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is t = (x^2) / (2 D L) ) * ( (C_s - C_0) / (C_0 - C(x)) ) )

Wait, that might make sense. Let me plug in the numbers.

We have:

x = 0.15 cm

C_0 = 0.22%

C_s = 1.4%

C(x) = 0.78%

So, (C_s - C_0) = 1.18%,

(C_0 - C(x)) = 0.22 - 0.78 = -0.56%.

So, (C_s - C_0)/(C_0 - C(x)) ) = 1.18 / (-0.56) ≈ -2.107.

Now, t = x²/(2 D L) * ( (C_s - C_0) )/(C_0 - C(x)) )

Wait, no, the formula might be t = x²/(2 D L) * (C_s - C_0)/(C_0 - C(x)).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

t = (x^2) * (C_s - C_0) / (2 D L (C_0 - C(x)) )

Wait, that would have the same units.

Wait, let's plug the numbers.

x² = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225 cm².

D is 5.7e-6 cm²/s.

L is the length, which we found earlier as approximately 0.316 cm.

So,

t = (0.0225) * (1.18) / (2 *5.7e-6 * 0.316 * (-0.56) )

Wait, let me compute denominator and numerator step by step.

Numerator: 0.0225 * 1.18 = 0.02655.

Denominator: 2 *5.7e-6 * 0.316 * (-0.56) → let's compute each part.

2 *5.7e-6 = 1.14e-5.

1.14e-5 * 0.316 = 3.6024e-6.

3.6024e-6 * (-0.56) = -2.0175e-6.

So denominator is approximately -2.0175e-6.

So t = 0.02655 / (-2.0175e-6) → which is approximately -13157 seconds.

But time can't be negative, so I must have made a mistake in the signs. Oh wait, because (C_0 - C(x)) is negative (since 0.78% < 0.22%). So (C_s - C_0) is positive, (C_0 - C(x)) is negative. So their ratio is negative.

But time can't be negative. Hmm, perhaps the formula should take the absolute value, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should have used (C_s - C_0) in the numerator and (C_0 - C(x)) in denominator, but that would invert the ratio.

Wait, let me try that.

t = (x^2) * (C_s - C_0) / (2 D L (C_0 - C(x)) )

So,

t = (0.0225) * (1.18) / ( 2 *5.7e-6 * 0.316 * (0.22 - 0.78) )

Wait, because (C_0 - C(x)) is 0.22 - 0.78 = -0.56.

So,

t = 0.0225 * 1.18 / ( 2 *5.7e-6 * 0.316 * (-0.56) )

Denominator is same as before, but the sign is negative.

So,

t = (0.0225 * 1.18) / ( -2 *5.7e-6 *0.316 *0.56 )

Compute the denominator:

2 *5.7e-6 = 1.14e-5.

0.316 * 0.56 = 0.17696.

So denominator: 1.14e-5 * 0.17696 = 2.017e-6.

So, denominator is 2.017e-6.

So, t= (0.0225 * 1.18) / (-2.017e-6 )

Compute numerator: 0.0225 * 1.18 = 0.02655.

So, t = 0.02655 / (-2.017e-6) → approximately -13157 seconds.

Hmm, so negative time doesn't make sense. So perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is t = x²/(2 D L), without the ratio of the concentrations. But wait, no, that can't be right because without L, you can't compute t.

Wait, perhaps I should have made an error in the formula. Let me think again.

The correct formula for the time to reach a certain concentration in a semi-infinite solid is:

t = (x^2) / ( 2 D L ) * ( (C_s - C_0) ) / (C_0 - C(x)) )

Wait, but that gives the same negative time as before. So perhaps I have an error in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

t = (x^2) / ( 2 D L ), but without any concentration ratio because the time is determined by the diffusion distance and the diffusion coefficient.

But that can't be right either, because the time would depend only on x and D, not on the initial concentration.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try using the formula for the time to reach a certain concentration in a semi-infinite solid, which is:

t = x² / (2 D L), where L is the total length of the material.

But in this problem, L is the length of the rod, which we can compute from the surface concentration and the concentration at x=0.15 cm.

So, using the earlier equation:

C(x) = C_0 + (Cs - C_0) * (x/L)

So, solving for L:

L = x * (Cs - C_0) / (C(x) - C_0 )

Wait, no, wait. Let me rearrange the equation:

C(x) - C_0 = (Cs - C_0) * (x/L )

So,

x/L = (C(x) - C_0) / (Cs - C_0 )

→ L = x * (Cs - C_0) / (C(x) - C_0 )

So, plugging in the numbers:

C(x) = 0.78%,

C_0 = 0.22%,

Cs = 1.4%,

x=0.15 cm.

So,

Cs - C_0 = 1.4% - 0.22% = 1.18%,

C(x) - C_0 = 0.78% - 0.22% = 0.56%.

So,

L = 0.15 cm * (1.18%) / (0.56%) )

Wait, but the percentages should be converted to decimal form.

So,

Cs - C_0 = 1.18/100 = 0.0118,

C(x) - C_0 = 0.56/100 = 0.0056,

So,

L = 0.15 * (0.0118 / 0.0056 ) → 0.15 * (2.107) ≈ 0.316 cm.

So, the rod is about 0.316 cm long.

Now, using the formula t = x^2/(2 D L ), where x is 0.15 cm, D is 5.7e-6 cm²/s, and L is 0.316 cm.

So,

t = (0.15^2) / (2 *5.7e-6 * 0.316 )

Compute denominator:

2 *5.7e-6 = 1.14e-5,

1.14e-5 * 0.316 ≈ 3.58e-6.

So,

t = 0.0225 / (3.58e-6 ) ≈ 6263.7 seconds.

Wait, but wait, that calculation leads to a time of approx 6263.7 seconds.

Wait, but that's about 1.74 hours. Hmm, but the available options are in the order of hours and minutes.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Because the formula t = x^2/(2 D L ) is for the diffusion time in a semi-infinite solid, but in this case, the length is actually the same as x, which would make t = x^2/(2 D x ), which is x/(2 D ). Let me compute that.

x/(2 D ) = 0.15 cm / ( 2 *5.7e-6 cm²/s )

→ 0.15 / (1.14e-5 ) → approx 1315.789 seconds.

Wait, that's about 21.93 minutes, which is 21 minutes and 56 seconds. But the options are in whole minutes. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, I think the correct formula should have L as the length of the rod, which is much longer than x. But in our case, the rod is only 0.316 cm long. So, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula to find the time when a point x is at a certain concentration C(x) is:

t = x^2 / (2 D L ) * ( (C_s - C_0 ) / (C_0 - C(x) ) )

Which would give a positive time.

Wait, let me plug the numbers.

x = 0.15 cm,

D =5.7e-6 cm²/s,

L=0.316 cm,

(C_s - C_0 ) =1.18%,

(C_0 - C(x) )=0.56%.

So,

t = (0.15^2)/(2 *5.7e-6 *0.316 ) * (1.18/0.56 )

Compute the first part:

(0.15)^2=0.0225,

Denominator: 2 *5.7e-6 *0.316 =3.58e-6,

So, 0.0225 / 3.58e-6 ≈6263.7.

Multiply by (1.18/0.56 )=2.107.

So,

t =6263.7 * 2.107 ≈132,000 seconds.

Wait, that's impossible because the options are in the range of hours to days.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Perhaps I should use the formula t = (x^2)/(2 D L ), but L is the length of the rod, which we found earlier as approximately 0.316 cm.

So,

t = (0.15^2) / (2 *5.7e-6 *0.316 )

Compute denominator:

2 *5.7e-6 =1.14e-5,

1.14e-5 *0.316=3.58e-6,

So,

t=0.0225 /3.58e-6 ≈6263.7 seconds.

Convert seconds to minutes: 6263.7 /60 ≈104.396 minutes.

Convert minutes to hours: 104.396 /60 ≈1.73997 hours.

Wait, that's approximately 1 hour and 44 minutes. But none of the options are near that. The options are in the range of hours. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should ignore the formula and think about the time it takes for the point 0.15 cm from surface to reach 0.78%.

Wait, but another approach is to consider the time to reach a certain concentration in a semi-infinite solid, which is given by t = x²/(2 D L ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is t = x^2/(2 D L ), but the L in this formula is the length of the rod, which is the same as x. Which would make t = x²/(2 D x ) = x/(2 D ), which is 0.15/(2*5.7e-6 )= 0.15/(1.14e-5 )=1315.789 seconds, which is 21.93 minutes.

But again, the options are in hours.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the time using the time formula for a semi-infinite solid, which is t = x^2/(2 D L ), where L is the length of the rod. But in this problem, L is much longer than x, so t = x^2/(2 D L ) would be very small.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to compute the time using the formula t = x^2/(2 D L ), where L is the length of the rod, which is 0.316 cm.

So,

t = (0.15)^2 / (2 *5.7e-6 *0.316 )

Compute denominator: 2*5.7e-6 =1.14e-5, 1.14e-5 *0.316 =3.58e-6.

So,

t= 0.0225 /3.58e-6 ≈6263.7 s.

Convert seconds to hours: 6263.7 /3600 ≈1.7397 hours.

Which is approximately 1 hour and 44 minutes.

But the options are in hours. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula I used is correct, and the time is about 1.74 hours. Looking back at the options:

Options:

A) 2.7h

B) 3.1h

C) 2.7h

D) 2.4h

E) 1.75h.

Wait, looking at option E: 1.75h.

So, the correct answer would be option E.

But wait, how did I get the time to be about 1.74 hours, which is 1 hour and 44 minutes. But option E is 1.75h, which is about 1 hour and 45 minutes.

So, perhaps the correct answer is E) 1.75h.

But wait, let me recheck the calculations because perhaps I made an error in the formula.

Wait, let me look up the correct formula for the time to reach a concentration in a semi-infinite solid. According to my notes, the formula is t = x²/(2 D L ), where L is the length of the rod. So, I think that's correct.

So, plugging in the numbers:

x =0.15 cm,

D=5.7e-6 cm²/s,

L=0.316 cm.

So,

t = (0.15)^2 / (2 *5.7e-6 *0.316 )

=0.0225 / (3.58e-6 )

=6263.7 seconds.

6263.7 seconds divided by 3600 seconds/hour is approximately 1.7397 hours.

So, approximately 1.74 hours, which is about 1.75 hours.

So, option E is 1.75h, which is the correct choice.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the time came out as approximately 21 minutes, which is 0.35 hours. But no, the calculation shows about 1.74 hours.

Wait, no, 6263.7 seconds is 1.7397 hours. So, 1.74 hours is about 1 hour and 45 minutes.

So, the correct answer is option E:1.75h.
</think>

To determine the time required for a point 0.15 cm from the surface of a rod to attain a carbon concentration of 0.78%, we use the formula for diffusion in a semi-infinite solid:

\[
t = \frac{x^2}{2 D L}
\]

Where:
- \(x = 0.15 \, \text{cm}\) (distance from the surface),
- \(D = 5.7 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s}\) (diffusion coefficient),
- \(L = 0.316 \, \text{cm}\) (length of the rod, calculated from the surface concentration and the concentration at \(x = 0.15 \, \text{cm}\)).

### Step 1: Calculate the numerator
\[
x^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the denominator
\[
2 D L = 2 \cdot 5.7 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 0.316 = 3.58 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Step 3: Compute the time
\[
t = \frac{0.0225}{3.58 \times 10^{-6}} = 6263.7 \, \text{seconds}
\]
