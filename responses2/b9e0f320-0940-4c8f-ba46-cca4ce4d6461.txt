Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm supposed to determine whether the argument is valid using indirect truth tables. If it's invalid, I need to choose a counterexample from the options given. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The argument given is:

(A ∨ B) ⊃ C  
C ⊃ ~D  
D ⊃ A  

And the options are A through J, each giving a specific counterexample scenario. I need to figure out if this argument is valid or not, and if not, pick the right counterexample.

First, I remember that an argument is invalid if there's at least one scenario where all the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. So, I'll have to set up a truth table with all possible combinations of truth values for A, B, C, D, and then evaluate the premises and the conclusion in each case.

Wait, but that's a lot of combinations. Let's see: for four variables (A, B, C, D), there are 2^4 = 16 possible combinations. That's manageable, but maybe I can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using logical equivalences. Let me rewrite each premise to see if I can find a contradiction.

Wait, another thought: in a valid argument, if the premises are all true, then the conclusion must also be true. So, if I can find a situation where the premises are all true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

So, the conclusion here is D ⊃ A, which is equivalent to ~D ∨ A. So, if the conclusion is false, it means ~D is true and A is false. So, for the premises to be true, we need:

1. (A ∨ B) ⊃ C: So, if A or B is true, then C must be true.
2. C ⊃ ~D: So, if C is true, then ~D is true, meaning D is false.
3. D ⊃ A: Which we're considering as a case where D is true (for the conclusion to be false), so A must be false.

So, let's try to construct a scenario where all premises are true, and the conclusion is false.

Putting this together:

Premise 1: (A ∨ B) ⊃ C. If either A or B is true, then C must be true.

Premise 2: C ⊃ ~D. If C is true, then D is false.

Premise 3: D ⊃ A. If D is true, then A is false.

Wait, but in the scenario where D is true (for the conclusion to be false), then by premise 3, A must be false. But then, looking at premise 1: (A ∨ B) ⊃ C. If A is false, then A ∨ B is only true if B is true. So, if B is true, then C must be true.

Now, from premise 2: C ⊃ ~D. But D is true in this scenario, so ~D is false. So, premise 2 would require that C is false because C → ~D is only false when C is true and ~D is false. So, if C is true, premise 2 would make the whole implication false. So, that's a problem because premise 2 must be true in our hypothetical case.

Wait, let me rephrase that. If D is true, then by premise 3, A must be false. Then, looking at premise 1: (A ∨ B) ⊃ C. Since A is false, this becomes (False ∨ B) ⊃ C, which simplifies to B ⊃ C. So, if B is true, then C must be true. 

But then, since C is true, premise 2 (C ⊃ ~D) is C → ~D. But since D is true here, ~D is false. So, C → false is only false when C is true. So, C → false is false only when C is true. Wait, wait: C → ~D is equivalent to (C ∧ D) is false. So, when is C → ~D false? The implication is false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.

So, in this scenario, D is true, so ~D is false. So, for C → ~D to be true, the antecedent must be false. The antecedent is C, so C must be false for the implication to hold. But in our hypothetical case, C must be true because of premise 1 (since B is true, so B → C, and B is true, so C must be true). So, C is true, ~D is false. So, C → ~D is false.

But that's a problem because premise 2 must be true. Because in the argument, premise 2 is C → ~D, and if that's false, then the entire argument is invalid.

So, this is a contradiction. Let me try to outline this scenario more clearly:

We want D to be true (so that the conclusion D→A is false, because A is false). So, D is true.

From premise 3: D→A, which is true only if D is false or A is true. Since D is true here, A must be false (for the implication to hold). So, A is false.

Now, look at premise 1: (A ∨ B) → C. Since A is false, this becomes (False ∨ B) → C → (B → C). So, B → C must be true.

So, B → C is true. So, if B is true, C must be true.

But from premise 2: C → ~D. Since D is true, ~D is false. So, C → false is only true if C is false.

But from premise 1, if B is true, then C must be true. So, if B is true, C is true. But then, premise 2 requires that C is false for the implication to hold. That's a contradiction.

So, we need to see if there's a way to make premise 2 true when D is true and A is false.

Wait, let's re-examine.

If D is true, then premise 3: D→A is true only if A is false.

So, A is false.

Now, look at premise 1: (A ∨ B) → C. Since A is false, it's equivalent to (False ∨ B) → C → B → C.

We have to make this implication true. So, for B → C to be true, B must be false when C is true, or B is false, or C is true.

Wait, no. B → C is equivalent to ¬B ∨ C. So, if either B is false, or C is true, then the implication holds.

So, in our case, we need either B is false, or C is true.

But from premise 2, which is C → ~D. Since D is true, ~D is false. So, C → false. So, that's only possible if C is false.

Wait, but premise 1 says (A ∨ B) → C. So, if C is true, then premise 1 is true. If C is false, then premise 1 is only true if B is false.

Wait, let me construct the truth table for this.

Let me set up the scenario where D is true (so conclusion D→A is false, to see if the premises can all be true).

So, D = T.

From premise 3: D→A → T → A must be F. So, A = F.

From premise 1: (A ∨ B) → C. Since A is F, this becomes F ∨ B → C → B → C.

We need this to be true.

So, B → C must be true.

So, B → C is equivalent to ¬B ∨ C.

So, for this implication to be true, either B is false, or C is true.

But we also have from premise 2: C → ~D. Since D is T, ~D is F. So, C → F is F only when C is T. When C is T, C → F is F. So, premise 2 requires that C must be F, because if C were T, then C→F is F, which would make premise 2 false.

So, premise 2: C → F must be true. But C → F is only true when C is false. So, premise 2's implication C→F is only true when C is F.

So, in our scenario, we have to have C = F to satisfy premise 2.

But looking back at premise 1: B → C. But C is F, so B → F must be true. So, B → F is true when B is F (since any statement implies F only if B is false). So, to satisfy premise 1, B must be F.

So, now, in this scenario:

D = T

A = F

B = F

C = F

Let me check all premises:

1. (A ∨ B) → C → (F ∨ F) → F → F → F. So, (A ∨ B) is F, so implication is T.

2. C → ~D → F → ~T → F → F. So, F → F is T.

3. D → A → T → F → F. So, T → F is F.

Wait, but premise 3 is D→A, which is T→F, which is F. So, premise 3 is false. But we were trying to find a scenario where all premises are true. So, this scenario doesn't work because premise 3 is false.

Hmm, so that's a problem. So, in the scenario where D is T, and A is F, B is F, and C is F, premise 3 is false. So, that's not a valid scenario for all premises being true.

What if we try another scenario where D is true, A is F, B is F, and C is true?

Wait, can C be true? Let's see.

If C is true, then from premise 1: (A ∨ B) → C. Since A is F and B is F, (F ∨ F)=F, so F → C → C must be true. So, if C is true, premise 1 is true.

From premise 2: C → ~D → T → ~T → T → F. So, T→F is F, which makes premise 2 false. So, in this case, premise 2 is false, which is not acceptable if we're looking for all premises being true.

So, this scenario doesn't work either.

Another possibility: D is T, A is F, B is T, C is ?

Wait, let's see. From premise 3, since A is F, C must be F (because D→A is T→F=F, which is allowed only if premise 3 is true. Wait, but premise 3 is D→A. So, if D is T and A is F, then D→A is F. That would make premise 3 false. So, that can't be in our scenario where we're trying to find a counterexample.

So, perhaps D is T, A is F, and B is F, making C must be F (from premise 1). But that makes premise 2 false because C is F. Alternatively, if D is T, A is F, B is F, and C is T, then premise 1 is true, premise 2 is C→~D → T→F, which is F, so premise 2 is false. So, in that scenario, premise 2 is false, which is not acceptable.

It seems like any scenario where D is T and A is F will have either premise 2 or premise 3 failing, which would make the entire argument invalid. So, is the argument invalid?

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Is there a way to have D=T, A=F, B=F, and C=F?

Wait, in that case:

Premise 1: (A∨B) → C → F → C is F. So, F → F is T. So, premise 1 is T.

Premise 2: C→~D → F→~T → F→F, which is T. So, premise 2 is T.

Premise 3: D→A → T→F → F. So, premise 3 is F.

So, in this scenario, premises 1 and 2 are T, but premise 3 is F. So, the argument is invalid.

So, this is a valid counterexample.

Wait, but looking back at the options given, option E is: "Invalid. Counterexample when A, C, and D are true and B is false".

Wait, in this case, A is F, B is F, C is F, D is T. So, that fits option E. So, the argument is invalid because this scenario exists where all premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

So, that would mean the answer is E: Invalid. Counterexample when A, C, and D are true and B is false.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, the conclusion is D → A. In this scenario, D is T, A is F. So, D→A is F. So, the conclusion is false.

Yes, that's a valid counterexample.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option E says "Invalid. Counterexample when A, C, and D are true and B is false." That matches our scenario.

So, the answer is E. So, the argument is invalid because the premises can all be true when D is true, A is false, B is false, and C is false. Then, the conclusion D→A is false.
</think>

To determine whether the argument is valid, we analyzed the truth table and identified a scenario where all premises are true, but the conclusion is false. This scenario occurs when D is true, A is false, B is false, and C is false. In this case:

1. **Premise 1**: (A ∨ B) ≡ F → C ≡ F → T (since F → F is true).
2. **Premise 2**: C ≡ F → ~D ≡ ~T → F → F (since F → F is true).
3. **Conclusion**: D ≡ T → A ≡ F → F (since T → F is false).

This scenario violates the argument's conclusion, making the argument invalid. The correct counterexample is in option E.
