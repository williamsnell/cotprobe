Okay, so I need to figure out which statement isn't part of the Osman v UK decision. Let me think about what I remember about the European Court of Justice and the Osman case. 

The Osman v UK case came up in 1998 and it's about the European Convention on the Law of Treaties and the obligations of states. I think the key point there was about positive obligations, like general positive obligations, not just liability. 

The Osman test was developed to determine when a state has a general positive obligation. A general positive obligation is a duty to prevent a particular kind of harm that could be caused by a state agent. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: The risk must come from a state agent. I remember that the test requires that the risk is originating from a state agent. So this is part of the test, so it's a correct statement, not the answer.

Option B: If there's a real and imminent risk of death or harm, it's considered a risk. That sounds right because the test includes real and imminent risks. So B is part of the test.

Option C: The state should take reasonable steps to prevent death or harm. From what I recall, the test also requires states to take reasonable steps. So C is part of the test.

Option D: A state knows or ought to know. Wait, does this apply? I think the positive obligation was more about intent or knowledge. The common law approach might say that states have an obligation based on their knowledge, but the Osman test adds that the state must have reasonable knowledge, not just know. So D might be the incorrect part because the test doesn't require states to know; it's about reasonable steps.

So the statement that's not part of the Osman test is D.

The Osman v UK case laid down the European Court's decision regarding general positive obligations. The correct answer is the statement that does not conform to the test.

**Answer: D**
