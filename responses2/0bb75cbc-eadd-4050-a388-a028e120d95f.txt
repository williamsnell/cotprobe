Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics question here. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about melting ice using steam. Right, I remember that when you heat water, when it's in a phase change situation, the heat required can be calculated using the heat of vaporization and the heat of fusion.

Wait, the question says: 100 grams of steam at 100°C is condensed to liquid. When that condenses, it releases heat. That heat is used to melt some ice at 0°C. Oh, right, because when you melt ice, you're going from solid to liquid, and that uses the heat of fusion.

So the process is: steam (100g) condensing → water (100g) + heat released. Then, that heat is used to melt ice. So I need to calculate how much ice can be melted with that 100g of steam.

Wait, but wait. The actual steam is 100g at 100°C, right. So when it condenses, it becomes water at 100°C, and then that water (100g) would cool down to 0°C, right? Because the heat from condensation would have to first cool the water from 100°C to 0°C when melted, and then the ice would melt.

But wait, actually, no. Wait: when you condense, you're removing heat. So the process is 100g of steam (100°C) → 100g of water (100°C). Then, that water is cooled to 0°C (so the heat of vaporization is used for that cooling), and then that 0°C water is melted to ice (which uses the heat of fusion). So all the heat from the condensation goes into melting ice.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the heat from the steam (when it condenses) is used to melt the ice. So the heat released is the sum of the heat of vaporization (for condensing the steam) and the heat of fusion (for melting the ice).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the steam is at 100°C, so when it condenses, it goes to water at 100°C. Then, that water cools to 0°C, because when you melt ice at 0°C, it's warming up. So the heat from condensation (which is the heat of vaporization) is used to cool the water from 100 to 0, and then that same heat is used to melt the ice.

So first, the steam condenses: that's 100g of steam → 100g of water at 100°C. Then, that 100g of water cools to 0°C, releasing heat. Then, that heat is used to melt ice. So the total heat available is the heat released during condensation (which is the heat of vaporization) plus the heat released when the water cools to 0°C.

Wait, no. Because if you're condensing steam at 100°C, the heat released is exactly the heat of vaporization. That's how much heat is given when you condense the steam. So the heat available is that amount, and that heat is used to melt the ice.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as: the heat from the steam condensing is 100g * 540 cal/g. So that's 54,000 calories (since 100g * 540 cal/g = 54,000 cal).

Then, the heat released when the water cools from 100°C to 0°C must be considered. So the heat is m * c * ΔT, where m is 100g, c is 1 cal/g°C (since water's specific heat is 1 cal/g°C), and ΔT is 100°C. So that's 100g * 1 cal/g°C * 100°C = 10,000 cal.

But wait, when you condense the steam, the heat is given, but when the water cools, it releases that heat. So the total heat available to melt ice is the heat of vaporization (54,000 cal) plus the heat released when it cools to 0°C (10,000 cal). So total heat is 64,000 cal.

Wait, no. Because when condensing, it's releasing heat, which is used to cool the water, which then melts into ice. So the heat from condensation is 54,000 cal, which is used to cool the water from 100 to 0. That's 10,000 cal. So 54,000 cal is the heat available to melt ice.

Because the heat from condensing (54,000 cal) is used to cool the water (100g, 100°C → 0°C, so 100 * 1 * 100 = 10,000 cal). So the remaining heat after cooling is 54,000 - 10,000 = 44,000 cal. But wait, that's not possible because the heat from condensation is 54,000, which is used to cool the water, which requires 10,000. So the heat available to melt the ice is 54,000 cal.

So, the heat available (Q) is 54,000 cal, and that's used to melt ice. The heat of fusion is 80 cal/g. So, to find the mass of ice, m = Q / (heat of fusion). So m = 54,000 cal / (80 cal/g) = 54,000 / 80.

Calculating that: 54,000 divided by 80. Let's see, 80 * 600 = 48,000. 54,000 - 48,000 = 6,000. 6,000 /80 =75. So 600 +75=675. So m=675 grams.

Wait, that's option C. So the answer should be C.

To determine how much ice can be melted at 0°C by the heat liberated from condensing 100 g of steam at 100°C, we analyze the heat transfer process:

1. **Heat of vaporization**: When 100 g of steam condenses at 100°C, it releases heat equal to the heat of vaporization, which is given as \( 540 \, \text{cal/g} \). Thus, the total heat released during condensation is:
   \[
   Q_{\text{condensation}} = 100 \, \text{g} \times 540 \, \text{cal/g} = 54,000 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

2. **Heat required to cool the water to 0°C**: After condensation, the water cools from 100°C to 0°C. The specific heat capacity of water is \( 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \), and the temperature change is \( \Delta T = 100 \, \text{°C} \). The heat released during this cooling is:
   \[
   Q_{\text{cooling}} = 100 \, \text{g} \times 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \times 100 \, \text{°C} = 10,000 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

3. **Heat available to melt ice**: The heat available to melt ice is the difference between the heat of condensation and the heat required to cool the water to 0°C:
   \[
   Q_{\text{available}} = Q_{\text{condensation}} - Q_{\text{cooling}} = 54,000 \, \text{cal} - 10,000 \, \text{cal} = 44,000 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

4. **Heat of fusion**: Melting ice at 0°C requires the heat of fusion, which is \( 80 \, \text{cal/g} \). The mass of ice that can be melted is calculated as:
   \[
   m = \frac{Q_{\text{available}}}{\text{heat of fusion}} = \frac{44,000 \, \text{cal}}{80 \, \text{cal/g}} = 550 \, \text{g}.
   \]

However, this calculation assumes that all the heat from condensation is used to melt ice, which is not accurate. Instead, the heat from condensation is used to cool the water to 0°C and then melt the ice. The correct approach is to use the total heat from condensation (54,000 cal) to melt ice, as the cooling step is part of the overall process. Thus:
   \[
   m = \frac{Q_{\text{condensation}}}{\text{heat of fusion}} = \frac{54,000 \, \text{cal}}{80 \, \text{cal/g}} = 675 \, \text{g}.
   \]

Therefore, the mass of ice that can be melted is \( 675 \, \text{g} \).
