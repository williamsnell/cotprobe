Okay, so I have this question about the World Bank data from Niger. The question is asking about the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think it through carefully.

Let me read the data again. In 1995, the poorest 20% accounted for 7.5% of income. Then the next 20% took home 11.8%. Middle 20% got 15.5%, and the top 20% had 44.1%. Wait, adding those up (7.5 + 11.8 = 19.3; 19.3 +15.5=34.8; 34.8+44.1=78.9%) I see that the top 40% (the last two brackets) account for a total of 78.9% of the income. But wait, the question is about the bottom 60% which would include the first two brackets and the next four brackets.

So the first 20% is 7.5%, the next 20% is 11.8%. So that's 7.5 +11.8 = 19.3%. Then the middle 20% is 15.5%, so adding that brings it to 19.3 +15.5 =34.8%. The next 20% is the top 40th, which is 44.1%. So the bottom 60% would be the first four brackets: 20% +20% +20% +20% = 80% of the population, but the total income share is 7.5+11.8+15.5+44.1= 78.9%. Wait, that's confusing. Because the total should be 100%, but adding those four brackets gives 78.9% for 80% of the population, which is 98.625% per person on average. Hmm, but that's a calculation mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the data. Each bracket is 20% of the population, but their income shares add up to a certain percentage. So the first 20% is 7.5% income. The next 20% is 11.8%, so up to 40% of the population, they've accounted for 7.5+11.8=19.3%. The middle 20% is 15.5%, so up to 60%, that's 19.3+15.5=34.8%. Then the top 20% is 44.1%, so up to 80% of the population, that's 34.8 +44.1=78.9%. So the bottom 60% (40% of the population) account for 34.8%. Then adding the next 20% which is the top 60% (but no, wait, the top 20% is the last bracket, so the bottom 60% would be the first four brackets, 7.5+11.8+15.5+44.1=78.9%. So the total is 78.9%, which is for 80% of the households. Wait, but the question is about the cumulative income share of the bottom 60%. Wait, noâ€”wait. Wait, the bottom 60% would be the first four brackets: 20% x4=80% of the population. But the income share is 7.5+11.8+15.5+44.1=78.9%? That can't be right because 7.5+11.8 is 19.3, +15.5 is 34.8, +44.1 is 78.9%. So 78.9% of the total income is the bottom 80% of the population. But the question asks about the bottom 60%. Wait, that seems conflicting. Oh wait, no. Wait, perhaps the way the data is presented is that each 20% bracket is the top 20%, next 20%, etc. So the first 20% is the poorest, next 20% the next poorest, etc. So the cumulative income for the bottom 60% would be the first four 20% brackets, which are 7.5+11.8+15.5+44.1=78.9%. So the answer would be 78.9%, but looking at the options, there's no 78.9. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-examine the data. The data shows:

- Poorest 20%: 7.5%

Next 20%:11.8%

Middle 20%:15.5%

Second richest 20% (so the next 20% after the middle):21.1%

Top 20%:44.1%

Wait, so the first 20% is the lowest, the next 20 is next, then middle, then the top 20%. So the cumulative for the bottom 60% would be the first four brackets, which sum to 7.5 +11.8 +15.5 +21.1 = 55.9%. Because 7.5 (poorest) +11.8 (next) +15.5 (middle) +21.1 (next) =55.9%. Wait, but in the data, the top 20% is 44.1%. So the next 20% after the middle would be the top 20%, which is 44.1. So the bottom 60% is the first four brackets: 7.5 +11.8 +15.5 +21.1= 55.9%. Looking at the options, option D is 56.40%, which is close. But wait, wait another thing: the user's data shows four brackets. Wait, the way the data is presented, the first 20% is 7.5, next 20% 11.8, next 20% 15.5, and the last 20% 44.1. So the bottom 60% is the first four brackets? No, because the first 20% is the first bracket, next 20% is the second, then third, then fourth. So the bottom 60% is the sum of these four brackets. So 7.5 +11.8 =19.3, +15.5=34.8, +21.1=55.9. So the cumulative is 55.9% in bottom 60%. But looking at the options, option D is 56.40%. Hmm, I don't see that in my calculation. I'm getting 55.9%.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct answer must be 56.40%. Let me double-check. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me re-express the data:

- 20% poorest:7.5%

- 20% next:11.8%

- 20% middle:15.5%

- 20% top:44.1%

So the first four brackets make 80% of the population, and the cumulative income for that is 7.5+11.8+15.5+21.1= 55.9%. Wait, no, because the top 20% is 44.1%, which is the last bracket. So the four brackets are 20% each, so the first four brackets are 7.5, 11.8,15.5,21.1. Summing those gives 7.5 +11.8=19.3, +15.5=34.8, +21.1=55.9%. So the total for the bottom 60% is 55.9%, but that's not an option. The closest option is D:56.40%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me see: The top 20% is 44.1%, so the next 20% (which would be the top 20%) is 44.1%. So the first four brackets are 7.5% +11.8% +15.5% +21.1% =55.9% for the bottom 80% of the population. Wait, but the question is about the bottom 60%, which is 80% of the population? Wait no, 60% is less than 80%, so it's the first four brackets. Wait, no, 60% is 4 brackets (since each is 20% of the population). Oh, wait, wait. Let me think again. If each bracket is 20% of the population, then the first 20% is the poorest, the next 20% is the next poorest, so the bottom 60% would consist of the first 4 brackets? Because 20% +20% +20% +20% =80% of the population. Wait, but the data is given as four brackets: the first (7.5), next (11.8), middle (15.5), and top 20% (44.1%). So the bottom 60% is 80% of the population, but the data only has four brackets. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the way to think is that each 20% bracket represents how much of the population is in that slice. So, the bottom 60% would include the first four brackets, but the fourth bracket is the top 20% which is 44.1%. So, the bottom 60% is made up of the first four brackets, their total income is 7.5 +11.8 +15.5 +21.1 =55.9%. But the options don't have 55.9. The options are: A:48.10, B:34.80, C:44.10, D:56.40, E:7.50, F:29.60, G:21.10, H:11.80, I:15.50, J:65.20.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the data is presented in a way that the first 20% is 7.5, the next 20% is 11.8, the middle 20% is 15.5, and the top 20% is 44.1. So the bottom 60% would consist of the first three brackets plus the next 20% of the population. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Oh wait, no. The bottom 60% is the first four brackets, because the first 20% is the poorest, next 20% next, then middle, then top. So the first four brackets sum to 7.5+11.8+15.5+21.1=55.9%. But 55.9 isn't in the options. The given options are up to 65.20%.

Wait another way: perhaps the data is presented as the bottom 20%, next 20%, then middle 20%, then top 20%. So the cumulative income up to the bottom 40% (because 20+20=40) is 7.5 +11.8=19.3. Then the next 20% is 15.5 (so up to 60% it's 19.3+15.5=34.8%), and the top 20% is 44.1%. So the bottom 60% is 34.8%, which is option B:34.80%. But the question asks for the cumulative income share of the bottom 60%, which would be 34.8% (option B). But wait, looking back, the question's wording: "cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households." So if the first 4 brackets (each 20%) add up to 7.5+11.8+15.5+21.1=55.9%, but perhaps the data I've taken is only four brackets, so I'm not adding the top 20% into the 60% portion. Wait, no, because the top 20% is the last bracket. So if I take the first four brackets (20% each), that's 80% of the population, but the question is about the bottom 60%. So 60% would be the first four brackets, but adding four brackets (7.5+11.8+15.5+21.1=55.9%). But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me recheck: The data says the poorest 20% is 7.5%, next 20% is 11.8, middle 20% is 15.5, and top 20% is 44.1%. So the four brackets together account for 7.5 +11.8 +15.5 +44.1 =78.9%. But that's for 80% of the population. So the bottom 60% is 80% of the population, but that's impossible since the entire population is 100%. Wait, no, the data is grouped by 20% each, so 4 brackets make up 80% of the population. So the question is about the bottom 60% of households, which is 60% of the population. So that's 60% of the population is 80% of the data (since each bracket is 20% of the population). So 60% of the population is 4*0.2=0.8 in 20% chunks.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the data is that the bottom 20% (7.5%) and the next 20% (11.8%) make up 19.3%, then the middle 20% (15.5%) brings it to 34.8%, and the top 20% (44.1%) brings it to 78.9%. So the cumulative up to the middle 20% is 34.8%. So the bottom 60% of the households would be the first three brackets: 20% +20% +20% =60% of the population. The cumulative income share would be 7.5 +11.8 +15.5=34.8%. So that would be option B.

The World Bank data provides the income distribution among households in Niger from 1995. The income shares for the poorest 20%, next 20%, middle 20%, and top 20% are 7.5%, 11.8%, 15.5%, and 44.1%, respectively. To find the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households, we need to sum the income shares of the first three brackets (each representing 20% of the population):

- First 20%: 7.5%  
- Next 20%: 11.8%  
- Middle 20%: 15.5%  

Adding these together:  
7.5 + 11.8 + 15.5 = 34.8%.  

Thus, the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households is **34.80%**, which corresponds to option B.
