Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about photon energy. Hmm, I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its frequency. Oh wait, right! The equation is E equals h times f, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency. I think Planck's constant is a fundamental constant, something like 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. But wait, sometimes I see it written differently with hbar, but I don't think that's the case here.

So the question gives me two frequencies: one for blue light and one for FM. Blue light has a higher frequency than FM, right? Because FM is higher, like around 10^8 Hz, and blue is like 10^14.

Wait, the blue light frequency is 7 × 10^14 Hz. FM is 1 × 10^8 Hz. Okay, so for each photon, I need to calculate E.

Let me write down the steps.

First, calculate the energy for blue light:
E_blue = h * f_blue
h is 6.626e-34 J·s, f_blue is 7e14 Hz.

So E_blue = 6.626e-34 * 7e14. Let me compute that. 6.626 * 7 is about 46.382. Then the exponents: 1e-34 * 1e14 is 1e-20. So 46.382e-20 J. Wait, but wait, 6.626e-34 multiplied by 7e14.

Wait, let me calculate that correctly. Let's see: 7e14 is 7 times 10^14. 6.626e-34 * 7e14 = (6.626 *7) * 10^(-34+14) = 46.382 *10^-20. Which is 4.6382e-19 J. Wait, so approximately 4.638e-19 J. But looking at the options, I see options like around 4.6e-19 J. Let's look for options with E_blue as 4.6e-19.

Wait, looking at the options, option I has E_blue as 2.9e-19. Hmm, maybe I did a miscalculation. Let me check.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *7e14. 6.626 * 7 is 46.382. 1e-34 * 1e14 is 1e-20. So 46.382e-20 is 4.6382e-19 J. So about 4.6e-19 J. Looking back at the options:

Option I: E_blue =2.9e-19, E_FM=9.9e-26. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the other options.

Wait, option G: E_blue=5e-19, E_FM=2.2e-26. Oh, but wait, blue light's E is 4.6e-19, which is not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake. Or maybe I'm using the wrong value for h.

Wait, what's the exact value of h? I think h is approximately 6.62607015e-34 J·s. But in the options, the values are precise. Let me compute the exact value for E_blue.

E_blue = 6.626e-34 *7e14.

Let me compute that numerically.

Multiply 6.626e-34 *7e14.

First, multiply 6.626 *7 = 46.382.

Then, 1e-34 *1e14 = 1e-20.

So 46.382e-20 = 4.6382e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option I has E_blue=2.9e-19, which is lower. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should compute E for FM.

Wait, the second part of the question is about FM radiation. FM's frequency is 1e8 Hz.

E_FM = h *f_FM =6.626e-34 *1e8 = 6.626e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option F: E_FM=5e-26 J. Close but not exact. Option I also has E_FM=9.9e-26.

Wait, so the E values are:

E_blue =4.638e-19 J.

E_FM=6.626e-26 J.

Looking at the options, the closest match would be option I: E_blue=2.9e-19, E_FM=9.9e-26. Hmm, but wait option I's E_FM is 9.9e-26, which is bigger than 6.6e-26. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each value more accurately.

Let me recompute E_blue:

f_blue =7e14 Hz.

E_blue =6.626e-34 *7e14.

6.626 *7 =46.382.

Exponents: 1e-34 *1e14 =1e-20.

So 46.382e-20 =4.6382e-19 J.

Looking at the options: options with E_blue around 4.6e-19.

Looking at the options:

Option I: E_blue=2.9e-19, E_FM=9.9e-26.

No, that's not matching.

Option G: E_blue=5e-19, E_FM=2.2e-26.

Hmm, 5e-19 is higher than our calculated 4.638e-19. So perhaps the correct option isn't in the options provided. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should check the other options to see if any fit.

Let me go through each option and compute E_blue and E_FM.

Option A: E_blue=1.2e-20, E_FM=3.3e-27.

Compute E_FM for 1e8 Hz:

6.626e-34 *1e8 =6.626e-26 J. So 3.3e-27 is way too low. So A is incorrect.

Option B: E_blue=5.8e-18, E_FM=7.2e-25.

E_FM for 1e8 Hz is 6.6e-26. So 7.2e-25 is way higher than 6.6e-26. So B is wrong.

Option C: E_blue=3.6e-18, E_FM=7.7e-25.

Wait, E_FM for 1e8 is 6.6e-26, so 7.7e-25 is 12.5 times higher. So no.

Option D: E_blue=6.2e-18, E_FM=4.4e-25.

E_FM is 6.6e-26. So 4.4e-25 is 6.7 times larger. No.

Option E: E_blue=4.6e-19, E_FM=6.6e-26. Wait, E_FM for 1e8 is 6.6e-26. So E_FM is 6.6e-26. So option E is E_blue=4.6e-19, E_FM=6.6e-26. But wait, in our calculation, E_blue is 4.6e-19 and E_FM is 6.6e-26. But option E's E_FM is 6.6e-26, which matches. However, the E_blue in option E is 4.6e-19. But earlier, I thought E_blue was 4.6e-19, so option E's E_blue is 4.6e-19, but option I has E_blue=2.9e-19. So which is correct? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of E_blue.

E_blue =6.626e-34 *7e14.

6.626 *7 is 46.382.

1e-34 *1e14 is 1e-20.

So 46.382e-20 =4.6382e-19 J, which is approximately 4.64e-19 J. So the correct E_blue is around 4.6e-19.

Looking at the options:

Option I: E_blue=2.9e-19. No match.

Option E: E_blue=4.6e-19. E_FM=6.6e-26. So that's exactly what we calculated. But wait, looking at the options, option E has E_FM=6.6e-26, which matches, and E_blue=4.6e-19, which also matches. So option E is E_blue=4.6e-19 J and E_FM=6.6e-26 J. But wait, in the options, E is option E: 4.6e-19 and 6.6e-26.

But wait, looking at the options, the E_FM for 1e8 is 6.626e-26 J. So option E's E_FM is correct. However, wait: in the options, the E values are:

Option I's E_FM is 9.9e-26, which is higher than 6.6e-26. So E's E_FM would be 6.6e-26, but that matches E's E_FM.

Wait, but the E blue in E is 4.6e-19. However, I thought earlier that the blue light's E is about 4.6e-19 and FM's E is 6.6e-26. But if that's the case, option E would be correct. But looking at the options, E's E_blue is 4.6e-19 and E_FM is 6.6e-26. So that's correct.

But wait, the options don't have any options where E_blue is 4.6e-19 and E_FM is 6.6e-26. Wait, let's look again:

Wait, the options are A to I, with each option having two energies. Let me check each option:

Option B: 5.8e-18, 7.2e-25. E_FM is too low.

Option E: I say E is correct with E_blue=4.6e-19, E_FM=6.6e-26.

But looking at the options, that matches E's E_FM. But the blue's E is 4.6e-19, not 2.9e-19 as in option I.

Wait, but the options' E values are:

Looking at the E values in the options:

Option A: E_blue 1.2e-20, E_FM 3.3e-27.

Option B: E_blue 5.8e-18, E_FM 7.2e-25.

Option C: E_blue 3.6e-18, E_FM 7.7e-25.

Option D: E_blue 6.2e-18, E_FM 4.4e-25.

Option E: E_blue 4.6e-19, E_FM 6.6e-26.

Option F: E_blue 7.5e-19, E_FM 5e-26.

Option G: E_blue 5e-19, E_FM 2.2e-26.

Option H: E_blue 4.1e-19, E_FM 1.1e-25.

Option I: E_blue 2.9e-19, E_FM 9.9e-26.

So, the correct E_blue is 4.6e-19, which matches option E. However, the E_FM for option E is 6.6e-26, which is correct because for 1e8 Hz, E is 6.6e-26 J.

But wait, looking at the options, option I's E_FM is 9.9e-26, which is a bit higher, but perhaps I should reevaluate whether I'm using the correct values.

Wait, perhaps I should consider if the frequency was for FM, which is 1e8 Hz, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me calculate E for the FM.

E_FM = h * f_FM.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

f_FM=1e8 Hz.

So E_FM =6.626e-34 * 1e8 = 6.626e-26 J.

Looking at the options, the FM energy for each option:

Option E's E_FM is 6.6e-26, which matches exactly.

But the blue light E is 4.6e-19, not 2.9e-19 as in option I. So option E is correct.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where E_blue is 4.6e-19 and E_FM is 6.6e-26. Because looking at the options, E is the only one with E_FM=6.6e-26. So perhaps the correct answer is option E, but I thought the E_blue in option E is 4.6e-19, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but in the options, the E values are:

Option I's E_blue is 2.9e-19, which is a lower value, which would correspond to a lower frequency.

Wait, but the blue light's frequency is 7e14 Hz, which gives E_blue of about 4.6e-19 J, which is higher than option E's 4.6e-19, which is correct.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where both E_blue and E_FM are correct. Looking at the options, the correct E values are 4.6e-19 and 6.6e-26. But there isn't an option with E_blue=4.6e-19 and E_FM=6.6e-26.

Wait, let me look at the options again:

Option E: E_blue=4.6e-19, E_FM=6.6e-26. So that would be correct. But the options provided only have E as the correct pair.

Wait, but in the given choices, option E is the correct one. So the correct answer would be E.

But wait, looking at the initial options, option E's E_FM is 6.6e-26, which is correct for 1e8 Hz. And E_blue is 4.6e-19, which is correct for 7e14 Hz.

So the correct pair is E.

Wait, but looking at the user's problem statement, the options are options A to I, and each option offers two energies. So the correct option is E.

To determine the energy of a photon for blue light (frequency \( f_{\text{blue}} = 7 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz} \)) and FM radiation (frequency \( f_{\text{FM}} = 1 \times 10^8 \, \text{Hz} \)), we use the equation for the energy of a photon:

\[
E = h \cdot f
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( h \approx 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).

### Calculations:
1. **Energy of blue light (\( E_{\text{blue}} \)):**
   \[
   E_{\text{blue}} = h \cdot f_{\text{blue}} = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (7 \times 10^{14})
   \]
   \[
   E_{\text{blue}} = 4.6382 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \approx 4.64 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Energy of FM radiation (\( E_{\text{FM}} \)):**
   \[
   E_{\text{FM}} = h \cdot f_{\text{FM}} = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (1 \times 10^8)
   \]
   \[
   E_{\text{FM}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \approx 6.63 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Matching with Options:
- The calculated values are \( E_{\text{blue}} \approx 4.64 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) and \( E_{\text{FM}} \approx 6.63 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \).
- Among the provided options, **option E** matches these values:
  - \( E_{\text{blue}} = 4.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)
  - \( E_{\text{FM}} = 6.6 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)

### Conclusion:
The correct option is **E**, as it provides the correct energy values for blue light and FM radiation.
