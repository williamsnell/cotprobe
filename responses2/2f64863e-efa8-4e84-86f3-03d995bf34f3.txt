Question:

C: they involved short, simple sentences with a small vocabulary
D: they discouraged creativity and original thought
E: they referred to explicit, context independent meanings
F: they led to poor performance on standardized tests
G: they were difficult for teachers to understand

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Bernstein's view on restricted codes in language education. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the question is about a concept in language education, probably related to differentiated instruction or something similar. I think restricted codes refer to a teaching method where students are grouped based on their language proficiency levels, with each group receiving materials that are appropriate for their age and language skills. The idea is to tailor instruction so that each child's language needs are met.

Now, the options are A to G. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says they prevented communication outside their peer groups. I'm not sure. I thought restricted codes were more about grouping, not about communication. So maybe A isn't the right answer.

Option B suggests they made them the target of bullying. That doesn't seem right. I don't recall Bernstein making any claims about bullying based on this teaching method.

Option C claims they involved short, simple sentences with a small vocabulary. That sounds like a common approach in differentiated instruction, where materials are simpler for weaker students. So this might be a possibility.

Option D says they discouraged creativity and original thought. I don't think restricted codes were about creativity. They were more about teaching specific skills based on language level.

Option E mentions explicit, context-independent meanings. I'm not sure about this one. Explicit might refer to clear communication, but context-independent might relate to something else, like universal language features. I'm not certain about this.

Option F states they led to poor performance on standardized tests. I don't recall Bernstein making that claim about this method.

Option G says they were hard for teachers to understand. That's a bit strange. I think Bernstein was a proponent of teaching methods that are easy to understand, especially in multilingual settings. So this might not be the correct answer.

Putting this together, the most likely option is C. Bernstein likely used restricted codes to teach students progressively more complex language skills, allowing weaker students to grasp the basics without feeling overwhelmed. Short sentences and a small vocabulary would make the language simpler and more manageable for those who are still learning.

The correct answer is C: they involved short, simple sentences with a small vocabulary. This aligns with the idea of teaching language skills in a structured, group-based approach, preventing overwhelming weaker students. 

Answer: C
