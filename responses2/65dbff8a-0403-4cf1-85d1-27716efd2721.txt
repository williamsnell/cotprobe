The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Why would you not expect conjugation among a group of paramecia that had descended from a single individual through repeated fission?

Options:

A: Conjugation is prevented by the presence of a dominant allele
B: Conjugation results in lesser genetic diversity
C: Conjugation can occur among identical organisms
D: All individuals are identical genetically, and conjugation could not occur.
E: Conjugation does not require different mating types
F: Conjugation among paramecia is limited by their lifecycle and can only happen at certain stages
G: Paramecia are incapable of conjugation due to their single-celled nature
H: Conjugation is a form of reproduction that results in genetically identical offspring
I: Conjugation requires a special organ that paramecia do not possess
J: Conjugation only occurs in stressful environmental conditions

Okay, so I've got this question about conjugation in paramecia. Let me think through this. I remember that conjugation is a process where bacteria share genetic material, right? Like, when they divide and transfer plasmids. But wait, the question is about paramecia, which are a type of bacteria. So I'm thinking, why would conjugation not happen among them?

The paramecia descended from a single individual via fission, which I think is the process of dividing into two cells. So each time they split, they'd have one more cell, right? But conjugation involves exchanging genetic material between cells. So if they're all descended from a single one, maybe they're all genetically identical already. Because if they were descended from different individuals, maybe they'd have different alleles, but here they're all from the same lineage.

Wait, but I think conjugation is more about sharing plasmids between different cells. So if all the paramecia are from the same lineage, they might have the same alleles. So conjugation wouldn't occur because there's no variation to pass on. That makes sense.

Looking at the options, option G says that paramecia are incapable of conjugation due to their single-celled nature. That sounds right because conjugation is a process that's more about sharing genetic material, like plasmids. Single-celled organisms don't have the same mechanisms as multi-celled ones. Or wait, maybe conjugation is a form of sexual reproduction in bacteria, but it's a type of conjugation, which is a form of asexual reproduction. But in any case, the key is about genetic exchange.

So the main point is that all paramecia descend from a single ancestor, so they're all genetically identical. Conjugation requires variation between individuals to pass on genes, so without that, it wouldn't happen.

So the correct answer should be G.

The correct answer is G.

**Explanation:** Conjugation in bacteria, including paramecia, relies on genetic exchange between cells. Since all paramecia descend from a single individual, they are genetically identical. This lack of genetic variation prevents conjugation from occurring. 

**Answer:** G
