Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem again.

The question is about the number of different genotypic combinations possible in a population considering three loci: ABO, Rh, and MN. Each locus has multiple alleles. The ABO locus has 6 alleles, the Rh has 8, and the MN has 4. Also, each locus is independent of the others, so I can probably multiply the possibilities for each locus together.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. The number of alleles per locus is given, but do I need to consider the number of possible alleles each individual can have at each locus? Because each individual is diploid, right? So for each locus, each individual has two alleles, so the number of possible combinations for that locus would be the number of possible alleles multiplied by the number of possible alleles for the other locus? Or is it the sum or product?

Wait, no. Because for each locus, each individual has two alleles. So for a locus with 'n' alleles, the number of possible allele combinations is n+1 (since each individual can have any one of the n alleles, plus the possibility of having the same allele twice, but wait, no, because each individual has two alleles. So for a locus with m alleles, the possible combinations for the individual's two alleles would be m^2, but wait, no— that's if the two can be the same. But wait, the number of possible genotypic combinations is the number of possible pairs of alleles that can be passed. So for each locus, the number of possible genotypes is (m choose 2) + m (if considering same alleles) or just m^2 (if considering order doesn't matter and same alleles are allowed). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of possible allele pairs.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. For a locus with m alleles, how many possible genotypes are there? For a diploid individual, the two alleles can be the same (like AA) or different (like AB, AC, etc.). The number of possible genotypes is (m+1) * (m+2)/2? No, wait—no, that's combinations. Alternatively, for two alleles, the number of possible combinations when considering order (like AB and BA as different) is (m+1) choose 2, which is (m+1)(m+2)/2. Or if order doesn't matter, then it's (m+1)(m)/2 + m (since same alleles are counted once). Wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think that for a locus with m alleles, each individual can have any of the m alleles for each of the two positions. So the number of possible genotypes is m × m = m². But wait, that would count AA, AB, AC, etc., but when considering that AB and BA are the same genotype, that's not correct. But wait, in diploidy, the genotype is determined by the two alleles, regardless of order. So how many possible distinct genotypes are there? Let's think: for a locus with m alleles, the possible genotypes are the number of unique pairs, considering that AA is one, AB is another, AC, etc., but not AB and BA. So the number of possible genotypes is m + (m choose 2). Wait, that might not be right either.

Wait, no. Let me think of a simple example. Let's say a locus has alleles A, B, C. For diploid, the possible genotypes are AA, AB, AC, BA, BB, BC, CA, CB, CC. That's 9 possible genotypes. Alternatively, in terms of possible combinations, when considering that AB and BA are the same, it's 6. But wait, the question is about the number of different genotypic combinations, which includes all possible allele pairs, including same and different. So for a locus with m alleles, the number of possible genotypes is m(m + 1)/2. Wait no, wait. Let's think: the number of possible genotypes is the number of possible combinations for two alleles. Each position can be any of the m alleles, so the total is m × m = m². But in reality, when the two are the same, that's only one case. But wait, that's not the case because each individual has two alleles, so for example, AA is one genotype, AB is another, etc. But in reality, when a locus has m alleles, the number of possible genotypes is (m × (m + 1))/2. Because for each possible pair, including both orders. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of possible combinations with possible repetition. So for a locus with m alleles, the number of possible genotypes is m^2, but that's including all possible ordered pairs. But in reality, the genotype is determined by the combination, regardless of order. So in reality, the number of possible genotypes is (m + 1) * m / 2 when considering that each genotype is a pair without considering order, but that doesn't make sense because you can have same alleles. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternative approach: Let's think in terms of the number of possible genotype combinations. For a locus with m alleles, each individual has two alleles, so the number of possible genotype combinations is m^2, because each allele can be any of m possibilities. But wait, that would count AA, AB, etc., but without considering that AB and BA are same. No, that's not correct. Wait, maybe the question is about the number of possible genotypic combinations, considering that each individual is diploid. So for a locus with m alleles, each individual has two alleles, so the number of possible genotype combinations is m × m = m². But when considering that having two different alleles is the same as the reverse, but wait, no, in diploid organisms, each individual's genotype is determined by their two alleles, but if the two are different, it's the same as the reverse. For example, AB is the same as BA. So the number of possible genotypes is m × (m + 1)/2 if you consider that same alleles are one, but wait no— that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I've got this wrong. Let's think of a locus with m alleles. Each individual has two alleles, so the number of possible genotypes is m × m = m². But wait, this includes all possible pairs, including same alleles (like AA) and different ones (AB, AC, etc.). So for a locus with m alleles, the number of possible genotypes is m². Because each of the two alleles can be any of the m alleles. So for example, for m=2, you have AA, AB, BA (which is same as AB), and BB. So that's 3 possible genotypes. Wait, wait, no. Wait, if m=2, the possible genotypes are AA, AB/BA, and BB. So that's 3, which is 2^2 =4, but minus one because AB and BA are the same. So the number of possible genotypes is m^2, but not counting AB twice. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is that each locus's genotype is determined by the two alleles, regardless of order. So the number of possible genotypes is the number of possible combinations of two alleles, where order doesn't matter and same alleles are allowed. So the formula for this is (m + 1) choose 2 + m. Wait, that's incorrect. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the number of possible genotypes as (m + 1) × (m + 2)/2. No, that seems too complex. Alternatively, perhaps it's (m × (m + 1))/2 + m. Wait, that might not be right either. Maybe I should think of it as (m + 1 choose 2), which is the number of combinations with two alleles, allowing for same alleles. Wait no, that's not correct. Because (m +1 choose 2) would be the number of possible unordered pairs, including same elements. Like for m=2, it's (2+1)(2+2)/2=3, but that's not correct because when m=2, possible genotypes are AA, AB, BB. So three possibilities, which matches (2+1 choose 2) is 3, which is correct. Wait, (2+1 choose 2) is 3. So for m=3 alleles, the number would be (3+1 choose 2) = 6. Let's see, for m=3, possible genotypes are AA, AB, AC, BA, BB, BC, CA, CB, CC. Wait, but that's 9 possibilities. So (3+1 choose 2) is 6, which is less than 9. So that approach is wrong.

Ah, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the way the genotypes are counted. Because for each locus, each individual has two alleles, so the genotype is determined by the two alleles. So the number of possible genotype combinations is m × m = m². But this includes all possible pairs, including same alleles. So for example, when m=2, you can have AA, AB, BA, BB, which are four possibilities. But wait, in a diploid organism, AB and BA are not two different genotypes but are the same. So for the sake of this problem, how are the genotypes counted? Do we count each individual's genotype, including whether the two alleles are same or different, or do we consider that AB and BA are the same?

Hmm, the question says "genotypic combinations", so I think each individual's genotype is considered a combination, and that includes the possibility of AA, AB, AC, etc., regardless of the order of the alleles. So the number of possible genotypes is the number of possible pairs, including same alleles. So for a locus with m alleles, the number of possible genotypes is m × m = m². But wait, no, because when m=2, that would be 4, but in reality, genotype possibilities are AA, AB, BA, BB, which is 3. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because in a diploid organism, each individual has two alleles. So the genotype is determined by the two, but since order doesn't matter, the number of possible genotypes is the number of unique combinations. So for example, for m=2, the possible genotypes are AA, AB (since BA is same as AB), and BB. So three possibilities, which is (2 + 2 -1) = 3. Wait, that's a formula I've heard before. Wait, the formula for combinations with repetition is (n + k -1) choose k, where n is the number of types (alleles) and k is the number to choose. So here, n=2, k=2. So (2 + 2 -1) choose 2 = 3 choose 2 =3. That's correct.

So applying the same formula, the number of possible genotypes for a locus with m alleles is (m + 2 -1) choose 2 = (m+1 choose 2). So for m=2, (2+1 choose 2) = 3, which matches. For m=3, it's (3+1 choose 2)=6, but that's not matching our earlier calculation. Wait, no, because with m=3, the possible genotypes are 9 (AA, AB, AC, BA, BB, BC, CA, CB, CC). But according to the formula (m+1 choose 2) = 6, which is less than 9. So that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the correct formula is m(m+1)/2 when considering that each genotype is a pair without considering order, but that doesn't make sense because you can have same alleles.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: each individual has two alleles. So for a locus with m alleles, the number of possible genotype types is m × (m + 1)/2. But that's not correct because for m=2, that would be 3, which is correct. Wait, 2*(2+1)/2 is 3. For m=3, that would be 6. But earlier, I thought for m=3, the number of possible genotypes would be 9 because each of the 3 alleles can be paired with any of the 3, including same. But that's incorrect because in reality, the two alleles may be same or different. Wait, no, in reality, the number of possible genotype types is m × (m + 1)/2. Let’s see:

Wait, for m=2, it's (2 ×3)/2 =3. Correct.

For m=3, (3×4)/2=6. Is that correct? Let's list them:

AA, AB, AC, BA, BB, BC, CA, CB, CC. Wait, that's more than 6. Oh wait, no— I'm including BA as a separate genotype. Wait, no, because when considering that AB and BA are same, then the count should be 6. So for m=3, the number of genotype types is 6. But when m=3, the actual number of possible genotype types is 9 because you have AA, AB, AC, BA (same as AB), BB, BC, CA (same as AC), CB (same as BC), CC. So that's 9, but that's including same alleles. So maybe my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the order of the alleles matters. If the two alleles are considered the same when order doesn't matter, then the number of genotype types is (m + 1) choose 2, which is m(m+1)/2. But that doesn't account for same alleles. Alternatively, perhaps the number of genotype types is (m+1) choose 2 + m. Which would be the number of unordered pairs and same alleles.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to calculate is:

The number of possible genotype types for a locus is the number of possible combinations of two alleles, allowing for same alleles. So that's (m + 1) choose 2, which is (m+1)(m)/2. Wait, that's the same as m(m+1)/2. But for m=2, that's 3, which is correct. For m=3, that's 6. So in that case, for a locus with m alleles, the number of possible genotypes is (m+1)(m)/2. But earlier, when thinking of m=3, I thought there were 9 possible genotype types. That suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the key is that each locus's genotype is determined by the two alleles, regardless of order. So for a locus with m alleles, the number of possible genotype types is (m × (m+1))/2. Wait, for m=2, this is 3, which is correct. For m=3, the number is 6. But in reality, when I list them out, I have 9 possibilities: AA, AB, AC, BA, BB, BC, CA, CB, CC. But that includes same alleles. So perhaps the proper way is to count all possible pairs, including same alleles. So the number is m^2. But wait, no, because that would count each same allele pair twice. For example, AA is one, AB is another, and BA is the same as AB. So the number of genotype types is (m × (m + 1))/2, which would be the same as (m+1 choose 2). For m=2, that's (3 choose 2) =3, correct. For m=3, (4 choose 2)=6, but then that's the number of unordered pairs, including same alleles. But that doesn't fit with the actual number of possible genotype types. Wait, because for m=3, AA, AB, AC, BA is same as AB, BB, BC, CA is same as AC, CC. So that's 6 types, which matches (3+1 choose 2)=6. So yes, the correct number is (m+1 choose 2) or (m+1)m/2.

Wait, but earlier when I thought m=3, I thought there were 9 possible genotype types. That seems to contradict this. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose the locus has three alleles: A, B, C. Each individual has two alleles. The possible genotype types are:

AA, AB, AC, BA, BB, BC, CA, CB, CC.

When considering that AB and BA are the same genotype, the unique types are:

AA, AB, AC, BB, BC, CC.

Because BA is the same as AB, which is already included as AB. So wait, that's 6 types, not 9. So the correct number of genotype types for m=3 is 6, which is (3+1 choose 2) =6.

Wait, but earlier I thought there were 9 possibilities, but that's when considering each possible pair, including same as different. Oh no, wait! No, because in reality, when considering genotype types, AB and BA are considered the same. So the correct number is 6, not 9. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the number of genotypic combinations is (m+1 choose 2) = (m+1)m/2.

So, that's the key. So for each locus, the number of possible genotype types is (m+1 choose 2). So the number is (m+1)*m / 2.

Okay, now applying this to the problem.

The ABO locus has 6 alleles. So the number of genotype types is (6+1) *6 /2 = 7*6/2 = 21.

The Rh locus has 8 alleles. So the number of genotype types is (8+1)*8/2 =9*8/2= 36.

The MN locus has 4 alleles. So the number is (4+1)*4/2 =5*4/2=10.

Wait, wait. Because for each locus, the number of possible genotype types is (m+1)*m/2. So:

ABO: (6+1)*6/2 = 7*3=21.

Wait, 6+1 is 7, multiplied by 6 is 42, divided by 2 is 21.

Rh: (8+1)*8/2 =9*4=36.

MN: (4+1)*4/2=5*2=10.

Wait, no, wait. (4+1) is 5. 5*4 is 20. Divided by 2 is 10.

So for each locus, the number of possible genotype types is ABO=21, Rh=36, MN=10.

But wait, no, that can't be right because the total number of possible genotypic combinations is the product of these numbers. Because each individual's genotype is determined by the choices at each locus.

So the total number is 21 (ABO) × 36 (Rh) × 10 (MN) = ?

Let me calculate that.

21 ×36 = 756.

756 ×10 =7560.

So the total number of possible genotypic combinations is 7560.

Wait, but looking at the options provided, option E is 7560. So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought that the number of genotype types for a locus with m alleles is (m+1 choose 2). But that gives the correct number of types as (m+1)m/2. So for ABO (m=6), it's 21. For Rh (m=8), it's 36. For MN (m=4), it's 10. So the product is 21 ×36 ×10=7560.

So the answer is E) 7560.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 36

B) 84

C) 64

D) 21

E) 7560

So the correct option is E.

Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure what the question is asking. It says, "how many genotype combinations are there?" So the answer is 7560, which is option E.

So putting it all together, the three loci each contribute a certain number of possible genotype types, and the total combinations is the product of those numbers.

So the answer is E) 7560.
</think>

To determine the total number of genotype combinations, we analyze each locus's contribution:

1. **ABO Locus (6 Alleles):**  
   The number of possible genotype types is calculated as (m+1) choose 2, where m=6.  
   \[
   \text{ABO types} = \frac{6+1}{2} \times 6 = 21
   \]

2. **Rh Locus (8 Alleles):**  
   Similarly, the number of genotype types is:  
   \[
   \text{Rh types} = \frac{8+1}{2} \times 8 = 36
   \]

3. **MN Locus (4 Alleles):**  
   The number of genotype types is:  
   \[
   \text{MN types} = \frac{4+1}{2} \times 4 = 10
   \]

The total number of genotype combinations is the product of these values:  
\[
\text{Total combinations} = 21 \times 36 \times 10 = 7560
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **E) 7560**.  

ANSWER: E
