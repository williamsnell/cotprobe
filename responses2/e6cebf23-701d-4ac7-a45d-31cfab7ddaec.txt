(2) In 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage on the ranch. (3) In 2007, in a signed writing, which the borrower delivered to his daughter, the borrower promised to convey the ranch to the daughter by a quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically regarding mortgage contracts and whose rights are retained after a default. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The scenario is about a mortgage agreement where a borrower mortgages a property to a mortgage company. The key events are:

1. 1993: The borrower mints a note for $25,000 due December 31, 1993, with a 9V2% interest rate. So this is the initial mortgage, right? The borrower is the lender, the mortgage company is the obligor.

2. 1996: The mortgage company records the mortgage. Well, recording in property law usually refers to recording the mortgage note, but in this context, maybe it's about the mortgage being transferred to the buyer. But wait, the initial note was mortgaged to the borrower, so perhaps the recording is about transferring the note to the buyer.

3. 2007: The borrower delivers a quitclaim deed to his daughter. A quitclaim deed conveys the property to the grantor (the mortgage company) without assigning the title. So the mortgage company is taking the property from the borrower and giving it to his daughter.

4. 2008: The borrower delivers a quitclaim deed to the daughter without mentioning the mortgage debt. Wait, the original agreement was for the mortgage, so the daughter didn't make a promise to pay it. So she just took the property, but no obligation to pay.

Now, the question is about the mortgagee (the mortgage company) suing the daughter for the default on the mortgage. The options are about whether the action will succeed or fail.

Let me think about the mortgagee's rights. In property law, the mortgage company, as the obligor, has certain rights. When the mortgage is taken out, the mortgagee has the right to claim the proceeds if the mortgagee fails to pay, but only if certain conditions are met.

One of the key points is whether the mortgagee has the right to seek payment from any party, especially if a subsequent quitclaim deed was made. There's a concept called "fixation" and "implied delegation." The mortgagee can sometimes be seen as having the authority to seek payment from parties that are either the original grantor (the borrower) or the original obligor (the mortgage company).

Wait, another important thing is whether the mortgagee has the right to proceed if the mortgagee fails to pay despite the original agreement. There's a principle called "the mortgagee has the right to seek payment from any party associated with the property unless the original agreement provides otherwise." So if the mortgagee fails to pay, the mortgagee can collect from the original grantor or the original obligor.

In the scenario, the mortgage was granted by the mortgage company to the borrower. The mortgagee (the company) has the right to collect from the original mortgagee (the borrower). But in the scenario, the borrower later conveyed the property to the daughter without any mention of the mortgage. So the daughter took the property, but the mortgagee didn't have any obligation to pay.

So, if the mortgage was originally taken out by the mortgage company, then the mortgagee can collect from the original grantor or the original obligor. But in this case, the original obligor is the mortgage company. So the mortgagee, as the obligor, would have the right to collect from the original mortgagee (the borrower) if the mortgage is not paid.

Wait, but in the scenario, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage in 1996, before the 2007 quitclaim deed. So the mortgage was in place when the daughter took the property. The mortgagee (the company) can collect from the original grantor (the borrower) if they fail to pay.

But in the scenario, the original mortgage was taken out by the mortgage company, not by the borrower. So the mortgagee (the company) can collect from the original mortgagee (the borrower) even if the mortgage company didn't own it. But wait, in reality, the mortgagee is tied to the original mortgagee—so the mortgagee (company) would have the right to collect from the original mortgagee (the borrower). So the mortgagee, as the obligor, should be able to collect from the original mortgagee even if the original mortgagee later conveyed the property to the daughter without any obligation.

But in the scenario, the original mortgage was taken out by the mortgage company, and the mortgagee can collect from the original mortgagee. But in the case where the mortgagee fails to pay, the mortgage company can sue the original mortgagee. So the mortgagee would have the right to collect from the original mortgagee, and thus from the original grantor as the original mortgagee.

Wait, but the mortgagee is the obligor, not the original grantor. The original grantor is the borrower, who had the mortgage. So the mortgagee (the company) can collect from the original mortgagee (the borrower) if the mortgage is not paid. So the mortgagee (the company) can sue the original mortgagee (the borrower) for the default. But wait, the scenario says the borrower took the property to his daughter in 2007, and the daughter made a quitclaim deed without the mortgage. So the mortgagee (the company) didn't have any obligation to pay because the mortgage was transferred to the daughter, without any promise to pay. So the mortgagee, as the obligor, would have the right to proceed if the mortgage fails.

Wait, but the mortgage was taken out by the mortgage company before the daughter took the property. So the mortgagee (the company) can collect from the original mortgagee (the borrower). So the mortgagee is the obligor and can collect from the original mortgagee (the borrower) for any failure to pay.

So if the mortgagee (the company) fails to pay, can they collect from the original mortgagee (the borrower), even though the mortgagee is the obligor for the original agreement?

Yes, because the mortgagee is the one who is the original obligor for the mortgage. The mortgagee can collect from the original mortgagee if the original mortgage is in effect and the mortgagee fails to pay.

But wait, in the original scenario, the mortgage was taken out by the mortgage company, not by the borrower. So the mortgagee (the company) is the obligor of the original mortgage. So the mortgagee can collect from the original mortgagee (the borrower) if the original mortgage is not paid.

But in the case of a subsequent transfer, the original mortgagee takes the property, but the original mortgagee doesn't have any obligation to pay. So the mortgagee (the company) would have the right to seek payment from the original mortgagee (the borrower) if the original mortgage fails. So if the borrower later conveyed the property to the daughter, but the mortgagee (the company) hasn't paid, then the mortgagee can proceed against the original mortgagee.

So, in the scenario, the mortgage was taken out by the mortgage company in 1993. The original mortgagee was the borrower, who took the property in 1993. The mortgagee recorded the mortgage in 1996, which is when the mortgage was taken out. Then, in 2007, the original mortgagee conveyed the property to the daughter via a quitclaim deed. But the mortgagee didn't have any obligation to pay, because the original mortgage was already in the original grantor's hands (the borrower) and the mortgagee is the obligor of that original mortgage.

Therefore, the mortgagee (the company) can collect from the original mortgagee (the borrower) for any failure to pay. So the mortgagee, as the obligor, can sue the original mortgagee for the default.

So looking at the options:

Option B: succeed because mortgage company has the right to seek payment from any party associated with the property.

Option G: not succeed because the daughter only promised the property, not the debt.

Wait, the question is about the mortgage company bringing an action against the daughter. So the daughter didn't promise to pay the mortgage. She just conveyed the property to the daughter.

So, the right of the mortgagee (the company) is to seek payment from the original mortgagee (the borrower), but the daughter wasn't the original mortgagee. So the mortgagee can't sue the daughter, only the original mortgagee.

So, the mortgagee (the company) would have the right to seek payment from the original mortgagee, but the original mortgagee didn't make any promise to pay (he conveyed the property but didn't promise to pay the mortgage).

So the original mortgagee was the original mortgagee (the borrower), so the mortgagee (company) can collect from the borrower (original mortgagee) for the failure.

So the mortgagee would have the right to collect. Therefore, the mortgagee might succeed.

Looking at the options, option B says the mortgagee will succeed because it has the right to seek payment from any party associated with the property.

Option G says the daughter didn't promise to pay, so the action wouldn't succeed. But the company can proceed against the original mortgagee, who is the original mortgagee, so the mortgagee can collect.

Wait, but the mortgagee is the obligor of the original agreement. So the mortgagee can proceed against the original mortgagee for the failure. So the mortgagee can collect against the original mortgagee, but the original mortgagee didn't make any promise (he conveyed the property but didn't pay the debt). So the mortgagee can proceed to collect from the original mortgagee.

So in that case, the mortgagee (the company) can collect from the original mortgagee (the borrower), so they might win.

Looking at the options:

Option B: succeeds because the mortgage company has the right to seek payment from any party associated with the property.

Option G: not succeed because the daughter didn't promise to pay.

So the correct reasoning is that the mortgagee (the company) can collect from the original mortgagee (the borrower) for the failure to pay. Therefore, the action would succeed.

So the correct answer is B.

The question revolves around property law, specifically the rights and obligations of a mortgagee (the company) in a mortgage agreement. The key events are as follows:

1. **1993**: A borrower mortgages a property to a mortgage company for $25,000, due December 31, 1993, with a 9V2% interest rate. The mortgage company records the mortgage in 1996.
2. **2007**: The borrower transfers the property to his daughter via a quitclaim deed, without any mention of the mortgage debt.
3. **2008**: The borrower delivers a quitclaim deed to the daughter, but there is no obligation for the daughter to pay the mortgage.

The mortgagee (the company) has the right to seek payment from the original mortgagee (the borrower) if the original mortgage fails. However, the original mortgagee (the borrower) did not promise to pay the mortgage. Instead, he conveyed the property to the daughter without any obligation to pay. Therefore, the mortgagee can proceed against the original mortgagee, who is the original obligor of the original mortgage, for any failure to pay.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The daughter was a party to the original mortgage, so the mortgagee does not fail to succeed.
- **Option B**: Correct. The mortgagee has the right to seek payment from any party associated with the property, including the original mortgagee.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. There is no delegation of duties to the daughter; the mortgagee retains the right to seek payment from the original mortgagee.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The mortgagee has the right to seek payment from the original mortgagee, not as a third-party beneficiary.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The mortgagee can collect from the original mortgagee, not the daughter.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The daughter did promise to take ownership of the property.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The mortgagee can collect from the original mortgagee, not the daughter.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The mortgagee does not delegate duties to the daughter; the mortgagee retains the right to seek payment from the original mortgagee.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The mortgagee does not succeed because the daughter did not make a promise to pay the mortgage.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The mortgagee can succeed in collecting from the original mortgagee.

The correct answer is **B**, as the mortgagee has the right to seek payment from the original mortgagee (the borrower), even though the mortgagee (the company) did not make a promise to pay. 

ANSWER: B
