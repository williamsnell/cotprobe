Okay, so I've got this electrolysis problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the same amount of electricity was passed through two separate cells. One has copper sulfate, and the other silver nitrate. I need to find out how much Ag is deposited in the second cell, given that 3.18g of Cu was deposited in the first.

Wait, electrolysis involves the movement of electrons, right? So the amount of substance deposited depends on the amount of charge passed through. Since the same quantity of electricity was used in both cells, the moles of electrons transferred should be the same in both. But wait, the reactions are different for each.

First, let's think about the copper cell. The reaction is Cu²+ + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). So each copper ion gains 2 electrons to become copper metal. The molar mass of copper is about 63.55 g/mol. So the moles of Cu deposited can be calculated from the mass given.

Given mass of Cu is 3.18 g. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 3.18 / 63.55. Let me calculate that. Let me see, 63.55 is roughly 63.5. 3.18 divided by 63.5 is approximately 0.05 mol, because 63.5 * 0.05 is 3.175, which is close to 3.18. So about 0.05 moles of Cu.

Since each mole of Cu requires 2 moles of electrons, the total electrons transferred is 0.05 * 2 = 0.1 moles? Wait, no, wait: 0.05 moles of Cu, each using 2 electrons, so total electrons = 0.05 * 2 = 0.1 moles of electrons.

But wait, the other cell is AgNO3. The reaction here is Ag+ + e⁻ → Ag(s). So each Ag atom takes one electron. So the moles of electrons is the same as moles of Ag deposited.

But wait, in the first cell, we have 0.1 moles of electrons. So in the second cell, if the same amount of charge is used, the moles of Ag deposited will be 0.1 moles, since each Ag uses one electron.

Wait, let me make sure. The charge Q is the same for both cells. Q = n * e, where n is moles of electrons. For the first cell, each Cu²+ gains 2e-, so each Cu requires 2e-. So Q = 2 * n(Cu) * e. For the second, each Ag+ uses 1e-, so Q = 1 * n(Ag) * e. Since Q is same, 2*n(Cu) = 1*n(Ag) → n(Ag) = 2 * n(Cu). Wait, but wait, n(Ag) is the moles of Ag, so if n(Cu) is 0.05, then n(Ag) would be 0.05 * 2 = 0.1 mol.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the numbers again. So in the first cell, 3.18g Cu. Moles = 3.18 / 63.55 ≈ 0.05. So 0.05 mol of Cu. Each Cu²+ gains 2e-, so total electrons = 0.05 * 2 = 0.1 mole.

In the second cell, Ag+ is being reduced by 1e-. So Q is same as the first cell. So 0.1 mole of e- → 0.1 mole of Ag, since each Ag uses 1 e-.

Wait, but if 0.1 mol of Ag is deposited, then what's the mass? Molar mass of Ag is about 108. So 0.1 * 108 = 10.8 grams. Wait, but wait. Looking at the options, option D is 10.8g. Hmm, but let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think about the stoichiometry again. Each Cu²+ requires 2 electrons, so per mole, 2 moles of e- are needed. So for 0.05 moles of Cu, it's 0.1 moles of e-. 

In the other cell, each Ag requires 1 e-. So the moles of Ag is same as the moles of e- used. So 0.1 moles of Ag. So mass is 10.8g. So the answer would be D.

But wait wait, looking at the options, option D is 10.8g, which would correspond. But wait, let me verify if the number is correct.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the first cell. Let me redo it.

Cu²+ + 2e- → Cu.

3.18g Cu: moles = 3.18 / 63.55 ≈ 0.05 mol.

Each mole of Cu uses 2e-, so n = 0.05 * 2 = 0.1 mol e-.

In the Ag cell, each Ag uses 1e-, so moles of Ag = 0.1 mol. Molar mass Ag is 108 g/mol. So 0.1 mol * 108 = 10.8 g. So the answer is D: 10.8g.

But wait, the options given. Oh the options are A:6.3, B:11.8, C:14.7, D:10.8, E:13.9, F:8.1, G:7.2, H:12.8, I:9.8, J:5.4. So D is 10.8g.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the amount of Ag deposited in the second cell, we analyze the electrolysis process for both cells. The first cell involves copper sulfate, where Cu²⁺ is reduced as follows: **Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)**. The second cell involves silver nitrate, where Ag⁺ is reduced as: **Ag⁺ + e⁻ → Ag(s)**.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of Cu deposited
The mass of Cu deposited is 3.18 g. The molar mass of Cu is approximately 63.55 g/mol. The moles of Cu can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Moles of Cu} = \frac{\text{Mass of Cu}}{\text{Molar mass of Cu}} = \frac{3.18}{63.55} \approx 0.05 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine moles of electrons required
Each mole of Cu requires 2 moles of electrons for reduction. Therefore, the total moles of electrons (\(n_{\text{e}}\)) required for the first cell is:

\[
n_{\text{e}} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.1 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Relate moles of electrons to moles of Ag deposited
In the second cell, each mole of Ag⁺ requires 1 mole of electrons for reduction. Since the same amount of charge (\(n_{\text{e}}\)) is passed through both cells, the moles of Ag deposited (\(n_{\text{Ag}}\)) are equal to the moles of electrons used:

\[
n_{\text{Ag}} = n_{\text{e}} = 0.1 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mass of Ag deposited
The molar mass of Ag is approximately 108 g/mol. The mass of Ag deposited is:

\[
\text{Mass of Ag} = n_{\text{Ag}} \times \text{Molar mass of Ag} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 108 \, \text{g/mol} = 10.8 \, \text{g}.
\]

### Final Answer
The mass of Ag deposited in the second cell is **10.8 g**, which corresponds to option **D**.
