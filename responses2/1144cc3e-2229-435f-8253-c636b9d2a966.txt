Okay, so George has a 6-month loan of $300 with an 8% interest rate. I need to figure out how much interest he'll pay.

Hmm, let's think about the interest calculation. I remember there are two common ways to calculate interest: simple interest and compound interest. Since the question doesn't specify, I'll assume it's simple interest because it's more straightforward for this scenario.

Simple interest formula is I = P * r * t, where I is interest, P is principal, r is the rate, and t is time in years.

So, P is $300. The rate is 8%, which is 0.08 in decimal. Time is 6 months. Wait, six months is half a year, so t is 0.5.

Putting it into the formula: I = 300 * 0.08 * 0.5.

Let me calculate that. 300 times 0.08 is 24. Then 24 times 0.5 is 12. So the interest is $12. That would be option C.

To calculate the interest on a 6-month loan of $300 at 8%:

1. **Simple Interest Formula**: \( I = P \times r \times t \)
   - \( P = \$300 \)
   - \( r = 8\% = 0.08 \)
   - \( t = \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) years

2. **Calculation**:
   - \( I = 300 \times 0.08 \times 0.5 = 12 \)

**Answer: C: $12**
