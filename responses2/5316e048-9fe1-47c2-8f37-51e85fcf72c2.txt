Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about protein synthesis. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which statement is correct about protein synthesis. Let me go through each option step by step.

Option A: Both strands of DNA are transcribed to form mRNA. Wait, no, DNA has two strands, but during transcription, each DNA strand is used to make a single mRNA. So both strands are transcribed into one mRNA. So A is wrong because it says both strands are made.

Option B: The RNA formed by transcription of DNA directly forms the protein. No, that's not right. mRNA is made from DNA, but the protein is made from the mRNA. So the RNA is the template for the protein. So B is incorrect because it says the RNA directly forms the protein, which isn't accurate.

Option C: The mRNA formed by transcription of a region of DNA only contains information for the protein to be synthesized. Hmm, I'm not sure. Wait, mRNA contains the genetic code. So the mRNA has the sequence, but the protein is made from the mRNA. DNA has the coding sequence. So the mRNA's sequence determines the protein. So this statement seems correct. Wait, but I thought DNA is double-stranded, so both strands are used. But mRNA is made from one of the strands. So the mRNA's sequence is the template for the protein. So the mRNA is the information for the protein. So C says the mRNA contains information for the protein. That sounds correct.

Option D: The RNA formed by transcription of DNA undergoes no modifications to form mRNA. No, I remember that during transcription, RNA is synthesized with modifications like adding phosphate groups, which affects the reading frame. So D is incorrect.

Option E: RNA undergoes splicing and further modifications. Wait, mRNA doesn't get spliced. Splicing is a process in eukaryotes for alternative splicing in RNA. So E is wrong.

Option F: All proteins are synthesized directly from mRNA without any modifications. No, because RNA undergoes modifications, like adding amino acids in the correct order. So F is incorrect.

Option G: All the information in DNA codes for proteins. That's not true. DNA codes for proteins, but not all the info is used. Only a part is used. So G is wrong.

Option H: Only one strand of DNA is transcribed to form rRNA. No, rRNA is made from both strands. Because rRNA has both 5' and 3' strands. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Proteins are formed directly from DNA without the need for RNA. No, because RNA is the intermediate. So I is wrong.

Option J: mRNA contains multiple proteins. No, that's not right. mRNA has one protein, the one being made. So J is incorrect.

Wait, so which options are left? Let's see the options again. The question says which is correct.

Looking back, option C says the mRNA only contains info for the protein. That sounds correct because the mRNA is the template for the protein. So option C is correct.

Wait, but I thought DNA's coding strand is the template for mRNA, which then codes the protein. So yes, mRNA has the genetic code for the protein. So C is correct.

To determine the correct statement about protein synthesis, let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. DNA has two strands, but during transcription, only one of them is used to form mRNA, not both.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. RNA is synthesized from DNA, but it does not directly form the protein. Instead, mRNA acts as a template for protein synthesis.
- **Option C**: Correct. mRNA contains the genetic code necessary to synthesize proteins. The mRNA sequence provides the instructions for making the protein.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. RNA undergoes modifications (e.g., adding phosphate groups) during transcription, which can alter the reading frame and affect protein synthesis.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. mRNA does not undergo splicing. Splicing is a process in eukaryotes that allows for alternative RNA transcripts.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Proteins are not synthesized directly from mRNA without modifications. Modifications are essential for accurate protein synthesis.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Not all DNA information codes for proteins; only a subset is used in protein synthesis.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. rRNA is synthesized from both DNA strands, not just one.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Proteins are not formed directly from DNA; RNA serves as an intermediate.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. mRNA contains only one protein, not multiple.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as mRNA contains the genetic code necessary to synthesize proteins.

**ANSWER: C**
