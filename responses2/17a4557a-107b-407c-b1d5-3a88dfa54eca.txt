Question:

Apoptosis, which is programmed cell death, is a necessary process in living organisms. Which of the following is NOT correct about apoptosis?

Options:

A: It occurs randomly.
B: A particular cell dies when it is no longer needed by the organism.
C: A cell carries out apoptosis when too many mutations have accumulated.
D: Plant cells carry out apoptosis as a defense measure in cells that have been infected by parasites.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about apoptosis. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the options is NOT correct. Let me go step by step.

First, I remember that apoptosis is programmed cell death. It's a process that happens when cells are under stress. The question is about which statement is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: It occurs randomly. Hmm, I thought apoptosis is not random. I remember that apoptosis is a programmed process, so it's not random. So A might be incorrect.

Option B: A particular cell dies when it's no longer needed. That sounds right. When a cell isn't needed, it gets damaged and dies. So B is correct, so not the answer.

Option C: A cell carries out apoptosis when too many mutations have accumulated. Wait, apoptosis is triggered by mutations. So when a cell has too many errors (mutations), it can't handle the damage anymore. So the cell undergoes apoptosis to protect itself. That makes C correct, so not the answer.

Option D: Plant cells carry out apoptosis as a defense in parasitic infections. Oh, I think that's right. Parasites infect plants, and if the plant isn't healthy, it can't survive. So the plant sends out its defenses, including apoptosis. So D is correct, so not the answer.

So the incorrect statement is option A. Because apoptosis isn't random. It's a programmed process.

The correct answer is **A**, as apoptosis is a programmed process and does not occur randomly. 

Answer: A
