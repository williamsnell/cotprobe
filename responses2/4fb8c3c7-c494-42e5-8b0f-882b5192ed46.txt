Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm supposed to translate a given propositional logic formula into a natural English sentence using the provided key. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the formula given is (A ∨ ~E) ≡ (D • ~B). I need to understand what each of these letters represents. The key says:

A: Marina reads a Percy Jackson book.
B: Izzy plays Minecraft.
C: Emily stops working.
D: Russell makes dinner.
E: Ashleigh stops by.

So, substituting these into the formula, it becomes:
(A ∨ ~E) ≡ (D • ~B)

Hmm, the ≡ symbol means "if and only if", so the entire statement is an equivalence between two parts: (A ∨ ~E) and (D • ~B). So, it's saying that either A is true or E is false, and this is equivalent to both D being true and B being false.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the formula is (A ∨ ~E) and (D • ~B) connected by equivalence, so it's (A ∨ ~E) ≡ (D • ~B). So, when the left side is true, the right side is also true, and vice versa.

Now, I need to translate this into a natural English sentence. Let's think about each part.

The left side, A ∨ ~E, means either A is true or E is false. A is "Marina reads a Percy Jackson book," and E is "Ashleigh stops by." So, this could be read as "Marina reads a book, or Ashleigh doesn't stop by."

The right side, D • ~B, is D and not B. So, D is "Russell makes dinner," and ~B is "Izzy doesn't play Minecraft." So, this part is "Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft."

Wait, but the formula is an equivalence between the two, so the entire formula is (A ∨ ~E) ↔ (D • ~B). So, the sentence should express that either A is true or E is false if and only if both D is true and B is false.

So, the structure is: Either (A or ~E) is true, which is equivalent to (D and not B). So, the sentence should capture this equivalence.

Now, looking at the options, each option is a sentence constructed using A, B, D, E. So, I need to find which option correctly represents the equivalence.

The options are from A to J. Let's look at the options one by one, but perhaps I can reason through them.

The formula (A ∨ ~E) ↔ (D • ~B) can be read as "If either A happens or E doesn't, then both D and not B must happen, and if both D and not B happen, then either A happens or E doesn't." Wait, but that's a bit convoluted.

Alternatively, the formula is saying that (A ∨ ~E) is equivalent to (D • ~B). So, the sentence would state that the condition (A ∨ ~E) is true exactly when (D • ~B) is true.

Looking at the options, each option is a sentence that uses A, B, D, E. Let's see how each option translates.

Option A: "Either Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by is a necessary condition for both Russell not making dinner and Izzy not playing Minecraft."

Hmm, that's a bit confusing. The structure is saying the left side (A ∨ ~E) is a necessary condition for the right side (D • ~B). So, it's saying if (A ∨ ~E) is true, then (D • ~B) must be true. But since it's an equivalence, it also implies the converse. So, the entire statement is saying that (A ∨ ~E) is a necessary condition for (D • ~B). But that's not exactly the same as the equivalence. Also, "necessary condition" is a bit tricky; necessary condition means that for the statement to be true, the condition must be true. But in the formula, the entire equivalence is making both statements true.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of "if and only if." So the correct translation should state that (A ∨ ~E) is true exactly when (D • ~B) is true. So, the sentence should say that (A ∨ ~E) is necessary and sufficient for (D • ~B). Which would mean that the two parts are equivalent.

Looking at the options, let's see which ones state that.

Looking at the options:

E: Either Marina reading a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by is a necessary condition for Russell making dinner and Izzy not playing Minecraft.

Wait, no, E says "a necessary condition for both D and ~B." But that's not quite right because the formula is an equivalence, not just one direction.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each option.

Option H says: Either Marina reading a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by is a necessary and sufficient condition for Russell making dinner and Izzy playing Minecraft.

Wait, no. Option H says: (A ∨ ~E) is a necessary and sufficient condition for (D • ~B). Which would mean that (A ∨ ~E) ↔ (D • ~B), which is exactly the given formula.

So, the correct translation would be that (A ∨ ~E) is a necessary and sufficient condition for (D • ~B). So, the sentence should state that the condition (A ∨ ~E) is exactly what's needed for (D • ~B) to be true.

Looking at the options, option H is: Either Marina reading a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by is a necessary and sufficient condition for Russell making dinner and Izzy playing Minecraft.

Wait, no. Wait, let me check the exact wording.

Option H: Either Marina reading a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by is a necessary and sufficient condition for Russell making dinner and Izzy playing Minecraft.

Wait, but the formula is (A ∨ ~E) ↔ (D • ~B), which is the same as saying (A ∨ ~E) is equivalent to (D • ~B). So, the sentence should state that (A ∨ ~E) is a necessary and sufficient condition for (D • ~B).

So, the correct structure is that (A ∨ ~E) is a necessary and sufficient condition for (D • ~B). So, in option H, the left side is (A ∨ ~E), and the right side is (D • ~B), and it's saying that (A ∨ ~E) is a necessary and sufficient condition for (D • ~B). So, that's exactly what the formula is saying.

So, the correct answer should be H. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Option H: Either Marina reading a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by is a necessary and sufficient condition for Russell making dinner and Izzy playing Minecraft.

Wait, but the formula is about (A ∨ ~E) ↔ (D • ~B). So, the condition (A ∨ ~E) is equivalent to (D • ~B). So, the sentence should say that (A ∨ ~E) is the necessary and sufficient condition for (D • ~B). So, the sentence is "Either Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh doesn't stop by is a necessary and sufficient condition for Russell making dinner and Izzy playing Minecraft."

Yes, that seems correct. So, the correct option is H.
