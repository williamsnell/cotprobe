Okay, so I've got this question about signal sampling and Nyquist criterion. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The problem gives the signal f(t) = 3sin(200πt) + 6sin(400πt) + sin(500πt). I need to find the minimum sampling frequency that satisfies the Nyquist criterion. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm, the Nyquist theorem states that the sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest frequency component in the signal to avoid aliasing. So first, I need to find the highest frequency in the signal.

Looking at each term, the general form is sin(nωt), where ω is the angular frequency. The angular frequency ω is related to the actual frequency f by ω = 2πf. So each term in the signal has a different angular frequency, and the highest one will determine the Nyquist frequency.

Let's break down each term:

1. 3sin(200πt): The angular frequency here is 200π. To find the frequency f, we divide by 2π. So f1 = 200π / (2π) = 100 Hz.

2. 6sin(400πt): Angular frequency is 400π. So f2 = 400π / (2π) = 200 Hz.

3. sin(500πt): Angular frequency is 500π. So f3 = 500π / (2π) = 250 Hz.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Let me make sure I'm doing that right. Oh, wait, no. Wait, 500π is the angular frequency. So f = (500π) / (2π) = 250 Hz. Oh, right, because 500π is 500π radians per second, and to get Hz, divide by 2π. So f3 is 250 Hz.

So the three frequencies are 100 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. The highest is 250 Hz. 

According to Nyquist's theorem, the minimum sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest frequency. So the Nyquist frequency is 2 * 250 Hz = 500 Hz.

The problem asks for the answer in terms of π Hz. Oh right, because the options are in terms of π. So 500 Hz is 500/(π) * π Hz? Wait, no. Wait: 500 Hz is the same as 500 * π radians per second over 2π, but wait, that's not directly correct.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Frequency f is measured in Hz, which is cycles per second. Angular frequency ω is in radians per second, and ω = 2πf. So the highest angular frequency in the signal is 500π rad/s. So the highest frequency component f is (500π) / (2π) = 250 Hz. So the Nyquist frequency is 2*250 = 500 Hz.

But the question asks for the minimum sampling frequency in terms of π Hz. Wait, the options are in terms of π Hz. For instance, option E is 500, which is in Hz, not π Hz. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the question again.

The question says: "the minimum sampling frequency (in πHz)" — so the answer needs to be in units of π Hz. So 1 Hz is 1/π πHz. So 500 Hz is 500 * π Hz. Wait, no, 500 Hz is 500 * (1 Hz) → which is 500 * (1/(2π) πHz) )? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The Nyquist frequency in Hz is 500 Hz. To express this in terms of π Hz, we can write 500 Hz as (500 / π) * π Hz, because each π Hz is a higher frequency. But that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the Nyquist rate is 2 * f_max, where f_max is in Hz, and the answer is 2*f_max, expressed in terms of π.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's compute the Nyquist frequency. As established, the highest frequency is 250 Hz. So the Nyquist frequency is 500 Hz. So the minimum sampling frequency must be at least 500 Hz. But the options are in terms of π Hz. So 500 Hz is equivalent to (500/ π) * π Hz.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let's think again. 1 Hz = 1/(2π) * π Hz. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the sampling frequency in terms of π multiplied by Hz. So 500 Hz is 500/(π) πHz. Because 1 Hz = 1/(π) πHz. Wait, but that would make 500 Hz equal to (500/π) πHz, which is approximately 159.15 π Hz. But that's not an option. 

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the Nyquist frequency is 2*f_max. So f_max is 250 Hz. So 2*250 is 500 Hz. So the minimum sampling frequency is 500 Hz. But the options are in π Hz. So the answer is 500 Hz, but the options are in terms of π. So the question is phrased as "in πHz", meaning that the answer needs to be expressed in terms of multiples of π.

Wait, but 500 Hz is 500/(π) πHz. Because 1 Hz = 1/(π) πHz. So 500 Hz = 500 * (1 Hz) = 500 * (1/(π) πHz) ) → 500/(π) πHz.

But looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me check the options again. The options are all integers, but it's a bit ambiguous. Wait, the options are all in terms of 'something π Hz', so perhaps the options are in Hz, but represented as multiples of π. For example, option A is 550, which is 550 Hz. But the question says "in πHz".

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem says: "determine the minimum sampling frequency (in πHz)".

Ah, so the answer is to present the minimum sampling frequency in terms of π multiplied by Hz. So 500 Hz is 500/π * π Hz. But that seems a bit awkward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the minimum sampling rate in Hz multiplied by π? Like, 500 Hz is 500 * π πHz? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's reevaluate. The question asks for "the minimum sampling frequency (in πHz)". So the answer must be in units of π Hz. So 500 Hz = 500/(π) * π Hz. But that would mean the answer is 500/π, but that's not an option. The closest options are 400, 450, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck the frequencies. The terms are 200π, 400π, 500π. So f1=100 Hz, f2=200 Hz, f3=250 Hz. So the highest is 250 Hz. So the Nyquist rate is 500 Hz. So the minimum sampling frequency is 500 Hz. But the options are in terms of π times Hz. So 500 Hz is equal to (500/π) π Hz. But looking at the options, none of them are 500/π. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Maybe I'm getting the angular frequency wrong. Wait, each term is sin(n ω t), where ω is the angular frequency. The frequency in Hz is ω/(2π). So for each term:

Term 1: 3 sin(200π t). ω = 200π. So f1 = 200π/(2π) = 100 Hz.

Term 2: 6 sin(400π t). f2=400π/(2π)=200 Hz.

Term3: 500π. f3=500π/(2 π)=250 Hz.

So the maximum is 250 Hz. So the Nyquist frequency is 2 * 250 = 500 Hz. So the minimum sampling rate is 500 Hz.

But the options are in terms of π Hz. So the question is asking for the answer in units of π Hz, so 500 Hz is the same as 500/π * (π Hz). So 500/(π) * π Hz → 500 π Hz? No, that doesn't make sense. Because 1 Hz is 1/(π) π Hz. So 500 Hz = 500 * (1 Hz) = 500 * (1/(π) π Hz) ) = 500/(π) π Hz.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are numbers multiplied by π Hz. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sampling rate multiplied by π. For example, if the Nyquist rate is 500 Hz, then expressed as 500/π * π Hz. But 500/π is approximately 159.15, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again. The signal is 3sin(200πt) + 6sin(400πt) + sin(500πt). So each term's angular frequency is 200π, 400π, 500π.

Wait, wait. Oh wait a minute. Wait, 500π is the angular frequency. So ω = 500 π rad/s. So the frequency is f = ω/(2π) = (500 π) / (2π) ) → 250 Hz. So the highest frequency is 250 Hz. So the Nyquist rate is 500 Hz. So the minimum sampling frequency is 500 Hz.

But the question says, in terms of π Hz. So 500 Hz = 500/(π) * π Hz. But looking at the options, the options are like 550, 1000, etc. All are in Hz units. So wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Oh! Wait, the question says, "the minimum sampling frequency (in πHz)". So, for example, if the answer is 500 Hz, it would be 500/(π) πHz. But looking at the options, the highest option is 800. So I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the maximum angular frequency is 500π rad/s. So the actual frequency is 500π/(2π) = 250 Hz. So the Nyquist rate is 2 * 250 = 500 Hz. So the minimum sampling frequency is 500 Hz. So the correct option is E (500 Hz). But the options are in multiples of π Hz, so I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the question actually wants the Nyquist rate in terms of π multiplied by Hz. So 500 Hz is 500/(π) * π Hz. But that's not any of the options. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake with the angular frequency. Let me compute each term again.

Term 1: 3 sin(200π t) → f1 = 200π / (2π) = 100 Hz.

Term2: 6 sin(400π t) → f2=400π/(2π) = 200 Hz.

Term3: sin(500π t) → f3=500π/(2π) = 250 Hz.

So yes, the highest is 250 Hz. So Nyquist rate is 500 Hz. So the correct answer is 500 Hz. But looking at the options, 500 is option E. So that would be the correct answer. But the options also include other numbers, so why are they presented as multiples of π? Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sampling rate expressed in terms of π times Hz. So 500 Hz is 500/(π) πHz. But none of the options match this. Hmmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct and I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the maximum frequency. Let's see:

The maximum angular frequency is 500 π rad/s. So the maximum frequency is 500 π / (2 π) ) = 250 Hz. So that's correct.

So the Nyquist rate is 500 Hz. So the answer is 500 Hz. Looking at the options, option E is 500. So the correct answer should be E.

Wait, but the options include 1000, 100, 200, etc. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, 200π is the angular frequency for the first term. So f1 is 200π/(2π) = 100 Hz.

400π gives f2=200 Hz.

500π gives f3=250 Hz.

So the highest is 250 Hz. So Nyquist is 500 Hz. Which is 500. Option E is 500. So the correct answer is E.

The problem involves determining the minimum sampling frequency (in πHz) that satisfies the Nyquist criterion for the given signal:

\[
f(t) = 3\sin(200\pi t) + 6\sin(400\pi t) + \sin(500\pi t).
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Identify the angular frequencies**: Each term in the signal has an angular frequency \(\omega = n\pi\), where \(n\) is an integer. The frequencies in Hz are calculated by dividing \(\omega\) by \(2\pi\):
   - \(3\sin(200\pi t)\): \(\omega = 200\pi \implies f_1 = \frac{200\pi}{2\pi} = 100 \, \text{Hz}\).
   - \(6\sin(400\pi t)\): \(\omega = 400\pi \implies f_2 = \frac{400\pi}{2\pi} = 200 \, \text{Hz}\).
   - \(\sin(500\pi t)\): \(\omega = 500\pi \implies f_3 = \frac{500\pi}{2\pi} = 250 \, \text{Hz}\).

2. **Determine the highest frequency**: From the above, the highest frequency component is \(250 \, \text{Hz}\).

3. **Apply the Nyquist criterion**: The Nyquist frequency is twice the highest frequency, so:
   \[
   \text{Nyquist frequency} = 2 \times 250 = 500 \, \text{Hz}.
   \]

4. **Express the result in terms of πHz**: The Nyquist frequency of \(500 \, \text{Hz}\) can be expressed as \(500/\pi \, \pi\text{Hz}\), but the problem asks for the answer in units of πHz. Since \(500 \, \text{Hz}\) is equivalent to \(500/\pi \, \pi\text{Hz}\), the correct interpretation is that the minimum sampling frequency is \(500 \, \text{Hz}\).

5. **Verify the options**: Among the provided options, \(500 \, \text{Hz}\) corresponds to option **E**.

### Conclusion:
The minimum sampling frequency that satisfies the Nyquist criterion is \(500 \, \text{Hz}\), which corresponds to option **E**.
