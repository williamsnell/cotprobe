Question:

It is known that a lab cart is moving east at 25 cm/s at time t1 = 0.10 s, and then moving east at 15 cm/s at t2 = 0.20 s. Is this enough information to determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between t1 and t2?

Options:

A: No, because we don’t know if there are other forces acting on the cart apart from the net force.
B: No, because we don’t know whether forces such as friction or air resistance might be acting on the cart.
C: No, because we don't know the initial velocity of the cart.
D: Yes, since we know the cart keeps moving to the east, the net force must be in the direction of motion.
E: Yes, because the cart is moving in the east direction, the net force must be acting in the east direction.
F: No, because we don’t know the total distance covered by the cart.
G: Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change.
H: No, because we don’t know the mass of the cart.
I: Yes, because the cart's velocity is decreasing, the net force must be acting in the west direction.
J: Yes, since the cart is slowing down, the net force must be acting in the opposite direction to the direction of motion.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a lab cart moving east and slowing down. Hmm, let me think through it. So the question is about whether there's enough information to determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between t1 and t2. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, the problem says the cart is moving east at 25 cm/s at t1=0.10 s and then 15 cm/s at t2=0.20 s. So the speed is decreasing. That makes me think about Newton's laws. Newton's second law says F_net = m*a, where a is acceleration. But wait, in this case, the cart is slowing down, so its acceleration must be opposite to the direction of motion. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. So if the velocity is decreasing, and it's moving east, the acceleration is westward.

But wait, Newton's second law says that the net force is in the same direction as the acceleration if mass is positive. So if the acceleration is west, then the net force must be west. That would point opposite to the direction of motion.

Wait, but another thought: if the cart is slowing down, does that mean the net force is opposite to the motion? Because if velocity is decreasing, that's an acceleration opposite to velocity. So the net force is in the direction of the acceleration. So since acceleration is opposite to velocity, the net force must be west.

So looking at the options, I need to check which one says that. Let me see the options again. Option D says 'Yes, since we know the cart keeps moving east, the net force must be in the direction of motion.' Wait, no, because D isn't exactly correct. D says the force is in the direction of motion, but in reality, the acceleration is opposite. So the force would be opposite.

Option I says 'Yes, because the cart's velocity is decreasing, the net force must be acting in the west direction.' That sounds right. Wait, but why? Because acceleration is west, so force is west.

Wait, but what about the mass? Oh, the question doesn't give the mass. So can we determine it? Well, the mass could be part of the equation. But without knowing the mass, can we determine the direction of the net force? Hmm, no, because the net force's direction depends on the acceleration. Without knowing the mass, we can't get the magnitude, but the direction is determined by the acceleration. Oh wait, but even without the mass, we can still get the direction. Because F_net = m*a. But the direction of F_net is same as acceleration. So yes, the direction would be west regardless of the mass. So the direction is determined by the acceleration, which is west.

Wait, but if the cart is slowing down, that means the acceleration is opposite to the motion. So F_net is west. But wait, another factor: if the cart is slowing down, isn't that a deceleration? So the acceleration is opposite to the direction of motion. So the net force must be opposite, which is west.

So looking at the options, let's see:

- Are there any other forces acting on the cart besides the net force? Well, the options are talking about the net force. So the question is whether the information given is sufficient to find the direction of the net force.

The cart's velocity is decreasing, so the acceleration is opposite to the velocity. So the acceleration is west. Therefore, the net force is west.

So looking at the options, which one says that? Option E says the net force is east, which is opposite. No, that's not right. Option I says west, which is correct. But wait, other options.

Option G says the cart is slowing down, so net force opposite, and the momentum change is opposite, so net force is west. But that's again about the direction of the force, not the conclusion.

So the correct reasoning is that since the cart is slowing down, the acceleration is opposite to the direction of motion, so the net force is west.

So the answers that say yes are options I and E. Wait, no, E says net force east, which is wrong. I says west, which is correct.

Wait, but let me recheck the options:

Looking at the options:

E: Yes, because the cart is moving east, so net force is east. Wrong, because the cart is slowing down, so F is west.

I: Yes, because velocity is decreasing, net force west.

So the answer should be I. So the correct option is I.

Another option, option J says because it's slowing down, net force opposite. That sounds correct. So option J says the net force is opposite to motion. So that's correct.

Wait, so which is it? Are both I and J correct? Or no?

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about the direction of the net force. So the net force is in the same direction as the acceleration. So if the acceleration is west, the net force is west. So the correct answer is either I or J.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option I: Yes, because the cart's velocity is decreasing, net force west.

Option J: Yes, because cart is slowing down, net force opposite direction (west).

Wait, both I and J are correct statements, but the options are exclusive. So which one is the correct answer according to the question?

The question is whether the given information allows us to determine the direction of the net force. So yes, because the cart's velocity is decreasing, which implies acceleration west, so net force is west. So both I and J are correct in that sense. But wait, let me check the exact wording of each option.

Option I: 'Yes, because the cart's velocity is decreasing, the net force must be acting in the west direction.' That's correct.

Option J: 'Yes, because the cart is slowing down, the net force must be acting in the opposite direction to the direction of motion.' Which is also correct because the cart is moving east, slowing down → net force west.

So both I and J are correct. But the options don't have both. Wait, wait. Let me look at the options again:

Options are A to J. So which is correct.

Wait, the options are independent of each other. So if the correct reasoning is that the cart is slowing down (so acceleration west), so the net force is west, then option I is correct.

But option J says the same, but phrased differently. So whether the answer is I or J.

Wait, but looking at the options, I and J are both correct in their reasoning. But in reality, both I and J are correct statements. However, in the options, only one can be selected as the correct answer.

Wait, wait. Let me read the options again:

E: Yes, because the cart is moving east, net force east. Wrong, because it's slowing down.

I: Yes, because velocity decreasing → west.

J: Yes, because slowing down → west.

So both I and J are correct, but the options don't allow choosing both. So which one is the correct answer?

Wait, looking back at the question, the correct reasoning is that the cart is slowing down, so net force is opposite. So the direction of the net force is opposite to the direction of motion. So the direction is west.

But in the options, both I and J are correct. But the options are separate. So the correct answer would be either I or J. But the multiple-choice options are exclusive, so wait, perhaps the correct answer is I because it's based on the velocity, but J is another way of phrasing the same.

Wait, wait, the options are:

Options I: Yes, because velocity is decreasing, net force west.

Option J: Yes, because slowing down, so net force opposite direction → west.

So both are correct for their reasoning, but in reality, both I and J are correct statements. However, in the multiple-choice options, only one can be chosen.

Wait, but the question is about whether the information is sufficient to determine the direction of the net force. So the question is whether we can determine the direction. So both I and J are correct. But looking at the options, the correct reasoning is that the acceleration is west, hence net force west. Thus, the correct answer is I.

Wait, but another factor: the lab cart's mass. Hmm, the mass affects the acceleration, but since the question doesn't provide the mass, can we determine the direction of the net force? Oh wait, even without knowing the mass, the direction of the net force is determined by the acceleration, which is opposite to the motion. So, the direction is west, regardless of mass.

So the correct reasoning is that the net force is west, so the answer would be either I or J. But the options don't have both. So perhaps the correct answer is I.

Wait, but the options I and J are both correct. So in the multiple-choice, which one is the best?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I because it directly states that the velocity is decreasing, leading to west.

But another way to think: the question is about the direction of the net force, which is opposite to the acceleration. So the net force is west.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is phrased as 'the net force must be acting in the opposite direction to the direction of motion.' That is also correct.

Hmm, so for the given options, both I and J are correct. But in the multiple-choice, only one can be selected. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both I and J, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I because the acceleration is opposite to the direction of motion.

Wait, but the key point is that the cart's velocity is decreasing, so the acceleration is opposite to velocity. So the net force is opposite to velocity. So the correct answer is west.

Looking at the options, both I and J say the same thing, but perhaps the answer is I.

Wait, but wait, another thought. The question is: 'Is this enough information to determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between t1 and t2?' So the fact that the cart is slowing down implies that the acceleration is opposite to the direction of motion. So yes, the net force's direction is opposite, which is west.

So the correct answer is either I or J.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct reasoning is in option I. Option J is also correct, but the options don't have both selected. So perhaps the answer is I.

Wait, but another way to look at this: the net force direction is opposite to the acceleration. So if the cart is slowing down, the acceleration is opposite to motion. So the net force is opposite. So the direction is west.

So the correct answer is I or J. But in the options, the correct answer is I.

Wait, I think I should go with option I. Because the key point is that the cart is slowing down, which implies that the net force is opposite to the direction of motion. So the net force is west. So that's the reasoning.
</think>

The question asks whether the given information is sufficient to determine the direction of the net force acting on a lab cart as it slows down. The cart's velocity decreases, meaning its acceleration is opposite to its direction of motion. Since acceleration is directly related to the net force (via Newton's second law, \( F_{\text{net}} = m \cdot a \)), the direction of the net force is opposite to the acceleration. 

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: Incorrect. The question does not provide enough information to know if other forces are acting on the cart.
2. **Option B**: Incorrect. The cart is slowing down, so friction or air resistance could be acting on it.
3. **Option C**: Incorrect. The cart's initial velocity is not known.
4. **Option D**: Incorrect. The cart is moving east, but the net force is west.
5. **Option E**: Incorrect. The net force is not east; it is opposite to the motion.
6. **Option F**: Incorrect. The cart is moving east, but no information is provided about the total distance.
7. **Option G**: Incorrect. The cart's deceleration implies the net force is west, not opposite.
8. **Option H**: Incorrect. The cart's mass is not provided.
9. **Option I**: Correct. The cart's velocity is decreasing, so the net force is west.
10. **Option J**: Correct. The cart is slowing down, so the net force is opposite to motion (west).

Both **I** and **J** are correct in their reasoning, but since the question requires selecting only one option, **I** is the best choice as it directly addresses the given information about the cart's deceleration.
