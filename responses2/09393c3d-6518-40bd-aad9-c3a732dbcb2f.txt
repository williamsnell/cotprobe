Okay, so I've got this problem about amplitude modulation and power calculation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the question gives me the carrier signal m(t) = n(t) * cos(ωt + θ). So, amplitude modulation with noise n(t) as the baseband signal. The noise θ is a random variable with a probability density function f(θ) = 1/(2π) between -π and π, and zero otherwise. Also, θ and n(t) are independent, which probably means their statistical properties can be considered separately.

The question asks to determine the power dissipated by m(t). The options are given, but I'm not sure yet which one is correct. Wait, the power dissipated probably refers to the average power of the modulated signal. So I need to compute the average power of m(t) over time.

I remember that for a signal like this, the power can be found by calculating the expected value of the square of the signal. So, power P is E[m(t)^2]. Let me write that down.

P = E[m(t)^2] = E[ n(t)^2 cos^2(ωt + θ) ]

Since n(t) is the baseband noise and it's independent of θ, I can separate the expectation. Wait, but n(t) is the same as m(t) divided by the cos term. Let me think: m(t) is n(t) multiplied by the cosine term. So m(t) = n(t) cos( ... ), which makes n(t) = m(t) / cos(...), but that's probably not the most straightforward way. Alternatively, perhaps I can express m(t)^2 as n(t)^2 multiplied by cos^2(...).

So, P = E[ n(t)^2 cos^2(ωt + θ) ]

But because n(t) and θ are independent, the expectation can be split into the product of expectations. But wait, wait—since n(t) and θ are independent, but m(t) is a function of both. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, actually, n(t) is a baseband signal. So when you modulate it with cos(θ), you get m(t) = n(t) cos(θ) cos(ωt) - n(t) sin(θ) sin(ωt). So the power of m(t) is the average power of this modulated signal.

But actually, another approach: the power of the signal m(t) can be found by the average power of the baseband signal times 1 + the power of the noise plus some cross terms. Wait, no, perhaps I should model it as a product of two signals: the baseband signal and the carrier wave, which is cos(θ).

Wait, no, the baseband is n(t), and the carrier is cos(θ). So the product is m(t) = n(t) * cos(θ) * cos(ωt). Wait, but the problem states m(t) = n(t) cos(ωt + θ), so that's correct. So m(t) is the product of n(t) and cos(θ) multiplied by cos(ωt). So m(t) = [n(t) cos(θ)] cos(ωt).

So, the power P is the average of m(t)^2, which is E[ m(t)^2 ].

So, m(t)^2 = n(t)^2 cos^2(θ) cos^2(ωt).

Now, since n(t) and θ are independent of ωt, the expectation E[cos^2(ωt)] is the same for all t. Let me compute that. The expected value of cos^2(x) over a full period is 1/2, regardless of x. Because cos^2 x = (1 + cos(2x))/2, so the average is (1 + 0)/2 = 1/2.

So, E[cos^2(ωt)] = 1/2.

Also, E[cos^2(θ)] is the same because θ is uniformly distributed between -π and π. So, for a uniform distribution between -π and π, the average of cos^2(theta) is 1/2, because the integral of cos^2 from -π to π is (π)(1/2) + (π)(1/2) = π. So the average is (1/(2π)) * ∫_{-π}^{π} cos^2(theta) dtheta = (1/(2π)) * (π) = 1/2.

So, E[cos^2(theta)] = 1/2.

So putting it all together: P = E[ m(t)^2 ] = E[ n(t)^2 cos^2(theta) cos^2(ωt) ].

Since n(t) and theta are independent, and n(t) is independent of omega t, the expectation factors into E[n(t)^2] * E[cos^2(theta)] * E[cos^2(omega t)].

Wait, but n(t) is the baseband signal, and I'm given that E[n^2(t)] is sigma squared. So E[n(t)^2] = sigma^2.

So substituting these values:

P = sigma^2 * (1/2) * (1/2) = sigma^2 * (1/4) = sigma^2/4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is (1/4) sigma squared. Oh, but wait, I thought the power of the noise is sigma squared, but wait, no, wait: the noise n(t) has E[n^2(t)] = sigma^2. So in the expression for P, we have sigma squared multiplied by 1/4, leading to sigma squared over 4.

But wait, another approach: the power of a product of signals is the product of their individual powers if they're independent. But wait, in this case, n(t) and cos(theta) are independent, but m(t) is n(t) * cos(theta) * cos(ωt).

Wait, but wait, m(t) is n(t) multiplied by cos(theta) multiplied by cos(omega t). So, in terms of power, the power would be E[ m(t)^2 ] = E[ n(t)^2 cos^2(theta) cos^2(omega t) ].

Since n(t) and theta are independent, and cos^2 is a function of theta, but the product of cos^2(theta) and cos^2(omega t) are functions of theta and time. But wait, since the time variable is integrated over, the expectation over time of cos^2(omega t) is 1/2. Similarly, the expectation of cos^2(theta) is 1/2.

But wait, no, wait. The time dependence is in cos(omega t). So E[cos^2(omega t)] is 1/2 because the average of cos^2 over a period is 1/2.

So, P = E[n(t)^2] * E[cos^2(theta)] * E[cos^2(omega t)].

Which is sigma^2 * (1/2) * (1/2) = sigma^2 * (1/4) = sigma^2/4.

So the answer should be (1/4) sigma squared, which is option E.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option E is (1/4) sigma squared. So the correct answer should be E.

Alternatively, I'm a bit confused whether I should include terms from the product. Wait, but wait: because the noise is independent of theta, but the time component is cos(omega t). So, the cross terms like n(t) cos(theta) might have some cross power, but in this case, the question is about the power, so perhaps it's just the product of the power of n(t) and the power of the cos(theta) term. Because n(t) and theta are independent, and cos(theta) is a time-invariant term.

Wait, no, perhaps the confusion arises because m(t) is a product of n(t) and cos(theta) and cos(omega t). But since all terms are time-invariant except for the time in cos(omega t), but for the purpose of power, the time parts average out.

Wait, but wait, when computing the power of m(t), which is a product of n(t) and cos(theta), and then multiplied by cos(omega t). So m(t) is n(t) * cos(theta) * cos(omega t). So the power is the average of [n(t) cos(theta) cos(omega t)]².

So that's E[ n(t)^2 cos^2(theta) cos^2(omega t) ].

Since cos(theta) is time-independent, the time average of cos^2(omega t) is 1/2. Similarly, cos^2(theta) averages to 1/2. So the expectation becomes sigma^2 * (1/2) * (1/2) = sigma^2 /4.

So, the correct answer is E: (1/4) sigma^2.

Wait, but let me check the initial problem statement again. The question says "the power dissipated by m(t)", and the options include (1/3) sigma^2, etc. So I think I'm confident that the correct answer is option E.
</think>

To determine the power dissipated by the modulated signal \( m(t) = n(t) \cos(\omega t + \theta) \), we calculate the average power \( P = E[m(t)^2] \). The signal can be expressed as:

\[
m(t) = n(t) \cos(\omega t) \cos(\theta),
\]

so the power becomes:

\[
P = E[m(t)^2] = E[n(t)^2 \cos^2(\omega t) \cos^2(\theta)].
\]

Since \( n(t) \) and \( \theta \) are independent, the expectation can be separated:

\[
P = E[n(t)^2] \cdot E[\cos^2(\theta)] \cdot E[\cos^2(\omega t)].
\]

Given \( E[n^2(t)] = \sigma^2 \), we substitute \( E[n(t)^2] = \sigma^2 \). Additionally, \( \theta \) is uniformly distributed between \( -\pi \) and \( \pi \), so:

\[
E[\cos^2(\theta)] = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The time-dependent term \( \cos^2(\omega t) \) averages to \( \frac{1}{2} \) over time. Substituting these values:

\[
P = \sigma^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\sigma^2}{4}.
\]

Thus, the power dissipated by \( m(t) \) is \( \frac{\sigma^2}{4} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
