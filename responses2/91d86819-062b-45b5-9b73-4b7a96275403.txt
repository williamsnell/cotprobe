Okay, so I've got this question about the average speeds of gas molecules in a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that the average speed of gas molecules depends on temperature and molecular weight. Oh right, the formula for average speed is related to the square root of temperature and inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass.

Wait, the question is asking which gas molecule in the mixture has the greatest average speed. So I need to compare their speeds. The options are various gases: helium, methane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen, etc.

Wait, but wait. The key is that in a mixture, the average speed is the weighted average based on the mole fractions and their molecular weights. So the gas with the smallest speed would be the one that contributes the most because it's lighter. Alternatively, if a gas is heavier, its contribution to the average speed would be less.

But wait, the question's setup is a bit tricky. It's asking about the "molecules" in the mixture having the greatest average speed. So each individual molecule's average speed depends on their own properties.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The average speed of a gas is determined by the formula sqrt(3RT/(M)), where R is gas constant, T is temperature, and M is molar mass. So higher M means lower speed.

In a mixture, each gas contributes to the average speed based on its mole fraction. But the question is about the individual molecules. So the speed of each individual molecule in the mixture depends on their own M.

So the fastest molecules in the mixture would be the ones with the smallest M. Because the lighter gas molecules move faster on average.

Wait, but wait again. The question is about the greatest average speed in the mixture. Alternatively, if the mixture is at a certain temperature, each gas's average speed is determined by their M. But the same temperature applies to all.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall average speed of the mixture. That's a different question, but the question is about individual molecules. Oh wait, the question says: "the molecules having the greatest average speed are those of" so it's about the individual molecules, not the mixture's average.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me re-read the question. The question is about the "molecules" in the mixture. So each molecule's average speed is determined by their own M. The maximum speed would be in the lightest gas, because M is inversely related to speed.

So in the options, the heaviest gases would have lower average speeds. So the smallest M would have the highest average speed.

Looking at the options: the options are all different gases. So which of these gases is the lightest? Helium has the lightest molar mass, so its molecules would have the highest average speeds.

But wait, wait. Let me think: the options given are B (helium), C (methane), D (CO2), E (nitrogen), F (hydrogen), etc.

So the lightest has the highest average speed in the mixture. So among the options, F is hydrogen, which has the smallest M. So the molecules with the greatest average speed are those of hydrogen.

Wait, but wait. So the speed varies depending on the gas, right. So in the mixture, each type of gas contributes to the overall average, but each individual molecule's speed is determined by their M.

So the correct answer would be F: hydrogen.

To determine which gas molecule in the mixture has the greatest average speed, we use the formula for average speed of gas molecules: 

\[
\text{Average speed} \propto \sqrt{\frac{1}{M}}
\]

where \( M \) is the molar mass of the gas. This means that lighter gas molecules move faster on average. Among the options provided, hydrogen (F) has the smallest molar mass, making its molecules move the fastest. 

While the overall average speed of the mixture depends on the mole fractions and molar masses of all gases, the question specifically asks about the molecules in the mixture. Therefore, the molecules with the greatest average speed are those of hydrogen.

Answer: F
