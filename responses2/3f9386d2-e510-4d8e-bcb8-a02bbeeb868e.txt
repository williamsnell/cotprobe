Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about holography fringes. Hmm, I remember that in holography, the fringes are patterns created on the hologram plate where the object and reference sources interfere. The question gives me some parameters and I need to estimate the scale of detail in the fringes. Let me think about what I know.

The problem states that both the reference source and the object are 1 meter away from the hologram plate. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Oh wait, no, wait. The object and the reference are on the same side of the plate. So their distance from the plate is 1 m. But the object and the reference are 100 mm apart. Hmm, wait, wait, no, no. Wait, wait, it's a distance between the object and the reference sources. Oh, right! So the object is at 1 m from the plate, and the reference is also 1 m away, but they are 100 mm apart. Wait, that's confusing. Let me re-read.

Wait, the problem says that the reference source and the object are both 1 m from the hologram plate, and they are 100 mm apart. Wait, that's impossible because if both are 1 m away, the distance between them would be 100 mm only if they are on opposite sides of the plate. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting the setup wrong. Let's see—maybe the object and the reference are on the same side of the plate, but their distance apart is 100 mm. Oh no, wait—no, no, wait the reference is on the same side as the object or opposite?

Wait, perhaps the setup is that the object is placed on one side, and the reference is placed on the other. But the problem says both are 1 m from the plate. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem means that the object and the reference are on the same side of the plate, but the distance between them is 100 mm, which is 0.1 meters. Hmm, that's possible. Because the object is on one side, the reference on the other. So the distance between them is 0.1 m.

Wait wait, no. Let me think again. The problem says: "the reference source and the object are both 1 m from the hologram plate, and they are 100 mm apart." Oh, so both are 1 m away, but the object and reference are 100 mm apart. So their positions are 100 mm apart. How is that possible? Because if both are 1 m away from the plate, the distance between them must be less than 2 meters, right? Because the maximum distance between two points both at 1 m from a point is 2 m, when they're on opposite sides. But the problem says 100 mm apart, which is 0.1 meters. So that must be the case.

Wait, but wait. The object is on one side of the plate, the reference on the other. So the distance between them is 100 mm, which is 0.1 meters. So that makes sense.

Now, the question is about the scale of detail in the hologram fringes. I remember that the fringe spacing (or the wavelength spacing) is related to the wavelength, the distance between the object and the hologram, and the distance between the object and the reference.

Let me recall the formula. I think the fringe spacing (d) is given by d = λ * (distance between object and hologram) / (distance between object and reference). Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, I think the formula is d = (λ * D) / (d0), where D is the distance from the object to the hologram, and d0 is the distance between the object and the reference.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the diffraction pattern. In an interference setup, the spacing between fringes is determined by the wavelength and the geometry of the setup. The formula for the fringe spacing (fringe width) is given by:

fringe width, β = (λ * D) / (s), where D is the distance from the object to the hologram plate, and s is the separation between the object and the reference. Wait, no, no. Wait, wait, I think I'm mixing up the variables.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula for the interference condition. For an interference pattern, the path difference between the object and the reference at a point on the hologram gives the condition for constructive interference. The path difference is given by (s * D) / d, where s is the separation between object and reference, D is the distance from the object to the plate (same for both, since both are 1 m), and d is the distance between the object and the reference when projected onto the plate.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to model this: the object is at a certain distance from the hologram, and the reference is at the same distance. The object is at (say) position x, and the reference is at position x + s, so s is 0.1 m. Now, the path difference for a point on the hologram is the difference in the distances from the object and the reference to that point. Let's model the hologram plate as a plane. Let's say the object is on one side, the reference on the other, separated by 0.1 m. The hologram's plane is at the origin. Suppose the object is at (0,0) on one side of the plate, and the reference is at (d, 0), where d is 0.1 m. Now, any point on the hologram plate (say, at (x, y)) will have a path difference from the object and the reference.

Wait, but perhaps in this case, the object is at a point (0,0) and the reference is at (s, 0), where s=0.1 m. Then, any point on the hologram plate (let's say (x, y)) will have a path difference from the object as D + y (since the object is at (0,0) and the hologram plate is at (0,0)), and the reference as D - y, because the reference is at (s, 0), so the path from the reference to (x,y) is D (the distance from the object to the plate), and then you go along the plate to (s,0), which is s units away, and then up y meters. Wait, no, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the path difference from the object is D, and from the reference, it's D - s (since the reference is s meters away from the object's position on the plate). So the path difference between the reference and the object at any point on the plate is s. Then, when this path difference is a multiple of the wavelength, you get constructive interference. But wait, the question is about the fringe spacing, which is the scale of detail. The spacing is determined by the wavelength and the geometry of the setup.

Another approach: The fringe spacing (the spacing between two adjacent bright fringes) is given by the formula (wavelength * distance from object to plate) / (distance between object and reference). So, beta = (lambda * D) / s.

In this case, D is 1 m, s is 0.1 m.

So, let's plug in the numbers:

lambda = 632.8 nm = 632.8e-9 m.

D = 1 m.

s = 0.1 m.

Beta = (632.8e-9 m * 1 m) / 0.1 m.

Beta = 632.8e-9 / 0.1 = 6.328e-7 m.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. Another way to think: the fringe spacing is the distance between two consecutive bright fringes, which is determined by the wavelength, the distance from the source to the plate (D), and the separation between the object and the reference (s). The formula is beta = (lambda * D) / s.

So with lambda = 632.8e-9 m, D=1 m, s=0.1 m.

Beta = (632.8e-9 * 1) / 0.1 = 632.8e-7 m = 6.328e-6 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 6.33e-6 m, which is very close to what I got.

Wait, but let me check the setup again. Another possibility is that the formula is beta = s * lambda / D. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because beta would then be in meters. Wait, no, beta must be in meters.

Wait, if the formula is beta = (lambda * s) / D, then that would be (632.8e-9 m * 0.1 m ) / 1 m = 6.328e-8 m, which is 63.3e-9 m. That's way smaller than any option given. So that can't be right.

Wait, I think I got it right the first time. So beta is (lambda * D) / s.

So with lambda=632.8e-9 m, D=1 m, s=0.1 m. So beta = (632.8e-9 * 1) / 0.1 = 6.328e-6 m, which is 6.328 micrometers.

Looking at the options, option D is 6.33 × 10^-6 m, which is very close. So that must be the answer.

To estimate the scale of detail in the hologram fringes, we use the formula for fringe spacing:

\[
\beta = \frac{\lambda D}{s}
\]

where:
- \( \lambda = 632.8 \, \text{nm} = 632.8 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) (wavelength),
- \( D = 1 \, \text{m} \) (distance from the reference and object to the hologram plate),
- \( s = 0.1 \, \text{m} \) (separation between the object and the reference).

Substituting the values:

\[
\beta = \frac{(632.8 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}) \times 1 \, \text{m}}{0.1 \, \text{m}} = \frac{632.8 \times 10^{-9}}{0.1} = 6.328 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
\]

This matches option D, \( 6.33 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \), which is the scale of detail in the hologram fringes.
