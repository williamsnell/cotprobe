Okay, so I have this question about effective change in a community. Let me think through it step by step. The question is asking which segment of society is responsible for achieving effective change. The options are A to J.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that different groups have different roles in change. Let me recall each option. 

Option A is the elderly. I think older people might have more experience and understanding, but I'm not sure if they're the ones who drive change in communities. Maybe they support it, but is their role the primary driver?

Option B is Early adapters. These are people who help the community adapt to changes. Like, if a new technology is introduced, early adapters would be those who help integrate people into it. That sounds important because they bridge the gap.

Option C is Early rejectors. These people might view change negatively, possibly due to fear or belief that it's not good for them. They might be resistant to change, but they probably set the stage for change by showing hesitation or resistance. But I'm not certain if they directly drive the change itself.

Option D is Late adapters. These would be those who come after the initial change has started. They might take the change forward, especially if it's successful. They could be the ones implementing strategies or leading the change process.

Option E is Children. I'm not sure about this. Children are often the ones who are reactive and may not drive change, but their influence could be significant in social changes. But I think the primary drivers are older groups.

Option F is Middle adapters. Middle class people might influence change, but I'm not sure if they're the main ones. It could be anyone who helps bridge the gap between different groups.

Option G is The poor. The poor might be influenced by their society, but I don't think they directly drive change. They might help others, but the change itself is more about the people in the community.

Option H is The wealthy. Wealthy individuals might have more influence, but again, the primary drivers are probably not them. They might support policies, but the actual change is more about the people.

Option I is Innovators. These are individuals who come up with new ideas. They might be the ones driving change, especially if they're proactive in their thinking. They could be the ones initiating change, but are they the ones achieving it?

Option J is Late rejectors. These might be people who view change as negative or disruptive. They could be the ones setting the middle ground but are they the ones causing change? Or they might just be there to support it.

Wait, thinking again. Effective change in a community probably starts with people who have a history of standing up for what's right. So, the early adapters (option B) would be the ones who bridge the community into change. Then, as the change progresses, the late adapters (option D) take over to implement the changes. Innovators (option I) might bring new ideas, but I'm not sure if they're the ones achieving the change.

Alternatively, thinking about the phases of change: initial, middle, and late. The initial phase might involve early adaptors who help integrate. The middle phase might have middle adapters helping bridge the gap. The late phase would have people who have already been part of the change and are now leading it forward.

So, the question is about achieving effective change. The initial step would have early adaptors, then the middle phase has middle adaptors, and the late phase has late adaptors. So, the effective change would be achieved by the late adaptors, which is option D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've heard that the innovators are a big part of the change process. But I think the people who are actually driving the change are the ones who have already been part of it. So, the people who have already made the change and are now active in it would be the ones who lead it forward. So, the answer should be D: Late adapters.

The effective change in a community is primarily achieved by the late adapters (option D). These individuals have already been part of the change process and are now leading it forward. Early adaptors (option B) help integrate into change, while early rejectors (option C) may set the stage but don't directly drive change. Innovators (option I) bring new ideas but are not the ones achieving change. The middle adapters (option F) bridge the gap, and the poor (option G) and wealthy (option H) may have influence but are not the primary drivers. Thus, the late adapters are the ones driving the change process.

Answer: D
