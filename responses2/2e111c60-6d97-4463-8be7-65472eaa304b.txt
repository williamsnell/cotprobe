Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reaction rates, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a reaction where the rate depends on the concentrations of NO and O2. The reactions given are:

1. The initial reaction is the photolytic decomposition of NO2 to form NO and O. But then the subsequent reaction they're looking at is 2NO + O2 → 2NO2. And the question is about the rate law for this second reaction.

The question gives some data: when the initial concentration of O2 is doubled while NO stays the same, the rate doubles. Also, when NO is doubled with O2 constant, the rate quadruples. We need to find the rate expression.

Hmm, I remember that the rate law depends on the order of the reaction with respect to each reactant. It's usually determined by the method of initial rates. So each experiment's changes and the effect on rate will help figure out the exponents.

Let's denote the rate as Rate = k [NO]^m [O2]^n, where m and n are the orders with respect to NO and O2.

First experiment: O2 is doubled. NO is held constant. The rate doubles. So, if I change [O2] from [O2] to 2[O2], and the rate also doubles, that suggests that the reaction is first order with respect to O2. Because if you double [O2], rate doubles, which is a first-order effect. So n=1.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because if I double O2, rate doubles, then yes that's first order. So n=1.

Second experiment: NO is doubled, O2 held constant. The rate quadruples. So if I double [NO], and the rate goes up by a factor of four. Let's see: Rate = k [NO]^m [O2]^1.

If I double [NO], [NO] becomes 2[NO], so the rate becomes k (2[NO])^m [O2]. This is 2^m times the original rate. According to the problem, this equals quadruple, so 2^m =4. So m is 2, because 2^2=4.

So the rate law would be Rate = k [NO]^2 [O2]^1.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check. Option G is [NO]^2 [O2], which fits. Let's see if any other options fit.

But wait, let me make sure. Let's think again. So when O2 is doubled, rate doubles (n=1). When NO is doubled, rate increases by 4 (so m=2). So the rate law is Rate = k [NO]^2 [O2].

Looking at the options, option G is "rate = k [NO]^2 [O2]^1", which matches m=2 and n=1.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says the initial reaction is the photolytic decomposition of NO2, but the reaction we're looking at is 2NO + O2 → 2NO2. So is the rate law for that reaction dependent on [NO2], or just [NO] and [O2]?

I think the rate law for the second reaction (2NO + O2 → 2NO2) depends only on the concentrations of the reactants in that reaction, which are NO and O2. So that's why our rate law is in terms of [NO]^2 [O2]^1.

So the correct rate expression would be the one where the exponents are 2 for NO and 1 for O2. Looking at the options:

Option G: rate = k [NO]^2 [O_2]^1 → yes, that's our conclusion.
</think>

The problem involves determining the rate law for the reaction \( 2\text{NO} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{NO}_2 \), where the rate depends on the concentrations of \(\text{NO}\) and \(\text{O}_2\). The experimental data provided allows us to deduce the reaction order with respect to each reactant.

1. **First experiment**: Doubling \(\text{O}_2\) while holding \(\text{NO}\) constant doubles the rate. This indicates that the reaction is first-order with respect to \(\text{O}_2\), so \( n = 1 \).

2. **Second experiment**: Doubling \(\text{NO}\) while holding \(\text{O}_2\) constant quadruples the rate. This suggests that the reaction is second-order with respect to \(\text{NO}\), so \( m = 2 \).

Combining these results, the rate law for the reaction is:

\[
\text{Rate} = k [\text{NO}]^2 [\text{O}_2]^1
\]

Now, comparing this with the given options:

- **Option G**: \(\text{rate} = k [\text{NO}]^2 [\text{O}_2]\) matches the derived rate law.

Other options are inconsistent with the experimental data. For example, options A, B, D, E, F, H, and I do not match the derived rate law.
