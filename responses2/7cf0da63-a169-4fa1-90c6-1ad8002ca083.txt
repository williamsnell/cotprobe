Okay, so I have this question about the housing construction industry and how it might change if commercial banks allow free competition between them and mutual savings banks. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that commercial banks are big players in the housing market. They're involved in issuing mortgages, which leads to loans that developers use to build houses. So, if commercial banks are allowed to compete freely with mutual savings banks, that would affect things like funding and competition in the housing market.

I think mutual savings banks are another type of financial institution, but I'm not exactly sure how they function. I know they're often considered banks, but I'm not clear on their specific role compared to commercial banks. Maybe they provide savings and investment products instead of mortgages? Or perhaps they have different regulatory statuses?

Wait, commercial banks do issue mortgages, which fund development projects. If they're allowed to compete freely, commercial banks would probably compete with these savings and investment banks. That might affect the supply of housing development projects. But how does that impact the industry?

I think if commercial banks are more competitive, they might offer better terms or services. Or perhaps they would have more funding to invest in housing development. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe competition would lead to more innovative or efficient projects because they can choose the best banks to get funding from.

Another angle: if commercial banks are more competitive, maybe they can influence the market more. For example, they might offer lower interest rates or better terms, which could encourage more homebuyers or investors to purchase properties. Or perhaps they can provide more affordable financing, making it easier for developers to build.

Looking at the options, let's see what they suggest. Option C says the industry would slump, which I'm not sure about. If competition is free, maybe it would create more competition, leading to more innovative and efficient projects, not a slumping industry. So maybe C isn't right.

Option A suggests the quality would deteriorate. That doesn't seem likely because competition would likely drive better quality, but I'm not certain. I think if more innovative banks are entering, they might improve services, not necessarily make things worse.

Option B says more houses could be bought. That could be the case if there's more competition, leading to higher demand and more availability of housing. But if commercial banks are more competitive, perhaps they can attract more buyers, leading to more houses sold.

Option E suggests deposits in mutual savings banks would increase. That doesn't seem right. If commercial banks are allowing competition, they might take over some of the savings roles, which would reduce the need for mutual savings banks to make as many deposits, perhaps increasing their own deposits instead.

Option F says housing prices would become more volatile. That could happen if there's competition for development projects, leading to fluctuations in demand and supply. If more properties are sold and others aren't, prices might go up and down. But I'm not sure if that's the main impact.

Option G suggests a boom. If competition is intense and leads to better quality, maybe the industry would thrive, leading to a boom. That makes sense because more competition can drive up prices and innovation.

Option H says commercial banks would focus on large-scale developments. I'm not sure. If they're more competitive, maybe they'd spread their resources, but I don't know if they'd all focus on the same type of projects. It might depend on their strategies.

Option I says no noticeable change. That's unlikely because competition would likely drive changes.

Option D says mutual savings banks would become obsolete. That doesn't make sense because the competition isn't with traditional savings banks; it's more about commercial banks. They might continue to exist but with perhaps less funding or different roles.

Putting it all together, the most likely outcome is a boom in the housing industry. More competition would drive innovation and better services, leading to higher demand and increased housing availability. So the correct answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: The housing industry would boom.

**Explanation:**
If commercial banks allow free competition with mutual savings banks, the housing development industry is expected to experience a boom. This is because competition would lead to the creation of more innovative and efficient projects, driven by better terms and funding. While mutual savings banks might reduce their deposits, this doesn't negate the potential for a significant increase in housing construction activity.
