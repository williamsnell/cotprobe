Okay, so I need to find the logarithm of 0.0364. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on logarithms, but I'll try to work through this step by step. 

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, especially for numbers less than 1. I think the logarithm of a number between 0 and 1 is negative because as the number gets smaller, the log becomes more negative. So 0.0364 is definitely less than 1, which means its log should be negative. Looking at the options, all the answers are negative except maybe F: -2.0364, but I'll check that first.

Wait, no, F is negative, so that can't be the right answer. Let me think about how to calculate log(0.0364). I think I can express this number in scientific notation to make it easier. 

0.0364 is the same as 3.64 × 10^-2. So log(0.0364) equals log(3.64 × 10^-2). Using logarithm properties, this is log(3.64) + log(10^-2). Log(10^-2) is straightforward because log(10^x) = x. So log(10^-2) is -2. Therefore, the equation becomes log(3.64) - 2.

Now I need to find log(3.64). I'm not exactly sure of the exact value, but I can approximate it or use some logarithm tables or remember some common logs. Let's think: I know that log(3) is about 0.4771, and log(4) is about 0.6021. Since 3.64 is between 3 and 4, its log should be between 0.4771 and 0.6021. 

Let me try to approximate it. The difference between 3 and 4 is 1, and 3.64 is 0.64 above 3. So what's 0.64 in terms of the interval from 3 to 4? 0.64/1 = 0.64. Maybe I can use linear approximation or another method. Alternatively, maybe I can remember that log(3.6) is approximately 0.5563 (I'm not sure, but I think that's right), and log(3.64) would be a bit higher. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using a calculator approach. Let me think: I can use the Taylor series or some linear approximation. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I remember that log(3.64) is about 0.5623. Wait, wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 3.6 is 0.5682, and 3.64 would be a bit higher. Let me get this straight.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to remember that log(3.64) is approximately 0.563. Let me think why: because 10^0.563 is approximately 3.64. Because 10^0.56 is about 3.63, and 10^0.563 is a bit higher. So I can say log(3.64) is about 0.563.

So then log(0.0364) is 0.563 - 2 = -1.437. Looking at the options, option A is -1.4389, which is very close to this value. Let me check if I did the steps correctly. Oh wait, perhaps I should double-check the approximation of log(3.64). Another way: I know that log(3.64) is between log(3.6) and log(3.7). Let me think about these.

We know that log(3.6) is approximately 0.5563, and log(3.7) is about 0.5682. So 3.64 is 0.04 above 3.6. So the difference between 3.6 and 3.7 is 0.1 in the number, which is 0.1. The difference in their logs is 0.5682 - 0.5563 = 0.0119 over 0.1. So for every 0.01 increase in the number, the log increases by about 0.0119 / 0.1 = 0.119 per 0.01. But wait, wait, actually, 0.01 in the number (from 3.6 to 3.61) would increase log by 0.119. So 0.04 from 3.6 is (0.04 / 0.01) * 0.119 = 0.476. So log(3.64) ≈ 0.5563 + 0.476 = 0.5563 + 0.476 = 1.0323? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 3.64 is bigger than 3.6, so the log should be bigger than 0.5563. Wait, I think I messed up the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: the change from 3.6 to 3.64 is 0.04. Since for every 0.01 increase in the number, the log increases by about 0.0119 / 0.1 = 0.119 per 0.01. But wait, 0.04 is 4 times 0.01, so 4 * 0.119 = 0.476. So adding that to 0.5563 gives 0.5563 + 0.476 ≈ 1.0323. Hmm, but that can't be right because 3.64 is way larger than 3.6 and 3.7, so the log should be around 0.56 or 0.57.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. The issue is that the formula for linear approximation is f(x + Δx) ≈ f(x) + f’(x) * Δx. Here, x is 3.6, f(x) is log(3.6) ≈ 0.5563. The derivative f’(x) is 1/(x ln 10). Wait, let's calculate that. ln(10) is approximately 2.3026. So 1/(3.6 * 2.3026) ≈ 1/(8.289) ≈ 0.1207. So f’(x) is about 0.1207 per unit x.

So for Δx = 0.04, the change in f(x) is approximately Δx * f’(x) = 0.04 * 0.1207 ≈ 0.004828. So log(3.64) ≈ 0.5563 + 0.0048 ≈ 0.5611. So that's around 0.5611. So then log(0.0364) is 0.5611 - 2 ≈ -1.4389. 

Looking at the options, option A is -1.4389. So that's probably the correct answer. Let me check other options to make sure I didn't confuse any. 

Another approach: perhaps I can use the known values. I know that log(10) is 1, log(2) is about 0.3010. Wait, but 0.0364 is 3.64e-2. Maybe another way to think is that 0.0364 is 364 × 10^-5, which is 3.64 × 10^-2. So log(3.64e-2) = log(3.64) - 2.

Alternatively, I know that log(3.64) is approximately 0.562, so subtracting 2 gives -1.438.

So the correct answer is option A.

To find the logarithm of 0.0364, we can express it in scientific notation: \(0.0364 = 3.64 \times 10^{-2}\). Using logarithm properties, this becomes:

\[
\log(0.0364) = \log(3.64 \times 10^{-2}) = \log(3.64) + \log(10^{-2})
\]

Since \(\log(10^{-2}) = -2\), we need to find \(\log(3.64)\). Through approximation and linear interpolation, it is determined that \(\log(3.64) \approx 0.5611\). Therefore:

\[
\log(0.0364) = 0.5611 - 2 = -1.4389
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is **A: -1.4389**.
