Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about comparing two pay schedules for Loretta Gould. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the question says she's offered a sales position for Houston Oil Company. The first year, her sales would be around $80,000. She can choose between two pay plans.

Let me read the options again. The first pay plan is a salary of $8,000 plus 1% commission on all sales. The second is a salary of $5,800 plus 5% commission but only on sales over $30,000. I need to figure out which plan is better for her in terms of total pay.

Wait, so I think the key here is to calculate the total pay for each plan and compare them. Let's break it down.

For the first plan (Plan 1):
- Salary: $8,000
- Commission: 1% of sales. If sales are $80,000, that's 0.01 * 80,000 = $800. So total pay is 8,000 + 800 = $8,800.

For the second plan (Plan 2):
- Salary: $5,800
- Commission: 5% on sales over $30,000. So, first, the sales over $30k is 50k, right? Because 80k -30k is 50k. So, 5% of 50k is 2,500. So total pay is 5,800 + 2,500 = $8,300.

Wait, so Plan 1 gives $8,800 and Plan 2 gives $8,300. So Plan 1 is better by $500. Oh wait, option J says Plan 1 is better by $500. But wait, let me make sure I did the calculations right.

Wait no, for Plan 2, it's 5% of sales over $30k. So 80k over 30k is 50k. 5% of 50k is 2,500. So yes, Plan 2 adds $2,500, making the total $8,300. Plan 1 adds $800, so $8,800. So Plan 1 is better by $500.

But wait, I'm a little confused because the question is asking by how much. So Plan 1 is $8,800, Plan 2 is $8,300. The difference is $500. So Plan 1 is better by $500. So the correct option would be J.

Wait, but let me double-check the numbers. Plan 1: 1% of 80k is 800, plus 8000 is 8800. Plan 2: 5% of 50k is 2500, plus 5800 is 8300. So 8800 minus 8300 is 500. Oh, so Plan 1 is better by $500. So option J is correct.

Wait but the options are A to J. Let's see:

A: same → No.
B: 300 better → No.
C: different → No.
D: 1,200 better → No.
E: 500 better → Yes.
F: 700 better → No.
G: 700 worse → No.
H: 500 worse? Wait H says 500 worse. No, Plan 1 is better, so H is wrong.
I: 500 better? No, because Plan 2 is better.
J: 500 better → Yes.

So the correct answer should be option J. But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the commission calculation.

Wait Plan 2's commission: 5% over 30k. So 80k, minus 30k is 50k. 5% of 50k is 2500. So Plan 2's total is 5800 + 2500 = 8300. Plan 1 is 8000 + 800 = 8800. Difference is 500. So J is correct.

The question compares two pay plans for Loretta Gould, evaluating which is better by calculating the total pay for each. 

**Plan 1**: Salary $8,000 + 1% commission on $80,000 sales.  
- Commission: 1% of $80,000 = $800.  
- Total: $8,000 + $800 = $8,800.

**Plan 2**: Salary $5,800 + 5% commission on sales over $30,000.  
- Sales over $30,000: $80,000 - $30,000 = $50,000.  
- Commission: 5% of $50,000 = $2,500.  
- Total: $5,800 + $2,500 = $8,300.

The difference between Plan 1 and Plan 2 is $8,800 - $8,300 = $500. Plan 1 is better by $500.

**Answer: J**
