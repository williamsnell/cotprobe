Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this interest question. Let me read it again. Jerry has a loan of $400 for 60 days at 6% per year. I need to find out how much interest he'll pay. The options are from A to J, each with a different dollar amount.

Hmm, I remember that interest calculations can be a bit tricky, especially when dealing with exact days and the method used. There's simple interest and maybe some kind of discount involved. Wait, but since it's a loan, probably simple interest. 

So, the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, right? Where P is the principal amount, R is the annual interest rate, and T is the time in years. 

Let me plug in the numbers. P is $400. R is 6% per year, which is 0.06 as a decimal. T is 60 days, but since it's per year, I need to convert days to years. There are 365 days in a year, so 60 days is 60/365. Let me calculate that. 60 divided by 365 is approximately 0.1644 years.

Now, multiply all together: 400 * 0.06 * 0.1644. Let me compute this step by step. 

First, 400 * 0.06 is 24. Then, 24 * 0.1644. Let me compute 24 * 0.1644. Hmm, 24 * 0.1 is 2.4, 24 * 0.06 is 1.44, 24 * 0.0044 is about 0.1056. Adding those: 2.4 + 1.44 = 3.84, plus 0.1056 is 3.9456. So approximately $3.9456. But looking at the options, the closest is $4.00. 

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe I should check if the interest is calculated using exact days or if there's a different method. Oh, another thing: sometimes in banking, the exact days might be considered, but 60 days is exactly 1/6 of a year, so my calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a simple interest calculation without compounding, which is the case here. So, I think $4.00 is the right answer, which is option G. 

But let me double-check. Maybe I should calculate it more precisely. 60 days is 60/365 = 0.16438356 years. 400 * 0.06 = 24. 24 * 0.16438356 = let's do this multiplication precisely. 

24 * 0.16438356: 24 * 0.16 is 3.84, 24 * 0.00438356 is approximately 24 * 0.004 = 0.096, and 24 * 0.00038356 ≈ 0.009205. So adding 3.84 + 0.096 = 3.936 + 0.0092 = 3.9452. So about $3.9452, which rounds to $3.95. But the options don't have that. The closest is $4.00, so option G.

Wait another thought: sometimes, people use the actual number of days in the month, but 60 days is exactly 1/6 of a year, so it's the same as using 365 days. So no, no rounding issues there.

So the correct answer should be option G, $4.00.

The interest Jerry will pay is calculated using simple interest. Using the formula I = P * R * T, where P = $400, R = 6% (0.06), and T = 60/365 ≈ 0.1644 years, the calculation yields approximately $3.95, which rounds to $4.00. 

Answer: G
