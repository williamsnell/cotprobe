Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Metz's argument regarding dignity. Let me think through this step by step.

The question asks: "Metz argues that dignity is based in..." and then gives several options from A to J. The options are all about different capacities: emotional intelligence, scientific understanding, relationships, feelings, etc. 

I remember that Metz is a philosopher, I think, and his work on morality and human dignity. Metz wrote a book called "The Human Condition" where he discusses various aspects of human nature. I recall that he talks a lot about how people's dignity isn't just about their physical abilities or emotions but also about their relationships and how they handle others.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A is emotional intelligence. Metz might not focus on that. He's more about how people develop their capacity for certain things. 

Option B is scientific understanding. Metz's work is more philosophical, not really empirical. I don't think he's arguing that dignity is based on scientific understanding.

Option C is communal or friendly relationships. While relationships are important, Metz doesn't emphasize that as the basis for dignity. He talks more about the inherent qualities people possess, like how they feel and how they handle others.

Option D is a capacity for certain kinds of feelings or sentiments. That sounds more like what Metz is pointing out. He likely argues that people have a capacity for specific feelings that contribute to their dignity. Like, it's not just about being compassionate or charismatic, but having a genuine, unshakable sense of self and others' worth.

Option E is independent thinking. Metz doesn't think that's the main factor. He seems to focus more on the inherent qualities of people rather than individual thinking.

Option F is moral thought. I'm not sure. Metz might not be just talking about moral reasoning but more about the emotional and relational basis.

Option G is rational deliberation. That sounds too narrow. Metz's argument is more about the qualities people inherently possess rather than a process.

Option H is physical strength. That's not related to dignity at all.

Option I is artistic expression. Again, not relevant to the concept of dignity.

Option J is spiritual enlightenment. That's a bit different from what I'm thinking. Metz's focus is more on the subjective nature of human dignity.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be D: a capacity for certain kinds of feelings or sentiments. Metz's argument likely centers around how people possess these emotions or sentiments that give them dignity, beyond just their abilities or relationships.

Metz's argument about dignity centers on the idea that people possess specific feelings or sentiments that give them a certain quality of self-worth. These qualities are not merely about their physical capabilities or relationships but are intrinsic. 

Answer: D
