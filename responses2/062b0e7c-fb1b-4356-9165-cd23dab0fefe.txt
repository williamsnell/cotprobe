Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the GDP Deflator and some statements about it. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question lists three statements (I, II, III) and asks which are true. The options are A to H, each saying different combinations of these statements.

First, I need to recall what each term means. Let me start by remembering what the CPI and GDP Deflator are. 

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services purchased by consumers. It's a key indicator of inflation. The GDP Deflator, on the other hand, is used to measure the change in prices of all goods and services produced within a country. It's calculated using the same formula as CPI but with all goods and services, including those produced domestically and imported.

Wait, so statement I says the GDP Deflator is used to calculate inflation rates. That sounds correct because both the CPI and GDP Deflator are inflation measures. So I think statement I is true.

Statement II says the GDP Deflator is an alternative to the CPI. Hmm. I remember that the CPI is a national measure, whereas the GDP Deflator is a national (or international) measure because it includes all goods and services. So, yes, the GDP Deflator is used as an alternative to the CPI. So II is also true.

Statement III claims that the GDP Deflator is more accurate than the CPI. I'm not so sure about that. I think the CPI is more accurate because it's based on a fixed basket of goods, meaning it stays the same over time. The GDP Deflator, however, is based on all goods and services, which might capture more changes but also might include more items. Also, because the basket changes over time, the Deflator can capture broader changes. So I think the GDP Deflator isn't more accurate; it's more comprehensive. So III is false.

So putting it together: I and II are true, III is false. Looking at the options, option B says I and II are true. So the answer should be B.

The correct answer is B, as statements I and II are true, while statement III is false.

Answer: B
