Okay, so I've got this legal question to tackle. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about an association suing a city over federal statutes. The city's attorney is being called as an adverse witness, and they're objecting because the information they've communicated is confidential. The question is about what privilege law applies here.

First, I need to recall what privilege laws are. Privilege refers to the right to keep information confidential, as opposed to access. The question is about which privilege law applies in this scenario.

In the case of an association suing a city, the city's attorney is being called to testify against the association. The city attorney is bringing an objection based on the attorney-client privilege. The question is, under which privilege law does this apply?

I remember that privilege laws can vary by state and forum state. The federal privilege law is the general rule, but the city's own privilege law applies if it's a city matter. There's also something about the privilege in the forum state, which is determined by the court.

So the city is a party to the suit, so they can use their own privilege law. The question is whether the city's privilege law covers the objection. But I also remember that federal law doesn't always override state laws, but in this case, the city is using their own privilege. So the objection should be against the city's privilege law.

Looking at the options, option D says "city’s privilege law." That matches what I'm thinking. But wait, sometimes the federal privilege law is considered. Could it be either? Or does it specifically apply to the city's?

Wait, the national association is suing the city, so the city is the defendant. The city's attorney is the witness. The objection is about privilege. Since the city is the defendant, the privilege law in the city's place would apply. So D is correct.

But what about the federal privilege law? The question says the suit is against federal statutes. So the issue is whether the privilege is federal or state. The city is a state entity, so their own privilege would apply. So D is the right choice.

Therefore, the answer should be D: the privilege law of the city.

The city attorney's objection to the information communicated is based on the city's privilege law. The city is the defendant, so its privilege applies. 

Answer: D: the privilege law of the city.
