Okay, so I've got this problem here about Joe's Department Store selling a coat. Let me see what they're asking. The question says they want to sell the coat with a 20% margin on the selling price. The cost of the coat is $40. I need to find the selling price from the given options.

Hmm, wait, what does a 20% margin mean exactly? I think there are a couple of ways to interpret this. One common way is that the margin is the profit they make, which is 20% of the selling price. Another possibility is that it's a markup on the cost. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definition. Let me think.

Oh right, sometimes "margin" refers to the profit relative to the selling price. So if the store wants a 20% margin on the selling price, that means their profit is 20% of the SP. Alternatively, some might think of the margin as the percentage of the cost, like 20% markup on cost. I need to clarify this.

Wait, the problem says "20% margin on the selling price." So that would mean the margin is 20% of SP. Let me model this with equations. Let me denote the selling price as S. The cost is $40. The margin is SP minus the cost, which should equal 20% of SP. So:

Margin (SP - Cost) = 0.20 * SP

Substituting the cost:

S - 40 = 0.20 * S

Now, solving for S. Let's rearrange:

S - 0.20S = 40
0.80S = 40
S = 40 / 0.80
S = 50

So the selling price would be $50. Looking at the options, H is $50. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, let me double-check. If the cost is $40 and selling price is $50, then the profit is $10. 10 is 20% of 50, which fits. Alternatively, if we considered the margin as a cost-based 20%, that would be a different calculation. But the question clearly states "on the selling price," so I think the first approach is correct.

The selling price is calculated by considering the cost and the desired margin. The margin is 20% of the selling price, which leads to the selling price being $50, option H.

Answer: H
