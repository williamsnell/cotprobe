Okay, so I have this physics problem here about mirrors. Let me try to work through it step by step. So, the setup is a concave and a convex mirror, each with a radius of 10 cm, placed 20 cm apart. There's an object 3 cm high in the middle. I need to find where the image forms after reflecting first at the convex mirror and then at the concave one. The options are given, but I should try to figure it out myself.

First, I remember that the radius of curvature for a spherical mirror is twice the radius of the mirror. So, for both the convex and concave mirrors, their radii are 10 cm, so their focal lengths would be half of that. Wait, for convex mirrors, the focal length is positive (since I think convex mirrors have positive focal lengths because they diverge the light). For concave mirrors, it's negative because they converge.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the radius of curvature is R. For a convex mirror, the focal length f is R/2, but because it's a convex mirror, the focal length is positive in the sign convention. For a concave mirror, f is negative because it's a converging mirror. So, both in this problem, the convex has R =10 cm, so f=5 cm. Concave mirror has same R, so f=-5 cm.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. The focal length for convex mirrors is positive because they have a virtual, upright image. For concave mirrors, it's negative. So, if the radius of curvature is 10 cm, then the focal length is R/2. So for convex, f = +5 cm, and concave, f = -5 cm.

Wait, but wait, the problem says each has a radius of 10 cm. So yes, both would have f of 5 cm and -5 cm, respectively.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no. Wait, the radius of curvature is R, so f = R/2. So for convex, f = R/2 positive, concave is R/2 negative. So yes, both have f=+5 and -5 cm.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the mirrors are placed 20 cm apart. And the object is midway between them. So the object is 10 cm from each mirror.

Wait, but wait, wait. The object is midway between the two mirrors, which are 20 cm apart. So each is 10 cm from the object. So the object is at 10 cm from each mirror.

Now, the order is: first, the object is placed between the two mirrors. The first reflection is at the convex mirror, then the image formed by the convex is then placed to reflect off the concave, which is 20 cm away from the convex.

Wait, no. The setup is that the two mirrors are 20 cm apart. So, say mirror A is on the left, mirror B on the right, 20 cm apart. The object is in the middle. So, the object is 10 cm from each mirror.

So the first reflection is at the convex (mirror A), and then the image from the convex is reflected at the concave (mirror B), which is 20 cm away from mirror A.

Wait, but wait, if the object is between mirrors A and B (20 cm apart), then the object is 10 cm from each. So the order of the mirrors and the object is: object is at position O, which is 10 cm from mirror A and 10 cm from mirror B.

Wait, but the mirrors are placed 20 cm apart. So, I think the two mirrors are arranged such that they are, say, mirror A on the left and mirror B on the right, 20 cm away from each other. The object is located in the middle, so 10 cm from each mirror.

Now, the first reflection is at mirror A (convex), then the image is formed by mirror A, which is then used as the object for mirror B (concave), which is 20 cm away from mirror A.

Wait, but wait, the distance between mirrors A and B is 20 cm. So, mirror A is at position x, mirror B is at x+20 cm. The object is at x+10 cm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates. Let me imagine: Let's place mirror A at x=0 cm. Then mirror B is at x=20 cm. The object is at x=10 cm.

So, first, the object is at 10 cm. The first reflection is at mirror A. So mirror A is the convex mirror. So, the object is virtual (since it's in front of the convex mirror; wait, no, the object is at 10 cm, which is 10 cm from mirror A. So when the object is placed in front of a convex mirror (focal length positive), the image will be virtual and located behind the mirror. So the image formed by mirror A is virtual, located behind mirror A, at a certain distance, and then this image becomes the object for mirror B.

Wait, but when an object is in front of a convex mirror, the image is virtual and located behind the mirror. So the image is formed on the same side as the object, but beyond the mirror. Hmm, but in reality, when you place an object in front of a convex mirror, the image appears as if it's behind the mirror, so the image is virtual.

But let me think again. For a convex mirror, if the object is placed at a distance u from the mirror, the image is formed at a distance v, with v negative if the image is virtual. The magnification is negative, indicating the image is upright and virtual.

So, the object is 10 cm in front of convex mirror A (f=5 cm). So, u = 10 cm for mirror A. So, using the mirror equation 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Let's compute v.

f = 5 cm, u=10 cm.

1/5 = 1/10 + 1/v.

Solving for 1/v: 1/v = 1/5 - 1/10 = (2-1)/10 = 1/10.

So 1/v = 1/10 → v=10 cm.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Oh no, wait: the object is behind the mirror? No, wait, wait. Wait, for a convex mirror, objects are always placed in front of the mirror, so I think I made a mistake in my earlier calculation.

Wait, wait, let me think again.

The object is in front of mirror A. So mirror A is the convex mirror. So, the object is at u=10 cm from mirror A. Using the mirror equation for convex mirrors, 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. For convex, f is positive. So u=10 cm.

1/5 = 1/10 + 1/v → 1/v = 1/5 - 1/10 = (2/10 -1/10)=1/10. So 1/v=1/10 → v=10 cm.

But wait, that would mean the image is 10 cm behind mirror A. But that's not possible because the object is in front of the mirror. Wait, but for mirror A (convex), the image will be virtual and on the same side as the object, but beyond the mirror. Wait, no, for a convex mirror, the image is always virtual, located behind the mirror, regardless of the object's position.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of sign conventions. The object distance u is positive for mirror A (since it's in front of the mirror), and for mirror B, which is 20 cm behind, the object distance would be negative (since the object is on the opposite side of the mirror's surface from the incoming light). Hmm, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the object is in front of mirror A, and the image is virtual, so it's on the same side as the object, beyond the mirror. So, for mirror A, u is positive, and v is positive but in front? Wait, no, the image is virtual, so it's on the same side as the object, but beyond the mirror. So, in mirror A's case, u is positive, and v is positive as well, but the image is formed behind the mirror. Hmm, perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation.

So, the image is formed at v=10 cm on the same side as the object, which would be in front of mirror A. Wait, but that's not possible because convex mirrors always produce virtual images. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the sign conventions.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the mirror equation as:

1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

For mirror A (convex), u is negative because the object is in front of the mirror. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, I think I was getting confused earlier. The object is placed in front of the mirror (mirror A), so in the case of mirror A, which is convex and positive f, the object is at u=10 cm (positive), and the mirror equation would yield a positive v, which indicates that the image is on the same side as the object, beyond the mirror. So, the image would be virtual and located at v=10 cm behind the mirror. So, the image is located 10 cm behind mirror A.

Wait, that's right. So mirror A is convex, and the image is formed 10 cm behind it. So, the image is at 10 cm from mirror A, but on the same side as the object. So, the image is behind mirror A, making the image virtual.

Now, the image formed by mirror A is then placed in front of mirror B (the concave mirror). The distance between the two mirrors is 20 cm. So, mirror A is at x=0, mirror B at x=20 cm. The image from mirror A is at x=10 cm (mirror A's position) plus 10 cm behind it, so at x=0 + (-10 cm) = x= -10 cm? No, wait. Wait, if mirror A is at x=0, and the image is 10 cm behind it, that would be at x=0 -10 cm = x= -10 cm. Because behind the mirror is negative x.

Wait, no, wait. If mirror A is at x=0, and the image is behind, it's at x= -10 cm. So, the image is at x= -10 cm.

But the object is at x=10 cm. So, the image from mirror A (x=-10 cm) is now the object for mirror B. Mirror B is at x=20 cm. So the distance between the image from mirror A and mirror B is the distance between x= -10 cm and x=20 cm. That distance is 30 cm. So, the object for mirror B is 30 cm away.

Now, mirror B is concave, so its focal length is f = -5 cm. So, using mirror equation again for mirror B.

Object is at x=-10 cm relative to mirror B's position at x=20 cm. So, the object distance u is the distance from mirror B to object. Since the object is at x=10 cm relative to mirror A, which is at x=0, the object is at x=10 cm for mirror A. But mirror B is at x=20 cm. So the object for mirror B is at x=10 cm relative to mirror A, which is 10 cm behind mirror A. But mirror A is 20 cm to the left of mirror B, so the object is 30 cm to the left of mirror B.

Alternatively, the object is at x=10 cm relative to mirror A, but mirror A is at x=0, and mirror B is at x=20. So, the object is at x=10 relative to mirror A. So, from mirror B's perspective, which is at x=20, the object is at x=10 cm, which is 10 cm behind mirror B (since mirror B is at x=20, x=10 is 10 cm to the left of 20). So, the object distance u is 10 cm (because it's 10 cm in front of mirror B). Wait, but wait, no. Because the object is 10 cm to the left of mirror B, which is at x=20. So, the distance from mirror B (x=20) to object (x=10) is 10 cm. So, from mirror B's point of view, the object is at u= -10 cm? Because it's 10 cm in front, but in the mirror's coordinate system, the front is positive.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the sign conventions for each mirror. For mirror A, which is convex, the object is at u=10 cm. Then the image is at v= -10 cm (behind mirror A). For mirror B, which is concave, the object is at a distance of 30 cm (from mirror B, object is 10 cm to the left, so u= -30 cm? Because from mirror B's perspective, the object is 30 cm in front.)

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Mirror A is at position x=0. Mirror B is at x=20. The object is at x=10.

Mirror A's image is at x=-10 (10 cm behind mirror A). So, when considering mirror B, the object is at x=10 (mirror A's position) + 10 cm (distance from mirror A to image) → x=20 cm. Wait, no, that can't be, because mirror A's image is at x=-10 (so mirror B is at x=20. The distance between mirror A and mirror B is 20 cm, so the image is 30 cm away from mirror B.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the distance between mirrors as 20 cm. So, the image from mirror A is 10 cm behind mirror A and 20 cm behind mirror B. So, the image is at x=-10 cm from mirror A, which is 10 cm behind. So, from mirror B's position (x=20), the image is 20 + 10 = 30 cm to the right. So, the image from mirror A is at x=30 cm relative to mirror B. So, the distance between the image (at x=30 cm) and mirror B is 30 cm.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the image from mirror A is at x=-10 cm relative to mirror A. Mirror A is at x=0, so the image is at x=-10 cm. Mirror B is at x=20. So, the distance between image (x=-10) and mirror B (x=20) is 20 - (-10) = 30 cm. So, the object for mirror B is 30 cm away from mirror B.

But the object is at x=-10 cm relative to mirror A. So, from mirror B's position (x=20), the object is at x=20 + ( -10 ) = 10 cm. So, the object is 10 cm to the left of mirror B, which is 10 cm in front of mirror B (since mirror B is at x=20, and x=10 is 10 cm to the left, which is front of mirror B). So, in terms of mirror B, the object distance u is negative 10 cm (because it's 10 cm in front of mirror B, so from the mirror's perspective, the object is 10 cm in front, so u is -10 cm. Wait, no, wait: In the mirror's own coordinate system, the object is to the left of the mirror, so u is negative. So, the object is at x=10 cm relative to the mirror B's position, which is at x=20. So, from mirror B's perspective, the object is at x=10 cm, which is 10 cm to the left, so u is negative 10 cm.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The object is 10 cm in front of mirror B. So, in the mirror's own coordinate system, the object is located at u = -10 cm (because it's in front, the positive direction is away from the mirror). So, for mirror B, the mirror equation is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

Mirror B is concave, so f = -5 cm. u is -10 cm, because the object is in front of it. So,

1/(-5) = 1/(-10) + 1/v.

Compute:

1/(-5) = -1/5.

1/(-10) = -1/10.

So,

-1/5 = (-1/10) + (1/v).

So,

-1/5 + 1/10 = 1/v.

-2/10 +1/10 = -1/10 = 1/v → v = -10 cm.

Wait, that makes the image virtual and located 10 cm behind mirror B. So, the image is 10 cm behind mirror B.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Let me recap:

Mirror A is at x=0. Object is at x=10 cm.

Mirror A (convex) produces an image at x= -10 cm.

Mirror B is at x=20 cm. The image from mirror A is at x=20 -10 = 10 cm. So, the object for mirror B is at x=10 cm, which is 10 cm to the left of mirror B. So, u for mirror B is -10 cm.

Mirror B's focal length f is -5 cm (concave).

So, using mirror equation:

1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

1/(-5) = 1/(-10) + 1/v.

-1/5 = -1/10 + 1/v.

Multiply all terms by 10 to eliminate denominators:

-2 = (-1) + 10/v.

-2 +1 = 10/v → -1 = 10/v → v = -10 cm.

So, the image formed by mirror B is at v=-10 cm, which is 10 cm behind mirror B. So, the final image is 10 cm behind mirror B.

Wait, but the question is, where is the final image formed? So, in the coordinate system, mirror B is at x=20 cm. The image is at x=20 cm -10 cm= 10 cm. Wait, but that's in the same coordinate system as the mirrors.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm considering the location of the image.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not have considered the distance from mirror B, but think in terms of the distance between mirrors.

Wait, but maybe the confusion is arising from the fact that the image is formed 10 cm behind mirror B. But when the object is at 10 cm from mirror B, the image location is at 10 cm behind mirror B, which would be 20 + (-10) =10 cm from mirror B. So, the image is at 10 cm from mirror B, which is 10 cm behind it.

So, the image is at x=10 cm relative to mirror B's position, which is at x=20, so x=30 cm? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no, because if mirror B is at x=20, and the image is 10 cm behind it, then the image is at x=20 -10 =10 cm. So, it's 10 cm from mirror B, behind it.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Let me try to recompute.

Mirror A is at x=0. Object is at x=10 cm. Mirror A's image is at x= -10 cm (10 cm behind mirror A). This image is 10 cm behind mirror A, and 30 cm behind mirror B (since mirror B is at x=20 cm). The image is at x= -10 cm, which is 10 cm behind mirror A and 30 cm behind mirror B.

Now, this image (x=-10 cm) is the object for mirror B, which is at x=20 cm. The distance between mirror A's image and mirror B is 30 cm. So, the object is at 30 cm from mirror B.

But mirror B is concave, f= -5 cm.

Using mirror equation:

1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

u = -30 cm (object is in front of mirror B, so u is negative 30 cm).

f = -5 cm.

1/(-5) = 1/(-30) + 1/v.

Compute:

-1/5 = -1/30 + 1/v.

Multiply all terms by 30:

-6 = -1 + 30/v.

-6 +1 = 30/v → -5 = 30/v → v= -6 cm.

Wait, that would make the image formed at v= -6 cm, which is 6 cm behind mirror B. But that's conflicting with previous calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign conventions. Let me try again.

Mirror A is convex, f=5 cm. Object is at u=10 cm (distance to the left of mirror A). So, using mirror equation:

1/f = 1/u + 1/v → 1/5 = 1/10 +1/v → 1/v = 1/5 - 1/10 = (2-1)/10 → 1/10→ v=10 cm. So image is 10 cm on the same side as the object, which is behind mirror A.

Mirror B is concave, f=-5 cm. The image from mirror A is at x= -10 cm relative to mirror A. Mirror A is at x=0, so the image is at x=-10 cm. Mirror B is at x=20 cm. So, the distance between the image (x=-10 cm) and mirror B is 20 -(-10) =30 cm. So, the object for mirror B is 30 cm away.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a table.

Mirror A: convex, f=5 cm.

- Object is at u=10 cm (distance to left of mirror A). So, image is at v=10 cm (distance to left of mirror A). So, image is 10 cm behind mirror A.

Mirror B: concave, f=-5 cm.

- Object is at u= -30 cm (distance to left of mirror B) → because image from A is 10 cm behind mirror A, which is 30 cm behind mirror B (mirror B is at x=20, so 20 +30=50 cm. Wait, no, that's another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering the image from mirror A as the object for mirror B.

Mirror A: convex, f=5 cm.

Object at u=10 cm (distance to left of mirror A).

Image is at v=10 cm (distance to left of mirror A).

So, the image is 10 cm behind mirror A, which is 10 cm behind mirror A (because mirror A is at x=0). So, in the coordinate system, image is at x= -10 cm.

Mirror B is at x=20 cm. So, the distance between image (x=-10) and mirror B is 20 - (-10) =30 cm. So, the object for mirror B is 30 cm away.

So, mirror B (concave, f=-5 cm).

Object at u= -30 cm (distance to left of mirror B).

So, using mirror equation:

1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

1/(-5) = 1/(-30) + 1/v.

Compute:

1/(-5) = -1/5.

1/(-30) = -1/30.

So,

-1/5 = (-1/30) + 1/v.

So,

-1/5 +1/30 =1/v.

Convert to common denominator:

-6/30 +1/30 = (-5)/30 =1/v.

So,

1/v = (-5)/30 → v= -6 cm.

So, the image formed by mirror B is at v= -6 cm relative to mirror B's position at x=20 cm. So, the image is at x=20 + (-6) =14 cm.

Wait, no. Because if mirror B is at x=20 cm, and the image is formed 6 cm in front (because 1/v is negative → the image is on the same side as the object, but wait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the image is formed 6 cm in front of mirror B.

Wait, no, because the image is formed 6 cm in front of mirror B, which is at x=20 cm, so the image is at x=20 +6=26 cm.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave v= -6 cm relative to mirror B. So, the image is 6 cm behind mirror B, which is at x=20 cm, so at x=14 cm.

Wait, but that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the image from mirror B as being formed 6 cm in front of mirror B, which is at x=20 cm, so the image is at x=26 cm.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the image is at x=14 cm.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me approach this differently.

Mirror B: concave, f= -5 cm.

Object is at u= -30 cm (distance to left of mirror B).

Using mirror equation:

1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

1/(-5) = 1/(-30) + 1/v.

Solving:

1/(-5) = (-1/5).

1/(-30) = (-1/30).

So,

-1/5 = (-1/30) + (1/v).

Subtract (-1/30) from both sides:

-1/5 +1/30 = (1/v).

Compute:

-6/30 +1/30 = (-5)/30 = (1/v).

So, 1/v = -5/30 → v = -6 cm.

So, the image is at v= -6 cm relative to mirror B's position.

So, mirror B is at x=20 cm. So, the image is at x=20 + (-6) =14 cm.

So, the image is 14 cm from mirror B.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the image is at x=14 cm, which is 6 cm behind mirror B.

So, the image is formed 6 cm in front of mirror B, but in the same direction.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the image is 6 cm behind mirror B, which is at x=20 cm. So, image is at x=14 cm.

So, the final image is 14 cm from mirror B and 6 cm in front of mirror B (since mirror B is at x=20 cm, image is at x=14 cm, which is 6 cm behind mirror B).

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the image is formed 6 cm behind mirror B, which is at x=20 cm, so image is at x=14 cm.

So, the final image is 6 cm in front of mirror B, which is at x=20 cm, so image is at x=14 cm.

Wait, but the image is 6 cm behind mirror B, which is at x=20 cm. So, image is at x=20 -6 =14 cm.

So, the final image is at x=14 cm. So, the image is 14 cm away from mirror B, which is at x=20 cm.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the image is at x=14 cm. So, the object is at x=10 cm, mirror A is at 0, mirror B is at 20. The image from mirror A is at x=-10 cm, which is 30 cm away from mirror B. Mirror B's image is formed at x=14 cm, so 6 cm behind mirror B.

Wait, but this is getting really confusing. Let me try to think again.

Alternative approach: Treat the image from mirror A as the object for mirror B.

Mirror A: convex, f=5 cm.

Object is at u=10 cm.

Mirror B: concave, f=-5 cm.

Object is at u= -30 cm.

So, using mirror equation for mirror B:

1/f =1/u +1/v.

1/(-5)=1/(-30) +1/v.

So,

-1/5 = -1/30 +1/v.

Add 1/30 to both sides:

-6/30 +1/30 = 1/v.

-5/30 =1/v.

So,

v= -6 cm.

So, the image is at v= -6 cm relative to mirror B's position.

Mirror B is at x=20 cm, so the image is at x=20 + (-6) =14 cm.

So, the image is 14 cm from mirror B, which is 6 cm behind mirror B.

So, the final image is 6 cm behind mirror B, which is at x=20 cm, so image is at x=14 cm.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Let me try to go back to the initial problem and see if I can find another approach.

The problem states: The object is placed 10 cm away from mirror A. So, perhaps I should reorient the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the object as being placed 10 cm away from mirror A, and mirror B is 20 cm away from mirror A. So, the object is at x=10 cm, mirror A at x=0, mirror B at x=20 cm.

Mirror A is convex, so it produces an image at x=-10 cm.

Mirror B is concave, and the image from mirror A is 10 cm behind mirror A, which is 30 cm behind mirror B.

The image from mirror B is formed at x=14 cm, which is 6 cm behind mirror B.

So, the final image is 6 cm behind mirror B, which is at x=20 cm, so image is at x=14 cm.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the image is at x=14 cm, which is 6 cm behind mirror B.

So, the final image is 6 cm behind mirror B, which is at x=20 cm, so image is at x=14 cm.

So, the image is 14 cm from mirror B, which is 6 cm behind it.

Wait, but I'm getting mixed up. Let me think in terms of distances.

Mirror A at x=0, object at x=10 cm.

Mirror A produces image at x=-10 cm.

This image is 30 cm behind mirror B (mirror B at x=20 cm).

Now, mirror B is concave, so it produces an image.

The object for mirror B is 30 cm behind mirror B. So, it's 30 cm in front of mirror B (because mirror B is at x=20 cm, and the image for mirror B is 30 cm behind mirror B → x=20 -30= -10 cm.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the object for mirror B is 30 cm away from mirror B.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the object as being at x=10 cm, and mirror A is at x=0.

So, mirror A is convex, f=5 cm.

Object is at u=10 cm.

Mirror A produces image at v=10 cm (distance to the left of mirror A).

So, image is 10 cm behind mirror A, which is 30 cm behind mirror B (mirror B is at x=20 cm).

Now, mirror B is concave, f=-5 cm.

The object for mirror B is 30 cm in front of mirror B (because the image from mirror A is 30 cm behind mirror B, so in front of mirror B it's 30 cm away).

Wait, but I think I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, mirror B is at x=20 cm. The image from mirror A is at x=-10 cm, which is 30 cm behind mirror B.

So, the object for mirror B is at x=20 -30 =-10 cm. So, the object is at x=-10 cm relative to mirror B's position.

Thus, the object is 30 cm in front of mirror B (since mirror B is at x=20 cm, and the object is at x=-10 cm, which is 30 cm in front of mirror B).

Wait, but this can't be correct because the image from mirror B is formed 30 cm behind mirror B, but in front of mirror B, the object is 30 cm away, so the image is formed 30 cm behind mirror B.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the image distance.

Wait, perhaps I should get back to the initial calculation.

Mirror A: convex, f=5 cm.

Object at u=10 cm.

Mirror A produces image at v=10 cm (distance to the left of mirror A).

So, the image is at x=10 -10=0? No, no.

Wait, no, the image is at x=0 -10= -10 cm.

So, image is at x=-10 cm relative to mirror A's position.

Mirror B is at x=20 cm.

So, the image is at x=20 -10=10 cm relative to mirror B's position.

Wait, no, mirror B is at x=20 cm. So, the image is at x=10 cm relative to mirror B's position.

Wait, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the image as being at x=10 cm relative to mirror B's position.

So, the image is at x=10 cm relative to mirror B's position, which is at x=20 cm.

So, the image is at x=20 +10=30 cm.

Wait, that can't be right.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to think of the image formed by mirror B as being 6 cm behind mirror B.

Wait, earlier calculation gave image at x=14 cm.

So, perhaps the image is 6 cm behind mirror B, which is at x=20 cm, so image is at x=14 cm.

So, the final image is 6 cm behind mirror B.

Wait, but the question is, where is the final image formed?

So, it's 6 cm behind mirror B, which is at x=20 cm, so image is at x=14 cm.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to write down the conclusion.

After the calculations, the final image is formed 6 cm behind mirror B, which is at x=20 cm, so the image is at x=14 cm.
</think>

The final image is formed 6 cm behind mirror B, which is located at a distance of 20 cm from mirror A. Therefore, the image is located at a distance of 14 cm from mirror B.

ANSWER: 14 cm
