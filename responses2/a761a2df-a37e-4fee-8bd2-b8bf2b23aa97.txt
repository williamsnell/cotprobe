Okay, so I've got this question here about the height of a water column and how it relates to a mercury column. Hmm, I remember hearing something about this in chemistry. Let me think. Oh right! I think it's about the barometer or something like that. 

Wait, the question says the height of a water column is 600 mm. I need to find the height of the mercury column. I think the key here is the densities of the substances. Mercury is denser than water, so the column should be shorter, right? 

I remember a formula or a constant that relates the two. Oh yeah, it's something like the height of the mercury column is less than the water column because mercury is denser. The formula I think is h_mercury = h_water / (density of water / density of mercury). Or maybe it's h_mercury = h_water * (density of mercury / density of water). 

What's the approximate density of water and mercury? Water's density is around 1000 kg/m³, and mercury is about 13600 kg/m³. So the ratio would be 13600 / 1000 = 13.6. So the height of mercury would be 600 mm times (1/13.6). Let me calculate that. 600 / 13.6 equals... Hmm, 600 ÷ 13.6 is approximately 44.1 mm. Oh wait, that's about 44.1 mm. 

Looking at the options, option D is 44.1 mm Hg. That must be the right answer. So the mercury column is shorter than the water column because mercury is denser, so it rises lower.

To determine the height of the mercury column when the water column is 600 mm, we use the relationship between the densities of water and mercury. Mercury is denser, so the mercury column will be shorter. The formula is:

\[
h_{\text{mercury}} = h_{\text{water}} \times \left(\frac{\rho_{\text{water}}}{\rho_{\text{mercury}}}\right)
\]

Given:
- \( h_{\text{water}} = 600 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( \rho_{\text{water}} = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)
- \( \rho_{\text{mercury}} = 13600 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)

The ratio of densities is:
\[
\frac{\rho_{\text{water}}}{\rho_{\text{mercury}}} = \frac{1000}{13600} \approx 0.0735
\]

Thus:
\[
h_{\text{mercury}} = 600 \times 0.0735 \approx 44.1 \, \text{mm}
\]

The correct answer is **44.1 mm Hg**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer:
D: 44.1 mm Hg
