Okay, so I need to figure out which treatment Justin underwent based on the scenario given. Let's break it down.

Justin was afraid to fly. His therapist taught him relaxation exercises. He practiced these while looking at pictures of airplanes, then seeing them take off at an airport, then an empty plane that wouldn't take off, and finally a short flight. 

Hmm, the key here is the relaxation exercises and the sequence of pictures. Relaxation techniques are often part of behavior therapy. Behavior therapy focuses on helping individuals develop behavior change through techniques like positive and negative reinforcement, behavioral modification, and person-centered therapy. It also often involves relaxation techniques to calm the mind.

Wait, but I should think about the options. The options are psychoanalysis, behavior therapy, etc. So, if he was practicing relaxation exercises, that's a behavior therapy technique. 

Wait, some of the options are more specific like behavior therapy. Let me think: behavior therapy does involve relaxation and mindfulness. So, perhaps option B is correct.

Looking at the options again:

A: psychoanalysis - that's more about unconscious thinking and interpretations, like Carl Jung's theories or Sigmund Freud's. Not directly related to relaxation.

B: behavior therapy - yes, that's about helping people change their behaviors through various techniques.

C: cognitive therapy - deals with thoughts and emotions, but the focus here seems more on physical actions and relaxation.

D: humanistic therapy - focuses on individual well-being, not necessarily on relaxation techniques.

E: existential therapy - deals with the state of being, not about physical actions.

F: rational emotive therapy (REBT) - about changing negative thought patterns, not relaxation.

G: mindfulness-based cognitive therapy - yes, that's a specific approach within behavior therapy, focusing on both awareness and judgment.

H: group therapy - involves group activities, not the specific relaxation exercises mentioned.

I: gestalt therapy - about patterns and groupings, not relevant here.

J: reality therapy - deals with reality versus illusion, not about physical actions.

So Justin's approach was to practice relaxation while seeing different stages of flying. Relaxation is a behavior therapy technique. Therefore, the treatment he underwent was behavior therapy, which is option B.

The correct answer is B: behavior therapy. Justin practiced relaxation exercises in a sequence of increasingly feared scenarios, which aligns with the techniques used in behavior therapy to help individuals manage their fears and anxiety by using various methods, including relaxation. 

Answer: B
