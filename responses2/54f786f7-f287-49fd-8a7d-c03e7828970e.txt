Okay, so I have this question about perfectly competitive industries and some statements about a firm's revenues. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question is asking which statement is true for a firm in a perfectly competitive industry. The options are A to J, each making a different claim. I need to remember the characteristics of perfect competition and how they affect a firm's costs and revenues.

First, I remember that in perfect competition, there are many firms, and each firm produces at a very low cost. The industry is characterized by homogeneous products, free entry and exit, and perfect information. 

Now, the key points for a perfectly competitive firm are:

1. The firm is a price taker. That means the firm has no control over the market price. The price is determined by the market, not by the firm. So the firm's revenue per unit is fixed at the market price.

2. The firm's marginal revenue (MR) equals the market price. Because when a firm is perfectly competitive, MR is just the price. So, MR = Price.

3. The firm's average revenue (AR) is also equal to the market price. Because AR is total revenue divided by the quantity sold. So, AR = AR = Price.

So which of the options matches this? Let's look at the options.

Option A: Average revenue equals marginal revenue. Yes, this is true because both are equal to the market price.

Option B: Marginal revenue is always increasing. No, that's not right. Marginal revenue in perfect competition is constant because the price doesn't change. So B is false.

Option C: Average revenue is always negative. No, that's impossible. Average revenue can't be negative because revenue per unit can't be negative if the price is positive.

Option D: Marginal revenue equals total revenue. No, that's not right. Marginal revenue is the additional revenue from selling one more unit, which is less than total revenue because total revenue includes all previous units. So D is wrong.

Option E: Average revenue is initially negative and then becomes positive. Not possible, because the price is positive in perfect competition. So E is false.

Option F: Marginal revenue is decreasing. Well, in perfect competition, MR is constant (equal to price). So F is incorrect.

Option G: Total revenue always decreases. No, that's not the case. In the beginning, as the firm increases production, total revenue increases because each additional unit contributes to revenue. So G is false.

Option H: Total revenue increases and then decreases. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Actually, in a perfectly competitive market, the firm can increase production up to the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Beyond that, increasing further would lead to losses. But the total revenue curve would still rise as long as MR > MC, which is the case where the firm can increase production. So H is not correct.

Option I: Total revenue equals average revenue. Wait, average revenue is AR, which is price. Total revenue is price multiplied by quantity. So AR = price, but TR = AR * Q. Hence, TR is not equal to AR unless Q is 1. So I is false.

Option J: Marginal revenue is initially positive and then becomes negative. No, that's not right. In perfect competition, marginal revenue is always positive because the price is a positive number. So J is false.

So, the correct statements are A and possibly others. Wait, let me double-check.

Which options have statements that are true?

Looking again:

Only option A is true. Because average revenue equals marginal revenue, which is the price, in perfect competition.

Wait, but let me think about each option again.

Option E: Average revenue is initially negative and then positive. No, because the price is positive in perfect competition.

Wait, but perhaps in the case of an industry with negative prices, but that's not the case here. So E is incorrect.

So the only correct statement is option A. Let me check the other options.

Wait, option E: Average revenue is initially negative and then becomes positive. No, that's impossible because the price is positive.

Wait, another thought: In the long run, the firm can adjust to changes in cost. But in the short run, at least, the price is fixed.

So, putting it all together, the only correct statement is A: Average revenue equals marginal revenue.

The correct answer is **A: Average revenue equals marginal revenue**. 

In a perfectly competitive industry, a firm acts as a price taker, meaning it has no control over the market price. The firm's marginal revenue (MR) is equal to the market price, and so is its average revenue (AR). This is because both MR and AR are determined by dividing total revenue by the quantity sold, and in a competitive market, each additional unit is sold at the same price. 

Other options are incorrect for the following reasons:
- **B**: Marginal revenue is constant, not always increasing.
- **C**: Average revenue cannot be negative if the price is positive.
- **D**: Marginal revenue is not equal to total revenue (TR); it is a part of TR.
- **E**: Average revenue cannot be initially negative.
- **F**: Marginal revenue is constant, not decreasing.
- **G**: Total revenue increases as long as marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost.
- **H**: Total revenue continues to increase up to the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
- **I**: Total revenue is not equal to average revenue unless the quantity produced is 1.
- **J**: Marginal revenue remains positive in a perfectly competitive market.
