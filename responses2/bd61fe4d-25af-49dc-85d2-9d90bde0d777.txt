Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Now, we have organized a society, and we call it "Share Our Wealth Society," a society with the motto "Every Man a King."…
We propose to limit the wealth of big men in the country. There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today.
We do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality … but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.…
We will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Senator Huey P. Long's "Share Our Wealth Society." I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, the question asks which option correctly describes what happened because of the society. The options are A through J, each presenting a different reason.

Let me read the passage again. It says that Senator Long proposed a society where the maximum wealth any individual could have is $50,000,000. The idea is to limit the "poor man's wealth" so that each family can hold around $5,000, enough for basic needs. The society is called "Share Our Wealth Society" and it's called "Every Man a King."

So, looking at the options, each one is a statement about why this society was popular or what it was meant to achieve.

Option A: The society proposed a revolutionary idea of limiting individual fortunes to $50,000,000. That sounds correct because the passage clearly states that's the proposed maximum.

Option B: There was a growing dissatisfaction with the capitalist system. Well, the passage doesn't mention dissatisfaction; it's more about how the society aims to limit wealth and provide a basic standard. So B might not be correct.

Option C: People were attracted by the idea of every man being a king. Hmm, the passage mentions the motto "Every Man a King." That's a key point, but the passage doesn't say that this was the reason. It's more about the society's purpose, not the motivation behind it.

Option D: The society promised to limit the wealth of the rich and provide a minimum standard of living for everyone. That aligns with what the passage says. The society is aimed at reducing the wealth of the wealthy and ensuring everyone has a basic standard.

Option E: The rise of technology created a demand for wealth distribution. The passage doesn't mention technology; it's more about wealth limits and basic standards.

Option F: The New Deal had not ended the Great Depression. The passage doesn't discuss the economic context of the time, so I don't think this is relevant.

Option G: The Second World War encouraged an egalitarian ethos. The passage doesn't suggest that the society was influenced by WWII, so probably not.

Option H: There was a surge in immigrant population looking for equal wealth opportunities. The passage doesn't mention immigration or any connection to that topic.

Option I: A flourishing economy and a baby boom had led people to desire greater incomes. The passage doesn't talk about a flourishing economy or the baby boom; it's more about wealth limits.

Option J: Socialistic ideas were becoming popular in the United States. The passage doesn't mention socialism as a trend; it's more about a specific policy.

So, the correct answer should be A and D.

Wait, but the question is asking which is the correct reason. The options are presented as possible explanations for why this society was introduced. The passage specifically states that the society's aim was to limit the wealth of big men to allow a minimum standard. So both A and D seem correct. But the question is asking which is the reason, and the passage says both. But the options are separate.

Wait, no, the options are not dependent on each other, but the question is which statement correctly describes why the society was formed. The passage says that the society aims to limit the wealth of the rich to allow a minimum standard. So that's option D. Option A says the society proposed a revolutionary idea, which is correct in the context that it's a proposed policy rather than a revolutionary concept.

Wait, but the passage says the society is called "Share Our Wealth Society" and the idea is to limit the maximum wealth to $50 million. The passage doesn't mention a revolutionary idea but rather a policy of limiting wealth. So, is the reason A correct?

Wait, the question is asking which option is correct based on the passage. The passage says the society proposed a maximum limit, so option A is correct as the society's proposed idea. Option D is also correct because it's the society's promise to limit the wealth of the wealthy and provide a minimum standard.

Wait, but the options are separate, so each is a possible answer. The question is which statement correctly explains why the society was formed. The passage says the society proposed a maximum wealth limit, so that's option A. It also says the society aimed to reduce the wealth of the wealthy and provide a minimum standard, which is option D.

But the question is asking which option is the correct reason. The passage has both statements, but the options are presented as independent. Since the passage says both, I think the correct answer is both A and D. But looking at the options, each is a separate choice.

Wait, looking back, the passage says:

"We propose to limit the wealth of big men in the country. There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today."

So the society's aim is to limit the wealth of big men (the wealthy), so that a family can hold around $5k. So the passage directly states that the society's aim was to limit the wealth of the rich. So that's option D.

Option A says the society proposed a revolutionary idea. The passage doesn't say that; it's more of a policy. So the correct answer is D. Because the passage says the society aimed to limit the wealth of the rich to provide a minimum standard.

The "Share Our Wealth Society" proposed a policy aimed at limiting the wealth of the wealthy to ensure a minimum standard of living for everyone. The passage explicitly states that the society aimed to reduce the wealth of the "big men" to allow a family to hold around $5,000. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: The society promised to limit the wealth of the rich and provide a minimum standard of living for everyone.**

ANSWER: D
