Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these equilibrium problems. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking for the hydronium ion concentration in a 0.1M acetic acid solution. Oh wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, right? So it doesn't completely dissociate, but it does dissociate a little bit.

The given Ka value is 1.75 x 10^-5. I remember that Ka is the acid dissociation constant, which tells us how strong the acid is. A larger Ka means a stronger acid. Acetic acid is definitely a weak acid, so its Ka isn't extremely large. I guess that's why it's around 1e-5.

The question is about hydronium ion concentration. Hydronium ion is H3O+, and in aqueous solutions, that's the same as H+ concentration. So I'm looking for [H+], which is the same as [H3O+]. 

Acetic acid dissociates into H+ and CH3COO^- ions. The reaction is CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

I think I can use the Ka expression for this. The formula is Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA], where HA is acetic acid and A- is acetate ion.

Since acetic acid is a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely, so I can't assume that [H+] is approximately equal to 0.1M. Instead, I need to set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium).

Initial concentrations:
[HA] = 0.1 M
[H+] = 0
[CH3COO^-] = 0

Change:
Let’s let x be the change in [H+]. So:
[H+] = x
[CH3COO^-] = x
[HA] remains 0.1 - x

But wait, because it's a weak acid, x won't be too large. So the approximation that x is much smaller than 0.1 might be valid here. But let me check later if that's the case.

So the expression becomes:
Ka = (x)(x) / (0.1 - x) = x² / (0.1 - x)

But because x is small, 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1, so the equation simplifies to x² ≈ 0.1 * 1.75e-5.

Wait, let me compute that. So x² = 0.1 * 1.75e-5 = 1.75e-6.

Taking square root both sides, x = sqrt(1.75e-6) ≈ sqrt(1.75)*1e-3. Let me calculate that. The square root of 1.75 is about 1.322, so x ≈ 1.322e-3, which is 0.001322 M. Let me round that to 0.0013 M, which is option C. Wait, but I'm not sure yet. I should double-check because sometimes the approximation may not hold.

Wait, but I assumed that x is much smaller than 0.1. Let me see if that's true. Here, x is 0.0013, which is 1.3% of 0.1, so maybe the approximation is okay. But maybe it's not that small, so I should check without the approximation.

Without the approximation, the equation is x² = 0.1 * 1.75e-5 - x². So bringing all terms to one side: x² + x² - 0.1*1.75e-5 = 0 → 2x² - 0.175e-5 = 0 → 2x² = 0.175e-5 → x² = (0.175e-5)/2 = 8.75e-7 → x = sqrt(8.75e-7) ≈ 9.35e-4, which is 0.000935 M. That's about 0.00094 M. So that's approximately 0.0009 M. Wait, but wait, the initial x when we took the approximation was 0.0013, which is higher than 0.0009. So the initial approximation overestimates x because we assumed x is small when it's actually larger.

Hmm, so which value is correct? Or maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me recalculate. The equation is Ka = x²/(0.1 - x). Let me write it as x² = 0.1 * 1.75e-5 - x² → x² + x² = 0.175e-5 → 2x² = 1.75e-6 → x² = 8.75e-7 → x ≈ 9.35e-4, which is 0.000935 M. Wait, but that's 0.000935, which is approximately 0.00094 M. That's 0.00094 M, which is about 0.0009 M. But wait, the options don't have 0.0009. The options are A to J, and the closest are C (0.0013) and G (0.0005) and I (0.002). So wait, 0.0009 is closer to 0.001, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should trust the approximation. Because if x is 0.0013, which is 1.3e-3, as I thought. But that's about 1.3% of 0.1, which is a fairly small number, so the approximation might still be acceptable.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting results. Let me try without the approximation.

The equation is x²/(0.1 - x) = 1.75e-5.

Multiply both sides by (0.1 - x):

x² = (0.1 - x) * 1.75e-5.

Expand the right-hand side:

x² = 0.1 * 1.75e-5 - x * 1.75e-5 → x² = 1.75e-6 - 1.75e-5 x.

Bring all terms to left side:

x² + 1.75e-5 x - 1.75e-6 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in x. Let me write it as:

x² + (1.75e-5) x - 1.75e-6 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² + 4ac)]/(2a)

Where a = 1, b = 1.75e-5, c = -1.75e-6.

Compute discriminant D = b² + 4ac.

b² = (1.75e-5)^2 = 3.0625e-10.

4ac = 4 * 1 * (-1.75e-6) = -7e-6.

Wait, no: 4ac = 4 * 1 * (-1.75e-6) = -7e-6.

Wait, no: 4ac = 4 * a * c. So a is 1, c is -1.75e-6. So 4ac = 4*1*(-1.75e-6) = -7e-6.

Then, D = 3.0625e-10 -7e-6 = ?

Wait, that can't be. Wait, D = (1.75e-5)^2 + 4*(1)*(-1.75e-6)

Compute each term:

(1.75e-5)^2 = (1.75)^2 * (1e-5)^2 = 3.0625 * 1e-10 = 3.0625e-10.

4ac = 4 * 1.0 * (-1.75e-6) = -7e-6.

So, D = 3.0625e-10 -7e-6 = approximately -7e-6 + 3e-10.

But wait, 3e-10 is much smaller than 7e-6, so D ≈ -7e-6.

So the square root of D is sqrt(-7e-6), which is imaginary. Wait, that can't be right. That suggests no real solution, which can't be correct because the acid dissociates.

Wait, no. I must have made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me double-check the setup.

The dissociation is CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-

So the initial concentrations are [CH3COOH]=0.1 M, [H+]=0, [A-]=0.

Change is +x, so [CH3COOH]=0.1 - x, [H+] = x, [A-] =x.

So the expression is Ka = (x)(x)/(0.1 - x) = x²/(0.1 -x) = 1.75e-5.

So the equation is correct. When I set up the quadratic, I should have x² = (0.1 -x)(1.75e-5).

Expanding that gives x² = 0.1*1.75e-5 - x * 1.75e-5 → x² + 1.75e-5 x - 0.1 * 1.75e-5 = 0.

Wait wait, that's x² + (1.75e-5) x - (0.1 * 1.75e-5) = 0.

Wait, 0.1 * 1.75e-5 is 1.75e-6. So the equation is x² + 1.75e-5 x - 1.75e-6 = 0.

Ah, that's correct. So in the quadratic formula, a=1, b=1.75e-5, c=-1.75e-6.

Compute discriminant D = b² -4ac.

Wait, because the equation is x² + (1.75e-5) x - 1.75e-6 =0 → a=1, b=1.75e-5, c= -1.75e-6.

So D = (1.75e-5)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.75e-6).

Calculate each part:

(1.75e-5)^2 = (1.75)^2 * 1e-10 = 3.0625e-10.

-4ac = -4*(1)*(-1.75e-6) = +7e-6.

So D=3.0625e-10 +7e-6 = 7.00030625e-6.

Wait, because 7e-6 is much larger than 3e-10, so D is approximately 7e-6.

So sqrt(D) is sqrt(7e-6) = sqrt(7) * 1e-3 → approx 2.6458e-3.

So x = [-b ± sqrt(D)]/(2a) → [-1.75e-5 ± 2.6458e-3]/(2).

We take the positive root because x can't be negative.

So x = [ -1.75e-5 + 2.6458e-3 ] / 2.

Wait, that's:

-1.75e-5 is 0.0000175, 2.6458e-3 is 0.0026458.

So subtracting 0.0000175 from 0.0026458 gives 0.0026283.

Divide by 2: 0.00131415 M.

So x ≈ 0.001314 M → about 0.001314 M, which is 0.001314 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 0.0013 M.

Wait, but the approximation before gave me 0.0013 M, and the exact calculation gives approximately 0.001314, which is about 0.00131 M. So perhaps the answer is option C: 0.0013 M.

Wait, but none of the options have 0.00131. Let me look again. The options are:

A: 0.00013 → 1.3e-3

B: 0.001 → 1e-3

C:0.0013 →1.3e-3

H: 0.00075 →7.5e-4

G: 0.0005 →5e-4

I: 0.002 →2e-3

J: 0.0015 →1.5e-3

So the exact value I got was approximately 0.001314, which is 1.314e-3 M, or 1.314 mM. So the closest option is option C: 0.0013 M. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider if this is correct.

Wait, let me calculate more accurately.

x ≈ ( -1.75e-5 + 2.6458e-3 ) / 2.

Compute numerator: 2.6458e-3 - 1.75e-5 = 2.6458e-3 - 0.0000175 =2.64405e-3.

Divide by 2: 2.64405e-3 / 2 = 1.322025e-3 → 0.001322 M.

So 0.001322 M is approximately 0.00132 M. Looking at the options, the closest is C: 0.0013 M. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the answer is 0.0013 M.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, the approximation is made that x is much less than 0.1, but in this case, x is 0.0013, which is 1.3% of 0.1, which is 1.3%, so it's not that small. So the approximation is perhaps not that good, but still, the exact value is about 0.0013, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether the assumption holds. If the Ka is small, but in this case, it's 1e-5. Wait, 1e-5 is a moderately weak acid. So sometimes, the assumption is that x² ≈ 0.1*Ka, but when x is small compared to 0.1, the approximation works.

Wait, in our case, 0.1 * Ka = 0.1 * 1.75e-5 = 1.75e-6. So x²=1.75e-6 → x=1.322e-3, which is exactly what we found.

So the exact value is about 1.32e-3, which is 0.00132. The closest option is C: 0.0013 M. But wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the exact method, but perhaps if the solution is in a buffer, but no, acetic acid is a weak acid. So the correct approach is to set up the quadratic equation and find the exact value.

So the correct answer is approximately 0.0013 M, which is option C.

To determine the hydronium ion concentration, [H₃O⁺], in a 0.1 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH) solution, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

---

### Reaction and Constants:
\[
\text{CH₃COOH ↔ H⁺ + CH₃COO⁻}
\]
The acid dissociation constant is given as \( K_a = 1.75 \times 10^{-5} \).

---

### Initial Setup:
- Initial concentrations: \([CH₃COOH] = 0.1 \, \text{M}, [H⁺] = 0, [\text{CH₃COO}⁻] = 0\).
- Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( [H⁺] \) at equilibrium.

---

### Equilibrium Expression:
The equilibrium concentrations are:
\[
[CH₃COOH] = 0.1 - x, \quad [H⁺] = x, \quad [\text{CH₃COO}⁻] = x
\]
The equilibrium expression is:
\[
K_a = \frac{[H⁺][\text{CH₃COO}⁻]}{[CH₃COOH]} = \frac{x^2}{0.1 - x}
\]

---

### Solving for \( x \):
This is a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 + (1.75 \times 10^{-5})x - 1.75 \times 10^{-6} = 0
\]
Using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1.75 \times 10^{-5} \), and \( c = -1.75 \times 10^{-6} \). The discriminant \( D \) is:
\[
D = b^2 - 4ac = (1.75 \times 10^{-5})^2 - 4(1)(-1.75 \times 10^{-6})
\]
\[
D = 3.0625 \times 10^{-10} + 7.0 \times 10^{-6} \approx 7.0 \times 10^{-6}
\]
\[
\sqrt{D} \approx 2.6458 \times 10^{-3}
\]
Substituting into the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-1.75 \times 10^{-5} \pm 2.6458 \times 10^{-3}}{2}
\]
Taking the positive root (since \( x \) cannot be negative):
\[
x = \frac{-1.75 \times 10^{-5} + 2.6458 \times 10^{-3}}{2}
\]
\[
x \approx \frac{2.6458 \times 10^{-3} - 1.75 \times 10^{-5}}{2} \approx \frac{2.6283 \times 10^{-3}}{2} \approx 1.314 \times 10^{-3}
\]

Thus, the hydronium ion concentration is approximately \( 0.0013 \, \text{M} \).
