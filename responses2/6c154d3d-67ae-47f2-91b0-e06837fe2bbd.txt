Okay, so I've got this question about the Old Babylonian version of Gilgamesh and when it was modified into the standard version. Hmm, I remember that Gilgamesh is one of the famous ziggurats from the Old Babylonian period, around 1800-1600 BCE. The Old Babylonians were known for their ingenuity in storytelling and their use of art to convey meaning.

I think the Old Babylonian text for Gilgamesh might have had a more elaborate or different version compared to what's commonly known. Like, in the standard version, it's depicted as a tall, humanoid figure who is portrayed as wise, kind, and wise. So, maybe the Old version was a bit different. Was it more symbolic, maybe a creature or something else?

Wait, I remember that the standard version is a typical representation of Gilgamesh as a hero. So perhaps the Old version had a different character. Maybe it was a more human-like figure, not a creature. Or perhaps it was a different pose or expression.

I think the Old version might have had a more humanoid figure, while the standard one is the classic, human version. So, the modification happened when they changed it. When did that happen? I believe it was around the middle of the first millennium BCE. That would be around 1400-1300 BCE. That's option B: Towards the middle of the first millennium BCE.

Alternatively, maybe it was at the start of the first millennium. Let me think. The Old Babylonian period was from around 1800 to 1600 BCE. The standard version became more common long before the Old version was widely used. It was probably around 1400 BCE when the Old version was changed into the standard. So, the correct answer would be towards the middle of the first millennium BCE, which is option B.

The correct answer is **B: Towards the middle of the first millennium BCE**. The Old Babylonian version of Gilgamesh was modified into the standard version around 1400-1300 BCE, which is during the middle of the first millennium BCE period. 

Answer: B
