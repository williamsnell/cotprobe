Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about convertible debenture. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says: A 500 par-value convertible debenture is selling at $520. The conversion ratio is 20. I need to find the conversion price. The options are A to J, with various amounts.

First, I should recall what a convertible debenture is. From what I remember, a convertible debenture is a type of bond that can be converted into a certain number of shares of common stock. The value of the bond in terms of the stock depends on the conversion ratio and the conversion price.

The key here is to understand the relationship between the conversion ratio, par value, and the conversion price. The conversion price is the price at which the bond can be exchanged for shares. 

The formula I think I need is: Conversion Price = (Par Value / Conversion Ratio) / (Current Price per Share). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the conversion price is the par value divided by the conversion ratio. Or perhaps the conversion price is the par value divided by the number of shares per bond.

Wait, let's clarify. A convertible debenture usually has a par value, which is the face value, and the conversion ratio tells how many shares you get for each bond. So if the conversion ratio is 20, each debenture can be converted into 20 shares.

The current price of the bond is $520. So the bond is selling at a premium because it's priced at $520 when the par is $500. A premium means the market price is higher than the par value.

But wait, the question is asking for the conversion price. Let me think about the formula again. The conversion price should be the par value divided by the conversion ratio. So, par is $500, ratio is 20. So, $500 / 20 = $25 per share. So the conversion price would be $25.

Looking at the options, E is $25.00. That seems right. But let me double-check because sometimes I get confused with formulas.

Alternatively, another way: The bond's current market value is $520. If the conversion ratio is 20, for each bond you can get 20 shares. But wait, the par value per bond is $500. So each share would have a value of $500 / 20 = $25. So the conversion price is $25. This matches option E.

So the correct answer should be E: $25.00.

The correct calculation involves determining the conversion price using the par value and the conversion ratio. The conversion price is the par value divided by the conversion ratio, which is $500 / 20 = $25.00. Thus, the correct answer is:

**E: $25.00**

Answer: E
