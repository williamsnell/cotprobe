Okay, I need to find the inflection point of the function f(x) = (10 ln(x)) / x². Hmm, inflection points are where the concavity of the function changes, which means I need to find where the second derivative changes sign. 

First, let me recall how to find inflection points. The steps are:

1. Find the first derivative, f'(x).
2. Find the second derivative, f''(x).
3. Set f''(x) equal to zero and solve for x. These are potential inflection points.
4. Check if the concavity changes around these x-values.

So, let's start by finding the first derivative. The function f(x) is 10 ln(x) over x squared. That's f(x) = (10 ln x) / x². To differentiate this, I can use the quotient rule. The quotient rule says that if you have a function u(x)/v(x), then the derivative is (u’v - uv’) / v².

Let me set u = 10 ln x. Then u’ is 10*(1/x) because the derivative of ln x is 1/x. 

And v = x², so v’ is 2x.

So applying the quotient rule:

f’(x) = [ (10/x) * x² - (10 ln x) * 2x ] / (x²)²

Simplify the numerator:

First term: (10/x) * x² = 10x.

Second term: (10 ln x) * 2x = 20x ln x.

So numerator is 10x - 20x ln x.

Denominator is x^4 (since (x²)^2 is x^4).

So f’(x) = (10x - 20x ln x) / x^4.

I can factor 10x from the numerator:

10x (1 - 2 ln x) / x^4.

Simplify by dividing 10x by x^4: that gives 10/(x³).

So f’(x) = 10(1 - 2 ln x) / x³.

Now, let's find the second derivative f''(x). For this, I'll differentiate f’(x). Let me write f’(x) as 10(1 - 2 ln x) x^(-3).

I can use the product rule here. The product rule states that the derivative of u*v is u’v + uv’.

Let u = 10(1 - 2 ln x). Then u’ is 10*(-2/x) = -20/x.

And v = x^(-3). v’ is -3x^(-4).

So applying the product rule:

f''(x) = u’v + uv’ = (-20/x) * x^(-3) + 10(1 - 2 ln x) * (-3x^(-4)).

Simplify each term.

First term: (-20/x) * (1/x³) = -20 / x⁴.

Second term: 10(1 - 2 ln x) * (-3)/x⁴ = -30(1 - 2 ln x)/x⁴.

So f''(x) = (-20 - 30(1 - 2 ln x)) / x⁴.

Let me combine the terms in the numerator:

-20 -30(1 - 2 ln x) = -20 -30 +60 ln x = (-50) +60 ln x.

So f''(x) = (60 ln x -50) / x⁴.

Alternatively, factor out 10: 10(6 ln x -5) / x⁴.

Wait, that would be 10*(6 ln x -5)/x⁴.

But perhaps I should recheck the calculation for f''(x) to avoid mistakes.

Wait, let me recompute f''(x):

f’(x) = 10(1 - 2 ln x)/x³.

So f''(x) is derivative of that.

Use the product rule: derivative of (10)(1 - 2 ln x) * x^(-3).

So:

d/dx [10(1 - 2 ln x)] * x^(-3) + 10(1 - 2 ln x) * d/dx [x^(-3)].

The derivative of 10(1 - 2 ln x) is 10*(-2/x) = -20/x.

The derivative of x^(-3) is -3x^(-4).

So putting it together:

(-20/x) * x^(-3) + 10(1-2 ln x) * (-3 x^(-4)).

Simplify each term:

First term: (-20/x) * (1/x³) = -20 / x⁴.

Second term: 10(1-2 ln x)* (-3)/x⁴ = -30(1-2 ln x)/x⁴.

Combine terms:

-20/x⁴ -30(1-2 ln x)/x⁴.

Factor out 1/x⁴:

[ -20 -30(1-2 ln x) ] / x⁴.

Expand the numerator:

-20 -30 + 60 ln x = (-50) +60 ln x.

So numerator is 60 ln x -50.

So f''(x) = (60 ln x -50) / x⁴.

Alternatively, factor numerator as 10*(6 ln x -5) → 10(6 ln x -5)/x⁴.

Wait, perhaps I can write it as 10(6 ln x -5) / x⁴.

To find inflection points, set f''(x) = 0.

So 60 ln x -50 = 0.

Solving for x:

60 ln x =50 → ln x = 50/60 =5/6 ≈0.8333.

So x = e^(5/6).

Calculate e^(5/6): let's compute that. 5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

e^0.8333 is about e^0.8333. I know that e^0.7 is about 2.01375, e^0.8 is about 2.2255, e^0.8333 is about 2.299 (since 5/6 is 0.8333). Alternatively, if I remember e^0.8333, it's approximately 2.299.

Wait, but wait, I'm looking at the options. The options are A:2, B:1.587, C:0.693, D:1.203, E:3.014, F:2.718, G:4.000, H:3.142, I:1.000, J:2.301.

Wait, 2.299 is close to 2.301, which is option J.

But wait, let me compute e^(5/6) more accurately. 5/6 is approximately 0.833333.

e^0.833333 can be calculated using a calculator or a Taylor expansion, but perhaps I can remember that ln(2) is about 0.693, ln(3)≈1.0986, ln(4)=1.386, ln(5)=1.609, ln(1.2)=0.182, ln(2.718)=1 (since e≈2.718). Wait, perhaps log tables aren't helpful here.

Alternatively, let's compute e^0.833333.

We know that ln(2) is approximately 0.693, and ln(3) is about 1.0986. So 0.8333 is between ln(2) and ln(3).

We can use the fact that e^0.8 ≈2.2255, e^0.8333= e^(5/6).

Wait, but perhaps I can calculate e^0.833333333.

Let me compute e^0.833333333:

We can think of it as e^(0.8 + 0.0333333) = e^0.8 * e^0.0333333.

e^0.8 ≈2.2255, e^0.033333 is approximately 1 + 0.033333 + (0.033333)^2/2 ≈1.034447.

So 2.2255 * 1.034447 ≈2.2255*1.0344.

2.2255 * 1 = 2.2255,

2.2255 * 0.034447 ≈ approximately 0.0767.

So total ≈2.2255 +0.0767=2.3022.

Which is approximately 2.302, which is very close to option J:2.301.

So the inflection point is at x ≈ e^(5/6) ≈2.302, which is near option J.

Wait, but the options include J as 2.301, which is very close. So the correct inflection point is at x≈2.301, which is option J.

So the answer is J.

To find the inflection point of the function \( f(x) = \frac{10 \ln(x)}{x^2} \), we need to determine where the second derivative changes sign. 

1. **First Derivative**: Using the quotient rule, \( f'(x) = \frac{10(1 - 2 \ln x)}{x^3} \).

2. **Second Derivative**: Applying the product rule and simplifying, \( f''(x) = \frac{60 \ln x - 50}{x^4} \).

3. **Finding Inflection Points**: Set \( f''(x) = 0 \) to find where the concavity changes:
   \[
   60 \ln x - 50 = 0 \implies \ln x = \frac{5}{6} \implies x = e^{5/6} \approx 2.301.
   \]
   
4. **Conclusion**: The inflection point occurs at \( x \approx 2.301 \), which corresponds to option J.
