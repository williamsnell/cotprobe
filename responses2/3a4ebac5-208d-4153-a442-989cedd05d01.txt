Okay, so I have this question about digital circuits. Let me try to break it down. The question is asking which statements about circuits are true, and the options are A to J. Each statement is labeled I, II, III, and I have to evaluate all of them.

So, the statements are:

I. Combinational circuits may have feedback; sequential circuits do not.
II. Combinational circuits have a "memoryless" property; sequential circuits do not.
III. Both sequential and combinational circuits must be controlled by an external clock.

Hmm, I remember that combinational and sequential circuits are types of digital circuits. Let me think about each statement.

Statement I: Combinational can have feedback. Wait, I thought combinational circuits don't have memory. Oh wait, feedback would imply that the output depends on previous inputs or outputs, making them sequential. Because combinational circuits produce output based solely on the current inputs, not past ones. So if a combinational circuit has feedback, that would mean the output depends on previous outputs, which would make it a sequential circuit. So statement I is saying that combinational circuits can have feedback, which is correct. Because some combinational circuits can indeed have feedback loops for certain functions. So I is true.

Statement II: Combinational have memoryless. Yes, that's correct. Because combinational circuits' outputs depend only on the current inputs, not on any past inputs or outputs. So they don't have memory. Sequential circuits, on the other hand, do have memory because their outputs depend on previous inputs. So statement II is true.

Statement III: Both sequential and combinational must be controlled by an external clock. Hmm, wait. Sequential circuits do have a clock to control their timing. But combinational circuits don't because they don't involve any time dependency. So statement III says both must be controlled by an external clock. But wait, wait: combinational circuits are built from logic gates that don't have timing issues. So if a combinational circuit uses a clock, it's because it's part of a sequential circuit. Like adders, for example. But wait, no, combinational circuits don't need a clock. But statement III says both must have an external clock. That can't be right. Because combinational circuits don't involve timing at all. So statement III is false. Because not every combinational circuit needs an external clock; in fact, they don't need it at all. Sequential ones do, but combinational don't have clocks. So statement III is incorrect.

So let's summarize:

Statement I: True.

Statement II: True.

Statement III: False.

So the correct statements are I and II. Looking at the options, which includes:

A: II and III. (No, III is wrong.)

B: I and III only. (I is correct, III wrong.)

C: I and II only. (Yes, both correct.)

D: I only. (No, II is correct.)

E: None of the above. (No, because C is correct.)

F: II only. (No, I is correct.)

G: I, II, III. (No, III is wrong.)

H: All of the above. (No.)

J: II and III only. (No, III wrong.)

So the correct answer should be option C: I and II only.

The correct statements are I and II. 

**Answer:**
C: I and II only
