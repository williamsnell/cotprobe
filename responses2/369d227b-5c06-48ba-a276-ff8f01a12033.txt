Okay, so I've got this question here about JimDagney's sales and earnings. Let me try to figure out how to solve it. 

The question says JimDagney is a salesman for Beeswax Co. His weekly sales average $2,000, and his average weekly earnings are $120. They're asking for his selling cost percentage. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about what exactly they mean by "selling cost percentage." I think it's about calculating the percentage of his sales that goes towards the cost of goods sold (COGS), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me break it down.

First, I know that his earnings are a combination of salary and commission. His total earnings average $120 per week, and his sales are $2,000. So, his commission must be part of his earnings, and the rest is probably his salary. Let me try to figure out how much he earns from each part.

Wait, but the question is about the cost percentage. So maybe it's the percentage of his sales that goes into his costs. If I can find the COGS, then I can calculate what percentage that is of his total sales.

But wait, the problem doesn't provide the COGS directly. Oh, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The term "selling cost percentage" might refer to the proportion of his sales that is considered a cost. Alternatively, perhaps it's the portion of his earnings that comes from commissions. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the markup percentage. But I'm not sure. Let me try another approach. If I consider that his total earnings are $120, which includes both salary and commission. But the problem doesn't give me the commission amount. Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing the commission, I can't directly find the cost percentage.

Wait another thought: perhaps the question is about the percentage of his sales that he actually sells. No, that doesn't make sense because the average is $2,000. That seems off.

Wait, maybe the question is simply asking for the percentage of earnings that comes from commissions. But without knowing the commission amount, I can't calculate that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is a bit tricky and refers to the cost of sales, which is the amount spent on goods sold. But the problem doesn't provide the cost or the number of units sold. I'm stuck here.

Wait, re-reading the question: "Find his selling cost percentage." So maybe it's the percentage of his total sales that is considered cost. But without knowing the cost of goods sold, I can't find that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe it's the percentage of his sales that is considered a cost, which would be the commission, but the question doesn't state that. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the cost percentage as in, what percentage of his sales he actually sells. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a markup or something else. Hmm.

Wait another angle: the question might be trying to trick me. If his weekly earnings are $120, and his sales are $2,000, maybe the commission is the difference. Let me compute that. If sales are $2,000 and he makes $120 a week, that's a lot less than his sales. So maybe he's making commission, but that's a very small percentage of his sales.

Wait, let's calculate the commission. Let's say his earnings are a combination of salary and commission. So, if his total is $120, and perhaps his salary is a fixed amount, but the problem doesn't give that. Hmm, maybe the question is about the percentage of his earnings that comes from commissions, but without the commission amount, I can't find that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps "selling cost percentage" refers to the percentage of his sales that goes into his selling costs. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an error, and the question meant to ask for something else, like the markup percentage or profit percentage.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. If his sales are $2,000 and his total earnings are $120, maybe the question is about the percentage of his sales that he actually sold. But that would be 100%, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps it's the percentage of his salary.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the markup. If his earnings are $120 and his sales are $2,000, the markup would be (2000 - 120)/2000 = 1880/2000 = 94%. That's a high mark. But I'm not sure if that's what's being asked.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the profit margin. Profit would be sales minus COGS (cost of goods sold). But the problem doesn't provide COGS. Alternatively, if the question is about the percentage of sales that he actually sells, but that doesn't make sense because it's 100% of sales. Maybe the problem is trying to trick me, and the correct answer is simply the percentage of his salary relative to his sales.

Wait, let's calculate the percentage of his earnings that comes from commission. Suppose his commission is C, and his salary is S. So S + C = 120. But without knowing either S or C, I can't calculate this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, and the correct term is 'selling expense.' But the question says 'selling cost percentage,' which might imply that it's a percentage of sales, not expense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a markup percentage.

Wait, perhaps the percentage of his earnings that is commission. If his total earnings are $120, and his commission is, say, X, then X = 120 - S. But without knowing S, the salary, I can't find X.

Wait, maybe the question is a trick. The "selling cost percentage" refers to the percentage of his sales that is actually sold. But that would be 100%, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question meant to say that his cost is 10% of his sales. But that's not provided.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question is: JimDagney's weekly sales are $2,000, and his earnings are $120. Find his selling cost percentage.

Wait, perhaps the term 'selling cost' refers to his commission. If I assume that his commission is the only selling cost, then the percentage would be (Commission / Sales) * 100. But I don't have the commission amount.

Wait, maybe the question is a trick and simply asks for the percentage of his sales that he actually sells, which is 100%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about his average salary. But that's not specified in the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is trying to trick me, and the correct answer is that it's not possible to determine with the given information. But let me check the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the percentage of his cost that goes into his selling expenses. But again, without knowing the cost, I can't proceed.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in business, cost of sales is the cost of goods sold. But if JimDagney's sales are $2,000 and his sales are the total, but without knowing the cost, I can't find that percentage. So perhaps the question is flawed, and the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the question is about his profit margin. Profit is sales minus COGS. But again, without knowing COGS, I can't calculate that.

Wait, maybe the question is a simple percentage calculation. For example, if his earnings are $120, and his sales are $2,000, perhaps the percentage of his sales that is his earnings is 120/2000 = 6%, which is option E. But that doesn't make sense because it's not about the cost percentage.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about markup. If his total cost is $120 and his sales are $2,000, then markup is 2000 - 120 = 1880. But markup is calculated as (Selling Price - Cost)/Cost * 100. So (2000 - 120)/120 *100 = (1880/120)*100 â‰ˆ 1566.666%, which is way too high. So that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick and the correct answer is that it's not possible to determine with the given data. But the options are given, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the percentage of his sales he actually sells, which would be 100%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a typo and intended to say that his cost is $120, not his earnings. Let me try that.

If his COGS is $120 and his sales are $2,000, then the cost percentage would be (120 / 2000) *100 = 6%, which is option E. But the question says his earnings are $120. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is about his cost as a percentage of his sales, which would be (COGS / Sales) *100. But since we don't know COGS, that's not possible. Unless COGS is the same as his earnings, which doesn't make sense because earnings include both salary and commission.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick and the correct answer is that it's impossible to determine with the given information. But the options are there, so maybe I'm missing a key point.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the question is a play on words. Selling cost could refer to the cost of goods he sells, which is his COGS. But without knowing the COGS, this is impossible. So perhaps the correct answer is that the information is insufficient to determine the percentage.

But looking at the options, option E is 6%, which is a possible answer if COGS was $120 and sales $2000. But the question says he has an average of $120 per week. So that would be 6% (120/2000 *100 =6%). So perhaps the correct answer is E:6%. But why would the question specify 'selling cost percentage' if it's about his COGS? Because he's a salesman, and COGS would be the cost of the goods he sold, which is part of his sales.

Wait, but sales would be the total money made from selling goods, which includes COGS plus other expenses like commissions and other costs. So his sales would be higher than COGS. So, if his COGS is $120 and his sales are $2000, then the COGS percentage would be 6%. But the question is asking for 'selling cost percentage,' which might not be the same as COGS. Alternatively, perhaps it's the markup on COGS. But that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about his selling cost percentage. If his earnings are $120, which is his net profit. But that doesn't directly relate to the cost percentage. 

Wait, perhaps the question meant to say his cost percentage, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick and the answer is that it's impossible to determine, but the options don't include that. So maybe the correct answer is not in the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about his cost as a percentage of his sales. But without knowing COGS, we can't calculate that.

Wait, maybe the question is a trick and the correct answer is E:6%, assuming COGS is $120. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect in phrasing.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick, and the correct answer is that it's impossible to determine with the given information, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's not an option here.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the question is about his gross profit percentage. If his sales are $2,000 and his cost is $120 (earnings), then gross profit is $1880. Gross profit margin would be (1880/2000)*100=94%. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick and the correct answer is E:6%, assuming COGS is $120. But the question says his earnings are $120, which would be his total. So COGS would be part of that.

Wait, perhaps he has a 6% markup. If his COGS is $120, then 6% markup would be $7.20 profit, making total sales $127.20. But that's not matching the given sales of $2,000. So that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think if I can find any other approach. Maybe the question is about the percentage of his sales that he actually sells, which would be 100% but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps it's a discount, but that's not indicated.

Wait, perhaps the question is a simple percentage calculation. If his sales are $2,000 and his earnings (which include commission and salary) are $120, perhaps the commission is 6% of sales. Let's see: if commission is 6% of $2,000, that's $120. So his earnings are $120 (salary) plus $120 (commission) = $240, but the question says it's $120. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the commission is $120. So his sales are $2,000, and his commission is $120. So the percentage of sales that he made as commission is (120/2000)*100=6%. So in that case, the selling cost percentage would be 6%, which is option E. But the question says his sales average $2,000, and his earnings are $120. So if his commission is $120, his salary must be $0, which seems unlikely because that would mean he's not making any money. But perhaps that's the case.

Alternatively, if his commission is $120, then the percentage of sales that he made as commission is 6%. But the question asks for 'selling cost percentage.' So perhaps that's the answer. So option E:6%.

Wait, but the question says his earnings are $120, which would be the sum of his salary and commission. If his commission is 6% of sales, then his salary would be $2000 - (6% of 2000) = $2000 - $120 = $1880. His total earnings would then be $1880 + $120 = $2000, but the question says his earnings are $120. So that's a contradiction. So that can't be the case.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the earnings are only the salary, and his commission is zero. So his earnings would be $120, and his sales are $2,000. Then the percentage of sales as commission would be zero. But that doesn't help.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think of the options given. The options are A:12%, B:2%, C:7%, D:9%, E:6%, F:4%, G:5%, H:8%, I:3%, J:10%.

If the question is about the percentage of sales that he actually sells (like, his sales are $2,000), but the correct answer is 100%, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps it's about his cost, which is 100% of his COGS. But without knowing COGS, I can't find that.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick, and the correct answer is that it's not possible to determine with the given data. But given that the options are there, I must choose one.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the question is referring to the markup percentage as a percentage of his cost. If his cost is the same as his earnings, then 120/120=100%, which isn't an option. Alternatively, if his cost is lower than that, but without information, I can't calculate.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should pick the answer that makes sense based on the calculations I've done. If his sales are $2,000 and his earnings are $120, perhaps the percentage of his sales that he sold is 6%, which is option E. But that's not the correct term. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the markup on his cost. If the markup is 120 on a cost that's lower, but without knowing, I can't say.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate his commission as a percentage of sales. If his total earnings are $120, which includes commission and whatever his salary is. Let's assume that his salary is zero for simplicity. Then his commission would be $120. So the percentage of sales that he made as commission is (120/2000)*100=6%, which would be option E:6%. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the markup. If his COGS is $120 and his sales are $2000, then the markup would be (2000-120)/120 *100 = 1566.666%, which is not an option. So that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick, and the correct answer is that it's not possible to determine. But the options don't include that. Alternatively, I might have to choose the answer that makes the sum of his earnings as 100% of COGS. But again, without knowing, I can't proceed.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer is that it's not possible to determine with the given information, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is E:6%, assuming that his commission is 6% of sales. So I'll go with E.

The correct answer is E) 6%.

**Explanation:**
The question asks for JimDagney's selling cost percentage. The key steps to determine this are as follows:

1. **Understanding the terms**: Selling cost refers to the cost of goods sold (COGS), which is the cost incurred to produce the goods sold. This percentage is typically calculated as (COGS / Sales) * 100.

2. **Calculation of Commission**: If JimDagney's earnings (earnings) are $120, and assuming his commission is $120 (with the understanding that his salary is zero), then the percentage of his sales that he made as commission is (120 / 2000) * 100 = 6%.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on this assumption, the selling cost percentage is 6%, which corresponds to option E.
