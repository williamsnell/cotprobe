Okay, so I need to find the estimated global prevalence of untreated dental caries. Hmm, dental caries are also known as cavities, right? They can be caused by various factors like poor oral hygiene, genetics, and even some infections. 

I remember reading somewhere that the prevalence varies a lot depending on factors like age, gender, and whether someone is exposed to fluoride. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact percentage. Wait, I think I've heard that many people have a problem with cavities, but maybe it's not very high.

Let me think about the options provided. The options are A to J, with the percentages ranging from 10% to 90%. I'm trying to remember if there's a standard estimate. Oh, I think the average prevalence without any treatment might be around 30% to 40%. I've heard that about 70% of people have at least one cavity, but that's when they're treated. Untreated, it's lower.

Wait, no, that might be the other way around. If 70% have at least one cavity when treated, then the untreated might be lower. So maybe around 30%. Alternatively, I've heard that the global prevalence of untreated caries is estimated to be around 30-40%. So looking at the options, option A is 30% and option I is 40%. 

But I'm a bit confused. Another approach: I think that the majority of people have at least one cavity, often more than one, but not all. So maybe the prevalence is about 30-40%. Let's see the options again. A is 30%, I is 40%. 

I think the correct answer is around 30-40%, so the closest option is A (30%) or I (40%). Wait, but I'm not sure. Another angle: I've read that the most common caries is one, and the prevalence is around 70% when treated, meaning that 30% to 40% are untreated. So the estimated global prevalence would be 30-40%, making option A (30%) the correct choice.

The correct answer is the estimated global prevalence of untreated dental caries is around 30-40%. Among the options, option A (30%) represents this range.
