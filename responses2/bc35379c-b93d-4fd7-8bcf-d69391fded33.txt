Okay, so I have this question about an antenna's Q-factor. Hmm, I remember that Q-factor has something to do with quality factor, right? Oh wait, the Q-factor is a measure of the ratio of the bandwidth to the bandwidth at a particular frequency. Right, so Q is equal to (bandwidth)/(2 * VSWR) or something like that. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, no, wait. The Q-factor is (bandwidth)/(2 * bandwidth at a particular frequency), or is it just bandwidth over twice some other value. Oh wait, no, the formula is Q = (bandwidth)/(2 * VSWR), but wait, VSWR is the voltage standing wave ratio, which is related to the reflection coefficient. Oh wait, no, another approach: the Q-factor is the ratio of the bandwidth to the differential impedance (if it's a transmission line) or something. Alternatively, I think it's defined as the ratio of the actual bandwidth to the differential impedance. Or wait, maybe it's (bandwidth) divided by (2 times the impedance). Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the Q factor is the ratio of the resonant frequency to the bandwidth. Or is it the other way around? No, wait. The Q-factor is defined as the quality factor, which is the resonant frequency divided by the bandwidth. Wait, no, wait. Let me look it up in my notes. Oh wait, no, I'm supposed to think it through. 

The question gives the bandwidth as 0.8 MHz and the cut-off frequency as 44 MHz. Wait, wait, cut-off frequency and the resonant frequency are the same thing, right? Because the cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the antenna starts to attenuate the signal. So the resonant frequency is the same as the cutoff frequency. So in this case, both are 44 MHz.

Wait, but wait, no. No, wait, the question says the bandwidth is 0.8 MHz. Hmm. So the question says the bandwidth is 0.8 MHz and the cut-off frequency is 44 MHz. Wait, this is a bit confusing. Or perhaps the question says the bandwidth is 0.8 MHz and the cut-off frequency is 44 MHz. So, the Q-factor is calculated as (bandwidth) / (2 * VSWR), but no, wait. Or, another way: The Q-factor is equal to (bandwidth) divided by twice the differential impedance. Or, perhaps that's the case for a transmission line. Alternatively, for an antenna, maybe it's (bandwidth) divided by the differential impedance. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Q-factor is (bandwidth) divided by (2 times the difference between the resonant and near-resonant frequencies), but that's the same as bandwidth. No, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula again. The Q-factor (Q) of a resonant circuit is given by Q = (f_c) / (BW), where f_c is the resonant frequency and BW is the bandwidth. Oh wait, no, that's not right because bandwidth is 2 times the half-bandwidth. Wait, bandwidth is the difference between the upper and lower cutoff frequencies. If the half bandwidth is the same as the sideband width, then the bandwidth BW is twice that. So, for example, if the half bandwidth is 0.4 MHz, then the full bandwidth (BW) is 0.8 MHz.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing terms. Let me clarify: For a resonant circuit, the Q-factor is defined as the resonant frequency divided by the half-power bandwidth. So, Q = f_r / (BW), where BW is the half-power bandwidth. Wait, but the question here gives the full bandwidth as 0.8 MHz. So perhaps, if the full bandwidth is 0.8 MHz, then the half-power bandwidth is 0.4 MHz. So, in that case, the Q-factor would be f_r divided by half the full bandwidth. Let's see: f_r is 44 MHz, half bandwidth is 0.4 MHz. Q = 44e6 / 0.4e6 = 110. But that's not one of the options. Wait, but the options don't have 110. Hmm, so perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: The Q-factor is also given by (2 * f_c) / BW. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, wait, the standard formula is Q = f_c / (BW_half), where BW_half is the half bandwidth. So the half bandwidth is BW / 2. So, if the full bandwidth is 0.8 MHz, then the half bandwidth is 0.4 MHz. Then Q = f_c / (0.4 MHz). So f_c is 44 MHz. So 44e6 / 0.4e6 = 110. But the options don't have 110. Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe the question gives the full bandwidth as 0.8 MHz, which is the same as the difference between the upper and lower cutoff frequencies. So the half bandwidth is 0.4 MHz. So, using Q = f_c / (half bandwidth), so 44e6 / 0.4e6 = 110. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct formula is different.

Wait, maybe the Q-factor is the ratio of the resonant frequency to the bandwidth. So, Q = f / BW. So 44e6 / 0.8e6 = 55. Oh, that would give Q=55, which is option A. But wait, if the formula is Q = (BW) / (2 * VSWR), that complicates things. But perhaps in this question, the formula is Q = (bandwidth) / (2 * VSWR), but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the question is giving the full bandwidth as the product of Q and the half bandwidth. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question gives the full bandwidth, and the Q is the full bandwidth divided by twice the frequency. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let me think again. The standard Q-factor for a resonant circuit is Q = (f_c) / (BW_half). So, if the question provides the full bandwidth (BW_full) as 0.8 MHz, then BW_half is 0.4 MHz. So, Q = 44e6 / 0.4e6 = 110. But that's not an option here. So perhaps the correct formula is Q = (BW_full) / (2 * f_c). Then, Q = 0.8 MHz / (2 *44 MHz) = 0.8/(88) = approx 0.009, which is 0.009, but that's 0.9%, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Q = BW / (2 * f_c). Wait, that would be 0.8 MHz / (2 *44 MHz) = 0.8/(88) = approx 0.009, which is 0.9% which is way too low. So none of this is matching the options. So maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is giving the full bandwidth, but the formula for Q is (2 * f_c) / BW. So 2*44e6 / 0.8e6 = 88e6 / 0.8e6 = 110. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is giving the correct formula as Q = BW / (2 * f). But that would be 0.8 MHz / (2 * 44 MHz) = 0.8/(88) = 0.009, which is 0.9%, which is not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering the formula. Let me think of another approach. Let me think of the definition: Q is the ratio of the resonant frequency to the bandwidth. So Q = f_r / BW. So 44e6 / 0.8e6 = 55. Oh, that gives 55, which is option A. So that would suggest that the answer is A:55.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought that Q is f_c / BW_half. So, if using that, then f_c is 44 MHz, BW_half is 0.4 MHz, and Q would be 110, which isn't an option. So perhaps the formula used here is Q = f_c / BW. So, 44e6 / 0.8e6 = 55. So option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question gives the half bandwidth as 0.4 MHz, and Q = f_c / BW, which is 44e6 / 0.8e6 = 55. Hence, the answer would be A:55.

To calculate the Q-factor of the antenna, we use the formula:

\[
Q = \frac{f_c}{BW}
\]

where \( f_c \) is the resonant frequency (or cutoff frequency) and \( BW \) is the bandwidth. The question provides \( f_c = 44 \, \text{MHz} \) and \( BW = 0.8 \, \text{MHz} \). Substituting these values:

\[
Q = \frac{44 \, \text{MHz}}{0.8 \, \text{MHz}} = 55
\]

Thus, the Q-factor of the antenna is 55. This corresponds to option A.
