Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here. The question is asking for the last character of the answer, which is the last character of the correct multiple-choice option. The function given is y = (ln x)/x. Hmm, right. I need to find the relative maximum of this function.

Wait, relative maxima occur where the first derivative is zero and the second derivative is negative, or something like that. Let me think. So, I should start by finding the first derivative of y with respect to x.

Let me write down the function again: y = (ln x)/x. To find the derivative, I can use the quotient rule. The quotient rule states that if you have a function u(x)/v(x), the derivative is (u’v - uv’) / v².

So, here, u is ln x and v is x. The derivative of u, u', is 1/x, and the derivative of v, v', is 1.

Applying the quotient rule, the derivative dy/dx would be ( (1/x)(x) - (ln x)(1) ) / x². Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute the numerator: (1/x)*x is 1, and (ln x)*1 is ln x. So the numerator is 1 - ln x. The denominator is x squared. So dy/dx = (1 - ln x)/x².

Now, to find the critical points, I set dy/dx equal to zero. So (1 - ln x)/x² = 0. Since x² is always positive (for x > 0, which is the domain of ln x), the denominator can't be zero. So the numerator must be zero: 1 - ln x = 0. Solving for x, ln x = 1. Which means x = e^1 = e.

So the critical point is at x = e. Now, to determine whether this is a maximum or minimum, I can use the second derivative test. Alternatively, I can analyze the sign changes of the first derivative around x = e.

Let me think about the second derivative. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to test the intervals around x = e. Let's pick a value less than e, say x = 1. Plugging into dy/dx: (1 - ln 1)/1² = (1 - 0)/1 = 1, which is positive. So the function is increasing before x = e.

Now, pick a value greater than e, say x = e². dy/dx at x = e² is (1 - ln(e²))/ (e²)^2. ln(e²) is 2, so 1-2 is -1. So the derivative is negative here. That means the function is decreasing after x = e.

Since the function was increasing before e and decreasing after e, that means x = e is a point of local maximum. So the relative maximum occurs at x = e.

Now, the question asks for the value of the function at this maximum point. So plug x = e into y = (ln x)/x. That gives y = (ln e)/e = (1)/e = 1/e. So the relative maximum is 1/e.

Looking at the options, let's see:

A: e/2 ≈ 1.35

B: 1

C: e² ≈ 7.389

D: 2/e ≈ 0.735

E: 1/2 = 0.5

F: e ≈ 2.718

G: e/(2e) = 1/2 ≈0.5

H: 1/e ≈0.367

I: 2

J: 1/(2e) ≈0.184

Wait, wait. Wait a second, I thought the maximum value was 1/e, which is option H. But looking back, the options are A to J, and the choices are individual letters. So the correct answer is 1/e, which is option H.

Wait, but I just realized the options are labeled A to J, and each option is a value. So the question is asking for the last character of the correct answer, which is the last character of the correct option. So the correct option is H, whose last character is 'H'.

Wait, but looking again at the options, option H is written as "H: 1/e". So the correct value is 1/e, which is option H. So the last character of the correct answer is 'H'.

But wait, let me double-check. Could I have made a mistake in my calculation? Let me recheck.

Wait, the function is y = (ln x)/x. Its derivative is (1 - ln x)/x². Setting that to zero gives ln x = 1, so x = e. Then y = (1)/e, which is approximately 0.367, so that's 1/e. So yes, the correct value is 1/e, which is H.

So the last character is 'H', so the answer must be H.

The function's relative maximum occurs at \( x = e \), where \( y = \frac{1}{e} \). The correct option is H, whose last character is 'H'.
