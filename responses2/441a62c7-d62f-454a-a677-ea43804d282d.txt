Okay, so I've got this problem here about Paul's lunch choices. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll give it a shot.

So Paul likes Twinkies (t) and soda (s), and his utility is given by U(t,s) = sqrt(ts). That's the same as U = (ts)^(1/2). I remember that utility functions help determine what's best for maximizing satisfaction, but I'm not exactly sure how to apply them here.

The problem says Paul's mom gives him $1 to spend. Twinkies are $0.10 each, and soda is $0.25 each. So his budget constraint is 0.10t + 0.25s = 1. I need to find how many Twinkies he should buy to maximize his utility.

Hmm, I think I need to maximize the utility function U(t,s) = sqrt(ts) under the budget constraint. Maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or perhaps some algebraic approach. Alternatively, since it's a simple case, maybe I can express s in terms of t or vice versa.

Let me try expressing the budget constraint in terms of s. So,

0.10t + 0.25s = 1
=> 0.25s = 1 - 0.10t
=> s = (1 - 0.10t) / 0.25
=> s = (1/0.25) - (0.10/0.25) t
=> s = 4 - 0.4t.

Wait, let me double-check that division. 0.25 is a quarter, so 1 divided by 0.25 is 4. And 0.10 divided by 0.25 is 0.4, right? So yes, s = 4 - 0.4t.

Now the utility function becomes U = sqrt(t*(4 - 0.4t)). I can write that as U = (4t - 0.4t²)^(1/2). Alternatively, it's sqrt(4t - 0.4t²), which can be written as sqrt(4t(1 - 0.1t)).

I need to maximize U with respect to t. So maybe take the derivative of U with respect to t and set it to zero.

Let me compute the derivative. Let me denote U = (4t - 0.4t²)^(1/2). So dU/dt = (1/2)(4t - 0.4t²)^(-1/2) * (4 - 0.8t).

Set derivative to zero:

(1/2)(4t - 0.4t²)^(-1/2) * (4 - 0.8t) = 0.

The term (4t - 0.4t²)^(-1/2) is never zero because the exponent is negative. So the main equation to solve is (4 - 0.8t) = 0.

Wait, that makes sense because the derivative is zero when 4 - 0.8t = 0.

Solving for t:

4 = 0.8t
t = 4 / 0.8
t = 5.

Wait that gives t=5. So Paul should buy 5 Twinkies. Let me check the options. Oh, option G is 5. So that would be the answer.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should use the concept of marginal utility. I remember that the marginal utility of t is the change in utility when you buy one more t, and similarly for s.

So, let me think: the marginal utility of t is the derivative of U with respect to t: dU/dt = (1/2) * (ts)^(−1/2) * s = s/(2 sqrt(ts)) = s/(2 sqrt(t)s) ) = 1/(2 sqrt(t)).

Similarly, the marginal utility of s is dU/ds = t/(2 sqrt(ts)) = t/(2 sqrt(s)).

At the optimal point, the ratio of marginal utilities should equal the ratio of the prices. Because, from consumer theory, MUn/Pn should be the same for both goods.

So, MUn_s / MUn_t = P_s / P_t.

Wait, the formula is: MUn_s / MUn_t = P_s / P_t.

So plugging in the values.

MUn_s = t/(2 sqrt(ts)) = t/(2 sqrt(t)s) )= t/(2 sqrt(t) s) )= sqrt(t)/(2 s).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me compute it again.

MUn_s = derivative of U with respect to s. U = sqrt(ts) = t^(1/2) s^(1/2).

So derivative with respect to s: (1/2) t^(1/2) s^(-1/2) = (1/2) sqrt(t)/sqrt(s).

Similarly, MUn_t = (1/2) sqrt(s) / sqrt(t) ) = (1/2) sqrt(s/t).

So the ratio MUn_s / MUn_t = [ (1/2) sqrt(t)/sqrt(s) ] / [ (1/2) sqrt(s/t) ].

Simplify that:

= [sqrt(t)/sqrt(s)] / [ sqrt(s/t) ]

= [ sqrt(t)/sqrt(s) ] * [ sqrt(t)/sqrt(s) ) ] since 1/sqrt(s/t) is sqrt(t/s).

Wait, sqrt(t/s) is same as 1/sqrt(s/t). Wait, no, sqrt(a/b) = sqrt(a)/sqrt(b). So sqrt(t/s) is sqrt(t)/sqrt(s). Therefore, 1/sqrt(s/t) = sqrt(t/s).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to take the ratio:

MUn_s / MUn_t = [ (1/2) sqrt(t)/sqrt(s) ] / [ (1/2) sqrt(s/t) ].

The 1/2 cancels, so:

= [ sqrt(t)/sqrt(s) ] / [ sqrt(s/t) ]

= [ sqrt(t)/sqrt(s) ] * [ sqrt(t)/sqrt(s) ) ]

Because sqrt(s/t) is same as 1/(sqrt(t/s)) ), but wait, perhaps I should just calculate it.

Wait, let me compute the denominator: sqrt(s/t) is equal to 1/(sqrt(t/s)) ), but maybe it's easier to square both numerator and denominator.

Alternatively, let's compute the ratio:

MUn_s / MUn_t = [ sqrt(t)/sqrt(s) ] / [ sqrt(s)/sqrt(t) ].

Because sqrt(a/b) is sqrt(a)/sqrt(b). So denominator is sqrt(s)/sqrt(t).

So the ratio becomes [sqrt(t)/sqrt(s)] * [sqrt(t)/sqrt(s)] / [1] = [t/s].

Wait, because [sqrt(t)/sqrt(s)] divided by [sqrt(s)/sqrt(t)] is [sqrt(t)/sqrt(s)] * [sqrt(t)/sqrt(s)] = (t)/(s).

So MUn_s / MUn_t = t/s.

According to the condition, t/s = P_s/P_t.

Because MUn_s / MUn_t = P_s / P_t.

Wait, yes, because the ratio of marginal utilities is equal to the ratio of prices.

Wait, but wait, that's the condition for optimality. So MUn_s / MUn_t = P_s / P_t.

Wait, no, actually, the condition is MUn_s / MUn_t = P_s / P_t.

So t/s = P_s / P_t.

P_s is the price of soda, which is $0.25.

P_t is price of Twinkies, $0.10.

So t/s = 0.25 / 0.10 = 2.5.

So t = 2.5 s.

Wait, but I'm getting a ratio of t/s=2.5, so t=2.5 s.

Hmm, but earlier when I solved via substitution, I found t=5, s=4 - 0.4*5 = 4-2=2. So s=2, t=5. Let's check if t/s =5/2=2.5, which matches the price ratio.

Yes, so that's consistent.

So that gives me the same result as before. So t=5. So Paul should buy 5 Twinkies.

Looking back at the options, option G is 5.

Wait, but wait a second. I should check whether this is indeed the maximum. Let me compute the utility for t=5, s=2.

U = sqrt(5*2)=sqrt(10)= approx 3.16.

What about t=4, s=4−0.4*4=4-1.6=2.4. So U= sqrt(4*2.4)=sqrt(9.6)= approx 3.098.

Which is lower than 3.16.

What about t=6, s=4−0.4*6=4−2.4=1.6. U= sqrt(6*1.6)=sqrt(9.6)= same as before, 3.098.

t=3, s=4−0.4*3=4−1.2=2.8. U= sqrt(3*2.8)=sqrt(8.4)=approx 2.898.

Lower.

t=5 s=2 gives a higher utility.

So yes, t=5 is indeed the maximum.

So the correct answer is G:5.

To determine how many Twinkies Paul should buy to maximize his utility, we analyze the utility function and budget constraint. Paul's utility is given by \( U(t, s) = \sqrt{ts} \), and his budget constraint is \( 0.10t + 0.25s = 1 \). 

First, express \( s \) in terms of \( t \):
\[
0.10t + 0.25s = 1 \implies s = \frac{1 - 0.10t}{0.25} = 4 - 0.4t.
\]
Substitute \( s \) into the utility function:
\[
U = \sqrt{t(4 - 0.4t)} = \sqrt{4t - 0.4t^2}.
\]
To maximize \( U \), we can use calculus. Taking the derivative of \( U \) with respect to \( t \) and setting it to zero:
\[
\frac{dU}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}(4t - 0.4t^2)^{-1/2}(4 - 0.8t) = 0.
\]
The term \( (4t - 0.4t^2)^{-1/2} \) is never zero, so:
\[
4 - 0.8t = 0 \implies t = \frac{4}{0.8} = 5.
\]
Thus, Paul should buy 5 Twinkies. Checking the options, G corresponds to 5.

Additionally, using the condition for consumer optimality, the ratio of marginal utilities equals the price ratio:
\[
\frac{MUn_s}{MUn_t} = \frac{P_s}{P_t}.
\]
Calculating the marginal utilities:
\[
MUn_s = \frac{t}{2\sqrt{ts}}, \quad MUn_t = \frac{s}{2\sqrt{ts}}.
\]
Their ratio:
\[
\frac{MUn_s}{MUn_t} = \frac{\sqrt{t}}{\sqrt{s}}.
\]
Setting this equal to \( \frac{P_s}{P_t} = \frac{0.25}{0.10} = 2.5 \):
\[
\frac{\sqrt{t}}{\sqrt{s}} = 2.5 \implies t = 2.5s.
\]
Substituting \( t = 2.5s \) into the budget constraint:
\[
0.10(2.5s) + 0.25s = 1 \implies 0.25s + 0.25s = 1 \implies s = 2, \quad t = 5.
\]
Both methods confirm that Paul should buy **5 Twinkies**.
