Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says there are two particles, each with a charge of 12 nC, and they're at two corners of an equilateral triangle with sides of 2.0 meters. The third corner is where we need to find the electric field. Oh wait, and both charges are positive. So, what do I know?

Alright, I remember that the electric field due to a point charge is given by Coulomb's law, E = kQ / r², where k is Coulomb's constant (approx 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C²). But wait, since there are two charges, I have to find the electric fields from each of them at the third point and then add them vectorially.

Wait, but the particles are at two vertices of an equilateral triangle. So the third vertex is at a distance of 2 meters from each of the two charges. Because in an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. So each charge is 2 meters away from the third point.

So, each charge creates an electric field at the third point. Since both charges are positive, the fields they produce will both point away from their respective charges.

Let me visualize this. Let's say the two charges are at points A and B, and the third point is C. The triangle ABC is equilateral, so AB is 2m, BC is 2m, and AC is 2m.

At point C, the electric field from A will be pointing away from A, and the field from B will point away from B. But wait, since A and B are both positive, their fields at C are directed away from each. So, what's the angle between these two fields?

In an equilateral triangle, each angle is 60 degrees. So, the angle between the two electric field vectors at point C is 60 degrees.

Wait, no, wait. The positions of A and B relative to C. Let me think again. Let me imagine points A and B. Point C is opposite the side AB. So the angle between the two vectors from A and B to C would be 60 degrees. Because in the triangle, each angle is 60 degrees.

But wait, when you have two vectors at an angle θ, the magnitude of the resultant vector can be found using the law of cosines. So the resultant E is the square root of E1 squared plus E2 squared minus 2 E1 E2 cosθ. But wait, since it's a vector addition, it's E1 + E2.

Wait, but in this problem, both charges are positive, so each E points away. So, the angle between the two E vectors is 60 degrees.

Wait, actually, the angle between the two vectors from A and B to C is 60 degrees because the triangle is equilateral. So, the angle between the vectors is 60 degrees.

Wait, no. Let's think about the positions. Let's say charge A is at (0,0), charge B is at (2,0), and point C is at (1, sqrt(3)) because the height of an equilateral triangle with side length 2 is sqrt(3). So from point C, each charge is at a distance of 2 meters.

So the vectors from A to C and from B to C are vectors pointing in directions. Let me calculate the direction of each vector.

Vector from A to C: from (0,0) to (1, sqrt(3)) is (1, sqrt(3)). The angle of this vector with the x-axis is arctan( (sqrt(3))/1 ) = 60 degrees.

Vector from B to C: from (2,0) to (1, sqrt(3)) is (-1, sqrt(3)). The angle for this vector is arctan( (sqrt(3))/(-1) ), but since the x-component is negative, the angle is 180 - 60 = 120 degrees from the positive x-axis.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the angle between the two vectors at C. So vector AC is pointing 60 degrees above the x-axis, and vector BC is pointing 120 degrees from the x-axis. So the angle between them is 120 -60=60 degrees. So the angle between them is 60 degrees.

So, each E vector has the same magnitude because the charges are same and distance same.

Wait, so each E field from A and B is the same. Let me compute E from each charge.

E = k Q / r². Q is 12 nC, which is 12e-9 C. r is 2 meters. So,

E = (8.988e9 N m²/C²) * (12e-9 C) / (2 m)^2.

Calculating that:

E = (8.988e9 * 12e-9) / 4.

8.988e9 *12e-9 = (8.988 *12) * (1e9 * 1e-9) ) = 107.856 * 1 = 107.856.

Divide by 4: 107.856 /4 ≈ 26.964 N/C.

Wait, but wait, that's the magnitude of each E. Since both are same, let's say E1 and E2 are each 26.964 N/C.

But wait, the angle between the two E vectors is 60 degrees, so we have to find the resultant E = E1 + E2.

Hmm, so the two vectors form a triangle. Let's think of E1 and E2 as sides of a triangle, and the angle between them is 60 degrees.

The magnitude of the resultant E can be found using the law of cosines: E^2 = E1^2 + E2^2 - 2 E1 E2 cosθ.

But since E1 and E2 are equal, let's say E1 = E2 = E. Then,

E^2 = 2 E² - 2 E² cosθ.

Wait, wait, no: 

Wait, let me recompute. The formula is E = sqrt(E1^2 + E2^2 + 2 E1 E2 cosφ), where φ is the angle between them. Or wait, no, the formula depends on the angle. Wait, perhaps I should think about the law of cosines correctly.

Actually, the angle between the two vectors is 60 degrees. So the triangle formed by E1, E2, and the resultant E has sides E1, E2, and E.

The angle opposite to E is the angle between E1 and E2, which is 60 degrees. So, using the law of cosines, we can find E as:

E² = E1² + E2² - 2 E1 E2 cos(60°)

Since E1 = E2 = E, this becomes:

E² = E² + E² - 2 E² cos(60°)

Simplify:

E² = 2 E² - 2 E² (0.5) 

Because cos 60° is 0.5.

So,

E² = 2 E² - E² 

Which is E² = E², which doesn't help. Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Wait, wait, the law of cosines is E² = E1² + E2² - 2 E1 E2 cosθ, where θ is the angle between E1 and E2. So, in this case, θ is 60 degrees.

So,

E² = E1² + E2² - 2 E1 E2 cos(60°)

Since E1 = E2 = E, this becomes:

E² = E² + E² - 2 E² * 0.5

E² = 2 E² - E²

Which gives E² = E² → 0 = 0. That's not helpful. I must have messed up which angle I'm using.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the angle between the vectors. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the magnitude of the sum of two vectors when the angle between them is known.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the vector components and add them.

So, each E vector is 26.964 N/C, at angles 60 degrees and 120 degrees from the x-axis.

Wait, vector E due to charge A: it's pointing away from A. So from point A (0,0), the field is pointing towards (1, sqrt(3)). So the vector from A to C is (1, sqrt(3)). So the direction is 60 degrees above x-axis.

Similarly, vector E due to charge B points away from B (2,0), so from (2,0) to (1, sqrt(3)) is (-1, sqrt(3)). The direction is 120 degrees from the x-axis. Because when you look from B, the point C is at 60 degrees above the line connecting B to the midpoint. But since B is at (2,0), the vector from B to C is (-1, sqrt(3)), which is 120 degrees (as tan(theta) = (sqrt(3))/(-1) → 120 degrees).

So, each E vector is 26.964 N/C.

So, for E1 (from A):

E1_x = E * cos(60°) = 26.964 * 0.5 = 13.482 N/C.

E1_y = E * sin(60°) = 26.964 * (√3/2) ≈ (26.964 * 0.866) ≈ 23.48 N/C.

For E2 (from B):

E2_x = E * cos(120°) = 26.964 * (-0.5) = -13.482 N/C.

E2_y = E * sin(120°) = 26.964 * (√3/2) ≈ 23.48 N/C.

Now, add the x-components: E1_x + E2_x = 13.482 -13.482 = 0 N/C.

Add the y-components: E1_y + E2_y = 23.48 +23.48 = 46.96 N/C.

So the resultant electric field is 46.96 N/C in the positive y-direction.

Therefore, the magnitude is approximately 46.96 N/C. Looking at the options, option G is 47 N/C. So the answer should be G.

To determine the magnitude of the electric field at the third vertex of the equilateral triangle formed by two charges of 12 nC each, we proceed as follows:

1. **Electric Field from a Point Charge**:  
   The electric field due to a point charge is given by:  
   \[
   E = \frac{kQ}{r^2}
   \]  
   where \(k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2}\), \(Q = 12 \, \mathrm{nC} = 12 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C}\), and \(r = 2.0 \, \mathrm{m}\).  

   Substituting these values:  
   \[
   E = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(12 \times 10^{-9})}{(2.0)^2} = \frac{107.856}{4} \approx 26.964 \, \mathrm{N/C}.
   \]  
   Thus, the magnitude of the electric field due to each charge is approximately \(26.964 \, \mathrm{N/C}\).

2. **Positions of Charges and Third Vertex**:  
   The two charges are located at two vertices of an equilateral triangle, and the third vertex is where the electric field is to be determined. The distance from each charge to the third vertex is \(r = 2.0 \, \mathrm{m}\).  

3. **Angle Between Electric Fields**:  
   In an equilateral triangle, the angle between the lines connecting the third vertex to the two charges is \(60^\circ\). The electric fields produced by the charges at the third vertex are vectors pointing away from the charges, forming a \(60^\circ\) angle with respect to each other.

4. **Resultant Electric Field**:  
   To find the resultant electric field, we add the two vectors using vector addition. The resultant magnitude is calculated using the formula for the sum of two vectors:  
   \[
   E_{\text{resultant}} = \sqrt{E_1^2 + E_2^2 + 2E_1E_2\cos\theta},
   \]  
   where \(E_1 = E_2 = 26.964 \, \mathrm{N/C}\) and \(\theta = 60^\circ\).  

   Substituting:  
   \[
   E_{\text{resultant}} = \sqrt{(26.964)^2 + (26.964)^2 + 2(26.964)(26.964)\cos(60^\circ)}.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   E_{\text{resultant}} = \sqrt{2(26.964)^2 + 2(26.964)^2(0.5)} = \sqrt{3(26.964)^2} = 26.964 \times \sqrt{3} \approx 46.964 \, \mathrm{N/C}.
   \]  

5. **Magnitude of the Resultant Electric Field**:  
   The magnitude of the resultant electric field is approximately \(46.964 \, \mathrm{N/C}\), which matches option \(G\) (\(47 \, \mathrm{N/C}\)).
