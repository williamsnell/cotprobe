Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about the dissociation of a polyprotic acid, specifically H3PO4. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

So first, the question is about the dissociation sequence and ranking the strength of the acids in order of decreasing strength. The options are all different orders of H3PO4 and its various ions.

I remember that polyprotic acids can donate more than one proton. H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. So, it can donate three protons. The first proton is H3PO4 losing a proton to become H2PO4^-. The second is H2PO4^- losing a proton to become HPO4^2-. And the third is HPO4^2- losing a proton to become PO4^3-.

Each of these steps is a Bronsted-Lowry acid dissociation. The strength of the acid is related to the ease with which it donates a proton. The stronger the acid, the more stable its conjugate base because it's easier to lose a proton.

Wait, the question is about the acids themselves, not their conjugate bases. So I should focus on the strength of the acids before they lose a proton.

I think the first proton is the most acidic. Because when an acid donates a proton, it becomes more stable. The more stable the conjugate base after losing a proton, the stronger the original acid.

So the first dissociation (H3PO4 → H2PO4^-) is the strongest acid. Then the second (H2PO4^- → HPO4^2-) is weaker than the first. The third (HPO4^2- → PO4^3-) is even weaker.

So the order of acid strength from strongest to weakest would be H3PO4 > H2PO4^- > HPO4^2- > PO4^3-.

Wait, but the question is about the dissociation sequence, so the order is the strength of the acids. So the strongest acid first, then the next, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option I: H2PO4^- , H3PO4 , HPO4^-2 → No, that's not right. The order should be the strongest first. So I think the correct order is H3PO4 is strongest, then H2PO4^-, then HPO4^2-, then PO4^3-.

Looking at the options, option G is H2PO4^- , HPO4^2- , H3PO4. That's the opposite of what I thought. Option H is H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, which would be from strongest to weaker. So H3PO4 is first, then H2, then HPO4, then PO4^3-.

So option H is the correct order.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to think: when you have multiple dissociation steps, the first step is the strongest acid. Because when you lose a proton, the conjugate base is more stable. So the first step is the strongest, then the second, etc.

So the correct order is H3PO4 (strongest) → H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- → PO4^3-.

So the order from strongest to weakest is H3PO4 > H2PO4^- > HPO4^2- > PO4^3-.

Looking at the options:

Option H: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2- → wait, no, because option H is H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-.

Wait, the options are:

A: H2, HPO4^2-, H3PO4 → no, that's H2 then HPO4^2- which is weaker than H3PO4.

B: HPO4^2- , H3PO4 , H2PO4^- → no, the first is HPO4 which is weaker than H3.

C: HPO4^2-, H2PO4^- , H3PO4 → No, H3 is the strongest, so first option would be strongest first.

Wait, option H is: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-.

So yes, that's correct. Option H is correct.

Looking back, option H: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-.

Wait, what about option G? G is H2PO4^-, HPO4^2- , H3PO4 → which is the reverse. No, that's the wrong order.

So the correct option is option H.

The dissociation sequence of the polyprotic acid H₃PO₄ involves three protons being lost in successive steps: H₃PO₄ → H₂PO₄⁻, H₂PO₄⁻ → HPO₄²⁻, and HPO₄²⁻ → PO₄³⁻. The strength of the acid is determined by the stability of its conjugate base after donating a proton. The first proton loss (H₃PO₄ → H₂PO₄⁻) is the most acidic, followed by the second (H₂PO₄⁻ → HPO₄²⁻), and the third (HPO₄²⁻ → PO₄³⁻) is the least acidic.

The correct order of decreasing acid strength is:

1. H₃PO₄ (strongest acid)
2. H₂PO₄⁻
3. HPO₄²⁻
4. PO₄³⁻

From the given options:

- **Option H** correctly lists the order as H₃PO₄, H₂PO₄⁻, HPO₄²⁻, which matches the decreasing strength of the acids.
- Other options either list the acids in the wrong order or include incorrect ions (e.g., HPO₄²⁻ instead of PO₄³⁻ or H₂PO₄⁻ instead of H₃PO₄).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option H**.
