Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about equilibrium constants and reaction rates. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. The question is about a reversible reaction, specifically H₂ + X₂ ↔ 2 HX. It's a second-order reaction because it's second-order overall (each molecule contributes one degree of freedom, so two in this case). The question is asking me to express the thermodynamic equilibrium constant K in terms of the rate constants k_a and k_b. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait, no, the question says in terms of k_a and k_b, but I'm a bit confused because the standard notation for reaction rates might be different. Oh, wait, sometimes k_a is the forward rate constant and k_b the reverse. Or wait, sometimes it's called the reverse rate constant. Maybe I should clarify this.

The reaction is H₂ + X₂ → 2 HX, and it's reversible: H₂ + X₂ ↔ 2 HX. So, the forward reaction (from left to right) is k_a, and the reverse (from right to left) is k_b. Or maybe it's the other way around? Because sometimes k_a is the forward rate and k_b the reverse. Or maybe the problem defines k_a as the forward and k_b as the reverse. Oh, the question says k_a is for the reaction a right arrows b (but wait, looking again, the reaction is written as H2 + X2 → a ↔ b? Hmm, no, probably not. Let's look again.

Wait the reaction is written as H₂ + X₂ (a) right arrows (k_a) b? Wait no, the problem gives the reaction as H2 + X2 → k_a a right arrows k_b b. Or wait, perhaps the notation is a bit different. Oh, no, the problem states that the reaction is written as H2 + X2 → k_a a right arrows k_b b. Wait, no, actually, looking again: the question says, "the reaction H2 + X2^(k_a) right arrows k_b b." Wait, perhaps the notation is different. Let me take another look.

The reaction is written as H₂ + X₂ ↔ k_a a right arrows k_b b. Hmm, perhaps a and b are the products and reactants, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, the reaction is written as H2 + X2 → k_a a → k_b b. Maybe the notation is that k_a is the rate of the forward reaction, and k_b is the reverse rate? Or perhaps k_b is the forward rate. Wait, sometimes in thermodynamics, K is written as K = (k_forward)/(k_reverse). So, if the reaction is written as a → b with forward rate k_forward, then K is (k_forward)/(k_reverse). So for this reaction, the forward rate is k_a and the reverse is k_b. So K would be k_a / k_b. But looking at the options, let me see.

Wait, the options are:

A: (k_b / k_a) = K

B: K = k_a + k_b

C: K = (k_b * k_b)/k_a

D: (k_a / k_b) = K

E: K = sqrt(k_a / k_b)

F: K = k_a * k_b

G: K = (k_a - k_b) if k_a > k_b, else K = (k_b - k_a)

H: K = (k_a + k_b)/(k_a * k_b)

I: K = 1/(k_a + k_b)

J: K = (k_a * k_a)/k_b

Wait, so our goal is K = (k_a / k_b), because K is the equilibrium constant, which is the ratio of the forward to reverse rate constants. So that would be option D.

But wait, let me make sure. Oh wait, wait a minute. Another approach: for a reaction a → b, the equilibrium constant K is K = (k_forward)/(k_backward). So if the reaction given is written as H2 + X2 → 2 HX, then the forward rate is k_a and the reverse is k_b. Therefore, K = k_a / k_b. So option D. So why is the option I also involving (k_a + k_b)? That would be the case if K were (k_a +k_b) divided by something else, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, but wait another moment. The problem says the reaction is H2 + X2 ↔ k_a a right arrows k_b b. It's a bit confusing. Or perhaps, wait, the question says the reaction is H₂ + X₂ → k_a a right arrows k_b b. Maybe a and b are products and reactants. Wait, perhaps the forward direction is a→b, and the reverse is b→a. So K would be (k_a) / (k_b), making option D correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses k_a as the rate of the forward reaction (a→b) and k_b as the reverse (b→a). So K = k_a / k_b, which is option D.

But why would option I be there? Let me recheck the options. Option I is K = 1/(k_a +k_b). Oh, that's the reciprocal of the sum of the two. That would be if K were (k_b/k_a) or something else. But no, K is the ratio of forward to reverse, so 1/(k_b/k_a) would be k_a/k_b, which is option D.

So the correct answer should be option D, K= k_a/k_b. So looking at the options, option D says (k_a / k_b) = K.

To determine the thermodynamic equilibrium constant \( K \) for the reaction \( \text{H}_2 + \text{X}_2 \leftrightarrow 2 \text{HX} \), we start by noting the reaction is second-order, with the forward reaction rate constant \( k_a \) and the reverse reaction rate constant \( k_b \). For a reversible reaction, the equilibrium constant \( K \) is defined as the ratio of the forward rate constant to the reverse rate constant, \( K = \frac{k_a}{k_b} \).

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** \( \frac{k_b}{k_a} = K \)  
  This is incorrect because \( K \) is the ratio of the forward rate constant to the reverse rate constant, not the other way around.

- **Option B:** \( K = k_a + k_b \)  
  This is incorrect because \( K \) is a ratio, not a sum of the rate constants.

- **Option C:** \( K = \frac{k_b^2}{k_a} \)  
  This is incorrect because the equilibrium constant does not involve the square of the reverse rate constant.

- **Option D:** \( \frac{k_a}{k_b} = K \)  
  This is correct because \( K \) is defined as the ratio of the forward to the reverse rate constants.

- **Option E:** \( K = \sqrt{\frac{k_a}{k_b}} \)  
  This is incorrect because \( K \) is not the square root of the ratio of the rate constants.

- **Option F:** \( K = k_a \cdot k_b \)  
  This is incorrect because \( K \) is a ratio, not a product of the rate constants.

- **Option G:** \( K = k_a - k_b \) (if \( k_a > k_b \), else \( K = k_b - k_a \))  
  This is incorrect because \( K \) is not dependent on the difference between the rate constants.

- **Option H:** \( K = \frac{k_a + k_b}{k_a \cdot k_b} \)  
  This is incorrect because \( K \) is not a sum of the rate constants.

- **Option I:** \( K = \frac{1}{k_a + k_b} \)  
  This is incorrect because \( K \) is not the reciprocal of the sum of the rate constants.

### Conclusion:
The correct expression for the equilibrium constant \( K \) in terms of \( k_a \) and \( k_b \) is \( K = \frac{k_a}{k_b} \), which corresponds to **Option D**.
