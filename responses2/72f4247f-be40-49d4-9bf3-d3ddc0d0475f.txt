Okay, so I've got this fraction to simplify by rationalizing the denominator. The fraction is 4 over (sqrt(108) + 2*sqrt(12) + 2*sqrt(27)). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that rationalizing denominators usually involves getting rid of the square roots in the denominator. I think the standard approach is to multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator if it's a binomial. But wait, in this case, the denominator has three terms. That might be trickier. Maybe I can simplify each square root first before trying to rationalize.

Let me look at each square root term individually.

Starting with sqrt(108). I know that 108 can be broken down into factors. Let's see, 108 divided by 36 is 3. So sqrt(108) is sqrt(36*3) which is sqrt(36)*sqrt(3) = 6*sqrt(3). Okay, that simplifies to 6√3.

Next, 2*sqrt(12). Let's compute sqrt(12) first. 12 is 4*3, so sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3). Multiply by 2, that's 2*(2*sqrt(3)) = 4√3.

Then, 2*sqrt(27). 27 is 9*3, so sqrt(27) is 3*sqrt(3). Multiply by 2, that's 2*(3*sqrt(3)) = 6√3.

So substituting back into the denominator: sqrt(108) is 6√3, 2*sqrt(12) is 4√3, and 2*sqrt(27) is 6√3. So the denominator becomes 6√3 + 4√3 + 6√3.

Adding those up: 6√3 + 4√3 is 10√3, plus 6√3 is 16√3. Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.

Wait, 6√3 + 4√3 is 10√3, and then adding 6√3 gives 16√3. Hmm, that seems correct. So the denominator simplifies to 16√3.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. 6√3 +4√3 is 10√3, plus 6√3 is 16√3? Wait, no. 6√3 +4√3 is 10√3. Then adding 6√3 gives 16√3. Oh, no, wait, that can't be right because 6√3 +4√3 is 10√3, plus 6√3 is 16√3? Wait, no—wait, 6√3 plus 4√3 is 10√3, and then adding 6√3 would make it 16√3. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check the original denominator again.

Wait, the original denominator is sqrt(108) + 2*sqrt(12) + 2*sqrt(27). So sqrt(108) is 6√3, 2*sqrt(12) is 2*(2√3) = 4√3, and 2*sqrt(27) is 2*(3√3) = 6√3. So adding all three: 6√3 +4√3 +6√3 = (6+4+6)√3 = 16√3. Yes, that seems correct.

So now the fraction becomes 4/(16√3). Simplifying that, 4 divided by 16 is 1/4. So now it's (1/4)/√3. Which can be written as 1/(4√3).

But wait, the question says to rationalize the denominator. So I need to get rid of the square root in the denominator. To do that, I can multiply both numerator and denominator by √3.

So, 1/(4√3) multiplied by √3/√3 gives (1*√3)/(4√3*√3). The denominator becomes 4*(√3)^2, which is 4*3 =12. So the fraction becomes √3/12.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, I don't see √3/12 directly. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A: 1/(4√27)
B: 1/(2√3)
C: 2√12
D: 1/(4√3)
E: 2√27
F: 4√3/33
G: 4√3/27
H: 4√3/12
I: 4√3/108
J: √3/12

So option J is √3/12, which is what I arrived at. So that's the simplified form.

Wait a second, let me go through this again because I feel like I might have made a mistake in the initial simplification. Because when I simplified each term, I got 16√3, but let me recheck the initial terms.

Wait, sqrt(108) is sqrt(36*3) which is 6√3. 2*sqrt(12) is 2*(2√3) which is 4√3. 2*sqrt(27) is 2*(3√3) which is 6√3. So adding them all: 6√3 +4√3=10√3, plus 6√3 is 16√3. So denominator is 16√3. So 4/(16√3) simplifies to 1/(4√3) and then multiply numerator and denominator by √3 gives √3/12, which is option J.

Wait, but let me make sure there wasn't a mistake in the initial step. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the square roots. Let me recheck each term.

sqrt(108): 108 is 36*3, so sqrt(36*3)=6√3. Correct.

2*sqrt(12): sqrt(12)=2√3, so 2*(2√3)=4√3. Correct.

2*sqrt(27): 27 is 9*3, so sqrt(27)=3√3, so 2*(3√3)=6√3. Correct.

So denominators are 6√3, 4√3, 6√3. Adding: 6+4+6=16, so 16√3. So the fraction becomes 4/(16√3)=1/(4√3) which is √3/12 after rationalization. So the answer is J.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option H is 4√3/12, which simplifies to √3/3. Option J is √3/12. So I think I did it correctly. So the answer is option J.
</think>

The original fraction is simplified by first simplifying each square root in the denominator. Each term is calculated as follows:

- \(\sqrt{108} = 6\sqrt{3}\)
- \(2\sqrt{12} = 4\sqrt{3}\)
- \(2\sqrt{27} = 6\sqrt{3}\)

Adding these together: \(6\sqrt{3} + 4\sqrt{3} + 6\sqrt{3} = 16\sqrt{3}\). 

The fraction becomes \( \frac{4}{16\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{4\sqrt{3}} \). Rationalizing the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by \(\sqrt{3}\) gives \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{12}\), which corresponds to option J.
