Okay, so I've got this question about finding the slope of a line passing through two points. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the formula for slope is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). So I need the coordinates of the two points. The points given are (5,4) and (-2,3). 

Wait, let me make sure I get the order right. The formula requires y2 and y1 as the second and first points, right? Or wait, no, actually, it's (y2 - y1) over (x2 - x1), and the order doesn't matter because it's a ratio. So I can pick either point as (x1, y1) and the other as (x2, y2). It doesn't change the slope.

Let me assign (5,4) as the first point, so (x1, y1) = (5,4). The second point is (-2,3), so (x2, y2) = (-2,3). Or maybe it's the other way around. Either way, I'll subtract the y's and the x's.

So plug into the formula: (3 - 4) divided by (-2 - 5). Let me calculate that. 3 minus 4 is -1. And -2 minus 5 is -7. So the slope is -1 divided by -7.

Wait, two negatives would make a positive. So 1/7. Let me check that again. 3-4 is -1, and -2-5 is -7. So (-1)/(-7) is 1/7. So approximately 0.142857.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.14. So that's probably the right answer. Let me double-check if I assigned the points correctly. Suppose I had swapped them. If (5,4) is (x2, y2) and (-2,3) is (x1, y1), then it would be (3-4)/(5- (-2)) = (-1)/(7) = -1/7 again, which is about -0.1428. But since slope can be negative, but the options don't have a negative number. Wait, looking back, the options are all positive. So perhaps the question assumes a positive slope, or I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, the calculation is correct. The slope is 1/7, approximately 0.1428, which is 0.14 when rounded to two decimal places. So the correct answer should be G: 0.14.

The slope of the line through (5,4) and (-2,3) is calculated using the formula (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Substituting the points, we get (3 - 4)/(-2 - 5) = (-1)/(-7) = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428. Rounded to two decimal places, this is 0.14. 

Answer: G: 0.14
