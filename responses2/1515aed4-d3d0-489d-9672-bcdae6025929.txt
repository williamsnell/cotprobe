Okay, so I have this question about patent infringement cases and jury trials. Let me read it carefully and think through what I know.

The question is about a patent holder bringing a patent infringement suit against a licensee in federal court. The holder thinks a jury would be more supportive than a judge, so he asked his lawyer to get a jury trial. The lawyer needs to secure the right to a jury trial, and the options are A to H, each suggesting different times and methods for filing a demand.

Hmm, I remember that in patent law, especially in cases where a patent is infringED, the court often looks at the type of demand they can make. The demand must be in writing, I think. Also, the timing is important. There's a 14-day waiting period before the demand can be served, but I'm not sure if that's the case here or if it's when the demand is filed.

Wait, I recall the PCT Convention and U.S. v. California, which was an important case. In that case, the court held that a jury trial demand must be filed within 14 days after the complaint was served. So the demand must be filed within 14 days after the complaint is served. So looking at the options, option H says "file and serve a jury trial demand within 14 days after the complaint was served." So that seems correct.

Option A says 60 days. That's longer than the 14-day waiting period, so that wouldn't be correct. But wait, there's also a 14-day waiting period before the demand is filed at all. So perhaps the waiting period is 14 days, but the demand itself must be filed within 14 days after that.

Wait, I might be confusing the exact process. Let me think about the steps. The state (or in this case, the federal court) has to serve the complaint within 21 days of the alleged infringement. Then, the demand must be filed within 14 days after that. So the demand can't be filed before 14 days after the complaint date.

Looking at the options, option H is the one that says "within 14 days after the complaint was served." That fits because the demand must be filed 14 days after the complaint is served. So option H is correct.

The other options: option A is 60 days, which is longer than 14, so it's too late. Option B is 30 days, too early. Option C is initial hearing, but the demand must be filed at a later time. Option D is a complaint that includes the demandâ€”maybe that's another approach, but I'm not sure. Option E is a verbal request during the first hearing. I don't think that's correct because demand must be in writing. Option F is a pretrial conference, which is when the initial acquisition of the patent happens, so probably not relevant here. Option G says it's a complaint that includes the demand, which I'm not sure about, but maybe that's not the right approach either.

Wait, another thought: the demand must be filed within 14 days after the complaint is served. So the lawyer must file the demand at that time. So the correct answer is H.

The correct answer is H. The lawyer must file a jury trial demand within 14 days after the complaint was served, as per the relevant legal standards and the PCT Convention.

Answer: H
