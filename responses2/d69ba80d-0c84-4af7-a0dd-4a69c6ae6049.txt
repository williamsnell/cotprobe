Okay, I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the correct answer is. Let's see... The question is asking for the value of this infinite product: 2/π multiplied by the product from k=1 to infinity of (2k)^2 divided by (2k-1)(2k+1). The options are given from A to J, so I'll need to compute the product and then multiply by 2/π to get the result.

First, I should try to understand the product. The product is from k=1 to infinity, and each term is (2k)^2 / [(2k-1)(2k+1)]. Let me rewrite that term:

(2k)^2 = 4k². The denominator is (2k-1)(2k+1). Hmm, wait, (2k-1)(2k+1) is a difference of squares, right? So that would be (2k)^2 - (1)^2, which is 4k² - 1.

So each term simplifies to 4k² divided by (4k² - 1), which can be written as (4k²)/(4k²-1). Alternatively, I can factor numerator and denominator:

4k²/(4k² - 1) = [4k² -1 +1]/(4k² -1) = 1 + 1/(4k² -1). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe partial fractions can be used here?

Wait, let's see: 4k²/(4k²−1) can be written as (4k² -1 +1)/(4k²−1) = 1 + 1/(4k²−1). But perhaps another approach is better. Let me think about partial fractions.

Wait, alternatively, I can write (2k)^2/(2k−1)(2k+1) as (4k²)/(4k²−1). Let's see if this can be expressed as a difference of fractions. Let me assume that (4k²)/(4k²−1) can be written as A/(2k−1) + B/(2k+1). Let's find A and B.

So, 4k²/(4k²−1) = A/(2k−1) + B/(2k+1). Let's combine the right side: [A(2k+1) + B(2k−1)] / (4k²−1).

Set numerator equal: 4k² = A(2k+1) + B(2k−1).

Expanding right side:
= 2A k + A + 2B k - B
= (2A + 2B)k + (A - B).

This must equal 4k². Wait, but the left side is 4k², and the right side is linear in k. That doesn't make sense unless I made a mistake in the assumption. Oh wait, wait, maybe that approach isn't the right way. Alternatively, let me try expressing (4k²)/(4k²−1) as a sum or difference that can telescope when multiplied by 2/π.

Wait, another approach is to write (4k²)/(4k²−1) as 1 + 1/(4k² -1). So the term becomes 1 + 1/(4k² -1). Then the product from k=1 to ∞ of [1 + 1/(4k² -1)].

Wait, but that might not be the best path. Maybe I should consider the infinite product formula for sine or something similar. I know that the sine function has an infinite product representation: sin(πx) = πx ∏_{n=1}^∞ (1 - x²/n²). But the terms here are different.

Wait, let's think about the terms again. Each term is (2k)^2/(2k-1)(2k+1) = [4k²]/(4k² - 1) = 1 + 1/(4k² - 1). Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as something involving sine terms. Let me think about the infinite product for sin(πx):

sin(πx) = πx * ∏_{n=1}^∞ (1 - x²/n²). 

Wait, maybe I can relate that to the product in the problem. Let's see.

The product given is ∏_{k=1}^∞ [4k²/(4k² - 1)] = ∏_{k=1}^∞ [ (4k²) / ( (2k-1)(2k+1) ) ) ].

Wait, another thought: maybe the product can be expressed in terms of sine functions. Let me think about the formula for sin(πx) again. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the product to the Wallis product, which is an infinite product for π/2. Wallis product is (2*2)/(1*3) * (4*4)/(3*5) * ... = π/2. But here, our product is 2/π multiplied by something, but let me see.

Wait, let me compute the product step by step. Let me write down the terms:

For k=1: term is (2*1)^2/(2*1-1)(2*1+1) = 4/(1*3) = 4/3.

k=2: (4)^2/(3*5) = 16/(15).

k=3: (6)^2/(5*7) = 36/35.

k=4: 8²/(7*9) = 64/63.

And so on. So the product is (4/3) * (16/15) * (36/35) * (64/63) * ... 

Hmm, perhaps each term can be written as (4k²)/(4k² -1) = (4k²)/( (2k-1)(2k+1) ). Wait, maybe there's a telescoping product here. Alternatively, perhaps to express each term as a ratio involving terms from adjacent fractions.

Wait, another angle: let me consider the infinite product for sin(πx)/πx. I remember that sin(πx) = πx ∏_{k=1}^∞ (1 - x²/k²). So, 1/(x) sin(πx) = ∏_{k=1}^∞ (1 - x²/k²).

Wait, but in our case, each term is (4k²)/(4k² -1). Let me see if that can be related to 1/(1 - (something)).

Wait, 4k²/(4k² -1) = 1 + 1/(4k² -1) = [ (4k² -1) + 1 ] / (4k² -1) ) = [4k²]/(4k² -1), which again doesn't help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the terms as follows:

(2k)^2/(2k-1)(2k+1) = [4k²]/[4k² -1] = [ (4k² -1) +1 ] / (4k² -1) ) = 1 + 1/(4k² -1).

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as (2k)/(2k-1) * (2k)/(2k+1). Because 4k²/(4k²-1) = [ (2k)(2k) ] / [ (2k-1)(2k+1) ] = [ 2k/(2k-1) ] * [ 2k/(2k+1) ].

So, each term is (2k/(2k-1)) * (2k/(2k+1)).

So the product from k=1 to ∞ becomes [ product (2k/(2k-1)) ] * [ product (2k/(2k+1)) ].

Each of these products is known as the Wallis product for π. Wait, let me think about the Wallis product.

The Wallis product is given by π/2 = (2/1) * (2/3) * (4/3) * (4/5) * (6/5) * (6/7) * ... etc. So, the Wallis product is:

π/2 = ∏_{n=1}^∞ ( (2n)/(2n-1) ) * ( (2n)/(2n+1) ) )

Wait, no, actually, the Wallis formula is [2/1 * 2/3] * [4/3 * 4/5] * [6/5 *6/7] * ... 

Wait, the Wallis formula can be written as (2 * 2)/(1 *3) * (4 *4)/(3 *5) * (6 *6)/(5 *7) * ... which is the same as product from n=1 to ∞ of ( (2n)^2 ) / ( (2n-1)(2n+1) ). Oh wait, that's exactly the product we're dealing with!

So, the product we're computing is exactly the Wallis product formula for π/2. So, the product from k=1 to ∞ of (2k)^2/( (2k-1)(2k+1) ) equals π/2.

Wait, but that can't be right because the Wallis product is known to be equal to π/2. So, the product is π/2.

Wait, but let me confirm: the Wallis product is ∏_{n=1}^∞ ( (2n)^2 / ( (2n-1)(2n+1) )) ) = π/2.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the product in the problem is equal to π/2. So then, the expression given is 2/π multiplied by this product. So:

(2/π) * (π/2) )= (2/π) * (π/2) ) = 1.

Wait, wait a minute. So the entire expression is 2/π multiplied by the product, which is 2/π * (π/2) )= (2 * π) / (π * 2) )= (2π)/(2π) )= 1.

Wait, but that's 1. So the value would be 1. Looking at the options, that's option F: 1.0.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check. Because I thought the infinite product for the Wallis function is π/2. Yes, because the Wallis product is indeed π/2. So, the product is π/2.

So, 2/π multiplied by (π/2) is (2 * π) / (π * 2) )= 1. So the answer should be 1.0, which is option F.
