Question:

After a severe thunderstorm had struck the area, a homeowner discovered that her roof had suffered extensive damage. She telephoned a roofer to inquire about having the necessary repairs done to her roof. The roofer agreed to finish the work within 30 days, and the homeowner promised to pay$10,000. Which of the following statements is most accurate?

Options:

A: The contract would be unenforceable, because it was not written and signed by both parties.
B: The performance of the roofer would be a constructive condition precedent to the performance by the homeowner.
C: The performance by the homeowner would be an implied condition subsequent to the performance by the roofer.
D: The performance by the homeowner would be a constructive condition precedent to the performance by the roofer.
E: The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be constructive concurrent conditions.
F: The contract would be unenforceable, because it was oral.
G: The performance of the roofer would be an implied condition subsequent to the performance by the homeowner.
H: The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be independent conditions.
I: The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be express concurrent conditions.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contracts and conditions precedent. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.

The scenario is a homeowner who had her roof damaged after a severe storm. She called a roofer to fix it. The roofer agreed to finish within 30 days, and the homeowner promised to pay $10,000. The question is about the contract terms.

The question gives multiple options about how the performance of each party relates to the otherâ€”like conditions precedent, subsequent, etc. I need to choose the most accurate statement.

Let me think about what each term means. Condition precedent is something that must be performed before a subsequent performance. So, if you do one thing, you must have done something else first.

In contracts, the parties have certain conditions precedent to each other. For example, a promise to pay must be met before the performance begins. Also, a performance by the other party must have occurred before the performance can continue.

Looking at the options:

A: Unenforceable because not written and signed. Well, contracts can be unenforceable if the law doesn't recognize them, but if both parties have written and signed, it's more about the terms. But the question says the contract was oral, so maybe A isn't correct because the contract wasn't written.

B: Homeowner's performance is constructive pre. to roofer. Wait, the homeowner promised to pay $10,000. If she didn't perform (like not paying), that could be a condition precedent to the work. But in this case, she called the roofer but didn't get a job. So the contract would require the homeowner to perform before the work can be done. So, the homeowner's performance was a condition precedent. So B says the performance by the homeowner was a constructive condition precedent to the roofer's. Hmm.

C: Homeowner's performance is implied subsequent to the roofer. Wait, that's the opposite. If the roofer did the work, the homeowner's performance (paying) would be a condition precedent. So C says the opposite. So C is incorrect.

D: Homeowner's performance is constructive condition precedent to the roofer. No, wait. The correct order is that the homeowner's performance is a condition precedent to the roofer's. So D says it's the opposite, which would make it incorrect.

E: Performances are concurrent. That's when both must be done at the same time. But here, one is the payment, the other is the work. So they can't be concurrent because they're separate actions. So E is wrong.

F: Contract unenforceable because oral. But the contract was oral, but it's still enforceable under contract law if both parties signed paper. Wait, but the question says the homeowners made a verbal promise. So if it's oral, the contract might not be enforceable. But wait, the options are about the terms of the contract, not enforceability. So F says the contract is unenforceable because it was oral. But I'm not sure if that's correct. I think that in some jurisdictions, contracts must be in writing, even if made verbally. But this question is about the contract's terms. So F might not be correct unless the contract was oral and enforceable. But I think the options are about the terms, not enforceability, unless the option directly says that. 

G: Homeowner's performance is implied condition subsequent. No, the homeowner's payment is a condition precedent to the work. So G is incorrect.

H: Performances are independent. That's not right, because they're separate actions. H is wrong.

I: Performances are express concurrent. That's wrong because the performance can't be done at the same time. So I is incorrect.

So the only option that makes sense is B or perhaps A.

Wait, looking again. The question is about the conditions precedent. The homeowners' performance would be a condition precedent to the work. So the correct statement is that the homeowner's performance was a constructive condition precedent to the roofer's.

Wait, but the answer options don't all directly say that. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: Homeowner's performance is constructive condition precedent to the roofer's.

Yes, that's correct. Because the payment is a condition precedent to the work. So B is correct.

Another point: The payment must be made before the work begins. So the payment (homeowner) must be performed before the work (roofer) can be done. So yes, the payment is a condition precedent to the work.
</think>

The correct answer is **B: The performance of the roofer would be a constructive condition precedent to the performance by the homeowner.**

This is because the homeowner's promise to pay $10,000 must be completed before the roof can be repaired, making the payment a condition precedent to the work. The other options either misrepresent the relationship between the parties' actions or are incorrect in their implications.
