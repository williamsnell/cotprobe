Okay, so I've got this question here about the maximum value of the z-component of the spin angular momentum of 43Ca. The isotope has an I (moment of inertia) of 7/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Wait, angular momentum in quantum mechanics... Oh right, spin angular momentum is quantized. The formula for the maximum value of the z-component, I think, is given by m times ħ. But wait, sometimes it's expressed in terms of I. Oh, right, because the spin angular momentum S is related to I. The relationship is S = I * ω? No, wait, actually, the spin angular momentum is S = I * ω, and ω is related to the frequency of the rotation. But wait, for a particle like an electron, S is given by ħ times the spin quantum number s.

Wait, but wait. Oh, right. The spin angular momentum quantum number is s, and the maximum z-component is m_s times ħ. But wait, wait, I think in the case of a particle with spin I, the maximum m value is I. Oh wait, wait, wait. No, wait. I think I'm confusing with orbital angular momentum. For spin, the maximum m_s value is equal to the spin quantum number. So for 43Ca, I think the isotope is calcium, and calcium has an atomic number of 20. But wait, the isotope 43Ca would have a spin? Or wait, wait, I think the isotope here is 43Ca, which has an atomic number of 20. Wait, but the isotope's spin? Oh wait, 43Ca is neutral, so it's ^78Ca? Or wait, wait, 43Ca is actually the isotope with 20 protons, 20 neutrons, and mass number 43. So that's ^20Ca, no. Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, wait: Ca has atomic number 20, so 43Ca would be ^43Ca. Wait, the number of protons is 20, neutrons would be 43-20=23. So, 43Ca is ^43Ca, but its isotope has I=7/2. Oh, wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Wait, I think the isotope here is 43Ca, which has an atomic number of 20, so it has 20 protons. The mass number is 43, so the number of neutrons is 43-20=23. But wait, the spin I is given as 7/2. Wait, wait, I thought that the spin quantum number s is related to I. Oh, wait, wait. The spin angular momentum quantum number is s, and the maximum z-component is m_s times ħ. But wait, wait, for a spin I, the possible m values are from -I to +I in integer steps. So, when I is 7/2, the maximum possible m is 7/2. So the maximum z-component S_z would be (7/2) * ħ.

Wait, but wait, I think in the question, the spin is 7/2, but I is the spin quantum number. Wait, no, the problem states I =7/2. Oh, right, so I is the spin quantum number, and for that, the maximum m is I.

Wait, but wait, wait, no, wait. No, wait, the spin quantum number s is different from I. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up notation. Let me clarify: the spin angular momentum quantum number is s, and for a particle with spin I, the maximum m is I.

Wait, wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. The spin angular momentum quantum number is s, and s can be a half-integer. For atoms like Ca, the spin I is actually 1/2, which for electrons is s=1/2. But wait, wait, no. Wait, for electrons, spin I is 1/2, so m_I can be +1/2 or -1/2. But for other particles, like some nuclei or isotopes, the spin I could be larger. For example, for a nucleus with spin I, m_I can range from -I to +I, in integer steps.

So back to the question: 43Ca is ^20Ca, but it's 43Ca, which I think would have 20 protons and 23 neutrons. However, the question says I=7/2. Wait, that doesn't make sense for Ca. Wait, maybe I'm getting the isotopes and their spin mixed up. Oh wait, perhaps I'm supposed to think about a nucleus with spin I=7/2. Because the problem says 43Ca, which is ^43Ca, but maybe that's a typo and the actual spin is 7/2. Alternatively, perhaps the isotope 43Ca actually has a spin of 7/2. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the question is about the maximum value of the z-component of the spin angular momentum. So, regardless of the isotope, the formula is: S_z = m * ħ, where m is the maximum possible value. For a spin I, the maximum m is I. So S_z max = I * ħ.

Wait, but wait, if I is 7/2, then I * ħ is (7/2) * ħ. The value of ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So let's compute that.

Wait, but wait, the question gives options in terms of 1e-34 J s, so the calculation would be (7/2) * 1.0545718e-34 J s.

Wait, let's compute that. (7/2) is 3.5. 3.5 * 1.0545718e-34.

3.5 * 1e-34 is 3.5e-34. 0.0545718e-34 is approximately 5.45718e-36. So adding together, 3.5e-34 + 5.457e-36 = 3.55457e-34 J s. But wait, none of the options seem to match that. The options are all 1e-34 scale, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting I. Wait, the problem says I =7/2. So I is 3.5. So S_z max is 3.5 * ħ.

Wait, let's compute 3.5 multiplied by 1.05457e-34.

3.5 * 1.05457e-34 = ?

Wait, 3.5 *1e-34 =3.5e-34. 0.05457e-34 is 5.457e-36. So adding them:3.5e-34 +5.457e-36 = approx 3.55457e-34. But the question's options are much lower, like 10^-34 J s. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait a second. Oh, wait, maybe I is the spin quantum number, not the spin I, which is different. Wait, in nuclear spin, sometimes I is the spin number. For example, for a nucleus with spin I=7/2, the maximum m would be I=3.5.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a confusion with the notation. So in the problem statement, the isotope is given as ^20Ca, so perhaps the spin is not 7/2. Hmm, so perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to ignore the isotope and just compute it based on I=7/2.

Wait, but 7/2 is 3.5, and if the maximum m is 3.5, then S_z = 3.5 * ħ. Let's compute that.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

3.5 * 1.0545718e-34 = 3.691e-34 J s.

Wait, but that's option J:7.123e-34 J s. Hmm, no. Oh wait, no, 3.5 * 1.05457e-34 is approximately 3.5 * 1e-34 = 3.5e-34. 3.5e-34 is 3.5 *1e-34. Oh wait, but wait, 3.5 is 7/2. So 7/2 * ħ = (7/2) * 1.05457e-34 = 3.691e-34 J s. So that would correspond to option J, which is 7.123e-34, which is higher.

Wait, but none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps I'm considering the wrong quantum number. Alternatively, perhaps the spin quantum number is s = 7/2, and the maximum m is s = 7/2, so S_z = (7/2) * ħ. Which is again 3.5 * 1.054e-34 which is 3.69e-34. But none of the options are that.

Looking at the options, the highest is option F:8.370e-34. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating ħ. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s, correct. So 7/2 * 1.05457e-34 = (3.5) * 1.05457e-34.

Let me compute that more accurately. 3.5 * 1.0545718e-34:

3.5 * 1.0545718 = let's compute this.

1.0545718 *3 = 3.1637154,  1.0545718 *0.5=0.5272859. Sum is 3.1637154+0.5272859 = 3.6910013.

So 3.6910013e-34 J·s. So that would be 3.691e-34.

Looking at the options, option J is 7.123e-34. Hmm, so that's about double the value I'm getting. So maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the spin quantum number s with the spin I. Wait, no, for an electron, s is 1/2, and I is 1/2. So for a nucleus with spin I=7/2, the maximum m is 7/2, so S_z = (7/2) * ħ.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the question is about the maximum possible value of the z-component, but in another context. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm missing the fact that the spin angular momentum for a nucleus is given by I * ħ, where I is the spin quantum number. So I is 7/2, so m is 7/2. So S_z max is (7/2) * 1.05457e-34 = 3.5 * 1.05457e-34 = 3.691e-34 J s. But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the units are different. Oh wait, looking at the options, all are in 1e-34, so perhaps I'm supposed to express it in terms of ħ. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is for s=7/2, not I.

Wait, no, I think I is the spin quantum number, so I is 7/2. So m is 7/2. So the maximum S_z is 7/2 * ħ, which is 3.5 * ħ.

Wait, but let's compute 3.5 * 1.05457e-34.

3.5 * 1.05457e-34 = 3.691e-34 J s. Looking at the options, the highest is option F:8.370e-34 J s.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2. Oh, wait, did I perhaps confuse spin with orbital angular momentum? No, because the question is about the spin angular momentum.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the spin angular momentum is given by S = (h/(2π)) * m_s, where m_s is the spin multiplicity. No, wait, S is in terms of ħ.

Wait, perhaps the spin quantum number s is 7/2. So S_z maximum is (7/2) * ħ. So same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the magnetic moment, but that's not the case. The question is about the maximum z-component of the spin angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating 7/2. Let's double-check: 7/2 is 3.5. So 3.5 * 1.05457e-34 = 3.691e-34.

Looking at the options:

A: 10.492e-34

B:2.549e-34

C:5.493e-34

D:4.185e-34

E:1.238e-34

F:8.370e-34

G:6.234e-34

H:9.854e-34

I:3.691e-34

J:7.123e-34

Wait, option I is 3.691e-34, which matches exactly what I calculated. So the maximum value is option I.

The question asks for the maximum value of the z-component of the spin angular momentum of \(^{43}\text{Ca}\), given that the spin quantum number \(I = \frac{7}{2}\). The maximum value of the z-component of the spin angular momentum is given by \(S_z = m_s \cdot \hbar\), where \(m_s\) is the spin multiplicity. For a particle with spin \(I\), the maximum \(m_s\) is \(I\). Therefore, the maximum \(S_z\) is \(I \cdot \hbar\), where \(\hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\).

Substituting \(I = \frac{7}{2}\), the calculation becomes:

\[
S_z = \frac{7}{2} \cdot 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} = 3.5 \cdot 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}.
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
3.5 \cdot 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} = 3.691 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}.
\]

This matches option I, which is \(3.691 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\). Other options do not align with this calculation.
