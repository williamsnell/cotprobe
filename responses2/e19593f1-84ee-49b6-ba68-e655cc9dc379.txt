Okay, so I have this problem about functions and their periodicity, I think. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step.

The problem says that the graph of a function y = f(x) is such that if it's shifted 20 units to the right, it looks the same as before. So, that means the function is periodic with a period of 20. In other words, f(x) = f(x + 20) for all x. That part I get.

Now, the question is asking for the smallest positive a such that if we take the graph of y = f(x/5) and shift it a units to the right, it's identical to the original graph. So, I need to find the smallest a where f((x/a)/5) is the same as f(x/5). Hmm, wait, maybe I should think about how the function transforms when we change x to x/5.

Let me rewrite the transformed function. If we substitute x with x/a, then the new function becomes y = f((x/a)/5) = f(x/(5a)). So, the transformed function is f(x/(5a)). We want this transformed function to be identical to the original f(x/5). That means:

f(x/(5a)) = f(x/5) for all x.

Since f is periodic with period 20, that means f(u) = f(u + 20) for all u. So, let's set u = x/(5a). Then,

f(u) = f(u + 20)  
=> f(x/(5a)) = f(x/(5a) + 20)

But we also have f(x/(5a)) = f(x/5). So,

f(x/5) = f(x/(5a) + 20)

This suggests that shifting the argument of f by 20 will result in the same function, so the period of f is related to 20.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Since f has period 20, f(x + 20) = f(x). What's the period of f(x/5)?

Let me consider the function g(x) = f(x/5). If I can find the period of g, that would give me the smallest a such that shifting g(x) by a units to the right results in the same function.

For g(x) = f(x/5), let's see how shifting affects it. If I shift g(x) by a units to the right, I get g(x - a) = f((x - a)/5) = f(x/5 - a/5) = g(x) shifted by a/5 units. Wait, no, actually, shifting a units right is g(x - a) = f((x - a)/5) = f(x/5 - a/5). So, that's not exactly the same as shifting the original g(x) by a units unless a/5 is a period of f.

Since the period of f is 20, then f(x) = f(x + 20). So, f(x/5) = f((x/5 + T)), where T is the period of f. Wait, no, actually, the function f has period 20, so f(x) = f(x + 20). Therefore, for g(x) = f(x/5), we have:

g(x + a) = f((x + a)/5) = f(x/5 + a/5)  
We need g(x + a) = g(x) = f(x/5). So,

f(x/5 + a/5) = f(x/5) for all x.

This means that a/5 must be a period of f. Since the fundamental period of f is 20, a/5 must be a multiple of 20. Therefore, the smallest a is when a/5 = 20, so a = 20 * 5 = 100. Wait, but the options don't include 100. Hmm, let me double-check my reasoning.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The function g(x) = f(x/5) has a period T such that g(x + T) = g(x). So,

g(x + T) = f((x + T)/5) = f(x/5 + T/5)  
But we want this to equal g(x) = f(x/5). Therefore,

f(x/5 + T/5) = f(x/5) for all x.

This implies that T/5 must be a period of f, right? So, the smallest T/5 is the period of f, which is 20. Therefore, T/5 = 20 => T = 100. So, the period of g(x) is 100. Therefore, the smallest a is 100. But wait, the options don't have 100. The options are A:50, B:15, C:5, D:30, E:10, F:200, G:100, H:25, I:20, J:4.

So, G is 100. So, the answer would be G:100. But wait, let me check if there's a smaller a that would work. Maybe if the period is smaller? Wait, no, because 20 is the fundamental period. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: Since f has period 20, f(x) = f(x + 20). So, for the function g(x) = f(x/5), let's compute g(x + a) and set it equal to g(x):

g(x + a) = f((x + a)/5) = f(x/5 + a/5)  
We need this equal to f(x/5), so f(x/5 + a/5) = f(x/5) for all x.

So, the argument x/5 + a/5 must differ by a multiple of the period 20. So, a/5 must be a multiple of 20. Therefore, a/5 = 20k, where k is integer. The smallest positive a is when k=1, so a=100. So, the smallest a is 100, which is option G.

Wait a second, but the options include G as 100, so that should be the answer. Wait, let me check again. If I shift g(x) by a=100, then:

g(x + 100) = f((x + 100)/5) = f(x/5 + 20). Since f has period 20, f(x/5 + 20) = f(x/5). So, yes, that works. So, the smallest a is 100.

Therefore, the correct answer is G:100.

To determine the smallest positive \( a \) such that shifting the graph of \( y = f\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) \) by \( a \) units to the right results in the same graph, we analyze the periodicity of \( f \). Since \( f(x) \) has a period of 20, \( f(x + 20) = f(x) \) for all \( x \). For \( g(x) = f\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) \), we need \( g(x + a) = g(x) \), which implies \( f\left(\frac{x + a}{5}\right) = f\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) \). This requires \( \frac{a}{5} \) to be a period of \( f \), the smallest of which is 20. Thus, \( \frac{a}{5} = 20 \) gives \( a = 100 \).

The answer is **G:100**.
