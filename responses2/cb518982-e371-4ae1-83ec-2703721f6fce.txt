Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about mathematical concepts, specifically about continuity and differentiability. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2. The options are combinations of True, False, or Not applicable. Hmm, I need to evaluate each statement and see if they're true or false.

Starting with Statement 1: "f : X → Y is continuous and X is compact. f must be uniformly continuous." I remember that compactness is a crucial property in topology and analysis. Compactness in metric spaces, especially, means that every open cover has a finite subcover. Now, continuity on a compact space. Wait, I think there's a theorem about this. Oh right, if a function is continuous on a compact metric space, then it's uniformly continuous. Because compactness ensures that the function behaves nicely across the entire space without wild oscillations. So this statement should be True.

Moving on to Statement 2: "If f(x), g(x) : R → R are everywhere differentiable, then their composition f(g(x)) is everywhere differentiable." Differentiable functions have continuous derivatives, right? So if both f and g are differentiable everywhere, their composition should also be differentiable everywhere, because the chain rule applies. The chain rule says that the derivative of f(g(x)) is f’(g(x)) * g’(x). Since both f’ and g’ exist everywhere, their product is also defined everywhere. So statement 2 should also be True.

So, putting it together, both statements are true. Looking at the options, option J says True, True. So the correct answer should be J.

The analysis of the two statements leads to both being true, so the correct option is J.

Answer: J
