Okay, so I have this problem here where the ratio of (2x - y) to (x + y) is 2 to 3. I need to find the ratio of x to y as a common fraction. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that when a ratio is given, you can set up an equation by equating the two parts of the ratio to each other. So in this case, (2x - y)/(x + y) equals 2/3. That makes sense because the ratio is (2x - y) to (x + y) being 2:3.

Alright, so let me write that down:

(2x - y)/(x + y) = 2/3

Now, I need to solve for x/y. To do that, I'll first cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions. Multiply both sides by (x + y) and by 3 to get rid of the denominators.

3*(2x - y) = 2*(x + y)

Let me expand both sides:

3*2x = 6x
3*(-y) = -3y
Similarly, 2*x=2x and 2*y=2y.

So putting it together:

6x - 3y = 2x + 2y

Now, I can move all terms to one side to group like terms. Let me subtract 2x and add 3y to both sides:

6x - 2x = 2y + 3y
Which simplifies to:

4x = 5y

Now, I need the ratio of x to y, so I can write x/y = 4/5.

Wait, but I'm supposed to express the ratio as a common fraction. So 4/5 is already a common fraction. Looking at the options, option I is 4/5. So the answer should be I.

Let me double-check my steps. I set up the ratio correctly, cross-multiplied, expanded, and simplified. Yep, seems right. So x/y is 4/5.

The given ratio can be expressed as an equation:

\[
\frac{2x - y}{x + y} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
3(2x - y) = 2(x + y)
\]

Expanding both sides:

\[
6x - 3y = 2x + 2y
\]

Subtract \(2x\) and add \(3y\) to both sides:

\[
4x = 5y
\]

Thus, the ratio \( \frac{x}{y} \) is:

\[
\frac{4}{5}
\]
