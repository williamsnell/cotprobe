Okay, so I've got this question about a Poisson process. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Poisson processes, but I'll try to think it through step by step. 

The question says: Let N(t), t from 0 to infinity, be a Poisson process with rate λ = 0.5. We need to find the probability of no arrivals in the interval [3, 5). The options are given from A to J, all various numbers.

Wait, Poisson processes have the property that the number of events (arrivals, in this case) in any interval of length t follows a Poisson distribution. The formula for the probability of k arrivals in time t is P(k) = (e^{-λt} * (λt)^k) / k!.

But here, we're looking for the probability of no arrivals, so k is 0. So the probability would be P(0) = e^{-λt} * (λt)^0 / 0! = e^{-λt}.

Right, because (λt)^0 is 1 and 0! is 1.

Now, what's the length of the interval? It's from 3 to 5, so that's 2 units of time. So t = 5 - 3 = 2.

So λt is 0.5 * 2 = 1.0.

So the probability is e^{-1.0}. What's e to the power of -1? I remember that e is approximately 2.71828, so e^-1 is about 0.3679.

Looking at the options, I see option I is 0.60, option H is 0.37, which is close. Wait, but 0.3679 is approximately 0.37. So the closest option is H) 0.37.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check. It's possible I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute e^{-1} more accurately. e^-1 is approximately 0.36787944117..., so about 0.3679, which rounds to 0.37. So the correct answer should be H.

The probability of no arrivals in the interval [3, 5) for a Poisson process with rate λ = 0.5 is calculated as:

The interval length is 2, so t = 2. The number of arrivals follows a Poisson distribution with parameter λt = 0.5 * 2 = 1.0. The probability of no arrivals (k = 0) is:

P(0) = e^{-λt} = e^{-1} ≈ 0.3679 ≈ 0.37.

The closest option is H) 0.37.

Answer: H
