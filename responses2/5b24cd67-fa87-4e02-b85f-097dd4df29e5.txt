Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find out how many 7-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when you have to count permutations of a set of items where some are identical, you use the formula for permutations of multiset. The formula is n! divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each repeated element. 

In this case, the digits are 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3. So, let's break it down. The digit 1 appears once, the digit 2 appears twice, and the digit 3 appears four times. 

So, the total number of digits is 7 (1+2+4=7). The formula would be 7! divided by (2! * 4!). Let me calculate that.

7! is 7×6×5×4×3×2×1 = 5040. 2! is 2×1=2, and 4! is 24. Multiplying those together: 2 * 24 = 48. Now, 5040 divided by 48. Let me do that division: 5040 ÷ 48. Hmm, 48 times 100 is 4800, which is less than 5040. 48 * 105 is 5040 because 48*100=4800, plus 48*5=240, which totals 5040. So 5040 / 48 = 105.

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, no, 48 * 105 is indeed 5040. So the calculation is right. So the number is 105. 

Looking back at the options provided, option C is 105. So that should be the correct answer. 

I don't see any mistakes here. Another way to think about it: if all digits were unique, it would be 7! = 5040. But since there are duplicates, we divide by the factorials of the duplicates. So yes, 7! / (2! *4!) = 105. That makes sense. So option C is correct.

The problem involves calculating the number of unique 7-digit numbers using the digits 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3. We use the formula for permutations of a multiset: 7! / (2! * 4!) = 105. 

Answer: C: 105
