Alright, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the maximum possible order of an element in the group Z_8 x Z_10 x Z_24. The options are various numbers, and I'm supposed to pick the correct one. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that for a finite abelian group, the maximum order of an element is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of the factors. But wait, that's probably for cyclic groups, right? Oh wait, no, wait—I think in abelian groups, especially finite ones, the maximum order of an element is indeed the LCM of the orders of each individual component. But wait, does that apply here? Let me make sure. 

Each of Z_8, Z_10, and Z_24 is a cyclic group, because every cyclic group is abelian, and the direct product of cyclic groups is abelian. So, the group Z_8 × Z_10 × Z_24 is an abelian group. The theorem I remember is that in an abelian group, the maximum order of an element is the LCM of the orders of the cyclic factors. So, I think that's correct.

So, the LCM of 8, 10, and 24. Let's compute that. 

Breaking them down into prime factors:
- 8 is 2^3.
- 10 is 2 × 5.
- 24 is 2^3 × 3.

To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime present. So, for 2: the highest power is 2^3 (from 8 and 24). For 3: it's 3^1 (from 24). For 5: it's 5^1 (from 10). So, LCM = 2^3 × 3 × 5 = 8 × 15 = 120.

Wait, so the maximum order is 120. Looking at the options, option F is 120. So the answer should be F.

But wait, another thought: is there a case where the order could be higher? Because sometimes, when the group isn't cyclic, the maximum order might be the LCM, but in this case, since each factor is cyclic, the LCM should be correct. 

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the structure of the group. The group Z_8 x Z_10 x Z_24 can be broken down into its primary components. Let me try to see if that helps.

Express each component as a product of cyclic groups of prime power order.

Wait, but each of them is already a cyclic group, so the direct product is their combination. So, the order of an element would be the LCM of the orders in each component, which we've calculated as 120.

Therefore, the maximum order is 120. So the correct answer is F.

The maximum possible order of an element in the group \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \times \mathbb{Z}_{10} \times \mathbb{Z}_{24} \) is found by computing the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of the individual components. The LCM of 8, 10, and 24 is 120. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F: 120
