Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the first groups of animals that developed lung tissue to support their respiratory needs without using supplementary gas exchange organs. Hmm, I remember that gas exchange organs are like the lungs, right? So the question is asking which group of animals first had their lungs developed in this way.

Wait, I think mammals, including humans, developed lungs first. Like, frogs, reptiles, birds, mammals, etc. But the options include various groups like arachnids, which are arachnids, mammals, etc. So the first group was probably mammals because they were the earliest to develop lungs. Because before mammals, there were other groups like insects, birds, reptiles. For example, frogs and insects had lungs too but was it the mammals that first developed them? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh wait, I think the first mammals were mammals, so mammals (option B) would be the answer. But wait, the options include trematoda, amphibians, and mollusks. Oh, trematoda are a group that includes mammals, like frogs and reptiles. Amphibians are birds and mammals. Mollusks are fish and crustaceans. So the first group was mammals, so B is the answer. But wait, I'm not sure if other groups like birds had lungs first. Maybe it's mammals. Alternatively, I think the first class was mammals, so the answer is B.
