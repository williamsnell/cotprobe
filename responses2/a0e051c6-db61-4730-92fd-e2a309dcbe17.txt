Okay, so George and Richard are partners in a law firm. They pay $6300 in annual rent. When their lease expires, the new rent will be $715 per month. I need to find out what percentage increase they will be paying. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I think I need to find the increase in their rent. The old annual rent is $6300, and the new is $715 per month. Wait, do I need to calculate the new annual rent and then find the percentage increase?

Right, so first step: calculate the new annual rent. Since it's $715 per month, multiplying by 12 months gives the annual amount. Let me do that: 715 * 12. Let me see, 700*12 is 8400, and 15*12 is 180, so total is 8580. So the new annual rent is $8580.

Wait, no—that's incorrect. Wait, 715 times 12: let me compute it properly. 700*12 is 8400, 15*12 is 180, so 8400 +180= 8580. Yes, correct. So the new annual rent is $8580.

Wait, but the old was $6300. So the increase is 8580 -6300. Let's calculate that. 8580 minus 6300: 8580-6000 is 2580, then subtract 300 more, which is 2280. So the increase is $2280.

Now, to find the percentage increase, I think I need to divide the increase by the original amount and multiply by 100. So that's 2280 /6300 *100.

Let me compute that. 2280 divided by 6300. Hmm, I can simplify this fraction. Let's see, both numbers are divisible by 6. 2280 ÷6 is 380, and 6300 ÷6 is 1050. So now it's 380/1050.

Wait, can I simplify this further? Let's see, both divided by 10: 38/105. Hmm, 38 and 105. Do they have any common factors? 38 is 2*19, and 105 is 3*5*7. No common factors, so 38/105 is the simplified fraction.

Now, 38 divided by 105. Let me compute this. Let me do 38 ÷ 105. Well, 105 goes into 38 zero times. Add a decimal point. 105 into 380. 3 times 105 is 315. 380-315 is 65. Bring down a zero: 650. 105*6=630. So subtract, 20. Bring down another zero: 200. 105*1=105. 200-105=95. Bring down zero: 950. 105*9=945. 950-945=5. So far, I have 0.36190... So approximately 0.3619, which is about 36.19%.

Wait, but that's the decimal. So the percentage is approximately 36.19%, which is about 36.2%. Looking at the options, option J is 36%, which is the closest.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake. Let me recalculate 2280 /6300.

Another approach: 6300 * 0.36 is 6300 *0.3 = 1890, 6300 *0.06=378. 1890+378=2268. So 6300*0.36=2268. The increase is 2280. So 0.36 gives 2268, which is 12 less than 2280. So 0.36 is 2268, so 2280 is 2268 +12. So 12 is 12/6300, which is 0.00190476... So 0.36 +0.0019=0.3619. So about 36.19%, which is approximately 36.2%. So the correct percentage is approximately 36.2%, which is option J (36%).

Wait, but wait another thing: is the calculation for the new rent correct? Let me recheck. The new rent is $715 per month. So 715 *12 = 8580. Original is 6300. Difference is 2280. So 2280 /6300 is the percentage increase.

Another way to calculate percentage increase is ((New - Original)/Original) *100. So that's (8580-6300)/6300 *100 = 2280/6300 *100.

Wait, 2280/6300: Let me compute 2280 ÷ 6300.

Divide numerator and denominator by 60: 2280 ÷60=38, 6300 ÷60=105. So 38/105.

38 divided by 105: Let's compute 105 *0.36=37.8, as I did earlier. 0.36 is 37.8. 38 is 0.2 more than 37.8. 0.2 /105 = 0.00190476. So 0.36 + 0.00190476=0.36190476. So 36.19%.

So 36.19% is the correct percentage increase. Looking at the options, option J is 36%. So the answer should be J.
