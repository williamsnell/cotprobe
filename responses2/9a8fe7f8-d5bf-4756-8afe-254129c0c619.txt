Okay, so I have to answer this question about how changes in income taxes and sales taxes affect national income. Let me try to break this down. 

The question says that households consume 85% of their disposable income. So, disposable income is after taxes. And both income and sales tax are being increased by 4%. The initial tax rate is 20%, but I guess that's the part that's not being changed. Wait, no, the part that's being changed is the tax rates, not the initial rates. Or wait, the initial tax rate is 20% in both cases. So the tax rates are being increased by 4% each. So the new tax rates would be 24% for both income and sales taxes.

Hmm. Wait, I think I need to clarify: the initial tax rate is 20%, so for each, the tax rate is 20% plus 4% increase. So 24% for both.

So the problem is about how these taxes affect national income. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas, but I remember something about how taxes can distort income when they're not progressive, but I'm not sure. 

Let me think about the effect of each tax on disposable income. If both taxes are increased by the same percentage, how does that impact the household's disposable income?

Households consume 85%, so they spend 85% of their disposable income. So, their spending (C) is 0.85 multiplied by their disposable income (Yd). Disposable income is after taxes, so Yd = Y - taxes.

Wait, taxes are the two sources here: income tax and sales tax. So if both rates go up by 4%, each tax would be applied to the same Y. Let's model this.

Let’s denote:

Initial tax rate: 20% (t = 0.20)
After 4% increase: t_new = 0.24

Disposable income (Yd) = Y - (taxes) = Y - (t*Y + s*Y) = Y*(1 - t - s) 

Wait, but in the question, are both income and sales taxes being increased by 4%? I think so. So each of these taxes is applied to the same Y. So for each, the tax is 24% of Y.

So, Yd = Y - (24% of Y) = Y*(1 - 0.24) = Y*0.76

So disposable income is 76% of the original Y.

Now, spending is 85% of Yd, so C = 0.85 * Yd = 0.85 * 0.76 * Y ≈ 0.646 Y.

So, saving is the remaining part of Yd. Wait, no: in the model, Y = C + S. So S is 15.4% of Yd.

Wait, let me get this right: if Yd = Y*(1 - t - s), then C = 0.85 * Yd, so S = Yd - C = 0.15 * Yd.

So substituting Yd, S = 0.15 * Y*(1 - t - s).

So S = 0.15 * Y*(1 - 0.24) = 0.15 * Y * 0.76 = 0.114 Y.

Wait, that's if both taxes are 24% each. So in the original scenario, before tax increases, what was the situation? Let's see.

Wait, the initial tax rate is 20%, so t = 0.20. So Yd in the absence of tax increases would be Y*(1 - 0.20) = 0.80 Y. Then spending would be 0.85 * 0.80 Y = 0.68 Y. So saving is 0.32 Y.

After the tax increases, each tax is 0.24. So Yd is 0.76 Y. Then spending is 0.85 * 0.76 Y = 0.646 Y. Saving is 0.354 Y.

So the saving increases from 0.32 to 0.354 Y, which is an increase of approximately 1.111 Y. So the saving has gone up by about 11.11% of Y. But how does that affect national income?

Wait, the national income Y is the sum of consumption and saving. So Y = C + S.

In the original scenario (taxes at 20%):
C = 0.85 * (0.80 Y) = 0.68 Y
S = 0.32 Y
Y = 0.68 + 0.32 = 1.00 Y, which checks out.

After tax increase (taxes at 24%):
C = 0.85 * 0.76 Y = 0.646 Y
S = 0.354 Y
So Y = 0.646 + 0.354 = 1.00 Y again. Correct.

So the national income Y remains the same. Because the increase in saving is exactly offset by the decrease in consumption. So the increase in saving (0.354 Y) is added to the existing 0.32 Y, making Y = 0.68 +0.354 = 1.00 Y.

Wait, but that's only if Y increases. Wait, wait, no, because in this model, 0.354 Y + 0.646 Y is 1.0 Y. So Y remains unchanged.

So in the first scenario, where taxes are increased by 4%, the national income remains the same. So the effect is zero change.

Wait, but the question is about the effect on national income. So if both taxes are increased by 4%, then national income remains the same. So looking at the options:

Option A: Income is unaffected by changes in tax. That would be correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because in a more detailed model, perhaps the way the taxes are structured might affect this. For example, if the tax system is progressive, then the effect would be different. But the problem says that households consume 85% of their disposable income. So that's a fixed ratio. As long as the disposable income is the same, the saving and consumption will remain the same.

Wait, but wait another thought. Let's model it more precisely. Let's think about the impact on national income.

Let’s denote:

Y = national income

Taxes are T = t + s, where t is income tax rate, s is sales tax rate.

So Yd = Y*(1 - T).

C = 0.85 * Yd = 0.85 Y*(1-T).

S = Yd - C = Y*(1-T) - 0.85 Y*(1-T) = Y*(1-T)*(1-0.85) = Y*(1-T)*0.15.

So S = 0.15 Y (1-T).

Then, national income Y = C + S.

Substituting, Y = 0.85 Y (1-T) + 0.15 Y (1-T).

Y = Y (1-T) [0.85 + 0.15] = Y (1-T) * 1 = Y.

So Y remains the same, regardless of T. Because the calculation simplifies to Y=Y.

So the effect of increasing taxes by 4% is that national income remains unchanged.

Therefore, in both scenarios (tax rates at 24% or 24% for each), national income doesn't change.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where income remains the same, but let's check. Looking at the options:

Option A says income is unaffected by changes in tax. So in our case, both taxes increased by 4%, so national income remains the same. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, the initial tax rate is 20%, so in the problem statement, when it increases by 4%, each tax rate goes up to 24%.

Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option A says income remains unaffected by changes in tax. So that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B: falls by 3.4% with income tax, falls by 6.8% with sales tax.

Wait, but according to the calculation, national income doesn't change. So B, C, D, etc., say changes, but the correct option is A.

But wait, wait. Let me make sure. Did I model this correctly?

Because another way to think about it: perhaps the effect is different if taxes are applied in a way that the sum of the taxes is T = t + s, but each is calculated on Y. So in this case, the calculation I did earlier leads to national income not changing.

But I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes when taxes are structured differently, like if they're progressive, the effect could be different. But the problem states that households always consume 85% of their disposable income, regardless of the tax rates. So in this model, the effect is that national income remains the same.

So the correct answer would be option A: Income is unaffected by changes in tax.

The question examines the impact of increasing income and sales taxes by 4% on national income, given that households consume 85% of their disposable income. Disposable income (Yd) is calculated as Y - taxes, and savings (S) is the portion of disposable income not consumed. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Household Spending**: Households spend 85% of their disposable income, so savings (S) = 15% of Yd.
2. **Disposable Income**: Yd = Y - (t + s)Y, where t and s are the income and sales tax rates, respectively.
3. **Effect of Tax Increase**: Both income and sales taxes increase by 4%, making the total tax rate T = 24%.
4. **National Income Calculation**: 
   - Yd = Y - 24%Y = 76% of Y.
   - Spending (C) = 85% of Yd = 85% * 76% = 64.6% of Y.
   - Savings (S) = 15% of Yd = 15% * 76% = 11.4% of Y.
   - National income (Y = C + S) = 64.6% + 11.4% = 76% of Y + 24% of Y = 100% of Y, meaning national income remains unchanged.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Income remains unaffected by changes in tax. This is correct, as the model shows national income does not change.
- **Option B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J**: These options suggest changes in national income, which contradicts the calculation that national income remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is that national income remains unaffected by changes in tax rates.
