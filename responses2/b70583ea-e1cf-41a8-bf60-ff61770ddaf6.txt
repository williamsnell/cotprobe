The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A patient in a hospital was placed in a wheelchair with his broken leg extended straight out in front of him. As a nurse employed by the hospital was pushing the wheelchair through a set of automatic doors at a normal pace, the doors closed on the patient's foot, injuring it. The nurse attempted to pull the wheelchair back through the doors. This action caused the doors to close more tightly on the patient's foot, injuring it further. The patient sued the hospital, alleging improper maintenance of the doors. The patient has produced no evidence of specific conduct or neglect on the part of the hospital that would have caused the automatic doors to malfunction. The hospital has moved for summary judgment. Should the court grant the hospital's motion?

Options:

A: Yes, because the patient has not provided any evidence to prove that the hospital was responsible for the malfunctioning doors.
B: No, because the hospital has a duty to ensure the safety of all its patients and failed to do so in this case.
C: Yes, because the hospital was not aware of any defects in the doors.
D: Yes, because proof of an accident, by itself, does not establish that an injured person was a victim of negligence.
E: Yes, because the nurse's action was a superseding cause of the injury. 
F: No, because a jury could find that there was a latent defect in the doors.
G: No, because a jury could find the hospital liable for negligence based on res ipsa loquitur.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the hospital should be granted a summary judgment in this case. The patient's foot is injured by doors closing on him, and the hospital moved for summary judgment because the doors malfunctioned and the patient didn't provide evidence of negligence.

Hmm, let's break this down. Summary judgment is typically granted when there's no evidence of the other party's liability, or when the other party has failed to meet their burden of proof. But the question is about negligence, not just liability for damages.

The hospital claims that the doors were malfunctioning due to improper maintenance. But the patient hasn't provided evidence of negligence. Wait, the hospital has a duty to ensure patient safety, but the patient hasn't shown that the doors were improperly maintained. So, does the hospital's lack of evidence negate their duty?

I remember that in some cases, even if the duty isn't met, the plaintiff can still recover if the facts show that the plaintiff was a victim of negligence. Or when a plaintiff can prove that the defendant's negligence caused the injury, and the plaintiff hasn't shown that the defendant was negligent.

So the patient didn't prove negligence, but they're suing. So the question is whether the lack of negligence proves the plaintiff's case. Since the hospital's duty to ensure patient safety is a standard of care, and the patient hasn't provided evidence of negligence, the hospital's claim that the doors were improperly maintained might not be enough to establish negligence.

Wait, but the hospital moved for summary judgment, and the patient didn't provide evidence. So the standard would be that if there's no evidence of the plaintiff's negligence, the defendant can't be found negligent for the injury. But even if the defendant's standard isn't met, the plaintiff can still claim negligence if the injury resulted from their conduct. But here, the plaintiff hasn't shown they were negligent.

So the hospital's claim is that the doors were improperly maintained, but without evidence of negligence, maybe that's not enough. Alternatively, perhaps the hospital's failure to maintain the doors is a defect, and the plaintiff can prove that the defect caused the injury. But the patient hasn't provided evidence of that.

Wait, but in summary judgment, if the plaintiff hasn't met their burden of proving negligence, and the defendant's standard isn't met, then the defendant can't be found liable. So the hospital's claim is that the doors were improperly maintained, which is a standard of care, and the patient hasn't shown that it was done improperly. So the hospital might have a case for failure to maintain, but the plaintiff hasn't shown that it caused the injury.

Wait, but the question is whether the hospital should grant summary judgment. The summary judgment is about the other party's liability. If the patient hasn't proven that the hospital was negligent, then the hospital can't be held liable for their failure to maintain the doors. But if the doors' malfunction was a result of the patient's injury, the hospital might be liable for malfunctions caused by the patient's condition. But the patient hasn't provided evidence of that.

Alternatively, perhaps the hospital's claim is that the doors were improperly maintained, which is a standard of care, and the patient hasn't shown that the doors were improperly maintained, so the hospital's claim is invalid. But wait, the hospital moved for summary judgment. So if the other party's standard of care was breached (the patient's failure to maintain the doors), but the patient hasn't shown that this breached their duty, then the hospital can't be held liable for breach of duty.

Wait, but the hospital's claim is that the doors were improperly maintained, and the patient hasn't given any evidence that the doors were improperly maintained. So the hospital's argument is that the doors were improperly maintained, but without evidence, maybe the doors were correctly maintained. Therefore, the hospital's claim is not supported by evidence.

But the patient hasn't provided any evidence of specific conduct or negligence. So perhaps the hospital's standard of care is to ensure patient safety, which is a standard that's typically met, but the patient isn't proving that the doors were improperly maintained.

Alternatively, the question is about whether the hospital can be held responsible for the doors' malfunction, which is a defect. But the patient hasn't provided evidence that the defect was present. So the hospital's claim that the doors were improperly maintained, which is a standard of care, but without evidence of that, it's not supported.

Wait, but the doors were malfunctioning, which could be due to the patient's condition. But the patient hasn't proven that the doors were improperly maintained. So maybe the hospital is liable for malfunctions caused by the patient's condition, but the patient hasn't provided evidence of that.

Alternatively, perhaps the hospital can be held liable for the defect, but the patient hasn't proven that the defect existed. So the hospital's claim of improper maintenance is not supported by evidence, and thus, the hospital can't be held liable for the doors' malfunction.

Wait, but the doors malfunctioned, meaning they couldn't function properly, which could be due to the patient's condition. But the patient hasn't provided evidence that the doors were improperly maintained. So the hospital's claim is that the doors were improperly maintained, but the patient hasn't shown that. So in that case, the hospital's claim is unsupported. But if the doors are a defect, and the patient has a condition that leads to malfunction, then the hospital might be liable for malfunctions caused by the patient's condition, but the patient hasn't proven that.

Wait, but the hospital moved for summary judgment, so if the other party's standard of care was breached (the patient's failure to maintain the doors), but the patient hasn't shown that, then the hospital can't be held liable for that breach. So the hospital's claim that the doors were improperly maintained isn't supported by evidence, so summary judgment would be appropriate.

So looking at the options, option A says yes because the patient hasn't provided evidence of negligence. That makes sense. Because if the patient hasn't shown that the hospital failed to maintain the doors (which is their standard of care), then the hospital isn't liable for that defect. But the hospital is also trying to claim that the doors were improperly maintained, which is a breach of standard of care, but without evidence, so their claim is not supported.

Wait, but if the patient's injury was a result of the doors malfunctioning, which the hospital is trying to claim as a cause of action, but the patient hasn't shown that the doors were improperly maintained. So the hospital's claim that the doors were improperly maintained is not supported by evidence. So the hospital cannot be held responsible for the malfunction, as that's a matter of standard of care, and the patient hasn't proven it.

Alternatively, another angle: the hospital's claim is that the doors were improperly maintained. Without evidence, that's not supported. The patient hasn't shown that the doors were improperly maintained, so the hospital's claim is invalid. Therefore, the hospital isn't liable for the doors malfunction, which is a defect. But the doors malfunctioning caused the injury, so the patient's claim is based on that.

But without evidence that the doors were improperly maintained, the hospital can't be held liable for that defect. The doors malfunctioning might be a result of the patient's condition, but the patient hasn't proven that the doors were improperly maintained.

So the hospital's claim is that the doors were improperly maintained, which is a breach of standard of care. But without evidence, they're not liable. Alternatively, the doors malfunctioning could be due to the patient's condition, but the standard of care was breached, but the patient didn't demonstrate that. So the hospital's claim doesn't hold.

Wait, but the doors were malfunctioning. Does that mean the patient's condition caused the doors to malfunction? If the doors malfunctioned because of the patient's condition, perhaps the hospital is liable for malfunctions caused by the patient's condition. But the patient hasn't proven that. So the hospital's claim of improper maintenance isn't supported by evidence, and the doors malfunctioning is a defect, but the patient hasn't shown the defect was present.

Alternatively, perhaps the doors malfunctioning is a defect, and the patient's injury is a result of that defect. But the patient hasn't shown that the defect existed. So the hospital's claim would be unsupported.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible answers again.

Option A says yes because the patient hasn't provided evidence of negligence. That's a straightforward answer. The standard of care is breached, but without evidence that it was breached, the hospital isn't liable for that breach. However, the patient has a duty to ensure patient safety, but they haven't shown that the doors were improperly maintained, so the hospital isn't liable for that defect.

But the hospital's claim is that the doors were improperly maintained, which is a breach of standard of care. Without evidence, they can't be held liable for that. Then, the doors malfunctioning is a defect, but again, without evidence, the hospital can't be held liable for that.

Wait, but the doors malfunctioning caused the injury, so if the hospital can't establish negligence, but the doors malfunctioning is due to the patient's condition, the hospital might be liable for malfunctions. But the patient hasn't proven that the defect existed, so the hospital can't be held liable for that.

So in summary, the hospital's claim that the doors were improperly maintained isn't supported by evidence, so the hospital isn't liable for that. However, the doors malfunctioning is a defect, but the patient hasn't shown that it was present. Therefore, the hospital can't be held liable for that defect either.

Wait, but the doors malfunctioning caused further injury, so if the doors malfunctioned, but the patient hasn't proven that the doors were improperly maintained, then the hospital can't be held liable for that defect. So the doors malfunctioning is a defect, but the patient hasn't shown the defect, so the hospital can't be held liable for that.

In that case, the hospital's claim of improper maintenance is unsupported, and the doors malfunctioning is a defect, but the patient hasn't provided evidence of that. So the hospital can't be held liable for malfunctions caused by the patient's condition.

So the hospital's claim is unsupported, so they can't be held liable for malfunctions. But the doors malfunctioning was a defect, but the patient hasn't shown it.

So the hospital moved for summary judgment, and the other party hasn't met their burden of proof, so the hospital can't be found liable for the doors malfunctioning. But the doors malfunctioning is a defect that could have been caused by the patient's condition, but without evidence, the hospital can't be found liable.

Wait, but the question is about whether the hospital should grant summary judgment. The patient hasn't provided evidence of negligence, so the hospital can't be held liable for breach of standard of care. But the doors malfunctioning is a defect, but without evidence, the hospital can't be held liable for that defect either.

So the hospital's claim is unsupported, so they can't be found liable. Therefore, the hospital's motion is appropriate, and summary judgment should be granted.

Looking at the options, option A says yes because the patient hasn't provided evidence of negligence. That seems correct.

Alternatively, option B says no because the hospital has a duty to ensure patient safety and failed to do so. But the patient hasn't provided evidence of negligence, so B isn't correct.

Option C says yes because the hospital wasn't aware of any defects. But the patient's injury comes from the doors malfunctioning, which is a defect, so the hospital should be liable for that defect, even if they weren't aware of it.

Option D says yes because the harm was caused by an accident. But the patient's injury was due to the doors malfunctioning, not an accident, so D is not correct.

Option E talks about superseding cause. I don't think that's relevant here.

So the correct answer is A: Yes, because the patient hasn't provided any evidence to prove that the hospital was negligent.
</think>

The patient's claim of injury is based on the malfunctioning of the doors, which the hospital attempted to maintain. The hospital moved for summary judgment, and the patient has not provided evidence of negligence or malfunctions on their part. 

The doors' malfunction, while a defect, was not supported by the patient's evidence. The standard of care, ensuring patient safety, was breached, but without evidence of that breach, the hospital cannot be held liable for it. The doors malfunctioning caused further injury, but the patient has not provided evidence that the defect existed. 

Since the patient has not met their burden of proof to prove negligence, the hospital cannot be found liable for breach of standard of care. However, the doors malfunctioning is a defect that could have been caused by the patient's condition, but without evidence, the hospital cannot be held liable for that defect either. 

The hospital's claim of improper maintenance of the doors is unsupported, and the doors malfunctioning is a defect that the patient has not proven. Therefore, the hospital's motion for summary judgment should be granted.
