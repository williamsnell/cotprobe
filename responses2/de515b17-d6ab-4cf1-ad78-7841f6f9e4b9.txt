Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, a bullet being fired from a gun. I think this is a conservation of momentum problem. Right, because when the bullet is fired, it gains momentum, and the gun must lose that, so their momenta should balance out.

The problem says a 4.0 gram bullet is fired from a 5.0 kg gun with a speed of 600 m/s. I need to find the recoil speed of the gun. Oh wait, and the options are all negative numbers, which makes sense because the gun would move opposite to the bullet.

First, I should probably convert the bullet's mass into kilograms because the units in the options are in meters per second. Wait, no, the options are in m/s, so I can work in grams and kilograms as long as I'm consistent. Wait, the bullet is 4.0 grams, so that's 0.004 kg. Right, because 1 kg is 1000 grams, so 4 grams is 0.004 kg.

Momentum is mass multiplied by velocity. So the momentum of the bullet is m * v. Let me calculate that. So bullet's momentum is 0.004 kg * 600 m/s. Let's see, 0.004 * 600 is 2.4 kg·m/s. So 2.4 kg·m/s is the bullet's momentum.

Since the system is the gun and the bullet, their total momentum must be zero. So the gun's momentum must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the bullet's. So, the gun's momentum is -2.4 kg·m/s (negative because it's opposite in direction).

Now, the gun's mass is 5.0 kg. So, to find the gun's velocity, I can rearrange the momentum equation. Momentum equals mass times velocity, so velocity is momentum divided by mass. So, v = p / m.

So plugging in the numbers: velocity of the gun is (-2.4 kg·m/s) / (5.0 kg). Let's compute that. 2.4 divided by 5 is 0.48. So the gun's velocity is -0.48 m/s. Wait, because the bullet is positive and the gun is opposite.

Looking at the options: option F is -0.48 m/s. So that's the answer. Let me just double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Wait, bullet mass: 4.0 g is 0.004 kg. 0.004 * 600 is 2.4 kg·m/s. Yup. Gun's mass is 5.0 kg. So 2.4 /5 is 0.48. So negative because it's moving opposite. So F is correct.

To solve the problem, we use the principle of conservation of momentum. The bullet and the gun form a closed system, so their total momentum before and after the explosion must be equal. The bullet gains momentum in one direction, and the gun loses an equal amount in the opposite direction.

1. **Convert the bullet's mass to kilograms**:  
   The bullet has a mass of 4.0 g, which is equivalent to \(0.004 \, \text{kg}\).

2. **Calculate the bullet's momentum**:  
   Momentum is given by \(p = m \cdot v\).  
   \[
   p_{\text{bullet}} = 0.004 \, \text{kg} \cdot 600 \, \text{m/s} = 2.4 \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]

3. **Determine the gun's momentum**:  
   Since the total momentum of the system is zero, the gun's momentum must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the bullet's momentum.  
   \[
   p_{\text{gun}} = -2.4 \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]

4. **Calculate the gun's velocity**:  
   Using \(p = m \cdot v\), solve for \(v\):  
   \[
   v_{\text{gun}} = \frac{p_{\text{gun}}}{m_{\text{gun}}} = \frac{-2.4 \, \text{kg·m/s}}{5.0 \, \text{kg}} = -0.48 \, \text{m/s}
   \]

5. **Select the correct option**:  
   The negative sign indicates that the gun moves in the opposite direction to the bullet. The correct answer is \(-0.48 \, \text{m/s}\), which corresponds to option F.
