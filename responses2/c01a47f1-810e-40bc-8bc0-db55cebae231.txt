Okay, so I've got this question about a sine wave and I need to find the correct equation, the current at a specific time, and the fraction of a cycle it's gone through. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question says it's a 25-cycle current sine wave. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Oh, wait, maybe it's a 30-cycle current sine wave? Because a 25-cycle sine wave doesn't make much sense because sine waves are continuous. Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo. Let's assume it's a 30-cycle sine wave, but that also seems high. Or perhaps it's a typo and it's 30 cycles per second, but that would be a high frequency. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they meant 30 cycles in a time of some duration. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 30 Hz sine wave, as in 30 cycles per second. But the question states 25-cycle, which doesn't make much sense. Wait, maybe it's a typo and they meant 30 cycles. Or perhaps it's 30 cycles per cycle. Wait, no, that's confusing. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says, "the equation of a 25-cycle current sine wave," but that's nonsensical because sine waves are cyclical but don't have a fixed number of cycles like that. So maybe the question is actually referring to a 30-cycle sine wave? Or perhaps the units are wrong. Alternatively, maybe the question meant a 30-Hz sine wave, which is a common way to express cycles per second. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a typo, and it's actually 30-cycles, but that's not a standard term. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is correct and it's a sine wave that crosses the axis at time zero in a positive direction, but that's more about the phase shift than the number of cycles. Let me think about the given options.

Looking at the options, each option gives an equation for i(t), the current as a function of time, and then two other values: the RMS current and the fraction of a cycle that has gone through in 0.005 seconds.

First, I need to find the amplitude. The equation of a sine wave is usually i(t) = A sin(ωt + φ), where A is the amplitude. The RMS value of a sine wave is (A/√2) times the square root of the average of the square of the sine function. Wait, no. The RMS value of a sine wave is (A/√2) * (sqrt(1/2)) ? Wait, no. Let me recall: The RMS value of a sine wave is A / sqrt(2) * sqrt( (1/2) )? No, that can't be right. Wait, the RMS value for a sine wave is (A * sqrt(2))/2, which simplifies to A/√2. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no. The average of a square of a sine wave is (1/2), because the integral over a full cycle is (A^2) * (1/2). So the RMS is sqrt( (A^2) * (1/2) ) = A/sqrt(2). So if the RMS is given as 30 amp, then A = 30 * sqrt(2). Let's compute that: 30 * 1.4142 ≈ 42.42, which is approximately 42.4. So the amplitude is about 42.4 amperes. That's the first part of the question.

Wait, but let's see the options. Option A has 42.4 sin 314t, option F has 30 cos... Hmm. Wait, I think I got the amplitude wrong. Let me recheck. The RMS of a sine wave is A / sqrt(2). So if the RMS is 30, then A = 30 * sqrt(2), which is approximately 42.4. So any option with amplitude 42.4 would be correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 42.4 sin 314t. So amplitude is 42.4, correct for RMS 30.

Option B: 42.4 cos 157t. So amplitude 42.4, same as A—so that's another possibility.

Option C: i=30 sin 100t. So amplitude 30, which would correspond to an RMS of 30 / sqrt(2) ≈ 21.2, which doesn't match 30. So C is wrong.

Option D: 42.4 sin 157t. 42.4 sin 157t.

Option E: 42.4 cos 157t. Amplitude 42.4, but cosine.

Option F: 30 cos 157t. Amplitude 30, wrong.

Option G: 30 sin 157t. Amplitude 30, wrong.

Option H: 42.4 sin 50t. Amplitude 42.4, but frequency is 50? Let's think about frequency.

Option I: 60 sin 157t. Amplitude 60, which would make the RMS 60/sqrt(2) ≈42.4, but the question says 30. So I is incorrect.

Option J: 30 sin 157t. Amplitude 30, which would be wrong for a 30 Amp RMS.

So the correct amplitude must be 42.4. So options A, B, D, F, G, J are eliminated.

Now, looking at the other parameters. The question also asks, what is the current at time t=0.005 seconds.

So the options give the current at that time. Let's compute it.

Each option's equation is i(t) = A sin(ωt + φ). The question states that the wave crosses the time axis in a positive direction when time is equal to zero. So φ is zero because at t=0, the sine function is zero, and the current is positive. So the phase φ is zero. So the equation simplifies to i(t) = A sin(ω t).

Wait, but the options' equations have functions like cos 157t. So let's check whether the phase is zero. If the initial current is zero, then the sine function is correct, because sin(0) is zero. The cosine function would start at maximum, which doesn't make sense if the current is zero at t=0. Because cos(0) is 1, but the question says the wave crosses the axis positive at t=0. So the correct phase is zero, meaning the sine function should be used.

Wait, but some options have cos terms. Let me think: for a sine wave, the current starts at zero, goes positive, peaks, and comes back. So at t=0, current is zero. For a cosine function, it starts at maximum. So if the current is zero at t=0, the sine function is correct. So for the equation, the phase shift must be zero.

Looking back at the options, options A, B, D, F, G, J have sine functions. H and I have sine functions as well, but their amplitudes are wrong.

So for the current at t=0.005 sec, let's compute that for each option where the equation is correct.

Option A: 42.4 sin(314t). At t=0.005, ωt is 314 * 0.005 = 1.57 radians. So sin(1.57) is approximately 1 (since sin(π/2) is 1). So current is 42.4 * 1 = 42.4 A.

Option B:42.4 cos(157t). At t=0.005, 157 *0.005 = 0.785 radians. cos(0.785) is about 0.707. So 42.4 * 0.707 ≈ 30 A (since 42.4 * 0.707 ≈ 30). So the current would be about 30 A.

Option D:42.4 sin(157t). 157 *0.005 = 0.785 rad. Sin(0.785)= 0.707. So 42.4 * 0.707 ≈ 30 A.

Option F:30 cos(157t). At t=0.005, 0.785 rad. Cos(0.785)=0.707. So 30 * 0.707 ≈ 21.2 A.

Option G:30 sin(157t). 157*0.005=0.785 rad. Sin(0.785)=0.707. 30 * 0.707 =21.2 A.

Option B and D have cos function, so their current at 0.005 is about 30 A.

The question says, "what is the value of the current at 0.005 sec?" So for options A, B, D, F, G, the current is 42.4, 30, 30, 21.2, 21.2 respectively.

Looking at the options, which values are present?

Option A: current 42.4 A. So the current is 42.4.

Option B:30 A.

Option D:30 A.

So the current at 0.005 sec is either 42.4, 30, or 21.2. The options that have correct current values are A (42.4), B (30), D (30).

Now, the next part is the fraction of a cycle that has gone through in 0.005 sec.

The wave is a sine wave, and the question says it's a 25-cycle. Wait, but this doesn't make sense because sine waves are continuous and have infinite cycles. So perhaps the question meant 30 cycles? Or maybe a typo, and it's 30 Hz? Or perhaps it's 30 cycles per second. Wait, 30 cycles per second would be 30 Hz. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the question meant the wave crosses the axis at time zero and has a certain frequency. But the question says it's a 25-cycle sine wave, which is nonsensical. So perhaps it's a typo, and the intended number is 30 cycles. Let's proceed with that for now.

Wait, but in that case, the wave's period T is 1/30 seconds, which is 0.0333 seconds. The fraction of a cycle passed in 0.005 seconds is (0.005 / T) = 0.005 / (1/30) ) = 0.005 * 30 = 0.15 cycles, which is 3/20 of a cycle. But none of the options have 3/20. Alternatively, maybe the frequency is 30 Hz.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the question intended a 30 Hz sine wave, which has a frequency f = 30 Hz. So the period T = 1/f = 1/30 ≈0.0333 sec. So in 0.005 sec, the number of cycles is 0.005 / (1/30) = 0.15 cycles, which is 3/20 of a cycle. But looking at the options, the only one that mentions 3/20 is option D, which says 1/10 cycle. Wait, 1/10 is 0.1, which is less than 0.15. Hmm, that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the frequency is 50 Hz. Let's see.

Wait, 50 Hz would have a period of 0.02 seconds. 0.005 / 0.02 = 0.25 cycles, which is 1/4 of a cycle. Looking at the options, option F says 1/4 cycle, which would match. So if the frequency is 50 Hz, the period is 0.02 s, and in 0.005 s, it's 0.005 / 0.02 = 0.25 → 1/4 cycle.

But wait, the amplitude depends on the RMS. So let's reevaluate. What is the correct frequency?

We have two possibilities: either the question intended 30 cycles (impossible), or maybe 30 Hertz, which is a high frequency but possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the question meant a 30-cycle sine wave is a typo and it's actually a 30 Hz sine wave, which is a very high frequency but possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the question meant 30 cycles per second, which would be 30 Hz.

So let's proceed under the assumption that the wave is 30 Hz, which would mean f=30 Hz.

So the period T is 1/30 s ≈0.0333 s.

So in 0.005 s, the fraction of a cycle is (0.005) / (1/30) )= 0.005 *30 =0.15 cycles. So 0.15 is 3/20 of a cycle. But none of the options have 3/20. So perhaps the question intended a different number.

Alternatively, perhaps the question said 30 cycles per second, meaning 30 Hz. So let's proceed.

So, the wave equation would be i(t) = A sin(2π f t) → f=30 Hz → ω = 2π *30=600 rad/s. But looking at the options, option I is 60 sin 157t, which is way off. Option E is cos 157t with 60 sin, which isn't correct. Let me see, perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps the period is 0.02 s, which would make frequency 50 Hz. Then, in 0.005 s, it's 0.005 / 0.02 = 0.25 cycles. So 1/4 of a cycle. So, looking at the options, option F says 30 cos 157t, with 30 amp, which is wrong because the amplitude should be 42.4. So perhaps the phase is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's look for the option that has the correct amplitude and phase.

The current at t=0.005 is 30 A. So which options have that?

Option B:42.4 cos 157t → at t=0.005, 157 *0.005 =0.785 rad. cos(0.785)=0.707. 42.4 *0.707 ≈30 A. So B would give 30 A.

Option D:42.4 sin(157 *0.005) =42.4 sin(0.785) ≈42.4 *0.707≈30 A.

So both B and D have 30 A at t=0.005.

The question says, what is the value, so both are candidates. But let's look for other parameters.

The question also asks, what's the fraction of a cycle in 0.005 s. For option B, the equation is cos(157 t). So at t=0.005, as before, 157*0.005=0.785 rad. So 0.785 rad is π/4 (since π/4 is 0.7854). So cos(π/4) is √2/2 ≈0.707. So 42.4 * 0.707 ≈30 A.

The fraction of the cycle is 0.005 / T, where T is the period. What's T? For option B, since it's a cosine function, the period is T=2π /157 → approx 0.0403 s. So in 0.005 s, fraction is 0.005 / 0.0403 ≈0.124, which is approximately 1/8.

But wait, let's compute T more accurately. 157 is the coefficient inside the cosine. So 157 rad/s is the angular frequency. The period T is 2π / ω. So T = 2π / 157 ≈ (6.2832)/157 ≈ ~0.0403 s.

So 0.005 / 0.0403 ≈0.124 → approx 1/8.

Looking at the options, option B gives 30 A and fraction 1/8.

What about option D:42.4 sin(157 t). The period is same as B. At t=0.005, 157 *0.005=0.785 rad. sin(0.785)=0.707 →42.4 *0.707≈30 A. The fraction is same as option B: 1/8.

Wait, but option D has a sin function and a phase of zero because phi is zero.

Wait, but the question states the wave crosses the time axis at t=0 with positive current. So the phase should be zero. So option D has equation 42.4 sin(157t), and at t=0.005 sec, 157 *0.005=0.785 rad. sin is positive, so current is positive. So the phase is zero, which fits the condition.

So, the correct equation would be 42.4 sin(157t), which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option B is 42.4 cos(157t), which also gives 30 A. So why is option D correct and B incorrect?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me re-examine.

The current at t=0.005 seconds is 30 A. So which option gives that?

Option B:42.4 cos(157t). At 0.005, cos(0.785)=0.707. 42.4 *0.707 ≈30 A. Correct.

Option D:42.4 sin(157t). At 0.005, sin(0.785)=0.707 →42.4 *0.707 ≈30 A. Correct.

Hmm, so both B and D would give 30 A.

But according to the fraction of the cycle, what is their value?

Option B: the equation is cos(157t). The current is 30 A, and the fraction is 1/8.

Option D: the equation is sin(157t). The current is 30 A, and the fraction is 1/8.

Now, let's think about the options' other aspects.

Option B: equation is 42.4 cos(157t). So amplitude is 42.4, which is correct.

Option D: equation is 42.4 sin(157t). So amplitude is correct, but the phase is zero, which fits the condition.

Wait, but the question says: what is the value of the current at time 0.005 sec? So both B and D have 30 A. So I need to look for the other parameters.

The question also asks, what is the value of the current at that time. So both B and D have 30 A.

Now, let's look for the fraction of a cycle. So for option B, the equation is cos(157t), which has a period T=2π/157 ≈0.0403 s. So in 0.005 s, the fraction is 0.005 /0.0403 ≈0.124, which is approximately 1/8.

For option D, the equation is sin(157t), which also has the same period. So 0.005/0.0403≈0.124→1/8.

So both B and D have a fraction of 1/8.

But the question is, what is the value of the current at 0.005 sec? Both B and D give 30 A.

Wait, but the question also provides the options for current value. Let me see what each option gives.

Option B:30 A.

Option D:30 A.

So both are correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase. Let me check the question again.

The question says, "the time is equal to zero and the current is positive." So the equation must start at positive, which would be the sine function, as it's positive at t=0. The cosine function starts at maximum, which doesn't fit.

So the equation should be sine. So option D is the sine function. So the correct answer is D.

But wait, let me look at the options again.

Option B:42.4 cos 157t → at 0.005 s, current is 42.4 * cos(0.785)=42.4 *0.707≈30 A. So correct.

Option D:42.4 sin 157t → current same as B, 30 A. Correct.

But both are correct. So where is the mistake?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the phase. Let me re-examine the question.

The wave is a sine wave, crosses the time axis at t=0 in a positive direction. So the equation should be sine function, because sine starts at zero and goes positive. So the equation is sine.

So between the options, only option D has sine function.

So the correct equation is 42.4 sin 157t → option D.

Because option D's equation is sine, which starts at zero and goes positive, which fits the condition.

So the current at 0.005 sec is 30 A.

The fraction of a cycle is 0.124, which is approximately 1/8.

But wait, 0.124 is approximately 13/108 or 1/8.

But looking at the options, the only fraction that matches is 1/8, which is ~0.125.

So the correct option is D.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that the phase was zero, and the equation is sine, which would be correct.

So the correct option is D.

So, the answer is option D.

But wait, let me double-check.

In option D, the current is 42.4 sin(157t). At t=0.005, sin(157*0.005) = sin(0.785) = 0.707. So 42.4 *0.707 ≈30 A.

The fraction of the cycle is 0.005 / (1/30) )=0.005 *30=0.15 cycles, which is 3/20. But none of the options have 3/20. So perhaps the question has a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps the frequency is 50 Hz, which would be 0.02 s period. Then, 0.005 /0.02 =0.25 cycles, which is 1/4.

But looking for the option that gives 30 A and 1/4.

Option F:30 cos 157t → cos(0.785)=0.707. So 30 *0.707=21.2 A. Incorrect.

Option G:30 sin(157t) → same as B, 30 A. But the fraction is 0.15, which is not an option.

So perhaps the correct option is D, with 30 A and 0.15 cycles, but that's not matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the frequency.

Wait, perhaps the wave is a sine wave with a frequency of 50 Hz, which would have a period of 0.02 s. Then, 0.005 /0.02=0.25 cycles, which is 1/4.

But the amplitude would be 42.4, but all the options have 30 or 42.4.

Wait, perhaps the question intended a 30 Hz wave, which has a period of 1/30 ≈0.0333 s. Then, 0.005 /0.0333 ≈0.15 cycles. So that's 0.15.

But the options don't have 0.15. So perhaps the question intended a 30 Hz wave, but the options have 42.4, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended a 30 Hz wave, but the options have 42.4, which is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me try to proceed.

The correct equation for the current is 42.4 sin(157t), which is option D.

So the answer is D.
</think>

The question involves analyzing a sine wave with an amplitude of 42.4 A and a frequency of 157 Hz. The wave crosses the time axis at t=0 with a positive current, indicating a sine wave with a phase shift of zero.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Fraction of a Cycle:**
   - The period \( T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{157} \approx 0.0064 \, \text{s} \).
   - In \( 0.005 \, \text{s} \), the fraction of a cycle is \( \frac{0.005}{0.0064} \approx 0.78 \), or approximately \( 0.78 \, \text{cycles} \).

2. **Amplitude and Current at \( t = 0.005 \, \text{s} \):**
   - The equation is \( i(t) = 42.4 \sin(157t) \).
   - At \( t = 0.005 \, \text{s} \), \( 157 \times 0.005 = 0.785 \, \text{rad} \).
   - \( \sin(0.785) \approx 0.707 \).
   - \( i(0.005) = 42.4 \times 0.707 \approx 30 \, \text{A} \).

3. **Phase Shift:**
   - The wave starts at \( t = 0 \) with \( i = 0 \), which matches a sine wave.

### Matching the Options:
- **Option D:** \( i = 42.4 \sin(157t) \), \( 30 \, \text{A} \), fraction of a cycle \( \approx 0.78 \).
- Other options either have incorrect amplitudes or do not match the phase shift.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **D**, as it accurately represents the sine wave with the correct amplitude, phase shift, and current value at \( t = 0.005 \, \text{s} \).

ANSWER: D
