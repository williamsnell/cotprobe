Okay, so I have this problem here where Joe and Mike ran a race. Joe finished 4 minutes before Mike. Mike's finish time is given as 4:02 p.m. I need to find out when Joe finished. Hmm, let's think.

First, Mike finished at 4:02 p.m. Since Joe finished 4 minutes earlier, I should subtract 4 minutes from Mike's time. Let me do that calculation. 

4:02 minus 0:04. Let's break it down. 4:02 minus 4 minutes is 3:58, right? Because 4:02 minus 4 is 3:58. So Joe must have finished at 3:58 p.m.

Looking at the options, option J is 3:58 p.m. So that's the answer. Let me double-check. If Mike is at 4:02, subtracting 4 minutes would be 3:58. Yep, that makes sense. So the correct answer is option J.

The correct answer is J.

Answer:
     J: 3:58 p.m.

Step-by-step explanation:
- Mike finished at 4:02 p.m.

- 4:02 minus 0:04 equals 3:58 p.m.
- The answer is J.

Answer:
     J: 3:58 p.m.
