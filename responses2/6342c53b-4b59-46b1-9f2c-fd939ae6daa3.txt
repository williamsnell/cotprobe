Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about which animal has the longest life span according to current measures. The options are A to J, with each being a different animal. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to recall what I know about the life spans of various animals. I'm pretty sure that some species live much longer than others. Let me go through each option:

A: Human. Well, humans have an average lifespan, but I think they don't live that long; I remember something about they live around 70 on average. But that's just an average, so it's probably not the longest.

B: Parrot. Parrots can live for a long time. I think their lifespan is around 20-30 years, but I'm not sure. Maybe a bit longer, but I'm not certain.

C: Lion. I've heard that lions can live up to 20-40 years. That's a bit longer than humans. So this one's a contender.

D: Elephant. Elephants are known for their long lifespans. I think they live for about 60-70 years. That's longer than many others.

E: Dog. Dogs have a lifespan of around 10-15 years. That's not very long compared to the others.

F: Tortoise. Turtles are another species; they live over 50 years. So the tortoise is a contender, but I'm not sure if it's as long as the elephant or lion.

G: Kangaroo. Kangaroos are a bit smaller than elephants and lions. I think they live around 15-25 years. So not as long as some others.

H: Queen honey bee. I'm not sure about the lifespan of a queen honey bee. They're the queens of hives, but I don't recall them living long. Maybe a few years, but probably not the longest.

I: Blue whale. Blue whales are known for their long lifespans. The common blue whale lives about 60 years, and some species can live longer, like the blue whale. That's longer than many, including elephants.

J: Gorilla. Gorillas have a lifespan around 30-40 years, similar to the lion. So not as long as the blue whale.

Now, let's compare the options that have longer lifespans. I'm looking for the longest. So comparing C, D, I, and F.

Lions (C) can live up to 40 years. Elephants (D) live about 70. Blue whales (I) live about 60. Turtles (F) live over 50. So the longest among these would be the blue whale at around 60 years.

Wait, but let me make sure. I'm pretty sure that the blue whale is the longest. Their lifespan is indeed around 60 years. While the common blue whale is 60, some larger blue whales can live longer. But the question is about the longest current measures, so I think 60 is considered the maximum.

So among the options, I and D are the top contenders. I is the blue whale, which is the longest known, then D the elephant. So the answer should be I: Blue whale.

The correct answer is the blue whale, which has the longest lifespan among the listed options. 

Answer: I
