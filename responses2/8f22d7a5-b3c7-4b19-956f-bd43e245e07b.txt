Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about the normal voltage used in directional heating. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electrical engineering, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, the options are A through J, each with different voltages. Let me start by recalling what directional heating involves. Directional heating is a method where a current is applied to a conductor, such as a wire, to direct the flow of another current into it. This is often used in wiring to control the direction of a load, like a motor or a device that needs to rotate in a specific direction.

I remember that directional heating typically uses a voltage that can handle the current flow without overheating. Oh right, the power lines have certain voltage ratings to prevent overloading. But wait, directional heating might be a bit different. I think it's about the voltage applied to the hot wire, not the power lines.

Wait, directional heating often uses a single phase of a higher voltage. Let me think: the power lines usually use 220V, but when you have directional heating, you might use a higher voltage to drive the current. Oh, right, I think for directional heating, the voltage is typically around 66 kV. That's high voltage, but I'm not sure if it's the maximum or just a common choice.

Let me think about other uses. For example, in some power distribution systems, directional control uses 66 kV to drive the hot wire. If I remember correctly, 66 kV is commonly used for directional heating because it can handle the high current without melting the insulation or causing overheating. Other options like 77 kV are higher, but higher voltages might require more power lines or could be inefficient.

Looking at the options again: A is 1.5 KV, which seems too low. B is 66 KV, which I think fits. C is 77 KV, higher than B. D is 500 KV, way too high. E is 150 KV, that's 150,000 volts. F is 100 KV, which is 100,000. G is 15 KV, even lower. H is 33 KV, which is half of B. I is 0.5 KV, which is super low. J is 200 KV, maybe for higher applications.

Wait, I'm pretty sure that directional heating uses 66 kV. So option B would be the correct answer. Other options like 100 kV are for some other applications, maybe in higher voltage equipment, but directional heating is likely in the 60s or 70s.

Another thought: sometimes directional heating uses a higher voltage, like 66 kV, but I don't recall higher ones being used in that context. For instance, in some power supply systems, 66 kV is used for directional control, but I'm not sure about others. Also, 77 kV is a bit higher, but again, I think 66 is the standard for directional heating.

The correct answer is B: 66 KV. Directional heating typically uses a high voltage of 66 kV to drive the current through the hot wire, ensuring efficient and safe operation without overheating. Other options, such as 77 kV, are higher but are not commonly used in directional heating contexts. 

Answer: B
