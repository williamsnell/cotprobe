Okay, so I need to figure out when the endometrium grows and thickens. Let me think about the endometrium. I remember it's the tissue beneath the lining of the uterus, right? It's important for carrying children.

Wait, the endometrium is involved in various bodily functions. Menstrual cycles are a key part, but the question is about its growth during a specific phase. Let me recall the phases of the menstrual cycle. The cycle goes through different stages, with the follicular phase and the luteal phase being the main ones.

Oh right, the follicular phase happens during the woman's time before menopause. It's when the ovaries produce eggs, and the endometrium starts to develop. Then, during the luteal phase, which comes after the follicular phase, the endometrium continues to grow because the egg is still developing, and the uterus is preparing for reproduction.

So when does the endometrium start to grow and become thicker? I think it's during the follicular phase, which is the initial phase before the woman enters menopause. That's when the endometrium starts to develop, maybe a bit thicker. Wait, but during the luteal phase, does it get even thicker? Or does it just continue to grow?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The follicular phase is the phase when the ovaries are producing eggs. At that time, the endometrium begins to form. Then, as the eggs develop, the endometrium continues to grow and become thicker. So the endometrium grows during the follicular phase and then continues to grow during the luteal phase, which is part of the same cycle.

Looking at the options, the options are about specific phases. The question is asking when it "grows and thickens". The follicular phase is before menopause, and the luteal phase comes after. So during the follicular phase, the endometrium starts growing. Wait, but the options don't include the entire cycle. The options are A through J, some are specific.

The question is asking for the phase when it starts to grow and get thicker. So during the follicular phase, which is before menopause, the endometrium begins to grow. Then, during the luteal phase, it continues to grow as the egg is developing.

But wait, the options don't include 'luteal phase' as a separate choice. The options are A to J, with some labels like follicular, luteal, etc.

Wait, the options are:

A: secretory phase
B: follicular phase
C: proliferative phase
D: postmenopause
E: menopause
F: pregnancy
G: Menstruation
H: ovulation
I: luteal phase
J: menstrual cycle

So the question is asking when the endometrium grows and thickens. The follicular phase is the initial phase, which I think is when the endometrium starts to form. The luteal phase comes after, but the question is about when it starts to grow. So the follicular phase is the answer.

Looking at the options, option B is the follicular phase. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. The endometrium is also involved in other aspects, like the production of estrogen and other hormones. Menstrual cycles are tied to the luteal phase as well. So the endometrium might start to grow during the follicular phase, and during the luteal phase, it becomes more developed. So the initial phase when it starts to grow is the follicular phase. So the answer is option B.

The endometrium begins to grow and become thicker during the follicular phase before menopause. 

Answer: B
