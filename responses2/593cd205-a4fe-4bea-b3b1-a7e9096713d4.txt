Okay, so I have this question here about rounding the population of a city to the nearest ten thousand. The population given is 836,527. Hmm, let me think about how rounding works. 

Rounding to the nearest ten thousand means looking at the thousands place and deciding whether to round up or down. The number is 836,527. Let me break it down. The ten thousands place is the fourth digit from the right, which is 3 in this case. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 836,527. Let's see: the digits are 8 (hundred thousands), 3 (ten thousands), 6 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 7 (units).

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me write it out properly. 836,527 is 836 thousand 527. So the places are:

- 8: hundred thousands
- 3: ten thousands
- 6: thousands
- 5: hundreds
- 2: tens
- 7: units

When rounding to the nearest ten thousand, I look at the thousands place. The thousands digit is 6. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait, the thousands place is the fourth digit from the right. Let me recount: 836,527 is 8 (hundred thousands), 3 (ten thousands), 6 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 7 (units). So the ten thousands place is 3, thousands is 6. 

Wait, no, wait again. No, wait. Let me think about the place values properly. Let's split the number: 836,527.

Breaking it down:
- 8: hundred thousands (800,000)
- 3: ten thousands (30,000)
- 6: thousands (6,000)
- 5: hundreds (500)
- 2: tens (20)
- 7: units (7)

So when rounding to the nearest ten thousand, I look at the thousands digit, which is 6. The rule is: if the digit to the right (the hundreds place) is 5 or more, we round up; otherwise, we round down. So in this case, the thousands digit is 6, and the hundreds digit is 5. So 6 in the thousands place is followed by a 5, so we round up.

Rounding 836,527 to the nearest ten thousand: the ten thousands digit is 3, and the next digit is 6. Wait, no. Wait, 836,527 is 836 thousand and 527. So when rounding to the nearest ten thousand, it's 836,527. The ten thousands place is 3, the next digit is 6. So 3 is in the ten thousands place, and the next digit is 6. Since 6 is greater than 5, we round up the ten thousands digit.

So 3 becomes 4. So the rounded number is 840,000? Wait, but let me check the options. Looking at the options, option F is 840,000. But wait, the given population is 836,527. So when rounding, 836,527 is closer to 840,000 than to 830,000? Because 836,527 is 83.5 thousand away from 830,000 and 3.5 thousand away from 840,000. Wait, that's not right. Wait, 836,527 minus 830,000 is 6,527. And 840,000 minus 836,527 is 3,473. So actually, it's closer to 840,000 by 3,473, which is less than the 6,527 difference to 830,000. So when rounding to the nearest ten thousand, we look at the thousands digit. The thousands digit is 6. Since 6 is more than 5, the ten thousands digit (3) rounds up to 4. So the rounded number is 840,000.

Looking back at the options, option F is 840,000. So that's the correct answer. So the correct option is F.

The population of the city is 836,527. To round to the nearest ten thousand, we look at the thousands digit (6) and the hundreds digit (5). Since the hundreds digit is 5 or more, we round up the ten thousands digit. Thus, 836,527 rounds to 840,000.
