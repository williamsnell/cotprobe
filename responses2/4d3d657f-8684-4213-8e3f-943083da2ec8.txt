Okay, so I have this question about fiscal policy and how it can help with a recession. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that fiscal policy refers to the government's methods of spending, saving, and investing within the economy to influence key economic indicators like GDP, employment, and inflation. The question is about the appropriate fiscal policy to remedy a recession.

A recession is a period of economic decline, often characterized by reduced spending, rising unemployment, and possibly a decrease in GDP. So, the goal here would be to stimulate the economy, which means increasing activity and growth.

I think about what fiscal policy does. There are two main approaches: expansionary and contractionary. Expansionary policies aim to increase the economy's growth by increasing demand. Contractionary policies are meant to reduce economic activity, like cutting taxes or reducing government spending.

Let me recall some key concepts. The government can use fiscal spending and taxation to influence the economy. If the economy is struggling, the government can increase its spending to create more jobs and stimulate the economy. Alternatively, increasing taxes reduces the disposable income of the people, which might slow down spending and investment.

Wait, so if I'm trying to stimulate the economy during a recession, the goal is to increase demand. Therefore, I should look for a fiscal policy that leads to an increase in government spending or taxes.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Calls for the federal government to run a deficit.
A deficit means the government is spending more than it's earning. For example, government borrowing to finance its spending. But during a recession, a deficit might not be the best approach because it could lead to increased borrowings which might cause inflation if the economy isn't strong enough.

Option B: Calls for a surplus. A surplus would mean the government is earning more than it's spending. That could be good because it injects more money into the economy, increasing demand and potentially boosting GDP.

Option C: Increased taxes and government spending. So, both taxes and spending go up. This is expansionary because both reduce the effectiveness of the money supply through taxes and increase it through spending. It could help stimulate the economy.

Option D: Decreased spending and taxes. Lower spending would reduce demand, and lower taxes would mean more disposable income, which might not help. It could even lead to higher consumption, but perhaps not enough to stimulate.

Wait, but actually, a contractionary policy would be to reduce spending and/or tax rates. For example, during a recession, reducing government spending or lowering taxes could help. But the question is asking for an appropriate fiscal policy to remedy a recession, which would be expansionary.

So, options C and B are both expansionary. But which one is more appropriate?

Hmm. I think both increasing taxes and spending (C) and increasing spending only (B) can help. But I'm not sure if the question is implying a specific approach. Alternatively, I remember that in some contexts, the government might choose to increase its spending more than taxes. Or maybe they might decide to run a surplus because it provides a financial buffer.

Wait, but during a recession, the economy is struggling, so expansionary fiscal policy is usually preferred. So, if the policy increases both government spending and taxes, that's a contractionary approach. Wait, no, that's not right. If taxes are increased, that reduces disposable income, which would decrease consumption. So that's a contractionary policy, which might not be good. So maybe option C is contractionary.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Expansionary policy would aim to increase GDP. To do that, the government can either increase spending or cut taxes, or both.

Option C says "increased taxes and government spending." That seems to be a contractionary approach because it reduces the money supply through taxes and increases it through spending. That could lead to a decrease in GDP, which would be bad for a recession. So option C is likely a contractionary policy.

Option B is "surplus," which is increasing the government's budget. That would mean the government is saving more. But in a recession, a surplus might not help. Alternatively, a government could choose to run a deficit to borrow money, but that's also a contractionary policy.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms. Let me clarify: a deficit occurs when the government spends more than it earns (Taxes + Interest on borrowings). A surplus is when it earns more than it spends (Taxes + Interest on borrowings).

So, a deficit would lead to borrowing, which could cause inflation if the economy isn't strong enough. A surplus would provide a financial buffer, allowing the government to reduce spending and tax revenues, which could help stimulate the economy.

Wait, but in the context of a recession, which is a period of low demand, the government might prefer to inject money into the economy, which is achieved by a balanced budget (surplus) or by increasing spending to stimulate demand.

Hmm, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of a simple example. If the economy is struggling, people in recession might have less money to spend, and businesses are less likely to invest. So, government actions that boost spending or create jobs would encourage those behaviors.

Option C: Increased taxes and government spending. That would reduce disposable income (because taxes go up), so people might spend less, not necessarily stimulate. Plus, if government spending goes up, it can create more jobs, but maybe not enough to stimulate the economy if the economy is already struggling.

Option B: Surplus. That would mean the government is saving money, which could allow it to reduce its spending or cut taxes, leading to more demand.

Wait, but during a recession, the government might want to reduce its spending because it's not generating as much revenue. So, if the government reduces taxes and reduces spending, that would reduce the demand side. Alternatively, if they increase taxes and/or spending, that would reduce demand.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the short-term vs long-term effects. In the short term, during a recession, expansionary fiscal policy (like increased government spending or tax cuts) can help. But in the long term, the government might be stuck in a recession because of the high level of government debt.

So, in a recession, the government might need to either stimulate the economy through expansionary measures or find ways to reduce its debt burden. If they run a deficit, that's bad because it's borrowing money to finance spending, which could lead to inflation if GDP isn't strong.

So, the appropriate fiscal policy during a recession would be to run a surplus (B) or increase government spending (C), but I'm not sure which is better.

Wait, another approach: during a recession, the government might be in a situation where the economy is weak, so it's better to stimulate it. So, the appropriate policy would be to increase government spending or cut taxes.

Looking at the options, option B is a surplus, which is increasing government budget, and option C is increasing taxes and spending.

Wait, no. A surplus actually means that the government is earning more than it's spending. So, when the government is in a recession, to create more money, it can either save more (surplus) or reduce spending. Reducing spending might not be as effective, but in the context of a recession, perhaps the best approach is to run a deficit, but that's bad for the economy.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think about the fiscal policy goals. The goal is to stimulate the economy, so the government wants to increase demand. To do that, it can increase spending (like infrastructure projects) or cut taxes.

Wait, but if the government cuts taxes, that reduces disposable income, which might reduce private spending and investment. It might not help much in a recession.

On the other hand, running a deficit (borrowing) allows the government to spend more, which can stimulate the economy. But it's an expensive way to borrow, and it might lead to inflation if the economy isn't strong.

Alternatively, if the government runs a surplus, that means it's saving more, which might allow it to reduce its spending and cut taxes, which can increase disposable income and private spending, thus boosting the economy.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is C: increased taxes and government spending. Or is it B?

Wait, let's look for the correct answer. From what I remember, during a recession, the government often uses expansionary fiscal policy, which can be either increasing government spending or increasing taxes, or a combination of both.

But I think that the correct answer for this question is that the appropriate fiscal policy is increased taxes and government spending. Wait, no, that would be a contractionary approach. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, because increasing taxes and spending would reduce the money supply, which is bad for an expanding economy. So that's a contractionary policy, not expansionary.

So, if the correct policy is expansionary, then it must be either B (surplus) or C (taxes and spending). But which one?

I think that during a recession, the government might prefer to run a deficit to borrow money, but that's a contractionary policy. Alternatively, if the government can't afford to run a deficit, it might cut taxes and reduce spending, leading to a contractionary policy.

Wait, perhaps in the short term, during a recession, the government would run a deficit because that's the only way to stimulate the economy, even if it means high debt.

But the question is about the appropriate fiscal policy, so perhaps the best approach is to run a surplus, which would allow the government to reduce its spending and cut taxes, leading to increased demand.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think of the options again.

Option C: increased taxes and government spending. So, that would be a contractionary policy because it reduces the money supply.

Option B: surplus. So, that's an expansionary policy because it increases the government's budget.

So, if the goal is to stimulate the economy, which is a recession, the expansionary policy would be to run a surplus. So, option B is correct.

But wait, that doesn't sound right. Because running a surplus would mean the government is saving more, so it can reduce its spending and cut taxes, which would lower the demand side of the economy. That might not help.

Wait, I'm so confused now. Let me think again. The question is asking for the appropriate fiscal policy to remedy a recession. So, the correct answer is to use expansionary fiscal policy.

Expansionary fiscal policy includes both increasing government spending and cutting taxes, or increasing taxes and borrowing. But if the question is about options C and B, and the correct answer is one of them.

I think the correct answer is B: calls for the federal government to run a surplus. Because running a surplus allows the government to reduce its spending, which could help stimulate the economy.

Wait, but running a surplus would mean the government is saving money, which might allow it to reduce its spending. However, during a recession, the economy is struggling, so reducing spending might not be enough. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to run a deficit, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again, the only expansionary options are B and C. But I think that during a recession, the government might prefer to run a deficit to stimulate the economy, so option C would be the correct answer.

But I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B because during a recession, the government can run a surplus, which would allow it to reduce its spending and cut taxes, which can lead to increased demand.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: in a recession, the government might need to increase its spending to inject more money into the economy. So, increasing taxes and spending might not be the best because increasing spending could lead to more jobs, but might not directly stimulate the economy.

Alternatively, cutting taxes and increasing government spending could help, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C: increased taxes and spending. Because in a recession, the government can run a deficit by increasing spending and increasing taxes, which would reduce private demand and increase government demand.

But that would be a contractionary policy. Wait, no, because the government is using its own funds to spend. So, if the government runs a deficit, it's using borrowed funds, which is bad for the economy.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. I'll try to recall: the correct answer is B, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, I think I remember that during a recession, the government can run a surplus, which allows it to reduce its spending and cut taxes, thereby increasing demand. So, the correct answer is B: calls for the federal government to run a surplus.

Wait, but that would mean the government is saving money, but if it's running a surplus, it's saving, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's cutting taxes. Alternatively, a surplus is when the government's revenues exceed its outflows, which could mean it's saving money.

I'm getting more confused. Maybe it's time to look for a better approach. I'll think about the options again.

Option C: increased taxes and spending. So, both are increased. That would lead to a contractionary policy because it reduces the money supply (taxes) and increases it (spending). So, this would cause inflation if the economy isn't growing enough.

Option B: surplus. That would mean the government is saving money, which could allow it to reduce its spending and cut taxes, leading to more demand.

But in a recession, reducing spending is counterproductive. So, perhaps the correct approach is to run a deficit, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because during a recession, the government might choose to run a deficit to borrow and spend more, which could help stimulate the economy.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the impact of each option.

Option C: increased taxes and spending. It would reduce private demand, which might not help during a recession.

Option B: surplus. It would allow the government to reduce spending and cut taxes, which could increase demand.

So, in that case, option B would be the expansionary policy.

Wait, but I'm getting myself more confused. I think the correct answer is B because it's an expansionary policy, and the question is about the appropriate one. So, option B: calls for the federal government to run a surplus.
</think>

The question asks for the appropriate fiscal policy to remedy a recession. A recession typically occurs when the economy is struggling, characterized by reduced demand, rising unemployment, and declining GDP. The goal of fiscal policy is to stimulate the economy by increasing demand. 

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Calls for the federal government to run a deficit.**  
   A deficit occurs when the government spends more than it earns, often through borrowing. While this can stimulate the economy, it can also lead to inflation if the economy is struggling. It is not the best short-term policy for a recession.

2. **Option B: Calls for the federal government to run a surplus.**  
   A surplus occurs when the government earns more than it spends, typically through tax cuts or reduced borrowing. This allows the government to reduce its spending and cut taxes, which can increase private demand and stimulate the economy. This aligns with the goal of expansionary fiscal policy during a recession.

3. **Option C: Increased taxes and government spending.**  
   This approach reduces disposable income, which could lead to decreased private demand. It is a contractionary policy and less effective in stimulating an economy in a recession.

4. **Option D: Decreased government spending and taxes.**  
   Reducing spending and taxes can dampen private demand, which is counterproductive during a recession.

### Conclusion:
The appropriate fiscal policy to remedy a recession is to run a surplus, as it allows the government to reduce its spending and cut taxes, thereby increasing demand and stimulating the economy.
