Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out which option is equal to one. Let's go through each option one by one.

The question is asking which of the listed economic concepts is equal to one. The options are A to J, each representing different economic multipliers. I remember that multipliers are used to describe how an initial change in spending affects the overall economy. So, I'm thinking about each one.

Option A: The elasticity of the long-run aggregate supply curve. I'm not sure about this. Elasticity measures responsiveness, but I think the long-run AS curve is vertical, so elasticity would be infinite. So probably not A.

Option B: The spending (or expenditure) multiplier. Wait, the spending multiplier is greater than one in the short run, but in the long run, it's zero because the aggregate supply doesn't respond to changes in aggregate demand. So B isn't one.

Option C: The investment multiplier. I think the investment multiplier is also greater than one, especially in the short run. So C is probably not one.

Option D: The balanced budget multiplier. Hmm, the balanced budget multiplier is typically greater than one because it's used in the context of fiscal policy. It's the effect of balanced spending shifts. So D is not one.

Option E: The aggregate demand multiplier. Wait, in the short run, the AD curve is horizontal, so the multiplier is infinite. But in the long run, it's vertical, so the multiplier is zero. So E is not one.

Option F: The income multiplier. I recall that the income multiplier is the same as the spending multiplier. Both are greater than one. So F is not one.

Option G: The fiscal policy multiplier. Oh, yes! The fiscal policy multiplier is the change in GDP due to a change in fiscal policy. I think it's (1 - 1/m), where m is the marginal propensity to save. So when m is 0.5, the fiscal multiplier is 1. Wait, no: the formula is 1/(1 - MPC), where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume. So if MPC is 0.5, then 1/(1-0.5)=2. So the fiscal multiplier is 2, which is greater than one. So G is not one.

Option H: The money (or banking) multiplier. The money multiplier is greater than one because it amplifies the money supply. So H is not one.

Option I: The inflation multiplier. That refers to the change in prices, not quantity. So I is not one.

Option J: The interest rate multiplier. I think this is the effect on investment due to a change in interest rates. The interest rate multiplier is positive, but is it one? Wait, no. The interest rate multiplier is typically greater than one because it amplifies the effect of a change in interest rates on investment. For example, if investment is I = C + I(Y - r), so a change in r would affect I. So J is not one.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The interest rate multiplier is (1/(1-MPC)), so it's equal to 1/(1 - MPC). Since MPC is typically 0.8 or so, 1/(1-0.8)=5. So J is 5, which is greater than one. So H is not one.

Wait, wait. Let me check the options again. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting the terms wrong. The balanced budget multiplier is the change in government spending that keeps aggregate demand the same, which would be (1/(1-MPS)), where MPS is marginal propensity to save. If MPS is 0.2, then it's 1/(0.8)=1.25, so the multiplier is 1.25. So the balanced budget multiplier is 1.25, which is not one. So that's not the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is which is equal to one. So I'm getting confused because none of the options seem to point to one. Did I miss something?

Wait, another thought. The expenditure multiplier. Wait, I thought the expenditure multiplier is greater than one. The formula is ΔY = (ΔMPC)^-1. So if MPC is 0.8, then 1/(1-0.8)=5. So no, that's not one.

Wait, what about the balanced budget multiplier? No, that's 1.25, not one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier options. Let me re-examine each option's multiplier.

Option A: Long-run aggregate supply's elasticity. Is the long-run AS curve vertical? Yes. So the elasticity is undefined (infinite) because a percentage change in price doesn't affect quantity. So A is infinite, not one.

Option B: Spending multiplier. In the short run, it's (1/MPS) or (1/(1-MPC)). If MPC is 0.8, then 1/(0.2)=5. So B is 5, not one.

Option C: Investment multiplier. In the short run, it's (1/MIS) or (1/(1-MIS)). If MIS is 0.2, then 1/0.8=1.25. So C is 1.25, not one.

Option D: Balanced budget multiplier. As before, it's 1.25.

Option E: Aggregate demand multiplier. In the short run, it's infinite. So E is not one.

Option F: Income multiplier. Same as spending multiplier, 5.

Option G: Fiscal policy multiplier. As discussed, 2. So G is 2.

Option H: Money multiplier. It's (1 + MPC). Wait no, the money multiplier is (1 + MPC - MS) or something else? Let me think. The money multiplier is (1 + MPC)/(1 - MPC). Wait, if MPC is 0.8, then 1 + 0.8 =1.8, divided by (1-0.8)=0.2. So 1.8/0.2=9. So H is 9, not one.

Option I: Inflation multiplier. It's (1 + MPC)/(1 - MPC). Wait, no, the inflation multiplier is higher than one. For example, if MPC is 0.8, the inflation multiplier is (1 + 0.8)/(1 - 0.8) )? Wait, I think the formula is (1) / (1 - MPC). So 1/(0.2)=5. So I is 5. So not one.

Option J: Interest rate multiplier. As discussed, is 1/(1-MPC) = 1/(0.2)=5. So J is 5. No.

Wait, but the question is which is equal to one. So I'm looking for an option where the multiplier equals one.

Wait, perhaps I've missed the balanced budget multiplier. Let me double-check. The balanced budget multiplier is the change in GDP when the government increases expenditure by ΔG and decreases taxes by ΔT such that the net tax change matches the ΔG. The formula is ΔY = (1 / (1 - MPC)) * ΔG. So, if MPC is 0.5, then ΔY = 2ΔG. So the balanced budget multiplier is 2. So J is 2, not one.

Wait, but the balanced budget multiplier is the same as the fiscal policy multiplier. So J is 2.

Wait, but the question is which is equal to one. So I'm confused because all the multipliers I'm considering are greater than one. Except maybe the balanced budget multiplier is 2, so not one. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing the option for the spending multiplier when MPC is 0.5.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the spending multiplier. Wait, the spending multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC). If MPC is 0.5, then it's 2, so the spending multiplier is 2. So for example, if MPC is 0.5, then ΔY = 2ΔG.

Wait, but the balanced budget multiplier would be (1 / (1 - MPC)) which is 2, same as the spending multiplier. So both are 2. So none of the options is 1.

Wait, but the question is which is equal to one. So perhaps I'm wrong in my approach. Maybe one is the marginal propensity to save. No, because the spending multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC). So if MPC is 0.5, then the spending multiplier is 2.

Wait, perhaps the balanced budget multiplier is 1, but I thought it's 2.

Wait, another approach: the spending multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC). Let's say MPC is 0.75. Then 1/(0.25)=4. So spending multiplier is 4.

Wait, but the balanced budget multiplier is the multiplier that, when applied to an increase in government expenditure, keeps aggregate demand the same. So the formula is 1/(1 - MPC). So for example, if MPC is 0.8, then 1/(0.2)=5. So the balanced budget multiplier is 5.

Wait, perhaps the balanced budget multiplier is the same as the fiscal multiplier. So J is 5, not one.

Wait, perhaps there's an option I'm missing. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the question is which of the following is equal to one. So if none of the options directly point to one, perhaps I'm wrong and one is the marginal propensity to save. Because, for example, the spending multiplier is 1/(1-MPS) → if MPS is 0.5, then 1/0.5=2. So spending multiplier is 2. But then, the balanced budget multiplier is 2. So none of the options are one.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think of each option again.

Option G: Investment multiplier. The formula for the investment multiplier is (1/MIS) or (1/(1-MIS)). If MIS is 0.2, then 1/(0.8)=1.25, so G is 1.25.

Option B: Spending multiplier is 5. So no.

Wait, another thought: the balanced budget multiplier is the change in aggregate demand when the government increases by ΔG and decreases by ΔT such that ΔT = ΔG. The formula for this is (1/(1 - MPC)) * ΔG. So if MPC is 0.5, that's 2. So the balanced budget multiplier is 2. So again, J is 2.

Wait, unless the balanced budget multiplier is 1, but that doesn't seem right. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that's impossible because the question must have one.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think about the investment multiplier. The investment multiplier is (1/(1-MIS)). So if MIS is 0.5, then 2. So no.

Wait, perhaps the spending multiplier is 1 when MPC is 1, but that's only in the short run. Wait, no. If MPC is 1, then the spending multiplier is infinite.

Wait, maybe I'm remembering the formula wrong. Let's think again. The spending multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC). So for example, if MPC is 0.8, then 1/(0.2)=5. So the spending multiplier is 5. So none of the options point to one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is the balanced budget multiplier is 1. But no, because it's 2.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again. The question is which is equal to one. So among the options, which one has a multiplier of one.

Ah! Wait, perhaps the balanced budget multiplier. Wait, no, I thought it's 2. So I'm stuck.

Wait, another possibility: The balanced budget multiplier is (1 + MPC) / (1 - MPC) × (1/(1 - MPC)), but no, I'm getting confused. Let me find the formula for the balanced budget multiplier again.

The balanced budget multiplier is the effect on income when government increases expenditure by ΔG and decreases taxes by ΔT so that ΔT = ΔG. The formula is:

ΔY = (ΔG) * (1 / (1 - MPC)).

So if MPC is 0.5, ΔY = 2ΔG. So the balanced budget multiplier is 2.

So no, it's 2, not one.

Wait, but then where is the option that equals one? Maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the money multiplier is something else. Or the fiscal policy multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC). Wait, no, the fiscal policy multiplier is (1/(1 - MPC)) * ΔG. So if MPC is 0.5, the fiscal policy multiplier is 2. So no.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but since it's a multiple-choice, that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is the balanced budget multiplier, which is 2. But that's not one.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me try another approach. Let's think of each option's multiplier and see which is 1.

Option G: Investment multiplier is 1/(1 - MIS) → if MIS is 0.5, then 2.

Option B: Spending multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC) → 5.

Option C: Investment multiplier is 1/(1 - MIS) → 2.

So none of the options equal to one.

Wait, but if I'm wrong somewhere, perhaps one of the options is the correct answer. Let me think of the options again.

Wait, another thought: the balanced budget multiplier is (1 + MPC) / (1 - MPC). Let me compute that. If MPC is 0.5, that's (1.5)/(0.5)=3. So not one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is the balanced budget multiplier is 2, and none of the options is 1. But that's impossible because the question must have an answer.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding the options. Let me look again.

Option G: The investment multiplier. So if the investment multiplier is 1, then 1/(1 - MIS) =1 → 1=1-MIS → MIS=0. That can't be, because MIS is the marginal propensity to save, which is 1-MPC. So MIS can't be zero if MPC is positive.

Wait, so maybe the investment multiplier can't be 1. So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not possible.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, the balanced budget multiplier is (1/(1 - MPC)) * (1 - (MPS)) → because to keep aggregate demand the same, the increase in government spending (ΔG) must be offset by a decrease in taxes (ΔT) such that ΔT = ΔG. So the change in investment is I = C + l(Y - r). So the change in investment is l*ΔY. Since ΔY = ΔG + ΔT = ΔG + ΔG = 2ΔG. So ΔI = l*2ΔG. Thus, the multiplier for investment is 2l. But l = 1 - MPC. So ΔI = 2*(1 - MPC)*ΔG. Thus, the multiplier is 2*(1 - MPC). If MPC is 0.5, 2*(0.5)=1. So the balanced budget multiplier for investment is 1.

Wait, that's a different approach. So if MPC is 0.5, the balanced budget multiplier is 1. So option G, which is the investment multiplier, in this case, is 1. So the correct answer would be G.

Wait, that's a new angle. Let me recheck. So the balanced budget multiplier is the change in investment when government increases by ΔG and decreases taxes by ΔT so that ΔG = ΔT. So the change in income is ΔY = (1 - MPC)*ΔG. So investment is I = C + l(Y - r). The change in investment is l*ΔY = l*(1 - MPC)*ΔG.

But l = 1 - MPC. So ΔI = (1 - MPC)^2 * ΔG.

Wait, but that's not the same as the previous approach. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of it again.

In the balanced budget scenario, the government increases expenditure by ΔG and decreases taxes by ΔT such that ΔT = ΔG. So the change in income is ΔY = (1/(1 - MPC)) * ΔG. Because the multiplier is (1 - MPC)^-1.

So the change in investment is ΔI = l * ΔY, where l is the marginal propensity to save. So l = 1 - MPC.

So ΔI = (1 - MPC) * (1/(1 - MPC)) * ΔG → ΔI = ΔG.

Thus, the multiplier is 1. So the balanced budget multiplier is 1.

Wait, that makes sense. So if MPC is 0.5, then 1/(1-0.5)=2, so the spending multiplier is 2. But the balanced budget multiplier is 1.

So in that case, the correct option is G: The investment multiplier.

Wait, so the balanced budget multiplier is 1, so option G is the answer.
</think>

To determine which of the given economic concepts is equal to one, we analyze each option:

### Option A: The elasticity of the long-run aggregate supply curve
The long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical, so the elasticity of this curve is infinite. This is not equal to one.

---

### Option B: The spending (or expenditure) multiplier
The spending multiplier is calculated as \( \frac{1}{1 - \text{MPC}} \), where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume. If MPC is 0.5, the spending multiplier is 2. Thus, this is not equal to one.

---

### Option C: The investment multiplier
The investment multiplier is calculated as \( \frac{1}{1 - \text{MIS}} \), where MIS is the marginal propensity to save. If MIS is 0.5, the investment multiplier is 2. Thus, this is not equal to one.

---

### Option D: The balanced budget multiplier
The balanced budget multiplier is the change in income when the government increases expenditure by \( \Delta G \) and decreases taxes by \( \Delta T \) such that \( \Delta T = \Delta G \). The formula for the balanced budget multiplier is \( \frac{1}{1 - \text{MPC}} \). If MPC is 0.5, the balanced budget multiplier is 1. Thus, this is the correct answer.

---

### Option E: The aggregate demand multiplier
The aggregate demand multiplier is infinite in the short run because the aggregate demand curve is vertical. Thus, this is not equal to one.

---

### Option F: The income multiplier
The income multiplier is the same as the spending multiplier, calculated as \( \frac{1}{1 - \text{MPC}} \). If MPC is 0.5, the income multiplier is 2. Thus, this is not equal to one.

---

### Option G: The investment multiplier
The investment multiplier is calculated as \( \frac{1}{1 - \text{MIS}} \). If MIS is 0.5, the investment multiplier is 2. However, the balanced budget multiplier, which is the change in income when the government increases expenditure by \( \Delta G \) and decreases taxes by \( \Delta T \) such that \( \Delta T = \Delta G \), is 1. Thus, this is the correct answer.
