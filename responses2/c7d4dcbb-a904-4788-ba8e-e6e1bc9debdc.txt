Question:

When comparing investment projects:

Options:

A: The NPV will always agree with IRR metric
B: The ranking of projects by NPV is invariant to changes in the market rate
C: We should use a single metric, like the NPV or the IRR, to have a coherent comparison

F: The ranking of projects by NPV and IRR is always consistent regardless of the market rate
G: The NPV and IRR will always provide the same project ranking
H: The IRR will always agree with NPV metric
I: The ranking of projects by IRR is invariant to changes in the market rate
J: The market rate doesn't affect the ranking of the projects

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about investment projects and comparing their NPV and IRR metrics. Let me think about each option carefully.

The question is asking which statements are true when comparing investment projects. The options are A to J, each making a different claim about NPV and IRR.

First, I'll go through each option one by one.

Option A: "The NPV will always agree with IRR metric." Hmm. I remember that NPV and IRR can sometimes give different rankings. Like, if a project's IRR is higher than the discount rate, it might be considered better, but if NPV is positive, it's acceptable. But I think when NPV is positive, IRR might still be higher, but I'm not sure if they always agree. Maybe sometimes they can differ. So A might not be correct.

Option B: "The ranking of projects by NPV is invariant to changes in the market rate." Invariant means it doesn't change. So if the market rate changes, does NPV ranking stay the same? I think the NPV formula is PV = CF / (1 + r)^t. So if r increases, the denominator gets bigger, so PV decreases. Thus, NPV depends on r. So changing the market rate would change NPV. So B says the ranking remains the same. That doesn't sound right. So B is incorrect.

Option C: "We should use a single metric, like the NPV or the IRR, to have a coherent comparison." Well, I know that NPV is generally preferred because it considers the time value of money and reflects the actual return. IRR is another metric but can be misleading because it doesn't account for scale or reinvestment opportunities. So using both to compare is better, but the statement says "we should use a single metric," which is true, but is that the best approach? Maybe that's not the most accurate statement. Well, this is a choice; the question is whether the statement is correct. So C is correct.

Option D: "The IRR is always superior to the NPV for comparing projects." No, IRR isn't always better. It depends on the project's cash flows. For example, if a project has a negative NPV but a high IRR, the IRR might not be the right choice. So D is incorrect.

Option E: "The IRR never changes the ranking of the projects." Wait, if the market rate changes, IRR could change. For example, if a project's IRR is 20%, and the market rate increases to 25%, the IRR would drop, maybe to 15%. So the ranking would change. So E is incorrect.

Option F: "The ranking of projects by NPV and IRR is always consistent regardless of the market rate." From what I recall, NPV and IRR rankings can be inconsistent if the market rate changes. For instance, a project might be positive NPV and have a high IRR, but if the market rate increases, both might change. So F is incorrect.

Option G: "The NPV and IRR will always provide the same project ranking." No, they don't always agree. Like in some cases with mutually exclusive projects or different scales, their rankings can differ. So G is incorrect.

Option H: "The IRR will always agree with NPV metric." No, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So H is incorrect.

Option I: "The ranking of projects by IRR is invariant to changes in the market rate." Wait, same as option B, but I think this is about IRR's ranking. Since IRR depends on the market rate, the ranking would change if the rate changes. So I is incorrect.

Option J: "The market rate doesn't affect the ranking of the projects." So the market rate isn't a factor in the ranking. That's correct because the rankings are based on NPV, which is market-dependent. So J is correct.

So the correct options are C and J.

Wait, let me double-check. 

Looking back, I think I made a mistake. Option B: The ranking by NPV is invariant. As I thought, NPV does depend on the market rate, so the ranking changes. Therefore, B is incorrect. Similarly, I think J is correct because market rate doesn't affect NPV ranking. So, the correct options are C and J.

The correct answers are C and J.

**C: We should use a single metric, like the NPV or the IRR, to have a coherent comparison.**  
This is correct because while both NPV and IRR are valuable metrics, using a single one (like NPV) is generally preferred for a more consistent comparison.

**J: The market rate doesn't affect the ranking of the projects.**  
This is correct because the ranking of projects is determined by NPV, which is directly influenced by the market rate.

**Other options are incorrect:**  
- **A:** NPV does not always agree with IRR because their rankings can differ depending on the discount rate.  
- **B:** NPV ranking does change with the market rate, so the ranking is not invariant.  
- **D, E, F, G, H, I:** Incorrect because they describe scenarios where NPV and IRR rankings may conflict or change, or they do not always agree.  

ANSWER: C, J
