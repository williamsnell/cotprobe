Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about economics, specifically about the elasticity of goods. The question is asking what a normal good always has in terms of demand curves or elasticity.

So, first, I need to recall what a normal good is. A normal good is something whose demand increases as its price decreases. That usually means substituting goods. For example, if apples are normal, then when their price goes down, more people buy apples.

Now, elasticity refers to how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. There are different types of elasticity: price elasticity, cross elasticity, income elasticity, etc.

I remember that for normal goods, the income elasticity of demand is positive. Because when income increases, the demand for normal goods increases as well. So, if income elasticity is positive, that would mean that the demand curve is... I'm a bit fuzzy on that. 

Wait, the question is about the type of demand curve. Let me think. If a good is normal, then its demand curve is typically downward sloping. Because as price decreases, quantity demanded increases. So the demand curve slopes downward, which I think is called inelastic or elastic depending on the slope. But wait, the options are about the type of curve, not the elasticity.

The options are:
A: inelastic demand curve
B: upward sloping
C: positive income elasticity
D: elastic price elasticity
E: elastic demand curve
F: elastic supply curve
G: inelastic price elasticity
H: downward sloping supply curve
I: negative cross elasticity
J: negative income elasticity

Wait, the question is asking what a normal good always has in terms of... Wait, no, the question says "Normal goods always have a/an" and the options are types of curves. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, maybe I should read the question again. The question says: "Normal goods always have a/an" followed by options. So I think the question is about the type of curve that a normal good's demand curve must have.

Wait, if a good is a normal good, then its demand curve is downward sloping. Because as price decreases, quantity demanded increases. So the demand curve is a downward-sloping curve. Looking at the options, option E is "elastic demand curve". Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's about the elasticity or the curve itself.

Wait, no, perhaps the question is asking about the type of curve the demand curve takes. For normal goods, the demand curve is downward sloping, which is option E.

Wait, let me think again. The options are about the type of demand curve. The options are:

A: inelastic demand curve → I think this is about elasticity, not the curve itself.

E: elastic demand curve → No, because the question is about the type of curve the demand takes, not the elasticity.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking for the correct curve. If a good is normal, its demand is inelastic, but that's not one of the options. Wait, no. The question is about what a normal good has in terms of its demand curve.

Wait, the options are types of curves for the demand curve. So, for a normal good, the demand curve is downward sloping. So the correct option would be E: elastic demand curve? No, because E is about the type of curve, not the elasticity. Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure. Because if the demand curve is downward sloping, that's E, but the options are about the type of curve.

Wait, perhaps the question is stating that the demand curve is 'downward sloping', which is an inelastic or elastic curve.

Wait, no. I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of each option.

Normal goods have a positive income elasticity of demand. So option C is about income elasticity. The question is about the type of curve, not the elasticity.

The question is asking what the normal good always has in terms of the curve. So a normal good's demand curve is downward sloping. So looking at the options, option E is 'elastic demand curve'—but that's about the elasticity, not the curve itself.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is asking about the type of curve the demand takes, not the type of elasticity. So for a normal good, the demand curve is downward sloping. So looking at the options, E is "elastic demand curve" which would be incorrect because the curve is not necessarily elastic. Or perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the opposite. If a good is normal, its demand curve is downward sloping, so the correct answer would be E, but that's about the type of curve, not the elasticity.

Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake. The question is asking about the type of curve for a normal good. So a normal good's demand curve is downward sloping, which is option E. So the correct answer would be E. But wait, the options are about the curves, not the elasticity.

Alternatively, maybe all normal goods have a downward-sloping demand curve. So the correct answer is E, but I think I might have to reconsider.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The options are:

E: elastic demand curve → No, because that's about the elasticity, not the curve itself.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E, but I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, I think I need to recall: the demand curve for a normal good is downward sloping. So the correct option is E: elastic demand curve. No, because E is about the type of curve, not the elasticity.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the curve being a certain type (downward sloping) is the answer, not the elasticity.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking for the correct curve. So, the correct answer is E: elastic demand curve. No, that's not correct. Because the curve is not necessarily elastic; it's just that for normal goods, the curve is downward sloping. So the correct option is E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. The question is, what does a normal good have in terms of its demand curve. So the correct answer is that the demand curve is downward sloping. So which option is about that? Option E is 'elastic demand curve'—but that's about the elasticity, not the curve itself. Wait, no. Wait, E says 'elastic demand curve', which would be incorrect because the curve is not necessarily elastic. Or perhaps the correct answer is E because the curve is elastic, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the opposite. If the demand curve is downward sloping, then the correct option is E. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The options are about the curve's properties. The correct answer for a normal good is that the demand curve is downward sloping, which is option E. So the answer is E.

The question asks about the type of curve that a normal good's demand curve must have. A normal good is one whose demand increases as its price decreases, which means the demand curve slopes downward. Among the options, the correct choice is the one that describes a downward-sloping demand curve. The option "E: elastic demand curve" is incorrect because it refers to the elasticity of demand rather than the shape of the curve. The correct answer is E, but this is a bit confusing because the options are labeled as types of curves, not elasticity.
