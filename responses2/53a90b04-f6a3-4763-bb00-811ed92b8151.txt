Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about familial hypercholesterolaemia. I'm a bit rusty on my cardiovascular diseases, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that hypercholesterolaemia is a condition where the cholesterol levels in the body are too high. It's often caused by genetic factors. Familial hypercholesterolaemia would mean that the problem is inherited from both parents.

I think about the genes involved. Hypercholesterolaemia is linked to the APOBECs, which are lipoprotein chaperones. Wait, what's the breakdown of these? There's Apo E, Apo B, Apo C, and Apo D. I've heard that Apo E is important in cholesterol transport.

Oh, right! Apo E is a type of cholesterol transporter. It's called the low density lipoprotein receptor, which is a receptor on the cell surface of red blood cells. This receptor helps transport cholesterol into the bloodstream. So when Apo E mutations occur, the body can't properly transport cholesterol, leading to high levels in the blood.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia is often caused by mutations in Apo E. So the gene question is about Apo E. Looking at the options, option E is Apolipoprotein E. That must be the correct answer.

The correct answer is **E: Apolipoprotein E**. Familial hypercholesterolaemia is caused by mutations in Apolipoprotein E (Apo E), which plays a crucial role in cholesterol transport in the bloodstream.

Answer: E
