Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure out whether the demand for chocolate bars is elastic or inelastic. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that Mr. Krinsky sells chocolate bars at 25 cents each and sells 100 of them per week. Then, if he drops the price to 20 cents, his sales increase to 110 per week. The question is whether the demand is elastic or inelastic.

Hmm, I remember that elasticity measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. If the quantity demanded changes a lot when the price changes, demand is elastic. If it's not too responsive, it's inelastic.

The formula for price elasticity of demand is (Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded) divided by (Percentage Change in Price). But wait, sometimes it's presented as |(Q2 - Q1)/(Q1) * (P1 - P2)/(P2)|. Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused between the formulas. Let me think again.

So, the initial price is 25 cents, and the quantity is 100. After the price drop to 20, the quantity increases to 110.

First, let's calculate the percentage change in quantity demanded. The change is 110 - 100 = 10. So, 10/100 is 0.1, which is a 10% increase.

Now the percentage change in price. The price went from 25 to 20. The change is -5 cents, so 5/25 is 0.2 or 20% decrease.

So, putting it into the formula: (10%) / (20%) = 0.5. The absolute value would be 0.5. So, the elasticity is 0.5.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I got the formula right. Another way to think about it is if the elasticity is greater than 1, it's elastic. If less than 1, inelastic. Oh right! If the elasticity is between 0 and 1, demand is inelastic. If it's greater than 1, demand is elastic.

In this case, the elasticity is 0.5, which is less than 1. So, demand is inelastic. So the correct answer is B: Elastic at 25 cents, Inelastic at 20 cents. Wait, no, no, because the problem is asking whether the demand is elastic or inelastic overall, not at different prices. Wait, the question is phrased as "is the demand for chocolate bars elastic or inelastic?" So, it's the same demand curve, but the price change is 25 to 20, leading to 10% increase in quantity. So, the elasticity is 0.5, which is inelastic.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem is asking about the demand's elasticity overall, not at different points. So, the elasticity is 0.5, meaning it's inelastic. So, the right answer is B: Elastic at 25 cents, Inelastic at 20 cents? Wait, no, the question is about whether the demand is elastic or inelastic overall. So, the elasticity is 0.5, which is inelastic. So the right answer would be that the demand is inelastic, so the correct choice is B: Elastic at 25 cents, Inelastic at 20 cents. Wait, no, the options are a bit different.

Looking back at the options:

A: Elastic

B: Elastic at 25, Inelastic at 20

C: Inelastic

D: Perfectly Elastic

E: Perfectly Elastic at 20, Inelastic at 25

F: Relatively Elastic

G: Unit Elastic

H: Unit Inelastic

I: Perfectly Inelastic

Wait, the options are a bit unclear. Let me read them again:

The options are labeled A to I, each representing a different scenario. So, for example, option B says "Elastic at 25 cents, Inelastic at 20 cents." But I'm not sure if that's the correct way to phrase the question.

Wait, but the question is whether the demand is elastic or inelastic overall, not at different prices. So the price change is 25 to 20, leading to an increase in quantity. So the elasticity is inelastic, so the answer is B: Elastic at 25 cents, Inelastic at 20 cents. Wait, no, because the elasticity is calculated across the entire price range. Oh, but in this case, the price change is a specific change from 25 to 20. So the elasticity is inelastic, but the options are presented as whether the demand is elastic or inelastic at different prices. So the question is phrased as "is the demand for chocolate bars elastic or inelastic?" So when the price drops from 25 to 20, the demand becomes more inelastic. Wait, no, the demand overall is inelastic because the percentage change in quantity is less than the percentage change in price.

Wait no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the elasticity at the point where the price is 25 cents and then at 20 cents. Wait, the question states that at 25 cents, he sells 100, and at 20, 110. But the question is about the elasticity for the entire demand curve. So the elasticity is calculated as the same point, perhaps. Or is it considering the elasticity at each price?

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: Mr. Krinsky drops his price from 25 to 20, and his sales increase. So, the demand's elasticity is computed based on this change. So, when the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases. So, in this case, the demand is inelastic because the percentage change in quantity is smaller than the percentage change in price.

So, the correct answer would be that the demand is inelastic because the percentage change in quantity is less than the percentage change in price. Looking at the options, option B says "Elastic at 25 cents, Inelastic at 20 cents." Wait, that sounds odd because elasticity is a characteristic of the entire demand curve. But perhaps the question is considering the elasticity at those specific price points. Alternatively, maybe the question is about whether the demand is elastic or inelastic at those specific prices.

Wait, if the price drops, but the quantity increases, but we don't know whether that's a 'point' elasticity or a 'arc' elasticity. Wait, arc elasticity uses the same percentage change in price and quantity across two points. But in this case, the price is dropping from 25 to 20, so the quantity increases from 100 to 110.

But for arc elasticity, the formula is (Q2 - Q1)/(Q2 + Q1) divided by (P2 - P1)/(P2 + P1). Let me compute that.

Q change: 110-100=10. Q average: (110+100)/2=105.

P change: -5 (from 25 to 20). P average: (25+20)/2=22.5.

So, arc elasticity is (10/105) / (5/22.5) = (0.0952) / (0.2222) ≈ 0.4286. So approximately 0.43. That's less than 1, so inelastic. So the arc elasticity is inelastic. So, the correct answer is B: Elastic at 25 cents, Inelastic at 20 cents? Wait, no, because the question is about whether the demand is elastic or inelastic overall, but the options don't seem to have that. The options are about the elasticity at the specific prices.

Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let's re-express the problem: When the price is 25, quantity is 100. When price is 20, quantity is 110. So, when the price drops, the quantity increases. So, the demand curve is such that when price decreases, quantity increases, but the elasticity (point elasticity) is inelastic because the percentage change in quantity is less than the percentage change in price.

So, when the price drops from 25 to 20, the demand becomes more inelastic. The question is, is the demand elastic or inelastic in general, or is it at those specific points.

Wait, the question is phrased as "Is the demand for chocolate bars elastic or inelastic?" So, it's about the overall elasticity of the demand curve. So, in this case, the price elasticity is 0.5, which is less than 1, so inelastic. So the correct answer would be B: Elastic at 25 cents, Inelastic at 20 cents. Wait, no, because the question isn't about the elasticity at different points but about the overall elasticity. So, the correct answer is that the demand is inelastic because the price elasticity is less than 1. So, the answer is B: Elastic at 25, Inelastic at 20, but that doesn't make sense because elasticity is a property of the entire curve, not just at a point. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking whether the demand curve is elastic or inelastic at those specific points. Wait, but the question doesn't specify that. So maybe the correct answer is that the demand is inelastic because the elasticity is 0.5.

Wait, let me look at the options again. The options are A to I. The correct choice is B: Elastic at 25, Inelastic at 20. Wait, no. Because when you drop the price, the demand becomes more inelastic. But the question is about the overall elasticity. So, if the price changes, the quantity changes, and the elasticity is 0.5, which is inelastic. So the correct answer is that the demand is inelastic overall. So, the correct answer would be B: Elastic at 25, Inelastic at 20. No, that can't be because the elasticity is calculated across the entire curve, not just at a point.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think of another approach. The formula for price elasticity is (change in quantity) / (change in price) * (P/Q). So, the percentage change in quantity is (100-110)/100 *100% = -10%. The percentage change in price is (20-25)/25 *100% = -20%.

So, elasticity is (-10%) / (-20%) = 0.5. So, 0.5, which is less than 1, meaning inelastic. So, the correct answer is that the demand is inelastic. Looking at the options, G is Unit Inelastic. Wait, no, wait. The options might be mislabeled. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Elastic

B: Elastic at 25, Inelastic at 20

C: Inelastic

D: Perfectly Elastic

E: Perfectly Elastic at 20, Inelastic at 25

F: Relatively Elastic

G: Unit Elastic

H: Unit Inelastic

I: Perfectly Inelastic

So, the correct answer is inelastic, which would be option C or G. Wait, option C says 'Inelastic', which would be correct. But I'm a bit confused because the problem is about whether the demand is elastic or inelastic at those specific points. Wait, but the question isn't about that. The question is about whether the demand is elastic or inelastic in general. So, the correct answer is G: Unit Inelastic. No, wait, no. Because the elasticity is 0.5, so it's inelastic, not unit elastic. Unit elastic is when elasticity is 1.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate using the arc elasticity. Earlier, I found the arc elasticity to be approximately 0.43, which is less than 1, so inelastic. So, the correct answer is that the demand is inelastic. Looking at the options, option C says 'Inelastic', which would be correct. So, the answer is C.

The question involves determining whether the demand for chocolate bars is elastic or inelastic based on a price change. The initial price is $25 with a quantity sold of 100, and after lowering the price to $20, the quantity sold increases to 110. The price elasticity of demand is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Price Elasticity of Demand} = \left| \frac{\text{Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\text{Percentage Change in Price}} \right|
\]

### Step 1: Calculate Percentage Changes
- **Quantity Change**: 110 - 100 = 10 → 10/100 = 10% increase.
- **Price Change**: 20 - 25 = -5 → 5/25 = 20% decrease.

### Step 2: Compute Elasticity
\[
\text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{10\%}{20\%} = 0.5
\]

Since the elasticity is less than 1, the demand is **inelastic**.

### Step 3: Analyze Options
- **Option C: Inelastic** — This matches the calculated elasticity of 0.5, indicating inelastic demand.
