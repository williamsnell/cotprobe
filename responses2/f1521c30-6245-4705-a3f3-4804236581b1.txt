Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the determinant of two matrices A and B, each of which is a 2x2 and 3x3 matrix respectively. Then I have to add those two determinants together to get the sum. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand what matrix A looks like. The problem says that matrix A is a 2x2 matrix where each entry (i,j) is equal to i + j. So, for a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2. Wait, or are they 0-based? Hmm, usually in math, it's 1-based, so I think i and j run from 1 to 2. Let me list them out.

For matrix A:
- The entry at (1,1) would be 1+1 = 2.
- (1,2) is 1+2 = 3.
- (2,1) is 2+1 = 3.
- (2,2) is 2+2 = 4.

So matrix A is:
[2  3]
[3  4]

Now, I need to find the determinant of A. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] is ad - bc. So applying that formula here:

detA = (2)(4) - (3)(3) = 8 - 9 = -1.

Wait, that's -1. Hmm, I think that's right.

Now moving on to matrix B. It's a 3x3 matrix where each entry (i,j) is equal to i + j. So, the indices i and j can be 1, 2, or 3. Let me list out all the entries.

Matrix B will be:

Row 1 (i=1):
(1,1)=1+1=2
(1,2)=1+2=3
(1,3)=1+3=4

Row 2 (i=2):
(2,1)=2+1=3
(2,2)=2+2=4
(2,3)=2+3=5

Row 3 (i=3):
(3,1)=3+1=4
(3,2)=3+2=5
(3,3)=3+3=6

So matrix B is:

[2 3 4]
[3 4 5]
[4 5 6]

Wait, that looks familiar. I think this is a special kind of matrix where each diagonal element is equal to 2, 4, 6? Wait no, let me check the diagonal entries.

Actually, for the main diagonal (where i=j), the entries are 2, 4, 6. Hmm, that's 2, 4, 6, but let me think about the structure.

Another way to see this is that each row is an arithmetic sequence. For example, row 1 is 2,3,4; row 2 is 3,4,5; and row 3 is 4,5,6. So each row increases by 1. Wait, actually, in each row, the entries increase by 1 starting from the first element. For instance, row 1 starts at 2 and each next element is +1. Similarly for the other rows.

But wait, that would mean that each row is a linear sequence, so perhaps the matrix represents a linear transformation with a certain rank. But for determinants, maybe I should compute it directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can use row operations to make the matrix upper triangular or something, but that might be tedious for a 3x3. Alternatively, I can use the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Let me pick the cofactor expansion.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the determinant using the formula for a 3x3. The determinant is calculated as:

detB = b11*b22*b33 + b12*(-b21*b33 + b23*b31) + b13*(b21*b32 - b22*b31)

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step. Alternatively, perhaps I can subtract rows to simplify.

Actually, let me think. Another approach: the matrix B can be written as the sum of a matrix of ones and a diagonal matrix. Because each entry is i + j, which can be written as i*1 + j*1. Wait, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, maybe I can express B as the sum of a matrix of 1s and another matrix where each element is (i)(j) or something.

Wait, perhaps I can think of B as the sum of the outer product of two vectors. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the determinant using the properties of the matrix.

Wait, another approach: compute the determinant using the rule of Sarrus or maybe expand along the first row.

Let me try the cofactor expansion along the first row. The determinant is:

detB = 2*det[[4,5],[5,6]] - 3*det[[3,5],[4,6]] + 4*det[[3,4],[4,5]]

Wait, let me compute each minor:

First term: 2 * determinant of the submatrix when removing row 1 and column 1. That submatrix is:

[4,5]
[5,6]

The determinant is 4*6 -5*5 = 24 -25 = -1.

So first term: 2*(-1) = -2.

Second term: -3 * determinant of the submatrix when removing row 1 and column 2. That submatrix is:

[3,5]
[4,6]

The determinant is 3*6 -5*4 = 18-20 = -2.

So second term: -3*(-2) = +6.

Third term: +4 * determinant of the submatrix when removing row 1 and column 3. That submatrix is:

[3,4]
[4,5]

The determinant is 3*5 -4*4 =15-16 = -1.

So third term: 4*(-1) = -4.

Now add all terms together: -2 +6 -4 = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So detB is 0.

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me recompute each minor:

First minor (2x2 matrix [4,5;5,6]) determinant is (4*6) - (5*5) = 24 -25 = -1. So first term is 2*(-1) = -2.

Second minor: [3,5;4,6] determinant is (3*6) - (5*4) = 18-20 = -2. So second term is -3*(-2) = +6.

Third minor: [3,4;4,5] determinant is (3*5) - (4*4) =15-16 = -1. Third term is 4*(-1) = -4.

So sum is (-2) +6 + (-4) = 0.

Hmm, so detB is zero. That seems correct. So detA is -1, detB is 0. So the sum is -1 + 0 = -1.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in calculating the minors.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs during the cofactor expansion. Let me double-check.

The cofactor expansion along the first row (i=1) is:

detB = a11*C11 + a12*C12 + a13*C13

Where C11 is the cofactor, which is (-1)^(1+1) * M11, where M11 is the minor.

So:

C11 = (+1) * det[[4,5],[5,6]] = 1*(-1) = -1.

C12 = (-1)^(1+2) * det[[3,5],[4,6]] = (-1)*(-2) = +2.

C13 = (+1) * det[[3,4],[4,5]] = 1*(-1) = -1.

So the determinant is a11*C11 + a12*C12 + a13*C13.

So:

detB = 2*(-1) + 3*(2) +4*(-1) = (-2) +6 + (-4) = 0.

Yes, that's correct.

So detA is -1, detB is 0. Sum is -1 + 0 = -1.

Looking back at the options given, the choices are:

A: -3
B: 3
C: -1
D: 0
E: -4
F: 4
G:5
H: -2
I:2
J:1

So the sum is -1, which is option C.
</think>

The sum of the determinants is computed as follows: For matrix A (2x2), detA = -1. For matrix B (3x3), detB = 0. Thus, the sum is -1 + 0 = -1.
