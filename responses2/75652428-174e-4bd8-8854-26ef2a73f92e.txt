Okay, so I've got this question about the bulk modulus of elasticity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me think through it.

The question says a liquid is compressed in a cylinder. Initially, it's at 1 MN/m² and has a volume of 1 liter, which is 1000 cm³. Then, when compressed further, the pressure increases to 2 MN/m² and the volume decreases to 995 cm³. They're asking for the bulk modulus.

Wait, what's bulk modulus? Oh right, bulk modulus measures the resistance of a substance to compression. The formula for bulk modulus is K = -ΔP * V_avg / ΔV. Or wait, no, the formula I remember is K equals the change in pressure times the initial volume divided by the change in volume. Oh wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me get this straight.

So, the formula for bulk modulus K is K = (P) * (V_initial) / (ΔV). Or is that right? Wait, no, wait. The definition is that when pressure increases by ΔP, the volume decreases by ΔV. Bulk modulus is the ratio of the change in pressure to the change in volume (but considering the negative because volume decreases). Or wait, the exact formula might be K = - (ΔP) * V_avg / ΔV. Hmm, I need to get the signs right.

Wait, the standard formula for bulk modulus is K = (P) * (V_initial) / (ΔV). Because when pressure increases, volume decreases, so ΔV is negative. So K would be positive because the negatives would cancel? Or wait, let's think about the derivation.

The bulk modulus is defined as the ratio of the applied pressure to the relative volume change. So, K = -P * (V_initial) / (ΔV). Wait, no, wait. Another way to write it is K = - (ΔP) * V_avg / ΔV. Alternatively, when pressure increases by ΔP, the volume decreases by ΔV. So, the change in volume is negative, because volume is decreasing. So ΔV = V_initial - V_final.

Wait, let me make it concrete. Let me write down the given data.

Initial pressure (P₁) = 1 MN/m², initial volume (V₁) = 1000 cm³.

Final pressure (P₂) = 2 MN/m², final volume (V₂) = 995 cm³.

So, the change in pressure ΔP is P₂ - P₁ = 1 MN/m².

The change in volume ΔV is V₂ - V₁. Wait, no. Wait, when you compress, volume decreases, so the change in volume is negative. So ΔV = V₁ - V₂. Because V₂ is less than V₁.

So, ΔV = 1000 - 995 = 5 cm³. Wait, but wait, wait. Because the volume decreases, so the change in volume is negative. So ΔV = V₁ - V₂ = 5 cm³. Wait, but wait, the units. The pressure is in MN/m², which is N/m², or Pascals? Because 1 MN is 1,000,000 N; 1 m² is 1 m². So 1 MN/m² is 10^6 N/m², which is 1 MPa (since 1 MPa is 1e6 N/m²). Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 N/m² is 1 Pascals. 1 MPa is 1e6 Pa. So, 1 MN/m² is 1e6 N/m² = 1 MPa. So, in the question, the pressures are in MN/m², which is 1e6 N/m². So P₁ is 1 MPa, P₂ is 2 MPa. The change in pressure is 1 MPa.

The change in volume is V₁ - V₂ = 1000 - 995 = 5 cm³. Since volume is decreasing, ΔV is -5 cm³. But in the formula, do I use the absolute value? I think not. Let's see.

So, the formula for bulk modulus is K = (ΔP) * (V₁) / (ΔV). Or wait, maybe K = (P_avg) * V_avg / ΔV. No, wait, perhaps it's K = (P) * V_avg / (ΔV), but I'm getting myself confused.

Alternatively, the formula is K = (P) * (V_initial) / (ΔV), but I'm not sure. Let me think about the units. Because if the volume change is 5 cm³, and the pressure is 1 MPa, then the units would be (MPa) * (cm³) / (cm³) — which is MPa. But since 1 MPa is 1e6 Pa, but I think the answer is in MPa, which is 1e6 Pa. So the options are in MPa. So let me proceed.

Wait, perhaps the formula is K = (P) * V_initial / (V_initial - V_final), because V_initial is 1000 and V_final is 995.

Wait, the correct formula for bulk modulus when you have two different states is K = (ΔP) * V_avg / (ΔV), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is K = (P) * V_initial / (V_initial - V_final).

Wait, I think I should look it up. Oh wait, I can't look things up, but I need to remember.

Wait, the formula is K = (P) * V_avg / (ΔV), where V_avg is the average volume. Or wait, maybe K = (P) * (V_initial) / (ΔV). No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let me think about what delta V is. The change in volume is V_final - V_initial? Or the other way around. Oh wait, when you apply a pressure, the volume decreases. So the change in volume (ΔV) is V_initial - V_final.

So, for example, if from V_initial to V_final, ΔV = V_initial - V_final = 1000 - 995 = 5 cm³.

So, ΔV = 5 cm³. Since when the pressure increases, the volume decreases, so ΔV is negative. But in the formula, I think it's the absolute value of ΔV, or perhaps it doesn't matter because it's a ratio.

So, let's plug the numbers into the formula.

K = (P) * V_avg / (ΔV).

Wait, perhaps the formula is K = (P) * V_avg / (delta V). But wait, is V_avg the average volume or the initial volume? Alternatively, perhaps it's K = (P) * V_initial / (V_initial - V_final). Because at initial state, the volume is V_initial, and the change is V_initial - V_final.

Wait, let me think about the equation.

The formula for bulk modulus is K = - (ΔP) * V_avg / (ΔV). But I'm not sure about the signs. Alternatively, another approach is to think about the definition.

Bulk modulus K is defined as the ratio of the applied pressure (ΔP) to the relative volume change (ΔV / V_avg), but with a negative sign to account for the decrease in volume. So K = - (ΔP) * V_avg / (ΔV).

Wait, no, perhaps it's K = - (ΔP) * (V_initial) / (ΔV). Because when pressure increases, volume decreases. So K would be positive, as pressure and volume change in opposite directions.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is K = (P_initial) * V_initial / (V_initial - V_final). Let's compute that.

So, P_initial = 1 MPa (since 1 MN/m² is 1 MPa? Wait, no. Wait, 1 MN/m² is 1 MN per square meter. 1 MN is 1e6 N. So 1 MN/m² is 1e6 N/m², which is 1 MPa. So P_initial is 1 MPa.

V_initial is 1000 cm³.

V_final is 995 cm³. So ΔV = V_initial - V_final = 1000 - 995 = 5 cm³.

So, K = (1 MPa) * (1000 cm³) / (5 cm³) = (1e6 Pa) * (1e3 cm³) / (5 cm³) ?

Wait, wait, let me convert the units correctly. Because 1 MPa is 1e6 Pa. And volume is in cm³, which is 1e-6 m³.

But wait, let's think of the units. Let me see:

MPa is 1e6 N/m². cm³ is 1e-6 m³.

So, 1 MPa = 1e6 N/m².

V_initial = 1000 cm³ = 1000 * 1e-6 m³ = 1e-3 m³.

ΔV = 5 cm³ = 5 * 1e-6 m³ = 5e-6 m³.

So, putting into K:

K = (1e6 N/m²) * (1e-3 m³) / (5e-6 m³) = (1e6 * 1e-3)/(5e-6) (N/m² * m³ / m³) → N/m², which is Pa.

So compute the numbers:

1e6 * 1e-3 = 1e3.

Divide by 5e-6: 1e3 / 5e-6 = (1e3) / (5e-6) = (1e9)/(5) = 2e8.

Wait, that can't be right because 2e8 Pa is 200 MPa, which is one of the options. But wait, looking at the options, option I is 100 Mpa, H is 200 Mpa.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the units. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1 MPa is 1e6 N/m². 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³. So:

K = (1e6 N/m²) * (1e-3 m³) / (5e-6 m³)

Calculate numerator: 1e6 * 1e-3 = 1e3.

Divide by 5e-6: 1e3 / 5e-6 = (1e3) / (5e-6) = (1e3) / (5 * 1e-6) )= (1e3) / (5e-6) )= (1e9)/(5) )= 2e8 N/m² → 200 MPa.

But wait, none of the options have 200 MPa except option H: 200 Mpa.

Wait, but let me check the initial data again. Wait, the initial pressure was 1 MN/m², which is 1 MPa. The final is 2 MN/m², which is 2 MPa.

Wait, wait, wait, no. 2 MN/m² is 2 MPa. So the pressure increases by 1 MPa.

So, in the formula, ΔP is 1 MPa.

So, K = (1 MPa ) * (1000 cm³) / (5 cm³) ) = (1e3) / 5 = 200 MPa.

Hmm, but the options don't have 200 MPa. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 400 Mpa

B: 600

C:750

D:150

E:500

F:250

G:350

H:200

I:100

J:300

So, H is 200 Mpa. Right, that's what I got.

Wait, but wait, did I use the correct formula? Because earlier, when I thought about the formula, I thought that when pressure increases, volume decreases, so the change in volume is negative. So, if I use K = (ΔP) * V_avg / ΔV, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is K = (P) * V_avg / (V_avg - V_final).

Wait, let me think again. The correct formula for bulk modulus is:

K = - (ΔP) * V_avg / (ΔV)

But wait, the negative sign is because when pressure increases (ΔP positive), the volume decreases (ΔV negative). So, K would be positive.

So:

K = (ΔP) * V_avg / (ΔV) → but since ΔV is negative (because volume decreases), perhaps the formula is K = (ΔP) * V_avg / (-ΔV_abs), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is K = (P) * V_avg / (V_initial - V_final).

So, in this case, V_initial - V_final is 5 cm³. So,

K = (1 MPa) * (1000 cm³) / (5 cm³) = (1e3) /5= 200 MPa.

But the options have 200 Mpa as option H. So that's the answer. Thus, the correct answer would be option H: 200 Mpa.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the change in volume is 5 cm³, which is a decrease. So, when I plug into the formula, the denominator is 5 cm³. So, the K calculation seems correct.

Wait, but according to the options, H is 200 Mpa. So, the answer should be H.

To determine the bulk modulus of elasticity for the given liquid compression, we use the formula:

\[
K = \frac{\Delta P \cdot V_{\text{avg}}}{\Delta V}
\]

### Step 1: Identify the given data
- **Initial pressure (P₁):** \(1 \, \text{MN/m}^2 = 1 \, \text{MPa}\)
- **Initial volume (V₁):** \(1000 \, \text{cm}^3\)
- **Final pressure (P₂):** \(2 \, \text{MN/m}^2 = 2 \, \text{MPa}\)
- **Final volume (V₂):** \(995 \, \text{cm}^3\)

### Step 2: Calculate the change in pressure and volume
- **Change in pressure (\(\Delta P\)):** 
  \[
  \Delta P = P₂ - P₁ = 2 \, \text{MPa} - 1 \, \text{MPa} = 1 \, \text{MPa}
  \]
- **Change in volume (\(\Delta V\)):** 
  \[
  \Delta V = V₁ - V₂ = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 - 995 \, \text{cm}^3 = 5 \, \text{cm}^3
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the bulk modulus
The bulk modulus formula is:
\[
K = \frac{\Delta P \cdot V_{\text{avg}}}{\Delta V}
\]
Here, \(V_{\text{avg}}\) is the average volume. Since the volume decreases, we use the initial volume:
\[
V_{\text{avg}} = V₁ = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
K = \frac{1 \, \text{MPa} \cdot 1000 \, \text{cm}^3}{5 \, \text{cm}^3} = \frac{1000}{5} = 200 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated bulk modulus is \(200 \, \text{MPa}\), which corresponds to option H.
