Okay, so I've got this genetics question here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the likelihood of an individual having two specific alleles with a certain frequency in a population. The options are all probabilities ranging from 0.02 to 0.24. 

Hmm, so the question says that each allele has a frequency of 0.2. Wait, allele frequency is the proportion of a particular allele in a population. So each allele is present in 20% of the population. But wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, no. Because each individual has two alleles for most genes, right? So if allele A has a frequency of 0.2, that means 20% of all alleles in the population are A. But since each individual has two alleles, the allele frequency is calculated as (number of A alleles)/(total alleles). So for a diploid organism, the frequency is (2 * number of A alleles) / total alleles.

Wait, but wait, the question states each allele has a frequency of 0.2. So the total alleles in the population would be 2N, where N is the population size. Or wait, each individual has two alleles, so the allele frequency is (number of the allele) divided by (number of alleles per individual times the number of individuals). So if the allele frequency is 0.2, then the number of that allele is 0.2 * 2N. So the allele count is 0.4N. 

But the question is about the likelihood of an individual having two specific alleles. So the chance that a person has both alleles is the product of the probabilities if the alleles are independent. But wait, what are the alleles in question? Are they the same allele (homozygous) or different (heterozygous)? The question says "two specific alleles of a human DNA marker." Oh, so these are two different alleles. So it's a heterozygous case. 

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. If an individual has two alleles, each with a frequency of 0.2, then each allele is present in the population at 20% frequency. But wait, that can't be right because in the population, each individual has two alleles. So the frequency of each allele is (number of that allele) / (number of alleles per individual * population size). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, no, allele frequency is the proportion of alleles in the population. So if each allele has frequency 0.2, that means 20% of the population has that allele. But wait, each individual has two alleles, so the total alleles in the population are 2N. So the total number of allele A's is 0.2 * 2N = 0.4N. Similarly for allele B. 

But the question is about the probability that a particular individual has both alleles A and B. Are these alleles the same (homozygous) or different (heterozygous)? Oh, the question doesn't specify, but it's a DNA marker, which is usually a single locus. Wait, wait, wait. Or is it a single allele? No, a DNA marker for a locus would be a single allele. So perhaps each allele in the marker is present at a frequency of 0.2. So the marker is a specific allele, say A.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: "the likelihood of an individual in a population carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker, each of which has a frequency of 0.2." So the individual has two alleles of a marker, each with frequency 0.2. So the marker is a specific allele, like A, and the person has two copies of A? Or is the marker a specific allele, and the individual has two alleles of that specific marker, perhaps one of each type?

Wait, perhaps it's a single locus. So the two alleles are the same. So the individual is heterozygous for that allele. Alternatively, the two alleles are different, but each has frequency 0.2.

Wait, but the question says "two specific alleles." So perhaps the two alleles are different. So for example, the person has allele X and allele Y, each with frequency 0.2.

But wait, in a general case, when someone has two specific alleles, they can either be homozygous for one (two copies of one allele) or heterozygous (one copy each of two different alleles). 

Wait, but the question is about the likelihood of having two specific alleles. So the way to compute that is probability. So if the two alleles are the same, the probability of having both is (frequency of allele)^2. But if the two alleles are different, the probability would be the product of the frequencies only if they are independent. But wait, the alleles are linked or not? Hmm, perhaps the question is assuming that the alleles are independent for this calculation.

Wait, but the problem says each allele has a frequency of 0.2. So if the two alleles are present in the population at 0.2 each, and they are different, the chance of a person having both would be 0.2 * 0.2, but only if the alleles are independent. However, the presence of one allele might affect the presence of another (like linked genes). But the question doesn't specify whether the alleles are linked or not. 

Wait, but the question is about the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles. So for that, I think the assumption is that the two alleles are independent. So the probability is (0.2) * (0.2) = 0.04. But wait, that would be the case if the alleles are independent. But if they're linked, the probability might be different, like 0.2 * (0.2 - some effect), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the question says each allele has a frequency of 0.2. So perhaps the alleles are independent. So the chance of having one is 0.2, the other is 0.2, so the combined probability is 0.04. Looking at the options, H is 0.08 and I is 0.08. Wait, no. Wait, the options are:

A:0.24

B:0.4

C:0.32

D:0.1

E:0.16

F:0.12

G:0.02

H:0.04

I:0.08

J:0.06

Wait, option H is 0.04. So if the two alleles are independent, the probability would be 0.04. So that would be option H. But wait, the question says two specific alleles. So if the two alleles are the same, the probability of having two of them would be (0.2)^2, but if the two are different, it's 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04. But wait, wait, that's the same as before. So regardless of whether the two alleles are the same or different, it's 0.04. But that can't be right because when two identical alleles are present, the chance of having both is 0.2^2 * N, but perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, no. Because the question is about the probability of a single individual having both alleles. So for a person to have two alleles, each of which has a frequency of 0.2, and if they are different, then the chance is 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04. So the correct answer would be H: 0.04. But the options don't have another 0.04. Wait, looking back, the options are as given. So the correct answer is H:0.04.

Wait, but I should think again. Alternatively, if the alleles are the same, then the chance of having two is (0.2)^2 * N? No, because each individual has two alleles, so the number of ways to have two A alleles is C(2,2) =1. But the probability is (frequency of A)^2 * (number of ways) / (number of possible combinations). Wait, but each individual has two alleles, each allele is present with a frequency of 0.2. So the probability of having two A alleles is (0.2)^2 * (number of ways) / (total number of alleles possible). Wait, but each individual has two alleles, so the total number of alleles is 2. So the number of possible combinations is (2 choose 2) = 1. So the probability is (0.2)^2 = 0.04. But that's the same as before. So whether the two alleles are the same or different, the probability is 0.04. So the correct answer is option H, 0.04.

The question asks for the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker, each with a frequency of 0.2. Each allele in the population has a frequency of 0.2, meaning 20% of the population has that allele. Since each individual has two alleles, the probability of having two specific alleles (either the same or different) is calculated as follows:

1. If the two alleles are the same (homozygous), the probability of having two of them is \((0.2)^2 = 0.04\).
2. If the two alleles are different (heterozygous), the probability is also \((0.2) \times (0.2) = 0.04\), assuming independent assortment.

In both cases, the probability of carrying two specific alleles is 0.04. Among the provided options, this corresponds to option H: 0.04.
