Okay, so I've got this question here about proportions. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking which pair of ratios can form a proportion. The options are A to H, each with two ratios.

First, I remember that for two ratios to form a proportion, they must be equivalent. That means the cross products should be equal. So, for two ratios a/b and c/d to form a proportion, a*d should equal b*c.

Looking at the options, each pair has two fractions. I'll need to check each pair to see if the cross products are equal.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: 2/5 and 4/25. Let's compute cross products. 2*25=50, 5*4=20. 50 vs 20. Not equal, so A is out.

Option B: 2/5 and 5/10. Cross products: 2*10=20, 5*5=25. 20 vs 25. Not equal. So B isn't right.

Option C: 2/5 and 10/15. Let me calculate. 2*15=30, 5*10=50. 30≠50. Nope, so C is not a proportion.

Option D: 2/5 and 10/20. Cross products: 2*20=40, 5*10=50. 40≠50. So D isn't correct either.

Option E: 2/5 and 3/8. Let's see: 2*8=16, 5*3=15. 16≠15. Doesn't work. So E is out.

Option F: 2/5 and 7/14. Cross products: 2*14=28, 5*7=35. 28≠35. Not a proportion.

Option G: 2/5 and 6/15. Calculating cross products: 2*15=30, 5*6=30. Oh, 30=30! So G is a proportion. Wait, let me double-check. 6/15 simplifies to 2/5, so yes, they are the same.

Option H: 2/5 and 8/10. Let's check cross products: 2*10=20, 5*8=40. 20≠40. So H isn't a proportion.

Wait, did I make a mistake with H? Let me recalculate. 8/10 simplifies to 4/5. 2/5 is not equal to 4/5, so no. So the only pair that works is G: 2/5 and 6/15.

The correct answer is G, as 2/5 equals 6/15.

Answer: G
