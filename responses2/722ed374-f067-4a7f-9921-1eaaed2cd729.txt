Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation to solve, and I need to find the positive difference between its two solutions. The equation given is 2x² +5x +12 = 19 -7x. Hmm, right. Let me start by rearranging it into the standard quadratic form.

First, I'll move all terms to one side. So subtract (19 -7x) from both sides. That gives me 2x² +5x +12 -19 +7x = 0. Wait, let me check that: yes, because I subtracted 19 and added 7x. So combining like terms, 5x +7x is 12x, and 12 -19 is -7. So the equation becomes 2x² +12x -7 = 0.

Now, I remember that for a quadratic equation ax² +bx +c = 0, the solutions are given by the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a). But since the question asks for the positive difference between the solutions, I don't need to find each solution individually. Instead, I can use the formula for the difference directly.

I recall that the difference between the roots is sqrt(b² -4ac)/a. Wait, no. Let me think. The two solutions are (-b + sqrt(d))/(2a) and (-b - sqrt(d))/(2a), where d is b² -4ac. So subtracting these gives [(-b + sqrt(d)) - (-b - sqrt(d))]/(2a). The -b terms cancel, and 2 sqrt(d)/2a remains. So the difference is sqrt(d)/a.

Wait, but sqrt(d) is sqrt(b² -4ac). So the positive difference is sqrt(b² -4ac)/a. So the key here is to compute the discriminant first, which is b² -4ac.

In our equation, a=2, b=12, c=-7. So discriminant D = (12)^2 -4*2*(-7). Let's calculate that. 12 squared is 144. 4*2 is 8, times -7 is -56. So D is 144 - (-56) which is 144 +56. 144 +56 is 200. So discriminant D is 200.

Now, the positive difference is sqrt(D)/a. sqrt(200) is sqrt(100*2) which is 10*sqrt(2). Then, a is 2, so 10 sqrt(2) divided by 2 is 5 sqrt(2). So the positive difference is 5 sqrt(2), which is option H.

The equation is rearranged to standard form: 2x² +12x -7 = 0. The positive difference between the solutions is sqrt(D)/a, where D is the discriminant (b² -4ac) and a=2. Calculating D: 12² -4*2*(-7) = 144 +56 = 200. Thus, sqrt(200) = 10√2, and dividing by 2 gives 5√2. The answer is H.

Answer: H
