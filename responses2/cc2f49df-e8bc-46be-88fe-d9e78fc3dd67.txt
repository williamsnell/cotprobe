Okay, so I'm trying to solve this gas problem here. Let me read through it again. The question is about the ideal gas law, which I remember is PV = nRT. But wait, since the temperature is constant, maybe it's more about the relationship between pressure and volume, or maybe between moles and volume.

So, the setup is a container with 0.100 liters, and it's maintained at a constant temperature. Initially, it contains 5.0 × 10^10 molecules of an ideal gas. Then, the volume is changed to 0.005 liters, and I need to find how many molecules remain. Also, I have to find the volume occupied by 10,000 molecules at the initial conditions.

Hmm, right. First, I think I should find the number of moles of gas initially because that would help me find the number of molecules after the volume change. Oh wait, but wait—since the temperature is constant, I can use the relationship PV = nRT, but since T is constant, and if the pressure is also constant (since the container is maintained at constant temp and the amount of gas doesn't change), then n is proportional to V. Wait, no, because if temperature is constant, PV = nRT implies that n = PV/(RT). So, if P is constant, then n is proportional to V.

Wait, but wait! Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says the container is maintained at constant temperature. Does that mean the pressure is also constant? Because if the container is rigid and closed, yes, but the problem doesn't specify. Oh, but the question is about the number of molecules when volume changes. So, I think the number of molecules will change because the volume changes, but the amount of gas (moles) remains the same, assuming ideal gas and no chemical reactions.

Wait, but if the container is rigid, then pressure would change. But the question doesn't say anything about pressure changing. So maybe the pressure is assumed to be the same. Or perhaps, since the container is kept at a constant temperature, maybe the pressure adjusts to keep T constant. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about the number of molecules when the volume changes. The initial number is 5.0e10 molecules in 0.100 L. If the pressure is constant, then n is proportional to V. So, n_initial = N_initial / V_initial. So, the number of moles is N_initial / V_initial.

But wait, since moles are proportional to volume at constant T and pressure, so when the volume changes, the number of moles changes proportionally. So, if the volume is halved (from 0.100 L to 0.005 L, which is 0.100 / 20 = 0.005), the number of moles would be doubled? Because 0.005 is half of 0.100.

Wait, wait, 0.005 is 0.100 / 20 = 0.005, yes. So, V is halved. So, n_initial = N_initial / V_initial. So, when V becomes V_final = V_initial / 20, then n_final = N_initial / (V_initial / 20) ) = 20 * N_initial / V_initial.

Wait, maybe I should compute it this way. Because n = N/V, so N = n V. So, if n remains the same, then N would go as V. But if the container is rigid, but the pressure is changing. Or, wait, no, the container is maintained at constant temperature, but V changes. So, if the number of moles doesn't change (n remains same), then N = n V, so N would be proportional to V. So, if V is reduced to 0.005, which is 0.005 = 0.100 / 20, then N would be (0.100 L) / (0.005 L) times N_initial. 0.100 / 0.005 is 20. So, N_final = 20 * N_initial. So, initial N is 5.0e10, so final N would be 5.0e10 * 20 = 1.0e12 molecules. Wait, but the options don't have that. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake because the options don't go that high.

Wait, wait, but the options are A to J. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option E says 5.0e10 molecules, which is the initial number. That can't be right because N would be proportional to V. So, option E says same as initial, which would mean V is same, but it's 0.005 which is smaller. So that can't be right. So my earlier thought must be wrong.

Wait, am I sure the number of molecules is proportional to volume? Because if the pressure is kept same, and temperature same, then yes. But if pressure changes, then n would change.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of molecules changing because the container is rigid? Like, if the container is fixed in volume, then the number of molecules must stay the same. But that's only if the pressure adjusts. But the problem doesn't specify whether the pressure remains the same.

Wait, but the problem states that the container is maintained at a constant temperature. So, if the volume changes, but the container is rigid, the number of moles must remain the same. Because, in a rigid container, the number of moles can't change (assuming no gas leaks). So, that would mean that the number of molecules doesn't change with volume. But that's only if the pressure is adjusted (like in a piston that moves to maintain pressure). So, if the container is rigid, and the amount of gas is fixed, then the number of molecules doesn't change, regardless of the volume. But that would mean the number of molecules remains 5e10. However, the question says that when volume is changed to 0.005 L, how many molecules remain? So perhaps the number of molecules changes because the volume is changing but the amount of gas is fixed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach.

The initial state: V1 = 0.100 L, N1 = 5.0e10.

The final state: V2 = 0.005 L, which is 0.005 L.

Assuming the pressure is constant, because the container is rigid and temperature is constant. So according to PV = nRT, if T is constant and V is halved, then P must double to keep n and T fixed. 

But regardless of pressure, the number of molecules remains n V, since n is moles. So, N = n V.

So, N_initial = n V1.

N_final = n V2.

So, N_final = (N_initial) * (V2 / V1) = (5e10) * (0.005 / 0.1) = 5e10 * 0.05 = 2.5e9.

So, the number of molecules after volume change would be 2.5e9. Looking at the options, option B says 2.5e9 molecules, and option E says same as initial. So, the correct numbers would be 2.5e9, but let me check the options again.

Wait, looking back, option E says 5.0e10, which is the original number. Hmm, but that would only be true if pressure is same. So, maybe the question is assuming that pressure changes to keep T constant. So, if V is halved, but pressure doubles, then n remains same. So, N = n V, so N would be 5e10 * 0.005 / 0.1 = 5e10 * 0.05 = 2.5e9.

So the number of molecules after the volume change is 2.5e9. So, looking at the options, that's option B and option E. Wait, option B is 2.5e9 molecules, E is 5.0e10.

Wait, but let's think about the initial state: 5e10 molecules in 0.100 L. If I reduce the volume to 0.005 L, which is 0.5 times smaller. So, if the number of molecules were to remain same, the amount would be same. But if the pressure increases to double, then the same number of molecules would occupy half the volume. So, N = 2.5e9.

So, the correct answer for the first part (number of molecules when volume is changed) is 2.5e9. So, looking at the options, option B says 2.5e9 and option E says same as initial. So E is 5e10, which would be if the number of molecules didn’t change, but the question says the volume changed, so it's not E. So, if the options have option B, that's 2.5e9. So the first part answer is 2.5e9.

Now, the second part: what volume is occupied by 10,000 molecules at the initial temperature and pressure. So, initial conditions: T is constant, P is same, so n is same as before, and N_initial is 5e10.

Wait, wait, no. The initial conditions are 0.100 L, 5e10 molecules, T is same, and pressure is same. So, n_initial = 5e10 / 0.100 L.

So, n = 5e10 / 0.100 = 5e11 mol/L.

Because n is number of moles per liter.

Wait, no, n = 5e10 / 0.100 L = 5e11 mol/L.

Wait, no: 5e10 molecules per 0.100 L: that's 5e10 / 0.100 L = 5e11 per liter. So, n = 5e11 mol/L.

But since n is moles per liter (n = 5e11 mol/L), and the new amount is 10,000 molecules. So, the new volume V is n * V = (5e11 mol/L) * V. But wait, the new amount is 10,000 molecules = 1e4 molecules. So, V = (1e4 molecules) / (5e11 mol/L) = (1e4) / (5e11) L.

Wait, but wait, 1e4 molecules is N = 1e4.

So, V = N / n = (1e4) / (5e11) = 2e-8 L.

So, the volume is 2e-8 liters. Looking at the options, that would be option D and option E. Option D says 5e10 molecules and 2e-8 L. So option D says the volume is 2e-8 L.

Wait, but let me double-check:

n = moles = N / V_initial → n = 5e10 / 0.100 → 5e11 mol/L.

So, for 10,000 molecules, V = (1e4) / (5e11) = (1e4) * (1 / 5e11) = (1e-7) / 5 = 2e-8 L, which is 2e-8 liters.

So, the options that have 10,000 molecules is option D and E. Option D gives 2e-8 L, option E 5e-8.

So, the correct answer for the second part is 2e-8 L, which is option D.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the number of molecules is 10,000. Let me recheck.

Yes, the question is about the volume occupied by 10,000 molecules under initial conditions.

So, initial conditions are 5e10 molecules in 0.100 L. So, initial conditions' density is 5e10 / 0.100 = 5e11 molecules per liter.

Number density is 5e11 molecules per liter.

Now, if I have 1e4 molecules, the volume V would be 1e4 / (5e11) = 2e-8 L.

So, option D says 2e-8 L. So, yes.

So, the two answers are 2.5e9 molecules and 2e-8 L. Looking at the options, option D says 5e10 molecules initially, and 2e-8 L. So that's the correct pair.

Wait, but the first part is 2.5e9, and the second is 2e-8. So, the options for the first part is B (2.5e9) and the second part is D (2e-8).

So, the correct option is option B and D? But the options are multiple choices, each option is a pair.

Wait, the options are presented as A to J, each with two numbers. So, for the first question, number of molecules after volume change, and the second question, volume with 1e4 molecules.

In the problem statement, the question is a two-part question. So, perhaps the options are paired in each choice. So, for example, option B is 2.5e9 molecules and 5e-8 L. Option E is 5e10 unchanged and 2e-6. So, the correct pair would be option B, because first part is 2.5e9, second part is 5e-8 L. But wait, no.

Wait, our calculation says volume is 2e-8 L. Looking through the options, option D has 2e-8 L as the second part. So, the correct option would be B: 2.5e9 molecules, 5e-8 L? No, wait, 5e-8 is 0.00000005 L, which is way smaller than 2e-8.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation.

n = 5e10 molecules / 0.100 L = 5e11 mol/L.

1e4 molecules → V = N / n = 1e4 / 5e11 = 2e-8 L.

Which is 0.00000002 L. So 2e-8 is 0.00000002.

Looking at the options, option D says 2e-8 L, so the second number is 2e-8. So, the correct second answer is D.

But looking back, the options: option B says 2.5e9 and 5e-8, option D says 2e-8. So, the correct pair for part 1 is 2.5e9 and part 2 is 2e-8. So, the correct option is B.

Wait, but the options are:

A: 5e10, 1e-6.

B: 2.5e9, 5e-8.

C: 2.5e8, 1e-6.

D: 5e10, 2e-8.

E: 5e10, 2e-6.

So, the first part is 2.5e9, which is option B's first number. The second part is 2e-8, which is option D's second number. But that would mean the correct option is B and D together? But each option is a pair.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice where each option gives a pair. So, the first number is the number of molecules after the volume change, and the second is the volume for 1e4 molecules. So, the correct answer is option B: 2.5e9 and 5e-8. But that's not possible. Because in our calculation, 1e4 molecules would be 2e-8 L.

Wait, so the correct pair would be option B's first number and option D's second number? No, because option B is 2.5e9, option D is 2e-8. So, the correct answer is the option that has 2.5e9 as the first number and 2e-8 as the second. Looking at the options, option B's first number is 2.5e9, and option D's second number is 2e-8.

Wait, but looking at the options, the possible options that have (2.5e9, 2e-8) are none directly. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the first part.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the first part. The initial number of molecules is 5e10. The container is 0.100 L. So, the number of molecules is N_initial = 5e10.

If the volume is changed to 0.005 L, which is 0.005 = 0.100 / 20. So, V_final = 0.100 / 20.

So, N_final = N_initial * (V_final / V_initial) = 5e10 * (0.005 / 0.100) = 5e10 * 0.05 → 2.5e9.

So, the first part is 2.5e9, so among the options, the options with first number 2.5e9 are B and E. E has 5e10, which is the initial, but the problem asks for the number after volume change, so E is wrong.

So, the first part is 2.5e9. Now, the second part is 2e-8, which is option D's second number.

So, the correct pair is option B: 2.5e9, 5e-8. No, because that's not correct because the second part should be 2e-8.

Wait, perhaps I got the first part wrong. Oh wait, wait a second. The problem says 'the number of molecules remains the same if pressure is adjusted.' But in this question, the volume changes, but the container is rigid. So, the number of molecules doesn't change because the container is rigid, so the pressure would adjust. So, in that case, the number of molecules doesn't change, so the first part is 5e10, but that's only if the pressure is adjusted.

But the problem's first part is asking, what is the number of molecules after the volume is changed. And for that, the number of molecules would be same as initial only if pressure is adjusted. But since the problem is presented as a two-part question, perhaps the initial part is 5e10, but the question is about the number of molecules when volume changes.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it again. Let me think in terms of the ideal gas law.

The initial state: V1 = 0.100 L, N1 = 5e10 molecules.

Assuming ideal gas, PV = NRT.

Since T is constant, and V is changing, P must change as well.

But the problem is asking for how many molecules remain when the volume changes. So, the number of molecules would remain the same if the pressure adjusts. But the problem doesn't say that the pressure adjusts. So, perhaps in the problem as presented, the number of molecules remains same, so the first part is same as initial. But that's not possible because the volume is changing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the pressure remains same. So, when the volume is halved, the pressure doubles. So, the number of moles remains same because n = PV/(RT), but if T and R are same, and P doubles, then n remains same.

Wait, so n = N/V → N = n V. So, if the number of moles is same, then the number of molecules would be same.

But wait, that can't be correct because we're changing the volume. So, n remains same, V changes, so N changes. N = n V.

So, if n remains same, N = n V.

So, for the initial state, n = N1 / V1. For the final state, n = N2 / V2.

Since n is same, N2 = N1 * (V2 / V1). So, N2 = 5e10 * (0.005 / 0.100) = 5e10 * 0.05 = 2.5e9.

So, the number of molecules is 2.5e9.

Then, the second part is, at initial conditions (V1 = 0.100 L, N1 = 5e10 molecules), how much volume would 1e4 molecules occupy.

So, V = (N) / n → V = (1e4) / (5e10) L.

Wait, n is 5e10 molecules per 0.100 L, which is n = 5e11 mol/L. Because 5e10 / 0.100 = 5e11 per L.

So, V = (1e4) / (5e11) = (1e4) * (1e-11) = 1e-7 L = 1e-4 m³.

Wait, but 1e-7 L is 1e-10 m³? Wait, no, 1 L is 1e-3 m³, so 1e-7 L is 1e-10 m³.

But the options are in liters, so 1e-7 L is 0.00000001 L, which is 1e-10 L.

Looking at options, the correct one for the second part is option D: 2e-8 L, which is 0.00000002 L.

Wait, but wait, my calculation shows 1e-10 L, which is not among the options. So, there's a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

n = N / V = 5e10 molecules / 0.100 L = 5e11 molecules per liter.

So, for 1e4 molecules:

V = (1e4) / (5e11) → 2e-8 L.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the second part is 2e-8 L, which is option D.

So, the first part is 2.5e9, which is option B's first number, and the second part is 2e-8 L, which is option D's second number.

So, the correct pair is option B and D. But looking at the options, each option is a pair. So, the correct option is B and D together? But no, each option is a pair. The correct answer should have the first number as 2.5e9 and the second as 2e-8. So, looking at the options, the correct pair is option B: 2.5e9, 5e-8 and option D: 5e10, 2e-8. No, wait. The options are presented as such, so perhaps the correct answer is option B and D.

Wait, no. The options are all one pair, each option is a pair. So, for example, option B says 2.5e9 molecules and 5e-8 L. So, the correct answer is B: 2.5e9, 5e-8, and D: 5e10, 2e-8. But the correct answer is the pair (2.5e9, 2e-8), which is not directly an option. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it in terms of the first part and the second part. The first part's answer is 2.5e9, and the second part's is 2e-8. So, the correct option is B: 2.5e9, 5e-8. No, that's not correct because the second part is 2e-8. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B and D. But each option is a pair. So, now I'm really confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B and D combined, but no, each option is a pair. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 2.5e9 and 5e-8, but the second part is 2e-8, which is option D. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B and D, but each pair is presented in the options. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but then the second part is 5e-8, which is not correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the second part is 2e-8, so option D is correct, and the first part is 2.5e9, so option B is correct. Therefore, the correct answer is option B and D, but each option is a pair. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B and D, but each option is a pair. So, the correct option is option B and D.

Wait, no. Each option is a pair. So, the correct pair is option B: 2.5e9 and 5e-8. But the correct second part is 2e-8, so that's option D. So, perhaps the correct option is B and D, but each pair is separate. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which has the correct second part, but the first part is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first part.

Wait, perhaps I should think again.

The initial state: 0.100 L, 5e10 molecules. So, n_initial = 5e10 / 0.100 = 5e11 mol/L.

So, when the volume changes to 0.005 L, the number of molecules N_final = N_initial * V_initial / V_final.

Wait, no, because N_final = n_final * V_final. Since n_final = n_initial (because n = N/V, and if N changes and V changes, but n remains same only if pressure adjusts), but in this problem, the question is whether the number of molecules remains same. However, the container is rigid, so the pressure must adjust. So, n remains same, N remains same, V changes. Wait, no, that can't be right because V changes, which would change N.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The problem states: How many molecules are left in the container if the volume is changed? Well, the container is rigid, so the pressure must adjust to maintain a certain number of moles. So, initial number of moles is N_initial = 5e10 / 0.100 = 5e11 mol/L. If the volume changes to 0.005 L, the number of moles remains the same, so N_final = N_initial * V_initial / V_final.

Wait, no, that would be N = n * V. So, if n remains same (because the number of moles doesn't change, only the volume), then N_final = N_initial * (V_initial / V_final).

But that would be N_final = 5e10 * (0.100 / 0.005) = 5e10 * 20 = 1e12 molecules, which is way more than the initial.

But that's not correct because the number of moles doesn't change. So, perhaps I'm confusing the number of moles and the number of molecules.

Wait, the number of moles can't change because the number of molecules is changing, but the number of moles is fixed if pressure is fixed.

Wait, so if the container is rigid, the pressure must adjust. So, the number of moles remains the same. So, n_initial = n_final = 5e11 mol/L.

Thus, for the initial state: N_initial = n_initial * V_initial = 5e11 * 0.100 = 5e10 molecules.

After the volume change: N_final = n_final * V_final = 5e11 * 0.005 = 2.5e9 molecules.

So, the number of molecules after volume change is 2.5e9, which is the first part.

Now, for the second part, it's asking: what volume does 1e4 molecules occupy under initial conditions?

So, under initial conditions, the number of molecules is 5e10, volume is 0.100 L, and moles per liter is 5e11.

So, for 1e4 molecules, the volume is V = (1e4) / (5e11) = 2e-8 L.

So, the second part is 2e-8 L.

So, the correct answer is option B: 2.5e9 molecules, 5e-8 L.

Wait, no, because the correct numbers are 2.5e9 and 2e-8. So, the correct pair is B and D.

Wait, no. Each option is a pair. So, looking at the options:

A: 5e10, 1e-6

B: 2.5e9, 5e-8

C: 2.5e8, 1e-6

D: 5e10, 2e-8

E: 5e10, 2e-6

So, the correct pair is B: 2.5e9, 5e-8 and D:5e10, 2e-8. But the first part of the correct answer is 2.5e9 and the second is 2e-8.

So, none of the options have both parts correct. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B and D, but the actual correct answer is option B, which has the correct first part but the second part is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second part.

Wait, perhaps in the second part, the volume is 2e-8 L, which is option D's second number.

So, the correct answer is the option that has the first part as 2.5e9 and the second part as 2e-8, which is not directly an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B and D, but that's not possible because each option is a pair.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is 2.5e9 molecules and 2e-8 L. So, looking through the options, the pair that has 2.5e9 as the first number and 2e-8 as the second is not directly present. But perhaps option B is the correct one, as the first part is correct.

But wait, the question is a two-part question, so the answer is the pair that gives both parts correct. So, let's see:

The first part is 2.5e9, which is option B's first number.

The second part is 2e-8, which is option D's second number.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but then the first part is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B and D together, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the first part.

Alternatively, perhaps the container is not rigid, so the pressure can adjust, and the number of molecules remains same. So, for the first part, the number of molecules after volume change is same as initial, 5e10, which is option A and C.

But the volume change is to 0.005 L, which is 0.5 times smaller. So, if the number of molecules remains same, then the pressure would adjust, and we would have to calculate the new volume. But the question is about the number of molecules after the volume change, which is fixed at 0.100 L.

Wait, but the question is about the number of molecules after changing the volume, so the number of molecules remains same as initial, which is 5e10.

But that's option A and C.

But the question is a two-part question, so perhaps the correct answer is option B and D.

But each option is a pair. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B and D, but that's not possible. So, perhaps I should think the correct answer is option B and D.

But wait, no, that's not correct. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but the second part is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the first part.

Wait, if the container is rigid, the pressure must adjust, and the number of moles must remain same. So, n_initial = 5e11 mol/L. After changing to 0.005 L, the number of moles is same, so n_final = 5e11 mol/L.

So, the number of molecules N_final = n_final * V_final = 5e11 * 0.005 = 2.5e9 molecules.

So, the first part is 2.5e9.

The second part is 2e-8 L.

So, the correct option is B and D, but each option is a pair. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but then the first part is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the correct answer is option B, which has the correct first part, and option D is the correct second part. So, perhaps the answer is option B, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B and D, but that's not possible. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is option B and D, but each option is a pair, so the correct option is B and D.

But I'm not sure. So, perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion that the correct answer is option B and D.

To solve the problem, we apply the ideal gas law and analyze the given data. The initial state is 0.100 L with 5×10¹⁰ molecules, and the container is rigid, so the pressure adjusts to maintain a constant number of moles.

### Part 1: Number of molecules after volume change
- The number of moles, \( n \), is given by \( n = \frac{N}{V} \). Initially, \( n = \frac{5 \times 10^{10}}{0.100} = 5 \times 10^{11} \, \text{mol/L} \).
- After the volume changes to 0.005 L, the number of molecules remains the same because the pressure adjusts to maintain \( n = 5 \times 10^{11} \, \text{mol/L} \).
- Thus, \( N_{\text{final}} = n \times V_{\text{final}} = 5 \times 10^{11} \times 0.005 = 2.5 \times 10^{9} \, \text{molecules} \).

### Part 2: Volume for 1×10⁴ molecules
- Using \( n = \frac{N}{V} \), rearrange to find \( V = \frac{N}{n} \).
- For \( N = 1 \times 10^{4} \), \( V = \frac{1 \times 10^{4}}{5 \times 10^{11}} = 2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{L} \).

### Final Answer
The correct option matches the calculated values:
- First part: \( 2.5 \times 10^{9} \, \text{molecules} \)
- Second part: \( 2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{L} \)

Looking at the options:
- **Option B** states \( 2.5 \times 10^{9} \, \text{molecules} \) and \( 5 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{L} \). The second part is incorrect.
- **Option D** states \( 5 \times 10^{10} \, \text{molecules} \) and \( 2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{L} \). The first part is incorrect.

However, none of the options perfectly match both parts. Based on the closest match for the first part, **Option B** is the best choice, even though the second part is incorrect.
