Options:

A: Equal to the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because total mechanical energy must be conserved.
B: Equal to zero, because the object loses all its energy due to the roughness of the incline.
C: Less than the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the work done by the friction force must be greater than the block’s gain in kinetic energy.
D: Greater than the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the object gains energy from the friction on the rough incline.
E: Greater than the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the kinetic energy increases as the object slides down the incline.
F: Less than the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the gravitational potential energy was converted both to thermal energy and to kinetic energy.
G: Equal to the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the object does not lose any energy while sliding down.
H: Less than the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the object loses energy due to the air resistance.
I: More than the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the object gains speed while sliding down.
J: Equal to the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the gain in kinetic energy compensates for the mechanical energy lost to thermal energy on the rough incline.

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a 1-kg object sliding down a rough incline. The question is about whether its kinetic energy at the bottom is equal to its initial gravitational potential energy or something else. Let's see.

The object starts from rest, so initial kinetic energy is zero. It slides without rotating, so only translational motion. The incline is rough, meaning there's friction. Friction would do work on the object, right? Because friction opposes motion.

Gravitational potential energy (GPE) is mgh, where h is the vertical height. At the top, it's highest, and at the bottom, it's lowest. Since it's sliding down, the GPE decreases.

When an object slides down a slope, if there were no friction, all the GPE would convert into kinetic energy (KE) at the bottom. But with friction, some energy is lost as heat (thermal energy) due to the work done by friction. So the KE at the bottom can't be equal to the initial GPE. It must be less than that because some energy turned into heat.

Wait, but let me think about the options. Option A says it's equal because total mechanical energy is conserved. No, because mechanical energy would have to include the GPE and KE. If there's friction, mechanical energy isn't conserved; some goes to heat. So A is wrong.

Option B says KE is zero because of roughness. No, because even though the object loses mechanical energy to friction, it still gains KE. So B is incorrect.

Option C says KE is less because friction does more than the gain. That makes sense because friction takes away some GPE as heat. So C is a possibility.

Option D says KE is greater because gains from friction. No, friction takes away energy, so KE should be less.

Option E says KE is greater because it gains energy from friction. No, because friction takes energy, so KE decreases.

Option F says KE is less, because both thermal and KE? Hmm, not sure. The problem is only about friction doing work. So F says gravitational PE converts to both thermal and KE. Wait, no. Wait, that's not correct. The PE converts into KE plus heat? No, wait: mgh is the initial PE. As it slides down, it converts into KE and heat. So the KE plus the heat equals the initial PE.

So KE at the bottom would be less than the initial GPE. Because some energy is lost as heat.

Looking again at the options. Option F says the PE is converted into both thermal and KE, which is not correct because the total (PE + KE) would equal the initial GPE. But the question is about KE. So F's statement is incorrect.

Option G: Equal because no energy is lost. No, because friction does energy loss.

Option H: KE is greater because gains from friction. No. Gains would mean KE increases, which it doesn't. H's wrong.

Option I: KE is more than initial GPE. No, because it's less, so I's wrong.

Option J: KE is equal because gain in KE compensates. No, because it's losing energy.

So the correct option is C: Less than the block's gravitational potential energy because the work done by friction is more than the gain in kinetic energy.

Wait, but let me think again. The work done by friction is W = force_friction * distance. The force is frictional, and friction is less than the component of weight along the incline. So the work done by friction is negative, and the energy loss is the loss in KE plus the loss in PE.

Wait, but the initial GPE is converted into KE and heat. So KE plus heat equals initial GPE. So KE is less than initial GPE.

So the KE is less than the initial GPE, and the heat is the difference. So the KE is definitely less than what it started with.

Which brings me back to option C says the KE is less because the work done by friction is more than the gain in KE. That makes sense, because the work done by friction is the sum of the KE loss and PE loss. So in terms of energy: Work done by non-conservative forces (like friction) is equal to the change in mechanical energy plus the change in heat.

Wait, another approach. The work done by non-conservative forces equals the change in mechanical energy plus the heat generated.

So W_nc = ΔKE + ΔPE + Q. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get the correct equation.

The work done by non-conservative forces (like friction) is equal to the change in kinetic energy plus the change in potential energy plus the work done as heat.

Wait, the correct formula is:

Work done by non-conservative forces = ΔKE + ΔPE + Q.

Where Q is the heat generated.

In this case, the only non-conservative force is friction. So W_friction = ΔKE + ΔPE + Q.

But wait, W_friction is negative because friction opposes motion. So the equation would be:

- |W_friction| = (KE_final - KE_initial) + (PE_final - PE_initial) + Q.

Since KE_initial is zero, and PE_final is zero (bottom), we get:

- |W_friction| = (0 - 0) + (0 - mgh) + Q.

So -W_friction = (-mgh) + Q.

So W_friction = mgh - Q.

But W_friction is the work done by friction, which is force_friction * distance. Since force_friction is opposite to displacement, W_friction is negative.

So mgh - Q is negative. So mgh < Q.

Therefore, the heat generated Q is greater than the initial mgh, so the KE is less than mgh.

So, the KE is less than the block's initial GPE, and the difference is the heat. So the correct answer must be C.

Looking at the options, option C says less because the work done by friction is more than the gain in kinetic energy. That's correct because the work done by friction is larger than the change in KE (since some goes into heat).

So the answer should be option C.

The problem involves a 1-kg object sliding down a rough incline without rotating, starting from rest at the top. The goal is to determine the relationship between the object's kinetic energy (KE) at the bottom and its initial gravitational potential energy (GPE). Since the incline is rough, friction does work on the object, which results in energy loss.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Conditions**: The object starts from rest, so its initial kinetic energy (KE) is zero. The gravitational potential energy (GPE) is maximized at the top and becomes zero at the bottom.

2. **Energy Conservation**: In the absence of friction, all GPE would convert into KE at the bottom. However, friction dissipates energy as heat, so the KE at the bottom is less than the initial GPE.

3. **Work Done by Friction**: The work done by friction is negative and is equal to the difference between the initial GPE and the heat generated:
   \[
   W_{\text{friction}} = mgh - Q
   \]
   Since friction does work, \( Q > mgh \), meaning the heat generated is greater than the initial GPE. This implies that some of the GPE is converted into KE and heat.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. Total mechanical energy is not conserved because friction dissipates energy as heat.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The object does not lose all energy due to friction; some energy is lost as heat.
   - **Option C**: Correct. The work done by friction (negative) is greater than the gain in kinetic energy, meaning the KE at the bottom is less than the initial GPE.
   - **Options D, E, F, G, H, J**: Incorrect. These options either misstate the relationship (e.g., KE is greater or equal to GPE) or imply energy loss in a way that is inconsistent with the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is that the kinetic energy at the bottom is less than the initial gravitational potential energy because the work done by friction is greater than the gain in kinetic energy.
