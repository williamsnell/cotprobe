Okay, so I've got this gas problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. 

The question says: We have 2 liters of gas at 700 mm pressure and 20°C. We need to compress it into a 0.1 liter container at -150°C. The question is asking for the pressure required after compression. The options are A to J, all in mm.

Hmm, I remember that when gases are compressed, especially under different temperatures and pressures, the ideal gas law comes into play. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, right? But since the amount of gas (n) is constant here, I can use the combined gas law which is (P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2. Wait, wait, but wait—temperature is in Kelvin, so I need to convert those temperatures to that scale.

Wait, let me make sure I get the formula correctly. The equation is P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2. Because when pressure changes, volume changes, and temperature changes, so all variables are related by this equation.

So, let's list the known values:

P1 = 700 mm. Wait, but let me think: is the pressure given in mm of what? Oh wait, pressure is in mm, which is a unit of pressure, so yes, 700 mm of some unit, but in the same unit as the other pressures. Because all are in mm, so it doesn't matter.

V1 = 2 L. V2 is the new volume, which is 0.1 L.

Temperature: T1 is 20°C. I need to convert that to Kelvin. So, 20 + 273.15 = 293.15 K. Similarly, T2 is -150°C. So, that's (-150 + 273.15) = 123.15 K.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no: T2 is -150°C. So, it's 273.15 - 150 = 123.15 K. Yeah.

So plugging into the equation:

P1 * V1 / T1 = P2 * V2 / T2

I need to solve for P2.

So,

P2 = (P1 * V1 * T2) / (V2 * T1)

Plugging the numbers in:

P2 = (700 mm * 2 L * 123.15 K) / (0.1 L * 293.15 K)

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator.

First, numerator: 700 * 2 = 1400; 1400 * 123.15. Let me compute that. 123.15 * 1400. Hmm.

123.15 * 1000 is 123150. 123.15 * 400 is 49,260. So 123150 + 49260 = 172410. So numerator is 172,410.

Denominator: 0.1 * 293.15. 0.1 * 293.15 is 29.315.

So P2 is 172410 / 29.315. Let me compute that.

Dividing 172410 by 29.315.

Well, 29.315 times 5860 is approximately:

Let me think, 29 * 5860 is 170,  but wait 29 * 5860 is 170,  let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 29.315 * 5860: let's see. 29.315 * 5000 = 146,575. 29.315 * 860 = ?

Wait, 29.315 * 800 = 23,452. 29.315 * 60 = 1,758.9. So 23,452 +1,758.9=25,210.9.

Adding to 146,575: 146,575 + 25,210.9=171,785.9. Hmm, but the numerator is 172410. So 5860 gives us 171,785.9. The difference is 172410 -171785.9=624.1. So 5860 + (624.1 /29.315) ≈ 5860 + 21.35=5881.35 mm.

Wait, but let me compute that division more accurately.

29.315 * 5860 = 171,785.9.

Our numerator is 172,410; so 172410 -171785.9=624.1.

So 624.1 / 29.315 ≈ 21.33. So P2 is approximately 5860 + 21.33 ≈ 5881.33 mm.

Looking at the options, option C is 5877, option G is 5860. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a calculation error somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recheck.

Wait, let's re-calculate the numerator and denominator.

Wait, V1 is 2 L, V2 is 0.1 L.

So, the ratio V1/V2 is 2 /0.1 =20.

The ratio T2/T1 is 123.15 /293.15 → let me compute that.

123.15 /293.15 ≈ 0.4197.

Wait, so P2 = P1 * (V1/V2) * (T2/T1) → 700 * 20 * 0.4197.

Wait, 700 *20 =14000. 14000 *0.4197 = ?

14000 *0.4 is 5600. 14000 *0.0197 is 275.8.

So total 5600 + 275.8=5875.8 mm. Approximately 5876 mm.

Looking at the options, option G is 5860, C is 5877, and option E is 5750.

Wait, but wait, my calculation gave about 5876, which is close to option C (5877) or option G (5860). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Since temperature is in Kelvin, and we're using the absolute scale, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, the temperatures: T2 is 123 K, T1 is 293 K. So T2 is lower than T1. So, the pressure should decrease, which makes sense because the volume is decreased.

Wait, so if I plug in all the numbers again:

P1 =700 mm, V1=2, T1=293 K.

V2=0.1, T2=123 K.

So P2= (700 * 2 * 123) / (0.1 * 293) → let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 700 *2 =1400; 1400 *123 = 172,200.

Denominator: 0.1*293 =29.3.

So 172,200 /29.3= ?

Let me compute 172200 ÷29.3.

Hmm, 29.3 × 5860. Let's check: 29.3 * 5860.

Wait, 29.3 * 5000 =146,500.

29.3 *800=23,440.

29.3 *60=1,758.

Adding all: 146500 +23440 =169,940 +1758=171,698.

So 5860 *29.3=171,698.

But our numerator is 172,200. So 172,200 -171,698 =502.

502 ÷29.3 ≈17.13.

So P2 ≈5860 +17.13=5877.13 mm.

So approximately 5877 mm, which would be option C, or option G (5860). But my calculation says about 5877. So C is 5877, which is option C.

Wait, but I thought earlier that 5860 is one of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is C:5877 mm.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because my calculation gives 5877.13, which is very close to 5877, so option C is 5877, which would be the correct answer.

To calculate the pressure required to compress 2 liters of gas at 700 mm of pressure and 20°C into a 0.1 liter container at -150°C, the ideal gas law is applied. The relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature is given by:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}
\]

### Known values:
- \( P_1 = 700 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( V_1 = 2 \, \text{L} \)
- \( V_2 = 0.1 \, \text{L} \)
- \( T_1 = 20^\circ \text{C} = 293.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( T_2 = -150^\circ \text{C} = 123.15 \, \text{K} \)

### Rearranging the formula to solve for \( P_2 \):
\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{V_1}{V_2} \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

### Substituting the values:
\[
P_2 = 700 \cdot \frac{2}{0.1} \cdot \frac{123.15}{293.15}
\]

### Simplifying:
- \( \frac{V_1}{V_2} = 20 \)
- \( \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{123.15}{293.15} \approx 0.4197 \)

\[
P_2 = 700 \cdot 20 \cdot 0.4197
\]

### Calculating:
\[
P_2 = 700 \cdot 20 = 14000
\]
\[
14000 \cdot 0.4197 \approx 5876 \, \text{mm}
\]

### Final result:
The pressure required is approximately \( 5877 \, \text{mm} \), which corresponds to option **C**.
