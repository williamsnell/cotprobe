Question:

A small kiosk at the Atlanta airport carries souvenirs in the price range of $3.99 to $29.99, with a mean price of $14.75. The airport authorities decide to increase the rent charged for a kiosk by 5 percent. To make up for the increased rent, the kiosk owner decides to increase the prices of all items by 50 cents. As a result, which of the following will happen?

Options:

A: The range and standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents, but the mean price will remain the same.
B: The standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents, but the mean price and the range will remain the same.
C: The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same.
D: The mean price will remain the same, but the standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents.
E: The mean price and the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.
F: The mean price and the standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents.
G: The mean price will remain the same, but the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.
H: The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the range of prices will decrease by 50 cents.
I: The mean price, the range, and the standard deviation of prices will all remain the same.
J: The range of prices will increase by 50 cents, but the mean price and the standard deviation will remain the same.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about how a kiosk owner adjusts prices after an increase in rent. Hmm, I need to figure out how the mean price, standard deviation, and range of prices change.

First, let's break down the problem. The kiosk used to have souvenir items priced between $3.99 and $29.99, with a mean of $14.75. Now, the rent increases by 5%, and the owner decides to increase all item prices by 50 cents. We need to see how these changes affect the mean, standard deviation, and range.

Let's think about the range. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest prices. Originally, the range is $29.99 - $3.99 = $26.00. After the rent increase, all prices go up by 50 cents, so the highest price becomes $29.99 + $0.50 = $30.49, and the lowest becomes $3.99 + $0.50 = $4.49. The new range is $30.49 - $4.49 = $26.00. Wait, the range didn't change. So the range stays the same. So the range remains $26, which is the same as before. So options that mention the range changing are A, E, F, J. 

Wait, but wait, in the original setup, the mean was $14.75. After adding 50 cents to all items, the mean would go up by 50 cents, right? Because every price is increased by 50 cents. So the new mean is $14.75 + $0.50 = $15.25. So the mean increases by 50 cents. So any options that say the mean increases by 50 cents are options C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

Now, looking back at the options. Let's check each one.

Option A: Range and SD increase by 50c, mean same. No, range didn't change, so A is wrong.

Option B: SD increases by 50c, but mean and range same. No, because SD increases, but range stayed same. So B is wrong.

Option C: Mean increases by 50c, SD same. No, SD increases because all prices went up by same amount, so SD remains same.

Option D: Mean same, SD increases by 50c. No, mean increased, SD same. So D is out.

Option E: Mean and range increase by 50c. No, because range stayed same. So E is wrong.

Option F: Mean and SD increase by 50c. No, mean goes up 50c, SD same.

Option G: Mean same, range increases by 50c. No, mean went up, range stayed same.

Option H: Mean up by 50c, range decreases by 50c. No, range same.

Option I: All same. No, mean and SD changed.

Option J: Range increases by 50c, but mean and SD same. No, range didn't change.

Wait, but wait another thing. The options don't have J as correct. Hmm. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, the options include F: mean and std dev increase by 50c. Wait, no, let me re-read:

Looking at the options again:

Option F: The mean price and the standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents.

Wait, but wait, the standard deviation would increase because every price is increased by same amount. So, the standard deviation is a measure of spread. Adding the same amount to all data points doesn't change the spread. So standard deviation remains same. So option F is incorrect.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, if all prices go up by 50 cents, the difference between the prices remains same. For example, original prices: 10 and 20. Adding 50 to each: 60 and 70. The range is 10 (20-10), which is same as 70-60=10. So the range remains same. So the standard deviation is calculated based on the spread. If all data points increase by a constant, the spread (variance and standard deviation) remain same. So the standard deviation doesn't change. Therefore, SD remains same, but the mean increases.

So looking at the options again:

Which options have mean increasing by 50c and SD same?

Option C: Mean increases by 50c, SD same.

Wait, but option C says "The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same." That's correct.

Wait, but option F says both mean and SD increase by 50c. Which is incorrect because SD remains same.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

C: Mean increase by 50c, SD same.

D: Mean same, SD increases by 50c.

Wait, the question is, after the rent increase, the owner increases prices by 50c. So all prices go up by 50c.

So the mean increases by 50c. The standard deviation remains same because all data points are shifted by same amount. The range remains same, as seen because adding 50c to all data points doesn't change the difference between max and min.

So the correct change is mean increases by 0.50, SD same, and range same. But looking at the options, which one matches this?

Looking at the options, option C says "The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same." That's correct.

Wait, but let me re-examine the options.

Option F: The mean and standard deviation increase by 50c. So F is wrong because SD doesn't change.

Option C: Correct.

Another point: the mean increases by 50c, but what's the SD? If all items are increased by 50c, SD remains same. So the correct option is C.
</think>

The kiosk owner increases both the rent and item prices by 50 cents. The range of prices remains unchanged because all items are uniformly shifted. The standard deviation, which measures the spread of prices, also remains the same since adding a constant to all values does not affect the spread. However, the mean price increases by 50 cents because every item is uniformly raised.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect because the range does not increase; it remains the same.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because the standard deviation does not increase; it remains the same.
- **Option C**: Correct. The mean increases by 50 cents, and the standard deviation remains unchanged.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because the mean increases, not remains the same.
- **Option E**: Incorrect because the range does not increase; it remains the same.
- **Option F**: Incorrect because the standard deviation does not increase; it remains the same.
- **Option G**: Incorrect because the mean does not remain the same; it increases.
- **Option H**: Incorrect because the range does not decrease; it remains the same.
- **Option I**: Incorrect because both the mean and standard deviation change.
- **Option J**: Incorrect because the range does not increase; it remains the same.

The correct answer is **Option C**.
