Okay, so I need to find the acceleration at time t = 5 minutes for a helicopter whose height is given by s(t) = 300t - 4t³ meters. Hmm, I remember that acceleration is the second derivative of the position function. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the position function s(t) is given. To find acceleration, I need to find the first derivative (which gives velocity) and then the second derivative (which gives acceleration).

So, let's find the first derivative. The derivative of s(t) with respect to t.

s(t) = 300t - 4t³
The derivative of 300t is 300, because the derivative of t is 1. Then, the derivative of -4t³ is -12t². So, v(t) = ds/dt = 300 - 12t². That's the velocity function.

Next, I need the acceleration, which is the derivative of velocity. So, take the derivative of v(t).

v(t) = 300 - 12t²
The derivative of 300 is 0. The derivative of -12t² is -24t. So, a(t) = dv/dt = -24t. That's the acceleration function.

Now, to find acceleration at t = 5 minutes, plug t = 5 into a(t).

a(5) = -24 * 5 = -120 m/min².

Looking at the options, the answer should be -120. Let me check the options again. Option H is -120. So the correct answer is H.

To find the acceleration at t = 5 minutes for the helicopter's height function s(t) = 300t - 4t³, we calculate the second derivative:

1. **First derivative (velocity):**  
   s'(t) = 300 - 12t²  
   v(t) = 300 - 12t²

2. **Second derivative (acceleration):**  
   a(t) = d/dt [v(t)] = -24t

3. **Acceleration at t = 5:**  
   a(5) = -24 * 5 = -120 m/min²

The correct answer is H: -120.

Answer: H
