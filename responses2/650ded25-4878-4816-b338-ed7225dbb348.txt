Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric dipole moments. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there's an electric dipole with charges of 1.50 nC separated by 6.20 micrometers. And it's placed in an electric field of 1100 N/C. They want the magnitude of the dipole moment. Oh right, dipole moment... I remember that dipole moment is a vector, pointing from negative to positive charge.

Wait, the dipole moment p is given by p = q * d, where q is the magnitude of the charge and d is the separation between them. So q is 1.50 nC. Oh wait, nC is nano, which is 1e-9. So 1.50e-9 C. And d is 6.20 micrometers. Micro is 1e-6, so 6.20e-6 meters.

So p should be 1.50e-9 C multiplied by 6.20e-6 m. Let me calculate that. 1.5 *6.2 is... 1.5 times 6 is 9, 1.5 *0.2 is 0.3; so 9+0.3=9.3. So 9.3e-15? But wait, wait, wait, let me do it more accurately.

Wait, 1.50 times 6.20 is 9.3, yes. So 1.50e-9 *6.20e-6 = (1.5 *6.2) * (1e-9 *1e-6) ) =9.3e-15.

Looking at the options, option H is 11.10e-15. Oh wait, no, wait. No, wait. Option H is 11.10 ×10^-15, which is 1.11e-14. But I'm getting 9.3e-15, which would be option H? Wait no, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 8.50e-15

B: 13.20e-15

C:4.60e-15

D:6.20e-15

E:7.40e-15

F:5.50e-15

G:12.00e-15

H:11.10e-15

I:9.30e-15

J:10.20e-15

Wait, wait, the calculation I did gave 9.3e-15, which is 9.3 × 10^-15, which would be option I. But wait, looking at the options, option I is 9.30 × 10^-15. So H is 11.10e-15, which is 1.11e-14, which is way bigger. Wait, no, wait, 1.5 *6.2 is 9.3, not 11.1. So why is H there?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. Oh! Wait, did I mix up the units? Oh wait, 1.50 nC is 1.50e-9 C, and 6.20 micrometers is 6.20e-6 meters. So 1.5e-9 *6.2e-6 = (1.5*6.2) * (1e-9 *1e-6) = 9.3e-15, yes. So option I is 9.30e-15. But looking at the options, option I is 9.30e-15, which would be the correct answer.

Wait but the options don't have 9.30e-15 as correct. Let me look again. Oh, option I is 9.30e-15. So that's option I. But wait, the options are labeled A to J. So the correct answer is I, which is option I.

Wait, but wait, the options are given as A to J, and I is one of them. So according to my calculation, the answer is I. But looking at the options, the H option is 11.10e-15, which would be 1.11e-14. But that's not what I calculated. So why is there an option with 11.10e-15?

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the setup. Oh, wait, perhaps I mixed up the units. Oh! Wait, 6.20 micrometers is 6.20e-6 meters, correct. 1.50nC is 1.50e-9 C. So 1.5e-9 *6.2e-6 = (1.5*6.2) =9.3, so 9.3e-15, which is 9.3 ×10^-15 C·m, option I.

Wait, but the options are:

H:11.10e-15 → which is 1.11e-14 → no, that's not the same as our calculation. So none of the options match 9.3e-15 except option I.

Wait, but wait, looking back, the question says the electric dipole consists of charges of 1.50 nC separated by 6.20 μm. So yes, q is 1.5e-9, d is 6.2e-6.

So the dipole moment p = q*d → 1.5e-9 *6.2e-6 → 1.5 *6.2 =9.3 → 9.3e-15, which is 9.3 × 10^-15.

Looking at the options, option I is 9.30e-15. So the answer should be option I. Oh wait, but the options are labeled A to J, and the user lists options from A to J. So the correct option is I.

But looking back, the options are:

A: 8.50e-15

B:13.20e-15

C:4.60e-15

D:6.20e-15

E:7.40e-15

F:5.50e-15

G:12.00e-15

H:11.10e-15

I:9.30e-15

J:10.20e-15

So the correct answer is H? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1.50 times 6.20 is 9.3. So option I is 9.30e-15, which is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is there. So the correct answer is option I, which is 9.30e-15 C·m. But looking at the options, option I is 9.30e-15, so that's the one.

To determine the magnitude of the electric dipole moment, we use the formula:

\[
p = q \cdot d
\]

where \( q \) is the magnitude of the charge and \( d \) is the separation between the charges. The given values are:

- \( q = 1.50 \, \mathrm{nC} = 1.50 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C} \)
- \( d = 6.20 \, \mu\mathrm{m} = 6.20 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m} \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
p = (1.50 \times 10^{-9}) \cdot (6.20 \times 10^{-6}) = (1.50 \cdot 6.20) \cdot (10^{-9} \cdot 10^{-6}) = 9.3 \cdot 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m}
\]

Thus, the magnitude of the electric dipole moment is \( 9.30 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m} \).

Now, comparing this result with the options provided:

- **Option A:** \( 8.50 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option B:** \( 13.20 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option C:** \( 4.60 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option D:** \( 6.20 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option E:** \( 7.40 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option F:** \( 5.50 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option G:** \( 12.00 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option H:** \( 11.10 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option I:** \( 9.30 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m} \) — Correct.
- **Option J:** \( 10.20 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m} \) — Incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option I**, which corresponds to \( 9.30 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m} \).
