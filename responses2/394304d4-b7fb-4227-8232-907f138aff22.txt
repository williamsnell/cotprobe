Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about an atom with one electron. Hmm, wait a minute, an atom with only one electron? That seems a bit strange because I remember that atoms typically have multiple electrons. Oh wait, maybe it's a hydrogen-like atom, which is an atom that has only one electron. Yeah, that makes sense because hydrogen is the only atom with one electron. 

The problem says that the light with a wavelength of 0.1 nm is causing the atom to excite from the ground state to infinite ionization. Oh, wait, infinite ionization? I'm not sure about that part. Infinite ionization probably means that the electron is being ionized completely, like it's losing all its electrons. But wait, since the atom is hydrogen-like, it can't lose more electrons because it only has one. So maybe the question is about the energy required to ionize it, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let's recall some concepts. The ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom. For a hydrogen-like atom, the energy levels are given by the formula E_n = - (Z² * R_H) / n², where R_H is the Rydberg constant. Oh wait, and the Rydberg constant R is approximately 13.6 eV or 2.18e-18 J. 

But wait, the question says the light has a wavelength of 0.1 nm. Oh, that's a red light, I think. Because visible light has wavelengths around 0.4 to 0.7 micrometers, like red is around 650 nm, so 0.1 nm is much shorter. So it's ultraviolet light. But I'm not sure how that relates yet.

The key here is that the light is causing the atom to go into an excited state. When an electron absorbs a photon, it gets excited. The energy of this photon must be enough to overcome the ionization potential. Wait, but the question says it's moving from the ground state to infinite ionization. Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy level, and infinite ionization would mean removing all electrons. But if the atom only has one electron, how can it lose electrons? Oh, maybe the question is a bit tricky. Perhaps it's considering that the atom is being ionized, but since it's hydrogen-like, it can't lose more electrons. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the ionization energy. The ionization energy for hydrogen is 13.6 eV. But the wavelength here is 0.1 nm, which is 10^-10 meters. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Let me compute that. 

h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.1e-9 m (since 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m? Wait no, wait, 1 nanometer is 1e-9 meters. So 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m. Wait no, 0.1 nm is 10^-10 meters. So plug in E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1e-10) 

Let me calculate that. 

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divide by 1e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1e-10 = 1.9878e-15 J. 

But 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1.9878e-15 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 1.24e4 eV, which is about 12400 eV or 12.4 keV.

Wait, but the ionization energy for hydrogen is 13.6 eV. Hmm, so 12.4 keV is much higher than 13.6 eV. That would mean that the photon's energy is higher than the ionization energy. So the photon can ionize the hydrogen atom. But wait, the problem states that the atom moves from the ground state to infinite ionization, which implies that it's being ionized completely. But if the atom is hydrogen-like (only one electron), it can't lose electrons. So perhaps the question is about the ionization energy, not achieving infinite ionization.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again. The problem says the light excites the atom to infinite ionization. Wait, maybe it's the same as the ionization energy? Because infinite ionization would mean that the electron is completely removed, but for a hydrogen-like atom, that would require an energy of 13.6 eV. So perhaps the energy of the photon is equal to the ionization energy.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed the photon's energy is about 12.4 keV. That's way higher than 13.6 eV. So maybe this approach is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy required to ionize the atom, which would be 13.6 eV. 

Wait, but the light's wavelength is 0.1 nm. Let me compute the energy again. 

E = hc/λ. h is 6.626e-34, c is 3e8. So 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divide by λ=1e-10 m? Wait, wait, 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters. So 1e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / 1e-10 = 1.9878e-15 J. 

Convert to eV: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1.9878e-15 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.9878e4 / 1.602 ≈ 12400 eV, which is 12.4 keV. 

Wait, but the ionization energy for hydrogen is 13.6 eV. So the photon's energy is higher than that. So the atom would lose an electron, but wait, the atom only has one electron. So maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps this isn't a hydrogen atom. Oh wait, no—the question says it's an atom with one electron. So it's a hydrogen-like atom. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking about the ionization energy, but in this setup, the photon's energy is higher than the ionization energy. So the atom would be ionized, but since it's the ground state, maybe it's getting excited to a higher level and then ionized. But the question says it's excited from the ground state to infinite ionization. Or maybe the atom's ionization potential is higher than the photon's energy, so the atom is ionized, but the question is about the ionization energy.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ionization energy. The ionization energy for a hydrogen-like atom is given by E_i = (13.6 eV) * (Z^2) / n^2. But in this case, n is 1 (ground state). So E_i = 13.6 eV * (Z^2)/1. So E_i = 13.6 Z^2 eV. But in this problem, the photon's energy is 12.4 keV. Wait, 12 keV is 12,400 eV. 

Wait, the ionization energy is 13.6 Z^2 eV. So setting 13.6 Z^2 = 12400 eV (12.4 keV). 

Wait, let me compute that. 

13.6 Z^2 = 12400.

Z^2 = 12400 / 13.6 ≈ 911.76.

Z is the square root of that, approximately 30.19. So Z is about 30. So looking at the options, option A is 30 protons. So that would be the answer. 

But wait, but the options are A:30 protons, which is the calculated Z. So that would make the answer option A. But wait, the options include other numbers as well. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, E_photon is 12.4 keV. So E_i = 13.6 * Z^2 = 12400 eV.

So Z^2 = 12400 / 13.6 ≈ 911.76. Square root is about 30.19, so Z=30. So the correct option is A:30 protons. Looking back at the options, option A is 30 protons.

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation as follows:

The atom in question has one electron, making it a hydrogen-like atom. The energy of the photon with a wavelength of 0.1 nm is calculated using the formula:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (3 \times 10^8)}{1 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.9878 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting this energy to electron volts (1 eV = \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
E = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-15}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 12400 \, \text{eV}
\]

The ionization energy for a hydrogen-like atom is given by:

\[
E_i = 13.6 \, \text{eV} \times Z^2
\]

where \( Z \) is the atomic number. Setting the photon's energy equal to the ionization energy:

\[
13.6 \, Z^2 = 12400
\]

Solving for \( Z \):

\[
Z^2 = \frac{12400}{13.6} \approx 911.76
\]

\[
Z = \sqrt{911.76} \approx 30.19
\]

Since the atomic number \( Z \) must be an integer, \( Z \approx 30 \). Therefore, the correct option is:
