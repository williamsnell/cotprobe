Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about estimating the difference between two proportions, p1 and p2, where p1 is the proportion of women in Group 1 who think clothes are too expensive, and p2 is for Group 2. 

First, I remember that p1 is the sample proportion from Group 1, and p2 from Group 2. The problem gives me sample sizes and the number of successes (people who think clothes are too expensive). 

Group 1: 1230 women, 1009 say they think clothes are too expensive. So, the sample proportion p1 would be 1009 divided by 1230. Let me calculate that. 1009 ÷ 1230. Hmm, let me do that division. 1230 goes into 1009 zero times, so 0. Let's see, 1230 * 8 is 9840, which is more than 1009, wait, no, 1230 * 0.8 is 984, so 0.8 is 984, which is less than 1009. So it's approximately 0.829, wait, maybe I should use a calculator approach.

Wait, 1009 ÷ 1230. Let me do this step by step. 1230 × 0.8 = 984. So subtract that from 1009: 1009 - 984 = 25. So that's 0.8 plus 25/1230. 25 ÷ 1230 is approximately 0.0203 (since 1230 × 0.02 is 24.6, so 25 is a little more, about 0.0203). So p1 ≈ 0.8203.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. 1230 × 0.82 is 1230 * 0.8 + 1230 * 0.02 = 984 + 24.6 = 1008.6. So 1008.6 is 0.82, but we have 1009, which is 0.4 over. So 0.4 / 1230 is approximately 0.00325. So p1 is approximately 0.82 + 0.00325 = 0.82325, maybe? Wait, but wait, that can't be right because 0.82 times 1230 is 1008.6, so 1009 is just 0.4 more. So 0.82 plus (0.4 / 1230) is 0.82 + 0.003254 ≈ 0.823254.

Wait, but maybe I should just compute 1009 ÷ 1230 more accurately. Let me do it as a division.

1230 | 1009.000000
We can think of this as 1230 into 10090.000000.

1230 × 8 = 9840, which is less than 10090. So 8 times. 10090 - 9840 = 250.

Bring down a zero: 2500. 1230 × 2 = 2460. So 2 times. 2500 - 2460 = 40.

Bring down a zero: 400. 1230 goes into 400 zero times. So next digit is 0. Then 4000. 1230 × 3 = 3690. 4000 - 3690 = 310.

Bring down a zero: 3100. 1230 × 2 = 2460. 3100 - 2460 = 640.

Bring down a zero: 6400. 1230 × 5 = 6150. 6400 - 6150 = 250.

Bring down a zero: 2500. We've seen this before. So the decimal repeats. So putting it all together, 1009 ÷ 1230 is 0.823254... So p1 ≈ 0.8233.

Wait, but I might be making a mistake here because 1230 × 0.8 = 984, so 0.8 is 984, which is less than 1009. So it's more than 0.8. So 0.8 + (25/1230) ≈ 0.8 + 0.0203 = 0.8203. Hmm, but when I compute the division, it's approximately 0.82325, which is about 0.8233.

Now for p2: Group 2 has 340 women, 207 of them think clothes are too expensive. So p2 is 207 / 340. Let me calculate that. 207 ÷ 340.

340 × 0.6 = 204, so 0.6 is 204, which is less than 207. So 0.6 + (3 ÷ 340) ≈ 0.6 + 0.0088 ≈ 0.6088. Alternatively, let's compute it accurately.

340 × 0.6 = 204, so 207 - 204 = 3. So 3 ÷ 340 = 0.0088235. So p2 ≈ 0.6088235, which is approximately 0.6088.

So p1 is approximately 0.8233, p2 is approximately 0.6088.

The question asks for a point estimate of p1 - p2. So that would be 0.8233 - 0.6088 = 0.2145. Looking at the options, option A is 0.2115, which is close but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me double-check the calculations.

For p1: 1009 ÷ 1230.

Calculating 1009 ÷ 1230:

1230 × 0.8 = 984, subtract that from 1009: 1009 - 984 = 25.

Bring down a zero: 250. 1230 × 0.2 = 246. 250 - 246 = 4.

Bring down a zero: 40. 1230 × 0.03 = 36.9, so 40 - 36.9 = 3.1.

Bring down a zero: 31. 1230 × 0.025 = approximately 30.75. So 31 - 30.75 = 0.25.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach would be better, but since I don't have one, let me compute it another way.

Wait, 1230 × 0.8233 = let's see:

0.8233 × 1230.

0.8 × 1230 = 984.

0.02 × 1230 = 24.6.

0.003 × 1230 = 3.69.

0.0003 × 1230 = 0.369.

Adding them up: 984 + 24.6 = 1008.6, +3.69 = 1012.29, +0.369 = 1012.659.

Wait, but 1009 is the numerator. So 0.8233 × 1230 ≈ 1012.659, which is more than 1009, so perhaps my approximation was a bit off. Maybe the exact value is a little less than 0.8233.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should consider using decimal division.

Let me try 1009 ÷ 1230.

Dividing 1009 by 1230:

1230 goes into 1009 zero times. So 0.

Add a decimal point, and add zeros: 1009.000000.

1230 × 0.8 = 984. So subtract 984 from 1009: 25.

Bring down a zero: 250. 1230 × 0.2 = 246. So 250 - 246 = 4.

Bring down a zero: 40. 1230 × 0.03 = 36.9, so 40 - 36.9 = 3.1.

Bring down a zero: 31. 1230 × 0.025 = 30.75. 31 - 30.75 = 0.25.

Bring down a zero: 250. Now, this is repeating.

So, p1 is approximately 0.823254..., which I'll write as 0.8233.

Similarly, p2 is 207 ÷ 340.

Let me compute that more accurately. 340 × 0.6 is 204, as before. So 207 is 3 more than 204, so 3/340 is approximately 0.0088235. So 0.6 + 0.0088235 = 0.6088235, which is approximately 0.6088.

So p1 - p2 = 0.8233 - 0.6088 = 0.2145.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.2115, which is close but a bit lower than 0.2145. Option B is 0.3256, which is higher. Option C is 0.1298, D is 0.2732, E is 0.3021, F is 0.0997, G is 0.2389, H is 0.2654, I is 0.1874, J is 0.1543.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check p1 and p2 again.

Wait, p1 is 1009/1230. Let me compute this using another approach. 1009 ÷ 1230.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach (even though I can't use one, I'll think):

1230 × 0.823 = 1230*(0.8 + 0.02 + 0.003) = 984 + 24.6 + 3.69 = 1012.29. But 1009 is less than 1012.29, so 0.823 would give 1012.29, which is higher than 1009. So p1 must be less than 0.823.

Wait, so maybe I made a mistake in the earlier division. Let me try to compute 1009 ÷ 1230 accurately.

I can set it up as 1009 ÷ 1230.

1230 | 1009.000000

1230 goes into 1009 zero times. So 0.

Add a decimal: 10090.000000

1230 × 8 = 9840. Subtract from 10090: 250.

Bring down a zero: 2500.

1230 × 2 = 2460. Subtract: 40.

Bring down a zero: 400.

1230 × 0 = 0. Subtract: 400.

Bring down a zero: 4000.

1230 × 3 = 3690. Subtract: 310.

Bring down a zero: 3100.

1230 × 2 = 2460. Subtract: 640.

Bring down a zero: 6400.

1230 × 5 = 6150. Subtract: 250.

Bring down a zero: 2500. This repeats.

So the decimal is 0.823254..., which is approximately 0.8233.

Wait, but wait, 0.823254... is approximately 0.8233.

Wait, so 0.8233 - 0.6088 = 0.2145.

Looking at the options, none exactly match 0.2145. The closest is option A: 0.2115, which is a bit lower. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for p1 minus p2, but perhaps I miscalculated p2.

Wait, p2 is 207/340. Let me compute that again.

340 goes into 207 zero times. So 0.

Add a decimal: 2070 ÷ 340.

340 × 6 = 2040. Subtract 2040 from 2070: 30.

Bring down a zero: 300.

340 goes into 300 zero times. So next digit is 0.

Bring down a zero: 3000.

340 × 8 = 2720. Subtract: 3000 - 2720 = 280.

Bring down a zero: 2800.

340 × 8 = 2720. Subtract: 2800 - 2720 = 80.

Bring down a zero: 800.

340 × 2 = 680. Subtract: 800 - 680 = 120.

Bring down a zero: 1200.

340 × 3 = 1020. Subtract: 1200 - 1020 = 180.

Bring down a zero: 1800.

340 × 5 = 1700. Subtract: 1800 - 1700 = 100.

Bring down a zero: 1000.

340 × 2 = 680. Subtract: 1000 - 680 = 320.

Bring down a zero: 3200.

340 × 9 = 3060. Subtract: 3200 - 3060 = 140.

Bring down a zero: 1400.

340 × 4 = 1360. Subtract: 1400 - 1360 = 40.

Bring down a zero: 400.

340 × 1 = 340. Subtract: 400 - 340 = 60.

Bring down a zero: 600.

340 × 1 = 340. Subtract: 600 - 340 = 260.

Bring down a zero: 2600.

340 × 7 = 2380. Subtract: 2600 - 2380 = 220.

Bring down a zero: 2200.

340 × 6 = 2040. Subtract: 2200 - 2040 = 160.

And so on. So this is getting quite lengthy, but the decimal is approximately 0.6088235294117647... which is approximately 0.6088.

So p1 - p2 is 0.8233 - 0.6088 = 0.2145.

But looking at the options, I don't see 0.2145. The closest is option A: 0.2115, which is 0.003 less. Maybe I made a miscalculation in the division.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects p1 - p2, but maybe I should use the exact fractions before converting.

Wait, let me try that. p1 is 1009/1230, p2 is 207/340.

So p1 - p2 = (1009/1230) - (207/340).

To compute this, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 1230 and 340. Let's find their least common multiple (LCM).

First, factorize both numbers.

1230: 1230 = 123 × 10 = 3 × 41 × 2 × 5 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 41.

340: 340 = 34 × 10 = 2 × 17 × 2 × 5 = 2² × 5 × 17.

So the LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present.

Primes: 2, 3, 5, 17, 41.

So LCM = 2² × 3 × 5 × 17 × 41.

Compute that:

2² = 4.

4 × 3 = 12.

12 × 5 = 60.

60 × 17 = 1020.

1020 × 41 = let's calculate 1020 × 40 = 40,800, plus 1020 × 1 = 1020. So total is 41,820.

So the common denominator is 41,820.

Now, compute each fraction:

p1 = 1009/1230 = (1009 × 34) / (1230 × 34) = (1009 × 34) / 41,820.

1009 × 34: 1000 × 34 = 34,000; 9 × 34 = 306. So total is 34,000 + 306 = 34,306.

So p1 = 34,306 / 41,820.

Similarly, p2 = 207/340 = (207 × 123) / (340 × 123) = (207 × 123) / 41,820.

Compute 207 × 123:

200 × 123 = 24,600.

7 × 123 = 861.

So total is 24,600 + 861 = 25,461.

So p2 = 25,461 / 41,820.

Now, p1 - p2 = (34,306 - 25,461) / 41,820 = (34,306 - 25,461) = 8,845.

So 8,845 / 41,820 = let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 8,845 ÷ 5 = 1,769; 41,820 ÷ 5 = 8,364.

Wait, perhaps I can simplify further. Let me try dividing both by 17: 1,769 ÷ 17 = 104.058, which isn't an integer. Maybe 8364 ÷ 17 = 492.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Let me instead compute 8,845 ÷ 41,820.

Compute as a decimal: 8,845 ÷ 41,820.

Well, 41,820 × 0.2 = 8,364. So 8,364 is part of it.

Subtract: 8,845 - 8,364 = 481.

Bring down a zero: 4,810.

41,820 × 0.01 = 418.2, which is more than 481. So 0.01 gives 418.2, so 481 - 418.2 = 62.8.

Bring down a zero: 628.

41,820 × 0.015 = 627.3. So 628 - 627.3 = 0.7.

Bring down a zero: 7.0.

41,820 × 0.000165 = approximately 0.7.

So adding up, 0.2 (from 8,364) + 0.01 (from 481) + 0.0015 (from 628) = 0.2115.

So 8,845 / 41,820 ≈ 0.2115.

Ah! So that's why option A is 0.2115. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, so earlier, my calculation via decimals gave me 0.2145, but using the fractions, I found it to be 0.2115, which aligns with option A.

So I think I made a mistake in the initial long division approach because I didn't factorize the numbers properly and perhaps miscalculated. So using the fraction method, I found the correct answer is 0.2115, which is option A.
</think>

To estimate \( p_1 - p_2 \), where \( p_1 = \frac{1009}{1230} \) and \( p_2 = \frac{207}{340} \), we calculate each fraction accurately:

1. \( p_1 = \frac{1009}{1230} \approx 0.8233 \)
2. \( p_2 = \frac{207}{340} \approx 0.6088 \)

Subtracting these gives:

\[
p_1 - p_2 \approx 0.8233 - 0.6088 = 0.2145
\]

However, using a more precise method by expressing the fractions with a common denominator and simplifying yields:

\[
p_1 - p_2 = \frac{8845}{41820} \approx 0.2115
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: A**
