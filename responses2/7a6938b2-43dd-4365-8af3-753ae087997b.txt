Okay, so I've got this problem about a converging lens and an object. Let's see what I can remember about optics. Oh wait, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says an object is 5 cm in diameter and is 33.3 cm away from a converging lens that has a power of 8 diopters. I need to find the image position and its size. The options are A to J, each with a different image distance and diameter.

First, I remember that diopters are the unit for focal length in lenses. Power is 1/f, so 8 diopters means the focal length is 1/8 meters, right? Because 1 diopter is 1 meter^-1. So 8 diopters is 0.125 meters, which is 12.5 cm. Wait, no—wait, 1 diopter is 1 meter^-1. So 8 diopters is 1/8 m, which is 12.5 cm. Oh wait, no, wait. 1 diopter is 1 meter^-1, so 8 diopters is 8 m^-1. So the focal length f is 1/(8) meters. Which is 0.125 meters, or 12.5 cm. Oh wait, no, wait! Wait, 8 diopters is 8 meters^-1, so f=1/8 m = 0.125 m, which is 12.5 cm. So the lens is converging, so it's a convex lens.

Next, I need to find the image distance. The object is 33.3 cm from the lens. So the object distance u is 33.3 cm. Wait, but wait—wait, no, in the thin lens formula, we need to consider the signs. I remember that the object distance is positive if it's a real object in front of the lens, and the image distance depends on the lens type and object distance.

The thin lens formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. Here, v is the image distance, u is object distance, and f is focal length.

Wait, but wait, I should be careful with the signs. The sign convention is important here. Let's recall: in the standard sign conventions, the object distance u is positive if the object is on the same side as the incoming light, which is the usual case. The image distance v is positive if the image is on the opposite side of the object relative to the lens (real image), but it's negative if the image is formed on the same side as the object (virtual image). Wait, no, wait, no—wait, that's for when using the same side as the object. Let me think again.

Wait, more accurately: In the standard convention, the object is on the left side of the lens, and the image is on the other side. The image is real if it's formed on the opposite side of the lens, which is the case when the image is formed. The image distance is positive if the image is real (on the opposite side), and negative if it's virtual (on the same side as the object). But wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula without worrying about signs, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the formula and think about the lens' behavior.

Wait, the lens is converging (positive focal length), and the object is placed on the same side as the incoming light. So the object distance u is positive. The image distance v can be positive (real image) or negative (virtual image).

But in our case, since the object is in front of the lens, and the lens is converging, the image will form somewhere behind the lens (real image), so v is positive.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me get the correct sign convention. The standard sign convention is:

- Object distance (u) is positive if the object is on the object side (in front of the lens).

- Image distance (v) is positive if the image is on the opposite side (real image), or negative if on the same side (virtual image).

Alternatively, sometimes people define the image distance as positive for real images and negative for virtual. Hmm, maybe I should re-verify.

Wait, I think the standard sign convention for thin lenses is as follows:

- The object is on the left side of the lens. So the object distance u is positive.

- The image is on the right side if it's a real image (so v is positive), or on the left side if it's a virtual image (so v is negative).

So, in our problem, since the object is in front of the lens, and the image is virtual only if the object is beyond the focal length (so that a virtual image is formed on the same side as the object). Wait, no, wait—no, wait, wait. A converging lens will always produce a real image for any object except when the object is beyond the focal length, in which case the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. Hmm, perhaps that's right.

Wait, maybe in converging lens, if the object is beyond the focal length, the image is virtual and forms on the same side as the object (so image distance v is negative). Because when u > f, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object.

Wait, let me think. Suppose the object is at u = 3m (300 cm). The focal length f is 12.5 cm (0.125 m). Since u > f, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. So v is negative.

So in this problem, u = 33.3 cm, f = 12.5 cm. Since 33.3 > 12.5, v is negative.

Now, applying the thin lens formula:

1/f = 1/v + 1/u.

Wait, but let's make sure of the formula. The formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Wait, no, in the standard formula, it's 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. No, wait, no, wait—I think I might be getting this mixed up. Let me get it right.

Wait, the formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Oh wait, no, wait, no, wait. I think I'm mixing it up. Let me recall the formula correctly. Oh wait, no, the correct formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1/f = 1/u + 1/v? Or perhaps 1/f = 1/v - 1/u? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. The correct formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. But wait, no, wait, no. Because when u and v have opposite signs, the signs would get mixed. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the calculations, keeping in mind the signs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute v using the formula.

So, plugging in u = 33.3 cm, f = 12.5 cm.

Wait, but wait, f is positive, u is positive as per the sign convention. So:

1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

We can rearrange to solve for v.

So,

1/v = 1/f - 1/u.

Wait, no, wait, let me double-check.

The correct formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. So,

1/v = 1/f - 1/u.

Wait, but if f is positive, and u is positive, then 1/f is positive, and 1/u is positive. So 1/v = (1/f) - (1/u). But if u > f, then 1/u is less than 1/f, so 1/f - 1/u is positive, making v positive. But wait, wait—no, wait, no.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

u = 33.3 cm, f = 12.5 cm.

1/f = 1/0.125 = 8.

1/u = 1/0.333... cm = approximately 3.

So,

1/v = 8 - 3 = 5.

So v = 1/5 = 0.2 m, which is 20 cm.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the image is on the same side as the object (v is negative), so I must have made a mistake in the signs.

Ah, right. Because in the case where u > f, the image is virtual and formed on the same side as the object, so v is negative.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the formula with the correct sign conventions.

Using the correct sign convention: u is positive, v is positive for real images, negative for virtual.

But for u =33.3 cm (positive), f=12.5 cm.

Since u>f, image is virtual, so v is negative.

So the equation is:

1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

But wait, 1/v is negative in this case. So let's compute 1/f and 1/u.

1/f = 1/0.125 m = 8 m⁻¹.

1/u = 1/0.333 m = 3 m⁻¹.

So,

1/v = 8 m⁻¹ - 3 m⁻¹ = 5 m⁻¹.

So, 1/v = 5 m⁻¹ → v = 0.2 m → 20 cm. But since v is positive, that would be a real image. But that contradicts what we know, because u > f implies v is negative. So perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, but if the image is formed on the same side as the object, then v is negative.

So perhaps the correct way is to write:

1/v = 1/f - 1/u.

Wait, but in the case where u > f, 1/f is larger than 1/u, so 1/v would be positive, making v positive. But that's not the case for a virtual image on the same side.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be 1/v = (1/u) - (1/f), but that would mean 1/v = (1/33.3) - (1/12.5) = (0.03) - (0.08) = -0.05 → v = -20 cm. Which would give a negative v, indicating a virtual image on the same side as the object. That makes sense.

Ah, I think I got it wrong earlier. So the correct equation is:

1/f = 1/u + 1/v → 1/v = 1/f - 1/u.

Wait, but if u > f, then 1/u is less than 1/f, so 1/f - 1/u would be positive, leading to positive v, which would imply a real image on the opposite side (right side of the lens). But that's not the case when u>f because the image is virtual.

Wait, this is a bit conflicting. Let's think again: when u > f, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. So, in that case, v is negative.

But according to the formula, 1/v = 1/f - 1/u.

If u > f, 1/f is larger than 1/u, so 1/f - 1/u is positive. So 1/v positive → v positive. But we know that in this case v should be negative. Therefore, perhaps the correct formula is 1/v = 1/u - 1/f.

Wait, let me compute that. If u=33.3, f=12.5.

1/u = 3 cm⁻¹ (approx 0.03)
1/f = 8 cm⁻¹ (approx 0.08)

So, 1/u - 1/f = 3 - 8 = -5 → 1/v = -5 → v = -0.2 m = -20 cm.

Ah, that makes sense. Because v is negative, so the image is virtual and on the same side as the object.

So, yes, the correct formula is:

1/v = 1/u - 1/f.

So plug in the numbers:

1/v = (1/33.3) - (1/12.5).

Let me compute each term:

1/33.3 cm is approximately 0.03 m⁻¹ (since 33.3 is 100/3 ≈ 33.333 cm).

1/12.5 cm is 0.08 m⁻¹.

So,

1/v = 0.03 - 0.08 → 1/v = -0.05.

So v = 1/(-0.05) → v = -20 cm.

So the image is 20 cm behind the lens. Wait, but the lens is converging, so since the image is virtual, it's formed behind the lens, which is on the same side as the object. So the image distance is negative, indicating that it's on the opposite side. But wait, wait—wait, no, no, in the sign convention, if the image is on the same side as the object, it's considered negative. So yes, v is negative.

So the image is 20 cm behind the lens. So the position of the image is 20 cm from the lens, on the same side as the object.

Wait, but the image is virtual and located behind the lens, so the image distance is negative. So v = -20 cm. Oh wait, but the question asks for the position from the lens, but I think it's just the magnitude—wait, the options give the image distance, which can be positive or negative. But in the answer options, all are positive. So perhaps the question is about the magnitude.

But no, the options give the image distance as a positive number (like 15, 12, etc.), but perhaps the question is asking for the position from the lens as a positive value, regardless of being real or virtual. Or maybe the image is on the opposite side, so the distance is 20 cm in the same direction as the object. Hmm, perhaps I should just go with that.

Wait, but wait, the problem says, "the position of the image from the lens." So in the sign convention, if the image is on the opposite side, v is positive, and on the same side, it's negative. So in this case, the image is on the same side as the object (since it's virtual), so v is negative. But the options are all positive, so perhaps it's the magnitude. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the image distance as positive regardless of whether it's real or virtual.

Wait, but the options don't include a negative number. So maybe in the options, positive numbers are the distances on the same side as the object (real image) and negative on the opposite side (virtual image). But the options are 15,12, etc. So perhaps the image is on the opposite side, so the distance is 20 cm, but the sign is negative. So the position is 20 cm behind the lens, so the answer would be 20 cm from the lens, but in the options, they are positive.

But perhaps the question is about the position regardless of the sign. So the answer is 20 cm. Looking at the options, option C is 20 cm, 3 cm. So the image distance is 20 cm. But wait, the options are A:40, 1.5; B:35, 0.5; etc. Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it again.

Wait, let's compute 1/f = 1/0.125 m = 8 m⁻¹.

u = 33.3 cm → 0.333 m.

So,

1/v = 1/u - 1/f = (1/0.3333) - (1/0.125) → (3) - (8) → -5 → 1/v = -5 → v = -0.2 m → -20 cm.

Wait, so v is -20 cm. So the image is 20 cm behind the lens, on the same side as the object.

But looking at the options, option C is 20 cm, 3 cm. So the image is 20 cm from the lens. So the position is 20 cm, which matches option C.

Wait, but wait another moment. The lens is converging, so any object placed beyond the focal length (u > f) will form a virtual image on the same side as the object. So the image is behind the lens, so the distance is 20 cm, but it's on the same side, so the sign is negative. However, the options don't have negative signs. So perhaps the answer is 20 cm, but the image is virtual, so the position is 20 cm behind the lens, meaning 20 cm from the lens. So the answer is 20 cm, but I'm confused because the options don't have a negative number. So the answer will be 20 cm from the lens.

Wait, but the problem asks for the position of the image. Since the image is virtual, it's on the same side as the object, so the distance is 20 cm behind the lens. So the answer is 20 cm, which is option C.

But wait, the options don't have any negative sign. So perhaps the problem is expecting the answer without considering the sign. So the position is 20 cm (option C).

Now, moving on to the size of the image. The image is magnified by a factor of m = v/u. Because m = v/u = (-20)/33.3 → let me compute that.

Compute 20 / 33.3 = approximately 0.6. So m ≈ -0.6. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted. But the problem is asking for the size, which is the absolute value. So the image is 0.6 times the size of the object.

Wait, the object is 5 cm. So the image is 0.6 *5 = 3 cm in size. So the image is 3 cm tall.

Looking at the options, option C is 20 cm, 3 cm. So that's the one.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to find the magnification is using the formula m = -v/u.

So,

m = - (-20 cm) / 33.3 cm = 20 / 33.3 ≈ 0.6.

So the magnification is 0.6, meaning the image is 60% the size of the object, which is correct.

So the image distance is 20 cm, and the image height is 3 cm. Looking at the options, option C is 20 cm, 3 cm. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but another moment. The image is 3 cm high, but the object is 5 cm. So the image is smaller, which matches m≈0.6.

So, the image is 20 cm from the lens, and 3 cm in height. So option C is correct.

Wait, but wait, another thought. The object is in front of the lens, and since the lens is converging, if the object is placed beyond the focal length, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. So the image is on the same side, the image distance is positive in the sign convention, but since it's virtual, the image is behind the lens. So the position is 20 cm behind the lens.

But in the options, the given image positions are positive. So the answer would be 20 cm from the lens.

So the image is 20 cm from the lens, and 3 cm high. So option C is correct.
</think>

To determine the position and size of the image formed by a converging lens, we use the lens formula and sign conventions. The lens has a focal length \( f = 8 \, \text{cm} \) (calculated as \( f = \frac{1}{0.125} \, \text{m} \)), and the object is placed at a distance \( u = 33.3 \, \text{cm} \) from the lens.

### Step 1: Determine the image distance \( v \)
The lens formula is:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
\]

Rearranging for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{u} - \frac{1}{f}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{33.3} - \frac{1}{8}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{v} = 0.03 - 0.125 = -0.095
\]

\[
v = -\frac{1}{0.095} \approx -20 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the image is 20 cm behind the lens, as it is virtual.

### Step 2: Determine the size of the image
The magnification \( m \) is given by:

\[
m = \frac{v}{u}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
m = \frac{-20}{33.3} \approx -0.6
\]

The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted. However, the problem asks for the **size** of the image, which is the absolute value. The object height is \( h_o = 5 \, \text{cm} \), so the image height \( h_i \) is:

\[
h_i = |m| \cdot h_o = 0.6 \cdot 5 = 3 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Final Answer
The image is located 20 cm behind the lens and has a height of 3 cm. Comparing this with the options:

- **Option C: 20 cm, 3 cm** matches the calculated values.
