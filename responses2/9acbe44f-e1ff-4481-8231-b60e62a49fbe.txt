Okay, so I've got this problem about mixing vinegar and oil for a salad dressing. Hmm, let me read it again. It says 2 parts vinegar with 5 parts oil. And the question is, how many ounces of oil should be mixed with 9 ounces of vinegar. The options are A to J, with various numbers.

Wait, the ratio is 2:5 for vinegar to oil, right? So for every 2 parts of vinegar, there are 5 parts of oil. So the question is giving me vinegar and asking how much oil is needed. So I think I can set up a proportion here.

So if 2 parts vinegar correspond to 5 parts oil, then 9 parts vinegar would correspond to how many oil parts? Let me write that as a ratio.

Vinegar : Oil = 2 : 5.

Given vinegar is 9 ounces, so I need to find the oil (let's call it x ounces). So setting up the proportion: 2/5 = 9/x. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, maybe it's vinegar to oil ratio is 2:5, so 2 parts vinegar to 5 parts oil. So solving for the x when vinegar is 9.

So 2/5 = 9/x. Wait, no, maybe I should think of it as (2 parts vinegar)/(5 parts oil) = (9 ounces)/(x ounces). That would make sense because if I have more vinegar, I'll need more oil.

So solving for x: 2/5 = 9/x → cross-multiplying gives 2x = 5*9 → 2x=45 → x=22.5.

Wait, so that would mean 22.5 ounces of oil. Looking at the options, option B is 22.5. So the answer should be B.

But wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me think again. The ratio of vinegar to oil is 2:5. So for every 2 oz of vinegar, we need 5 oz of oil. So for 9 oz of vinegar, how much oil? Let's set up the equation: (2/5) = (9/x). Cross-multiplying: 2x=45 → x=22.5. Yep, that's B.

The ratio of vinegar to oil is 2:5. Given 9 ounces of vinegar, we need to find the corresponding oil. Set up the proportion: 2/5 = 9/x → x = (5×9)/2 = 22.5. The correct answer is B.

Answer: B
