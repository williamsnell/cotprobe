The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Police received information from a reliable informant that a defendant would be extorting money from a victim. The informant gave the police explicit details about the extortion scheme: the defendant would be calling the victim from a public phone booth on a particular street corner on a certain date and time to make the extortionist demand. Without notif'ing the telephone company or seeking a warrant, the police installed an eavesdropping device on the public phone. At the time on the date specified by the informant, the defendant phoned the victim from the telephone booth and said, "You better pay me $5,000 by next week or I'll kill you and your family. " The defendant provided additional details about how and where to make the payoff. Based on the taped conversation, the police arrested the defendant and charged him with extortion. Prior to trial, the defendant's attorney moves to exclude the taped conversation from evidence. The defense motion should be

Options:

A: granted, because the police should have obtained a court order before recording the conversation.
B: denied, because the police had probable cause based on the information supplied by the informant.
C: denied, because the defendant did not have reasonable expectation of privacy.
D: granted, because the police violated the defendant's rights by not informing him of the eavesdropping device.
E: denied, because the information from the informant was reliable and specific.
F: granted, because the police did not obtain prior approval of the telephone company before installing the eavesdropping device.
G: denied, because the threat made by the defendant was a serious crime.
H: granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device.
I: granted, because the defendant was not aware of the eavesdropping device.
J: denied, because the phone booth is a public place with no expectation of privacy.

Okay, so I've got this question about law, specifically about evidence and evidence laws. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the scenario is that the police received a lot of information from a reliable informant about a defendant who's being extorted from a victim. The informant gave the police explicit details about the extortion scheme, including where and when the defendant would call the victim via a public phone booth, and the amount they'd demand.

Then, the police installed an eavesdropping device on the phone, so they can listen to the phone conversation without the phone company's permission. At the exact time the informant told them, the defendant called the victim, demanding the payment. The defendant provided more details on how and where to make the payment.

Now, the issue is that the defendant's attorney is moving to exclude the conversation from evidence. The defense's motion is to get this conversation back. The question is, based on the tape, should the defense's motion be denied?

So the options are A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Grant granted because they had a court order before recording. I'm not sure about that. The question says the phone company installed the eavesdropping without the government's permission. But I think court orders are more about when the conversation is recorded. But the phone company has a duty to obtain a warrant to install eavesdropping devices. Without a warrant, their actions could be considered unreasonable. So installing the device might have been a violation of their duty. So A might not make sense because the phone company's action would have been unreasonable.

Option B: Denied because of probable cause based on the informant's info. The question says the informant gave explicit details. If that's enough to establish the extent of the crime, then the probable cause is there. So the defense would argue that the conversation itself is not sufficient and that the device's installation adds to the evidence. But the question is about the defense motion, not the prosecution's.

Option C: Denied because defendant didn't have privacy. The defendant called the victim, which is a public place. Public phones are typically kept under surveillance, so the defendant's call would be an eavesdropping and might be considered非法. So if the defendant didn't have the opportunity to make an exception (like a warrant), that's a defense. But does the defendant's lack of a warrant affect the issue here? Because the telephone company's installation was a violation without a warrant. So the defense might argue that the defendant didn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy, leading to a warrant being necessary. But the question is about the defense's motion, not the prosecution's.

Option D: Grant because the police violated the defendant's rights. I'm not sure about that. The defendant's attorney is moving to exclude the conversation. But the question is about whether the defense should deny the motion. The defense's motion is to exclude the conversation. So if the evidence is not admissible, the defense motion is granted. But if the defense is arguing that the conversation is not admissible because the defendant's privacy was violated, then that would be a different matter.

Option E: Denied because the phone booth has no privacy. That aligns with what I thought earlier. The defendant's call to a public phone booth is a known privacy violation. The defendant doesn't have the right to call someone, so without a warrant, the installation of the device might be illegal. But the question is about the defense's motion. So if the defense is arguing that the defendant didn't have the right to make the call, the court would likely deny the motion because the call was made to a public place without the defendant's consent. But I'm not certain if the defense's motion is based on the phone's lack of privacy, or if the defendant's right to privacy is about not calling someone without consent.

Option F: Grant because no prior approval from the telephone company. The question states that the police installed the device without notification, and the phone company had to obtain a warrant. So without a warrant, the installation was a violation. So the defense's motion to exclude the conversation would be granted if the court finds that the installation was unreasonable. But the defense's motion is about the evidence, not the defendant's privacy.

Option G: Denied because the threat was serious. The defendant provided specific information, but the threat was a general one, not necessarily 'serious.' I don't know if the fact that the threat was a general one (like $5k) affects the admissibility. The question doesn't mention the severity, but the threat itself might not be enough, but the issue here is about whether the conversation was recorded because of the eavesdropping device.

Option H: Grant because they didn't get a warrant. The phone company's installing the eavesdropping without a warrant would be considered a violation. So the defense's motion (to exclude evidence) would be granted because the installation was unreasonable. But wait, the question says the defendant's attorney is moving to exclude the conversation, so the defense is arguing that the evidence is not admissible. If the defense is arguing that the installation was unreasonable, then the court would deny the motion, denying the defense's argument. But the options are about what the defense should do.

Option I: Grant because the defendant didn't know about the device. That seems unrelated; the issue is about whether the conversation was recorded because of the installation, not the defendant's awareness.

Option J: Denied because the booth has no privacy. Yes, that's a well-known issue. The defendant can't call a public phone booth unless they have authority over the caller. So the call is a privacy violation, and the defendant lacks the right to make it. But how does that relate to the defense's motion? The defense is moving to exclude the conversation, so if the court finds that the device was installed without a warrant, then the conversation isn't admissible. But the question is about the defense's motion's outcome.

So, putting it together: The phone company's installing the device without a warrant is a violation, so without a warrant, the installation is a violation. The defendant didn't have a warrant, so the installation was unlawful. Therefore, the defense's motion to exclude the conversation would be granted. Alternatively, if the court finds that the defendant had no right to call someone without consent, they couldn't call the victim, thus the evidence isn't admissible.

Also, the question is about whether the defense's motion should be granted. The defense is moving to exclude the conversation. So if the court finds the installation was unreasonable, the defense's motion is denied. But the question is about whether the defense's motion should be granted (i.e., does the court grant it), or denied (does the court deny it).

Wait, the question is asking what the defense's motion should be. So, the options are what the defense (or the court) should grant or deny.

The options are A through J, and each option is a possible decision: grant or deny.

Wait, the question is about the defense's motion, so the options are what the defense should do. So the options are about whether the defense's motion is granted (they say it's not here) or denied (they say yes).

Wait, no: Actually, the options are about what the defense's motion should be. The options are what the court should decide.

Wait, no, the options are what the defense's motion should be. For example, option A says "Grant, because they had a court order." So the defense's motion is to exclude the conversation; the court may decide whether that's admissible.

So, the defense's motion is about excluding the conversation, but the court decides whether that's admissible. The options are about whether the defense should grant the motion (i.e., the court denies it) or not.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine the options.

The options are what the defense should do. The options are whether the defense should grant (they say no) or deny (they say yes) the motion for the conversation to be excluded.

So, the question is, based on the circumstances, what should the defense do regarding the defense's motion.

The options are:

A: Grant, because they had a court order before recording.

B: Deny, because probable cause based on the informant's info.

C: Deny, because defendant didn't have privacy.

D: Grant, because the police violated the defendant's rights by not informing.

E: Deny, because the phone booth has no privacy.

F: Grant, because no prior approval.

G: Deny, because the threat was serious.

H: Grant, because no warrant.

I: Grant, because defendant didn't know.

J: Deny, because the booth has no privacy.

So, which of these is correct.

In the case of an eavesdropping device, the court requires a warrant. So if the phone company installed the device without a warrant, then the installation is a violation. So the defense's motion to exclude the conversation (which is based on the eavesdropping) would be granted if the court finds that the installation was done without a warrant.

But the question is, what should the defense's motion be? The options are whether the court should grant or deny their motion.

So, the options are about whether the defense's motion is granted or denied.

So, the correct reasoning is that without a warrant, the installation of the eavesdropping device would be a violation. Therefore, the defense's motion (to exclude the conversation) would be granted because the installation was a violation, so the evidence isn't admissible.

Looking at the options, let's see which option makes sense.

Option H says: "Grant, because the police violated the defendant's rights by not informing him of the eavesdropping device." So, the defense's motion (to exclude evidence) is granted because the police violated the defendant's rights. That's a possible scenario because the defendant had no right to call someone without permission.

Option F: "Grant, because the phone booth has no expectation of privacy." That's correct because the caller is in a public place, so the defendant can't call him without consent.

So, which option is correct? The question is about whether the defense should grant the motion to exclude the conversation.

If the court finds that the installation was done without a warrant, then the defense's motion (which is to exclude the conversation) would be granted, so the court would deny the motion. So the court would say the defense's motion is granted, so the defense should not grant it. So the defense's motion is denied, meaning the court would deny it.

Alternatively, the court may allow the defense's motion, but I think the more accurate reasoning is that the installation without a warrant is a violation, so the court would deny the defense's motion. But the options are about what the defense should do.

Wait, the options are about the defendant's motion. So, if the defense's motion is to exclude the conversation, the court would decide whether that's admissible. The options are whether the defense should grant or deny the motion.

So, the defense's motion is to exclude the conversation. If the court determines that the conversation is admissible, the motion is denied. If not, the court grants the motion.

Now, the issue is whether the installation was done without a warrant, which would be a violation.

So, the court would likely deny the defense's motion, meaning the defense's motion is denied. So the correct option is J: "Denied, because the phone booth is a public place with no expectation of privacy."

Wait, no: the defense's motion is to exclude the conversation, which is based on the eavesdropping. But the court would determine whether the eavesdropping was lawful.

So, the correct reasoning is that the installation without a warrant is a violation, so the defense's motion is granted, so the court denies the motion. So which option reflects that?

Looking at the options again, if the court denies the defense's motion, the option would be J: "Denied, because the phone booth is a public place with no expectation of privacy."

Wait, no. Let me think: the defense's motion is to exclude the conversation (as the eavesdropping was installed). If the court finds the eavesdropping was done without a warrant, then the defense's motion is granted, so the court denies their motion. So the court would deny the defense's motion, meaning the defense's motion is denied. So the court would decide to deny the motion, so the defense's motion is denied.

So the correct option is J: "Denied, because the phone booth is a public place with no expectation of privacy."

Wait, but J says the court denies the motion. So the correct decision is that the defense's motion is granted, so the court denies it. So the court would decide to deny the defense's motion, so the defense's motion is denied. So the answer would be option J.

The question revolves around whether the defense's motion to exclude the conversation from evidence should be granted or denied, based on the circumstances described. The key issue is whether the installation of an eavesdropping device without a warrant was lawful, given the public nature of the phone booth and the defendant's lack of consent.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Option A**: This suggests granting the court's order before recording due to a court warrant. However, the question does not provide evidence of a court warrant being necessary, and the installation of the device without a warrant is likely a violation. Thus, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B**: This argues that the conversation itself is not admissible due to the defendant's privacy rights. However, the defense's motion is about excluding the conversation based on the eavesdropping device, not the conversation's admissibility.

3. **Option C**: This denies the defense's motion because the defendant did not have reasonable privacy concerns. While the public nature of the phone booth is a known privacy violation, the defense's motion focuses on the eavesdropping device, not the defendant's specific privacy rights.

4. **Option D**: This grants the court's decision if the defendant did not have reasonable expectation of privacy, but the defense's motion is about excluding evidence, not the defendant's rights.

5. **Option E**: This denies the defense's motion because the phone booth has no expectation of privacy. This is a valid point, as the defendant cannot call a public phone booth without consent.

6. **Option F**: This argues that the installation of the eavesdropping device was done without a warrant, which would be a violation. However, the defense's motion is about excluding evidence, not the installation itself.

7. **Option G**: This denies the defense's motion because the threat was not severe. The severity of the threat is not relevant to the admissibility of evidence in this context.

8. **Option H**: This grants the court's decision if the defendant was not aware of the eavesdropping device. However, the defense's motion is about excluding evidence, not the defendant's awareness.

9. **Option I**: This argues that the defendant did not know about the eavesdropping device, but this is irrelevant to the defense's motion.

10. **Option J**: This denies the defense's motion because the phone booth has no expectation of privacy. This aligns with the principle that the defendant cannot call a public phone booth without consent, making this the most accurate option.

### Conclusion:
The installation of the eavesdropping device without a warrant is a violation, and the public nature of the phone booth is a known privacy issue. The defense's motion to exclude the conversation is likely granted because the eavesdropping device was installed without a warrant, making the conversation unadmissible. Therefore, the court would deny the defense's motion, and the correct answer is:
