Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read through it again. Two flasks of equal volume are filled with nitrogen gas. When both are immersed in boiling water, the pressure is 0.5 atm. Then, one is immersed in an ice-water mixture, and the other stays in boiling water. I need to find the new pressure in the system.

Wait, so what's the setup here? Let me visualize it. Both flasks are the same volume. Let's say each has a volume V. When they're both in boiling water, both contain some gas. Then, one is cooled (so immersed in ice), and the other stays warm.

I remember that when a gas is in a container, its pressure depends on the amount of gas (moles), temperature, and volume. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But when the volume changes or temperature changes, the pressure changes accordingly.

In the first scenario, both flasks are in boiling water. So, both have the same pressure. The total pressure is 0.5 atm. Since the volume is the same for both, maybe we can think about the moles of gas each flask contains.

Wait, each flask is a separate container. So, the system's total pressure is the sum of the pressures in each flask. But wait, both flasks are at the same temperature. So, each flask's pressure is P1 and P2. Since both are at the same temperature, and their volumes are the same, P1 = P2 = 0.25 atm each. So total pressure is 0.5 atm.

Wait, but when one is immersed in ice and the other in boiling, the ice water will lower the temperature. So, the first flask will expand because when you cool a gas, it expands. But wait, wait, wait. Let's think about what happens when you put a gas into a container at a lower temperature.

Wait, but wait. When a gas is at a higher temperature, its volume is bigger. If you cool it, the volume would change. So, the number of moles of gas in each flask will change when the temperature is changed.

Let me clarify. Initially, both flasks are at 100°C (boiling water). So, each has n moles of N2 gas. But when one is put into ice (0°C), that container will have less moles of N2 because when you cool a gas, the volume decreases (due to thermal expansion?), but wait, gas volume depends on temperature.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this using partial pressures. So, when the first flask is cooled, the pressure in it will change. We can model each flask's behavior separately.

Wait, both flasks are identical and same initial state. When each is placed in a different environment (boiling and ice), their moles will change.

Wait, but the initial setup is that both flasks are in boiling water (100°C). So, each has n1 moles of N2 in the first flask, and n2 in the second, but the system's pressure is 0.5 atm. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Initially, both flasks are filled with nitrogen gas. So, each has a certain amount of N2. The system's total pressure is 0.5 atm.

Wait, but how do we model this? Let's think step by step.

Let me denote the initial state as both flasks at 100°C. Each contains N2 gas. Let’s say each has a volume V, and the pressure in each is P. The total pressure is 0.5 atm, so 2P = 0.5 atm → P = 0.25 atm each.

Wait, but wait, no. Because when both flasks are closed and then immersed in boiling water, each will have the same volume and same pressure. But the problem says the system's pressure is 0.5 atm. So, each contributes 0.25 atm.

Wait, but when one is then immersed in ice, it will cool, and the other remains at 100°C. So, the first flask will have a lower temperature (0°C), and the second stays at 100°C.

The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. So, for each flask, initially, V=V, P=0.25 atm, T=373 K (100°C).

In the first case, the first flask's temperature is T1 = 273 K (0°C). So, the pressure P1 is given by P1 = (n1 R T1) / V.

Wait, but wait, what about the total pressure now? Or wait, the system's pressure is the sum of the pressures in each flask. Because each is a separate container, their pressures add up.

Wait no, wait. When you put one flask into ice and the other into boiling water, the system's total volume might change? Wait, no, the setup is that the two flasks are each in their own container. So, the two flasks are connected somehow? Or are they separate?

Wait, the question says both flasks are filled with nitrogen gas. They are immersed in different environments. So, each is a separate container. So, the system's pressure is the sum of the pressures in each flask.

Wait, but each flask was initially at the same temperature, but after one is cooled, the pressure in that flask changes.

Wait, but wait: Each flask's volume is the same, and each is a separate container. Let me think: When you put a gas into a container, the pressure in the container depends on the amount of gas (n), the temperature (T), and the volume (V).

Initially, both flasks are at 100°C, same volume, same n1 and n2. But in the first scenario, both are in boiling water, so same P for each. So, each has P = 0.25 atm.

But when they are placed in different environments, the first is cooled (0°C), the second at 100°C.

Wait, but what's the total pressure now? Since the two flasks are separate, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures from each. So each P_i is calculated as (n_i R T_i)/V. So, the total pressure is P_total = P1 + P2.

Wait, but let's model this.

For the first flask (after cooling):

P1 = (n1 R T1) / V.

For the second flask (boiling water):

P2 = (n2 R T2) / V.

But originally, when they were at 100°C, P_initial = (n1 R T_initial) / V = 0.25 atm.

So, n1 R T_initial / V = 0.25 → n1 = (0.25 V) / (R T_initial).

Similarly, for the second flask, n2 R T_initial / V = 0.25 → n2 = (0.25 V) / (R T_initial).

So, n1 = n2 = n.

Wait, but when the first flask is cooled, T1 = 273 K.

So, P1 = (n R * 273) / V.

Similarly, P2 = (n R * 373) / V.

So, the total pressure is P_total = (n R * 273 + n R * 373) / V.

Factor out n R / V:

P_total = (n R / V) (273 +373) = (n R / V) * 646.

But from the initial condition, (n R / V) is 0.25 atm. Because (n R T_initial) / V = 0.25 → (n R / V) * T_initial = 0.25.

So, (n R / V) = 0.25 / T_initial.

But wait, T_initial is 373 K.

So, (n R / V) = 0.25 / 373 ≈ 0.000671 atm/K.

So, plug into P_total: 0.000671 * 646 ≈ 0.434 atm.

Wait, but let's compute it more accurately.

0.25 (from (n R/V)) * (273 + 373) = 0.25 * 646 = 161.5.

Wait, no—because (n R/V) is 0.25 / 373.

So, the calculation would be (0.25/373) * 646.

0.25 * 646 = 161.5

Divide by 373: 161.5 / 373 ≈ 0.433 atm.

So the total pressure would be approximately 0.433 atm. Looking at the options, option B is 0.423, option C is 0.600, option A is 0.25, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the total pressure is the sum of the individual pressures, but each is a separate container, so the sum is the total.

But let me think again.

Another approach: Let's consider that each flask's pressure is P1 and P2 before and after the change. Initially, P1_initial = P2_initial = 0.25 atm.

When one is cooled, P1_new = (n1 R T1) / V.

But initially, n1 R T_initial / V = 0.25 → n1 = (0.25 V) / (R T_initial).

So, P1_new = (n1 R T1) / V = ( (0.25 V) / (R T_initial) ) * R T1 / V ) = 0.25 * (T1 / T_initial) = 0.25 * (273/373).

Because T1 is 273, T_initial is 373.

So, (273/373) ≈ 0.732.

So P1_new ≈ 0.25 * 0.732 ≈ 0.183 atm.

P2 remains the same at 0.25 atm.

So, the total pressure would be 0.183 +0.25 = 0.433 atm.

Which is approximately 0.433 atm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B (0.423) and option C (0.6). Hmm, but 0.433 is closer to 0.423 than 0.6.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the two flasks are each at the same volume, same initial conditions, but when one is cooled, the pressure in that flask is lower. So, after cooling, the pressure in the first flask is P1 = (n1 R T1)/V, and the second is P2 = (n2 R T2)/V.

But initially, for each, P_initial = (n R T_initial)/V → n = (P_initial V)/(R T_initial).

Since the two flasks have the same initial conditions, n1 = n2 = (0.25 V)/(R * 373).

So, P1 = ( (0.25 V)/(R *373) ) * (R *273)/V = 0.25 * (273/373) → 0.25 * ~0.732 ≈ 0.183 atm.

P2 remains 0.25 atm.

So total pressure is 0.183 + 0.25 = 0.433 atm.

Which is approximately 0.433, so the closest option is B: 0.423, which is about 0.423. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, more accurately:

273/373 = approximately 0.732.

0.25 * 0.732 = 0.183.

0.183 + 0.25 = 0.433.

Looking at the options, none is exactly 0.433. The options are:

A: 0.25

B: 0.423

C: 0.600

D: 0.373

E: 0.5

F: 0.280

G: 0.323

H: 0.450

I: 0.523

J: 0.75

So option B is 0.423, which is very close. 0.433 is about 0.43, so the nearest is 0.423, which is option B.

Wait, but wait, another approach: Maybe the pressure of a gas in a container depends on the number of moles and temperature, but when the number of moles changes.

Wait, another way: The two flasks are initially at the same temperature, same volume, same pressure. When one is cooled, the number of moles in that flask decreases because the volume would change. Wait, but no, because the volume is kept the same. Let me think, if I have a container at 373K, pressure P, volume V. So n = PV/(RT). If I change the temperature to 273K, the pressure would be nRT/(V) = P*(T_new / T_initial) → P_new = P*(273/373) → ~0.732 P.

But in this case, the other flask remains at 373 K, so its pressure remains P =0.25 atm.

So the total pressure is 0.25 + (0.25 * 273/373) → 0.25 + 0.183 = 0.433 atm.

Which is approximately 0.433, so likely option B (0.423) is the closest, but perhaps in the calculation I overestimated?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the initial pressures.

Wait, the initial total pressure is 0.5 atm, which is the sum of the two flasks. Each has 0.25 atm. So each flask initially contributes 0.25 atm.

When the first is cooled, its pressure is 0.25 * (273/373) ≈ 0.183 atm.

The second remains at 0.25 atm.

So total pressure is 0.183 + 0.25 = 0.433 atm.

Looking at the options, 0.423 is option B. But wait, another thought: perhaps the volume of each flask changes when cooled.

Wait, that's a point I neglected. Because if the gas is cooled, and the container is rigid, the volume would change. So, the ideal gas law says that for a fixed volume, pressure is inversely proportional to temperature. So, wait, but in this case, the container is a flask, which is rigid. So the volume doesn't change.

Wait, in this problem, each flask is a separate container. So the volume of each flask remains V. So when the first flask is cooled, the pressure in that flask would be (n1 R T1)/V = (n1 R / V) * T1.

But from the initial condition, (n1 R / V) = (0.25 atm) / (373 K) → so P1 = (0.25/373) *273 = 0.25 * 273/373 ≈ 0.25 * 0.732 ≈ 0.183 atm.

Similarly, the second remains at 0.25 atm.

So the total pressure is 0.433 atm, which is approximately 0.433. But the options don't have that. The closest is option B, which is 0.423. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Another approach: Let's consider that each flask has a volume V. Initially, both have pressure P_initial = 0.5 atm, and each has 2 moles (n1 = n2 = n). So the initial pressure is (2n R T_initial)/V = 0.5 atm.

So, (2n R T_initial) / V = 0.5 → 2n R T_initial = 0.5 V → n = (0.5 V) / (2 R T_initial) → n = V/(4 R T_initial).

When one is cooled, its n1 becomes (n * T1) / T_initial.

So, P1 = (n1 R T1)/V = ( (n T1) / T_initial ) R / V → (n R / V) * T1.

We have n R / V = (0.5 V) / (2 R T_initial) * (R) → wait, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Wait, from the initial condition: 2n R T_initial = 0.5 V → n R T_initial = 0.25 V.

So, (n R / V) = 0.25 / T_initial.

Thus, for P1: 0.25 / T_initial * T1 → (0.25 * 273) / 373 ≈ (73.25) / 373 ≈ 0.196 atm.

P2 remains 0.25 atm.

Total pressure: 0.196 +0.25 = 0.446 atm.

Wait, that's a different number. Why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the initial setup. Let me model each flask as being at a certain pressure, and when one is cooled, the pressure of that flask changes according to the ideal gas law.

In the beginning:

Each flask has pressure P, same volume V, same temperature T.

So, n1 = PV/(RT).

The total pressure is 2P=0.5 atm → P=0.25 atm.

So, n1 = (0.25 * V )/( R * T ).

When one is cooled to 273 K, its pressure becomes P1 = (n1 R T1) / V.

So, P1 = ( (0.25 V)/( R T ) ) * R T1 / V ) = 0.25 * (T1 / T ) → 0.25 * (273 / 373 ) ≈ 0.25 * 0.732 → 0.183 atm.

The other flask remains at P =0.25 atm.

So, the total pressure is 0.183 + 0.25 = 0.433 atm. So option B, which is 0.423, is the closest.

But perhaps I need to consider the fact that when the gas is cooled, the number of moles changes because the same volume (but perhaps the container's volume is fixed, so the pressure changes with temperature). Alternatively, perhaps the number of moles is the same, but temperature changes, so pressure is proportional to temperature.

Wait, in that case, the first flask (cooled) would have a pressure of 0.25 atm * (273/373) → 0.25 * 0.732 = 0.183 atm.

The second remains at 0.25 atm.

So, total is 0.433 atm.

Looking at the options, the correct answer should be option B: 0.423.

Wait, but wait another moment. Another approach: Let's consider the pressure as a function of temperature. The pressure of an ideal gas is given by P = (n R T)/V.

The number of moles, n, is constant if the amount of gas doesn't change.

So, if one flask is cooled, its temperature decreases, so its pressure decreases, but the other remains the same.

So, initial total pressure is (n1 R T1 + n2 R T2 ) / V.

Wait, but the problem states that initially, both flasks are filled with the same amount of gas, so n1 = n2 = n.

In the initial condition, both gases are at temperature T_initial = 373 K.

So, the initial total pressure is 2P_initial = 0.5 atm → P_initial = 0.25 atm.

So, n R T_initial / V = 0.25 → n R = 0.25 V / T_initial.

Each flask has n1 = n, V = V, T_initial = T_initial.

When one is cooled, it's temperature is T1 = 273 K.

So, n1 R T1 / V = (n R) * (273) / V = (0.25 V / T_initial) * (273) / V = 0.25 * (273)/(373) → 0.25 * 0.732 → 0.183 atm.

The other flask is at T2 = 373 K, so P2 = 0.25 atm.

Total pressure: 0.183 +0.25 = 0.433 atm.

So, the answer is 0.433 atm. So, it's approximately 0.433. So, the closest option is B: 0.423.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that when the gas is cooled, the number of moles in the first flask decreases because volume is fixed. Wait, but the problem states that each flask is a separate container. So the volume of each flask is fixed. So, the only thing that changes is the temperature and thus the pressure.

Wait, another approach: Let me calculate the number of moles.

For the first flask, after cooling:

P = (n * R * T) / V.

We know that (n R V) / T = 0.25 V → because (n R T) / V = 0.25 → so n R V = 0.25 V * T → n R V = 0.25 V * 373 → n R = (0.25 * 373) / V.

Wait, but n R is 0.25 * 373 / V.

So, for the first flask, n1 = (0.25 * 373) / (V * R).

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me stick to the initial approach.

So, the total pressure is approximately 0.433 atm. The closest option is B: 0.423. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but in the options, option B is 0.423, and option C is 0.600. But 0.433 is closer to 0.423 than 0.6.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me compute 273/373 precisely.

273 ÷ 373 = ?

Well, 373 × 0.7 = 261.1.

0.7 is 0.7.

Wait, 373 × 0.73 = 373 × 0.7 + 373 × 0.03.

= 261.1 + 11.19 = 272.29.

So, 373 × 0.73 = 272.29.

But 273 is 0.73 + (273-272.29)/373 = 0.73 + 0.71/373.

0.71 /373 ≈ 0.0019.

So, 0.73 + 0.0019 ≈ 0.7319.

Wait, but that's 0.7319, so 0.7319.

Wait, but 273/373 = (273*1)/(373*1) = 273 /373.

Let me compute it as a decimal.

373 × 0.7 = 261.1 → 261.1.

373 × 0.73 = 261.1 + (373 × 0.003) = 261.1 + 1.119 = 262.219.

Wait, but 273 is more than 262.219. So, 0.73 ×373 = 262.219, which is less than 273. So, how much more do we need?

The difference is 273 -262.219 = 10.781.

So, 10.781 / 373 = approximately 0.0289.

So, 0.73 + 0.0289 = 0.7589.

Wait, that can't be right because 373 ×0.7589 is way more than 273.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculate.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 273 divided by 373.

Let me try 373 × 0.732 = ?

373 × 0.7 = 261.1.

373 × 0.03 = 11.19 → 261.1 + 11.19 = 272.29.

373 × 0.002 = 0.746 → 272.29 + 0.746 = 273.036.

So 373 × 0.732 = 273.036, which is just a bit more than 273.

So, 373 × 0.732 ≈ 273.036 → so 273 ÷373 = approximately 0.732 - (0.036/373) → 0.732 - 0.0000966 → approximately 0.7319.

So, approximately 0.7319.

So, (273/373) ≈ 0.7319.

So, the pressure of the first flask is 0.25 atm × 0.7319 ≈ 0.18298 atm.

The second flask remains at 0.25 atm.

So, the total pressure is 0.18298 + 0.25 = 0.43298 atm, approximately 0.433 atm.

So, the correct answer is 0.433 atm, which is closest to option B: 0.423.

Wait, but another thought: Perhaps the total number of moles is 1, and the pressure depends on the product. Alternatively, perhaps the pressure of each flask is calculated with the same number of moles but different temperatures. Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this.

Another approach: Let me think about the gases in the two flasks. Since each is a separate container, the volume is fixed. When one is cooled, the pressure in that flask changes, but the other remains the same.

So, the pressure of the cooled flask is (n R T1)/V = (n R T_initial) * (T1/T_initial) = 0.25 atm * (273/373) ≈ 0.25 * 0.732 ≈ 0.183 atm.

The other flask remains at 0.25 atm.

So, the total pressure is 0.183 +0.25 = 0.433 atm.

Which is approximately 0.433. So, the closest option is B: 0.423.

So, the answer is B.
</think>

The problem involves two identical flasks, each containing a gas at the same initial conditions. One flask is cooled, and the goal is to determine the new total pressure.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Conditions**:  
   - Both flasks are at the same temperature, \( T_{\text{initial}} = 373 \, \text{K} \).  
   - Each flask contains the same amount of gas, \( n \), and the same volume, \( V \).  
   - The total pressure is the sum of the pressures in both flasks:  
     \[
     P_{\text{total, initial}} = P_1 + P_2 = 0.5 \, \text{atm}.
     \]  
     Since both flasks contribute equally, each contributes \( 0.25 \, \text{atm} \).

2. **After Cooling**:  
   - One flask is cooled to \( T_1 = 273 \, \text{K} \).  
   - The pressure of the cooled flask is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
     \[
     P_1 = \frac{nRT_1}{V}.
     \]  
     From the initial conditions, \( \frac{nRT_{\text{initial}}}{V} = 0.25 \, \text{atm} \).  
     Substituting \( T_1 \):  
     \[
     P_1 = 0.25 \, \text{atm} \cdot \frac{T_1}{T_{\text{initial}}} = 0.25 \cdot \frac{273}{373} \approx 0.25 \cdot 0.732 \approx 0.183 \, \text{atm}.
     \]  
     The other flask remains at \( 0.25 \, \text{atm} \).

3. **Total Pressure**:  
   The total pressure after cooling is:  
   \[
   P_{\text{total}} = P_1 + P_2 = 0.183 \, \text{atm} + 0.25 \, \text{atm} = 0.433 \, \text{atm}.
   \]  

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The closest option to \( 0.433 \, \text{atm} \) is \( 0.423 \, \text{atm} \) (Option B).

### Conclusion:
The new total pressure is approximately \( 0.433 \, \text{atm} \), which is closest to option B: \( 0.423 \, \text{atm} \).

ANSWER: B
