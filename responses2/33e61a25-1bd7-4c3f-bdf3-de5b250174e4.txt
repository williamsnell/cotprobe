Okay, so I've got this problem about the decay constant of radium and how many disintegrations happen in 100 grams. Hmm, let's think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my radioactivity, but I remember some formulas.

The question gives the decay constant (λ) as 1.36 × 10^-11 s^-1. I think the formula for the number of disintegrations per second (which is the activity, A) is λ multiplied by the number of atoms (N). So A = λ * N.

Wait, right, the decay constant is related to the half-life, but here I don't have the half-life. Oh wait, the problem gives me the molecular weight of radium, which is 226 g/mol. So I need to find the number of moles in 100 grams and then convert that to the number of atoms.

First, calculate the number of moles. Moles = mass / molecular weight. So 100 g divided by 226 g/mol. Let me compute that. 100 / 226 is approximately 0.4425 moles.

Now, to get the number of atoms, I multiply moles by Avogadro's number. Avogadro's number is about 6.022 × 10^23 atoms per mole. So 0.4425 moles * 6.022e23 atoms/mol. Let me compute that.

0.4425 * 6.022e23. So 0.4425 * 6.022 is approximately 2.665e23 atoms? Wait, wait: 0.4425 *6.022 is around 2.666e23? Let me calculate: 0.4425 *6 = 2.655, 0.4425 *0.022=0.009735. So total is about 2.655 + 0.009735=2.664735e23, which approximates to 2.665 ×10^23 atoms.

Now, the decay constant λ is given, so activity A = λ * N. λ is 1.36e-11 s^-1, and N is 2.665e23.

Multiplying them together: 1.36e-11 * 2.665e23. Let's compute these exponents first. 1e-11 * 1e23 is 1e12. So 1.36 * 2.665 is about 3.62, so 3.62e12 s^-1.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let me compute 1.36 × 2.665.

1.36 * 2 = 2.72, 1.36 *0.665 is approx 0.8984. So total is 2.72 + 0.8984 = 3.6184. So about 3.62. So activity is 3.62e12 dis/sec. Wait, but looking at the options, that's option J: 3.62 ×10^12 dis/sec.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recheck the steps because sometimes I might have messed up a step.

Wait, the number of moles is 100/226 = approx 0.4425 mol. Then atoms = 0.4425 * 6.022e23 = approx 2.665e23 atoms. Then activity is 1.36e-11 * 2.665e23.

Exponent: 1e-11 * 1e23 = 1e12. 1.36 * 2.665 is about 3.62 (as before). So 3.62e12 dis/sec.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option J is 3.62 × 10^12, which matches. So the answer should be option J.

To determine the number of disintegrations per second in 100 g of radium, we use the formula for radioactive decay:

\[
A = \lambda \cdot N
\]

where \( A \) is the activity (disintegrations per second), \( \lambda \) is the decay constant (\( 1.36 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{s}^{-1} \)), and \( N \) is the number of atoms.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of moles
The molecular weight of radium is given as \( 226 \, \text{g/mol} \). The number of moles in 100 g is:

\[
\text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molecular Weight}} = \frac{100}{226} \approx 0.4425 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of atoms
Using Avogadro's number (\( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol} \)), the number of atoms is:

\[
N = \text{Moles} \cdot \text{Avogadro's Number} = 0.4425 \cdot 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 2.665 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the activity
The activity is given by:

\[
A = \lambda \cdot N = (1.36 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (2.665 \times 10^{23}) = (1.36 \cdot 2.665) \times 10^{12}.
\]

Calculating \( 1.36 \cdot 2.665 \) gives approximately \( 3.62 \), so:

\[
A \approx 3.62 \times 10^{12} \, \text{dis/sec}.
\]

### Final Answer
Comparing this result with the options, the correct choice is:
