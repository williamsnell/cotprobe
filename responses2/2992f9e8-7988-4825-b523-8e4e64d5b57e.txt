Okay, so I need to figure out the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is circular with a diameter of 40 feet, so the radius must be half of that, which is 20 feet. The depth increases from 2 feet at the south end to 7 feet at the north end. It says the depth is constant along east-west lines, which I think means that the depth varies only along the north-south direction.

Hmm, so the pool's shape is like a cylinder but with a varying height. Since the depth changes linearly, the pool's cross-section is a trapezoid when viewed from the side. Wait, actually, no, because the cross-section is circular. Let me think again. Since the diameter is 40 ft, the radius is 20 ft. The depth increases from 2 ft to 7 ft over the entire length. Wait, is the diameter 40 ft, so the radius is 20 ft. So the length of the pool is 40 ft. Oh wait, the diameter is 40 ft, so the radius is 20 ft. But the diameter is the length from one end to the other? No, wait, in a circular pool, the diameter would be the distance across, so that's the depth. Wait, no, the diameter is 40 ft, so the radius is 20 ft. But wait, the pool is circular, so the diameter is the total length across, meaning the radius is 20 ft. So the diameter is 40 ft, radius 20 ft.

Now, the depth is constant along east-west lines, meaning it's the same across the pool's width, but changes along the north-south direction. So the pool is shaped like a cylinder but with a varying height from 2 ft to 7 ft. Wait, no, a cylinder would have a constant depth. But here, the depth varies, so it's not a cylinder.

Wait a second, so the pool's shape is a cylinder that's been modified along the depth. Since the depth increases from 2 ft to 7 ft across the length of the pool, which is 40 ft, the cross-section is a rectangle that tapers from 2 ft to 7 ft over a length of 40 ft. But wait, that's not quite right because the pool is circular. Oh, perhaps not. Let me visualize it.

Alternatively, maybe I should model it as a circular pool with varying depth. But the problem says the depth increases linearly from 2 ft at the south end to 7 ft at the north end. So the depth varies along the north-south axis, but is the same across the east-west axis. So the pool's shape is a cylinder with varying height.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as a cylinder that's been extruded with a varying cross-section. So the cross-section is a rectangle, but varying in depth. Hmm, but the pool is a circle, so the cross-section isn't just a rectangle. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Wait, the pool is circular in shape, but the depth varies along the east-west (horizontal) direction, while it's constant along the north-south (vertical) direction. So in cross-section, the depth varies from 2 ft at the south end to 7 ft at the north end. So the depth is a function of the north-south position.

So, to find the volume, I can model this as a cylinder with varying cross-sectional area. But perhaps it's easier to model this as a surface of revolution. Let's consider the cross-section as a rectangle that's 40 ft long (north-south) and 20 ft wide (east-west), but the depth increases from 2 ft at one end to 7 ft at the other. Wait, but the pool is circular, not rectangular. Oh, maybe I should think in cylindrical coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the pool as a cylinder with an elliptical cross-section, but no, the problem says the depth is constant along east-west lines, which implies the cross-section is circular. Wait, perhaps I should model it as a circular cylinder where the radius varies linearly from 0 at the south end to 20 ft at the north end. Because the depth increases from 2 ft to 7 ft over the entire length. Wait, but the radius is 20 ft, and the depth is 2 ft at the south, 7 ft at the north. So perhaps the radius increases with depth? No, wait. Wait, the depth is along the north-south direction. Wait, no, the radius is a function of position.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to model the pool as a circular region where each point along the north-south axis has a certain depth. So, the pool's shape can be described as a circular region with radius 20 ft, and the depth at a point (x, y) is given by the linear function that goes from 2 ft at x = -20 ft (south end) to 7 ft at x = +20 ft (north end), with y being the east-west position.

Wait, but maybe it's simpler to model the depth as a function of the position along the north-south axis. Since the pool is circular, any point on the surface is at a radius of 20 ft, but the depth varies along the north-south axis. So perhaps the depth function is a linear function of the position along the north-south direction.

Let me think of the pool as a circle with radius 20 ft, lying along the y-axis. The north-south direction is along the y-axis, with the center at (0,0). The depth at any point along the y-axis is 2 ft at y = -20 ft (south end, y=-20) and 7 ft at y = +20 ft (north end, y=+20). So the depth d(y) is given by a linear function.

So, the depth as a function of y is:

d(y) = ( (7-2)/(20 - (-20)) ) * (y - (-20)) + 2.

Wait, but maybe it's better to model it as d(y) = 2 + ( (7-2)/(40) ) * (y + 20). Because the change in depth is 5 ft over a span of 40 ft (from y=-20 to y=+20). So, the slope is 5/40 = 1/8 ft per foot in y.

So, d(y) = 2 + (1/8)(y + 20) = 2 + (y +20)/8 = (16 + y +20)/8 = (y +36)/8.

Wait, let me compute that again. Let's see:

The change in depth from y=-20 to y=+20 is 5 ft. So, (y +20) is the distance from the south end, so when y is -20, (y +20)=0, so depth is 2. When y is +20, (y+20)=40, depth is 2 + (40/8) = 2 +5 =7. So yes, that works.

So, d(y) = 2 + (y+20)/8.

But wait, the depth is a function of y, but the pool is circular, so each point (x,y) on the surface has a certain depth d(y). To find the volume, we can integrate the area along the circle, but since the depth varies with y, we need to compute the integral of depth over the area of the pool.

Wait, the pool's cross-section is a circle with radius 20 ft. So any point (x,y) on the circle satisfies x² + y² = (20)^2 =400.

The depth at (x,y) is d(y) = 2 + (y +20)/8.

So, the volume V is the double integral over the circle of d(y) dA. So, V = ∫∫ d(y) dx dy.

Since d(y) is 2 + (y+20)/8, which is a function of y only, maybe I can compute this by converting to polar coordinates. But integrating in polar coordinates might complicate things, but let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the area of the pool and multiply by the average depth. Wait, no, because the cross-sectional area isn't constant; it's varying with y. But wait, actually, the cross-section is a circle, so the average depth can be found by integrating d(y) over the area of the circle and then dividing by the area of the circle.

Wait, but let me think again. The pool's shape isn't a cylinder; it's a cylinder with varying radius as the depth varies. Wait, no, the radius is fixed as the pool is circular, but the depth changes along the y-axis. So, the cross-sectional area at each y is a circle with radius 20 ft, but the depth is the height.

Wait, no, maybe I should model it differently. Each point in the pool has a certain depth, which is a function of its y-coordinate. So, the pool's shape is a circle, but the height at each point is varying along y.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the pool as a cylinder whose radius varies with y. But no, the pool is circular, so the radius is fixed. The depth only varies along the north-south axis (y-axis). So, each point on the surface of the pool has a depth that varies with y.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to parametrize the pool as a function. The pool is a circular region with radius 20 ft, centered at (0,0), and the depth at any point (x,y) is given by 2 + (y +20)/8. So, the depth function is d(y) = 2 + (y +20)/8.

Now, to compute the volume, we can set up a double integral over the circular region:

V = ∫∫ d(y) dx dy.

Since the cross-section is circular, it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. Let me express x and y in terms of polar coordinates: x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, where r ranges from 0 to 20 ft, and θ ranges from 0 to 2π.

The depth d(y) = 2 + (y +20)/8 = 2 + (r sinθ +20)/8 = 2 + (r sinθ)/8 + (20)/8 = 2 + (r sinθ)/8 + 2.5.

Wait, that's 2 + 2.5 = 4.5? Wait, 20/8 is 2.5. So, d(y) = 2 + (r sinθ)/8 + 2.5 = 4.5 + (r sinθ)/8.

Wait, no, wait: (y +20)/8 = (r sinθ +20)/8. So, d(y) = 2 + (r sinθ +20)/8.

Which is 2 + (20)/8 + (r sinθ)/8 = 2 + 2.5 + (r sinθ)/8 = 4.5 + (r sinθ)/8.

So, d(y) = 4.5 + (r sinθ)/8.

So the integral becomes:

V = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 20) [4.5 + (r sinθ)/8 ] * r dr dθ.

Because in polar coordinates, dA = r dr dθ.

So, let me write V as:

V = ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^{20} [4.5 + (r sinθ)/8 ] * r dr dθ.

Let me split this into two integrals:

V = ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^{20} 4.5 r dr dθ + ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^{20} (r^2 sinθ)/8 dr dθ.

So, first integral: I1 = ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^{20} 4.5 r dr dθ.

Second integral: I2 = ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^{20} (r^2 sinθ)/8 dr dθ.

Let me compute I1 first.

Compute I1:

I1 = 4.5 ∫₀^{2π} dθ ∫₀^{20} r dr.

The inner integral ∫ r dr from 0 to 20 is [ (1/2 r²) ] from 0 to 20 = (1/2)(400) = 200.

The outer integral ∫ dθ from 0 to 2π is 2π.

So, I1 = 4.5 * 2π * 200 = 4.5 * 400π = 1800π.

Now, I2:

I2 = (1/8) ∫₀^{2π} sinθ dθ ∫₀^{20} r² dr.

Compute the inner integral ∫ r² dr from 0 to 20: [ r³ /3 ] from 0 to20 = (8000)/3.

The outer integral ∫ sinθ dθ from 0 to 2π is 0, because the integral of sinθ over a full cycle is zero.

So, I2 = (1/8) * 0 * (8000/3) ) = 0.

So, total V = I1 + I2 = 1800π + 0 = 1800π ft³.

Wait, but that's one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options: A:1800π, B:1400π, etc.

So, the correct answer is A: 1800π ft³.

The swimming pool is circular with a diameter of 40 ft, so its radius is 20 ft. The depth increases linearly from 2 ft at the south end to 7 ft at the north end, meaning the depth varies along the east-west (north-south) direction. The pool's shape is circular, and the depth function is given by \( d(y) = 2 + \frac{y + 20}{8} \), where \( y \) is the north-south coordinate.

To find the volume, we compute the double integral of the depth function over the circular cross-section. Converting to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)) allows us to set up the integral as:

\[
V = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{20} \left( 4.5 + \frac{r \sin\theta}{8} \right) r \, dr \, d\theta
\]

This integral is split into two parts:

1. \( I_1 = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{20} 4.5r \, dr \, d\theta \):  
   The inner integral \( \int_0^{20} r \, dr = 200 \), and the outer integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \). Thus, \( I_1 = 4.5 \cdot 2\pi \cdot 200 = 1800\pi \).

2. \( I_2 = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{20} \frac{r^2 \sin\theta}{8} \, dr \, d\theta \):  
   The inner integral \( \int_0^{20} r^2 \, dr = \frac{8000}{3} \), and the integral of \( \sin\theta \) over \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \) is 0. Thus, \( I_2 = 0 \).

Adding the results, \( V = I_1 + I_2 = 1800\pi \).

The correct answer is:
