The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"If it be conceded, as it must be by every one who is the least conversant with our institutions, that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion."
â€”John C. Calhoun, "South Carolina Exposition and Protest," 1828

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about John C. Calhoun's passage, and I need to figure out which issue he was referring to. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question asks which issue precipitated the passage excerpt given. The options are from A to J. The passage is about the division of sovereign powers between the General and State Governments, and the idea that dividing power isn't about reducing sovereignty but rather about keeping it as a subordinate condition. It talks about the right of judging infringing powers being given to the States and how that doesn't divide the power but just redistributes it, leading to a consolidation of power.

I remember that John C. Calhoun was a proponent of the South's secession from the Union. He was a member of the South's political party, which was the Republican Party. In the 1820s, there were various attempts to secede, especially with the Missouri Compromise and other state laws that allowed for secession. The passage seems to be discussing the politics of secession, maybe how the states' rights were being challenged.

The passage mentions that the states' right to adjudicate and correct their own powers isn't divested but leads to a more consolidated government. So the issue here was probably the South's desire to secede, which led to various political and legal challenges, including the Missouri Compromise. That act was a significant event that allowed the secession of the South, but it also had implications on the states' rights and how power was handled.

Looking at the options, the options are about different states' rights or issues. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: the question of secession from the Union. Well, Calhoun was a proponent of secession, so this must be related. But the passage is more about the division of power and the consequences, not the cause.

Option B: the Missouri Compromise. That's part of the South's attempts to secede. The Missouri Compromise was a key event in the 1820s that allowed the secession of Missouri, which was a significant step toward the South's desire to secede.

Option C: slavery in new territories. The passage doesn't mention slavery; it's more about states' rights and power division.

Option D: purchase of Louisiana territory. That's part of the 1803 Shattuck Ante-Terrace Act, but it's not directly related to the South's secession. The passage is about the division of power, not the acquisition of land.

Option E: removal of American Indians from the South. That's tied to the Homestead Act of 1862, which the South used to push for Indian removal. Calhoun's work might have touched on that, but I don't think it's the main issue here.

Option F: the passage of an act creating higher tariff rates. Calhoun's passage is about state power, not economic acts.

Option G: the debate over states' rights. That seems related. The passage discusses the right of states to adjudicate and correct their own powers, which ties into the debate over states' rights.

Option H: the funding of "internal improvements." That's a different topic, more about government spending rather than secession.

Option I: the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States. That's a historical event that happened before Calhoun's passage, so it's unrelated.

Option J: the passing of the Fugitive Slave Act. That was a specific event in the 19th century that dealt with slavery, not the South's secession.

So, back to the options. The passage's issue is about the division of power between the General and State Governments, implying that the states' rights aren't being separated but instead given to the same tenure. This relates to the debate over states' rights, which is option G. Alternatively, the Missouri Compromise (option B) was a key event that contributed to the South's desire to secede, but the passage itself is about the political and legal issues that led to the South's secession. However, the question is about the issue precipitating the passage, which is the political and legal problem of states' rights and power division.

Wait, but in the passage, the issue is about the division of power, which relates to the debate over states' rights. So the answer is G: the debate over states' rights. But I'm a bit confused because I thought the question was about the secession, which was option A. Let me think again.

Wait, the passage is discussing the political issues, not the actual causes of secession. The issue precipitating the passage is the problem that led to the South's desire to secede. That problem is the division of power between the governments, which ties into option G.

Alternatively, the passage might be illustrating a broader issue in the political arena, which is the division of power, not the causes of secession. So perhaps the question is about the broader political problem, not the cause.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the issue that precipitated the passage." The passage is about the division of power between the two governments, which is a political issue. So the issue is about how power is divided, which is the debate over states' rights, which is option G.

But wait, another angle: the passage mentions that the states' right to adjudicate is an essential attribute of sovereignty. It argues that dividing power doesn't reduce sovereignty but creates a situation where the states have to delegate, but that's a more of a theoretical point.

Alternatively, the issue could be about the Missouri Compromise, which allowed the secession of the South. But the question is about the issue that precipitated the passage, which is the political debate.

So the correct answer is G: the debate over states' rights.
</think>

The passage discusses the issue of power division between the General and State governments, arguing that dividing power doesn't reduce sovereignty but instead consolidates it. This relates to the broader debate over states' rights, which is option G. The context of the passage is the political and legal issues that contributed to the South's desire to secede, but the issue precipitating the passage itself is the political debate over states' rights.

Answer: G
