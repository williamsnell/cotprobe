Okay, so I have this question about team-based selling, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question asks about the primary objective of team-based selling. The options are A through J, each making a different point. I remember that team-based selling is a sales approach where salespeople work together, which can influence sales performance and customer interactions.

Option A says equitable management of the sales bonus pool. I'm not sure about this. I think equitable might be about distributing the bonus fairly, but I'm not certain if that's the main objective of team-based selling.

Option B is about increasing the competitiveness within the sales team. That sounds plausible because working together can drive each other to perform better, so maybe that's the main goal.

Option C talks about creating multiple points of contact between customers and the company. That makes sense because team-based selling emphasizes communication and building relationships, so more direct interactions with customers can build trust.

Option D is about distributing work in managing accounts. I'm not sure if that's the primary objective. Maybe it's more about how the work is divided, but I'm not certain.

Option E says it's to reduce individual workload. I think this is true. When people work together, each person's workload is shared, so this could be a main objective.

Option F is about ensuring every employee interacts with customers. This seems very important because without good communication, the team can't effectively manage accounts, which is part of team-based selling.

Option G is about diversifying the customer base. While team-based selling can help with that, is it the primary objective? I'm not sure.

Option H is about matching customer needs with company functions. That definitely fits because team-based selling focuses on tailoring the approach to the customer's needs, which is about aligning with their specific requirements.

Option I is about simplifying sales negotiation. I think that's more about the process, maybe not the main objective.

Option J is about providing a single point of contact. That sounds like a customer service role, which team-based selling might involve, but I'm not sure if it's the primary objective.

Now, considering all these, team-based selling aims to make the sales team work together, which encourages better performance and stronger sales teams. So the main objectives are likely to increase competitiveness, enhance communication, simplify tasks, and possibly improve customer satisfaction.

Looking back, option B is about increasing competitiveness. That makes sense because when salespeople work together and share responsibilities, they can perform better for the company. Option H is about matching customer needs, which is another key aspect of team-based selling.

Wait, the question is about the primary objective. So the correct answer must be the one that captures the core benefit of team-based selling. Team-based selling emphasizes collaboration, communication, and effective coordination, which directly relate to competitive performance and customer satisfaction.

I think the primary objective is about equitable management of the bonus pool, but actually, no. Option B about increasing competitiveness is a strong candidate. But another point is about communication, which is covered in option H. However, the question is about the primary objective. So perhaps the main goal is to increase the team's competitiveness by working together, thus each member's contribution is better utilized. Or maybe it's about simplifying the negotiation process by having a single point of contact.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall what team-based selling is about. It's more about the sales team working together, which includes better coordination, communication, and potentially more tailored approaches. So the primary objective is probably to increase the team's competitiveness, as working together allows each member to contribute more effectively.

Alternatively, team-based selling might focus on simplifying negotiations and communication, which would tie into options E and J. But I'm not sure if that's the main goal. I think the primary goal is about working together to be more competitive and effective.

Looking again at the options, option B is about increasing competitiveness within the sales team. That seems to fit because working together makes each salesperson better at their job, leading to higher sales.

So, the correct answer should be option B: increase the competitiveness within the sales team.

The correct answer is B: increase the competitiveness within the sales team. Team-based selling emphasizes collaboration among salespeople, which enhances each member's ability to perform effectively, leading to increased competitiveness.
