Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. The question is about how to determine your latitude by locating the North Celestial Pole (NCP). Hmm, I remember that the NCP is a key concept in celestial navigation. Let me think about what I know.

Wait, the NCP is directly above your zenith, right? So when you look up at the sky, the NCP is in the direction directly above you. Now, latitude is the angle north or south of the equator. I think the position of the NCP relative to the celestial equator might be related to your latitude. Oh right! The celestial equator is an imaginary line in the sky, and the NCP is directly above your zenith, which is along the vertical line through your head.

So, if I imagine the celestial sphere, the NCP is on the same line as the North Celestial Pole. And I remember that the declination of the NCP is 0 degrees because it's directly above the Earth's poles. Declination is similar to latitude but in the sky. So if the NCP is at a certain altitude, that altitude is equal to your latitude. Like, if you're at the North Pole, your altitude would be 90 degrees, and that's right, the NCP would be at the zenith. Similarly, if you're at the equator, the NCP would be at the horizon, which is 0 degrees altitude.

Looking at the options, option D says the altitude of the NCP is the same as your latitude. That sounds correct because when you're at latitude φ, the NCP is at altitude φ. So D seems right.

Wait, what about the azimuth? Azimuth is the angle you measure from true north in the sky, typically measured clockwise. I don't think azimuth is used directly to find latitude. Azimuth would be more relevant for things like determining the direction of objects in the sky. So options B, C, F, etc., don't seem to directly relate to latitude.

So the correct answer should be D.

To determine your latitude using the North Celestial Pole (NCP), the key concept is that the NCP's altitude in the sky corresponds to your geographic latitude. When you look up at the NCP, its altitude is equal to your latitude. 

- **Option A** and **Option B** are incorrect because they confuse celestial distances with physical distances (e.g., altitude vs. angle from the equator or equator vs. south pole).
- **Option C** is incorrect because it incorrectly states that the NCP's altitude is its distance from the equator.
- **Options D, F, G, I, and J** involve incorrect relationships between the NCP and latitude or longitude.
- **Option H and I** are unrelated to latitude.
- **Option D** correctly states that the altitude of the NCP equals your latitude.

Thus, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: D
