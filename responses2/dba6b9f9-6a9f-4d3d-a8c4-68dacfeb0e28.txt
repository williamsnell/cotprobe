Okay, so I have this question here about Mr. Hammer's disposable income and his propensity to save. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, I remember that disposable income is the amount of money someone can spend after paying taxes and other necessary expenses. But wait, sometimes it's just total income minus taxes. But in this case, the question says his disposable income last year was $5,000. So I can use that number directly.

His total expenditures were $4,600. Hmm, so if he spends $4,600 out of his $5,000, that means he saved the remaining amount. So I should subtract his total expenditures from his disposable income to find his savings.

Let me calculate that: $5,000 (income) minus $4,600 (expenditures) equals $400 saved. So he saved $400.

Now, the question is about his propensity to save. Propensity to save is the percentage of disposable income that people choose to save rather than spend. So I need to find what percentage $400 is of his total disposable income of $5,000.

To find the percentage, I can use the formula: (Savings / Disposable Income) * 100. Plugging in the numbers: ($400 / $5,000) * 100.

Let me compute that. 400 divided by 5000 is 0.08, and multiplying by 100 gives me 8%. So his propensity to save is 8%.

Looking at the options, option F is 8%. So the correct answer should be F.

The correct answer is F: 8%.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Disposable Income (I):** Mr. Hammer's disposable income is $5,000.
2. **Total Expenditures (E):** He spent $4,600.
3. **Savings (S):** $5,000 - $4,600 = $400.
4. **Propensity to Save:** ($400 / $5,000) * 100 = 8%.

Answer: F
