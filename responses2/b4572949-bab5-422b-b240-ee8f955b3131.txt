Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about standard scores, specifically T-scores. I'm a bit rusty on this, so let me think it through carefully.

The question is about understanding what T-scores are and which statement correctly describes them. The options are from A to J, each with a different statement.

First, I remember that standard scores can be of different types. The most common ones are Z-scores, which show how many SDs a score is from the mean. But T-scores are a bit different. I think T-scores were developed to make the mean 50 and the standard deviation 10. That makes sense because it's easier to interpret. So, a T-score of 50 would mean the person scored average, and a T-score of 60 would be one SD above average.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: M=0, SD=1, often used in research. Wait, M is the mean, which for T-scores is 50. So this would be a Z-score. A Z-score of 0 would be the mean. I don't think T-scores have M=0. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: M=100, SD=15 or 16. Hmm, that's a T-score. But wait, T-score mean is 50, not 100. So this statement is wrong because it says M=100. So B is incorrect.

Option C: They express raw scores in terms of percentiles. No, I think T-scores are percentile scores, not raw. They convert a standard score to a percentile rank. So C is incorrect.

Option D: M=500, SD=100, often used in college entrance exams. Wait, that sounds familiar. I think the SAT and ACT use T-scores. But the mean is 500 and SD is 100. Oh wait, wait, no. Because T-scores have a mean of 50 and SD of 10. So D's M and SD are way off. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Shows how many standard deviations a score is above or below the mean: a score of +1.0 means it’s 1 SD above the mean. Oh wait, this is describing Z-scores, not T-scores. Because T-scores also use SDs, but their mean is 50 and SD is 10, not 0 and 1. So E is incorrect because it refers to Z-scores, not T.

Option F: M=100, SD=10, commonly used in IQ tests. No, wait, the standard SD for IQ is usually 15, I think. Because the mean is 100, SD 15. So F is wrong.

Option G: M=100, SD=24, typically used in personality assessments. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. I think personality assessments might use other scales, like the MBTI or FIVE-PARadons, which might have different SDs. Also, looking up the standard, I think T-scores are more common in psychological testing. So maybe G is correct, but I'm not certain.

Option H: M=50, SD=10- it is used on many psychological tests, MMPI. Wait, wait. The MMPI's T-score mean is 50 and SD is 10, making it a 50-10 scale. So H says M=50, SD=10, which is correct. So H's statement is correct.

Option I: They express raw scores in terms of ranks. No, I think T-scores aren't ranks; they're percentile scores. So I is incorrect.

Option J: standard nine: M=5, SD=approx 2. Wait, standard nine is a different scoring system (like the WISC), but T-scores are about standard deviation from the mean of 50, not a standard nine scale. So J is incorrect.

Wait, but I thought I might have missed something. Let me go back.

The question is about T-scores. From what I remember:

Standard Deviation (SD) for T-scores is 10. The mean is 50. So any T-score of 60 is one SD above the mean. That matches option E if it were Z-scores, but E is incorrect because it's about Z-scores.

Option F says M=100, SD=10. That's incorrect for T-scores. Because T-scores have M=50 and SD=10. So F is wrong.

Now, looking back at the options, the correct statement about T-scores would be G. Because G says M=100, SD=24, typically used in personality assessments. Wait, I thought personality assessments might use a different scale, like the MBTI, which would have a different mean and SD. Alternatively, maybe G is correct, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about each option again.

Wait, the standard deviation for T-scores is 10, not 24. So H's statement is incorrect. So perhaps G is incorrect. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing MMPI with another test. Let's think. The MMPI-2 has a mean of 50 and SD of 10. So G says M=100, SD=24: that's incorrect. So, no, G is wrong.

Wait, wait. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Let me re-examine each.

The question is: "the standard scores express raw score distance from mean by SD and considered the most satisfactory type of NR score." Oh, so the initial part refers to NR scores, but probably that's a typo and should be T-scores. Because the question is about T-scores.

So the options are about T-scores.

So the correct statement should be about T-scores.

So back to option G: M=100, SD=24, typically used in personality assessments. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because I thought personality assessments might use a different scale, like the Wechsler scales, which have a mean of 100, SD 15. Alternatively, I could be wrong. Maybe the correct M and SD for personality assessments is different. Alternatively, perhaps G is correct because it says M=100, SD=24, which is a different scale. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct statement is option F or G.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each option again.

Option F: M=100, SD=10. No, because T-scores have M=50, SD=10.

Option G: M=100, SD=24. Hmm, 24 as SD for T-scores? No, I think it's 10. So G is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the initial understanding.

Let me re-identify T-scores.

T-scores have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. So M=50, SD=10. So any statement about T-scores must reflect this.

Looking at the options:

Option H: M=50, SD=10. Yes, that's correct. Because that's the standard for T-scores.

But wait, the option says: "It is used on many psychological tests, MMPI." Hmm, does the MMPI use T-scores with M=50 and SD=10?

Wait, I think the MMPI's scores are on a 0-100 scale, but the conversion is different. Or perhaps they use a different scale. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me go through each option again.

Which of these is correct about T-scores?

T-scores: M=50, SD=10. They are used in various psychological tests, including personality assessments.

So, looking at the options:

A: M=0, SD=1. That's Z-scores, not T. So A is wrong.

B: M=100, SD=15 or 16. No, T has M=50. So B is wrong.

C: Express raw in terms of percentiles. No, they are percentile, not raw. So C is wrong.

D: M=500, SD=100. No, that's a Z-score. T is M=50, SD=10.

E: Scores in SDs. E refers to Z-scores, not T. So E is wrong.

F: M=100, SD=10. No, T-scores have M=50.

G: M=100, SD=24. No, T is 10.

H: M=50, SD=10. Yes! That's correct. So H is correct.

I: They express raw scores in terms of ranks. No, they're percentile, not ranks. So I is wrong.

J: standard nine. No, that's a different scoring system, so J is wrong.

But wait, the question says "which statement is about T-scores?" So only option H is correct. But wait, in the options, option H is: "M=50, SD=10- it is used on many psychological tests, MMPI."

Wait, the part about being used on MMPI is confusing. Because I thought MMPI uses 100 and 15 as SD, but perhaps that's not accurate. Alternatively, maybe the MMPI uses a different mean and SD. For instance, the MMPI-2 has a mean of 100 and SD 15, but that's a raw score. T-scores for the MMPI-2 would then be M=50, SD=10, and a z-score of 0. So the MMPI-2 raw score would be 50 + (10* z). So the scaling would be different.

But the question is about T-scores, not MMPI. So the statement about H is correct as to the type of scale (M=50, SD=10). But the part about being used on MMPI is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct statement is H, and the other options are incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about the type of NR score, which I think refers to T-scores. Because the initial part of the question says "the standard(scores) express ... as the most satisfactory type of NR score." Wait, perhaps that's a typo for T-scores.

So, if the statement is about T-scores, then only option H is correct.

Wait, but I'm not very confident. Let me think again.

The only correct statement about T-scores is option H: M=50, SD=10. Because that's the standard for a T-score.

So among the options, H is correct.

Wait, but looking at the other options, perhaps another statement is correct.

Wait, no. Let's re-look.

Wait, option F: M=100, SD=10. No, that's incorrect.

Option G: M=100, SD=24. No.

Option H: M=50, SD=10. Yes.

So the correct statement is option H: "M=50, SD=10- it is used on many psychological tests, MMPI."

Wait, but the part about MMPI is incorrect. Because MMPI's T-score would be M=50, SD=10, which is correct. So, the statement includes the part about being used on MMPI, but that's a mistake.

Wait, but looking at the options, the statement says "It is used on many psychological tests, MMPI." So the second part is incorrect. So the entire statement is wrong. So the correct statement is only H.

So the correct answer is option H.

Wait, but I thought the answer is G. Oh wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier.

Wait, G says M=100, SD=24. I thought that's incorrect. So perhaps G is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about what each option is saying.

Looking at the options again:

Option G: M=100, SD=24, typically used in personality assessments.

I think personality assessments, like the MBTI, use a different scoring system. Their mean is 100 and SD is 15. So G is incorrect because their M is 100 and SD=15, not 24.

So only option H is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the type of NR score. Maybe it's a typo and refers to T-scores. So the correct statement is option H.

Wait, but the options can't have more than one correct statement. So perhaps the correct statement is H, considering the others are incorrect.

Wait, the question says "which statement out of the following ones is about T-scores?"

So the correct statement is H: M=50, SD=10. So the correct answer is H, which is option H.

The question asks about T-scores and which statement correctly describes them. T-scores are a type of standard score used in psychology and education, characterized by a mean (M) of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. They convert a standard score to a percentile rank, making them particularly useful for interpreting raw scores. Let’s analyze each option:

- **Option A**: "M=0, SD=1, often used in research studies." This describes Z-scores, not T-scores, as Z-scores have M=0 and SD=1. **Incorrect**.

- **Option B**: "M=100, SD=15 or 16." This refers to T-scores, but T-scores have M=50, not 100. **Incorrect**.

- **Option C**: "They express raw scores in terms of percentiles." T-scores are percentile scores, not raw scores. **Incorrect**.

- **Option D**: "M=500, SD=100, often used in college entrance exams." This describes Z-scores, not T-scores, as T-scores have M=50 and SD=10. **Incorrect**.

- **Option E**: "Show how many standard deviations a score is above or below the mean: a score of +1.0 means it’s 1 SD above the mean." This describes Z-scores, not T-scores. **Incorrect**.

- **Option F**: "M=100, SD=10, commonly used in IQ tests." T-scores have M=50 and SD=10, not M=100. **Incorrect**.

- **Option G**: "M=100, SD=24, typically used in personality assessments." While personality assessments might use different scales, T-scores have M=50 and SD=10, not 24. **Incorrect**.

- **Option H**: "M=50, SD=10- it is used on many psychological tests, MMPI." T-scores are correctly described as having M=50 and SD=10, and they are used in psychological testing, including the MMPI. **Correct**.

- **Option I**: "They express raw scores in terms of ranks." T-scores are percentile scores, not ranks. **Incorrect**.

- **Option J**: "Standard nine: M=5, SD=approx 2." This describes the WISC-R scoring system, not T-scores. **Incorrect**.

The correct statement about T-scores is **Option H**, as it accurately describes their mean and standard deviation.
