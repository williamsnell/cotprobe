Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about amino acids and their dispensability under stress conditions. The question is asking which amino acid is generally considered dispensable but still required in greater amounts than can be synthesized normally.

Let me start by recalling what I know about amino acids. Under normal conditions, most amino acids are used efficiently, but when stress occurs, some might be needed more. Also, some amino acids are naturally involved in other processes and might not be needed for protein synthesis.

The options given are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me list them out again:

A: Glutamate
B: Tyrosine
C: Alanine
D: Glutamine
E: Arginine
F: Glycine
G: Proline
H: Cysteine
I: Aspartate
J: Serine

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. The options don't have glutamate. Maybe that's a typo. Because glutamate is actually a cofactor, not an amino acid. So perhaps that's a mistake, and the correct options should be glutamine, but let me think. Hmm, no, the question says which is considered dispensable, but I think I might be overcomplicating.

Let me think about each option.

Glutamine (D) is an amino acid. When I was in a stressful situation, like during intense exercise or maybe stress from aahh, I remember that glutamine is often required. I think under stress, proteins can't be made as quickly, so amino acids are needed. Maybe glutamine is a better substitute for glutamate, which is involved in amino acid metabolism.

Tyrosine (B) is a natural amino acid, but I don't think it's a good candidate here. Because if you're under stress, you might need more amino acids, but we can probably rule out tyrosine because it's one of the most abundant, so it's not dispensable.

Alanine (C) is always present, right? It's the most common. So that's not the answer. Even under stress, it's not a problem.

Glycine (F) is another natural amino acid, but I think it's also not a good candidate. It's present in all proteins, so under stress, you wouldn't need more glycine than is naturally present.

Proline (G) is a classic one. I remember that under stress, proline is often required because it's a prolyl-binding amino acid and is part of the cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway. So if you're under stress, you might not be able to produce as much cAMP, so proline is needed. Wait, but is proline considered dispensable? I thought it's not. Or is it? Or maybe it's sometimes used as a substitute.

Wait, another angle: in certain stress conditions, like inducing a stress response, you might need more amino acids than is normally present, but some are more essential. For example, in conditions where the cell needs to produce more amino acids quickly, proline is often a good substitute for glutamine.

Wait, another thought: glutamate is not an amino acid but a cofactor. So option A is incorrect. So the question is about amino acids. So Glutamate can't be the answer.

So looking again, the options are A to J, but A is Glutamate, which is incorrect because it's a cofactor, not an amino acid. So maybe the options have a typo, but I'll proceed.

Back to the question: which amino acid is dispensable but required more than usual. So the options are:

A: Glutamate (no, it's a cofactor, not an amino acid)
B: Tyrosine (highly abundant, not needed)
C: Alanine (always present)
D: Glutamine (maybe needed)
E: Arginine (present in all proteins, so not needed)
F: Glycine (present)
G: Proline (usually needed)
H: Cysteine (present)
I: Aspartate (maybe not)
J: Serine (present)

Wait, the question lists some options that are not amino acids. Oh, wait, the options include aspartate (I), which is a cofactor, not an amino acid. So perhaps the correct answer is among the amino acids in the options.

Wait, the question's options are:

A: Glutamate (non-amino)
B: Tyrosine (highly abundant)
C: Alanine (always present)
D: Glutamine (amino)
E: Arginine (always present)
F: Glycine (always present)
G: Proline (highly present)
H: Cysteine (present)
I: Aspartate (non-amino)
J: Serine (present)

So in the given options, the amino acids are C (Ala), D (Gln), G (Pro), J (Ser).

Under stress, which amino acids are needed more than usual? I think glutamine (D) is needed because, under stress, the body can't make as much glutamine. So glutamine is considered dispensable because it's not always available, but it's used as a substitute. So maybe D is the correct answer.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when you're in a stress situation, like when you're under intense stress, you might need more amino acids than is typically present. For example, more glucose, more amino acids, etc. But some amino acids are essential and are not typically needed in excess. Proline is one such amino acid. So in such stress conditions, you might not need as much as usual, but it's still required in higher amounts than can be synthesized naturally. So Proline (G) is the correct answer. Because under stress, you might need more, but since it's a natural part of the process, it's not always available.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought in some stress conditions, proline is not needed. Wait, no, proline is more of a prolyl-binding amino acid. So under stress when the cell cannot produce enough cyclic AMP to activate proline's binding site, you might need to activate it, so you need more proline. So in that case, even if you can't make as much, you still need a lot more. So Proline is considered dispensable because it's not always available, but it's required in higher amounts than is normally made.

Wait, but wait. There's another thought: under stress, perhaps you need more amino acids than usual, but many of them are not usually needed. For example, glutamine is a good substitute for glutamate (the cofactor), so it's needed under stress. So in that case, the answer would be D (glutamine) or J (serine).

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about what each amino acid is used for.

Glutamine (D) is a nitrogenous base. It's a better substitute for glutamate in amino acid synthesis because it's a more efficient cofactor. So under stress, when the body can't make as much glutamate, glutamine is used instead.

Serine (J) is an amino acid. Under stress, maybe you need more of it than usual. Because, for example, if the cell is under intense stress, you need more amino acids to support functions like protein synthesis. But is it better to substitute for glutamine or something else?

Wait, another point: in some stress conditions, like when the cell is under high metabolic needs, you might need more amino acids than usual. But not all amino acids are needed in higher amounts. For example, maybe only certain ones are required. Proline, for example, is a prolyl-binding amino acid and is part of the cycle. So if the cell can't activate it, you have to make more. So in that case, Proline is considered dispensable because it's not always available, but it's required in higher amounts than usual.

So, the question is which is considered dispensable but required in greater amounts than can be synthesized. So Proline (G) is an amino acid that is not always available, hence it's considered dispensable, but you still need a lot more of it than is usually made because it's part of the stress response.

Another thought: when the cell can't synthesize a particular amino acid enough, it uses another. For instance, glutamate is needed for amino acid synthesis, but glutamine is a better substitute. So under stress, you need more glutamine. So in that case, the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but I'm a bit torn between D and G. Another approach: let's think about what each amino acid is involved in. Glutamine is a more efficient cofactor, so it's used when you can't make glutamate. So if the cell can't make enough glutamate, it uses glutamine. So in this case, D is the answer.

Alternatively, when under stress, you might need more amino acids than usual, but not all are needed. So perhaps serine is an amino acid that is required, but only in higher amounts. But I'm not sure. Let me think about when proteins are made. Under stress, maybe the cell uses more amino acids, but not all the time. For example, in some cases, you might need more amino acids than usual, but some are more critical.

Another angle: the question is about being " dispensable" but "required in greater amount". So if an amino acid is not always needed, it's considered dispensable. For example, cysteine (H) is always present. So it's not dispensable.

So the correct options are C, D, G, J, and F. So among these, which is considered dispensable.

Proline (G) is usually part of the cyclic AMP pathway, so it's not always made. So even if you can produce glutamine, you might need to make more proline. So Proline is considered dispensable.

Similarly, glutamine (D) is a better cofactor, so it's more commonly used when glutamate is not available. So Glutamine is needed.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because I thought that in some stress conditions, proline is not needed. Wait, no, proline is more of a prolyl-binding amino acid. So under stress when the cell cannot activate proline (like when the cell's energy levels are low and cannot activate proline), you have to activate it by making more proline. So even if you can't make as much glutamate, you need to make more proline. So Proline (G) is considered dispensable because it's not always made, but it's required in higher amounts than usual.

Similarly, glutamine (D) is a better substitute for glutamate, so under stress, more glutamine is used. So D is the answer.

But wait, I'm not sure because I might have read that under stress, you might need more amino acids than usual, but the question is about which is dispensable. So if the question is whether it's a good substitute, then in that case, D is the answer.

So, looking back, the options are:

The question asks which is considered dispensable but required in greater amounts than usual.

So which amino acids are not always made, thus considered dispensable, but still required in higher amounts?

Proline (G) is a prolyl-binding amino acid. It's not always made because when the cell can't activate it, you need to make more. So it's considered dispensable.

Glutamine (D) is a better cofactor, so it's also needed more.

But the question is about which is generally considered dispensable. So perhaps both could be correct, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: which amino acids are not required under normal conditions and are used as substitutes under stress.

Glutamine (D) is a good substitute for glutamate. So under stress, when the body can't synthesize glutamate enough, it uses glutamine instead.

Proline (G) is needed during stress when the cell can't activate proline, so it's used as a substitute.

So both are correct, but the question is which is considered dispensable. Wait, the question is which is generally considered dispensable, but in greater amounts than usual.

So, perhaps both are correct, but the question is looking for a specific answer. Let's see the options.

In the options, the answers are:

A: Glutamate (non-amino)
B: Tyrosine (present)
C: Alanine (present)
D: Glutamine (amino)
E: Arginine (present)
F: Glycine (present)
G: Proline (present)
H: Cysteine (present)
I: Aspartate (non-amino)
J: Serine (present)

So the options are asking which amino acid is not always present, hence considered dispensable, but is still needed in higher amounts.

So the correct answers are D and G. But the question is in the options, so only one can be correct.

Wait, the question says "which of the following amino acids generally regarded as being dispensable may be required in greater amount than can readily be synthesised in the body?"

So the correct answer is either D or G.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about previous knowledge. In certain stress conditions, like when glucose is scarce, you might need more amino acids. But under normal conditions, most amino acids are present. Proline is usually a part of the cyclic AMP cycle, so when the cell can't activate proline, you have to make more. So in such cases, you need more proline, making it considered dispensable.

Similarly, glutamine (D) is a more efficient substitute for glutamate, so more glutamine is used under stress.

So both D and G are correct. But the question is in the options, so which one is intended.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which amino acid is considered to be a better substitute under stress conditions. Glutamine is a more efficient cofactor, so it's a better choice. So the answer is D.

Alternatively, Proline is a more fundamental amino acid involved in the cycle, so even if you can't make as much, you need more.

But in the options, both are present. Since the question is singular, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: Glutamine.

Because under stress, the body can't make as much glutamate as needed. So it substitutes with glutamine.

Thus, the correct answer is D: Glutamine.
</think>

Under conditions of metabolic or other stress, certain amino acids are considered dispensable because they are not always synthesized efficiently, yet they are required in greater amounts than can be synthesized under normal conditions. The question asks for the amino acid that is generally regarded as dispensable but still required in higher amounts.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: Glutamate**  
  This is not an amino acid but a cofactor, so it is not relevant to the question.

- **B: Tyrosine**  
  Tyrosine is one of the most abundant amino acids; it is not considered dispensable.

- **C: Alanine**  
  Alanine is always present in sufficient amounts; it is not considered dispensable.

- **D: Glutamine**  
  Glutamine is a nitrogenous base that is a better substitute for glutamate, which is a cofactor in amino acid synthesis. Under stress, the body may not be able to synthesize glutamate efficiently, so glutamine is used instead. This makes glutamine a good candidate for the answer.

- **E: Arginine**  
  Arginine is always present in sufficient amounts; it is not considered dispensable.

- **F: Glycine**  
  Glycine is present in all proteins and is not required in greater amounts than what is naturally present.

- **G: Proline**  
  Proline is part of the cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway and is not always synthesized in sufficient amounts. Under stress, when the cell cannot activate proline, it may resort to producing more proline to meet energy demands. Thus, proline is considered dispensable but required in greater amounts.

- **H: Cysteine**  
  Cysteine is present in sufficient amounts; it is not considered dispensable.

- **I: Aspartate**  
  Aspartate is a cofactor and not an amino acid, so it is not relevant to the question.

- **J: Serine**  
  Serine is present in sufficient amounts; it is not considered dispensable.

### Conclusion:
Both **glutamine (D)** and **proline (G)** are plausible answers. However, **glutamine** is more commonly associated with being a better cofactor and is a direct substitute for glutamate, which is a critical amino acid for amino acid synthesis. Therefore, **glutamine** is the most appropriate answer.
