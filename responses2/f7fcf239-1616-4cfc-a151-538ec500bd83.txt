Okay, so I've got this question here about an electric heater, and I need to find its power rating. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember from school that power in an electrical circuit is calculated using Ohm's Law and the formula P = IV. Oh right, I should use that.

The question says the heater takes 4 amperes from a 120-volt line. Wait, so the current (I) is 4 A and the voltage (V) is 120 V. Oh, right, power is current multiplied by voltage. So P equals I times V.

Let me plug in the numbers. I = 4 A, V = 120 V. So 4 times 120. Hmm, 4 times 100 is 400, and 4 times 20 is 80, so 400 plus 80 is 480. So the power is 480 watts.

Looking at the options, option D is 480 watts. So the answer should be D.

To determine the power rating of the electric heater, use the formula **P = IV**, where **P** is power, **I** is current, and **V** is voltage.

Given:
- **I** = 4 A
- **V** = 120 V

Calculate:
P = I × V = 4 A × 120 V = 480 W

The correct power rating is **480 watts**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
