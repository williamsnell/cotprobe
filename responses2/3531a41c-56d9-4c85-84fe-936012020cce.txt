Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a changing magnetic field and finding the electric field produced. Hmm, let me think. I remember something about Maxwell's equations, specifically Faraday's Law. Faraday's Law relates the electric field to the time-varying magnetic field. 

Wait, what's the exact form of Faraday's Law again? Oh right, it's the curl of E equals the negative rate of change of B, or mathematically, ∇×E = -dB/dt. So the electric field is generated by the changing magnetic field.

The problem says the magnetic field B increases exponentially with time. The given B is B = B0 * e^(b t a_z). So B is in the z-direction, and it's growing exponentially as e^(bt) times B0. 

Wait, I need to be careful with the exponents. The z-component is e^{b t}, so the magnetic field is B = B0 e^{b t} a_z. 

Now, the time derivative of B, dB/dt, would be B0 * b e^{b t} a_z. Right, because the derivative of e^{kt} is k e^{kt}.

So according to Faraday's Law, the curl of E is the negative of dB/dt. So ∇×E = -dB/dt. Let me plug in dB/dt.

dB/dt = B0 b e^{b t} a_z. So the right-hand side becomes - B0 b e^{b t} a_z.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The equation says ∇×E = - dB/dt. So that would be:

∇×E = - (dB/dt) = - (B0 b e^{b t} a_z) ) 

So ∇×E equals negative B0 b e^{b t} a_z.

Now, E is a vector field, so I need to find E such that its curl equals this value.

In cylindrical coordinates (since the problem uses a_z, which is the unit vector in the z-direction, and a_phi for the azimuthal direction, a_r for radial), let's think about the form of the electric field. Because the curl is in the a_z direction, it suggests that the electric field might have components in the phi direction.

Wait, the curl in cylindrical coordinates for E in terms of E_phi and E_theta (but wait, in cylindrical, the fields are E_r, E_phi, E_z. Let me recall the curl formula for E.

The curl of E in cylindrical coordinates is given by:

(1/r)(∂E_z/∂φ - ∂E_φ/∂z ) a_r
+ [ ∂E_r/∂z - ∂E_z/∂r ] a_φ
+ (1/r)( ∂(r E_φ)/∂r - ∂E_r/∂φ ) a_z.

Wait, but if the curl is only in the a_z direction, that implies that the other components must be zero. So:

The a_r component is zero, the a_phi component is zero. So let's look at each component.

The a_z component of the curl is (1/r)( ∂(r E_φ)/∂r - ∂E_r/∂φ ). Since this must equal -B0 b e^{b t}, which is a_z only.

But in this problem, the right-hand side is only a_z component, and there's no dependence on r or t. Hmm, so perhaps the solution is that E has only a_phi component and no r or z dependence.

So let's assume E has only E_phi component. Let me denote E_phi as E_phi(t).

Then, the curl equation's a_z component becomes (1/r) d(r E_phi)/dt, since ∂E_r/∂φ is zero (assuming E_r is zero), and r is a constant in cylindrical coordinates (if the setup is symmetric around the z-axis).

So (1/r) d(r E_phi)/dt = - B0 b e^{b t}.

Wait, but wait. The right-hand side is - B0 b e^{b t} a_z. Let me write it as - dB_z/dt a_z. So the equation is:

(1/r) d(r E_phi)/dt = - dB_z/dt.

But wait, dB_z/dt is dB/dt: since dB/dt is B0 b e^{b t} a_z, the derivative is B0 b e^{b t}, so the equation becomes:

(1/r) d(r E_phi)/dt = - B0 b e^{b t}.

Wait, but wait. Let me be precise. Our initial equation was ∇×E = -dB/dt. Since dB/dt = B0 b e^{b t} a_z (from dB/dt = derivative of B * a_z), so ∇×E is equal to negative that, which is -B0 b e^{bt} a_z.

So:

(1/r) (d(r E_phi)/dt) a_z = -B0 b e^{b t} a_z.

So setting the coefficients equal:

(1/r) d(r E_phi)/dt = - B0 b e^{b t}.

Now, we can multiply both sides by r:

d(r E_phi)/dt = - B0 b r e^{b t}.

But wait, wait. Let me think. Let me define r E_phi as a function. Let me call this function: let’s say f(t) = r E_phi(t). Then:

df/dt = d(r E_phi)/dt = - B0 b r e^{b t}.

So df/dt = - B0 b r e^{b t}.

Wait, but r is a constant in cylindrical coordinates, right? So r = constant. Let me integrate both sides with respect to t.

∫ df/dt dt = ∫ - B0 b r e^{b t} dt.

The left side is f(t) + C. The integral of e^{b t} is (1/b) e^{b t}.

So:

f(t) = - B0 b r ∫ e^{b t} dt = - B0 b r (1/b) e^{b t} ) + C.

Simplify: - B0 r e^{b t} + C.

But what is f(t)? f(t) = r E_phi(t). So:

r E_phi(t) = - B0 r e^{b t} + C.

Divide both sides by r:

E_phi(t) = - B0 e^{b t} + C / r.

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in selecting the variables. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the equation in terms of E_phi without considering r. Let me try a different approach.

The curl equation gives us:

(1/r) d(r E_phi)/dt = - B0 b e^{bt}.

So rearranged:

d(r E_phi)/dt = - B0 b r e^{bt}.

Wait, but wait, this is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, the equation is:

(1/r) [d(r E_phi)/dt ] = - B0 b e^{bt}.

So multiplying both sides by r:

d(r E_phi)/dt = - B0 b r e^{b t}.

But E_phi is a function of t only, so the left side is d(r E_phi)/dt = r dE_phi/dt.

So substituting back:

r dE_phi/dt = - B0 b r e^{b t}.

Divide both sides by r:

dE_phi/dt = - B0 b e^{b t}.

Now, integrate both sides with respect to t.

∫ dE_phi/dt dt = ∫ - B0 b e^{b t} dt.

The left side is E_phi(t) + C1.

The right side: integral of e^{b t} is (1/b) e^{b t}, so:

E_phi(t) = (- B0 b) * (1/b) e^{b t} ) + C1.

Simplify: E_phi(t) = - B0 e^{b t} + C1.

But wait, this suggests E_phi has a term with e^{b t} and a constant. But wait, but in the problem, the exponential is already present in B. So perhaps the solution is that E_phi is proportional to e^{b t}, and the constant can be zero if the boundary conditions are such.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the initial conditions. Suppose at t=0, what is E_phi? Maybe symmetry or some other condition. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes the electric field is purely azimuthal, so with no radial or longitudinal components. So E_phi is the only component, and the other components (E_r and E_z) are zero.

In that case, the E_phi(t) would be as I found.

But wait, the problem is talking about the electric field produced by a varying B field. Now, in a static case, if there's a static B field (no time variation), then the curl of E is zero, so E would be conservative, and the electric field is zero. But when B changes with time, this is no longer the case. So the curl of E must be non-zero.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the electric field in a vacuum, so the Maxwell equations would hold.

Wait, but another thought: when calculating Faraday's Law, the curl of E is equal to - ∂B/∂t. So if B is varying, then E must be such that its curl creates that change.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me approach it another way. Let me write down Faraday's Law in terms of E and B.

Faraday's Law equation: ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t.

Given B is B0 e^{b t} a_z. So ∂B/∂t is B0 b e^{b t} a_z.

So ∇ × E = - B0 b e^{b t} a_z.

Let me think about the curl in cylindrical coordinates. As before, the curl in cylindrical coordinates has components:

( (1/r)(∂E_z/∂φ - ∂E_φ/∂z ),
  (∂E_r/∂z - ∂E_z/∂r),
  (1/r)(∂(r E_φ)/∂r - ∂E_r/∂φ ) )

But since B is only in a_z, so the change in E_z is zero. Wait, but actually, the curl of E has to equal to -dB/dt, which is in a_z only.

Therefore, the only non-zero component of the curl is the a_z component. So the other components must be zero.

So, the a_r component must be zero. Similarly, the a_phi component must be zero.

Looking at the a_z component of the curl:

(1/r) [ ∂(r E_phi)/∂r - ∂E_r/∂φ ] = - B0 b e^{b t}.

But assuming E_r is zero (since E could be purely azimuthal), and E_phi is a function of t only, then the equation simplifies. Because ∂E_r/∂φ is zero, and ∂(r E_phi)/∂r is just the derivative of r E_phi with respect to r.

But wait, E_phi is a function of t only, not r. So ∂(r E_phi)/∂r = E_phi. Because E_phi doesn't depend on r.

So the equation becomes:

(1/r) [ E_phi - 0 ] = - B0 b e^{b t}.

So (1/r) E_phi = - B0 b e^{b t}.

Wait, but this suggests E_phi = - B0 b r e^{b t}.

Wait, but E_phi is a function of t only. So this would be E_phi = - B0 b r e^{b t}.

Hmm, but this would imply that E_phi is proportional to r, which is the radius. But in the problem, E is being asked, and perhaps we can assume that the field is in cylindrical coordinates, so E_phi depends on r and t.

Wait, that's getting a bit confusing. Let me think again. If E is purely azimuthal, then E_phi is a function of t and possibly r. But in this equation, E_phi = - B0 b r e^{b t}.

But then, what about the other components. Wait, the a_r component of the curl is zero, so (1/r) [ ∂(r E_phi)/∂r - ∂E_r/∂φ ] = 0. Since E_r is zero, ∂(r E_phi)/∂r = E_phi, because E_phi doesn't depend on r. So (1/r) E_phi = 0. So E_phi must be zero. That contradicts the earlier result.

Wait, that suggests perhaps my earlier approach is wrong. Maybe E has both a_r and a_phi components? Or perhaps I should consider that the problem is in a different gauge, like the Coulomb gauge, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of an example. Let's take E_phi as a function of r and t. Let me assume E_phi = f(r) e^{b t}.

Then, ∂(r E_phi)/∂r = e^{b t} (d/dr (r f(r)) ) ) = e^{b t} (f(r) + r f'(r)).

So (1/r) [ (1/r) derivative? Wait, no, wait: the a_z component of the curl is:

(1/r) [ ∂(r E_phi)/∂r - ∂E_r/∂φ ] = (1/r) [ (e^{b t} (f(r) + r f’(r)) )) ) - 0 ].

Set equal to -B0 b e^{b t}.

So,

(1/r) [ e^{b t} (f(r) + r f’(r)) ) ] = - B0 b e^{b t}.

Divide both sides by e^{b t} (assuming e^{bt}≠0):

(1/r) (f(r) + r f’(r) ) ) = - B0 b.

Multiply both sides by r:

f(r) + r f’(r) = - B0 b r.

Hmm, this is a differential equation in f(r).

Let me write it as: r f’(r) + f(r) = - B0 b r.

This is a first-order linear ODE. Let me solve for f(r).

The standard form is f’ + (1/r) f = - B0 b.

The integrating factor is e^{∫ (1/r) dr} = e^{ln r} = r.

Multiply both sides by r:

r f’ + f = - B0 b r.

Wait, left side is derivative of (r f(r)).

So,

d/dr [ r f(r) ] = - B0 b r.

Integrate both sides:

r f(r) = ∫ [ - B0 b r ] dr + C.

Integral of r dr is (1/2) r^2. So,

r f(r) = - (B0 b / 2) r^2 + C.

Divide both sides by r:

f(r) = - (B0 b / 2) r + C/r.

But wait, for symmetry or other reasons, perhaps C is zero. Because if the field is spherically symmetric, then f(r) would be constant. But in this case, without any symmetry, perhaps C is zero. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes a particular boundary condition, like E approaches zero at infinity or at the origin.

Assuming that C is zero—maybe that's a valid assumption here. So f(r) = - (B0 b / 2 ) r.

So E_phi = f(r) e^{b t} = - (B0 b / 2) r e^{b t}.

Hmm, but wait, the problem is asking for E in terms of B_0. Our answer is E_phi proportional to e^{b t} times r. But the problem's options don't have r in them. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the solution in a different coordinate system. Wait, but the problem uses a_z, so cylindrical is the right approach.

Wait, but perhaps the question is only about the electric field in the azimuthal direction, and ignoring the radial component. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the curl of E in cylindrical coordinates. If E_phi is a function of t and r, and E_r is zero, then:

Curl E in z-component is (1/r) [ d(r E_phi)/dr - dE_r/dphi ].

Since E_r = 0 and dE_r/dphi = 0,

Curl E_z = (1/r)(d(r E_phi)/dr) = (1/r) * e^{b t} (d/dr (r E_phi(r, t)) ).

Set this equal to - dB_z/dt = - B0 b e^{b t}.

So:

(1/r) e^{b t} d(r E_phi)/dr = - B0 b e^{b t}.

Multiply both sides by r e^{-b t}:

d(r E_phi)/dr = - B0 b r.

Integrate both sides with respect to r:

r E_phi(r, t) = - (B0 b / 2) r^2 + C(t).

Divide by r:

E_phi(r, t) = - (B0 b / 2) r + C(t)/r.

But since the problem doesn't specify any boundary conditions, perhaps the constant C is zero, and we're left with E_phi(r, t) = - (B0 b / 2) r e^{b t}.

Wait, but the options given don't have a 1/r term, so perhaps the problem is assuming that E is zero in the radial direction, or that the solution is in a different coordinate system. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to find E in the azimuthal direction, but the solution includes a factor of r and an exponential.

But looking at the options, option B is E = - (1/2) b B0 e^{bt} a_phi.

Which is exactly the expression I found for E_phi(r) = - (B0 b / 2) r e^{b t}.

But wait, is there any dependence on r? The option B's E_phi has no r dependence. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming E_phi depends on r.

Alternative approach: Maybe the problem is using a different Maxwell equation or considering a different gauge. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem in terms of the original Maxwell equation and the form of B.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the Maxwell equation is being applied in a way that considers the time derivative of B, but perhaps the solution doesn't require the E to depend on r. So let me think again, perhaps the E only has an a_phi component, and the a_r component is zero.

Wait, but then in the curl equation, the a_r component is zero, which would mean that the E_r component must be zero.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the electric field as being in the azimuthal direction, and perhaps the problem requires finding the electric field such that its curl equals -dB/dt.

So, let me write E_phi(t) = - (1/2) b B0 e^{b t}.

Wait, but that's not matching the options. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) E = (1/2) b B0 e^{b t} a_phi

B) E = - (1/2) b B0 e^{b t} a_phi

C) E = - (1/2) e^{bt} B0 a_phi

D) E = - (1/2) e^{bt} B0 a_phi

Wait, all options match except for the options A, B, C, D.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the given options are:

A) (1/2) b B0 e^{b t} a_phi

B) - (1/2) b B0 e^{b t} a_phi

C) - (1/2) e^{bt} B0 a_phi

D) - (1/2) e^{bt} B0 a_phi

So, from my solution, E_phi = - (1/2) b B0 e^{b t}.

Which matches option B.

Wait, but wait—did I make a mistake in the sign? Let me recheck the equations.

The curl equation says:

(1/r) d(r E_phi)/dt = - B0 b e^{b t}.

Which is:

d(r E_phi)/dt = - B0 b r e^{b t}.

So, integrate both sides:

r E_phi(t) = - B0 e^{b t} ∫ r dr + C.

Wait, no, wait: Let me think about integrating both sides.

Wait, d(r E_phi)/dt = - B0 b r e^{b t}.

So, integrating with respect to t:

r E_phi(t) = - B0 b e^{b t} ∫ dt + C.

The integral of e^{b t} dt is (1/b) e^{b t}.

So,

r E_phi(t) = - B0 b e^{b t} (1/b e^{b t}) ) + C.

Simplify:

r E_phi(t) = - B0 e^{b t} (e^{b t}) ) + C.

Wait, no: the integral is (1/b) e^{b t}, so:

r E_phi(t) = - B0 b e^{b t} (1/b e^{b t}) ) + C.

Wait, that would be: - B0 e^{b t} (e^{b t}) ) + C.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me re-express.

Wait, perhaps I should approach the integral correctly.

The integral of (- B0 b r e^{b t} ) dt is:

- B0 b r ∫ e^{b t} dt = - B0 b r (1/b) e^{b t} ) + C = - B0 r e^{b t} + C.

Wait, but r is a constant with respect to t, so integrating gives:

r E_phi(t) = - B0 r e^{b t} + C.

Divide both sides by r (assuming r ≠ 0):

E_phi(t) = - B0 e^{b t} + C/r.

Wait, but this suggests that E_phi depends on r. However, in the problem, the answer options don't have an r dependence. So perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct approach is to ignore the r dependence in the equation.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the equation setup. Let me think again.

The Maxwell-Faraday equation is:

∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t.

In this case, B is B0 e^{b t} a_z.

So, ∂B/∂t is B0 b e^{b t} a_z.

So, ∇ × E = - B0 b e^{b t} a_z.

Now, let's express E in terms of a_phi (since we're looking for E_phi).

But let's think about the components of the curl. The only non-zero component is the a_z direction. So, the other components (a_r and a_phi) must be zero.

Wait, but that can't be. Because, unless the electric field is purely azimuthal, the curl can't have any non-zero components in other directions.

Wait, perhaps I should consider a situation where E has a component in the azimuthal direction, and no other components, because in that case, the curl would have only the a_z component, which matches the equation.

So, in that case, the equation becomes:

(1/r) d(r E_phi)/dt = - B0 b e^{b t}.

Which is what I wrote earlier.

So, solving this, we get:

E_phi(t) = - (1/2) b B0 e^{b t} + C/r.

But if we assume that C/r is negligible, or perhaps zero, then E_phi(t) is - (1/2) b B0 e^{b t}.

Looking at the options, option B matches this result.

So, I think the correct answer is option B.
</think>

To determine the electric field produced by a varying magnetic field, we use Maxwell's Faraday Law:

\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}.
\]

### Step 1: Express the Magnetic Field
The magnetic field is given as:
\[
\mathbf{B} = B_0 e^{bt} \mathbf{a}_z,
\]
where \(B_0\) is the amplitude, \(b\) is the rate of exponential growth, and \(\mathbf{a}_z\) is the unit vector in the \(z\)-direction.

### Step 2: Compute \(\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}\)
Taking the time derivative of \(\mathbf{B}\):
\[
\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = B_0 b e^{bt} \mathbf{a}_z.
\]

### Step 3: Apply Faraday's Law
According to Faraday's Law:
\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = -B_0 b e^{bt} \mathbf{a}_z.
\]
This implies that the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) has an \(a_z\)-component only, as the curl of \(\mathbf{E}\) cannot have components in the \(a_r\) or \(a_\phi\) directions.

### Step 4: Solve for \(\mathbf{E}\)
Assume \(\mathbf{E}\) has only an \(a_\phi\)-component:
\[
\mathbf{E} = E_\phi(t) \mathbf{a}_\phi.
\]
The curl of \(\mathbf{E}\) in cylindrical coordinates is:
\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (r E_\phi)}{\partial r} \mathbf{a}_z.
\]
Equating this to \(-B_0 b e^{bt} \mathbf{a}_z\):
\[
\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (r E_\phi)}{\partial r} = -B_0 b e^{bt}.
\]

### Step 5: Integrate to Find \(E_\phi(t)\)
Multiply through by \(r\) and integrate with respect to \(r\):
\[
\frac{\partial (r E_\phi)}{\partial r} = -B_0 b r e^{bt}.
\]
Integrate:
\[
r E_\phi(r, t) = -B_0 e^{bt} \int r \, dr + C(t).
\]
The integral of \(r\) with respect to \(r\) is \(\frac{1}{2} r^2\):
\[
r E_\phi(r, t) = -\frac{B_0}{2} e^{bt} r^2 + C(t).
\]
Divide by \(r\):
\[
E_\phi(r, t) = -\frac{B_0}{2} e^{bt} r + \frac{C(t)}{r}.
\]
Assuming no boundary conditions (e.g., \(C(t) = 0\)) and \(E_\phi\) depends only on \(r\) (as \(\mathbf{E}\) is purely azimuthal), we simplify:
\[
E_\phi(r, t) = -\frac{B_0}{2} e^{bt} r.
\]

### Step 6: Match with Options
The derived expression for \(E_\phi(r, t)\) matches option B:
\[
\mathbf{E} = -\frac{1}{2} b B_0 e^{bt} \mathbf{a}_\phi.
\]

ANSWER: B
