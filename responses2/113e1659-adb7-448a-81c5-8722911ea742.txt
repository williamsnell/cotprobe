Question:

A dance student worked very hard to strengthen her legs, including performing additional activities such as leaping and bounding up multiple flights of stairs in her apartment building. While she was performing her exercises, one of the janitors in the building warned her that "she was bound to get hurt if she keeps it up, because there are problems with the floor." After falling and breaking a leg due to a loose floorboard, she brought suit against the building owner. The building owner wants to testify that: "The janitor told me 'I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.' ". Is the building owner's statement likely to be held admissible?

Options:

A: No, because it is hearsay, the janitor's statement is not a public record.
B: Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a recorded recollection.
C: Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a statement made for medical diagnosis or treatment.
D: Yes, because it is as an exception to hearsay as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party.
E: No, because it is hearsay and the building owner is not a credible source.
F: Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a statement of then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition.
G: No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.
H: Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.
I: No, because it is irrelevant and immaterial.
J: No, because it is hearsay and there are no exceptions that would allow for the janitor's statement to be admissible.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about whether a statement from a janitor can be admissible as evidence. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario is a dance student who fell due to a loose floorboard. The janitor told her that running too fast is dangerous and that she was bound to get hurt. The building owner is now suing, and the question is whether the janitor's statement can be admitted as evidence.

First, I need to remember the rules of evidence regarding admissibility of statements. Admissibility typically depends on whether the statement is hearsay and whether it meets the requirements for being admissible as hearsay, or if it falls into an exception category.

Hearsay is any statement made by a third party that is admissible only if it meets certain criteria. The main exceptions are:

1. Statement made for the benefit of another person (like a medical diagnosis or treatment).
2. Statement made out of personal knowledge (as a recollection of another person's statement).
3. Statement made out of the knowledge of a law enforcement officer (e.g., a police report).
4. Exculpatory statement, which excludes the declarant from liability.

The building owner is the person making the statement. So, are the janitor's words considered hearsay? Well, the building owner is the one who told the statement, so the statement is likely hearsay unless it's an exception.

Looking at the statement: "I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt." That's a statement made by the janitor. It's about the janitor's opinion. So, is it an exception?

Option B says it's an exception because it's a recorded recollection. Oh wait, a recorded recollection is when someone talks about past experiences, and it's not hearsay unless it's specifically an exception. But is the statement about the janitor's opinion, not about something that happened in the past?

Wait, no. The statement is the janitor's word about her own behavior. So it's a statement made by the janitor to a specific person (the dance student). But whether it's hearsay is about whether the statement meets the hearsay criteria, not whether it's an exception.

Wait, the issue is whether the statement can be used as evidence. So the building owner is the person making it, so the statement is hearsay unless it's an exception.

Option B says it's an exception as a recorded recollection. But a recorded recollection requires that the speaker's knowledge was complete and the statement was made for the benefit of another. In this case, the janitor is making the statement about her own behavior, not about someone else's.

So the statement is a hearsay statement, not an exception. So the building owner's statement would likely be hearsay and not admissible.

Looking at the options, option J says it's hearsay, so no. Option E says it's hearsay and the owner isn't credible. But the question is whether the statement is admissible, not whether it's credible. The credibility issue is more about whether the statement is made by a credible source.

Wait, but the building owner is the one making the statement, not the student. The student is the one who fell. The statement is about the janitor's words, not about the student's actions. So the building owner is the one making the statement, so the statement is hearsay. Unless it's an exception.

So the building owner's statement is hearsay. Thus, it's not admissible as a hearsay exception. So any option that says it's not hearsay would block it. Looking at the options, options A, B, G, H, J: options that say it's not hearsay (like A, B, C, D, J) would block it.

Option B: exception as a recorded recollection. But the statement is about the janitor's words, not about a previous event. So not an exception.

Option J: no, because it's hearsay. But the question is whether it's admissible, not whether it's credible. So even if it's hearsay, if it's not an exception, it's not admissible.

So the building owner's statement is hearsay. Thus, the answer is J: No, because it's hearsay and there are no exceptions that allow it to be admissible.

Wait, but let me think again. The building owner is the one who made the statement. So the statement is hearsay unless it's an exception. So unless the statement is an exception, like statement made out of the knowledge of a law enforcement officer, it's not admissible.

In this case, the building owner is the one who told the janitor. If the building owner is making the statement, and the janitor's statement is about their behavior, that's a statement about the janitor, not about the student. So the building owner's statement is not hearsay, because it's about their own words. Wait, no, the statement is about the janitor's words, not about the student's actions. So the building owner is making a statement about the janitor's words, which is hearsay.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify: when a person makes a statement, it's hearsay unless it's an exception. The exception is if the statement is a statement made for the benefit of another person.

So if the building owner told the janitor, that's a statement made for the benefit of the janitor. So that statement is hearsay, unless it's an exception.

So the building owner's statement is hearsay unless it's an exception. So which exception applies? The statement is about the janitor's words, not about a previous event. So unless the building owner's statement was made out of the knowledge of a law enforcement officer, it's not an exception.

So the building owner's statement is not an exception, and thus is hearsay. Therefore, it's not admissible.

So the correct answer would be option J: No, because it's hearsay and no exceptions apply.
</think>

The building owner's statement is a statement made by the janitor to the dance student, not to a third party. It is hearsay unless it meets one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. The statement is not an exception because it pertains to the janitor's words, not to a past event or a statement made by a law enforcement officer. Therefore, the building owner's statement is hearsay and not admissible under the hearsay rule.

Answer: J
