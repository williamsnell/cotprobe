Okay, so I'm trying to solve this accounting problem about dividends for preferred and common stock. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says thatrees Corporation is going to pay a total dividend of $50,000 for the year. There are two classes of stock: preferred and common. There are 1,000 shares of preferred stock, each with a 6% dividend rate and a par value of $50. There are also 5,000 shares of common stock outstanding.

Wait, I remember that preferred stock typically has higher dividend priority than common stock. So, the preferred stock's dividends should be calculated first. Then any remaining money after that goes to the common stock.

So, first, let's find the annual dividend for the preferred stock. The preferred has 1,000 shares, each with a 6% dividend rate on a $50 par value. The dividend per share would be 6% of $50. Let me compute that: 6% of 50 is (0.06 * 50) = $3 per share. Then, for 1,000 shares, it's 1,000 * $3 = $3,000 total preferred dividend.

Now, the total dividend to pay is $50,000. So after paying the preferred, the remaining amount is $50,000 - $3,000 = $47,000. This amount should go to the common stock.

There are 5,000 common shares, so each common share would get $47,000 divided by 5,000. Let me calculate that: 47,000 / 5,000 = 9.4. So each common share gets $9.40.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any that match exactly. Let me check the options again.

The options are A to J. Let's see the options.

Option I: $2.50 preferred, $9.70 common. Hmm, that doesn't match what I calculated. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait no, wait—no, I think I did it right. Preferred is $3,000. Common is $47k / 5k = 9.40. So preferred per share is 3000 / 1000 = $3. So the correct preferred per share is $3, and common is $9.40.

But looking at the options, option I says preferred is $2.50 and common is $9.70. Option J is $3 and $9.40.

Wait, so my calculation for preferred is $3, which is option J. So the common is $9.40, which matches option J. But wait, let me check what the options say.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option J: $3 for preferred, $9.40 for common.

Option I: $2.50 preferred, $9.70 common.

So according to my calculation, the correct answer should be option J.

Wait, but wait. Option J's common is $9.40, which is correct.

Wait, but in the options, each option lists two numbers, like A says preferred is 4, common is 10, etc. So option J's preferred is 3, common is 9.40.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating.

Wait, let's recalculate.

Preferred stock: 1,000 shares, 6% of $50 = $3 per share. So 1,000 * 3 = $3,000. Correct.

Total dividend is $50,000, so the remaining is $50k - $3k = $47k for common.

Common is 5,000 shares: $47,000 /5,000 = $9.40 per share. So yes, common is $9.40.

Looking back at the options, option J is $3 preferred, $9.40 for common. So that's the correct option.

Wait, but the options list each option as two numbers, so option J is correct.

Wait, but why is option I there? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe the preferred stock has a higher dividend rate but it's not just 6% on par value. Wait, no—6% of $50 is $3 per share. Yes.

Alternatively, perhaps the preferred stock has a 6% dividend rate on a different basis, but no, the question says 6% on $50 par. So that's correct.

Wait, but another thought: is the preferred stock's dividend a fixed amount per share, or is it a percentage of the total par value? Let me make sure. The question says 6% of $50. So 6% * 50 = $3 per share. So that's correct.

So the preferred is $3 per share, common is $9.40. So among the options, option J is that. So the correct answer should be option J.

To determine the dividends per share for each class of stock, we first calculate the preferred stock dividend and then allocate the remaining amount to the common stock.

1. **Preferred Stock Dividend:**
   - Number of preferred shares: 1,000
   - Dividend rate: 6%
   - Par value per share: $50
   - Dividend per share for preferred stock = 6% of $50 = $3 per share.
   - Total preferred dividend = 1,000 shares * $3 = $3,000.

2. **Common Stock Dividend:**
   - Total dividend to be paid: $50,000
   - Dividend allocated to preferred stock: $3,000
   - Remaining amount for common stock: $50,000 - $3,000 = $47,000.
   - Number of common shares: 5,000
   - Dividend per common share = $47,000 / 5,000 = $9.40.

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option J:** $3 for preferred stock, $9.40 for common stock. This matches our calculations.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option J**.
