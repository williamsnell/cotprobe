Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Is it not unity alone that can weld us into an effective force, capable of creating our own progress and making our valuable contribution to world peace? Which independent African state will claim that its financial structure and banking institutions are fully harnessed to its national development? Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations? We are fast learning that political independence is not enough to rid us of the consequences of colonial rule. We have been too busy nursing our separate states to understand fully the basic need for union, rooted in common purpose, common planning and common endeavour.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a historical passage and some factors that prevented certain political dreams from being fulfilled. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

The question is about Ghana's president, Kwame Nkrumah, speaking at the Organization of African Unity in 1963. The passage talks about the challenges of political independence and the need for cooperation. The key point seems to be about the political and economic aspects preventing the union.

So, the question is asking which factor was most important in preventing the fulfillment of Ghana's political dreams. The options are A to D.

I remember that Ghana had a unique history, being part of the British Empire. So their political system was heavily influenced by colonialism. The passage mentions that political independence isn't enough because the basic need for union isn't met. Common planning and common efforts are still needed, which suggests that Ghana might have been trying to rely on their own unity.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion. I'm not sure. I know that some African states have had issues with ethnic vs. nationalism, but I don't think that was the main issue preventing Ghana's dreams. The passage talked about the need for common planning and effort, so maybe this is not the main factor.

Option B: The spread of communism throughout the continent. That sounds like a positive thing. If the country had access to communism, it could have merged more easily. But the passage says political independence is not enough, implying that their system is more based on British colonialism rather than communism. So maybe this isn't the factor that prevented their dreams.

Option C: Armed intervention by Cold War superpowers. The passage mentions that political independence is not enough because the basic need for union is still there. However, Ghana's situation was more about internal colonialism. The passage also talks about the need for union, so maybe the superpowers' intervention was part of the problem, but I'm not sure if it was the main issue.

Option D: Africa's shortage of natural resources. Well, Ghana was dependent on natural resources like coal, which were heavily invested in the 1960s and 1970s. If they had more resources, they might have had more to work with. But the passage seems to focus more on the need for cooperation rather than the availability of natural resources. Wait, but if they had fewer resources, maybe that hindered their development. So maybe the shortfalls of resources were preventing the unity. Or perhaps the passage is suggesting that other factors were more crucial than resource scarcity.

Wait, the passage mentions Ghana trying to harness political, economic, and social systems for its development. If their resources were scarce, it might have limited their ability to achieve unity. So perhaps the country's inability to develop its resources, or the lack of resources, was a hindrance. But I'm not sure if it was the main issue.

Alternatively, looking again, the passage talks about the necessity of union and planning. So Ghana might have been trying to merge with other African states, but if their resources weren't sufficient, that might have prevented their efforts. Or maybe the lack of resources meant they couldn't sustain their efforts, leading to failure in merging.

Wait, perhaps the key point is the need for common planning and effort. Without sufficient resources, it's harder to coordinate and plan effectively. So the lack of resources (option D) would have hindered their ability to achieve unity and development.

Alternatively, the spread of communism (option B) would have been more beneficial, so it's not the one preventing their dreams.

Armed intervention (option C) was part of the colonial story, but the passage mentions that political independence isn't enough, implying that the superpowers' intervention was a factor, but maybe not the main issue in preventing the union.

So putting it all together, the most important factor preventing the fulfillment of Ghana's dreams would have been the lack of resources (D), which would have hindered their unity efforts.
</think>

The passage discusses Ghana's political and economic struggles under colonial rule, emphasizing the need for unity and cooperation. The question asks which factor was most important in preventing the fulfillment of Ghana's politicaldreams. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A:** Lack of ethnic, linguistic, or religious diversity seems less relevant to Ghana's struggle for unity.
- **Option B:** The spread of communism would have facilitated unity, making this option unlikely to be the factor preventing it.
- **Option C:** Armed intervention by superpowers was part of the colonial context but not the main issue preventing Ghana's unity.
- **Option D:** Africa's shortage of natural resources hindered Ghana's ability to develop and coordinate effectively, which was crucial for achieving unity.

Thus, the most important factor was the lack of resources, as it prevented Ghana from achieving unity and development.

**Answer: D**
