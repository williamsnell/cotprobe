Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Addison's Act had been conceived in the belief that, unless working-class aspirations were quickly met after the war, Britain might experience a revolution similar to that in Russia. By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, "having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.

Okay, so I have to answer this multiple-choice question about the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme and related events. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The question is about describing the changes made to the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme in 1920 and 1921. The options are A to J, each describing a different scenario.

The scenario given is that in 1920, the scheme was approved, but in 1921, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme. The Housing Board's decision was based on the Council's commitments and available funds, and it cut the housing target by half. The mention is that the scheme was approved in September 1920, but the Government's Housing Board deferred it in May 1921.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Housing was a large part of the British budget. Well, the question doesn't mention what part of the budget housing was, but it's possible. However, the options are more about the specific changes or reasons behind the deferment.

Option B: The government Housing Board was indifferent towards the housing program. This doesn't seem right because the Housing Board did defer, so they were not indifferent.

Option C: The scheme was approved without issues. But the question says it was approved in September 1920, so deferment happened, so C is incorrect.

Option D: The Housing Board wanted to build more houses. Hmm, the Housing Board cut the target by half. So they were not building more, but perhaps they wanted to reduce, not increase. So D might not be correct.

Option E: The Housing Board announced an increase in the housing program. No, the problem states they cut it, so E is wrong.

Option F: The government planned to increase instead of cut. The question says they cut, so F is incorrect.

Option G: The Council was expecting the deferment. But the question says the scheme was approved in 1920, then the Housing Board deferred in 1921. So the deferment happened, not the expectation. So the correct option would be that the council was expecting the deferment, but the correct answer is about the action taken, which was the deferment. So looking back, the options are about what the government did, not what the council expected.

Wait, the question is asking which best describes the plans being changed. So the plans are the Kingfield Street scheme's changes. The fact that the Housing Board deferred, the target was cut, etc.

Looking at the options again, the question is about what the plans were changed into. Or perhaps what the housing board's action was. So option F says the government planned to increase the target. But the actual action was to cut it. So the correct answer is F.

Alternatively, another angle: The question is about the plans being changed, which would be the scheme's changes. The scheme was approved in 1920, then the Housing Board cut the target in 1921. So the action taken was a reduction. The options don't directly mention that, but the options are about what the Housing Board was doing. 

Looking at the options again, option F says the government planned to increase the housing target instead of cutting. But the actual action was to cut, so F is incorrect. So the correct answer is F, because the Housing Board cut it, not increase it.

Looking at the other options, option G says the council expected deferment. But the scheme was approved in 1920, so the deferment was probably not expected. So G is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be F: The government planned to increase the housing target instead of cutting it.
</think>

The correct answer is F: "The government was planning to increase the housing target instead of cutting it." 

**Explanation:**
The question describes the deferment of the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme in 1921, where the Housing Board cut the housing target by half. This indicates that the government planned to increase the housing target, contrary to the actual action taken. Therefore, option F best captures the situation.
