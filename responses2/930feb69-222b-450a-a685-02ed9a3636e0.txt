Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Oral Torah. I remember the question is asking what the Oral Torah is known as. The options are A through J, with each option being a different religious text. 

First, I need to recall what the Oral Torah is. I think the Oral Torah refers to the written form of the Torah that's been passed down through the generations. But wait, the question is about its written form. So, I'm a bit confused because I remember the Torah itself is referred to as the written form, but the question is specifically about the Oral part.

I think the Oral Torah is the written form, so it's one of the traditional religious texts. Now, looking at the options:

A: Mishnah - That's the oral part of the Torah, not the written. So probably not this.

B: Tanakh - I believe Tanakh is the written part of the Torah, so this might be the answer.

C: Talmud - No, that's a collection of writings, not the written part of the Torah.

D: Pentateuch - That's a collection of the five books of the Torah, but again, the written part is Tanakh.

E: Gemara - Gemara is about Jewish law and thought, not the written Torah.

F: Zohar - Zohar is part of the Talmud, dealing with teachings.

G: Ketuvim - I think Ketuvim is another term for the Talmud.

H: Midrash - Midrash is related to certain aspects of the Talmud, like the Shulchan Aruch.

I: Torah Shebichtav - I'm not sure about this one. Shebichtav refers to the Talmud, but I think she's a specific section or a text within it.

J: Nevi'im - Nevi'im is a term for the Torah, but I'm not certain about its exact meaning or if it refers to the written part.

Wait, the question is about the written form. So the written form of the Torah is called Tanakh. So option B should be the correct answer. The Oral Torah is the verbal part, but the written form is Tanakh. So the answer is B.

The correct answer is **B: Tanakh**, as it represents the written form of the Torah. 

Answer: B
