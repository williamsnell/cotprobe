Okay, I need to figure out how many students on the dance team take tap lessons. The question says there are 72 students in total and 4 over 9 of them take tap lessons. Wait, I think I might have misread that. Let me check again. Oh, no, waitâ€”the question says "4 over 9 take tap lessons," but that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's 4 out of 9 students? Because 4/9 can't be more than 1, but 72 students would make 4/9 of them a certain number. 

So, let's break it down. If there are 72 students and 4/9 of them take tap lessons, I need to calculate 4/9 of 72. To do that, I can multiply 72 by 4 and then divide by 9. Let's see: 72 times 4 is 288, and then 288 divided by 9 is... let me think. 9 times 32 is 288, so 288 divided by 9 is 32. So, 32 students take tap lessons.

Looking at the options, option A is 32. So the answer should be A.
