Question:

Chromosomal sex in mammals has been shown to be strongly Y chromosome determined. How was this shown to be true?

Options:

A: The absence of a Y chromosome determines maleness in mammals
B: The presence of a Y chromosome usually determines maleness in mammals
C: The ratio of two X chromosomes to one Y chromosome determines maleness
D: The presence of an X chromosome determines maleness in mammals
E: The presence of an X chromosome in the absence of a Y chromosome determines maleness
F: The presence of a Y chromosome determines femaleness in mammals
G: The presence of a Y chromosome has no impact on the determination of maleness
H: The presence of multiple X chromosomes without a Y chromosome determines maleness
I: The presence of two or more Y chromosomes is required for maleness
J: The presence of an X chromosome determines femaleness in mammals

Okay, so I've got this question about mammalian sex determination and how it's determined. The question is asking which option correctly explains how the sex of mammals is determined, primarily by the Y chromosome. I remember from biology that the Y chromosome is involved in determining sex, especially in mammals. 

Let me think about what I know. In mammals, the sex determination system is based on the presence of the Y or X chromosome. If a female has an X, she's female, and a Y makes her male. But wait, isn't females usually XX? So the Y is a key part in making them male. 

Looking at the options, the question is about how this was shown. I think it's something about the presence of a Y chromosome leading to male expression. Let me go through the options.

Option B says the presence of a Y chromosome determines maleness. So maleness would be male. That makes sense because without a Y, you have an X, making you female. But is B a correct statement about how it's shown?

Wait, another thought. I remember that the Y chromosome is responsible for determining the sex. So the presence of a Y leads to males. But the question is about how this was shown. I think the concept was that the Y is necessary for males because males don't have a Y. So the presence of a Y is the reason they're male. 

But which option reflects that? Let's see. Option B says presence of Y determines maleness. But maleness is male. So if someone says the Y makes you male (which is maleness), that would fit. But wait, the question is about how it was shown. The actual proof is that females have two X's, so without a Y, they're female. 

So the correct answer should be that the presence of a Y chromosome determines male or female. Wait, the question says "how was shown to be true." So the statement that Y determines maleness (male) is correct, because they are male without Y. 

Looking at the options, option B says the presence of Y determines maleness. So that would be correct. Let's check the others. 

Option F says the presence of Y determines femaleness. That's opposite of what happens. So F is incorrect. 

Option J says presence of X determines femaleness. That's also incorrect because females are XX, so X would be female. 

Option A says absence of Y determines maleness. That doesn't make sense. Without Y, you have X, which is female. So A is incorrect. 

Option C talks about X:X:Y ratio. That's more about gene expression, but the actual determination is the presence of Y, not the ratio. 

Option D: presence of X determines maleness. That's wrong because females are XX. 

Option E says presence of X in absence of Y determines femaleness. Again, females have XX, so presence of X would be female without Y. So E is incorrect. 

Option G: presence of multiple X's without Y determines maleness. That's correct from gene expression, but the actual determination of sex is the presence of Y, not the number of X's. 

Option I: two or more Y's are needed for maleness. No, that's not right. Two Y's would make a female. 

Option H: presence of two Y's is required. No, two Y's make a female. 

Looking back, option B says presence of Y determines maleness. So the correct answer is B.

The determination of mammalian sex, particularly the role of the Y chromosome, was shown to be critical. The presence of a Y chromosome is necessary for males (masculine expression) and absent for females (femaline expression). 

Option B correctly states that the presence of a Y chromosome determines maleness (male) in mammals. This aligns with the understanding that without a Y chromosome, individuals would have an X chromosome and would be female. 

Other options are incorrect because they either describe the opposite role of the Y chromosome (e.g., F for femaleness and J for X), or focus on gene expression rather than the primary determinant of sex (e.g., C, D, E, G, H, I). 

ANSWER: B
