Okay, so I've got this problem here about a manufacturer trying to maximize profit. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question says the manufacturer is selling 2000 units a month at $2 each. They estimate that for every 1-cent increase in price, sales drop by 10 units. Fixed costs are $500, and material and labor cost per unit is 40 cents.

Hmm, okay, so the goal is to find the optimal price that maximizes profit. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs. Let me think about how to model this.

Let me denote the number of 1-cent increases as x. Each increase is 1 cent, so x is a unit of increase. So, if x is 0, the price is $2. If x is 1, price is $2.01, and sales are 2000 - 10*1 = 1990. Wait, but the options given are in dollars with two decimal places, so maybe x is in dollars? Wait, no, because each increase is 1 cent. So, each x is 0.01 dollars. So, for each 0.01 increase, sales decrease by 10 units. 

Wait, but the problem says "for every 1-cent increase", which is 0.01 dollars. So, if x is the number of 0.01 increases, then each x is 0.01 dollars. So, the price becomes $2.00 + 0.01*x.

The sales would then be 2000 - 10*x.

Wait, because for each x, sales drop by 10. So, it's 2000 - 10x.

Now, revenue is price multiplied by quantity sold. So revenue R is (2 + 0.01x) * (2000 - 10x).

Wait, but wait a second—is that right? Because the price per unit is 2 + 0.01x. Because each x is a 1-cent increase. So, for x=0, price is 2, x=1, price is 2.01, etc.

So R = (2 + 0.01x) * (2000 - 10x).

And the cost is fixed plus variable. Fixed is $500, variable is (2000 - 10x) units each at $0.40. So, total cost C = 500 + 0.40*(2000 - 10x).

Then profit P is R - C.

So, P = [ (2 + 0.01x) * (2000 - 10x) ] - [500 + 0.40*(2000 - 10x) ]

Let me simplify this.

First, expand R:

R = (2)(2000 - 10x) + 0.01x (2000 - 10x) = 4000 - 20x + 20x - 0.1x².

Wait, because 0.01x * 2000 = 20x, and 0.01x * (-10x) = -0.1x².

So R simplifies to 4000 - 20x +20x -0.1x². Oh, wait, the -20x and +20x cancel out. So R = 4000 - 0.1x².

Wait, that's a simplification. So R = 4000 - 0.1x².

Now, let's compute the cost part. 0.40*(2000 -10x) = 800 - 4x.

So, C = 500 + 800 -4x = 1300 -4x.

Wait, wait, 0.40*2000 is 800, right? Because 2000 * 0.4 is 800. 2000 * 0.40 = 800. And 2000* (-10x) * 0.40 is -400x. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.40*(2000 -10x) is 0.40*2000 + 0.40*(-10x) = 800 -4x. So that's correct.

So, C = 500 + 800 -4x = 1300 -4x.

So, profit P = R - C = (4000 -0.1x²) - (1300 -4x).

Simplify this: 4000 -0.1x² -1300 +4x.

4000 -1300 is 2700. So P = 2700 -0.1x² +4x.

So, P = -0.1x² +4x +2700.

This is a quadratic function in terms of x. The coefficient of x² is negative (-0.1), so the parabola opens downward, meaning the maximum is at the vertex.

The vertex of a parabola ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, a = -0.1, b =4.

So x = -4/(2*(-0.1)) = -4 / (-0.2) = 20.

So x is 20. So the number of 0.01 increases is 20.

So the price is 2 + 0.01*x = 2 + 0.01*20 = 2 + 0.2 = $2.20.

Wait, but wait, let me confirm.

Wait, x is 20, so the price is 2 + 0.20 = $2.20.

But let me check the options. Oh, looking back, the options are A:2.50, B:1.90, C:2.70, D:2.60, E:1.80, F:2.20, G:2.00, H:2.40, I:2.10, J:2.30.

So option F is $2.20, so that's the price.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in calculating the revenue? Because sometimes when modeling profit, I might have made an error.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should express variables in cents to avoid decimals. Let me try that.

Let me use x as the number of 1-cent increases. So, each increase is 1 cent, so x = 1 for a 1-cent increase.

The price is now (2000 -10x) units, but wait, no: if x increases by 1, price is 2 + x cents (since each is 1 cent). So, price per unit is (2 + x) c.

Sales per month would be 2000 -10x units.

So, revenue R is (2 + x) * (2000 -10x) cents.

Fixed cost is $500, which is 50000 cents.

Material and labor cost is 40 cents per unit, so total variable cost is 0.40*(2000 -10x) dollars. Wait, no. Because in cents, 0.40 dollars is 40 cents. So, no—wait, 0.40 dollars is 40 cents. So, variable cost is 0.40*(2000 -10x) dollars. Wait, maybe it's better to convert everything to cents.

Wait, maybe this approach would help.

Let me convert everything into cents.

Price per unit: 200 cents (since $2 is 200 cents) + x cents (each increase is 1 cent). So, price is (200 + x) cents.

Sales: 2000 -10x units.

Total revenue R: (200 + x) * (2000 -10x) cents.

Fixed cost: $500 is 50000 cents.

Material and labor cost per unit: 40 cents. So total variable cost is (2000 -10x) *40 cents.

So, total cost C = 50000 + 40*(2000 -10x) cents.

Then, profit P is (R) - C.

Expressed in cents, P = R - C.

So, R = (200 + x)(2000 -10x) = 200*2000 + 200*(-10x) + x*2000 + x*(-10x) = 400000 -2000x +2000x -10x² = 400000 -10x².

Wait, so R = 400000 -10x².

Wait, but that can't be right because if x is 0, R is 400000, which is 4000 dollars, but that's higher than before. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in units.

Wait, wait. No, because 200 + x is in cents, and (2000 -10x) is in units. So, R is (200 + x) * (2000 -10x) cents.

Which would be 200*2000 + 200*(-10x) + x*2000 + x*(-10x) = 400000 -2000x +2000x -10x².

Wait, the -2000x and +2000x cancel out, so R = 400000 -10x².

So, R is in cents.

C is 50000 cents (fixed) + 40*(2000 -10x) cents (variable). So, 50000 + 40*(2000 -10x) = 50000 + 80000 -400x = 130000 -400x cents.

So, profit P is R - C = (400000 -10x²) - (130000 -400x) = 400000 -10x² -130000 +400x = 270000 -10x² +400x.

So, P = -10x² +400x +270000.

Wait, that's a different expression than before. So, the quadratic is -10x² +400x +270000.

The maximum is at x = -b/(2a) = -400/(2*(-10))= -400/-20 = 20.

So, x=20. So, price is 200 + x = 220 cents, which is $2.20.

But wait, the options given are all in increments of 0.10 dollars, so 2.20 is option F.

But wait, looking at the options, F is $2.20, so that's the answer.

Wait, but I thought the answer was $2.20, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should re-express everything in dollars. Let me try that approach.

Let me denote x as the number of 1-cent increases, so each x is 0.01 dollars. So, the price is (2 + x*0.01) dollars.

The quantity sold is 2000 -10x.

So, revenue R is (2 + x*0.01) * (2000 -10x) dollars.

Fixed cost is $500.

Variable cost is 0.40*(2000 -10x) dollars.

So, total cost C = 500 + 0.40*(2000 -10x) = 500 + 800 -4x = 1300 -4x.

So, P = R - C = (2 + 0.01x)(2000 -10x) - (1300 -4x).

Expanding R:

(2)(2000) =4000.

(2)(-10x) =-20x.

0.01x * 2000 = 20x.

0.01x * (-10x) = -0.1x².

So R =4000 -20x +20x -0.1x² =4000 -0.1x².

So P = (4000 -0.1x²) - (1300 -4x) = 4000 -0.1x² -1300 +4x = 2700 -0.1x² +4x.

Which is the same as P= -0.1x² +4x +2700.

Vertex at x = -b/(2a) = -4/(2*(-0.1)) = -4 / (-0.2) =20.

So x=20, which is 20 increases of 1 cent, so price is 2 +20*0.01=2.20 dollars.

So the answer is F: $2.20.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try plugging x=20 into the profit formula.

P = -0.1*(20)^2 +4*(20)+2700.

That's -0.1*400 = -40, +80, +2700.

So: -40 +80=40; 40+2700=2740. So profit is $2740.

But if I plug in x=19 and x=21, to see if the profit is lower.

Wait, for x=19:

P= -0.1*(361) +4*(19) +2700= -36.1 +76 +2700= (76-36.1)=39.9 +2700=2739.9. Which is less than 2740.

For x=21:

P= -0.1*(441) +4*(21) +2700= -44.1 +84 +2700= (84-44.1)=39.9 +2700=2739.9.

So yes, x=20 gives maximum profit.

Thus, the price is $2.20, which is option F.
</think>

To determine the price that maximizes profit, we model the situation as follows:

1. **Define Variables**:  
   - Let \( x \) represent the number of 1-cent increases in price.  
   - The price per unit becomes \( 2 + 0.01x \) dollars.  
   - The sales volume decreases by 10 units for each 1-cent increase, so sales become \( 2000 - 10x \) units.  

2. **Calculate Revenue (R)**:  
   Revenue is price multiplied by quantity sold:  
   \[
   R = (2 + 0.01x)(2000 - 10x)
   \]  
   Expanding:  
   \[
   R = 4000 - 20x + 20x - 0.1x^2 = 4000 - 0.1x^2
   \]  

3. **Calculate Total Cost (C)**:  
   Fixed cost = \$500.  
   Variable cost = \( 0.40 \times (2000 - 10x) \) dollars.  
   \[
   C = 500 + 0.40(2000 - 10x) = 500 + 800 - 4x = 1300 - 4x
   \]  

4. **Calculate Profit (P)**:  
   Profit is revenue minus total cost:  
   \[
   P = R - C = (4000 - 0.1x^2) - (1300 - 4x) = 2700 - 0.1x^2 + 4x
   \]  
   This is a quadratic function in the form \( P = -0.1x^2 + 4x + 2700 \), where the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is negative, indicating a downward-opening parabola. The maximum profit occurs at the vertex of this parabola.  

5. **Find Vertex**:  
   The vertex of \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).  
   Here, \( a = -0.1 \) and \( b = 4 \), so:  
   \[
   x = -\frac{4}{2(-0.1)} = -\frac{4}{-0.2} = 20
   \]  

6. **Determine Price**:  
   The price is \( 2 + 0.01x \). Substituting \( x = 20 \):  
   \[
   \text{Price} = 2 + 0.01(20) = 2 + 0.20 = 2.20 \, \text{dollars}
   \]  

Thus, the price that maximizes profit is **$2.20**.
