Okay, so I've got this system of equations to solve, and I need to find the x values of the solutions. Let me write them down first to get a clear picture.

The equations are:
1. 7x - y = 15x
2. -6x + 8y = 15y

Hmm, so there are two equations with two variables, x and y. I think I can solve this using either substitution or elimination. Let me see.

Starting with the first equation: 7x - y = 15x. Maybe I can simplify this equation to express y in terms of x, then substitute into the second equation.

So, subtract 7x from both sides: 7x - y -7x = 15x -7x. That leaves -y = 8x. Multiply both sides by -1: y = -8x.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. 7x - y =15x. Subtract 7x: -y = 8x. Yeah, so y = -8x. That seems right.

Now plug this into the second equation: -6x +8y =15y. Replace y with -8x.

So, substituting, we get: -6x +8*(-8x) =15*(-8x). Let's compute each term.

Compute 8*(-8x): that's -64x.

So left side: -6x -64x = -70x.

Right side: 15*(-8x) = -120x.

So equation becomes: -70x = -120x.

Let me solve for x. Bring all terms to one side: -70x +120x = 0 → 50x =0 → x=0.

Wait, so x is zero? Let me think again. Because if x=0, then from y=-8x, y would be zero as well. So both x and y are zero. Let me plug these back into the original equations to check.

First equation: 7x - y =15x. Plug x=0, y=0: 0 -0=0, which is 0=0. Good.

Second equation: -6x +8y=15y. Plug in x=0, y=0: 0+0=0, which is 0=0. That's correct.

Wait a second, but looking back, maybe I made a mistake in substituting. Let me check the substitution step again. The second equation was: -6x +8y =15y. When I substituted y as -8x, it's -6x +8*(-8x) =15*(-8x).

So that's -6x -64x = -120x. So adding those gives -70x on the left, which equals -120x on the right. Bring -70x to the right: 0 = -50x → x=0. So that's correct.

But looking at the options, option G is 0. So the answer should be G:0.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me reevaluate my substitution because if both x and y are zero, that seems like the only solution. But maybe I should try solving the system using elimination to confirm.

Another approach: let's rewrite both equations.

Equation 1:7x - y = 15x → subtract 15x from both sides: 7x - y -15x =0 → -8x - y =0 → y = -8x.

Equation 2: -6x +8y =15y → rearrange: -6x +8y -15y =0 →-6x -7y=0.

Hmm, so from equation 1, we have y = -8x. Plugging into equation 2:

-6x -7*(-8x) =0 → -6x +56x =0 →50x=0→x=0. So same result. So x=0, y=0.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution in equation 2. Let me try again.

Equation 2: -6x +8y =15y. Subtract 15y from both sides: -6x +8y -15y =0 →-6x -7y=0.

But since from equation 1, y = -8x, substitute into this equation:

-6x -7*(-8x) =0 →-6x +56x =0 →50x=0 →x=0.

Same answer. So x is definitely zero.
</think>

To solve the system of equations:

1. \(7x - y = 15x\)
2. \(-6x + 8y = 15y\)

**Step 1:** Simplify the first equation.

Subtract \(7x\) from both sides:
\[
7x - y - 7x = 15x - 7x \implies -y = 8x \implies y = -8x
\]

**Step 2:** Substitute \(y = -8x\) into the second equation.

\[
-6x + 8(-8x) = 15(-8x) \implies -6x - 64x = -120x \implies -70x = -120x
\]

**Step 3:** Solve for \(x\).

\[
-70x + 120x = 0 \implies 50x = 0 \implies x = 0
\]

**Step 4:** Verify the solution.

Substitute \(x = 0\) and \(y = -8(0) = 0\) into both equations:
1. \(7(0) - 0 = 15(0) \implies 0 = 0\)
2. \(-6(0) + 8(0) = 15(0) \implies 0 = 0\)

Both equations hold true, confirming \(x = 0\).
