Okay, so I've got this nuclear reaction problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The question says that a nuclear reaction is initiated by 5.5-MeV alpha particles. The outgoing particles have kinetic energies of 1.1 MeV and 8.4 MeV. Wait, I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh wait, I remember that in nuclear reactions, the alpha particles are the ones that are emitted, right? So the alpha particles themselves are the projectiles here. 

When alpha particles are emitted, they carry away kinetic energy. But wait, the question gives the kinetic energies of the outgoing particles. Oh, maybe the outgoing particles are the products of the reaction. So the alpha particles (5.5 MeV each) are the ones that are emitted, and the products have some kinetic energy. 

I think the general idea here is conservation of energy. The initial energy of the system (the alpha particles) plus the energy from any other sources (like maybe the reaction's Q value) equals the total energy of the products. So the Q value is the energy released or absorbed in the reaction.

Wait, the Q value is the maximum energy that can be released in a nuclear reaction. The formula I remember is Q = Q_initial + K, where K is the kinetic energy of the products. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Q is the energy that's available, and when the reaction happens, the alpha particles carry away some energy, and the products have their own kinetic energies. 

Wait, another approach: the initial energy comes from the alpha particles. The alpha particles have a certain energy (5.5 MeV each), but maybe that's the kinetic energy? Or is it the total energy including their rest mass? Hmm, I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Wait, in nuclear reactions, when an alpha particle is emitted, the energy released is the Q value. But let's think about the conservation of energy in the reaction. The total energy before the reaction (the alpha particles) plus any other initial energies equals the total energy after (the products plus any kinetic energy of the products). 

Wait, perhaps the initial energy includes the rest mass energy of the alpha particles, and the products have some kinetic energy. The Q value is the maximum kinetic energy possible, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, maybe the total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass of the alpha particles and any other particles present. Then the total energy after is the sum of the rest mass of the products and their kinetic energies. But wait, without knowing the products, maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, another approach: when an alpha particle is emitted, its energy is the Q value if it's the only product. But in this case, the alpha particles are being emitted, and the outgoing particles (products) have kinetic energies. So perhaps the energy of the alpha particles is converted into the rest masses of the products plus their kinetic energy.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the conservation equation. The total energy before the reaction equals the total energy after. So:

Energy before = Energy after.

Energy before includes the kinetic energies of the alpha particles and their rest mass energy. Wait, no, the rest mass energy of the alpha particles is part of their kinetic energy? Or maybe the alpha particles are the ones being emitted, so their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy equals the energy available.

Wait, the total initial energy is the energy of the alpha particles. The initial energy (E_initial) is the sum of their rest mass and kinetic energy? Or is it just their kinetic energy? No, the rest mass is part of the energy.

Wait, the energy of each alpha particle is its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. But, in reality, the alpha particles are the projectile, so the energy is their kinetic plus their rest mass. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial energy is the energy of the alpha particles, which is their rest mass + their kinetic energy. Then, the energy after is the sum of the rest masses of the products plus their kinetic energies.

But I don't know what the products are. Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Since the alpha particles are being emitted, the Q value is the energy that's released when the reaction occurs. So the Q value is the maximum kinetic energy that can be released in the reaction. But without knowing the products, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach.

Wait, another thought. The Q value is the energy that the reaction can release, which is the maximum kinetic energy of the products. But in this case, the alpha particles are the ones emitting the kinetic energy. So maybe the Q value is the sum of their kinetic energies plus the energy provided by the reaction (like the Q itself). 

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the principle. The Q value is the energy available in the reaction. When the reaction happens, the Q value is split between the kinetic energies of the products and any kinetic energy the emitted particles might have. But wait, the emitted particles are the alpha particles themselves, so their kinetic energy is part of the Q value.

Wait, let's think about the formula. The Q value is the energy available. The sum of the kinetic energies of the products (products are the particles released, perhaps the nucleus and any other products) plus the kinetic energy of the emitted particles (the alpha particles) would equal the initial energy plus any initial energy (like rest mass energy of alpha particles).

Wait, perhaps the initial energy is the rest mass energy of the alpha particle plus its kinetic energy. And the final energy is the rest mass energy of the products plus their kinetic energies (including any emitted alpha particles' kinetic energies).

But without knowing the products, I'm not sure. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the Q value is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products (the outgoing particles) plus the kinetic energy of the alpha particles (because they are emitted with some energy). Or wait, no, the alpha particles are the ones being emitted, so their kinetic energy is part of the Q value.

Wait, let's think again. When an alpha particle is emitted, it carries away some kinetic energy. The Q value is the maximum kinetic energy that the reaction can release. So in this scenario, the alpha particles are the ones that are carrying their own kinetic energy, and the products (the nucleus and any other products) have their own kinetic energies.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the equation again. The Q value is the energy that the reaction can release. The formula I remember is that the Q value is the maximum kinetic energy that can be obtained in the reaction. But that might not be the case here, because we're given the kinetic energies of the products.

Wait, perhaps the Q value is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products plus the kinetic energy of the emitted particles. Or, maybe it's just the kinetic energy of the products. But that doesn't seem right because the emitted particles carry their own kinetic energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the Q value is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products and the kinetic energy of the emitted particles (the alpha particles), but in this case, the initial energy is the kinetic energy of the alpha particles.

Wait, because the alpha particles are the ones being emitted, their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy would be the initial energy. The final energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the products plus their kinetic energies.

But without knowing the products, this approach is tricky. 

Wait, perhaps the key is to consider the conservation of energy. The initial energy is the energy of the alpha particles (which is their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy). The final energy is the sum of the rest mass energy of the products plus the kinetic energies of those products.

But since the problem doesn't give the rest mass energies of the products, I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, another thought: the Q value is equal to the maximum kinetic energy available in the reaction. So in this case, the kinetic energies of the products (8.4 MeV and 1.1 MeV) plus any kinetic energy the alpha particles have. But wait, maybe the Q value is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products plus any kinetic energy the emitted particles have. But in this scenario, the emitted particles (alpha particles) have their own kinetic energy, so the Q value would be their kinetic energy plus the kinetic energy of the products.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the Q value is a fixed value determined by the reaction, not dependent on the products. So perhaps the Q value is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products, but that can't be because one of the products might be the alpha particle itself, which would then have its own kinetic energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the Q is the kinetic energy of the products, plus the kinetic energy of the alpha particles. But I'm getting stuck on the initial setup.

Wait, maybe the initial energy is the kinetic energy of the alpha particles (5.5 MeV each), and the final energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the products plus their kinetic energies.

But without knowing the products, I don't know. Alternatively, perhaps the Q value is the maximum kinetic energy, and that's the sum of the kinetic energies of the products. But that doesn't seem right because the alpha particles are emitted, and their own kinetic energy would be part of the Q.

Wait, perhaps the Q value is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products (because the rest mass energy of the products is a fixed value). Let me think about that.

Wait, considering that the Q value is the maximum energy that can be released in the reaction. So the initial energy is the energy of the alpha particles (E_initial = K_alpha + m_alpha c²). The final energy is the sum of the rest masses of the products plus their kinetic energies (E_final = K_alpha + K_products + sum (m_products c²)).

But without knowing the masses of the products, I'm not sure how to compute Q. Since I don't have that information, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the Q value is equal to the sum of the kinetic energies of the products. But that doesn't include the kinetic energy of the alpha particles, which are emitted. Alternatively, maybe the Q value is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products plus the kinetic energy of the alpha particles. Because the alpha particles are leaving with some energy, and the products have their own.

But then, how do I know the alpha particles' kinetic energy? The problem states that the outgoing particles have 1.1 and 8.4 MeV, but maybe those are their kinetic energies. So the alpha particles' kinetic energy isn't given. Wait, the question says the outgoing particles have kinetic energies of 1.1 and 8.4 MeV. So perhaps each of these is a product, and the alpha particles themselves are the ones emitting these kinetic energies.

Wait, wait a second. Perhaps the alpha particles are the ones that are being emitted, so their kinetic energies are part of the Q value. So the Q value is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products (the outgoing particles) plus the kinetic energy of the emitted alpha particles.

But wait, the alpha particles are the ones being emitted, so their kinetic energy is already part of the Q. So the Q would be the rest mass energy of the products plus the kinetic energies of the products (since their rest mass is the minimum energy needed to form them). But I still don't know the rest masses of the products.

So maybe the initial energy is the kinetic energy of the alpha particles plus their rest mass energy. The final energy is the rest mass energy of the products plus their kinetic energies. But since I don't know the products, perhaps this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps the question is simplifying and just wants me to add the kinetic energies of the products. Let me check the options. The options are A:7, B:9, C:2, D:4, E:10, F:-1, etc. Which of these could be the sum of 1.1 and 8.4.

1.1 +8.4 =9.5. But 9.5 isn't an option. Oh wait, looking back, the options include 9.0 (option B) and 10 (E). So 9 is approximate to 9.5? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the Q value is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products. If each product has 1.1 and 8.4 MeV, their sum is 9.5, which is close to option B (9.0) but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation or I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another angle: the Q value is the maximum kinetic energy available in the reaction. So if the products have kinetic energies of 1.1 and 8.4, maybe the Q is the sum of these. But that would be 9.5. The closest option is 9.0 (option B). Alternatively, perhaps the alpha particles each have their own kinetic energy, so the total Q would be 5.5 * 2 (since there are two alpha particles) plus the kinetic energies of the products. But that doesn't make sense because the question states the outgoing particles have kinetic energies of 1.1 and 8.4 MeV, implying two products.

Wait, perhaps the initial energy is the kinetic energy of the alpha particles, and the final energy is the sum of the rest masses and the kinetic energies of the products. But again, without the rest mass of the products, this is tricky.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the Q value is simply the sum of the kinetic energies of the products. Because the alpha particles are emitted, each with their own kinetic energy, and the products have their own kinetic energies.

So if the products have 1.1 and 8.4 MeV of kinetic energy, then Q would be 1.1 +8.4 =9.5 MeV.

But the options don't have 9.5. The closest is B:9.0 and E:10.0.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the initial energy. Alternatively, perhaps the Q value is the difference between the kinetic energies of the products and the emitted alpha particles.

Wait, another thought: the Q value is the total energy released in the reaction, which is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products. Because the initial energy is the rest mass plus the kinetic energy of the alpha particles, and the final energy is the rest mass of the products plus their kinetic energies. But without knowing the rest masses, perhaps the Q is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products.

Wait, but why would the Q be the sum of the products' kinetic energies? Because the rest mass would account for the minimum energy required to form the products. So the Q would be the excess energy, which is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products.

So if the products have 1.1 and 8.4 MeV, then the sum is 9.5, which isn't an option. The closest is option B:9.0.

Wait, looking at the options:

A:7.0

B:9.0

C:2.0

D:4.0

E:10.0

F: -1.0

G:3.0

H:6.0

I:0.0

J:5.0

So the nearest is option B:9.0.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the kinetic energies of the products sum to 9.5, and perhaps the Q value is 9.5, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another idea: the Q value is the maximum kinetic energy available, which is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products. So 1.1 +8.4 =9.5. So the closest option is 9.0. But looking at the options again, the options are 7,9,2,4,10,-1,3,6,0,5.

Wait, the options don't have 9.5, but option B is 9.0. So perhaps I'm supposed to round to the nearest option. Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate.

But wait, let me think again. The alpha particles are the ones being emitted, each carrying their own kinetic energy. The products (nucleus and other particles) have their own kinetic and rest energy. So the Q value is the sum of all the kinetic energies of the products (including the emitted alphas) plus any others.

Wait, but the question only mentions that the outgoing particles have kinetic energies of 1.1 and 8.4 MeV. So perhaps these are the products, and the alphas are the emitted ones whose kinetic energy isn't given. Hmm, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial energy is the total kinetic energy of the incoming particles (or alphas), and the final energy is the kinetic energies of the products. But then, the Q value would be the sum of the products' kinetic energies.

Wait, but if the alpha particles are the ones being emitted, then their kinetic energy is part of the Q value. So the Q value would be the sum of the products' kinetic energies plus any other kinetic energies.

Wait, maybe the Q is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products. Because the rest masses are part of the initial energy, and the products' kinetic energies are the excess after that.

So let's calculate 1.1 +8.4=9.5. The closest option is 9.0 (option B). So the correct answer would be B:9.0.

Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, the Q value is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products. Because the alpha particles are emitted, they carry their own kinetic energy, and the products have their own. So Q is 9.5, but since there's no option for 9.5, perhaps the intended answer is 9.0.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial and final energy is calculated based on the kinetic energies of the products. So the Q value is the sum of the products' kinetic energies. So 1.1 +8.4 =9.5. But looking at the options, 9.0 is there, so the answer is option B.
</think>

To determine the Q value of the nuclear reaction, we analyze the given data. The reaction involves 5.5-MeV alpha particles, which are emitted and carry their own kinetic energy. The outgoing particles (products of the reaction) have kinetic energies of 1.1 MeV and 8.4 MeV. The Q value represents the total energy available in the reaction, which is the sum of the rest masses of the products and their kinetic energies. However, the problem does not provide the rest masses of the products, so we focus on the kinetic energies of the products.

The Q value is calculated as the sum of the kinetic energies of the products. Adding the kinetic energies of the outgoing particles:

\[
Q = 1.1 \, \text{MeV} + 8.4 \, \text{MeV} = 9.5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Since the closest value to 9.5 MeV among the given options is 9.0 MeV, the correct answer is:
