Okay, so I've got this insurance question to tackle. Let's see what it's about. The question is about property damage insurance. Hmm, I remember that property damage insurance is usually called "liability insurance" or "property damage insurance." So Thomas has that on his car, with a limit of $5,000.

Now, the situation is that Thomas is carrying this insurance. So when Frank Hartman's car gets damaged in an accident, the insurance company is supposed to cover part of that damage. But I need to figure out exactly how much they'll pay.

The problem says that the damage is to the extent of $2,350. Wait, so the actual damage was $2,350, right? But how does that translate to the insurance coverage?

I recall that insurance companies typically cover the actual damage, but they might also have a limit. So Thomas's insurance has a $5,000 limit. Since the actual damage is $2,350, which is less than the limit, the insurance company should pay them the full $2,350. If the actual damage was more than the limit, they'd pay up to the limit, and maybe the rest would go to the insurance company for their excess.

Wait, but in this case, the actual damage is $2,350, which is less than the insurance limit. So the company will pay $2,350. So looking at the options, option E is $2,350. That seems right.

Wait, but sometimes there's a catch. Oh, right! There's also the "excess" part. If the damage exceeds the insurance limit, the excess is what the company covers. But in this case, the damage is within the limit. So the company pays $2,350, and the actual damage is $2,350. So the correct answer is E.

The correct answer is E: $2,350. The insurance company will pay the full amount of the actual damage, which is $2,350, since it's within the $5,000 limit.

Answer: E
