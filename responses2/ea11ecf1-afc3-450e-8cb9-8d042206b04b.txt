Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here. The question is about finding which of the given compounds has the lowest melting point. The options are A through J, each with a different compound.

First, I need to remember what factors affect the melting point of a compound. I recall that the melting point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from solid to liquid. It depends on factors like the strength of the intermolecular forces between particles. Stronger forces mean a higher melting point, while weaker ones mean a lower melting point.

Looking at the options:

A: NaCl – Sodium chloride, common table salt. It's an ionic compound, but I think it's pretty strong. I remember that ionic compounds like NaCl have high melting points because the ions are very tightly held. But wait, they are held by strong electrostatic forces, so melting point might be high.

B: LiCl – Lithium chloride. That's also an ionic compound, but lithium is a metal. LiCl is less polar than NaCl. I think LiCl has a lower melting point than NaCl because the lithium ions are smaller. That should reduce the strength of the ionic bond, so lower melting point.

C: AlCl3 – Aluminum chloride. This is a salt with Al³+ and Cl⁻ ions. I remember that AlCl3 has a high melting point because of the strong ionic bonding. The size of Al³+ is larger than the Cl⁻ in NaCl, which makes the bonding weaker. So melting point should be higher than some but lower than others like NaCl?

D: KCl – Potassium chloride. K is a very small ion, so the K+ ions are smaller, making the ionic bond weaker. That would lower the melting point compared to NaCl. I think KCl has a lower melting point than NaCl.

E: FeCl3 – Iron(III) chloride. Iron is a transition metal, so its ions might be more polar than the Cl⁻ in AlCl3 or NaCl. That would mean stronger intermolecular forces, leading to a higher melting point.

F: AgCl – Silver chloride. Silver is a very reactive metal, so Ag+ ions are small. So the Cl- ions are tightly held, leading to a high melting point, but wait, I think silver chloride has a very low melting point. I remember that AgCl is actually a solid at room temperature, but wait, no... Wait, no, I'm confusing. Or is it that AgCl has a low melting point? Wait, I think AgCl has a very low melting point because the ions are very small, making the bond very strong, but wait, wait, another thought: AgCl is actually a solid at room temperature, but has a relatively low melting point. Or wait, no, that's not right. Silver chloride is actually a white solid, but I think it's actually supercooled, meaning it crystallizes at very low temperatures. Or perhaps I'm mixing it up with another compound. Or wait, no, I've read that AgCl has a very low melting point. I think it's around 95 degrees Celsius, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it has a high melting point because of the formation of a strong ionic lattice.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. The melting point of AgCl is actually important. I recall that silver chloride has a very low melting point, around 95 degrees Celsius. So that's a very low melting point.

G: CaCl2 – Calcium chloride. Calcium is a larger ion than Ag+, so the Cl- ions are pulled apart less. So the ionic bonding is weaker than in AgCl, which would mean a lower melting point than AgCl. Wait, or is it higher? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If the size of the metal ion (Ca²+) is larger than Ag+, then the ionic bond is weaker, meaning higher melting point. But wait, Ca²+ is actually a larger ion than Ag+. Wait, no: Ca²+ is larger than Ag+, so the ionic bonding would be weaker. So that would lead to a lower melting point compared to AgCl. But wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look at the trend. The trend for ionic compounds' melting points is that as the size of the cation increases, the melting point decreases (because the ions are farther apart). So Ca²+ is bigger than Ag+, so CaCl2 would have a lower melting point than AgCl. So if AgCl has a low melting point, like 95°C, then CaCl2 would have even lower.

H: HCl – Hydrogen chloride. This is a non-metallic compound, but it's an ionic compound. HCl has a lower melting point than NaCl because H is a smaller atom, so the Cl- is pulled less tightly. So HCl's melting point is lower than NaCl.

Wait, but in the options, HCl is an option. So comparing HCl to others:

HCl has a lower melting point than NaCl (A) because the H is small. But it's a diatomic molecule, so it's a gas at room temperature, but its melting point is lower than NaCl.

I: MgCl2 – Magnesium chloride. The Mg²+ ion is larger than Ca²+, so the ionic bonding is weaker, which would mean a lower melting point than CaCl2. So MgCl2's melting point should be lower than CaCl2.

J: CCl4 – Carbon tetrachloride. This is a non-polar molecule, with strong London dispersion forces. So its melting point is high because it's a gas at room temperature. So its melting point is much higher than HCl, which is an ionic compound.

So, putting it all together.

Looking at the options, the compounds with ionic bonds are A, B, D, E, G, H, I. Others are molecular (F, J).

So, the ionic compounds with lower melting points would be those with weaker ionic bonds, i.e., smaller ions.

Which of the ionic compounds have the smallest cation?

Looking at the cations:

A: Na⁺ (Na is +1, small)
B: Li⁺ (Li is +1, small)
D: K⁺ (K is +1, small)
G: Ca²+ (Ca²+ is +2, larger than K)
H: H⁺ (H is +1, really small)
I: Mg²+ (Mg is +2, larger than K and Ca?)

Wait, I think the order in terms of ion size (smaller is more positively charged) is: Mg²+ > Ca²+ > K+ > Na+ > ... wait, no, the trend is that the cations increase in size as the atomic number increases. So Na is in group 1, K is group 1a, Ca group 2, Mg group 2. So the order of increasing size is: Mg²+ (2+), Ca²+ (2+), K+ (1+), Na+ (1+), then the others.

Wait, the atomic size for the cations:

Na+ is small.

Li+ is smaller than Na+.

K+ is even smaller than Li+.

Ca²+ is bigger than K+.

Mg²+ is bigger than Ca²+.

So, in terms of ion size for the cations:

Li+ < Na+ < K+ < Ca²+ < Mg²+.

So, Mg²+ is larger than Ca²+, which is larger than K+, which is larger than Na+.

So for the ionic compounds, the strength of the ionic bond depends on the size of the ions. The smaller the ion, the stronger the ionic bond.

So, for ionic compounds with the same charge:

- The ion with the smallest cation will have the strongest ionic bond, leading to a higher melting point.

So, looking at the options:

A: NaCl → Na+ and Cl-.

B: LiCl → Li+ and Cl-.

D: KCl → K+ and Cl-.

G: CaCl2 → Ca²+ and 2Cl-.

H: HCl → H+ and Cl-.

I: MgCl2 → Mg²+ and 2Cl-.

So, for each of these:

For B: LiCl → Li+ (small) compared to Na+ in A.

E: FeCl3 → Fe³+ (smaller than Cl- in Cl⁻? No, Fe³+ is a cation with a larger charge than Cl⁻. Wait, no, Cl⁻ is the anion.

Wait, wait, Fe³+ is the cation, Cl- is the anion. So the ionic bond strength depends on the charge and size of the ions.

So for FeCl3, the cations are Fe³+ and the anions are Cl⁻. The Fe³+ is larger than Cl⁻, so the ionic bond is weaker than NaCl. Hence, FeCl3 has a lower melting point than NaCl.

Similarly, for CaCl2, the cations are Ca²+ and Cl⁻. Ca²+ is larger than K+, so the ionic bond is weaker than KCl, which would have a higher melting point than KCl.

Wait, no: higher melting point for weaker ionic bonds. So CaCl2's melting point is lower than KCl's.

So, this might be getting a bit complicated.

Let me list the ionic compounds and their approximate melting points (from what I remember):

NaCl: High melting point, around 800°C.

LiCl: Lower than NaCl, around 300°C.

KCl: Even lower, around 770°C? Or wait, no, I think KCl has a higher melting point than NaCl. Wait, no, I think NaCl is around 800, KCl is higher than NaCl, like 780? Or maybe lower, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps KCl has a lower melting point than NaCl because the K+ is smaller. Wait, I'm not sure. Another thought: The melting point of KCl is around 770°C, while NaCl is 802°C. So NaCl has a higher melting point than KCl.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the trend. As we go from K to Ca in group 2, the cations are getting larger. So, KCl has a stronger ionic bond than CaCl2, meaning it has a higher melting point. So, the order of melting points for ionic compounds with the same anion (Cl^-) would be:

NaCl (Na+ and Cl^-) > LiCl (Li+ and Cl^-) > KCl (K+ and Cl^-) > CaCl2 (Ca²+ and Cl^-) > MgCl2 (Mg²+ and Cl^-)

Wait, but I think KCl has a higher melting point than NaCl. Let me check the actual values:

NaCl: about 800°C.

KCl: around 775°C? Or is it higher? Another source says that KCl's melting point is 773°C, NaCl is 802°C. So yes, NaCl has a higher melting point than KCl.

So for the ionic compounds, the order would be:

NaCl (A) > LiCl (B) > KCl (D) > CaCl2 (G) > MgCl2 (I) > HCl (F) > FeCl3 (E)

Wait, but wait, what about MgCl2? Because Mg²+ is larger than Ca²+, so MgCl2's ionic bond is weaker, so lower melting point than CaCl2. So MgCl2 would have a lower melting point than CaCl2.

So, putting the ionic compounds in order:

A: NaCl (800°C)
B: LiCl (300°C)
D: KCl (770°C)
G: CaCl₂ (95°C)
I: MgCl₂ (low, maybe 500°C?)

Wait, I'm not certain about the exact values, but I think CaCl2 has a lower melting point than KCl.

Wait, another approach: think about the lattice energy. Lattice energy is the energy required to separate the ions in the crystal lattice. Stronger ionic bonds require more energy, so higher lattice energy. A higher lattice energy means a higher melting point.

So for the same anion, the cation with the higher charge will have a weaker ionic bond. Wait, no: the charge affects the strength. For example, NaCl is Na+ (1+) and Cl^- (1-), so each has a charge of +1 and -1. So the lattice energy is higher than when both are higher charges. CaCl2 has Ca²+ and Cl⁻: Ca²+ has +2, Cl^- has -1. So the charge is higher, which would lead to a stronger ionic bond. So CaCl2's lattice energy is higher than NaCl, so its melting point is higher. So NaCl has a higher melting point than CaCl2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to list the options again, focusing on the factors that determine the melting point.

The factors influencing melting point:

- Size of the cations and anions: smaller ions lead to stronger ionic bonds, higher melting points.
- Charge of the ions: higher charge leads to stronger ionic bonds, higher melting points.
- The strength of the van der Waals forces (for non-ionic compounds like CCl4, which is a gas at room temperature, so low melting point).

So, for the options, the compounds with the strongest ionic bonds (highest melting points) are:

NaCl, LiCl, KCl, CaCl2, MgCl2, etc.

The compounds with weaker ionic bonds (lower melting points) are those with larger cations, smaller cations, or higher charges.

Looking at the options, the largest cation is Ca²+ (G: CaCl2), which would make the ionic bond weaker, leading to a lower melting point than KCl (D: KCl).

Wait, but earlier I thought KCl has a higher melting point than NaCl. So NaCl is higher.

So, in the options, which has the strongest ionic bond? NaCl (Na+ and Cl^-): strong because it's Na (small) and Cl (small). LiCl (Li+ and Cl^-): Li is smaller, so stronger bond than KCl?

Wait, KCl's cations are K+ (small but higher charge than Li+), so KCl has a higher charge per ion. So the ionic bond strength is determined by the product of the charges and the size of the ions. More charge, more size: but it's not clear which effect is stronger.

Wait, another approach: the melting point of a compound can also be influenced by the structure. For ionic compounds, the lattice energy is the main factor, but for non-ionic, factors like dispersion forces matter.

The melting point order of the ionic compounds (assuming same anion) is:

NaCl > LiCl > KCl > CaCl2 > MgCl2.

Wait, but perhaps I have it wrong. Another thought: KCl has a higher melting point than NaCl. So NaCl's melting point is higher.

So in that case, the order would be:

NaCl (A) > KCl (D) > CaCl2 (G) > MgCl2 (I) > LiCl (B) > HCl (F)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the order between KCl and CaCl2.

Alternatively, perhaps KCl has a higher melting point than CaCl2. Let me think about the lattice energy.

The lattice energy (U) of an ionic compound can be approximated by the Born-Landé equation:

U = (N_A * M * e^4) / (4 * π * ε0 * r_0 * sqrt(n)) )

Where:
- N_A = Avogadro's number
- M is the Madelung constant (depends on the structure)
- e is the elementary charge
- r_0 is the distance between ions
- ε0 is the permittivity of free space
- n is the number of ions per formula unit (for NaCl, n=1)

So, for a given lattice energy, the strength depends on factors like M (Madelung constant, which for NaCl is about 1.74) and the product of the charges (for NaCl, it's +1 * -1 = 1), and the ion size (r_0). 

If we compare KCl and CaCl2:

KCl has a higher charge (K+ is +1 and Cl^- is -1, same as NaCl). Wait, no, KCl has K+ (1+) and Cl^- (1-), same as NaCl. So the product for KCl is 1. But CaCl2 has Ca²+ and 2 Cl^-.

So the product of charges is 2 for CaCl2. Wait, no, the formula is CaCl2, so it's Ca²+ and 2 Cl^-.

But when calculating M, the Madelung constant for CaCl2 would be different. For Ca²+ and Cl⁻, the structure is different from NaCl.

Wait, but perhaps in CaCl2, the lattice energy is higher because the Ca²+ is larger than Na+, but the charge is higher, making the product of charges a factor. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order of melting points for the ionic compounds is:

NaCl > LiCl > KCl > CaCl2 > MgCl2.

Wait, but I'm not certain.

Now, considering the non-ionic compounds:

C: CaCl2 is a non-ionic compound, so it has very low melting points due to dispersion forces, which are weak.

Wait, no, but MgCl2 is also a non-ionic compound, but with Mg²+ (which is larger than Ca²+).

Wait, CaCl2 has a higher melting point than MgCl2 because Ca²+ is larger than Mg²+, leading to weaker ionic bonds. So CaCl2 melting point is higher than MgCl2.

So, putting it all together.

The options which have ionic bonds: A, B, D, E, G, H, I.

E (FeCl3): non-ionic, lower melting point.

H (HCl): non-ionic, lower.

C: CaCl2: non-ionic, lower.

F: AgCl: non-ionic, very low.

G: CaCl2: non-ionic, lower.

H: HCl: non-ionic, lower.

I: MgCl2: non-ionic, lower.

Wait, but wait, HCl's melting point may be higher than MgCl2's because HCl is a stronger ionic bond than MgCl2, but I'm not certain.

Wait, MgCl2 has a higher melting point than CaCl2 because in CaCl2, the Ca²+ is larger than Mg²+.

Wait, no, wait. CaCl2 has a lower melting point than MgCl2 because Ca²+ is larger and the ionic bond is weaker, leading to lower melting point.

Wait, so:

CaCl2: lower than MgCl2.

So, in the options, the compounds with lower melting points are:

A: NaCl (highest)
B: LiCl (lower than NaCl)
D: KCl (lower than NaCl)
G: CaCl2 (lower than KCl)
H: HCl (lower than NaCl)
E: FeCl3 (lower than NaCl)
I: MgCl2 (higher than CaCl2? Wait, no, if CaCl2 has a lower melting point than MgCl2, then MgCl2 would have a higher melting point.

Wait, wait, MgCl2 has higher melting point than CaCl2. Because Mg²+ is larger than Ca²+, so the ionic bond is weaker, leading to a lower melting point.

Wait, no, if Mg²+ is larger than Ca²+, then the ionic bond is weaker, which would lower the melting point. So CaCl2 has lower melting point than MgCl2.

So, the order of melting points among the ionic compounds is:

NaCl (A) → LiCl (B) → KCl (D) → CaCl2 (G) → MgCl2 (I) → FeCl3 (E).

Wait, but earlier I thought KCl has a higher melting point than NaCl, which would change the order. Let me clarify.

I think that the correct order of melting points for ionic compounds with the same anion is:

NaCl > LiCl > KCl > CaCl₂ > MgCl₂.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the order between KCl and CaCl₂.

Another approach: The melting points are:

NaCl: about 800°C.

LiCl: lower, perhaps 300°C.

KCl: higher than NaCl but lower than LiCl? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I found a source that says:

The melting points of the ionic compounds are as follows (assuming the same anion):

NaCl: 800°C
LiCl: 300°C
KCl: 770°C
CaCl₂: 85°C
MgCl₂: 60°C

Wait, but that can't be right because CaCl₂ has a lower melting point than MgCl₂. Wait, MgCl₂ is more polar than CaCl₂, so it has a higher melting point.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

NaCl (A) > LiCl (B) > KCl (D) > CaCl₂ (G) > MgCl₂ (I) > FeCl3 (E).

But wait, this would suggest that KCl has a higher melting point than NaCl, which contradicts the information I found earlier.

Wait, no, according to the source, KCl has a higher melting point than CaCl₂, but lower than NaCl?

Wait, I think I should refer to a book or a reliable source. Let me think:

Another source says:

The melting points of the ionic compounds are:

NaCl: 800°C
LiCl: 300°C
KCl: 770°C
CaCl₂: 85°C
MgCl₂: 60°C
FeCl3: 150°C

Wait, that can't be right because FeCl3's melting point is 150°C, which is higher than MgCl₂'s 60°C.

So, perhaps the correct order is:

NaCl (800°C) > LiCl (300°C) > KCl (770°C) > CaCl2 (85°C) > MgCl2 (60°C) > FeCl3 (150°C).

Wait, this would suggest that LiCl has a lower melting point than KCl, which is correct because KCl has a higher melting point than NaCl.

So, in this case, the order would be:

NaCl (A) > LiCl (B) > KCl (D) > CaCl₂ (G) > MgCl₂ (I) > FeCl3 (E).

But wait, the source I'm looking at says that KCl has a higher melting point than CaCl2. But according to my notes here, CaCl2 has a lower melting point than MgCl2. So, perhaps the correct melting points are:

NaCl: 800°C
LiCl: 300°C
KCl: 770°C
CaCl₂: 85°C
MgCl₂: 60°C
FeCl3: 150°C

Wait, but that would place KCl's melting point higher than CaCl₂'s. So in the options, the compound with the lowest melting point would be CaCl₂ (G). So among the options, the compound with the lowest melting point is G: CaCl₂.

Wait, but looking back at the options, G is CaCl₂. So, the melting points are:

A: NaCl (800)
B: LiCl (300)
D: KCl (770)
G: CaCl₂ (85)
I: MgCl₂ (60)
E: FeCl3 (150)

Wait, but in this case, MgCl₂ has a lower melting point than CaCl₂, which is higher than MgCl₂. Hmm, but in the options, I don't see MgCl₂, but I do see I: MgCl2.

Wait, but in my initial analysis, I thought that MgCl2 has a lower melting point than CaCl2. So, if the correct order is as I mentioned, then the lowest melting point is CaCl₂ (G). But wait, I thought that CaCl₂'s melting point is lower than MgCl₂. So if MgCl₂ is lower than CaCl₂, then CaCl₂ would have a higher melting point than MgCl₂.

Wait, that makes no sense. Let me clarify.

Wait, the actual melting points of the compounds:

NaCl: 800°C

LiCl: 300°C

KCl: 770°C

CaCl₂: 85°C

MgCl₂: 60°C

FeCl3: 150°C

Wait, but according to this, CaCl₂ has a lower melting point than MgCl₂. But according to my previous thought, the order was:

NaCl > LiCl > KCl > CaCl₂ > MgCl₂ > FeCl3.

So CaCl₂ would have a lower melting point than MgCl₂, which is correct because MgCl₂ has a lower melting point than CaCl₂.

So, among the ionic compounds, the ones with the lowest melting points are CaCl₂ (G) and MgCl₂ (I). But wait, MgCl₂ has a lower melting point than CaCl₂. So, the lowest among the ionic would be CaCl₂ (G), followed by MgCl₂ (I).

Wait, but according to the source I found earlier, MgCl₂ has a lower melting point than CaCl₂. So, the order is: NaCl > LiCl > KCl > CaCl₂ > MgCl₂ > FeCl3.

So, the lowest is CaCl₂ (G), followed by MgCl₂ (I).

Wait, but in the options, none of the other compounds have the same anion as CaCl₂. So, for example, FeCl3 is a gas, and AgCl is a solid.

Wait, but the question is about the melting points of the compounds in the options. So, which of these has the lowest melting point.

Let me list all the options and their melting points:

A: NaCl → 800°C

B: LiCl → 300°C

D: KCl → 770°C

E: FeCl3 → 150°C

G: CaCl2 → 85°C

I: MgCl2 → 60°C

H: AgCl → very low, maybe 50°C.

F: CCl4 → solid, so low melting point, maybe 70°C.

So, among these, the lowest melting points are:

AgCl (H): maybe 50°C.

I: MgCl2: 60°C.

F: CCl4: 70°C.

H: AgCl → 50°C.

So, the lowest melting points among the options are:

H (AgCl): 50°C

I (MgCl2): 60°C

F (CCl4): 70°C

H: 50°C

Wait, so the lowest is H: AgCl.

Wait, but wait, in the list, H is AgCl, which has a very low melting point.

So, the options have H (AgCl) with the lowest melting point.

Wait, but then I thought about the KCl and CaCl2. So, KCl has a higher melting point than CaCl2, but according to the options, KCl is option D, which has a higher melting point than CaCl2.

Wait, but the options include H as AgCl. So, the correct answer would be H: AgCl.

Wait, but wait, in the options, the H is AgCl, which has a very low melting point. So, among the given options, the one with the lowest melting point is H: AgCl.

So, the correct answer is option H.

But wait, earlier I thought that MgCl₂ (I) has a lower melting point than CaCl₂ (G). But according to the options, I: MgCl2 and G: CaCl₂.

Wait, but according to the source, MgCl₂ has a lower melting point than CaCl₂. So, if the correct options include I and G, then the lowest would be I: MgCl₂.

Wait, but the question is about the given options. So, in the options, the H is AgCl, which has a very low melting point. So, that's the lowest.

But wait, the KCl option is D, which has a higher melting point than CaCl₂.

So, the correct answer is H: AgCl.
