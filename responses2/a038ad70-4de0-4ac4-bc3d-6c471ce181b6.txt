Okay, so I've got this question about the exponential decay in NMR, specifically about the T2 relaxation time. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the amplitude drops to 25% of its initial intensity after 1 second. And we're assuming exponential relaxation with Ω equals zero. Wait, Ω being zero... I remember that Ω is related to the relaxation times. Oh right, for T2, the formula is something like an exponential decay proportional to exp(-t/T2). 

So the general formula for exponential decay is I(t) = I0 * exp(-t/T2). Here, I(t) is the intensity at time t, I0 is the initial intensity, and T2 is the relaxation time we're trying to find.

The problem states that after 1 second, the intensity is 25% of the initial. So I(t) = 0.25 * I0. Plugging into the formula: 0.25 = exp(-1 / T2). 

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.25) = -1 / T2. I remember that ln(0.25) is the same as ln(1/4), which is ln(1) - ln(4) = 0 - ln(4) = -ln(4). So, ln(0.25) = -1.386294 (approximately, since ln(4) is about 1.386).

So substituting: -1.386294 = -1 / T2. Simplifying, multiplying both sides by -1 gives 1.386294 = 1 / T2. So T2 is 1 divided by that, which is 1 / 1.386294. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 1/1.386 is roughly 0.72. Wait, what's 1/1.386294 exactly? Let me think. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1.386294 is approximately ln(4), which is about 1.386294361. So 1 / 1.386294361 equals approximately 0.72134752. Oh, so T2 is approximately 0.721 seconds. Let me look back at the options.

The options are:

A:1.000 s

B:2.000 s

C:1.386 s

D:0.721 s

E:1.250 s

F:1.900 s

G:1.500 s

H:1.661 s

I:1.800 s

J:0.750 s

So D is 0.721 s, which matches what we got. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Since Ω is zero, what's the actual relation between Ω and T2? I think when Ω is zero, the decay is purely exponential. So the formula I used should be correct.

Wait, but I also recall that T2 is the time constant in the exponential decay. So yes, the correct formula applies. So I think D is the correct choice.

The question involves determining the relaxation time \( T_2 \) given that the amplitude of a free induction decay drops to 25% of its initial intensity after 1 second, assuming exponential relaxation and \( \Omega = 0 \). The exponential decay formula is:

\[
I(t) = I_0 \cdot e^{-t/T_2}
\]

At \( t = 1 \, \text{s} \), \( I(t) = 0.25 \cdot I_0 \). Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
0.25 = e^{-1/T_2}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(0.25) = -\frac{1}{T_2}
\]

Since \( \ln(0.25) = -\ln(4) \approx -1.386 \), the equation becomes:

\[
-1.386 = -\frac{1}{T_2}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
T_2 = \frac{1}{1.386} \approx 0.721 \, \text{s}
\]

Thus, the relaxation time \( T_2 \) is approximately \( 0.721 \, \text{s} \), which corresponds to option D.
