Alright, so I just came across this question about the percentage of adolescent males who have homos. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the exact statistics, but I remember hearing somewhere that a significant portion of teens engage in this. Let me break it down.

Okay, the question asks about the last character of the answer choice. The options are A through J, each with a percentage. The options are 30, 90, 5, 50, 80, 70, 10, 20, 40, 60. Wait, wait, I think the correct answer is 60%, which is option E. But wait, I'm not 100% sure. Let me think deeper.

I remember reading that about 50% of adolescents experience sexual orientation changes, but the specific ones who are homos during their teens could be a smaller number. Or maybe the question is referring to the total percentage of males who experience homos. Oh wait, I think the answer is 60% because I've heard that around 60% of adolescents have tried sex, and some of them are homos. But I'm a bit confused because I also recall that the number could be higher. Alternatively, maybe it's 50% because that's a common statistic when discussing sexual orientation changes in teens. 

Wait, another angle: the question is about the percentage of males who have homos in their teenage years. So, 60% of males have experienced homos. Alternatively, maybe it's 50% because that's another common statistic when talking about sexual orientation changes. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, I think I remember that approximately 60% of males experience sexual orientation changes, and some of them might be homos. So the answer would be 60%, which is option E. But I'm not entirely certain because sometimes the exact number might vary. Alternatively, perhaps it's 50% because that's another commonly cited figure. I'm a bit torn between E and D.

Wait, another thought: I'm pretty sure that the percentage of males who have had sex is around 60%. So if 60% have had sex, and the question is about homos, which are a subset of that, then maybe 60% is the answer. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, I think this might be a common question in demographic studies, and the answer is 60%, so E.

The correct answer is E: 60%, as it's a commonly cited statistic about the percentage of adolescents who have had sexual orientations that include homos during their teenage years.
