Okay, so I've got this problem about carbon dioxide obeying the reduced Berthelot equation, and I need to calculate its fugacity. Hmm, let's see. I remember from class that the reduced Berthelot equation relates the fugacity to the pressure and temperature relative to the critical points. 

The equation given is z = (PV/RT) = 1 + [9/(128)] [PT_c/(P_c T)] [1 - 6 (T^2_c / T^2)]. Wait, I think I should recheck the formula. Oh yeah, the equation is z = 1 + (9/(128)) * (P P_c T) / (T T_c) * (1 - 6 (T^2_c)/(T^2)) ), but wait, no, the way it's presented here, it's [PT_c/(P_c T)] multiplied by [1 -6 (T^2_c/T^2)].

Wait, the given equation for z is PV/RT = 1 + [9/(128)] times [ (PT_c)/(P_c T) ) ] times [1 - 6 (T_c^2 / T^2) ].

So, I need to find the fugacity, which is f = z * P. So if I can compute z, then multiply by the pressure.

The given data: T is 150°C, which is 150 + 273.15 = 423.15 K. Wait, but the critical temperature T_c is 304.3 K. So T is about 423 K, which is higher than T_c, so the pressure is lower than the critical pressure, which is 73 atm. Hmm, but wait, I'm given pressure P = 50 atm. So P is about 50 atm, which is much lower than P_c (73 atm).

Wait, but in the equation, we have P and T, which are the current conditions. So I need to compute z first.

So, let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute (PT_c)/(P_c T). 

P is 50 atm, T_c is 304.3 K. P_c is 73 atm, T is 423.15 K.

So PT_c = 50 atm * 304.3 K = 15,215 (atm·K)
P_c T = 73 atm * 423.15 K ≈ 30,885 ( atm·K )
So (PT_c)/(P_c T) = 15,215 / 30,885 ≈ 0.493.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 15,215 ÷ 30,885. Let's see, 30,885 ÷ 100 is 308.85, so 30,885 ≈ 308.85 × 100. So 15,215 is about 50% of 30,885. So 0.5? But perhaps I should calculate it exactly:

30,885 / 2 = 15,442.5, which is close to 15,215. So the ratio is 0.493 approximately. So 0.493 approximately.

Now, the next part is [1 -6 (T_c^2 / T^2)]. T_c is 304.3 K, T is 423.15 K.

Compute T_c^2: 304.3^2. Let me calculate that. 300^2 is 90,000. 4.3^2 is about 18.49. The cross term is 2*300*4.3=2580. So total is 90,000 + 2580 + 18.49 = 92,600 roughly. Wait, more accurately: 304.3 * 304.3. Let me compute 300 * 300 =90,000, 300 *4.3=1290, 4.3 *300=1290, 4.3 *4.3=18.49. So adding all terms:

90,000 + (1290 + 1290) +18.49 = 90,000 + 2580 + 18.49 = 92,600 approximately. Alternatively, perhaps a calculator would help, but I'll proceed. 

So T_c^2= (304.3)^2 ≈ 92,600 (K²). T^2 is (423.15)^2. Let's compute that. 400² is 160,000. 23.15² is about 536 (since 23^2=529). And the cross term 2*400*23.15= 2*400*23.15 = 800 *23.15 = 18,520. So T^2 ≈ 160,000 + 18,520 + 536 = 179,056 (K²). 

So T_c^2 / T^2 is 92,600 / 179,056 ≈ 0.519 (since 179,056 * 0.5 is 89,528, which is less than 92,600 by about 3,072. 3072/179056 ≈ 0.0173. So approx 0.519.

So 6*(T_c^2 /T^2) is 6 *0.519=3.114.

So 1 - 3.114 = -2.114.

So now, the entire term [PTc/(Pc T)] * [1-6 (Tc^2/T^2)] is 0.493 * (-2.114) ≈ -1.042.

Then, the equation for z is 1 + [9/128] * (-1.042). Let's compute [9/128] first. 9 ÷ 128 = 0.0703125.

Multiply by -1.042: 0.0703125 * (-1.042) ≈ -0.07315.

So z = 1 -0.07315 = 0.92685.

Wait, wait, let me verify the calculation again. 

Wait, the calculation for [PTc/(Pc T)] is 0.493. The [1 -6*(Tc^2/T^2)] is -2.114. So 0.493 * (-2.114) = let's compute 0.493 * 2.114. 0.493 *2=0.986, 0.493 *0.114= approx 0.0563. So total about 1.0423. But since it's negative, it's -1.0423.

So [PTc/(Pc T)] * [1 -6 (T^2_c / T^2)] = 0.493 * (-2.114) = approximately -1.043.

Then, 9/128 is 0.0703125.

Multiply by -1.043: 0.0703125 * (-1.043) = approximately -0.0732.

So z = 1 + (-0.0732) = 0.9268.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the entire factor is [9/(128)] * [PTc/(Pc T)] * [1 -6 (Tc^2/T^2)].

So it's 9/(128) * (0.493) * (-2.114) → 0.0703125 * 0.493 * (-2.114) → let's compute step by step.

0.0703125 * 0.493 = approx 0.03469.

Multiply that by -2.114: 0.03469 * (-2.114) ≈ -0.0733.

So z = 1 -0.0733 = 0.9267.

Wait, so z is approximately 0.9267.

Wait, but wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute it as (PTc)/(Pc T) multiplied by [1 - 6(Tc²/T²)].

So let me compute (PTc)/(Pc T) = (50 * 304.3) / (73 *423.15) = (15,215) / (30,885) ≈ 0.493.

Then, [1 -6 (Tc²/T²)] = 1 -6*(92600/(179056)) = 1 -6*(approx 0.519) = 1 -3.114 = -2.114.

Multiply 0.493 * (-2.114) = -1.043.

Then, [9/128] is 0.0703125.

Multiply by -1.043 → 0.0703125 * (-1.043) ≈ -0.0733.

Add 1 → z = 0.9267.

So z ≈ 0.9267.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck:

Wait, 304.3^2 is (300 +4.3)^2 = 300² + 2*300*4.3 +4.3² = 90000 + 2580 + 18.49 = 92,618.49 approximately K².

Similarly, 423.15² is (400 +23.15)^2 = 400² + 2*400*23.15 +23.15² = 160,000 + 18,520 + 536 = 179,056 (K²).

So T_c^2 / T^2 = 92,618.49 / 179,056 ≈ 0.519.

So 6 * 0.519 = 3.114.

So 1 -3.114 = -2.114.

Multiply by 0.493: 0.493 * (-2.114) ≈ -1.042.

Then, 9/128 = 0.0703125.

Multiply that by -1.042 → 0.0703125 * (-1.042) ≈ -0.0732.

So z = 1 -0.0732 = 0.9268.

Wait, but wait, I think I forgot that the equation is z = 1 + [9/128]* (PTc/(Pc T)) * (1 -6 (Tc²/T²)).

So that's 1 + (0.0703125) * (-1.042) ≈ 1 - 0.0732 ≈ 0.9268.

So z is approximately 0.9268.

So fugacity f = z * P. P is 50 atm. So f = 0.9268 *50 = 46.34 atm.

Looking at the options, option B is 46.4 atm, which is close to that.

Wait, let me check if any calculation errors. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 9/128 is exactly 0.0703125.

Compute 0.493 * (-2.114) → 

0.493 * 2 = 0.986,

0.493 * 0.114 = approximately 0.0563.

So 0.493 *2.114 = 0.493 *2 + 0.493 *0.114 = 0.986 + 0.0563= 1.0423.

So 0.493 * (-2.114) = -1.0423.

Multiply by 0.0703125: 0.0703125 * (-1.0423) → 

0.0703125 * 1.0423= approx:

0.07 *1.0423 = 0.073, but more accurately:

0.0703125 * 1.0423:

= (0.07 *1.0423) + (0.0003125*1.0423)
≈ 0.073 + 0.000328 → approx 0.073328.

So 0.0703125 * (-1.0423) = -0.073328.

So z = 1 - 0.073328 = 0.926672.

So z ≈ 0.9267.

So f = 0.9267 *50 = 46.335 atm.

Looking at the options, option B is 46.4 atm. So that's the closest.

Wait, but let me double-check if I used the correct formula. The given equation is:

z = 1 + [9/(128)] [ (PTc)/(Pc T) ] [1 -6 (Tc^2 / T^2) ]

So yes, that's correct.

Thus, the answer should be option B: 46.4 atm.

To calculate the fugacity of carbon dioxide at the given conditions, we use the reduced Berthelot equation:

\[
z = 1 + \frac{9}{128} \cdot \frac{PT_c}{P_c T} \cdot \left(1 - 6 \frac{T_c^2}{T^2}\right)
\]

### Given Data:
- \( T = 150^\circ \text{C} = 150 + 273.15 = 423.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P = 50 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( T_c = 304.3 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P_c = 73.0 \, \text{atm} \)

### Step 1: Compute \( \frac{PT_c}{P_c T} \)
\[
\frac{PT_c}{P_c T} = \frac{50 \cdot 304.3}{73 \cdot 423.15} = \frac{15,215}{30,885} \approx 0.493
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \frac{T_c^2}{T^2} \)
\[
T_c^2 = 304.3^2 \approx 92,618.49 \, \text{K}^2, \quad T^2 = 423.15^2 \approx 179,056 \, \text{K}^2
\]
\[
\frac{T_c^2}{T^2} = \frac{92,618.49}{179,056} \approx 0.519
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( 1 - 6 \frac{T_c^2}{T^2} \)
\[
1 - 6 \cdot 0.519 = 1 - 3.114 = -2.114
\]

### Step 4: Compute the term \( \frac{9}{128} \cdot \frac{PT_c}{P_c T} \cdot \left(1 - 6 \frac{T_c^2}{T^2}\right) \)
\[
\frac{9}{128} = 0.0703125
\]
\[
\text{Term} = 0.0703125 \cdot 0.493 \cdot (-2.114)
\]
First, compute \( 0.493 \cdot (-2.114) \):
\[
0.493 \cdot (-2.114) \approx -1.042
\]
Then, multiply by \( 0.0703125 \):
\[
0.0703125 \cdot (-1.042) \approx -0.0733
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( z \)
\[
z = 1 + (-0.0733) = 0.9267
\]

### Step 6: Compute fugacity \( f = z \cdot P \)
\[
f = 0.9267 \cdot 50 \approx 46.34 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated fugacity is approximately \( 46.34 \, \text{atm} \), which matches the closest option provided.
