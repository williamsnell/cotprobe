Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the weak solution to the Laplace equation. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.

The question is asking which method is used to prove that the weak solution exists and is unique for the Laplace equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The equation is Δu = f, with u=0 on the boundary of Ω. The options involve different theorems and inequalities.

First, I remember that weak solutions are solutions in a function space that satisfy the equation in an integral sense, rather than pointwise. This is because the Laplace equation is a second-order PDE, and pointwise solutions are too restrictive.

I think about the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions. I recall that the Lax-Milgram theorem is often used for this purpose. The Lax-Milgram theorem states that for a bounded and coercive bilinear form on a Hilbert space, there's a unique solution to the equation. So, maybe that's involved here.

The options mention Poincaré inequality. The Poincaré inequality relates the L2 norm of a function to the L2 norm of its gradient, provided the function has zero boundary values. That's useful in H1 spaces, which are Sobolev spaces of order 1. So, if the problem is about H1 or Sobolev spaces, Poincaré might come into play.

The Riesz representation theorem is about representing linear functionals as integrals. It says that for a Hilbert space, every continuous linear functional can be represented by an inner product with a unique element of the space. That's definitely part of the standard approach to proving existence and uniqueness using variational methods.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2. Arzelà-Ascoli and Riesz. Arzelà-Ascoli is about compactness in function spaces, specifically about the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem which states that bounded, closed, and uniformly equicontinuous sets are relatively compact in C(Ω). But I don't see how that would relate here. Maybe that's not the main approach.

Option B: 1. Poincaré and Riesz. Poincaré makes sense here because it's about the embedding of H1 into L2, which is critical for weak solutions. So using Poincaré and Riesz, we can set up the problem in a suitable Hilbert space, which is H1, and apply Lax-Milgram.

Option C: 1.0. Wait, that's just 1. So perhaps the answer is 1.0. But I'm not sure if 1. is enough, maybe we need more.

Option D: 2.0. That's Cauchy-Schwarz and Hahn-Banach. Cauchy-Schwarz gives H1 as a Hilbert space, and Hahn-Banach is related to extending functionals. But the key here is Poincaré and maybe Riesz, not sure if Hahn-Banach is needed.

Option E: 1. Poincaré and Sobolev embedding. The embedding theorem would allow us to work within a Sobolev space. So, if you have a solution in H1, then H1 is embedded into H0, which is a subset of L2, and that might be used with Poincaré.

Option F: 1. Poincaré and Banach fixed-point. Banach's fixed-point theorem is about contraction mappings, which might be used for existence via iterative methods, but I think the weak solution proof typically uses a variational approach, like Lax-Milgram or coercive bilinear forms.

Option G: 2. Poincaré and Hahn-Banach. Hahn-Banach is about extending functionals, which is part of Riesz representation. So, if you have the functional and you need to represent it, Hahn-Banach might be involved.

Option H: 2.0. That would be Cauchy-Schwarz and Hahn-Banach. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Option I: 1. Sobolev embedding and Lax-Milgram. The embedding theorem is about the space being compactly embedded, which is useful for compact operators. Lax-Milgram is a variational method, so I think the main approach is either Poincaré and Riesz (option B), or Poincaré and Sobolev embedding (option I). But I'm not certain.

Option J: All of the above. That would mean all the options are correct. But I think only some of these are correct.

Wait, let me think again. The Lax-Milgram theorem is a standard approach. It requires a bilinear form that is continuous and coercive. The bilinear form here would be the inner product, which is obviously continuous because of Cauchy-Schwarz. Coercivity would come from Poincaré inequality. So, for the variational formulation, you need a suitable Hilbert space. The space H1(Ω) is H0^1(Ω), which is the space of functions with zero boundary values and L2 derivatives.

So, the steps would be:

1. Consider the functional F(u) = (f, u) in H1, which is continuous due to Cauchy-Schwarz.

2. Show that the bilinear form a(u, v) = (grad u, grad v) is coercive in H1. This is established via Poincaré inequality, which shows that ||u||_{H1} is equivalent to ||grad u||_{L2}, ensuring that the bilinear form a is coercive.

3. Then, by the Lax-Milgram theorem, since F is continuous and a is coercive, there exists a unique u in H1 such that a(u, v) = (f, v) for all v in H1.

Alternatively, maybe Hahn-Banach is used to extend functionals, but that's part of the Riesz representation theorem's proof.

Wait, the Riesz representation theorem itself is about the existence and uniqueness of the functional representation. So if you have a bounded linear functional on H1, you can represent it as an inner product with a unique element of H1. But in the variational formulation, you're already in the context of H1, so perhaps the Riesz theorem is being used.

If the question is about the proof's main method, then Poincaré and maybe Riesz are involved, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the Lax-Milgram directly, which uses the fact that the bilinear form is bounded and coercive, which is why Poincaré is needed for coercivity.

So looking at the options:

Option B says 1. Poincaré and Riesz. That would be the case because you need Poincaré to show that the bilinear form is coercive. Then, Riesz allows you to represent functionals, which would be the Lax-Milgram approach.

Alternatively, option I says 1. Sobolev embedding and Lax-Milgram. The embedding theorem is about the embedding of H1 into L2, which is used in the variational formulation. But the proof itself uses either Poincaré and Riesz (if using Lax-Milgram) or maybe Poincaré and Hahn-Banach (if using the Riesz theorem). I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, another approach: the weak solution is found by considering the functional F(u) = (f, u) and seeking u in H1 such that a(u, v) = F(v) for all v in H1. To show existence, we can use the Lax-Milgram theorem, which requires that a is bounded and coercive. Boundedness is Cauchy-Schwarz. Coercivity is Poincaré's inequality.

Riesz's theorem says that any bounded linear functional on a Hilbert space can be represented by an inner product. So, if you have a functional F, you can represent it as (., w), where w is in H1. But that's part of the Lax-Milgram approach, which is using the coercive bilinear form.

Alternatively, if you use Hahn-Banach, but that's a more general approach and perhaps not as direct as Lax-Milgram.

So, the key is the Poincaré inequality is used to show that the bilinear form is coercive, which is then used with Lax-Milgram. So, the method is Poincaré and Riesz.

But wait, isn't the Riesz theorem more about the uniqueness and existence of the functional's representation, not directly about the coercivity needed for Lax-Milgram?

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 2. Cauchy-Schwarz and Hahn-Banach. Because Cauchy-Schwarz gives the boundedness, and Hahn-Banach allows extending functionals, which is part of the Riesz representation.

Wait, but Hahn-Banach is a more general theorem. The Riesz representation is a specific case, but Hahn-Banach is more about extending functionals, which could be part of the argument. Alternatively, maybe the proof proceeds by using the Hahn-Banach theorem to extend a functional, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 1. Poincaré inequality and Riesz representation theorem. Or maybe 2. Cauchy-Schwarz and Hahn-Banach.

Wait, another approach: weak solutions are found using the variational method, which involves setting up an inner product in H1. So, you use the bilinear form (grad u, grad v). To show it's coercive, you use Poincaré, which states that ||u||_{H1} is equivalent to ||grad u||_{L2}.

The coercivity of the bilinear form is that for some constant c>0, a(u, v) ≥ c ||u||_{H1} ||v||_{H1}.

So, using Poincaré, we can say that ||u||_{H1} is bounded below by ||grad u||, which is bounded by ||u||_{L2} + ||grad u||_{L2}. Wait, no, perhaps using a modification of Poincaré inequality where the constant depends on the domain, which ensures that the bilinear form is bounded below by c ||u||_{H1} ||v||_{H1}.

Alternatively, maybe the exact statement of Poincaré is that the L2 norm of u is bounded by the L2 norm of its gradient, which is true when u has zero boundary values. So, for any u in H1 with u=0 on ∂Ω, ||u||_{L2} ≤ C ||∇u||_{L2}, for some constant C.

This would imply that ||u||_{H1}² = ||u||_{L2}² + ||∇u||² ≤ (C² + 1) ||∇u||². But that's only if u has zero boundary values. So in the variational setting, you can't directly say that the bilinear form is coercive unless you have u=0 on the boundary.

Wait, but in the problem statement, u is zero on the boundary, so that's the case we're considering. So, in that case, you can use Poincaré to say that the H1 norm is equivalent to the H1 seminorm, which allows you to show that the bilinear form is coercive. So, that's why Poincaré is needed for the coercivity.

So, the steps in the proof would be:

1. Set up the variational problem: find u in H1 such that (grad u, grad v) = (f, v) for all v in H1.

2. Show that the bilinear form a(u, v) = (grad u, grad v) is bounded: |a(u, v)| ≤ ||grad u|| ||grad v|| ≤ C ||u||_{H1} ||v||_{H1} (using Cauchy-Schwarz).

3. Show that a is coercive: a(u, u) ≥ c ||u||_{H1}². For this, use Poincaré's inequality, which gives ||u||_{H1} ≤ C ||grad u||. So, a(u, u) = ||grad u||² ≥ (1/C²) ||u||_{H1}².

So, the coercivity is established using Poincaré. Then, by the Lax-Milgram theorem, since a is bounded and coercive, and F is bounded, there exists a unique u in H1 such that a(u, v) = F(v) for all v.

But wait, in the problem statement, the options are about the methods used. So the steps are: either using Poincaré and Riesz, or Cauchy-Schwarz and Hahn-Banach.

Alternatively, since the functional is represented via the Riesz theorem, which is part of the H1 Hilbert space, and the coercivity is achieved via Poincaré. But I'm not entirely certain which option corresponds to this.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: 1. Poincaré and Riesz. So, that would include both steps.

Option I: 1. Sobolev embedding and Lax-Milgram. So, if you use H1 embedding into L2, which is the Sobolev embedding (maybe H1 is embedded into L2), then using Lax-Milgram. But I'm not sure if that's the standard approach.

Wait, the standard approach is to use variational formulation with Poincaré and Riesz. So, which option includes that?

Option B is 1. Poincaré and Riesz. So, perhaps that's correct.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the Lax-Milgram theorem, which requires the bilinear form to be bounded and coercive. Boundedness is Cauchy-Schwarz, coercivity is Poincaré.

But in the options, option 2 is Cauchy-Schwarz and Hahn-Banach. Hahn-Banach is used to extend functionals, which is part of the Riesz representation. So, maybe Cauchy-Schwarz gives the boundedness, and Hahn-Banach gives the uniqueness, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think the correct answer is 2. Cauchy-Schwarz and Hahn-Banach. Because these are used in the proof of the existence of the solution via the Lax-Milgram method. Wait, but Hahn-Banach is a more general theorem about extending functionals, which is part of the Riesz representation theorem. So, perhaps option 2 is not the correct answer.

Wait, the question is about which method is used to prove the existence and uniqueness. So, it's either Poincaré and Riesz, or perhaps Lax-Milgram with Riesz.

Wait, another thought: weak solutions are found using the variational method, which involves setting up an inner product in H1. So, you use the bilinear form (grad u, grad v). To show it's coercive, you use Poincaré, which is the key. So, the main method is Poincaré and Riesz.

But wait, Riesz theorem is about the existence of the Riesz rep for functionals. So, if you have a bounded linear functional on a Hilbert space, you can represent it as an inner product. So, in the variational problem, perhaps the Riesz theorem is used to show that the functional F has a unique representation, which is the Lax-Milgram theorem.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 2. Cauchy-Schwarz and Hahn-Banach. Because the functional F is bounded, so Cauchy-Schwarz gives the bound. Then, to show uniqueness, you might use Hahn-Banach to extend the functional, which would relate to the Riesz theorem.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 1. Poincaré and Riesz. Because Poincaré is needed for the coercivity, and Riesz is for the existence of the functional's representation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the standard proof.

In standard textbooks, the proof for existence and uniqueness of the weak solution is as follows:

1. Assume u is in H1 and satisfies Δu = f, u=0 on ∂Ω.

2. Set up the functional F(v) = (f, v), and the bilinear form a(u, v) = (grad u, grad v).

3. Show that a is bounded (Cauchy-Schwarz) and coercive (using Poincaré inequality).

4. Apply the Lax-Milgram theorem, which requires a to be bounded and coercive, and F is bounded.

5. Then, F is a bounded linear functional on H1, and by Riesz, it's represented by a unique u in H1.

So, the key steps are Poincaré (coercivity) and Riesz (functional representation). So, the method is Poincaré and Riesz.

Thus, option B is 1. Poincaré and Riesz.

But wait, another thought: sometimes people use the Hahn-Banach theorem in the proof, but I'm not sure if that's part of the standard approach. Alternatively, the Hahn-Banach theorem could be used to extend the functional beyond the boundedness, but I think that's more about the Riesz theorem.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 2. Cauchy-Schwarz and Hahn-Banach. Because Cauchy-Schwarz gives the boundedness, and Hahn-Banach allows the functional to be represented, which is part of the Riesz theorem.

Wait, but Hahn-Banach is about extending a functional, which is a more general concept. The Riesz theorem is specific to Hilbert spaces and their duals. So, perhaps using Cauchy-Schwarz for boundedness, and Hahn-Banach for extending functionals, but that's part of the Riesz theorem's proof.

I'm getting a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is option B: 1. Poincaré and Riesz. Because that's the standard approach in the variational method, using the Poincaré inequality for coercivity and Riesz for the functional representation.
</think>

The correct answer is option B: 1. Poincaré inequality and Riesz representation theorem.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to prove the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution to the Laplace equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. This solution is a function \( u \) in the Sobolev space \( H_1(\Omega) \) (which consists of functions with zero boundary values and square-integrable derivatives) such that \( \Delta u = f \) in the weak sense.

2. **Variational Approach:** The weak solution can be found by minimizing the energy functional:
   \[
   E(u) = \frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega |\nabla u|^2 \, d\Omega
   \]
   This is equivalent to solving the variational problem:
   \[
   \int_\Omega (\nabla u, \nabla v) \, d\Omega = \int_\Omega f v \, d\Omega \quad \text{for all } v \in H_1(\Omega)
   \]

3. **Boundedness of the Bilinear Form:** The bilinear form \( a(u, v) = \int_\Omega (\nabla u, \nabla v) \, d\Omega \) is bounded by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
   \[
   |a(u, v)| \leq \|\nabla u\|_{L^2} \|\nabla v\|_{L^2} \leq C \|u\|_{H_1} \|v\|_{H_1}
   \]
   This shows that \( a \) is bounded.

4. **Coercivity of the Bilinear Form:** Coercivity is established using the Poincaré inequality, which states that:
   \[
   \|u\|_{H_1} \leq C (\|\nabla u\|_{L^2} + \|u\|_{L^2})
   \]
   For functions with zero boundary values, this simplifies to:
   \[
   \|u\|_{H_1} \leq C \|\nabla u\|_{L^2}
   \]
   Using this, we can show that \( a(u, u) \geq c \|u\|_{H_1}^2 \), ensuring coercivity.

5. **Application of Lax-Milgram Theorem:** Since \( a \) is bounded and coercive, and the functional \( F(v) = \int_\Omega f v \, d\Omega \) is bounded, the Lax-Milgram theorem guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution \( u \in H_1(\Omega) \).

6. **Role of Riesz Representation Theorem:** The Riesz representation theorem states that any bounded linear functional on a Hilbert space can be represented as an inner product with a unique element of the space. In this context, the functional \( F \) is represented by a unique function \( u \in H_1(\Omega) \), which is the essence of the Riesz theorem.

7. **Conclusion:** The proof relies on the Poincaré inequality to establish coercivity of the bilinear form and the Riesz representation theorem to represent the functional, ensuring the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution.

**Answer:** B. 1. Poincaré inequality and Riesz representation theorem.
