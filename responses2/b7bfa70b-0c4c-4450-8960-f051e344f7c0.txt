Okay, so I have this question about the percentage of deaths in Greenland that are attributed to suicide in 2017. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what I learned about suicide statistics. I think it's something like a specific percentage, but I can't quite recall the exact number. Let me think. I remember that other countries have their suicide rates, so maybe I can find a general trend or figure.

Wait, I think I've heard that the rate of suicide in Greenland was quite low in the past. Like, maybe it's in the single digits percent. Let me think about the options given. The options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from 1.8% up to 9.00%. 

I remember that in 2017, the number might have been around 1.8%, but wait, I'm not sure. I think I read somewhere that it's below 2%, but I'm not exactly certain. Alternatively, maybe it's around 1.2% or so. 

Alternatively, I recall that in some countries, the suicide rate has been declining. Like, maybe in 2017, Greenland's rate was lower than it was in previous years. So if 2016 was, say, 1.5%, then 2017 might be lower. But I'm not exactly sure of the exact figure.

Another angle: I think the number I remember is around 1.8%. Option J is 1.80%, which is one of the options. But wait, I'm second-guessing because I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, I think the number might be around 1.2% or 1.4%. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for a general knowledge point. Oh yeah, I think in 2017, the rate was below 2%, so the options would be in the single digits. So options like 1.8% (J), 1.2% (maybe not here), or 1.5% (not an option). The options given include 1.8, 2.4, 3.6, etc.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the actual numbers. I think I remember a figure of about 1.8% for 2017. So looking at the options, J is 1.80%, which would be the correct answer.

The correct answer is J: 1.80%. This aligns with the knowledge that the suicide rate in Greenland in 2017 was approximately 1.8%.

Answer: J
