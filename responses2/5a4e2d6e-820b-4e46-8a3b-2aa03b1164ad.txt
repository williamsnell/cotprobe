Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about instruction-set features and their impact on aggressive pipelining in an integer unit. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which feature is NOT generally considered an obstacle to aggressive pipelining. The options are A, B, C, D. I remember that in computer architecture, pipelining is a technique that allows multiple instructions to be processed in parallel, which improves performance. Aggressive pipelining can be challenging because some features might cause delays or inefficiencies.

Let's go through each option.

Option A: Condition codes set by every instruction. Condition codes are flags that indicate certain errors or states. I think if every instruction sets a condition code, it could complicate the pipeline because the pipeline might need to handle these conditions across multiple stages. But I'm not sure if this is an obstacle or not. Maybe it's more about state management and can be managed without much delay.

Option B: Variable-length encoding of instructions. Variable-length encodings mean that instructions can vary in length. This could cause issues because the pipeline might need different numbers of cycles for each instruction. For example, a short instruction might not take as long as a long one, and the pipeline might have to wait for the long ones to finish before moving on, which can slow things down. So this might be an obstacle.

Option C: Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute. This sounds similar to option B. If some instructions take many more cycles than others, the pipeline can't keep up. It might cause stalls or delays as the shorter ones finish, which would be a problem. So this might be an obstacle.

Option D: Several different classes (sets) of registers. Different registers can be used in various instructions, so having multiple types of registers might allow the pipeline to be more efficient by handling them in parallel. But wait, if there are many different types, the pipeline might not be able to handle all of them efficiently because each type requires different control paths. So this could be an obstacle, because the number of registers is high, and the pipeline might not be able to process them all without some overhead.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT an obstacle. Let me reevaluate.

The question is which is NOT an obstacle. So the correct answer would be the feature that doesn't cause a significant delay or block the pipeline, allowing for aggressive pipelining.

Option A: Condition codes. I think that in pipelining, condition codes can be handled in the same pipeline stages. For example, a condition code can be checked in a certain stage, so every instruction doesn't cause a stall in those stages. So this isn't an obstacle.

So the features that could be obstacles are B, C, D. The one that's not is A.

The correct answer is **A: Condition codes set by every instruction**. 

**Explanation:**
- **Condition codes** are flags indicating specific errors or states. They can be managed within the same pipeline stages, allowing for efficient processing without significant delays.
- **Variable-length instruction encoding** (option B) and **widespread instruction cycle variations** (option C) can cause pipeline stalls as shorter instructions finish before longer ones, which is an obstacle.
- **Multiple registers** (option D) can lead to inefficiencies if they are not handled in parallel, potentially blocking the pipeline.

Thus, condition codes do not pose an obstacle during aggressive pipelining.
