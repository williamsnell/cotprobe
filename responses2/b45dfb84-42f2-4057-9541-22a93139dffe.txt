Okay, so I've got this problem about mixing liquids and finding the final temperature when mixing two specific liquids. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says we have three liquids with temperatures 15°C, 20°C, and 25°C. When equal masses of the first two are mixed, the final temp is 18°C. When equal masses of the last two (20 and 25) are mixed, the result is 24°C. Now, we need to find the final temperature when equal masses of the first and third liquids (15 and 25) are mixed.

Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused about the setup. Let me rephrase. Let's say the three liquids are A, B, C. A is 15, B is 20, C is 25. But the problem gives two different mixtures: mixing A and B (equal masses) gives 18°C. Mixing B and C gives 24°C. Then, we mix A and C (equal masses) and find the final temp.

Right, so I think I need to use the principle that when two masses are mixed, the final temperature depends on their specific heats. But wait, the problem doesn't give specific heats. Oh, wait, but maybe I can assume specific heats are the same? Because when you mix two liquids with different temperatures, the final temp depends on the masses and the specific heats. But if specific heats are the same, like water, then the final temp is the average. But I don't know if that's the case here.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the first case. When masses are equal, the final temp is the average of the two. Because for equal masses, the specific heat contributions would average out. So for equal masses, the formula would be:

T_final = (T1 + T2) / 2.

So in the first case, mixing A (15) and B (20) gives (15 +20)/2=17.5. But the actual result is 18°C. Hmm, that's close, but not exact. So maybe the specific heats aren't the same, which complicates things.

So perhaps the specific heats are different. Let me denote the specific heats of the liquids as c_A, c_B, c_C. Since the masses are equal, the heat lost by the hotter temp will equal the heat gained by the cooler temp.

The formula for the final temperature when mixing two masses m1 and m2 (equal in this case) is:

m * c * (T_initial) = m * c_avg * (T_final - T_initial_avg)

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to think about the heat transfer. When you mix two liquids of equal mass, the final temp is the same as if you mixed them by considering the heat lost by hotter and gained by cooler.

So for two equal masses, the final temp (T) is given by:

T = (c_A * T_A + c_B * T_B) / (c_A + c_B)

Because the mass cancels out. Right? Because each mass is m, so each contributes m*c*T.

So, for the first case, when A (15°C) and B (20°C) are mixed, the final temp is 18°C. So:

( c_A * 15 + c_B *20 ) / (c_A + c_B) = 18.

Similarly, when B (20) and C (25) are mixed, the final is 24. So:

( c_B *20 + c_C *25 ) / (c_B + c_C) )=24.

We have two equations with three variables (c_A, c_B, c_C). But we probably need more information to find the third variable. Wait, but the question is about mixing A and C, so maybe we can find their specific heat ratio.

Let me write the equations again.

Equation 1:

(15 c_A +20 c_B) = 18 (c_A + c_B).

Multiply both sides by (c_A + c_B):

15 c_A +20 c_B = 18 c_A + 18 c_B.

Bring like terms together:

15c_A -18c_A +20c_B -18c_B =0 → -3c_A +2c_B=0 → 2c_B =3c_A → c_B = (3/2) c_A → equation (A).

Equation 2:

(20 c_B +25 c_C) =24 (c_B + c_C).

Expanding:

20 c_B +25 c_C =24 c_B +24 c_C.

Bring terms together:

20c_B -24c_B +25c_C -24c_C =0 → -4c_B + c_C =0 → c_C =4 c_B → equation (B).

From equation (A), c_B is 1.5 c_A. So c_C =4 * 1.5 c_A =6 c_A.

So now, c_A is some value. Let me assign a variable, say, c_A = x. Then c_B=1.5x, c_C=6x.

Now, the question is to find the final temperature when equal masses of A and C are mixed. So, using the equation I wrote earlier:

T = (c_A * T_A + c_C * T_C) / (c_A + c_C).

Substituting the values:

T = (x *15 +6x *25 ) / (x +6x) → x(15 + 150) / (7x) → x*165 /7x = 165/7.

Wait, 165 divided by 7. Let me compute that. 7*23=161, 165-161=4, so it's 23 and 4/7 degrees Celsius. Wait, that's option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, equation for T when mixing A and C:

T = (c_A * 15 + c_C *25 ) / (c_A + c_C).

From earlier, c_C =6 c_A.

Substituting,

T = [x *15 +6x *25 ] / (x +6x) → x(15 + 150) =x*165 → denominator is7x. So 165x /7x =165/7 =23.42857... which is 23 and 4/7 degrees Celsius. So that's option C.

Wait, but let me check the question again. The options are:

A: 22, B:21, C:23 4/7, D:25, E:19, F:20 5/7, G:22 1/3, H:19 1/2, I:20, J:24 1/2.

Yes, option C is the correct one. So the final temperature when mixing equal masses of A and C would be 23 4/7°C, which is option C.

To determine the final temperature when equal masses of the first and third liquids (15°C and 25°C) are mixed, we analyze the given information and apply the principle of heat conservation for equal masses. The final temperature for mixing two liquids of equal mass is given by:

\[
T = \frac{c_A \cdot T_A + c_C \cdot T_C}{c_A + c_C}
\]

where \(c_A\), \(c_B\), and \(c_C\) are the specific heats of the liquids, and \(T_A\), \(T_B\), and \(T_C\) are their respective temperatures.

### Step 1: Analyze the given mixtures
1. **Mixing A (15°C) and B (20°C) to get 18°C**:
   \[
   \frac{c_A \cdot 15 + c_B \cdot 20}{c_A + c_B} = 18
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   15c_A + 20c_B = 18c_A + 18c_B \implies -3c_A + 2c_B = 0 \implies c_B = \frac{3}{2}c_A
   \]

2. **Mixing B (20°C) and C (25°C) to get 24°C**:
   \[
   \frac{c_B \cdot 20 + c_C \cdot 25}{c_B + c_C} = 24
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   20c_B + 25c_C = 24c_B + 24c_C \implies -4c_B + c_C = 0 \implies c_C = 4c_B
   \]

### Step 2: Relate specific heats
From the above equations:
- \(c_B = \frac{3}{2}c_A\)
- Substituting \(c_B\) into \(c_C = 4c_B\):
  \[
  c_C = 4 \cdot \frac{3}{2}c_A = 6c_A
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the final temperature for mixing A and C
Using the formula for mixing equal masses:
\[
T = \frac{c_A \cdot 15 + c_C \cdot 25}{c_A + c_C}
\]
Substitute \(c_C = 6c_A\):
\[
T = \frac{c_A \cdot 15 + 6c_A \cdot 25}{c_A + 6c_A} = \frac{15c_A + 150c_A}{7c_A} = \frac{165c_A}{7c_A} = \frac{165}{7} \approx 23.43
\]
This simplifies to \(23 \frac{4}{7}\)°C.

### Final Answer:
The final temperature when equal masses of the first and third liquids are mixed is **23 4/7°C**, which corresponds to option **C**.
