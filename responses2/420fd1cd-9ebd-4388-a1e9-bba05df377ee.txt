Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a study by Sprecher, Barbee, and Schwartz from 1995. The question is about what women are more likely to feel after their first intercourse. The options are a bunch of different emotionsâ€”like relief, excitement, regret, etc.

Hmm, I remember from my psychology classes that gender differences in sexual experiences are a studied topic. I think the study in question is about women feeling more guilt or something like that. Wait, where did I get that from? I think it's a classic study that showed women have more negative emotions when they first have sex.

Let me think about the options. The options list various emotions. The correct answer is likely guilt because Sprecher, Barbee, and Schwartz's study would suggest that women experience more guilt after their first act. I recall that women often have feelings of shame and guilt, while men have more excitement or relief. So options like guilt, regret, or shame would fit.

Looking at the options, option H is "experienced guilt." That seems right. The other options don't fit as well. For example, option B is excitement, which I think men have more of. Decoy options like relief or confusion are more likely for men. Felt fear is another negative emotion, but I don't think that's the main point of the study.

Wait, I should double-check. Maybe the study was about guilt. So the answer is H: experienced guilt.

The correct answer is H: experienced guilt. This aligns with the study that found women experiencing more guilt after their first act.

Answer: H
