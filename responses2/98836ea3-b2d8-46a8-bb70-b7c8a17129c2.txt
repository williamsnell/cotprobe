Question:

After a party where the adults all drank alcohol, with everyone having at least six beers, they started up a game of baseball. The host supplied the bats, balls and gloves. An argument arose at home plate after a controversial call by the umpire, who was inebriated like all of the other participants. The host of the party became enraged at the umpire's decision and hit him in the face, breaking his nose. The umpire pressed charges when he became sober, and the authorities charged the host with criminal battery. At trial, the defense raised the defense of voluntary intoxication, arguing that the host lacked the mentality to form an intent to commit a criminal battery. Will the defense of voluntary intoxication be successful under these facts?

Options:

A: Yes, voluntary intoxication is always at least a partial defense to any crime that requires mens rea.
B: No, criminal battery in this case is a general intent crime and the defense of voluntary intoxication is not available.
C: No, because the host was the organizer of the party and should have had control over the situation.
D: No, the host was grossly negligent in allowing a group of drunk men to play a dangerous game of hardball, which precluded him from the benefit of the defense.
E: Yes, criminal battery is a specific intent crime to which voluntary intoxication may be asserted as a defense.
F: No, because the host willingly drank the alcohol and should have known the possible consequences.
G: Yes, because the umpire was also intoxicated and could have misjudged the situation.
H: No, because the host used excessive force in a situation that did not warrant it.
I: Yes, because the umpire provoked the host by making an unfair call.
J: Yes, because the host was not in his right mind due to the alcohol.

Alright, let's tackle this question. So, the scenario is about a party where adults all drank a lot of beer, and they started a baseball game. The host used the bats, balls, and gloves, which led to an argument. The umpire, who was also drunk, made a controversial call, and then the host got hit with a nose by the umpire. The authorities charged him with criminal battery, and the defense is arguing that he lacked the intent to commit the crime because he was drunk. The question is whether the defense of voluntary intoxication is successful here.

First, I need to understand what voluntary intoxication is. From what I remember, voluntary intoxication is a defense you can use in criminal cases if your intoxication (alcohol) was deliberate. So, it's not enough to just be drunk; you have to know you were drunk at the time of the crime. It's a partial defense for crimes that require mens rea, which is a legal awareness of one's own actions or the state of one's mind.

The defense in question is about criminal battery. Now, I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics here. I think criminal battery is a specific intent crime. Specific intent crimes, like battery, require a clear intent to commit the act. The defendant's intent is the main factor here. So, if a person is intoxicated and hasn't drunk anything, can their intoxication be used as a defense?

Wait, I remember reading that voluntary intoxication can sometimes be a partial defense for crimes that require mens rea. So, if the defendant knows they were intoxicated when they committed the crime, they can argue that it's a partial defense. But wait, is it a defense for all crimes that require mens rea, or only for specific ones?

In this case, criminal battery is definitely a specific intent crime. So, for specific intent crimes, voluntary intoxication is generally considered a partial defense. That means the defense is not a complete one, but it can sometimes be used to minimize the sentence, not necessarily to prove the crime. So, the defense is available.

But let me think about the elements. For the defense to be successful, two things must be there: 
1. The defendant was intoxicated and had no intention to commit the crime.
2. The defendant had a clear intent to commit the act.

In the scenario, the defense says the host lacked the mental fortitude. So, the key here is whether the host knew he was drunk at the time. If he didn't know, then he's not guilty, and the defense is successful. But if he did know, then voluntary intoxication might not be a defense because he could've been intoxicated anyway.

But the question is whether the defense is successful. So, if the defense is based on the fact that the defendant was intoxicated and had no intent, and that the crime requires mens rea, then the defense is available.

Wait, but I'm not sure if voluntary intoxication is considered a defense for all crimes. I think in general, voluntary intoxication can be a defense for specific intent crimes, but it's not a complete defense. So, the answer would be that the defense is successful because the defendant knew he was intoxicated at the time.

Looking at the options, option A says yes, voluntary intoxication is always at least a partial defense. That sounds correct. Option B says no because it's a general intent crime and the defense isn't available. That's not right because criminal battery is specific intent.

Option C says no because the host should have had control. The defense is about his intoxication, not about control. So, the host's role as an organizer isn't relevant here.

Option D says no because he was negligent. The defense is about intoxication, not negligence. So, that's not the reason.

Option E says yes, it's a specific intent crime, so defense can be used. That seems right, but wait, is the defense of voluntary intoxication available for specific intent crimes? I think so.

Option F says no because he knew the consequences. The defense is about intoxication, not about the consequences. So, even if he knew the consequences, the defense is about intoxication, not about knowing the consequences.

Option G says no because the umpire was also intoxicated. That's about the defendant's intoxication, not the defense.

Option H says no because of unfair call. That's about the event, not the intoxication defense.

Option I says yes because of the unfair call. Again, not directly about intoxication.

Option J says yes because of his mind. That's exactly what the defense is aboutâ€”lack of intent.

So, the defense is about the fact that the host was intoxicated and didn't have the intent to commit the crime. So the defense is successful because the crime is a specific intent one and voluntary intoxication is a partial defense.

Looking at the options, option A says yes, which is correct. So, the answer should be A.

The defense of voluntary intoxication is successful in this case because criminal battery is a specific intent crime. Voluntary intoxication can be a partial defense for specific intent crimes when the intoxication was deliberate and the defendant knew he was intoxicated. The defense is based on the fact that the defendant lacked the intent to commit the crime, even though he was drunk, and that the crime required mens rea.
