Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about group behavior. The question is about a specific type of task where group members select a solution offered by one of them, making that solution the group's solution. I need to choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I'll read the question again carefully. It says that when performing a certain task, group members choose a solution from one of the group members. So the key is that the group's solution is taken from a member's solution. That suggests a process where the group's collective decision is based on individual contributions or solutions.

I remember reading about different types of group decision-making. There's something called collective decision-making, which sounds relevant here. In collective decision-making, the group as a whole makes a decision by considering the options presented to each member. Each member might offer a solution, and the group as a whole selects the best one. This process is different from other types like distributive or integrative, which deal more with how resources are distributed or resources are integrated.

Looking at the options, option G is 'collective'. That seems to fit because collective decision-making is about the group's group decision, not individual contributions. Other options like associative or distributive don't seem to fit. For example, associative might be more about combining elements, distributive about dividing resources.

Wait, could 'collective' also refer to something else, like a group working together? That's a bit broad. But in the context of selecting a solution offered by one member, it's more about the group's choice being made by someone in the group, not necessarily a collective decision in a broader sense.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be G: collective.

The correct answer is G: collective.

The question pertains to group decision-making processes where group members select a solution from one of their own. This aligns with collective decision-making, where a group as a whole makes a decision based on individual contributions. Other options don't fit as well, leaving collective as the most suitable choice.

Answer: G
