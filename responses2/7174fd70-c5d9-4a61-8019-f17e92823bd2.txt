Okay, so Bob had some debts totaling $25,000, right? But when he went bankrupt, he only had $15,000 left to pay his creditors. Hmm, I think this means he has to pay more than his available funds. Wait, but how does that translate into "cents on the dollar"? Oh right, "cents on the dollar" is a way of expressing the amount owed in fractions of a dollar. So, for example, if you pay 65 cents on the dollar, that's $0.65.

So, the first part of the question is asking how many cents on the dollar Bob has to pay each creditor. Since he has $15,000 to distribute among his creditors, but his total debts are $25,000, I need to calculate how much each creditor gets. Wait, but the question is about how much each needs to pay. So, if he has $15,000, each creditor gets a portion of that. But the question is about how many cents on the dollar each creditor has to pay. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read again.

Wait, the question is: How many cents on the dollar does Bob have to pay each creditor? So, for each creditor, the amount he has to pay is in cents. But Bob's available is $15,000. So, I think each creditor gets that amount. So if he has to pay to each, but the question is asking how much each has to pay in cents on the dollar. So, the total available is $15,000. But wait, no, wait. Wait, the total available is $15,000 to pay all the creditors. So, each creditor gets some amount, but the question is asking how many cents on the dollar each has to pay. Wait, that doesn't make sense because it's per creditor. Unless it's implying that each creditor has to pay a certain number of cents in their claim.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking how much each creditor has to pay in cents. But the available is $15,000. So, if Bob has to pay a total of $15,000, and each creditor's claim is, say, $X, then the number of cents each has to pay is (X * 100) cents. Wait, but the question is about per creditor, so perhaps each gets a certain amount, but the question is how much each has to pay in cents on the dollar, which is the same as the amount they are owed. So, maybe each creditor is owed an amount equal to the available, which is $15,000. But that can't be right because the total available is only $15k, but his debts are $25k. So, each creditor is owed the available amount, but perhaps the question is about how much each has to pay, which is the available amount divided by the number of creditors. Wait, but the question doesn't specify the number of creditors. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options. The options give the number of cents on the dollar and the amount paid to a specific creditor. So, for example, option A is 65 cents on the dollar and $2,925. Wait, but $2,925 is 65 cents on the dollar? Wait, 65 cents on the dollar is $0.65, so 65 cents is indeed 0.65 dollars. So, if each creditor is owed 65 cents, then the total owed would be 65 cents multiplied by the number of creditors. But Bob's total available is $15,000, so 0.65 * N = 15,000 → N = 15,000 / 0.65 → N ≈23,076.92, which is about 23,077 creditors. That seems impractical, but maybe that's the case.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: How many cents on the dollar does Bob have to pay each creditor? How much money was paid to a creditor who had a claim for $4,500? So, each creditor's claim is $4,500. So, the first part is the cents per credit, the second part is the amount paid to one creditor who has a claim of $4,500.

Wait, but if the first part is about how much each has to pay in cents on the dollar, that could mean the amount per creditor. So, for each creditor, the amount is X cents, so X dollars is X /100. But the total available is $15,000, so if each creditor is owed X cents, then N * X/100 = $15,000. But without knowing N, the number of creditors, this is tricky. However, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the total amount he has to pay in addition to his debts, which is $15,000. Wait, but that would mean that he must pay $15,000 in addition, but his total debt is $25k. So, perhaps he has to pay the $15k plus the rest of his debts? But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: the problem states that he had $25k in debts. When he bankruptcy, he has $15k available. So, he has to pay the $25k but only has $15k. So, the amount he has to distribute is $15k. But the question is, per creditor, how much does he have to pay, and how much was paid to a specific creditor.

Wait, but the first part of the question is "How many cents on the dollar does Bob have to pay each creditor?" So, perhaps the amount per creditor is in cents. The second part is about a specific claim, which is $4,500. So, for the second part, the amount paid to a $4,500 claim is 4,500 dollars, but that can't be right because he only has $15k to pay, which is less than $4,500.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no. Let me think. If Bob has to pay a total amount, which is $15k, and each creditor's claim is a certain amount, then the number of creditors is 15,000 / (each claim). But again, without knowing the number of creditors, it's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit different. Maybe the total amount he has to pay in addition to his debts is $15k. But that would mean he's paying $15k, but his total debt is $25k. That doesn't make sense because he can't pay more than his available funds.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again.

"Bob had debts totaling $25,000. When he went into bankruptcy, it was found that he had only $15,000 available to pay his creditors. How many cents on the dollar does Bob have to pay each creditor? How much money was paid to a creditor who had a claim for $4,500?"

Ah, maybe the first part is how much each creditor gets, which is in cents. So, total available is $15k. So, each creditor gets X cents, and the total X * N = $15k, where N is the number of creditors. But without knowing N, we can't find X.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the amount each creditor is owed, which is in cents. So, the amount per creditor is 15,000 dollars divided by the number of creditors, which would be 15,000 / N. But without N, how can we find X?

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that each creditor is owed 65 cents, and the amount for a specific claim is 4,500. So, the first part is 65 cents per creditor. Let's check: 65 cents per creditor would mean each creditor is owed 65 cents. So, if there are N creditors, then N * 0.65 = 15,000 → N = 15,000 / 0.65 ≈ 23,076.92. So, about 23,077 creditors. That seems way too high, but possible.

But the question also asks, for a specific claim of $4,500. So, if each claim is 65 cents, then 4,500 would be 4,500 * 0.65 = $2,925. So, the second part is $2,925. Then, looking at the options, option A says 65 cents and $2,925. So, that fits.

Let me check the other options to see if any other options fit.

Wait, but let's think again. The problem is about how much each creditor is owed. So, 65 cents per claim, and for a $4,500 claim, it's 4,500 * 0.65 = 2,925. So, that would be option A.

But wait, let me think again. Is there another way? Maybe the first part is 60 cents per claim, which would require 15,000 / 0.6 = 25,000 claims. So, that's possible. But 60 cents would make 4,500 * 0.6 = 2,700, which is option H.

Alternatively, if it's 66 cents, 15,000 / 0.66 ≈22,727.27 claims. For a $4,500 claim, 4,500 * 0.66 = 2,970, which is option B.

Wait, but I'm confused because the question is about how much each creditor is owed. So, the amount per claim is the number of cents, and that's the same as the amount each gets. So, the first part is the cents per claim. So, if each claim is 65 cents, then the amount for a $4,500 claim is 4,500 * 0.65 = 2,925. So, option A is 65 cents and $2,925. That seems correct.

Alternatively, if the first part is 60 cents, then 4,500 * 0.6 = 2,700, which is option H. But 15,000 / 0.6 = 25,000 claims, so that's possible. But the question is about how much each has to pay in cents on the dollar, so 60 cents per claim. But then the total debt is $25,000, and he has only $15k available, so he has to pay 25,000 - 15,000 = $10,000 more. But that's not directly relevant to the question.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The first part is about how much each creditor has to pay in cents on the dollar. So, the amount each one gets is X cents. So, the total X * N = $15k. But without knowing N, we can't find X. So, perhaps the question is implying that each creditor is owed 65 cents, which would mean each gets 65 cents, so the total is 15,000 dollars, which would mean 15,000 / 0.65 = 23,076.92, which is approximately 23,077 creditors. So, the first part is 65 cents, and for a $4,500 claim, 4,500 * 0.65 = 2,925. So, option A.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps each creditor is owed 66 cents, which would mean 15,000 / 0.66 ≈22,727. So, for a $4,500 claim, 4,500 * 0.66 = 2,970, which is option B. So, which is correct?

Hmm, the question is about how many cents on the dollar does Bob have to pay each creditor. So, 'cents on the dollar' is the same as the amount per claim. So, if each claim is 65 cents, then the amount is 65 cents. So, the first part is 65 cents. For a $4,500 claim, that's 4,500 * 0.65 = 2,925, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total amount he has to pay in addition to his debts, but that doesn't make sense because he can't pay more than he has available.

Wait, maybe another approach: perhaps the available $15k is the amount he has to pay in addition to his debts. So, if he has debts of $25k, and can only pay $15k, then he has to cover the remaining $10k. But that's not how the question is phrased.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that he has to pay the $15k plus his debts, but that would be $40k, which is more than he can handle.

I think I've spent enough time on this. The correct answer seems to be option A: 65 cents on the dollar, $2,925.
</think>

The correct answer is option A: 65 cents on the dollar, $2,925.

**Explanation:**

Bob had $25,000 in debts but only $15,000 available upon bankruptcy. To determine how much each creditor is owed, we divide the available funds by the number of creditors. Given that the first part of the question asks for the number of cents on the dollar, each creditor is owed 65 cents. For a specific claim of $4,500, the amount paid is calculated as 4,500 * 0.65 = $2,925. This matches option A.
