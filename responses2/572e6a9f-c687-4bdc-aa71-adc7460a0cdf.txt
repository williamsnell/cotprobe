Question:

Options:

A: Johnson proposed the stages of conceptualization, experimentation, and reflection for problem solving.
B: Johnson suggested that the stages of problem solving are analysis, implementation, and feedback.
C: The stages of problem solving are production, judgment, and incubation.
D: The three stages of problem solving according to Donald M. Johnson are preparation, production, and judgment.
E: Johnson's stages of problem solving include orientation, negotiation, and verification.
F: The stages of problem solving by Johnson are defined as comprehension, application, and consolidation.
G: Johnson's model includes the stages of recognition, strategy formulation, and monitoring.
H: According to Johnson, the stages of problem solving are preparation, execution, and evaluation.
I: The problem-solving stages outlined by Johnson are identification, exploration, and resolution.
J: According to Johnson, the stages are framing the problem, finding solutions, and assessing outcomes.

Okay, so I have this question about problem solving stages proposed by Johnson. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I'll read the question again. It asks me to list and describe the stages of problem solving as proposed by Johnson. There are ten options, all A to J, each giving a different sequence of stages. I need to pick the correct one.

I remember from my studies that there are different models for problem solving, but I'm not sure which one was proposed by Donald M. Johnson. I think he's known for the three-stage model. Let me think about each option.

Option A says: Johnson proposed conceptualization, experimentation, and reflection. Hmm, I don't recall Johnson specifically mentioning these terms. I think his model was different.

Option B: Johnson suggested analysis, implementation, and feedback. That seems familiar. I believe Johnson's model was divided into three phases: analysis, implementation, and then feedback. So during analysis, you break down the problem, implement solutions, and then get feedback before moving on.

Option C: The stages are production, judgment, and incubation. No, that doesn't sound right. I don't think that's Johnson's model.

Option D: According to Johnson, the stages are preparation, production, and judgment. Wait, that sounds like three phases without the reflection part. Or maybe I'm getting confused with another researcher. I thought Johnson's model had three main phases, but maybe this is another model.

Option E: Orientation, negotiation, and verification. That rings a bell, but I'm not sure if that's Johnson's. I think another person proposed something like this, maybe Tuckman.

Option F: Comprehension, application, and consolidation. No, that doesn't fit. I think Johnson's model was more about phases, not these terms.

Option G: Recognition, strategy formulation, and monitoring. I'm not sure about this. I think Johnson's model might have been different.

Option H: Preparation, execution, and evaluation. That sounds closer, but I'm not sure if that's his model.

Option I: Identification, exploration, and resolution. No, that's another model, perhaps the one by Tuckman or others.

Option J: Framing the problem, finding solutions, and assessing outcomes. That seems familiar. I think this is Johnson's model. Fittingly, the stages are Identification (framing the problem), Exploration (finding solutions), and Resolution (assessing outcomes).

Wait, but I should verify. I remember that Johnson's model had three main phases: analysis, implementation, and feedback. Oh wait, no, another thoughtâ€”no, Johnson's model was actually called the "three-stage model" and it's more like identification, exploration, and resolution. Alternatively, another version by Tuckman had identification, implementation, and evaluation.

Wait, let me think again. There's a model by Johnson called the "three-stage model" which includes analysis, implementation, and feedback. So the stages would be: analysis, implementation, feedback. Let me check the options.

Looking again at the options, option B says: analysis, implementation, and feedback. That matches. So option B seems correct.

Wait, but another thought: I thought Johnson's model had three phases: recognition, strategy formulation, and monitoring. Or was it the other way around? Or maybe it's "preparation, execution, evaluation" as in option I. No, that doesn't fit. Or is it different.

Wait, another approach: let me think of what each option says. Option J says "Framing the problem, finding solutions, and assessing outcomes." That seems to match Johnson's model. Because I've read that Johnson's model started with the problem being framed, then solutions found, and then outcomes assessed.

Alternatively, another model I remember is Tuckman's, which has four phases: identification, implementation, evaluation, and change. But that's not any of the options here.

So, looking back at the options:

A) Conceptualization, experimentation, reflection. I don't think that's Johnson.

B) Analysis, implementation, feedback. That's Johnson's model.

C) Production, judgment, incubation. No.

D) Preparation, production, judgment. Maybe another model.

E) Orientation, negotiation, verification. Not Johnson.

F) Comprehension, application, consolidation. Not.

G) Recognition, strategy formulation, monitoring. Maybe, but I'm not sure.

H) Preparation, execution, evaluation. No, I think that's another model.

J) Framing the problem, finding solutions, assessing outcomes. So this is option J.

Wait, but another thought: the three-stage model is sometimes called the Johnson's model, which is Analysis, Implementation, and Feedback. So that would correspond to option B.

Alternatively, I've heard that another model, proposed by Tuckman, has four phases. But none of the options seem to align with that. So the four-phase model isn't an option here.

Wait, but the options list only ten, so the likely correct answer is option J, or B.

Wait, the options are:

Option J: Framing the problem, finding solutions, and assessing outcomes.

Option B: Analysis, implementation, feedback.

I think I'm getting confused. Let me think about the stages again.

Johnson's model, I believe, includes three phases: analysis, implementation, and feedback. So the stages are A, B, F (if F is analysis, implementation, feedback). So option B is correct.

Alternatively, I've read that Johnson's model is:

1. Analysis: break down the problem.

2. Implementation: find solutions.

3. Feedback: evaluate and adjust.

That's option B's description: "Johnson suggested that the stages of problem solving are analysis, implementation, and feedback."

So the correct answer is option B.
</think>

The correct answer is **Option B: Johnson suggested that the stages of problem solving are analysis, implementation, and feedback.**

**Explanation:**
Johnson's model for problem solving consists of three phases: analysis, implementation, and feedback. This aligns with the description provided in option B. The other options either describe different models or incorrect sequences, so option B is the correct choice.
