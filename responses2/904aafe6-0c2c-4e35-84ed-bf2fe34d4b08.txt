Question:

To determine the average cost of running for a congressional seat, a simple random sample of 50 politicians is chosen and the politicians' records examined. The cost figures show a mean of $125,000 with a standard deviation of $32,000. Which of the following is the best interpretation of a 90% confidence interval estimate for the average cost of running for office?

Options:

A: We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend between $117,500 and $132,500.
B: 90% of politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount that is between $117,500 and $132,500.
C: 90% of politicians running for a congressional seat spend a total dollar amount that is between $117,500 and $132,500.
D: 90% of politicians running for a congressional seat spend between $117,500 and $132,500.
E: We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend a maximum dollar amount that is between $117,500 and $132,500.
F: We are 90% confident that the standard deviation of the cost of running for a congressional seat is between $117,500 and $132,500.
G: We are 90% confident that the median cost of running for a congressional seat is between $117,500 and $132,500.
H: We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount between $117,500 and $132,500.
I: We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend a minimum dollar amount that is between $117,500 and $132,500.
J: 90% of politicians running for a congressional seat spend a median dollar amount that is between $117,500 and $132,500.

Okay, so I've got this statistics question here about confidence intervals. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about determining the average cost of running for a congressional seat. They took a sample of 50 politicians, calculated the mean as $125,000, and the standard deviation as $32,000. We need to interpret a 90% confidence interval for the average cost.

Hmm, first, I remember that a confidence interval gives an estimated range of values which is likely to include the true population parameter, in this case, the average cost. But what exactly is the 90% confidence here about?

Let me recall: A 90% confidence interval means that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times, 90% of the calculated intervals would contain the true population mean. So, for this scenario, the interval we're talking about is the range we're confident contains the true average cost of running for a congressional seat.

Looking at the options, let's see what each one is saying.

Option A: We are 90% confident that politicians spend between $117,500 and $132,500. Wait, that wording is a bit off. The wording says "politicians" not "politicians' records." Also, it says "between" the amounts, but the options don't specify about the mean. Wait, no, the wording says "politicians running for a congressional seat spend," so it's talking about the average. So maybe A is incorrect because it's not the mean but the politicians themselves.

Option B: 90% of politicians spend a mean dollar amount between $117,500 and $132,500. That sounds similar. But wait, the wording is a bit confusing. I think this is correct because it's about the mean. But wait, the wording in B says "90% of politicians" which is a population, not a sample. So I'm not sure if that's right. Wait, no, the confidence interval is about the parameter (the mean), not about the population. Oh, but the options are about the interpretation of the confidence interval, not about the population.

Wait, the question is about the average cost of running for office. So the 90% confidence interval is about the mean, not the population. So option B is correct in that it's about the mean, but phrased as "90% of politicians" seems a bit off. Or wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the options again.

Option B: 90% of politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount that's between those numbers. Wait, that would mean that 90% of the politicians have a mean between $117k and $132k. That seems backwards. I think this option is incorrect. Because the confidence interval is about the average, not the proportion of the population that has that average.

Option C: 90% of politicians spend a total dollar amount between $117k and $132k. That doesn't make sense. The confidence interval is about the average, not the total amount. Also, it's talking about total, which is the sum, not the mean.

Option D: 90% of politicians spend between $117k and $132k. Again, this is talking about the population, not the sample. Because it says " politicians," not "sample of politicians." Plus, the wording is about the dollar amount, but this option is about the population, which isn't the case. So D is incorrect.

Option E: 90% confident that politicians spend a maximum between those amounts. No, the confidence interval is about the average, not the maximum. So E is wrong.

Option F: 90% confident that standard deviation is between those amounts. No, the question is about the average. So F is wrong.

Option G: 90% confident the median is between those. Again, the confidence is about the average, not the median. So G is incorrect.

Option H: 90% confident the mean dollar amount is between those. That sounds right. It's about the average, not the median or total. So H is correct.

Option I: 90% confident that politicians spend a minimum amount between those. No, the confidence is about the average, so I is wrong.

Option J: 90% confident that the median is between those. No, same as before, it's the mean.

So the only options that talk about the mean are A and H. Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, option A says "politicians spend a mean dollar amount," but the wording is "politicians running for a congressional seat spend between..." So perhaps that's a misuse of the term. The correct interpretation is about the average of the population. So A is incorrect because it's not the mean but the politicians themselves.

So option H is correct: 90% confidence that the average cost is between $117,500 and $132,500.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me check the calculation of the confidence interval to confirm.

Wait, the formula for the confidence interval for the mean is: sample mean ± (critical value * (standard deviation / sqrt(n))).

The sample mean is $125k, standard deviation is $32k, n is 50.

So the standard error (SE) is 32k / sqrt(50). Let's calculate that.

sqrt(50) is approximately 7.07. So 32,000 /7.07 ≈ 4532. So SE ≈ $4,532.

The critical value for a 90% confidence interval is about 1.645 (since it's a z-score for two-tailed 90% confidence, which is 0.95 in each tail; no, wait, for 90% confidence, the z-score is 1.645 because it's the upper 5% in a z-table. Wait, actually, let me think: For a 90% confidence interval, the confidence level is 90%, so the alpha is 0.10, and we split it into two tails, each 0.05. So the z-score is z=1.645 for the upper tail.

So the margin of error (ME) is 1.645 * 4532 ≈ 7453. So the confidence interval is 125k ±7,453, which is $117,547 to $132,457 approximately. So the options given are 117,500 and 132,500. So the interval is about that range.

So the 90% confidence interval is between ~$117,500 and $132,500.

Looking back at the options, option H says 90% confident that the mean dollar amount is between these numbers. That's correct.

But wait, I thought the wording in option A was incorrect because it refers to the politicians themselves, not the politicians' records. Because the mean is for the entire population, which the confidence interval is about. So option A is wrong.

So the correct answer is option H.
</think>

The correct interpretation of a 90% confidence interval for the average cost is that it provides a range within which we are 90% confident the true average lies. This interval is calculated as $125,000 ± 1.645*(32,000/√50), resulting in a range of approximately $117,500 to $132,500. Therefore, the best interpretation is that we are 90% confident that the mean dollar amount for running for office is between these amounts.
