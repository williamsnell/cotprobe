Okay, so I've got this question about partial pressures in a gas mixture. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that when gases are mixed, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas. Oh wait, right! It's Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures. So each gas contributes its own partial pressure to the total.

The question gives the total pressure as 2.0 atm. And there are three gases: nitrogen, argon, and water vapor. I need to find the partial pressure of nitrogen. 

Wait, but how do I find the partial pressure of each gas? Oh, right! Each partial pressure is calculated by using the mole fraction of that gas multiplied by the total pressure. So, partial pressure of a gas = (moles of that gas / total moles of all gases) * total pressure.

So the steps are: find moles of each gas, add them up to get total moles, then divide moles of nitrogen by total moles and multiply by 2.0 atm.

Let me list the data:

Nitrogen: 28.0 g. Argon: 40.0 g. Water vapor: 36.0 g.

I need the molar masses. Nitrogen (N2) has a molar mass of about 28.014 g/mol. So 28.0 g would be 28.0 / 28.014 ≈ 0.999 mol, which I can approximate to 1.00 mol for simplicity.

Argon (Ar) has a molar mass of about 39.948 g/mol. So 40.0 g divided by that is roughly 1.00 mol.

Wait, let me calculate precisely.

Nitrogen: 28.0 g / 28.014 g/mol ≈ 0.999 mol → 1.0 mol approximately.

Argon: 40.0 g / 39.948 g/mol ≈ 1.001 mol → about 1.0 mol.

Water vapor: H2O. Molar mass is 18.015 g/mol. So 36.0 g divided by 18.015 is approximately 1.998 mol → about 2.00 mol.

Wait, no. Let me check each more accurately.

Nitrogen: 28.0 g / 28.014 g/mol = 28.0 / 28.014 = approximately 0.999 mol. Let's say approximately 1.0 mol.

Argon: 40.0 / 39.948 = 40.0 / 39.948. Let me calculate that. 40 / 39.948 ≈ 1.0014 mol. So about 1.0014 mol.

Water vapor: 36.0 g / 18.015 g/mol = 36 / 18.015 ≈ 1.998 mol. Approximately 2.000 mol.

So total moles = 1.0 (N) + 1.0014 (Ar) + 2.000 (H2O) = approx 4.0014 mol.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the sum is 1 + 1.0014 +1.998 = 4.00 approximately. So about 4.00 mol. So total pressure is 2.0 atm.

The mole fraction of nitrogen is moles of N divided by total. So 1.0 / 4.00 = 0.25. So the partial pressure would be 0.25 * 2.0 atm = 0.50 atm.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Nitrogen: 28.0 g / 28.014 g/mol → 28.0 / 28.014 is approximately 28.0 ÷ 28 = 1. But 28.014 is just a little over 28, so 28 / 28.014 ≈ 0.999 mol. So 1.0 mol.

Argon: 40.0 / 39.948 → 40 / 39.948 is approximately 1.0014 mol.

Water: 36.0 / 18.015 → 2.000 mol.

Add them: 1 + 1.0014 + 2 = 4.0014 mol.

So mole fraction of N: 1 / (4.0014) ≈ 0.25.

So partial pressure of N is 0.25 * 2.0 atm = 0.50 atm.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.50 atm. So the answer should be B.

To determine the partial pressure of nitrogen in the gas mixture, we use Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures, which states that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of all constituent gases. The partial pressure of a gas is calculated as:

\[
P_{\text{partial, gas}} = \left( \frac{\text{moles of gas}}{\text{total moles of all gases}} \right) \times P_{\text{total}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each gas
- **Nitrogen (N₂):** Molar mass = 28.014 g/mol  
  Moles of N₂ = \(\frac{28.0 \, \text{g}}{28.014 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 1.00 \, \text{mol}\)

- **Argon (Ar):** Molar mass = 39.948 g/mol  
  Moles of Ar = \(\frac{40.0 \, \text{g}}{39.948 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 1.00 \, \text{mol}\)

- **Water vapor:** Molar mass = 18.015 g/mol  
  Moles of H₂O = \(\frac{36.0 \, \text{g}}{18.015 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 1.998 \, \text{mol} \approx 2.00 \, \text{mol}\)

### Step 2: Calculate total moles
\[
\text{Total moles} = 1.00 \, (\text{N}) + 1.00 \, (\text{Ar}) + 2.00 \, (\text{H₂O}) = 4.00 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate mole fraction of nitrogen
\[
\text{Mole fraction of N} = \frac{\text{moles of N}}{\text{total moles}} = \frac{1.00}{4.00} = 0.25
\]

### Step 4: Calculate partial pressure of nitrogen
\[
P_{\text{partial, N}} = \text{mole fraction of N} \times P_{\text{total}} = 0.25 \times 2.0 \, \text{atm} = 0.50 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Final Answer
The partial pressure of nitrogen is **0.50 atm**, which corresponds to option **B**.
