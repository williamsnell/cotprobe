Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Parfit's work on pain and its sources. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about what Parfit says about the sources of pain. The options are A through J, each making a different claim about how pain is caused or experienced.

From what I remember, Parfit's work is about the nature of pain and how it's not just a physical sensation but something more profound. He's known for the Parfit's two puzzles about pain: the first is that pain is not caused by anything physical (like gravity or something), and the second is the possibility that pain might be caused by a single event causing the same pain to others.

Wait, I think about his analysis. He divides pain into two parts: the first is the physical pain (like the intensity of the hurt), and the second is the emotional or psychological aspect, which he attributes to the source of the pain. So I believe Parfit distinguishes between physical pain and subjective pain (perceived intensity).

Looking at the options, option B says "only felt by multiple people at different times." That sounds familiar. Parfit's analysis suggests that pain can be caused by multiple people at different times, but it's not the same as feeling pain by a single person. So if a pain is felt by someone, but different people, that wouldn't fit B. 

Option A says "all be avoidable." I'm not sure about this. Parfit's idea about pain and avoidability might suggest that for pain to be avoidable, certain conditions must hold. But I'm not certain how this relates to B. Maybe it's about whether pain can be avoided, but I'm not sure how that's addressed in this question.

Option C: "all be experienced in the same way." Parfit's theory has two parts. The first is that pain is not physical (so it's not caused by a physical event), and the second is that it's not caused by a single event affecting all people. So C might not be correct because he believes pain is caused by multiple people, but perhaps they might experience it differently.

Option D: "all be of the same intensity." Again, Parfit says pain is not about intensity but about the source. So D doesn't seem right.

Option E: "all felt by a single person." That can't be right because Parfit's theory is that pain isn't caused by a single event affecting everyone. So E is incorrect.

Option F: "all be caused by a single source." No, Parfit thinks pain is caused by multiple sources for different people. So F is not correct.

Option G: "all be caused by multiple sources." That sounds right because Parfit's view is that pain arises from multiple sources, not a single one affecting everyone.

Option H: "all be caused by a single event." No, Parfit's second puzzle is that pain can't be caused by a single event affecting all people. So H is incorrect.

Option I: "all felt at a single time." Parfit's analysis doesn't support that idea. He's more about the source, not the time of feeling.

Option J: "all of the above." Hmm, let's see. So if B is correct, then J is correct because B is one of the options. But wait, the question is about what Parfit says about pain's sources. 

Wait, let me clarify. The first part of Parfit's analysis is about pain being physical and not caused by a single event. The second part is about pain being caused by multiple people at different times. So for option B, Parfit's view is that pain is only felt by multiple people at different times. So option B is correct. 

But the question is about what Parfit assumes about pain. The options are about what he says. So the question is, which of these are correct. The question is a bit ambiguous, but I think the question is asking what Parfit says about the nature of pain. 

Wait, the question is phrased as: "According to Parfit, both Taurek and Lewis assume that for there to be a 'sum of pain,' it must be: ..."

Wait, no, the question is about the sum of pain. Oh wait, the question says: "both Taurek and Lewis assume that for there to be a 'sum of pain,' it must be..." So the options are about what must be true for the sum of pain to exist.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again. Oh, no, wait, the question isn't about Taurek and Lewis's assumption about the sum of pain. The question is about what Parfit says about the sources of pain. So the options are about what Parfit claims about the nature of pain based on his work.

Let me think again. The question is asking about Parfit's view on pain. So the options are about what he claims must be true about pain.

So Parfit's analysis is that pain is not caused by a single event (so H and I are incorrect). Also, he doesn't think that pain is 'sum of pain' but that it's caused by multiple sources for different people. So for the sum of pain to exist, it must be that pain is caused by multiple sources. 

Wait, but the options are about what must be true for the sum of pain to exist. So if the sum of pain is the sum across different people, then Parfit's view (G) would be correct, that pain is caused by multiple sources. 

Wait, but the original question is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

The question is: According to Parfit, both Taurek and Lewis assume that for there to be a "sum of pain," it must be:
Options: A to J.

Ah, this is the crux. I think the question is about Parfit's view on the sum of pain. So, according to Parfit, what must be true for a sum of pain to exist?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what each option implies. Parfit's theory is that pain is not physical and that it's not caused by a single event. He says pain can be experienced by multiple people at different times and that it's not caused by a single event affecting all people.

So for the sum of pain to exist, perhaps it's about the sources. 

Wait, but the options are about what must be true for the sum of pain to exist. So if the sum of pain is the combination of multiple pain sources, then for this to exist, each pain source must be separate (i.e., from different people), and each must be caused by different sources (not a single one). 

So Parfit's view is that pain is not caused by a single source, so each pain is from multiple sources. So the sum must involve multiple sources.

Therefore, option G: all be caused by multiple sources. So that would be correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is whether all are caused by multiple sources. So for the sum, each pain must be caused by multiple sources. But does Parfit say that each pain is caused by multiple sources?

I think yes. So for the sum of pain to exist, each pain must be caused by multiple sources. So that would be G.

But wait, wait. The question is about what Parfit says. Let's consider each option.

Option B: only felt by multiple people at different times. I'm not sure if this is part of what Parfit claims. From what I remember, Parfit's view is that pain is not a single event but caused by multiple people at different times, but he doesn't make a universal statement about the sum of pain. Or is it?

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the sum of pain, which is the combination of multiple pain sources. If that's the case, then for such a sum to exist, it must be that each component (each pain) is caused by multiple sources.

So Parfit's view is that pain is not caused by a single source, so each pain must be from multiple sources. So the sum of pain would require multiple sources for each component.

So for the sum of pain to exist, each pain must be caused by multiple sources, so option G is correct.

Wait, but the options are about what Parfit assumes. So the question is about what Parfit says about the sources of pain. If that's the case, the options are about the conditions on pain's sources.

So let's recap.

Parfit's view:

1. Pain is not physical (so it's not caused by a single physical event).
2. Pain is not caused by a single source affecting all people (so it's not a single event causing pain at multiple times based on a single source for all people).

So for the sum of pain to exist, each pain must be from multiple sources. So each pain is caused by multiple people at different times, and each pain is not caused by a single event affecting all people.

So for the sum of pain, Parfit would say that each piece of pain is caused by multiple sources (so each component is multiple source), and that each piece is caused by different sources.

So for the sum of pain (which is the combination of several pain experiences), each individual pain must be from multiple sources, so each pain is from multiple people at different times.

Wait, but the question is about what Parfit says about "for there to be a 'sum of pain' it must be," so perhaps he says that for the sum to exist, each pain is caused by multiple sources and each pain is only felt by multiple people.

Wait, no, I think the question is about what must be true for the sum of pain to exist. That is, the conditions under which a sum of pain exists.

Therefore, Parfit's view is that pain is not caused by a single source, so each pain is caused by multiple sources. Thus, the sum must involve multiple sources.

Therefore, option G: all be caused by multiple sources. So that would be correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is whether all are caused by multiple sources. So for the sum, each component must be caused by multiple sources. But does Parfit say that each pain is caused by multiple sources?

I think yes. So for the sum of pain to exist, each pain must be caused by multiple sources.

So based on this, option G is correct.

Wait, but another possibility is that option B is correct. Because the first part of Parfit's view is that pain is not physical, so it's not caused by a single event. The second is that it's not caused by a single source affecting all people.

So for a sum of pain to exist, each pain must be caused by multiple sources, and each must be felt by different people.

So Parfit would say that for the sum of pain to exist, each pain must be caused by multiple sources, and each must be felt by multiple people.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let's look at the options again.

The options are:

A: all avoidable.

B: only felt by multiple people at different times.

C: all same way.

D: all same intensity.

E: all felt at single time.

F: all caused by single source.

G: all caused by multiple sources.

H: all caused by single event.

I: all felt at single time.

J: all of the above.

The question is asking what Parfit says about the sources of pain. So the options are about the nature of pain's sources.

Wait, but the question is a bit unclear. The question is: according to Parfit, both Taurek and Lewis assume that for there to be a 'sum of pain,' it must be:

So it's about what they assume about the sum of pain. So for the sum to exist, what must be true.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the sum of pain as in each pain's source. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for Parfit's main points. 

Parfit's work on pain has two main puzzles. The first is that pain isn't physical—so it doesn't require a physical cause. The second is that pain can't be caused by a single event affecting everyone. So for the sum of pain (which is the combination of multiple pain instances), each pain instance must be caused by multiple sources, and each must be felt by multiple people.

So for the sum of pain to exist, each pain must be caused by multiple sources, and each must be felt by multiple people. So each component of the sum is a pain that's from multiple sources.

Therefore, Parfit's view implies that for a sum of pain to exist, each pain must be caused by multiple sources. So option G holds.

But looking at the options, option G says "all be caused by multiple sources." So this must be correct.

But wait, let's check option B again. It says "only felt by multiple people at different times." That's a part of Parfit's view, perhaps. He says that pain is only felt by multiple people, and that each pain is felt at different times.

So for the sum of pain, each component must be felt by multiple people at different times. So option B is a part of what Parfit claims, but the question is about the sum of pain, so I think option B isn't the answer.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "for there to be a 'sum of pain,' it must be: [options]." So perhaps the options are about the conditions that must hold for the sum to exist. So the sum would require that each pain is caused by multiple sources (so option G is correct) and that each pain is only felt by multiple people (so option B is also correct). But that's not possible because only one option can be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about what Parfit's analysis suggests about the sum of pain. So according to Parfit, the sum of pain is possible only if each part is caused by multiple sources. So the answer is G.

Another way: the question is about what Parfit says about the sum of pain. Parfit's view is that pain is not caused by a single event, so the sum of pain must involve multiple causes. So each component is from multiple sources, and each is felt by multiple people. So for the sum to exist, each pain must be caused by multiple sources.

Therefore, the correct answer is G: all be caused by multiple sources.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, we analyze Parfit's views on pain and its sources. Parfit's work, particularly "The Two Puzzles of Pain," posits that pain cannot be caused by a single event affecting all people simultaneously. Pain is neither physical nor arises from a single source affecting everyone at different times.

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: All avoidable.**  
   Parfit's view does not suggest that pain is avoidable. Instead, he argues that pain is not physical and that it is not caused by a single event affecting all people. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B: Only felt by multiple people at different times.**  
   Parfit's analysis includes the idea that pain is only felt by multiple people at different times, but this is more about the nature of pain than a condition for the sum of pain to exist. Hence, this is not the correct answer to the question about the sum of pain.

3. **Option C: All same way.**  
   Parfit does not claim that pain is caused by a single event or that it is experienced in the same way. His view focuses on the distinct sources of pain for different people. This option is incorrect.

4. **Option D: All same intensity.**  
   Parfit distinguishes between physical pain (intensity) and subjective pain (perceived intensity). There is no claim that all pain experiences have the same intensity. Thus, this is incorrect.

5. **Option E: All felt at a single time.**  
   Parfit's analysis does not support the idea that pain is felt at a single time. His view is about distinct sources of pain for different people. This is incorrect.

6. **Option F: All caused by a single source.**  
   Parfit argues that pain is not caused by a single source affecting all people. This directly contradicts this option, making it incorrect.

7. **Option G: All be caused by multiple sources.**  
   This aligns with Parfit's second puzzle, where pain is not caused by a single event affecting all people. For the sum of pain to exist, each component must be caused by multiple sources, making this the correct answer.

8. **Option H: All caused by a single event.**  
   This directly contradicts Parfit's analysis, which avoids the idea of a single event affecting all people. Incorrect.

9. **Option I: All felt at a single time.**  
   This contradicts Parfit's analysis of distinct sources of pain for different people. Incorrect.

10. **Option J: All of the above.**  
    Since option G is correct, option J cannot be the answer.

### Conclusion:
Parfit's analysis indicates that for the sum of pain to exist, each component must be caused by multiple sources. Therefore, the correct answer is:
