Alright, so I've got this problem about fluid dynamics in a pipe. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the problem is about a pipe narrowing from a larger diameter to a smaller one, and we're given some initial conditions that we need to apply the continuity equation and maybe the Bernoulli equation to find the new pressure, velocity, density, and temperature.

Let me jot down the details. The pipe's diameter narrows from 1.1 ft to 0.8 ft. The mass flow rate is 6.1 slugs per second. The initial pressure is 110 psig, and the initial temperature is 75°F. The options are A to J, each with different values for pressure, velocity, density, and temperature.

First, I remember that the continuity equation, which deals with the conservation of mass, says that the mass flow rate remains constant. Since the density might change, the velocity must adjust accordingly. The equation is:

A1 * v1 = A2 * v2

Where A is the cross-sectional area, and v is velocity. The areas are calculated using the diameters. Since the area is proportional to the square of the diameter, I can write the area ratio as (d1/d2)^2.

Wait, the diameters are 1.1 ft and 0.8 ft. So d1 is 1.1, d2 is 0.8. So the ratio d1/d2 is 1.1 / 0.8 = 1.375. So the area ratio A1/A2 is (1.375)^2. Let me calculate that. 1.375 squared is 1.890625. So A1 is 1.890625 times A2.

So from the continuity equation, v1 = (A1/A2) * v2. That is, v2 = v1 / (1.890625) ≈ 0.529 * v1.

But wait, I don't have v1, so I need another approach. Maybe I should use the Bernoulli equation, which relates pressure, velocity, and elevation. But since the pipe is a steady flow, assuming no elevation change (assuming it's horizontal), the Bernoulli equation simplifies. Oh, but wait, Bernoulli applies in situations where the fluid is incompressible, which it probably is here.

The Bernoulli equation is: 

P1 + 0.5 * rho1 * v1^2 + rho1 * g * h1 = P2 + 0.5 * rho2 * v2^2 + rho2 * g * h2

Assuming h1 = h2 (same elevation), and the density of the fluid is the same—wait, but wait, the fluid is air, which is nearly incompressible, but actually, given the pressure ranges, maybe it's treated as incompressible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes the density changes, so maybe we should consider the incompressible approximation.

But wait, when the pipe narrows, the density might change because the pressure changes. So maybe I should think about the incompressible flow, but if the fluid is air, which is considered incompressible, then the density might not change. Hmm, but this might complicate things because the density might not be constant, but perhaps the problem expects us to treat the air as incompressible and use the continuity equation and Bernoulli's equation with the same density.

Wait, but the density would change due to the change in velocity and pressure, so maybe the Bernoulli approach isn't directly applicable, but perhaps the problem is set up to use the incompressible flow assumption, and just use the area and velocity ratio to find v2, and then find the pressure and density accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe I should assume that the density is constant, which is the incompressible assumption. So if that's the case, then the mass flow rate is constant, so rho1 * A1 * v1 = rho2 * A2 * v2. But since rho is constant (since it's incompressible), A1 v1 = A2 v2. So v2 = (A1/A2) * v1.

Wait, but I don't know v1. So perhaps I can find v1 using some other approach. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the pressure changes as the pipe narrows, so the Bernoulli equation will relate P1, P2, v1, v2, and the densities.

Wait, but without knowing the densities, this seems tricky. Alternatively, maybe I should assume that the density doesn't change, which is the incompressible assumption, allowing me to use the continuity equation directly.

Wait, but in reality, when the pipe narrows, the velocity increases, and if the fluid is incompressible, the density remains the same. But in this problem, perhaps the density is changing because the pressure is changing. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the change in density because the pipe is narrowing and the flow is ideal, but I think that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the incompressible assumption and use the continuity equation, and then apply Bernoulli's equation.

Let me proceed under the assumption that the fluid is incompressible. So, rho is constant. So, from the continuity equation: A1 v1 = A2 v2.

So, v2 = (A1/A2) * v1.

But I don't know v1 yet. Wait, but perhaps I can get the density from the initial conditions. The initial pressure is given as 110 psig. At 75°F, so I can use the ideal gas law to find the density, assuming air behaves as an ideal gas.

Wait, but the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Alternatively, for density, rho = P/(RT), assuming R is the specific gas constant. For air, R is about 53.35 ft·lbf/(slug·°R). Wait, but wait, I should check the units.

Wait, the pressure is given in psig. So 110 psig is 110 + 14.7 = 124.7 psia (since atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia). So P1 = 124.7 psia.

The temperature is 75°F. The ideal gas law in terms of density (rho) is rho = P/(R * T). But I need to make sure about the units.

R for air is 53.35 ft·lbf/(slug·°R). So let me compute rho1 = P1 / (R * T1).

Wait, but T1 is in °R. Alternatively, I can convert the temperature to °F and use the ideal gas law in some form.

Wait, so let me compute rho1 first.

P1 = 124.7 psia.

R_air = 53.35 ft·lbf/(slug·°R).

T1 = 75°F. So in °R, that's 75 + 459.67 = 534.67 °R.

So rho1 = 124.7 / (53.35 * 534.67) [slug/ft^3]

Wait, let me compute denominator: 53.35 * 534.67 = around 53.35 * 500 is 26675, 53.35 * 34.67 is approx 53.35 *35 ≈ 1867. So total around 26675 +1867= 28542. So 124.7 / 28542 ≈ 0.00438 slug/ft^3.

Wait, but wait, that's a very low density. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in unit calculations. Let me think again.

Wait, the units for R are in (ft·lbf)/(slug·°R), so when you take P (in lbf/ft^2) divided by R (ft·lbf/(slug·°R)) * T (°R), you get [lbf/ft^2] / [ (ft·lbf)/(slug·°R) ) * °R ] )= [ (slug/ft^3) ] because ft^2 * slug / (ft * lbf ) * °R * (ft·lbf/°R) ) = (slug)/ft^3.

So rho1 = 124.7 / (53.35 * 534.67) slug/ft^3.

Calculate denominator: 53.35 * 534.67 ≈ 53.35 * 500 = 26675, 53.35 * 34.67 ≈ 53.3 * 34 ≈ 1812.2, so total ≈ 26675+1812=28487.

So rho1 ≈ 124.7 / 28487 ≈ approx 0.00438 slug/ft^3.

Wait, that's correct? Because at 75°F, which is 534.67°R, a pressure of 124.7 psia would give a low density.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think, at 70°F (543.67°R), air density is about 0.0171 slug/ft^3, which is close to my calculation. So 0.00438 is lower than that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the given pressure. Wait, the problem says 110 psig. So 110 psig is 110 + 14.7 = 124.7 psia.

Wait, but then, maybe that's correct. So rho1 is 0.00438 slug/ft^3.

Wait, but then, since the fluid is incompressible, and the mass flow rate is constant, rho1 * A1 * v1 = rho2 * A2 * v2.

But if rho is constant, then A1 v1 = A2 v2. So v2 = (A1/A2) * v1.

Wait, but then I don't know v1. So I need another equation. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Bernoulli equation. Since the pipe is horizontal, the change in height (h) is zero.

So Bernoulli equation simplifies to:

P1 + 0.5 rho (v1^2 + g h1) = P2 + 0.5 rho (v2^2 + g h2)

But since h1 = h2 (same elevation), and assuming no elevation difference, the equation becomes:

P1 + 0.5 rho v1^2 = P2 + 0.5 rho v2^2

Then, P2 = P1 + 0.5 rho (v1^2 - v2^2)

But wait, but I don't know v1. Hmm, perhaps I can find v1 in terms of the mass flow rate.

The mass flow rate is given by m_dot = rho1 * A1 * v1.

Wait, but if rho is constant, then m_dot = rho * A1 v1 = rho * A2 v2.

Wait, but perhaps I can find v1 from the mass flow rate.

The mass flow rate is 6.1 slugs/s.

So v1 = m_dot / (rho * A1 )

But A1 is the area at the first section, which is (pi d1^2)/4.

d1 is 1.1 ft, so A1 = π*(1.1)^2 /4 ≈ (3.45575)/4 ≈ 0.8639 ft^2.

So v1 = 6.1 / (0.00438 * 0.8639 )

Wait, let me compute denominator: 0.00438 * 0.8639 ≈ 0.003789 slug·ft/s².

So v1 = 6.1 / 0.003789 ≈ 1606 ft/s.

Wait, that seems quite high. Is that possible? Well, in real life, air at 75°F can have a velocity of around 1600 ft/s? Hmm, maybe that's too high, but let's proceed.

So v1 ≈ 1606 ft/s.

Now, v2 = (A1 / A2) * v1 = (1.890625) * 1606 ≈ 1.890625 * 1606 ≈ around 3035 ft/s.

Wait, that's a huge velocity increase. That can't be right. Because in reality, the velocity can't increase that much when the pipe narrows. Maybe I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, let's recheck the area ratio. A1 = π d1² /4, A2 = π d2² /4, so A1/A2 = (d1/d2)^2. So d1=1.1, d2=0.8, so ratio is 1.1/0.8 = 1.375. Squared is 1.890625. So correct.

Then, v2 = 1.890625 * v1.

Wait, but v1 is 1606 ft/s, which would make v2 about 3035 ft/s. That seems high, but perhaps possible for a narrow section in a wind tunnel or similar.

But let me check the calculation again.

v1 = m_dot/(rho * A1)

m_dot = 6.1 slugs/s.

rho is 0.00438 slug/ft^3.

A1 is (pi*(1.1)^2)/4 ≈ (3.45575)/4 ≈ 0.8639 ft².

So rho * A1 = 0.00438 * 0.8639 ≈ 0.003789 slug·ft/s².

v1 = 6.1 / 0.003789 ≈ let's compute: 6.1 ÷ 0.003789.

Well, 0.003789 is approximately 3.789e-3.

So 6.1 / 0.003789 ≈ 6.1 * (1/0.003789) ≈ 6.1 * 264 ≈ 1608 ft/s.

Hmm, that seems correct. So v1 is about 1608 ft/s, and v2 is 1.8906 * 1608 ≈ 3035 ft/s.

But that's an extremely high velocity. Let me think again. Is the approach correct? I assumed the same density due to incompressible flow, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the densities change, which complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using Bernoulli and the continuity equation together, without assuming incompressibility.

Wait, the density isn't constant because the pressure changes. So the density at the smaller section (rho2) is different from rho1. So perhaps I need to use the ideal gas law to find the densities at both points.

Wait, that's a crucial point. If the fluid is air, which is treated as an ideal gas, then the density is given by rho = P/(R*T) for each section. So, perhaps I can compute rho1 and rho2 using the initial pressure and temperature, and then use the continuity equation to relate the velocities.

So let's try that approach.

First, compute rho1 using P1, T1.

P1 is 124.7 psia.

T1 is 75°F, which is 534.67 °R.

R for air is 53.35 ft·lbf/(slug·°R).

So rho1 = P1 * (144) / (R * T1) ?

Wait, because 144 psia equals 14.7 psia + 144 = 158.7 psia? Wait, no. Wait, 144 psia is 124.7 psia (since 14.7 +110 = 124.7). So to convert psia to lbf, multiply by 144.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of SI units for some steps, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me re-express rho in terms of P and T. Using the ideal gas law, rho = P/(R*T). So for each section, we can compute rho1 and rho2.

So let's compute rho1 at the initial condition:

rho1 = P1 (in psia) / ( R (ft·lbf/(slug·°R)) * T1 (°R) ) * (144) because 1 psia = 144 psia/psi.

Wait, perhaps I should compute rho1 in (slug/ft^3) and then convert to (slug/ft^3) as needed.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the densities using the given pressures and temperatures.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Use the ideal gas law to compute the densities at the two sections.

So rho1 = P1/( R * T1 )

But wait, P1 is in psia, so in lbf/ft², so when you divide by R (in ft·lbf/(slug·°R)), you get (lbf/ft^2) / (ft·lbf/(slug·°R)) ) = (slug/ft^3).

Wait, but let me compute rho1:

rho1 = 124.7 psia / (53.35 ft·lbf/(slug·°R) * 534.67 °R )

Compute denominator: 53.35 * 534.67 ≈ 53.35 * 500 =26675, 53.35 *34.67 ≈ 53.35*34 = 1813.9, 53.35*0.67≈35.74. So total around 26675+1813.9+35.74=28524.64.

So denominator is 28524.64.

So rho1 = 124.7 / 28524.64 ≈ 0.00438 slug/ft^3.

That's correct as earlier.

Similarly, rho2 = P2 / ( R * T2 )

But wait, P2 is the pressure at the smaller section. But the initial pressure was 110 psig, but that's at the larger section, perhaps. So the problem states that the initial pressure is 110 psig, so perhaps the larger section has P1 = 110 psig, and the smaller section P2 is determined by the mass flow rate and the area.

Wait, but no, perhaps the initial pressure and temperature are for the initial section, and then the mass flow rate is given. So the initial P is 110 psig, T is 75°F. The mass flow rate is 6.1 slugs/s.

So, I can compute rho1 using the initial P and T.

rho1 = P1 / ( R * T1 )

Wait, but P1 is in psia, so to get in lbf, multiply by 144.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the pressure to lbf.

So P1 = 110 psia = 110 * 144 = 15840 lbf/ft².

Wait, no, 110 psia is 110 + 14.7 = 124.7 psia, which is 124.7 * 144 lbf/ft²? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's compute it correctly.

Wait, 1 psia = 14.7 psf. So 110 psia = 110 * 14.7 = 1617 psf.

Wait, but in terms of lbf/ft², 1 psi = 144 lbf/ft²? Wait, no, 1 lbf/ft² = 144 lbf/ft². Wait, no, I think that's incorrect.

Wait, let me clarify. 1 lbf is the force exerted by a pound of mass under standard gravity. So 1 lbf = 32.174 lb·ft/(slug·s²). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me proceed with the correct conversion:

1 psia = 144 psf (pounds per square foot).

So 110 psia = 110 * 144 = 15840 psf.

But in terms of lbf/ft², 1 psf = 144 lbf/ft²? No, wait, 1 lbf/ft² = 144 lbf/ft²? No, 1 lbf/ft² is 144 lbf/ft²? No, wait, 1 lbf = 32.174 lb·ft/(slug·s²), and 1 ft² is (ft)^2, so perhaps I'm making a mistake in units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to convert the pressure from psia to lbf/ft².

Wait, 1 psia = 144 psf (pounds per square foot). So 124.7 psia = 124.7 * 144 = 18,000 lbf/ft² (approx).

Wait, no, wait. 1 psi = 144 psf. So 124.7 psi = 124.7 * 144 = 18,000 lbf/ft² (exact value would be 124.7 *144 = 18000 lbf/ft²).

Wait, no, 124.7 *144= 18,000 lbf/ft²?

Wait, 144 * 124.7. Let me compute this accurately.

144 * 124 = 18,000 + (144*0.7 = 100.8) → 18,000 +100.8=18,100.8.

Wait, 144 * 124.7 = 144*(124 + 0.7) = 144*124 + 144*0.7 = 18,000 (wait, 144*100=14,400, 144*24=3,456 → 14,400+3,456=17,856) + 100.8 → 17,856+100.8=17,956.8.

So 124.7 psi = 17,956.8 lbf/ft².

Wait, but I'm getting this from 144 * 124.7, but perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the formula P (in lbf/ft²) = Psia * 144.

So, P1 = 110 *144 = 15,840 lbf/ft².

Wait, that makes sense. 110 psia is 15,840 lbf/ft².

So, rho1 = P1/( R * T1 )

R is 53.35 ft·lbf/(slug·°R) as before.

So,

rho1 = 15,840 / (53.35 * 534.67 )

Compute denominator: 53.35 *534.67 ≈ 53.35 *500 =26,675; 53.35 *34.67 ≈ 53.35 *35 =1,867.25 → total ≈26,675 +1,867.25 ≈28,542.25.

So denominator ≈53.35 *534.67 ≈28,542.25.

So,

rho1 = 15840 / 28542.25 ≈ 0.5548 slug/ft^3.

Hmm, that's more reasonable than 0.00438.

Wait, but I thought rho1 was 0.00438 earlier, which is correct, but that's for 75°F and 110 psia. But perhaps that's incorrect. So perhaps I should compute rho1 at the initial section correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute rho1 correctly:

P1 = 110 psia → 110 psia = 110 * 144 = 15,840 lbf/ft².

R = 53.35 ft·lbf/(slug·°R)

T1 = 75°F = 534.67 °R.

So,

rho1 = P1/( R * T1 ) = 15,840 / (53.35 * 534.67 )

Compute denominator: 53.35 * 534.67 ≈ 53.35 * 500 = 26,675; 53.35 *34.67 ≈ 53.35 *30=1,600.5; 53.35 *4.67≈249.4 → total 1,600.5 +249.4=1,849.9 → so 26,675 +1,849.9 = 28,524.9.

So denominator is 28,524.9.

rho1 = 15,840 / 28,524.9 ≈ 0.5548 slug/ft^3.

Hmm, that's a higher density than I initially thought. So rho1 is 0.5548 slug/ft^3.

Wait, but then, since the fluid is incompressible, or not?

Wait, perhaps the assumption of incompressibility is incorrect, and the problem requires using the exact solution with the Bernoulli equation and the continuity equation taking into account the varying densities.

So, perhaps I should proceed without assuming incompressibility.

So, using the continuity equation:

A1 v1 = A2 v2 → v2 = (A1/A2) v1.

And the Bernoulli equation:

P1 + 0.5 rho1 v1^2 = P2 + 0.5 rho2 v2^2.

But since the fluid is incompressible, and the pressure and density are related by rho = P/(R T), rho1 = P1/(R T1 ), rho2 = P2/(R T2 ).

But wait, perhaps I can express rho2 in terms of rho1.

Since rho1 = P1/(R T1 ), rho2 = P2/(R T2 ).

But in this case, I don't know P2 yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express P2 in terms of P1.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is to write the Bernoulli equation in terms of the initial and final pressures.

So, the Bernoulli equation is:

P1 + 0.5 rho1 v1^2 = P2 + 0.5 rho2 v2^2 → P2 = P1 + 0.5 rho1 v1^2 - 0.5 rho2 v2^2.

But since rho2 is related to P2, perhaps I can find a way to express P2 in terms of P1.

But perhaps this is getting too involved. Let me think about the problem again.

I have a pipe with two sections, with diameters 1.1 ft and 0.8 ft, so the area changes from A1 to A2. The fluid is air, so the density varies with pressure. The mass flow rate is given, and the initial pressure is given at the larger section.

I can compute rho1 using the initial pressure and temperature.

rho1 = P1/(R T1 )

P1 is 110 psia, which is 110 * 144 = 15,840 lbf/ft².

So,

rho1 = 15,840 / (53.35 * 534.67 ) ≈ 0.5548 slug/ft^3.

Similarly, rho2 = P2/(R T2 )

But I don't know P2 yet. But perhaps I can find P2 in terms of the mass flow rate and velocities.

Wait, the mass flow rate is given as 6.1 slugs/s.

Mass flow rate = rho1 * A1 * v1 = rho2 * A2 * v2.

So, rho2 = rho1 * (A1 / A2 ) * (v2 / v1 )

But v2 = (A1/A2) v1 → v2/v1 = (A1 /A2 )^2.

So,

rho2 = rho1 * (A1/A2 ) * (A1/A2 )^2 = rho1 * (A1 /A2 )^3.

So,

rho2 = rho1 * (1.1/0.8)^3 ≈ rho1 * (1.375)^3 ≈ rho1 * 2.64.

So, rho2 ≈ 0.5548 * 2.64 ≈ 1.465 slug/ft^3.

Wait, that's a higher density than rho1, which might make sense if the pressure increases.

Now, using Bernoulli equation:

P1 + 0.5 rho1 v1^2 = P2 + 0.5 rho2 v2^2.

We can compute P2 as:

P2 = P1 + 0.5 rho1 v1^2 - 0.5 rho2 v2^2.

But since v2 = (A1/A2) v1 → v2 = 1.890625 v1.

So,

v2^2 = (A1/A2)^2 v1^2 = (1.890625)^2 v1^2 ≈ 3.574 v1^2.

So,

P2 = P1 + 0.5 rho1 v1^2 - 0.5 rho2 * 3.574 v1^2.

Compute each term:

0.5 rho1 v1^2 = 0.5 * 0.5548 slug/ft^3 * v1^2.

Hmm, but I don't know v1 yet. Wait, perhaps I can compute v1 from the mass flow rate and the area.

So,

Mass flow rate = rho1 * A1 * v1 → v1 = mass_flow_rate / (rho1 * A1 )

Given that,

mass_flow_rate = 6.1 slugs/s,

rho1 = 0.5548 slug/ft^3,

A1 = (pi * (1.1)^2 ) /4 ≈ 0.8639 ft².

So,

v1 = 6.1 / (0.5548 * 0.8639 )

Compute denominator: 0.5548 * 0.8639 ≈ 0.5548 * 0.8639 ≈ 0.478.

So,

v1 ≈ 6.1 / 0.478 ≈ 12.76 ft/s.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check the calculations.

Wait, 0.5548 * 0.8639: Let me compute 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4; 0.5 * 0.06 = 0.03; 0.0548 * 0.8 = 0.04384; 0.0548 * 0.06 = 0.003288.

So adding all together:

0.4 + 0.03 + 0.04384 + 0.003288 ≈ 0.4 +0.03 is 0.43, +0.04384 is 0.47384, +0.003288 is 0.477128.

So, denominator is approximately 0.477128.

v1 = 6.1 / 0.477128 ≈ 12.76 ft/s.

Hmm, that's a bit high, but perhaps it's correct.

Now, compute v2 = (A1/A2 ) v1.

A1 = 0.8639 ft²,

A2 = (pi * 0.8^2 ) /4 ≈ (pi * 0.64 ) /4 ≈ (3.1416 * 0.64 ) /4 ≈ 1.999 /4 ≈ 0.5 ft².

Wait, let me compute it accurately.

0.8^2 = 0.64,

pi * 0.64 ≈ 2.0106,

divided by 4: 2.0106 /4 ≈ 0.50265 ft².

So, A2 ≈ 0.50265 ft².

Thus,

v2 = (0.8639 / 0.50265) * v1 → 0.8639 /0.50265 ≈ 1.719.

So, v2 ≈ 1.719 * 12.76 ≈ 21.85 ft/s.

Wait, that seems extremely high, but maybe correct.

Now, compute P2.

P2 = P1 + 0.5 rho1 v1^2 - 0.5 rho2 v2^2.

Compute each term:

0.5 rho1 v1^2: 0.5 * 0.5548 * (12.76)^2.

Compute 0.5 *0.5548 = 0.2774.

Compute (12.76)^2 ≈ 162.8176.

So,

0.2774 * 162.8176 ≈ 0.2774 *160 ≈44.384, plus 0.2774 *2.8176 ≈0.783 → total ≈45.167.

So, 45.167 psi.

Wait, but P1 is given in psia, so adding these terms would give P2 in psia.

Wait, but let me compute each part accurately.

First, compute 0.5 * rho1 * v1^2.

rho1 = 0.5548 slug/ft^3.

v1^2 = (12.76)^2 = 162.8176 ft²/s².

So,

0.5 * 0.5548 * 162.8176 = 0.2774 * 162.8176 ≈ 45.167.

Similarly, compute 0.5 * rho2 * v2^2.

rho2 = 1.465 slug/ft^3.

v2 = 21.85 ft/s.

v2^2 = (21.85)^2 ≈477.4225 ft²/s².

So,

0.5 * 1.465 * 477.4225 = 0.7325 * 477.4225 ≈ 0.7325 * 400=293, 0.7325 *77.4225≈56.5 → total ≈349.5.

So,

P2 = P1 + 45.167 - 349.5.

But wait, P1 is 15,840 lbf/ft², but 45.167 and 349.5 are in psi? Wait, no, because v1^2 and v2^2 are in ft²/s², and rho is in slug/ft³. So, 0.5 rho1 v1^2 is in (slug/ft³) * (ft²/s²) → (slug ft^2)/(3 ft^3 s²) → (slug s²)/(3 ft s²) → no, wait, perhaps it's easier to keep everything in consistent units.

Wait, perhaps I should convert all terms to psi.

Wait, but let's proceed step by step.

Compute 0.5 rho1 v1^2:

rho1 = 0.5548 slug/ft³,

v1 = 12.76 ft/s,

v1² = (12.76)^2 = 162.8176 ft²/s².

So,

0.5 * 0.5548 * 162.8176 = 0.2774 * 162.8176 ≈45.167 psi.

Similarly, 0.5 rho2 v2^2:

rho2 = 1.465 slug/ft³,

v2 = 21.85 ft/s,

v2² = (21.85)^2 = 477.4225 ft²/s².

So,

0.5 *1.465 *477.4225 = 0.7325 *477.4225 ≈349.5 psi.

So,

P2 = P1 + 45.167 - 349.5.

But wait, all these terms are in psi, right? Because rho is in slug/ft³ and v² is ft²/s², so the product is (slug/ft³) * (ft²/s²) )= (slug ft²)/(ft³ s² ) → (slug s²)/(ft s²) )? Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe I should convert everything to the same unit system.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the pressure terms to psi, but since the Bernoulli equation is in terms of pressure, perhaps I can keep everything in the same units. Alternatively, let's convert P1, rho1, v1, rho2, and v2 into consistent units.

Let me try to convert all into SI units.

So, let's compute everything in SI units.

First, P1 = 110 psia.

Convert psia to Pascals.

1 psi = 6894.5 Pa.

So, 110 psi = 110 * 6894.5 ≈ 758,395 Pa.

So, P1 = 758,395 Pa.

Next, rho1 = 0.5548 slug/ft³.

Convert slug/ft³ to kg/m³.

1 slug = 14.5939 kg,

1 ft = 0.3048 m,

so,

slug/ft³ = (14.5939 kg) / (0.3048 m)^3 = 14.5939 / (0.028256) kg/m³ ≈ 516.37 kg/m³.

Wait, wait, let me compute 1 ft³ = (0.3048 m)^3 = 0.0282575 m³.

So,

slug/ft³ = (14.5939 kg) / (0.0282575 m³) ≈ 516.37 kg/m³.

So, rho1 = 0.5548 * 516.37 ≈ 286.2 kg/m³.

Wait, let's compute that accurately.

0.5548 * 516.37 ≈ 0.5 *516.37 =258.185, 0.0548 *516.37≈28.03, so total≈258.185+28.03=286.215 kg/m³.

So, rho1 ≈ 286.2 kg/m³.

Next, v1 = 12.76 ft/s.

Convert ft/s to m/s.

1 ft/s = 0.3048 m/s.

So, v1 = 12.76 * 0.3048 ≈ 3.88 m/s.

Next, rho2 = 1.465 slug/ft³.

Convert to kg/m³.

As before, 1 slug/ft³ = 516.37 kg/m³.

So, rho2 = 1.465 *516.37 ≈ 1.465 *500 = 732.5, 1.465 *16.37≈23.98, so total≈756.48 kg/m³.

Wait, let me compute accurately.

1.465 *516.37.

Compute 1 *516.37=516.37,

0.4*516.37=206.548,

0.06*516.37=30.9822,

0.005*516.37=0.258185.

Adding them: 516.37 +206.548=722.918 +30.9822=753.9 +0.258185≈754.158 kg/m³.

So, rho2 ≈754.16 kg/m³.

Next, v2 =21.85 ft/s.

Convert to m/s: 21.85 *0.3048 ≈6.633 m/s.

Now, compute P2.

Using the Bernoulli equation:

P1 + 0.5 rho1 v1^2 = P2 + 0.5 rho2 v2^2.

Rearranging:

P2 = P1 + 0.5 rho1 v1^2 - 0.5 rho2 v2^2.

We have all the terms in kg/m³ and m/s. But we need to ensure that the units are compatible.

Wait, but let's compute each term in N/m² (pascals), since the Bernoulli equation is in terms of pressure.

Wait, because P is in pascals, which is N/m².

But let's compute each term in Pa.

Wait, but earlier, I tried to compute in SI units, but perhaps it's easier to compute each term in pascals.

Let me compute P1 in N/m².

P1 =758,395 Pa.

Next, compute 0.5 rho1 v1^2.

rho1 =286.2 kg/m³,

v1 =3.88 m/s,

v1² = (3.88)^2 ≈15.0544 m²/s².

So,

0.5 *286.2 *15.0544 ≈0.5 *286.2=143.1,

143.1 *15.0544 ≈143.1 *15≈2146.5, 143.1 *0.0544≈7.74, so total≈2146.5 +7.74≈2154.24.

So, 0.5 rho1 v1² ≈2154.24 N/m².

Similarly, compute 0.5 rho2 v2².

rho2 =754.16 kg/m³,

v2=6.633 m/s,

v2²≈43.782.

So,

0.5 *754.16 *43.782 ≈0.5 *754.16=377.08,

377.08 *43.782≈377 *40=15,080, 377*3.782≈1,409. So total≈15,080+1,409≈16,489.

So, 0.5 rho2 v2²≈16,489 N/m².

Now, compute P2:

P2 = P1 + 2154.24 -16,489.

But P1 is 758,395 N/m².

So,

P2 =758,395 +2,154.24 -16,489.

Compute 758,395 +2,154.24 =760,559.24.

Then subtract 16,489: 760,559.24 -16,489 =744,070.24 N/m².

So, P2 ≈744,070 N/m².

But let's check whether this makes sense.

Wait, initially, P1 was 758,395 N/m².

After applying the Bernoulli equation, P2 is lower, which makes sense if the fluid is losing energy.

So, the pressure drops from ~758,000 Pa to ~744,000 Pa, which is a decrease of about 4,000 Pa.

Wait, but that seems quite a big drop, but given that the velocity is quite high, perhaps it's correct.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again.

Compute 0.5 * rho1 * v1²:

rho1 =286.2 kg/m³,

v1=3.88 m/s,

v1²=15.0544 m²/s².

0.5 *286.2=143.1,

143.1 *15.0544 ≈2154.24.

Similarly, 0.5 * rho2 *v2²:

rho2=754.16 kg/m³,

v2=6.633 m/s,

v2²=43.782.

0.5 *754.16=377.08,

377.08 *43.782≈16,489.

So, 758,395 +2,154.24=760,559.24.

760,559.24 -16,489=744,070.24 N/m².

Yes, that's correct.

But perhaps I should convert P2 back to psia.

Wait, but the problem gave P1 in psia, so perhaps the answer should be in psia as well.

So, we can compute P2 in psia by dividing P2 in N/m² by the conversion factor from N/m² to psia.

Wait, 1 psia = 6894.2573 Pa.

So, to convert P2 from N/m² to psia, divide by 6894.2573.

So,

P2 (psia) =744,070 /6894.2573 ≈107.46 psia.

So, the pressure at point 2 is approximately 107.46 psia.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again.

Wait, the Bernoulli equation is:

P1 + (v1²)/2 + rho1 * g * h1 = P2 + (v2²)/2 + rho2 * g * h2.

But in our case, we approximated the height terms as negligible, which is why the velocity term dominates.

But perhaps in reality, the pressure difference is more significant because of the height.

Wait, but in our initial assumption, we treated the pressure terms as if they're the same, which is why the velocity term dominates.

So, perhaps I should include the height terms to get a more accurate result.

Wait, but that would require knowing the positions of points 1 and 2 relative to the reference point, which is not given here.

So, perhaps the approach I took is acceptable for the given data.

So, given that, the pressure at point 2 is ~107.46 psia.

Wait, but let me cross-validate the numbers.

Wait, for the pressure at point 2, P2 =744,070 N/m².

Convert to psia: 744,070 /6894.2573 ≈107.46 psia.

So, that's the calculation.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the Bernoulli equation approximation. Because if the height is significant, then the pressure difference would be more complicated.

But perhaps since the problem doesn't provide the height, and only gives the pressure at point 1, and the other data, the assumption that the pressure terms are the same is acceptable.

So, in that case, the answer is approximately 107.46 psia.

But let me check if my Bernoulli calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term step by step, using units.

Let me try that.

Compute P1:758,395 Pa.

Compute 0.5 rho1 v1^2.

rho1 =286.2 kg/m³.

v1 =3.88 m/s.

v1²=15.0544 m²/s².

So,

0.5 *286.2=143.1,

143.1 *15.0544=2154.24 J/m³.

Wait, but since 1 Pa =1 N/m², and 1 J/m³ =1 Pa, so 0.5 rho1 v1^2 =2154.24 N/m².

Similarly, 0.5 rho2 v2^2.

rho2=754.16 kg/m³,

v2=6.633 m/s,

v2²=43.782 m²/s².

0.5 *754.16=377.08,

377.08 *43.782=16,489 N/m².

So, P2 = P1 +2154.24 -16,489.

P2 =758,395 +2,154.24 -16,489 =744,070 N/m².

Convert to psia:744,070 /6894.2573 ≈107.46 psia.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the pressure at point 2 is approximately 107.46 psia.

Wait, but the question says to provide the answer with four decimal places.

So, 107.4600 psia.

But let me double-check the calculations once more.

Compute 0.5 * rho1 * v1²:

rho1 =286.2,

v1=3.88,

v1²=15.0544.

0.5 *286.2=143.1,

143.1 *15.0544=2154.24.

Compute 0.5 * rho2 *v2²:

rho2=754.16,

v2=6.633,

v2²=43.782.

0.5*754.16=377.08,

377.08 *43.782=16,489.

So, P2=758,395 +2,154.24 -16,489.

Adding 758,395 +2,154.24: 758,395 +2,000=760,395, then +154.24=760,559.24.

Subtract 16,489: 760,559.24 -16,489=744,070.24 N/m².

Convert to psia:744,070.24 /6894.2573 ≈107.4600 psia.

Yes, so the answer is approximately 107.4600 psia.

But wait, perhaps I should check the units again.

Wait, when I converted N/m² to psia, I used 1 psia = 6894.2573 Pa.

So, N/m² * 1 J/m^3 =1 Pa.

So, P2 (N/m²) / 6894.2573 = P2 (psia).

So, yes, 744,070 /6894 ≈107.46.

So, the final answer is approximately 107.4600 psia.

But let me check my calculations one more time.

Compute 0.5 rho1 v1^2:

rho1=286.2,

v1=3.88,

v1²=15.0544.

0.5 *286.2=143.1.

143.1 *15.0544=2154.24.

Similarly, 0.5 rho2 v2²:

rho2=754.16,

v2=6.633,

v2²=43.782.

0.5 *754.16=377.08.

377.08 *43.782=377.07 *43.782.

Compute 377 *43.782 ≈377 *40=15,000, 377*3.782≈1,400, so 16,400.

So, 377.07 *43.782≈16,489.

So, 760,559.24 -16,489=744,070.24.

Divide by 6894.2573:

744,070.24 /6894.2573.

Let me compute this division.

Compute 744,070 /6894.

Compute 6894 *107=740, 6894 *100=68, 6894*7=48, so 6894*107=68, 6894*7=48, so 68, 6894*(100+7)=68, 6894*100=68, 6894*7=48, so 68, 6894*107=70, 78, 吗？不对，这可能会有误差。

Alternatively, let's compute 6894 * 107 =?

6894 *100 =689,400,

6894 *7=48, 648, 所以 689,400 +48,648=700, 048, 648=708,648.

Wait, no, 689,400 +48,648=700, 48, 648? Let me check:

689,400 +40,000=700,  689,400 +48,648=708,  689,400 +40,000=700,  700,  708, 648.

Wait, 689,400 +48,648=708,  648.

Wait, 689,400 +48,648=708,  48. Wait, 689,400 +40,000=700,000, then +8, 648=700,000 +8,648=708,648.

So, 6894 *107=708,648.

But we have 744,070.

So, 708,648 is 708,648.

Subtracting from 708,648, we have 744,070 -708,648=35,422.

So, 708,648 is 708,648, and we have 744,070 -708,648=35,422.

So, 74,400 (wait, 744,070 -708,648=35,422).

So, now, 35,422 divided by 6,930 (since 748, 689 is 6,890).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 354,220 (since 35,422 is 35,422, so 354,220) divided by 6,890.

Wait, 6,890 *50=344,500.

Subtracting 344,500 from 354,200 (since 354,220-344,500=9,700).

Wait, 6,890 *1 =6,890.

So, 354,200 -344,500=10,500.

Wait, maybe I'm getting too detailed.

Alternatively, 35,422 /6893.2573= approx 5.015.

Wait, no, 6,893.2573 *5=34,466.2865.

Wait, 35,422 -34,466.2865=1,033.714.

So, 1,033.714 /6,873.2573≈0.148.

So, total is 5.148.

Wait, but wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to accept that 744,070 /6894≈107.46.

So, the answer is approximately 107.4600 psia.

So, the answer is 107.4600 psia, or in the box, \boxed{107.4600} psia.

But I should check if the problem expects the answer in four decimal places.

Wait, the problem says, "put your final answer within \boxed{}." So, perhaps it's sufficient to write 107.4600 psia.

But let me check whether my calculation is correct.

Wait, let me compute 754.16 *6.774.

Wait, wait, no, that's not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I should check with a calculator.

But since I can't, I'll proceed with the calculation I've done, which gives approximately 107.4600 psia.

So, the final answer is 107.4600 psia.

Wait, but perhaps I should check if the Bernoulli equation's approximation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should also consider the height. Let's compute the height difference.

Assuming that point 1 is at height h1 and point 2 is at height h2, then the pressure difference can also be approximated by ρ g h.

So, let's compute the difference in pressure due to height.

Assuming that point 1 is at some height, and point 2 is at another height.

But since we don't have the actual heights, perhaps we can compute the height difference.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to assume that the height is the same, and thus the Bernoulli approximation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure difference is due to the velocity, so the pressure difference is approximately (P2 - P1) = (v1² - v2²) * density.

But perhaps the problem expects to ignore the height, so the answer is 107.4600 psia.

So, I'll go with that.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{107.4600} psia
</think>

Given the problem, we need to find the pressure at point 2 (P2) given the other conditions.

1. **Calculate the initial pressure (P1):**
   - Given P1 = 758,395 Pa.
   - Convert to psia: \( \frac{758,395}{6894.2573} \approx 107.46 \) psia.

2. **Calculate the terms involving velocity (v):**
   - **Calculate 0.5 * rho1 * v1²:**
     - rho1 = 286.2 kg/m³
     - v1 = 3.88 m/s
     - \( v_1^2 = 15.0544 \) m²/s²
     - \( 0.5 * 286.2 = 143.1 \)
     - \( 143.1 * 15.0544 = 2154.24 \) J/m³
   - **Calculate 0.5 * rho2 * v2²:**
     - rho2 = 754.16 kg/m³
     - v2 = 6.633 m/s
     - \( v_2^2 = 43.192 \) m²/s²
     - \( 0.5 * 754.16 = 377.08 \)
     - \( 377.08 * 43.192 \approx 16,489 \) J/m³

3. **Combine the terms:**
   - \( P2 = P1 + 2154.24 - 16489 \)
   - \( P2 = 758,395 + 2154.24 - 16489 \)
   - \( P2 = 758,395 + 2154.24 = 760,559.24 \)
   - \( 760,559.24 - 16,489 = 744,070 \) J/m³

4. **Convert back to psia:**
   - \( P2 = \frac{744,070}{6894.2573} \approx 107.46 \) psia

5. **Convert pressure at point 1 to psia:**
   - \( P1 = 758,395 \) Pa
