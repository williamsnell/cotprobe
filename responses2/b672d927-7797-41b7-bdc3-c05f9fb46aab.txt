Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about inertial reference frames and proper time. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So the question says: In an inertial reference frame S, two events occur a distance of 6e8 meters apart and are separated by a time interval of either (a) 2 seconds or (b) 1 second. The question is asking what the proper time interval between these two events is.

Wait, right. Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the events. So if the events happen in different frames, the proper time would depend on the relative velocity between the frames. Oh wait, but the problem doesn't give any information about the velocity between the frames, like S and another frame S' moving relative to S.

Wait, the options include things like a) 2 sec, b) 1 sec, etc. So the question is, without knowing the relative velocity, can we determine the proper time?

I remember that proper time is the shortest possible time between two events as measured in any inertial frame. So if the events are separated by a distance and a time, the proper time would be less than or equal to the time measured in the frame where the events are at rest relative to each other. Oh wait, but the problem isn't giving us the velocities, so I can't calculate it directly. 

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The formula for proper time is given by the Lorentz transformation. The proper time (∆t') is related to the time (∆t) in another frame by the formula:

∆t' = √( (∆t)^2 - (v^2 ∆x^2) ) / c^2

But wait, that's when you're in a frame moving at velocity v relative to the frame where the distance is ∆x. But if you don't know v, you can't compute this. So if the problem doesn't give you the velocity or any other information, how can we find the proper time?

Wait, wait a second. Proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events are simultaneous. Because, if two events occur at different times and positions in frame S, then in a frame moving relative to S, the time between them would be the proper time. But since we don't know the velocity, we can't compute this.

Wait, but what's the formula when we don't have the relative velocity? Oh right, the proper time must be less than or equal to the time measured in any frame. Wait, but that doesn't directly help. Wait, maybe the problem is intended to realize that without knowing v, we can't determine the proper time, so the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the proper time interval. So the proper time is the shortest possible time between two events in any inertial frame. So the proper time is always less than or equal to the time as measured in the frame where the events are at rest (i.e., the frame where ∆x' = 0). But in this problem, events are at some separation in frame S, so the proper time can't be bigger than that. But without knowing the velocity, we can't compute the exact value.

Wait, but the event separation in frame S is given, but the time interval is given. So without knowing v, can we get any number? No, because both v and ∆t' are variables here. So the proper time depends on v. Therefore, without knowing v, we cannot calculate the proper time. Thus, the correct answer is option C: ∆t' cannot be determined without additional information about the velocity of S' relative to S.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A to J, with each being a possible value. So the question is what is the proper time? The options give possible ∆t' values, but without knowing v, we can't get any specific value. So the correct answer is C, because we can't determine it without more info.

The question involves determining the proper time interval between two events in an inertial reference frame S, where the events are separated by a distance of \( 6 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \) and a time interval of either (a) 2 seconds or (b) 1 second. The proper time is the shortest possible time between two events as measured in any inertial frame and depends on the relative velocity \( v \) between the frames.

To calculate the proper time, the Lorentz transformation formula is used:

\[
\Delta t' = \sqrt{\Delta t^2 - \frac{v^2 \Delta x^2}{c^2}}
\]

However, this formula requires the relative velocity \( v \), which is not provided in the problem. Without \( v \), the proper time \( \Delta t' \) cannot be uniquely determined. The proper time must be less than or equal to the time measured in any frame, but without additional information about \( v \), we cannot compute a specific value for \( \Delta t' \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option C** states that the proper time cannot be determined without additional information about the velocity of \( S' \) relative to \( S \). This aligns with the reasoning that \( v \) is unknown and cannot be determined.
- All other options either provide specific values for \( \Delta t' \) (e.g., A, B, E, F, G, H, I, J) or suggest that the proper time is zero (e.g., G), which is incorrect as the proper time is always non-zero for events separated in space.
- **Options A, B, D, E, F, H, I, J** provide possible values for \( \Delta t' \), but these are incorrect because they imply that \( v \) is known, which is not stated in the problem.

Thus, the correct answer is:
