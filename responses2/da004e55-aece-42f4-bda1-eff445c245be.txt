Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the carrying charge for a television set. Let me see if I can figure this out. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it step by step.

The TV costs $525 cash price. They're paying $75 down first, so that leaves $525 - $75 = $450 to be paid over 12 monthly installments. Each installment is $42.75. So the total amount paid through installments is 12 * $42.75. Let me calculate that: 42.75 times 12. Let me see, 40 *12 is 480, 2.75 *12 is 33, so total is $513. Wait, wait, no: 42.75 * 12. Let me do 42 *12 first. 40*12=480, 2*12=24, so 480+24=504. Then 0.75*12=9. So 504 +9 = 513. Yep. So total installments are $513, plus the $75 down, totals $588. But the cash price is $525. So the extra amount must be the interest or charge. Wait, no: wait, the cash price is what you pay upfront, so the total amount paid is the sum of the down payment and the installments. So the total is $75 + ($42.75 *12) = $75 + $513 = $588. But the TV is only $525. So the extra $588 - $525 = $63 is the interest or the charge. So the carrying charge is $63.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A to J. So option C is $63. But wait, waitâ€”the question is about carrying charge. Is the carrying charge the interest, or the effective interest rate? Because sometimes the question might be referring to the rate, not the interest amount. But in this case, the way it's phrased, "carrying charge" probably refers to the interest or the interest rate. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the interest as a percentage of the cash price or something else.

Wait, another way to think about this: the total amount paid is $588. The cash price is $525. The difference is $63, which is the interest. So the carrying charge is $63, which is option C. But wait, perhaps the question is asking for the rate of interest, not the actual interest amount.

Wait, the question says "calculate the carrying charge for the television set." I'm a bit confused. Because carrying charge can refer to the interest rate or the interest amount. Oh wait, sometimes "carrying charge" is used interchangeably with "interest rate." But in this case, the options don't have a $63 as the interest rate. Alternatively, maybe it's the effective interest rate, which would require calculating the interest on the loan amount.

Alternatively, let me think again. The total amount paid is $588. The interest is $588 - $525 = $63. So the interest is $63. The question is asking for the carrying charge, which is the interest. So the answer would be $63, option C.

Wait, but wait another moment. Maybe the question is asking for the effective interest rate, which would be the total interest divided by the loan amount. So in that case, $63 / $525. Let me compute that: 63 divided by 525. 525 is 525/63 = 8.333... So the rate is approximately 8.333%, but that's not one of the options. So that suggests that perhaps the question is simply asking for the interest amount, which is $63.

Looking back at the options, option C is $63. So the correct answer should be C.

The carrying charge, which is the interest, is calculated as the difference between the total amount paid and the cash price. The total amount paid is $75 (down payment) + 12 * $42.75 (installments) = $75 + $513 = $588. The cash price is $525, so the interest is $588 - $525 = $63. Therefore, the carrying charge is $63, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
