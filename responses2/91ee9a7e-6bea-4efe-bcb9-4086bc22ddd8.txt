Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The problem says that 0.25 mol of a weak, monoprotic acid is dissolved in 0.25 L of distilled water. Then they measure the pH as 4.26. They're asking for the pKa of this weak acid.

Hmm. So I remember that for weak acids, the pH isn't determined by the dissociation of the entire acid because it's not strong. Instead, we use the acid dissociation constant, Ka, and find pKa, which is the negative log of Ka.

Wait, but wait. The solution's volume is given, but since all the acid is dissolved in water, I can probably ignore the volume for the concentration calculation, right? Because when you dissolve a solute in a solvent, the volume change is negligible. So the concentration of the acid in solution is just moles divided by liters.

So the moles of acid are 0.25 mol, and the volume is 0.25 L, so the concentration is 0.25 / 0.25 = 1 M. Oh wait, that's 1 mole per liter, so 1 M. So [HA] = 1 M.

But wait, the acid is weak, so it doesn't dissociate completely. So HA ↔ H+ + A-. The initial concentration is 1 M, and the change is x, where x is the amount of acid that dissociates.

So the equilibrium concentrations would be:
[HA] = 1 - x
[H+] = 0 + x
[A-] = 0 + x.

And the pH is given as 4.26, so [H+] is 10^-4.26. Let me calculate that. Wait, 10^4 is 10000, but 10^0.26 is about 1.81 (since 10^0.3 is about 2). So 10^4.26 is 10000 * 1.81 = 18100? Wait, no, wait. No, wait: 10^4.26 = 10^(4 + 0.26) = 10^4 * 10^0.26. 10^0.26 is about 1.81. So 10^4.26 is 18100. So [H+] is 1.81e-4? Wait, wait, no. Wait, pH is 4.26, so [H+] is 10^-4.26. Let me compute that. 4.26 is 4 + 0.26. 10^4 is 10000. 10^0.26 is approx sqrt(10) is about 3.16, but 0.26 isn't exactly that. Let me think: ln(10) is about 2.3026, so ln(10^0.26) is 0.26 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.6. So 10^0.26 ≈ e^0.6 ≈ 1.822. So [H+] = 1e-4.26 = 5.48e-5 approximately.

Wait, no. Wait, 10^-4.26 is 10^-(4 + 0.26) = 10^-4 * 10^-0.26. 10^-0.26 ≈ 0.549 (since 10^0.26 is about 1.81, so reciprocal is about 0.549). So 1e-4 * 0.549 = 5.49e-5 M. So [H+] is approximately 5.49e-5 M.

But wait, let's be precise. Let me compute 10^-4.26. Using a calculator: 4.26 is between 4 and 5. 10^-4 is 0.0001. 10^-0.26 is about 0.548. So 0.0001 * 0.548 is 0.0000548, which is 5.48e-5. So [H+] is 5.48e-5.

But wait, wait. No, wait. Because pH is 4.26, so [H+] is 10^-4.26. Let me compute that using a calculator-like approach.

But perhaps it's easier to remember that 10^-4 is 1e-4=0.0001. 10^-0.26 is about 0.548, so 0.0001 * 0.548 = 5.48e-5, which is the [H+].

So [H+] = 5.48e-5 M.

Now, since the acid is HA, which dissociates to H+ and A-.

The Ka expression is:

Ka = [H+][A-] / [HA]

We know that [H+] is 5.48e-5, [A-] is x, and [HA] is 1 - x. Since x is small compared to 1, we can approximate [HA] ≈ 1.

So Ka ≈ (5.48e-5)(x) / (1) → Ka ≈5.48e-5 x.

But wait, another way: since [H+] = x, because HA → H+ + A- in a 1:1 ratio. So [H+] = x = 5.48e-5.

Wait, so [H+] = x, then [A-] = x and [HA] = 1 - x ≈ 1.

So substituting into Ka: Ka = (5.48e-5) * (5.48e-5) / 1 = (5.48e-5)^2.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make Ka about 3e-9, which is very small. Then pKa would be around 8.5. But let me think again.

Wait, wait a second. Because the acid is weak, the approximation [HA] = 1 - x is valid only if x is much less than 1. But if x is 5.48e-5, which is 0.00548%, so it's a small x, so the approximation holds.

Wait, but if x is 5.48e-5, then [A-] is 5.48e-5, and [HA] is approximately 1.

So what is the expression for Ka? Since [H+] is 5.48e-5, [A-] is 5.48e-5, and [HA] is 1. So:

Ka = (5.48e-5) * (5.48e-5) / 1 → 3.0e-9 (approx.)

Wait, that's 3e-9. So pKa is log10(1/(3e-9)) → log10(3.33e8) → around 8.52.

Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, because [H+] is 5.48e-5, which is approximately 5.48 × 1e-5. So the pH is 4.26, which we calculated earlier as [H+] = 5.48e-5.

Wait, but then the Ka would be (5.48e-5)^2 / 1 → approximately 3e-9.

So pKa would be -log(3e-9). Let me compute that.

Log(3e-9) = log(3) + log(1e-9) = 0.4771 -9 = -8.523. So pKa is 8.523, which is approximately 8.52.

Looking at the options, option J is 8.52. So is that the answer?

Wait, but another approach: another way to compute Ka is using the Ka expression with x.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, the problem is about a weak acid and the pH after it's dissolved in water. So the initial concentration is 1 M, and the pH is 4.26.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that connects pH, concentration, and pKa.

Wait, but for weak acids, the approximation is [H+] ≈ sqrt(Ka * C), where C is concentration, and Ka is the dissociation constant. Or wait, another formula: for a weak acid, [H+] is approximately sqrt(Ka * C). But that's when x is much less than 1. Which is the case here.

Wait, so [H+] = sqrt( Ka * [HA] )

But [HA] is 1 M. So [H+] = sqrt( Ka * 1 ) → [H+] = sqrt(Ka).

So [H+]^2 = Ka.

Wait, but in our case, [H+] is 5.48e-5 → (5.48e-5)^2 is 3e-9. So Ka is 3e-9, pKa is 8.52. So option J.

Wait, but wait. Another way to compute Ka is using the exact expression without the approximation.

Ka = (x^2) / (1 - x)

Since x is 5.48e-5, which is much less than 1, 1 -x ≈ 1, so the denominator is 1.

So the exact expression would give Ka ≈ (x^2)/1 = x^2 → 3e-9, same as before.

So the pKa is 8.52.

Looking back at the options, J is 8.52.

To determine the pKa of the weak, monoprotic acid, we start by noting the given data:

- **Moles of acid**: 0.25 mol  
- **Volume of water**: 0.25 L  
- **pH of the solution**: 4.26  

From the volume and moles, the concentration of the acid in solution is:  
\[
\text{Concentration of acid} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.25}{0.25} = 1 \, \text{M}.
\]  

The pH is given as 4.26, so the hydrogen ion concentration is:  
\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-4.26}.
\]  
Using a calculator, this evaluates to:  
\[
[\text{H}^+] \approx 5.48 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]  

Since the acid is weak, it partially dissociates according to the equilibrium:  
\[
\text{HA} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{A}^-.
\]  
At equilibrium, the concentrations are:  
\[
[\text{HA}] = 1 - x, \quad [\text{H}^+] = x, \quad [\text{A}^-] = x,
\]  
where \(x\) is the concentration of dissociated acid. Since \(x\) is small compared to 1 (as \(x = 5.48 \times 10^{-5}\)), we can approximate:  
\[
[\text{HA}] \approx 1.
\]  

The acid dissociation constant \(K_a\) is given by:  
\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}.
\]  
Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:  
\[
K_a = \frac{(5.48 \times 10^{-5})^2}{1} = (5.48 \times 10^{-5})^2.
\]  
Calculating this gives:  
\[
K_a \approx 3.03 \times 10^{-9}.
\]  

The pKa is the negative logarithm of \(K_a\):  
\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(K_a) = -\log(3.03 \times 10^{-9}).
\]  
Using logarithmic properties:  
\[
\text{pKa} = -\left(\log(3.03) + \log(10^{-9})\right) = -\left(0.483 + (-9)\right) = 8.517.
\]  
Rounding to two decimal places, the pKa is approximately:  
\[
\text{pKa} \approx 8.52.
\]  

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:  
**J: 8.52**.
