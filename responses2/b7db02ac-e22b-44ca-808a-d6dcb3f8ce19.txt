Alright, so I have this question about teas, and I need to pick the correct answer from the options given. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which tea is known for its distinctive bergamot flavor. I remember that bergamot is a type of citrus flavor, often associated with orange. I'm trying to recall the teas that have that characteristic.

Looking at the options: A is Jasmine, B is English Breakfast, C is Sencha, D is Earl, E is Oolong, F is Assam, G is Rooibos, H is Grey Darjeeling, I is Prince of Wales, J is Chai.

I think Oolong is a popular tea, but I'm not sure about its origin. Wait, I think Oolong is from Singapore. I've heard it's a blend of certain herbs. Also, I recall that Oolong has a citrusy, slightly sweet taste, which might include bergamot. Alternatively, I'm trying to remember if any of the other teas have that note.

Rooibos comes to mind. I know Rooibos is from the Rooibian family. I think Rooibos is known for its strong, citrusy taste, which includes bergamot. But I'm not certain if it's the only option with that flavor.

Wait, another thought. Oolong is more of a phoetica (citrus) blend, while Rooibos is a phoetica as well. Both are known for their bergamot. But I'm trying to remember which is more famous for that specific flavor. I think Oolong is more associated with that flavor, but I'm not entirely sure.

Let me think about the other teas. For example, Assam tea is from India and is known for its peppery, centurion (cumin) notes. Prince of Wales is a drink made from floral tea, so that's probably not it. Chai is from India and is more green tea, not necessarily known for bergamot. So that leaves me with C (Sencha), D (Earl), E (Oolong), G (Rooibos), and H (Grey Darjeeling).

Wait, what's the difference between Oolong and Rooibos? Oh right, Oolong is a phoetica blend, while Rooibos is also phoetica but perhaps a different variety. I think Oolong is sometimes called the "tropical" oolong because of its citrusy, sweet notes, including bergamot. Rooibos is more of a dried plant, perhaps from a different region, but it's also known for its bergamot.

So, the question is about the last character of the answer. The options are letters, so the answer is a letter, not a word. The options are A to J, so the correct answer must be one of those letters.

Looking back, I think Oolong is the correct answer because it's known for its bergamot. I'm pretty sure that's right. So the answer should be E: Oolong.
