Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about two statements related to some machine learning models. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question presents two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2, and asks about their truthfulness. The options are A through J, each giving different combinations of these statements.

Statement 1 says that VGGNets have convolutional kernels of smaller width and height than AlexNet's first-layer kernels. I remember that AlexNet, which I think was AlexNet introduced in 2012, had some relatively small kernels. Like, AlexNet used 16x16 or 16x8 filters in the first layer. So VGGNets are older and perhaps have deeper architectures but smaller kernels. So Statement 1 is probably true because VGGs are known for having small kernels.

Statement 2 claims that data-dependent weight initialization procedures were introduced before Batch Normalization. I think I remember that weight initialization was something like Xavier or He initialization, which depends on the input distribution. Batch Normalization was introduced later, around 2016 or so. So before BN, people used static initializations, which might not be data-dependent. So Statement 2 is true because weight init methods were indeed data-dependent before batch normalization.

Wait, but I should double-check these facts to be sure. 

For Statement 1: AlexNet's first layer had 16x16 or similar. VGGs, which were used earlier, used 3x3 or 3x3 conv layers, but wait, maybe VGGs used 3x3 but with larger depth. Wait, AlexNet was the first, then ResNet, then Inception, then VGG nets. Oh, VGGs were introduced later than AlexNet? Or was AlexNet the first?

Wait, I think AlexNet was the first, and VGGs were a later architecture. So if AlexNet had 16x16, then VGGs would have smaller. But wait, wait, AlexNet used 16x16 in the first layer. VGGs, like VGG-19, used 3x3 kernels. Oh wait, no, maybe AlexNet and VGG have similar architectures. Or perhaps VGGs have different initial kernel sizes. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the specific models. For example, AlexNet used 3x3, while VGGNet (a later version of AlexNet) might have 3x3 or maybe 16x16? No, VGG's original design (VGG-19) used 3x3 kernels in each layer. So maybe the statement is correct because VGG nets have smaller kernels, but wait, the statement says 'smaller width and height', which is possible. So Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2: Data-dependent weight initialization was introduced before BN. I think that was true. The initial methods used static initializations, like Xavier or Kaiming, which are based on the variance of the data. But in practice, this might not work well, so people found ways to make it data-dependent, like He initialization. And BN came after, so yes, before BN, weight init was data-dependent. So Statement 2 is true.

So both statements are true, meaning the answer is C: True, True.

The question evaluates the truthfulness of two statements about machine learning models. 

- **Statement 1**: VGGNets have convolutional kernels of smaller width and height than AlexNet's first-layer kernels. This is true because AlexNet's first layer used 16x16 kernels, and VGG nets, which were later architectures, often used smaller kernels like 3x3.
  
- **Statement 2**: Data-dependent weight initialization procedures were introduced before Batch Normalization. This is also true because data-dependent methods, such as Xavier or He initialization, were developed before BN, which was introduced later.

Both statements are true, so the correct answer is:

ANSWER: C
