Okay, so I have this economics question about the market for multigrained bread. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that consumers are told that multigrained bread will substantially lessen the risk of cancer. I need to figure out what happens to the market for multigrained bread in this scenario.

I remember that when there's a change in consumers' preferences, it can affect both the demand curve and possibly the supply curve. Let's break it down.

First, the statement says multigrained bread reduces cancer risk. That must mean it's more appealing because more people are health-conscious. So the demand for multigrained bread increases. That would shift the demand curve to the right. 

Wait, but what about supply? The question doesn't mention anything about changes in production costs or technology. So I assume supply remains the same or at least doesn't change. Or wait, is there a reason to think supply might change? For example, if it's a new product, maybe suppliers can produce more, but the question doesn't say anything about that. So I'm probably supposed to assume that supply doesn't shift.

So if demand increases (shifts right) and supply remains the same, what happens to price and quantity? Well, when demand increases and supply stays the same, the quantity demanded increases, but supply is fixed. So price will increase. Because the same amount is being sold at a higher price. So, the market price will go up.

Looking at the options:

Option A: supply shifts right, decreasing price. No, because if demand increases and supply is same, price goes up.
Option B: demand left shift, price down. No, demand is right.
C: demand left, supply left. No, because demand is right, so C is unlikely.
H: supply shifts right, price up. No, because supply isn't changing.
D: both shift right, price same. No, because supply isn't shifting right.
E: supply shifts left, price down. No, supply isn't changing.
F: demand right, price up. That's what happens.
G: supply shifts left, price up. No, supply isn't.
I: no change, price same. No.
J: demand left, price up. No, demand is right.

So the correct option is F: demand shifts right, increasing price.

If consumers are advised that multigrained bread will substantially lessen the risk of cancer, the demand for multigrained bread increases. This causes the demand curve to shift to the right. Since the supply is assumed to remain unchanged, the market price will rise. 

The correct answer is:

F: The demand curve will shift to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread.

**Answer: F**
