Okay, I have this chemistry question here. It's about identifying which pair of reactants doesn't have a net ionic equation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

So, the question gives several options, each with two reactants. I need to determine which pair doesn't produce a net ionic equation. A net ionic equation would involve the ions from the reactants and products, but if all ions cancel out, that means the reaction doesn't proceed as written. Or wait, no, wait. Net ionic equation is when you write the ionic equation and remove spectator ions. If all ions are spectator, then the reaction doesn't proceed because no new products are formed. So, the net ionic equation would be something like no reaction, which implies that the overall equation is the same as the molecular equation, and all ions are spectator.

Let me look at each pair.

Option A: Na2SO3 + FeCl2. Sodium sulfate is Na2SO3, which is a weak acid. Iron chloride is FeCl2. When they mix, I think Fe^3+ and SO3^2- might react. Fe^3+ is a cation, and SO3^2- is the anion. Wait, but what's the reaction here? Iron(III) sulfate and sodium sulfate? Wait, no, FeCl2 is Fe^2+ and Cl^-; Na2SO3 is Na+ and SO3^2-. So, when they mix, the possible products would be FeSO3 and NaCl. Wait, but FeCl2 and Na2SO3 don't produce FeSO3 or NaCl, because FeCl2 is Fe^2+ and Cl^-; Na2SO3 is Na+ and SO3^2-. So Fe^2+ and SO3^2- would form FeSO3, which is a precipitate? Or maybe a gas. Or maybe they don't react. Alternatively, perhaps Fe^3+ and SO3^2- would form FeSO3. But wait, FeCl2 is Fe^2+; so if Fe^2+ and SO3^2- meet, maybe FeSO3 is formed. So the reaction is between Fe^2+ and SO3^2- to form FeSO3. Then, the sodium and chloride ions are spectators. So the molecular equation would be Na2SO3 + FeCl2 → FeSO3 + 2NaCl. The ionic equation would be: Na+ (aq) + SO3^2- (aq) + Fe^2+ (aq) + 2Cl^- (aq) → FeSO3(s) + 2Na+ (aq) + 2Cl^- (aq). So the spectator ions are Na+ and Cl^-; when we cancel them, we would have Fe^2+ + SO3^2- → FeSO3. So it does have a net ionic equation. So A is a reaction, so it doesn't have a net equation. So A would be a pair that produces a net equation, so it's not the correct answer.

Option B: MgBr2 + Na2CO3. Magnesium bromide is Mg²+ and Br^-; sodium carbonate is Na2CO3 → 2Na+ + CO3^2-. Mixing them, MgCO3 is a solid, and NaBr would be a solution. So MgCO3(s) + 2NaBr(aq) → MgBr2 + Na2CO3. Wait, no, the molecular equation would be MgBr2 (aq) + Na2CO3 (aq) → MgCO3(s) + 2NaBr(aq). The ionic equation would be: Mg²+ + 2Br^- + 2Na+ + CO3^2- → MgCO3(s) + 2Na+ + 2Br^-. So the spectator ions here are Na+ and Br^-; when we cancel them, we get Mg²+ + CO3^2- → MgCO3(s). So there's a net ionic equation. So B is a reaction, so it's not the answer.

Option C: NH4I + Pb(NO3)2. NH4I dissociates into NH4+ and I^-; Pb(NO3)2 gives Pb^2+ and 2 NO3^- ions. When they mix, I^- and Pb^2+ will combine to form PbI2. Wait, but is PbI2 soluble? I think it's a bit tricky. I recall that most halides are soluble except for those with group 1 metals and some others like Pb. Hmm, PbI2 might be insoluble. So maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but wait, let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a precipitation reaction. So in this case, NH4I and Pb(NO3)2 would produce PbI2 and NH4NO3. But if PbI2 is insoluble, the reaction would proceed to form PbI2 precipitate and NH4NO3 in solution. So the molecular equation would be NH4I + Pb(NO3)2 → PbI2(s) + NH4NO3(aq). The ionic equation would be NH4+ (aq) + I^- (aq) + Pb^2+ (aq) + 2 NO3^- → PbI2(s) + NH4+ (aq) + NO3^- (aq). The spectator ions are NH4+ and NO3^-; so when we cancel them, we get I^- + Pb^2+ → PbI2(s). So there's a net ionic equation. So C is a reaction, so not the correct answer.

Option D: NaOH + HCl. NaOH and HCl react to form NaCl and water. So the molecular equation would be NaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O. The ionic equation would be Na+ + OH^- + H+ + Cl^- → Na+ + Cl^- + H2O. The spectator ions are Na+ and Cl^-. So when we cancel them, we get OH^- + H+ → H2O. This is a net ionic equation. So D is a reaction, so not the correct answer.

Option E: BaCl2 + K2SO4. BaCl2 is Ba^2+ and Cl^-; K2SO4 is 2K+ and SO4^2-. Mixing them, BaSO4 is a white precipitate, and KCl is a solution. So the molecular equation is BaCl2(aq) + K2SO4(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2 KCl(aq). The ionic equation would be Ba^2+ + 2 Cl^- + 2 K+ + SO4^2- → BaSO4(s) + 2 K+ + 2 Cl^- (from KCl). The spectator ions here are K+ and Cl^-; when we cancel those, we get Ba^2+ + SO4^2- → BaSO4(s). So the net ionic equation is that, which means E is a reaction, so not the correct answer.

Option F: Cu(NO3)2 + K2S. Copper nitrate and potassium sulfide. Cu(NO3)2 is Cu²+ and 2 NO3^-; K2S is 2 K+ and S^2-. Mixing them, CuS would precipitate, and KNO3 would be a solution. The molecular equation is Cu(NO3)2 + K2S → CuS(s) + 2 KNO3(aq). ionic equation: Cu²+ + 2 NO3^- + 2 K+ + S^2- → CuS(s) + 2 K+ + 2 NO3^- (from KNO3). So the spectator ions are K+ and NO3^-; when canceled, we get Cu²+ + S^2- → CuS(s). So a net ionic equation exists. So F is a reaction, so not the answer.

Option G: FeSO4 + NaCl. FeSO4 is Fe^2+ and SO4^2-, and NaCl is Na+ and Cl^-; when mixed, FeCl2 and Na2SO4 would form. Wait, but FeCl2 and Na2SO4 don't react? Or do they? Wait, in this case, Fe^2+ and Cl^- would form FeCl2, and Na2SO4 would produce Na+ and SO4^2-. So the molecular equation is FeSO4 + NaCl → FeCl2 + Na2SO4. Wait, but wait, the possible products would be FeCl2 and Na2SO4. Are these soluble? FeCl2 is soluble? I think most nitrates and chlorides are soluble, but sulfates can be a bit tricky. Wait, what about FeCl2 and Na2SO4? Both are soluble in water because FeCl2 is soluble (since it's a nitrate and chloride), and Na2SO4 is soluble (sulfate is soluble with group 1 and ammonium). So they would both dissociate into ions. So in the molecular equation, FeSO4 and NaCl → FeCl2 and Na2SO4. The ionic equation is Fe^2+ + SO4^2- + Na+ + Cl^- → Fe^2+ + SO4^2- + 2 Na+ + Cl^- (wait no, because Na2SO4 is 2 Na+ and SO4^2-). So the ionic equation is Fe²+ (aq) + SO4^2- (aq) + 2 Na+ (aq) + Cl^- (aq) → Fe²+ (aq) + SO4^2- (aq) + 2 Na+ (aq) + Cl^- (aq). All ions appear on both sides. So when we cancel out, nothing remains. That means there’s no net ionic equation because all ions are spectators. Therefore, the reaction doesn't proceed as written, and it's a double displacement reaction where no precipitation or other reaction occurs. So this is a case where all ions are spectators, so no net ionic equation.

Alternatively, another way to think: when FeCl2 and Na2SO4 are mixed, they form FeSO4 and NaCl. Both are soluble, so no precipitate forms. So the reaction doesn't occur, leading to no net ionic equation.

Option H: CaCl2 + MnSO4. Calcium chloride and manganese sulfate. Both are soluble in water. So their ions are Ca²+, Cl^-, Mn²+, SO4^2-. When mixed, they form CaSO4 and MnCl2. CaSO4 is insoluble, so it will precipitate. MnCl2 is soluble. So the molecular equation is CaCl2 + MnSO4 → CaSO4(s) + MnCl2(aq). The ionic equation: Ca²+ + Cl^- + Mn²+ + SO4^2- → CaSO4(s) + Mn²+ + 2 Cl^- (from MnCl2). So spectator ions are Mn²+ and Cl^-; when we cancel them, we get Ca²+ + SO4^2- → CaSO4(s). So a net ionic equation exists. So H is a reaction, not the answer.

So now, the question is which pair doesn't have a net ionic equation. So looking for a case where the molecular equation and the ionic equation are the same, meaning all ions are spectators, so no net equation.

Looking back, option G: FeSO4 + NaCl → FeCl2 + Na2SO4. Both are soluble, so no precipitate. All ions are spectators. Therefore, the reaction doesn't proceed, and the net ionic equation is empty. So this is the correct answer.

To determine which pair of reactants does not have a net ionic equation, we analyze each option by comparing the molecular equation and the corresponding ionic equation. A net ionic equation exists only if not all ions cancel out during the simplification of the ionic equation. If all ions cancel out, it means no net reaction occurs, and no net ionic equation is formed.
