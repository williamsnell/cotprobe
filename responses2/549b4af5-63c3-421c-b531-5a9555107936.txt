Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about dividing stickers equally among students. There are three packages with 56, 48, and 58 stickers each. The teacher wants to divide all of these equally among 27 students. We need to find out how many stickers each student gets.

First, I think I should find the total number of stickers. I'll add up all the stickers from the three packages. So, 56 plus 48 is... let me calculate that. 56 + 48 is 104. Then, adding the third package, which has 58 stickers. 104 plus 58 equals 162. So, there are 162 stickers in total.

Now, the teacher wants to divide these 162 stickers equally among 27 students. To find out how many each student gets, I need to divide 162 by 27. Let me do that division. 27 goes into 162 how many times? Well, 27 times 6 is 162 because 27 * 5 is 135, and adding another 27 gives 162. So, 27 multiplied by 6 equals 162. That means each student gets 6 stickers.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 27 times 6 is indeed 162, so that's correct. So, the answer should be 6 stickers per student.

The total number of stickers is 56 + 48 + 58 = 162. Dividing 162 by 27 gives 6. So, each student receives **6 stickers**.
