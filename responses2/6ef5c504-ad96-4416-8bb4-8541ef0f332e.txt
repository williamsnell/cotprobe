Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a simple pendulum with a moving support. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The problem says the pendulum has a length 'b' and a bob of mass 'm'. The support (which I assume is the string or something attached to the pivot) is moving vertically upward with a constant acceleration 'a'. We need to find the period for small oscillations. Oh, right, small oscillations probably means we can use the approximation that sin(theta) ≈ theta, so the equations simplify.

Wait, the standard simple pendulum period is 2π√(L/g), but in this case, the support isn't stationary. Since the support is moving upwards, that should affect the effective length or the effective gravitational acceleration.

I remember that when the pivot accelerates, it's like the effective gravity changes. Let me think about this. If the support is moving upward with acceleration 'a', then from the pendulum's frame of reference, it's like it's in a gravitational field where the effective 'g' is increased because gravity and the acceleration are in the same direction.

Wait, wait, no. The support is moving upward, so when the pendulum is at rest relative to the support, the support's upward acceleration would effectively make the pendulum feel a higher effective gravity. So the effective g would be g + a, because the support is accelerating upward. Does that make sense?

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The pendulum is at rest in an accelerating frame. Newton's laws in an accelerating frame: the effective gravity is g_eff = g + a, because the acceleration is acting in the same direction as gravity. Oh wait, no, no. That's when you're in an accelerating frame. But in this case, the support is moving, so the effective gravity is the vector sum of the real gravitational acceleration and the acceleration of the frame. Since the support is moving upward, the effective acceleration is g (down) plus a (up). Wait, no, wait. Let's think: the support's acceleration is upward, so from the pendulum's perspective, the effective gravity would be g + a, because the support is accelerating upward, which adds to the gravitational acceleration. Is that right?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. If the support accelerates upward, the pendulum experiences an effective force. Let me model it with F = ma. So if the support is accelerating upward with acceleration a, then the effective gravity experienced by the pendulum bob is g' = g + a, because the support's acceleration adds to the bob's acceleration.

Wait, no. No, wait! Because the support is moving up, from the pendulum's frame, it's equivalent to being in an environment where the effective gravity is g + a. Because the acceleration is in the same direction as the gravitational acceleration, so yes, the effective g is g + a. That makes sense.

So the period would be based on this effective g. But wait, for the pendulum's motion, the period is 2π√(L/g_eff), where g_eff is the effective gravitational acceleration. So in this case, g_eff would be (g + a).

Wait, but wait a second. The pendulum's length is 'b', but when the support accelerates, the length of the pendulum effectively becomes longer, right? Because the bob is moving in a circle with a larger radius. So perhaps the formula is modified.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The period in a simple pendulum is T = 2π√(L/g) where L is the length. If the effective g is different, then T would become 2π√(L/(g_eff)).

So if g_eff is (g + a), then the period would be 2π√(b/(g + a)).

Looking at the options, option J is 2π√(b/(a+g)), which matches this. But wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when you accelerate, the effective acceleration changes, but the length is measured relative to the pivot.

Wait, no. Wait, the period formula doesn't directly depend on the direction of the acceleration. It depends on the magnitude of the effective acceleration. So if the support is moving upwards with acceleration a, the effective gravity is g + a, so the period is 2π√(b/(g +a)).

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the direction. Suppose the support accelerates upward at a. So in the frame of the support, the bob feels an acceleration of g + a, because the support is moving up. So the effective g is larger than g. So the period would be shorter than the standard period, since g_eff is larger.

But looking at the options, option J is 2π√(b/(a+g)) – that matches.

Alternatively, let me think about the equation of motion. The equation for the pendulum is mθ'' = -m L (d²θ/dt²) = -m L α, where α is the angular acceleration. But when the support accelerates upward, the effective acceleration is a_eff = g + a (since the support's acceleration is in the same direction as gravity). So the equation becomes θ'' + (g + a)/L θ = 0. So the angular frequency is sqrt( (g +a)/L ), so the period is 2π sqrt(L/(g+a)).

Wait, so that would be 2π sqrt (b/(g +a)), which is option J.

Wait, but wait. Another possible consideration: the length of the pendulum. If the support is accelerating upward, the pendulum's effective length changes. Hmm, but no, the length is the distance from the pivot to the center of mass, so it's the same. So the length is 'b', regardless of the acceleration.

Wait, perhaps another way to think about this is to use the effective force. The pendulum's bob experiences a net acceleration of a_net = g + a (since the support is accelerating upward; the net acceleration is the sum because they are in the same direction). So the equation of motion for the bob is m a_net = -m L d²θ/dt². So:

a_net = (g + a) (since support is moving up, a is upward, so acceleration is g (down) + a (up) = g + a).

So equation becomes: (g + a) = -L (d²θ/dt²)

Wait, wait, perhaps this is better framed in terms of the equation of motion. Let me write it more clearly.

The net force on the bob is F = m a_net. The net acceleration is g (down) plus a (up). So a_net = (g + a) upward, but wait, actually, since the support is moving upward, the bob is also under the influence of gravity and the support's acceleration. So the net acceleration a_net is (g) (down) + (a) (up) = g - a (if a is upward). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think.

Wait, the support is moving upward with acceleration a. So the bob is moving in the same direction as the support's acceleration. So the bob's acceleration is (a) upward, plus the gravitational acceleration downward. So the net acceleration is (a - g) downward? No, wait, no. Let me think again. The support is moving upward with acceleration a, so the acceleration of the support is a upwards. So the bob's acceleration is due to the support's movement and gravity.

Wait, no, the net acceleration on the bob is the support's acceleration plus the gravitational acceleration. Wait, no. The bob's acceleration is the sum of the support's acceleration and the gravitational acceleration. But wait, the support is moving upward, so the bob's acceleration is a (up) plus g (down). So the net acceleration is (a - g) downward. Wait, but that would be negative because a is upward, so a - g is the net acceleration in the downward direction.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me write the equation using Newton's second law.

The bob has acceleration a_net = a + g. Wait, no. If the support is moving upward with acceleration a, then the bob's acceleration is due to the support's acceleration and gravity. So if the support is moving up, the bob's acceleration is a (up) plus g (down). So the net acceleration is a - g (since a is up and g down, but a is a vector of magnitude a, so if a is upward, then a is positive, and g is negative).

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think of the acceleration as a vector. The support's acceleration is a vector upward, so in the positive direction. The bob's acceleration is the sum of the support's acceleration and the bob's own acceleration due to gravity. So if the support is accelerating with acceleration a (upward, positive), then the bob's acceleration is a (up) plus g (down), which is a - g (since g is downward, negative if up is positive). So the net acceleration is (a - g) upward? No, wait no. Because if a is upward, then the net acceleration is a (up) + g (down): net acceleration is a - g if a and g are in opposite directions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the coordinate system. Let me take down as positive. Then, the support's acceleration is a (positive), and the bob's acceleration is a (up) plus g (down). So a_net = a (since up is positive) plus (-g) (because it's in the opposite direction). So a_net = a - g.

Wait, but a is the acceleration of the support. So if the support is moving upward, a is positive. So the net acceleration is a (up) plus (-g), so a_net = a - g. So the acceleration is (a - g) upwards.

Wait, but then the equation of motion is m a_net = -m L θ'' (assuming the restoring force is -m L θ'' in the equation). So a_net is (a - g) upward, which is the acceleration of the bob. So equation is:

(a - g) = - L θ''.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because in the standard pendulum, the restoring force is -m L θ'' = m a_net. So:

m a_net = m L θ''_restoring (which is - θ'' * L).

Wait, no, perhaps the equation is m a_net = - m L θ''. So a_net is (a - g). So:

(a - g) = - L θ''.

Which rearranges to:

θ'' = (g - a)/L * θ.

So the angular acceleration is proportional to θ, which is the equation of simple harmonic motion. The angular frequency ω is sqrt( (g - a)/L ), so the period T is 2π / sqrt( (g - a)/L ) = 2π sqrt( L/(g -a) ).

Wait a minute, but earlier I thought that the effective acceleration was (g +a), but this approach leads to (g - a). So which is correct? Hmm, I'm getting conflicting results. I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the acceleration correctly. The pendulum's bob is moving with an acceleration due to the support's movement and gravity. If the support is moving upward, then the bob's acceleration is a (up) plus g (down). So the net acceleration is a - g (since a is in the same direction as g? No, wait, a is upward, and g is downward. So net acceleration is a - g (since a is upward, which is positive, and g is downward, which is negative. So net acceleration is a - g. So the equation is a_net = a - g.

Wait, but in the equation of motion, the acceleration is a_net = - L θ'' (assuming it's a restoring force). So:

a - g = - L θ''.

Wait, that would mean theta'' = (g - a)/L * theta.

So the angular frequency ω is sqrt( (g - a)/L ), so T = 2π sqrt(L/(g -a)).

But wait, this is different from the previous approach which considered the effective g as (g +a), but here it's (g -a).

Hmm. Now I'm getting confused. Which approach is correct?

Wait, another way to think about this: when a support accelerates upward, it's like the bob is in an effective gravitational field of g_eff = g + a. Because the support's acceleration adds to the bob's acceleration. So the pendulum's period would be 2pi sqrt(L/(g_eff)).

But according to the equation above, that would be 2pi sqrt( L/(g + a) ), which would match option J. But earlier approach gave me 2pi sqrt( L/(g - a) ), which would match option I.

So which is correct? Let me think of a simple example. If the support is not moving, a = 0, then the period is 2pi sqrt(L/g), which is correct. If the support is moving upward with acceleration a, then the effective g becomes g +a, so the period is 2pi sqrt( L/(g +a) ), which matches option J. So perhaps option J is correct.

Wait, but in the second approach, where the net acceleration is (a -g), the equation gives theta'' = (g -a)/L * theta, which gives omega = sqrt( (g -a)/L ), so T=2pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which would be option I.

But wait, no. Because in the equation, a_net is (a -g), so a_net = (a) (up) + (-g) (down) = a -g. So the equation is a_net = - L theta''.

So a_net = (a -g) = - L theta'' => theta'' = (g -a)/L * theta.

So the angular frequency is sqrt( (g -a)/L ), so T = 2pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which is option I.

But wait, how is this possible? Because when a support accelerates upward, the effective gravitational field increases, so the pendulum's period should decrease (because it's easier to oscillate). So if the period is T = 2pi sqrt(L/(g -a)), then when a increases, the denominator increases, so T decreases, which makes sense.

Alternatively, if the support is accelerating downward, a is negative, so the denominator would be (g - a) = g + |a|, so the period would be longer, which is correct because the pendulum would have a longer period.

Wait, but when the support accelerates upward, the effective g is higher, so the period should be shorter. So our approach is correct.

So why the discrepancy between the two approaches?

Wait, the problem is that whether the support is moving upward or downward, the pendulum's effective g depends on the direction of the acceleration. So in the problem statement, the support is moving upward with acceleration a, so the pendulum's effective g is g + a, because the support's acceleration adds to the pendulum's acceleration. Thus, the period becomes 2pi sqrt( L/(g +a) ), which is option J.

But earlier calculation (when the net acceleration is (a -g)) gave a different result. Now I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Why?

Ah, perhaps I messed up the equation of motion.

Let me rederive. The net force on the bob is F = m a_net. The equation of motion is F = m a_net.

a_net is the acceleration of the bob, which is due to the support's acceleration and gravity.

So if the support is accelerating upward with acceleration a, then the bob's acceleration is a (up) plus g (down) = a - g (if g is downward). So a_net = a - g.

Thus, F = m (a - g ) = m L theta'' (assuming the restoring force is -m L theta'' ), so:

a - g = - L theta''.

Rearranged: theta'' = (g -a)/L theta.

So the angular frequency omega is sqrt( (g -a)/L ), so the period is T = (2pi) / omega = 2pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which is option I.

But wait, now I'm getting two different expressions. So perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.

Wait, let me think again. The pendulum's equation of motion is m a_net = - m L theta''.

But a_net is the acceleration of the bob due to the support's motion and gravity.

So if the support is moving upward with acceleration a, then the bob's acceleration is a (up) plus g (down) = a - g (since a is up, g is down, so a - g is the net acceleration in the positive direction (up)).

So a_net = a - g.

Thus, m (a - g) = - m L theta''.

Divide both sides by m: (a -g) = - L theta''

Rearranged: theta'' = (g -a)/L theta.

So the equation is theta'' = ( (g - a)/L ) theta.

Which is the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator with angular frequency omega = sqrt( (g -a)/L ), so period T = 2pi / omega = 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ).

So according to this calculation, the period is T = 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which is option I.

Wait, but earlier I thought the effective g is (g + a), leading to option J. But which is correct?

Wait a mistake. Think of it this way: if the support accelerates upward, the effective acceleration is g + a. Because the bob is acted upon by the support's acceleration (which is in the same direction as g) and the bob's own weight. So the net acceleration is (a + g) upward. Wait, that doesn't make sense because a is upward, so the net acceleration is (a - g) upward.

Wait, perhaps the problem arises from the choice of coordinate system. Let's take down as positive.

The support's acceleration is a (positive, up).

The bob's acceleration is a (up) plus g (down) → a - g.

So in the equation F = m a_net, a_net is a - g.

So F = m (a - g) = m L theta'' (since the restoring force is -m L theta'' )

So (a - g) = -L theta''

→ theta'' = (g - a)/L theta.

Thus, the angular frequency is omega = sqrt( (g -a)/L ), so T = 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which is option I.

But earlier, when I thought the effective g is (g +a), I thought that would lead to option J. But that would be incorrect because the net acceleration is (a - g), not (a +g). So the correct approach is option I.

So going back to the problem, the period is T = 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which is option I.

Wait, but let me check the problem statement again. The problem says the support is moving vertically upwards with acceleration a. So the support is moving upward, so the bob's acceleration is a (up) + g (down) = a - g, as before.

So the equation of motion is theta'' = (g - a)/L * theta.

Thus, the angular frequency is sqrt( (g -a)/L ), so the period is T= 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which matches option I.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the initial options I thought of. Because the problem is presented in a way that the period is determined by the effective acceleration. So according to this, the correct option is I.

But wait, wait, another approach. Let's model the acceleration in the frame of the support.

In the support's frame, the bob is accelerated by the support's acceleration (a upward) and by gravity (g downward). So the net acceleration is a - g (upward). So the equation of motion is a_net = - L theta''.

So a_net is (a -g) up.

So (a -g) = - L theta''.

Then, theta'' = (g - a)/L theta.

So omega = sqrt( (g - a)/L ), so T= 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which is option I.

So the correct answer is option I.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the effective g as (g +a), I also thought that the period would be option J. But that must have been wrong because the net acceleration is (a -g), not (g + a).

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the equation of motion. Let me consider the frame of the support.

In this frame, the bob is subject to two accelerations: the support's acceleration (a upward), and gravity (g downward). So the net acceleration of the bob is a_net = a (up) + g (down) = a - g (up).

So the equation of motion in the frame of the support is theta'' = (g -a)/L theta.

Because a_net = - L theta''.

So a_net = (a - g) = - L theta''.

So theta'' = (g -a)/L theta.

Thus, the angular frequency is omega = sqrt( (g -a)/L ), so period T= 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which is option I.

So the correct answer is option I.

But wait, wait. Another way to think about this is to see what happens when a is zero. Then the period should be 2 pi sqrt( L/g ), which is correct and matches option J. So when a is zero, option J is correct.

When a is positive (support accelerates upward), the effective g increases, so the period should decrease. So if a is positive, then the denominator in option J is larger than when a is zero, so the period would be smaller, which matches expectations.

But based on the equation in the frame of the support, the period is 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which is option I.

So which is correct? It's a matter of interpretation.

Wait, but if the support is accelerating upward, the pendulum's effective g increases, making the period shorter. So when a increases, the denominator (g -a) increases, so the period decreases.

So the correct formula is T= 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which is option I.

So the correct answer is option I, which is not listed in the options I thought of earlier.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: 2π√(L/g)

B: 2π√(L/(g+a))

C: 2π√(L/(g−a))

D: 2π√(b/(g−a))

E: 2π√(b/(g+a))

Wait, none of the options I thought of match what I derived. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is T = 2 pi sqrt(L/(g + a)), which would be option J.

But according to the equation in the frame of the support, the period is 2 pi sqrt(L/(g -a)), which is option I.

So which is correct?

Hmmm.

I think the confusion arises from the frame of reference. Let me model the equation of motion in the frame of the support.

In the support's frame, the bob is subject to two accelerations: the support's acceleration (a upward) and gravity (g downward).

So the net acceleration of the bob is:

a_net = a (up) + g (down) = a - g (up).

So F = m a_net = m (a - g).

But F is also equal to m L theta'' (assuming the restoring force is -m L theta'').

So,

m (a - g) = - m L theta''.

Divide both sides by m:

a - g = - L theta''.

Rearranged:

theta'' = (g - a)/L theta.

So the angular frequency omega is sqrt( (g -a)/L ), so the period T is 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which is option I.

Wait, but this approach gives option I, which is not one of the initial options I thought of. So perhaps the correct answer is option I.

But the problem is presented in a way that the options don't include option I. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem states: "A massless string is attached to the bob. The bob is hanging below. The support is moving upward with acceleration a. Find the period."

Wait, looking at the options, option I is 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which is the one we arrived at. So that must be the correct option.

But wait, let me think again. Because I'm getting conflicting results. So perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of the effective gravitational field.

If the support is moving upward, the effective gravitational acceleration increases. So the period would be shorter. So if the period is 2 pi sqrt( L/(g +a) ), that would be option J. But according to the frame of the support, the period is 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which is option I.

So which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the frame of reference. Let me think of the equation of motion in the frame of the pendulum bob, which is not the frame of the support.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is better approached by considering the pendulum's acceleration in the frame of the support.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the pendulum's motion in the frame of the support, where the support is accelerating upward. So in this frame, the pendulum's motion is affected by the support's acceleration and the pendulum's own acceleration.

So the equation of motion is a_net = a (up) + g (down) = a - g (up).

So the equation is F = m a_net = m (a - g).

But F is also equal to m L theta'' (restoring force).

So,

(a -g) = - L theta''.

Thus,

theta'' = (g -a)/L theta.

Angular frequency omega is sqrt( (g -a)/L ), so T = 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which is option I.

Therefore, the correct answer is option I.

Wait, but this doesn't match any of the options I thought of earlier. So perhaps the correct answer is option I, which is not listed in the options. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the equation of motion. Let me rederive it correctly.

In the frame of the support, the pendulum bob is subjected to two accelerations: the support's acceleration (a upward) and the bob's own acceleration due to gravity (g downward). So the net acceleration of the bob is a_net = a (up) + g (down) = a - g (up). So the equation of motion is:

F = m a_net = m (a - g).

The restoring force is - m L theta'' (assuming upward is positive, so restoring force is towards the pivot, which is negative).

So,

m (a - g) = - m L theta''.

Divide both sides by m:

(a - g) = - L theta''.

Rearrange:

theta'' = (g - a)/L theta.

Which is the equation of simple harmonic motion with angular frequency omega = sqrt( (g - a)/L ), so period T = 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which is option I.

So according to this, the correct answer is option I.

But wait, the problem options include option I as option C. Let me check.

Wait, the options are as follows:

A: 2π√(L/g)

B: 2π√(L/(g+a))

C: 2π√(L/(g−a))

D: 2π√(b/(g−a))

E: 2π√(b/(g+a))

So option C is 2π sqrt( L/(g−a) ), which is exactly what I arrived at. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought that the effective g is (g +a), I mistakenly thought that's option J, which is correct. So the correct derivation leads to option C, which is option I.

So the correct answer is option C, which is option I in the given options.

So the correct answer is option C, which is 2π√(L/(g−a)).

But wait, I'm a bit confused because when the support is moving upward, the effective g increases, so the period should decrease. So if the period is 2π sqrt( L/(g−a) ), then as a increases, the period decreases, which matches expectations.

Yes, that makes sense.

So the correct answer is option C, which is option I in the given options.

Wait, but the problem states that the support is moving upward with acceleration a. So the correct formula should be option C, which is 2π sqrt( L/(g−a) ), which is option I in the given options.

So the correct answer is option C.

But wait, no. Let me re-examine the options. The options are:

A: 2π√(L/g)

B: 2π√(L/(g+a))

C: 2π√(L/(g−a))

D: 2π√(b/(g−a))

E: 2π√(b/(g+a))

So option C is 2π sqrt( L/(g−a) ), which is the correct formula.

So the correct answer is option C, which is option I in the given options.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation because the equation of motion in the frame of the support is F = m a_net = m (a - g). But the restoring force is -m L theta''. So:

m (a - g) = - m L theta''.

Divide both sides by m:

(a - g) = - L theta''.

Rearranged:

theta'' = (g -a)/L theta.

Thus, the angular frequency is sqrt( (g -a)/L ), so the period is 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ), which is option C.

So the correct answer is option C.

But wait, the initial formula in the frame of the support gives us option C as the correct answer.

So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake because when the support is moving upward, the effective g is (g + a), which would make the period shorter, which doesn't match the initial formula I thought of.

Wait, no. The correct formula is option C, which is 2 pi sqrt( L/(g -a) ).

Thus, the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves a pendulum with a bob of mass \( m \), suspended from a support that is accelerating upward with acceleration \( a \). The goal is to determine the period of oscillation for small displacements.

### Key Analysis

1. **Equation of Motion in the Frame of the Support**:
   - In the frame of the support, the bob experiences two accelerations: the support's upward acceleration \( a \) and the bob's downward acceleration due to gravity \( g \).
   - The net acceleration of the bob in this frame is \( a_{\text{net}} = a - g \) (upward).

2. **Restoring Force and Equation of Motion**:
   - The restoring force acting on the bob is proportional to the angular displacement \( \theta \), given by \( F = -mL\theta'' \), where \( L \) is the length of the pendulum.
   - Applying Newton's second law, \( F = m_{\text{net}}a_{\text{net}} \), we have:
     \[
     m_{\text{net}}a_{\text{net}} = mL\theta''
     \]
     Substituting \( a_{\text{net}} = a - g \), we get:
     \[
     (a - g) = -L\theta''
     \]
     Rearranging:
     \[
     \theta'' = \frac{g - a}{L}\theta
     \]

3. **Angular Frequency and Period**:
   - The angular frequency \( \omega \) is given by:
     \[
     \omega = \sqrt{\frac{g - a}{L}}
     \]
   - The period \( T \) is the angular frequency's inverse:
     \[
     T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g - a}}
     \]

4. **Matching with Options**:
   - The derived formula \( T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g - a}} \) corresponds to **Option C**.

### Conclusion
