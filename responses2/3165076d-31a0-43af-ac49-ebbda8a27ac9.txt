Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question about circuits. The question says that as more lamps are connected in a series circuit, what happens to the current in the power source. The options are A through J, with the correct answer being E: decreases. But wait, I'm not entirely sure, so I need to think it through carefully.

First, I remember that in a series circuit, the current is the same throughout the entire circuit. That means the current doesn't change whether you have one lamp or multiple lamps connected in series. So regardless of how many lamps are added, the current remains constant. That would make option E correct.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me recall Ohm's Law, which is V = IR. In a series circuit, the total voltage (V) is the sum of the voltages across each component. If more lamps are added, each lamp would have its own voltage drop. But the current (I) should stay the same because the same power source is providing the same voltage for each lamp. So even if more lamps are in the circuit, each lamp's current is the same as the others and the main current. 

So the number of lamps doesn't affect the current; it doesn't decrease, it stays the same. Therefore, the correct answer is E: decreases? Wait, no—wait, the current doesn't change. So the answer should be E: remains the same. 

Looking back at the options, option E is "decreases"—so that would be incorrect. The current doesn't decrease; it stays the same. So the correct answer is E: remains the same. So the answer is E.

The current remains the same in a series circuit when more lamps are added. 

Answer: E: remains the same
