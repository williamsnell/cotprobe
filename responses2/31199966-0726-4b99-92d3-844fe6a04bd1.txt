Question:

After his 16th birthday, a youth decided to purchase a new sports car from a dealership for the sales price of $36,000. The youth thereafter entered into a written contract with the dealership, which provided that the youth would make monthly payments of $1,000 for three years. During the first year of the contract, the youth made 12 monthly payments totaling $12,000. However, the youth failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The dealership repeatedly threatened to sue the youth for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. Finally, in order to avoid litigation, the youth sent the dealership the following letter:"The car I purchased from you is a real lemon. I have spent a considerable sum of money during the last two years in repair work. I don't believe that the car is worth $36,000, but I am willing to pay you $10,000 if I find ajob in the next month. "The youth had just turned 18 when he sent this letter to the dealership. The day after mailing this letter, the youth was involved in an automobile accident, and the sports car was totally demolished. Following the accident, the youth remained unemployed, and he refused to make any payments to the dealership. At the time of the accident, the sports car was worth $18,000. In this jurisdiction, the age of majority is18 years of age. If the dealership brings suit against the youth for breach of contract, what, if any, is the plaintiff's proper recovery?

Options:

A: $36,000.00
B: $10,000. 00
C: $18,000. 00
D: The cost of repair work the youth has done on the car.
E: $30,000.00
F: Nothing.
G: $12,000.00
H: The cost of the car at the time of purchase minus the payments made so far.
I: $6,000.00

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read it again carefully.

The situation is that a youth buys a sports car for $36,000. He makes monthly payments of $1,000 for three years. So that's 36 payments total, each $1k, totaling $36k. The youth failed to pay the first year, making $12k, and didn't pay the second year either, so he made 12 payments that year, totaling $12k in two years. So he only paid $12k of the $36k contract, which is 33.3% of the total.

Then, the dealership threatened to sue him for the remaining balance. But the youth sent a letter saying the car is a lemon, he spent money in repair, and is willing to pay $10k if he gets a job next month. The car was worth $18k when he sent the letter, but after the accident, it was totally demolished and worth $0. He was unemployed and didn't pay anymore.

The question is what the plaintiff can recover if the dealership sues him for breach of contract. The options are A to I, with various amounts and options about costs of repairs.

Wait, so the issue is whether the youth is liable for the contract. The contract was a written contract with monthly payments. He failed to pay the first two years, but then he made a conditional offer to pay $10k if he gets a job. So, I think the key here is whether the contract was breached, and what the contract entailed.

If the contract is a written one with fixed terms, then the youth might be liable for the full amount if he didn't pay the contract as agreed. But in this case, he didn't pay all the installments. So, perhaps he's not liable for the $36k, because he didn't make all the payments. Alternatively, maybe the contract is breached because he didn't pay for the entire contract.

Wait, but the contract was for $36k over three years, monthly payments of $1k. He made 12 in the first year, then 12 in the second, so 24 total. So, he didn't pay the remaining 12 payments. So, under contract law, if the contract says to pay a certain amount, and he doesn't pay all, he's not liable. So he can't recover the full $36k.

But wait, the issue is whether the contract was breached and if the amount he paid is recoverable. Alternatively, perhaps the contract is considered a suretyty or a surety bond, but the problem says it's a written contract with fixed payments, so probably not surety.

He sent a letter offering to pay $10k if he gets a job. So perhaps that's a conditional promise, which may be enforceable. But the main issue is whether the contract was breached. So if he didn't pay the full installments, he's not liable.

But another angle: the contract was for $36k, but the youth only paid $12k. So he's been paying for two years, but not three. So, perhaps the contract is for a certain period, and he's only been making payments for two years. So, the total contract term is three years, meaning three years of payments. So, 36k total.

So, the total amount he can recover is the $36k if he breached the contract. But he didn't pay the full amount, so he isn't liable for that. So he can't recover $36k.

But the options don't include $36k being a choice, so perhaps that's not an option. Wait, looking at the options, option A is $36,000.00. Option B is $10,000.00. So, if the contract was breached, he can't recover the full $36k, but perhaps the interest or other amounts.

Alternatively, perhaps the contract is a surety bond, but I don't think that's the case here. The contract is for the purchase price, with fixed payments. So he's not liable for the $36k. But if the contract was a written agreement, the amount he paid so far is $24k (12+12), and the remaining is $12k. So he's not paying all, so he can't recover for the entire amount.

Alternatively, perhaps the contract is considered a surety agreement, but I don't think that applies here because the problem states it's a written contract.

Another angle: The car was worth $18k when he sent the letter. But in reality, it's now worth $0. So, perhaps the value of the car at the time of the contract was $18k, but the contract is for $36k. So, the car's value is irrelevant to the contract; the contract is for the purchase price, regardless of the car's current value.

So, the contract is a surety contract? Or just a written contract with fixed payments. I think in this case, the contract is a written contract with fixed amounts, so the youth is not liable for the full $36k. Instead, he can only recover the amount he paid, which is $24k. But looking at the options, there's no $24k option. The options are A: $36k, B: $10k, etc.

Wait, perhaps the issue is whether the contract is enforceable. If the contract was written, it's enforceable, but if the youth didn't pay all installments, he isn't liable for the total. But the options don't have a $24k or $12k option. But what about the options given?

Let me re-read the options:

A: $36,000.00. — He's not liable for the full amount.

B: $10,000. — He can't get more than that.

C: $18,000. — The car was worth that when he sent the letter, but it's now worth $0.

D: Cost of repair work. — The problem doesn't mention any repair costs, so the cost would be zero, perhaps.

E: $30,000.00. — Maybe a sum of payments plus something.

F: Nothing. — Maybe if he can't recover anything.

G: $12,000. — He paid that, but the problem says he failed to pay the second year as well.

H: Cost of the car at the time minus payments. — So, $18k minus $24k? That would be negative, which doesn't make sense.

But the options don't include $24k. So perhaps the correct answer is F: Nothing. But why would the court not find him liable for the amount he's paid so far?

Wait, perhaps the issue is whether the contract was breached and the amount is recoverable. So, the contract was for $36k, but he only paid $24k. So, he can't recover the full amount, but perhaps the contract says that the contract is for the purchase price, and any payments beyond the agreed amount are considered as a breach.

Alternatively, perhaps the contract is for the car's purchase price and the payments are due. So, he's not making all the payments, so the contract is breached.

In that case, the amount he paid so far is $24k, which is less than the total. So, he's not liable for the full $36k. But since the options don't have $24k, but option E is $30k. Hmm.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, in some jurisdictions, if you fail to pay the contract and then you have a right to recover the amount you paid, but if you can't, then your recovery is limited to the amount you paid, but perhaps some other conditions. Alternatively, maybe the court can't recover any amount because the contract is enforceable, but there's a breach, which would mean the amount is recoverable.

Wait, but the problem states that the youth sent this letter, which is a conditional promise to pay. So, that might be enforceable as a conditional breach. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the court will find that the contract is not breached because the payments are made. Wait, but the contract was a written agreement with fixed payments—so if he didn't pay all, he's not liable.

Another angle: the contract is for the purchase price, so the amount he can recover is the purchase price. But he didn't pay all the installments, so he can't get the full $36k. So, he can't recover that. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the court will find that the contract is enforceable, and the amount he can recover is the amount he paid, which is $24k. But the options don't have that either. Hmm.

Wait, but the options include F: Nothing. So, maybe the court says he's not liable for any amount because he's breaching the contract. Alternatively, perhaps the contract is enforceable, and he can't recover anything, because the contract is for a fixed amount that he didn't pay, so he's not liable.

Alternatively, the problem is that the contract was for a certain period, and he's only made two years of payments. So, the third year's payments are due, but he didn't make them. So, the contract is breached, and the amount is recoverable.

But if the contract is for $36k and he didn't pay the third year's $12k, the total he hasn't paid is $12k. So, perhaps he's only responsible for the remaining $12k, but the options don't have that.

Wait, but the options are A to I. Let's look again.

Looking at the options:

A: $36,000.00 — He's not liable for that.

B: $10,000.00 — Perhaps the amount he paid so far is $24k, but 10k isn't relevant.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The contract is for $36k, but he didn't pay the full amount. So, the total he's responsible for is $36k. But he only paid $24k. So, he can recover the amount he paid, which is $24k, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps it's the amount he paid in two years, which is $24k, but again, not an option.

Wait, the options don't include $24k. So perhaps the only option is F: nothing.

Another thought: If the contract is a written one with fixed payments, he's only liable for the amount he has paid. So, he paid $24k, so he's not liable for that, but perhaps the contract is for the total purchase price, which is $36k, but he's not liable for that either.

Wait, but in that case, the correct answer would be F: nothing, because he's not liable for the full $36k, but he's only paid $24k. So, he can't recover anything because the contract is enforceable. However, the options don't include $24k, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the court will not find him liable because he failed to make payments, so he can't recover anything. So, the answer is F: nothing.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again: If a contract is for $36k, and he didn't make all the payments, then he's not liable for the entire amount. So, he can only recover the amount he paid, which is $24k. But if the options don't have that, then perhaps the answer is F: nothing. Because he can't get anything back. Alternatively, maybe he can recover the amount he paid but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the contract is only for the purchase price, and the payments are part of that. So, if he didn't pay the installments, he's not liable for any of them. So, he can't recover anything. So, the answer would be F: nothing.

But another factor: the contract is for the purchase price, so the payments are part of that. So, if he failed to pay the installments, he's not liable for any of the payments. Therefore, he can't recover any amount. So, the answer would be F.

Wait, but that's the case if the contract is for the purchase price, and the payments are part of that. So, he's only responsible for the purchase price. But in that scenario, he's not liable for any of the payments he made, so he can't recover anything. So, the correct answer is F: nothing.

Alternatively, perhaps he's only liable for the payments made so far, but that would include the payments in the third year. But the problem says he failed to make any payments during the second year, so he only paid 24k so far.

So perhaps the answer is F: nothing, because the contract is for $36k, but he didn't pay all. So, he can't recover anything.

Wait, but the options don't have F as $24k or any other amount, so the only other option is F: nothing.

Alternatively, perhaps the contract's terms don't allow for recovery of the payments, so the answer is F.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach.

The contract says he will make $1,000 a month for three years. He failed to make any payments in the first two years. So, in the third year, he has to make another 12 payments of $1k each, totaling $12k. So, he's only paid 24k, so he's not covered for the third year's payments. 

Under contract law, if the contract is for the purchase price and the payments are due, and he hasn't made them, he's not liable for the payments. So, the total he's responsible for is $36k, but he's only paid $24k. So, he's not liable for the entire amount. Therefore, he can't recover $36k. However, the options don't have that, so perhaps the correct answer is F: nothing.

But wait, what about the options? Let me look again.

Options:

A: $36,000.00 — He's not liable for that.

B: $10,000.00 — Maybe a sum of payments, but he paid $24k.

C: $18,000.00 — The car's current value, but the contract was for purchase price.

D: Cost of repair work the youth has done on the car — No repair work mentioned.

E: $30,000.00 — Maybe sum of payments plus interest.

F: Nothing.

G: $12,000.00 — He paid that.

H: Cost of the car at the time of purchase minus payments.

I: $6,000.00.

So, the options don't have $24k or any of the other payments except F. So, if I'm correct, the answer should be F: nothing. Because he's not liable for any of the payments. But wait, option E is $30,000, which is $24k plus $6k. But why would the court give that as an option?

Alternatively, perhaps the court will find that the youth is not liable for any payments, but he can recover the amount he paid, which is $24k. But the problem is, none of the options have that. So, the only option that says he can't recover anything is F: nothing.

Wait, another possibility: Since the youth failed to make any payments in the second year, and the contract is for three years, the third year's payments are due but not made. So, the contract is breached, and the amount is recoverable. However, the options don't have the $12k or $24k amounts. So, perhaps the court won't find him liable for any payments, and thus he can't recover anything, so the answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps the court will find that the payments are required, so he can't recover anything, which would mean F.

So, given the options, the answer is F: nothing.
</think>

The youth purchased a sports car for $36,000 and agreed to monthly payments of $1,000 for three years, totaling $36k. However, he failed to make any payments during the first two years, meaning he only paid $24k in total. The dealership threatened to sue for the remaining balance, but the youth sent a letter claiming the car was a real lemon, willing to pay $10,000 if he finds a job. The car's value at the time of the letter was $18k, but it is now totally demolished.

Under contract law, the youth is not liable for the remaining payments because he failed to make them. The contract was for the purchase price of $36k, and the payments are part of that. The youth's failure to make payments during the second year breaches the contract, but the contract does not require the youth to pay for the remaining payments. The court will not find him liable for any payments because the contract is enforceable, but the youth can only recover the amount he paid, which is $24k. However, none of the options provided reflect this amount.

Given the options provided, the correct answer is **F: Nothing**, because the youth is not liable for any payments, and the contract does not require recovery of the payments.

ANSWER: F
