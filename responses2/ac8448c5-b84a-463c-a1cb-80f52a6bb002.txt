Okay, so I've got this machine learning question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says there's a machine learning problem with four attributes plus a class. Each attribute has 3, 2, 2, and 2 possible values, respectively. The class has 3 possible values. They're asking for the maximum possible different examples.

Hmm, I need to calculate the total number of possible examples. Wait, each example is a combination of the attribute values and the class outcome. So, for each example, it's a tuple where the first part is the attribute values, and the second is the class.

So, the number of possible examples would be the product of the number of possible values for each attribute multiplied by the number of class options. Because each attribute can vary independently, right?

Let me break it down. The first attribute has 3 values, the second 2, third 2, fourth 2. So the total number of attribute combinations is 3 * 2 * 2 * 2. The class has 3 options.

Let me compute that: 3 * 2 is 6, times another 2 is 12, times another 2 is 24. So that's 24 attribute combinations. Then multiply by 3 class options. 24 * 3 = 72.

Wait, but wait a minuteâ€”the question says "maximum possible different examples." Oh, right, so each attribute choice is unique. So for each attribute, the possible values are fixed, but all possible combinations are considered. So yeah, 3*2*2*2 =24 for the attributes, 3 classes. 24 *3 =72.

Looking at the options, option C is 60, D is 24, etc. Wait, 72 isn't an option. Hmm. Wait, looking again at the options:

Options:

A: 36
B: 144
C: 60
D: 24
E: 216
F: 12
G: 72
H: 48
I: 108
J: 96

Oh wait, I see, C is 60, which is different. Did I make a mistake? Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate. 3 *2 *2 *2. 3*2 is 6, 6*2 is 12, 12 *2 is 24. So attribute combinations are 24. Multiply by 3 class options: 24 *3=72. So 72 is the total possible examples.

But the options don't have 72. Wait, looking again, option C is 60. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, maybe I misread the number of attributes. Let me check the question again. It says four attributes plus a class. So 4 attributes, as I thought.

Wait, maybe the question is about the product of the number of possible values for each attribute, then multiplied by the number of class options. So (3*2*2*2) *3.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the class isn't part of the product for the examples. Wait, no, each example is an attribute combination plus a class value. So, yes, I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, but the options don't have 72. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Oh wait! Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says four attributes plus a class. Maybe the four attributes are each individual variables, and the class is a separate category.

So, each example is a combination of the four attribute values and the class. So, the number of possible examples would be (number of attribute combinations) * (number of class options). So, 24 *3=72.

But none of the options is 72. So perhaps I've misread the number of attribute options.

Wait, the problem states: "four attributes plus a class." The attributes have 3, 2, 2, 2 possible values each. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, looking at the options again, option G is 72. Oh wait, that's in the options. Let me check again.

Options:

A: 36

B: 144

C: 60

D: 24

E: 216

F: 12

G: 72

H: 48

I: 108

J: 96

So, option G is 72. So that's the answer. So why did I think 72 isn't an option? Oh wait, wait, let me think again. Did I calculate the attribute combinations correctly?

3 (first) * 2 (second) * 2 (third) * 2 (fourth) = 3 * (2^3) = 3 *8=24. So 24 attribute combinations.

Multiply by 3 class options: 24 *3=72. So 72 total possible examples.

So, option G is 72. So the correct answer should be G, which is 72.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see that option G is 72, so that's the one.

The question involves calculating the maximum number of possible different examples given four attributes with varying possible values and a class with possible values. Each example is a combination of attribute values and class outcomes. The calculation is as follows:

- **Attribute combinations**: 3 (first) * 2 (second) * 2 (third) * 2 (fourth) = 24.
- **Class options**: 3.
- **Total examples**: 24 (attribute combinations) * 3 (class options) = 72.

The correct answer is 72, which corresponds to option G.
