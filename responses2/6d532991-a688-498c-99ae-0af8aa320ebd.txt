Okay, so I'm trying to solve this mean salary problem. Let me see what it says. The company has two offices, New Jersey and Utah. The mean salary for New Jersey is $28,500, and for Utah, it's $22,500. There are 128 assistants in New Jersey and 32 in Utah. I need to find the overall mean salary for all the office assistants.

Hmm, I remember that the mean is calculated by adding up all the values and then dividing by the number of values. So, for the company as a whole, I need to find the total salary paid to all the office assistants and then divide by the total number of assistants.

First, I'll calculate the total salary for each office. For New Jersey, it's 128 assistants times $28,500 each. Let me compute that. 128 * 28,500. Let me break that down. 100 * 28,500 is 2,850,000. 28 * 28,500 is, wait, 28 times 28,500. Let me think. 28 * 28,500 = 28 * 28,500. Oh wait, 28,500 * 28 is equal to 28,500 * 20 + 28,500 * 8 = 570,000 + 228,000 = 798,000. So 128 * 28,500 is 2,850,000 + 798,000 = 3,648,000. 

Then for Utah, it's 32 assistants times $22,500 each. Let me calculate that. 32 * 22,500. Well, 30 * 22,500 is 675,000, and 2 * 22,500 is 45,000. So 675k +45k = 720,000.

Now, the total salary for both offices is 3,648,000 + 720,000. Let me add those. 3,648,000 + 720,000 = 4,368,000.

Next, I need the total number of assistants. There are 128 in New Jersey and 32 in Utah. So 128 + 32 = 160.

Now, the mean salary is the total salary divided by the number of people. So 4,368,000 divided by 160.

Hmm, let's calculate that. 4,368,000 / 160. Let me see. 160 * 27,300 = 4,368,000. Because 160 * 27,300 = 160 * 27,000 = 4,320,000 plus 160*300=48,000. So 4,320,000 +48,000=4,368,000. So the mean is $27,300.

Looking at the options, option H is $27,300. So the answer should be H.

To find the mean salary for all office assistants in the company, we calculate the total salary for each office and then find the overall average.

1. **Total salary for New Jersey**:
   - Number of assistants: 128
   - Mean salary: $28,500
   - Total = 128 * $28,500 = $3,648,000

2. **Total salary for Utah**:
   - Number of assistants: 32
   - Mean salary: $22,500
   - Total = 32 * $22,500 = $720,000

3. **Overall total salary**:
   - Sum of New Jersey and Utah totals: $3,648,000 + $720,000 = $4,368,000

4. **Total number of assistants**:
   - 128 (New Jersey) + 32 (Utah) = 160

5. **Mean salary for the company**:
   - Mean = Total salary / Total number = $4,368,000 / 160 = $27,300

The mean salary paid to the office assistants is $27,300.
