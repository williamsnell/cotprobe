Okay, so I need to figure out Lake's distributable net income based on the information given. Let's see... I've studied a bit about trusts and income, so I'll try to recall the relevant concepts.

From what I remember, distributable net income is calculated by taking the income reported on the trust and subtracting all expenses. But wait, there are two types of income mentioned here: taxable interest income and other income. So, maybe I should separate those out.

The trust has two types of income: Dividend income and Taxable interest income. Then there are expenses: Accounting fees and Trustee fees. All these are allocated to the income, meaning each item is treated as a separate category in terms of allocation.

So, first step: list all the income and expenses. 

The income items are:
- Dividend income: $2500
- Taxable interest income: $2000

Expenses are:
- Accounting fees: $500 (allocated to income)
- Trustee fees: $750 (allocated to income)

Wait, but wait. I should clarify whether the taxable interest income is considered income or an expense. Typically, taxable interest income is treated as income, so it's part of the income amount. On the other hand, expenses like Accounting fees and Trustee fees are subtracted from the income.

So, to compute net income, I think the formula is:

Net Income = (Income) - (Expenses)

But I should consider if there are any allocations. Oh right, all expenses are allocated to income. So, I don't need to adjust the income for allocations; it's straightforward.

Wait, but wait again. I remember that for some items, like capital gains and losses, you have to carry them forward. But in this question, the only allocations are to income. So the capital gains and losses are treated as distributable items, and the question doesn't specify taking any action beyond allocating their amounts. So I don't need to adjust for those; they are just part of the income.

So for the net income calculation, I can just add up all the income and subtract all the expenses.

So, let's add up the income:

Dividend income: $2500
Taxable interest income: $2000

Total income: 2500 + 2000 = $4500.

Now, subtract the expenses:

Accounting fees: $500
Trustee fees: $750

Total expenses: 500 + 750 = $1250.

So, distributable net income would be 4500 - 1250 = $3250.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is $3250. But let me double-check because sometimes I might mix things up.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in trusts, the taxable interest income is considered part of the income, but perhaps I need to consider if the Trustee fees are part of their own income or something else. Oh, no, trustee fees are expenses. So, the calculation is straightforward.

So, 2500 + 2000 = 4500, minus 500 and 750, which is 1250. 4500 - 1250 is 3250. So the distributable net income is $3250, which is option J.

Wait, but I thought sometimes when you have capital gains, you have to add them to the distributable income. No, wait, the question says it's capital gains (allocable to corpus). So that's an allocable item, meaning it's part of the income, not a loss to carry forward. So no adjustment needed.

So, the answer should be J: $3250.

To determine Lake's distributable net income, we need to sum the taxable income items and subtract the expenses. The income includes $2,500 in Dividend income and $2,000 in Taxable interest income, totaling $4,500. The expenses are $500 in Accounting fees and $750 in Trustee fees, summing to $1,250. Subtracting the expenses from the income gives a distributable net income of $3,250.

Answer: J: $3,250
