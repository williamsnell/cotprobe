Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an inductor's energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question says: Find the energy stored in an inductor from t=0 to t=1. The phi characteristic is given by phi(t) = (1/3)i^3(t), and the current is i(t) = 2 sin t. The options are A to J, and I need to pick which one is correct.

Wait, what's the formula for the energy stored in an inductor? Oh right, the energy U is (1/2) L ∫i²(t) dt. So I need to find the inductance L first, because that's part of the formula, right?

But wait, the phi is given as a function of the current. Oh, wait, inductors have the relation phi = L ∫i dt, but wait, that's when the current is varying. Or maybe phi is the flux, which is L times the integral of current over time. Or wait, maybe phi(t) is the magnetic flux, which is L times the integral of current dt.

Wait, let me think. The phi (t) given is the flux, which is the integral of the magnetic field over the area. For an inductor, the flux is also equal to L times the integral of the current from zero to time t. So phi(t) = L ∫ i(t') dt' from 0 to t.

Wait, but the problem says phi(t) = (1/3) i(t)^3. So, combining these two, phi(t) equals (1/3) times i(t) cubed. So,

phi(t) = (1/3) [i(t)]^3

But phi(t) is also L times the integral of i(t') dt' from 0 to t. So,

(1/3) i^3(t) = L ∫ i(t') dt'

Wait, but i(t) is given as 2 sin t. Let me substitute that in.

So, phi(t) = (1/3) (2 sin t)^3 = (1/3)(8 sin³ t) = (8/3) sin³ t.

But we also have phi(t) = L ∫ i(t') dt' from 0 to t. Let me compute the integral:

∫ (2 sin t') dt' from 0 to t is 2 ∫ sin t' dt' = 2 (-cos t' ) evaluated from 0 to t. So,

2 [ -cos t + cos 0 ] = 2 [ -cos t + 1 ] = 2 (1 - cos t).

So phi(t) = L * 2 (1 - cos t) = 2 L (1 - cos t).

But wait, earlier we have phi(t) as (8/3) sin³ t. So,

(8/3) sin³ t = 2 L (1 - cos t)

We can solve for L:

L = [ (8/3) sin³ t ] / [ 2 (1 - cos t) ] = (4/3) [ sin³ t / (1 - cos t) ]

Hmm, that's interesting. So, L depends on t, but wait, inductors are supposed to have a constant inductance. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere. Oh wait, maybe I should instead relate the derivative of phi to the current.

Wait, another approach: The inductance inductance is L = dPhi/dI. Because in an inductor, the magnetic flux is Phi = L I (if the current is changing, but wait, wait, no. Because Phi is the integral of I(t) dt, not I times t. Wait no, for an ideal inductor, Phi(t) = L ∫ I dt. But in this case, Phi(t) is given as (1/3) I(t)^3, and I is the current.

So, if Phi(t) = (1/3) I(t)^3, then the derivative of Phi with respect to time is dPhi/dt = (1/3) * 3 I(t)^2 dI/dt = I^2 dI/dt.

But the rate of change of Phi is also equal to L times dI/dt (since Phi = L I, but wait, no, more precisely, dPhi/dt = L * dI/dt. Because for an inductor, the induced EMF is L dI/dt. The EMF is also dPhi/dt.

So, dPhi/dt = L (dI/dt).

Now, let's compute dPhi/dt. From Phi(t) = (1/3) I(t)^3,

dPhi/dt = (1/3) * 3 I^2 (dI/dt) ) = I^2 (dI/dt).

So,

I^2 (dI/dt) = L dI/dt.

Assuming dI/dt is not zero (so the current is varying), we can divide both sides by (dI/dt), getting:

I^2 = L.

So, L = I^2.

Wait, that's a simpler relation! So the inductance L is equal to the square of the current through the inductor. Because if I^2 = L, then L is a constant, as long as I is constant.

Wait, but wait, the current is given as i(t) = 2 sin t. So I^2 is (2 sin t)^2 = 4 sin² t.

So, L = 4 sin² t.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because inductance should be constant for a pure inductor, but here it's varying with time. Oh wait, but in this problem, the inductor's Phi is given as a function of current, which is perhaps a non-ideal inductor or a constant inductance. Alternatively, perhaps the inductor's characteristic is given by Phi(t) = (1/3) I(t)^3, implying that L = I^2, which would make L vary with I. So that's correct.

Wait, but that would imply that L is varying with time, which isn't possible for a real inductor. So maybe I'm making a wrong assumption here. Let's go back and think again.

Wait, perhaps the inductor's phi is given as a function of I, and the inductance is determined by L = dPhi/dI. Because for any inductor, dPhi/dI equals L. So, if Phi(t) = (1/3) I(t)^3, then dPhi/dI is I^2.

So, L = I^2(t). But wait, that would make L vary with time unless I is constant.

But the current is given as i(t) = 2 sin t. So, if I is varying with time, then L is varying as well. So that would mean the inductor is not a constant inductance, which is confusing because inductors are supposed to have constant inductance.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe the problem states that the inductor's Phi is given by Phi(t) = (1/3) I^3(t). So, if the current is I(t) = 2 sin t, then Phi(t) = (1/3) * (2 sin t)^3 = (8/3) sin³ t.

But inductors have a relation Phi = L ∫ i dt. Wait, no, more accurately, for an inductor, Phi(t) = L ∫ i dt from 0 to t. So, Phi(t) = L * I(t), where I(t) is the integral of the current up to time t. Wait, but that's only true for a linear inductor (where Phi is proportional to I). So, in this case, the problem says Phi(t) = (1/3) I(t)^3. So, combining these two, we have:

(1/3) I(t)^3 = L * I(t)

Wait, because Phi(t) = L * I(t), since for a linear inductor, Phi is L multiplied by the current.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, that's the case for a linear inductor. For a non-linear inductor, the relation is different. But I think in this problem, Phi(t) is given as a function of I(t), which suggests that the inductor is linear.

So, in that case, Phi(t) = L * I(t), where L is the inductance. Wait, but the problem says Phi(t) = (1/3) I(t)^3. So setting them equal:

(1/3) I^3 = L I

Divide both sides by I (assuming I is not zero):

(1/3) I^2 = L.

So L = (1/3) I^2.

But wait, I is given as 2 sin t. So substituting:

L = (1/3) (2 sin t)^2 = (4/3) sin² t.

Wait, but this gives L as varying with time, which doesn't make sense for a standard inductor because inductors are supposed to have constant inductance. So perhaps this indicates that the problem is considering a non-ideal inductor or perhaps a different way of modeling it.

Alternatively, perhaps the relation is that Phi = L I, so we can get L from the Phi and I.

Wait, but from the given, Phi is (1/3) I^3. So when we set that equal to L I, we get L = (1/3) I^2.

But since I is varying with time, L is varying as well. But for a real inductor, L should be constant. So I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that L is (1/3) I^2. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just calculate the energy using the given Phi(t) and the current, and see what happens.

The energy stored in an inductor is U = (1/2) L ∫ i² dt from t=0 to t=1.

But since L is varying with time (as L = (1/3) I^2 = (1/3)(4 sin² t) = (4/3) sin² t), so L varies as 4/3 sin² t.

So when I compute the inductance at any given time t, I square the current and multiply by 4/3.

But wait, let me compute L again. From the given Phi(t) = (1/3) I(t)^3 and Phi(t) = L I(t), so L = (1/3) I(t)^2.

So,

L(t) = (1/3) * (2 sin t)^2 = (4/3) sin² t.

But then, the energy U is (1/2) L ∫ i² dt.

So,

U = (1/2) * (4/3 sin² t) * ∫ (2 sin t)^2 dt from 0 to 1.

Compute the integral part:

∫ (2 sin t)^2 dt = 4 ∫ sin² t dt.

The integral of sin² t from 0 to 1 is (1/2)(t - (sin 2t)/2) evaluated from 0 to 1.

So,

∫ sin² t dt from 0 to 1 = (1/2)(1 - (sin 2)/2) - (1/2)(0) ) = (1/2)(1 - (0)/2) since sin 0 is 0 and sin 2 is approximately 0.909.

Wait, sin(2*1) is sin(2 radians) ≈ 0.909.

So,

∫ sin² t dt from 0 to 1 ≈ (1/2)(1 - (0.909)/2) ) = (1/2)(1 - 0.4545) ) = (1/2)(0.5455) ) ≈ 0.27275.

So,

Integral of (2 sin t)^2 dt from 0 to 1 is 4 * 0.27275 ≈ 1.091.

Then, U = (1/2) * (4/3 sin² t ) * (1.091) evaluated from t=0 to 1.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the integral is (2 sin t)^2 dt, which is 4 sin² t dt. So,

U = (1/2) * (4/3 sin² t) * [4 ∫ sin² t dt ]

Wait, wait, let me do it correctly. Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute L(t) = (4/3) sin² t.

Compute ∫ i² dt from 0 to 1: i(t) = 2 sin t, so i² = 4 sin² t. So,

∫ (2 sin t)^2 dt from 0 to 1 = ∫ 4 sin² t dt = 4 ∫ sin² t dt.

As I computed earlier, ∫ sin² t dt from 0 to 1 is approximately 0.27275.

So, the integral becomes 4 * 0.27275 = 1.091.

So,

U = (1/2) * (4/3 sin² t) * (1.091) ?

Wait, no. Wait, no, the energy is:

U = (1/2) * L * ∫ i² dt.

So, substituting,

U = (1/2) * [ (4/3) sin² t ] * [1.091 ].

Wait, no. Wait, wait, because L is (4/3) sin² t, and the integral is 1.091.

So,

U = (1/2) * (4/3 sin² t) * 1.091.

Wait, but that's incorrect because the integral is a number, not a function of t. Wait, no! Wait a second, I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, the inductance is varying with time, so the energy U would be a function of time. But the question is asking for the energy stored from t=0 to t=1, but the options are constant values. That suggests that the energy is constant over the interval, meaning that the integral should give a constant value.

Hmm, perhaps my earlier approach is wrong. Let me try another way.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy as a function of time and then evaluate it at t=1.

But the energy U = (1/2) L ∫ i² dt.

Earlier, I found L(t) = (4/3) sin² t.

So,

U(t) = (1/2) * (4/3 sin² t) * ∫ (2 sin t)^2 dt from 0 to t.

Wait, no, the integral is from 0 to 1, not up to t, because the question is from t=0 to t=1. So perhaps I have to compute the integral up to 1.

So, compute the integral ∫ (2 sin t)^2 dt from 0 to 1.

As before, that's 4 ∫ sin² t dt from 0 to 1.

And ∫ sin² t dt from 0 to 1 is (1/2)(t - (sin 2t)/2) from 0 to 1.

At t=1: (1/2)(1 - (sin 2)/2 )

At t=0: (1/2)(0 - 0) = 0.

So, the integral is (1/2)(1 - (sin 2)/2 ) ≈ (1/2)(1 - 0.909) ) ≈ (1/2)(0.091) ) ≈ 0.0455.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute ∫0^1 sin² t dt:

The integral is (t/2) - (sin 2t)/4 evaluated from 0 to 1.

At t=1: (1/2) - (sin 2)/4.

At t=0: 0 - 0.

So,

∫ sin² t dt = [ (1/2) - (sin 2)/4 ] - 0.

So,

= 0.5 - (sin 2)/4.

Sin 2 ≈ 0.909297.

So,

0.5 - 0.909297 /4 ≈ 0.5 - 0.22732 ≈ 0.27268.

So, ∫ sin² t dt from 0 to 1 is approximately 0.27268.

So, 4 * 0.27268 ≈ 1.09072.

So, the integral of (2 sin t)^2 dt from 0 to 1 is approximately 1.09072.

Now, L(t) = (4/3) sin² t.

So, U = (1/2) * (4/3 sin² t) * 1.09072.

Wait, but wait, that's the energy at time t. But the problem says to find the energy from t=0 to t=1. Wait, but the options are all constants. Hmm, that suggests that the energy doesn't change with time, which would imply that U is the same at any t, but that's only possible if L is fixed. But I thought L was varying.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for energy. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The energy in an inductor is (1/2) L ∫ i^2 dt from 0 to t. So when integrating from 0 to 1, the energy would be (1/2) L ( ∫ 0^1 i^2 dt ).

Wait, but earlier when I assumed that L is (4/3) sin^2 t, then:

U = (1/2) * (4/3 sin² t) * ∫ i^2 dt from 0 to t.

Wait, no, because the integral is from 0 to 1, not t. So, perhaps I should compute the integral from 0 to 1, then find U as a function of 1.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute U as a function of time, then evaluate at t=1.

Wait, let me try to calculate U(t) = (1/2) * L(t) * ∫0^t i(t')^2 dt'.

We have L(t) = (4/3) sin² t.

i(t) = 2 sin t, so i²(t) = 4 sin² t.

So,

U(t) = (1/2) * (4/3 sin² t) * ∫0^t 4 sin² t' dt'

= (1/2) * (4/3 sin² t) * 4 [ ∫0^t sin² t' dt' ]

= (1/2) * (4/3 * 4) sin² t * [ ∫0^t sin² t' dt' ]

= (16/6) sin² t [ integral of sin^2 t' dt' from 0 to t ]

Simplify 16/6 to 8/3.

So,

U(t) = (8/3) sin² t [ ∫0^t sin² t' dt' ]

Now, compute the integral ∫0^t sin^2 t' dt' = [ (t/2) - (sin 2t')/4 ] from 0 to t.

At t: (t/2) - (sin 2t)/4.

At 0: 0 - 0 = 0.

So,

∫0^t sin² t' dt' = (t/2) - (sin 2t)/4.

So, U(t) is:

(8/3) sin² t * [ (t/2) - (sin 2t)/4 ]

But that's getting complicated. But the question asks for the energy stored in the inductor from t=0 to t=1. That is, the energy is U(t), so I need to compute it at t=1.

So,

U(1) = (8/3) sin² (1 radians) * [ (1/2) - (sin 2 radians)/4 ]

Wait, but wait, sin 2 radians is approximately 0.909.

So,

Compute sin(1) ≈ 0.84147.

So,

sin²(1) ≈ (0.84147)^2 ≈ 0.708.

Then,

(8/3) * 0.708 ≈ (8 * 0.708) /3 ≈ 5.664 /3 ≈ 1.888.

Next, the term in the brackets:

(1/2) - (sin 2)/4.

sin 2 radians ≈ 0.909.

So,

0.5 - (0.909)/4 ≈ 0.5 - 0.227 ≈ 0.273.

So,

U(1) ≈ 1.888 * 0.273 ≈ 0.513.

But wait, this doesn't seem to match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Let me compute each part with more precision.

First, compute sin(1 rad):

sin(1) ≈ 0.841470985.

So, sin²(1) ≈ (0.841470985)^2 = 0.70813053.

Then,

(8/3) * 0.70813053 = (8 * 0.70813053) /3.

Compute 8 * 0.70813053 = 5.66504424.

Divided by 3: 5.66504424 /3 ≈ 1.888348.

Next, compute the integral ∫0^1 sin² t dt ≈ 0.27268 (from earlier).

Wait, no, that's the integral from 0 to 1 of sin² t dt. So, the integral is approximately 0.27268.

Wait, but in the previous step, I had:

∫0^t sin^2 t' dt' = (t/2) - (sin 2t)/4.

At t=1, this is:

(1/2) - (sin(2))/4 ≈ 0.5 - 0.909297 /4 ≈ 0.5 - 0.227324 ≈ 0.272676.

So,

U(1) = 1.888348 * 0.272676 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1.888348 * 0.272676.

Well,

1 * 0.272676 = 0.272676.

0.8 * 0.272676 = 0.2181408.

0.08 * 0.272676 = 0.02181408.

0.008 * 0.272676 = 0.002181408.

0.0003 * 0.272676 = 0.0000818028.

Adding all together: 0.272676 + 0.2181408 = 0.4908168 + 0.02181408 = 0.51263088 + 0.002181408 = 0.514812288 + 0.0000818028 ≈ 0.51489409.

So, U(1) ≈ 0.5149 joules.

Looking at the options, option B is approximately 0.515 J. So, the answer would be option B.

But wait, earlier I thought the energy might not be constant, but according to this calculation, it's about 0.515 J. Hmm, that makes sense.

Wait, but let me re-examine my steps because the options don't include 0.515 J exactly. Let me double-check the calculations.

Compute U(1) = (8/3) * sin²(1) * [ (1/2) - sin(2)/4 ]

We have:

sin(1) ≈ 0.84147; sin²(1) ≈ 0.70813.

sin(2) ≈ 0.909297.

So,

(8/3) * 0.70813 ≈ (8 * 0.70813)/3 ≈ 5.66504/3 ≈ 1.888348.

Next, (1/2) - (0.909297)/4 ≈ 0.5 - 0.227324 ≈ 0.272676.

Multiply those together: 1.888348 * 0.272676 ≈ 0.5149 J.

So, the energy is approximately 0.515 J.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.0 J

B) 0.51 J

C) 0.75 J

D) 2.0 J

Wait, so option B is 0.51 J. My calculation is about 0.515 J, which is closer to 0.51 J. So, the correct option is B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I compute the energy, I get approximately 0.515 J, which is very close to option B (0.51 J). So, the answer should be option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate this using a more precise approach.

Let me compute each step more accurately.

Compute sin(1):

Using a calculator, sin(1) = approximately 0.841470985.

So, sin²(1) = (0.841470985)^2 = 0.70813053.

Compute (8/3) * sin²(1):

8/3 = 2.666666667.

2.666666667 * 0.70813053 = 2.666666667 * 0.70813053.

Let's compute 2.666666667 * 0.70813053.

Compute 2 * 0.70813053 = 1.41626106.

0.666666667 * 0.70813053 = let's compute 0.6 * 0.70813053 = 0.424878318.

0.066666667 * 0.70813053 ≈ 0.047208365.

Adding: 0.424878318 + 0.047208365 ≈ 0.472086683.

So, total is 1.41626106 + 0.472086683 ≈ 1.888347743.

So, (8/3) * sin²(1) ≈ 1.888347743.

Next, compute the integral ∫0^1 sin² t dt.

Using the identity:

∫ sin² t dt = (t - (sin 2t)/2 ) / 2 + C.

So, evaluating from 0 to 1:

At t=1: (1 - (sin 2)/2 ) / 2 = (1 - 0.909297 / 2 ) / 2 = (1 - 0.4546485) / 2 = 0.5453515 / 2 = 0.27267575.

At t=0: (0 - (sin 0)/2 ) / 2 = 0.

So, the integral is 0.27267575.

But, wait, earlier I calculated the integral from 0 to 1 as approximately 0.27268, which matches.

So, the integral is 0.27267575.

Now, U(1) = 1.888347743 * 0.27267575.

Compute that:

1.888347743 * 0.27267575 ≈ ?

Let me compute this multiplication step by step.

1.888347743 * 0.27267575.

First, 1.888347743 * 0.2 = 0.377669549.

1.888347743 * 0.07 = 0.132184342.

1.888347743 * 0.002 = 0.003776695.

1.888347743 * 0.0006 = 0.0011330086.

1.888347743 * 0.00007 = 0.0001321843.

1.888347743 * 0.000005 = 0.0000094417.

Adding all these contributions:

0.377669549 + 0.132184342 = 0.509853891.

+ 0.003776695 = 0.513630586.

+ 0.0011330086 = 0.514763595.

+ 0.0001321843 = 0.514895779.

+ 0.0000094417 = 0.5149052207.

So, the product is approximately 0.514905 J.

So, U(1) ≈ 0.5149 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.51 J, which is the closest. So, the answer is B.

But wait, let me double-check because sometimes in these calculations, a small error can change the outcome significantly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for energy. I think energy in an inductor is (1/2) L ∫ i^2 dt, which is exactly what I calculated.

So, it's correct. So, the answer is 0.51 J, which is option B.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 1.00

B) 0.51

C) 0.75

D) 2.00

So, the correct answer is B.

I think that's correct.
</think>

To determine the energy stored in the inductor from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \), we start by recalling the relationship between energy and inductance. The energy \( U \) in an inductor is given by:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} L \int_0^1 i^2(t) \, dt
\]

From the problem, the inductance \( L \) is given as:

\[
L = (4/3) \sin^2 t
\]

The current \( i(t) \) is:

\[
i(t) = 2 \sin t
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \sin^2 t \) and \( i^2(t) \)
- \( \sin^2 t = (0.84147)^2 \approx 0.70813 \)
- \( i^2(t) = (2 \sin t)^2 = 4 \sin^2 t \)

### Step 2: Compute \( L(t) \)
\[
L(t) = \frac{4}{3} \sin^2 t = \frac{4}{3} \times 0.70813 \approx 0.94418
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \int_0^1 i^2(t) \, dt \)
Using the identity for the integral of \( \sin^2 t \):

\[
\int_0^1 \sin^2 t \, dt = \frac{1}{2} \left[ t - \frac{\sin 2t}{2} \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 - \frac{\sin 2}{2} \right] = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - \frac{0.909297}{2} \right) \approx 0.27268
\]

Thus:

\[
\int_0^1 i^2(t) \, dt = 4 \times 0.27268 \approx 1.09072
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( U(1) \)
The energy \( U(1) \) is:

\[
U(1) = \frac{1}{2} L(1) \int_0^1 i^2(t) \, dt
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
L(1) = \frac{4}{3} \sin^2(1) \approx 0.94418
\]

\[
U(1) = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.94418 \times 1.09072 \approx 0.5149 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the given options
The computed energy \( U(1) \approx 0.5149 \, \text{J} \) is closest to option **B) 0.51 J**.
