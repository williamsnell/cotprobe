Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the relative occupancies of the alpha and beta spin energy levels for a radical species. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let's try to think this through.

The question gives me a g-factor of 2.05. I remember that the g-factor is a measure of the spin-spin coupling in a molecule, right? For radicals, they can exhibit spin-forbidden transitions, so the g-factor would be higher than 1. Typically, for radicals, a g-factor around 2-3 is common.

The question asks about the relative occupancies at L- and W-band frequencies, and the temperature is given as 300 K. Oh wait, I think these bands are the L and W bands of the Paschen-Back bands, which are spin-forbidden transitions. So the energy differences are between the absorption bands of the two spin states.

I remember that the occupancy ratio depends on the population of each spin state, which is governed by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula for the population ratio Nα/Nβ is (gβ/gα) * exp(-hν/(k T)), but wait, wait. Actually, I think it's more accurate to use the Boltzmann factor for each energy level.

Wait, let me get this straight. The energy difference between the alpha and beta states for each transition. Since the transitions are spin-forbidden, each transition (like L and W) has a certain energy difference, but the overall for each transition, the energy separation is the same because both are spin-forbidden. Hmm, but I think the L and W bands are distinct transitions, each involving a specific change in spin, so each would have a different energy.

Wait, no, maybe in this case, the energy levels are the same but have different multiplicities. Wait, perhaps the L and W bands are transitions between alpha and beta states. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about the relative occupancy Nα/Nβ, which depends on the energy difference between each spin state. Oh wait, no, each spin state is at a particular energy, and when you have a transition, one state is at higher energy. But for a radical, the alpha and beta states might have different energies. So the occupancy depends on the ratio of their populations.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think of the general formula. The population of each spin state is given by the Boltzmann distribution. Suppose each spin state (alpha and beta) has a certain energy. For each transition, the energy difference is E_alpha - E_beta. But in a Paschen-Back band, each transition involves a spin flip, so each spin state is in a higher or lower energy level. So the energy difference for each transition would be the same? Or is it different?

Wait, I think that in the presence of a g-factor, the energy of each spin state is different. The energy for each spin state is ε_α = (g_α / 2) h c / λ, and similarly for ε_β. So the energy difference would be ε_α - ε_β = (g_α - g_β) h c / (2 λ). But wait, I'm not sure if the g-factor affects the energy in the same way. Alternatively, perhaps the g-factor is related to the spin-spin interaction, so the energy levels are split based on the spin states.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are E_alpha and E_beta, and the difference is (E_alpha - E_beta) = (g_alpha - g_beta) * h c / (2 λ). But if the g-factor is the same for each spin state, then the energy difference would be the same for both transitions. So the same energy difference for each band. Therefore, the population ratio N_alpha/N_beta would be the same for both L and W bands. But wait, that can't be right, because the options show different ratios for each band.

Wait, perhaps the L and W bands are different energy levels. Let me think again. Each transition (like L and W) involves a change in the spin, so the energy of the spin states is different. So each band (L, W) corresponds to transitions from alpha to beta or beta to alpha, but their energies are different because the spin states have different energies.

Wait, perhaps the L and W bands are two different spin-forbidden transitions. Each of these transitions will have a certain energy difference. So each transition has an energy difference of (E_alpha - E_beta) for that particular band.

Wait, for example, for the L-band, perhaps the transition is from alpha to beta, and the energy difference is E_alpha - E_beta, and for the W-band, it's the reverse, but since energy is a scalar, the difference is the same. Or perhaps the L and W bands are for each spin flip, so their energy levels are different.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall the formula. The population ratio N_alpha/N_beta is given by e^{-ΔE/(k T)} / e^{-ΔE'/(k T)}, but wait, no. The general formula for the population ratio is N_alpha/N_beta = (g_beta/g_alpha) * e^{-(E_alpha - E_beta)/(k T)}. Because the energy of the spin state beta is higher than alpha if the transition is from alpha to beta (if E_alpha is lower than E_beta). Wait, no, that's the reverse. Let me think again.

The formula for the population of each state is N_i = N * (g_i / g_total) * e^{-E_i/(k T)}. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio N_alpha/N_beta.

The ratio N_alpha/N_beta is equal to (g_beta / g_alpha) * exp( -(E_beta - E_alpha) / (k T) ) ) / exp( -(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T) ) )? Wait, no. Wait, the Boltzmann factor is e^{-E_i/(k T)} for each state. So, for each spin state, the population is proportional to g multiplied by e^{-E/(kT)}. So, N_alpha is proportional to g_alpha * e^{-E_alpha/(kT)}, and N_beta is proportional to g_beta * e^{-E_beta/(kT)}.

So the ratio N_alpha/N_beta would be (g_alpha e^{-E_alpha/(kT)}) / (g_beta e^{-E_beta/(kT)}) ) = (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(kT)}.

Because E_beta - E_alpha is the energy difference between the two states. Wait, but in a spin-forbidden transition, the E_alpha and E_beta are such that E_alpha > E_beta (because the transition is from alpha to beta, which requires energy). So the exponent is positive.

So the ratio N_alpha/N_beta = (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)}.

Wait, but in a Paschen-Back band, each transition (L and W) has a different energy difference. So the energy difference for the L-band transition is E_alpha - E_beta, and for the W-band, it's E_beta - E_alpha. Wait, no, that can't be because the energy difference is the same magnitude but opposite in sign for each band. Because each transition is a spin flip. So in the L-band, the energy of the alpha state is higher than beta, and in the W-band, the beta state is higher than alpha.

Wait, in the L-band, the transition from alpha to beta requires energy, so E_l = E_alpha - E_beta (E_alpha > E_beta). In the W-band, the transition is beta to alpha, which requires energy E_w = E_beta - E_alpha (so the same magnitude but same sign as L, but opposite direction since it's the reverse transition).

Wait, no, the energy is the same for each transition. Wait, no, because each transition's energy is determined by the difference between the two spin states. So for the L-band, the transition is alpha to beta, so E_alpha = E_beta + delta (delta positive). For the W-band, the transition is beta to alpha, so E_beta = E_alpha + delta (same delta). So the energy difference for L and W bands is the same in magnitude, but the direction of the transition is opposite.

Ah, but the main point is that each band corresponds to a different energy difference, which affects the ratio N_alpha/N_beta. Wait, no; the energy difference is the same because the transition from alpha to beta and beta to alpha have the same energy, just opposite in direction. So each band has the same energy difference, but each has a different energy state (alpha and beta). So, the energy difference (E_alpha - E_beta) for the L-band is the same as (E_beta - E_alpha) for the W-band, but in magnitude. So each has the same delta E.

Wait, but in the formula, the exponent is (E_beta - E_alpha) / (k T). For the L-band, E_beta - E_alpha is negative (since E_alpha > E_beta), so the exponent is negative. For the W-band, E_beta - E_alpha is positive, so the exponent is positive. So the ratio for L-band would be (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)} = (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{- delta/(k T)}.

Similarly, for the W-band, the ratio would be (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)} = (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{+delta/(k T)}.

Wait, but in the question, the L and W bands are the same in terms of their energy differences, so their ratios would be different.

So the question is, given g = 2.05, and T = 300 K, what are the two ratios.

Wait, but wait, the given options don't show the same ratio for L and W. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, for example:

Option A: Nα/Nβ = 0.9850 at L-band; 0.9809 at W-band.

So for L, 0.985 is the ratio of alpha to beta.

Wait, if the formula is N_alpha/N_beta = (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)}.

Which is (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{- delta/(k T)}.

Because E_beta - E_alpha = -delta.

So, N_alpha/N_beta = (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{- delta/(k T)}.

Hmm, for the L-band, delta is positive (since for L, E_alpha - E_beta = delta), so E_beta - E_alpha = -delta, so the exponent is negative.

Wait, but in the formula I derived, for L, the exponent is (E_beta - E_alpha)/(kT) = (-delta)/(k T) = -delta/(k T), so the ratio is (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{- delta/(k T)}.

Wait, but for W-band, E_beta - E_alpha = delta, so exponent is positive. So N_alpha/N_beta for W would be (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{delta/(k T)}.

But wait, in the question, each transition (L and W) has a different energy difference, but wait, no, each transition has the same energy difference in the same direction. Or wait, no, each transition is a spin flip, so the energy difference for L is the same as for W, but the way it's calculated is for each transition.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Each transition (like L and W) has a different energy difference. But in this question, the L and W bands are the same in terms of their energy difference, because they're both spin-forbidden. So each transition (L and W) involves the same energy delta. So the delta is the same for both.

Wait, but for the L and W bands, the energy difference is delta. So for the L transition, E_alpha - E_beta = delta (so E_beta - E_alpha = -delta), and for the W transition, E_beta - E_alpha = delta.

So the exponents for each band's ratio would be:

N_alpha/N_beta (L) = (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{-delta/(k T)}.

N_alpha/N_beta (W) = (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{+delta/(k T)}.

Wait, but in the formula, we're taking the ratio of N_alpha to N_beta. So for the L band, the ratio is (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{-delta/(k T)}.

For the W band, it's (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{+delta/(k T)}.

So the ratio for W is higher than that for L, because the exponent is positive.

Now, the g-factor is given as 2.05. So g_alpha and g_beta can be assumed to be 2.05 each? Because the g-factor is given for the species, which presumably has a g-factor of 2.05. So perhaps g_alpha = g_beta = 2.05.

Wait, but perhaps the g-factor is related to the spin states. If the molecule has a certain g-factor, then each spin state has a g-factor. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the g-factor refers to the spin-spin coupling, so each spin state (alpha and beta) has a g-factor. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each spin state has a g-factor. So if the molecule's g-factor is g, then the g_alpha and g_beta would be equal to g. Hmm, perhaps assuming that.

So, with g_alpha = g_beta = 2.05.

So, the ratio for L is (2.05/2.05) * e^{-delta/(k T)} = e^{-delta/(k T)}.

For W, it's (2.05/2.05) * e^{delta/(k T)} = e^{delta/(k T)}.

So the ratio N_alpha/N_beta for L is e^{-delta/(k T)}, and for W, it's e^{delta/(k T)}.

So, the ratio for L is less than 1, and for W it's greater than 1.

Wait, looking at the options, all of them have N_alpha/N_beta as a value between 0.98 and 1.00. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, what if the g-factor is the same for both states, but in different ways, but perhaps the populations depend on that.

Wait, another possibility: The formula for the population ratio is N_alpha/N_beta = (g_beta/g_alpha) * e^{-(E_alpha - E_beta)/(k T)}.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again about the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann factor for each state is proportional to g_i * e^{-E_i/(k T)}. So for state alpha, it's g_alpha * e^{-E_alpha/(k T)}, and for beta, g_beta * e^{-E_beta/(k T)}.

So the ratio N_alpha/N_beta = (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)}.

Because (g_alpha e^{-E_alpha/(k T)}) / (g_beta e^{-E_beta/(k T)}) ) = (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)}.

So that's the same as before. So, for the L-band, the energy difference is E_alpha - E_beta = delta (because E_alpha > E_beta for the transition alpha to beta), so E_beta - E_alpha = -delta. Thus, the exponent is ( - delta )/(k T), so the ratio is (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{- delta/(k T)}.

For the W-band, the transition is beta to alpha (E_beta > E_alpha?), so E_alpha - E_beta = -delta, so the exponent is (E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T) = delta/(k T), so the ratio is (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{+delta/(k T)}.

So, the ratios for L and W are e^{-delta/(k T)} and e^{+delta/(k T)}. 

Now, the g-factor is 2.05. So, g_alpha and g_beta are both 2.05, as the molecule's g-factor is given as 2.05. So, the ratio simplifies to:

L-band: (2.05/2.05) * e^{- delta/(k T)} = e^{- delta/(k T)}.

W-band: (2.05/2.05) * e^{+ delta/(k T)} = e^{+ delta/(k T)}.

So, N_alpha/N_beta for L is e^{-delta/(k T)}, and for W it's e^{+delta/(k T)}.

Now, delta is the energy difference between the two spin states. But wait, what is delta? The difference in energy between the two spin states.

Wait, but for a given transition, the energy difference is (E_alpha - E_beta) = delta. So, delta is the same in magnitude for both L and W bands, but each is the same magnitude because each transition is spin-forbidden, but their energy differences are the same.

Wait, in that case, delta is the same for both, so the exponent for L is negative, and for W, positive.

Let me compute the exponent delta/(k T) with the given values.

Given T = 300 K. g = 2.05.

But wait, the exact value of delta is not given. So perhaps the question expects us to assume that the energy difference delta is zero, but that's not possible because that would imply no population ratio.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how delta is calculated. Let me think again.

Wait, the g-factor is a property of the molecule, and the spin states are determined by the presence of the g-factor. So each spin state has a certain g-factor. So if the g-factor is 2.05, then each spin state (alpha and beta) has a g_alpha and g_beta of 2.05.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the g-factor is a property that depends on the molecule's structure. So perhaps each spin state has a different g-factor, but that's unlikely. Perhaps the g-factor is the same for both states, which is not the case.

Wait, I think perhaps I should think of the g-factor as the ratio of the energy differences between the two spin states. But that's not possible because the g-factor is a scalar; it's the coupling through a magnetic field.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of the g-factors. For example, if the g-factor for the molecule is 2.05, then the g_alpha and g_beta might be 2.05 each. But that depends on the situation.

Alternatively, perhaps the g-factor is the same for both states. So, if the molecule has a g-factor of 2.05, then g_alpha = g_beta = 2.05. So, the ratio for both bands would be e^{-delta/(k T)} and e^{+ delta/(k T)}.

Wait, but then for both bands, the ratio is a function of delta and temperature. So, given that delta is the same, and T is 300 K, the ratio would be larger for the W-band than for the L-band.

But looking at the options, all options show N_alpha/N_beta as a value around 0.98 to 1.00.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me try to reevaluate.

The population of a spin state is given by the Boltzmann factor. For alpha and beta, their populations are proportional to g_alpha * e^{-E_alpha/(k T)} and g_beta * e^{-E_beta/(k T)}.

So, the ratio N_alpha/N_beta = (g_alpha e^{-E_alpha}) / (g_beta e^{-E_beta}).

Which simplifies to (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)}.

Again, E_beta - E_alpha is the energy difference between the two spin states.

But in a spin-forbidden transition, the energy difference is the same for each transition, but the energy itself is different. So for each transition (like L and W), the energy difference between the spin states is the same magnitude, but the direction of the transition is opposite.

Wait, but the energy difference (delta) is the same for each transition, but the sign depends on the transition direction.

So, for the L-band, E_alpha - E_beta = delta (positive), so E_beta - E_alpha = -delta (negative).

For the W-band, E_beta - E_alpha = delta (positive), so E_alpha - E_beta = -delta (negative).

So, for the L-band, the exponent in the ratio is (E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T) = (-delta)/(k T) = - delta/(k T).

For the W-band, the exponent is (E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T) = delta/(k T).

So, N_alpha/N_beta for L is (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{- delta/(k T)}.

For W, it's (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{+ delta/(k T)}.

So, the ratio for L is e^{- delta/(k T)}, which is less than 1, and for W it's e^{+ delta/(k T)}, which is more than 1.

So, the ratio for L is (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{- delta/(k T)}.

Wait, but the question gives specific values for g = 2.05. So, assuming g_alpha = g_beta = 2.05, then the ratio simplifies to e^{- delta/(k T)} and e^{+ delta/(k T)}.

So, the question is now, what is the value of delta/(k T) when g = 2.05 and T = 300 K.

Wait, but I don't know the value of delta. I must find delta using the given information.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the formula. Let me think again.

Another approach: The absolute population ratios for spin states can be found using the ratio of their g-factors and the Boltzmann factor. But perhaps I'm getting stuck because I don't have the value of the energy difference (delta) between the spin states.

Wait, but maybe I can find delta using the given g-factor. Wait, perhaps the g-factor relates to the energy difference. Wait, no, the g-factor is a property of the molecule, and the energy difference between spin states is related to that.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference (delta) is related to the g-factor. But I'm not aware of such a relationship, so I'm stuck.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is different, and the ratio is (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{(E_alpha - E_beta)/(k T)}.

Wait, no, that would be the same as before, because (E_alpha - E_beta) is the same as (E_beta - E_alpha) with a negative sign.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct formula is N_alpha/N_beta = (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_alpha - E_beta)/(k T)}.

Wait, but in that case, the ratio would be greater than 1 if E_alpha > E_beta. But for the L-band, E_alpha - E_beta is positive, so the ratio would be greater than 1 for L, which contradicts what I thought earlier.

Wait, but the ratios can't be greater than 1 because N_alpha and N_beta are populations, which are positive. So, perhaps the formula is correct, and the ratios are as I mentioned earlier.

Wait, but in that case, the ratio for L would be e^{- delta/(k T)}, and for W, e^{+ delta/(k T)}. So, the ratio for W is the exponential of a positive number, which is larger than 1.

But in the options, all the ratios are between 0.98 and 1.00, which suggests that the ratios are small, implying that the exponent is negative, which would mean that the ratio is less than 1.

So, perhaps the problem has a different approach. Maybe the g-factor is related to the spin states, and the formula uses g_alpha and g_beta, but perhaps g_alpha and g_beta are the same, so the ratio is e^{-delta/(k T)}.

Wait, but then the ratio for W is e^{+delta/(k T)}, which is larger than 1. So the ratio for W is higher than 1.

Wait, but in the options, all the ratios are between approximately 0.98 and 1.00. So, perhaps the exponent is negative, and the ratio is e^{-delta/(k T)}.

Wait, but if the exponent is negative, then the ratio is less than 1, which is what the options show.

Wait, perhaps the formula is N_alpha/N_beta = (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)}.

Which would be (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{-delta/(k T)}.

Wait, perhaps I should use this formula and compute the ratios.

Given that g_alpha = g_beta = 2.05, and the energy difference delta is positive (since for the L-band, E_alpha > E_beta), the exponent is negative.

So, N_alpha/N_beta for L would be (2.05/2.05) * e^{-delta/(k T)} = e^{-delta/(k T)}.

For W, the energy difference is delta (E_beta - E_alpha = delta), so the exponent is +delta/(k T), so N_alpha/N_beta = e^{+delta/(k T)}.

Now, the question is: what is the value of delta/(k T) when g = 2.05 and T = 300 K.

Wait, but I don't know delta, so perhaps I can find delta using the formula that relates g to delta.

Wait, no, I think I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, another idea: The g-factor is related to the energy difference between the spin states. Wait, but I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the g-factor is the same for both spin states, and the formula for the population ratio is N_alpha/N_beta = (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)}.

But in this case, since E_beta - E_alpha is positive, the exponent is positive.

So, N_alpha/N_beta for L is e^{-delta/(k T)}.

For W, it's e^{+delta/(k T)}.

Now, the question is, what is delta/(k T)? 

Wait, but I don't know delta. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question implies that the g-factor is the same for both spin states, and the energy difference is the same, so delta is the same for both transitions. Therefore, the exponents are the same in magnitude but opposite in sign.

But since the question provides specific values for the ratios (A to E), perhaps I can derive the possible value of delta/(k T).

Let me think of the options:

Option A: N_alpha/N_beta = 0.985 (L), 0.9809 (W).

So, for L, 0.985 is the ratio of N_alpha to N_beta. So, (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{-delta/(k T)} = 0.985.

For W, it's (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{+delta/(k T)} = 0.9809.

But since the g-factors are the same (2.05 each), the factor (g_alpha/g_beta) is 1.

So, for L: e^{-delta/(k T)} ≈ 0.985.

Taking natural logs, -delta/(k T) ≈ ln(0.985) ≈ -0.01515.

So, delta/(k T) ≈ 0.01515.

Similarly, for W: e^{+delta/(k T)} ≈ 0.9809.

Taking natural logs, +delta/(k T) ≈ ln(0.9809) ≈ -0.01915.

But that would give delta/(k T) ≈ -0.01915.

Wait, that's a problem because delta is positive (since E_alpha - E_beta = delta), and k T is positive, so delta/(k T) should be positive.

But according to the calculation for W, it's giving a negative value.

Hmm, that's a contradiction. So perhaps my assumption that (g_alpha/g_beta) is 1 is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the g-factor is not the same for both spin states. Maybe the g-factor is the same for both, but the spin states have different g-factors. For example, one spin state has g_alpha = 2.05, and the other has g_beta = 2.00. So, the ratio (g_alpha/g_beta) is 2.05/2.00 = 1.025.

In that case, the ratio for L would be 1.025 * e^{-delta/(k T)}.

But in the problem, the g-factor is given as 2.05, so perhaps it's the same for both spin states.

Wait, perhaps the answer lies in the fact that in the options, the ratios are 0.985 and 0.9809, which are very close to 1. So, perhaps the delta/(k T) is approximately 0.015, as in option A.

Wait, let me check what's the value of delta/(k T) for a delta of 0.015.

So, delta/(k T) = 0.015.

So, for L: e^{-0.015} ≈ 0.985.

For W: e^{+0.015} ≈ 1.015.

But the option A shows W's ratio as 0.9809, which is about 0.98.

So, that's a problem because 1.015 is way higher than 0.98.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is N_alpha/N_beta = (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{(E_alpha - E_beta)/(k T)}.

Wait, in that case, for L: (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{+delta/(k T)}.

For W: same as L.

But then, since g_alpha/g_beta is 1, the ratios are e^{+delta/(k T)} for both.

But that can't be, because L and W are different transitions.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula as N_alpha/N_beta = (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)}.

Which is the same as (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{-delta/(k T)}.

In that case, for L: e^{-delta/(k T)}.

For W: e^{+delta/(k T)}.

Now, let's calculate delta/(k T) from the options.

Option A: L ratio 0.985.

So, e^{-delta/(k T)} = 0.985.

Take ln: -delta/(k T) = ln(0.985) ≈ -0.01515.

So, delta/(k T) ≈ 0.01515.

Now, for W: e^{+delta/(k T)} = e^{0.01515} ≈ 1.0154.

But option A shows W's ratio as 0.9809.

Which is way lower than 1.0154.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the sign of the exponent.

Wait, let me double-check the formula.

The population of a spin state is given by:

P_alpha = (g_alpha * e^{-E_alpha/(k T)}) / Z,

where Z is the partition function.

Similarly, P_beta = (g_beta * e^{-E_beta/(k T)}) / Z.

So, the ratio N_alpha/N_beta is:

(g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)}.

Because (P_alpha)/(P_beta) = (g_alpha e^{-E_alpha}) / (g_beta e^{-E_beta}) = (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)}.

Ah, so the exponent is (E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T).

Which is delta/(k T), since delta = E_alpha - E_beta.

Wait, no, because E_alpha - E_beta is positive (for L), so delta = E_alpha - E_beta.

Then, (E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T) = -delta/(k T).

So, the ratio is (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{-delta/(k T)}.

So, with g_alpha = g_beta = 2.05, the ratio is e^{-delta/(k T)}.

So, if the ratio is 0.985, then e^{-delta/(k T)} = 0.985.

Which leads to -delta/(k T) = ln(0.985) ≈ -0.01515.

So, delta/(k T) ≈ 0.01515.

Now, for W, the ratio is e^{+delta/(k T)}.

Which would be e^{0.01515} ≈ 1.0154.

But in option A, the W ratio is 0.9809.

Hmm, which is a problem because 1.0154 is much larger than 0.9809.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the formula should be N_alpha/N_beta = (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_alpha - E_beta)/(k T)}.

Wait, that would mean the ratio is (g_alpha/g_beta)*e^{delta/(k T)}.

In that case, for L, the ratio is e^{+delta/(k T)}.

For W, the ratio is e^{+delta/(k T)}.

But that's not correct because L and W are different transitions.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The correct formula for the population ratio N_alpha/N_beta is:

N_alpha / N_beta = (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)}.

Which is the same as (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{-delta/(k T)}.

Because (E_beta - E_alpha) = -delta.

So, the ratio is (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{-delta/(k T)}.

So, in option A, for L, the ratio is 0.985 = e^{-delta/(k T)}.

So, delta/(k T) = ln(1/0.985) = ln(1.01538) ≈ 0.0153.

So, delta/(k T) ≈ 0.0153.

Now, for W, the ratio is (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{-delta/(k T)} = 1.0 * e^{-0.0153} ≈ 0.985.

Wait, but that's not matching the option A's W ratio of 0.9809.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the formula is N_alpha/N_beta = (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_alpha - E_beta)/(k T)}.

Wait, but that would be the same as (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{delta/(k T)}.

So, for L, the ratio is (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{delta/(k T)}.

Which would be 1 * e^{+0.0153} ≈ 1.0154.

Which doesn't match option A's L ratio of 0.985.

Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Another approach: The population of a spin state is given by:

P_alpha = (g_alpha e^{-E_alpha}) / Z,

where Z = sum over all spin states of (g_spin e^{-E_spin}).

So, for the two spin states, P_alpha and P_beta, the ratio is:

P_alpha / P_beta = (g_alpha e^{-E_alpha}) / (g_beta e^{-E_beta}) ) = (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)}.

Which is the same as before.

So, the ratio is (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)}.

Which is (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{-delta/(k T)}.

So, if g_alpha and g_beta are the same, then the ratio is e^{-delta/(k T)}.

So, in option A, the L ratio is 0.985, which is e^{-delta/(k T)}.

So, delta/(k T) = ln(1/0.985) ≈ 0.0153.

Now, for W, the ratio is e^{-delta/(k T)} = 0.985.

But the option A shows W's ratio as 0.9809, which is a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is N_alpha / N_beta = (g_alpha / g_beta) * e^{(E_alpha - E_beta)/(k T)}.

Which would be (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{delta/(k T)}.

So, for L, it's e^{0.0153} ≈ 1.015.

Which again, doesn't match option A.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: L=0.985, W=0.9809.

Option B: L=0.995, W=0.98.

Option C: L=0.98, W=0.98.

Option D: L=0.985, W=0.98.

Option E: L=0.96, W=0.96.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the ratio for L is 0.985, which is e^{-delta/(k T)}.

So, delta/(k T) = 0.0153.

Now, for W, the ratio is (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{delta/(k T)}.

Which is 1 * e^{0.0153} ≈ 1.0154.

But option A shows W's ratio as 0.9809, which is way lower.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses the Boltzmann factor as P_alpha = (g_alpha * e^{-E_alpha/(k T)}) / Z_alpha.

Then, the population ratio N_alpha/N_beta = (P_alpha)/(P_beta) = (g_alpha e^{-E_alpha}) / (g_beta e^{-E_beta}) ) * (Z_beta / Z_alpha).

But in the case of two spin states, Z_alpha = g_alpha e^{-E_alpha} + g_beta e^{-E_beta}.

Similarly for Z_beta.

But perhaps this is complicating things further.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the correct value of delta/(k T) is 0.015, as per option A.

Thus, the ratio for W would be e^{+0.015} ≈ 1.015.

But option A shows W's ratio as 0.9809, which is way lower.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is N_alpha/N_beta = (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{(E_beta - E_alpha)/(k T)}.

Which is (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{-delta/(k T)}.

So, if g_alpha and g_beta are the same, then N_alpha/N_beta = e^{-delta/(k T)}.

Thus, the ratio for W would be e^{-delta/(k T)} as well, which is the same as for L.

But that can't be right, because L and W are different transitions.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is N_alpha/N_beta = (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{(E_alpha - E_beta)/(k T)}.

Which is (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{delta/(k T)}.

So, for L, the ratio is (g_alpha/g_beta) * e^{delta/(k T)}.

Which is 1 * e^{0.0153} ≈ 1.015.

But option A shows L's ratio as 0.985, which is e^{-0.0153}.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure why.

Hmm, I'm not sure. I think I'm stuck here. I'll have to make a guess.
</think>

The question involves determining the relative population ratios (Nα/Nβ) for two spin states (α and β) in a system, based on their energy differences (δ) and the Boltzmann factor (kT). The formula used is:

\[
\frac{N_\alpha}{N_\beta} = \frac{g_\alpha}{g_\beta} e^{\frac{E_\beta - E_\alpha}{kT}} = \frac{g_\alpha}{g_\beta} e^{-\frac{\Delta}{kT}}
\]

where \( g_\alpha \) and \( g_\beta \) are the statistical weights of the spin states, \( \Delta = E_\alpha - E_\beta \), and \( kT \) is the thermal energy.

### Analysis:
1. **Option A**:  
   - L: \( 0.985 \)  
   - W: \( 0.9809 \)  

   For L, \( \frac{N_\alpha}{N_\beta} = 0.985 = e^{-\frac{\Delta}{kT}} \).  
   Solving gives \( \frac{\Delta}{kT} = \ln(1/0.985) \approx 0.0153 \).  
   For W, using the same formula:  
   \( \frac{N_\alpha}{N_\beta} = e^{-\frac{\Delta}{kT}} = e^{-0.0153} \approx 0.985 \).  
   However, the given W ratio is \( 0.9809 \), which is significantly lower than the calculated \( 0.985 \).  
   This discrepancy suggests that Option A may not be correct.

2. **Option B**:  
   - L: \( 0.995 \)  
   - W: \( 0.98 \)  

   For L, \( \frac{N_\alpha}{N_\beta} = 0.995 = e^{-\frac{\Delta}{kT}} \).  
   Solving gives \( \frac{\Delta}{kT} = \ln(1/0.995) \approx 0.0050 \).  
   For W, \( \frac{N_\alpha}{N_\beta} = e^{-\frac{\Delta}{kT}} = 0.995 \), which does not match the given \( 0.98 \).  
   This makes Option B incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - L: \( 0.98 \)  
   - W: \( 0.98 \)  

   Both ratios are equal, suggesting \( \frac{N_\alpha}{N_\beta} = 0.98 \) for both transitions.  
   This implies \( \frac{\Delta}{kT} = \ln(1/0.98) \approx 0.0208 \).  
   However, this does not match the calculated ratios, making Option C incorrect.

4. **Option D**:  
   - L: \( 0.985 \)  
   - W: \( 0.98 \)  

   Similar to Option A, the W ratio does not match the calculated value.  
   Thus, Option D is incorrect.

5. **Option E**:  
   - L: \( 0.96 \)  
   - W: \( 0.96 \)  

   Both ratios are lower than the calculated values, making Option E incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The analysis shows that none of the options perfectly match the calculated population ratios without additional assumptions. However, based on the closest match, **Option A** is the most plausible, despite the W ratio discrepancy.
