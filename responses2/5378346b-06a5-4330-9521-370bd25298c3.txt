Question:

Consider the following code segment, which uses the variables r, s, and t.
  r ← 1
   s ← 2
   t ← 3
   r ← s
   s ← t
   DISPLAY (r)
   DISPLAY (s)

 What is displayed as a result of running the code segment?

Options:

A: 3 3
B: 3 2
C: 2 1
D: 2 3
E: 1 2
F: 1 1
G: 2 2
H: 1 3
I: 3 1

Okay, let's see what the question is about. So, I have this code segment that uses variables r, s, and t. The code starts by assigning each variable their initial values: r is 1, s is 2, and t is 3. Then there are some assignments and displays. I need to figure out what gets displayed.

Let me go through the code step by step. The first lines are initializing the variables, so r is 1, s is 2, t is 3. Then the next line is r ← s. So, r is now assigned the value of s, which was 2. Then the next line is s ← t. So s becomes the value of t, which was 3.

Now, the code displays the values of r and s. So after the assignments, r is 2 and s is 3. Therefore, when we display them, the first line would show 2, and the second line 3. So the output should be 2 and 3, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other steps I might have missed? The code only does those four lines. R is set to s's value, s is set to t's value. Then display r and s. So that's correct. So the output is 2 and 3, which is option D.

The code initializes r=1, s=2, t=3. Then r is set to s's current value (2), and s is set to t's value (3). The display shows r=2 and s=3.

Answer: D: 2 3
