Question:

Three friends decided to go bowling together. They made a friendly wager on the match, with the winner receiving a free beer from the other two guys. In the second frame of the first game, the first friend apparently got a strike when he knocked down all 10 pins. However, the second friend accused the first friend of fouling because his foot went over the line. The first friend denied fouling and wanted to mark down a strike on the scorecard. The second friend refused to give the first friend a strike and wrote in a zero on the scoring sheet. The first friend became enraged. The second friend then went to bowl his frame. As the second friend turned his back, the first friend approached from behind with a bowling ball in his hand. The first friend then raised the bowling ball threatening to hit the back of the second friend's head. The second friend, who had his back turned, did not see the first friend's actions. The third friend saw what the first friend was about to do and could easily have warned the second friend; but the third friend remained silent. The first friend then struck the second friend on the back of the head with the bowling ball, causing a deep scalp wound. If the second friend asserts a cause of action against the third friend, he should

Options:

A: not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.
B: not prevail, as the third friend's silence does not qualify as an act of negligence.
C: prevail, because the third friend contributed to his injury by remaining silent.
D: prevail, because the third friend was aware of the danger.
E: prevail, because the third friend was an accomplice in the first friend's actions.
F: prevail, on account of the third friend's omission to act.
G: not prevail, because the first friend was responsible for his injury.
H: prevail, because the third friend had a moral obligation to warn him.
I: not prevail, because the third friend could not have predicted the first friend's actions.
J: not prevail, because the third friend did not directly cause the injury.

Okay, so I have this legal question about negligence and criminal liability. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

First, let me read the scenario again carefully. Three friends are bowling together. In the second frame of the first game, the first friend gets a strike because he knocked down all 10 pins. The second friend, however, points out that the first friend might have fouled because his foot went over the line. The first friend claims it's a strike and writes it down, while the second friend writes a zero. The first friend is upset and the second friend goes to bowl his own frame. When the first friend turns the back, he approaches the second friend, who doesn't see him. The first friend hits the second friend with a bowling ball, causing a wound. Now, the question is about whether the second friend can sue the third friend (the third friend is the one who was silent and didn't warn the second friend) for negligence.

Hmm. So the main issue is whether the third friend is negligent and can be held responsible. Let's think about what negligence entails. Negligence requires that the plaintiff's actions were either intentionally or reasonably negligent, which leads to harm, and that the defendant had a duty to prevent that harm.

So in this case, the third friend is silent and doesn't warn the second friend about the danger. Alternatively, the first friend could have used a warning device. But the third friend didn't act in a way that would be negligent. He remained silent. What's his duty? Was he under any duty to warn the second friend?

Wait, the first friend was a strike, which is a very dangerous situation. The second friend didn't see him, and the first friend then struck him with a bowling ball. The first friend's actions—whether he used a warning device or not—could affect the third friend's liability.

I think the key here is whether the third friend had a duty to warn the second friend. If the first friend was acting in a way that could reasonably have been warned, then the third friend had a duty to warn. Otherwise, he wasn't negligent.

But in this case, the first friend was a strike, which is a severe occasion. The second friend didn't see the first friend, and the first friend's actions (striking) caused the wound. The first friend used a bowling ball, which was a tool—but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, the first friend's actions included hitting the second friend. So maybe the first friend intended to hit the second friend? Or was that an accident? The question says the first friend approached with a bowling ball, but didn't actually attack the second friend; he hit the second friend's head. The first friend was a strike, so that's dangerous.

So, the third friend was silent when the first friend approached from behind. But the first friend was already in the second frame and struck the second friend. So the third friend's silence didn't prevent the first friend from doing something harmful.

Wait, but for negligence, the defendant needs to have a duty to prevent the harm. If the third friend had a duty to warn the second friend, then the third friend's failure to warn would be negligence.

But the third friend remained silent. So maybe he didn't have a duty to warn. Alternatively, perhaps the third friend didn't know about the danger, but that's not about negligence. The third friend's silence didn't contribute to a duty; he wasn't in a position to warn.

Wait, another angle: The first friend was acting in a manner that could result in the third friend's negligence. The third friend was silent—did he have a duty to warn? Or was his silence a failure to act in a way that would be negligent.

Wait, the first friend was a strike, which is a very serious situation. The second friend didn't see the first friend, so the first friend used a bowling ball. The first friend's actions—striking the second friend—caused the wound. But the first friend didn't aim to hit the second friend; he was just approaching from behind and hitting the second friend's head. So the first friend's actions were in response to a strike, not a direct threat.

So the first friend's actions were accidental, but were they negligent? In terms of negligence, if the first friend intended to hit the second friend, then he was negligent. But if he just approached with a bowling ball, then he might not have intended to attack the second friend.

Wait, maybe the first friend's action was intentional. If the first friend intended to hit the second friend, then that's negligence. But the question seems to suggest that the first friend was a strike, which is a dangerous situation. So perhaps the first friend was acting intentionally to strike the second friend.

But in any case, for negligence, the plaintiff's actions must be negligent, and the defendant must have a duty to prevent the harm. The third friend being silent doesn't mean he was negligent. So the third friend's failure to warn would not result in liability.

Wait, but the first friend was already in a position of danger. So if the first friend was acting in a way that could have reasonably been warned, then the third friend had a duty to warn. But if the first friend didn't act with a warning device, then the third friend didn't have a duty to warn, so the third friend wasn't negligent.

Alternatively, the third friend's silence didn't contribute to a duty; he wasn't in the position to warn. So the third friend was not negligent.

Wait, let me think again. The third friend is silent when the first friend approached. Did he have a duty to warn the second friend? If the first friend was acting in a way that he could have warned, then yes. But if he didn't have a duty to warn, then he wasn't negligent.

But the first friend's actions—striking the second friend—are dangerous. So maybe the first friend should have warned the second friend. But since the third friend remained silent, the third friend didn't have that duty.

Wait, but the third friend's failure to warn is the issue. So if the third friend had a duty, then he wasn't negligent. Because he didn't know the danger, but that's not the issue here; the issue is whether he acted in a way that was negligent.

Wait, but the first friend's actions were intentional? Or accidental? The question doesn't specify. But regardless, the third friend's silence doesn't make him negligent.

So the third friend's failure to warn the second friend is not a duty, so he's not negligent. Therefore, the third friend didn't have a duty to warn, so they weren't negligent. Thus, the third friend can't be held liable for the injury.

So the answer would be F: not prevail, because the third friend's silence does not qualify as an act of negligence.

Wait, but wait. The third friend's failure to warn the second friend would not be negligence. Because negligence requires the defendant to have a duty. Here, the third friend had no duty because he wasn't acting in a position that required warning. So the third friend's silence was a failure to act in a way that was a duty, so he wasn't negligent.

Alternatively, the first friend may have had a duty to warn, but the third friend remained silent, so there was no negligence on the third friend's part.

So the correct answer would be F: not prevail because the third friend's silence doesn't qualify as an act of negligence.

The third friend remained silent when the first friend approached, failing to act in a way that would have been negligent. The third friend did not have a duty to warn the second friend, as he was not acting in a position that required such a duty. Therefore, his failure to warn did not constitute negligence. The answer is:

F: not prevail, because the third friend's silence does not qualify as an act of negligence.
