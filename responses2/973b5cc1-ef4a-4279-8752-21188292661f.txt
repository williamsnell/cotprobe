Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about depression studies by Brown & Harris (1978). I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me think through each option and what I remember about their work.

The question is about depression levels and factors affecting them, probably gender and social support. I should start by recalling the key points of Brown & Harris's study. I remember that they did a lot of research on depression but I'm not exactly sure about the specific findings.

Let me list out the options:

A: Men and women have similar depression levels.
B: Depression is less in high social support, regardless of gender.
C: Women's stress susceptibility depends on social support.
D: Men and women have drastically different depression levels.
E: Men's stress is influenced by social support.
F: Women have more depression due to hormonal differences.
G: Women are more prone due to societal pressures.
H: Men are more vulnerable because of gender roles.
I: Self-reported depression is highest in women, economically disadvantaged.
J: Highest in men and relatively affluent.

I think Brown & Harris looked at several factors, including social support, gender, and stress. From what I remember, they found that high levels of social support are associated with less depression. So option B says depression is less likely in individuals with high social support, regardless of gender. That sounds familiar.

Option A and D suggest no difference, which I doubt because I believe they found significant differences. Option C talks about women's susceptibility to stress depending on social support, which I think is about how women's stress levels might change based on their social environment. Option H suggests men are more vulnerable because of gender roles, which I'm not sure about. I think men often face more traditional gender roles, like being more physically active, which might contribute to higher stress.

Option E says men's stress is influenced by social support, which is opposite to what I thought. Maybe that's not correct. Option I and J relate to self-reported depression, but I'm not certain if those are the main points of their study. 

So putting it together, option B seems correct because the study likely found that high social support reduces depression levels, regardless of gender. That would mean option B is right.

The correct answer is:

**B: depression is less likely in individuals with high levels of social support regardless of gender**

**Explanation:** 

Brown & Harris (1978) studied depression and found that individuals with high levels of social support have lower depression rates, regardless of gender. This aligns with option B. Other options either suggest no difference (A and D), gender-specific impacts (C, H), or self-reported issues (I, J), which are less relevant to their study's main findings. 

**Answer:** B
