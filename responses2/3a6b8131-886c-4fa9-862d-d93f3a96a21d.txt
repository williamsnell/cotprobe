Question:

On July 7, Magee Data stock sold at a high of 23(1/8) and a low of 22(5/8). Giant Industrials sold for a high of 24(1/4) and a low of 23(1/2).

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Taylor buying stocks, and I need to figure out the total cost. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details right.

So, Magee Data and Giant Industrials are two companies. Mr. Taylor bought shares in both. He bought 300 shares of Magee at the high of the day and 400 shares of Giant at the low of the day. 

The stock prices are given as fractions. Let's break them down. For Magee, the high was 23 1/8 and the low was 22 5/8. For Giant, the high was 24 1/4 and the low was 23 1/2. So, he bought Magee at 23 1/8 and Giant at 23 1/2.

Wait, so when he bought Magee Data, he paid the high price, which is 23 1/8 per share. And for Giant, he bought at the low, which is 23 1/2 per share.

So, I think I need to calculate the total cost for each stock separately and then add them together.

Let me calculate the cost for Magee first. He bought 300 shares at 23 1/8 each. Let me convert 23 1/8 into an improper fraction or a decimal to make the multiplication easier.

23 1/8 is the same as 23 + 1/8. 1/8 is 0.125, so 23.125. So each share is $23.125.

So, 300 shares times 23.125. Let me compute that. 300 multiplied by 23 is 6,900. 300 multiplied by 0.125 is 37.5. So adding those together gives 6,900 + 37.5 = 6,937.5. So the cost for Magee is $6,937.50.

Now for Giant. He bought 400 shares at the low price, which is 23 1/2 per share. Let's convert that to a decimal. 23.5. So 400 times 23.5.

Let me compute this. 400 times 20 is 8,000. 400 times 3 is 1,200. 400 times 0.5 is 200. So adding those together: 8,000 + 1,200 is 9,200, plus 200 is 9,400. So the cost for Giant is $9,400.

Now, add the two amounts together: Magee's $6,937.50 plus Giant's $9,400. Let's do that.

6,937.50 + 9,400 = let's add 6,937 + 9,400 first. 6,937 + 9,400 is 16,337. Then add the 0.50, so 16,337.50.

Wait, but looking at the options, the answer options are:

A: $17,337.50

B: $18,337.50

C: $15,337.50

D: $19,337.50

E: $14,837.50

F: $15,837.50

G: $14,337.50

H: $16,837.50

I: $16,337.50

J: $17,837.50

Wait, I got $16,337.50, which is option I. But let me check the calculations again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, when I calculated Magee, 300 * 23.125. Let me double-check that. 300 * 23 is 6,900. 300 * 0.125 is 37.5. So 6,937.5. Correct.

For Giant, 400 * 23.5. Let's do 400*23 = 9,200, 400*0.5=200. So 9,400. Correct.

So total is 6,937.5 + 9,400 = 16,337.50, which is option I. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see I as the middle option. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 17,337.50

B: 18,337.50

C: 15,337.50

D: 19,337.50

E: 14,837.50

F: 15,837.50

G: 14,337.50

H: 16,837.50

I: 16,337.50

J: 17,837.50

So option I is 16,337.50, which matches my calculation. So why is there a doubt?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the prices. Let me double-check. The high price for Magee is 23 1/8, which is 23.125. The low price for Giant is 23 1/2, which is 23.5. So the initial calculations seem correct.

Wait, but wait, another way: Maybe I'm adding the prices wrong.

Wait, 300 * 23.125 = 300 * 23 + 300 * 0.125 = 6,900 + 37.5 = 6,937.5.

For Giant: 400 * 23.5. 400 * 23 is 9,200. 400 * 0.5 is 200. So 9,400.

Total: 6,937.5 + 9,400 = 16,337.50. So that's option I.

But looking at the options, I (16,337.50) is option I, but let me check whether I misread the options.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me check the order again.

A:17,337.5

B:18,337.5

C:15,337.5

D:19,337.5

E:14,837.5

F:15,837.5

G:14,337.5

H:16,837.5

I:16,337.5

J:17,837.5

So I is 16,337.5 and that's one of the options. So, the correct answer should be I.

Wait, but the options don't all have I. Wait, the options are A to J, but looking at the question, the options are letters A to J, each with a number. So I is option I, but the question lists options A to J, each with a number. So, for example, option A is 17,337.50, which is correct for Magee's cost? Wait, no, no. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, no, the options are:

A: 17,337.50

B: 18,337.50

C: 15,337.50

D:19,337.50

E:14,837.50

F:15,837.50

G:14,337.50

H:16,837.50

I:16,337.50

J:17,837.50

So, the calculation I did gives 16,337.50, which is option I. But the options don't have I as the first choice. Wait, no, I is option I. So, the correct answer is I: 16,337.50.

Wait, but looking at the problem statement, the options are A to J, each with their own numbers. So the correct answer would be option I, which is 16,337.50.

The problem requires calculating the total cost of purchasing shares in two companies, Magee Data and Giant Industrials, at specific prices. 

1. **Magee Data**: Purchased 300 shares at the high price of 23 1/8 (=23.125).  
   - Calculation: \(300 \times 23.125 = 6,937.50\).

2. **Giant Industrials**: Purchased 400 shares at the low price of 23 1/2 (=23.5).  
   - Calculation: \(400 \times 23.5 = 9,400\).

3. **Total Cost**: Sum the two amounts.  
   - \(6,937.50 + 9,400 = 16,337.50\).

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is option I, which is $16,337.50.

Answer: I
