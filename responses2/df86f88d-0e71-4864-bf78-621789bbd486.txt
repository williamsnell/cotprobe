The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Construct a complete truth table for the following argument. Then, using the truth table, determine whether the argument is valid or invalid. If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample. (There may be other counterexamples as well.)
I ≡ ~J
I ∨ J / I

Options:

A: Valid. The argument is a contradiction
B: Invalid. Counterexample when I and J are true
C: Valid
D: Invalid. Counterexample when both I and J are false
E: Valid. The argument is tautological
F: Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and J is false
G: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true
H: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false
I: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is false
J: Valid. No counterexample exists

Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of truth tables and logical arguments. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says I have to construct a complete truth table for the following argument and then determine if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to pick a counterexample from the given options. There are seven options (A to H) that give different scenarios where the argument might be invalid.

The argument given is:
I ≡ ~J
I ∨ J / I

Wait, I think I need to parse this correctly. Maybe the argument is structured as two premises and a conclusion. Let me rewrite it to clarify: The premises are I ≡ ~J and I ∨ J, and the conclusion is I. So, it's like saying if I is equivalent to not J, and if I or J is true, then I must be true. Or wait, perhaps it's an argument with two premises and one conclusion, so like:

Premise 1: I ≡ ~J
Premise 2: I ∨ J
Conclusion: I

I think that's correct. So the structure is:

Premise 1: I ⇔ ~J
Premise 2: I ∨ J
Conclusion: I

Wait, but I think I need to structure it correctly. Alternatively, maybe it's a premise followed by a conclusion, like:

I ⇔ ~J
I ∨ J
Therefore, I.

But perhaps the way it's written, it's an argument with two premises (I ≡ ~J and I ∨ J) and a conclusion (I) that we need to evaluate.

Now, to build a truth table for this, I'll need to list all possible truth values for I and J. Since there are two variables, there are 2^2 = 4 possible combinations.

Let's list them:

1. I = T, J = T
2. I = T, J = F
3. I = F, J = T
4. I = F, J = F

Wait, wait, no. Actually, for two variables, each can be T or F, so four rows:

Row 1: I=T, J=T
Row 2: I=T, J=F
Row 3: I=F, J=T
Row 4: I=F, J=F

Now, let's compute the values for each premise and the conclusion in each row.

First, I'll write down the premises and the conclusion.

Premise 1: I ⇔ ~J (which is equivalent to (I ∧ ~J) ∨ (~I ∧ J))
Premise 2: I ∨ J
Conclusion: I

So, for each row, I'll calculate whether each premise is true or false, and the conclusion.

Let's go through each case.

Case 1: I=T, J=T
Premise 1: I ⇔ ~J → I=T, ~J=F → T ⇔ F = F
Premise 2: I ∨ J → T ∨ T = T
Conclusion: I → T

So in this case:
P1: F, P2: T, Con: T

Case 2: I=T, J=F
Premise1: I ⇔ ~J → I=T, ~J=T → T ⇔ T = T
Premise2: I ∨ J → T ∨ F = T
Con: I → T

So:
P1: T, P2: T, Con: T

Case 3: I=F, J=T
Premise1: I ⇔ ~J → I=F, ~J=F → F ⇔ F = T
Premise2: I ∨ J → F ∨ T = T
Con: I → F

So:
P1: T, P2: T, Con: F

Case 4: I=F, J=F
Premise1: I ⇔ ~J → I=F, ~J=T → F ⇔ T = F
Premise2: I ∨ J → F ∨ F = F
Con: I → F

So:
P1: F, P2: F, Con: F

Now, let's list all the rows in the truth table:

Row 1:
P1: F, P2: T, Con: T

Row 2:
P1: T, P2: T, Con: T

Row 3:
P1: T, P2: T, Con: F

Row 4:
P1: F, P2: F, Con: F

Now, we need to see if the argument is valid. An argument is valid if in every possible scenario where all premises are true, the conclusion is also true.

Looking at the rows:

Case 3: P1 and P2 are both true (T), but Con is F. So in this case, the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. That means the argument is invalid because one of the premise-conclusion assignments doesn't hold.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check each row's conclusion.

Wait, in case 3, the conclusion is I, which is F. So when the premises are both T, the conclusion is F. So the argument is invalid because in that scenario, premises are true but conclusion is false.

So the argument is invalid. So the answer should be one of the options B to H, which indicate invalidity with specific counterexamples.

Now, the options are:

B: Invalid. Counterexample when I and J are true
C: Valid
D: Invalid. Counterexample when both I and J are false
E: Valid
F: Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and J is false
G: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true
H: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false
I: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is false
J: Valid

We have a counterexample in case 3: I=F, J=T. In that case, premises are T, but conclusion is F.

Looking at the options, option G says: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true.

That matches case 3. So the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is when I is false and J is true.

Wait, let me recheck:

In case 3, I=F and J=T.

So the premises are:

P1: I ⇔ ~J → F ⇔ F → T (since ~J is F in this case)
P2: I ∨ J → F ∨ T → T

Conclusion: I → F

So in this case, premises are T, conclusion is F. So the argument is invalid, and this is a counterexample.

Looking at the options, G is the correct choice for invalidity with I=F and J=T.

But wait, let me see the options again.

The options are:

A: Valid. Contradiction
B: Invalid. I and J are true
C: Valid
D: Invalid. Both I and J false
E: Valid
F: Invalid when I=true, J=false
G: Invalid when I=false, J=true
H: Invalid when J=true, I=false
I: Invalid when I=false, J=false
J: Valid.

So, the counterexample is when I is false and J is true, which is option G.

So the correct answer is G.
</think>

The argument is invalid because in the case where I is false and J is true, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. This serves as a counterexample.

Answer: G
