Okay, so I need to find the area between the two functions f(x) and g(x) from x=1 to x=3. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that to find the area between two curves, I should subtract the lower function from the upper function and integrate that difference over the given interval. But before I can do that, I need to figure out which function is on top, which one is on the bottom in the interval [1,3].

Let me write down the functions again: f(x) is x² -4x +10 and g(x) is 4x -x². I might need to set them equal to each other to find their points of intersection, but since the interval is from 1 to 3, maybe I can just pick test points in that interval to see which function is larger.

Wait, but maybe I should subtract one from the other and see if the result is positive or negative in the interval. Let's subtract g(x) from f(x):

f(x) - g(x) = (x² -4x +10) - (4x -x²) = x² -4x +10 -4x +x² = 2x² -8x +10.

So, f(x) - g(x) = 2x² -8x +10. I need to see if this is positive or negative between x=1 and x=3. To do that, maybe compute its value at x=1 and x=3.

At x=1: 2(1)^2 -8(1) +10 = 2 -8 +10 = 4. That's positive.

At x=3: 2(9) -24 +10 = 18 -24 +10 = 4. Also positive.

Hmm, so f(x) - g(x) is positive at both ends. But is it always positive in between? Let's check the vertex of the quadratic 2x² -8x +10. The vertex occurs at x = -b/(2a) = 8/(4) = 2. So at x=2, which is within our interval, the value is:

2*(4) -16 +10 = 8 -16 +10 = 2. Still positive. So f(x) is above g(x) throughout the interval [1,3]. So the area is the integral of (f(x) - g(x)) dx from 1 to 3.

So, integrating 2x² -8x +10 from 1 to 3. Let's compute that.

The integral of 2x² is (2/3)x³. The integral of -8x is -4x². The integral of 10 is 10x. So putting it together:

Area = [ (2/3)x³ -4x² +10x ] evaluated at 3 minus evaluated at 1.

Let me compute at x=3 first:

(2/3)*(27) -4*(9) +10*(3) = 18 -36 +30 = 12.

Then at x=1:

(2/3)*(1) -4*(1) +10*(1) = 2/3 -4 +10 = 2/3 +6 = (2 +18)/3 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

So the area is 12 - (20/3) = (36/3 - 20/3) = 16/3 ≈5.333. But wait, that can't be right because looking at the answer options, I see option C is 8.129 and G is 5.333. Hmm, so 16/3 is approximately 5.333, which is option G. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, wait. Let me recompute the integral. Maybe I made a mistake in the integration step.

Wait, f(x) - g(x) is 2x² -8x +10. The integral from 1 to 3 is:

= [ (2/3)x³ -4x² +10x ] from 1 to 3.

At x=3:

(2/3)(27) = 18

-4*(9) = -36

10*3 =30

So 18 -36 +30 =12.

At x=1:

(2/3)(1) = 2/3 ≈0.6667

-4*(1) =-4

10*(1) =10

So 2/3 -4 +10 = 2/3 +6 = 6.6667 or 20/3.

So integral from 1 to 3 is 12 -20/3 = (36/3 -20/3)=16/3≈5.333.

Which is about 5.333, so option G. But the answer options have G as 5.333, which is exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, though, I thought f(x) was above g(x), but let me double-check by plugging in another value, say x=2.

f(2) =4 -8 +10=6

g(2)=8 -4=4. So f is above g here too. So my initial thought was correct.

So the area is 16/3, which is approximately 5.333.

The area between the curves is calculated by integrating the difference of the functions over the interval [1,3]. Since f(x) is above g(x) throughout the interval, the area is:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_{1}^{3} [f(x) - g(x)] \, dx = \int_{1}^{3} (2x^2 - 8x + 10) \, dx
\]

The integral of \(2x^2 - 8x + 10\) is:

\[
\frac{2}{3}x^3 - 4x^2 + 10x
\]

Evaluating from 1 to 3:

At \(x=3\): \(18 - 36 + 30 = 12\)

At \(x=1\): \(\frac{2}{3} - 4 + 10 = \frac{20}{3}\)

Subtracting: \(12 - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.333\).

Thus, the area is \(5.333\), corresponding to option G.
