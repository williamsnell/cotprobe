Question:

Charles Darwin was the first person to propose

Options:

A: that humans evolved from apes.
B: that evolution occurs.
C: that evolution occurs through a process of gradual change.
D: that the Earth is older than a few thousand years.
E: a mechanism for how evolution occurs.
F: a mechanism for evolution that was supported by evidence.
G: a complete taxonomy of all known species.
H: the idea of natural selection.
I: the theory of relativity.
J: the concept of genetic inheritance.

Okay, so I need to figure out which option is correct about Charles Darwin's contributions to evolution. Let's see, the question is asking for the first person to propose something related to evolution. The options are A through J, each proposing different theories.

First, I remember that Darwin was a big proponent of evolution. His main ideas were related to natural selection. Wait, wasn't he the first to put forward the idea that species evolve over generations? I think he wrote about this. So options B and C seem relevant.

Option B says "that evolution occurs." That sounds like a general statement, but maybe it's too broad. Option C is more specific: "that evolution occurs through a process of gradual change." That sounds more like what Darwin's theory was about. I think Darwin's theory was about gradual changes, so C might be the correct answer.

Other options: A talks about humans evolving from apes, which is more about the origins of human species, not evolution itself. D is about the Earth being older, which doesn't relate to evolution. E and F are about mechanisms, which I don't think Darwin was the first to propose. G is a complete taxonomy, which is too detailed and not his main contribution. H is about relativity, which is unrelated. J is about genetic inheritance, which isn't his main idea either.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be option C. It directly states that evolution occurs through gradual change, aligning with Darwin's main contribution.

The correct answer is C, as it directly states that evolution occurs through a process of gradual change, reflecting Darwin's key theory on evolution.

Answer: C
