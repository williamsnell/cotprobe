Okay, so I've got this question here about the duty owed by a possessor of land towards an undiscovered trespasser under common law principles. Hmm, I need to figure out which statement isn't correct. Let's break it down.

The options are A to D. I remember from my property law classes that when it comes to duties, the type of condition—whether it's artificial, natural, or active—plays a big role. The question is about the duties regarding the conditions that the possessor has discovered and not yet taken action against.

Option A says there's no duty for artificial conditions. I think artificial conditions are things like fences, barriers, or other structures that the owner has built to prevent trespassers. So, if the owner built something artificial, they aren't legally responsible for it. That makes sense because you can't sue for building a fence to keep someone out. So A seems correct.

Option B states there's a duty for natural conditions. Natural conditions would be things like natural barriers, such as a dam, a cliff, or a riverbank. The owner is responsible because they built them as natural barriers to prevent trespassers. So B is a correct statement.

Option C says there's no duty for natural conditions. Wait, that can't be right because option B is correct. So if C is the opposite, then C would be the incorrect statement. So C is the wrong answer because it's the opposite of B.

Option D says there's no duty for active operations. Active operations would involve someone who's in the process of building an obstacle, like a wall or a structure being constructed. Under common law, the owner is responsible for any ongoing actions that are part of their duty to protect their land. So D is correct.

Wait, let me make sure I'm getting this right. The common law principle requires the owner to have a duty under the circumstances. So if the condition is artificial, no duty. If it's natural, yes. If someone is actively building something (active operations), the owner is responsible. So the incorrect statement is C because it's the opposite of B. So the correct answer is C.

The correct answer is **C: No duty for natural conditions.** This is because the correct statement is option B, which correctly identifies that the owner has a duty for natural conditions. Option C is the opposite of B and therefore incorrect.

Answer: C
