Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about some philosophy concepts. Let me think through it step by step to figure out the right answer.

The question is asking about the theory that says mental states are nothing but brain states. The options are A to J, each representing different theories.

First, I need to remember what each of these terms refers to. Let's go through them one by one.

Monism, which is option A, I think refers to a view where all things are one, but I'm not sure how it relates to mental states being brain states. Monism might be about everything being the same, so maybe that's not it.

Functionalism, option B, is about functions. It posits that mental states are due to the functions they perform. So if a mental state is the function it serves, maybe that fits. Because mental states are what's causing the brain to do certain things. But wait, the question says mental states are just brain states. Hmm, not exactly the same. Maybe functionalism is more about the functional role rather than the composition.

Dualism, option D, is interesting. I remember that's the idea that mind and body are distinct, and there's a split between them. Some theories of dualism suggest that mental states are a subset of brain states, but others might present it differently. Or perhaps dualism implies that the mind is separate, so the brain doesn't encompass all mental states.

Option E, brain theory, seems a bit off. I don't think that's a standard term. Maybe it's a misnomer.

Logical behaviorism, F, is about how behaviors can be explained by behaviors, rather than mental states. So it's about how behavior arises from functions of the brain. Not directly about whether mental states are just brain states.

Eliminative materialism, G, I'm not too familiar with this. It sounds like it's about the physical basis of mental states, maybe suggesting that mental states are physical properties of the brain. So perhaps this is about the nature of mental states being physical, not just brain states.

Physicalism, option H, is the idea that everything is physical. So all mental states are physical processes, which would mean they are part of the brain. But that might be a broader term than the specific theory in the question.

Epiphenominalism, I, I think refers to the idea that mental phenomena are supervenient on physical states, meaning they depend on physical properties but aren't reducible to them. So it's about the nature of mental states being determined by the physical states of the brain.

Reductionism, J, is the opposite of monism. It's the belief that a complex system can be reduced to its simpler components. So if mental states are just brain states, reductionism would be the oppositeâ€”maybe the brain isn't the most fundamental level.

Now, going back to the question. It's about mental states being the same as brain states. So the theory would say that mental phenomena are entirely reducible to brain processes. That seems to align with physicalism, but physicalism is a broader idea. Wait, but physicalism says everything is physical, so mental states are physical, which might mean that they are part of the brain. Alternatively, maybe it's about whether the mental state is reducible to the brain.

Wait, the options are more specific. So the question is about the theory that says mental states are nothing but brain states. So which theory states that mental states are just physical processes (i.e., part of brain states) rather than being a separate entity.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think about each option again.

Dualism (D) is the idea that mind and body are distinct, but it doesn't necessarily state that mental states are just brain states. It's more about the separation between mind and physical processes.

Functionalism (B) focuses on the functions of mental states. So perhaps functionalism isn't the right answer, because it's more about what's functional, not just the composition.

Epiphenominalism (I) is the idea that mental phenomena are dependent on physical states but aren't reducible to them. So it's about how mental states are determined by the physical, not that they are just the physical.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: which term refers to the idea that mental states are physical, so they're part of the brain. That would point towards physicalism. But physicalism is more of a broader concept, not a specific theory.

Wait, but the question is about the theory that says mental states are nothing but brain states. So what theory posits that mental states are just physical, and thus reducible to brain states.

Alternatively, the term "physicalism" might not be the answer because it's a broader concept. The term that directly states the reduction of mental states to brain states might be "eliminative materialism." Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the term "eliminative materialism" is often discussed in relation to the brain. It suggests that mental states are physical properties of the brain. So this would mean that mental states are part of the brain's physical processes. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the same as saying they're just brain states.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think about each option again.

Option H: Physicalism. It says everything is physical. So it's about whether mental states are physical, which would mean they are part of the brain. But that's a broader statement.

Epiphenominalism (I) is about the nature of mental states, which are dependent on physical states but not reducible to them.

So the question is about whether the mental state is a separate entity or a subset of brain states.

Wait, I think the correct answer is physicalism. But wait, no. Because physicalism is about everything being physical, but the question is about whether mental states are just brain states, not necessarily that all physical things are.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct term is "eliminative materialism," which is the view that mental states are physical properties of the brain, so they are reducible to the brain's physical states.

Wait, but another thought: the term I'm looking for is "eliminative materialism," which is about the brain being the only fundamental entity. It suggests that mental states are physical, so they are part of the brain.

Wait, but the question is about the theory that says mental states are nothing but brain states. So if it's eliminative materialism, that's about the brain being the only thing that's fundamental. So perhaps this is the right answer.

Wait, to clarify, I think the correct term is "eliminative materialism," which posits that the only fundamental entity is the brain, and so mental states are physical and reducible to brain states. So the answer would be G.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the term "eliminative materialism" might refer to the idea that the brain is the only fundamental entity and that mental states are physical properties of the brain. So, in that case, mental states are part of the brain's physical states.

Alternatively, the term "functionalism" is about functions, not about composition. So, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is "physicalism" because it's about everything being physical, but the question is about whether mental states are just brain states. Alternatively, the term "eliminative materialism" may be the one that says the mind is reducible to the brain's physical states.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each option again.

Option H: Physicalism. It says everything is physical, so this includes the idea that mental states are physical. But the question is about whether they are just the brain's states.

Wait, what's the difference between physicalism and eliminative materialism? Maybe physicalism is more about the reduction of everything to physical, while eliminative materialism is about the brain being the only fundamental entity.

Wait, I think the correct term for the theory that says mental states are just brain states is "eliminative materialism," which is option G.

Alternatively, if the question is about the theory that says mental states are just physical (i.e., part of brain states), then that's physicalism. But that's not an option. Wait, no, option H is physicalism, but it's a broader statement.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The question says, "mental states are nothing but brain states." So, the theory is that mental states are just brain states, not necessarily that they are reducible.

Wait, maybe that's physicalism. But again, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's "eliminative materialism," which is about the brain being the only fundamental entity, so mental states are physical, hence part of the brain.

Wait, another thought: the term "eliminative materialism" refers to the idea that the only fundamental entity is the brain, and so mental states are physical, reducible to brain states. So, that would fit the question.

So the correct answer would be G: eliminative materialism.
</think>

The question asks which theory posits that mental states are nothing but brain states. To determine the correct answer, each option is analyzed:

- **A: Monism** - Refers to a theory where all things are one, but it doesn't directly address the composition of mental states as brain states.
- **B: Functionalism** - Focuses on functions rather than composition, so it doesn't fit.
- **C: Identity Theory** - Not relevant here.
- **D: Dualism** - Suggests mind and body are distinct, but it doesn't clarify whether mental states are brain states.
- **E: Brain Theory** - Unlikely to be a standard term.
- **F: Logical Behaviorism** - Deals with behaviors rather than mental states.
- **G: Eliminative Materialism** - This term refers to the idea that the brain is the only fundamental entity, suggesting mental states are physical and reducible to brain states. This aligns with the question's assertion.
- **H: Physicalism** - States everything is physical, which includes mental states, but it's broader than the specific theory.
- **J: Reductionism** - Opposite of monism, not relevant.

The term "eliminative materialism" fits the question, as it emphasizes the brain being the only fundamental entity, implying mental states are physical and reducible to brain states.
