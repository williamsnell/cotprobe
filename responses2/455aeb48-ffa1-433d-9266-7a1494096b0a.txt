Okay, so I've got this paint area calculation question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about how much area one liter of paint can cover when it's applied uniformly with a thickness of 100 microns. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that paint's coverage depends on its thickness and the volume used. So, the formula must relate liters of paint to area. I think the key is to convert units because the thickness is given in micrometers, which is a very small unit. Let me jot down what I know.

First, the volume of paint is one liter. I know that 1 liter is 0.001 cubic meters. But wait, let me confirm that. Oh yeah, 1 cubic meter is 1000 liters, so 1 liter is indeed 0.001 m³.

The thickness is 100 micrometers. Oh wait, micrometers are micro, which is 1e-6 meters. So 100 micrometers is 100e-6 meters, which is 0.0001 meters. Or wait, 1e-6 is a millionth, so 100e-6 is 1e-4 meters. Yeah, 0.0001 meters.

The formula I think applies here is Volume = Area × Thickness. So, rearranging that, Area = Volume / Thickness. Oh wait, but wait—does this apply when the thickness is in the same units as the volume? Let me think. 

The volume is in cubic meters, and the thickness is in meters. So, when I divide cubic meters by meters, I get square meters. That makes sense because area is in square meters.

So plugging in the numbers: Volume is 0.001 m³, and thickness is 0.0001 m. 

Area = 0.001 m³ / 0.0001 m = 10 m². So the area would be 10 square meters.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 100 micrometers is 0.0001 meters. So 100 micrometers = 1e-4 meters. 

So 0.001 / 0.0001 = 10. Yes, that's right. So one liter (0.001 m³) divided by 0.0001 m (thickness) equals 10 m². So the area covered is 10 m².

Looking at the options, option F is 10 m². So the correct answer should be F.

To determine how much area one liter of paint covers at a thickness of 100 micrometers, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\text{Volume}}{\text{Thickness}}
\]

Given:
- Volume = 1 liter = \(0.001 \, \text{m}^3\)
- Thickness = \(100 \, \mu\text{m} = 0.0001 \, \text{m}\)

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{0.001}{0.0001} = 10 \, \text{m}^2
\]

The correct answer is **F: 10 m²**.

Answer: F
