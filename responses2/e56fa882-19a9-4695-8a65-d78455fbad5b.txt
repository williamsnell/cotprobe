Okay, so I have this equation to solve: (1/25) raised to the power of (x + 2) equals 125 raised to the power of (-x). Hmm, I remember that when dealing with exponents, especially with fractions and different bases, it's helpful to express both sides with the same base. That way, I can set the exponents equal to each other, which simplifies solving for x.

Let me think about 1/25 and 125. Wait, 25 is 5 squared, so 1/25 is 5 to the power of -2. Similarly, 125 is 5 cubed, so 125 is 5^3. Oh, that's a good start because both sides can be expressed with base 5. So I can rewrite the equation using base 5.

So, (1/25)^(x + 2) becomes (5^-2) raised to (x + 2). Using the exponent rule (a^b)^c = a^(b*c), that becomes 5^(-2*(x + 2)). Let me compute that exponent: -2*(x + 2) is -2x -4. So, the left side simplifies to 5^(-2x -4).

On the right side, 125^(-x) is (5^3)^(-x). Again, using the same exponent rule, that becomes 5^(3*(-x)) which is 5^(-3x).

Now, the equation is 5^(-2x -4) = 5^(-3x). Since the bases are the same and the equation holds, the exponents must be equal. So, I can set -2x -4 equal to -3x.

Let me write that down: -2x -4 = -3x. I'll solve for x. Adding 3x to both sides gives me (-2x + 3x) -4 = 0, which simplifies to x -4 = 0. Then, adding 4 to both sides, x equals 4.

Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the original equation: (1/25)^(x + 2) = 125^(-x). Expressing both sides with base 5: 5^(-2x -4) = 5^(-3x). So exponents must be equal: -2x -4 = -3x. Adding 3x to both sides: x -4 = 0 â†’ x =4. Yep, that seems right.

Looking at the options, 4 is option C. So I think the answer is C:4.

To solve the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{25}\right)^{x + 2} = 125^{-x}
\]

we rewrite both sides with base 5:

\[
5^{-2(x + 2)} = 5^{-3x}
\]

Since the bases are equal, set the exponents equal:

\[
-2x -4 = -3x
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = 4
\]

**Answer:** C: 4

Answer:
\boxed{C}
