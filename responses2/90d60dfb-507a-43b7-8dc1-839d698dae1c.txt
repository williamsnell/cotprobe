Okay, so I have this problem about J. S. Bacq& Co. running a "penny arcade." I need to figure out how many people must visit the arcade weekly to make a $1,000 profit. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll list out the information given. The fixed costs include wages and electricity, which are $500 per week. Upkeep and miscellaneous are $100 per week. So, the total fixed costs are $500 + $100 = $600 per week.

They're distributing a surprise gift to each customer, and each gift costs $2.00. So, the variable cost per customer is $2.00. The admission charge is $6.00 each time someone comes in.

The management wants a weekly profit of $1,000. So, we need to calculate the number of customers (let's call this number 'C') that will result in a profit of $1,000.

Let's break down the income and costs. The total revenue from 'C' customers would be $6.00 multiplied by C, so 6C dollars.

The total variable cost is the cost per customer times the number of customers, which is 2C dollars.

Then, we subtract the fixed and variable costs from the revenue to get the profit.

So, Profit = Revenue - Total Costs.

Plugging in the numbers:

Profit = (6C) - (500 + 100 + 2C).

Simplify that:

Profit = 6C - 600 - 2C.

Which simplifies to:

Profit = (6C - 2C) - 600 → Profit = 4C - 600.

We know the desired profit is $1,000:

1000 = 4C - 600.

Now, solve for C:

Add 600 to both sides:

1000 + 600 = 4C → 1600 = 4C.

Divide both sides by 4:

C = 1600 / 4 → 400.

So, 400 customers are needed to make a $1,000 profit.

Looking at the options, option J is 400. So the correct answer should be J.

To determine how many customers are needed to achieve a $1,000 profit, let's break down the costs and revenue:

- **Fixed Costs**: $600 per week ($500 + $100).
- **Variable Costs**: $2.00 per customer.
- **Revenue**: $6.00 per customer.
- **Desired Profit**: $1,000.

The profit equation is:
\[ \text{Profit} = (\text{Revenue} - \text{Variable Costs}) - \text{Fixed Costs} \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ 1000 = (6C - 2C) - 600 \]
\[ 1000 = 4C - 600 \]
\[ 4C = 1600 \]
\[ C = 400 \]

Thus, **400 customers** are needed. The correct answer is **J: Four hundred customers**.
