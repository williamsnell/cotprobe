Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the heat required to change ice to steam. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says: How much heat is required to change 25 kg of ice at -10 °C to steam at 100°C? The options are given in Cal units, which I think are Calories. I think 1 Calorie is about 4184 J, but sometimes people use Cal as a unit. Oh wait, sometimes in some contexts, Cal is used as 1 Cal = 4186 J. Maybe the problem is using Cal as the unit, but I can probably work with it regardless.

So, I remember that when changing a substance from a solid to a gas, it goes through several phases: solid to liquid (melting), liquid to gas (vaporization), and also the temperature change for each phase. So, the total heat required would be the sum of the heat required for each of these steps.

Let me break it down into steps:

1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C.
2. Melting the ice into water at 0°C.
3. Heating the water from 0°C to 100°C.
4. Vaporizing the water into steam at 100°C.

Wait, but I think I should also consider if the final steam is at 100°C, so all the water would be vaporized. So, for each step, I need to calculate the heat.

First, I'll list all the steps:

a) Ice to water: temperature change from -10 to 0°C. Since the ice is starting at -10, I need to warm it up to 0.

b) Ice to water: when ice melts, it's going from 0°C to 100°C. That's a phase change.

c) Water to steam: from 100°C to 100°C, so no temperature change here, just vaporization.

So, I need to calculate each of these.

Let me jot down the given data:

Mass, m = 25 kg.

Temperature changes:

For step a: ΔT = 0 - (-10) = +10°C.

Step b: ΔT = 100 - 0 = 100°C.

Then, phase changes.

Specific heats:

I think the specific heat of ice is about 2.09 J/g°C. Wait, wait. Or is that per kg? Oh, probably per gram because the mass is in kg. So, 2.09 J/(g·°C) is correct.

Specific heat of water: 4.186 J/(g·°C).

Latent heat of fusion (melting) for ice: 334 J/g. Wait, no, 334 J/g is the latent heat for melting, but that's per gram. So for 25 kg (25,000 grams), that's 25,000 * 334 J.

Latent heat of vaporization: 2260 J/g. Again, per gram, so 25,000 * 2260 J.

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The latent heats are per gram. So, for each gram, you need 334 J to melt ice, and 2260 J to vaporize water.

Wait, but sometimes I've seen these numbers in kJ units. Oh, but the options are in Cal. So perhaps I should convert each step's heat into calories.

Wait, Cal is often considered as 1 Cal = 4184 J. So, the heat required is in Cal, so I should calculate each step in J and then convert to Cal by dividing by 4184.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact values. Let me make a table.

Step a: Heating ice from -10°C to 0°C.

Heat required, Q1 = m * c_ice * ΔT.

So, m = 25 kg = 25,000 g.

c_ice = 2.09 J/(g°C).

ΔT = 10°C.

So,

Q1 = 25,000 * 2.09 * 10 = 25,000 * 20.9 = 522,500 J.

Wait, 25,000 * 20.9 = 522,500 J.

Step b: Melting ice into water.

Q2 = m * L_fusion.

L_fusion = 334 J/g. So,

25,000 g * 334 J/g = 8,350,000 J.

Step c: Heating water from 0°C to 100°C.

Q3 = m * c_water * ΔT.

c_water = 4.186 J/(g°C).

ΔT = 100°C.

So,

25,000 * 4.186 * 100 = 25,000 * 418.6 = 10,465,000 J.

Step d: Vaporizing water into steam.

Q4 = m * L_vaporization.

L_vaporization = 2260 J/g.

So,

25,000 * 2260 = 56,500,000 J.

Wait, but wait, in step d, the temperature doesn't change because it's already at 100°C, so no ΔT, just heat of vaporization.

Now, sum all the Q's:

Total Q = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4.

Let me compute each:

Q1: 522,500 J.

Q2: 8,350,000 J.

Q3: 10,465,000 J.

Q4: 56,500,000 J.

Adding them up:

522500 + 8350000 = 8872500.

8872500 +10465000 = 19337500.

19337500 +56500000 = 75837500 J.

Wait, 56500000 is 56,500,000. So, adding 19,337,500 (that's 19 million) plus 56,500,000 gives 75,837,500 J. Wait, no, 19,337,500 plus 56,500,000 is 75,837,500 J.

So, total Q is 75,837,500 J.

Now, convert J to Cal. Since 1 Cal is approximately 4184 J.

So, 75,837,500 / 4184 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

Divide 75,837,500 by 4184.

Hmm, let's see. Let's approximate.

First, 4184 * 18,000 = ?

4184 * 10,000 = 41,840,000.

4184 * 8,000 = 33,472,000.

So, 4184 * 18,000 = 41,840,000 + 33,472,000 = 75,312,000 J.

Wait, because 4184 * 10,000 is 41,840,000.

Wait wait, no. Wait, 4184 * 18,000 = 4184 * (10,000 + 8,000) = 41,840,000 + 33,472,000 = 75,312,000 J.

But our total is 75,837,500 J.

So, 75,312,000 is from 18,000 Cal.

Subtracting: 75,837,500 - 75,312,000 = 525,500 J.

So, 525,500 J / 4184 J/Cal = approximately... let's compute.

4184 * 125 = ?

4184 * 100 = 418,400.

4184 * 20 = 83,680. So 418,400 + 83,680 = 502,080.

4184 * 5 = 20,920. So, total for 125: 502,080 +20,920 = 523,000 J.

We have 525,500 J left. So 125 Cal gives 523,000 J. The remaining is 2,500 J.

2,500 J / 4184 J/Cal ≈ 0.599 Cal.

So total is 18,000 + 125 + 0.599 ≈ 18,125.6 Cal.

But looking at the options, the closest one is around 18,000 Cal. Because the options are all multiples of 10,000. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:21,000 Cal

B:15,000 Cal

C:23,000 Cal

D:16,000 Cal

E:18,000 Cal

F:25,000 Cal

G:22,500 Cal

H:17,500 Cal

I:20,000 Cal

J:19,000 Cal

So our calculation is approximately 18,125 Cal. The closest option is J:19,000 Cal, but wait, 18,125 is closer to 18,000 than 19,000. So why? Oh wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me recalculate the total Q.

Wait, in step a, I have 522,500 J. That's correct.

Step b:8,350,000 J. So total after a and b is 8,872,500 J.

Step c:10,465,000 J. Adding that gives 19,337,500 J.

Step d:56,500,000 J. Adding all, 75,837,500 J.

Divide by 4184 to get Cal.

Wait, 75,837,500 / 4184.

Let me compute 75,837,500 ÷ 4184.

First, 4184 * 18,000 = 75,312,000.

75,837,500 -75,312,000 = 525,500.

525,500 ÷ 4184 ≈ 125.6.

So 18,000 + 125.6 = 18,125.6 Cal.

So approximately 18,126 Cal.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option J:19,000 Cal. But that's about 875 Cal more than our calculation. Hmm, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the steps. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the heat required for the phase changes.

Wait, ice to water: that's +10°C, correct.

Melting: 25,000 g * 334 J/g = 8,350,000 J. Correct.

Water to steam: 100°C to 100°C, so no heat in that step, just heat of vaporization.

Heat of vaporization per gram is 2260 J/g.

So 25,000 * 2260 = 56,500,000 J. Correct.

So total Q is 522,500 + 8,350,000 = 8,872,500 J for steps a and b.

Adding c: 8,872,500 +10,465,000 = 19,337,500 J.

Adding d: 19,337,500 +56,500,000 = 75,837,500 J.

75,837,500 J is 75,837,500 /4184 = let me compute more accurately.

75,837,500 ÷4184.

Divide 75,837,500 by 4184.

Let me calculate step by step:

4184 * 18,000 = 75,312,000.

Subtract from 75,837,500: 75,837,500 -75,312,000 = 525,500.

525,500 ÷4184 = let's see.

4184 × 125 = 523,000.

So 523,000. So 525,500 -523,000 =2,500.

So 2,500 ÷4184 ≈ 0.599.

So total is 18,000 +125 + 0.599 = 18,125.599 Cal.

So approximately 18,126 Cal.

But the options don't have this number. The closest option is J, 19,000. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in which step requires Cal.

Wait, perhaps I confused some steps. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I forgot that the latent heat of vaporization is in kJ? No, the options are in Cal, so I should have converted correctly.

Wait, no, the calculation is correct in J, and then converted to Cal, which is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have considered that the ice is starting at -10, so the phase changes. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in step c.

Wait, step c is water at 100 to steam at 100. So no temperature change, so no Q.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the phase changes separately, but no, all steps are correctly computed.

Wait, what's the exact calculation when I divide 75,837,500 J by 4184?

Let me try a different approach.

Compute 75,837,500 ÷ 4184.

I can do this division step by step.

First, 4184 x 18,000 = 75,312,000.

Subtract, 75,837,500 - 75,312,000 = 525,500.

Now, 4184 x 125 = 523,000.

Subtract: 525,500 -523,000=2,500.

So that's 125 and 2,500/4184.

2,500 ÷4184: 4184 ×0.599 ≈ 2500. So total is 125.599.

So 18,000 + 125.599 =18,125.599 Cal, which is approximately 18,126 Cal.

But none of the options match that. The options are in multiples of 10,000.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the heat for melting. Let me recheck that.

Wait, the heat for melting is m * L_fusion.

L_fusion is 334 J/g. So, 25,000 * 334 = ?

334 * 25,000: 334 *25 = 8,350. So 8,350 * 1000 =8,350,000 J. Correct.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem was considering that the ice starts at a lower temperature, but perhaps I forgot that heat is also needed for the phase change when the temperature is below the melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the latent heat of fusion in kilojoules, but no, the options are in Cal, which is 4184 J. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the steps.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the phase changes as separate steps but I think I did that correctly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem incorrectly uses the latent heat of vaporization as 2260 J/g, but perhaps it's more accurate as 2259 J/g. Hmm, but no, I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the heat of fusion. Let me recheck.

Wait, 25,000 g *334 J/g = 25,000 *334 = 8,350,000 J. Correct.

So, all steps are correctly computed.

Therefore, the total heat required is approximately 18,126 Cal.

But the options given are:

A:21,000

B:15,000

C:23,000

D:16,000

E:18,000

F:25,000

G:22,500

H:17,500

I:20,000

J:19,000

So the closest option is E:18,000 Cal. But wait, the calculation is 18,126, which is about 126 more than 18,000.

Wait, but wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the steps. Let me re-express the steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the ice is at 0°C, so the initial calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the ice is at -10°C, so the steps are correct.

Hmm, I'm getting a result that's approximately 18,126 Cal, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me re-express the calculation.

Wait, Q = 75,837,500 J.

Divide by 4184 J/Cal:

75,837,500 / 4184 = ?

Let me compute this division:

Compute 75,837,500 ÷ 4184.

Let me compute how many times 4184 fits into 75,837,500.

4184 × 18,000 =75,312,000.

Subtract: 75,837,500 -75,312,000 =525,500.

Now, 525,500 ÷4184 = let's see.

4184 ×125 = 523,000.

Subtract, 525,500 -523,000=2,500.

2,500 ÷4184 ≈0.599.

So total is 18,000 + 125 + 0.599= 18,125.599 Cal.

So approx 18,126 Cal.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is E:18,000 Cal.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation is approximate, and the correct answer is in option E. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the phase changes are done at the correct temperatures. So no, the steps are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the ice is starting at -10°C, and the final state is steam at 100°C. So heat is required for each step.

Wait, another approach: perhaps use the formula for heating ice to water to steam, considering the three temperature changes.

Wait, the formula is:

Q = m [c_ice (T1 - T0) + L_fusion + c_water (T2 - T1) + L_vaporization]

But in this case, T1 is 0°C, T2 is 100°C.

So,

Q = m [c_ice (T1 - T0) + L_fusion + c_water (T2 - T1) + L_vaporization]

Wait, that's another way to compute.

Let me compute each term:

First term: c_ice (T1 - T0) = 2.09 J/g°C (0 - (-10)) = 2.09 *10 =20.9 J/g.

Second term: L_fusion =334 J/g.

Third term: c_water (T2-T1) =4.186 J/g°C (100 -0) =418.6 J/g.

Fourth term: L_vaporization=2260 J/g.

So,

Q = m (20.9 + 334 +418.6 +2260) J.

m is 25,000 g.

So,

20.9 +334 =354.9.

354.9 +418.6=773.5.

773.5 +2260=2, 973.5.

Wait, no. 773.5 +2260=3033.5 J/g.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, each term is in J/g, and m is in g, so the sum is in J.

Wait, but wait, no. The sum is 20.9 +334 +418.6 +2260 = 20.9 +334 =354.9; 354.9 +418.6=773.5; 773.5 +2260=3033.5 J.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait, this approach is incorrect because each term is per gram. So the sum would be in J/g, but multiplied by m (g) to get J.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me re-express.

Wait, the first term is c_ice (T1 - T0) =2.09 J/g°C * (0 - (-10)) =2.09 *10=20.9 J/g.

But wait, no. Wait, T1 is 0°C, T0 is -10°C. So T1 - T0 is 10°C. So the term is 2.09 J/g°C *10°C =20.9 J/g.

Similarly, the second term is L_fusion =334 J/g.

Third term: c_water (T2 - T1)=4.186 J/g°C*(100 - 0)=4.186 *100=418.6 J/g.

Fourth term: L_vaporization=2260 J/g.

So, each term is in J/g.

So, each term is multiplied by m (g) to get J.

So, Q is the sum of all terms multiplied by m.

So,

Q = m [20.9 +334 +418.6 +2260] J.

Compute the sum inside the brackets:

20.9 +334 = 354.9.

354.9 +418.6 =773.5.

773.5 +2260 =3033.5.

Wait, no. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because 20.9 +334 is 354.9, 354.9 +418.6 is 773.5, 773.5 +2260 is 3033.5. But that's the sum of the terms, not multiplied by m.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait, each term is in J/g, so the sum is in J/g. Then, the sum multiplied by m (g) gives J.

So,

Sum of terms: 20.9 +334 +418.6 +2260 = 3033.5 J/g.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the sum is in J/g, and m is in g, so the total is J.

Wait, no, no, no, no. Let me recheck.

Each term is in J/g.

So, sum is in J/g.

Multiply by m (g) gives J.

So,

Sum =20.9 +334 +418.6 +2260 =3033.5 J/g.

Multiply by m (25,000 g):

Q=3033.5 J/g *25,000 g =75,837,500 J.

Yes, same as before.

So, 75,837,500 J =75,837,500 /4184 Cal.

Which, as before, is approximately 18,126 Cal. But the options don't have this. The closest is E:18,000 Cal.

Wait, but the problem asks for the heat in Cal, and the calculation gives about 18,000 Cal. So perhaps the correct answer is E:18,000 Cal.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the calculation is 18,126, which is about 18,000. So perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, but let me think again: perhaps I made a mistake in the heat of fusion. Let me double-check.

Wait, the heat of fusion is 334 J/g. So 25,000 g * 334 J/g =8,350,000 J. Correct.

Heat of vaporization is 2260 J/g. 25,000 *2260=56,500,000 J. Correct.

So, the calculation is correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is E:18,000 Cal.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in which step requires Cal. Let me think again.

Wait, no, all steps are in J, so the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the ice is at -10°C, so the phase changes are done at higher temperatures, which would require more heat.

Wait, no, that's not the case. The heat of fusion and vaporization are the same regardless of the temperature at which they are measured.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the heat of vaporization per gram. Let me recheck.

Wait, 2260 J/g is correct.

Yes, so I think all steps are correct, and the calculation is correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is E:18,000 Cal.

Wait, but according to the calculation, it's approximately 18,126 Cal. So, perhaps the intended answer is E:18,000 Cal.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the problem intended to use the latent heat of fusion as 334 kJ, but no, the options are in Cal, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the heat of vaporization. Let me recheck.

Wait, 2260 J/g is correct, so 25,000 *2260 =56,500,000 J. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is E:18,000 Cal.

But wait, another approach: perhaps I should have considered that the phase changes are done at the same temperature, so no heat is required for the temperature change. So, the calculation is correct.

Hmm, but given that, perhaps the correct answer is E:18,000 Cal.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Options are:

A:21,000

B:15,000

C:23,000

D:16,000

E:18,000

F:25,000

G:22,500

H:17,500

I:20,000

J:19,000

So, the correct calculation is approximately 18,126, which is closest to E:18,000.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the ice is at -10°C, so the heat of fusion is 334 J/g, but perhaps, in the calculation, I should have considered that the latent heat of fusion is 334 kJ, but the problem states the options are in Cal, so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the ice is at -10°C, so the heat of fusion is 334 J/g, but perhaps I should have considered that the heat of fusion is 334 kJ, but that's not possible, as the options are in Cal.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the ice is at -10°C, so the heat of fusion is 334 J/g, but perhaps I should have considered that the heat of fusion is 334 kJ, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the latent heat of vaporization is 2259 J/g, but no, the options are in Cal.

Wait, perhaps I should have converted the Q from J to Cal, but that's already done.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the ice is at -10°C, so the heat of fusion is 334 J/g, but perhaps I should have considered that the heat of fusion is 334 kJ, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the heat of fusion is 334 kJ, but no, the options are in Cal.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the phase changes are done at the same temperature, so no heat is required for the temperature change. So, the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is E:18,000 Cal.

But given that, I think the correct answer is E:18,000 Cal.

To determine the total heat required to change 25 kg of ice at -10°C to steam at 100°C, we calculate the heat required for each phase change (melting, vaporization) and sum them. The calculations are as follows:

1. **Melting Ice to Water**:  
   Heat required = \( m \cdot L_fusion \)  
   \( L_fusion = 334 \, \text{J/g} \)  
   \( m = 25,000 \, \text{g} \)  
   \( Q_1 = 25,000 \cdot 334 = 8,350,000 \, \text{J} \)

2. **Water to Steam**:  
   Heat required = \( m \cdot L_vaporization \)  
   \( L_vaporization = 2260 \, \text{J/g} \)  
   \( Q_2 = 25,000 \cdot 2260 = 56,500,000 \, \text{J} \)

3. **Total Heat**:  
   \( Q_{\text{total}} = Q_1 + Q_2 = 8,350,000 + 56,500,000 = 64,850,000 \, \text{J} \)

Convert total heat from joules to calories:  
\( 1 \, \text{Cal} = 4184 \, \text{J} \)  
\( Q_{\text{total}} = \frac{64,850,000}{4184} \approx 15,500 \, \text{Cal} \)

However, upon re-evaluation, the correct calculation for the total heat is approximately **18,126 Cal**. The closest option provided is **E:18,000 Cal**.
