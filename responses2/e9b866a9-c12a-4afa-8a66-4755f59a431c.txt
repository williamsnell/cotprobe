Okay, so I have this question about the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's go through each option step by step.

The question is asking which statement is correct regarding the FUTA. The options are A to J. I remember that FUTA is a tax on unemployment, which is separate from Social Security. So, the options likely involve whether FUTA covers certain situations.

First, let's recall what FUTA entails. FUTA is a federal tax on unemployment benefits. It's imposed on employers and employees. The Act is designed to help people who lose their jobs through underpayment of Social Security benefits. The federal government collects taxes on the part of employees who lose their jobs, and the employer pays the rest. That means FUTA benefits are given to the employee after the employer covers the payroll tax.

Now, let's go through each option.

Option A: "The unemployment insurance system is administered by the states through their employment laws." Hmm, I don't think that's right. I believe FUTA is a federal program, not a state one. So A is incorrect.

Option B: "The Act is intended to provide financial assistance to unemployed workers who have been laid off due to seasonal changes in demand." No, FUTA is about benefits, not financial assistance for temporary layoffs. So B is wrong.

Option C: "An employee who resigns regardless of cause is eligible for unemployment benefits." Wait, I think that's not correct. FUTA benefits are typically given to employees who are out of work for at least 6 months, not just because of a season. So C is incorrect.

Option D: "An employee who is fired for cause is eligible for unemployment benefits." Yes, that makes sense. FUTA benefits are intended for employees who are terminated for good cause, meaning there's a legitimate reason for the separation of employment. So D sounds correct.

Option E: "The Act is intended to assist workers who are permanently out of work and need assistance in supporting themselves." FUTA is for temporary unemployment, not permanent. So E is wrong.

Option F: "The Act mandates that employers provide health insurance to employees who are unemployed." No, FUTA is about unemployment benefits, not health insurance. FUTA doesn't require employers to provide health insurance, so F is incorrect.

Option G: "The federal unemployment system is funded solely by employee taxes." No, FUTA is funded by both employer and employee taxes. The employer pays the unemployment taxes, and the employee pays their part. So G is incorrect.

Option H: "The federal unemployment system is funded by both employer and employee taxes." Yes, that's correct. The FUTA tax is imposed on both employees and employers, so H is correct.

Option I: "The Act also covers compensation for self-employed individuals." FUTA is mainly for employees, not self-employed. Self-employed employees typically pay their own taxes, so I think FUTA doesn't cover them. So I is incorrect.

Option J: "The Act is enforced by the Federal Labor Relations Authority." No, FUTA is handled by the Internal Revenue Service. The federal labor relations authority is more involved in labor unions and labor issues. So J is incorrect.

Wait, so looking back, H and D are both correct? Or did I mix up something?

Wait, let me double-check. FUTA is provided by both employer and employee taxes, so H is correct. D is correct because FUTA benefits are for employees who are fired for cause, which is a valid reason for termination.

So the question asks which statement is correct; there might be more than one correct, but the options are individual statements. Let me check each again.

Looking at H again: "The federal unemployment system is funded solely by employee taxes." No, FUTA is funded by both employer and employee taxes. So H is incorrect.

D is correct because FUTA benefits are given to employees who are terminated for cause. So the correct statements would be both D and H? But the options are single-choice, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the FUTA system is funded by the employer's taxes. Let me think again. The FUTA tax is collected by employers, and then the employee pays their part. So the federal government doesn't "funding" it; it's the employer and employee that contribute. So H is incorrect because it says "funded solely by employee taxes," but FUTA is funded by both.

So the correct statements are D and H. But the options are single-choice, so perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me think of the options again.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct. So which of the options is correct?

Looking back at the options, H says the system is funded by both. That's incorrect because FUTA is funded by both employer and employee taxes. So H is wrong.

So the correct statements are D and H, but since H is incorrect, perhaps D is the only correct one.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is D and H, but I have to choose between the options.

Let me recheck each option.

Option D: "An employee who is fired for cause is eligible..." Yes, correct.

Option H: "The federal unemployment system is funded solely by employee taxes." No, it's funded by both. So H is wrong.

So the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D: "An employee who is fired for cause is eligible for unemployment benefits." 

**Explanation:**

The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) is a federal tax on unemployment benefits. It is designed to provide financial assistance to employees who are terminated for cause, which is a legitimate reason for separation of employment. FUTA benefits are granted to employees who are out of work for at least 6 months, regardless of the cause of their termination. 

- **Option A** is incorrect because FUTA is a federal program, not a state one.
- **Option B** is incorrect because FUTA does not provide financial assistance for temporary layoffs.
- **Option C** is incorrect because FUTA benefits are not awarded based on cause of termination.
- **Option D** is correct as it accurately describes the eligibility of employees fired for cause.
- **Option E** is incorrect because FUTA assists with temporary unemployment, not permanent.
- **Option F** is incorrect because FUTA does not mandate health insurance for unemployed employees.
- **Option G** is incorrect because the federal system is funded by both employer and employee taxes.
- **Option H** is incorrect because FUTA is funded by both employer and employee taxes, not solely by employee taxes.
- **Option I** is incorrect because FUTA does not cover self-employed individuals.
- **Option J** is incorrect because the federal Labor Relations Authority enforces labor laws, not the FUTA system.

Thus, the correct answer is D.
