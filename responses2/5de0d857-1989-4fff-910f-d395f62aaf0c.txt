Question:

Berscheid’s (1983) emotion-in-relationship model proposes that strong positive emotions are LESS likely to be elicited during the later stages of an intimate relationship than in its initial stages because:

Options:

A: over time, partners become more emotionally distant due to familiarity.
B: "over time, people become ""emotionally immune"" to the behaviors of others."
C: in the later stages, each partner's behavior becomes more erratic and unpredictable.
D: in the later stages, each partner works harder to be sensitive to the other’s needs.
E: in the later stages, each person is more self-centered and less other-centered.
F: in the later stages, each partner's behavior has become more predictable.
G: over time, partners become more independent and less reliant on each other for emotional support.
H: in the later stages, each partner is more focused on their own emotional needs.
I: in the later stages, each partner has less emotional investment in the relationship.

Okay, so I have this question about Berscheid's (1983) emotion-in-relationship model. I remember this model relates to how emotions develop during a relationship and how certain types of emotions are more or less likely over time. 

The question is asking why strong positive emotions are less likely to be emitted later in the relationship than initially. The options are A to I, each describing a different aspect of how relationships develop emotionally.

Hmm, I think I should recall what I know about Berscheid's work. His model suggests that positive emotions peak early and then decline. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite? Or perhaps it's about how people's emotional states change over time.

Another thought: in the 1980s, I remember reading something about how people's emotions become more predictable over time. Like, maybe they become more dependent, or maybe they focus more on their own needs. So, perhaps in the later stages, each partner is more focused on their own needs, which might reduce the need to feel others' emotions as much.

Wait, the question is about why strong positive emotions are LESS likely in later stages. So if positive emotions peak early and then decline, that's probably what the model is suggesting. So which option aligns with that?

Looking at the options: 

Option A says over time, partners become more emotionally distant due to familiarity. That sounds like a positive emotion decline, but I'm not sure if it's about emotional distance or about how they respond to each other.

Option B: people become emotionally immune. I'm not sure what that means. It's possible, but I don't think that's the main point.

Option C: later stages each partner's behavior becomes more erratic and unpredictable. Hmm, that's about behavior, not emotions. So it relates to how they act, but the question is about emotions.

Option D: each partner works harder to be sensitive to each other's needs. So maybe in later stages, they try to be more involved, but I'm not sure how that affects positive emotions.

Option E: later stages each are more self-centered and less other-centered. Oh, self-centered and less other means that they focus on their own needs more. So perhaps they don't need others to support them, which reduces their emotional attachment.

Option F: later stages each have more predictable behavior. So their behavior is more regular, which might mean their emotions are more controlled.

Option G: partners become more independent and less reliant on each other. So independent might mean they don't depend on others for emotional support, reducing the need for others' influence.

Option H: partners focus more on their own needs. So each is more concerned with their own emotions, which might reduce the need to express them to others.

Option I: partners have less emotional investment. So they don't put as much effort into the relationship because they focus on their own needs.

Wait, the model—Berscheid's model—probably says that positive emotions peak early and then decline because people become more dependent on their own needs. So when they become more self-centered, they might not need others' support, so they don't express positive emotions as much. That makes option I sound right. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, option E is about being more self-centered and less other-centered. That also makes sense because if they're less dependent on others, they won't need to show positive emotions.

Wait, which option is correct? Let me think about the model. Berscheid's model suggests that positive emotions peak early and then decline as the relationship evolves. The model also states that positive emotions peak early and then decline because people become more dependent on their own needs. So, in later stages, each partner is more focused on their own emotional needs, which reduces the need to express positive emotions to others. So that would mean option I or option E.

Wait, option E says: in later stages, each person is more self-centered and less other-centered. So being more self-centered means they don't rely on others for support, which would reduce the need to express positive emotions. Because when you're self-centered, you don't need others to provide emotional support, so you don't need to show positive emotions as often.

But option I says each partner has less emotional investment. Less investment could also mean they don't put as much effort into the relationship because they are focused on their own needs. So both I and E could be correct in that sense.

Alternatively, maybe the model is about the partners' emotional states. So by being more self-centered, their emotional states become more controlled and less likely to be expressed. So the answer might be E.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Another angle: the model. I think one of the key points is that positive emotions peak early and then decline because people become more dependent on their own needs. So in the later stages, each partner is more focused on their own emotions and less on others'. So each partner is less emotionally invested, which would fit option I. Or maybe less other-centered, which is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the model says that positive emotions are more likely to be expressed early on because they are needed. As the relationship evolves, they become less expressed. So the later stages are more self-centered, which would make E correct.

I think I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about what each option implies.

Option E: later stages, partners are more self-centered. So they focus more on their own needs than on others. If that's the case, then they won't need others to help them with positive emotions. So perhaps they don't express positive emotions as much.

Option I: less emotional investment. So they don't invest as much emotionally in the relationship.

Both are related. But which one is the correct answer according to the model.

Wait, I think I've read that Berscheid's model suggests that positive emotions peak early and then decline because people become more reliant on their own needs. So in later stages, each partner is more focused on their own needs. So in that case, the model is about being more self-centered, which is option E.

So option E would be the correct answer.

The correct answer is **E: in the later stages, each person is more self-centered and less other-centered.**

Berscheid’s (1983) emotion-in-relationship model suggests that positive emotions peak early and then decline as the relationship evolves. The model posits that this decline occurs because individuals become more dependent on their own needs, leading to a reduction in expressing positive emotions to others. This self-centered behavior aligns with the idea that in later stages, partners are more focused on their own emotional needs (option E), which minimizes the need to express positive emotions.
