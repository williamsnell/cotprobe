Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully. Alright, a negative point charge of 10^-6 coulomb is at the origin. Then there's another negative charge, 10^-4 coulomb, on the positive x-axis, 50 cm away. I need to find the force on the second charge. The options are A to J.

Hmm, I remember Coulomb's Law is involved here. Coulomb's Law says that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r², where k is Coulomb's constant, which is about 8.988 × 10^9 N·m²/C².

Wait, but wait. Oh, right, the charges are both negative. So when they are multiplied, the product is positive. But wait, wait, Coulomb's Law gives the magnitude of the force. The direction depends on the signs: opposite charges attract, same charges repel. Since both are negative, they'll attract each other. So the force on the second charge will be in the direction towards the first charge, which is along the positive x-axis. Oh wait no, wait. The first charge is at the origin, and the second is at +50 cm. So the first is negative, the second is also negative. So they should attract each other. So the force on the second charge (which is negative) will be towards the first charge (which is also negative). So the force would be towards the origin, which is along the negative x-axis. Wait, but wait, the second charge is on the positive x-axis. So if the first is at the origin, and the second is at +50 cm, the second charge will be attracted towards the origin. So the force on the second charge is towards the first charge, which is in the negative x-direction. But wait, the multiple choice options all have positive forces. So perhaps I should look again.

Wait, no, the force magnitude is what matters here, and the direction is determined by the signs. So the force on the second charge will be in the direction towards the first charge. So the force is towards the origin, which for the second charge located at positive x, would mean the force is in the negative x direction, so the direction is towards the first charge. But the options are all in terms of magnitudes, so let's calculate the magnitude first.

Let me compute the magnitude. So q1 is 1e-6 C, q2 is 1e-4 C. r is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters.

So F = k * |q1 * q2| / r².

Plugging in the numbers: k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Wait, let me compute the numerator: 8.988e9 * (1e-6) * (1e-4) = 8.988e9 * 1e-10 = 8.988e-1. That's 0.8988.

Denominator: (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

So F = 0.8988 / 0.25 = 3.595 N. Approximately 3.6 N. So the magnitude is about 3.6 N. But wait, what about the direction? Since both are negative charges, they attract. So the force on the second charge is towards the first charge, which is in the negative x-direction. But the options are all magnitudes. So the correct answer would be the magnitude, which is 3.6 N.

Looking at the options, option A is 3.6 N. So that should be the correct answer.

To determine the force on the second charge, we use Coulomb's Law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2}
\]

where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q_1 = 10^{-6} \, \text{C} \), \( q_2 = 10^{-4} \, \text{C} \), and \( r = 0.5 \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
F = \frac{8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot (10^{-6} \cdot 10^{-4})}{0.5^2}
\]

\[
F = \frac{8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 10^{-10}}{0.25}
\]

\[
F = \frac{0.8988}{0.25}
\]

\[
F \approx 3.595 \, \text{N}
\]

Rounding to two significant figures, the magnitude of the force is approximately \( 3.6 \, \text{N} \). Since both charges are negative, they attract each other, so the force on the second charge is directed towards the first charge, along the negative x-axis. However, the question asks for the magnitude of the force, so the answer is \( 3.6 \, \text{N} \).

From the options provided, the correct choice is:
