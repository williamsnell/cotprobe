Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a proton moving in a magnetic field. Alright, I remember that when a charged particle moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field direction. That's the Lorentz force, right?

The problem says the proton enters with an initial speed of 1.5e6 m/s. Wait, that's a pretty high speed. But I think the velocity here is the initial speed, before entering the magnetic field. Then, it says the proton's velocity vector makes a 30-degree angle with the direction of the magnetic field. Oh, so the initial velocity has a component perpendicular to B.

The magnetic field B is 1.0 T, which is pretty strong, but I guess that's okay. So the proton is moving in a circular path because the magnetic force acts as a centripetal force. Wait, but wait, the speed isn't constant because the magnetic force depends on the velocity's perpendicular component. Oh, right, so the speed will change if the perpendicular component changes. But wait, in this case, is the perpendicular component changing over time?

Wait, no. Because in the problem, the proton is moving with an initial velocity vector that's at 30 degrees to B. So the perpendicular component of the velocity is v0 * sin(theta), where theta is 30 degrees. Let me compute that. 1.5e6 m/s * sin(30°) = 1.5e6 * 0.5 = 0.75e6 m/s. So the perpendicular component is 750,000 m/s.

But wait, when a charged particle moves in a magnetic field, the magnetic force is F = q(v × B). The direction of this force is perpendicular to both v and B. So that means the force is always perpendicular to the velocity's direction, causing the velocity to change direction but keeping the same speed if there was no other force. But wait, wait, no, because the speed is the magnitude of velocity. So in this case, the speed doesn't change because the magnetic force doesn't do any work. Because the force is always perpendicular to the velocity, so the work done would be zero. So the speed remains constant? That's what I remember from the right-hand rule and the Lorentz force.

Wait, but wait, is the speed really constant? Because the magnetic force is causing the proton to change direction. So the speed remains the same, but the direction of motion changes. So the speed after any time t would be the same as the initial speed, as long as the magnetic field is constant and the angle remains the same.

Wait, but isn't the magnetic force causing the proton to move in a circular path? So the speed is the same, but the direction changes. So the speed of the proton doesn't change. So in 4 seconds, the speed is still 1.5e6 m/s.

Wait, but let me think again. The magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity. So the magnitude of the force is F = qvB, because the velocity has a component perpendicular to B. So F is perpendicular to v, so the work done by the magnetic force is zero because the force doesn't have any component along the direction of velocity. Hence, the kinetic energy remains the same, so the speed doesn't change. So the speed after 4 seconds is the same as the initial speed.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial speed is 1.5e6 m/s. The options include 1.5e6 m/s as option A. So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, let me double-check. The question is about the speed after 4 seconds. If the speed doesn't change, then option A is correct. Because it's a constant speed in the direction of the perpendicular component, but the speed itself remains the same.

So the answer is A.

The problem involves a proton entering a region of a constant magnetic field, where the initial velocity vector makes a 30° angle with the magnetic field direction. The goal is to determine the proton's speed 4 seconds after entering the magnetic field.

Key points to consider:
1. The proton experiences a magnetic force given by \( \vec{F} = q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) \), which is always perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field.
2. Since the magnetic force does no work (as it is perpendicular to the direction of motion), the kinetic energy of the proton remains constant.
3. As a result, the speed of the proton remains unchanged throughout its motion in the magnetic field.
4. The initial speed of the proton is given as \( 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \), and since the speed is constant, it remains \( 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \) after 4 seconds.

Thus, the correct answer is the option corresponding to \( 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \), which is option A.
