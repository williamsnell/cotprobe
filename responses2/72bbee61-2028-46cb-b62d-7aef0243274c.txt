Alright, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step.

The question says a filling machine puts an average of four ounces of coffee into jars, with a standard deviation of 0.25 ounces. Then, they take forty jars at random and ask for the probability that the mean amount per jar in the sample is less than 3.9 ounces. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, okay. So, I think this is a problem about the sampling distribution of the sample mean. Because we're dealing with the mean of a sample taken from a population, and we're asked about probabilities involving that mean.

First, I remember that when dealing with sample means, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) usually comes into play. The CLT says that the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal, especially if the sample size is large enough. Here, the sample size is 40, which is definitely large enough for the CLT to apply. So, we can assume the distribution is normal.

Let me jot down the important parameters:

- Population mean (μ) = 4 ounces
- Population standard deviation (σ) = 0.25 ounces
- Sample size (n) = 40
- We need the probability that the sample mean (X̄) is less than 3.9 ounces.

So, the first thing I think is that we'll need to calculate the standard error of the mean. The formula for the standard error (σ_X̄) is σ divided by the square root of n. That's because as the sample size increases, the standard error decreases, meaning the sample mean becomes a better estimate of the population mean.

Let me calculate that:

σ_X̄ = σ / sqrt(n) = 0.25 / sqrt(40)

Hmm, what's sqrt(40) approximately? Well, sqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(40) is about 6.3245. So,

0.25 / 6.3245 ≈ 0.0395 ounces. Let me keep that as approximately 0.0395.

Now, next step is to find the z-score for the sample mean of 3.9 ounces. The z-score tells us how many standard errors away the sample mean is from the population mean.

The formula for the z-score is:

z = (X̄ - μ) / σ_X̄

Plugging in the numbers:

z = (3.9 - 4) / 0.0395
z = (-0.1) / 0.0395 ≈ -2.5316

So, the z-score is approximately -2.53. That means 3.9 ounces is about 2.53 standard errors below the population mean.

Now, the question is asking for the probability that the sample mean is less than 3.9 ounces. In terms of the standard normal distribution, that's the area to the left of z = -2.53.

I need to find the area under the standard normal curve to the left of z = -2.53. I'm not exactly sure what this value is without a z-table or a calculator, but I remember that for z = -2.53, the probability is roughly 0.0057. Wait, because for z = -2.53, the area is about 0.0057. Alternatively, I've heard of using standard normal tables or a calculator for precise values, but in exams, sometimes you can remember some common z-values.

Wait, let me think: The standard normal distribution table gives the area to the left of a given z-score. For z = -2.53, I think the area is about 0.0057. Let me confirm this quickly.

Another approach: The z-score of -2.53 is two and a half standard deviations below the mean. Looking at a standard normal table, for z = -2.50, the area is about 0.0062. For z = -2.53, it's a bit less because the tails are getting smaller. So, maybe around 0.0057.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.0057. So, that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, another thing: The options given include 0.0057 as option F, but also 0.001 (option H) and 0.0025 (option J). Did I calculate the z-score correctly?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Let's recalculate the z-score.

μ = 4, X̄ = 3.9, so (3.9 - 4) = -0.1. σ_X̄ = 0.25 / sqrt(40). Let's compute sqrt(40) more accurately. 6.32456, so 0.25 / 6.32456 ≈ 0.039528.

So, z = (-0.1) / 0.039528 ≈ -2.5316. So, yes, about -2.53. So, the z is correct.

Now, looking up z = -2.53, the cumulative probability is the area from left (negative infinity) up to z.

Looking at a z-table:

For z = 2.53, the area is 0.9943 (to the left). But since it's -2.53, the area is 1 - 0.9943 = 0.0057. Yes, that's correct. So the probability is approximately 0.0057.

So the probability that the mean is less than 3.9 ounces is 0.0057, which is option F.

The problem involves finding the probability that the mean amount per jar in a sample of 40 jars is less than 3.9 ounces. Using the Central Limit Theorem, we calculate the standard error of the mean and determine the z-score for the sample mean. The z-score is found to be approximately -2.53, and the corresponding probability (area to the left of z = -2.53) is approximately 0.0057.

Answer: F: 0.0057
