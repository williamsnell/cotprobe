Okay, so I've got this question about Hamming codes and parity bits. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating the number of parity bits required to encode information bits into a Hamming code. There are two cases: part a) with 8 bits of input information, and part b) with 4 bits of input information. The options are A through J, each giving a possible combination of a) and b) answers.

First, I need to remember how Hamming codes work. Hamming codes are used for error detection and correction. The number of parity bits (k) depends on the number of data bits (n). The formula to find the minimum number of parity bits required is something like 2^k ≥ n + k + 1. Or wait, maybe it's a bit different. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the formula is used to determine the number of parity bits needed for a certain number of data bits. Let me try to recall. Oh right, to find the minimum number of parity bits k that can cover n data bits, the formula is 2^k ≥ n + k + 1. Because each parity bit can cover certain data bits, and they need to cover all of them without overlap.

So for example, if n is 8, let's see what k would be. I'll try each k starting from 1 and see when the inequality holds.

Case a) n=8.

k=1: 2^1=2. The right side is 8+1+1=10. 2 < 10 → no.
k=2: 4. 8+2+1=11. 4 <11 → no.
k=3:8. 8+3+1=12. 8<12 → no.
k=4:16. 8+4+1=13. 16>13 → yes. So k=4? Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the formula is 2^k >= n + k + 1. For n=8, 2^k >= 8 + k + 1 → 2^k >= k+9.

Wait, let me recheck. So for each k, check if 2^k is at least n + k + 1.

n is 8.

k=4: 2^4=16. 8+4+1=13. 16>13 → yes. So k=4 parity bits.

Wait, but wait, I thought for n=7, k=3, because 2^3=8≥7+3+1=11? No, 8 is less than 11, so no. So for n=7, k=4: 2^4=16 ≥ 7+4+1=12 → yes. So for 8 bits, k=4. But wait, the options don't have a) as 4, because looking at the answer options, option B says a)4, b)3.

Wait no, the options are:

Looking back, the options are A to J. Let me check each part.

Wait, the question says: a) 8 bits, b)4 bits.

Looking at the options, option B says a)4, b)3.

Wait, but according to the calculation, when n=8, k=4. So part a) is 4.

But part b) is n=4. Let's do that.

Case b) n=4.

Find k where 2^k >=4 +k +1 → 2^k >=k+5.

Check k=1: 2^1=2 >=1+5=6? 2<6 → no.
k=2:4 >=2+5=7? 4<7 → no.
k=3:8 >=3+5=8 → yes. So k=3.

So for n=4, k=3. So part b) is 3.

So the answers are a)4, b)3. Looking at the options, that's option B: a)4, b)3.

Wait, but let me think again. Because sometimes the formula can differ. Another approach: the number of parity bits needed is the smallest k where 2^k >= n +k +1. So that's the correct approach.

Alternatively, another way to calculate is to compute 2^k and see if it's enough. So for n=8.

2^3=8. 8 +3 +1 =12. 8<12 → no. So k can't be 3. So must be 4. So a) is 4.

For n=4:

2^2=4. 4 +2 +1=7. 4<7 → no. So k=3. 2^3=8 >=4+3+1=8 → yes. So yes.

So the options should be B: a)4, b)3.

Looking at the options, option B is a)4, b)3.

Wait, but let me double-check any possible miscalculations.

Wait, another approach—maybe using the Hamming code formula, where you have the total redundancy bits (r) such that 2^(r) ≥ n + r +1. So for n=8:

2^r >= 8 + r +1 → 2^r >= r+9.

r=3: 8 >=3+9=12 → no, 8 <12.

r=4: 16 >=4+9=13 → yes. So r=4.

n=4:

2^r >=4 +r +1 → 2^r >=r+5.

r=3: 8 >=3+5=8 → yes. So r=3.

So the same conclusion as before.

So the correct answers are a)4, b)3. Looking at the options, that's option B.

To determine the number of parity bits required to encode information bits into a Hamming code, we use the formula \(2^k \geq n + k + 1\), where \(n\) is the number of data bits and \(k\) is the number of parity bits.

### Case a) \(n = 8\) bits:
1. **Check \(k = 4\):**
   - \(2^4 = 16\)
   - \(8 + 4 + 1 = 13\)
   - Since \(16 \geq 13\), \(k = 4\) is sufficient.

### Case b) \(n = 4\) bits:
1. **Check \(k = 3\):**
   - \(2^3 = 8\)
   - \(4 + 3 + 1 = 8\)
   - Since \(8 \geq 8\), \(k = 3\) is sufficient.

### Conclusion:
- For \(n = 8\), \(k = 4\).
- For \(n = 4\), \(k = 3\).

Thus, the correct answers are:
- a) 4 parity bits
- b) 3 parity bits

This corresponds to option **B**.
