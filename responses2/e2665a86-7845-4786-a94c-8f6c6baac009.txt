Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin precession. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my spin dynamics, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says that spins with an offset frequency Ω = 250 rad/s precess through an angle of 60 degrees. I need to find the delay time. Wait, what exactly is the relationship between the precession angle, frequency, and time? Oh right, I remember something about rotational motion, like the angular displacement.

The formula I think is θ = Ω * t. So, θ is the angle in radians, Ω is the angular frequency, and t is time. Oh wait, but the angle given is 60 degrees. Oh right, I need to convert that to radians. So 60 degrees is pi/3 radians because 60 degrees is one-sixth of a full circle, which is 2pi radians. So 2pi/6 is pi/3.

So, θ = pi/3 radians. Ω is 250 rad/s. So t = θ / Ω. Let me plug in the numbers: t = (pi/3) / 250. Let me calculate that.

Pi is approximately 3.1416, so pi/3 is about 1.0472 radians. Dividing that by 250 gives 1.0472 / 250. Let me compute that. 1.0472 divided by 250. Well, 250 is 250, so 1.0472 / 250 is 0.0041888 seconds.

Wait, wait a minute, that's 0.0041888 seconds. That's 4.1888 milliseconds. Because 1 second is 1000 ms. So, 0.0041888 * 1000 = 4.1888 ms. Let me round that to maybe 4.19 ms. Looking at the options, option E is 4.19 ms. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes in spin precession, the formula might involve the time for a full rotation. Like, for a spin to complete a 360-degree (2pi radian) precession, the time would be (2pi)/Ω. But the question here is about 60 degrees. So the time for 60 degrees should be (60°/360°) * (2pi/Ω) = (pi/3)/Ω. Which is what I calculated earlier. So that's correct.

So, the time is approximately 4.19 milliseconds, which is option E.

To determine the delay time for the spins to precess through an angle of 60° with an offset frequency of 250 rad/s, we use the relationship between angular displacement, frequency, and time: 

\[
\theta = \Omega \cdot t
\]

Here, the angle \( \theta \) is given in degrees, so we first convert 60° to radians:
\[
\theta = 60^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} = \frac{\pi}{3} \, \text{radians}
\]

Rearranging the formula to solve for time \( t \):
\[
t = \frac{\theta}{\Omega} = \frac{\pi/3}{250} \, \text{seconds}
\]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \), we calculate:
\[
t = \frac{1.0472}{250} \approx 0.0041888 \, \text{seconds}
\]

Converting to milliseconds:
\[
t \approx 4.1888 \, \text{milliseconds}
\]

Rounding to three significant figures, \( t \approx 4.19 \, \text{ms} \). Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**E: 4.19 ms**
