Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about voting behavior in the United States. I need to figure out which statement doesn't accurately describe it. Let's go through each option step by step.

The question asks which statement is incorrect. Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Registered voters between 35-45 are more likely to vote than those under 21. I remember that in the U.S., the majority of registered voters are between 21 and 30. But wait, from what I've read, younger voters (under 21) are more likely to vote in certain elections, especially primary ones, because they might be more motivated or have more personal experience. So, maybe option A is accurate. However, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes older voters are more likely to vote in general elections. But I think the statement says between 35 and 45 are more likely than under 21, which would be correct if the majority are older. So A might be correct.

Option B: A GED registered voter is less likely to vote than a high school dropout. Wait, I think high school dropouts are less likely to vote. They haven't had the chance to gain political experience. GED people, especially those with a degree, are more likely to vote because they have previous experience. So this statement sounds correct. So B is accurate.

Option C: Registered voters are more likely to vote in general elections than primary. Wait, in the U.S., primary elections are smaller and happen before the general election. So, the general election is the bigger one where more people vote, including both primary and regular elections. So, registered voters are more likely to vote in general elections. So option C is correct.

Option D: More women than men have voted in every presidential election since 1980. Hmm, I'm not so sure about this. Let me think. From 1980 onwards, female presidential voters have been increasing. But wait, the statement says "more than in every election," which is a strong statement. I remember hearing that in the 2000s, women got more, but the majority were men. Also, in the 2012 election, women made up about 48% of the vote. Since then, it's been increasing, but not every election had women leading. For example, in 1996, men won. So the statement D says more women than men in every election since 1980. That can't be true because in some elections, men were leading. So D is inaccurate.

Wait, let me double-check. For example, in the 1980 election, women were about 33%. In 1996, men won. So before 2001, women didn't take the lead consistently. So option D is incorrect because it's not true that women have been more in every presidential election since 1980. So the correct answer would be D as the incorrect statement.

The question asks which statement does NOT accurately describe voting behavior in the United States. Here's the breakdown:

- **Option A**: Correct. Registered voters aged 35-45 are more likely to vote than those under 21, as older voters are often more motivated or have more personal experience.
  
- **Option B**: Correct. High school dropouts are less likely to vote compared to those with a GED, as they lack political experience.
  
- **Option C**: Correct. Registered voters are more likely to vote in general elections than primary elections, as the general election is the larger and more prominent event.
  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The statement claims that women have more votes than men in every presidential election since 1980, which is not true. For example, in 1996, men won the presidential election despite women having a smaller share of the vote.

The correct answer is **D**, as it inaccurately states that women have consistently led in every presidential election since 1980.

Answer: D
