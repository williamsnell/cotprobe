Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the average concentration of OH⁻ ions in the solution after some electrolysis. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says that 1000 seconds of a current of 0.0965 A is passed through 50 ml of 0.1 M NaCl. The cathode is where the H₂O gets reduced, and the anode is where Cl⁻ is oxidized to Cl₂. I need to find the OH⁻ concentration in the final solution.

First, I remember that in electrolysis, the amount of substance deposited depends on the current, time, and the number of electrons involved. So I'll probably need to calculate the moles of H₂ and Cl₂ produced.

Wait, but wait. The solution is NaCl, which is a solution of Na+ and Cl⁻ ions. But when NaCl is electrolyzed, the Cl⁻ ions are oxidized, and the H₂O is reduced. Oh, right, because Cl⁻ has a higher charge than H₂O. So the anode reaction is Cl⁻ → Cl₂ + electrons, and the cathode is H₂O + 2e⁻ → H₂ + 2OH⁻.

But wait, the solution is 50 ml of 0.1 M NaCl. So initial concentrations: when NaCl is dissolved, it dissociates into Na+ and Cl⁻. The concentration of Cl⁻ is 0.1 M, right? But wait, no. Wait, 50 ml of 0.1 M NaCl is 0.05 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.005 mol of NaCl. Since NaCl dissociates completely, we have 0.005 mol of Cl⁻ ions. So initially, [Cl⁻] is 0.1 M.

Now, when the electrolysis starts, some Cl⁻ will be oxidized to Cl₂, and water will be reduced to H₂ and OH⁻.

Let me outline the reactions:

At cathode (reduction): H₂O + 2e⁻ → H₂ + 2OH⁻. So each H₂O molecule gains 2 electrons to form H₂ and OH⁻.

At anode (oxidation): 2Cl⁻ → Cl₂ + 2e⁻. So each Cl⁻ ion loses 1 electron to form Cl₂.

The current is the rate of charge flow, which is I = Q/t. So the total charge Q is I * t.

So Q = 0.0965 A * 1000 s = 96.5 C.

Each mole of electrons contributes to this. So the number of moles of electrons is Q/(e⁻), where e⁻ is Avogadro's number, but since e⁻ = 96485 C/mol, approximately 96500 C/mol.

So n = 96.5 C / 96500 C/mol ≈ 0.001 mol. Wait, that's 1 millimole of electrons? That seems low, but okay, let me proceed.

Wait, but each electron contributes to the electrons available for the reactions. So the number of moles of electrons is n = I * t / F, where F is Faraday's constant (approx 96,500 C/mol). So n = 0.0965 * 1000 / 96500 = (96.5) / 96500 = 0.001 mol of e⁻.

Wait, 96500 C per mol e⁻, so 96.5 C is 96.5 / 96500 ≈ 0.001 mol e⁻. Yeah, 1 mmol of electrons.

Now, the moles of electrons will determine how much Cl⁻ is oxidized and how much H₂ is produced.

Each Cl⁻ gives one electron, so at anode, moles of Cl⁻ oxidized is equal to the moles of electrons.

So moles of Cl⁻ oxidized = n_electrons = 0.001 mol.

Wait, but wait: from the anode reaction, each mole of Cl⁻ gives 1 mole of e⁻. So if n_electrons is 0.001 mol, then moles of Cl⁻ oxidized is 0.001 mol. So moles of Cl₂ produced would be half that, because each Cl₂ molecule comes from 2 Cl⁻.

Wait, no. Each Cl₂ molecule requires 2 electrons. So if n_electrons is 0.001 mol, each Cl₂ requires 2 mol e⁻. So moles of Cl₂ = n_electrons / 2 = 0.001 / 2 = 0.0005 mol.

So moles of Cl₂ produced: 0.0005 mol. So that's 0.5 mmol of Cl₂.

At the cathode, each mole of H₂O produces 1 mole of H₂ and 2 mol OH⁻. So the number of moles of H₂ is n_electrons / 2 (since each H₂ needs 2 e⁻). So n_H2 = 0.001 / 2 = 0.0005 mol.

Thus, the moles of H₂ produced is 0.0005 mol. So the moles of H₂ in the solution is 0.0005 mol.

So the initial solution had 0.005 mol Cl⁻ in 0.05 L, which is 0.1 M.

After oxidation, we have 0.005 - 0.0005 = 0.0045 mol Cl⁻ left.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. No, the initial moles of Cl⁻ is 0.005 mol. Each Cl⁻ gives 1 e⁻. At anode, 0.001 mol e⁻ are used, so 0.001 mol Cl⁻ are oxidized to Cl₂. So remaining Cl⁻ is 0.005 - 0.001 = 0.004 mol.

Wait no, wait. Because each Cl⁻ contributes 1 e⁻, so:

At anode, moles e⁻ used = moles Cl⁻ oxidized = 0.001 mol.

So 0.001 mol Cl⁻ are consumed, so remaining Cl⁻ is 0.005 - 0.001 = 0.004 mol.

Wait, no, no. Because Cl⁻ is the oxidizing agent, so each Cl⁻ gives 1 electron. So for each mole of Cl⁻ oxidized, 1 mole of e⁻ is consumed. So yes, 0.001 mol Cl⁻ is lost.

So Cl⁻ remaining: 0.005 - 0.001 = 0.004 mol.

The total Cl⁻ now is 0.004 mol.

Now, the Cl⁻ is in solution, but we also have H₂O reduced. Let's think about the H₂O.

Each H₂O molecule gives 2 e⁻, so each produces 1 mole of H₂. So moles of H₂ produced is 0.001 / 2 = 0.0005 mol.

So, total moles of H₂ in solution is 0.0005 mol.

So the solution now has:

- Cl⁻: 0.004 mol
- H₂: 0.0005 mol
- H₂O: 0.005 mol (since 50ml, 0.05L, and no precipitation, so all H2O is used? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the total initial H2O is 0.05 L × 1 M = 0.05 mol? Because the concentration is 1 M, assuming it's 1 M NaCl, which dissociates into Na+ and Cl⁻. So initial solution is 0.05 mol H2O.

Wait, but wait, the solution is 50ml of 0.1 M NaCl. So initial moles of NaCl: 0.1 M * 0.05 L = 0.005 mol. Since each NaCl gives one Cl⁻ and one Na+.

So the initial moles of H2O is 0.05 mol. But during electrolysis, some H2O is consumed, and some Cl⁻ is oxidized.

So after the reaction, moles of H2O: 0.05 - 0.001 = 0.049 mol? No, wait, no. Because only 0.001 mol of e⁻ are consumed, which comes from 0.001 mol Cl⁻, but you also have H2O being reduced, which requires 0.001 mol e⁻. So 0.001 mol H2O is reduced. So the moles of H2O reduced is 0.001 mol.

Wait, but in reality, the amount of H2O reduced is the same as the amount of Cl⁻ oxidized, since each Cl⁻ gives one e⁻, and each H2O needs two e⁻.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of electrons.

Total electrons used: 0.001 mol (from Cl⁻ oxidation).

Each H2O reaction uses 2e⁻ → so the moles of H2O reduced is 0.001 / 2 = 0.0005 mol.

So moles of H2O reduced is 0.0005 mol.

So the initial moles of H2O: 0.05. Now, 0.0005 mol are used, so remaining H2O is 0.05 - 0.0005 = 0.0495 mol.

Wait, but that's a lot, but perhaps we can consider it as approximately 0.05 mol for a rough calculation, but maybe the dilution is important.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentrations after the reactions.

Wait, the solution is 50 ml. So after the reactions, how much H2 and Cl⁻ and OH⁻ are present?

Wait, the total solution volume is 50 ml, but considering that some H₂ and Cl⁻ may have been generated, but not sure. Because in electrolysis, water is split into H₂ and OH⁻, but in this case, the NaCl solution is being electrolyzed, so the solution is probably diluted, but the volume is 50 ml.

Wait, but the initial solution is 50 ml, but after the reactions, the volume is probably not changing much, but it's 50 ml. So let's proceed.

So initial moles:

Cl⁻: 0.005 mol (since 0.05 L * 0.1 M = 0.005 mol)

H₂O: 0.05 mol (since 50 ml of 1 M NaCl → 0.05 mol)

But during the reaction:

- Cl⁻ is oxidized: 0.001 mol → so Cl⁻ remaining: 0.005-0.001=0.004 mol.

- H₂O is reduced: 0.0005 mol → so H₂O remaining: 0.05 - 0.0005=0.0495 mol.

But wait, it's possible that some H₂O is consumed, but the exact amount depends on the reaction.

Wait, the Cl⁻ oxidation reaction is 2Cl⁻ → Cl₂ + 2e⁻.

Each Cl⁻ gives 1 e⁻, so 0.001 mol Cl⁻ gives 0.001 mol e⁻.

The H₂O reduction reaction is H₂O + 2e⁻ → H₂ + 2OH⁻.

Each H₂O requires 2 e⁻. So 0.001 mol e⁻ comes from 0.0005 mol H₂O.

So total H₂O consumed: 0.0005 mol.

So now, the solution has:

Cl⁻: 0.004 mol

H₂O: 0.05 mol - 0.0005 mol = 0.0495 mol.

H₂: 0.0005 mol.

Cl⁻ is now 0.004 mol, H₂O is 0.0495 mol, H₂ is 0.0005 mol.

Wait, but wait, the solution is 50 ml. So the concentrations would be:

[Cl⁻] = 0.004 mol / 0.05 L = 0.08 M

[H₂O] = 0.0495 / 0.05 = 0.99 M

[H₂] = 0.0005 / 0.05 = 0.01 M

But wait, H₂O is 0.0495 mol in 0.05 L, which is 0.99 M. That's a high concentration, but possible.

But I'm supposed to find OH⁻ concentration. So from the H₂O reduction, each H₂O gives two OH⁻ ions. So the moles of OH⁻ produced is 0.0005 mol.

So [OH⁻] = 0.0005 mol / 0.05 L = 0.01 M.

Wait, that's option C.

But wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me think again. The H₂O is consumed, and for each H₂O, 2 OH⁻ are produced. So if 0.0005 mol H₂O is consumed, then 0.001 mol OH⁻ is produced.

So moles of OH⁻: 0.001 mol.

Concentration: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Wait, wait, this contradicts my earlier calculation.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Each mole of H₂O gives 2 OH⁻. So the number of moles of OH⁻ is 2 * moles of H₂O.

Wait, the moles of H₂O reduced is 0.0005 mol. So OH⁻ moles = 0.0005 * 2 = 0.001 mol.

Concentration: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So the OH⁻ concentration is 0.02 M.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.02 M.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscalculate.

Wait, initial moles of Cl⁻: 0.05 L × 0.1 M = 0.005 mol.

Used in oxidation: 0.001 mol → Cl⁻ remaining: 0.004 mol.

H₂O used: 0.0005 mol → so OH⁻ produced: 0.0005 × 2 = 0.001 mol.

So OH⁻ concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So option B.

Wait, but wait, the initial moles of H2O were 0.05 mol. 0.0005 mol were used, so remaining is 0.0495 mol.

But doesn't that affect the solution volume? But the question says "the final solution". Assuming the volume remains roughly same, about 50 ml.

So yes, the OH⁻ concentration is 0.02 M.
</think>

To determine the average concentration of OH⁻ in the final solution, we analyze the electrolysis of 50 mL of 0.1 M NaCl solution, where a current of 0.0965 A is passed for 1000 s. The cathode and anode reactions are:

- **Cathode (reduction):** H₂O + 2e⁻ → H₂ + 2OH⁻  
- **Anode (oxidation):** 2Cl⁻ → Cl₂ + 2e⁻  

### Key Steps:
1. **Calculate total charge (Q):**  
   \( Q = I \times t = 0.0965 \, \text{A} \times 1000 \, \text{s} = 96.5 \, \text{C} \).

2. **Determine moles of electrons (n):**  
   Using \( n = \frac{Q}{F} \), where \( F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \):  
   \( n = \frac{96.5}{96485} \approx 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Relate electrons to moles of Cl⁻ oxidized:**  
   Each Cl⁻ ion provides 1 electron for oxidation. Thus, moles of Cl⁻ oxidized = 0.001 mol.

4. **Calculate moles of Cl₂ produced:**  
   Each Cl₂ molecule requires 2 electrons, so moles of Cl₂ = \( \frac{0.001}{2} = 0.0005 \, \text{mol} \).

5. **Determine moles of OH⁻ produced:**  
   Each H₂O molecule reduces to produce 2 OH⁻ ions. Moles of H₂O reduced = 0.0005 mol (same as moles of Cl⁻ oxidized). Thus, moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.0005 \times 2 = 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).

6. **Calculate concentration of OH⁻:**  
   The solution volume is 50 mL = 0.05 L.  
   \( [\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{volume of solution}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M} \).

### Final Answer:
The average concentration of OH⁻ in the final solution is **0.02 M**.
