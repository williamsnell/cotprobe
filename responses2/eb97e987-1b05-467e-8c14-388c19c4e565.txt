Question:

A grocery store purchased a large mirror to hang on a wall in the store. Along with the mirror itself, the manufacturer provided brackets and bolts to be used for hanging the mirror. The grocery store paid a local carpenter to come in and hang the mirror. A few days after the carpenter installed the mirror, the mirror suddenly fell from the wall because of a defect in the brackets. It struck a shopper on the head, causing serious injuries to him. If the shopper asserts a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort, the plaintiff will

Options:

A: prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.
B: prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.
C: not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.
D: not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.

Okay, so I'm faced with this tort question about strict liability. Hmm, I remember that strict liability is a concept in tort law where damages are not recoverable unless the defect was specifically created by the defendant. So, if the plaintiff's claim is based on strict liability, they can't claim damages just because the defect was present when the injury happened. Because strict liability doesn't hold for defects caused by another person's actions.

The scenario is that a grocery store bought a mirror and brackets. The carpenter came in to hang it, but the mirror fell and injured a shopper. The question is whether the shopper can claim strict liability against the carpenter.

Wait, strict liability is about whether the defendant's actions directly caused the injury, not whether they were negligent. So the fact that the mirror fell because of the carpenter's mistake doesn't automatically make the carpenter liable. They might have done the right thing, but if the mirror was defective, the issue is whether the defect was created by the defendant.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the brackets were defective when installed, so the carpenter was negligent. But wait, strict liability doesn't depend on the carpenter's negligence; it depends on if the defect was created by the carpenter. If the store provided the brackets, but the defect was in the installation, strict liability would prevent the claim. So A might not be correct if strict liability applies here.

Option B says the mirror was abnormally dangerous, which could be a defense under strict liability. I think strict liability doesn't generally allow such defenses unless it's a specific defense. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Abnormally dangerous is a defense against negligence, not strict liability. So perhaps B is a valid defense, but the question is about strict liability. So if the question is about strict liability, B might not be the answer, unless strict liability doesn't allow abnormally dangerous defenses. Or perhaps strict liability doesn't consider that; it's still a defense against negligence.

Option C says the carpenter wasn't engaged in the sale. Well, the carpenter was engaged in the sale (he was the one who sold the mirror). But strict liability isn't about whether the defendant was engaged in the sale; it's whether the defect was created by them. So C might not be correct because the question is about whether the defect was a result of the defendant's action.

Option D says there's no relationship of private privilege between the carpenter and the plaintiff. Private privilege would prevent the defendant from being liable. But if the carpenter had no private privilege, then strict liability would allow the claim. Or wait, no—strict liability generally requires that the defendant's actions were specifically creating the defect. Because strict liability doesn't require that the defendant was negligent, just that the defect was created by them. So D says no relationship, which would mean strict liability applies, so D would be incorrect. Because if there's no private privilege, the defendant can be held liable.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. If the carpenter was in the process of selling the mirror, but the defect was in the installation, then the question is whether the defect was created by the carpenter. If the carpenter didn't create the defect himself but merely used the mirror, then D's option is correct, because there's no private privilege, so the carpenter can be held liable under strict liability.

Wait, but strictly, the question says that the carpenter was engaged in the sale. So perhaps when the mirror was sold, the carpenter was the seller. But the defect is in the installation of the mirror. So the question is whether the defect was created by the carpenter. If the carpenter didn't create the defect himself (which is the case here), then strict liability doesn't apply. Because strict liability is about the defendant creating the defect. If the defect was present because the seller (carpenter) had a defect in the installation, then strict liability would apply.

Wait, no. Strict liability doesn't require that the plaintiff's injury was caused by the defendant's fault. It's about whether the defendant's actions created the injury. So the key is whether the carpenter's actions (in this case, installing the mirror) created the defect. If the mirror fell because of a defect in the brackets, then perhaps the defect was created by the carpenter. But the question is whether strict liability applies.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me restate: strict liability is a defense that damages are not recoverable if the defendant's actions (the defect) were not created by the defendant. So if the carpenter didn't create the defect himself (i.e., the defect was present because someone else had a defect in the mirror), then strict liability applies.

In the scenario, the mirror was bought by the store owner, and the carpenter used it. If the store owner knew that the mirror was defective, then the defect was created by the store owner, not by the carpenter. So in that case, the carpenter couldn't be held liable under strict liability because the defect was created by the store owner.

Wait, but in the question, did the carpenter have a defect? No, the question states that the mirror was installed, but it fell. So the question is whether the defect in the installation was the one that caused the injury.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about whether the carpenter's actions caused the mirror to fall. The problem states that the mirror fell because of a defect in the brackets. So the defect in the brackets (which were installed by the carpenter) caused the mirror to fall.

So, does the carpenter's action (installing the mirror) create the defect in the brackets? Or is the defect in the brackets created by the store owner? If the store owner provided the brackets, but didn’t have a defect in them, then the defect in the installation (bracket defect) is created by the carpenter.

In this case, the defect in the brackets was installed by the carpenter. So the defect was created by the carpenter. So under strict liability, the claim would prevail because the defect was created by the defendant.

But wait, the options suggest that the correct answer is not A. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: The brackets were defective when installed. So the carpenter was negligent. If strict liability applies, then the claim would not prevail, because strict liability doesn't require the defendant’s negligence. So if A is correct, the claim wouldn't hold. But wait, no—strict liability doesn't require negligence; it just requires the defect was created by the defendant. So if the brackets were defective when installed, that's the defect. But does that mean strict liability applies? Because strict liability is about the defect being created by the defendant. So the question is if the brackets were defective when installed, creating the defect that led to the injury.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The question is, whether the defect was caused by the carpenter. If the store provided the brackets, but if the defect was in the installation (bracket), then the defect was created by the carpenter. So if the carpenter was negligent in installing the mirror (like not fixing the brackets properly), then the claim would prevail. But if the defect was simply in the installation, then strict liability would prevent the claim.

Wait, perhaps the given problem is that the mirror fell because the brackets were defective, meaning the defect was in the installation. So the defect was created by the carpenter. Therefore, the defect was created by the defendant, so strict liability applies, and the claim would not prevail. But I'm getting myself mixed up.

Alternatively, let's think of it this way: the question is about strict liability. The question is whether the plaintiff can claim a strict liability claim against the carpenter. Under strict liability, the court would not award damages unless the defendant's actions directly caused the injury. The defendant's actions must have caused the injury, not the plaintiff's actions.

So the key is whether the carpenter's actions (installing the mirror) caused the mirror to fall. The problem says the mirror fell because of a defect in the brackets. So the defect in the brackets caused the mirror to fall. So the question is whether the carpenter's installation of the mirror caused that defect.

If the store owner provided the brackets but didn't have a defect, then the defect in the brackets was created by the carpenter. So the defect was the defendant's fault. Therefore, strict liability would prevent the claim.

But option A says the brackets were defective when installed, which implies that the defect was created by the carpenter. So the question is, is strict liability applicable. If the defect was created by the carpenter, then the claim wouldn't be strict liability; it's negligence. But wait, the options are about strict liability.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: the brackets were defective when installed. So the defect was created by the carpenter. Therefore, strict liability would prevent the claim. But option A says the brackets were defective when installed, implying that the defect was created by the carpenter. So strict liability would not apply. So the claim would not prevail because it's strict liability.

Alternatively, perhaps the store owner didn't have a defect in the brackets, so the defect was created by the carpenter. So the defect was created by the defendant, so strict liability applies, and the claim doesn't prevail.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A: The brackets were defective when installed. So the defect was created by the carpenter. So strict liability doesn't apply. So the claim doesn't prevail, so the plaintiff would not get a strict liability claim. So the answer would be A? But no, wait.

Wait, the options are about whether the claim would prevail. So, if the claim is based on strict liability, the defendant can't recover unless the defect was created by the defendant.

So, for the claim to prevail, the defect must have been created by the defendant. If the defect was caused by the defendant's actions (like installing the mirror), then strict liability would prevent the claim.

But in the question, the mirror fell because of a defect in the brackets. So the defect was in the brackets, which were installed by the carpenter. So the defect was created by the carpenter. So strict liability would prevent the claim.

Wait, but in that case, the answer would be that strict liability doesn't apply, so the claim doesn't prevail. But looking at the options, option A says the brackets were defective when installed. So if the store owner didn't have a defect, then strict liability would apply. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the problem is about strict liability. If the mirror fell because of a defect in the brackets, which the carpenter installed. So the question is whether the defect was created by the carpenter.

If the store owner provided the brackets but didn't have a defect, then the defect is in the installation. So the defect was created by the carpenter. So strict liability would prevent the claim. But if the store owner had a defect in the brackets, then the defect was created by the store owner, not the carpenter, so strict liability applies, and the claim would prevail.

Wait, but the question is about strict liability. So regardless of the store's defect, if the mirror fell because of a defect in the brackets, which the carpenter installed, then if the carpenter's installation was the cause of the defect, then strict liability applies.

Alternatively, perhaps the defect in the brackets is the one that caused the fall. So, the problem states that the mirror fell because of a defect in the brackets. So the defect was in the installation. So the carpenter was at fault for the defect, making strict liability inapplicable.

But wait, the question is whether the claim is based on strict liability. So if the defects in the brackets were created by the carpenter, then strict liability would prevent the claim.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the options again.

Option A says the brackets were defective when installed. So the defect was created by the carpenter. Therefore, strict liability would prevent the claim. So the answer would be A. But wait, if the brackets were defective, but the problem says the mirror fell because of a defect in the brackets, which the carpenter installed. So the defect in the brackets was created by the carpenter.

Wait, but in reality, if the store didn't have a defect in the brackets, then the defect is in the installation. So the question is whether the defect in the installation was created by the carpenter.

In this case, the problem says the mirrors fell because of the defect in the brackets. So the defect was in the installation. So the carpenter's action created the defect. So strict liability applies, so the claim wouldn't prevail.

Wait, but if the defect was in the brackets, which the store owner provided, but the store owner didn't have a defect in the brackets, then the mirror fell because of the defect in the installation. So the defect was in the installation, not the store's brackets. So the carpenter was at fault for installing the defective mirror. So strict liability would prevent the claim.

But I'm getting myself in circles. Let me look at the options again:

Option A: The brackets were defective when installed. So the defect was created by the carpenter. So the claim would not prevail because strict liability doesn't apply. So answer A.

But wait, the question is about whether the carpenter's actions created the defect. If the store owner had no defect in the brackets, then the defect was in the installation, which was created by the carpenter. So the defect was created by the carpenter, so strict liability would prevent the claim.

So in this case, the answer would be A, which says the brackets were defective when installed. But I thought the answer is that strict liability doesn't apply. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the mirror fell because of the defect in the brackets, which the carpenter installed. So the defect was created by the carpenter, so strict liability applies. So the claim doesn't prevail.

But the options:

The options are about whether the claim would prevail. So if strict liability applies, the claim doesn't prevail. If the defect was created by the defendant, then strict liability allows the claim.

So, let's consider the facts. The carpenter installed the mirror, and it fell because of a defect in the brackets. So the defect was in the brackets, which were installed by the carpenter. So the defect was created by the carpenter. Therefore, strict liability would apply. So the claim would not prevail.

Wait, but strict liability is based on the assumption that the defect was created by the defendant. So if the defect was caused by the carpenter, then strict liability doesn't apply. So the answer would be that the claim does not prevail (answer A).

Alternatively, perhaps the store didn't have a defect in the brackets, so the defect is in the installation. So the defect was created by the carpenter. Therefore, strict liability applies, and the claim doesn't prevail.

So looking at the options, the correct answer may be A.

Wait, but I'm confused because the first statement says the carpenter installed the mirror, which is correct, but the fall was due to the defect in the brackets. So the defect was in the installation.

Wait, no, the problem states that the mirror fell because of a defect in the brackets. So the defect in the brackets (which the carpenter installed) caused the fall. So the defect was created by the carpenter, making strict liability not apply.

Wait, but if the store owner did not have a defect in the brackets, then the defect is in the installation. So the defect was created by the carpenter, meaning strict liability would prevent the claim. So in that case, the answer would be A.

So the answer is A, because the defect was created by the carpenter.

Wait, but the options are about whether the claim would prevail. So if the defense is strict liability, the claim doesn't hold. So the answer is A, because the problem states that the mirror fell because of a defect in the brackets, which the carpenter installed. So the defect was created by the carpenter, making strict liability not apply. So the answer would be that the claim doesn't prevail, which is option A.

Wait, but the options are labeled as A to J. The options are:

A: prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.

B: prevail, because abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror.

C: not prevail, because the carpenter wasn't engaged in the sale.

D: not prevail, because the carpenter had no private privilege.

So, back to the question: the question is whether the claim would prevail under strict liability. If the defect was created by the carpenter, then strict liability would not allow the claim. So A says the brackets were defective when installed. So the defect was created by the carpenter. Thus, strict liability doesn't apply, so the claim doesn't prevail, meaning the answer would be A.

Wait, but the question is whether the first character of the answer is the correct letter. So the correct answer would be A.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Let me think again.

Strict liability is about whether the defendant's actions directly caused the injury. So, if the defect was caused by the carpenter, then strict liability doesn't apply.

In this scenario, the problem says the mirror fell because of a defect in the brackets. So the defect was in the installation, which was done by the carpenter. So the defect was caused by the carpenter, so strict liability doesn't apply.

Thus, the claim wouldn't be able to recover under strict liability. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but the options are about whether the claim is made against the carpenter. If strict liability doesn't apply, then the claim doesn't prevail. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but the answer isn't A. Because the problem states that the mirror fell because of the defect in the brackets, which the carpenter installed. So the defect was created by the carpenter, making strict liability not applicable. Therefore, the claim doesn't prevail.

So the correct answer would be A, but I'm getting myself mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that strict liability does apply, making the answer A.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the store owner did provide the brackets, but didn't have a defect in them. So the defect is in the installation. So the carpenter was responsible for the defect. So strict liability would prevent the claim, so the answer would be A.

Wait, but the options don't include that. Oh, the options are about whether strict liability applies.

So, if the defect was created by the carpenter, then strict liability doesn't apply, and the answer is A. But the options are about whether strict liability applies. So the answer would be A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fact that the store owner didn't have a defect in the brackets doesn't affect the argument. Because the problem is about whether the defect was created by the carpenter.

In this case, the store owner's defect in the brackets is separate from the defect in the installation caused by the carpenter. So the fact that the store owner didn't have a defect in the brackets doesn't affect whether the defect in the installation was caused by the carpenter.

So, the problem states the mirror fell because of a defect in the brackets. So the defect in the brackets (which were provided by the store owner) is not created by the carpenter, but the defect in the installation is.

So, the problem is that the defect was in the installation, which the carpenter created. So strict liability doesn't apply, so the answer is A.

Wait, but the first part of the answer is A, but the options are labeled A to J. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Let me think of the options again.

If the answer is A, that means strict liability doesn't apply, and the claim doesn't prevail, so the answer is A, but the options are about whether the action should be held responsible.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A because the defect was created by the carpenter, so strict liability doesn't apply.

But the options are about whether strict liability would allow the claim. If the claim is against the carpenter, and strict liability applies, then the claim doesn't prevail. But the answer is A, which says the brackets were defective when installed. So the defect was created by the carpenter, so strict liability doesn't apply, so the answer is A.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is A because the defect was created by the carpenter, so strict liability doesn't apply, the claim doesn't prevail, so the answer is A.

But another thought: the problem states that the mirror fell because of a defect in the brackets. So the defect in the brackets was provided by the store owner, but the defect in the installation was created by the carpenter. So the problem is whether the defect in the brackets was the one creating the injury.

Wait, I'm getting so stuck. Let me try to think of it in terms of the options.

The question is: is the mirror's fall due to a defect in the brackets, which the carpenter installed? If so, then the defect in the brackets was provided by the store owner, and the defect in the installation was created by the carpenter. So the problem is whether the carpenter was negligent in installing the defective mirror.

In that case, strict liability would apply because the defect was created by the carpenter. So the claim doesn't prevail, so the answer would be A.

Alternatively, if the problem is that the mirror fell because of a defect in the brackets, which the store owner had no defect in. Then the defect is in the installation, which was created by the carpenter. So again, strict liability would prevent the claim.

So in both scenarios, the defect was created by the carpenter, so strict liability doesn't apply. Therefore, the answer is A.

But wait, the options are about whether strict liability would allow the claim. So if the answer is A, that means strict liability doesn't apply. So the answer is A.

Wait, but the options are about whether strict liability would allow the claim. So if the answer is A, that would mean strict liability doesn't apply. So the claim wouldn't prevail, so the answer is A.

But I'm getting a bit stuck because I'm not certain about the options. Let me try to think of it another way.

In strict liability, the assumption is that the defendant's actions directly caused the harm. So if the store owner didn't have a defect in the brackets, then the defect is in the installation, which was done by the carpenter. So the defect was created by the carpenter, so the claim doesn't prevail. So the answer is A.

Wait, but the answer options are A to J, with each letter representing whether strict liability would allow the claim. So the correct answer is A, which states that the brackets were defective when installed, so strict liability doesn't apply, and the claim doesn't prevail.

Wait, but the options are about the answer, not about the legal reasoning. So the correct answer is A, which says that strict liability would not prevail, because the defect was created by the carpenter.

So, the answer is A.
</think>

The question revolves around whether a claim against the carpenter would succeed under strict liability. Strict liability holds when a defendant's actions directly cause harm. In this case, the mirror fell due to a defect in the brackets, which the store owner did not have a defect in. However, the defect was created by the carpenter, who installed the defective mirror.

If the defect was caused by the carpenter, strict liability does not apply, and the claim would not succeed. Therefore, the correct answer is **A**, as it indicates that the defect was created by the carpenter, making strict liability inapplicable.

ANSWER: A
