Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The conscience of the people, in a time of grave national problems, has called into being a new party, born of the nation's sense of justice. We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.
"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place."

Alright, let me try to work through this. So the question is about identifying which quote from the Progressive Party's platform best exemplifies a particular quote or statement in the provided text. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll read the text carefully to understand the main points. The text talks about the purpose of the Progressive Party, emphasizing that the people's interest is their government. It mentions Thomas Jefferson and Lincoln's view that the people are the masters of the Constitution. They also stress the need for equal opportunity and industrial justice. 

Looking at the options:

A: the nation's sense of justice
B: without which no republic can endure
C: establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice
D: the people are the masters of their Constitution
E: resources, business, etc. should be utilized, maintained, or altered
F: masters of their Constitution
G: set public welfare
H: use their sovereign powers
I: instrument of injustice
J: duty by our fathers

The text specifically says that the people are the masters of their Constitution (lines 1 and 2). So that's directly from the text. Let me look at the options. Option D says "the people are the masters of their Constitution," which is exactly what the passage states. So that's definitely the correct answer.

Looking through the options, none of the others seem to match that quote. Option B mentions without which no republic can endure, which is a consequence of the people being masters of the constitution. But the question is about the quote itself, not a consequence. So D is the direct quote.

Wait, are there any other options that might be similar? Option F says "masters of their Constitution," which is the same as D. So perhaps both D and F have the same meaning. But looking at the options, the question is about which quote in the text, so D is the exact quote. Option F is a restatement of D, but it's not the same wording. So I think D is the correct choice.

Another point: the passage says "the people are the masters of their Constitution," which is option D. So that's the direct quote. So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: "the people are the masters of their Constitution." This directly quotes the Progressive Party's stance from their platform.

Answer: D
