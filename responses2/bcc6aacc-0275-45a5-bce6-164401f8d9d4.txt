Question:

An accounting professor has been called as a defense expert witness in a white-collar criminal case. He testified that accounting records conclusively demonstrated that the defendant had not committed any type of fraud. On cross-examination of the professor, the prosecuting attorney asked him if he was familiar with a particular treatise. The professor responded affirmatively. The attorney then asked him if the treatise was accepted as authoritative and if he was aware of the conclusions regarding the ability of accountants to detect fraud. The professor responded in the affirmative. The prosecutor now attempts to read the following section of the treatise into evidence: "It is virtually impossible to state with conclusive certainty the existence, or lack thereof, of fraud in the majority of white-collar crime cases, given the sophistication of defendants and the variety of accounting methods available. "On objection by the defendant's attorney, the trial judge will

Options:

A: sustain the objection, because the professor did not rely on the treatise in making his conclusions.
B: sustain the objection, because the statements in the treatise are hearsay not within any recognized exception.
C: overrule the objection and permit the prosecutor to ask the professor about the treatise.
D: sustain the objection, because the prosecutor's question is leading.
E: sustain the objection, because the treatise is not relevant to the professor's testimony.
F: overrule the objection, because the treatise is considered a reliable source in the field of accounting.
G: overrule the objection, because the professor confirmed the treatise's authority.
H: overrule the objection and permit the entire treatise to be introduced into evidence.
I: sustain the objection, because the treatise's statements are opinion-based.
J: overrule the objection and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with cross-examination and hearsay exceptions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about an accounting professor testifying that accounting records show no fraud. When cross-examined, the prosecuting attorney asks if he's familiar with a particular treatise, and the professor says he is. Then the prosecutor asks if the treatise is accepted as authoritative and if the professor is aware of the conclusions on accountancy fraud detection.

The prosecutor tries to read the treatise, which says something like, "It's virtually impossible to state with conclusive certainty the existence or lack thereof of fraud in many white-collar crime cases..." The prosecution is asking the judge how to handle this statement.

The options involve judge overruling the objection or sustaining it. I remember that hearsay is an exception if the statement can be proven by other evidence. But if it's a statement that the defendant accepts as authoritative, that might count as an exception.

In this case, the professor is testifying about the accounting records conclusively demonstrating no fraud. Then he's asked if he's familiar with a treatise. He says yes. The prosecutor then asks about the treatise's authority and its specific conclusions.

I think the key here is whether the professor is relying on the treatise's authority. If the professor can show that the treatise is reliable, he might not need to answer the question. Alternatively, if the professor's testimony inherently supports the conclusion, maybe the answer would be different.

Wait, but the professor's testimony is about the account records, which conclusively show no fraud. The argument is that the professor's conclusion is so certain that it can't be justifiable to accept a treatise as authoritative. But I'm not sure how that works.

Alternatively, if the professor's own testimony is the authoritative source, then the prosecutor can't read the treatise as evidence. So if the judge can show that the professor's statement is reliable, then the prosecutor's cross-examination is overruled.

Looking at the options:

Option H says to overrule the objection and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence. So if the professor's own testimony is reliable, then the prosecutor can't make the argument that the treatise is authoritative.

Alternatively, if the professor's statement is hearsay and can't be proven by evidence, but since he's testifying about the truth, maybe it's not hearsay. But in this case, the professor is testifying about the existence of fraud in the account records, which is a fact that's not hearsay unless the statement is contradicted by evidence.

Wait, but the professor is testifying about the absence of fraud. That's a statement that could be made with proof, but it's about the account records, which are the truth. So the statement is based on the professor's knowledge and evidence, not hearsay.

So the professor's testimony doesn't rely on the treatise as hearsay. Therefore, the prosecutor's cross-examination about the treatise is hearsay, but the professor's own testimony is more reliable.

So the judge could overrule the objection because the professor's own testimony is trustworthy, meaning the professor's own statement is not hearsay and can't be substituted as authority.

Looking at the options, option H says to overrule the objection and permit the entire treatise to be introduced. But I'm not sure if the professor's testimony is hearsay.

Wait, no, the statement about the treatise is hearsay because it's a statement made by someone testifying. So it's hearsay. But if the professor's own testimony is the authoritative source, then the prosecutor can't read the treatise as evidence.

Alternatively, the judge must determine whether the professor's statement is hearsay. Since he's testifying about the facts (no fraud in the account records), it's not hearsay. Therefore, the statement in the treatise is hearsay and can't be used as evidence. So the judge would overrule the objection, allowing the defendant's attorney to present the statement.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The statement in the treatise is about the likelihood of fraud, based on the professor's understanding of the account records. If the professor is testifying about the absence of fraud, then that's not hearsay. So the professor's own testimony is not hearsay, but the prosecutor is asking about a statement (the treatise) that is hearsay because it's being used as a fact.

Wait, but the issue is whether the judge can read the treatise into evidence. If the professor's testimony is the authoritative source, then the treatise is not reliable, so the prosecutor cannot read it. So the judge would overrule the objection.

Looking at the options, option H says to overrule the objection and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence. So if the professor's testimony is reliable, the prosecutor can't use the treatise. That makes H the answer.

Alternatively, another option is option A, which says the professor didn't rely on the treatise, so the objection is sustained. But the question says the professor testified about the absence of fraud, so he used the account records, not the treatise. So A is incorrect.

Options B says the statements in the treatise are hearsay and can't be used. But since the professor's testimony isn't hearsay, the judge can't read the treatise. So B is incorrect.

Option C: overrule the objection to allow the professor to ask about the treatise. So the judge doesn't believe the professor's statement and doesn't ask him. But the question says the prosecutor is trying to read the statement, so the judge would overrule it.

Option D: sustain the objection because the question is leading. That seems less likely.

Option E: sustain the objection because the treatise isn't relevant. No, the question is about whether the professor's testimony concerning fraud is reliable.

Option F: overrule the objection because the treatise is a reliable source. But the issue is whether the professor's own testimony is the authoritative source. If the professor's own testimony is the authoritative source, the treatise isn't reliable. So F is incorrect.

Option G: overrule the objection because the professor confirmed the treatise's authority. That's a bit vague. If the professor says he's familiar with the treatise and it's authoritative, and the prosecutor is trying to use it, the judge might overrule. But the question is about whether the professor's own testimony is authoritative.

So the correct answer is H. The judge would overrule the objection because the professor's own testimony is reliable, so the treatise can't be used.

The question revolves around whether a professor's testimony concerning the absence of fraud in accounting records should be read as authoritative by the prosecuting attorney. The professor testified that the defendant did not commit fraud, and the prosecutor seeks to read a treatise that concludes fraud is nearly impossible. The analysis hinges on whether the professor's testimony is hearsay or not.

1. **Hearsay vs. Reliability**: The professor's testimony about the absence of fraud is not hearsay because it is based on truth and is not being proven by evidence. The treatise, however, is hearsay because it is being used as a fact.

2. **Professor's Reliability**: The professor's testimony is reliable as he is testifying about the absence of fraud. If the professor is familiar with the treatise and it is accepted as authoritative, the prosecutor cannot use the treatise as evidence.

3. **Judge's Decision**: The judge would overrule the objection because the professor's own testimony is reliable. The prosecutor cannot rely on the treatise's authority, so the objection is overruled.
