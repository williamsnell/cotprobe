Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these freezing point depression concepts. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The question is: What percent of the AB particles are dissociated by water if the freezing point of a 0.0100 m AB solution is -0.0193°C? The freezing point lowering constant of water is -1.86°C/m. The options are given from A to J, all percentages ranging from 1% to 15%.

Hmm. So, I remember that the formula for freezing point depression is ΔTf = i * Kf * m, where ΔTf is the freezing point depression, i is the van't Hoff factor, Kf is the freezing point depression constant, and m is the molality of the solution. Right?

So, first, let's plug in the numbers. The freezing point is -0.0193°C, which is a drop from 0°C, so ΔTf is 0.0193°C. The molality m is 0.0100 m. The Kf is 1.86°C/m. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait, the freezing point lowering is ΔTf = 0.0193. But the formula is ΔTf = i*Kf*m. So, since ΔTf is positive, we can write 0.0193 = i * 1.86 * 0.0100.

Let me compute that. 1.86 times 0.0100 is 0.0186. So, 0.0193 = i * 0.0186. Solving for i: i = 0.0193 / 0.0186 ≈ 1.038.

Wait, but wait a second. The van't Hoff factor 'i' can't be more than 2, right? Because for a solution of a diatomic, like AB, i can't be more than 2. So a value of 1.038 is very close to 1. So, that suggests that the ions are not dissociating much. So, each AB ion stays as one unit.

Wait, but wait. If i is about 1, that suggests that the particles are not dissociated. So, the percentage dissociated would be (1 - (i-1)/i )*100%. Because, if all were dissociated, i would be 2. So, percentage dissociated would be [(2 - i)/2 ] * 100.

Wait, let me think about that. Let me clarify.

Suppose a solution where each AB molecule dissociates into A and B ions. So, if the solution is 1 mol of AB per mol of solvent, then each AB molecule would dissociate into 2 ions. So, the van 't Hoff factor i would be 2. But if it's not dissociating, i is 1. So, the dissociation fraction (alpha) is (i-1)/i. Wait, wait, alpha is the fraction that dissociates. So, for example, if all AB dissociate, i=2, alpha=1. So, alpha = (i -1)/i.

Wait, but if i=1, then alpha=0. So, no dissociation.

So, for i=1.038, alpha = (1.038 -1)/1.038 = 0.038 /1.038 ≈ 0.0366, which is about 3.66%. So approximately 3.66% dissociated.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the degree of dissociation. Let's say the solution is made of AB.

If it's completely dissociated, AB → A + B, so each AB gives two ions. i=2.

If it's not dissociated, AB remains as one unit, so i=1.

In our case, i is about 1.038, which is very close to 1. So, the degree of dissociation α is (i -1)/i. So 0.038 / 1.038 ≈ 0.0366, so about 3.66% dissociation. So the percentage dissociated is approximately 3.66%, which is around 3.66%, which is closest to option H (3%) or option G (15%)? Wait, the options are from 1% to 15%, in steps of 2% perhaps.

Wait, the options are A:12%, B:6%, C:8%, D:10%, E:2%, F:4%, G:15%, H:3%, I:5%, J:7%. So 3.66% is 3.66 ≈ 4%? Because 3.66 is closer to 4% than 3% is. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is slightly different.

Wait, let me go back to the calculation. 0.0193 / (1.86 * 0.0100) = 0.0193 / 0.0186 = approx 1.038.

Wait, so i = 1.038. So, the degree of dissociation alpha is (i-1)/i = 0.038 /1.038 = about 0.0366, or 3.66% as before.

But looking at the options, the closest is 3% (H) or 4% (F). Wait, 3.66 is closer to 4% than 3%. So, the answer should be approximately 4%. But wait, the options may not have it. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A:12%, B:6%, C:8%, D:10%, E:2%, F:4%, G:15%, H:3%, I:5%, J:7%.

So, 3.66% is closest to 4%, which is option F. But wait, wait—hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact value.

Wait, 0.0193 / 0.0186 = let's compute that. 0.0186 is approximately 1.86e-2.

So, 0.0193 is 1.93e-2.

So, 1.93e-2 / 1.86e-2 = 1.93 /1.86 ≈ 1.038.

So, i=1.038.

Then, (i-1) = 0.038.

i=1.038.

So, alpha = 0.038 / 1.038 = 0.0366, which is about 3.66%. So, approximately 4% dissociation.

But wait, looking at the options, 4% is F. So the answer would be F:4%.

Wait, but wait, if i is approximately 1.038, that's very close to 1. So, the solution is nearly non-dissociated. So, the percentage of AB dissociated would be about 3.66%, which is approximately 4%.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula is ΔTf = i*Kf*m. So, to find i, we have i = ΔTf/(Kf * m). So, plugging in the numbers: 0.0193 = i * 1.86 * 0.0100. So, 0.0193 = i * 0.0186.

So, i=0.0193/0.0186. Let me compute this exactly:

0.0193 ÷ 0.0186 = 1.038.

So, i is 1.038.

So, the degree of dissociation alpha is (i−1)/i = (0.038)/(1.038) ≈ 0.0366, which is 3.66%.

So, the percentage dissociated is approximately 3.66%, which is about 4% when rounded to the nearest whole number, but the nearest option is F (4%) or H (3%).

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be 3% (H) because when you calculate, it's about 3.7% which rounds to 4%, but perhaps the options don't have 4%, but G is 15%, which is way too big. Alternatively, perhaps the initial setup is wrong.

Wait, another approach: Is the solution of AB a case of dissociation? Let me think about this. If AB is a diatomic molecule, like NaCl, which dissociates into Na+ and Cl-, then i=2. But in this case, AB is a AB molecule, like MgSO4, which dissociates into Mg^2+ and SO4^2-.

So, if the solution is 0.0100 m AB, meaning that for each mole of AB, we have 0.0100 moles of AB in 1 kg of solvent.

If AB is a diatomic, each AB gives two ions. So, the expected i is 2. But in our calculation, i is 1.038, which suggests that it's not dissociating much. So, the degree of dissociation is 3.66%, which is about 4%. But looking at the options, 4% is F.

Wait, but let's think again. The problem statement says "AB particles are dissociated." So, perhaps during dissociation, each AB molecule splits into A and B ions. If it's not dissociated, then there's no dissociation, i=1.

So, in our case, i is about 1.038, so the dissociation is 3.66%. So, the percentage of AB particles that are dissociated is about 3.66%. So, the closest option is F:4%.

But wait, another way to think about this: perhaps the problem is considering the solution of AB as a solution where the ions are of a different nature. For example, if the solution is a 0.0100 m of a salt, like NaCl, which is a strong electrolyte, so it dissociates completely. But in this case, the solution is 0.0100 m AB, and the freezing point depression is lower than expected, indicating that AB is not very dissociated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is a solution where each AB molecule dissociates into A and B ions. So, for each mole of AB, it produces two moles of ions. But since the solution is 0.0100 m, each mole produces two ions. So, the total concentration of ions would be 0.0200 m, but according to the formula, the freezing point depression is ΔTf = i*Kf*m, where m is the molality of the solution.

Wait, but in this case, the solution is 0.0100 m of AB, but the freezing point depression is due to the ions. So, if the solution is not dissociated, i=1, so ΔTf is 1.86 * 0.0100 = 0.0186°C. The actual ΔTf is 0.0193, which is higher. So, that suggests that the solution is more than fully ionized, but wait, that doesn't make sense because for a diatomic AB, each molecule gives two ions. So, the maximum possible i would be 2. Let me see:

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not dissociating into ions. So, the freezing point is lower than expected if the solution were to dissociate completely.

Wait, not necessarily. Let me think again. The formula is ΔTf = i*Kf*m.

If the solution is 0.0100 m AB and it's not dissociating, then i=1. So, the expected ΔTf is 1 * 1.86 * 0.0100 = 0.0186°C. But the observed ΔTf is 0.0193°C, which is higher. So, that suggests that the solution is more than fully ionized, which is impossible for a diatomic AB molecule. So, perhaps the solution is not completely ionized, but not all the AB molecules are dissociated. So, the degree of dissociation is 3.66% as before.

So, the percentage dissociated is approximately 3.66%, so 4% is the closest option, which is F.

To determine the percentage of AB particles that are dissociated by water, we use the formula for freezing point depression:

\[
\Delta T_f = i \cdot K_f \cdot m
\]

where:
- \( \Delta T_f \) is the freezing point depression,
- \( i \) is the van't Hoff factor (number of particles the solute dissociates into),
- \( K_f \) is the freezing point depression constant (\(-1.86^\circ C/m\)),
- \( m \) is the molality of the solution.

### Step 1: Plug in the given values
The problem states:
- \( \Delta T_f = 0.0193^\circ C \),
- \( m = 0.0100 \, \text{m} \),
- \( K_f = 1.86 \, \text{°C/m} \).

Substitute these into the formula:

\[
0.0193 = i \cdot 1.86 \cdot 0.0100
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( i \)
First, calculate the product of \( K_f \) and \( m \):

\[
1.86 \cdot 0.0100 = 0.0186
\]

Now, solve for \( i \):

\[
i = \frac{0.0193}{0.0186} \approx 1.038
\]

### Step 3: Determine the degree of dissociation
The van't Hoff factor \( i \) represents the number of particles the solute dissociates into. If the solution is not dissociated, \( i = 1 \). The degree of dissociation (\( \alpha \)) is given by:

\[
\alpha = \frac{i - 1}{i}
\]

Substitute \( i = 1.038 \):

\[
\alpha = \frac{1.038 - 1}{1.038} = \frac{0.038}{1.038} \approx 0.0366 \, \text{or} \, 3.66\%
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated degree of dissociation is approximately 3.66%. Among the given options, the closest value is **4%**.

### Conclusion
The percentage of AB particles that are dissociated by water is approximately **4%**.
