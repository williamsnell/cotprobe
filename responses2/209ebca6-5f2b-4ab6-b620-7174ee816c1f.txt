Question:

Fifty oranges of one variety were selected at random and weighed. A 95 percent confidence interval computed from the sample weights to estimate the mean weight of oranges of this variety is (7.58, 8.72) ounces. Which of the following statements is true with respect to the confidence level used?

Options:

A: In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety.
B: Ninety-five percent of the oranges of this variety weigh between 7.58 and 8.72 ounces.
C: In repeated samplings of the same size, 5 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety.
D: Ninety-five percent of the oranges in this sample weigh exactly 7.58 or 8.72 ounces.
E: In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the sampled mean weight of the oranges.
F: In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the oranges will weigh between 7.58 and 8.72 ounces.
G: In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will exclude the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety.
H: Ninety-five percent of the oranges of this variety weigh exactly 7.58 or 8.72 ounces.
I: The interval (7.58, 8.72) ounces represents the range of all possible mean weights of the oranges of this variety.
J: Ninety-five percent of the oranges in this sample weigh between 7.58 and 8.72 ounces.

Okay, so I've got this question about confidence intervals and their interpretation. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that fifty oranges were randomly selected and weighed. They calculated a 95% confidence interval for the mean weight, and it's (7.58, 8.72) ounces. Now, the question is about which statement is true regarding the confidence level. The options are A to J.

Hmm, I remember that a confidence interval gives us a range of values that likely contains the true population mean. The 95% confidence level means that if we were to take many samples and construct confidence intervals each time, about 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean. So, the correct interpretation is about the long-run frequency of capturing the true mean.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A: In repeated samplings of the same size, 95% of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean. That sounds exactly like what a 95% confidence interval means. So A seems correct.

Option B: 95% of oranges weigh between 7.58 and 8.72. Wait, that's confusing. The confidence interval is about the mean, not individual oranges. So B is talking about the oranges' weights, not the mean. Unless the oranges' weights are, say, normally distributed, but the interval is for the mean, not the individual data points. So B is likely incorrect.

Option C: 5% of intervals contain the true mean. No, because that's the complement. Wait, noâ€”95% chance the true mean is in the interval, so 5% would mean 95% not containing it. So C is the opposite of A, so that's not correct.

Option D: 95% of the oranges weigh between 7.58 and 8.72. Again, oranges' weights. The interval is about the mean, not individual oranges. So D is wrong.

Option E: 95% of intervals contain the sample mean. Wait, no. The sample mean is a single point, not an interval. So E is talking about the sample mean, which is a point estimate, not the mean of the means. So E is incorrect.

Option F: 95% of the oranges weigh between 7.58 and 8.72. Again, this is about individual oranges, not the mean. So F is wrong.

Option G: 95% of intervals exclude the true mean. That's the opposite of A. So G is wrong.

Option H: 95% of oranges are between, but wait, that's not how confidence intervals work. The interval is for the mean, not individual oranges. So H is incorrect.

Option I: The interval represents all possible mean weights. No, the interval is a single range for the mean. It's not the range of all possible means. So I's incorrect.

Option J: 95% of the sample oranges weigh between 7.58 and 8.72. Again, this is about the sample oranges, not the mean. So J is wrong.

So the only correct statement is option A.

The correct interpretation is given by option A. A 95% confidence interval means that, in repeated samplings, 95% of the constructed intervals will contain the true mean weight. 

Answer: A
