Okay, so I have this chemistry question here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about a lab scenario where a diabetic's urine is added to Fehling's solution, and then heated. I need to find what red copper compound precipitates.

Hmm, I remember Fehling's solution is used to test for copper ions. It's an acidic solution that reacts with copper ions, especially when heated. The reaction with copper ions produces a specific precipitate.

Wait, what's Fehling's solution made of? Oh right, it's a copper sulfate solution in an acid. When you add it to copper ions, especially in a test tube, it forms something. When heated, the copper ions react. So the reaction is something like Cu^2+ + H+ → Cu^2+ + H2O (maybe?) but then when heated, they form something more.

I think the precipitate when Fehling's solution is heated is copper hydroxide. Oh wait, but wait. Fehling's is usually used to test for copper ions, but when you add it to a solution containing other ions, like maybe some other copper compounds, and then heat, maybe a different product forms.

Wait, the question says the analyst puts Fehling's solution in a test tube and then adds the urine of a diabetic, which contains some sugar. So the solution is Fehling (CuSO4 in HCl) plus the diabetic's urine solution. The diurea is a clear solution with sugar. So the mixture is acidic because Fehling's solution is acidic, and the diurea is neutral (sugar).

So when you mix Fehling's (which is like CuSO4 in HCl) with the diurea, which is a sugar solution, the solution becomes acidic. Then, when heated, I think something happens. The reaction would involve the copper ions reacting with the acid.

Wait, but Fehling's solution is copper sulfate solution, and adding a sugar solution. When you mix them, the solution is now acidic (since sugar is neutral, but Fehling's solution is acidic; acid + neutral = acidic mixture). Then, when heated, the copper ions and the acid would react.

So, the reaction would be: Cu^2+ + H+ → Cu^2+ + H2O, but no precipitate. Then, in the presence of water, maybe the Cu^2+ reacts with the H+ to form CuSO4, which is the copper sulfate. But that's a solution, not a precipitate. So maybe something else happens.

Wait, no, perhaps when the solution is heated, the copper reacts with the acid. So maybe the copper ions react with the H+ in the acid. The copper(II) ions would form a complex. But what's the precipitate?

Alternatively, perhaps the diurea is a sugar solution, which is neutral. When Fehling's (acidic) solution is mixed with diurea, the mixture becomes acidic. Then, upon heating, perhaps the copper ions react with the water (from the acid and diurea) to form a precipitate.

Wait, I think I remember that when Fehling's solution is treated with a solution containing copper ions (like copper sulfate), it can form a precipitate. But in this case, the solution is Fehling's (which is acidic) mixed with a sugar solution.

Wait, no, maybe it's the reverse. Fehling's solution contains copper ions and is acidic. When you add a sugar solution (which is neutral), the mixture becomes acidic. Then, when heated, the copper ions react with the acid. Since the solution is acidic, the copper ions form a complex with water, but the solution might have some H+ ions, so when heated, maybe some copper hydroxide forms.

Wait, but when I think about Fehling's test, adding Fehling's solution (which contains Cu^2+ as the copper ion) to a solution of copper sulfate in HCl, the copper ions react with the H+ to form CuSO4. But when you add a diurea solution, which is sugar, how does that affect things?

Wait, perhaps the diurea solution acts as a copper source. But I'm a bit fuzzy here. Let me think about the possible reactions.

In Fehling's test, the reaction with Cu^2+ in acidic conditions produces a precipitate. The reaction is:

Cu^2+ + H+ → Cu^2+ + H2O, but that's in the solution. When heated, maybe the Cu^2+ reacts further, but I don't think that's a precipitate. Alternatively, perhaps the diurea's sugar solution is in such a high concentration that when heated, some copper hydroxide precipitates.

Wait, maybe the correct precipitate is copper hydroxide. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think. The options are:

A: Cu2O (which is black, but I think it's CuO that's the oxide, but Cu2O is a white solid? Or maybe I'm wrong.)

Wait, no. Cu2O is actually the oxide of copper. But when copper reacts with water, it forms CuO and H2O. So the precipitate is CuO, which is white.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is that the diurea solution is a source of copper ions. But that doesn't make sense because diurea is a sugar solution, not a copper source.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction between Fehling solution (CuSO4 in HCl) and diurea (sugar solution). The mixture is acidic.

When heated, the solution becomes even more acidic. The copper ions would react with the H+ ions. But the solution is acidic, so maybe the copper ions form a complex, but what precipitates?

Wait, perhaps the diurea's sugar is a source of a copper-containing compound, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe the diurea solution has some copper, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible products when Fehling's solution is heated. I think that when you add Fehling's solution to a solution of CuSO4 in HCl, the copper ions form a complex with the Cu^2+ and H+ ions, but perhaps in this case, when you add the diurea (which is a sugar solution), the mixture is acidic.

So the mixture is acidic, and heating it would lead to the Cu^2+ reacting with water. But where would the precipitate come from? Maybe the diurea is a source of some Cu-containing compound, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is that the Fehling's solution and the diurea's sugar form a complex, but no precipitate forms. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction between the acidic solution and water in the diurea leads to the formation of Cu(OH)2, which is a white precipitate.

Wait, but Fehling's solution is already an acidic solution. So when you add a neutral solution (like diurea), the mixture is acidic. Then, when heated, the solution may dissolve some copper ions, but maybe some copper hydroxide forms.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction between Fehling's acidic solution and the diurea (neutral) gives an acidic mixture. Heating this would cause the Cu^2+ to react with water, forming Cu(OH)2. But wait, would that be a precipitate?

Wait, Cu(OH)2 is a white precipitate, and it's one of the options here. Option E is CuOH (which is the same as Cu(OH)2). But wait, in the options, E is CuOH, which I think is Cu(OH)2.

Alternatively, perhaps the diurea's sugar is acting as a copper source. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the possible reaction steps.

The Fehling solution is CuSO4 in HCl. It's a clear solution, and when mixed with a sugar solution (like diurea), the mixture becomes acidic. Then, heating this solution results in the reaction of the copper ions with water, forming a precipitate.

The reaction is: Cu^2+ + H2O → Cu(OH)2 (white precipitate).

So the precipitate would be copper hydroxide, which is option E: CuOH. Wait, but wait, is that the right formula?

Cu(OH)2 is written as CuOH, I think. Or perhaps the formula is written as Cu(OH)2, but in the options, it's labeled as E: CuOH. Let me check the options again.

Options:

E: CuOH

Which is the same as Cu(OH)2.

So, the precipitate would be Cu(OH)2, which is option E.

Wait, but I thought when you mix Fehling's solution with a sugar solution, the mixture is acidic. When heated, the Cu^2+ reacts with the water to form Cu(OH)2, which is a white precipitate.

So the correct answer would be option E, CuOH.

The question involves a laboratory scenario where Fehling's solution (a copper sulfate solution in acidic form) is mixed with the urine of a diabetic, which contains sugar. Upon heating, the precipitate formed is determined as follows:

1. **Reaction of Fehling's Solution**: Fehling's solution contains copper ions (Cu²⁺) in an acidic environment. When mixed with a neutral sugar solution (like the diurea), the mixture becomes acidic.

2. **Heating the Mixture**: Upon heating, the acidic solution reacts with water. The copper ions (Cu²⁺) react with water to form a white precipitate of copper hydroxide (Cu(OH)₂), which is commonly known as CuOH.

3. **Analysis of Options**: The possible precipitates from the reaction include:
   - **Cu₂O (Option A)**: This is a black oxide and not relevant here.
   - **Cu₃(PO₄)₂ (Option B)**: This is a phosphate compound and not formed in this reaction.
   - **CuO (Option C)**: This is the oxide of copper and forms during the reaction of copper ions with water but is not the precipitate formed here.
   - **Cu₂SO₄ (Option D)**: This is a copper sulfate solution and not a precipitate.
   - **CuOH (Option E)**: This is the correct precipitate formed when copper ions react with water.
   - **Cu(NO₃)₂ (Option F)**: This is a copper nitrate solution and not relevant.
   - **CuCl₂ (Option G)**: This is a copper chloride solution and not formed here.
   - **CuBr₂ (Option H)**: This is a copper bromide solution and not relevant.
   - **CuCO₃ (Option I)**: This is a carbonate compound and not formed here.
   - **CuSO₄ (Option J)**: This is a copper sulfate solution and not a precipitate.

The precipitate formed is copper hydroxide (Cu(OH)₂), which corresponds to **Option E: CuOH**.
