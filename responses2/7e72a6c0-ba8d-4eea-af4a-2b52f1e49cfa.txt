Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about orbital angular momentum quantum number, l. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think. The question is about the last character of the response being the letter chosen, so I don't need to worry about that part.

The question says: What is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, l, of the electron that is most easily removed when ground-state aluminum is ionized. The options are A to J, with letters from 0 to 8. I need to find which one is correct.

Wait, so when aluminum is ionized, the electron that's most easily removed—wait, no, wait. Ionization involves losing an electron. But the question is about the electron that gets removed when aluminum is ionized. Oh wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let's clarify: when an atom is ionized, it loses an electron. So the ion would have a higher positive charge. But the question is about the electron that is most easily removed—wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read again.

Oh, wait, wait. The electron in question is the one that's removed when aluminum is ionized. So the process is ionization. So aluminum's ground state is Al^0. When it loses an electron, it becomes Al^+.

But wait, the question says the electron that's most easily removed. Oh, but aluminum is already a neutral atom, right? So when it's ionized, it loses an electron. Wait, but aluminum has electrons in a certain configuration. When it loses an electron, the resulting ion would have one more electron than aluminum has. Or wait, aluminum's electron configuration is [Ne] 3s² 3p¹. So when it loses an electron, it becomes [Ne] 3s² 3p⁰, which is Al^+.

Wait, but the question is about the electron that is removed when aluminum is ionized. Hmm. Maybe the question is about the electron that's available for removal. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the ground state of aluminum, so when it loses electrons, which one is the easiest to remove. But I'm getting confused. Maybe the question is about the electron which is in the highest energy level, so it's the easiest to remove. So the ionization energy is highest for the electron that's in the highest energy level.

So for aluminum, what's its electron configuration? Aluminum has atomic number 13. Its electron configuration is [Ne] 3s² 3p¹. So the electrons are arranged in the 3s and 3p orbitals. The 3p orbital can hold up to 6 electrons (3 orbitals * 2 each). So the 3p is the outermost shell.

So when aluminum is ionized, it loses an electron. The question is about which electron is most easily removed. Wait, but aluminum is already in a neutral state, so when it loses an electron, it becomes Al^+ with one more electron. So the electrons are in the same configuration as Al, but with one less electron. Wait, wait, no. No, aluminum has 13 electrons. If it loses one, it becomes 12 electrons. So the configuration would be [Ne] 3s² 3p^0. So the 3p is completely filled. Wait, no, [Ne] is 10, so 13-1=12. So 3s² 3p^0.

Wait, but when you remove an electron, you're losing the 3p one. No, wait, if the configuration is [Ne] 3s² 3p¹ (neutral), then losing an electron would take it to [Ne] 3s² 3p^0, so the 3p is now empty. So the electron that's removed (when the ion is formed) is the one in the 3p orbital.

But wait, the question is about when the electron is removed. The more easily removed electron is the one in the highest energy level, right? Because the more energy is needed to remove it. So the 3p electrons are higher in energy than 3s. So when the ion is formed (Al^+), the 3p electrons are the ones that are available for removal, but in this case, the 3p is empty. So perhaps the question is about the ground state of aluminum; when it loses an electron, which is the least likely to be removed? Wait, no, the question is about the electron that is most easily removed. Hmm. Maybe it's the one that's in a higher energy level. So the 3p electrons are higher than 3s, so when you remove an electron, the one that's in 3p is easier to remove because they're higher in energy. So the most easily removed electron would be the one in 3p.

Wait, but in the ground state, Al has an electron in 3p. When you lose an electron, that electron leaves, and the Al^+ ion has a 3p^0 configuration. So the electrons in the 3s² and 3p^0 are the available ones.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the question is about the electron configuration of the ion. So when you ionize aluminum, the electron in the 3p orbital is the one that's easiest to remove because it's higher in energy, and thus requires higher energy (more ionization energy) to remove. So the most easily removed electron is the one in the 3p orbital because it's higher in energy.

So the question is about the orbital angular momentum quantum number (l) of that electron. The 3p orbital has l=1. So the correct option would be B: 2? No, wait, wait. Wait, the 3p is n=3, l=1. So the l value is 1.

Looking at the options, option B is 2, option H is 1. So B is 2, H is 1. So the correct answer is H:1.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question asks, "What is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, l, of the electron that is most easily removed when ground-state aluminum is ionized?" So when the electron is removed, which one is it.

Wait, if the electron is in the 3p orbital, then l is 1. So the correct answer would be H:1.

Wait, but wait again. Or perhaps the question is about the electron's position in the ion. So when aluminum is ionized, the electron that's easiest to remove is the one in the 3p orbital, so l=1. Hence the orbital angular momentum quantum number is 1, which is option H.

Looking at the options:

A:5

B:2

C:-1

D:4

E:6

F:3

G:7

H:1

I:0

J:8

So the correct one is H:1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because I thought that the 3p electrons are higher in energy than 3s, so when you remove an electron from Al^+, you get Al^2+ where the 3p is completely empty. So the 3p electrons are the ones that were in Al's neutral state, but now are removed, leaving the Al^+ ion.

Wait, no. The ground state of Al is [Ne]3s²3p¹. When Al loses an electron (ionization), it becomes Al^+, which is [Ne]3s²3p⁰. So the 3p orbital is empty. So the electrons in 3p are the ones that can be removed, and they are the easiest to remove because they are higher in energy. So the electron in 3p is the one that's most easily removed. So l is 1, which is option H.

So the answer is H:1. So option H.

To determine the orbital angular momentum quantum number, \( l \), of the electron that is most easily removed when ground-state aluminum is ionized, we analyze the electron configuration of aluminum and the implications of ionization.

1. **Electron Configuration of Aluminum**:  
   Aluminum has an atomic number of 13, so its ground-state electron configuration is \([Ne] 3s^2 3p^1\). This means the outermost electrons are in the 3p orbital, which can hold up to 6 electrons.

2. **Ionization Process**:  
   When aluminum is ionized, it loses one electron. The ground-state electron configuration of aluminum remains \([Ne] 3s^2 3p^0\) for aluminum⁺. The 3p orbital is now completely empty.

3. **Most Easily Removed Electron**:  
   The electron in the 3p orbital is the easiest to remove because it is in the highest energy level (higher orbital energy) compared to the 3s orbital. This requires more energy to remove.

4. **Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number (\( l \))**:  
   The 3p orbital corresponds to \( n = 3 \) and \( l = 1 \). Therefore, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is \( l = 1 \).

5. **Correct Option**:  
   Among the given options, \( l = 1 \) corresponds to option H.
