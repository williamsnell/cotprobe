Okay, so I've got this question about random variables and their properties. Hmm, let me think. The question says that X and Y are independent random variables. I remember that when variables are independent, their covariance is zero. Oh wait, but wait, for this question, I don't think covariance is directly needed. Wait, the main thing here is to find the mean and standard deviation of X plus Y.

The given information is: μx is 32, σx is 5, μy is 44, and σy is 12. So, X has mean 32, Y has mean 44, and they're independent.

I think the mean of the sum of two variables is just the sum of their means. So, μx+y should be μx plus μy. Let's calculate that: 32 + 44 is 76. Oh, that's one of the options. So the mean part is 76.

Now, what about the standard deviation of X + Y? Since X and Y are independent, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances. Because variance of X + Y is Var(X) + Var(Y) (since Cov(X, Y) is zero because they're independent). 

Wait, but standard deviation is the square root of variance. So, first, I need to find Var(X) and Var(Y). Since Var(X) is σx squared, that's 5 squared, which is 25. Var(Y) is σy squared, so 12 squared is 144.

Adding them together: 25 + 144 equals 169. So the variance of X + Y is 169, and the standard deviation is the square root of 169, which is 13. 

Wait, let me double-check that. So X has variance 25 and Y has 144. So X+Y has variance 25 + 144 = 169. sqrt(169) is indeed 13. So the standard deviation is 13.

Looking back at the options, let's see which one has μx+y =76 and σx+y=13. Option E says μx+y =76 and σx+y=13. So the answer should be E.

The mean of the sum of two independent random variables is the sum of their means, so μx+y = μx + μy = 32 + 44 = 76. The variance of the sum is the sum of their variances, so Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) = (5)² + (12)² = 25 + 144 = 169. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, so σx+y = √169 = 13. Among the options, E matches μx+y = 76 and σx+y = 13.

Answer: E
