Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the value of f(8) given some recursive function. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says that f(x) is a function whose graph passes through the origin, which means f(0) = 0. That's a good starting point. 

The recursive formula given is f(2n) = n² + f[2(n - 1)] for every integer n. Hmm, so this relates the value of the function at an even integer to the value at a smaller even integer. I think I can use this to compute f(2), f(4), up to f(8).

Let me try plugging in n = 1. Then, f(2*1) = 1² + f(2*(1-1)) → f(2) = 1 + f(0). But since f(0) is 0, that's just f(2) = 1.

Now, n = 2. Then, f(4) = 2² + f(2) → 4 + 1 = 5. So f(4) is 5.

Next, n =3. f(6) = 3² + f(4) → 9 +5 =14. So f(6) =14.

Then, n=4: f(8) =4² + f(6) → 16 +14 =30. So f(8) is 30.

Wait, but I should check if this pattern holds. Let's see. Each time, the function at 2n is n squared plus the function at 2(n-1). So every step adds n².

So f(2) = 1 (from n=1)
f(4) =5 (from n=2)
f(6)=14 (from n=3)
f(8)=30 (from n=4)
So yes, f(8)=30.

Looking at the options, B is 30, so that should be the answer.

To find \( f(8) \), we use the recursive formula \( f(2n) = n^2 + f[2(n - 1)] \) and the fact that \( f(0) = 0 \).

1. For \( n = 1 \): \( f(2) = 1^2 + f(0) = 1 \).
2. For \( n = 2 \): \( f(4) = 2^2 + f(2) = 4 + 1 = 5 \).
3. For \( n = 3 \): \( f(6) = 3^2 + f(4) = 9 + 5 = 14 \).
4. For \( n = 4 \): \( f(8) = 4^2 + f(6) = 16 + 14 = 30 \).

Thus, \( f(8) = 30 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
