Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about baseball figures and a court-martial acquittal for insubordination. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which famous baseball figure was acquitted at a court-martial for insubordination. The options are labeled A through J, and each corresponds to a different baseball player.

First, I need to recall which players were acquitted for actions like not wearing a uniform properly or not following rules. I remember that there's a specific case involving a player who wasn't following the rules of uniform dress when a pitcher was involved. 

Wait, I think it was Sammy O'Keal, but Sammy was from Major League Baseball, right? Or was it another player? Oh, I remember now. It was Ted Williams, but wait, no, that's a different situation. Alternatively, was it Joe DiMaggio? No, DiMaggio was a big player known for playing in the World Series and was involved in a scandal with his uniform.

Wait, wasn't it a case involving a pitcher who didn't follow the rules? I think it was a pitcher named Joe DiMaggio, but no, DiMaggio was aypy, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The scenario is a court-martial acquittal for insubordination. So, the player either didn't follow the rules or didn't respect the rules of the opposing team. 

I think the correct figure is Joe DiMaggio. Wait, no, Joe DiMaggio was aypy, so he was involved in a scandal where he didn't follow the rules. So, maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, is it a different player? 

Wait, another thought: there's a case involving a pitcher named Joe DiMaggio who didn't follow the rules, but he was acquitted. Or perhaps it's a different person. Let me think about the other players.

The options given are:

A: Babe Ruth
B: Ty Cobb
C: Hank Aaron
D: Willie Mays
E: Joe DiMaggio
F: Abner Doubleday
G: Ted Williams
H: Jackie Robinson
I: Billy Martin
J: Mickey Mantle

I think the correct answer is either Joe DiMaggio or Ted Williams. But wait, I'm pretty sure it was a case involving Sammy, but wait, no, Sammy was Major League. 

Wait, no, I remember that the case was about a pitcher named Joe DiMaggio. Let me think: Joe DiMaggio was aypy, so he didn't wear the proper uniform in the World Series. In the 1970s, he was involved in a scandal where he didn't follow the rules, leading to him being acquitted. So, he was acquitted because he didn't wear the proper uniform during the World Series.

Wait, but another possibility: the player was Sammy, but he was Major Leage. So, that's not an option here. So from the given options, the answer is Joe DiMaggio. But wait, looking back at the options, option E is Joe DiMaggio.

Alternatively, I'm mixing up the names. Let me think again. The player in question was a Major League player, and he didn't follow the rules of the opposing team's uniform. So, the correct answer should be Joe DiMaggio, which is option E.

Wait, but I also recall that there's a case involving a pitcher named Joe DiMaggio who was acquitted because he didn't wear the proper uniform during the World Series. So, yes, the answer is E.

The correct answer is E: Joe DiMaggio. He was acquitted for not following the rules of the opposing team's uniform during the World Series.

Answer: E
