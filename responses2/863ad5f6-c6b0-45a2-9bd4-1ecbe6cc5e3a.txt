Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about point charges and electrostatic force. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see.

The question says: Two point charges, q1 is 26.0 microcoulombs and q2 is -47.0 microcoulombs. We need to find the distance between them so that the electrostatic force between them is 5.70 Newtons. The options are given, but I guess I need to calculate it myself.

Wait, right. Coulomb's law! Oh yeah, F = k * |q1 * q2| / r². But wait, wait. Oh wait, wait. Because one is positive and the other negative, the product will be negative, but since we're taking the magnitude, the force's magnitude is positive. So I can ignore the signs for the calculation, just focus on the product's absolute value.

So, the formula is F = (k * |q1 * q2| ) / r². I need to solve for r. So rearranging, r = sqrt( (k * |q1 * q2| ) / F ). 

Let me plug in the numbers. 

First, k is Coulomb's constant. I think it's about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But sometimes it's approximated as 9e9 for simplicity. Let me go with 9e9 for now. 

q1 is 26.0 μC, which is 26e-6 C. q2 is -47.0 μC, which is 47e-6 C. So the product is 26e-6 * 47e-6. Let me calculate that. 26*47 is 1222. So 1222e-12 C². So the absolute value is 1222e-12.

Wait, but wait, 26 * 47: 25*47 is 1175, plus 1*47 =147, so 1175+147=1322. Oh I get 1322, not 1222. Wait, I thought 26 *47 is 1222. Wait let me compute again. 26 * 47. 47 * 20 = 940, 47 *6=282. 940+282=1222. Oh, okay, so 1222e-12. 

Wait, that can't be right. Because 26e-6 is 2.6e-5, and 47e-6 is 4.7e-5. 2.6e-5 *4.7e-5 = (2.6 *4.7) *1e-10. 2.6 *4 is 10.4, 2.6 *0.7 is 1.82, so 10.4 +1.82=12.22. So 12.22e-10, which is 1.222e-9? Hmm, wait. Oh wait, no, 2.6e-5 *4.7e-5 is (2.6 *4.7) *1e-10. 2.6 *4.7 is 12.22, so 12.22e-10, or 1.222e-9. 

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 1222e-12, which is same as 1.222e-9. Oh same thing. So |q1*q2|=1.222e-9 C².

Now, plug into F = k * (1.222e-9) / r² =5.70 N.

So solving for r:

r² = (k * 1.222e-9) /5.70

Let me compute k *1.222e-9. k is 8.988e9, so 8.988e9 * 1.222e-9.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 1.222e-9 equals (8.988 *1.222) * (e9 * e-9) )= (approx 10.96) * 1 --> 10.96.

So r squared is (10.96) /5.70.

Wait 10.96 /5.70 is approximately 1.925.

So r squared is 1.925, so r is sqrt(1.925). Let me compute that. The square root of 1.96 is 1.4, because 1.4^2=1.96. 1.925 is a bit less, so maybe around 1.387.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(1.925). Hmm, 1.387 squared is (1.387)^2. Let me compute 1.387 *1.387.

1.3 *1.3 is 1.69, 0.087 *1.3 is 0.1131, 1.3 *0.087 is 0.1131, and 0.087^2 is about 0.007569. So adding:

Wait more accurately, (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

a=1.3, b=0.087.

a² = (1.3)^2 = 1.69.

2ab = 2 *1.3 * 0.087 = 2.6 *0.087 = approx 0.2262.

b² = (0.087)^2 = 0.007569.

Adding all together: 1.69 +0.2262=1.9162 +0.007569=1.923769. Close to 1.925.

So sqrt(1.925) is about 1.387. Let me see. 1.387^2 is approximately 1.9237, which is a bit less than 1.925. So the actual square root is a bit higher. Let's say 1.387^2=1.9237, so 1.925 is 1.9237 +0.0013. The derivative of x^2 at x=1.387 is 2x=2.774. So the increase needed is 0.0013 /2.774 ≈ 0.00047. So 1.387 + 0.00047 ≈ 1.38747. So sqrt is approximately 1.3875.

So r is approximately 1.3875 meters. Let me look at the options.

The options are:

A:2.10 m

B:1.85 m

C:1.50 m

D:1.39 m

E:0.98 m

F:1.20 m

G:0.80 m

H:1.75 m

I:1.60 m

J:1.05 m

So option D is 1.39 m, which is about what I calculated. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial steps. The formula is F = k * |q1 q2| / r². Yes.

So q1 is 26e-6, q2 -47e-6. The product is 26 *47 = 1222. So 1222e-12 C². Correct.

So 1222e-12 is 1.222e-9 C². Correct.

k is 8.988e9 N m²/C². Correct.

So, F = 8.988e9 * 1.222e-9 / r² =5.70 N.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 1.222e-9 = (8.988 * 1.222) * (e9 *e-9) )= (approx 10.96) *1 =10.96.

So 10.96 /5.70 = about 1.925. So r²=1.925, so r= sqrt(1.925)= ~1.387 m.

Which is about 1.39 m. So option D is 1.39 m, which matches.

To determine the distance between two point charges, we use Coulomb's law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( r \):

\[
r = \sqrt{\frac{k \cdot |q_1 \cdot q_2|}{F}}
\]

### Given:
- \( q_1 = 26.0 \, \mu\mathrm{C} = 26.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \)
- \( q_2 = -47.0 \, \mu\mathrm{C} = 47.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \) (magnitude is \( 47.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \))
- \( F = 5.70 \, \mathrm{N} \)
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \)

### Step 1: Calculate \( |q_1 \cdot q_2| \)
\[
|q_1 \cdot q_2| = |26.0 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 47.0 \times 10^{-6}| = 26.0 \cdot 47.0 \cdot 10^{-12} = 1222 \cdot 10^{-12} = 1.222 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C^2}
\]

### Step 2: Substitute into Coulomb's law
\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2} \implies r^2 = \frac{k \cdot |q_1 \cdot q_2|}{F}
\]
\[
r^2 = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (1.222 \times 10^{-9})}{5.70}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the numerator
\[
(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (1.222 \times 10^{-9}) = (8.988 \cdot 1.222) \cdot (10^9 \cdot 10^{-9}) = 10.96 \cdot 1 = 10.96
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( r^2 \)
\[
r^2 = \frac{10.96}{5.70} \approx 1.925
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( r \)
\[
r = \sqrt{1.925} \approx 1.387 \, \mathrm{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated distance is approximately \( 1.39 \, \mathrm{m} \), which matches option **D**.
