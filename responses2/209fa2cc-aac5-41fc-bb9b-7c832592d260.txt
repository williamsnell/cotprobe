Okay, so I have this question about calculating the cell voltage under certain conditions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electrochemistry, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The cell is given as Pt/H₂/HCl (0.2M) / HCl (0.8M) / H₂/Pt. So, the two hydrogen electrodes are in different concentrations. I remember that the cell voltage depends on the concentrations of the H+ ions and the hydrogen gas. 

Wait, the concentrations of the hydrogen halides (HCl) are 0.2M and 0.8M. So, the H₂ gas is at 0.2M on one side and 0.8M on the other. Since Pt is inert, it's acting as the inert electrode.

The formula I think I need is the Nernst equation for hydrogen electrodes. Oh, right! The standard hydrogen electrode potential is 0 V. But when it's not standard, the potential changes based on the concentration of H+ and the activity of the hydrogen gas.

The general form is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q), but wait, for hydrogen electrodes, the reaction is 2H+ + 2e⁻ → H₂. Oh wait, but sometimes it's written as H₂(g) + 2e⁻ → 2H+ (aq), but in terms of electrode potential, it's E = (0.0592 / 2) * log([H+]^2) because the reaction quotient Q would be [H+]^2 / P(H₂). 

Wait, but wait, in this case, the cell is Pt as the inert conductor, so one side has H₂ gas at 0.2M and the other at 0.8M. So the two half-reactions would be:

At the anode (oxidation): H₂ → 2H+ + 2e⁻
At the cathode (reduction): 2H+ + 2e⁻ → H₂

But wait, because the concentrations are different, I need to find the potential at each electrode and then find the cell voltage.

Wait, no. The cell is Pt/H₂/HCl (0.2M) and then HCl (0.8M)/H₂/Pt. So the Pt is the inert conductor. So the two H₂ electrodes are at different HCl concentrations.

Wait, the HCl is the acid, so the H+ concentration in each solution is determined by the HCl concentration. Since HCl is a strong acid, the H+ concentration is equal to the HCl concentration.

So, on the left side, the HCl is 0.2M (so [H+] = 0.2 M), and on the right side, it's 0.8M (so [H+] = 0.8 M, but wait, no—that's for the HCl on the right. Wait, no, the HCl on the right is 0.8M, so [H+] there is 0.8 M. But the HCl on the left is 0.2M, so [H+] is 0.2 M.

But wait, the question says the cell is Pt/H₂/HCl (0.2M) / HCl (0.8M) / H₂/Pt. So, the left HCl is 0.2 M (so H+ is 0.2), the right HCl is 0.8 M (H+ is 0.8), and the H₂ is present in both, so each half-cell has H₂ gas in different HCl solutions.

So, the left side is H₂ gas in 0.2 M HCl, and the right side is H₂ gas in 0.8 M HCl. So each H₂ electrode is in a different HCl solution.

Wait, but in the cell, the HCl on the left is 0.2 M, and the right is 0.8 M. So the H+ on the left is 0.2 M, and on the right, it's 0.8 M.

Now, the Pt is the inert conductor, so the H₂ is on both sides.

Wait, but wait, the cell is Pt | H₂ (0.2M HCl) | HCl (0.8M) | H₂ | Pt. So, the left H₂ is in 0.2 M HCl, and the right H₂ is in 0.8 M HCl. So the two H₂ electrodes are in different HCl solutions.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should calculate the potential for each half-cell and then find the cell voltage.

The Nernst equation for a hydrogen electrode is E = (0.0592/2) * log ( [H+]^2 / P_H2 )

Wait, alternatively, sometimes it's written as E = (0.0592/n) * log ( [H+]^n / (P_H2) ) )

Wait, the standard hydrogen electrode is E° = 0 V. When it's not standard, say, when the concentration of H+ is not 1, the potential changes.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the equation for the hydrogen electrode is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log ( [H+]^n / P_H2 )

But wait, in this case, the H2 is on both sides, so each half-cell has its own H+ concentration.

Wait, the left side (H₂ in 0.2 M HCl) has [H+] = 0.2 M.

The right side (H₂ in 0.8 M HCl) has [H+] = 0.8 M.

So, the left half-cell potential (E_left) is: E_left = (0.0592/2) * log( (0.2)^2 / 1 ), because P_H2 is 1 atm (standard pressure), so it's 1.

Similarly, E_right is (0.0592/2) * log( (0.8)^2 / 1 )

Wait, but I'm not sure if the H₂ is at standard pressure on both sides. Wait, the Pt is inert, so the H₂ is gas. So the H₂ is at 1 atm in both sides. So their partial pressures are the same, so 1 M H2 pressure.

Wait, but the cell is Pt | H₂ (0.2 M HCl) | HCl (0.8 M) | H₂ | Pt.

So, the left HCl is 0.2 M, so [H+] is 0.2. The right HCl is 0.8 M, so [H+] is 0.8.

But wait, the hydrogen electrode potential is E = 0.0592/2 * log([H+]^2 / P_H2).

Wait, but [H+] is 0.2 M on one side, 0.8 on the other. So:

E_left = (0.0592/2) * log( (0.2)^2 / 1 )
E_right = (0.0592/2) * log( (0.8)^2 / 1 )

Wait, but wait, because the H₂ is the same on both sides, their activity would be the same (since 1 M H₂ is standard).

So, compute each E:

E_left = (0.0592 / 2) * log(0.04) = (0.0296) * log(0.04)

Log(0.04) is log(4e-2) = log(4) - 2 ≈ 0.60206 - 2 = -1.39794

So E_left ≈ 0.0296 * (-1.39794) ≈ -0.0414 volts.

E_right = (0.0592/2)* log( (0.8)^2 ) = (0.0296) * log(0.64)

Log(0.64) is approximately 0.64 is 6.4 x10^-1. log(6.4)=0.806, so 0.806 -1 = -0.194.

So E_right ≈ 0.0296 * (-0.194) ≈ -0.00574 volts.

So, the left is more negative than the right. So, in the cell, the H+ in the left is 0.2, which is lower than the right's 0.8. So in which direction does the current flow? Because the more negative E means lower E.

Wait, the cell voltage is E_right - E_left.

Wait, no, wait. The cell voltage is the difference between the cathode and anode potentials.

Wait, in a hydrogen fuel cell, the H+ with lower concentration (more H+) would tend to be reduced (cathode), because lower [H+] makes E higher.

Wait, but in this case, the left has lower [H+], so it's more willing to lose electrons (since higher H+ → lower potential). So it's the left electrode.

Wait, let me think again. The left side has [H+] = 0.2, right has [H+] = 0.8.

In hydrogen fuel cells, the H+ with lower concentration is oxidized (since lower E makes it more likely to be oxidized, but I think I might be getting this mixed up).

Wait, in the Nernst equation, a lower E implies a lower tendency to undergo reduction. So, if the left electrode (H₂) has a lower E, then that electrode won't reduce, but since it's the anode, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps I should determine which half-cell is the cathode (reduction) and which is the anode (oxidation).

The E_right is E = -0.0057 V, E_left is E = -0.0414 V. So E_right is higher than E_left, meaning the right side is more positive. Since a higher E means a higher tendency to be reduced, the right side (H₂) is the cathode (reduction) and the left is the anode (oxidation).

So, the cell voltage is E_cathode - E_anode.

E_cathode is E_right = -0.0057 V.

E_anode is E_left = -0.0414 V.

So, cell voltage V = (-0.0057) - (-0.0414) = 0.0357 volts.

Wait, but wait, because the cell voltage is the difference between cathode and anode potentials, but if both are negative, it depends on the actual potentials.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each E as the value, then V = E_right - E_left.

E_right is -0.0057 V, E_left is -0.0414 V.

So, V = (-0.0057) - (-0.0414) = 0.0357 V.

Wait, but wait, the standard hydrogen electrode is E=0 when [H+]=1 and P_H2=1. When [H+] is less than 1, E is negative.

So, the left side (H2/0.2M HCl) has E_left = (0.0592/2) * log( (0.2)^2 ) = (0.0296) * log(0.04) ≈ 0.0296 * (-1.3979) ≈ -0.0414 V.

The right side (H2/0.8M HCl) has E_right = (0.0296) * log(0.64) ≈ 0.0296 * (-0.194) ≈ -0.0057 V.

So, the left electrode (0.2 M HCl) has a lower E (more negative), so it's the anode, and the right (0.8 M HCl) is the cathode.

So, the cell voltage V is E_cathode - E_anode.

E_cathode is -0.0057, E_anode is -0.0414.

So, V = (-0.0057) - (-0.0414) = 0.0357 V.

Looking at the options, 0.0357 is between 0.02 and 0.06. The closest option is E:0.02 or J:0.0012. Wait, no, options are:

A:0.0006  
B:0.3  
C:0.12  
D:0.06  
E:0.02  
F:0.6  
G:0.08  
H:0.006  
I:0.9  
J:0.0012

Wait, I got 0.0357, which is approximately 0.036. The closest option is E:0.02 or J:0.0012. No, wait, J is 0.0012, which is way smaller. So, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the logs because I might have messed up.

Wait, let's recalculate E_left and E_right.

E_left = (0.0592 / 2) * log( (0.2)^2 / 1 )

(0.2)^2 is 0.04. Log(0.04) is log(4x10^-2) = log(4) + log(1e-2) = 0.60206 -2 = -1.39794.

So 0.0296 * (-1.39794) = approximately 0.0296 * (-1.4) ≈ -0.0414 V.

E_right: (0.0592/2) * log( (0.8)^2 ) 

(0.8)^2 is 0.64. Log(0.64) is log(6.4e-1) = 0.806 - 1 = -0.194.

So 0.0296 * (-0.194) = approx 0.0296 * (-0.194) ≈ -0.00573 V.

So, cell voltage V = E_right - E_left (since E_right is cathode, E_left is anode):

So ( -0.00573 ) - ( -0.0414 ) = (-0.00573) + 0.0414 = 0.03567 V.

So approximately 0.0357 V.

Looking at the options, the closest is E:0.02 or J:0.0012. Wait, but 0.0357 is more than 0.02, but less than 0.06. So there's no option exactly 0.0357. But perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the electrodes are both at H2 gas, but with different concentrations. Wait, maybe the cell is Pt | H₂ (0.2 M HCl) | HCl (0.8 M) | H₂ | Pt. So the left HCl is 0.2 M, so H+ is 0.2 M. The right HCl is 0.8 M, H+ is 0.8 M. The Pt is inert.

Wait, perhaps the cell involves the two hydrogen electrodes, and the HCl is not the same on both. So, the two H2 electrodes are in different HCl solutions.

Wait, perhaps the formula for a hydrogen fuel cell is E_cell = E_cathode - E_anode.

E_cathode is the E of the cathode, which is the more positive one.

Earlier, I calculated E_left = -0.0414 V, E_right = -0.0057 V.

So E_cathode is -0.0057 V (right side), E_anode is -0.0414 V (left side). So E_cell = (-0.0057) - (-0.0414) = 0.0357 V, which is approximately 0.036 V.

Hmm, but the options don't have exactly this. The closest is E: 0.02 V (option E) and J is 0.006 V, which is much lower. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the potential.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the cell voltage is E_cathode minus E_anode. So, E_right is cathode (-0.0057) and E_left is anode (-0.0414). So, V = (-0.0057) - (-0.0414) = 0.0357 V.

Looking back at options, the closest is E:0.02 V (option E) but that's lower than our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the potentials were calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Nernst equation correctly. The correct formula is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log ( [H+]^n / P_H2 )

Wait, but n is 2 for each H2. So, the formula per electrode is E = 0 - (0.0592/2) * log( [H+]^2 / P_H2 )

Wait, but in this case, H2 is the same on both sides, so P_H2 is 1 atm. So each E is:

E_left = 0 - (0.0592/2) * log( (0.2)^2 )
= - (0.0296) * log(0.04)
= -0.0296 * (-1.3979)
= approx +0.0414 V.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, E is calculated as E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q), where Q is [H+]^2 / P_H2.

Wait, but E° is 0, so E = - (0.0592/2) * log( (0.2)^2 )

So, log(0.04) is about -1.39794.

So, E_left = - (0.0296) * (-1.39794) = 0.0296 * 1.39794 ≈ 0.0414 V.

Similarly, E_right = - (0.0296) * log(0.64) = -0.0296 * (-0.194) ≈ 0.00573 V.

So, now, the E_left is 0.0414 V, E_right is 0.00573 V.

Wait, but in the cell, the anode is the one with lower E, so E_anode is 0.00573 V, and E_cathode is 0.0414 V.

So, the cell voltage is E_cathode - E_anode = 0.0414 - 0.00573 = 0.0357 V.

Still, this is approximately 0.036 V. Looking at the options:

A: 0.0006 V  
B: 0.3 V  
C: 0.12 V  
D:0.06 V  
E:0.02 V  
F:0.6 V  
G:0.08 V  
H:0.006 V  
I:0.9 V  
J:0.0012 V  

So, 0.036 is closest to E:0.02 V, but it's actually higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Nernst equation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the formula for a hydrogen fuel cell, which is E = E_cathode - E_anode.

In this case, the cathode is the one with higher E, so it's the right side (E=0.0414 V), and the anode is the left side (E=0.00573 V).

So, cell voltage is 0.0414 - 0.00573 = 0.03567 V, which is approximately 0.036 V.

But looking at the options, the closest is E (0.02 V) and H (0.006 V). H is much lower than 0.02, so it's not. So, the correct answer would be E: 0.02 V? But that's only 0.02, but our calculation is 0.036, which is about 0.04.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the potential for each half-cell, then subtract the potentials.

Wait, the left side is Pt | H2 | HCl (0.2 M). The HCl is 0.2 M, so [H+] is 0.2 M.

The right side is Pt | H2 | HCl (0.8 M). [H+] is 0.8 M.

The Nernst equation for the left is E_left = 0 - (0.0592/2) log( (0.2)^2 / 1 )

Which is E_left = - (0.0296) * log(0.04 )

log(0.04)= -1.39794

So, E_left = -0.0296 * (-1.39794) = 0.0414 V.

Similarly, E_right = 0 - (0.0296) * log( (0.8)^2 /1 )

log(0.64) = -0.1946

So, E_right = 0.0296 * 0.1946 = approx 0.00574 V.

So, the cell voltage is E_right - E_left = 0.00574 - 0.0414 = -0.03566 V.

Wait, but voltage can't be negative. So, it's the absolute value. So, |E_right - E_left| = 0.03566 V.

Which is approximately 0.036 V.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is not present. But wait, perhaps I missed a step.

Wait, the cell potential is E_cell = E_cathode - E_anode.

In this case, E_right is the cathode, so E_cathode = 0.00574 V.

E_left is the anode, so E_anode = 0.0414 V.

So, E_cell = 0.00574 - 0.0414 = -0.03566 V.

But since the cell potential is the absolute value, it's 0.03566 V.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the closest is E:0.02 V (option E).

But 0.03566 is approximately 0.036 V, which is not any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the potentials using exact log values.

Let me compute E_left and E_right more accurately.

E_left:

E_left = 0 - (0.0592/2) * log(0.2^2 )

0.2^2 = 0.04.

log(0.04) = log(4 x 10^-2 ) = log(4) + log(10^-2) = 0.60206 -2 = -1.39794.

So, E_left = -0.0296 * (-1.39794) = 0.0296 * 1.39794.

Compute 0.0296 * 1.39794:

0.0296 * 1 = 0.0296.

0.0296 * 0.39794 ≈ 0.0296 * 0.4 ≈ 0.01184.

So total is approximately 0.0296 + 0.01184 = 0.04144 V.

Similarly, E_right:

E_right = 0 - (0.0592/2) * log(0.8^2 )

0.8^2 = 0.64.

log(0.64) = log(6.4 x 10^-1 ) = log(6.4) + log(10^-1 ) = 0.806 -1 = -0.194.

So, E_right = - (0.0296) * (-0.194) = 0.0296 * 0.194.

Compute 0.0296 * 0.194:

0.0296 * 0.1 = 0.00296.

0.0296 * 0.09 = 0.002664.

0.0296 * 0.004 = 0.0001184.

So total is 0.00296 + 0.002664 = 0.005624 + 0.0001184 ≈ 0.0057424 V.

So, E_right ≈ 0.00574 V.

So, E_cathode = E_right = 0.00574 V.

E_anode = E_left = 0.04144 V.

E_cell = E_right - E_left = 0.00574 - 0.04144 = -0.0357 V.

But voltage can’t be negative. So the cell voltage is the absolute value, 0.0357 V.

Looking at the options, the closest is E:0.02 V (option E), but that's only 0.02, which is less than 0.0357. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula E = E° - (0.0592/n) log(Q), where Q is [H+]^n / P_H2.

In this case, Q for each electrode is [H+]^2 / P_H2.

So, E_left = 0 - (0.0592/2) log( (0.2)^2 / 1 ) = -0.0296 * log(0.04).

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, let me think about the cell voltage again. Since the left side is the anode and the right side is the cathode, the cell potential is cathode - anode, which is positive.

So, E_cell = E_right - E_left = 0.00574 V - 0.04144 V = -0.0357 V.

So, the absolute cell voltage is 0.0357 V.

Now, looking at the options, the closest is E:0.02 V. But 0.02 is lower than 0.0357.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual formula uses E = E° - (0.0592/n) log(Q), where Q is [H+]^n / P_H2, and for this calculation, perhaps I'm missing a negative.

Wait, I think I may have mixed up the sign in the Nernst equation.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is E = E° - (0.0592/n) log(Q), but Q is [H+]^n / P_H2, and if [H+] is less than 1, then log(Q) is negative, so E becomes higher than E°.

Wait, in this problem, the left electrode has [H+]=0.2 M, which is less than 1. So, log(Q) is negative, so E becomes higher than E°.

Wait, but in this case, the left electrode is the anode, so E_anode is lower than E°, and the right is cathode, E_cathode higher than E°.

So, cell voltage is E_cathode - E_anode.

So, let's calculate E_anode and E_cathode.

E_anode (left electrode) is E° - (0.0592/2) log(0.2^2) = 0 - (0.0296) * log(0.04).

log(0.04) is -1.39794.

So, E_anode = 0.0296 * 1.39794 ≈ 0.04144 V.

E_cathode (right electrode) is E° - (0.0592/2) log(0.8^2) = 0 - (0.0296) * log(0.64).

log(0.64) is -0.1946.

So, E_cathode = 0.0296 * 0.1946 ≈ 0.00574 V.

So, cell voltage is E_cathode - E_anode = 0.00574 - 0.04144 = -0.0357 V.

Taking the absolute value, 0.0357 V.

Looking back at the options, there's no 0.0357 V. The closest is E:0.02 V, which is 0.02 V. But 0.02 is way less than 0.0357.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of log(0.64).

Because 0.64 is 6.4 x 10^-1, so log(0.64) = log(6.4) + log(10^-1) = 0.806 -1 = -0.194.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate log(0.64) more accurately.

Using a calculator: log(0.64) is approximately -0.19385.

So, E_cathode = 0.0296 * 0.19385 ≈ 0.00573 V.

Similarly, E_anode: log(0.04) = -1.39794.

E_anode = 0.0296 * 1.39794 ≈ 0.04144 V.

So, cell voltage is 0.00573 - 0.04144 = -0.03571 V.

Absolute value is 0.03571 V.

Looking at the options, the closest would be E:0.02 V. But that's only 0.02, which is less than 0.0357.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q), where Q is [H+]^n / P_H2.

So, for each electrode, E = E° - (0.0592/2) * log( [H+]^2 / P_H2 )

In this case, the left electrode is Pt | H2 | HCl (0.2 M).

So, Q_left = (0.2)^2 / 1 = 0.04.

Similarly, Q_right = (0.8)^2 / 1 = 0.64.

So, E_left = 0 - (0.0296) * log(0.04) = 0.0296 * (-1.39794) = -0.04144 V.

E_right = 0 - (0.0296) * log(0.64) = 0.0296 * (-0.19385) = -0.00573 V.

Wait, but that can't be right because the cell voltage should be positive.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. If the formula is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q), then the cell voltage is E_cathode - E_anode.

So, E_anode is the lower potential, E_cathode is higher.

E_anode (left) = 0 - (0.0592/2) * log(0.04) = 0.0296 * 1.39794 ≈ 0.04144 V.

E_cathode (right) = 0 - (0.0592/2) * log(0.64) = 0.0296 * 0.19385 ≈ 0.00573 V.

But then, E_cathode is lower than E_anode, which can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the potentials using the Nernst equation as follows:

E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q)

Where Q is ([H+]^n ) / P_H2

So, for each electrode:

E = 0 - (0.0592/2) * log( ([H+]^2 ) / P_H2 )

So, for the left electrode (HCl 0.2 M):

log(Q) = log( (0.2)^2 / 1 ) = log(0.04) = -1.39794

E_left = 0 - (0.0296) * (-1.39794) = 0 + 0.0296 * 1.39794 ≈ 0.04144 V.

For the right electrode (HCl 0.8 M):

log(Q) = log( (0.8)^2 / 1 ) = log(0.64) = -0.19385

E_right = 0 - (0.0296) * (-0.19385) = 0 + 0.0296 * 0.19385 ≈ 0.00573 V.

So, E_left = 0.04144 V, E_right = 0.00573 V.

So, the cell voltage is E_right - E_anode, but wait, E_anode is the anode potential, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps the cell voltage is E_cathode - E_anode.

So, E_cathode is 0.00573 V, E_anode is 0.04144 V.

Wait, then cell voltage would be 0.00573 - 0.04144 = -0.03571 V.

But this can't be correct, because cell voltage can't be negative. So, I must have mixed up the cathode and anode.

Wait, the cathode is the site of reduction, so higher potential. The anode is where oxidation occurs.

So, in this setup, the left electrode (HCl 0.2 M) has a higher potential than the right electrode (HCl 0.8 M), so the right electrode is the anode, and the left is the cathode.

So, E_cathode = E_left = 0.04144 V.

E_anode = E_right = 0.00573 V.

So, cell voltage is E_cathode - E_anode = 0.04144 - 0.00573 = 0.03571 V.

Ah, there we go. So, the cell voltage is approximately 0.0357 V.

Looking at the options, the closest is E:0.02 V, which is 0.02 V. But that's lower than 0.0357.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E:0.02 V, but I think there's a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the correct option is E:0.02 V.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the cell voltage is approximately 0.0357 V, which is about 0.036 V. But looking at the options, the closest is E:0.02 V.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the potentials more accurately.

E_left = 0 - (0.0592/2) * log( (0.2)^2 )

(0.2)^2 = 0.04.

log(0.04) = log(4 x 10^-2) = log(4) + log(10^-2) = 0.60206 - 2 = -1.39794.

E_left = 0 - (0.0296) * (-1.39794) = 0 + (0.0296 * 1.39794).

Compute 0.0296 * 1.39794:

Let me compute 0.0296 * 1.39794.

First, 0.0296 * 1 = 0.0296.

0.0296 * 0.39794 = ?

Compute 0.0296 * 0.39794:

0.0296 * 0.3 = 0.00888.

0.0296 * 0.09 = 0.002664.

0.0296 * 0.00794 = approximately 0.000235.

So, total is 0.00888 + 0.002664 = 0.011544 + 0.000235 = 0.011779.

So, 0.0296 * 0.39794 ≈ 0.011779.

Adding to 0.0296 * 1: 0.0296 + 0.011779 = 0.041379 V.

Similarly, E_right = 0 - (0.0592/2) * log( (0.8)^2 ).

(0.8)^2 = 0.64.

log(0.64) = log(6.4 x 10^-1) = log(6.4) + log(10^-1) = 0.8062 - 1 = -0.1938.

E_right = 0 - (0.0296) * (-0.1938) = 0 + (0.0296 * 0.1938).

Compute 0.0296 * 0.1938.

0.0296 * 0.1 = 0.00296.

0.0296 * 0.09 = 0.002664.

0.0296 * 0.0038 = 0.00011368.

So, total is 0.00296 + 0.002664 = 0.005624 + 0.00011368 = 0.00573768 V.

So, E_left ≈ 0.041379 V.

E_right ≈ 0.005738 V.

So, cell voltage is E_right - E_anode (E_anode is the anode potential, which is lower).

Wait, no, the cell voltage is E_cathode - E_anode.

So, E_cathode is 0.041379 V.

E_anode is 0.005738 V.

So, cell voltage is 0.041379 - 0.005738 = 0.035641 V.

So, approximately 0.0356 V.

Looking at the options, the closest is E:0.02 V, but that's only 0.02 V. Wait, but 0.0356 is closer to 0.036, but there's no option for that.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me try another approach.

Compute the potentials using the formula E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q).

E_left = 0 - (0.0592/2) * log( (0.2)^2 / 1 )

= 0 - (0.0296) * log(0.04)

= 0 - 0.0296 * (-1.39794)

= 0 + 0.0296 * 1.39794.

Compute 0.0296 * 1.39794.

0.0296 * 1 = 0.0296.

0.0296 * 0.39794 = 0.01177.

So, total is 0.0296 + 0.01177 = 0.04137.

E_left ≈ 0.0414 V.

E_right = 0 - (0.0592/2) * log( (0.8)^2 / 1 )

= 0 - 0.0296 * log(0.64)

= 0 - 0.0296 * (-0.1938)

= 0 + (0.0296 * 0.1938)

= 0 + 0.00574 V.

So, E_right ≈ 0.0057 V.

So, cell voltage is 0.0414 V - 0.0057 V = 0.0357 V.

So, approximately 0.0357 V.

Looking at the options, the closest is E:0.02 V.

But I'm a bit confused because my calculation gives 0.0357 V, which is about 0.036 V, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the cell voltage is positive, so the correct answer is E:0.02 V.

But I'm not entirely confident because my calculation shows 0.0357 V, which is closer to 0.036 V, but there's no option for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E:0.02 V.

I think I'll go with E:0.02 V.
</think>

To determine the cell voltage, we use the Nernst equation:

\[
E = E^\circ - \frac{0.0592}{n} \log(Q)
\]

Where:
- \(E^\circ = 0 \, \text{V}\) (since it's a reference electrode),
- \(n = 2\) (since it's a hydrogen electrode),
- \(Q = \frac{[H+]^2}{P_{\text{H}_2}}\),
- For the left electrode (HCl 0.2 M), \([H+] = 0.2 \, \text{M}\),
- For the right electrode (HCl 0.8 M), \([H+] = 0.8 \, \text{M}\).

### Step 1: Calculate \(Q\) for each electrode

For the left electrode (HCl 0.2 M):
\[
Q_{\text{left}} = \frac{(0.2)^2}{1} = 0.04
\]

For the right electrode (HCl 0.8 M):
\[
Q_{\text{right}} = \frac{(0.8)^2}{1} = 0.64
\]

### Step 2: Apply the Nernst equation

#### For the left electrode (HCl 0.2 M):
\[
E_{\text{left}} = 0 - \frac{0.0592}{2} \log(0.04)
\]
\[
\log(0.04) = -1.39794
\]
\[
E_{\text{left}} = 0 - (0.0296) \times (-1.39794) = 0.04144 \, \text{V}
\]

#### For the right electrode (HCl 0.8 M):
\[
E_{\text{right}} = 0 - \frac{0.0592}{2} \log(0.64)
\]
\[
\log(0.64) = -0.1938
\]
\[
E_{\text{right}} = 0 - (0.0296) \times (-0.1938) = 0.00574 \, \text{V}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the cell voltage

The cell voltage is given by:
\[
E_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{cathode}} - E_{\text{anode}}
\]

Here:
- \(E_{\text{anode}}\) is the potential of the anode (right electrode, HCl 0.8 M): \(0.00574 \, \text{V}\),
- \(E_{\text{cathode}}\) is the potential of the cathode (left electrode, HCl 0.2 M): \(0.04144 \, \text{V}\).

\[
E_{\text{cell}} = 0.04144 - 0.00574 = 0.0357 \, \text{V}
\]

### Final Answer:
The cell voltage is approximately \(0.0357 \, \text{V}\), which is closest to option **E: 0.02 V**.
