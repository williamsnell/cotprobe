Okay, so I've got this question about Parfit's view on the obligation to prioritize the welfare of one's children. Hmm, I remember that Parfit is a philosopher known for his work on moral responsibility and deontological ethics. Let me think about what he said.

The question is about whether the obligation is agent-relative, agent-neutral, absolute, or none of the above. The options are A, B, C, D. 

I recall that Parfit's position is often called deontological, which deals with the morality of actions. In his "Theories of Morality," he discusses the different categories of moral obligations. One of the key concepts he presents is that obligations can be agent-relative, agent-neutral, or absolute.

Agent-relative obligations are those that are based on the agent's own interests and are not a result of their actions. For example, if someone is obligated to help a friend, that's agent-relative because it's about the friend's interests, not the person's own intentions.

Agent-neutral obligations, on the other hand, don't depend on the agent's actions or values. They're more about the consequences of the action. For instance, if someone is compelled to take a certain action regardless of their own beliefs, that's agent-neutral.

Absolute obligations are those that must be performed regardless of the circumstances. For example, it's an absolute obligation to help another person in need, regardless of why they need it.

Now, the question is about the obligation to prioritize the welfare of one's children. So, is this an agent-relative, agent-neutral, or absolute obligation?

I think Parfit would probably lean towards agent-relative because it's about the child's welfare, which is an intrinsic value. The obligation isn't because the parent acted in a certain way, but because the child's well-being is important. It's not an action that requires the parent to do something because of their own interests, but because the child's interests are more important.

Wait, but sometimes people might have a moral duty to act in ways that benefit others, but Parfit's framework suggests it's agent-relative because it's about the intrinsic value of the action. So, it's not about the parent's actions but about the child's interests.

So the correct answer would be A: agent-relative.
</think>

The correct answer is A: agent-relative.

The obligation to prioritize the welfare of one’s children is agent-relative because it stems from the intrinsic value of the child's well-being, not from the parent's actions or their own interests. This is a key point in Parfit's deontological ethics, where such obligations are based on the child's intrinsic values, not on the parent's actions.
