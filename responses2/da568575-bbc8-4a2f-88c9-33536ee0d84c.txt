Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that a current of 5.36 A is passed through an electro-lytic cell with a zinc salt solution. After 30 minutes, 3.27 grams of zinc is deposited at the cathode. I need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt. Oh right, I remember that in electrolysis, especially for metals, the concept of equivalents comes into play.

Wait, the key formula I think is related to the amount of substance deposited. Oh yeah, Faraday's laws of electrolysis are probably involved here. Faraday's laws state that the amount of substance deposited is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the solution. Oh right, the formula is mass equals equivalent weight multiplied by the amount of electricity.

So, the formula is: 
Mass (g) = Equivalent weight × (Charge (C))

Charge is calculated as current (A) multiplied by time (seconds). Oh wait, the time is given in minutes, so I need to convert that. 30 minutes is 30 * 60 = 1800 seconds.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The current is 5.36 A. So the total charge passed is 5.36 A * 1800 s. Let me calculate that: 5.36 * 1800. Let me compute that. 5 * 1800 is 9000, 0.36*1800 is 648, so total is 9000 + 648 = 9648 C.

So the charge passed is 9648 coulombs.

Now, the mass of zinc deposited is 3.27 grams. So according to the formula, mass equals equivalent weight multiplied by charge. So, equivalent weight = mass / charge.

Wait, so that would be 3.27 g / 9648 C. Let me compute that. Hmm, 3.27 divided by 9648.

Wait, let me compute that. Let me think, 3.27 / 9648. Let's see, 9648 is a big number. Let's approximate.

Well, 9648 is approximately 9600. 3.27 / 9600. Let me compute that as a decimal. 

3.27 / 9600. Well, 3.27 divided by 9600 is 0.000337875 grams per Coulomb.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because I know the equivalent weight of zinc is about 65.38 g/mol. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Because the formula is mass = equivalent weight * charge. So rearranged, equivalent weight = mass / charge. Oh wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check.

So, the formula is correct. So, E = m / Q. So E = 3.27 g / 9648 C.

Wait, 3.27 divided by 9648. Let me compute this more accurately. 

Let me compute 9648 into 3.27: 9648 is 9.648e3. So 3.27 /9648 = ?

Well, 9648 is 9648 grams per Coulomb. Wait, no, wait, the units here are grams per coulomb. Oh, wait, no, because the charge is in coulombs, and the mass is grams, so the equivalent weight is (grams)/(Coulombs), which is grams per Coulomb.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula is mass = equivalent weight * charge. So equivalent weight = mass / charge.

So E = 3.27 g / 9648 C = ?

Let me compute that. 3.27 divided by 9648.

Let me see, 9648 is approximately 9600. So 3.27 / 9600 = 0.0003375.

Wait, but wait, 9648 is about 9648, so 3.27 /9648 = ?

Let me compute 3.27 / 9648.

Let me compute it step by step. 

3.27 divided by 9648 = ?

Well, 9648 is 9,648. Let me write it as 9,648 = 9.648 x 1e3.

3.27 / 9648 = 3.27 / (9.648e3) = (3.27 /9.648) * 1e-3.

Wait, 3.27 /9.648 is approximately 0.338 (since 9.648 * 0.338 ≈ 3.258, which is close to 3.27). So 0.338 * 1e-3 is 0.000338 g/C. Wait, but wait, the units are grams per Coulomb, which is the same as grams per mole divided by the charge (in moles). Wait, no, the equivalent weight is the gram per equivalent, so perhaps I should think in terms of moles as well.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Oh, wait, another approach. The equivalent weight of a metal is molar mass divided by its valency. So, for zinc, Zn, the valency is +2. So the equivalent weight is molar mass / 2.

Wait, the molar mass of Zn is about 65.38 g/mol. So 65.38 / 2 = 32.69 grams per equivalent. Let me see, that's about 32.7 g/eq.

Wait, but if the calculated equivalent weight is 32.7 g/eq, then that's option F. But wait, the question is about what is the equivalent weight in the salt. So in the solution, the zinc is in a salt, so the equivalent weight would be the molar mass divided by the valency.

Wait, so the formula is equivalent weight = molar mass / valency.

Valency of Zn is 2, so 65.38 /2 = 32.69, which is approximately 32.7 g per equivalent. So that would make the answer F:32.7g.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the equivalent weight was 3.27g / 9648 C. Let me compute that more accurately.

So, 3.27 grams divided by 9648 Coulombs.

So, 3.27 /9648 = ?

Let me compute 3.27 /9648.

First, 9648 is 9648. Let me compute 9648 into 3.27.

Wait, 9648 * 0.000338 is approximately 3.27.

Wait, 9648 * 0.0003378 = 3.27.

So the equivalent weight is approximately 0.3378 g/C. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the units are grams per Coulomb, but the options are in grams per equivalent. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula again. Oh, wait, the formula is mass (g) = equivalent weight (g/eq) * charge (C). So we can rearrange equivalent weight as mass / charge.

So, the charge is 5.36 A * 30*60 s = 5.36 * 1800 = 9648 C.

So, equivalent weight is 3.27g / 9648 C.

Let me compute that.

3.27 divided by 9648 is equal to (3.27 /9648) = 0.0003375 g/C.

But wait, that's grams per Coulomb. Hmm, but the question is asking for the equivalent weight of the zinc in the salt. The equivalent weight is molar mass divided by the valency.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the charge is the total charge passed, which is 5.36 * 1800, but perhaps I should be considering the charge per mole.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it using the formula: moles = charge (C) / (n * F), but wait, that's the electrolysis equation.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the moles of electrons and then relate that to the moles of zinc deposited, which would then give the equivalent weight.

Wait, so the number of moles of electrons is Q/(F), where F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol e-).

So, Q is 9648 C. So moles of electrons = 9648 / 96485 ≈ 0.1000 mol.

Wait, wait, wait, 9648 / 96485 is about 0.1000 mol e-.

Since for Zn, the reaction is Zn → Zn²+ + 2e-. So each mole of Zn requires 2 moles of electrons.

So the moles of Zn deposited would be moles of electrons / 2.

So moles Zn = 0.1 mol e- / 2 = 0.05 mol.

The mass of Zn deposited is 3.27g. So, the molar mass of Zn is 65.38 g/mol. So, moles Zn = 3.27 /65.38 ≈ 0.05 (since 65.38 * 0.05 = 3.269, which is close to 3.27). So, this confirms that 0.05 moles of Zn.

The moles of electrons is 0.1 mol, so each mole of Zn requires 2 moles of electrons. So, the equivalent weight is (molar mass) / (valency) = 65.38 /2 =32.69g/eq. So, the equivalent weight is approximately 32.7 g per equivalent, which is option F.

To determine the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt, we use the relationship between mass, charge, and equivalent weight. The formula is:

\[
\text{Mass (g)} = \text{Equivalent weight (g/eq)} \times \text{Charge (C)}
\]

Rearranging for equivalent weight:

\[
\text{Equivalent weight (g/eq)} = \frac{\text{Mass (g)}}{\text{Charge (C)}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the total charge passed
The current is 5.36 A, and the time is 30 minutes. Converting time to seconds:

\[
30 \, \text{minutes} = 30 \times 60 = 1800 \, \text{seconds}
\]

The total charge passed is:

\[
Q = I \times t = 5.36 \, \text{A} \times 1800 \, \text{s} = 9648 \, \text{C}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the equivalent weight of zinc
The mass of zinc deposited is 3.27 g. Using the formula:

\[
\text{Equivalent weight (g/eq)} = \frac{3.27 \, \text{g}}{9648 \, \text{C}}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\text{Equivalent weight (g/eq)} = \frac{3.27}{9648} \approx 0.0003375 \, \text{g/C}
\]

However, this result is in grams per Coulomb. To convert to grams per equivalent, we note that the equivalent weight of zinc is related to its molar mass and valency. Zinc has a valency of +2, so the equivalent weight is:

\[
\text{Equivalent weight (g/eq)} = \frac{\text{Molar mass (g/mol)}}{\text{Valency}} = \frac{65.38 \, \text{g/mol}}{2} = 32.69 \, \text{g/eq}
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The calculated equivalent weight of zinc is approximately 32.7 g/eq, which matches option **F: 32.7 g**.
