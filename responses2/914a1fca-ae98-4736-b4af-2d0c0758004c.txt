Okay, so I've got this question here about whether certain sets of 2x2 matrices form groups under multiplication. Let's see, the question has two statements, and I need to decide if each is true or false. Then, match them with the options given.

First, I'll tackle Statement 1: The set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant is a group under matrix multiplication. Hmm, I remember that for a set to be a group under an operation, it needs to satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses.

Closure: When I multiply two matrices with integer entries, the result should also have integer entries. I think that's true because matrix multiplication involves adding and multiplying integers. So, yes, the product will have integer entries.

Associativity: Matrix multiplication is associative, right? So that's definitely true.

Identity element: The identity matrix for 2x2 is [[1,0],[0,1]]. Its determinant is 1, which is non-zero. So this identity matrix is in the set. That's good.

Inverses: For a matrix to have an inverse in the set, its determinant must be non-zero because the inverse of a matrix is 1 over the determinant. But wait, the set in Statement 1 requires the determinant to be non-zero. So any matrix with a determinant that's a non-zero integer will have an inverse with a determinant of 1/det. But the inverse matrix would require that the determinant is also an integer only if the original determinant's reciprocal is an integer. Otherwise, the inverse matrix would have fractional entries, which are not integers. So, for example, consider a matrix with determinant 2. Its inverse would have 1/2, which isn't an integer. So the inverse matrix would not have integer entries, meaning it's not in the set. Therefore, this set doesn't contain inverses for all elements. So Statement 1's set isn't a group under multiplication because it lacks inverses.

Now, Statement 2: The set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is a group under multiplication. Let's check the group properties here.

Closure: If I multiply two 2x2 integer matrices with determinant 1, will the product also have determinant 1? I think that's true because the determinant of a product is the product of determinants. So if both have determinant 1, their product has determinant 1*1=1.

Associativity: Same as before, matrix multiplication is associative.

Identity element: The identity matrix [[1,0],[0,1]] has a determinant of 1, so it's in the set. That's good.

Inverses: For any matrix in the set, its inverse has a determinant of 1/(det) which is 1/1, so 1. So the inverse matrix will have entries that are fractions. Wait, but does that inverse matrix have integer entries? No, because the inverse's entries are 1/(det_ij) where det_ij is the determinant of the minor matrix. For example, for a matrix [[a, b],[c, d]], the inverse is (1/(ad-bc)) * [[d, -b],[-c, a]]. So if ad-bc is 1, the inverse would be [[d, -b], [-c, a]], which are all integers because a, b, c, d are integers. So yes, the inverse is in the set. So every element has an inverse within the set.

Therefore, Statement 2's set is indeed a group.

So the first statement is false (because their inverses aren't in the set) and the second statement is true. Looking at the options, option D says False, True. Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, Statement 1 is false because not all matrices in the set have inverses within the set. Statement 2 is true because all their inverses are in the set. So the answer should be D: False, True.

The analysis shows that Statement 1 is false because not all matrices in the set have inverses within the set, while Statement 2 is true. Therefore, the correct option is D: False, True.

Answer: D
