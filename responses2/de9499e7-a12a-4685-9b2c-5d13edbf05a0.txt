Okay, so I've got this question about the shift in Greek philosophers' views on the divine. Let me think through this. The question is asking when the major shift happened where Greek philosophers rejected the anthropomorphic view of the divine. 

I remember that anthropomorphic means "human-looking" or "resembling humans." So, the idea that the divine was a being like humans was a big point of contention. I think this shift happened around the time of the Pythagoreanism or perhaps other early Greek philosophies.

I recall that the Pythagorean school, led by Pythagoras, saw the universe as a mathematical one, and they believed in numbers and ratios. Oh wait, but that might be a different shift. Wait, no, the question is about rejecting anthropomorphic views. So maybe it's something else.

Oh right! The early Greek philosophers, especially the ones around the time of Plato and Aristotle, had different views. I remember that the Greek pre-Socratic philosophers, like Socrates, had their own views, but the shift in rejecting the anthropomorphic divine comes from earlier periods.

Wait, the major shift was around the time of the Pythagoreans and maybe the pre-Socratic philosophers. Alternatively, I think it was during the classical Greek period, perhaps around the Second or Third Century BCE.

Wait, the question is about when the shift happened. The options include early Second and First Century BCE, so probably around the time of the early Second Century BCE, like the time of the Pythagorean school.

Wait, the early Second Century BCE. So the answer would be B: Late Second Century BCE. Wait, no, wait. The options are labeled as "Late" and "Early." So "Late Second Century BCE" might be the correct one.

Wait, another angle: I think the shift happened during the early Second Century BCE. The major shift was when the Greek philosophers began to move away from the anthropomorphic view. Because around that time, the Pythagoreans started to see the world as mathematical and abstract, not necessarily human-like. So their belief in the divine as a mathematical entity was different from the human-like view.

So that would correspond to the time of the early Second Century BCE. So the answer is B: Late Second Century BCE. Or wait, maybe the options are labeled as "Late" and "Early." Looking back, the options are:

A: Late Sixth Century BCE
B: Late Second Century BCE
C: Early Fifth Century BCE
D: Late Fourth Century BCE
E: Early First Century BCE
F: Early Third Century BCE
G: Fourth and Third Century BCE
H: Mid Seventh Century BCE
I: Early Sixth Century BCE
J: Second and First Century BCE

So if the shift happened around the early Second Century BCE, that would be option B: Late Second Century BCE? Or maybe "Early Second" is correct. Wait, no, the options are labeled as "Late" or "Early." So I think the correct answer is B: Late Second Century BCE.

Wait, but another point: I remember that the shift in rejecting anthropomorphic views came around the time of the Pythagorean thought. The Pythagoreans saw the divine as a mathematical entity, which was different from human-like. So maybe that was around the early Second Century BCE.

So putting it all together, the answer is B.

The major shift in Greek philosophers' views, where they rejected the anthropomorphic view of the divine, occurred around the early Second Century BCE. This shift was due to the Pythagorean school's belief in the universe as a mathematical entity rather than resembling humans. 

Answer: B
