Question:

Random variable X is normally distributed, with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 4. Which of the following is the approximate interquartile range for this distribution?

Options:

A: 2.00(25.00) = 50.00
B: 25.00 ÷ 4.00 = 6.25
C: 25.00 + 22.30 = 47.30
D: 2.00(4.00) = 8.00
E: 27.70 – 25.00 = 2.70
F: 27.70 – 22.30 = 5.40
G: 27.70 + 22.30 = 50.00
H: 27.70 ÷ 22.30 = 1.24
I: 4.00^2 = 16.00
J: 25.00 – 22.30 = 2.70

Okay, so I've got this question about a normally distributed random variable X with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 4. The question is asking about the interquartile range (IQR). I remember that the IQR is the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile, right?

Wait, but how do I calculate that? Hmm, I think the IQR relates to the standard deviation. Oh right, in a normal distribution, the IQR is about 1.35 times the standard deviation. Or wait, wait. Maybe it's easier to use the z-scores for the 25th and 75th percentiles.

The 25th percentile corresponds to a z-score of approximately -0.6745, and the 75th is around +0.6745. Because in a standard normal distribution, the 25th percentile is at -0.6745 standard deviations below the mean, and the 75th is +0.6745 above. So to find the actual values, I can use these z-scores.

So, the formula for the z-score is (X - μ)/σ. So for the lower quartile (25th percentile), we have:

X_lower = μ + z_lower * σ
X_upper = μ + z_upper * σ

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The 25th percentile is the value where 25% of the data is below it, so in terms of z-scores, it's below the mean by 0.6745. So the lower quartile is μ - (0.6745 * σ), and the upper quartile is μ + (0.6745 * σ).

So, plugging in the numbers: μ is 25, σ is 4.

Lower quartile: 25 - (0.6745 *4) = 25 - 2.698 ≈ 22.30 (since 0.6745 *4 = 2.698)
Upper quartile: 25 + 2.698 ≈27.698

So the IQR is the difference between these two: 27.698 -22.30 ≈5.398, which is approximately 5.40.

Looking at the options, option F is 27.70 – 22.30 =5.40. So that should be the right answer.

Wait, but what other options are there? Let me check the options again.

Option C:25 +22.30=47.30. Hmm, that's the upper quartile. That's not the IQR.

Option E: 27.70 –25.00= 2.70. That's the upper 25% of the distribution, but IQR is more than that.

Option G:27.70 +22.30=50.00. That's the upper quartile plus the mean, which doesn't make sense for the IQR.

Option D:4.00^2= 16.00. That's variance, not IQR.

Wait, but the IQR is about 5.40, which is option F.

Option H:27.70 ÷ 22.30=1.24. That's a ratio, not related to IQR.

Option I:4.00 squared is 16, which is variance, not IQR.

Option J:25.00 –22.30=2.70. That's the lower quartile, not the IQR.

So the correct answer is option F: 27.70 –22.30 =5.40.

The interquartile range (IQR) for a normally distributed random variable is calculated as the difference between the 75th percentile (upper quartile) and the 25th percentile (lower quartile). Using the z-scores for these percentiles (±0.6745 from the mean), the IQR is computed as follows:

- Mean (μ) = 25, Standard Deviation (σ) = 4  
- Lower Quartile: μ - (0.6745 * σ) = 25 - 2.698 = 22.30  
- Upper Quartile: μ + (0.6745 * σ) = 25 + 2.698 = 27.698  
- IQR: 27.698 - 22.30 = 5.398 ≈ 5.40  

From the options provided, the correct calculation is **F: 27.70 – 22.30 = 5.40**.
