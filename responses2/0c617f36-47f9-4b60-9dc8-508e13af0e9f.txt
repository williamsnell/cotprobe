Alright, so I've got this accounting question here about the times-interest-earned ratio. Hmm, I remember that this ratio measures a company's ability to meet its interest obligations. The formula, if I recall correctly, is EBIT divided by interest expense. Or wait, sometimes it's calculated using EBITDA instead. Oh wait, no, for times-interest-earned, it's EBIT divided by interest. But wait, sometimes people calculate it as earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by interest. But wait, in this question, the given information includes interest expense. 

Let me read the question again. The company has income after tax of $5.4 million, interest expense of $1 million, depreciation expense of $1 million, and a 40% tax rate. We need to find the TIE ratio. 

Wait, the TIE ratio is calculated as EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) divided by interest expense. But in this case, we're given after-tax income, interest, and another expense (depreciation). Wait, maybe I should compute EBIT first.

Wait, the income after tax is given as $5.4 million. So, let's think about the tax portion. The tax rate is 40%, which means that the tax is 40% of the income after tax. So, let's compute the tax expense first.

Tax expense = 40% of $5.4 million. 0.4 * 5.4 = 2.16 million. So the income before tax (EBT) would be after-tax income plus tax expense. So EBT is 5.4 + 2.16 = 7.56 million.

Wait, but EBT is EBIT minus interest expense. Because EBT is EBIT minus interest and taxes. Wait, no. Let me think. Let me write this down step by step.

Given:

Income after tax = $5.4 million.

Interest expense = $1 million.

Depreciation expense = $1 million.

Tax rate = 40%.

So, the company's income before tax (EBT) is calculated by adding back the interest and taxes. Wait, wait, no. Alternatively, EBT is income after tax plus interest and taxes. Wait, no—I think I'm getting this mixed up. Let me clarify.

EBT (Earnings Before Tax) is equal to EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) minus interest expense. But wait, no, EBT is the amount before tax, so EBT = EBIT - interest. Hmm, no wait, actually, EBT is after deducting interest from EBIT. So, EBT = EBIT - interest. So, if I have EBT, I can find EBIT by adding back interest. Oh, but wait, I don't have EBT yet. Let me approach this differently.

We can compute EBT as:

EBT = (Income after tax) / (1 - Tax rate) + interest expense.

Because the income after tax is the amount after all expenses, including interest and taxes. So, to get EBT, you have to reverse the tax process.

So, EBT = (5.4 million) / (1 - 0.40) + 1 million.

Calculating that:

1 - 0.4 is 0.6. So, 5.4 / 0.6 is 9 million. Then add 1 million for interest: 9 +1 = 10 million.

So EBIT would be EBT + interest. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, I think I got that wrong. EBT is before interest, so EBT = EBIT - interest. So, EBIT = EBT + interest. Oh, so in this case, EBT is 10 million, and interest is 1 million. So, EBIT is 10 + 1 = 11 million.

Wait, that can't be right because if I have EBT as 10 million, EBIT would be 10 + interest expense. Because EBT = EBIT - interest. So, EBIT is EBT + interest. So, that's 10 + 1 = 11 million.

Then, the times-interest-earned ratio is EBIT / interest expense. So 11 / 1 = 11.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 11.4, which is close but not exactly 11. So maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check. Let me go through the calculations again.

Given data:

- Income after tax: $5.4 million
- Interest expense: $1 million
- Depreciation: $1 million
- Tax rate: 40%

First, compute the tax expense. Since the tax rate is 40%, the tax on the income after tax would be 40% of $5.4 million. So 0.4 * 5.4 = 2.16 million.

Then, the EBT (Earnings Before Tax) is calculated as:

EBT = Income after tax + Tax expense = 5.4 + 2.16 = 7.56 million.

Wait, wait a minute, no. Because EBT is before tax. If the company's income after tax is 5.4, and the tax is 2.16, then EBT is 5.4 + 2.16 = 7.56. Because EBT is the amount before tax, so after tax, it's EBT - (EBT * tax rate) = 7.56 - (7.56 * 0.4) = 7.56 - 3.024 = 4.536 million. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the terms.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the income after tax as the net income, which is calculated by subtracting all expenses, including interest and taxes, from EBIT. So:

Net Income = EBIT - Interest - Taxes.

But given that, we can express EBIT as Net Income + Interest + Taxes.

So, Net Income is 5.4 million.

Interest is 1 million.

Taxes: Since the tax rate is 40%, taxes are 0.4 * 5.4 = 2.16 million.

So, EBIT = 5.4 + 1 + 2.16 = 8.56 million.

Wait no, because Net Income = EBIT - (Interest + Taxes). So, EBIT = Net Income + Interest + Taxes.

So, 5.4 + 1 + 2.16 = 8.56 million.

Then, TIE ratio is EBIT / Interest = 8.56 / 1 = 8.56.

But looking at the options, I don't see 8.56. The options are 11.4, 12, 8.4, etc.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the taxes. Let me re-calculate the taxes again.

Tax = 40% of income after tax.

So 40% of 5.4 is 0.4 * 5.4 = 2.16, correct.

So, EBIT = 5.4 + 1 + 2.16 = 8.56 million.

Hmm, so TIE is 8.56. But none of the options match that. The options are A:11.4, B:12, C:8.4, D:6.4, etc.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let's try another approach.

Another way: The formula for TIE ratio is EBIT divided by interest. To calculate EBIT, we can use the after-tax income and the tax rate.

Let’s denote EBIT as E.

Then, the net income (after-tax) is E - Interest - Taxes.

But, Taxes = Tax Rate * Net Income.

So,

Net Income = E - Interest - (Tax Rate * Net Income)

Let me write this:

Net Income = E - I - (TR * Net Income)

Let me plug in the numbers:

5.4 = E - 1 - (0.4 * 5.4)

Compute 0.4 *5.4 = 2.16

So,

5.4 = E -1 -2.16 → 5.4 = E -3.16 → E = 5.4 +3.16 = 8.56.

So EBIT is 8.56 million.

Then, TIE ratio is 8.56 /1 = 8.56.

But the options don't have 8.56. So perhaps I'm wrong about which expenses are considered. Oh, wait, maybe the company has other expenses. Let me check the question again.

The question says: income after tax, interest, depreciation. So, other expenses? No, the question doesn't mention any other expenses. So perhaps I have to consider only the given numbers.

But according to this, the TIE ratio would be 8.56, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the tax expense is different. Let me think again. The income after tax is $5.4 million. So, that's the net income. The tax rate is 40%. So, the tax expense is 40% of net income. So, 0.4 *5.4 = 2.16 million.

So, the EBIT is Net Income + interest + taxes. So 5.4 + 1 + 2.16 = 8.56 million. Then, TIE is 8.56 / 1 = 8.56.

But the options don't have that. Wait, the options include 8.4 as option C. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Maybe calculate the EBIT as follows.

EBIT = (Income after tax) / (1 - tax rate) + interest.

Wait, that formula. Let me try that.

So, (5.4) / (0.6) = 9 million.

Add interest of 1 million: 9 +1 = 10 million.

Then, TIE is 10 /1 = 10, which is option E.

But that would be if EBIT = income after tax / (1 - tax) + interest. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the correct formulas.

The correct formula for TIE ratio is:

Times-Interest-Earned Ratio = EBIT / Interest Expense

To find EBIT, we can use the formula:

EBIT = (EAT) / (1 - Tax Rate) + Interest Expense

Because EAT is the earnings before tax. So,

EAT = Income after tax + Taxes.

So, EAT = 5.4 + (0.4 *5.4) = 5.4 + 2.16 = 7.56.

Then, EBIT = 7.56 / (1 -0.4) + 1.

1 -0.4 is 0.6.

7.56 /0.6= 12.6.

Add interest 1 million: 12.6 +1 =13.6.

Wait, that's not right. Maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps EBIT is calculated as:

EAT = EBIT (1 - tax rate) - interest expense.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think differently. Maybe I should directly compute EBIT.

EBIT = (after-tax income) / (1 - tax rate) + interest.

So, 5.4 /0.6 =9.

9+1=10 → TIE is 10.

But this would make TIE 10, which is option E (10). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

EBIT = (Income after tax) / (1 - tax rate) + interest.

Which is 5.4 /0.6 =9 +1=10, so TIE ratio is 10. So, option E.

But earlier, when I calculated EBIT as 8.56, that gives TIE of 8.56. But none of the options have that.

Hmm. Let me look at the options:

A:11.4, B:12, C:8.4, D:6.4, E:12.4, F:15, G:7.4, H:5.4, I:9, J:10.

Wait, the correct calculation via EBIT = A + interest gives 10, which is an option. So, the answer should be E) 10.

But wait, the options don't have 8.56, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute EBIT as:

EBIT = (Net Income) / (1 - tax rate) + interest.

Wait, that would be 5.4 /0.6 =9 +1=10. So TIE is 10.

Alternatively, another approach: EBIT = (EAT) / (1 - tax rate) + interest.

EAT is 5.4, so 5.4 /0.6=9. Add interest 1: 9+1=10.

So TIE is 10, which is option E.

But earlier, when I calculated EBIT as 8.56, I got a TIE of 8.56, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to use EBIT = (EAT) / (1 - tax) + interest.

But I'm getting a TIE of 10, which is option E. So, the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but wait, the initial problem statement says the income after tax is 5.4 million. So, perhaps the way to compute TIE is as follows:

EBIT = (5.4) / (1 - 0.4) + 1 → 5.4 / 0.6 =9 +1=10.

So TIE is 10. So option E is correct.

But wait, looking at the options, E is 12.4. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute EBIT as:

EBIT = (Income after Tax) / (1 - tax rate) + interest.

Yes, which is 5.4 /0.6=9 +1=10. So, option E.

Thus, the correct answer is E:10.
</think>

To calculate the company’s times-interest-earned (TIE) ratio, we use the formula:

\[
\text{TIE Ratio} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expense}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate EBIT
EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{EBIT} = \frac{\text{Income after Tax}}{1 - \text{Tax Rate}} + \text{Interest Expense}
\]

Given:
- Income after Tax = $5.4 million
- Tax Rate = 40% = 0.4
- Interest Expense = $1 million

First, calculate the tax expense:
\[
\text{Tax Expense} = 0.4 \times 5.4 = 2.16 \text{ million}
\]

Next, calculate EBIT:
\[
\text{EBIT} = \frac{5.4}{1 - 0.4} + 1 = \frac{5.4}{0.6} + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 \text{ million}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate TIE Ratio
Now, use the formula for TIE ratio:
\[
\text{TIE Ratio} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expense}} = \frac{10}{1} = 10
\]

### Final Answer
The company’s TIE ratio is **10**, which corresponds to option **E**.
