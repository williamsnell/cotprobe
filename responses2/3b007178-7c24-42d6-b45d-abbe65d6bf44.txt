Okay, so I've got this question here about finding all c in Z_3 such that the ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) is a field. Hmm, I remember that for a quotient ring to be a field, the polynomial in the denominator must be irreducible. Wait, but wait. Because in Z_3[x], if the polynomial is irreducible, then the quotient ring is a field. Oh right, because the ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial is maximal, and the quotient would then be a field.

So, the question is to find all c in Z_3 such that x^3 + x^2 + c is irreducible over Z_3. But wait, what's Z_3? Oh, right, it's the integers modulo 3. So c can be 0,1,2 in this context.

Wait, but wait. Let's think: For a cubic polynomial over a field to be irreducible, it must not have any roots in the field. Because if it had a root, it would factor into a linear term and a quadratic, making it reducible. So, to check if x^3 + x^2 + c is irreducible, I need to see if it has any roots in Z_3.

So, let's plug in each possible c value (0,1,2) into the polynomial and see if it evaluates to zero in Z_3.

First, c=0:
The polynomial becomes x^3 + x^2. Let's plug in x=0: 0 + 0 = 0. Oh, so that's a root. So x^3 + x^2 is reducible, because it's divisible by x. So c=0 is not acceptable.

c=1:
The polynomial is x^3 + x^2 + 1. Let's check x=0: 0 + 0 +1=1≠0.
x=1: 1 +1 +1=3≡0 mod3. Oh, so x=1 is a root. So this polynomial is reducible because it factors into (x-1)(something). So c=1 is out.

c=2:
Polynomial is x^3 + x^2 + 2. Let's test x=0: 0 +0 +2=2≠0.
x=1:1 +1 +2=4≡1≠0.
x=2:8 +4 +2=14≡2 mod3 (because 8 mod3 is 2, 4 is 1, 2 is 2. 2+1+2=5≡2 mod3). So none of the roots are zero, which means the polynomial has no linear factors. Hence, it's irreducible. So c=2 is acceptable.

So among the options, c=2 is the correct choice. Looking at the options, that's option B. Wait, but let's double-check. The options are:

A: -2 (which is 1 mod3 because -2 +3=1)
B: 2
C:1
D:-1 (which is 2 mod3)
E:-3 (which is 0 mod3)
F:0
G:3 (which is 0)
H:4 (1)
I:6 (0)
J:5 (2)

Wait, so according to the options, the correct c is 2, which is option B. So the answer should be B.

The polynomial \( x^3 + x^2 + c \) must be irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) for the quotient ring \( \mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) \) to be a field. A cubic polynomial is irreducible if it has no roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Checking each value:

- For \( c=0 \), \( x^3 + x^2 \) has a root at \( x=0 \), so it's reducible.
- For \( c=1 \), \( x^3 + x^2 + 1 \) has a root at \( x=1 \), so it's reducible.
- For \( c=2 \), none of the elements in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) are roots, so the polynomial is irreducible.

Thus, the value \( c=2 \) (option B) makes the polynomial irreducible.

Answer: B
