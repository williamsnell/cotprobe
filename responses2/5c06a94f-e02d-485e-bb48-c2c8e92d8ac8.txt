Question:

A talk show host recently reported that in response to his on-air question, 82% of the more than 2500 e-mail messages received through his publicized address supported the death penalty for anyone convicted of selling drugs to children. What does this show?

Options:

A: The survey is biased because it only includes listeners who have access to email.
B: The survey would have been more meaningful if he had used a control group.
C: The survey is accurate as it includes a large number of responses.
D: The survey would have been more meaningful if he had picked a random sample of the 2500 listeners who responded.
E: The survey is valid because it represents the opinion of the show's listeners.
F: The survey would have been more meaningful if he had included listeners who disagreed with his viewpoint.
G: The survey is meaningless because of voluntary response bias.
H: The survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support the death penalty for drug dealers.

Okay, so I've got this question here about a talk show host's survey on the death penalty for selling drugs to children. The question is asking what this shows, and there are several options to choose from. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the question says that 82% of more than 2500 email messages received supported the death penalty. The host's question probably influenced the survey, right? But wait, the question is about what this survey shows. So, what does this data tell us?

I remember from my stats class that when a survey is done, especially in a public setting, it's possible that there's a bias. Let me think about the options.

Option A says the survey is biased because it only includes listeners who have access to email. Well, the survey is done through email, so maybe people who don't have access to email can't respond. So the sample might not be representative. That sounds like a possibility.

Option B suggests a control group would be better. But this is a single survey, not an experimental one, so a control group isn't relevant here. So probably B is not the answer.

Option C says the survey is accurate because it includes a large number of responses. Well, 2500 is a decent sample size, but the accuracy depends on how the sample is selected. If it's a random sample, then it's accurate. But if it's not, then it's not. So without more info, I can't say for sure if it's accurate. So C might not be the answer.

Option D says the survey would be more meaningful if they used a random sample. But the question is about what the survey shows, not about how it should have been done. So D is about the future, not the present. Not directly answering the question.

Option E: The survey is valid because it represents the opinion of the show's listeners. Validity has to do with whether the survey measures what it's intended to measure. If the question is about the support for the death penalty, then the survey's validity would depend on how the survey was designed. If it was a random sample and framed correctly, it should be valid. But the question is about what this survey shows, not about its validity. So E might be about its own validity, not the data it's showing.

Option F: Including people who disagree would change things, but I don't think that's what's being asked. The question is about what the data shows, not how it was manipulated.

Option G: The survey shows the majority supports. 82% is a strong majority. So the host's survey would show that a majority do support it. But the question is about what the survey shows, not the outcome. So G would be the conclusion from the data, not the data itself.

Option H: The survey shows the majority of listeners support. But the survey is about the show's listeners. So the majority of the listeners who responded support it. But the question is about what the survey shows. So H is a conclusion based on the data, but the question is about the data's implications.

Wait, the question is: What does this show? So what does the data indicate about the listeners' opinions. The data shows a high percentage of respondents support it, but the question is about what it shows. 

So the options are about what the survey shows. So the correct answer would be about what the survey data indicates. 

Looking again, option G says the majority of the host's listeners support it, which is what the data shows. So the answer is G.

Alternatively, option A says the survey is biased because only those with email access are included. That's a common issue in surveys conducted through email, as not everyone can access it. So if the email was shared widely enough, but some couldn't, the sample could be biased. So A is a possibility. But I think the question is asking about the nature of the survey itself, not about the host's perspective. So the survey's results are the conclusion, but what does the survey show?

Wait, let me read the question again: The talk show host's question was part of the survey. So the survey results are the findings. So what does that show about the listeners' opinion? 

If the survey includes a large enough sample but is voluntary, there could be voluntary response bias. But in this case, the survey was through email, which might have been a problem because not everyone could respond. So option G suggests the survey shows the majority of the host's listeners support it, which would be the conclusion. But the question is about what the survey shows, not what it shows about the host's audience.

Alternatively, option D is about using a random sample, which would make the survey more valid, but that's about the method, not the data itself.

Wait, actually, the question's options are all about what the survey shows. So the data itself is about the majority of the sample supporting it. So what does that show about the survey? The survey shows that the majority of the participants support the death penalty regardless of the host's perspective. But the question is about what the survey shows, not its implications.

Wait, the options are about what the survey shows. So the correct answer is about what the data indicates. So, the survey shows that a majority of the participants (likely the more email-accessible, but in reality, it's a sample) support it. So the data as a whole shows that the majority of the surveyed listeners support it.

But looking at the options again, the best fit is G: The survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support the death penalty for drug dealers. Because the question is about the survey's findings, not about the host's own conclusion.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is about what the survey shows. The data shows that 82% of the surveyed e-mails support it. So the data shows that the majority of the surveyed listeners (i.e., more than 2500) support it. So the survey shows that a majority support it, which is option H. But wait, option H says it shows the majority of the host's listeners. Wait, no. The host's listeners are the ones who responded, which is a subset of the 2500.

So option G says the survey shows the majority of the host's listeners support it. That would imply that the majority of those who responded (the host's listeners) support it. But the survey's data is about all 2500, the total population. So the data is about the majority of the 2500, not the host's listeners. So option G is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The question is not asking why the survey is biased, but what the survey shows. So the survey shows that 82% of the surveyed people (who are the host's listeners) support it. Because the survey included the host's listeners. So the data as a whole is about the host's listeners.

So the correct answer is option H. But wait, no. Let me look at the options again.

Option G says the survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support it. So which is the conclusion from the data. But the question is about what the survey shows, so the data shows that the majority of the surveyed (including the host's listeners) support it. So the survey data as a whole is about the majority of the surveyed, which includes the host's listeners. So the data shows a majority of the surveyed (the host's listeners) support it. So the correct answer is H. But wait, option H says "the majority of the host's listeners support it," which is correct. But option G says "the survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support it." So which is the correct option?

Wait, the options are about what the survey shows. The survey's findings are that 82% of the surveyed (which are the host's listeners) support it. So the survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support it. So the correct answer would be G.

Wait no, because the survey's results are about the host's listeners. So the data from the survey is about the host's listeners. So option G says the survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support it. So that's correct. So the correct answer is G.

Wait, but option H is "the survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support the death penalty for drug dealers." So the survey's data is about the host's listeners, so the correct option is G.

But wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me reevaluate.

The question is about what the survey shows. The way the question is phrased, the survey's data is about the host's listeners. So the survey's findings are about the host's listeners. Therefore, the correct answer is G. So the survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support it, which is option G.

Wait, but the options are not phrased as "the majority of the host's listeners support it," but the wording of the options. Let me look again.

Option G: The survey is meaningless because of voluntary response bias.

Wait, no. Option G is stating that the survey shows the majority of the host's listeners support it.

Wait, but the wording of the options: the survey is a result about the majority of the host's listeners, so the correct answer is G.

Wait, but the options are A to H. So the correct answer is G. So the question is which option the survey shows. The survey shows that a majority of the host's listeners support it, which is option G.

But wait, another thought: if the survey was conducted through email, not everyone can respond, which could lead to a non-response bias. But that's a different issue. The question is about what the survey shows, not about the source of bias. So the correct answer is G. So the survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support it.

Wait, but looking at the options again: option G is "The survey is meaningless because of voluntary response bias." That doesn't seem right, because the wording seems to suggest that the data is meaningless. But the data is about the survey's findings, which is a majority of the host's listeners. So option G is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is H: The survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support the death penalty for drug dealers.

But wait, the options are A to H, and H is a conclusion based on the data, not the data itself.

Alternatively, option G is stating that the survey shows the majority of the host's listeners support it.

Wait, but the wording of the options: the survey is a result about the majority of the host's listeners, so the correct answer is G.

Wait, but the options are A to H, and each option is a statement. So the question is which statement the survey shows.

So the survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support the death penalty. So the correct answer is G.

But wait, the wording of option G is: The survey is meaningless because of voluntary response bias. That's not correct because the survey's data is the majority of the host's listeners. So G is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think again.

The talk show host's survey found that 82% of the more than 2500 e-mails support the death penalty.

So the survey includes all the e-mails, which are from the host's listeners. So the survey's data is about the majority of the host's listeners.

Thus, the correct interpretation is that 82% of the host's listeners support it. So the survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support it.

Looking at the options, option G says that. So the correct answer is G.

But option H says the same thing. No, wait, no. Option G is about the majority of the host's listeners, and option H is another statement.

Wait, no. The options are:

G: The survey is meaningless because of voluntary response bias.

H: The survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support the death penalty for drug dealers.

Wait, that's correct. The survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners (the respondents) support it, which is option H.

But wait, the wording of the option is about the survey's data. So the data as a whole is about the host's listeners, so the survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support it, which is option H.

But another angle: the survey may have a problem with voluntary response bias because it's through email, which may not be representative. So option A is about bias because of email access.

But the question is about what the survey shows, not about the bias of the survey itself. So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but the options are:

Option G: The survey is meaningless because of voluntary response bias.

Option H: The survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support it.

So the question is about what the survey shows. The data is about the host's listeners, so the survey shows that. So option H is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think: the data is about the host's listeners. So the survey's data is 82% of the host's listeners. So the survey shows that a majority of the host's listeners support it. So the correct answer is G, because it states this. But the wording in G is incorrect.

Wait, no. Option G says the survey is meaningless due to voluntary response bias. That can't be right. So the correct statement is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to summarize. The survey's data is that 82% of the surveyed e-mails (the host's listeners) support it. So the survey shows that the majority of the host's listeners support it. So the correct answer is H.

But option G says the survey is invalid because of voluntary response bias. That's not correct. So the correct answer is H.

The talk show host's survey found that 82% of the surveyed emails (likely the host's listeners) support the death penalty for selling drugs to children. The question asks what this survey shows, not why it was conducted or biased. The options are analyzed as follows:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The survey may not be biased because not everyone can respond via email.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. A control group is not used; the survey is a single sample.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. A large sample size supports validity, not necessarily accuracy.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. A random sample would enhance validity, not show the host's listeners' perspective.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The survey's validity depends on design, not the sample's representativeness.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Disagreements don't negate the survey's findings.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The survey shows the host's listeners' support, not the survey's overall validity.
- **Option H**: Correct. The survey shows the majority of the host's listeners support the death penalty.

Thus, the survey demonstrates that the majority of the host's listeners support the death penalty for selling drugs to children.
