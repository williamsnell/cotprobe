Question:

A rancher was the owner of a parcel of land in fee simple. The rancher left the parcel in 1977 to move to the city. A man took possession of the land in 1978 as an adverse possessor and remained on the land from 1978 to 1988; he then left the property to care for his sick mother for one year, returning the following year, 1990. Meanwhile, during the man's possession, the rancher devised the parcel to his son in 1994. The man remained on the property until2010. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. Upon the rancher's death in 2010, his son, as his sole heir, brings an ejectment suit to recover possession of the property from the man. In his action, the son will most probably

Options:

A: lose, because the man's occupation of the property was continuous and hostile.
B: lose, because the man has been living on the property for more than 20 years.
C: lose, because the man's occupation of the land was uninterrupted.
D: win, because the man did not have a legitimate claim to the property.
E: win, because the man left the property to take care of his mother for one year.
F: win, because the man did not have the rancher's permission to live on the property.
G: win, because the statutory period for adverse possession does not run against a remainder- man until his interest becomes possessory.
H: lose, because the man has acquired title by adverse possession.
I: win, because his title was perfected at the time of conveyance.
J: win, because the man had abandoned the property for a year.

Okay, so I have this legal question here about adverse possession and ejectment suits. Let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that adverse possession is a common law concept, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me see what the question says.

The rancher left the parcel in 1977 to move to the city. Then, a man took possession in 1978 until 1988. He left the property to care for his sick mother in 1990, and he remained on it until 2010. Meanwhile, the rancher devised it to his son in 1994. The man was living on the property until 2010, and the rancher died in 2010. The son is suing for ejectment because he wants possession.

The options are about whether the son will lose or win. I need to figure out the legal principles here.

First, adverse possession requires a statutory period. The question says the state's statutory period is 20 years. So, if someone stays on a parcel for more than that period without leaving in a hostile way, they have a right to ejectment.

In this case, the rancher left in 1977, and the man came in 1978. So the rancher's first action was in 1977. Then, the man took it in 1978. But what's the initial period? The man was on it until 1988. That's 10 years. Since the statute is 20, the initial period is 10 years, which is less than 20. So, does that mean he's still under the statute?

Wait, no. The concept is that the initial period is the first 20 years from when the owner first left. So the initial 20 years are from the time the owner left. So if the owner left in 1977, then the 20-year period would start in 1977 and go until 1997 (1977 + 20). So the man stayed until 1988, which is within that first 20 years. So he's not yet out of the initial period.

But wait, the man left in 1990. So from 1990 onwards, he's on the property for a while. But the initial period is 20 years. So the man's occupation was continuous but was he leaving in a hostile manner?

Wait, the question says the man remained on the property until 2010. So the man was on the property from 1978 to 2010, which is more than 20 years. So even though he was on it for 10 years after the initial 20, but he left again in 1990. Wait no, because the initial period is 20 years from the first action, so 1977 to 1997. So from 1978 to 1997, the first 20 years. Then, he leaves again in 1990. So that's within the initial period.

Wait, but he left in 1990. So he was on the property from 1978 to 1990. That's 12 years. Then again until 2010. So from 1990 to 2010 is 20 years. So that's exactly 20 years. So the initial 20 years started in 1977, so 1977-1997. Then, from 1990 to 1997, which is 7 years. Then from 1990 to 2010, which is 20 years. Wait, but the initial 20 is from when the owner left, which was 1977. So the initial period is 1977 to 1997. Then, from 1990 to 1997, that's 7 years into the initial period. Then, from 1990 to 2010, which is 20 years, that's the second 20-year period after the initial.

So in any case, the initial period is 20 years. The man was on the property from 1978 to 2010. So from 1978, 20 years would end in 1997. So until 1997, he was on the property in the initial 20-year period. Then, from 1990 to 1997, that's 7 years, so he's still under the initial period but not yet out.

Wait, but the man left in 1990, which is within the initial 20-year period. But his occupation was continuous? So, is the man still entitled to ejectment because he's lived on the property for the entire initial 20-year period, and then again for another 20 (from 1990 to 2010), but the initial was up to 1997. Wait, no, because the initial period is 20 years from 1977, so 1997. So the man was on the property until 2010, which includes the first 20 years (1977-1997) and then 20 years starting from 1990 (1990-2010), but that's overlapping with the initial period. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is whether the man was living on the property for a total of more than 20 years, regardless of when. If the man stayed on the property for more than 20 years, he's out. Because adverse possession requires a 20-year period. So if the man was on the property for more than 20 years, he can't stay. But in this case, he was on the property from 1978 to 2010, which is 33 years (2010-1978=32, plus one year, 33). So that's more than 20. So he has a legitimate claim. Therefore, the man can't stay, so ejectment is possible.

Wait, but the man was on it from 1978 to 2010. So that's 33 years, which is more than 20. So he's either in possession for over 20 years, making him a legitimate claim.

But wait, wait. The state's statutory period is 20 years. So any time the owner stays on the property for more than 20 years without leaving in a hostile manner can ejectment. So in this case, the rancher left in 1977, man came in 1978. The initial 20 years are from 1977-1997. Then, from 1990 onwards, he's on the property for another 20 years (1990-2010). But the initial 20-year period already starts in 1977. So if the man stayed for 20 years after 1977, he can't stay as an adverse possessor. But in this case, the man left in 1990, which is within the initial 20-year period. So from 1978 to 1997 is the initial 20 years. Then, he was on the property again from 1990 to 2010. So the first 20 years are from 1977-1997. The second 20-year period is 1990-2010.

So the man's occupation was continuous in the initial period. So he could have left in 1990, but that's still within the initial 20-year period. So he's still in possession for the initial 20 years, so he can't stay as an adverse possessor. Therefore, he must eject, so the son can get possession.

Wait, but the options include C: lose because occupation was continuous and hostile. So that's probably the right answer. Because the man's occupation was continuous, and he left the property in a hostile way (as he was given a job), so he's a valid adverse possessor.

Alternatively, I'm a bit confused about when the initial period ends. The initial 20 years are from when the rancher left, 1977, until 1997. Then, the man was on it until 2010. So from 1978 to 1990, that's 12 years, and then from 1990 onwards, 20 more years. So the total is 33 years. But the initial 20 is 1977-1997. So from 1990-1997 is part of the initial period, and 1990-2010 is the second 20-year period. So he's still in the initial 20 years. So he's already out, and thus, can't stay as an adverse possessor.

Wait, no, because the initial 20 is from 1977. So the initial 20-year period is 1977 to 1997. So the man was on the property from 1978 to 2010. So from 1990 to 1997, that's part of the initial 20 years. So he's in the initial period and can't stay as an adverse possessor. Therefore, the man's occupation was continuous and hostile (he left in 1990, which is within the initial period), so he is entitled to ejectment. Therefore, the son will lose because the man's occupation was continuous and hostile.

Looking at the options: option C says "lose because the man's occupation was continuous and hostile." That matches.

The question revolves around adverse possession and ejectment suits. The key facts are as follows:

1. **Rancher's Action**: The rancher left the parcel in 1977 and devised it to his son in 1994. The man took possession in 1978 and stayed on the property until 2010, leaving it to care for his sick mother until 1990, and then returning in 1990. The rancher died in 2010.

2. **Statutory Period**: The state's statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years.

3. **Adverse Possession Requirements**: To remain as an adverse possessor, an individual must stay on the property for more than 20 years without leaving in a hostile manner. The initial 20-year period starts when the owner first left, which was in 1977. This period ends in 1997.

4. **Occupancy Analysis**: The man was on the property from 1978 to 2010, which is 33 years. However, the initial 20-year period (1977–1997) overlaps with his stay. The man left the property in 1990, which is within the initial 20-year period. Therefore, he is not yet out of the initial period and cannot stay as an adverse possessor.

5. **Ejectment Suit**: Since the man's occupation was continuous and hostile (he left in 1990, within the initial 20-year period), he is entitled to ejectment. The son will lose the suit.

**Analysis of Options**:
- **A**: Incorrect. The man's occupation was continuous, and he left in a hostile manner.
- **B**: Incorrect. The man was on the property for more than 20 years, not less.
- **C**: Correct. The man's occupation was continuous and hostile, making him a valid adverse possessor.
- **D**–**J**: Incorrect as they suggest the son wins, which is not the case.

**Answer**: C
