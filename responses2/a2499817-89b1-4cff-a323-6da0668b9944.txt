Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. The equations are 725x + 727y = 1500 and 729x + 731y = 1508. I need to find the value of x minus y. Hmm, I remember that solving systems of equations can be done with substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination would be better here since the coefficients are close to each other.

Let me write down the equations:

1) 725x + 727y = 1500
2) 729x + 731y = 1508

I think if I subtract equation 1 from equation 2, I can eliminate one variable. Let me try that.

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

(729x - 725x) + (731y - 727y) = 1508 - 1500
4x + 4y = 8

Wait, 1508 minus 1500 is 8. So, 4x + 4y equals 8. I can factor out a 4:

4(x + y) = 8 → x + y = 2.

So, x + y = 2. That's one equation. Now, I need another to find x and y individually. Let me see what I can do. Maybe I can use substitution or another elimination. Let's try to express x in terms of y or vice versa.

From x + y = 2, I can express x as 2 - y. Then I'll substitute this into equation 1.

Equation 1 becomes:

725(2 - y) + 727y = 1500.

Let me compute that:

725*2 is 1450, and 725*(-y) is -725y, plus 727y.

So, 1450 -725y +727y = 1500.

Combine like terms: (-725y +727y) is 2y.

So, 1450 + 2y = 1500.

Subtract 1450 from both sides: 2y = 50 → y = 25.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations. Let me redo the substitution step.

Equation 1 substitution:

725x +727y = 1500 → substitute x = 2 - y:

725*(2 - y) +727y = 1500.

Expanding:

725*2 = 1450
725*(-y) = -725y
727y remains.

So, 1450 -725y +727y = 1500.

Adding the y terms: (-725y +727y) = 2y.

So, 1450 + 2y = 1500 → 2y = 50 → y=25.

Wait, that seems correct. So y is 25. Then x is 2 - y, which is 2 -25 = -23.

So x = -23, y=25.

Wait, but the question is asking for x - y. So, x - y = (-23) -25 = -48. That's option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the equations with these values to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Check equation 1: 725*(-23) +727*25.

Compute each term:

725*(-23) = -725*23. Let's calculate 700*23=16100, 25*23=575 → 16100+575=16675 → -16675.

727*25 = let's compute 700*25=17500, 27*25=675 → 17500+675=18175.

Adding together: -16675 +18175 = 1500. Which matches the first equation.

Now equation 2: 729*(-23) +731*25.

729*(-23) → 700*23=16100, 29*23=667 → 16100+667=16767 → so -16767.

731*25: 700*25=17500, 31*25=775 → 17500+775=18275.

Adding together: -16767 +18275 = 1508. Which matches the second equation.

So, x is indeed -23 and y is 25. Therefore, x - y is -48, which is option A.

To solve the system of equations:

1) \(725x + 727y = 1500\)
2) \(729x + 731y = 1508\)

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate variables:

\[
(729x - 725x) + (731y - 727y) = 1508 - 1500 \\
4x + 4y = 8 \\
x + y = 2
\]

Express \(x\) in terms of \(y\): \(x = 2 - y\).

Substitute into equation 1:

\[
725(2 - y) + 727y = 1500 \\
1450 - 725y + 727y = 1500 \\
2y = 50 \\
y = 25
\]

Then \(x = 2 - y = 2 - 25 = -23\).

Thus, \(x - y = -23 - 25 = -48\).
