Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about mass-society theory. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking what mass-society theory suggests. The options are A to J. I remember that mass society theory is related to how society operates, focusing on the interplay between different classes and the media.

First, I'll try to recall what mass society theory generally states. From what I remember, mass society theory emphasizes the role of the media in shaping public opinion and the distribution of power. It's about how different groups, including the ruling class, the working class, and the masses, interact through media.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The subordinate classes are dominated by the ideology of the ruling class. Hmm, that sounds more like the theory of classes, not mass society. I think mass society is about media influence, not class ideology.

Option B: The media serves as a platform for the masses to voice their opinions. That doesn't sound right. I thought the media is more of a source, not a platform for masses. Maybe this is the opposite of mass society theory. Or perhaps it's about how the media is used, not its role in itself.

Option C: The media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers. Wait, isn't that more about how the masses are influenced rather than the media itself? Or maybe it's a part of how media is used, not the theory itself.

Option D: Audiences make selective interpretations of media messages. This rings a bell. I think it's a key point of mass society theory. It suggests that the masses, not the media, have the power to interpret what's being said. So the media's content is interpreted by the audience.

Option E: The content of the media is determined by market forces. That's more about the media's production, not the theory's focus. I don't think this is correct. Market forces more influence production rather than the content.

Option F: The media's sole purpose is to disseminate information impartially. No, that's more of a theory about media ethics, not mass society.

Option G: The masses manipulate the media through their consumption patterns. That sounds a lot like option D, but I don't think these are separate. I think G is actually a part of D, because if the masses interpret the media's content, they are manipulating the media.

Option H: The dominant classes are influenced by the ideologies of the subordinate class. That sounds like the class structure theory, not mass society.

Option I: The media is independent of societal influences. No, that's the opposite. Mass society theory suggests that media is influenced by society.

Option J: The content of the media is solely determined by government censorship. That's a specific policy theory, not a general theory about how media works.

So putting it together. The correct answer is likely D or G. Since G seems to be a broader statement encompassing D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think mass society theory primarily focuses on the media's role in shaping public opinion, so D is more accurate.

Wait, another approach: What do I know about mass society theory? I think it's about the media's role in the flow of information and shaping public opinion. So it's not that the masses are the ones interpreting, but rather that the masses, through their consumption, form their own interpretations of the media's messages. So D says audiences make selective interpretations, which is correct. So the answer should be D.

But wait, looking at option G: "the masses manipulate the media through their consumption patterns." So if D is correct, then G would be redundant. But perhaps the question is testing whether these options are alternatives or related points. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, the options list them as separate possibilities, so the question is which statement is correct. So if D is correct, then it's a separate point, but perhaps G is a broader statement.

Alternatively, considering the structure, the correct answer for mass society theory is that the media is affected by the masses, allowing them to interpret it, which is D. But I'm a bit confused because I thought G is also a correct statement.

Let me think again. Mass society theory: It's about the media being influenced by the masses, who can interpret and shape the messages. So the correct statement would be D. However, option G is a broader statement, suggesting that the masses are the ones causing the media's content, which is part of D.

Wait, the question is asking what mass-society theory suggests. So the correct answer would likely be D, as that's a direct assertion of the media being influenced by the masses for shaping public opinion. Alternatively, G is a phrasing of D. So perhaps both D and G are correct, but in the options, they are presented as separate.

Wait, but the question is about what the theory suggests. So the theory itself is about media being shaped by the masses. So the correct answer is D.

But earlier, I thought G was a possible correct option. Alternatively, perhaps both D and G are correct, but I think D is the main point.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D because it's the primary assertion of mass society theory. For example, the theory would state that media is influenced by the masses, allowing them to shape its content. So the correct statement is D.

Alternatively, G says that masses manipulate media through consumption, which is a way of saying that the masses are the ones interpreting, which is what D says. So perhaps both D and G are correct, but the options are presented separately.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is D, as the question is about what the theory suggests. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let's think of the options again. The question is asking which statement is correct. Another approach: I remember that mass society theory includes the idea that media is influenced by the masses, leading to selective interpretation. So the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is **D: The audiences make selective interpretations of media messages**. This aligns with the core idea of mass society theory, which posits that the media is shaped by the masses, who interpret its content, thereby influencing public opinion. 

**Answer: D**
