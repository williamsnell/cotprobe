Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The problem says that a star b is defined as a raised to the power of b minus a times b. So, a star b = a^b - ab. Then, it gives an equation where 2 star x equals 22. I need to find the value of x from the given options.

Hmm, let me break this down. The equation is 2 star x = 22. Using the definition of the star operation, that translates to 2^x minus 2 times x equals 22. So, the equation is 2^x - 2x = 22. I need to find x such that this holds true.

Looking at the options, they are numbers from 15 down to 6, but let me think again. Wait, the options are A:15, B:7, C:3, D:22, E:11, F:10, G:5, H:9, I:4, J:6. Wait, but 2^x grows exponentially, so 2^x can get big quickly. Let me try plugging in some of these numbers to see if any satisfy the equation.

Let me start with option A: x=15. Let's compute 2^15. 2^10 is 1024, so 2^15 is 32768. Then, 2*15 is 30. Subtract 30 from 32768, which gives 32738. That's way bigger than 22. So A is not the answer.

Next, option B: x=7. 2^7 is 128. 2*7 is 14. 128-14 is 114, which is still larger than 22. So B is out.

Option C: x=3. 2^3 is 8. 2*3 is 6. 8-6=2. That's way less than 22, so no.

Option D: x=22. 2^22 is a huge number, I think it's 4,194,304. Subtracting 2*22=44 would make it 4,194,260, which is way bigger than 22. So D is not it.

Option E: x=11. 2^11 is 2048. 2*11 is 22. So 2048-22 = 2026. That's way higher than 22, so E is not correct.

Option F: x=10. 2^10 is 1024. 2*10 is 20. 1024-20=1004. Definitely not 22.

Option G: x=5. Let's compute 2^5=32. 2*5=10. 32-10=22. Wait, that's exactly what we need! So 2^5 - 2*5 = 32 - 10 = 22. That fits perfectly. So x=5 is the solution.

Wait, let me check the other options as well. Option H is x=9. 2^9 is 512. 2*9=18. 512-18=494, which isn't 22. Option I: x=4. 2^4=16. 2*4=8. 16-8=8, which is not 22. Option J: x=6. 2^6=64. 2*6=12. 64-12=52, which isn't 22 either. So only option G gives the correct result.

So the answer is G:5.

The equation 2^x - 2x = 22 is evaluated for each option. Only when x=5 does the equation hold true, since 2^5 - 2*5 = 32 - 10 = 22. 

Answer: G
