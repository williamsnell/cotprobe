Okay, so I have this question about atoms and their properties. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is asking which statement about an atom is not true. The options are A to F.

First, let me recall what I know about atoms. An atom consists of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The electrons are negatively charged, protons are positive, and neutrons are neutral. The number of protons determines the element, right? Electrons are attracted to the nucleus by the protons, and the nucleus holds them in place.

Option A: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of electrons and protons. Wait, a neutral atom has a net charge of zero, which means the number of protons (which are positive) and electrons (which are negative) must balance. So yes, electrons equal protons. So A is true. So any statement claiming A is wrong would be the answer.

Option B: Electrons can only orbit at particular energy levels. I remember something about the Bohr model. Electrons can only exist in specific orbits or energy levels, specifically those defined by the principal quantum number n. So B is true, so the answer can't be B.

Option C: Electrons and protons in a neutral atom are always equal in number. Since the atom is neutral, the number of electrons equals protons. So C is true. So if any statement says C is not true, that's the answer.

Option D: Electrons can orbit at any energy level. Wait, no, I thought in the Bohr model, electrons can only be at certain shells. So D says electrons can orbit at any level, which I don't think is true. So D is false. Therefore, if the question is about which statement is not true, D would be the incorrect statement. But wait, let me check other options.

Option E: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. Wait, that's the same as option C, which says equal numbers of electrons and protons. So E is talking about neutrons and protons. So for a neutral atom, the number of protons equals electrons, but neutrons can be more or less. So E is not necessarily true. For example, in an isotope with more neutrons, the number of neutrons isn't equal to protons. So E's statement is not always true. So E could be the correct answer.

Wait, let me go back to option D. The statement says electrons can orbit at any energy level. But in reality, electrons are only in specific orbits. So option D is false. So for any question asking which statement is not true, D would be the answer.

Now, looking at the other options. Option F: The nucleus contains most of the atom’s mass but almost none of its volume. That makes sense. The nucleus is super dense, and it's small. So F is true, so it's not the answer.

So, the options that are true are A, B, C, E, F. The incorrect statement is D: electrons can orbit at any energy level. Because electrons can only be in specific energy levels. So the answer is D.

To determine which statement about an atom is not true, let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of electrons and protons. This is true because a neutral atom has a net charge of zero, meaning the number of protons (positive charges) and electrons (negative charges) must balance.
  
- **Option B**: Electrons can only orbit at particular energy levels. This is true, as electrons can only exist in specific energy levels (as described by the Bohr model).
  
- **Option C**: Electrons and protons in a neutral atom are always equal in number. This is true because a neutral atom has an equal number of electrons and protons to balance the charge.
  
- **Option D**: Electrons can orbit at any energy level. This is false because electrons can only occupy specific energy levels (as per the Bohr model), not any arbitrary energy levels.
  
- **Option E**: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. This is not necessarily true because the number of neutrons can vary between different isotopes of the same element. Thus, neutrons and protons are not always equal.
  
- **Option F**: The nucleus contains most of the atom’s mass but almost none of its volume. This is true, as the nucleus is highly dense and occupies a small volume.

The statement that is not true is **Option D**, as electrons cannot orbit at any arbitrary energy levels. 

**Answer: D**
