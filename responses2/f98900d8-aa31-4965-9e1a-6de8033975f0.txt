Okay, so I've got this question about Abraham Maslow and his theories. Let me try to break it down. I remember Maslow was a psychology professor, right? His work has to do with human needs and motivation.

The question is asking which approach expresses that some motives are more important for survival than others. So the main idea here is about survival needs versus other needs.

Let me think about the options. Option B is the hierarchy of needs. I think this refers to Maslow's Pyramid, which has five levels. The bottom are survival needs like food and water. Then there are higher levels like safety, love, belonging, and finally, self-actualization. So the hierarchy suggests that survival is the most basic need, followed by others that build on it.

Option A is homeostatic regulation. I'm not too sure about this. I think that's more about maintaining internal balance, maybe like in the body. Not directly about survival versus other needs.

Option D is intrinsic motivation. That's about motivation from within, like curiosity or personal enjoyment. Not necessarily about survival.

Option E is Drive reduction theory. This is the opposite of what the question is about. Drive reduction means reducing the need for certain physical drives, which doesn't fit survival.

Option F is Drive reduction theory, same as E, so probably not.

Option G is Cognitive dissonance. That's about feeling discomfort when beliefs conflict with reality. Not directly related to survival.

Option H is Goal-setting. That's more about planning and direction, not about the hierarchy of survival and other needs.

Option I is Expectancy-value theory. That's a theory about decision-making, not about needs.

Option J is Arousal theory. That's about the drive to seek out new experiences, but again, not directly about survival versus other needs.

So the question is about survival needs. Which approach does that? B, the hierarchy of needs, seems correct. It's the top of the pyramid, so it's about survival being the most important, then others. So the answer should be B.

The correct answer is B: Hierarchy of needs. This approach outlines survival as the first need, followed by others, reflecting Maslow's Pyramid.

Answer: B
