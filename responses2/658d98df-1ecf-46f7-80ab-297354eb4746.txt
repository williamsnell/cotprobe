Okay, so I've got this economics question here about marginal utility and total utility. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says a student eats 3 slices of pizza. The first slice gives 10 utils, the second 7, and the third 3. I need to figure out which statement is true based on this data.

First, I remember that marginal utility (MU) is the additional satisfaction or utility a person gets from consuming an additional unit of a good. So each slice's MU is the difference between the total utilities of that slice and the previous one.

Let me break it down. The first slice's MU is 10. That's straightforward. The second slice is 7 utils. So the total utility after two slices is 10 +7, which is 17. The third slice is 3, so total is 17 +3=20.

Wait, so the total utility after three slices is 20. Let me look at the options.

Option A: Total is less than 20. No, because it's exactly 20. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Student doesn't eat more pizza. Well, marginal utility is positive. The student will keep eating as long as the MU is positive. So after three slices, the next slice's MU is 3, which is still positive, so they can eat more. So B is wrong.

Option C: Total is 20. That's correct. Because 10+7+3=20.

Option D: Marginal utilities are equal. 10,7,3—no, they're all different. So D is wrong.

Option E: Should stop after 2 slices. No, because the MU of the third slice is only 3, which is still positive. So E is wrong—they should continue.

Option F: MU of 4th is 0. I don't know, but the question doesn't mention the 4th slice. So F is irrelevant, but not sure if it's correct. Wait, the MU of the 4th slice is not provided, so F is not necessarily true.

Option G: Should have eaten only one slice. No, because the student ate 3. So G is wrong.

Option H: Total utility 30. No, we have 20, so H is wrong.

Option I: 4th slice MU is negative. Not given, so I don't know. But negative MU would imply the student gets less satisfaction, but the data doesn't say that. So I don't think I can conclude I is true.

Option J: Stop after first. No, because the third slice gives 3 units of utility, which is more than the second's 7? Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, the second slice is 7, the third is 3. So each slice after the second decreases the marginal utility. So in fact, the student would prefer to eat more. So if after the first slice, the next slice's MU is 7, which is higher than 10? Wait no, no, wait. Wait, the first slice is 10, the second is 7, third is 3. So MU is decreasing. So the student would keep eating as long as the MU is positive. So after the first slice, the student would compare the next slice's MU (7) with their current total. Wait, the current total after first slice is 10. The next slice's MU is 7, which is higher than the previous (10? No, 7 is less than 10. Wait no, 7 is less than 10. Oh wait, no: wait, the second slice is 7, which is less than the first's 10. So the student would stop after the first slice because the second slice gives less than the first.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The student's total utility increases with each slice. Each time, the marginal utility is lower than the previous.

So after the first slice, the total utility is 10. The next slice's MU is 7, which is less than 10. So the student would stop eating after the first slice. Because eating the second slice would give less total utility than the previous slice. So after the first slice, the next slice (the second) is actually worse in terms of total utility. So the student would stop after the first slice, which is option J.

Wait, but the options are different. Let me check the options again.

Option J: Should have stopped after first slice. Yes, that's correct in this scenario.

Wait, but earlier I thought the total after three slices is 20, but perhaps the student will only eat as long as the MU is positive.

Wait, the problem is that the marginal utilities are positive. So the student will keep eating as long as the marginal utility is positive. So after three slices, the marginal utilities are 10,7,3—all positive. So the student would keep eating all three. So option J is wrong because the student ate three slices and can keep going, but in the options.

Wait, no. The options are about what's true, not about whether the student actually ate that many. Wait the question is which statement is true given the data.

So the options are statements about the data, not about the student's decision.

So the student ate 3 slices, but the total is 20. So the statements in the options are about the given data.

So let me reevaluate.

Looking at the options:

Which of the statements holds true?

A: total <20? No, 20.

B: student would not eat more pizza. No, because each slice's MU is positive, so student would keep eating.

C: total is 20. Yes, correct.

D: all marginals equal. No, they are different.

E: should stop after 2. No, because MU of 3 is 3 (still positive), so student continues.

F: MU 4th is 0. Not given, so can't say.

G: eat only one. No.

H: total 30. No.

I: MU of 4th negative. No.

J: stop after first. No, because after first, the second and third slices have lower MU, but still positive. So the student would eat the second slice, then the third. So if the statement is that the student should have stopped after first, but in reality, the student ate more. So statement J is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, the initial question is about which statement holds true with the given data. So what is each option's truth.

So the data is: 3 slices, with 10,7,3.

So for each option:

A: total <20? No.

B: would not eat more. No, because all slices have positive MU.

C: total 20. Yes.

D: marginals equal? No.

E: stop after 2. No.

F: MU 4th 0. We don't know.

G: eat only 1. No.

H: total 30. No.

I: 4th is negative. No.

J: stop after first. No, because the student ate 3.

So the only true statement is option C.

The question involves analyzing the total utility and marginal utility (MU) for eating pizza slices. The student consumed three slices with the following MU values: 10 utils for the first slice, 7 utils for the second, and 3 utils for the third. The task is to determine which statement about this scenario is true.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Option A**: The total utility is less than 20 utils.  
   - Total utility after three slices is \(10 + 7 + 3 = 20\).  
   - This statement is false.

2. **Option B**: The student would not eat more pizza.  
   - Marginal utilities are positive (10, 7, 3).  
   - The student would continue eating slices with positive MU.  
   - This statement is false.

3. **Option C**: The total utility is 20 utils.  
   - Total utility after three slices is indeed \(10 + 7 + 3 = 20\).  
   - This statement is true.

4. **Option D**: The marginal utilities of each slice are equal.  
   - Marginal utilities are 10, 7, and 3, which are not equal.  
   - This statement is false.

5. **Option E**: The student should have stopped eating pizza after 2 slices.  
   - The marginal utility of the third slice (3 utils) is positive, so the student would continue eating.  
   - This statement is false.

6. **Option F**: The marginal utility of the 4th slice of pizza will be 0.  
   - The data does not provide information about the 4th slice.  
   - This statement is not necessarily true.

7. **Option G**: The student should have only eaten one slice of pizza.  
   - The student ate three slices, so this is incorrect.

8. **Option H**: The total utility this student received from eating pizza is 30 utils.  
   - Total utility is 20 utils, not 30.  
   - This statement is false.

9. **Option I**: The marginal utility of the 4th slice of pizza will be negative.  
   - The data does not provide information about the 4th slice.  
   - This statement is not necessarily true.

10. **Option J**: The student should have stopped eating pizza after the first slice.  
    - The student ate three slices, so this is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The only true statement is **Option C**, as the total utility after three slices is indeed 20 utils.

**ANSWER: C**
