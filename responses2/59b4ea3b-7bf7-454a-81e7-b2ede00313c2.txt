Okay, let's tackle this question. I'm a bit new to psychology, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about systematic desensitization and which step it doesn't include. So, first, I need to recall what systematic desensitization is.

From what I remember, systematic desensitization is a desensitization technique where a person is taught to associate a feared situation with a specific response, thereby preventing the fear from reappearing. It's often used for situations where a person experiences fear after a negative event, and they want to avoid future occurrences.

The question lists seven options, and I need to find the one that's NOT a step in systematic desensitization. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Having the client confront the actual feared object or situation. Wait, I thought that's more about exposure therapy, which is a different approach. Systematic desensitization is about desensitizing through association, not directly confronting the feared object. So this might be a step not taken by systematic desensitization.

Option B: Instructing to picture each image while maintaining a relaxed state. That sounds like it's part of desensitization. In systematic desensitization, you present images that are similar to the feared situation but are easier to process. So this is a valid step.

Option C: Constructing a hierarchy of feared images. I remember that in systematic desensitization, you create a hierarchy, like a ladder, where each image is a step harder than the previous. This helps in associating each step with the fear, so this is a step taken.

Option D: Experiencing the desired state through hypnosis. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think systematic desensitization is done through behavioral techniques like association and hypnosis. Wait, does it involve hypnosis? Or is it just association and other methods. I thought that systematic desensitization is a behavioral technique that uses association and desensitization strategies, including hypnosis to desensitize. So maybe this is a step taken.

Option E: Instructing to express feelings about each feared image. Hmm. I'm not sure about this. Expressing feelings is a part of the process, maybe, but is it a step in systematic desensitization? Or is that something else, like cognitive restructuring? Or perhaps this is part of the process of desensitization, like reinforcing negative feelings. So perhaps this is a step taken.

Option F: Using exposure therapy. Wait, exposure therapy is a form of desensitization where you expose the feared situation repeatedly to limit the response. So that's exactly the opposite of systematic desensitization, which is about teaching the association. So F is not a step in systematic desensitization.

Option G: Using guided imagery. I think guided imagery is a technique used in desensitization, particularly in systematic desensitization. It involves visualizing the feared situation, which can help reduce the fear. So this is a step taken.

Now, let's re-examine Option A. The question asks which option is NOT a step. So if A is not part of systematic desensitization, then it's the answer. I thought that the client is not directly confront the feared object. Instead, systematic desensitization uses exposure (like showing the image repeatedly) and association (reducing fear by associating it with a desired behavior, like doing something else). So Option A seems like it's more related to exposure therapy, not systematic desensitization.

Wait, but the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the answer is the letter, not the option. So the options are A to G, and the answer is one of them. Since the question is which is NOT a step, we're looking for the incorrect step.

So the steps in systematic desensitization are:

1. Presenting feared images in a controlled manner.
2. Using association to link each image to a desired behavior.
3. Constructing a hierarchy of images (so C is correct).
4. Experiencing the desired state through desensitization techniques, like hypnosis (D is correct).
5. Using guided imagery (G is correct).
6. Exposure therapy (F is not part of systematic desensitization, it's the opposite process).

But wait, Option F is using exposure therapy. So the question is which is NOT a step.

Wait, the question is asking which is NOT a step taken by a therapist employing systematic desensitization. So the steps are A, B, C, D, E, G. F is not a step; it's the opposite.

But wait, going back to Option A: "having the client confront the actual feared object or situation." That's more like exposure therapy. Systematic desensitization doesn't involve confronting the object. So Option A is not a step in systematic desensitization.

Wait, but Option F is using exposure therapy, which is a different technique. So the question is about what is NOT a step in systematic desensitization. So the steps are A, B, C, D, E, G. So the incorrect step is Option A, because Option A is not part of systematic desensitization.

Wait, but the options are A through G, each being a step. So the question is, which of these options is NOT a step taken by a therapist employing systematic desensitization. So the answer is the step that is NOT part of this process.

So the options are A: confront. That's not. So the answer is A. But I'm a bit confused because I thought Option A is more about exposure therapy.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The steps in systematic desensitization are: 

1. Present feared images (but perhaps in a controlled, manageable way).
2. Use association with a desired behavior.
3. Build a hierarchy.
4. Experiences the feared situation through these associations (like a desired behavior).
5. Use guided imagery to visualize and reduce fear.
6. Use hypnosis to desensitize.

But Option A is about confronting the object. That's more exposure therapy, which is a different process. So in systematic desensitization, the client is not confronting the feared object. So Option A is not a step taken, so the answer is A.

Wait, but the options are A to G, and the answer is the letter, not the option. So the question is which is NOT a step.

So the steps taken are B, C, D, E, G. So the answer is A because it's not a step in systematic desensitization.

Wait, but wait. Option F is using exposure therapy, which is not a step in systematic desensitization. So the question is about which step is NOT taken. So which of the options is NOT a step.

The options are: A: confront, which is not a step.

Then the answer is A. But the options are in the list, so the letters in the options are A through G, and the answer is one of them. So the answer is A.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option F is using exposure therapy. So the question is, which of the options is NOT a step in systematic desensitization. So the answer is A because it's not a step. So the answer is A, which is the first option.

The question asks which step is NOT taken by a therapist employing systematic desensitization. To determine this, we analyze each option:

1. **Option A: Having the client confront the actual feared object or situation**  
   This refers to exposure therapy, which is distinct from systematic desensitization. Systematic desensitization does not involve confronting the feared object; instead, it focuses on associating the feared situation with a desired behavior.

2. **Option B: instructing the client to picture each fearful image while maintaining a relaxed state**  
   This is a step in systematic desensitization, as it involves associating images with desired behaviors.

3. **Option C: Constructing a hierarchy of feared images**  
   This is a key step in systematic desensitization, as it helps structure the association between images and desired behaviors.

4. **Option D: Helping the client experience the desired state of relaxation through hypnosis**  
   This is a part of systematic desensitization, as it uses hypnosis to desensitize the client.

5. **Option E: Instructing the client to express their feelings about each feared image**  
   This is part of the process, as expressing feelings can reinforce negative associations.

6. **Option F: Using exposure therapy to desensitize the client to feared images**  
   This is the opposite of systematic desensitization. Exposure therapy involves repeatedly exposing the feared situation to limit the response, which is not a step in systematic desensitization.

7. **Option G: Using guided imagery to help the client visualize confronting their fears**  
   This is a valid step in systematic desensitization, as guiding the client with imagery helps reduce fear.

The step NOT taken by a therapist employing systematic desensitization is **Option A**, as it involves exposure therapy, which is not part of the process.
