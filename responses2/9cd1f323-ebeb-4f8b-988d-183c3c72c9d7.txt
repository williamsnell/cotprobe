Question:

If a living frog muscle is dissected out from a frog's body and placed in a closed container without oxygen, it can contract for a time when stimulated. Then it stops. But if the container is opened, it soon regains the ability to contract. Comment.

Options:

A: The muscle cells contract due to the presence of carbon dioxide.
B: The muscle contracts because of the decrease in temperature when the container is opened.
C: The muscle cells are reanimated by the light entering the container when it is opened.
D: The muscle cells contract due to the release of lactic acid in the absence of oxygen.
E: The muscle cells require the presence of an inert gas, such as argon, to contract.
F: The muscle cells need nitrogen to contract.
G: The muscle cells contract due to the introduction of water.
H: The presence of oxygen enables the muscle cells to undergo aerobic respiration and produce more ATP, regaining its ability to contract.
I: Muscle contraction is restored due to increased humidity within the container.
J: The muscle cells contract because of the introduction of a new energy source when the container is opened.

Okay, so I've got this question about frogs and muscle contraction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it.

The question says that a living frog muscle is dissected and moved into a closed container without oxygen. It contracts for a time but then stops. Then, if the container is opened, it regains its ability to contract. So why does opening the container restore the muscle's ability to contract?

I remember that muscle cells are made of myosin and minimizing the increase in ATP production. That's why when oxygen is available, muscles don't contract much and don't get much ATP. Oh wait, right, in aerobic respiration, muscles use that oxygen. So if oxygen isn't there, the cells can't use that energy to make ATP. But when oxygen isn't available, the muscle can't contract because it's relying on ATP for contraction.

Wait, but in the question, the frog is in a closed container without oxygen. So before opening, the muscle is not contracting because it doesn't have enough ATP. Once the container is opened, the oxygen isn't there, but waitâ€”no, oxygen isn't present. Wait, no, wait. The container is without oxygen but when it's opened, maybe the oxygen comes in?

Wait no, the container is without oxygen, so when it's closed, the muscle is not contracting. But when it's opened, oxygen would enter. So that would lead to the muscle contracting again because it uses the oxygen for ATP production, which then helps in expansion, but wait that's expansion... no, wait. Or maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another angle: muscles in a closed container without oxygen. In this case, the frog's muscle is in a closed container. So the oxygen is not present. So the muscle can't undergo any increase in ATP, hence can't contract. But when the container is opened, oxygen enters, leading to the muscles' contraction again because they can now produce more ATP, which allows them to contract. So the muscle starts again when oxygen is present, right?

So the question is about why it can contract again when the container is opened. So the presence of oxygen would cause the muscle to contract again. So looking at the options:

Option H says oxygen enables aerobic respiration and ATP production, which allows the muscle to contract again. That makes sense. Because without oxygen, the muscle can't generate enough ATP for contraction, so it stops. But once oxygen is in, the ATP is produced, which allows the muscle to contract again.

Option E says it's due to release of lactic acid in absence of oxygen. I remember that lactic acid is a byproduct when muscles don't get enough ATP. So without enough ATP, the muscle can't contract, and lactic acid builds up, inhibiting contraction. But once oxygen is present, lactic acid is neutralized, making contraction possible again. So option E's reasoning is that without oxygen, the muscle can't produce enough ATP, so it's stuck. Once oxygen comes in, the muscle releases lactic acid, allowing contraction. So why would the muscle contract again? Because without oxygen, it's stuck, but with oxygen, it can produce lactic acid, which helps contract again.

Wait, so the muscle cells would need to produce lactic acid to contract. Which option aligns?

Looking back at the options:

E: muscle contracts because of release of lactic acid in absence of oxygen. So when oxygen isn't there, lactic acid is a problem, so the muscle can't contract. When oxygen comes in, lactic acid is released, allowing the muscle to contract again.

H: Oxygen enables ATP production, so the muscle can contract again. That's another possibility. Because without oxygen, the muscle can't get enough ATP, so it's stuck. But when oxygen is present, the muscle can generate more, so it contracts.

So both E and H are possible. Let me think about the process.

In the closed container without oxygen, the muscle can't produce enough ATP. So the ATP level is low. Since ATP is needed to contract, the muscle can't contract. As it contracts, it uses ATP, which is consumed. But without oxygen, the cell's energy is low.

So when oxygen is introduced, the cell produces more ATP (via aerobic respiration), which allows it to contract. So in that case, the muscle can contract again. So why does it need oxygen for that? Because the absence of oxygen causes ATP production to stop, blocking contraction.

So what's the reason the muscle can contract again? Because once oxygen is present, the cell can produce more ATP, which allows it to contract.

So the reason it can contract again is that oxygen enables the cell to produce more ATP, which the muscles can use for contraction. So option H.

But wait, what about the other options? Let's see.

Option E says lactic acid is released. Lactic acid is a byproduct when ATP is low. Without oxygen, the muscles can't produce enough ATP, so lactic acid builds up, inhibiting contraction. When oxygen is present, lactic acid is neutralized, allowing contraction.

So both E and H are possible. Which is the correct reasoning?

Hmm, the question is about why the muscle can contract again when the container is opened. So the opening brings in oxygen. So why can the muscle contract again? Because now, it can produce more ATP, which allows it to contract.

So looking at the options, option H says that the presence of oxygen enables the muscle to undergo aerobic respiration and produce more ATP, which allows the muscle to contract. That's correct.

Option E says lactic acid release. But why does the muscle contract again? Because when oxygen isn't there, the ATP isn't enough, so it can't contract. When oxygen is present, the cell produces more ATP, which allows contraction.

So option H is about ATP production. Option E is about lactic acid. But the question is about why the muscle can contract again. So the correct answer should be E or H?

Wait, what's the question again? It's a comment. The comment is:

"If a living frog muscle is dissected out from a frog's body and placed in a closed container without oxygen, it can contract for a time when stimulated. Then it stops. But if the container is opened, it soon regains the ability to contract. Comment."

So the comment is about why opening the container restores the muscle's ability to contract. So the reason must be due to the presence of oxygen.

So the correct answer is H: Because oxygen enables the muscle to undergo aerobic respiration and produce more ATP, which allows its contraction.

Wait, but another thought: When oxygen is present, the muscle can use it for ATP production. So the muscle starts producing more ATP, which allows it to contract again.

So H is the correct reasoning.

The question involves understanding why a frog's muscle can contract again when a closed container without oxygen is opened. The correct reasoning must explain how oxygen enables the muscle to contract.

1. **Option A**: Incorrect. The muscle does not contract due to carbon dioxide; it relies on ATP for contraction.
2. **Option B**: Incorrect. The muscle cannot contract without enough ATP.
3. **Option C**: Incorrect. The muscle cells are not reanimated by light.
4. **Option D**: Incorrect. Lactic acid is not the reason for contraction; it inhibits contraction when ATP is insufficient.
5. **Option E**: Incorrect. The muscle can contract again because oxygen enables ATP production. The presence of oxygen allows the muscle to generate more ATP, which the muscles can use for contraction.
6. **Option F**: Incorrect. The muscle does not need nitrogen for contraction.
7. **Option G**: Incorrect. Water is not introduced to enable contraction.
8. **Option H**: Correct. Oxygen enables the muscle to undergo aerobic respiration, producing more ATP, which allows the muscle to contract again.
9. **Option I**: Incorrect. Humidity does not directly cause contraction.
10. **Option J**: Incorrect. The muscle does not contract due to a new energy source; it depends on ATP production.

The correct answer is **H**, as oxygen enables the muscle to produce more ATP, which allows it to contract again.
