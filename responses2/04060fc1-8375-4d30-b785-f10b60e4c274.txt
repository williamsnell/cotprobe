Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the number of neutralizable protons in a given acid. The acid is C6H10C4, which I think is citric acid. The chemist found that 1 gram of this acid requires 0.768 grams of KOH to neutralize it completely. I need to determine how many neutralizable protons are present in the citric acid molecule.

Hmm, wait, I remember that in neutralization reactions, the acid reacts with the base in a 1:1 molar ratio. So, the number of moles of acid should equal the number of moles of KOH used. So if I can find out how many moles of KOH are involved and then relate that to the moles of the acid, that should give me the number of H+ ions that can be neutralized.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the moles of KOH used.
2. Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of KOH equal moles of acid.
3. Find the molar mass of the acid.
4. Calculate the moles of the acid.
5. Each mole of acid can neutralize a certain number of protons. For a monoprotic acid, it's one, but for polyprotic acids, it's more. Citric acid is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three H+ ions before the salt is formed.

Wait, but I'm a little confused. Oh, right, each acidic hydrogen can be neutralized by a base, but each H can contribute one H+. So, for each molecule of citric acid, it can donate three H+ ions. So, the number of neutralizable protons per mole of acid is three. But wait, how does that fit with the data given?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The reaction is between the acid and KOH. The base (KOH) will neutralize the H+ ions from the acid. If the acid is monoprotic, one H+ is neutralized per molecule. If it's diprotic, two. If it's triprotic, three. So, the number of neutralizable protons per molecule is equal to the number of H+ ions the acid can donate.

So, for example, if the acid is citric acid (C6H10COOH), the formula is C6H10C4, which is correct for it.

So, to find the number of H+ that can be neutralized, I need to determine the number of H+ per molecule, which for a triprotic acid is three. So, if each acid molecule has three H+, then each neutralization requires a KOH molecule. So, let's proceed.

Let me compute the molar mass of the acid. Let's calculate that.

The formula is C6H10C4. Wait, wait, how many C and H atoms? Let's see:

C6: 6 C atoms, each with atomic mass ~12.01 g/mol. So 6 * 12.01 = 72.06 g/mol.

H10: 10 H atoms, each 1.008, so 10 * 1.008 = 10.08 g/mol.

Wait, but wait, that's C6H10C4. Wait that's C6 (6) plus H10 (10) plus C4? Or is it C6H10C4 meaning the formula is C6H10C4? Wait, no. Wait, what's the formula of citric acid? Oh right, citric acid is C6H8O4, but wait, that's a different formula. Wait, I thought it was C6H10O4, but maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the molecular formula of citric acid. Oh, right, citric acid is C6H8O4. Wait, no. Wait, wait, citric acid is H3(C6H5O)3, which simplifies to C6H8O4. So the formula is C6H8O4.

Wait, but the question says the acid is C6H10C4. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because that has 6 C's and 4 C's? That would be 10 C's. So the formula is C10H10. Wait, but is that right? Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C6H10COOH, which would be C8H10O2.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's recheck.

Wait, the question states it's C6H10C4. So, C6H10C4 would be 6 C's from the first part, 10 H's, and 4 C's from the last part. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, perhaps it's C6H10C4 as in C6H10O4, but that's a different acid.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the given formula and compute it regardless.

Wait, assuming the formula is C6H10C4, which is C10H10. Let me proceed.

So, molecular formula: C10H10.

Molar mass calculation:

C: 12.01 * 10 = 120.1 g/mol

H: 1.008 * 10 = 10.08 g/mol

Total molar mass = 120.1 + 10.08 = 130.18 g/mol.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about the formula. Oh, wait, perhaps the correct formula is C6H8O4. Because citric acid is C6H8O4. So, let's proceed with that.

So, molar mass of citric acid (C6H8O4):

C: 6 * 12.01 = 72.06 g/mol

H: 8 * 1.008 = 8.064 g/mol

O: 4 * 16.00 = 64.00 g/mol

Total: 72.06 +8.064 =80.124 +64= 144.124 g/mol.

So about 144.12 g/mol.

Now, the problem says 1 gram of the acid reacts with 0.768 grams of KOH.

So moles of acid = mass / molar mass.

Moles of acid = 1g / 144.12 g/mol ≈ 0.006937 mol.

Since it's a neutralization reaction, 1 mole of acid reacts with 1 mole of KOH. So moles of KOH = 0.006937 mol.

But the mass of KOH is 0.768 grams. Let's compute moles of KOH:

Molar mass of KOH is:

K: 39.10, O:16.00, H:1.008.

So 39.10 +16.00 +1.008 =56.108 g/mol.

So moles of KOH = 0.768g /56.108g/mol ≈ 0.0137 mol.

Wait, but according to the reaction, moles of acid should equal moles of KOH. But in this case, moles of acid are about 0.006937, and moles of KOH are 0.0137. That's a discrepancy. That suggests that either the formula I assumed is wrong, or perhaps there's something else going on.

Wait, but wait—wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of KOH.

Wait, 0.768 grams / 56.108 g/mol = approximately 0.0137 moles. But the acid is 1g, which is about 0.006937 moles. That's 0.0137 KOH per 0.006937 acid. So the ratio is 2:1, meaning acid is 1:2 in ratio to KOH? But that can't be, because neutralization is 1:1.

Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps my assumption about the formula is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C6H10COOH? Let me check that.

C6H10COOH would be C8H12O2. Because C6 (6) + H10 (10) + COOH (2), so 6+12+2=20? Wait, no. Wait, C6H10COOH: that's C6 (from C6H10) plus COOH, which is another C (so 7 C), H10, O2. So the formula is C7H12O2.

Molar mass would be:

7 C: 7 *12.01=84.07 g/mol

12 H:12 *1.008=12.096 g/mol

2 O:32.00 g/mol

Total: 84.07 +12.096=96.166 +32=128.166 g/mol.

So if the acid is C7H12O2, then molar mass is 128.166 g/mol.

Now, moles of acid: 1g / 128.166 ≈0.0078 mol.

Moles of KOH: 0.768g /56.108g/mol ≈0.0137 mol.

So 0.0137 /0.0078 ≈1.76:1 ratio, which is not 1:1. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is something else. Wait, I'm a bit stuck on the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the given formula is C6H10C4. That's 6 C's plus 4 C's? Which would be 10 C's, but wait, that would be C10H10. So the formula would be C10H10.

Molar mass: C10H10.

C:10*12.01=120.1

H:10*1.008=10.08

Total:130.18 g/mol.

So, moles of acid: 1g /130.18 ≈0.007685 mol.

Moles of KOH:0.768/56.108 ≈0.0137 mol.

Ratio: 0.0137 /0.007685 ≈1.78, which is still not 1. So that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps I need to reevaluate the formula. Alternatively, maybe citric acid is C6H8O4, which would make the formula C6H8O4. Let's compute that.

Molar mass: C6 (72.06) + H8 (8.064) + O4 (64) → 72.06 +8.064=80.124 +64=144.124 g/mol.

Moles of acid = 1g /144.124 ≈0.006937 mol.

Moles of KOH:0.768g /56.108 ≈0.0137.

Ratio is 0.0137 /0.006937 ≈1.98. So approx 2:1 ratio. Not 1:1.

Hmm, so perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe the question meant something else, like a different acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the acid is something else, like vitamin C, which is also C6H8O4. Oh, wait, so the same formula as citric acid. But in that case, the same problem arises.

Wait, but the question says the acid is C6H10C4. Maybe I should accept that and proceed.

Wait, but based on my calculations, the acid and KOH ratio is about 2:1, which can't be correct for neutralization. So perhaps the formula is incorrect, or maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick and the correct answer is based on the number of protons without considering the formula. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the acid is triprotic, so each molecule can donate three H+.

So, the number of neutralizable protons would be 3 per molecule.

But how does that tie into the data given?

Wait, if 1g of acid requires 0.768g KOH, which is 0.006937 mol acid, then 0.006937 mol KOH. So the acid is 1:1 ratio. So, the acid can donate how many H+?

Wait, but if the acid is triprotic, then 3 H+ per molecule. So 0.006937 mol acid would require 0.006937 *3 =0.0208 moles H+.

But wait, the KOH is 0.006937 mol. So each mole of KOH can neutralize one mole of H+.

So, the number of moles of H+ neutralized is equal to the moles of KOH, which is 0.006937.

But if the acid is triprotic, each acid molecule can donate three H+.

So, the number of neutralizable protons per acid molecule is three. So the total number of H+ is 3 * moles of acid → 3 * 0.006937=0.0208. That's equal to the KOH moles, which is correct.

So, regardless of the formula, the number of neutralizable protons would be three per molecule.

Therefore, the correct answer is three, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck because I'm not quite confident about the formula. But the question provides the number of neutralizable protons in the acid, which is based on the acid's structure. Since the acid is triprotic, the number is three.
</think>

To determine the number of neutralizable protons in the given acid, we analyze the reaction between the acid and KOH. In a neutralization reaction, the acid donates protons (H⁺ ions) to the base (KOH), which accepts them to form water. For a triprotic acid, one molecule can donate three H⁺ ions before neutralization begins.

The problem states that 1 gram of the acid reacts with 0.768 grams of KOH. Using the given formula (C₆H₁₀C₄, interpreted as C₆H₁₀O₄, which corresponds to citric acid), the molar mass is calculated as:

- C: 6 × 12.01 = 72.06 g/mol  
- H: 10 × 1.008 = 10.08 g/mol  
- O: 4 × 16.00 = 64.00 g/mol  

Total molar mass = 72.06 + 10.08 + 64.00 = **144.14 g/mol**.

The moles of the acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acid} = \frac{\text{Mass of acid}}{\text{Molar mass of acid}} = \frac{1 \, \text{g}}{144.14 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.006937 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction is 1:1, the moles of KOH used are also 0.006937 mol. The molar mass of KOH is:

- K: 39.10 g/mol  
- O: 16.00 g/mol  
- H: 1.008 g/mol  

Total molar mass = 39.10 + 16.00 + 1.008 = **56.108 g/mol**.

The moles of KOH are:

\[
\text{Moles of KOH} = \frac{\text{Mass of KOH}}{\text{Molar mass of KOH}} = \frac{0.768 \, \text{g}}{56.108 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.0137 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The discrepancy in the ratio (0.0137 mol KOH / 0.006937 mol acid ≈ 2:1) suggests that the formula provided (C₆H₁₀C₄) might not correspond to citric acid, which has a different formula (C₆H₈O₄). However, assuming the formula is correct and proceeding with the given data, the acid is triprotic, meaning each molecule can donate three H⁺ ions.

Thus, the number of neutralizable protons in the acid is **3 per molecule**, consistent with the triprotic nature of the acid.
