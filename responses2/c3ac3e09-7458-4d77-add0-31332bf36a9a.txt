Question:

Connie Computer decided to purchase a $1,000 laptop computer to use during law school. When she went into Computer Retailer Inc., the salesperson also sold her a 5-year service agreement for $1,200 for a total price of $2,200. Nine months later, the laptop stopped working and Computer Retailer refused to perform on their service agreement. If Connie sues Computer Retailer, the trial court will likely find for

Options:

A: Computer Retailer, under the UCC unless the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the service portion of the contract.
B: Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.
C: Connie, under the common law unless the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the service portion of the contract.
D: Computer Retailer, only if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the contract was for the goods portion of the contract.
E: Connie, under the common law because the predominate purpose for which the parties contracted was the sale of goods.
F: Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by intent and not the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement.
G: Connie, under the UCC only if the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the goods portion of the contract.
H: Computer Retailer, under the common law if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.
I: Connie, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement.
J: Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the service agreement was not a significant part of the contract.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically about the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and common law principles. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about Connie Computer purchasing a laptop from Computer Retailer, but Computer Retailer also sold her a service agreement. The laptop stopped working, causing Computer Retailer to refuse to perform on the service agreement. Connie sues, and we're supposed to determine who would win under the UCC or common law.

I remember that under UCC, the intent to sell goods matters more than the intent to perform a service agreement. The UCC rule is that the primary intent was to sell goods, unless the service aspect is deemed significant. So, the question is whether the service agreement is significant enough to override the intent to sell goods.

Looking at the options, the key point is whether the service agreement is a significant part of the contract. The UCC treats the service aspect as significant if it's more than 20% of the contract. So, in this case, Connie bought a laptop for $1,000, and the service agreement was $1,200 in total. That's a service aspect of $1,200, which is 12% of the total contract ($2,200). Wait, wait, noâ€”the total contract is $2,200, but the service is $1,200, which is part of the service agreement. So the service part is 12% of the total, not the service agreement part.

Wait, the service agreement is $1,200. So the total contract is $2,200. 1,200 / 2,200 is approximately 54.5%. So the service part is more than half of the contract. Under UCC, service is deemed significant if it's more than 20% of the contract. So 54.5% is much more than 20%, so the service aspect is significant.

So, under UCC, the primary intent to enter into the contract was for the goods (the laptop), unless the service is deemed significant. If the service aspect is significant, then the goods' intent is overridden. So Connie would win, because under UCC, the service agreement is deemed significant, so the primary intent was to sell goods.

Looking at the options, option B says Connie under UCC unless the service agreement was for the service part. So if the service is significant, Connie wins, so B is correct. 

Option F says that Connie wins if the purpose is determined by intent, not dollars. But the UCC's rule is based on the contract's intent, not just the dollars. So F is not correct because the UCC's rule is about intent, not the relative dollar amounts. 

Options C and E talk about common law, which is less likely because the question is about UCC issues. So I can eliminate them.

So the correct answer should be B.

The question revolves around a contract between Connie Computer and Computer Retailer, where Connie buys a laptop and also agrees to a service agreement for $1,200. Connie sues Computer Retailer, and the trial court must determine who wins under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or common law.

Under the UCC, the primary intent to enter into the contract was for the sale of goods unless the service aspect is deemed significant. The service agreement is deemed significant if it constitutes more than 20% of the contract. In this case, the service agreement is $1,200, which is 12% of the total contract amount ($2,200). However, the service aspect is more than half of the contract, and under UCC, service is deemed significant if it exceeds 20%, so Connie would win.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** correctly states that Connie would win under the UCC unless the service agreement was for the service portion, aligning with the UCC's rule.
- **Option F** incorrectly applies common law principles, which are irrelevant here since the question focuses on UCC rules.
- **Option C and E** discuss common law, which is not applicable.
- **Options A, D, and J** involve different scenarios not relevant to this case.
- **Option H** incorrectly applies common law, while the correct approach is UCC.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.

Answer: B
