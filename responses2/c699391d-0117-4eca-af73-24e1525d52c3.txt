Okay, so I need to compute the covariance of two sets of data, x and y. The x values are (1,2,3,4) and the y values are (2,3,4,5). Hmm, I remember that covariance measures how much two variables change together. But wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, covariance is the average of the products of the deviations of each variable from their respective means.

So, the formula is: 

Cov(x, y) = (1/n) * Σ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)]

I think that's correct. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to find the mean of x and the mean of y.

Calculating the mean of x: (1+2+3+4)/4 = 10/4 = 2.5.

Mean of y: (2+3+4+5)/4 = 14/4 = 3.5.

Then, for each data point, I'll subtract the mean from x and y, multiply them, and then sum all those products. Finally, divide by the number of data points, which is 4.

Let's list out the calculations:

1. For the first data point (x=1, y=2):
   (1 - 2.5) = -1.5
   (2 - 3.5) = -1.5
   Product: (-1.5)*(-1.5) = 2.25

2. Second data point (x=2, y=3):
   (2 - 2.5) = -0.5
   (3 - 3.5) = -0.5
   Product: (-0.5)*(-0.5) = 0.25

3. Third data point (x=3, y=4):
   (3 - 2.5) = 0.5
   (4 - 3.5) = 0.5
   Product: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25

4. Fourth data point (x=4, y=5):
   (4 - 2.5) = 1.5
   (5 - 3.5) = 1.5
   Product: 1.5 * 1.5 = 2.25

Now, sum all these products: 2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 = 5. So, the sum is 5.

Then, divide by n=4: 5/4 = 1.25.

Wait, but the options don't have 1.25 as an answer. Let me check again. Hmm, the options are A) 0.50, B)2.00, C)3.00, D)0.75, E)1.25, F)1.67, G)1.00, H)0.98, I)2.50, J)2.34.

So option E is 1.25. So the covariance is 1.25. But wait, I thought the answer could be higher. Did I do something wrong? Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, another thought: sometimes covariance is calculated using the formula with sample data, which uses n-1 instead of n. Oh wait, wait, but the problem didn't specify whether it's sample covariance or population covariance. The formula I used is for population covariance since it divides by n. 

Wait, let me recheck all steps again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me redo each step to make sure.

First, the means are correct: x_mean=2.5, y_mean=3.5.

Now, each (xi - x_mean):

x1=1: 1-2.5=-1.5

x2=2: -0.5

x3=3: +0.5

x4=4: +1.5

Same for y.

Now, the products:

1st product: (-1.5)(-1.5) = 2.25

2nd: (-0.5)(-0.5) = 0.25

3rd: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25

4th: 1.5 *1.5=2.25

Sum: 2.25+0.25=2.5; +0.25=2.75; +2.25=5. So yes, sum is 5. Average is 5/4=1.25.

But the options don't have 1.25. Wait, looking again, option E is 1.25, so that's the correct answer. So the covariance is 1.25, which is option E.

To compute the covariance of x = (1, 2, 3, 4) and y = (2, 3, 4, 5), we use the formula:

Cov(x, y) = (1/n) * Σ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)]

1. **Calculate the means:**
   - x_mean = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4 = 2.5
   - y_mean = (2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 3.5

2. **Compute the deviations and products:**
   - For each data point:
     - (1 - 2.5)(2 - 3.5) = (-1.5)(-1.5) = 2.25
     - (2 - 2.5)(3 - 3.5) = (-0.5)(-0.5) = 0.25
     - (3 - 2.5)(4 - 3.5) = (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25
     - (4 - 2.5)(5 - 3.5) = (1.5)(1.5) = 2.25
   - Sum of products: 2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 = 5

3. **Average the products:**
   - Cov(x, y) = 5 / 4 = 1.25

4. **Match the result to the options:**
   - The calculated covariance is 1.25, which corresponds to option E.
