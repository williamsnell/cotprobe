Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about a chain of events leading to someone getting sick with the flu after their studies. Let me break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that Conrad made a study schedule and started reviewing notes two weeks before finals. Then he was studying hard each day. But right after finals, at the start of summer vacation, he got sick with the flu. I'm supposed to figure out which theory best explains this.

The question has options from A to J, each corresponding to different psychological theories. Let me think about each of these theories to see which fits.

Option A: Erikson's stages of psychosocial development. This is about character development through social and psychological growth. That doesn't directly explain an acute illness like flu, which is more about the body's reaction to stress. Not sure, but maybe not the best fit.

Option B: Thorndike's law of effect. This is about how responses are conditioned based on their consequences. Like, after a successful study session, you get more. But the flu probably isn't a direct result of how he studied. It's more about his body's reaction rather than his behavior.

Option C: Selye's general adaptation syndrome. This is about how new experiences shape the body's and mind's responses. It's about the body's reactions to life changes, like moving. Flu is a common illness, so this could fit. It explains why someone might get sick after a change, like moving to a new place.

Option D: Yerkes-Dodson law. This says that there's an optimal level of arousal for performance. So if someone is under stress, their performance is best when they're at a certain level. But here, it's not about performance; it's about a sudden illness. I'm not sure if this explains the sudden onset of flu.

Option E: Bandura's social learning theory. This is about learning through observation and modeling. So if someone follows a person's behavior, they might get the flu. But the question is about the immediate cause after the change in living conditions, not about what they do after seeing someone else.

Option F: Freud's psychosexual stages. That's more about sexual development and how people respond to changes in their environment. Again, this seems more about how someone might react to stress, but it's not directly explaining why the flu started.

Option G: Pavlov's classical conditioning. This is about conditioning through rewards and punishments. Not directly related to the sudden illness, so probably not the best fit.

Option H: Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory. This is about balancing desires with what's understandable. It's about why people resist changes, but again, not directly explaining a sudden health issue.

Option I: Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This is about achieving basic physiological and psychological needs. It's more about why someone likes to study, but the question is about getting sick after finals.

Option J: Piaget's stages of cognitive development. This is about how a child's thinking grows. Not directly related to physical health or illness.

So, narrowing it down, the best fit seems to be C, Selye's general adaptation syndrome. It explains how the body's responses to stress or sudden changes (like moving) can cause an acute illness like the flu. That fits the scenario where after the change (graduation and summer vacation), the body adapts in a certain way, leading to the flu.

The best explanation for the sudden flu after finals is best captured by Selye's general adaptation syndrome, which explains how the body adapts to stressors, leading to acute illnesses like the flu.

Answer: C
