Question:

The average concentration of particulate lead in a city with highly polluted air is 5\mug/m^3. If an adult respires 8500 liters of air daily and if 50 per cent of the particles below 1\mumin size are retained in the lungs, calculate how much lead is absorbed in the lungs each day. Of the particu-late lead in urban air, 75 per cent is less than 1\mumin size.

Options:

A: 6.4 μg
B: 25.0 μg
C: 30.0 μg
D: 8.5\mug
E: 10.6 μg
F: 21.3 μg
G: 42.5\mug
H: 15.9\mug
I: 37.5\mug
J: 12.7 μg

Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the amount of lead absorbed in the lungs by an adult each day. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to gather all the given data. The average concentration of particulate lead is 5 μg/m³. The person respires 8500 liters of air daily. Oh wait, wait. Wait a minute, the units here are a bit confusing. The concentration is in μg/m³, but the air intake is in liters. I need to make sure the units are compatible.

Oh right, I remember that 1 m³ is equal to 1000 liters. So, 1 m³ = 1000 liters. That means if the concentration is 5 μg per m³, then per liter it would be 5 μg / 1000 = 0.005 μg per liter. That makes sense.

So, the person respires 8500 liters. So, the total lead in the air they breathe each day would be 8500 liters * 0.005 μg/liter. Let's calculate that: 8500 * 0.005. Hmm, 8500 * 0.005 is 42.5 μg. Oh wait, because 85 * 5 is 425, so 42.5. Yeah, that's correct.

But wait, the question is about how much is absorbed in the lungs. Oh right, 50% of the particles below 1 μm are retained in the lungs. So, the other 50% is absorbed. So, the absorption would be 50% of the total lead in air.

So, let's compute 50% of 42.5 μg. That's 21.25 μg. Looking at the options, option F is 21.3 μg. That matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. So, 8500 liters times 5 μg/m³ is 42.5 μg. Since 50% is retained, 50% absorbed. 42.5 * 0.5 = 21.25, which rounds to 21.3. So option F is correct.

To calculate the amount of lead absorbed in the lungs, we start with the given data:

1. **Concentration of particulate lead**: 5 μg/m³.
2. **Respiratory air intake**: 8500 liters/day.
3. **Conversion of concentration to μg/liter**: 1 m³ = 1000 liters, so 5 μg/m³ = 0.005 μg/liter.
4. **Total lead in air**:  
   \[
   8500 \, \text{liters/day} \times 0.005 \, \text{μg/liter} = 42.5 \, \text{μg/day}.
   \]
5. **Absorption efficiency**: 50% of particles below 1 μm are retained, so 50% is absorbed.  
   \[
   42.5 \, \text{μg/day} \times 0.5 = 21.25 \, \text{μg/day}.
   \]

Rounding to one decimal place, the absorbed lead is approximately **21.3 μg/day**. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is **F: 21.3 μg**.

Answer: F
