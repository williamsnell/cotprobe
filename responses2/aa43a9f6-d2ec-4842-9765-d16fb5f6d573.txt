Question:

A businessman was the owner of an idyllic lake and wooded area. In 1980, the businessman conveyed the land to the state "on the condition that" it be used as recreational property only. Two years later, the state decided that they wanted a small industrial park attached to the corner of the land. The state went ahead and developed a small portion of the land as industrial space, making it part of a larger industrial park that was adjacent to the land. The businessman notified the state that he was the owner of the property because the state violated the conditions of the conveyance, and that he was taking possession of the property back. What was the interest that was created by the conveyance and can the businessman get the property back?

Options:

A: The interest created is an indefeasible estate, and the owner cannot do anything to enforce a condition that is against public policy and never enforceable in the first place.
B: The interest created is a life estate, and the property will revert back to the businessman only after the life tenant's death.
C: The interest created is a reverter, and the property instantly reverts back to the grantor upon the occurrence of the specified violation.
D: The interest created is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and the original owner can get the property back only by taking affirmative steps to exercise his right of entry.
E: The interest created is a leasehold estate, and the businessman can reclaim the property only after the lease period ends.
F: The interest is a remainder, and the property will only revert back to the original owner after the state's interest ends.
G: The interest created is an easement, and the businessman has no right to reclaim the property but can prevent the state from using it for industrial purposes.
H: The interest is a fee simple subject to an executory limitation, and if the condition occurs the property reverts in fee simple to a pre-designated third party.
I: The interest created is a fee simple absolute, and the owner cannot reclaim the property as it now completely belongs to the state.
J: The interest is a fee simple determinable, and the property instantly reverts back to the businessman upon violation of the condition.

Okay, so I need to figure out this property law question. Let's go through it step by step. 

The question is about a conveyance condition that the owner must fulfill. The setup is that a businessman owns a piece of land as the owner of the idyllic lake and wooded area. In 1980, he conveys it to the state with a condition: "on the condition that it be used as recreational property only." Two years later, the state wants an industrial park attached. They develop part of it, making it part of a larger industrial park. The businessman tells the state he's the owner now because the state violated the condition.

The question is about what interest the state created, and whether the businessman can reclaim the property.

First, I remember that conditions in conveyances can create different interests. The main types are executory, limitation, executory limitation, fee simple subject to condition, etc.

In this case, the state says the land must be recreational only. So, if it's used for industrial purposes, that's against the condition. So, the state violated the condition. That means the state has a right to reclaim the land if the condition is violated.

What interests are created? The state probably created a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. This is because the condition is a limitation that is breached, so the state can take possession or revert.

Now, looking at the options:

Option I says it's a fee simple absolute, meaning it's completely belong to the state. But wait, the condition is a limitation, not absolute. So I think the right is fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, not absolute.

Option J says it's a fee simple determinable, which means the property reverts immediately if the condition is violated. So that would be a definite fee, but I'm not sure if determinable applies here. Determinable is usually for sure events, like a fixed fee with a future possibility of reversion.

Wait, what's a determinable fee? I think it's a fee that reverts only if a specific event occurs, like a certain time passing. But in this case, the condition is a breach, not a future event. So perhaps not J.

So back to the options. The state created a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. So the interest is this type.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: Life estate. No, because the condition is a restriction, not a future interest.

Option D: Fee simple subject to condition subsequent. That's what I thought.

Option H: Fee simple subject to executory limitation. Wait, no, the condition in the conveyance is that it's recreational only, so it's a limitation. So it's a condition subsequent.

So, the state's interest is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. So, when the condition is violated, the state can take possession or have it reverts.

So, who can reclaim? The state can take possession, but the question is whether the businessman can get it back. If the state can take it back, then the state has rights, but the option says "the businessman can get the property back only by taking affirmative steps."

Wait, no, in a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the condition is a limitation. So if the condition is breached, the state can take the property. But the state is the one who breached it. So the state can reclaim. However, the option is whether the businessman can get back the property. So the state's right is to take it back, so he can reclaim. So the option D says that the state's right is fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and the owner can reclaim only by affirmative steps.

Wait, no, the condition is a limitation, so if the condition is violated, the state can take possession. But does the state have the right to take it back, and can the state reclaim it?

Wait, the state's interest is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. So, the state's interest is that upon breach, the condition is satisfied, so the state can take it back. But the state is the one who conveyed it, so they have the right to take it back. So the state can reclaim it, and the option D says that the state's right is fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and the owner can get it back only by taking affirmative steps. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. When a condition is present in a conveyance, the interest is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. This means that the fee is subject to a subsequent condition. So the grantor (businessman) gave the state the land, but stipulated that it must be used only for recreational purposes. If it's used for industrial, the state has a condition to take it back. So the state has a right to take the property if the condition is violated.

So, when the condition is violated, the state can take possession. But the state is the one creating the interest. So the state can reclaim the property. So the state's right is a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.

Looking at the options, the correct one should reflect this. 

Looking back:

Option D says the interest is fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and the owner can get the property back only by affirmative steps. That sounds correct because the state can reclaim if the condition is violated.

Wait, but what about the options? Let me check each option:

Option I: It's a fee simple absolute. No, because the condition is a limitation, not absolute.

Option J: Fee simple determinable. That's a fee that reverts immediately. So if it's a determinable fee, the reversion happens immediately, but here the condition is only breached if it's not recreational. So the reversion would be upon breach. So a determinable fee is different.

Option G: easement. No, because it's a condition that is a restriction, not an easement.

Option E: Leasehold estate. No, because it's not a lease.

Option A: Indefeasible estate. No, because the condition is a limitation, so the state can take it back.

Option C: Reverter. No, because the condition is a limitation, not a reversion. Reverts are for conditions that are future or certain.

So the correct option is either B, D, or H.

Option B: Life estate. No, the condition is a limitation, not a future interest.

Option D: Fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Yes, that's correct.

Option H: Fee simple subject to executory limitation. No, because the condition is a limitation, not an executory limitation.

So the correct answer is option D.

The correct answer is **D: The interest created is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and the original owner can get the property back only by taking affirmative steps to exercise his right of entry.**

### Explanation:
The conveyance created a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. This means that the grantor (businessman) gave the state the property but stipulated that it must be recreational. If the condition is violated (used for industrial purposes), the state has a right to reclaim the property. The state's right to reclaim is not limited to taking possession; it also allows the state to exercise affirmative rights to take possession. The original owner cannot reclaim the property without the state's permission, as the condition is a limitation that the state has a right to enforce.
