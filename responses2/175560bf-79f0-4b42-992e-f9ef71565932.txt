Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about how U.S. net exports affect the value of the dollar and the yen as the Japanese economy expands. The table lists the changes in value of the dollar, yen, and net exports, and the options are A to J, each with different combinations.

Hmm, I remember that exchange rates and net exports are related, especially in the context of trade and international economics. So, when a country's economy expands, it's probably affecting how others trade with it.

The question is specifically about U.S. net exports. Net exports are the difference between a country's exports and imports. So, if the U.S. has positive net exports, it's selling more than it's buying, which might increase its trade balance.

Now, when a country's economy is expanding, the U.S. might need more yen to import goods that cost more in the U.S. So, if the U.S. economy is expanding, it might need more yen to buy those imports. Let me think: if the U.S. needs more yen, that would mean that the yen's value is strengthening. Because to buy the same amount of goods, you'd need more yen. So, the value of the yen increases.

Wait, but what about the dollar? If the U.S. is importing more, but maybe its own production is expanding, so it could use more dollar inputs. Let's say the U.S. is producing more, so it needs more resources, which might require more dollar products. But if the U.S. is also importing more, maybe it's using dollar inputs and needs dollar labor. For example, if the U.S. is producing more, it might need more labor, which would require more dollars. So, if net exports (which is what's being exported minus what's imported) increase, the U.S. might be importing more, which would require more dollars. So, the value of the dollar increases.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The value of the dollar is determined by the purchasing power. If the dollar is getting stronger, then people are willing to buy more dollars for the same amount of foreign currency. So, if the U.S. is importing more, it might need more dollars. That would mean that the dollar's value increases because it's stronger.

But what about the yen? The yen is used by the Japanese economy. So, if the U.S. is importing more yen to buy its imports, the value of the yen would increase because people can buy more yen with the same amount of dollars. So, yen's value would increase as well.

Wait, but the question is about how net exports affect the value of the dollar and yen. So, perhaps if U.S. net exports increase, the dollar's value increases, and the yen's value increases as well.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to break it down.

When the U.S. has positive net exports (so it's exporting more than it imports), it's a good thing for the U.S. economy. But if the U.S. economy is expanding, it's also expanding its trade relations. So, maybe the U.S. is importing more. So, for the U.S., to import more, it might need more inputs, which could be U.S. dollars. So, U.S. exports would increase, but the U.S. would be importing more, which would require more dollars. So, the value of the dollar would increase.

As for the yen, the U.S. imports more yen (because it's buying more), so the yen's value would increase because more yen are being used to buy the same amount of goods. So, the value of the yen increases.

So, in terms of the table, U.S. net exports increase, so dollar and yen values increase.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I says Decrease, Increase, Increase. That's option I. But I'm a bit unsure because maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, think about the exchange rate: when the U.S. has positive net exports, it's selling more than it's buying. So, the U.S. can export more, which would increase the demand for U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market. So, the dollar's value would appreciate, meaning it becomes stronger. So, the value of the dollar increases. But for the yen, the U.S. is importing more, which could mean that the yen is becoming more expensive for the U.S. So, the value of the yen would increase as well.

Wait another angle: if net exports increase, it's because the U.S. is producing more and exporting more. Suppose the U.S. is an exporter. So, if net exports increase, more dollars are being exported. So, the dollar's value increases because more dollars are being sold. But the yen is a foreign currency used by the Japanese. So, if the U.S. is importing more yen (because it's buying more), the yen's value increases because you can buy more yen with the same amount of dollars. So the yen's value increases.

Wait, but the question is about the value of the dollar and yen. So, if U.S. net exports increase, the dollar's value increases, and the yen's value increases.

Wait, but the options are combinations. Let me look at the options again.

Option I: Decrease, Increase, Increase.

So, if U.S. net exports increase, then dollar and yen values increase. So option I says Increase, Increase, Increase. But option I is: Decrease, Increase, Increase. So that's not matching.

Wait, wait. Maybe I got it flipped. Let me think again. If U.S. net exports increase, meaning more is exported than imported. So, the U.S. can export more, which would make the dollar stronger. But the U.S. is also importing more, which would require more inputs, perhaps U.S. dollars. So, U.S. imports more, so the yen's value increases.

Wait, no. The U.S. is importing more yen because it's buying more yen. So, the value of the yen increases.

But looking at the options, option G: Increase, Decrease, Increase.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the exchange rate effect. When a country's economy is expanding, it might need more of its own currency to import more goods. For example, if the U.S. economy is expanding and it's importing more U.S. goods, it might need more U.S. dollars to do so. So, the U.S. exports more, so the dollar's value increases. But the yen is used by the Japanese economy. If the U.S. is importing more yen, the yen's value would increase because more yen are needed to buy the same amount of goods. So, the value of the dollar increases, and the yen's value increases.

Wait, but that would mean that both the dollar and yen's values increase. Looking at the options, which option has both values increase?

Looking at the options: I is Decrease, Increase, Increase. So, that's what I thought. But wait, in the options, perhaps the way it's presented is the change in each variable. So, if U.S. net exports increase, then the dollar's value increases, yen's value increases, and net exports increase.

So, the table would have U.S. net exports as increasing, dollar's value as increasing, yen's value as increasing.

But looking at the options, option G: Increase, Decrease, Increase. No, that's wrong because both dollar and yen are increasing.

Option F: No Change, Increase, Decrease. No, because net exports increase.

Option H: Increase, No Change, Decrease. No, because both dollar and yen should increase.

Option I: Decrease, Increase, Increase. No, because net exports are increasing, so it's not a decrease. So, I is not correct.

So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the U.S. net exports increasing would cause the dollar to depreciate. No, that doesn't make sense. If the U.S. is exporting more, more dollars would be sold, so the dollar is stronger, meaning the dollar appreciates.

Wait, the exchange rate effect: when the U.S. exports more, the demand for U.S. dollars increases, so the value of the dollar increases (appreciates). Conversely, when the U.S. imports more, the demand for foreign currencies (like yen) increases. So, the value of the yen increases as well.

So, if net exports increase, the dollar and yen both increase in value.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where both are increases. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: Decrease, Increase, Decrease

B: Increase, Increase, Increase

C: Decrease, No Change, Increase

D: Increase, Increase, Decrease

E: Decrease, Decrease, Increase

F: No Change, Increase, Decrease

G: Increase, Decrease, Increase

H: Increase, No Change, Decrease

I: Decrease, Increase, Increase

J: Decrease, Decrease, Decrease

So, the correct answer should have both the dollar and yen values increase. Looking at the options, option B is Increase, Increase, Increase. But wait, looking at the options again, option I is Decrease, Increase, Increase. No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check the question again.

The question is, as the Japanese economy expands, how do U.S. net exports affect the values of the dollar and yen.

Wait, so if the Japanese economy is expanding, perhaps the U.S. is also expanding, so it might be more productive, leading to more imports. So, if U.S. net exports increase (more exports than imports), the dollar's value increases, and the yen's value increases.

But if the U.S. net exports increase, then the dollar's value appreciates, the yen's value also appreciates. So, the correct answer should be the dollar and yen both increase. Looking at the options, option B is Increase, Increase, Increase. So, that's option B.

Wait, but I thought option I was the correct choice. Let me see the options again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the U.S. is a net exporter. So, if net exports increase, which is more of the U.S. goods than it imports, the dollar will appreciate because the U.S. exports more. But for the yen, the U.S. is importing more, so the yen's value increases.

So, both dollar and yen increase, so option B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the exchange rate is affected in both ways.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: when net exports increase, it's when the U.S. is producing more and exporting more. So, for the U.S., the value of the dollar increases. But for the yen, which is used by the Japanese, if the U.S. is importing more yen, then yen's value increases.

But the options don't have an option where both are increasing and net exports is increasing. Looking again:

The question's table is:

U.S.NET EXPERTURES   VALUE OF DOLLAR   VALUE OF YEN

So, as U.S. net exports increase, the value of the dollar increases and the yen increases. So, the dollar and yen both increase.

Looking at the options, option B is Increase, Increase, Increase. So, that's option B.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the yen would decrease. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the exchange rate effect is different. Let's think: when a country's economy is expanding, it needs more inputs, which could be more dollars in the U.S. So, the dollar's value increases. The U.S. imports more, so more yen are needed, so the yen's value increases.

So, yes, both the dollar and yen increase. So, option B says Increase, Increase, Increase.

But wait, looking at the options again, option I is Decrease, Increase, Increase. No, that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the relationship backwards. Let's think about the exchange rate. If the U.S. is exporting more, the dollar is more valuable, so the dollar increases. But for the yen, if the U.S. is importing more, that means more yen are needed to buy the same amount of goods. So, the yen's value increases because more yen are needed to buy the same amount. So, yes, both increase.

So, the correct answer is the one where both the dollar and yen's values increase. Looking at the options, option B is Increase, Increase, Increase.

Wait, but the options are labeled as:

A: Decrease, Increase, Decrease

B: Increase, Increase, Increase

C: Decrease, No Change, Increase

D: Increase, Increase, Decrease

E: Decrease, Decrease, Increase

F: No Change, Increase, Decrease

G: Increase, Decrease, Increase

H: Increase, No Change, Decrease

I: Decrease, Increase, Increase

J: Decrease, Decrease, Decrease

So, the correct answer is option I? No, because net exports are increasing. So, I is incorrect.

Wait, no, the correct answer would be option I if net exports were decreasing. Because in option I, U.S. net exports are decreasing, so the dollar and yen would decrease. But the question says the U.S. net exports increase as the Japanese economy expands. So, in that case, the dollar and yen should increase.

Wait, but looking back, maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think again. The U.S. net export is the difference between exports and imports. So, when net exports increase, the U.S. is exporting more than it's importing. So, the U.S. can export more, which would mean that more dollars are being sold, so the value of the dollar increases.

But for the yen, the U.S. is importing more, so it needs more yen to buy those imports. Therefore, the value of the yen increases.

So, both the dollar and yen increase, which corresponds to option B.

But I'm also getting confused because I thought maybe the yen's value might decrease. Wait, no. Because the U.S. is importing more, so the value of the yen increases. So, the yen is stronger.

So, the correct option is option B: Increase, Increase, Increase.

Wait, but looking again, the options are presented as:

A: Decrease, Increase, Decrease

B: Increase, Increase, Increase

C: Decrease, No Change, Increase

D: Increase, Increase, Decrease

E: Decrease, Decrease, Increase

F: No Change, Increase, Decrease

G: Increase, Decrease, Increase

H: Increase, No Change, Decrease

I: Decrease, Increase, Increase

J: Decrease, Decrease, Decrease

So, the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because I thought maybe the yen's value would decrease. Let me see: If the U.S. is importing more yen, the yen becomes more expensive for the U.S., so the value of the yen increases. So, yes, it's correct.

So, the answer is option B.

The question examines the impact of U.S. net exports on the value of the dollar and yen as the Japanese economy expands. Here's the analysis:

1. **Net Exports and the Dollar**:  
   - When U.S. net exports increase, the U.S. exports more than it imports. This leads to an increase in the demand for U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market. As a result, the value of the dollar appreciates (increases).

2. **Net Exports and the Yen**:  
   - The yen is a foreign currency used by the Japanese economy. If U.S. net exports increase, it implies that the U.S. is importing more goods and services. This increase in imports requires more U.S. dollars, which means the dollar's value rises. However, since the U.S. is importing more yen, the yen's value also increases because more yen are needed to purchase the same amount of goods.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   - Both the dollar and yen values increase as a result of U.S. net exports increasing. This aligns with **Option B: Increase, Increase, Increase**.
