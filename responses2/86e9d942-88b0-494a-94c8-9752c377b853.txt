Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to think it through. Hmm. The question is about cooling and freezing water. Let me read it again.

So, the problem says that water can be cooled to T = -10°C. They want to find the mass of ice (m) formed when 1 kg of supercooled water is placed into it. A particle of ice is thrown in, which freezes, producing the ice. And they mention to regard the specific heat of supercooled water as independent of temperature and equal to that of ordinary water. The options are various masses in grams, like 80g up to 225g, I think.

Wait, I remember that supercooled water is still water but at a lower temperature, so when you add ice, it freezes, and some of the water turns into ice. The process involves heat exchange, right? So the ice and the water will reach the same final temperature, which is probably at equilibrium.

Let me think about the concepts. When you mix ice and water, the heat lost by the water (which is getting cold) equals the heat gained by the ice (which is getting warm). But wait, wait. Wait, no: the ice is at 0°C, and the water is supercooled, say at -10°C. So the ice is at 0, water at -10. So the ice will absorb heat from the water, causing the water to cool down to 0°C, and then the ice will melt, but wait, no—wait, the ice is being thrown into the water. So the water is supercooled, so when it freezes, it becomes ice at 0°C. Or, maybe, the ice is at 0°C, and the water is at -10°C. So when you add the ice to the water, the water will first cool down to 0°C, and then the ice will melt, but wait, no, because the ice is thrown in, so it's already at 0°C. So the water will lose heat as it cools to 0°C, and then the ice, which is at 0°C, will absorb that heat.

Wait, but wait—no, that's not right. Because the ice is at 0°C, and the water is at -10°C, so the water will lose heat, which will cause it to rise to 0°C, and then the ice will absorb that heat to melt, right? Because the ice is at 0°C. So the process is: water cools from -10 to 0; then, the ice melts, getting warmer from 0 to 0. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the ice is at 0 and the water is at 0—so no temperature change. So the water cools to 0, then the ice melts. Or perhaps, the entire process is that the ice, when placed into the supercooled water, causes the water to reach 0°C, and the ice to melt.

Wait, but in this case, the water is already supercooled, so when you add the ice, it will lower the water's temperature and cause the ice to melt. So the final state is 0°C water and some ice.

But wait, perhaps more accurately: the supercooled water is at -10°C. It's in a container, and then you add ice (which is at 0°C). The ice will absorb heat from the water, causing the water to cool down to 0°C. At 0°C, the ice can absorb heat to melt into water, but since the water is already at 0 and the ice is the same temperature, the ice doesn't change temperature. So the ice will absorb heat to melt, but the water will cool down from -10 to 0.

Wait, but wait: the water is 1 kg, and we're adding m grams of ice. So the mass of the ice is m grams. So the mass of ice is m, and the mass of water is 1000g (since 1 kg is 1000 grams). 

So, the heat lost by the water is equal to the heat gained by the ice. Let's write the equation.

Heat lost by water = Heat gained by ice.

Heat lost by water (Q_water) = m_water * c_water * (T_final - T_initial_water)

Heat gained by ice (Q_ice) = m_ice * c_water * (T_final - T_initial_ice) + m_ice * Lf (where Lf is the latent heat of fusion)

Wait, but wait: No, because the ice is at 0°C, and the water is also at 0°C. So the ice doesn't change temperature. So T_final = 0°C. 

So, Q_water = m_water * c_water * (0 - (-10)) = m_water * c_water * 10.

Q_ice = m_ice * c_water * (0 - 0) + m_ice * Lf = 0 + m_ice * Lf.

So, Q_water = Q_ice. So,

m_water * c_water * 10 = m_ice * Lf

Wait, but wait, that might not be correct. Because the ice is at 0°C, and the water was at -10°C. So the ice melting would require that the heat from the water (which has cooled to 0) is used to melt the ice.

Wait, but wait, the water is at -10, so the heat lost by the water is (1000g) * c_water * 10°C. And the heat gained by the ice is (m_ice) * Lf (since melting at 0°C doesn't require a temperature change). So,

(1000g) * c_water * 10 = m_ice * Lf

So,

m_ice = (1000g * 10 * c_water) / Lf

But wait, what are the values of c_water and Lf?

Wait, Lf is the latent heat of fusion for water. I think that's approximately 334,000 J/kg, which is 334 kJ/kg. Wait, wait, no: 1 kg of water is 1000 g. So 334,000 J/kg is 334,000 J per kg. So 334,000 / 1000 = 334 J/g.

So, Lf = 334,000 J/kg = 334,000 J / 1000 g = 334 J/g.

So, with that, let's compute m_ice.

m_ice = (1000g * 10 * 4186 J/kg°C ) / (334,000 J/kg·°C )

Wait, wait, no: I think another way. Let me clarify. The specific heat of water is given as c_water = 4186 J/(kg·°C), right? Because I've heard that specific heat capacity of water is around 4186 J/(kg·°C) at constant pressure.

So, plugging numbers in:

m_ice = (1000g * 10°C) * 4186 J/(kg·°C) / 334,000 J/kg·°C

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, (1000g * 10) * 4186 / 334,000.

Simplify the units: 1000g is 1 kg, so 1 kg * 10 * 4186 / 334,000.

So 1 * 10 * 4186 = 41,860.

Divide by 334,000: 41,860 / 334,000 = approximately 0.1255 kg? Wait, 0.1255 kg is 125.5 grams.

Wait, because 0.1255 kg is 125.5 g.

Looking at the options, F is 125 gr, G is 200, C is 250, etc. So 125.5 is closest to 125 (F), but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate.

Compute numerator: 1000g * 10 = 10,000 g°C.

Multiply by c_water (4186 J/kg°C → which is 4186 J/(1000g)°C) → so 4186 * 10,000 / 1000 → 4186 *10 = 41,860 J·°C.

Denominator: Lf is 334,000 J/kg·°C.

So, 41,860 J·°C / 334,000 J/kg·°C → (41,860 / 334,000) kg.

Compute 41,860 ÷ 334,000.

Let me compute 41,860 ÷ 334,000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 418.6 ÷ 3340.

Hmm, 334 × 0.1255 is 417.55. Because 334 × 0.1 is 33.4; 334 ×0.0255 is approx 334 * 0.025 = 8.35, plus 334 *0.0005=0.167 → 8.517. So 33.4 + 8.517=41.917? Wait, that can't be right because 0.1255 *334 is 0.1254 *334 → 334*(0.1 + 0.02 + 0.005 +0.0005)= 33.4 +6.68 +1.67 +0.167= 41.917 J. Wait, but our numerator is 41,860 J·°C, which is 41.86 kJ·°C.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me compute 41860 ÷ 334000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 4186 ÷ 33400.

4186 ÷33400 = approximately 0.1255 kg.

0.1255 kg is 125.5 grams.

So, the mass of ice formed is approximately 125.5 grams. Looking at the options, F is 125 gr. So the answer is F.

Wait, but wait a minute—wait, did I make a mistake in the formula?

Because another approach could be to think about the heat required to melt ice: m_ice * Lf = m_water * c_water * (T_final - T_initial_water).

But in this case, the final temperature is 0°C. So the water cools from -10 to 0, which is a change of 10°C. So Q_water = m_water * c_water * 10.

Q_ice = m_ice * Lf → because to melt, the ice has to absorb that much heat.

So, m_ice = (m_water * c_water * 10) / Lf.

Which is exactly what I did earlier. So 1000g *4186 J/kg°C *10 / 334,000 J/kg·°C.

Wait, let me compute that again.

m_ice = (1000g * 4186 * 10) / 334000.

Wait, 1000 *4186 = 4,186,000.

Multiply by 10: 41,860,000.

Divide by 334,000: 41,860,000 / 334,000 = ?

Well, 334,000 * 125 = 334,000 * 100 =33,400,000 → 334,000 *25= 8,350,000. So 334,000 *125 =33,400,000 + 8,350,000=41,750,000.

So 334,000 *125.5 = 41,750,000 + (0.5 *334,000) = 41,750,000 +167,000=41,917,000.

But our numerator is 41,860,000, which is 41,860,000.

So 125.5 → 41,917,000 is larger than 41,860,000. So 41,860,000 ÷334,000 = approximately 125.466 grams.

So approximately 125.5 grams. So the correct answer should be 125 grams, which is option F.

To determine the mass of ice formed when 1 kg of supercooled water is placed into it, we analyze the heat exchange between the water and the ice. The water cools from -10°C to 0°C, absorbing heat, while the ice melts, absorbing the same amount of heat. The heat lost by the water equals the heat gained by the ice.

### Key Equations:
1. Heat lost by water:  
   \[
   Q_{\text{water}} = m_{\text{water}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot \Delta T
   \]
   where \(m_{\text{water}} = 1000 \, \text{g}\), \(c_{\text{water}} = 4186 \, \text{J/(kg·°C)}\), and \(\Delta T = 10 \, \text{°C}\).

2. Heat gained by ice:  
   \[
   Q_{\text{ice}} = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot L_f
   \]
   where \(L_f = 334,000 \, \text{J/kg}\) (latent heat of fusion for water).

Since \(Q_{\text{water}} = Q_{\text{ice}}\), we equate the two expressions:
\[
m_{\text{water}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot \Delta T = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot L_f
\]

### Calculation:
1. Substitute the known values:
   \[
   m_{\text{ice}} = \frac{m_{\text{water}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot \Delta T}{L_f}
   \]
   \[
   m_{\text{ice}} = \frac{1000 \cdot 4186 \cdot 10}{334,000}
   \]

2. Simplify:
   \[
   m_{\text{ice}} = \frac{41,860,000}{334,000} \approx 125.5 \, \text{g}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The mass of ice formed is approximately 125.5 grams. Among the given options, the closest value is **125 gr** (option F).
