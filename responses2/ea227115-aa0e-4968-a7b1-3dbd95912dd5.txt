Okay, so I've got this question about the population of Louisiana in 2010. Hmm, I remember that the question says the population was rounded to the nearest 10,000 and came out as 4,530,000. Now I need to figure out the actual population from the options given, rounded to the nearest 10,000. 

Wait, the options are A to F with different numbers. Let me think about how rounding works. If a number is rounded to the nearest 10,000, that means the actual number could be anywhere from 4,525,000 up to 4,534,999. Because 4,525,000 would round up to 4,530,000, and anything just below 4,535,000 would round down to 4,530,000. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The midpoint for rounding to the nearest 10,000 is at 4,525,000 and 4,534,999. Because anything 4,525,000 or higher up to 4,534,999 would round to 4,530,000. So the actual population must be in that range.

Looking at the options, let's check each:

Option A: 4,524,491. That's just below 4,525,000. So when rounded, that would be 4,520,000, because 4,524,491 is less than 4,525,000, so rounds down. So that's not 4,530,000, so A is out.

Option B: 4,500,321. That's much lower. It would round to 4,500,000. So no, that's way below the 4,530,000. So B is wrong.

Option C: 4,533,372. Let's see. 4,533,372 is between 4,525,000 and 4,535,000. So it would round to 4,530,000. Wait, because 4,533,372 is more than 4,525,000 and less than 4,535,000? Wait, no, 4,533,372 is 4,533 thousand, which is more than 4,530,000 but less than 4,535,000. So yes, it would round to 4,530,000.

Option D: 4,535,343. That's higher than 4,535,000, so when rounded, it would go to 4,540,000, not 4,530,000. So D's not correct.

Option E: 4,537,129. That's even higher, so rounding would be 4,540,000. Not matching.

Option F: 4,536,498. That's between 4,535,000 and 4,536,000. Wait, no, 4,536,498 is higher than 4,535,000, so when rounded to the nearest 10,000, it would be 4,540,000? Wait, no. Let me think again. The rounding rule is that anything from 4,535,000 and above up to 4,539,999 rounds to 4,530,000, and 4,540,000 and above rounds to 4,540,000. So 4,536,498 is higher than 4,535,000, so it rounds to 4,540,000. So it's not 4,530,000. So F is incorrect.

Wait, wait a minute. So, the correct range is 4,525,000 to 4,534,999, right? So C is 4,533,372, which is within that range. So that would be the correct option.

So among the options, the only one that falls into that range is C.

The population of Louisiana in 2010, when rounded to the nearest 10,000, is 4,530,000. To find the actual population, it must fall within the range 4,525,000 to 4,534,999. Checking each option:

- A: 4,524,491 < 4,525,000 → Rounds to 4,520,000.
- B: 4,500,321 < 4,525,000 → Rounds to 4,500,000.
- C: 4,533,372 is between 4,525,000 and 4,534,999 → Rounds to 4,530,000.
- D: 4,535,343 > 4,535,000 → Rounds to 4,540,000.
- E: 4,537,129 > 4,535,000 → Rounds to 4,540,000.
- F: 4,536,498 > 4,535,000 → Rounds to 4,540,000.

Only option C falls within the correct range. 

Answer: C
