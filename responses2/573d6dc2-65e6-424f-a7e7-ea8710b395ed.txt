Question:

A husband and wife were about to leave on vacation for one month. They thought it would be a great idea to have new carpeting installed in their home while they were away. They contacted a reputable carpeting company, which offered to do the job for $7,000. The husband and wife agreed, gave a set of house keys to the carpeting company, and left on vacation. A week later, the carpeting company discovered that they had overbooked their installation staff and could not finish all of the jobs for which they had contracted. The carpeting company contacted a workman whom they had used before, and told him about the job they were to perform for the husband and wife. The workman agreed to do the installation in exchange for the payment from the husband and wife. When the husband and wife returned from vacation, they were happy with the work and sent a check for $7,000 to the carpeting company, which deposited the check. If the workman now seeks to recover for services he performed, he will

Options:

A: not recover, because he agreed to perform the services without a direct contract with the husband and wife.
B: recover against the husband and wife only.
C: not recover, because the carpeting company already received payment.
D: recover against the carpeting company only.
E: not recover, because he did not have a written contract.
F: recover against the carpeting company, because they were the ones who contracted him.
G: recover against the husband and wife, because they were the ultimate beneficiaries of his work.
H: not recover, because he was not in privity of contract.
I: recover against both the husband and wife and the carpeting company.
J: recover against either the husband and wife or the carpeting company.

Okay, so I have this legal question here about contracts and recoveries. Let me try to think it through step by step. 

Alright, the scenario is a situation where a husband and wife were about to leave for vacation and decided to have their home's carpeting installed. They called a reputable company and agreed to pay $7,000. They gave each other the keys and left. A week later, the company realized they overbooked their staff and couldn't finish all the jobs. So, they contacted a previous worker and asked to do the job in exchange for the payment. The worker agreed. Then, after the vacation, the husband and wife sent a check for $7,000 to the company, which deposited it. Now, the question is, if the worker now wants to recover, where would he get the money?

Hmm, so let me break this down. The main issue here is about the terms of the contract after the company overbooked. When the company didn't have enough staff, they asked the previous worker to take on the job. The worker agreed to install the carpet in exchange for the $7k. The company then accepted the work, and the key was given to the worker. So, the worker is being paid by the company, but he's being paid directly by the husband and wife.

Wait, so I need to consider whether this is a contract or just a transfer of ownership. In contracts, there are a few things to consider: 
1. Did the contract specify that the worker is being paid directly by the company or by the customer (the husband and wife)?
2. Was there a written contract, or was it oral?

In this case, the worker agreed to do the work in exchange for the payment. So, it sounds like a contract. But the question is about whether the worker can recover against the company or the original buyers.

Wait, I think when a company pays a worker who is being paid by the company, it's called a contract on the part of the company. But if the worker is being paid by the company, then the worker's contract is with the company. But the company's contract with the customer (the husband and wife) is different.

Wait, no, the company's contract is with the customer. The worker is a service worker, so he's an independent contractor, I think. So, he can be paid directly by the company. But wait, the company already had a contract with the customer, but the worker was a substitute. So, if the worker was a substitute, perhaps the company had a contract with the customer, but the worker was doing the work under the company's supervision.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about it again. So, the company's original contract was with the husband and wife. The company had to hire workers because they overbooked, but the workers were the same as the ones the company initially hired. The company then replaced those workers with a new one, who was given the same keys, and took the payment. So, the worker was a substitute.

So, if the worker is now suing the company, he's in the business of installing carpeting. The question is, what's his claim? He can recover for the services he provided in exchange for the $7k. But wait, he's already getting the money from the company, so does that mean he's not in any trouble?

But wait, the initial contract was with the husband and wife. The worker was previously a worker for the company. Now, the company gave the worker the keys and took the payment. So, the worker's contract is with the company. Can the worker recover against the company?

Yes, I think so. Because the worker was a substitute worker, so he can be considered an independent contractor under the terms of the company's contract with the customer. So, the worker's services are considered a contract with the company. Therefore, the worker can sue the company for the $7k.

But wait, the question is about the worker's rights. Let's recap. The worker was a substitute for the company's workers. The company provided the worker with the keys (so the worker was given the necessary tools and was in a position to install the carpet). The worker agreed to do the job for $7k, which the company then accepted. So, the worker is a service worker, and the company is providing him with the services. So, the worker can be held liable for the $7k, as he provided the service under the company's contract. 

But wait, the answer options suggest that the worker might not be able to recover because he agreed to the worker without a direct contract. Let's look at the options.

Option A: not recover because he agreed without a contract. But wait, he was part of the company's contract. So, I think he can recover.

Option B: recover only against the customers (the husband and wife). But the worker can recover against the company.

Option C: not recover because the company had already received payment. But he's been given the money, so he's in a position to sue.

Option D: recover only against the company. That's possible.

Option E: not in contract. No, because the worker was a substitute and part of the company's contract.

Option F: recover against the company because they were the ones who contracted him. That's correct.

Option G: recover against the customers because they were the ultimate beneficiaries. No, because he's a substitute.

Option H: not in contract. No, he was a substitute.

Option I: recover against both. Maybe if he's suing both?

Option J: recover against either the customers or the company. That's possible if he's suing both.

Wait, but the question is about what he can recover against. In contract law, if a substitute worker is hired under a contract with the customer, the substitute can be held liable for the work done. So, the worker can be sued for the $7k. But he can't recover against the company because he was part of the company's contract.

Wait, but wait, the worker is a substitute. So, when he was hired by the company, he was part of the company's contract with the customer. So, the worker's contract is with the company, not the customer. So, he can sue the company for the $7k. But he can't sue the customer (the husband and wife) because they were the original contract parties.

Wait, but the worker is a substitute, so he can be held liable for the services he provided. So, his claim would be against the company. But the question is, the options presented are about who he can recover against. Let me look at the options again.

Option F says he can recover against the company because they were the ones who contracted him. That's correct. Because when the worker was hired by the company under the contract, he was a substitute. So, he can be sued by the company for the work.

But wait, another angle: the original contract was with the customers (the husband and wife). The worker was part of the company's contract with the customers, so the worker's contract is with the company. So, the worker's claim is against the company, not the customers.

Wait, but the options are about who the worker can recover against. The options include the customers, the company, or both.

Looking back: the question is, if the worker seeks to recover, who will he be able to recover against?

If the worker is suing the company, that's the only option. Because he can't recover against the original customers (the husband and wife) because they are the ones who originally made the contract, and the worker was part of the company's contract with them.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial contract was with the customers. The worker was a substitute under the company's contract. So, the worker is a substitute worker. So, when the worker does the work, he is in a position to be paid by the company. So, the worker's rights are with the company, not the customers. So, he can sue the company for the $7k.

But what about the other options. Are there any other options where the worker could be sued?

Wait, looking at the options again. Option F says he can recover against the company because they were the ones who contracted him. That's correct.

Option J says he can recover against either the customers or the company. That's also correct, but perhaps not the best answer. Because the worker is a substitute, so he is only liable against the company, not the customers. So, in that case, the answer would be F, not J.

Wait, but another possibility: the situation might create a duty. The company hired the worker under the contract with the customers. The worker agreed to do the work in exchange for payment. So, the worker is a substitute worker who was part of the company's contract. Therefore, the worker can be held liable for the work done, and thus can recover against the company.

So, putting it all together, if the worker wants to recover, he can do so against the company because the contract was with the company, not the customers. So, option F says he can recover against the company because they were the ones who contracted him. That's correct.

But wait, another thought: if the worker was a substitute, then he's a contractor with a separate contract. So, he can sue the company for the work. But the company's contract with the customers is separate. So, he can't recover against the customers. But the question is, if the worker seeks to recover, against whom?

Wait, the question is, if the worker now seeks to recover, he will: 

Looking at the options, I think the correct answer is F: recover against the carpeting company only. Because he's a substitute under the company's contract with the customers. So, he can be sued only by the company.

Wait, but let me think again. Another perspective: the original contract with the customers (the husband and wife) was with them, but the worker was part of the company's contract. So, the worker's rights are with the company. So, the worker cannot recover against the customers because they're the ones who originally made the contract.

But the question is about the worker's rights—if he wants to sue, who will he get the money from? He can be sued against the company because of the substitute agreement. But he can't be sued against the customers.

So, the correct answer is F: he can recover against the company because they were the ones who contracted him. Because the contract was with the company, not the customers.

Wait, but another point: the worker was part of the company's contract, so he can be held liable for the work done. But the initial contract was with the customers. So, he can't recover against them. But the question is about the worker's rights—so he can't, but the options don't have an option that says he can recover against both.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option F: recover against the company only.

So, the correct answer is F.
</think>

The scenario involves a worker who agreed to perform carpeting installation in exchange for a $7,000 payment, under a contract with a company. The worker was part of the company's contract with the customers (the husband and wife) but was a substitute worker. The worker is now seeking to recover for the services he provided.

Key considerations:

1. **Contract Law**: The worker is a substitute under the company's contract with the customers. Therefore, the worker can be held liable for the services he provided, but not against the customers. The initial contract with the customers was separate.

2. **Substitute Workers**: Substitutes under a contract with the customer can be held liable for the work done, even if they were part of a different contract with the company.

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option F**: Correct. The worker can recover against the company because the contract was with the company, not the customers.
   - Other options either exclude the company (A, C, D, E) or include the customers (B, G, H, I, J) which is incorrect.

Thus, the worker can recover against the company only.

ANSWER: F
