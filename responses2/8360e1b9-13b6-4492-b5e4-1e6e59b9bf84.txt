Okay, so I've got this question about sexual objectification and relationships. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about whether partners in a relationship will mutually deny each other's humanity, and what that does to sexual objectification.

First, I need to understand what sexual objectification means. From what I remember, sexual objectification occurs when a person's body structure, appearance, and behavior are considered human-like, even if they're not entirely human. So, it's about whether someone's sexual traits or behaviors make them look human.

Now, the question is about a scenario where partners deny each other's humanity. What does that mean? Deny of humanity probably means they don't see themselves as real people. So, maybe they don't feel the same emotions, or they don't see themselves in the same way.

The options are A to J. Let me look at each one.

Option A: The context is irrelevant. Hmm. That would mean that whether or not sexual objectification happens doesn't depend on the relationship's context. But I'm not sure if context matters. I think in some cases, the context might influence whether objectification happens.

Option B: Sexual objectification occurs. Well, that's a general statement, but the question is about the impact of mutual denial. Maybe in some contexts it does, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Option C: The context determines it. So, if they don't see each other as humans, maybe the context makes objectification more or less likely. Like, maybe seeing each other negatively can influence their behavior.

Option D: Only a non-mutual context. Wait, wait, D says that mutual denial isn't enough. So, non-mutual might be something else. I'm not sure how that fits.

Option E: Only physical abuse. That's about the type of abuse, not the partners' humanity. So, not the issue here.

Option F: Both partners can't objectify each other. That sounds like it's saying mutual denial can't happen, meaning objectification doesn't occur. But I'm not certain if that's true. I think mutual denial can happen, though.

Option G: No straightforward answer. Maybe the answer depends on more than just the context of the relationship.

Option H: Sexual objectification doesn't occur. Hmm, that's the opposite of what some theories say. I think objectification does occur, but maybe not always.

Option I: The denier sexually objectifies. That's suggesting that the partner who denies is the one who objectifies. I'm not sure if one partner objectifies the other based on denying each other's humanity.

Option J: Neither can objectify. So, neither partner can have human-like body features.

Wait, let me think about this. If partners deny each other's humanity, does that lead to objectification? I remember reading that when partners don't see each other as real individuals, they might objectify each other. Like, maybe they objectify each other based on their denial, even if they don't see each other as real people. So, in a non-mutual context, perhaps objectification occurs.

But wait, option F says "both are incapable of sexually objectifying each other." So, that would mean that mutual denial isn't enough for objectification. But I thought mutual denial can lead to objectification. So, the question is, does the context determine whether or not objectification happens.

Looking back, the question is about whether the context of the relationship affects this. So, the answer would be C: the context of the relationship determines whether or not objectification occurred.

Alternatively, some theories say that objectification can happen when people objectify each other, regardless of the context. Or maybe it's more about the nature of the relationship.

Wait, but the options are about what the scenario says. The question is about whether the mutual denial leads to objectification. So, if there's no straightforward answer, perhaps because it depends on the context, then the correct answer would be G: no straightforward answer.

Another angle: some sources say that when people objectify each other, it's often because of mutual denial leading to objectification. But other times, it might not happen. So, the presence of mutual denial might not always lead to objectification.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. So the question is, when partners mutually deny each other's humanity, does that lead to objectification.

I think that mutual denial can lead to objectification, but it's not a given. So, the correct answer would depend on whether the context affects it. So, the answer would be C: the context determines whether or not objectification occurred.

Alternatively, if the context isn't the issue, then perhaps it's a matter of whether the partners can objectify each other. So, the correct answer might be B: objectification occurs, but the question is about the context.

Wait, the question is asking what the context does. So the answer would be C. Because in some contexts, like a close-knit relationship where mutual denial is common, objectification is more likely. In other contexts, it might not be. So the answer depends on the context, thus option C is correct.

The question revolves around whether mutual denial of each other's humanity leads to sexual objectification in a relationship. The context of the relationship plays a crucial role in determining this outcome. 

- **Option A** suggests the context is irrelevant, which is unlikely as context can influence objectification.
- **Option B** states objectification occurs, but this is a general statement without context.
- **Option C** posits that the context determines the outcome, which aligns with the idea that mutual denial can lead to objectification in some contexts.
- **Option D** implies only non-mutual contexts are conducive to objectification, which is not supported by theories.
- **Option E** focuses on physical abuse, which is unrelated to the question.
- **Option F** claims both partners cannot objectify each other, which contradicts the idea that mutual denial can lead to objectification.
- **Option G** suggests no straightforward answer, implying the context is necessary, which fits the reasoning.
- **Option H** claims objectification doesn't occur, which is incorrect as objectification is often tied to mutual denial.
- **Option I** links denier objectification, which isn't backed by evidence.
- **Option J** states neither can objectify, which is incorrect.

The correct answer is **C**, as the context of the relationship determines whether objectification occurs. The context, such as the nature of the relationship, significantly influences the likelihood of mutual denial leading to objectification.
