Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the entropy of a communication system. Hmm, I remember entropy is a measure of uncertainty or information content. But wait, what's the exact formula again? Oh right, it's related to probabilities of events. 

The problem says there are six messages with probabilities (1/4), (1/4), (1/8), (1/8), (1/8), and (1/8). So I need to compute the entropy H of this system. 

Wait, the formula for entropy is H = -Σ p_i log2 p_i. Right, each term is the probability of an event multiplied by the log (base 2) of its reciprocal, but since it's negative, it becomes positive. So I need to calculate each term for each probability and sum them up.

Let me list the probabilities again: two messages have 1/4 chance, and four have 1/8 chance. So for each message, I'll compute -p_i * log2 p_i.

Let's compute each part. 

First, for the messages with p_i = 1/4. So log2(1/4) is log2(4^-1) which is -2. Because 2^2 is 4, so 1/4 is 2^-2. Or wait, wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Log base 2 of 1/4 is log2(0.25). Log2(1/4) is -2, because 2^-2 is 1/4. So p_i * log2(1/p_i) is (1/4) * (-2) = -0.5. Multiply by negative, so it's 0.5 for each of these two messages.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is H = - Σ p_i log2 p_i. So each term is p_i * log2(1/p_i), but since p_i is already a fraction, the log will be negative, so the product will be positive.

Wait, let me compute each term correctly. For each message:

For p_i = 1/4:
Term = (1/4) * log2(1/(1/4)) = (1/4) * log2(4) = (1/4)*2 = 0.5.

Since there are two such messages, their combined contribution is 0.5 * 2 = 1.0 bits.

Now for the four messages with p_i = 1/8:
Each term is (1/8) * log2(1/(1/8)) = (1/8) * log2(8) = (1/8)*3 = 0.375 per message. But there are four, so 0.375 *4 = 1.5.

Adding the two contributions: 1.0 + 1.5 = 2.5 bits.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations. 

Wait, p_i = 1/4: log2(1/4) is log2(4^-1) = -2. So (1/4)*(-2) is -0.5. Multiply by negative because of the entropy formula, so it's 0.5. Correct.

For p_i = 1/8: log2(1/8) is log2(8^-1) = -3. So (1/8)*(-3) = -0.375. Multiply by negative gives 0.375. Four such messages, 4 * 0.375 =1.5. So total is 2.5 bits.

So the total entropy is 2.5 bits per message. Looking at the options, option I is 2.50 bits/message. So the answer should be option I.

The entropy of a communication system is calculated using the formula \( H = -\sum p_i \log_2 p_i \). For the given probabilities, two messages have \( p_i = \frac{1}{4} \) and four messages have \( p_i = \frac{1}{8} \).

1. For \( p_i = \frac{1}{4} \):
   - \( \log_2 \frac{1}{4} = \log_2 4^{-1} = -2 \)
   - Term: \( \frac{1}{4} \times (-2) = -0.5 \)
   - Contribution: \( 2 \times (-0.5) = 1.0 \) bits.

2. For \( p_i = \frac{1}{8} \):
   - \( \log_2 \frac{1}{8} = \log_2 8^{-1} = -3 \)
   - Term: \( \frac{1}{8} \times (-3) = -0.375 \)
   - Contribution: \( 4 \times (-0.375) = 1.5 \) bits.

Total entropy: \( 1.0 + 1.5 = 2.5 \) bits/message.

ANSWER: I. 2.50 bits/message
