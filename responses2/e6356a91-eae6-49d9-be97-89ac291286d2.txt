Question:

A 20-month old clings nervously to her mother and does not want to explore a new play environment. She suddenly pushes her mother away and does not engage in any hugs her mother tries to give her.

Options:

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a child's attachment type. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a 20-month-old who's staying in her mother's play area and wants to explore a new one. Then she pushes her away and doesn't give any hugs. The facial expression is anxious, and she looks away. The mother also looks away and turns away. I need to determine the attachment type from the options provided.

First, I'll recall what attachment styles are about. There are a few main types: secure, secure disorganized, secure avoidant, insecure resistant, insecure disorganized, and insecure independent. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact differences, so I'll need to think carefully.

The scenario here is that the child is pushing away and not giving hugs. She's anxious but looking away. The mother turns away. So, the child is trying to explore a new environment, which suggests she's not secure. Secure children are typically more independent and don't need to be pushed to explore. They prefer to stay within their comfort zone.

Insecure children, on the other hand, are more dependent on their parents for exploration. They might show signs like looking away, not wanting to be pushed, or trying to seek new opportunities. The child in question is showing a preference for a new play environment, which indicates she's not secure. She's not trying to avoid it but is actually exploring, which is a sign of insecurity.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A: Secure resistant
B: Secure
C: Secure disorganized
D: Insecure resistant
E: Insecure independent
F: Insecure disorganized
G: Insecure avoidant
H: Secure avoidant
I: Insecure dependent
J: Insecure independent (wait, J says "Insecure independent", but E is "Insecure independent". So it's a bit unclear, but I think E is the correct one.)

Wait, no, E is "Insecure independent" — that doesn't sound right. Typically, secure children are secure when they're independent, but when they're insecure, they need their parents to be around for them to explore. So, the child is showing signs that suggest she's trying to explore, which points to an insecure child. Also, she's anxious but not looking away; she's not trying to avoid, which rules out options like secure resistant or secure.

So, looking at the options, option E is "Insecure independent". Wait, but I thought secure children might have more of a secure disposition. Wait, no, secure children are more secure when they're independent, but when they're insecure, they're dependent on their parents.

Wait, let me think again. The child is pushing away, not seeking help, which is a sign of insecurity. She's trying to explore, which indicates she's not secure. So, the correct attachment type would be "Insecure" because she's dependent on her mother for exploration.

Looking at the options, the secure types are B, C, H, I. Insecure types are D, E, F, J. So, the child is insecure because she's trying to explore and not seeking help, which is a sign of insecurity.

Wait, but another thought: secure children are more secure and don't need to be pushed. However, when they are insecure, they need their parents to be around. So, in this case, the child is trying to explore, which is an insecure behavior.

So the correct answer should be "Insecure" type. Looking at the options, option D is "Insecure resistant", which is a bit odd because 'resistant' usually refers to not being able to do something. So perhaps I'm confusing terms. Alternatively, 'insecure' without 'resistant' is a type.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A: Secure resistant
B: Secure
C: Secure disorganized
D: Insecure resistant
E: Insecure independent
F: Insecure disorganized
G: Insecure avoidant
H: Secure avoidant
I: Insecure dependent

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The options E and I are both about insecure. So E is "Insecure independent", which might not be correct. Let me think about what each type entails.

Secure children are secure when independent but are secure in their own way. When they need help, they become secure. Insecure children are dependent and not secure. They are not secure when they need help. So, when a child is trying to explore, they're not secure, so the type is 'insecure'.

Looking for an option that says "insecure" or "insecure ...". Oh, option E is "Insecure independent" — wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think: secure and insecure are categories. The correct term is 'insecure' without 'resistant' or 'dependent'.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 'Insecure' without 'resistant' or 'dependent'. But looking at the options, I don't see an 'Insecure' option. Wait, no, the options are:

E: Insecure independent → perhaps that's a mix-up.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the child's behavior. She's trying to explore a new play area, which is a sign of insecurity. She's not pushing, so she's not resistant. She's not looking away, so she's not avoidant. She's not independent, since she's trying to explore herself, which suggests dependence on her mother.

So, among the options, the type is 'insecure' and 'independent'. The options are E and I. E is 'Insecure independent' which seems correct. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The child is in a situation where she's pushing away, which is a sign of insecurity. She's looking away, not trying to avoid, so she's not resistant. She's not avoiding, so she's not avoidant. She's not independent, as she's exploring herself. So, the correct attachment type is 'insecure' and 'independent'. Looking at the options, E is 'Insecure independent', which seems to fit.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

E: Insecure independent

I: Insecure dependent

So, the correct answer is E. Because the child is not independent; she's dependent on her mother for exploration. Therefore, the attachment type is 'Insecure independent'.
</think>

The child in question is showing signs of insecurity and dependency on her mother for exploration. She is not seeking help, not looking away, and not independent. This indicates that she is dependent on her mother for new experiences, which is a hallmark of an "insecure independent" attachment type.

Answer: E
