Okay, so I've got this series to evaluate: S equals the sum from n equals 0 to infinity of 1 over 3 to the n. Hmm, that looks familiar. Wait, I think I remember that this is a geometric series. Let me recall: a geometric series is like a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ... where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio, right?

So in this case, the first term when n is 0 would be 1/(3^0) which is 1. Then when n is 1, it's 1/(3^1) = 1/3, n=2 is 1/9, and so on. So the series starts with 1 and each term is 1/3 of the previous one. That makes the common ratio r equal to 1/3. 

I remember that for a geometric series, if the absolute value of r is less than 1, the series converges and the sum is a/(1 - r). Let me check: here a is 1, and r is 1/3. So plugging into the formula, the sum S would be 1/(1 - 1/3). Let me compute that denominator: 1 - 1/3 is 2/3. So 1 divided by (2/3) is the same as 3/2. So the sum should be 3/2.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's see. Another way to think about it is adding the terms up to a certain point and seeing what happens as that number increases. For example, the first few terms are 1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + ... which is approaching a limit. If I sum the first two terms, that's 4/3. Adding the next, 1/81 gives me 4/3 + 1/81 = 109/81 ≈ 1.345. Adding the next term, 1/243, gives 334/243 ≈ 1.372. It's getting closer to 3/2, which is 1.5. So that makes sense.

Alternatively, another thought: what if I rewrite the series as 1 + (1/3) + (1/3)^2 + (1/3)^3 + ... and then multiply both sides by 3. Let's try that. 

Let S = 1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + ...
Then 3S = 3 + 1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + ...
Now, subtract the original S from 3S:

3S - S = (3 + 1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + ...) - (1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + ...)
That gives 2S = 3 + (1 -1) + (1/3 -1/3) + ... which simplifies to 2S = 3. So 2S = 3 implies S = 3/2.

Yep, that's the same result. So the sum is definitely 3/2. Looking back at the options, option E is 7/4, which is not correct, and option J is 3/2. So the correct answer must be J.

The series is a geometric series with first term 1 and ratio 1/3. The sum converges to 1/(1 - 1/3) = 3/2. 

Answer: E: 7/4, F: 4/3, G: 5/3, H: 2, I: 5/2, J: 3/2. The correct option is J.

Answer: J
