Okay, I'm trying to solve this question about the flow rate needed to fill a water tank. The tank holds 50 gallons and it needs to be filled in 20 seconds. I need to find the flow rate in gallons per second.

Hmm, flow rate is usually calculated by dividing the volume by the time. So the formula should be something like flow rate equals volume divided by time. Let me write that down: Q = V / t.

Given that the volume V is 50 gallons and the time t is 20 seconds. Plugging in the numbers, Q = 50 / 20. Let me do that division. 50 divided by 20 is 2.5. So the flow rate needed is 2.5 gallons per second.

Now I need to look at the options provided. The options are A:6, B:70, C:1.5, D:5, E:16.7, F:10, G:0.4, H:4, I:3.5, J:2.5.

Wait, 2.5 is option J. So I think the correct answer is J:2.5.

The correct answer is J: 2.5.
