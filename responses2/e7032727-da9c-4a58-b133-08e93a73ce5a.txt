Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that the capital/output ratio is 2.5, and GNP increases from $985 billion to $1,055 billion. They want to know by how much investment is expected to increase, assuming no depreciation. Then, there's another part about the marginal propensity to consume being 0.5, and what that would do to GNP. Oh wait, and both parts are based on the same initial rise, so the GNP increase is 70 billion (since 1055-985 is 70). 

First, I think I need to understand the terms. The capital/output ratio (K/Y) is the ratio of the capital stock to output. So if K/Y is 2.5, that means for every dollar of output, there's 2.5 dollars of capital. Or wait, maybe it's the inverse? No, no, I think it's capital per output. So K/Y = 2.5 implies that for each dollar of output, 2.5 dollars are used as capital.

Capital refers to fixed factors of production, right? So in the context of investment, which is the capital stock that is added to, the capital/output ratio would relate to how much investment is expected based on the current output.

The formula for investment (I) in terms of output (Y) and capital (K) is I = K - (K/Y)(Y - T). But wait, when there's no depreciation, and assuming that taxes (T) are zero, the equation simplifies. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the multiplier effect.

Oh, right, the multiplier effect. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the fraction of additional income that gets spent on consumption. So the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is 1 - MPC. 

So if the MPC is 0.5, then MPS is 0.5 as well. Wait, no, wait. MPC is the fraction of additional income that's consumed. So if MPC is 0.5, then 50% of the additional income is saved. So the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

But looking at the question, it's the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), which is 0.5. So that's important.

Wait, the question asks two things. The first is about investment increasing when GNP rises. The second is about how much GNP will change due to investment. I think I need to model this with the multiplier.

Let me break it down.

First, when GNP (Y) increases by ΔY = $70 billion.

1. The first part: How much can investment (ΔI) increase, assuming no depreciation. So, with the capital/output ratio (K/Y) =2.5. So K = 2.5 Y. But wait, I'm not sure if K is a function of Y. Alternatively, the investment multiplier is given by 1/(1 - MPC) when considering the multiplier effect.

Wait, the multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC). Because the MPC is how much of additional income is spent, so the multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC). So with MPC 0.5, the multiplier would be 1/(0.5) = 2. So investment would increase by 2 times ΔY.

Wait, but let's think about the formula. The formula for the change in investment is ΔI = MPC * ΔY, but no, that's not correct. Wait, no. The multiplier is ΔI = (1/MPS) * ΔY, because the marginal propensity to save is the fraction not spent on consumption. So 1/MPS is the multiplier.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me make it clear. 

The MPC is the fraction of additional income that is consumed. So if Y increases by ΔY, the additional consumption is MPC * ΔY. The remaining (1 - MPC) is saved. So the multiplier is (1 - MPC)^-1 because each dollar saved can lead to further increases in income through investment.

So the multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC). So in this case, 1/(1 - 0.5) = 2.

So the change in investment would be ΔI = multiplier * ΔY.

Wait, but wait, but the capital/output ratio is given as 2.5. How does that fit in?

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the change in investment due to the change in GNP. Since I is dependent on Y, which is the total output, the change in I is based on the change in Y, and the multiplier.

Wait, but I'm a bit mixed up. Let me think again.

The capital/output ratio (K/Y) is 2.5. So K = 2.5 Y.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the change in investment is ΔI = MPC * ΔY. But no, that would be the case if the MPC was the multiplier. So I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in investment is (1 - MPC) * ΔY. So using the multiplier.

Wait, let's think in terms of the spending multipliers. The MPC is the fraction of income that's spent on consumption, so the marginal propensity to save is 1 - MPC.

Since the marginal propensity to save is the fraction that is not spent on consumption, it's saved. So when income increases by ΔY, the additional savings is (1 - MPC) * ΔY. But this saved money becomes investment. So the change in investment would be (1 - MPC) * ΔY.

But wait, wait, no. Because the marginal propensity to consume is the fraction of additional income that is consumed, not saved. So when Y increases by ΔY, the marginal propensity to save is (1 - MPC) * ΔY. So this saved money is used for investment. So the ΔI is (1 - MPC) * ΔY.

But wait, that gives ΔI as 0.5 * 70 = 35 billion. But wait, the options don't have 35 billion as the first part. Hmm.

Wait, the first part of the question says, "If the capital/output ratio is 2.5, and GNP rises from $985 billion to $1,055 billion, by how much can investment be expected to increase, assuming no depreciation?" So when GNP increases by 70, the change in investment is (1 - MPC) * ΔY, which is 0.5 *70 =35 billion. But looking at the options, the first number is 100, 200, etc. So 35 isn't an option. So I must be misunderstanding something.

Ah, perhaps I'm not considering that the capital/output ratio affects the marginal propensity to save? Because the capital stock is a fixed input. So the saving is not just based on MPC, but also how much of the new investment goes into saving.

Wait, so the way it works is that the marginal propensity to save is the fraction of additional income that is not spent on consumption. But in this case, if the marginal propensity to consume is 0.5, then the marginal propensity to save is 0.5. So the multiplier would be 2, as before. So the change in investment is 2 * 70 = 140 billion. But wait, that's not an option either.

Wait, no. The problem says, I think, that the capital/output ratio (K/Y) is 2.5. So perhaps the change in investment is based on the capital. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The change in investment is ΔI = (1 - MPC) * (ΔY) * (K/Y) * (1/(1 - MPC))). Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, I think I'm getting too stuck. Let me try to look up the formula. Wait, no, I can't. I'll proceed with what I know.

The capital-output ratio (K/Y) is 2.5, which means that for every dollar of output, 2.5 dollars are invested as capital. So if output increases by ΔY, the investment increases by 2.5 * ΔY, because each dollar of output requires 2.5 dollars of capital. So investment would go up by 2.5 * 70 = 175 billion. But that can't be, because 175 isn't an option either. Wait, the options don't have 175. Let me check.

Looking at the options, I see option D is 175 billion and 350 billion as the change in GNP. So if investment is 175, then the change in GNP due to investment would be the multiplier times investment. The multiplier is 2, so 175 * 2 = 350, which matches option D's second number. But the question is asking for the investment increase, which would be 175. But the first part of the question is about investment, so if the way it's being calculated is different, this might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-express everything.

Wait, the problem says, "the capital/output ratio is 2.5." So K/Y = 2.5. So K = 2.5 Y. So, for every dollar of Y, the country uses 2.5 dollars as capital. 

But how does this affect investment? Since investment I is the amount that is added to the capital stock. So, if output increases by ΔY, and the capital ratio is 2.5, then the change in investment is 2.5 * ΔY. So that would be 2.5 *70 =175 billion. But looking at the options, the first part of option D is 175, and the second part is 350. So if that's the case, the first number would be 175, which is in option D, and the second would be 350, which is also in D. So D would be the answer.

But wait, the question says, "by how much can investment be expected to increase." So if I = 175 * (ΔY) / (1 - MPC). Wait, maybe I'm getting this confused with the multiplier effect.

Wait, perhaps the change in investment is (1 - MPC) * ΔY, because the marginal propensity to save is (1 - MPC) and that's how much is saved, which becomes investment. So if MPC is 0.5, then (1 - MPC) is 0.5. So the change in investment is 0.5 *70=35 billion. That would fit with one of the options, like option F (140 and 280), but 35 isn't an option. So perhaps I'm mixing up the saving and the multiplier.

Wait, maybe the change in investment is (K/Y) * (ΔY) * (1/(1 - MPC)). Let's try that.

So K/Y is 2.5, ΔY is 70. So 2.5 *70 =175. Multiply by (1/(1 - 0.5))=2. So 175 *2=350. That gives us 350 for the first part, which is option D's second number, and the second part is 350*2=700, which isn't an option. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in investment is (K/Y) * (ΔY) * (MPS). Because the MPS is the fraction saved, which becomes investment. So:

I = (K/Y) * ΔY * (MPS) = 2.5 *70 *0.5= 2.5 *35=87.5 billion. But that isn't an option either.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach it using the multiplier formula.

The change in GNP (ΔY) will lead to a change in investment (ΔI) based on the marginal propensity to save. Because the marginal propensity to save is the fraction of income not spent on consumption, which is saved and becomes investment. So, ΔI = (1 - MPC) * ΔY. Since MPC is 0.5, (1 -0.5)=0.5. So ΔI =0.5 *70=35 billion. Then, the multiplier would be 1/(1 - MPC)=2. So the change in GDP would be 35 * 2=70 billion, which matches the ΔY given.

But the first part of the question is asking for how much investment is expected to increase, not the change in GDP. So I think the question is specifically about ΔI, which is 35 billion. But none of the options have 35 billion as the first part. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the change in investment in the context of the capital/output ratio. Let me think again. Maybe the change in investment is the change in Y multiplied by the capital/output ratio. So ΔI = (K/Y) * ΔY = 2.5 *70=175, which matches option D's first number. And the second part, the change in GNP due to investment, would be ΔI * multiplier. So 175 *2=350, which is part of option D. So that would make D the correct answer.

So putting it all together, the first part is 175 billion, the second is 350. So option D is the correct one.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the relationship between the capital/output ratio, GNP increase, and the expected investment increase and its impact on GNP.

### Key Information:
1. **Capital/Output Ratio (K/Y):** 2.5. This means for every dollar of output, $2.50 is invested as capital.
2. **Initial GNP:** $985 billion.
3. **Final GNP:** $1,055 billion.
4. **Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC):** 0.5.

### Step 1: Calculate ΔY (Change in GNP)
The change in GNP is:
\[
\Delta Y = 1,055 - 985 = 70 \text{ billion}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Expected Increase in Investment (ΔI)
The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is:
\[
MPS = 1 - MPC = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.
\]
The expected increase in investment is:
\[
\Delta I = MPS \times \Delta Y = 0.5 \times 70 = 35 \text{ billion}.
\]
However, the question asks for the expected increase in investment, **not** the change in GDP. Since the capital/output ratio (K/Y) is 2.5, the change in investment can also be calculated as:
\[
\Delta I = \text{K/Y} \times \Delta Y = 2.5 \times 70 = 175 \text{ billion}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Impact of Investment on GNP
The multiplier effect is:
\[
\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - MPC} = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2.
\]
The change in GNP due to the increase in investment is:
\[
\Delta Y_{\text{total}} = \Delta I \times \text{Multiplier} = 175 \times 2 = 350 \text{ billion}.
\]

### Final Answer:
- The expected increase in investment is **175 billion**.
- The change in GNP due to this investment is **350 billion**.

This matches **Option D**.

**ANSWER: D**
