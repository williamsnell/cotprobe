Okay, so I've got this question about Butler's views on acting virtuously. I'm a bit rusty on Butler's philosophy, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question asks what Butler believes acting virtuously entails. The options are a mix of principles related to inner principles, law, God, elders, peers, and society.

I remember that Butler, as a philosopher, discussed the Four Canons of Virtue: Action, Character, Morals, and the Nature of Man. Virtuous action is central to the first canon. So, when someone acts virtuously, they should be doing something according to their character. 

Looking at the options, option B says "our highest inward principle." That makes sense because in Butler's view, the highest principle is one that comes from the person's own inner nature, not external forces. So, virtuous behavior follows their own principles without external influences.

Options like A might suggest it's all inward, but B emphasizes the highest, so A could be too broad or incorrect. Option C talks about law, which I don't think is part of Butler's view. D is God's commands, which is more secular and doesn't fit his ethical framework. E and I refer to elders and peers, which are more about tradition and social influence, not the inner principles. F and G are about society, which again, are external factors. 

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be B: our highest inward principle.

The correct answer is B: our highest inward principle.

 Butler believed that virtuous action is guided by one's own inner principles, which are the strongest foundation of virtue. These principles are the highest and cannot be overridden by external factors. Therefore, the correct choice is B.

Answer: B
