Okay, so I've got this question about mud-bricks from Huaca del Sol and the markings on them. I'm a bit rusty on my history, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that mud-bricks are one of the earliest building materials, used by ancient civilizations. The one I'm thinking of is probably the Aztec, right? Because I've heard that Aztec bricks have distinctive markings. But wait, what were those markings exactly?

I think the Aztec used a system of animal signs, like horses, deers, and wild animals. These markings were used to identify the origin of the brick. So, each animal or related creature might have a specific meaning. Like maybe a horse was for the country, a deer for the city, and so on. These markings were important for trade and loyalty, showing which people or groups had produced the bricks.

So the question is asking about the markings on the mud-bricks. If they're from Huaca del Sol, which is an Aztec city, then the markings would probably be similar to the Aztec system. The options are A to D.

Option A says they're instructions written by engineers. I don't think that's right. The markings are more about identification and loyalty than instructions.

Option B: random scratches. No, the markings are definitely meaningful and not random. They carry specific meanings.

Option C: intended to identify the local group. Oh, that's exactly what I was thinking. The markings were used to show the origin of the bricks, indicating who made them.

Option D: simple arithmetic. That doesn't make sense. Arithmetic is more about numbers, and mud-bricks weren't used for that.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be C. The markings served to identify the local group, which in this case was the people of Huaca del Sol.

The markings on the mud-bricks of Huaca del Sol are most likely intended to identify the local group that produced them. This aligns with the known use of animal symbols by the Aztec civilization, which were used for identification and loyalty.
