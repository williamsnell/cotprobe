Okay, so I've got this question about candies and which ones are traditionally fruit-flavored. Let me think through this. The options are from A to J, each with a different type of candy.

First, I'll list them out to make it easier.

A: Kit Kat
B: M&M's
C: Almond Joy
D: Junior Mints
E: Skittles
F: Milky Way
G: Snickers
H: Butterfinger
I: Hershey's Chocolate Bar
J: Reese's Pieces

I know that KitKat is a candy bar, so probably not fruit-flavored. So option A is out.

M&M's are the classic candy with many colors, but are they fruit-flavored? I'm not sure, but I think they are the most common non-vegetarian candy, but they are usually red and yellow. Wait, but some M&M's are blue. I'm not certain if they're considered fruit. Maybe they're not because they have other colors besides red and yellow.

Almond Joy is another brand. I've heard it's a fruit-flavored candy, maybe like a fruit bar. So that might be a possible candidate.

Junior Mints are from Mars. I think Mars has a lot of different flavors, including some that are fruit-based. So option D could be a possible answer.

Skittles are red and yellow, so they're definitely not fruit-flavored. So E is out.

Milky Way is a chocolate bar with yellow stars, so not fruit.

Snickers are a brand, I think they are fruit-flavored. So G could be a candidate.

Butterfinger and Snickers: Wait, Butterfinger is a chocolate bar, I think. But I'm not sure about Butterfinger's flavor. Wait, Butterfinger is a chocolate bar, right? Or is it another brand? Oh, sometimes people confuse it with Butterfinger as a candy. Wait I need to get this straight. I think Butterfinger is a brand, but I'm not certain about its flavor. Maybe it's a chocolate bar, but I'm a bit confused now.

Hershey's Chocolate Bar is a specific brand, definitely not fruit-flavored. So I can eliminate I.

Reese's Pieces are the brand, also not fruit-flavored.

So the candidates are B, C, D, F, G.

Wait, the options are A to J, so the question is which is traditionally fruit-flavored. So let's think again.

M&M's: I'm not sure if they're considered fruit. I think they're more of a candy with colors, maybe from Mars, but they are often red and yellow.

Almond Joy is definitely fruit-flavored, as I recall it's a bar or snack with fruit.

Junior Mints are probably a fruit-flavored bar, like Mars's Mars bars are often fruit-based.

Milky Way: Not fruit, as it's chocolate.

Snickers: Red and yellow, so not fruit.

Butterfinger: I think that's a brand, but I'm not sure if it's fruit-flavored. Alternatively, maybe some people confuse it with Butterfinger candy, but I think Butterfinger is a chocolate bar, not fruit.

So the options for fruit-flavored are B, C, D, F, G.

Wait, the question is about which is traditionally fruit-flavored, so the correct answer must be one of these.

Now, I think Almond Joy (C) is a candy bar made with Almonds, which are fruits. So C is a fruit-flavored candy.

Similarly, Junior Mints (D) are also fruit-flavored, as Mars's Mars bars are often fruit-based.

Wait, but the question is which is traditionally fruit-flavored. So both C and D are possible. But the way the question is phrased, it's only one correct answer. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, I might have confused something. Let me think again.

M&M's are red and yellow, so not fruit-flavored.

Almond Joy: I think it's made with Almonds, which are fruits, so yes, it's fruit-flavored.

Junior Mints: Mars's Mars bars are often fruit, so yes, they are.

Skittles: Red and yellow, so no.

Milky Way: No.

So the options are C and D.

Wait, but the question is asking which of the following is traditionally fruit-flavored. So the answer could be either C or D.

Wait, but perhaps the question is pointing towards the most common or well-known ones. Almond Joy and Junior Mints are both well-known. But I'm not sure if the question is expecting multiple answers, but the options are A to J, each with a single option.

Wait, the question is multiple-choice, so the answer must be one letter A-J. So perhaps the intended answer is C: Almond Joy.

Because Almond Joy is a candy bar made with Almonds, which are fruits, making it fruit-flavored. Similarly, Junior Mints are also fruit-flavored. But perhaps the question is expecting the answer to list both, but the options don't allow for that.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The options provided are:

A: Kit Kat – non-fruit.

B: M&M's – not fruit.

C: Almond Joy – fruit.

D: Junior Mints – fruit.

E: Skittles – non-fruit.

F: Milky Way – chocolate.

G: Snickers – perhaps fruit? I'm not sure. I think Snickers are bar-shaped with chocolate and maybe some fruit inside? Wait, I'm not certain, but I think Snickers are more like chocolate bars, so not fruit.

H: Butterfinger – I think that's a brand, perhaps not fruit-flavored.

I: Hershey's Chocolate Bar – no.

J: Reese's Pieces – no.

So the correct options are B, C, D, G. Wait, but G's Butterfinger. I'm not certain about its flavor. Maybe it's not fruit.

So the answer could be C, D. But the question is which is traditionally fruit-flavored.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the most common ones. Almond Joy is a brand known for using Almonds, which are fruits, so it's definitely fruit-flavored. Junior Mints are another well-known brand, also fruit-flavored.

But the options for the answer are single letters, so perhaps the question expects a single answer. Which one is more likely?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing knowledge that Skittles are not fruit, so the answer is either C or D.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is Almond Joy because it's a well-known fruit-flavored candy. Or perhaps it's junior mints as Mars's Mars bars are often considered fruit-flavored.

Wait, but maybe the correct answer is B: M&M's. No, because I'm not sure they're fruit-flavored. M&M's are usually red and yellow.

So, perhaps the answer is C: Almond Joy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting both C and D, but the options are single letters, so perhaps the intended answer is C.

Another angle: the question is about which of the options is fruit-flavored. So perhaps the correct answer is C: Almond Joy.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about M&M's. I'll have to stick with the options. The answer choices are:

A: No.

B: No.

C: Yes.

D: Yes.

E: No.

F: No.

G: Maybe, but I'm not sure.

H: No.

I: No.

J: No.

So the correct options are C and D.

But the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting the answer to be either C or D, but the options don't allow for that. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says which is traditionally fruit-flavored. So perhaps the correct answer is C: Almond Joy. Because that's a candy bar made with Almonds, which are fruits. So that's a more obvious answer.

Alternatively, I've heard that Mars has several Mars bars that are fruit-flavored, including Junior Mints, which are also a variety of Mars bar.

Alternatively, I'm confused because I thought butterfinger is a chocolate bar, but perhaps that's a trick.

Wait, perhaps the answer is either C or D. But between the options, perhaps C is the primary answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the brand's name. For example, Almond Joy's name sounds like "Almond Apple" which are fruits. So that's a good clue.

So I think the intended correct answer is C: Almond Joy.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain because I'm not 100% sure about M&M's. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that M&M's are not fruit-flavored, so the correct answer is C and D.

But without knowing for sure, perhaps I should go with the most obvious answer, which is C: Almond Joy.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D: Junior Mints. Because Mars makes Mars bars, which are often fruit-flavored. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is C: Almond Joy. Because that's the only one that clearly uses fruit (Almonds). So that's probably the intended answer.

The correct answer is C: Almond Joy, as it is a candy bar traditionally made with Almonds, which are fruits.
