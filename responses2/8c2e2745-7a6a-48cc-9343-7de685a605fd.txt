Okay, so I have this question about the founder of Sikhism. I remember that Sikhism is a branch of Hinduism, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact founder. Let me think. The options are A to J, each with a different Guru name.

I know that the Shatt Alayam, or the Sarsai circle, is a key part of Sikhism. The founder of that circle is often referred to as Guru Gobind Singh. I think he was a Shivalik leader, which means he was from an era around 300-350 CE. I've heard of him before; he's the first to be recognized as an ancestor of the Sikh community in India.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I remember that there's also a Guru called Guru Nanak, but that's more associated with the Swami Nanak srivishtad. So, that's a different person, more about the Swami movement. So option E, Guru Nanak, can't be the founder of Sikhism.

Looking at the other options, option C is Guru Gobind Singh, which fits the Sarsai circle idea. So I'm pretty confident that's the correct answer. The rest are either from different traditions or have different circles or movements.

The correct answer is C: Guru Gobind Singh, as he is the founder of the Sarsai circle, a key part of Sikhism.
