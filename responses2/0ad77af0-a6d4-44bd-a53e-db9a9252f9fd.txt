Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evolutionary biology. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The question is about imbalances in sex ratios beyond a 50:50 ratio and how that relates to selection mechanisms.

The question says that when there are imbalances, the minority sex gets more care and resources from parents than the offspring of the majority sex. The options are various types of selectionâ€”like natural selection, etc. My job is to pick the correct one.

I remember that selection refers to processes that change the frequency of genes in a population. There are different types, like directional selection, which favors a particular allele, stabilizing selection, which keeps certain traits stable, disruptive selection which flips the sign of a trait, and so on. Also, there are frequency-dependent selection, which is when the fitness of a trait depends on its frequency in the population.

The question mentions imbalances in sex ratios beyond 50:50. So, if one sex has more offspring, that might mean that the parents are more likely to invest in the minority. That sounds like a scenario where the parent's fitness depends on the frequency of the genes in the population. So, perhaps frequency-dependent selection is the answer.

Let me think about each option. 

Option A: Artificial selection. That's when organisms are selected based on heritable traits, but it's more about gradual changes rather than frequency-based advantages.

Option B: Sexual selection is about traits that are advantageous for the species as a whole, based on the sex's role in reproduction. Not sure if that's the same as the question.

Option C: Frequency-dependent selection. This is where the fitness of a trait depends on its frequency in the population. So, if the majority has more offspring, the parent's fitness might increase because the offspring don't have the same resources as the parents. That sounds exactly like what the question describes.

Option D: Directional selection. This is when the environment changes, favoring one allele more. But the question is about the frequency of the trait, not environmental changes.

Option E: Kin selection is about genes affecting the fitness of relatives, often in social animals. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Option F: Stabilizing selection keeps certain traits stable. It's about maintaining a balance rather than favoring one side.

Option G: Intra-sexual selection is about traits within a species that affect reproductive success. This could be about resources, but I'm not certain. The question is more about the proportion of resources, which is frequency-dependent.

Option H: Balancing selection maintains a stable allele frequency by counteracting the effects of selection. Not sure if that's the case here.

Option I: Disruptive selection flips the sign of a trait. Like, if one allele is advantageous, disruptive selection would make the other worse. But the question isn't about that.

Option J: Natural selection is the main process that shapes the adaptive traits in a population. It's more general, but I think it's broader than the specific mechanism described.

So, putting it all together, the scenario described is where the minority sex gets more care because their parents have higher numbers. This is frequency-dependent selection because the fitness of the minority (the parent) depends on their frequency in the population. So the correct answer should be C: frequency-dependent selection.

The question describes a scenario where one sex has a greater proportion of care and resources from its parents than the offspring of the majority sex. This aligns with frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of a trait depends on its frequency in the population. 

**Answer: C: frequency-dependent selection.**
