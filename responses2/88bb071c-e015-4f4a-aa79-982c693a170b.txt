Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these stoichiometry problems. But let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about calculating the amount of air needed to burn a pound of gasoline. The gasoline is C8H18, and the combustion reaction uses oxygen (O2) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The air is a mixture of oxygen and another gas, O2, with air being 23.19% O2 and 75.46% N2 by weight. Wait, but in the reaction, only O2 is involved. Oh, right, the other nitrogen in the air isn't used in this reaction because it's part of the air but not part of the products. So, for the purpose of this calculation, we can ignore the nitrogen.

The goal is to find out how many pounds of air are needed to burn one pound of C8H18.

First, I think I need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of C8H18.

The reaction is: C8H18 + O2 → CO2 + H2O.

I remember that in combustion reactions, the products are CO2 and H2O. Let's break it down.

First, balance the atoms. Let's count each element.

Carbon: On the left, it's 8 (from C8H18). On the right, each CO2 has one C, so the number of CO2 molecules should be 8. So that's 8 CO2.

Hydrogen: On the left, it's 18 (from C8H18). On the right, each H2O has 2 H, so the number of H2O molecules should be 9 (because 2 * 9 = 18). So 9 H2O.

Oxygen: On the left, O2 is the only source. On the right, CO2 has 8*(2) = 16 O, and H2O has 9*(1)=9 O. So total O on the right is 16 +9=25 O. So the left side must have 25 O atoms, which comes from O2. Since each O2 has 2 O, the number of O2 molecules is 25/2 = 12.5 O2 molecules.

So the balanced equation is: C8H18 + 12.5 O2 → 8 CO2 + 9 H2O.

Wait, but let me double-check the atoms.

C: 8 on each side. Correct.

H: 18 on each side. Correct.

O: Left: 12.5 *2 =25. Right: 8*2 +9*1 =16 +9=25. Correct.

So the balanced equation is correct.

Now, I need to find out how much O2 is consumed when 1 pound of C8H18 is burned.

Wait, wait, the problem says the reaction uses C8H18 with O2 to form CO2 and H2O. So the amount of O2 required depends on the amount of C8H18.

But the problem is about the air needed. Air is 23.19% O2 and 75.46% N2. But since the reaction only involves O2, the N2 in the air can be ignored. So the amount of O2 in the air is 23.19% of the air's weight.

Wait, but the question is about the amount of air needed. So the air's weight is such that 23.19% of it is O2, and the rest is N2. But since N2 isn't involved, the mass of N2 in the air doesn't affect the reaction. So the mass of the air is the same as the mass of the O2 in it.

So the first step is to find the molar masses of the relevant compounds.

Molar mass of C8H18:

Carbon (C) is about 12.01 g/mol. So 8 * 12.01 = 96.08 g/mol.

Hydrogen (H) is about 1.008 g/mol. 18 H atoms → 18 * 1.008 = 18.144 g/mol.

So, total molar mass of C8H18 is 96.08 + 18.144 = 114.224 g/mol.

Molar mass of O2 is 32.00 g/mol (16 * 2).

Molar mass of CO2 is 44.01 g/mol (12 + 16 *2).

Molar mass of H2O is 18.02 g/mol (2 *1.008 + 16).

But I think I don't need those unless I'm calculating the products. So back to the main point.

We have 1 pound of C8H18. We need to find out how many moles of C8H18 that is, then determine how many moles of O2 are required, then find how much air (in terms of mass) is needed.

So let's go step by step.

First, convert 1 pound of C8H18 to grams. Since 1 pound is 453.592 grams.

Molar mass of C8H18 is approximately 114.224 g/mol (calculated as 8*12.01 + 18*1.008 = 96.08 + 18.144 = 114.224 g/mol.)

So moles of C8H18 = 453.592 g / 114.224 g/mol ≈ let me calculate that.

453.592 / 114.224 = Let's see: 114 *4 is 456, which is a bit more than 453.592. So it's about 3.95 moles.

Wait, 114.224 times 3.95: 114 *3 = 342, 114 *0.95=108.3 → 342 +108.3=450.3. So 3.95 *114.224 is approximately 450.3. But 453.592 is a bit more. So 3.95 is a bit low. Let me compute it more precisely.

453.592 divided by 114.224.

Let me do 453.592 / 114.224.

Let me compute 114.224 *4 = 456.896. So 453.592 is a bit less than 4 times.

So 4 *114.224 = 456.896.

453.592 is 3.304 less than 456.896.

So 453.592 = 4 * 114.224 - 3.304.

So 4 - (3.304 /114.224) → 3.304 /114.224 ≈ 0.02885.

So 4 - 0.02885 = 3.97115.

So moles of C8H18 ≈ 3.97115 mol.

But wait, more accurately, let me compute 453.592 / 114.224.

Let me do it step by step:

114.224 × 3.95 = ?

Well, 3.95 *114.224.

114.224 * 3 = 342.672.

114.224 * 0.95 = ?

114.224 *0.9=102.8016.

114.224 *0.05=5.7112.

Total 102.8016 +5.7112= 108.5128.

So 3.95 *114.224 = 342.672 +108.5128=451.1848.

But our value is 453.592, which is 453.592 -451.1848=2.4072 more.

So 2.4072 /114.224 ≈ 0.0210.

So total moles ≈3.95 +0.021=3.971 mol.

So about 3.971 moles of C8H18.

Now, according to the balanced equation, each mole of C8H18 requires 12.5 moles of O2. So 3.971 mol *12.5 = let's compute that.

3.971 *12.5 = Let's 3 *12.5=37.5, 0.971 *12.5≈12.1375. So total is 37.5 +12.1375=49.6375 mol O2.

So, 49.6375 moles of O2 are required.

Now, since the air consists of 23.19% O2 by mass, we need to find the mass of the air that contains 49.6375 moles of O2.

Wait, but how do we relate moles of O2 to the mass of air?

Because air is 23.19% O2 by mass, so for every 100g of air, 23.19g is O2. But we need to find the mass of air (let's call it 'm') such that 23.19% of it is O2, which equals 49.6375 moles.

Wait, but the moles of O2 in the air is 49.6375 mol.

So, the mass of O2 in the air is moles * molar mass of O2.

O2 molar mass is 32 g/mol, so 49.6375 *32=1588.4 g.

Wait, no, wait. Because the moles of O2 is 49.6375. So mass of O2 is 49.6375 *32 = 1588.4 g.

But the mass of the air is 'm', and in that air, 23.19% is O2. So 23.19% of m equals 1588.4 grams.

So, 0.2319 * m = 1588.4 g.

Solve for m: m = 1588.4 / 0.2319.

Calculate that: 1588.4 / 0.2319 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1588.4 ÷ 0.2319.

First, approximate 0.2319 is about 0.23.

So 1588.4 /0.23 ≈ 7300 (since 0.23 *7300 = 1679, which is a bit higher than 1588.4, so maybe a bit less than 7300.)

Let me compute 0.23 times 6870: 0.23 *6870 = 1580.1.

Wait, 6870 *0.23 = let's see: 6000*0.23=1380; 800*.23=184; 70*.23=16.1. So 1380+184=1564; 1564+16.1=1580.1.

So 6870 → 1580.1.

We have 1588.4, which is a bit more than 1580.1.

So 6870 gives 1580.1. So the difference is 1588.4-1580.1=8.3.

Each 1 unit in m gives 0.23 of m in the O2 mass.

So 8.3 /0.23 = approx 36.087.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, perhaps I should compute 8.3 /0.23 = let's see, 0.23 *36 =8.28, so 36.087. So adding that to 6870, 6870 +36.087≈6906.087 grams.

So m≈6906.09 grams.

Wait, but I'm getting this from the calculation. So the mass of air is approximately 6906.09 grams.

But wait, that's per kilogram? No, grams.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my approach.

Another approach: The mass of O2 in the air is 49.6375 moles *32 g/mol =1588.4 g.

Since O2 is 23.19% of the air by mass, then:

23.19% of air's mass = 1588.4 g.

So air's mass = 1588.4 g / 0.2319 = approximately 6870 grams or 6.87 kg.

Wait, 6870 grams is about 6.87kg.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option A: 16.16 lbs, which is about 7.64 kg. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, did I make a mistake here?

Wait, another thought: Wait, perhaps I confused grams and pounds. Let me check the unit conversions.

Wait, wait, the calculation I'm doing is in grams. But the question asks for pounds.

So, 6906.09 grams is equal to 6906.09 /453.592 ≈15.25 pounds.

Wait, wait, let me compute that.

1588.4 grams is the mass of O2 (in grams). So 1588.4 g / 0.2319 =6870 grams.

Wait, 6870 grams is 6.87 kg. 6.87 kg is about 15.25 pounds (since 1 kg =2.20462 pounds).

So 6.87 kg *2.20462 ≈ 15.15 pounds.

Looking at the options, option H is 15.10 lbs. That's close.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my stoichiometry.

Wait, the balanced equation was C8H18 +12.5 O2 → 8 CO2 +9 H2O.

So, 1 mole of C8H18 uses 12.5 moles O2.

But, wait, in the calculation, I found moles of C8H18 as about 3.97115 moles, so O2 needed is 3.97115 *12.5 = 49.639375 moles.

Then, the mass of O2 is 49.639375 *32 g/mol = 1588.46 g.

So the air mass: 1588.46 g /0.2319 = approx 6870 g =6.87 kg.

Convert kg to pounds: 6.87 kg * (2.20462 lb/kg) ≈ 15.15 lb.

So the answer is approximately 15.15 lbs, which is closest to option H:15.10 lbs.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for any errors.

Alternative approach: Maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Another approach: Find the moles of C8H18, then find moles of O2 needed, then find the mass of air that contains this moles.

Wait, perhaps I should find the mole ratio of O2 to C8H18.

Wait, from the balanced equation, 1 mole of C8H18 uses 12.5 moles O2.

So moles of O2 = 12.5 * moles of C8H18.

Moles of C8H18 is 3.97115. So 12.5 *3.97115 =49.639375 moles O2.

Mass of O2 is 49.639375 *32=1588.46 g.

Air mass: 1588.46 g /0.2319 = 6870 g.

6870 grams is 6.87 kg.

Convert kg to pounds: 6.87 kg * 2.20462 ≈ 15.15 lb.

So the correct answer is approximately 15.15 lb, which is option H.

Wait, but why is the option D 14.14, which is lower? Did I miscalculate?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Let me recompute the moles of C8H18.

1 pound is 453.592 grams.

Molar mass C8H18 is 114.224 g/mol.

So moles =453.592 /114.224 ≈3.97115 mol.

Then, moles O2 required =12.5 *3.97115 =49.639375 mol.

Mass of O2:49.639375 *32 =1588.46 g.

Air mass is 1588.46 g /0.2319 =6870 g.

6870 grams is 6.87 kg. 6.87 kg *2.20462≈15.15 lb.

So the correct answer is option H:15.10 lbs.

Wait, but let me think again. The question says "how many pounds of air". So I think the calculation is correct.

So, the answer is H:15.10 lbs.

Wait, but why is the first option A 16.16? That would be 7.64kg. Which is way higher.

Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the mole ratio.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the moles of O2 needed per mole of C8H18.

From the balanced equation, 1 mole C8H18 →12.5 moles O2.

So, moles O2 needed =12.5 * moles C8H18.

Molar mass of C8H18 is 114.224 g/mol.

Moles of C8H18:453.592 /114.224 =3.97115 mol.

Moles O2 needed:3.97115 *12.5=49.639375 mol.

Mass of O2:49.639375 *32=1588.46 g.

Air mass:1588.46 g /0.2319=6870 g=6.87 kg.

Convert kg to pounds:6.87 *2.20462≈15.15 lb.

So the answer is 15.15 lb, which is closest to H:15.10 lbs.

So the correct answer is H.

To determine how many pounds of air are needed to burn 1 pound of gasoline (C₈H₁₈), we analyze the reaction and use stoichiometry:

### Step 1: Write the balanced combustion reaction
The reaction is:
\[
\text{C}_8\text{H}_{18} + 12.5 \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 8 \text{CO}_2 + 9 \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]
From the balanced equation, 1 mole of C₈H₁₈ reacts with 12.5 moles of O₂.

### Step 2: Convert 1 pound of C₈H₁₈ to moles
The molar mass of C₈H₁₈ is:
\[
(8 \times 12.01) + (18 \times 1.008) = 96.08 + 18.144 = 114.224 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
\[
\text{Moles of C}_8\text{H}_{18} = \frac{453.592 \, \text{g}}{114.224 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 3.97115 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate moles of O₂ required
From the balanced equation:
\[
1 \, \text{mol C}_8\text{H}_{18} \rightarrow 12.5 \, \text{mol O}_2
\]
\[
\text{Moles of O}_2 = 3.97115 \times 12.5 = 49.639375 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mass of O₂ required
The molar mass of O₂ is:
\[
32.00 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
\[
\text{Mass of O}_2 = 49.639375 \, \text{mol} \times 32.00 \, \text{g/mol} = 1588.46 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 5: Relate mass of O₂ to mass of air
Air is 23.19% O₂ by mass. Let \( m \) be the mass of air in grams:
\[
0.2319 \, m = 1588.46 \, \text{g}
\]
\[
m = \frac{1588.46}{0.2319} \approx 6870 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 6: Convert mass of air to pounds
\[
1 \, \text{kg} = 2.20462 \, \text{lb}, \quad 1 \, \text{g} = 0.00220462 \, \text{lb}
\]
\[
6870 \, \text{g} \times 0.00220462 \, \text{lb/g} \approx 15.15 \, \text{lb}
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest option is **H: 15.10 lbs**.

ANSWER: H
