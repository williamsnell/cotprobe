Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about a six-month-old child's adaptive response. The question says the child shows distress when an attachment figure leaves. I remember that in psychology, especially in child development, attachment styles are important. 

First, I need to recall what each of these options refers to. The options are labeled from A to J, each corresponding to a different type of attachment disorder. The question is asking for the adaptive response, which I think relates to the child's problem-solving or adjustment when faced with a change in their attachment.

The child is six months old. I know that younger children often have more flexible attachment styles. They might not be as attachment-focused as adults, so they might not show as much distress when things change. But the question says they show distress, so maybe it's a sign that they're not adapting well yet.

Looking at the options:

A: Reactive attachment disorder – I think reactive means they respond to situations, but they might not show a problem if the situation changes. They might just react without understanding.

B: Separation anxiety – I'm not sure. Separation anxiety is more common in older children or adults. Maybe a six-month-old would have more of an adaptive response rather than anxiety.

C: Stranger anxiety – That seems more like a behavior issue, like fear of encountering something unfamiliar, but I'm not certain if that's the term for it.

D: Avoidant attachment – This is when the child avoids situations where it might be risky. That doesn't seem right because when the attachment figure leaves, which is a risk situation, they're showing distress.

E: Secure attachment – Secure means the child is comfortable around the attachment, so they wouldn't show distress when the figure leaves. So E doesn't fit.

F: Ambivalent attachment – That's when the child likes but is unsure about the attachment. If the child is showing distress, maybe they're not feeling secure, but I'm not sure how that ties in.

G: Attachment anxiety – This term is a bit tricky. I think attachment anxiety is more about the child's fear of changing attachments. So maybe that's the answer here.

H: Object permanence – That's about understanding that objects have existed before they appear. Not directly related to showing distress when the attachment figure leaves.

I: Dependent attachment – This is when the child is dependent on the attachment for stability. If the figure leaves, they might feel insecure, but I'm not sure if that's the same as showing distress.

J: Disorganized attachment – That's a different stage, more about the structure of the attachment. I don't think it fits here.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The child shows distress when the attachment figure leaves. So, they're struggling to adjust. In six months, they might not have a strong attachment. Maybe they're struggling to understand that leaving the attachment figure is a problem, leading to stress or anxiety.

The options: B is separation anxiety. Separation anxiety is when a child feels anxious because they don't understand the consequences of leaving an attachment. So if the child shows distress, that's a sign of separation anxiety. That would be option B.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: The question says "adaptive response." Adaptive responses are ways the child reacts to changes. So in this case, the child's response to the attachment figure leaving is their adaptive response. That might point to something like separation anxiety.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is asking what the adaptive response is. The adaptive response is the child's reaction to the situation. So when the attachment figure leaves, the child's reaction is their adaptive response.

But the options are about the type of disorder. Oh, I see, the question is asking what the child is known for. So the adaptive response in terms of their behavior.

Wait, now I'm getting confused because the question says the child shows distress, which is an adaptive response. So the question is, in terms of their disorder, what is that called. So the options are types of disorders.

Wait, the options are types of disorders. So the question is asking what type of disorder the child has, based on their distress when the attachment leaves.

So, for example, they might be exhibiting signs of a problem, like separation anxiety. Which is a type of disorder.

Looking at the options again:

B: Separation anxiety – that's a type of disorder. So if the child is showing distress, that might be the adaptive response, but I'm not sure if it's the correct term for the disorder. Alternatively, maybe it's a form of attachment disorder.

Wait, another angle. The question is about the adaptive response. The adaptive response is the child's way of coping. So when the attachment figure is gone, the child is feeling anxious. That's their adaptive response.

But the question is asking what that is in terms of the disorder. So the correct answer is the type of disorder that fits this. The options are types of disorders, not the response.

So the child is showing distress when the attachment figure leaves, which is a sign of a specific disorder. For a six-month-old, who is just learning, they might not be showing much distress yet, but the distress suggests a problem. So this could be an example of separation anxiety, which is a form of attachment disorder. Or maybe it's a more general form of anxiety called attachment anxiety.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think about the options again. The question is about the adaptive response, but the options are types of disorders. So which disorder would a six-month-old show when the attachment figure leaves?

Wait, I think the correct answer is B: separation anxiety. Because when they try to separate, they might feel anxious, and that's a type of anxiety disorder.

The correct answer is **B: separation anxiety**. The child's distress when the attachment figure leaves indicates a heightened fear or anxiety, which is a characteristic of separation anxiety—a type of attachment disorder. This behavior suggests the child is struggling to understand the consequences of leaving an attachment, leading to anxiety. 

Answer: B
