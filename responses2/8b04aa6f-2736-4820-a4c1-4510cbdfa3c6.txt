Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about the first First Lady to run for political office. Let's see. So the question is asking which of the options listed was the first female First Lady to become president of the United States.

First, I need to remember the timeline of women's leadership in the U.S. presidency. I know that the first female president was Emma Upton, but I'm not sure if she was the first First Lady. Let me think. The first female First Lady to hold the office was Rosalynn Carter. I remember her being the first female woman to serve as the first female First Lady. She was the first female to take the position of First Lady of the United States, I believe.

Looking at the options provided, option C is Rosalynn Carter. So the correct answer should be C. The other options are either presidents or past presidents, like Betty Ford, Laura Bush, etc., who were men, and the others are more recent women in politics but not the first female First Lady. So the answer is definitely C.
