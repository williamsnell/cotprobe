Okay, so I have this problem here where Mr. Darnell bought some shares of stock and sold them after two months. I need to figure out the loss per share and the total loss. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says he bought 20 shares at $182.50 each. So I should calculate the total cost he incurred. That would be 20 multiplied by 182.50. Let me do that: 20 times 182.50. Hmm, 182.50 times 20 is 3650. So he spent $3,650 in total.

Then, after two months, he sold those shares at $168.75 each. So the total amount he got from selling is 20 shares times 168.75. Let me calculate that. 168.75 * 20. Well, 168 * 20 is 3360, and 0.75 * 20 is 15, so total is 3375. So he got $3,375 after selling.

Now, to find the loss, I subtract the selling price total from the buying price total. So that's 3650 minus 3375. Let me do that subtraction: 3650 minus 3375 equals 275. So the total loss is $275.

Wait, but the question asks for the loss per share and the total. So per share loss would be the total loss divided by the number of shares. 275 divided by 20. Let me compute that. 20 goes into 275 twelve times (12*20=240), with a remainder of 35. Then 35 divided by 20 is 1.75. So 12.75 per share. That's the loss per share.

Looking at the options, the per share loss is $12.75 and total loss is $275. So I need to find the option that matches both. Let me check the options.

Option F: $12.75 per share, total loss $255. Wait, that can't be right because I calculated $275. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate the totals. He bought 20 shares at $182.50 each. So 182.50 *20. Let me compute that: 182.50 * 20 is 3650. Correct. He sold each share for $168.75, so 168.75 *20. Let's compute that: 168.75 * 20. 168 *20 is 3360, 0.75*20 is 15, so total is 3375. Correct.

Total loss is 3650 - 3375 = 275. Right. So per share is 275 / 20 = 13.75. Wait, no, 275 divided by 20 is 13.75? Wait, wait, 20 times 13 is 260, 20 times 13.75 is 275. Yes. So per share loss is $13.75. And total loss is $275.

Looking back at the options, option J says $13.75 per share, total loss $275.00. So that's the correct answer.

The correct option is J: $13.75 per share, total loss $275.00.
