Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the total sale amount for a gas station. Hmm, let me read through it again. The motorist buys 13 and 6/10 gallons of gas at $0.539 per gallon, and 2 quarts of oil at $1.10 per quart. I need to find the total cost and choose the correct option from A to J.

Wait, let me break this down. First, I should calculate the cost of the gas and then the cost of the oil. Then add them together.

Starting with the gas. The quantity is 13 and 6/10 gallons. Let me convert that to a decimal. 6/10 is 0.6, so 13.6 gallons. Got it. The price per gallon is $0.539. So, I need to multiply 13.6 gallons by $0.539 to get the total gas cost.

Hmm, calculating 13.6 * 0.539. Let me do this step by step. Maybe I can break it into 10 + 3.6 parts. Wait, alternatively, I can approximate. Let me think. 13 * 0.539 is (10 + 3) * 0.539. 10 * 0.539 is 5.39, and 3 * 0.539 is 1.617, so together that's 5.39 + 1.617 = 7.007. Then the 0.6 part: 0.6 * 0.539 is 0.3234. So total gas cost is 7.007 + 0.3234 = 7.3304. So approximately $7.33.

Wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. Let me compute 13.6 * 0.539.

Alternative approach: 13.6 * 0.5 = 6.8. Then 13.6 * 0.039. Let me compute that. 13.6 * 0.03 is 0.408, and 13.6 * 0.009 is 0.1224. So adding those gives 0.408 + 0.1224 = 0.5304. So total is 6.8 + 0.5304 = 7.3304. So $7.33 for the gas.

Next, the oil. The motorist buys 2 quarts. The price is $1.10 per quart. So 2 * 1.10 is $2.20.

Now, add the two amounts together. $7.33 (gas) + $2.20 (oil) = $9.53. So the total sale is $9.53.

Looking at the options, option J is $9.53. So the answer should be J.

The total sale is calculated by adding the cost of gas and oil. Gas: 13.6 gallons at $0.539/gallon = $7.33. Oil: 2 quarts at $1.10/quart = $2.20. Total = $7.33 + $2.20 = $9.53. The correct answer is J.

Answer: J
