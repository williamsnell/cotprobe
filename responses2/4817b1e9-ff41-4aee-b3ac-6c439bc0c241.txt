Okay, so I have this question here asking for the mean of a set of data. The data given is 18, 9, 9, 10, 11, 14, 30, 19. Hmm, I remember that the mean is calculated by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by how many numbers there are. Let me try to do this step by step.

First, I should list all the numbers: 18, 9, 9, 10, 11, 14, 30, 19. Wait, that's eight numbers in total. So, I need to add them up. Let me start adding them one by one.

Starting with 18. Then add 9: 18+9 is 27. Next, add another 9: 27+9 is 36. Then 10: 36+10 is 46. Then 11: 46+11 is 57. Next, 14: 57+14 is 71. Then 30: 71+30 is 101. Finally, add 19: 101+19 is 120. So the total sum is 120.

Now, since there are 8 numbers, I divide the sum by 8. So, 120 divided by 8. Let me calculate that. 8 goes into 120 exactly 15 times because 8*15 is 120. So the mean is 15.

Looking at the options, option D is 15. So the correct answer should be D.

The mean is calculated by adding all the values and dividing by the number of values. Adding 18, 9, 9, 10, 11, 14, 30, and 19 gives a total of 120. Divided by 8, the mean is 15. The correct answer is D.

Answer: D: 15
