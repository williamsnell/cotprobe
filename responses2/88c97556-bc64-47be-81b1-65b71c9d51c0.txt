Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. The question is about calculating the momentum uncertainty of a tennis ball in a fence enclosure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the problem says the tennis ball is constrained in a 35-meter-long fence. Wait, so the uncertainty in position must be related to the size of the enclosure. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I remember the formula is Δp * Δx ≥ ħ/2 or something like that. But I'm a bit confused about the exact formula.

Wait, the general form is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So if I can find Δx, the uncertainty in position, I can solve for Δp, the uncertainty in momentum. But in this case, the problem says the ball is constrained to be in the fence, which is 35 meters long. So the uncertainty in position Δx would be the size of the fence, 35 meters. Is that right? Like, the ball can't move beyond that, so the minimum uncertainty is the size of the fence.

So Δx = 35 meters. Now, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So to find Δp, I rearrange it to Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). Wait, no, the formula is Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) when you solve for Δp. Or wait, maybe it's the other way: Δp ≤ ħ/(2Δx)? I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, the HUP says the product of the uncertainties is at least ħ/2. So if I have Δx as 35 m, then Δp is at least ħ/(2Δx). But wait, the question is asking for the momentum uncertainty. So perhaps I need to calculate the minimum possible Δp, which would be equal to ħ/(2Δx) in the best case.

But wait, I should probably confirm the exact expression. The general form is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So if I want to find Δp, it's ≥ (ħ/2) / Δx. So substituting in, that would be (h-bar divided by 2) divided by 35 meters.

Let me think about the units. ħ has units of J·s, which is kg·m²/s. So ħ/2 is in kg·m²/s. Divided by Δx (meters) gives kg·m²/s / m = kg·m/s, which is the unit for momentum (kg·m/s). So that makes sense.

Now, the value of ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. So let me plug that in.

So Δp ≥ (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 35 m)

Calculate the denominator first: 2 * 35 =70.

So 1.0545718e-34 divided by 70. Let me compute that. 1.0545718 /70 is approximately 0.01506531. So 0.01506531e-34 = 1.506531e-36 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, the HUP gives a lower bound on the product. So the minimum possible Δp is 1.5e-36 kg·m/s. But the question is about the uncertainty, so I think that's the value they're expecting.

Looking at the options, option A is 3e-36, B is 6e-36, but wait, wait. Wait, let me recalculate. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the calculation is (1.0545718e-34 kg·m²/s) / (2*35 m) ) = (1.0545718e-34) / 70.

Let me compute 1.0545718e-34 /70. 70 is 7e1, so 1.0545718e-34 /7e1 = (1.0545718/7) * 1e-35 = approx 0.1506531 * 1e-35 = 1.506531e-36 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 3e-36, which is double that. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait another thought: Oh wait, maybe I should use the reduced Planck constant, but I think here it's standard ħ, which is h/(2π). So no, I think that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. So if Δx is 35 m, then Δp is at least ħ/(2Δx). So our calculation should be correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are around 1.5e-36, except perhaps option B is 6e-36, which is twice that. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 1.05457e-34 / 70, let me compute it more accurately.

70 is 7e1. So 1.05457e-34 /7e1 = (1.05457 /7) * 1e-35 = approximately 0.150653 *1e-35 = 1.50653e-36.

So the minimum Δp is about 1.5e-36. But the options are A:3e-36, which is double that. Did I miss a factor of 2 somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the direction of the fence enclosure. Alternatively, maybe I mixed up the formula. Let me think: the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2. So if Δx is 35 m, then Δp must be at least (1.05457e-34 kg m²/s) / (2 *35 m) )= 1.05457e-34 /70.

Wait, wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use Δx=35 m, and compute Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) = (1.05457e-34) / (70) = 1.5e-36 as before.

But none of the options are 1.5e-36 except option B is 6e-36, which is double that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in units?

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the problem is using the reduced Planck constant (h-bar) as ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s, which is correct. So our calculation should be correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the ball's mass. Oh, the tennis ball's mass. Wait, the tennis ball's mass is a factor here. Wait, the problem doesn't give the mass of the tennis ball. Oh no, that's a problem. Because the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle requires knowing the mass of the particle.

Wait, that's a big issue. The question doesn't give the mass of the tennis ball. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach or perhaps I'm missing some other information.

Wait, wait, the problem says the fence is 35 meters long. So perhaps the length of the enclosure is 35 m, but the ball's position in that enclosure is uncertain by Δx = 35 m. So the momentum uncertainty is calculated using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

But without knowing the mass, I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem is missing some data? Or maybe I'm missing another approach.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum uncertainty of the tennis ball. Without knowing its mass, it's impossible to calculate the exact value. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, wait, perhaps the problem is considering the uncertainty in position as the length of the fence. So maybe the uncertainty in position is the size of the fence, which is 35 m, correct.

But without the mass of the ball, I can't compute the exact value. So perhaps the problem is designed such that the mass cancels out or is not needed. Wait, perhaps the mass comes from the tennis ball's velocity, but that's not given.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check: the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in terms of momentum and position is Δp Δx ≥ ħ/2. So Δp ≥ ħ/(2 Δx).

Wait, but let's think about units again. If Δp is in kg m/s, then 35 meters is Δx. So yeah, the calculation is correct.

But wait, the options don't have 1.5e-36. There's option B:6e-36, which is twice that. Maybe I made a miscalculation, perhaps the denominator is 35*2=70, but perhaps it's 35* something else.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to use a different value for ħ. Like, the reduced Planck constant is ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34, which I think is correct. So that's not the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the length of the fence is not 35 meters, but 35 centimeters? No, the question says 35 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

1.05457e-34 / 70 = (1.05457 /70) * 1e-34.

1.05457 /70 = 0.0150653.

So 0.0150653e-34 = 1.50653e-36 kg m/s.

But none of the options match that except perhaps option B is 6e-36.

Wait, what if I got the formula wrong? Wait, perhaps the formula is Δp ≥ ħ/(Δx), without the 2. But that would give (1.05457e-34)/(35) = approximately 3e-36.

Wait, that's option A. Which is 3e-36.

Wait, but the HUP is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. So if I didn't consider the 2, then Δp would be about 3e-36, which is option A.

But why would I think that? Because perhaps the formula as I know it is Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). So if I used the formula without the 2, I would get 1.05457e-34/35 = approx 3e-36, which would be option A.

So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the problem was stated incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps I misremembered the formula.

Wait, let me check the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle's exact form. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is usually written as Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. So that's correct.

So in that case, the correct calculation would be 1.05457e-34/(2*35) = 1.05457e-34/70 ≈ 1.5e-36. But the options don't have that.

So perhaps the problem intended to use the formula without the 2, which gives about 3e-36. That would be option A.

Wait, but that's inconsistent with the standard HUP. So why would the problem expect that?

Alternatively, perhaps the length of the fence is 35 m, but the ball is a point particle. So, in that case, the uncertainty in position is 35 m. So, using the HUP, the minimum uncertainty in momentum is ħ/(2*35) = 1.05457e-34/(70) ≈ 1.5e-36, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for ħ. Let me double-check the value of ħ.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the division. Let me compute 1.05457e-34 divided by 70 accurately.

So 1.05457e-34 divided by 70 equals (1.05457/70) * 1e-34.

1.05457 / 70 = ?

Let me compute that.

70 × 0.015 is 1.05. So 0.015 ×70=1.05. But we have 1.05457. So 0.0150653... ×70= 1.05457.

So yes, 1.05457 /70 = 0.0150653.

So 0.0150653e-34 = 1.50653e-36 kg·m/s.

Which is approximately 1.5e-36 kg·m/s. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 3e-36, which is option A. But that would be the case if I used the formula without the 2, i.e., Δp ≥ ħ/Δx, which would give (1.05e-34)/(35)= approx 3e-36.

But that would be incorrect because the correct formula should have the 2 in the denominator. Unless the problem uses a different formulation.

Wait, maybe the problem uses the uncertainty in position as the entire length, 35 m, and the formula is presented without the 2.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to use the formula as Δp ≥ ħ/(Δx), which would give 3e-36.

But that would imply that the correct option is A:3e-36.

But I think that's not correct since the HUP requires the 2 in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in terms of momentum and position with the 2. So the correct calculation gives 1.5e-36, but perhaps the options have 3e-36, which is option A.

But in the options, option A is 3e-36, which is exactly double the correct value. So why would that happen?

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute 1.05457e-34 /70 again.

1.05457e-34 divided by 70 equals (1.05457 /70) × 1e-34.

1.05457 /70 = 0.0150653.

So 0.0150653e-34 = 1.50653e-36 kg m/s.

But the closest option to this is option A:3e-36, which is double. So perhaps the correct answer is B:6e-36, which is three times, or perhaps it's (1.05e-34)/(35) = 3e-36.

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different approximation, like 1.05e-34 ~ 1e-34. Then 1e-34/35 is about 3e-36.

So perhaps the intended answer is option B:6e-36, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other possible approaches. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses the momentum uncertainty as the product of the mass and velocity uncertainty. But without knowing the mass, I can't compute that.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the ball's velocity to compute the uncertainty. But the question doesn't provide any velocity data. The problem only says the ball is constrained in a 35 m fence. So I can't proceed without the mass.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) and the answer is 1.5e-36, but none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use Δp = ħ/(Δx), which would give 3e-36, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between position and momentum. Let me think: the uncertainty in position (Δx) is 35 m. So the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is at least ħ/(2Δx). So the correct value is about 1.5e-36. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the formula as Δp ≥ ħ/(Δx), which would give 3e-36, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the 2 factor, thinking that the Heisenberg Uncertainty uses ħ/Δx, not ħ/(2Δx). For example, some implementations might omit the 2 in the formula.

In that case, the correct answer would be option A:3e-36.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value of ħ. But I think that's not the case.

In any case, the conclusion is that the correct momentum uncertainty is approximately 1.5e-36, but the closest option is A:3e-36. But wait, that would be double the correct value. So perhaps the intended answer is A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look for possible mistakes in the problem statement. Let me see: the fence is 35 meters, but perhaps the problem expects the ball's mass to be 0.06 kg? Because 0.06 kg * 35 m = 2.1 kg m. Then, the uncertainty in momentum would be 1.05e-34 / (35) = 3e-36 kg m/s. If I compute 0.06 kg, then 0.06 *35 = 2.1, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, if the mass were 0.02 kg, then 0.02 *35=0.7 kg. Then, momentum uncertainty would be 1.05e-34 /0.7= 1.5e-33, which is way higher than any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the problem differently. Let me think about the units.

Wait, the momentum's units are kg·m/s. So (kg·m/s) is the unit of momentum. So the calculation of 1.5e-36 kg·m/s is correct.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Heisenberg Uncertainty in a different way. For example, perhaps the formula is written as Δp ≥ (ħ/2) / Δx, which would be the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula as Δp ≥ (ħ/Δx), but that would be incorrect, as the correct formula includes the 2.

So considering all this, the correct momentum uncertainty is approximately 1.5e-36, but the options don't include this. So perhaps the intended answer is option A:3e-36, assuming that the problem omits the 2 in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 1.05e-34 divided by 70 again.

1.05e-34 /70 = (1.05/70) * 1e-34 = 0.015 *1e-34 = 1.5e-36. So that's correct.

So, in the absence of an option matching the correct calculation, perhaps the intended answer is option A:3e-36, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use the formula without the 2, which would give Δp = 3e-36, which is option A.

So I think the correct answer is option A:3e-36.
</think>

To calculate the momentum uncertainty of the tennis ball constrained to a 35 m fence, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP):

\[
\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Rearranging for \(\Delta p\):

\[
\Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}
\]

### Given Data:
- \(\Delta x = 35 \, \text{m}\)
- \(\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\)

### Calculation:
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\Delta p \geq \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 35}
\]

\[
\Delta p \geq \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{70}
\]

\[
\Delta p \geq 1.506531 \times 10^{-36} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]

### Analysis of Options:
The calculated value is approximately \(1.5 \times 10^{-36} \, \text{kg·m/s}\), but none of the options match this value exactly. The closest option is **A: 3 × 10⁻³⁶**, which is double the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests a possible misunderstanding of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, where the formula might be expressed without the factor of 2.

### Conclusion:
Given the options provided, the most reasonable choice is **A: 3 × 10⁻³⁶**, assuming the problem omits the factor of 2 in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle formula.
