Okay, so I've got this problem about a right circular cylinder. The question is asking for the ratio of the radius R to the height H that minimizes the surface area A, given a fixed volume V. Hmm, I remember that for optimization problems, we use calculus, specifically taking derivatives and setting them to zero to find minima or maxima.

Let me start by writing down the formulas I know. The volume V of a right circular cylinder is given by V = πR²H. Since the volume is fixed, that means V is a constant. The surface area A of a cylinder includes both the top and bottom circles and the side (which is like a rectangle when unrolled). So A = 2πR² (for the two circles) plus the lateral surface area, which is 2πR times the height H. So the formula is A = 2πR² + 2πRH.

Now, I need to express this in terms that involve R and H, and then use the constraint that V is fixed. Since V = πR²H, maybe I can express H in terms of V and R. Let me try that.

From V = πR²H, solve for H: H = V / (πR²). So I can substitute this into the surface area formula to get A in terms of R only.

Substituting H into A: A = 2πR² + 2πR*(V/(πR²)).

Wait, let me compute that step by step. So 2πR² is the first part. The second part is 2πR*(V/(πR²)). The π in the numerator and denominator cancels, as does one R from R in the numerator and R squared from denominator, leaving (2πR * V) / (π R²) = 2V / R.

So A becomes 2πR² + 2V/R.

Now, to find the minimum surface area, I need to take the derivative of A with respect to R and set it equal to zero. Let's compute dA/dR.

dA/dR = derivative of 2πR² is 4πR, and derivative of 2V/R is -2V/R². So putting it together: dA/dR = 4πR - 2V/R².

Set this equal to zero for minima (since it's a positive definite function, this should give the minimum):

4πR - 2V/R² = 0.

Let me solve for R. Bring the 2V/R² to the other side:

4πR = 2V/R².

Multiply both sides by R² to eliminate the denominator:

4πR * R² = 2V => 4πR³ = 2V.

Divide both sides by 2: 2πR³ = V.

Now, solve for R^3: R³ = V/(2π).

Take cube roots: R = [V/(2π)]^(1/3).

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me see if I can express H in terms of R. From earlier, H = V/(πR²). Let me substitute R³ = V/(2π) into this.

Wait, R³ = V/(2π), so V = 2π R³. Plugging into H:

H = (2π R³) / (π R²) = 2R.

So H = 2R. Therefore, the ratio R/H is R/(2R) = 1/2. So R/H = 1/2.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.

Given V = πR²H → H = V/(πR²).

Surface area A = 2πR² + 2πR H.

Substituting H gives A = 2πR² + 2πR*(V/(πR²)) = 2πR² + (2V/R).

Taking derivative: dA/dR = 4πR - 2V/R².

Set to zero: 4πR = 2V/R² → 4πR * R² = 2V → 4πR³ = 2V → 2πR³ = V.

So R³ = V/(2π) → R = (V/(2π))^(1/3).

Then, H = V/(πR²) → H = V/(π*(V³/(2π))^(2/3)).

Wait, let me compute that. Let's compute R² first: R = [V/(2π)]^(1/3) → R² = [V/(2π)]^(2/3).

So H = V/(π * [V/(2π)]^(2/3)).

Simplify the denominator: π * [V/(2π)]^(2/3) = π * (V^(2/3) ) / (2^(2/3) π^(2/3)) ) = π^(1 - 2/3) * V^(2/3) / 2^(2/3) )

Which is π^(1/3) * V^(2/3) / 2^(2/3).

So H = V / [ π^(1/3) V^(2/3) / 2^(2/3) ) ] = V * [ 2^(2/3) / (π^(1/3) V^(2/3)) ) ].

Simplify this: V is V^(1), so V^(1) * V^(-2/3) = V^(1 - 2/3) = V^(1/3).

So H = 2^(2/3) * V^(1/3) / π^(1/3) = (2^2 / π )^(1/3) V^(1/3).

But wait, we know from earlier that R³ = V/(2π), so R³ = V/(2π) → V = 2π R³.

But maybe another approach would help. Alternatively, since H = 2R, then R = H/2.

So R/H = 1/2. So the ratio is 1/2, which is option A: 1/2 H.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The question is asking for R/H. Since R = H/2, R/H is 1/2.

Looking back at the options, option A is 1/2 H, which would be (1/2) times H. So the ratio is 1/2, so the answer is A.

To find the ratio of the radius \( R \) to the height \( H \) of a right-circular cylinder that minimizes the surface area \( A \) for a fixed volume \( V \), we start by expressing the surface area and volume in terms of \( R \) and \( H \).

The volume \( V \) is given by:
\[
V = \pi R^2 H
\]
and the surface area \( A \) is:
\[
A = 2\pi R^2 + 2\pi R H
\]

From the volume equation, we solve for \( H \):
\[
H = \frac{V}{\pi R^2}
\]

Substituting this into the surface area formula:
\[
A = 2\pi R^2 + 2\pi R \left( \frac{V}{\pi R^2} \right) = 2\pi R^2 + \frac{2V}{R}
\]

To minimize \( A \), we take the derivative with respect to \( R \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dR} = 4\pi R - \frac{2V}{R^2} = 0
\]
Solving for \( R \):
\[
4\pi R = \frac{2V}{R^2} \implies 4\pi R^3 = 2V \implies R^3 = \frac{V}{2\pi}
\]

From the volume equation, \( V = \pi R^2 H \), substituting \( R^3 = \frac{V}{2\pi} \) gives:
\[
R^3 = \frac{\pi R^2 H}{2\pi} \implies R^3 = \frac{R^2 H}{2} \implies R = \frac{H}{2}
\]

Thus, the ratio \( \frac{R}{H} \) is:
\[
\frac{R}{H} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The correct answer is **A: \(\frac{1}{2}H\)**.
