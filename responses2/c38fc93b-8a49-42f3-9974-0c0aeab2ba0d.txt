Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here. Let me read it again. The question says that there's a set of measurements that follows a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. I need to find the probability that a randomly selected observation is between 50 and 55. The options are A through J, each with different probabilities.

Hmm, I remember that in a normal distribution, the mean is the center point, and about 68% of the data is within one standard deviation, 95% within two, and 99.7% within three. But wait, this is about a specific range, not the entire spread. 

So, the mean is 50, and the standard deviation is 10. I'm looking for the area under the normal curve between 50 and 55. That is, the probability that a value is greater than the mean but less than one standard deviation above the mean.

In a standard normal distribution (mean 0, standard deviation 1), the area from the mean (0) to one standard deviation (1) is about 0.341. So, that would translate to a probability of 0.341. But wait, in this case, the mean is 50 and the standard deviation is 10, so the numbers are the same, but I don't think the scaling affects the area, just the location. So, the probability should be the same as in the standard normal distribution.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.341. That must be the correct answer.

The correct answer is B: .341.
