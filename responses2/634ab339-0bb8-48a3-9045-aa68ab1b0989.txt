Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about online stock brokerage companies. The question is asking which of the given companies is not an online stock brokerage. The options are A through G. 

First, I need to recall what each of these companies does. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: DLJ Direct. I remember DLJ stands for Direct Bank, which is a financial services company. They do things like checking accounts, savings, and maybe some stocks. Wait, but they don't specifically say they offer brokerage services. I'm not too sure, but I think they are more about bank services than stock brokerage.

Option B: Ameritrade. I know Ameritrade is a big insurance company. They offer various insurance products, including stocks. So that's definitely a brokerage firm.

Option C: E*Trade. I'm pretty sure E*Trade is an online broker. They offer trading services, including stocks, and they do it through their website. That makes them a brokerage.

Option D: Charles Schwab. That's a well-known bank and insurance company. They offer a range of financial services, including stocks. So that's another brokerage.

Option E: Fidelity Investments. Fidelity is a big financial institution. They have both online and mobile services. Their brokerage offerings include stocks. So that's a brokerage too.

Option F: Datek Online. I've heard of Datek before. They offer brokerage services, providing stocks, options, and other financial products. So that's a brokerage.

Option G: EDigital. I'm not as familiar with EDigital, but I think it's another online broker. They might offer stocks and other financial services. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about DLJ Direct. I thought it's a bank, not a brokerage. So if the question is about online stock brokerage, DLJ Direct wouldn't be an option. Let me double-check. 

Yes, online stock brokerage companies are those that provide trading services, like stocks. DLJ Direct is more about bank accounts and financial products, not directly offering trading. So the answer should be A, DLJ Direct.

The correct answer is A: DLJ Direct, as it is not an online stock brokerage firm.
