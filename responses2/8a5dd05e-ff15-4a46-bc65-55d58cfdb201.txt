Okay, so I've got this question about CPA rules, specifically regarding what happens when a CPA discovers an error in a tax return. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question says that a CPA prepares income tax returns for a client. After the client signs and mails the returns, the CPA finds an error. The question is about what the CPA must do according to Treasury Circular 230.

I remember that Treasury Circular 230 is one of the regulations related to tax returns and CPAs. It probably talks about how CPAs should handle errors in their returns.

So, what are the key points of the rules in this document? I think the main points are about promptly informing the client, timely correcting the return, and not making any false claims.

Option A: Promptly resign and cooperate with the successor. That sounds a bit off. CPAs are supposed to cooperate, not maybe resign. Maybe CPA has to inform the successor, but not necessarily resign themselves.

Option B: Prepare an amended return immediately and send to the client. That doesn't seem right. I thought the CPA should inform the client first, not just prepare an amended return immediately. Maybe they can adjust the return as needed, but it's not immediate to send it unless they've already made changes.

Option C: Immediately inform the client's legal counsel. Hmm, that's possible. Maybe the CPA should consult with their legal team to handle the situation. But I'm not sure if the immediate action is required.

Option D: Prepare an amended return within 30 days. That sounds too soon. CPAs have a deadline, right? I think the rule is to correct within 30 days, so 30 days is the timeframe.

Option E: Inform the client of the error. That sounds like a direct action, but I don't think CPAs can just inform the client without consulting the legal team. They need to be aware of the client's situation, so maybe the legal team handles that.

Option F: Take responsibility and pay additional taxes. I'm not sure about this. Maybe if the CPA discovers the error, they need to inform the IRS, but taking responsibility might not be necessary unless they're making a mistake beyond their control. The question is about the CPA, not the IRS.

Option G: Document the error in workpapers. I think workpapers are like the forms CPAs use. So they have to document, but that's more about keeping records, not the immediate action.

Option H: Charge the client for discovering the error. That doesn't make much sense. The client's fee should be covered by their initial return, not the CPA's. So the CPA shouldn't charge the client for that.

Option I: Inform the IRS without notifying the client. That would be too vague. They must be aware of the error, so they should inform the client, not just the IRS.

Option J: Ignore the error because the return is already signed and mailed. No, that's not correct. They should address the error directly.

Wait, according to the rules, when a CPA discovers an error, they are required to inform the client immediately. The immediate action is to notify the client, but perhaps they have to provide a written statement. Also, I think the CPAs have to inform the client but not go into the client's files. So the immediate action is to inform the client, and that's option E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: The correct approach is to promptly inform the client (option E) and then file an amended return (option D, but within 30 days). So, the correct action is to inform the client immediately, then correct the return within 30 days.

So looking back at the options, the correct response would be E and D. But the question is about the first thing the CPA must do: according to the options, the question is which action the CPA must take.

Wait the question says, "According to Treasury Circular 230, the CPA must..." So perhaps they have to inform the client immediately.

Looking at the options, option E is "Inform the client's legal counsel about the error." That's a bit different. Option J is "Ignore the error..." which is wrong.

Alternatively, according to the circular, the first step is to inform the client, then prepare the amended return. So the immediate action is to inform the client. But looking at the options, option E is about informing the client, and option G is about documenting.

Wait, maybe the required step is to inform the client immediately, and then correct the return. So the immediate action is E.

Wait, but I think in the rules, the CPA is required to inform the client immediately about the error. So the correct answer would be E.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought that you need to inform the client immediately, then correct the return within 30 days. So the first step is to inform, which is E.

Alternatively, some sources say that the CPA must inform the client immediately, then correct the return. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is "Inform the client's legal counsel about the error." That's different from informing the client directly. Oh, perhaps that's a different step. Wait, maybe the client's legal counsel is the one who should inform, but the CPA must inform the client.

Another angle: according to the Circular, the CPAs are required to inform the client immediately and notify the legal counsel. So perhaps the correct answer is E, but this might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are: inform the client immediately, then correct the return within 30 days. So the immediate action is to inform the client (option E).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The question is, according to the circular, what must the CPA do. So the options are:

E: inform the client's legal counsel.

Wait, no, the options are:

Looking back, the options are A to J.

Option E: Inform the client's legal counsel about the error.

Option G: Document the error.

Wait, another thought. I remember that in some cases, the CPAs have to notify the client, and then issue an amended return. So the immediate action is to inform the client, and then do the correction. So the answer would be that the CPA must inform the client immediately (option E) and then correct the return within 30 days.

But the question is which action must the CPA take as per the options. So the question is about what must be done, and the options are the possible actions.

The options are about what the CPA must do. So the rules say that the CPA must promptly inform the client (so E), and correct the return within 30 days.

So the correct action is to inform the client immediately, so the correct option is E.

Wait, but some sources say that the initial action is to inform the client, then correct the return, but perhaps the immediate action is to notify the client, and the correction is done later.

So the correct answer is option E: Inform the client's legal counsel about the error. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the immediate action is to inform the client, not the counsel.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: if the error is discovered, the CPA must promptly inform the client, not the legal counsel. So option E is incorrect because it says legal counsel, but the correct immediate action is to inform the client. So perhaps the correct answer is E is incorrect.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct answer is E is the immediate action, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is E, because the client must be informed immediately.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Another approach: I'll try to recall the steps.

The correct steps are: upon discovering an error, the CPA must promptly inform the client (so E is correct for that), and then correct the return within 30 days.

Wait, but the options don't have E as the correction, they have E as the inform. So the first step is to inform the client, which is E.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option G, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: according to the circular, the CPA must inform the client immediately (so E is correct). Then, the client can file an amended return, which is option D.

But the question is what must the CPA do according to the options, not what must be done in sequence. So the immediate action is to inform the client, so the correct option is E.

Wait, but in the options, E is "Inform the client's legal counsel about the error." That's not the same as informing the client. So perhaps the correct immediate action is not to inform the client, but to inform the client's legal team.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think that the instruction is to inform the client immediately, so the correct option is E.

Wait, I'm getting confused between options. Let me try to think about the rules.

The correct answer is that the CPA must inform the client immediately (option E), and then correct the return within 30 days. So the immediate action is E. However, looking at the options, E is the only one that says " informs the client". So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but some sources say that the initial action is to notify the client, then correct the return, but perhaps the immediate action is to notify the client, so the correct answer is E.

So in conclusion, the correct answer is option E.

The question revolves around the actions a CPA must take upon discovering an error in an income tax return, as outlined in Treasury Circular 230. The correct approach is to promptly inform the client immediately, which is option E. The CPA is required to notify the client, and then correct the return within 30 days. Therefore, the immediate action is to inform the client, making option E the correct choice.
