Okay, so I've got this psychology question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what it's about.

The question describes Susan's situation. She took a pill for her allergy, which caused her blood pressure to rise, heart rate to increase, body temperature to go up, and felt angry. Yesterday, when she took the pill, she was with her husband. Now, she's feeling angry because of the side effects.

The question is asking what theory this situation exemplifies. The options are A to J, each corresponding to a different theory.

Let me start by recalling what each theory means.

A) Two-factor theory: This is about the need for internal and external motivation. It's more about why people respond in certain ways, like why people motivate themselves to work harder. Not sure if this applies here.

B) Incentive theory: This is when people are motivated by rewards or punishments. Like getting better grades because of a bonus. Susan took a pill, so maybe her motivation came from the pill's benefits. But I'm not sure if this is the best fit.

C) Opponent-process theory: This is about the brain's response to a situation where the behavior of one person affects another. It's more about social interactions and how others influence behavior. Susan's anger might be due to her husband's actions, maybe because he's the one who caused her to feel angry.

D) Adaptation-level theory: This is about how behavior is chosen to fit a certain level of adaptation. Susan's actions might be towards a certain level, but I'm not sure if this directly explains her feeling angry.

E) Drive-reduction theory: This is about the body's need to reduce internal drive. When Susan felt angry, maybe it's because she felt a need to reduce her internal drive. But I'm not certain about the connection here.

F) Arousal theory: This is about the body's need to lower its internal drive. Like when someone is stressed, their heart rate increases, which is arousal. But again, Susan's anger might be a response to that arousal.

G) Cannon-Bard theory: This is about a behavior influencing a factor that in turn influences the behavior. So, if Susan's anger is a response to the pill's effect, and the pill's effect is influenced by her husband's actions, that could fit. The cannon (pill's effect) causes the bard (her anger), but the bard's reaction might influence the cannon again.

H) Cognitive Appraisal theory: This is about how people judge others' intentions. Susan's anger might be a response to the person she was with yesterday, leading to her feeling angry today. But the question is about the pill's effects, not her interactions, so maybe not.

I) James-Lange theory: This is about the endocrine and nervous systems. Susan's body is responding to the pill via the nervous system, which is part of the drive-reduction theory, but I'm not sure if that's the main point.

J) Drive-reduction theory: This is about reducing a body need. For example, when Susan feels hot, she wants to reduce her need to feel cool. Her anger might be a reaction to that reduction.

Now, looking back at Susan's situation. She took a pill (could be a stimulant), which caused various physical and emotional changes. Her anger is a result of the pill. The act of feeling angry is probably a response to the pill's effects, which were a reduction of internal drive (like stress), so it's a drive-reduction situation. But the question is about the theory that best explains this.

Wait, the question is about the type of theory that exemplifies her experience. So, which theory explains why she felt angry as a result of the pill?

Opponent-process theory (C) is about the brain's response to one person's action affecting another. In Susan's case, her husband's actions (like taking the pill) might have influenced her to feel angry. So, when Susan felt angry, it was because her husband's actions (the pill) caused her to feel a certain way.

But let's see the other options again. Drive-reduction theory (J) is about reducing a need. For example, when Susan was with her husband, he might have lower his need for attention or something, leading to his anger. Her anger is a response to that reduction. But the question is about the pill's effects leading to her anger.

Opponent-process theory (C) seems more about the social or interaction-based reasoning. For example, if Susan's husband's actions (like taking the pill) were the reason she felt angry, that's about the opponent-process.

Alternatively, drive-reduction theory (J) is about the body's need. So, when Susan was with her husband, he might have reduced his internal drive to feel hotter, leading to his anger. Her anger is a response to that reduction.

Wait, but the question is about the cause of her anger—why did she feel angry? The cause is the pill's effects, which are a reduction in internal drive. So, the theory that explains her anger is the reduction of a need, which is drive-reduction.

But the options include J as drive-reduction theory. However, the question is about Susan's experience of feeling angry after taking the pill. So, her anger is a result of the pill's effects.

Wait, but the options may not align with what the question is looking for. Let me try to think about each option again.

Opponent-process theory (C) explains why someone does one thing because it affects another. For example, if someone is angry because their neighbor is angry, they might do something else because of the neighbor's behavior. So, Susan's anger is because of her husband's actions.

But the question is about the pill's effect. The pill's effect is a reduction in her internal drive. So, the theory that explains her anger is the reduction of a need, which is drive-reduction (J). But the question is about the cause. Alternatively, the theory that explains why she felt angry because of the pill is J.

Wait, but the question is about what the scenario exemplifies. It's about the process leading to her feeling angry. So, the process is that the act of taking the pill (the pill's effects) caused her to feel angry. The mechanism is either drive-reduction or opponent-process.

Wait, what is the function of each theory?

Drive-reduction theory (J) is about the body wanting to reduce its internal drive to meet external needs. So, when Susan was with her husband, he might lower his need for attention, leading her to feel angry. That's a reduction of his internal drive, so J applies.

Opponent-process (C) is about the brain's response to one's behavior affecting another's. So, Susan's anger is because her husband's actions (taking the pill) caused it. That's about the interaction between two people's behaviors.

But the question is about Susan's experience of feeling angry after taking the pill. The underlying cause is the pill's effect on her internal drive. So, the theory that explains her anger is J (drive-reduction), because her anger is a response to the reduction of a need.

Wait, but the question is about the theory that the scenario exemplifies. So, it's about why her anger is happening. So, the best fit is J drive-reduction theory.

Alternatively, another approach: Opponent-process theory (C) is about the brain's response to one's own actions leading to a response. So, Susan might have felt angry because of her own actions (like taking the pill), which caused her to feel a certain way.

Wait, but in Susan's case, she took the pill because her husband wanted it. So, her own actions (taking the pill) influenced her emotions, which led to anger. That's opponent-process, where her own actions (the pill) caused her to feel angry.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each option again.

The question is about Susan's experience of feeling angry after taking the pill. So, the cause is the pill's effects, which are a reduction in her internal drive. So, the theory that explains her anger is drive-reduction (J). But the question is about the scenario, not just the cause.

Wait, the question is asking which theory exemplifies the situation. So, the theory is what explains her anger. So, what is the mechanism?

Opponent-process theory (C) is about one's own response influencing another's. For example, if you take a pill and it makes you angry, your anger is a response to taking the pill. So, her anger is a response to her own actions.

In Susan's case, she felt angry because of her own actions (taking the pill) leading to a reduction in her internal drive. So, that's opponent-process.

Wait, but the question is about her situation—why did she feel angry. The answer is that it's because the pill caused her to feel a certain way, which relates to the reduction of a need, making it drive-reduction theory (J).

But the options may not directly address this, but the question is about what theory exemplifies the situation, not the cause.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is J, because her anger is a response to the reduction of her internal drive, which is a concept in drive-reduction theory.

Wait, but the answer options are listed as A-J. Let me see the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A) two-factor theory

B) incentive theory

C) opponent-process theory

D) adaptation-level phenomenon

E) drive-reduction theory

F) Arousal theory

G) Cannon-Bard theory

H) Cognitive Appraisal theory

I) James-Lange theory

J) Drive-reduction theory

So, according to this, drive-reduction theory (J) is about the body wanting to reduce its internal drive. Susan's situation is about the body's need being reduced, leading to her anger.

So, the correct answer would be J, because her anger is a response to the reduction of a need ( Drive-reduction theory).

Alternatively, think about the options. The scenario is about Susan's actions leading to her anger, which is a reduction in a need. So the theory is J.
</think>

The question describes Susan's experience of feeling angry after taking a pill, which caused her blood pressure to rise, heart rate to speed up, body temperature to increase, and her anger. The scenario involves the effects of her actions on her emotions, which can be explained by a psychological theory.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **A: Two-factor theory**: This theory focuses on the need for internal and external motivation. While it explains why people respond in certain ways, it doesn't directly explain Susan's anger.
2. **B: Incentive theory**: This theory attributes behaviors to rewards or punishments. Susan's actions might be seen as a result of external rewards, but it's not the best fit for her anger.
3. **C: Opponent-process theory**: This theory explains how one's own actions influence another's. Susan's anger is a response to her own actions (taking the pill), which fits this theory but focuses on her own response, not the reduction of a need.
4. **D: Adaptation-level phenomenon**: This refers to how behavior fits a certain level of adaptation. Susan's anger is more about a personal experience than an adaptation level.
5. **E: Drive-reduction theory**: This theory explains how the body reduces internal drives to meet external needs. Susan's anger is a response to the reduction of a need, making this a strong fit.
6. **F: Arousal theory**: This is about the body's need to lower internal drive to reduce arousal. While relevant, it doesn't explain Susan's anger as directly as drive-reduction.
7. **G: Cannon-Bard theory**: This theory states that behavior will result in the same behavior. It doesn't apply here.
8. **H: Cognitive Appraisal theory**: This deals with how people judge others, which isn't relevant to Susan's anger.
9. **I: James-Lange theory**: This links endocrine and nervous systems. Susan's situation is about physical effects, not brain processes.
10. **J: Drive-reduction theory**: This explains why the body reduces internal drives to meet needs. Susan's anger is a response to the reduction of a need, making this the best fit.

### Conclusion:
The scenario exemplifies **drive-reduction theory** (J), as Susan's anger is a response to the reduction of a body need, leading to her emotional state.
