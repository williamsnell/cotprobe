Question:

What is meant by the term "normal goods"?

Options:

A: Normal goods are those whose demand is independent of income.
B: Normal goods are those whose demand curve shifts downward with an increase in income.
C: Normal goods are those whose consumption is deemed socially unacceptable as income rises.
D: Normal goods are those whose demand curve shifts upward with a decrease in income.
E: Normal goods are those whose demand curve varies directly with income.
F: Normal goods are those that are replaced by inferior goods as income increases.
G: Normal goods are those whose demand decreases as income increases.
H: Normal goods are those for which demand does not change regardless of changes in the prices of related goods.
I: Normal goods are those that are only purchased by consumers with above-average income.
J: Normal goods are those whose demand increases only with a decrease in the price of complementary goods.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about economics, specifically about what normal goods are. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my microeconomics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which option defines normal goods. The options are A through J, each giving a different definition. I remember that normal goods are related to the income effect. Let me recall: when income increases, the demand for normal goods increases. On the other hand, inferior goods are those where demand decreases as income increases.

Wait, so option B says that normal goods have a demand curve that shifts downward with an increase in income. That sounds right because when income goes up, people buy more of these goods. So their demand increases, which would show as a downward shift in the demand curve.

Looking at the options again, option C talks about social unacceptable consumption. That doesn't sound right. I don't think normal goods are about social acceptability. They're more about personal behavior based on income.

Option D says demand shifts upward when income decreases. Wait, that's the opposite of what I remember. I thought that when income increases, demand increases, so demand curve shifts right (upward). So D is incorrect because it's the opposite.

Option E says demand varies directly with income. That would mean that as income goes up, demand goes up in a straight line. But I think that's the case for normal goods, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, actually, for normal goods, the demand curve is upward sloping, not just a straight line. So maybe E is not correct because it's a general statement, whereas the definition is specific to the income effect.

Option F mentions that normal goods are replaced by inferior goods as income increases. No, that's the opposite. In fact, inferior goods are the ones where demand decreases as income increases. So F is incorrect.

Option G says demand decreases when income increases. That's exactly what I was remembering. So G is correct.

Option H talks about demand not changing with prices of related goods. That's elasticity, not income. So H is about cross elasticity, not about whether a good is normal or inferior. So H is incorrect.

Option I says they are only purchased by those with above-average income. That's the opposite. Normal goods are bought by people with varying incomes, not just above average. So I is incorrect.

Option J says demand increases only with a decrease in price of complementary goods. Wait, complementary goods are ones where you need them together. Like bread and butter. If the price of butter goes up, you buy less of both. So for a complementary good, if its price increases, the demand for it decreases. But for a normal good, the demand increases as income increases. So J seems to be mixing up concepts. Complementary goods' demand doesn't directly affect whether a good is normal or not. So J is incorrect.

So to recap, the definitions:

A: Demand independent of income. No, that's not right. Demand depends on income for normal goods.

B: Demand curve shifts down with income up. Yes, correct.

C: Socially unacceptable. No.

D: Demand shifts up with income down. No, it's the opposite.

E: Direct change. Doesn't capture the correct relationship.

G: Demand decreases with income up. Correct.

H: Not income-related.

J: Complementary good relationship.

So the correct options are B and G.

The correct definitions of normal goods are those where demand decreases as income increases (G) and those whose demand curve shifts downward with an increase in income (B).
