Question:

Chlorine is found in nature in two isotopic forms, one of atomiemass 35amuand one of atomic mass 37amu. The average atomic mass of chlorine is 35.453amu. What is the percent with which each of these isotopes occurs in nature?

Options:

A: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 80% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 20%
B: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 60% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 40%
C: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 65% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 35%
D: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 25% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 75%
E: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 50% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 50%
F: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 85% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 15%
G: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 90% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 10%
H: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 55% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 45%
I: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 70% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 30%
J: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 77.35% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 22.65%

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see. Chlorine has two isotopes: one with an atomic mass of 35 amu and another with 37 amu. The average atomic mass is given as 35.453 amu. The question is asking what percentage each isotope occurs naturally. The options are A through J, each giving different percentages.

Wait, I remember that the average atomic mass is a weighted average based on the natural abundance of each isotope. So if I call the abundance of 35 amu as x and 37 amu as y, then x + y should equal 100% because those are the only two isotopes. So x + y = 1. But since they're both in decimal form, maybe I should think of it in terms of decimals.

The formula for the average mass would be (mass1 * abundance1) + (mass2 * abundance2) = average. So plugging in the numbers:

35 * x + 37 * y = 35.453

And since x + y = 1, we can substitute y as (1 - x). So substituting:

35x + 37(1 - x) = 35.453

Let me compute that. Expanding the equation:

35x + 37 -37x = 35.453

Combine like terms: (35x -37x) is -2x, so:

-2x +37 =35.453

Subtract 37 from both sides:

-2x = 35.453 -37

What's 35.453 -37? That's -1.547. So:

-2x = -1.547

Divide both sides by -2:

x = (-1.547)/(-2) = 0.7735

So x is 0.7735, which is 77.35%. That means the 35 amu isotope occurs about 77.35% naturally.

Then y is 1 - x, which is 1 - 0.7735 = 0.2265, or 22.65%.

Looking at the options, option J says 77.35% for 35 amu and 22.65% for 37 amu. That's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be J.

To determine the natural abundance of each isotope of chlorine, we use the formula for the average atomic mass, which is a weighted average of the isotopic masses based on their natural abundances. Let the abundance of the isotope with mass 35 amu be \( x \) and the abundance of the isotope with mass 37 amu be \( y \). The two equations are:

1. \( x + y = 1 \) (since the total abundance must sum to 100%)
2. \( 35x + 37y = 35.453 \) (the average atomic mass)

Substituting \( y = 1 - x \) into the second equation:

\[
35x + 37(1 - x) = 35.453
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
35x + 37 - 37x = 35.453
\]
\[
-2x + 37 = 35.453
\]
\[
-2x = -1.547
\]
\[
x = 0.7735
\]

Thus, \( x = 77.35\% \) (the abundance of the 35 amu isotope), and \( y = 1 - x = 0.2265 = 22.65\% \) (the abundance of the 37 amu isotope).

From the options provided, option J correctly states these percentages.
