Okay, so I have this question about presenting new information to coworkers. The question is asking which step should be taken first. Let me think through each option and see which makes the most sense.

First, the options are A to J. The question is about the first step in presenting information effectively. So I need to figure out the logical initial step.

Option A is sending a calendar invite. That seems like a good idea because if you send out the presentation day, others can come. But wait, is that the first step? I mean, perhaps before that, you should prepare the presentation, but maybe that's not the first thing to do.

Option B says creating three to five key messages. That sounds like it's part of the process, but is it the first step? I don't think so. Usually, you start by planning the content before sending anything out.

Option C is creating visual aids. Visuals are important because they help convey the message more clearly. But again, that might come after planning the message, not the first thing to do.

Option D is determining the objective. Hmm, that's about what you're trying to achieve, like the purpose of the presentation. But that's more about the purpose, not the initial step.

Option E is setting up the meeting room. That makes sense because if the room isn't ready, the presentation won't happen smoothly. But again, maybe the first thing is about planning.

Option F is deciding the date and time. Right, the timing is crucial. If the presentation is scheduled for a certain day and time, it's better to plan accordingly. So setting the date and time first would make sense as the first step.

Option G is writing a detailed script. Once you know when and where it's going to be, you can plan the script. So that's probably part of the first step, but maybe not the very first action.

Option H is analyzing the audience. That's about understanding who will be there, which affects how to present. But again, that's part of the planning process, not the first step.

Option I is choosing a communication tool. That's more about the medium you're using, which is important, but not the initial step.

Option J is practicing in front of a mirror. That's a good step, but again, it's about the presentation itself, not the initial planning.

Putting it all together, the first step should be about setting the timeline and room because without that, the presentation might not happen or could get out of hand. So the correct answer should be F: Decide the date and time for the presentation.

The first step in presenting new information effectively is to decide the date and time for the presentation. This ensures the meeting room is ready and the presentation has a clear schedule.
