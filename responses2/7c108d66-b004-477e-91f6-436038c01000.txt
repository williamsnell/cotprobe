B: 6.9
C: 7.429
D: 5.29
E: 12.167
F: 4.3

Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the volume of a cube. Hmm, I remember the formula is V equals s cubed, where s is the side length. The problem says the side length is 2.3 centimeters, and I need to find the volume in cubic centimeters. Let me think about how to calculate that.

Wait, 2.3 cubed is the same as 2.3 multiplied by itself three times. So, 2.3 times 2.3 is... let's see, 2 times 2 is 4, 2 times 0.3 is 0.6, 0.3 times 2 is another 0.6, and 0.3 times 0.3 is 0.09. Adding all those up: 4 + 0.6 + 0.6 +0.09 = 5.29. Wait, that's the square part. Oh, right, I forgot to multiply by the third 2.3. So, 5.29 times 2.3.

Let me do that multiplication. 5 times 2.3 is 11.5, and 0.29 times 2.3. Hmm, 0.2 times 2.3 is 0.46, and 0.09 times 2.3 is 0.207. Adding those together: 0.46 + 0.207 = 0.667. Then add that to the 11.5 from earlier. 11.5 + 0.667 is 12.167. So the volume is 12.167 cubic centimeters.

Looking at the options, option E is 12.167. So I think the correct answer is E.

The volume of a cube with side length \( s \) is \( V = s^3 \). For \( s = 2.3 \) cm, the calculation is:

\[
V = (2.3)^3 = 2.3 \times 2.3 \times 2.3 = 12.167 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

The correct answer is E: 12.167.

Answer: E
