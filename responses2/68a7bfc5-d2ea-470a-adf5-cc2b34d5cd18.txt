Question:

It has been estimated that each square meter of the earth's surface supports 1 × 10^7 g of air above it. If air is 20% oxygen (O_2, molecular weight = 32 g/mole) by weight, approximately how many moles of O_2 are there above each square meter of the earth?

Options:

A: 8 × 10^4 moles
B: 7 × 10^5 moles
C: 1 × 10^5 moles
D: 2.5 × 10^4 moles
E: 2 × 10^6 moles
F: 3 × 10^4 moles
G: 5 × 10^3 moles
H: 6 × 10^4 moles
I: 1.5 × 10^5 moles
J: 4 × 10^4 moles

Okay, so I've got this problem here about how much oxygen is present above each square meter of the Earth. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says each square meter supports 1e7 grams of air. Oh wait, that's 10^7 grams per m². And the air is 20% oxygen by weight. So I need to find out how many moles of O₂ are there.

Hmm, right. So first, I should find out how much oxygen is in that 1e7 grams. Since it's 20% O₂, that would be 0.2 times 1e7 grams. Let me calculate that: 0.2 * 1e7 = 2e6 grams of O₂.

Wait, but wait. Oxygen is O₂, and its molecular weight is 32 grams per mole. So to find moles, I need to divide the grams by the molecular weight. So moles O₂ = mass O₂ / molecular weight.

So plugging in the numbers: 2e6 grams divided by 32 g/mol. Let me do that division. 2e6 /32. Well, 32 is 2^5, so 2e6 is 2,000,000. 2,000,000 /32 = 62,500. So that's 6.25e4 moles of O₂.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through the steps again.

1. Each m² has 1e7 grams of air.
2. 20% is O₂: so 0.2 *1e7 = 2e6 grams.
3. Molar mass of O₂ is 32 g/mol. So moles = 2e6 /32 = 62500, which is 6.25e4 mol.

Looking at the options, option H is 6 ×10^4, which is 6e4, pretty close. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh, wait a second, did I calculate the oxygen correctly? 2e6 grams is correct for 20% of 1e7. Then 2e6 divided by 32 is 62500, yes. So the moles are 6.25e4, which is 62,500. So the correct option is H: 6 ×10^4 moles.

To determine the number of moles of O₂ above each square meter of the Earth, we start by noting that each square meter supports 1 × 10⁷ grams of air. Air is 20% oxygen by weight, so the mass of O₂ is:

\[
\text{Mass of O₂} = 0.2 \times 1 \times 10^7 \, \text{g} = 2 \times 10^6 \, \text{g}.
\]

Next, we use the molecular weight of O₂, which is 32 g/mol, to find the number of moles:

\[
\text{Moles of O₂} = \frac{\text{Mass of O₂}}{\text{Molecular Weight}} = \frac{2 \times 10^6 \, \text{g}}{32 \, \text{g/mol}} = 6.25 \times 10^4 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is option H: 6 × 10⁴ moles.
