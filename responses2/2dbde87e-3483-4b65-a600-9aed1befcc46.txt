Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a dragster in a race. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says the dragster reaches the quarter-mile marker, which is 402 meters, with a speed of 80 m/s. We need to find the acceleration and the time it took. The options are A to J, each with different accelerations and times.

Hmm, I remember that for such problems, especially when the acceleration is constant, we can use kinematic equations. Since the problem gives the distance and the final velocity, and asks for acceleration and time, I think using the equations of motion would be the way to go.

Wait, the equations to consider are probably the ones that relate velocity, acceleration, distance, and time. Let me think about which equation would give me acceleration and time.

Oh right, the equation for constant acceleration where we can relate initial and final velocities, distance, and acceleration is v² = u² + 2as. Here, u is initial velocity, v is final, a is acceleration, s is distance.

But wait, in this case, the initial velocity u is 0 because the dragster starts from rest. Oh wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, the question doesn't say the dragster starts from rest. Oh wait, the problem doesn't give us the initial speed. Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me read again: he reaches 402 m with a speed of 80 m/s. So I think the initial velocity is zero because the problem doesn't say otherwise. Oh wait, wait—no, wait. That's not necessarily correct. Because the question doesn't state the initial velocity. So wait, perhaps I made an assumption that's wrong. Let me double-check.

The problem says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Oh wait, no, the question is in English, so the problem states: "In a drag race, a dragster reaches the quarter-mile (402 m) marker with a speed of 80 m/s." So initial velocity is zero? Or maybe not. Wait, perhaps it's an initial velocity, but the problem doesn't give it. Hmmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the initial velocity is zero. Because in some problems, especially when starting from rest, the initial velocity is zero. But the problem doesn't state that. Oh wait, maybe it's a non-zero initial velocity. The problem doesn't say so. Hmm, that complicates things. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me assume that the initial velocity is zero, since the problem doesn't state otherwise.

Wait, but let's think again. Oh, no, the problem says he "reaches" the marker. So he starts from rest because he's at the start line. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Because sometimes in problems, the initial velocity is given. But here, the problem states he reaches with a speed of 80 m/s. Hmm, so perhaps the initial velocity is zero, but that seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't state the initial velocity. Oh wait, wait. The problem doesn't state the initial velocity. So I can't assume that. That complicates things.

Wait, no, wait. Let me read the problem again. The full question is: "In a drag race, a dragster reaches the quarter-mile (402 m) marker with a speed of 80 m/s. What is his acceleration and how long did the run take?"

Ah, wait, no, the initial velocity isn't given, but let me think: perhaps the acceleration is constant, so I can use the kinematic equations. But without knowing the initial velocity, it's hard to proceed. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps he starts from rest, so initial velocity u is zero. Because the problem doesn't say otherwise. So that's the assumption I'll make.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the initial velocity isn't zero. But without any information, it's impossible to be certain. So perhaps the problem assumes that the acceleration is calculated from the speed and the distance, but that doesn't make sense because those two alone aren't enough. Hmm.

Wait, let's proceed with the assumption that initial velocity is zero. So, let me write down the given data:

- Initial velocity, u = 0 m/s (assuming)
- Final velocity, v = 80 m/s
- Distance, s = 402 m

Using the equation v² = u² + 2 a s.

Plugging numbers:

(80)^2 = 0 + 2 a (402)

So 6400 = 804 a

So a = 6400 / 804. Let me compute that. Hmm, 6400 divided by 804. Let me do the division.

804 * 7 is 5628. 804 * 8 = 6432. Oh wait, 804*7=5628, 6400-5628=772. So 772/804 is approximately 0.958. So a ≈ 7.958 m/s².

Wait, 7.958 is approximately 7.96 m/s². So that's one of the options. Let's see the options:

Looking at the options, option B is 7.96 m/s² and 10.1 s.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

Compute 80^2: 6400.

2 a s = 2 * a * 402 = 804 a.

So 6400 = 804 a → a = 6400 / 804.

Let me divide 6400 by 804.

Compute 804 ×7 = 5628.

6400 -5628=772.

772 ÷804 ≈ 0.96. So 7.96 m/s².

So option B says 7.96 and 10.1 s. So that's one part done.

Now, to find the time. Which equation do I use?

The equation that relates time, acceleration, initial velocity, and final velocity is:

v = u + a t.

Since u is zero, this simplifies to v = a t.

So t = v / a.

v is 80 m/s, a is 7.96 m/s².

So t ≈ 80 /7.96 ≈ approximately 10.05 s.

Looking at the options, option B says 10.1 s. So that matches.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: 8.46 and 9.5 s. Hmm, 8.46 is higher than our calculated a, so no.

Option F: 9.96 m/s². That's higher than our a, so not possible.

Option I: 7.96 m/s² and 9.1 s. Time would be 80/7.96 ≈ 10.05. So this is option B.

So the correct answer should be B.

To solve the problem, we use the kinematic equations for constant acceleration. The dragster reaches a distance of 402 m with a final velocity of 80 m/s, and we assume the initial velocity is zero (u = 0). The acceleration and time are calculated as follows:

1. **Acceleration (a):** Using the equation \( v^2 = u^2 + 2as \), where \( v = 80 \, \text{m/s} \), \( u = 0 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( s = 402 \, \text{m} \):
   \[
   a = \frac{v^2}{2s} = \frac{80^2}{2 \times 402} = \frac{6400}{804} \approx 7.96 \, \text{m/s}^2
   \]

2. **Time (t):** Using the equation \( v = u + at \), where \( u = 0 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( v = 80 \, \text{m/s} \):
   \[
   t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{80}{7.96} \approx 10.05 \, \text{s}
   \]

From the options provided, the closest match is **Option B**, which states an acceleration of \( 7.96 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) and a time of \( 10.1 \, \text{s} \).
