Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: Let f(x) = 3x² - 2 and g(f(x)) = x² + x + 1. I need to find the sum of all possible values of g(25). The options are A to J, and I have to pick the correct one. 

Hmm, okay, so f(x) is a quadratic function, and g is another function that takes f(x) as its input. So g is a function of f(x), meaning that g is a composite function. 

I think I need to find all the possible x values such that f(x) equals 25. Once I have those x values, I can plug them into g(f(x)) which is given as x² + x + 1. Then, sum those g(25) values and see which option matches.

Wait, let me think again. So f(x) is 3x² - 2. We need to find all x such that f(x) = 25. That would mean solving 3x² - 2 = 25. Let me write that equation down.

3x² - 2 = 25  
Adding 2 to both sides: 3x² = 27  
Divide both sides by 3: x² = 9  
So x can be sqrt(9) or -sqrt(9), meaning x = 3 or x = -3. 

Okay, so there are two x values, 3 and -3, that result in f(x) being 25. Now, since g is a function that takes f(x) as its input, for each x, g(f(x)) would be x² + x + 1. 

Wait, no. Wait a second. Since f(x) is 3x² - 2, when x is 3, f(x) is 25. Similarly, when x is -3, f(x) is still 25 because (-3)² is 9, multiplied by 3 is 27, minus 2 is 25. So both x=3 and x=-3 give f(x)=25.

So when I compute g(25), it's the same as g(f(3)) and g(f(-3)). But g(f(x)) is given as x² + x +1. So, for x=3: g(25) would be 3² + 3 + 1 = 9 + 3 +1=13. For x=-3: g(25) would be (-3)^2 + (-3) +1 = 9 -3 +1=7. 

Wait, that can't be right. Because the problem says "the sum of all possible values of g(25)", so if g(25) can be 13 and 7, then the sum would be 13 +7=20. Looking at the options, option I is 20. So is the answer I?

Wait, but hold on. Did I do that correctly? Let me double-check. 

So f(x) = 3x² -2. We have f(x)=25 when x²=9, so x=3 or x=-3. Then, g(f(x)) is x² + x +1. So for x=3: 3² +3 +1=13. For x=-3: (-3)^2 is 9, plus (-3) is 6, plus 1 is 7. So yes, the two values of g(25) are 13 and 7, which sum to 20. So the answer is 20, which is option I.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says "the sum of all possible values of g(25)". So if there are two possible x's leading to f(x)=25, then each x leads to a g(25) value. So adding those two would give the sum. So, yes, 13 +7=20.

But wait, I just thought of something. g is a function that takes f(x) as input. So when x=3, f(3)=25, so g(f(3))=g(25)=3² +3 +1=13. Similarly, when x=-3, f(-3)=25, so g(25)=(-3)^2 + (-3) +1=9-3+1=7. So, yeah, that's correct.

So the sum is 13 +7=20. Looking back at the options, option I is 20. So the answer should be option I, which is 20.

The sum of all possible values of g(25) is 20.
