Okay, so I need to find the product of 5 and -9. Hmm, let's think about this. Product means I multiply them together. So 5 times -9.

Wait, what's the rule for multiplying positive and negative numbers? I remember that when you multiply a positive by a negative, the result is negative. So 5 is positive, -9 is negative. Multiply them, so 5 * (-9) should be negative.

Now, what's 5 times 9? That's straightforward. 5*9 is 45. But since one is negative, the result is -45. Let me check the options again. Option B is -45, which matches. So the answer should be B.

The product of 5 and -9 is calculated by multiplying their absolute values and applying the sign rule. Since one is positive and the other negative, the result is negative. 5 * 9 = 45, so 5 * (-9) = -45. Looking at the options, the correct answer is **B: -45**.

Answer: B

Answer:
     B

To find the product of 5 and −9, multiply the numbers and apply the sign rule: a positive times a negative yields a negative result.

- **5 × (-9) = -45**
- **Option B: −45**

Answer: B
