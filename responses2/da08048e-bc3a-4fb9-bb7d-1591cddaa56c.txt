Okay, so I have this question about the Boyle temperature of a van der Waals gas. Hmm, I remember that the Boyle temperature is the temperature at which the volume of the gas becomes constant, regardless of pressure. So, it's the temperature when the slope of the P-V curve is zero, right? 

The question is asking me to express this temperature using the van der Waals constants a, b, and R. And the final expression should only involve these, no other terms. The options are from A to H, each with different combinations of a, b, and R.

I think the van der Waals equation is (P + a(n²/V²))(V - nb) = nRT. But wait, when we talk about the Boyle temperature, we're considering the ideal gas law case, so n is the number of moles. For n=1, the equation simplifies. So, the van der Waals equation becomes (P + a/V²)(V - b) = RT.

To find the Boyle temperature, we need to find when the volume is constant. That happens when the slope of P vs. 1/V is zero. Alternatively, when the second derivative of P with respect to V is zero because the slope is the first derivative. Let me think, the slope of P versus 1/V is zero at the Boyle temperature.

Wait, another approach: at Boyle temperature T_B, the volume V is such that (P + a/V²) = 0, but that doesn't make sense because P is positive. Alternatively, perhaps I should take the derivative of P with respect to V and set it to zero to find T_B.

So, let's derive this. The van der Waals equation for n=1 is (P + a/V²)(V - b) = RT. Let's expand this equation:

P = RT/(V - b) - a/(V²)

Now, to find the condition for the Boyle temperature, I think we take the derivative of P with respect to V and set it to zero. Because at the Boyle temperature, the volume doesn't change, so dP/dV should be zero.

Taking dP/dV: Let's compute it.

dP/dV = derivative of [RT/(V - b)] is -RT/(V -b)^2. And the derivative of -a/(V²) is 2a/(V^3).

So, dP/dV = (-RT)/(V - b)^2 + 2a/(V^3) 

Set this equal to zero for the Boyle temperature:

(-RT)/(V - b)^2 + (2a)/(V^3) )= 0

Rearranging:

(2a)/(V^3) = RT/(V - b)^2

Multiply both sides by (V - b)^2 and divide by R:

(2a)/(V^3 R) ) = T/(V - b)^2

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to approach it. Alternatively, maybe it's better to express V in terms of T and then find T_B.

Wait, another thought: The condition for Boyle temperature is when the volume is such that the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume, but at a specific temperature. Alternatively, perhaps using the Maxwell-Boltzmann equation or considering the critical point.

Wait, I remember that the Boyle temperature is related to the critical temperature. Let me think about it. Oh wait, the Boyle temperature T_B is given by (a/(2b R)). Let me see if I can derive that.

From the van der Waals equation, at V = 3b (the critical volume), the pressure is equal to (nRT_c)/(2V) )? Or wait, maybe I should go back to the equation.

Wait, in the van der Waals equation, the minimum of the P vs. V curve occurs at a certain point. Let me think about how to find that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the Boyle temperature, which is T_B = (a/(2b R)).

Let me check the derivation again. The van der Waals equation is (P + a/V²)(V - b) = RT. Let me rearrange it for P:

P = [RT/(V - b)] - a/(V²)

To find the Boyle temperature, we need to find the temperature where dP/dV = 0. So, take the derivative of P with respect to V:

dP/dV = [ -RT/(V - b)^2 ] + [ 2a/(V^3) ]

Set this to zero:

- RT/(V - b)^2 + 2a/(V^3) = 0

Rearranging:

2a/(V^3) = RT/(V - b)^2

Multiply both sides by (V - b)^2 (V - b)^2 / V^3:

2a (V - b)^2 / V^3 = RT

But this seems a bit messy. Let me think if there's a better way.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the condition for the minimum in the P-V curve. The minimum occurs when the second derivative d²P/dV² is zero. Let me compute the second derivative.

dP/dV = [ -RT/(V - b)^2 ] + [ 2a/(V^3) ]

d²P/dV² = [ 2RT/(V - b)^3 ] - [ 6a/(V^4) ]

Set d²P/dV² = 0:

2RT/(V - b)^3 = 6a/(V^4)

Simplify:

RT/(3a) = (V - b)^3 / V^4

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this leads me to the Boyle temperature directly.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the van der Waals equation at V = 3b (the critical volume), which is where the curve reaches a minimum (or maximum) pressure. Wait, critical volume is Vc = 3nb. For n=1, Vc = 3b. At this point, the second derivative is zero, so that's the point of inflection.

But for the Boyle temperature, perhaps I should find the V where the derivative is zero. Let's go back to the first derivative equation.

We have:

2a/(V^3) = RT/(V - b)^2

Rearranging:

(2a)(V - b)^2 = RT V^3

Hmm, that's a cubic in V. Not sure, but perhaps I can make an approximation.

Wait, maybe it's easier to relate T_B to the critical temperature Tc. The Boyle temperature is lower than the critical temperature.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the standard formula for the Boyle temperature.

I think the correct formula for T_B is (a/(2b R)). So among the options, option G is T_B = a/(b R) * (1/2). So option G is a/(2b R). So looking at the options:

Options:

A: a/(2b R)

B: R/(a b)

C: 2a/(b R)

D: a R²/(b)

E: b R / a

F: b/(a R)

G: a/(b R)

H: a²/(b R)

I: a/(b)

So the correct answer is G, which is a/(2b R).

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Let me derive it correctly.

We have the equation:

dP/dV = (-RT)/(V - b)^2 + 2a/(V^3) = 0

Putting together:

(-RT)/(V - b)^2 + 2a/(V^3) = 0

=> 2a/(V^3) = RT/(V - b)^2

Multiply both sides by (V - b)^2 (V^3):

2a (V - b)^2 = RT V^3

Divide both sides by RT:

2a (V - b)^2 = V^3

Hmm, but this is a cubic equation in V, which may not be easy to solve. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that at the Boyle temperature, the volume is such that the gas is expanding or contracting in a way that the slope is zero.

Wait, perhaps another approach: At Boyle temperature, the pressure is P_B, and the volume is V_B. Also, the gas is ideal at that point, so P_B V_B = RT_B.

But wait, the van der Waals equation at V = V_B, P = P_B, and n=1, so:

P_B + a/V_B² = RT_B/(V_B - b)

P_B = RT_B/(V_B - b) - a/(V_B^2)

But since P_B V_B = RT_B (ideal gas law), so P_B = RT_B / V_B.

Substituting into the equation:

RT_B / V_B = RT_B/(V_B - b) - a/(V_B^2)

Divide both sides by RT_B:

1/V_B = 1/(V_B - b) - a/(R T_B V_B^2)

Let me write this as:

1/(V_B - b) - 1/V_B = a/(R T_B V_B^2 )

Simplify the left side:

[ V_B - (V_B - b) ] / [ V_B (V_B - b) ) ] = b / [ V_B (V_B - b) ) ]

So,

b / [ V_B (V_B - b) ) ] = a/( R T_B V_B^2 )

Simplify:

b (V_B) / [ V_B (V_B - b) ) ] = a/( R T_B V_B^2 )

Wait, no, let me compute the left side: 1/(V-B) -1/V is equal to [ V - (V - b) ] / [ V (V -b) ) ] = b/(V (V -b) )

So,

b/(V (V -b)) ) = a/(R T_B V^2 )

Multiply both sides by V (V -b):

b = a V (V -b) / ( R T_B )

So,

R T_B = a V (V -b ) / b

But V is the volume at the Boyle temperature. Wait, but I'm trying to find T_B in terms of a, b, R. So I need to find V in terms of a, b, R?

Alternatively, perhaps I can find another equation.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the equation we had earlier.

We have 2a/(V^3) = RT/(V -b)^2

At the Boyle temperature, V_B is such that the slope is zero, so this equation holds. Let me rearrange this equation.

Let me express it as:

2a (V -b)^2 = RT V^3

This is a cubic equation in V: 2a (V^3 - 2b V^2 + b^2 V) ) = RT V^3

Wait, expanding (V - b)^2 = V² - 2b V + b².

So,

2a (V² - 2b V + b²) = RT V^3

Divide both sides by V² (assuming V ≠0):

2a (1 - 2b/V + b²/V² ) = RT V

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that for the Boyle temperature, the volume is V = (a/(2b R)).

Wait, no, that's the formula I'm trying to derive. Alternatively, perhaps I should take a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can find the volume V at the Boyle temperature from the ideal gas law. Since at the Boyle temperature, the gas's volume is such that PV is constant, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can use the van der Waals equation at V = V_B and relate to T_B.

Wait, let me think about the critical volume. The critical volume Vc is 3b. Let me see if Vc relates to the Boyle temperature somehow.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the van der Waals equation and the condition for the minimum in the P-V curve.

The minimum occurs at dP/dV = 0, so the derivative is zero when:

- RT/(V -b)^2 + 2a/V^3 = 0

So,

2a/V^3 = RT/(V - b)^2

Multiply both sides by (V -b)^2 V^3:

2a (V -b)^2 = RT V^3

Hmm, this is a cubic equation. Let me let x = V, so:

RT x^3 = 2a (x - b)^2

Rearranged:

RT x^3 = 2a (x² - 2b x + b²)

RT x^3 -2a x² +4 a b x - 2 a b² =0

This is a cubic equation in x. It might have a solution at x= (something). Alternatively, perhaps I can find a solution for x when x = 2b/(RT_B), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find T_B by considering a particular condition. Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here, and perhaps I should look for another way.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula for the Boyle temperature. I recall that T_B is given by T_B = a/(2b R). So checking the options, option G is a/(b R)* (1/2), which is a/(2b R). So option G is correct.

So looking at the options, option G is T_B = a/(2b R). So the answer is G.
</think>

To determine the Boyle temperature \( T_B \) of a van der Waals gas, we start with the van der Waals equation:

\[
\left(P + \frac{a}{V^2}\right)(V - b) = RT
\]

For \( n = 1 \), this simplifies to:

\[
P = \frac{RT}{V - b} - \frac{a}{V^2}
\]

The Boyle temperature occurs at the temperature where the volume \( V \) becomes constant, i.e., where the slope of the \( P \) vs. \( 1/V \) curve is zero. To find \( T_B \), we take the first derivative of \( P \) with respect to \( V \) and set it to zero:

\[
\frac{dP}{dV} = -\frac{RT}{(V - b)^2} + \frac{2a}{V^3} = 0
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
\frac{2a}{V^3} = \frac{RT}{(V - b)^2}
\]

At the Boyle temperature, this equation must hold. By analyzing the derivation and recalling standard formulas, the correct expression for the Boyle temperature is:

\[
T_B = \frac{a}{2bR}
\]

This matches option \( G \). The other options are incorrect because they do not align with the standard derivation of the Boyle temperature for a van der Waals gas.
