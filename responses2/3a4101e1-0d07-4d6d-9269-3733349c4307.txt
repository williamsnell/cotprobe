Okay, so I've got this problem here about a department store's sales, returns, and allowances. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that the gross sales this month were $72,800. Returns and allowances were 12% of the net sales. And it also mentions that net sales plus returns and allowances equal gross sales. Hmm, I need to find the net sales.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the terms. Gross sales are the total sales before any deductions, right? Then, returns and allowances are the money returned by customers or expenses like discounts or returns. So net sales would be gross sales minus returns and allowances.

But the problem states that net sales + returns and allowances = gross sales. Wait, that doesn't make sense at first glance because if net sales is less than gross sales, adding returns and allowances should bring it back to gross. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the formula is something like: Net Sales + Returns and Allowances = Gross Sales. So if I let Net Sales be 'x', then returns and allowances would be 12% of x. So x + 0.12x = 72,800. That would make sense because adding returns brings it back to the original gross figure.

Wait, but let me write that equation down. So:

x + 0.12x = 72,800

That simplifies to 1.12x = 72,800. So to find x, I divide both sides by 1.12. Let me calculate that.

72,800 divided by 1.12. Hmm, 1.12 times 64,000 is 72,800 because 1.12*60,000=67,200, and 1.12*4,000=4,480. Adding those gives 71,680. Wait, wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, 72,800 / 1.12. Let me compute this. 1.12 * 64,000 = 72,800. Because 64,000 * 1 is 64,000, and 64,000 * 0.12 is 7,680. Adding 64,000 + 7,680 gives 71,680. Wait, that's not adding up. Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me try another approach.

Wait, 1.12 times 64,000 is 72,800. Because 64,000 * 1.12 = 64,000 + (0.12 *64,000) = 64,000 + 7,680 = 71,680. Oh wait, that's 71,680, but the gross is 72,800. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait another approach: Let's compute 72,800 divided by 1.12. 

Let me write it as 72800 / 1.12. Let's compute that. 

1.12 times 64,000 is 71,680. Hmm, but that's less than 72,800. So maybe I need a higher number. Let me compute 72,800 / 1.12.

1.12 goes into 72,800 how many times? Well, 1.12 * 64,000 = 71,680 (as above). The remaining is 72,800 -71,680 = 1,120. So 1,120 divided by 1.12 is 1,000. So total is 64,000 + 1,000 = 65,000. Oh wait, so 1.12 * 65,000 = 72,800. So x, the net sales, is 65,000.

So looking at the options, option C is $65,000.00. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me check if I approached this correctly. The problem states that net sales + returns and allowances = gross sales. And returns and allowances are 12% of net sales. So the equation is correct as x + 0.12x = 72,800. Which simplifies to 1.12x =72,800, so x=65,000. That makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let's denote:

Gross Sales = 72,800

Returns and Allowances = 0.12 * Net Sales

But Net Sales = Gross Sales - Returns and Allowances. So substituting:

Net Sales = 72,800 - (0.12 * Net Sales)

Which brings us to:

Net Sales + 0.12 Net Sales =72,800

So 1.12 Net Sales =72,800 → Net Sales =72,800 / 1.12 → 65,000.

So again, same result. So option C is correct.
</think>

The problem requires finding the net sales given the gross sales and the percentage of returns and allowances. The key equation is:

Net Sales + (12% of Net Sales) = Gross Sales.

Let Net Sales be \( x \). Then, \( x + 0.12x = 72,800 \). Simplifying, \( 1.12x = 72,800 \), so \( x = \frac{72,800}{1.12} = 65,000 \).

The correct answer is **C: $65,000.00**.
