Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"We found that not only was it a civil war, an effort by a people who had for years been seeking their liberation from any colonial influence whatsoever, but also we found that the Vietnamese whom we had enthusiastically molded after our own image were hard put to take up the fight against the threat we were supposedly saving them from.
"We found most people didn't even know the difference between communism and democracy. They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace, and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American."
John Kerry, 1971

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the approaches of Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon to the Vietnam conflict. I'm a bit fuzzy on a lot of details, so I'll need to think this through carefully.

The question gives a scenario where John Kerry described both leaders' approaches. From what I remember, the Vietnam War was all about nationalism and fighting against the U.S. influence. I think both leaders were against the war, but how exactly?

Lyndon Johnson was the President from 1963 to 1969. I remember that he was pretty tough and didn't get along with the U.S. government. He believed in the importance of a civil war and fighting for independence. So, he probably pushed back against the war, maybe even saying it's an American war. He probably tried to unite people against the U.S. influence, which led to things like the Enduring Freedom movement. Also, I think he was pretty direct and didn't allow for much withdrawal. He even tried to set up a government in Vietnam, which might have contributed to tensions.

Richard Nixon was from 1969 to 1974. He's often called the "Nixon era," which is usually associated with 政治改革. He's a more moderate president. He might have supported the war as a way to reform the government. But did he actually take it all in? I think he was more willing to accept U.S. intervention, like the use of military force. Nixon's approach was more about giving the U.S. some control over the conflict, perhaps through military action, which might have caused more escalations. In contrast, Johnson was more direct and didn't allow for much withdrawal from the war.

The question is about the differences between their approaches. Looking at the options:

Option A: Hostility vs. neutrality. Hostility is when the leader pushes back, tries to protect their position, maybe even escalate. Neutrality is when they don't interfere, just support. So perhaps the question is about whether they were hostile or neutral.

Option B: Competency vs. failure. Competency is when the leader is able to handle the situation, failure when they don't. But I'm not sure if that's the right comparison here.

Option C: Invasion vs. withdrawal. Invasion would mean taking over a place, withdrawal just stopping the conflict. I don't recall either leader doing that. Both probably didn't invade Vietnam; more about how to handle it.

Option D: Insurgence vs. retreat. Insurgency is a strong, resistant movement. Retreat would be more about leaving it alone. Both leaders were insurgent. But I'm not sure if that's the best fit.

Option E: Appeasement vs. provocation. Appeasement is giving in, trying to make the other side agree.provocation is causing the other side to act against their interests. So, Nixon's approach was provocation, he wanted the U.S. to take over. Johnson was more of an appeal to reason, not just giving in. So their approaches were different in that they used different methods—johnson was more direct, Nixon more forceful.

Option F: Escalation vs. de-escalation. Escalation is when tensions go up. De-escalation is bringing things back down. I think both went into escalation. But how did they react? Maybe their approaches were about how to escalate. But I'm not sure about the exact terms.

Option G: Intervention vs. isolation. intervention is when the leader interferes with the conflict, like the U.S. military. isolation is letting the conflict go on. I don't think either intervention or isolation was their approach.

Option H: Compliance vs. rebellion. Compliance is following orders, rebellion is resisting. I'm not sure if that's the best fit.

Option I: Aggression vs. pacifism. Aggression is a direct attack. pacifism is avoiding conflict. John Johnson's approach was more pacifist, while Nixon was more aggressive.

Option J: Defiance vs. submission. Defiance is strongly resisting. Submission is accepting. I'm not sure if either approach was that, but considering the options, I'm leaning towards E or I.

Wait, let's think again. Both leaders were against the war. But how did they handle it? John was more direct, maybe even pushing for independence. He didn't let the war escalate much. Nixon, on the other hand, was more willing to use force and U.S. intervention. So their approaches were more about direct confrontation versus using force.

Looking at option E:Appeasement vs. provocation. That makes sense. Nixon used provocation (U.S. intervention), while Johnson was more direct (appleeasement, not giving in). So their approaches were quite different in how they handled the conflict.

The question compares the approaches of Lyndon Johnson (1963–1969) and Richard Nixon (1969–1974) to the Vietnam conflict. Both were against the war but used different methods. Johnson was more direct and pacifist, advocating for a civil war and fighting for independence. Nixon, more moderate, used U.S. force, including military action, which led to escalation. Their approaches were characterized by provocation and direct confrontation versus force and pacifism.

The best answer is **E: Appeasement vs. provocation**, as it reflects the contrasting methods each leader used.

**Answer: E**
