Okay, so I've got this question about capacitors and electric potential difference. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says the plates of a capacitor are charged to a potential difference of 5 volts. The capacitance is 2 mF. I need to find the charge on the positive plate. The options are A through J, with various values in coulombs and milli coulombs.

Hmm, I remember that the formula for charge in a capacitor is Q = C * V. Oh wait, but wait: the potential difference (V) is the same across both plates when it's a capacitor because they're connected. So yeah, the charge should be Q equals capacitance multiplied by voltage.

Wait, but wait again. Capacitance is in farads, right? Oh wait, 2 mF is 2 milliFarads. Oh wait no, wait, because 1 mF is 1e-3 F. So 2 mF is 2e-3 F. Got it.

So plugging in the numbers: Q = C * V. C is 2e-3 F, V is 5 V. So 2e-3 *5 would be 1e-2, which is 0.01 C. Wait, so that's 0.01 coulombs. Looking at the options, I see option I is 0.01 C. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I mix up the sign or the units.

Wait, wait a second. Oh right, the positive plate gets positive charge, and the negative gets negative. So the question is about the charge on the positive plate. So Q is positive. So yes, 0.01 C is correct. So the answer would be option I.

Wait, but the options also have things like 0.02 mC, which is 0.00002 C, much less than 0.01 C. So option I is 0.01 C. So that's 10 mC? Wait, no, 0.01 C is 10 milliCoulombs. Because 1 C is 1000 mC. So 0.01 C is 10 mC. But looking at the options, option D is 0.005 C, which is 5 mC. So maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait no, wait another moment. Oh, wait! Oh wait! Wait a second, because sometimes it's easy to get confused with the formula. Let me think again. The formula is Q = C * V. Yes, that's correct. So 2e-3 F * 5 V = 1e-2 C, which is 0.01 C. So that's 10 mC. Looking at the options, option I is 0.01 C, which is 10 mC. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are given as:

Options:

A: 2 C

B: 0.02 C

C: 0.02 mC

D:0.005 C

E:0.1 C

F:0.005 mC

G:0.025 C

H:0.5 mC

I:0.01 C

J:0.5 C

So option I is 0.01 C. That's 10 mC. So that's correct, I think. So the correct answer should be I, 0.01 C.

To determine the charge on the positive plate of a capacitor, we use the formula:

\[
Q = C \cdot V
\]

where:
- \( Q \) is the charge in coulombs (\( \text{C} \)),
- \( C \) is the capacitance in farads (\( \text{F} \)),
- \( V \) is the potential difference in volts (\( \text{V} \)).

The problem states that the capacitance is \( 2 \, \text{mF} \) (which is \( 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{F} \)) and the potential difference is \( 5 \, \text{V} \). Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
Q = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{F} \cdot 5 \, \text{V} = 1 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{C} = 0.01 \, \text{C}
\]

This corresponds to \( 10 \, \text{mC} \). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**I: \( 0.01 \, \text{C} \)**.
