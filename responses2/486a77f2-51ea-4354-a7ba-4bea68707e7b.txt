Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about pricing policies. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is asking which pricing policy results in a price set for external customers that's higher than the competitive price in a given industry. The options are A through I, with each option representing a different pricing strategy.

Hmm, I need to remember what each pricing policy entails. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Competitive pricing. That sounds like setting the price at or below the competitors' prices to attract customers. So, it's not higher than competitive. So probably not A.

Option B: Penetration pricing. This is a strategy where a company tries to enter new markets or reduce competition by setting a low price to gain market share. The idea is to establish a competitive advantage and then gradually raise prices. But wait, does it usually set a price higher than competitors? I think it's the opposite. Penetration pricing is about gaining market share, not necessarily getting a higher price than competitors. So maybe B is not the right answer.

Option C: Cost-plus pricing. This is when a company charges more than its cost to ensure a profit. The price is higher than what the cost is, which means it's above the competitive price if the competitor is charging more than their cost. So this would result in a higher price than competition. So C could be the answer.

Option D: Dual pricing. I'm not too sure about this one. I think it's when a company offers two different pricing models for the same product. For example, a basic version and a premium version. I'm not sure if this results in a higher price for external customers than competitors. It might depend on the specifics, but I don't recall dual pricing necessarily setting prices higher than competitors. So I'll tentatively say D isn't the right choice.

Option E: Value-based pricing. This involves defining the value each customer brings and charging accordingly. It's more about the customer experience than just a fixed price. So the price might be competitive, but maybe not necessarily higher than what competitors are charging. So I think E isn't the correct answer.

Option F: Transfer pricing. This is about setting the transfer prices within a company, usually to maximize profit. So it's internal pricing and probably doesn't affect external prices. So F is out.

Option G: Predatory pricing. This is when a company sets a price below its cost to drive competitors out of the market. That means the external price would be lower than the competitor's, not higher. So G doesn't fit the question.

Option H: Collusive pricing. This is when multiple companies agree to set prices in a way that they all get the same price, which usually leads to lower prices than what's socially optimal. So the external price would be lower, not higher. So H is not the answer.

Option I: Bundle pricing. This is when a company offers a package of products for a lower total price than the sum of individual prices. The price of the bundle might be competitive, but it's unclear if it's higher than competitors. It depends on the bundle's total price, but I don't think this is necessarily a case where the price is higher than what competitors are charging. So I think I is not the correct choice.

So, after going through each option, the only one that makes sense is C: Cost-plus pricing. Because cost-plus pricing sets a price above the cost, which in turn is typically higher than what others are charging in the industry. So the external prices would be higher than competitors.

The correct answer is **C: Cost-plus pricing**. This pricing strategy sets a price higher than the cost of production, ensuring a profit margin. As a result, external prices will naturally be higher than competitors in the industry. 

Answer: C
