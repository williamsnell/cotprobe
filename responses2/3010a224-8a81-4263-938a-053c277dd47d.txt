Question:

Alright, so I have this problem here about Adam Manufacturing Co. and their overhead calculations. Let's try to figure it out step by step.

First, the problem states that they use a ratio of total overhead to total prime cost. I remember that prime cost includes direct materials and direct labor. Oh wait, right, prime cost is direct labor plus direct materials. So in this case, the total prime cost would be the sum of $185,600 (direct labor) and $54,900 (materials). Let me calculate that: 185,600 +54,900 equals 240,500. So total prime cost is $240,500.

The total overhead is given as $44,733. So the ratio of overhead to prime cost would be 44,733 divided by 240,500. Let me do that division. Hmm, 44,733 ÷ 240,500. Let me think, 240,500 is about 240 thousand, and 44,733 is about 45 thousand. So 45k divided by 240k is roughly 0.1875. That's 18.75%, but looking at the options, I don't see 18.75%. The closest is option G, which is 18.6%. Maybe the exact calculation would give a different number. Let me compute it more accurately.

44,733 / 240,500. Let's see:

240,500 × 0.18 would be 43,290, and 240,500 × 0.1875 is 45,093.75. So 44,733 is between 0.18 and 0.1875. Let's compute 44,733 ÷ 240,500.

Dividing both by, say, 100: 447.33 / 2405.

Hmm, 2405 × 0.186 is 2405 * 0.18 = 432.9, plus 2405 * 0.006 = 14.43. So 432.9 +14.43=447.33. Oh! So exactly 0.186. So 18.6%. So part (a) is 18.6%, which matches option G.

Wait, but let me double-check that. 240,500 × 0.186 = ?

240500 * 0.1 = 24050
240500 * 0.08 = 19240
240500 * 0.006 = 1443
Adding these together: 24050 +19240 =43290, plus 1443 is 44733. Yes, exactly the numerator. So 0.186, so 18.6% overhead percent of prime cost. So part (a) is correct and the answer is G.

Now part (b): overhead charge to a department with a prime cost of $32,600. So I think this means we need to determine the overhead allocation for that specific department. Since they use the overhead ratio, which is based on total overhead to total prime cost, the department's overhead would be (overhead rate) multiplied by the department's prime cost.

So first, let me compute the overhead rate. As calculated before, the overhead rate is the ratio of total overhead to total prime cost. So that's 44,733 / 240,500 = 0.186 or 18.6%. Alternatively, using the exact decimal, but since the computation gave us 0.186, perhaps we can use that.

So the overhead charge for a department with prime cost of $32,600 would be 32,600 * 0.186. Let me calculate that.

32,600 × 0.186.

Let me break it down: 32,600 × 0.1 = 3,260
32,600 × 0.08 = 2,608
32,600 × 0.006 = 195.6

Adding these together: 3,260 + 2,608 = 5,868; plus 195.6 is 6,063.6. So the overhead charge is $6,063.60.

Looking at the options, option G is 18.6%, $6,063.60. So that's the answer for part (b). So the overall answers are (a) 18.6%, (b) $6,063.60, which is option G.

The problem involves calculating overhead percentages and allocations for Adam Manufacturing Co. 

(a) To find the overhead percent of prime cost, we first calculate the total prime cost by adding direct materials and direct labor:

\[
\text{Total Prime Cost} = \$185,600 + \$54,900 = \$240,500
\]

Next, we determine the overhead percent by dividing total overhead by total prime cost and converting to a percentage:

\[
\text{Overhead Percent} = \left( \frac{\$44,733}{\$240,500} \right) \times 100 \approx 18.6\%
\]

(b) To calculate the overhead charge for a department with a prime cost of \$32,600, we use the overhead rate calculated in part (a):

\[
\text{Overhead Charge} = \$32,600 \times 18.6\% = \$6,063.60
\]

### Correct Option:
(a) 18.6%, (b) \$6,063.60 corresponds to **Option G**.
