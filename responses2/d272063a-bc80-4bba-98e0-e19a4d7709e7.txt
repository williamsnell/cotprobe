Question:

A company contracted with a builder to construct a new corporate headquarters for a fixed price of $100 million. At the time of the contract, structural steel was widely available and was included in the contract as a $6 million item. Before work began on the project, tornado damage shut down the production facility of the biggest structural steel supplier in the country, and the price of structural steel increased by 20% as a result. The builder informed the company of the steel price increase, and the parties then orally agreed to increase the project price to $101 million. The builder proceeded with construction and delivered the project on time. The company paid the builder $100 million but refused to pay the additional $1 million. If the builder sues the company for $1 million, is the builder likely to prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the price change of structural steel was not significant enough to warrant a contract modification.
B: No, because there was no consideration for the modification of the contract.
C: No, because the modification was never reduced to a writing signed by the party to be charged.
D: No, because the company did not sign a new contract reflecting the price change.
E: Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel.
F: Yes, because the builder completed the project on time despite the unforeseen circumstances.
G: Yes, because the builder had no control over the price increase of structural steel.
H: Yes, because the company√ïs promise was supported by consideration.
I: Yes, because the company was aware of the price increase and verbally agreed to it.
J: No, because the builder should have anticipated potential price fluctuations in materials.

Okay, so I have this question about contract modifications and whether a builder can sue a company for not paying an extra amount. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

So the company contracted to build a new corporate headquarters for a fixed price of $100 million. The structural steel was included in the contract as a $6 million item. Before starting the work, a big structural steel supplier was down by a tornado, causing the price of structural steel to rise by 20%. The builder informed the company and they agreed to increase the project price to $101 million. The builder built the project on time, but the company paid only $100 million instead of $101 million. They asked if the builder would prevail in a lawsuit for $1 million. The question is whether the builder is likely to get the money.

Hmm. Let me think about contract modifications. From what I remember, a contract modification is usually based on either a change in price or a condition that was breached which affects the price. But there are some rules about whether the modification is valid.

The key point here is the consideration. Consideration is an important factor. In a contract, both parties must have mutual consideration. That means they must agree to something that benefits both of them.

In this case, the company is paying a fixed price. The builder agreed to increase the price to $101 million. But wait, the reason the builder agreed was the price of structural steel went up by 20%. The contract already included structural steel as part of the total cost. So the builder is agreeing to pay more because the price of the materials increased.

But wait, the contract already included structural steel as a fixed item. If the price of that increased, that would be a change in cost. Is that considered a change in price? Or is it just an increase in a part of the cost?

Wait, structural steel was included in the fixed price. So the total cost is $100 million plus the structural steel at $6 million. If the price of structural steel went up by 20%, the additional cost would be $1.2 million. So the total project would be $101.2 million. But the company only paid $100 million because they were including the structural steel in the fixed price. So the builder is agreeing to pay more for that part.

But the question says the builder agreed to increase the project price to $101 million. Wait, did the contract include the structural steel as a separate item or was it part of the fixed price? Oh, the question says the structural steel was included in the contract as a $6 million item. So the fixed price is part of the contract, and the structural steel is a separate item. So the builder is aware that the price of the structural steel increased, but the contract didn't specify if it's included or not.

Wait, no, the contract included the structural steel as part of the fixed price. So the total cost is $100 million plus whatever structural steel cost. If the price of structural steel went up by 20%, then the additional cost is 20% of $6 million, which is $1.2 million. So the total project would be $101.2 million.

But the builder agreed to pay $101 million. Wait, that's probably because of the price increase. Or did the builder's agreement to increase the price by $1 million be based on the structural steel's price increase?

Alternatively, perhaps the builder was informed that the structural steel was going to cost more, so they agreed to a higher project price. But whether that's a valid modification depends on whether it's a change in price or something that creates an equitable modification.

Wait, the contract already included the structural steel as a separate item. If the contractor (builder) agreed to increase the price of the project, that might be viewed as an increase in the price of the whole project. But the question says the builder agreed to increase the project price to $101 million. So perhaps the modification is for the price of the project to increase by $1 million, not just the structural steel.

But the issue is whether this modification is reasonable. Let's think about the consideration. In the contract, the company paid $100 million because they were paying a fixed price that included the structural steel. Now, the builder is saying that because the price of the structural steel went up, the project's total cost would increase by $1.2 million. So the builder is agreeing to pay $101 million for the structural steel part, but that's not part of the original contract's price.

Wait, no, the contract includes the structural steel as part of the fixed price. So the $6 million is part of the $100 million. So the total project is $100 million plus the price of structural steel, which is now higher. So if the structural steel goes up by 20%, the total project cost goes up by 20% of $6, which is $1.2 million. So the total project would be $101.2 million.

But the builder only agreed to pay the builder $101 million, which is $1 million more than the original $100 million. So the modification is an increase of $1 million. But is that a fair modification?

But wait, the original contract didn't specify that the structural steel was going to cost more. It just included it as part of the fixed price. So the modification is based on the expectation that the price of structural steel will increase. The question is whether the modification is reasonable. The contract modification rule is that the modification must be a change in price or a condition that affects the price.

But in this case, the modification is based on a change in the price of the structural steel, which was included in the original contract. So the question is whether the modification is for a change in price or a condition that affects the price.

Wait, because the structural steel's price increased, that's a change in the price of the item, which is part of the project's cost. So the modification is a change in price. So the consideration would be that the company agreed to pay more for the structural steel, which is a part of the total cost. So mutual consideration exists between the company and the builder.

But the company's consideration: the company didn't specify any condition that affects the price. They just paid a fixed price. So the modification is for a change in price, which would require consideration.

So the consideration is that the company agreed to pay more because the price of structural steel increased. So yes, there's mutual consideration. Therefore, the modification is valid.

Wait, but the problem is about the modification being made. In contract law, a modification is only valid if it is a change in price or a condition that affects the price. So if the price of the structural steel increases, that's a change in price, so it's a valid modification.

But the question is whether the modification was made. The builder's modification was $1 million. However, the company agreed to a $1.2 million increase (20% of $6 million). But the builder only paid $1 million extra. So the modification was $1 million, not $1.2 million. But is this a valid modification?

Wait, but the price of structural steel increased by 20%. The contract already included that item. So the original price of the project was $100 million plus $6 million (but the $6 million is part of the fixed price). So the total project is $100 million plus whatever the structural steel costs now.

But the contract doesn't specify that the price of structural steel will increase, so the modification is based on the expectation that it will. So the modification is for a change in price, which is acceptable.

But the issue is whether the modification was based on consideration. The consideration in a contract modification is that both parties agree to modify the terms in a way that benefits both. In this case, the company agreed to pay more because they were aware that the structural steel's price would increase. So yes, there's mutual consideration.

So the modification is valid. Therefore, the builder can sue. So the answer should be about whether the modification was valid.

Looking at the options, option E says "Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel."

Wait, but the modification was based on a 20% increase, which is an expected price increase. So it's an anticipated increase, but not certain. The question says "unanticipated" though. So does that affect the consideration? Because if it's an unanticipated change, perhaps it's not a change that's within the scope of consideration.

Alternatively, the key is whether the modification was based on a change in price. The price of structural steel did increase, and the contract already included that item. So the modification is a change in price, which is okay under contract law.

So if the modification is a change in price, the question is whether it's a change in price that's significant enough. The question says that the price of structural steel was widely available and included in the contract. It's a 20% increase, which is significant.

But the issue is about whether the modification is fair. So the modification was for $1 million. The expected increase was 20%, which is $1.2 million.

But the modification only went up by $1 million, which is less than the expected increase. So is that a fair modification? Or is that acceptable because it's an increase in price?

Wait, the consideration is that the modification is for an increase in price. The modification is for $1 million, which is less than the expected increase. But in contract law, the modification is based on the expectation of price increase. So the modification is justified.

Wait, but the issue in the question is whether the modification was a change in price that was not significant enough. The answer in the question says "No, because the price change ... was not significant enough..." So if the modification is for only $1 million, which is a 1% increase, perhaps it's not significant enough. But I thought that a change in price of 20% is significant.

Wait, that's a key point. The contract already included the structural steel item. The price went up by 20%, which is a significant change. So the modification is a change in price, which is a valid modification. So the answer would be that the modification is valid, so the builder can sue.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E says "Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel." That would imply that the modification is fair, but perhaps the increase was too small to be justified.

But wait, in contract law, the modification is based on the expectation that the price will increase. So the modification is for a change in price. So the question is whether the modification is a change in price (which it is) and whether the change is significant enough.

If the price went up by 20%, and the modification was a $1.2 million increase, then it's a 20% increase. So the modification is a significant change, making it a valid contract modification. Hence, the builder can sue.

But the fact that the modification was only $1 million seems small compared to the $6 million item. But in contract law, the primary factor is whether the modification is a change in price, not the amount. So the amount is a secondary consideration.

So, in this case, the modification was a change in price, which is a valid modification. Therefore, the answer would be that the modification was valid, so the builder can sue.

Looking at the options, option E says yes because it's fair and equitable, considering the price change. Option A says no because the change wasn't significant. So which is correct?

Another angle: the consideration. The company didn't require any consideration for the modification. They just agreed to pay more because they knew the price would go up. So mutual consideration exists. Therefore, the modification is valid.

So the answer should be that the modification is valid, so the builder can sue. So looking at the options, which choice is correct.

Option E: Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel.

Alternatively, option B: No, because there was no consideration.

Wait, no. Because there was consideration. The contract already included structural steel as part of the fixed price, so the modification is a change in price, which is a valid contract modification with consideration.

So the correct answer is that the modification is valid, so the builder can sue, so the answer is E or A?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The contract modification is based on a change in price. The change is 20%, which is a significant increase. So the modification is a valid contract modification. So the answer is yes.

Looking at the options, option E says "Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel." That seems correct.

Alternatively, option A says "No, because the price change wasn't significant enough to warrant a contract modification." But I thought the price change was significant enough, so the modification is valid.

Wait, but the price increase was 20%, which is a significant change. So the modification is valid. Therefore, the builder can sue. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option E says yes because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the price increase. Option A says no because the price change wasn't significant enough.

But the problem is about whether the modification was fair. The price increase was 20%, which is a significant change. So the modification is valid. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but wait another thing: The modification was for a change in price, but the consideration is that the company agreed to pay more because the price of structural steel would increase. So mutual consideration exists, so the modification is valid.

So I think the answer is E. The modification was fair and equitable because it was a change in price, not an increase in the price of a part of the project that was part of the fixed cost.

Wait, but the original contract already included the structural steel. So the modification is for an increase in the cost of the project because the price of that item went up. So that's a change in price, which is acceptable. So the modification is valid.

So the correct answer is E: Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel.

To determine whether the builder can prevail in the lawsuit, we must analyze whether the modification to the contract was valid under contract law. The key issue revolves around whether the modification constitutes a valid contract modification, which requires consideration.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Contract Modification Basics**: A contract modification requires mutual consideration. The modification here is for an increase in the price of structural steel, which was included in the original contract as a $6 million item. The price of structural steel increased by 20%, leading to an expected increase in the project's total cost by $1.2 million.

2. **Nature of the Modification**: The modification was agreed upon by the company and the builder, reflecting the expectation that the price of structural steel would rise. This is a change in price, which is a valid basis for a contract modification.

3. **Significance of the Price Increase**: The 20% increase in structural steel's price is a significant change, which justifies the modification. The consideration exists because the company agreed to pay more for the structural steel, and the modification benefits both parties.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option E**: Correct. The modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel. The 20% increase is a significant change, making the modification valid.
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. While the price change itself is significant, the contract modification is valid because it reflects the expectation of a price increase.
   - **Other Options**: Incorrect for reasons related to consideration, fairness, or lack of consideration.

### Conclusion:
The modification was valid under contract law because it was a change in price and mutual consideration existed between the parties. The builder's interest is in the fixed price, and the modification is justified.
