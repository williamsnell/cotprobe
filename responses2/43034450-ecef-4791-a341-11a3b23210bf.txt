Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about performance, expectation, and value. The question is asking which theorist and school of thought this represents, using the phrase "Expectancy × Value" as a symbolic representation. The options are A through J, each pairing a theorist with a school of thought.

First, I need to recall what I know about various theories. The phrase "Expectancy × Value" rings a bell from psychology, probably related to decision-making or performance. I think it's part of the Expectancy Theory. Let me think about the theories one by one.

Option C is Edward Tolman and Expectancy-Value Theory. I remember that Tolman proposed this theory which suggests that people have both a value and an expectation. The value is how well they feel their job is done, and the expectation is what they think they'll do. So, that fits "Expectancy × Value." 

What about other options? Option A is Jean Piaget and Cognitive Development Theory. Piaget focused on how people develop cognitive abilities, not directly on the factors influencing performance. So probably not A.

Option B is Abraham Maslow and the Hierarchy of Needs. That's more about social and psychological needs, not directly about performance factors. So B is probably not the right choice.

Option D is Ivan Pavlov and Classical Conditioning. That's about conditioning through rewards, which is more about how behaviors are strengthened, not the symbolic phrase here.

Option E is John Watson and Behaviorism. Behaviorism is about learning through observable conditioning, which doesn't directly relate to the "Expectancy × Value" phrase.

Option F is Clark Hull and Reinforcement Theory. Reinforcement theory is about how rewards and punishments affect behavior, but again, not directly the symbolic equation.

Option G is Albert Bandura and Social Learning Theory. Social learning theory is about how people learn through observing others and their environment, not the specific equation mentioned.

Options I, J, A, etc., are all about different theories. So the right answer must be C.

The correct answer is **C: Edward Tolman and Expectancy-Value Theory**. This theory posits that individuals have both a value (how well their job is done) and an expectation (what they think they'll do), described by the equation "Expectancy × Value." 

Answer: C
