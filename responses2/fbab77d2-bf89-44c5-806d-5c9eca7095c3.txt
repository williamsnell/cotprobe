Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the work done by a variable force moving an object from x=1 ft to x=10 ft. Hmm, variable force... right, that means the force isn't constant; it changes with position. I remember that work is the integral of force over distance. Oh wait, yeah, work done is the integral from a to b of F(x) dx.

So the force given is F(x) = 5x^(-2) pounds. And I need to integrate this from 1 to 10. Let me write that down: Work = ∫ from 1 to 10 of 5x^(-2) dx. 

Wait, let's make sure I'm setting this up right. The formula is correct, right? Work is force times distance, but when force varies with position, it's the integral of F dx. So yeah.

So the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), as long as n isn't -1. Here, n is -2 in this case. So integrating 5x^(-2) would give 5*(x^(-1))/(-1) + C, which simplifies to -5/x + C. 

So the definite integral from 1 to 10 would be [ -5/x ] evaluated at 10 minus the same evaluated at 1. Let's compute that.

At x=10: -5/10 = -0.5.
At x=1: -5/1 = -5.
So the definite integral is (-0.5) - (-5) = -0.5 +5 = 4.5.

Wait, but wait a second. Work done should be positive if the force is in the direction of motion. But the integral gave me 4.5 ft-lb. Hmm. Did I miss a negative sign somewhere?

Wait, let me re-examine the integral. F(x) is 5x^(-2). So the integral is ∫5x^(-2) dx = 5 * ∫x^(-2) dx. The integral of x^(-2) is x^(-1)/(-1) + C, which is -1/x. So the antiderivative is 5*(-1/x) + C.

So when I compute from 1 to 10: At 10, 5*(-1/10) = -0.5. At 1, 5*(-1/1) = -5. So the definite integral is (-0.5) - (-5) = 4.5. But wait, 4.5 is positive, which makes sense if the force is doing work. But wait, wait, I think I might have missed a negative sign in the integral.

Wait, let me go through the steps again. The integral is ∫ F dx = ∫5x^(-2) dx. So F is 5/x². The integral of (5/x²) dx is 5*(x^(-1)/(-1)) + C, which is -5/x + C.

So evaluating from 1 to 10: (-5/10) - (-5/1) = (-0.5) - (-5) = 4.5. So work done is 4.5 ft-lb. Looking at the options, option I is 4.5 ft-lb. But wait, I thought the answer might be positive, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait no, the force is 5/x². Since x is positive and increasing, F is positive. So the integral gives positive work. So 4.5 ft-lb is the correct answer.

But wait, looking at the options, option I is 4.5, so that's one of the choices. But let me check the options again. The options are A to J, with I being 4.5.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I correctly apply the limits of integration? Because when you have ∫ from a to b, it's F(b) - F(a), but wait, no, in this case, I'm integrating the force, not the potential. The integral of F dx is the work. So the work is the integral evaluated from 1 to 10.

Wait, let me compute the integral again:

∫ 5x^{-2} dx = 5 * [ x^{-1}/(-1) ] + C = -5x^{-1} + C. 

So when x=10, -5/(10) = -0.5. When x=1, -5/(1) = -5.

So the definite integral is (-0.5) - (-5) = 4.5.

So the work done is 4.5 ft-lb. So the answer should be I, 4.5 ft-lb. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because when I look at the options, option I is 4.5, which is what I calculated. But wait, the options also have other numbers. Wait, perhaps I should redo the integral.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the direction. If the force is in the direction of displacement, the work is positive. So the integral as computed is indeed positive, 4.5, so the answer is I.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 4.5. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the work as the area under the force curve from x=1 to x=10.

But let me think again. The force is F(x) =5/x². From x=1 to x=10, the integral of F(x) dx is 4.5. So the work is 4.5 ft-lb. So the correct option is I. But wait, why is option H at 7.3? Did I make a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral. Let me compute it again.

F(x) =5x^(-2)
Integral is 5 * ∫x^{-2} dx = 5*(x^{-1}/(-1)) + C = -5/x + C.

So, at x=10: -5/10 = -0.5.
At x=1: -5/(1) = -5.

The integral from 1 to 10 is (-0.5) - (-5) = 4.5.

Wait, but wait, that's positive. So 4.5 ft-lb is correct, which would be option I.

But wait, let me think about the units. The force is in pounds, distance in feet, so work is in foot-pounds. So the units are correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 4.5. So the correct answer should be I. So why would option H be 7.3? Probably a miscalculation elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the antiderivative. Let me try integrating again. Maybe I messed up the power.

Wait, the integral of x^(-2) is x^(-1)/(-1) + C, which is correct. So yeah, F(x) is 5/x², integral is -5/x + C.

Hmm, so I think I must have it right. Then why is option I correct. But wait, the options have option H as 7.3, which is higher than 4.5. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me think.

Wait, the force is moving the object from x=1 to x=10. If the force were in the opposite direction, the work would be negative, but in this case, the force is 5/x², which is positive, and moving in the direction of x increases, so the force is in the same direction. So work should be positive. So 4.5 is correct. 

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute the integral again, maybe I have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute it numerically:

At x=10, F(x) =5*(10)^(-2) =5/100=0.05 lb.

At x=1, F(x)=5*(1)^(-2)=5 lb.

Wait, that can't be right. No, wait, x=1, F is 5*(1)^-2 = 5 pounds. At x=10, F is 5*(100)^-1 = 0.05 lb. So the force decreases as x increases.

So when moving from x=1 to x=10, the force is stronger at x=1, and weaker at x=10. So the object is being pushed forward, but the force is getting weaker. So the work done is the area under the curve. Hmm, but the integral gives a positive value, which is 4.5. So 4.5 ft-lb is correct.

Wait, but what's the answer options again? The closest option to 4.5 is I, which is 4.5. So the correct answer is I.

Wait, but why would option H be 7.3? Did I perhaps make a mistake in the limits? Maybe I thought the integral is from 1 to 10, but perhaps I swapped them. No, because the integral from a to b is F(b) - F(a), but in the integral ∫a^b F(x) dx, it's F(b) - F(a) when you compute the definite integral.

Wait, but when a=1 and b=10, the definite integral is F(10) - F(1) times the integral variable. But wait, no. The definite integral is [F(10) - F(1)] multiplied by the integral of dx, which is (10-1)=9. Wait, no, that's not how definite integrals work. The definite integral ∫ from a to b of f(x) dx is F(b)-F(a), where F is the antiderivative. So in this case, F(10) is (-5/10) = -0.5, F(1) is (-5/1). So the integral is (-0.5) - (-5) =4.5.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the integral as ∫1^10 5x^(-2) dx. Let me compute it step by step.

∫5x^(-2) dx from 1 to10.

The antiderivative is -5/x.

So F(10) = -5/10 = -0.5.

F(1) = -5/1 = -5.

So the integral is [ -0.5 ] - [ -5 ] = 4.5.

So the work done is 4.5 ft-lb, which is option I.

But wait, looking back at the options, I see option I is 4.5. So the correct answer should be I.

The work done by a variable force \( F(x) = 5x^{-2} \) pounds when moving an object from \( x = 1 \, \text{ft} \) to \( x = 10 \, \text{ft} \) is calculated using the definite integral of \( F(x) \) over this interval. The integral is:

\[
W = \int_{1}^{10} 5x^{-2} \, dx
\]

The antiderivative of \( 5x^{-2} \) is:

\[
\int 5x^{-2} \, dx = 5 \cdot \frac{x^{-1}}{-1} + C = -\frac{5}{x} + C
\]

Evaluating this from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 10 \):

\[
W = \left[ -\frac{5}{10} \right] - \left[ -\frac{5}{1} \right] = -0.5 - (-5) = 4.5 \, \text{ft-lb}
\]

Thus, the work done is \( 4.5 \, \text{ft-lb} \), which corresponds to option **I**.
