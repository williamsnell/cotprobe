Okay, so I have this physics problem about a laser's power output and the number of photons it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says: A 1.00 mW nitrogen laser emits light at 337 nm. We need to find the number of photons emitted per second. The options are A to D, each with a different number in scientific notation.

Wait, power is in watts. Oh right, 1 watt is 1 joule per second. So the laser's power is 1.00 mW, which is 0.001 Joules per second.

The energy of each photon would be given by the equation E = hc/λ. I remember h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. c is the speed of light, around 3 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength λ is given as 337 nm, which is 337 x 10^-9 meters. Oh right, because 1 nm is 1e-9 meters.

So first, let's calculate the energy per photon. 

E = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (337e-9 m). 

Let me compute that. Multiply 6.626e-34 by 3e8. That gives about 1.9878e-25 J·s * m/s. Wait, the units are J·m since s is in denominator. Wait, no, let me recheck. Oh no, the units: (6.626e-34 * 3e8) would be J·m because J is kg·m²/s², but perhaps I'm complicating. Let me compute the numbers.

6.626e-34 *3e8 = approx 1.9878e-25. Then divide by 337e-9. So 1.9878e-25 / 337e-9 = 1.9878e-25 / 3.37e-7 ≈ approximately 5.89e-19 J per photon.

Wait, let me double-check the division. 1.9878e-25 divided by 3.37e-7 is equal to (1.9878 /3.37) x 1e(-25 +7) = 0.589 x 1e-18 → 5.89e-19 J.

So each photon has about 5.89e-19 joules.

Now, the laser's power is 0.001 J/s. To find the number of photons per second, I need to divide the power by the energy per photon.

Number of photons per second, N = Power / E = 0.001 J/s / 5.89e-19 J/photon.

So N = 0.001 / 5.89e-19. Let me compute that. 0.001 is 1e-3. So 1e-3 /5.89e-19 = (1/5.89)*1e16 → approx 0.1696e16 → 1.696e15 photons per second.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.20e15, D is 2.50e15. Hmm, my calculation gives about 1.7e15, which is closer to option A (1.70e15), but wait I'm getting 1.7e15 with my calculation.

Wait, did I compute the energy per photon correctly? Let me check the calculation again.

E = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.
c = 3e8 m/s.
λ=337e-9 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then, hc/λ = (1.9878e-25) / (337e-9) = 1.9878e-25 / 3.37e-7 = (1.9878 /3.37) ) * 1e(-25 +7) → 0.589 * 1e-18 = 5.89e-19 J per photon.

Yes, that's correct. So the number of photons per second is 0.001 / 5.89e-19.

Wait, 0.001 is 1e-3. So 1e-3 /5.89e-19 = (1 /5.89) * 1e16 → approximately 0.1696e16 → 1.696e15.

Options: A is 1.70e15, which is 1.70 x 10^15, which matches closely.

Wait but wait, let me compute 1e-3 divided by 5.89e-19.

Let me compute 1e-3 /5.89e-19 = (1 /5.89) * 1e16.

1/5.89 is approximately 0.1696.

0.1696 *1e16 = 1.696e15.

So about 1.7e15 photons per second.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.70e15. But wait, the options are in the answer format, and the user wrote the options as:

Option A: 1.70 ×10^15

Option B: 3.00 ×10^15

C: 1.20 ×10^15

D: 2.50 ×10^15.

So, the correct answer would be A) 1.70e15.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make any calculation mistakes?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact numbers more accurately.

E = (6.62607015e-34) * (3e8) / (337e-9)

Let me compute this more precisely.

6.62607015e-34 *3e8 = 1.987821045e-25 J·m.

Divide by 337e-9 m:

1.987821045e-25 / 337e-9 = (1.987821045 / 337) * 1e-16.

Wait, 1e-25 / 1e-9 is 1e-16. So, 1.987821045 /337 is approximately 0.005885.

Wait 337 * 0.005885 = 337 * 5.885e-3 = approx 337 * 0.005 = 1.685, and 337 * 0.000885 ≈ 0.298. So total around 1.983, which is close to 1.9878. So 0.005885 is correct.

So E ≈ 0.005885e-16 J → 5.885e-19 J per photon.

So number of photons per second is 0.001 J/s / 5.885e-19 J/photon.

0.001 is 1e-3.

1e-3 /5.885e-19 = (1e-3) / (5.885e-19) = (1 /5.885) * 1e16.

Compute 1/5.885 ≈ 0.1698.

0.1698 *1e16 = 1.698e15 photons per second.

So approximately 1.70e15, which is option A.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A:1.70×10^15

B:3.00×10^15

C:1.20×10^15

D:2.50×10^15.

So, the correct answer is A.

To determine the number of photons emitted per second by a 1.00 mW nitrogen laser with a wavelength of 337 nm, we proceed as follows:

1. **Convert the power to joules per second**:  
   The power of the laser is given as 1.00 mW, which is equivalent to 0.001 J/s.

2. **Calculate the energy per photon**:  
   The energy of a single photon is given by the equation:  
   \[
   E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]  
   where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light), and \( \lambda = 337 \, \text{nm} = 337 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) (wavelength). Substituting these values:  
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{337 \times 10^{-9}}
   \]  
   First, calculate the numerator:  
   \[
   (6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8) = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}
   \]  
   Then, divide by the wavelength:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{337 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.89 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/photon}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of photons per second**:  
   The number of photons emitted per second is given by:  
   \[
   N = \frac{\text{Power}}{\text{Energy per photon}}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   N = \frac{0.001}{5.89 \times 10^{-19}}
   \]  
   Simplify:  
   \[
   N = \frac{1 \times 10^{-3}}{5.89 \times 10^{-19}} = \frac{1}{5.89} \times 10^{16}
   \]  
   Calculate \( \frac{1}{5.89} \approx 0.1698 \):  
   \[
   N \approx 0.1698 \times 10^{16} = 1.698 \times 10^{15} \, \text{photons/s}
   \]

4. **Compare with the options**:  
   The calculated value of \( 1.698 \times 10^{15} \, \text{photons/s} \) is closest to option A, \( 1.70 \times 10^{15} \, \text{photons/s} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: A**
