Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about copper and the movement of free electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the average distance the free electrons travel between collisions is 4e-8 meters. And their average speed is 1.21e6 m/s. I need to find out how many collisions per second and also the time between collisions. The options are given from A to J, but I have to figure it out myself.

Wait, I remember that the average distance between collisions (let's call that 'd') is related to the speed (v) and the time between collisions (t) by the equation d = v * t. Oh right, because distance equals speed multiplied by time. So rearranging that, time between collisions would be t = d / v. That makes sense.

So let's plug in the numbers. d is 4e-8 meters and v is 1.21e6 m/s. So t = (4e-8) / (1.21e6). Let me calculate that. 4 divided by 1.21 is approximately 3.305, and then the exponents are 10^-8 divided by 10^6, which is 10^-14. So t is about 3.3e-14 seconds. Looking at the options, I see option I has 2.8e-14, which is close but not exactly. Hmm, wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 4e-8 divided by 1.21e6. Let me compute 4 / 1.21 first. 1.21 is 121/100, so 4/1.21 is approximately 3.30578. Then, 10^-8 divided by 10^6 is 10^-14. So t is 3.30578e-14 seconds. So the time between collisions is approximately 3.3e-14 s. Looking at the options, option I says 2.8e-14, which is about 2.8e-14. Close but not exact. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, maybe I should compute 4e-8 divided by 1.21e6 precisely. Let's write it as (4 / 1.21) * 1e-14. 4 divided by 1.21 is 3.305789..., so 3.305789e-14 s. So the time between collisions is about 3.3e-14 s. Looking at the options, I don't see an option with 3.3e-14. Wait, let me look again.

Looking at the options:

A: 5e-14 s → no.

B: 2.6e-14 → no.

C: 2.2e-14 → no.

D: 3.6e-14 → no.

E: 6.7e-14 → no.

F: 2.5e-14 → no.

G:4.0e-14 → no.

H:3.3e-14 → wait, option H is 3.3e-14. Hmm, but the time is 3.3e-14, so the time between collisions is 3.3e-14 seconds. So the time between collisions is about that, but looking at the options, H says 3.3e-14 s. But wait, the options have collisions per second. So the options are in the format collisions/s and time/s.

Wait, the question is asking for two things: collisions per second (which is the frequency, ν = 1/t) and the time between collisions (which is t = 1/ν).

So from the time between collisions, I can find the number of collisions per second by taking the reciprocal.

Wait, wait, the time between collisions is t. So the number of collisions per second is 1/t. So if t is 3.3e-14 s, then ν = 1/(3.3e-14) ≈ 3.03e13 collisions per second.

Looking at the options, option H says 3.3e13 collisions/s. So the first value is 3.3e13 and the time between is 3.3e-14 s. So the answer should be option H. Let me check the options again.

Wait, let me double-check the options:

H: 3.0 × 10^13 collisions/s and 3.3 × 10^-14 s.

So yes, that matches. But wait, in the options, the time between collisions is 3.3e-14 s. So the first value is 3.3e13, which is option H.

Wait, but earlier I thought the time between collisions was approximately 3.3e-14 s. So the first option is 3.3e13 collisions per second, and the time is 3.3e-14 s. So that's option H.

But wait, looking back at the question, the options are given as options A to J. Let me see:

Options:

A: 2.0e13 and 5e-14.

B: 3.8e13 and 2.6e-14.

C:4.5e13 and 2.2e-14.

D:2.8e13 and 3.6e-14.

E:1.5e13 and 6.7e-14.

F:4.0e13 and 2.5e-14.

G:2.5e13 and 4.0e-14.

H:3.0e13 and 3.3e-14.

I:3.5e13 and 2.8e-14.

J:1.2e13 and 8.3e-14.

So H says 3.0e13 and 3.3e-14. That's exactly what I calculated. So, option H is correct.

Wait, but the time between collisions is 3.3e-14 s, so the number of collisions per second is 1/(3.3e-14) ≈ 3.03e13. So option H is correct. But wait, why is option I also has 2.8e13?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 4e-8 divided by 1.21e6 more accurately.

Compute the exponent: 1e-8 / 1e6 = 1e-14. The numbers 4/1.21 is approximately 3.305789. So 3.305789e-14 s.

So the time between collisions is about 3.3e-14 s. So the number of collisions per second is 1 / 3.3e-14 = approximately 3.03e13 s^-1. Which is 3.03e13 collisions per second. Looking at the options, option H says 3.0e13.

Hmm, but option I is 3.5e13 and 2.8e-14. So why is that?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The time between collisions is t = d/(v). So yes, that's right. Then collisions per second is 1/t.

Wait, perhaps I should compute t more accurately. Let me compute 4e-8 / 1.21e6.

Let me compute that division.

4 / 1.21 is 3.305789... So 3.305789e-14 seconds. So t is about 3.3e-14 s. So collisions per second is 1/t which is about 3.03e13.

Looking at the options:

Option H: 3.0e13 and 3.3e-14.

So that's correct. So the correct answer should be option H.

But wait, looking at the options, the options are:

A:2.0e13 and 5e-14.

Wait, wait, the actual calculations:

Wait, 4e-8 divided by 1.21e6.

Let me compute 4e-8 / 1.21e6.

4 / 1.21 is approximately 3.305789. Then, 1e-8 / 1e6 = 1e-14.

So t = 3.305789e-14 s.

So the time between collisions is 3.3e-14 s.

So the number of collisions per second is 1/(3.3e-14) = approximately 3.03e13.

Looking at the options, option H is 3.0e13 and 3.3e-14 s. So that's correct.

But wait, let me check the options again because I might have made a mistake. Oh, wait, option I has 3.5e13 and 2.8e-14. So why is that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 4e-8 divided by 1.21e6.

Wait, 4e-8 / 1.21e6 = (4 / 1.21) * (1e-8 / 1e6) = 3.305789 * 1e-14 = 3.305789e-14 s. So that's correct.

Hmm, so the correct answer should be option H. So the first part is 3.0e13 collisions per second, and the time between collisions is 3.3e-14 seconds.

Wait, but wait, the options:

Option H: 3.0e13 and 3.3e-14. So that is correct.

To determine the number of collisions per second and the time between collisions, we use the relationship between distance, speed, and time. The formula for the time between collisions is:

\[
t = \frac{d}{v}
\]

where \( d = 4 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m} \) is the average distance between collisions, and \( v = 1.21 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \) is the average speed of the electrons. Substituting the values:

\[
t = \frac{4 \times 10^{-8}}{1.21 \times 10^6} = \frac{4}{1.21} \times 10^{-14} \approx 3.305789 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{s}
\]

The time between collisions is approximately \( 3.3 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{s} \). To find the number of collisions per second, we take the reciprocal:

\[
\nu = \frac{1}{t} = \frac{1}{3.305789 \times 10^{-14}} \approx 3.03 \times 10^{13} \, \text{collisions/s}
\]

Thus, the number of collisions per second is approximately \( 3.0 \times 10^{13} \), and the time between collisions is \( 3.3 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{s} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**H: \( 3.0 \times 10^{13} \, \text{collisions/s} \) and \( 3.3 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{s} \)**.
