Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it. The question is about the last character of the response, which is the letter I choose. The question is about the last character of the response being the letter I select. So, the options are various times after ovulation when the egg can be fertilized.

The question states: "The egg can be fertilized until about _______ after ovulation."

The options are labeled A through J, with each option representing a different time frame. I need to select the correct letter. 

Let me think about this. I remember that after the egg is formed, the embryo starts to develop. The process of fertilization is the start, but the egg itself isn't fertilized; that's the embryo. The egg can be fertilized for a certain period after ovulation. But wait, isn't fertilization the process that starts, and the egg itself isn't actually fertilized? Oh right, the fertilization happens within the egg, not before. So once the egg is formed, the fertilization occurs within it, which takes time but the question is asking about when the egg can be fertilized. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, the last character of the answer is the letter I choose. So the question is about when the egg can be fertilized after ovulation, regardless of whether the egg itself is being fertilized. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me think again. Fertilization occurs inside the egg, but the fertilization is initiated after the egg is formed. Once the egg is formed, the process starts, but the egg itself isn't actually being fertilized. The egg is the mother, and the sperm fertilizes it. So once the egg is formed, the fertilization happens, and the process can continue. So the question is about the time after ovulation (which I think is when the egg is formed) when the fertilization can occur.

Wait, but the options are about the time after ovulation, which is the moment when the egg starts to develop. So the egg itself isn't being fertilized before that. So the question is probably referring to when the fertilization can continue. 

I think the egg can be fertilized until about 24 hours after ovulation. Because after that, the sperm can't fertilize the egg anymore. So the correct answer would be D: 24 hours.

Wait, but I should make sure. Let me think about each option:

A: 48 hours – that's a full day. I think the egg can't be completely fertilized beyond a few hours, maybe? Or perhaps it's more than that.

B: 6 hours – seems too short.

C: 36 hours – that's almost a day and a half.

D: 24 hours – that's a day.

E: 1 month – that seems too long. The egg can't be fertilized for a month.

F: 1 week – probably not.

G: 12 hours – seems too short.

H: Immediately after ovulation – that's not possible because the egg is still developing.

I: 72 hours – that's 3 days.

J: 2 weeks – that's about 14 days, which seems too long.

So, the correct answer should be D: 24 hours. Because after that, the egg can't be fertilized anymore. I think the process stops around 24 hours after the egg is formed.

The correct answer is D: 24 hours.
