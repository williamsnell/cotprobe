Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again. Hmm, the question is about passengers on a carnival ride. They move at a constant speed in a horizontal circle. The radius is 5.0 meters, and they make a complete circle in 4.0 seconds. The question is, what's their acceleration? And there are multiple-choice options.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on circular motion formulas. Let me think. Oh right, circular motion involves centripetal acceleration. The formula for centripetal acceleration is a = v²/r, but wait, wait—no, that's another formula. Oh, right! The correct formula is a = v²/r, but sometimes people use a = (4π²r)/T², where T is the period—time for one full rotation.

Alternatively, since the question gives me the time for a full circle (which is the period T), maybe I should use that formula. Let me see. The period T is 4.0 seconds. So, the formula I should use is a = (4π²r)/(T²). Let me plug in the numbers.

So, radius r is 5.0 m. So, 4 * pi squared is... pi is approximately 3.1416. Pi squared is about 9.8696. So 4 * 9.8696 is about 39.4784. Then, r is 5, so 39.4784 * 5 = 197.392. Then, T squared is 16 (since 4 squared is 16). So, 197.392 divided by 16 is approximately 12.337. So the acceleration is about 12.337 m/s². Looking at the options, option I is 12, which is close. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait another approach: another formula for centripetal acceleration is a = (v²)/r, and since v is the speed. Speed can be found from the circumference. The circumference is 2πr, so in 4 seconds, v is (2πr)/T. So v = (2 * 3.1416 *5)/4. Let's compute that. 2 * 3.1416 is 6.2832. 6.2832 *5 is 31.416. Divided by 4 is 7.854 m/s. So v is about 7.854 m/s.

Now, a = v²/r. So (7.854)^2 is approximately 61.67. Divide by 5. So 61.67 /5 = 12.334 m/s². So that's about 12.33. So the closest option is 12, which is option I.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check which formula I used. Oh, wait, another way to get a is using a = (4π² r)/T². Let's compute that again. 4π² is about 39.478. Multiply by 5: 39.478 *5= 197.39. Divide by (4)^2=16. So 197.39/16= 12.336 m/s². So same result.

So the acceleration is approximately 12.34 m/s². Looking at the options, the closest is option I:12. So the answer should be I.

To determine the acceleration of the passengers on the carnival ride, we use the formula for centripetal acceleration, which is given by:

\[
a = \frac{4\pi^2 r}{T^2}
\]

where:
- \( r = 5.0 \, \text{m} \) (radius of the circular path),
- \( T = 4.0 \, \text{s} \) (time for one complete revolution).

First, calculate \( 4\pi^2 \):
\[
4\pi^2 \approx 4 \times (3.1416)^2 \approx 4 \times 9.8696 \approx 39.4784
\]

Next, multiply by the radius:
\[
39.4784 \times 5.0 \approx 197.392
\]

Then, divide by \( T^2 \):
\[
\frac{197.392}{(4.0)^2} = \frac{197.392}{16} \approx 12.337 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

Thus, the acceleration is approximately \( 12.34 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Among the given options, the closest value is **12**.
