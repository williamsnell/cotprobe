Okay, so I've got this real estate question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the setup is a rancher who owns a property by way of warranty deed to a woman. The woman gave her niece a mortgage on the ranch to secure a loan from the niece to the woman, which is $500,000. The mortgage was recorded immediately. Two years later, the woman sold the ranch to a farmer by a quitclaim deed. Then, the woman defaulted on the mortgage, and her niece brought a lawsuit against the farmer to recover the due amount. The question is about whether the mortgagee (the woman) will probably succeed or not, and why.

Let me break it down. First, the initial conveyance was a warranty deed, which generally means the grantee (woman) has a legal right to the property. When the woman gave the mortgage, that's a separate contract between her and the mortgagee. The mortgagee is the mortgagee, so the woman is the owner of the property, but the mortgage is on the property, not on her. 

The next step is that the woman sells the ranch to a farmer via a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed is used to transfer ownership of property without conveying the title to the grantee. So, the woman gets the property, but the farmer doesn't take ownership yet. The farmer will have the right to use the property as she did, but the mortgage is still on the property.

Now, the woman defaulted on the mortgage. So the mortgagee (the woman) is in default. The question is whether the niece's action against the farmer will succeed. The options suggest various reasons why the mortgagee might or might not succeed.

Let me think about the implied duties here. When a mortgagee (like the woman) uses a mortgage on a property, she typically has certain implied duties to manage the mortgage. One such duty is to take reasonable steps to ensure that the mortgage is enforced. 

In this case, the woman had a quitclaim deed to the farmer. But a quitclaim deed doesn't absolve the grantee of any mortgage obligations. So the woman might still be responsible for the mortgage. But wait, the woman conveyed the property via warranty deed to the farmer. So the warranty deed gives the grantee (woman) a duty to maintain the property. The warranty deed doesnâ€™t necessarily absolve the grantee of the mortgage debt.

Wait, but the woman is the one who gave the mortgage, so her own acts as a mortgagee are her implied duties. The woman didn't take any steps to manage the mortgage (like paying it off, renewing, etc.), but she gave the mortgage to someone else. So, the woman might still be liable for the mortgage debt because the mortgagee's duties are on her.

But wait, the woman's conveyance to the farmer was a quitclaim deed, which doesn't absolve the mortgagee (woman) of her mortgage obligations. So the woman can still enforce her mortgage. Therefore, the mortgagee is still responsible because the woman conveyed the property but the mortgage was on the property. She didn't do anything to manage the mortgage, so the mortgagee (woman) is still in the dark.

Wait, but wait. The woman had a warranty deed to the farmer. The warranty deed is a form of conveyance, but it's not a transfer of the mortgage. So when the woman sold the property to the farmer, she didn't transfer the mortgage. So the mortgage remains on the property. Therefore, the woman is still responsible for the mortgage.

When the woman defaulted, she had to make sure the mortgage was paid off. The woman didn't take any steps to pay it off, so she was in default. The mortgagee (woman) is still responsible because she gave the mortgage and didn't manage it.

Now, the question is whether the woman's mortgagee (the woman) will probably succeed. Let's look at the options:

Option I says the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility for the mortgage by accepting the quitclaim deed. But wait, the quitclaim deed is not an implied agreement. It's just a form of conveyance. If the farmer had the right to use the property, but the mortgagee is the woman, the woman may still have her own duties.

Option H says the woman was still legally responsible. That makes sense because she conveyed the property but didn't manage the mortgage. So she has the right to enforce her own mortgage obligations.

But wait, another point: the mortgagee (woman) had a warranty deed to the farmer. That's a form of ownership transfer, but does it absolve the mortgagee of obligations? I think a warranty deed is generally considered a form of transfer, but not an implied agreement. So the woman is still responsible for the mortgage.

So the woman is still in the dark, so she is a mortgagee and thus liable. Therefore, the defaulting woman will likely have to pay back the mortgage. The defaulting woman's action is a lawsuit against the farmer. The farmer is the one who sells the property. The woman's interest isn't absolved, so she can sue.

Wait, but what if the woman had a constructive notice of the mortgage? Option F says the farmer was not a party, and G says the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility. Option H says the woman was still responsible.

Wait, the woman conveyed the property to the farmer via a quitclaim deed. The quitclaim deed doesn't absolve the mortgagee. So the woman is still responsible. So the woman can sue the farmer because she's the mortgagee.

Wait, but the woman's conveyance was a warranty deed, which is a form of conveyance, but not an implied transfer. So she is responsible for the mortgage.

But wait, another point: the woman had a warranty deed to the farmer. So the woman is the owner, but the farmer is the grantee. So the woman is the owner, and the farmer is the buyer. She gave the mortgage to the farmer, but she didn't take any action. So the woman is still responsible.

So the mortgagee (woman) will have to sue the farmer because she's the one who gave the mortgage. So the woman's action is a lawsuit against the farmer, and the farmer is the one who owns the property but didn't manage the mortgage. 

So the woman, as the mortgagee, is responsible for the mortgage. So the defaulting woman (defendant) will likely have to pay the mortgage, which is $500k. So she'll win because she is a mortgagee and has a duty to manage the mortgage.

Looking at the options, which one says that the woman is a mortgagee and will probably succeed because of her implied duty?

Option I says the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility, but I don't think that's correct. The farmer is the grantee (who bought the property), and the implied duty is on the woman, not the farmer.

Option H says the woman was still responsible. So that would be correct.

Wait, but the woman's conveyance to the farmer was a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed doesn't absolve the mortgagee of the debt. So the woman is still responsible.

So the woman is a mortgagee, so she's liable. So the defaulting woman will probably have to pay the $500k.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option I or H. Let me check what each option says.

Option I: The farmer implicitly accepted responsibility for the mortgage by accepting the quitclaim deed. No, that's incorrect. The quitclaim deed doesn't absolve the mortgagee.

Option H: The woman was still legally responsible for the mortgage debt. That sounds right. So the woman is a mortgagee and is responsible.

Wait, but another thought: the woman conveyed the property to the farmer via a warranty deed. A warranty deed is a form of transfer, but it doesn't transfer the obligation to the mortgagee. So the woman is still responsible for the mortgage.

So the woman is a mortgagee and has a duty to manage the mortgage. Therefore, the defaulting woman will have to pay it back. So the defaulting woman (defendant) will have to pay $500k. Thus, she will succeed because she is a mortgagee and has a duty to honor the mortgage.

Wait, but looking at the options again. Let me see:

Looking at the options:

A: succeed because the mortgage was recorded immediately. Hmm, why would that matter? Maybe the mortgage was recorded, but that's probably not the main reason for success.

B: Not succeed because the quitclaim deed didn't reference the mortgage. But the quitclaim deed did reference the mortgageâ€”the woman gave the mortgage to the farmer. So the defendant (woman) is still responsible because she gave the mortgage.

Wait, but the woman's conveyance to the farmer was a quitclaim deed. The quitclaim deed doesn't absolve the mortgagee. So the woman is still responsible.

C: Succeed because an implied delegation of duties resulted from the woman's conveyance. Implied delegation is when the grantee takes on the obligations as the grantor. But the woman conveyed the property via a warranty deed, which is a form of transfer, not delegation. So unless she took on the duty herself, which she didn't, this isn't the case.

D: Not succeed because the farmer wasn't a party. That's probably not right because the farmer is the buyer, and the woman is the mortgagee.

E: Succeed because the quitclaim deed doesn't absolve. No, E says the oppositeâ€”it would mean the farmer absolves the debt, which isn't the case.

F: Not succeed unless the farmer had constructive notice. That's more about the farmer's knowledge, which isn't the issue here.

G: Succeed because the niece was a third-party beneficiary. The woman is the mortgagee, not a beneficiary. So G is incorrect.

I: Succeed because the woman implicitly accepted the debt. No, because the woman didn't take any action.

J: Succeed because the farmer implicitly accepted the mortgage. No, the farmer didn't take any action.

So among the options, H and I are about the woman being a mortgagee and the farmer's actions.

Wait, the woman is the mortgagee, so she's responsible. So she is a mortgagee and will have to pay the debt. The only option that says the woman is a mortgagee and will succeed is option I. But wait, option I says the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility. No, that's not correct, as the farmer didn't take any action.

Wait, but the woman is the mortgagee, so she is responsible. So the correct answer would be option I, but wait, no. Wait, option I says the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility. But the woman is the mortgagee. So the woman is the one who is responsible.

Looking back, the woman is the mortgagee (the owner of the property), so she's the one who gave the mortgage. So she has the duty to honor the mortgage and pay it back.

So the woman is a mortgagee, and thus she will be liable for the mortgage. Therefore, the defaulting woman (the defendant) will have to pay the $500k. So the defaulting woman will succeed because she's a mortgagee and is responsible for the debt.

Looking at the options, which option says that the woman is a mortgagee and will probably succeed?

Looking at the options:

Option I says the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility. No, that's incorrect. The woman is the mortgagee.

Looking again, perhaps the correct option isn't present. Wait, let's read all the options again.

Wait, the woman gave the mortgage to the farmer. So the woman is the mortgagee. So she is responsible for the mortgage. So the defaulting woman (defendant) will be able to sue the farmer because she is the mortgagee.

The options:

A: succeeds because the mortgage was recorded immediately. No, that's not the reason.

B: not because the deed didn't reference the mortgage. The deed did, but the deed is a quitclaim, not a transfer, so she's still responsible.

C: succeeds because of delegation. No, she didn't delegate.

D: not because the farmer wasn't a party. No, the farmer is the buyer.

E: succeeds because the deed didn't absolve. No, the deed did absolve.

Wait, option E says "succeed because the quitclaim deed does not absolve the mortgage debt." But that's incorrect because the quitclaim deed is not an absolution; it's just an option to transfer ownership. So the woman is still responsible.

Wait, perhaps option I is correct because the woman implicitly accepted the debt. No, because the woman didn't take any action. The only way the farmer could have implicitly accepted is if he knew about the mortgage, but that's not the issue here.

Wait, another angle: the woman conveyed the property to the farmer via warranty deed, and the woman gave the mortgage to the farmer. The woman didn't take any action, so the farmer didn't do anything. So the woman is still responsible.

Therefore, the woman (the mortgagee) will have to pay the $500k. So the defaulting woman will succeed.

Looking at the options, the options that say the woman is a mortgagee and will probably succeed are H and I.

Wait, the options are:

H: succeed because the woman was still responsible for the mortgage debt.

I: succeed because the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility.

But the woman is the mortgagee, and the farmer didn't take any action.

H is correct. Because the woman is the mortgagee, she's responsible for the debt. So the woman will have to pay back.

So the correct answer would be option I or H. But option I is about the farmer implicitly accepting responsibility, which isn't correct. Option H is about the woman being responsible.

Wait, another thought: when the woman conveyed the property via warranty deed to the farmer, the warranty deed is a form of transfer. So the woman is the owner of the property, and the farmer is the grantee with the warranty deed. She gave the mortgage to the farmer. So the woman is the mortgagee, and thus liable for the mortgage. So the woman has to pay back $500k.

So the correct answer is option H: The woman was still legally responsible for the mortgage debt.

Wait, but what about the quitclaim deed? The woman conveyed the property to the farmer via a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed doesn't absolve the mortgagee of their responsibility. So the woman is still responsible for the mortgage.

So the correct answer is that the woman is a mortgagee and will have to pay back the debt. Looking at the options, option H says the woman was still responsible.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap.

The woman (as the mortgagee) gave the mortgage to the farmer. The woman conveyed the property via a warranty deed, which doesn't absolve her of the mortgage obligations. The quitclaim deed allows the farmer to use the property without the mortgagee taking any action. So the woman is still responsible for the mortgage because she conveyed the property but didn't manage it herself.

So the woman is a mortgagee and is responsible for the $500k. So the defendant (woman) will have to pay it back. So the correct answer is that she is a mortgagee and is liable, so the defaulting woman (defendant) will probably have to pay the debt.

Looking at the options, none of them say that. Let's re-examine the options.

Option I: ... implicitly accepted responsibility. No, because she didn't take any action.

Option H: ... was still responsible. Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option I is incorrect, and option H is correct.

Wait, but looking again, the options are:

A: succeeds, because the mortgage was recorded immediately.

B: not because the deed didn't reference the mortgage.

C: succeeds because of delegation.

D: not because farmer wasn't a party.

E: succeeds because the deed didn't absolve.

F: not because the farmer had constructive notice.

G: succeeds because the niece was a third party.

H: succeeds because the woman was still responsible.

I: succeeds because the farmer implicitly accepted.

J: succeeds because the farmer implicitly accepted.

Wait, the woman is the mortgagee, so she is responsible. So she is a mortgagee, and she is responsible for the debt. So the correct answer would be option H.

But what about the quitclaim deed? The woman conveyed the property to the farmer via a quitclaim deed. The quitclaim deed doesn't absolve the mortgagee, so the woman is still responsible.

Wait, but the woman had a warranty deed to the farmer. Does that imply she's responsible for the mortgage?

Yes. Because the warranty deed gives her the right to use the property, but not the obligation to pay the mortgage. If she had any actions she took, but she didn't, the mortgagee (woman) is still responsible.

So the woman is the mortgagee. She gave the mortgage to the farmer, but she didn't do anything. So she's still responsible.

So the correct answer is option H: the woman was still responsible.

Wait, but another point: The woman had a warranty deed to the farmer. That means the woman has the right to use the property, but she's not obligated to pay the mortgage. So the woman is the mortgagee and is responsible for the debt. So yes, the woman is still responsible.

Therefore, the correct answer is option H.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the woman, who conveyed a $500,000 mortgage to the farmer via a quitclaim deed, will succeed in recovering the debt against the farmer. The woman also defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an action against the farmer. The key points to consider are the roles of the mortgagee (woman) and the implied duties under the conveyance.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Conveyance and Mortgagee**: The woman had a warranty deed to the farmer, meaning she has the right to use the property but is not obligated to pay the mortgage. She did not take any steps to manage the mortgage, so she is still responsible for it.

2. **Implied Delegation**: A warranty deed does not absolve the mortgagee of their obligations. The woman is the mortgagee, and she is responsible for the $500,000 mortgage.

3. **Quatclaim Deed**: The woman conveyed the property to the farmer via a quitclaim deed, which does not absolve the mortgagee of their obligations. The woman is still responsible for the mortgage.

4. **Defaulting Woman'sAction**: The defaulting woman is a third-party beneficiary because she is the mortgagee and is responsible for the debt. Therefore, she will succeed in her action against the farmer.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A**: "Succeed, because the mortgage was recorded immediately." Incorrect. The mortgage was recorded, but the recording does not absolve the mortgagee.
- **B**: "Not succeed, because the mortgage was not recorded." Incorrect. The mortgage was recorded, and the woman is still responsible.
- **C**: "Succeed, because an implied delegation of duties resulted from the woman's conveyance to the farmer." Incorrect. The woman did not take any actions, so she is not implicitly responsible.
- **D**: "Not succeed, because the farmer wasn't a party to the conveyance." Incorrect. The farmer is the grantee, not a party.
- **E**: "Succeed, because the quitclaim deed did not absolve the mortgage debt." Incorrect. The quitclaim deed does not absolve the mortgagee.
- **F**: "Not succeed, because the woman had constructive notice of the mortgage." Incorrect. Constructive notice is not relevant here.
- **G**: "Not succeed, because the woman had a mortgagee's duty to renew the mortgage." Incorrect. The woman is the mortgagee, not a beneficiary.
- **H**: "Succeed, because the woman was still legally responsible for the mortgage debt." Correct. The woman is the mortgagee and is still responsible for the $500,000 mortgage.
- **I**: "Succeed, because the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility for the mortgage debt by accepting the quitclaim deed." Incorrect. The quitclaim deed does not absolve the mortgagee.
- **J**: "Succeed, because the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility for the mortgage debt." Incorrect. The farmer is the grantee, not the beneficiary.

The correct answer is **H**, as the woman is the mortgagee and is still responsible for the $500,000 mortgage. The defaulting woman will have to pay it back.

ANSWER: H
