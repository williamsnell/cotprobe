Question:

According to the Solar Nebular theory what are asteroids and comets?

Options:

A: They are the shattered remains of collisions between planets.
B: They are chunks of rock or ice that condensed long after the planets and moons had formed.
C: They are solidified lava from the early solar system.
D: They are leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets.
E: They are remnants of the original nebular cloud that didn't form into a planet.
F: They are debris from the creation of the universe.
G: They are fragments from the explosion of a massive star.
H: They are chunks of rock or ice that were formed by the condensation of space dust.
I: They are chunks of rock or ice that were expelled from planets by volcanoes.
J: They are pieces of planets that were torn apart by gravitational forces.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Solar Nebula Theory. Hmm, I remember that the Solar Nebula hypothesis was proposed to explain the formation of the solar system. Let me think back to what I learned.

The theory suggests that a cloud of gas and small particles, which we now call the nebula, formed in the early universe. This cloud was so hot and dense that it started to collapse under its own gravity. I think the idea is that this collapse would lead to the formation of planets.

So, the question is about what asteroids and comets are according to this theory. Let me look at the options.

Option A: They are the shattered remains of collisions between planets. Wait, that doesn't sound right. The theory says the entire cloud formed first, not that fragments from collisions formed planets. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: They are chunks of rock or ice that condensed long after the planets and moons had formed. Oh, wait, no. The theory says the planets and moons formed as the cloud collapsed. So B says they formed after, which doesn't fit. So B is incorrect.

Option C: They are solidified lava from the early solar system. That doesn't fit either. Lava would be produced by volcanic activity, not the initial cloud.

Option D: They are leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets. Wait, the theory states that the planets formed from the condensation of the nebula, which includes the leftovers of the early planets. So D sounds correct.

Option E: They are remnants of the original nebular cloud that didn't form into a planet. E is correct in that they are remnants, but the question is about asteroids and comets. So E is more about the overall cloud, not specifically the asteroids and comets.

Option F: They are debris from the creation of the universe. No, that doesn't fit. The theory is about the formation of the solar system.

Option G: They are fragments from the explosion of a massive star. I'm not sure about this. The theory doesn't involve a star explosion, so G is probably not correct.

Option H: They are chunks of rock or ice formed by condensation of space dust. Oh, wait, the nebula is a cloud of dust and gas. As it collapses, dust condenses into small grains to form planets. So H's description matches the theory.

Wait, but I thought the theory was about the formation of planets as the cloud collapses, so the bodies formed as part of the cloud. So H is correct.

Option I: They are chunks expelled by volcanoes. No, the theory doesn't suggest any volcanic activity.

Option J: They are pieces from planets torn apart. Again, the theory says the planets formed from the cloud, not that the bodies were pulled apart by gravity.

Wait, the question says about asteroids and comets. So according to the theory, what were they?

In the Solar Nebula theory, the planets formed from the early cloud. So what about the asteroids and comets?

Asteroids and comets are smaller bodies, so they would have formed in the same cloud as the planets. The theory explains that the cloud is so dense that it started to form planets, but what about the smaller bodies?

Wait, the theory's initial formation is the nebula, which then forms planets. So the asteroids and comets would be part of the same cloud as the gas and dust.

Wait, but the question is about what is an asteroid and a comet. So looking back at the options: H says they are fragments from the condensation of space dust. That makes sense. Because the nebula is a cloud of space dust and gas. As it collapses, space dust condenses into small pieces, which form asteroids and comets.

So H and G? Or what's the difference between H and G.

Wait, option G says they're fragments from a star explosion. That doesn't fit the theory, so G is incorrect.

So H is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that the theory also led to the idea that as the cloud collapses, it forms the main planets, but perhaps also smaller bodies like asteroids and comets. So H describes that correctly.

So the correct options are H and G. Wait, no, G is about a star explosion. So H is correct.

So the answer is H.

According to the Solar Nebula theory, the formation of the solar system involves a dense cloud of gas and small particles (referred to as the nebula) that collapses under its own gravity. This collapse leads to the formation of planets and their moons. The theory does not explain the formation of asteroids and comets directly, but it does imply that the initial cloud contains a significant amount of space dust and gas.

To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The theory does not involve the shattered remains of collisions between planets.
- **B**: Incorrect. The theory states that planets and moons formed as the cloud collapsed, not as remnants.
- **C**: Incorrect. The theory does not describe the bodies as solidified lava.
- **D**: Incorrect. The theory does not suggest that leftover planetesimals (planets) formed and never accreted into planets.
- **E**: Incorrect. While the nebula is a remnant, the theory does not focus on the entire cloud.
- **F**: Incorrect. The theory does not involve debris from the creation of the universe.
- **G**: Incorrect. The theory does not describe fragments from a star explosion.
- **H**: Correct. The theory explains that asteroids and comets are fragments of space dust condensing as the nebula collapses.
- **I**: Incorrect. The theory does not involve bodies being expelled by volcanoes.
- **J**: Incorrect. The theory does not describe pieces torn apart by gravitational forces.

The correct answer is **H**, as it accurately describes the formation of asteroids and comets as fragments of space dust condensing in the initial nebula.

**ANSWER: H**
