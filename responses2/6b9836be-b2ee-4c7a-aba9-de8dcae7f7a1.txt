Okay, so I need to figure out what proportion of vegans are likely deficient in vitamin B12. Hmm, I remember learning about vitamin B12 in school. Let me think. Vitamin B12 is important for absorbing iron, right? So, if someone doesn't get enough of this vitamin, their body might not absorb iron properly.

Wait, the question is about the proportion of vegans who are deficient. Vegans are people who eat plant-based foods, like fruits, vegetables, beans, etc., but not animal-derived foods like meat and dairy. So, do they get enough B12?

I think that in plant-based diets, the body doesn't produce B12 naturally. They take it from the diet, like from beans, fruits, or nuts. But does that mean they are deficient? Or do they just have a lower level?

I remember reading that vegans tend to have lower levels of B12 because they don't get it from their food. So, if someone is a vegan, they might have a deficiency because they're not getting B12 from their diet. But wait, is it considered a deficiency or just a lack of intake?

I think deficiency refers to a lack of a substance that should be provided by the diet. So, if a vegan doesn't get enough B12 from their diet, they are deficient. But some vegans might still have enough from their food. So, the proportion that is deficient would be those who don't get enough from their diet. 

Wait, but the question says "likely to be deficient." So, maybe vegans overall are deficient because they don't get B12 from their diet. But I'm a bit confused. Do all plant-based foods contribute to B12 intake, or does it vary?

I think that in a vegan diet, the body doesn't naturally absorbs B12, so they might have lower levels. But it's possible that some vegans get enough from their food. However, the question is about the proportion that is likely deficient. 

I remember reading that about 3% of the population worldwide is deficient in B12. But that's for adults. For vegans, since they're plant-based, maybe their deficiency is higher? Or maybe they have a lower proportion because they don't get it from their diet. Wait, but the correct answer options include 3%, which is option C. 

Alternatively, I think that vegans are more likely to be deficient in B12 because they don't get it from their diet. So, maybe the proportion is higher than the average. But I'm not sure. I think the correct answer is that vegans are likely deficient, so the percentage is around 66% or 85%. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up.

Another approach: I recall that about 66% of vegans are deficient in B12. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Actually, I'm pretty sure that about 3% of the population is deficient in B12. But if vegans are a subset of the population, maybe their proportion is higher or lower. But the question is asking what proportion of vegans is likely to be deficient, not the population. So, perhaps it's the same as the general population's proportion because vegans are a subset and if they're deficient, it's the same percentage. 

Wait, that doesn't sound right. If vegans are a subset, and if they're deficient, the percentage of vegans in the deficiency would be the same as the population's. So, the answer would be about 3%, which is option C. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 66%, which is option A. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another angle: some sources say that vegans are more likely to be deficient in B12 because they don't get it from their food. So, their intake from plants is lower, making them deficient. So, the proportion of vegans deficient would be higher. But the options don't include a high percentage like 66%. The highest option is A: 66%, and then others.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 3%, which is option C, because that's the global deficiency rate. But the question is about vegans, not the global population. So, the proportion in vegans would be the same as the global proportion? Or perhaps it's higher because vegans are more likely to be deficient.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is 66%, which is option A, because vegans are a subset and they are more likely to be deficient. No, that doesn't make sense. Actually, I think the correct answer is option C, 3%, because that's the rate for the general population. So, among vegans, since they have a lower intake from their food, but their deficiency is still present at the same rate. Or maybe not. 

I'm a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is 3%, which is option C. So the answer is C.

The correct answer is C: 3%. Vegans, being plant-based, typically lack B12 from their diet, leading to a deficiency. This deficiency is consistent with the global rate, as vegans are a subset of the population with similar dietary habits. 

Answer: C
