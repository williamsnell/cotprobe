Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. It says, "If a 1-kg object could be converted entirely into energy, how long could a 100-W light bulb be illuminated?" The bulb uses 100 J per second. The question gives options from A to J, each with a different time in years.

Hmm, right. So I think this is about energy and power. The idea is that we're converting a large amount of mass into energy, which then powers a bulb. I remember Einstein's equation E=mc², which relates mass and energy. So I can use that to find out how much energy is released when 1 kg is converted.

Wait, the bulb uses 100 J each second. So the energy per second (power) is 100 watts. The energy from the mass will be the mass (1 kg) multiplied by the speed of light squared (c²). Oh, wait, c is about 3e8 meters per second, so c squared is 9e16 m²/s².

So let me calculate the energy. E = m * c². So 1 kg * (3e8)^2 = 1 * 9e16 = 9e16 joules per second. Wait, that's a huge amount of energy. But the bulb uses 100 J per second, so the time would be the total energy divided by the power.

So time T = E / P. Let me plug in the numbers. E here is 9e16 J, and P is 100 J/s. So T = (9e16 J) / (100 J/s) = 9e14 seconds. Wait, that's a huge time. I need to convert seconds into years to match the options.

How many seconds are in a year? Let's calculate. There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, and 365 days in a year. So:

60 s/min * 60 min/hour = 3600 s/hour
3600 s/h * 24 h/day = 86400 s/day
86400 s/day * 365 days/year ≈ 31,536,000 s/year, which is approximately 3.1536e7 seconds per year.

So, the total time in years would be (9e14 s) / (3.1536e7 s/year). Let me compute that. 

Let me write it as 9e14 divided by 3.1536e7. That's 9 / 3.1536 ≈ 2.854, and 1e14 / 1e7 is 1e7. So 2.854e7 years? Wait, wait. Let me check the exponents. 9e14 is 9 * 10^14. Divided by 3.15e7 (3.15 * 10^7), so 9e14 / 3.15e7 ≈ (9 / 3.15) * 1e7.

9 divided by 3.15 is approximately 2.857. So 2.857e7 years. Looking at the options, I see option F is 7.5e6, G is 4.2e7, H is 2.9e7, I is 1.5e7, J is 6.3e7. So my calculation of approximately 2.85e7 years is closest to option G (4.2e7) or H (2.9e7). Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, 9e14 divided by 3.1536e7 is (9 / 3.1536) * 1e(14-7) = (2.857) * 1e7 = 2.857e7 years. But wait, the options are:

A: 3.0e7, B:1.2e7, C:9e6, D:2e8, E:5.5e7, F:7.5e6, G:4.2e7, H:2.9e7, I:1.5e7, J:6.3e7.

Hmm, 2.85e7 is closest to 2.9e7, which is option H. But wait, another possibility: did I miscalculate the energy?

Wait, E = mc². Oh wait, wait a minute. Because the problem says the bulb uses 100 J per second. So the energy is 9e16 J per second. But the bulb uses 100 J per second. So the time would be 9e16 J / 100 J/s = 9e14 seconds. Oh wait, right! I think I forgot that part. So 9e16 divided by 100 is 9e14 seconds. So that's correct.

So 9e14 seconds / 3.1536e7 seconds/year. Let me compute that more accurately. 9e14 / 3.1536e7 = ?

Divide 9e14 by 3.1536e7: 9 / 3.1536 is approximately 2.857. Then, 1e14 / 1e7 is 1e7. So 2.857e7 years. Which is approximately 2.857 million years. Looking at the options, option G is 4.2e7, H is 2.9e7. Hmm, 2.85e7 is about 2.85 million years. The closest option is H (2.9e7). But wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, 3.1536e7 is 3.1536 x 10^7. So when I do 9e14 / 3.1536e7, it's (9 / 3.1536) * 1e7.

Calculating 9 / 3.1536. Let me do that division precisely. 3.1536 goes into 9 two times, which is 6. Remainder 3. So 3.1536 * 2.857 is about 9. Let's see: 3.1536 * 2.857 ≈ (3 * 2.857) + (0.1536 * 2.857) ≈ 8.571 + 0.440 ≈ 9.011. So that's about right. So 2.857. So 2.857e7 years.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H: 2.9e7. But wait, looking back, the option H is 2.9e7 years. So option H is 2.9e7, which is 29 million years. But my calculation is about 2.85 million. Hmm, that's 2.85e7. The next option is G:4.2e7, which is 42 million. So 2.85 million is closer to 2.9e7.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the exponents. 9e14 divided by 3.1536e7.

So 9e14 / 3.1536e7 = 9/(3.1536) * (1e14)/(1e7) = (approx 2.857) * 1e7 = 2.857e7 years, which is approximately 2.86 million years.

Looking at the options, option H is 2.9e7, which is about 29 million. So that's a little over 2.8 million. But option G is 4.2e7, which is 42 million. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, wait a second: 9e14 seconds is the total energy. Divided by 100 J/s gives 9e14 / 100 = 9e12 * 1e2? No, wait, 9e14 divided by 100 is 9e12. So 9e12 seconds. So that's 9e12 / 3.1536e7.

Wait, 9e12 / 3.1536e7 = 9e5 / 3.1536. Because 1e12 divided by 1e7 is 1e5, so 9e12 / 3.1536e7 = (9 / 3.1536) * 1e5.

Wait, 9 / 3.1536 is about 2.857, so 2.857e5, which is 2.857 x 1e5 = 285,700 years. Which is approximately 2.857 million years. So about 2.857e6 years.

Looking at the options, the only option close is H (2.9e7). Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct this.

Wait, 9e14 J is the total energy. Divided by 100 J/s gives 9e14 / 100 = 9e12 seconds. So 9e12 seconds is the total time, which is 9e12 / (3.1536e7) years.

Calculating that: 9e12 /3.1536e7 = (9 /3.1536) * (1e12 / 1e7) = (approx 2.857) * 1e5 = 2.857e5 years, which is 285,700 years. So 2.857e5 is approximately 2.857 × 10^5, which is 285,700 years.

Looking at the options again:

Option H is 2.9e7, which is 29 million. So that's way higher than our calculation. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, earlier I thought E = mc² = 1 kg * (3e8)^2 = 9e16 J. Then, power is 100 W, so 9e16 / 100 = 9e14 J/s. Then, time is 9e14 / 100 = 9e12 seconds.

So 9e12 / (3.1536e7) = 9e12 / 3.1536e7 = (9/3.1536) * 1e5 = approx 2.857 * 1e5 = 2.857e5 years, which is about 285,700 years.

But none of the options is around 285k, except perhaps H is 2.9e7, which is 29 million. So that's way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the exponents. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 9e14 / 3.1536e7 = 9e14 / 3.1536e7 = (9 /3.1536) * (1e14 /1e7) ) = (2.857) * (1e7) ) = 2.857e7 years.

Ah, so that's correct. So it's 2.857e7, which is approximately 2.86 million years.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A: 3e7 → 30 million years.

H: 2.9e7 → 29 million.

So the correct option is H (2.9e7). But wait, earlier when I thought the bulb's power is 100 J/s, and the energy is 9e16 J per kg, then for 1kg, it's 9e16 J. Then, over 100 J/s, time is (9e16) / (100) = 9e14 s. That's the same as earlier.

Wait, but wait! The problem says the bulb uses 100 J each second. So the energy is 100 J/s. So, 1kg → 9e16 J. So, 9e16 / 100 = 9e14 J/s. So 9e14 J / 100 J/s = 9e14 / 100 = 9e12 seconds.

So, 9e12 / 3.1536e7 = approx 2.857e5 years → 285,700 years.

But the options don't have a value in this range. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 3e7 → 30e6 → 30 million.

H: 2.9e7 → 29 million.

So none of the options is around 285 thousand. Wait, did I miscalculate the exponents? Let me recompute 9e14 divided by 3.1536e7.

9e14 / 3.1536e7 = (9 / 3.1536) * (1e14 / 1e7) ) → (2.857) * (1e7) → 2.857e7.

Wait, 2.857e7 is 28,570,000 years → 28.57 million.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H (2.9e7), which is 29,000,000. So the answer is H.

Wait, but why is the correct option H when the calculation gives about 28.5e6 years?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the total energy. Let me recompute.

E = mc^2. m=1 kg, c=3e8 m/s. So E =1 * (3e8)^2 = 9e16 J. Correct.

Power is 100 W → 100 J/s. So total energy needed is power * time. So time = E / P = 9e16 / 100 = 9e14 J. Correct.

9e14 J / 100 J/s = 9e12 seconds. Correct.

Convert seconds to years: 9e12 / 3.1536e7 = 2.857e5 → 285,700 years.

Which is 2.857e5 years, approximately 285,700 years.

Looking at the options, the only one close to that is H (2.9e7). So H is 29 million, which is about 2.9e7 years, which is about 285,700 years. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but the options don't have 285,700. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I might have confused the formula somewhere. Oh wait! Oh wait, perhaps the bulb's power is 100 W. So 100 Joules per second. So for each second, the bulb uses 100 J. So the time is the total energy divided by 100. 

So 9e16 J / 100 J/s = 9e14 seconds. Then, how many years is that? 9e14 / 3.1536e7. Which is 9e14 / 3.1536e7 = (9 / 3.1536) * 1e7 = 2.857 * 1e7 → 2.857e7 years.

So yes, 2.857e7 is approximately 29 million years. So the option H (2.9e7) is the correct one.

Wait, but the given options are A: 3e7, B:1.2e7, C:9e6, D:2e8, E:5.5e7, F:7.5e6, G:4.2e7, H:2.9e7, I:1.5e7, J:6.3e7.

So, 2.857e7 → approximately 2.86e7. So the closest is option H, which is 2.9e7. Hence, the correct answer is option H.

To determine how long a 1-kg object could illuminate a 100-W light bulb, we use the relationship between energy, power, and time. The energy released by converting 1 kg of mass into energy is given by Einstein's equation:

\[
E = mc^2
\]

where \( m = 1 \, \text{kg} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), so:

\[
E = 1 \times (3 \times 10^8)^2 = 9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{J}
\]

The light bulb uses 100 J of energy per second. To find the total time required, divide the total energy by the power:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{E}{P} = \frac{9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{J}}{100 \, \text{J/s}} = 9 \times 10^{14} \, \text{s}
\]

Next, convert seconds to years. There are approximately \( 3.1536 \times 10^7 \, \text{s/year} \):

\[
\text{Time in years} = \frac{9 \times 10^{14} \, \text{s}}{3.1536 \times 10^7 \, \text{s/year}} = \frac{9}{3.1536} \times 10^{14-7} \, \text{years} \approx 2.857 \times 10^7 \, \text{years}
\]

This calculation shows that the total time required is approximately \( 2.857 \times 10^7 \, \text{years} \), which is about 28.57 million years.

Now, compare this result with the provided options:

- \( \text{A: } 3.0 \times 10^7 \, \text{years} \)
- \( \text{B: } 1.2 \times 10^7 \, \text{years} \)
- \( \text{C: } 9.0 \times 10^6 \, \text{years} \)
- \( \text{D: } 2.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{years} \)
- \( \text{E: } 5.5 \times 10^7 \, \text{years} \)
- \( \text{F: } 7.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{years} \)
- \( \text{G: } 4.2 \times 10^7 \, \text{years} \)
- \( \text{H: } 2.9 \times 10^7 \, \text{years} \)
- \( \text{I: } 1.5 \times 10^7 \, \text{years} \)
- \( \text{J: } 6.3 \times 10^7 \, \text{years} \)

The closest option to \( 2.857 \times 10^7 \, \text{years} \) is **H: \( 2.9 \times 10^7 \, \text{years} \)**.

ANSWER: H
