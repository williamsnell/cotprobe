Alright, I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about the secondary school enrollment in different less-developed countries as of 2020. Let me start by understanding the question thoroughly.

The question lists various countries, and each option (A to J) includes some of them. My task is to determine which group of countries is correct based on their secondary school enrollment levels in 2020.

First, I should probably recall or look up the general trends in secondary education across these countries. I remember that some countries have higher enrollments, while others have lower. Some might have more access to higher education, which could indicate more secondary schools.

Let me go through each country mentioned in the options and think about their 2020 secondary school enrollment status.

Option A: Peru, Uruguay, Cambodia, and Niger.
- Peru: According to some sources, Peru had a high percentage of secondary education in 2020, especially for public schools. I think around 90% or more.
- Uruguay: Uruguay had a high percentage too, maybe around 90% or higher.
- Cambodia: I'm not sure about Cambodia. I think it might have lower enrollment, maybe around 50-60%.
- Niger: I remember Niger had lower secondary enrollment, maybe around 40-50%.

So option A includes two high levels and two lower. That's possible but I'm not sure if all four are correct.

Option B: Pakistan, Niger, Peru, and Bhutan.
- Pakistan: I believe by 2020, Pakistan had a high secondary school rate, perhaps around 85%.
- Niger: As I thought earlier, maybe around 40-50%.
- Peru: High rate, 90%+.
- Bhutan: I think Bhutan had a high percentage. Let's say 80% or more.

So option B has three high and one low. That seems plausible.

Option C: Bhutan, Cambodia, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.
- Bhutan: High, 80-90%.
- Cambodia: Lower, maybe 50-60%.
- Uruguay: High, 90%+.
- Costa Rica: I'm a bit confused. I thought secondary school enrollment in Costa Rica was around 60-70% low to mid, but maybe in 2020, some countries have lower rates. Wait, no, I think in some regions it's higher, but overall, maybe around 60-70%.

So option C includes three high and one low. That's possible.

Option D: Costa Rica, Colombia, Niger, and Timor-Leste.
- Costa Rica: Maybe around 60-70%?
- Colombia: I think Colombia had lower enrollment in secondary schools, perhaps 40-50%.
- Niger: Lower, 40-50%.
- Timor-Leste: Timor-Leste had a high percentage, maybe similar to Peru but maybe a bit higher.

So option D includes two high and two lower. Not sure if all correct.

Option E: Bhutan, Niger, Cambodia, and Costa Rica.
- Bhutan: High, 80-90%.
- Niger: Lower, 40-50%.
- Cambodia: Lower, 50-60%.
- Costa Rica: Maybe around 60-70%.

So option E has three high and one low. Possible.

Option F: Timor-Leste, Pakistan, Peru, and Bhutan.
- Timor-Leste: High, maybe 85-90%.
- Pakistan: High, 85-90%.
- Peru: High, 90+.
- Bhutan: High, 80-90.

So option F includes all four with high enrollment, which I think is not accurate because some countries might have lower.

Option G: Niger, Bhutan, Timor-Leste, and Colombia.
- Niger: Lower, 40-50%.
- Bhutan: High, 80-90.
- Timor-Leste: High, 85-90.
- Colombia: Maybe lower, like 40-50%.

So option G has two high and two low. Not all correct.

Option H: Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Uruguay, and Pakistan.
- Cambodia: Lower, 50-60%.
- Timor-Leste: High, 85-90.
- Uruguay: High, 90+.
- Pakistan: High, 85-90.

So H has three high and one low. Possible.

Option I: Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.
- Colombia: Maybe around 60-70%.
- Peru: High, 90+.
- Uruguay: High, 90+.
- Costa Rica: Maybe around 60-70%.

So I includes three high and one low. Possible.

Option J: Uruguay, Costa Rica, Timor-Leste, and Pakistan.
- Uruguay: High, 90+.
- Costa Rica: Maybe around 60-70%.
- Timor-Leste: High, 85-90.
- Pakistan: High, 85-90.

So J includes three high and one low. Possible.

Hmm, now I'm a bit confused because I'm not entirely sure about the exact enrollment numbers. Let me try to recall or look up the most recent data (as of 2020) for each country.

- **Peru**: According to some sources, in 2020, Peru had about 88% of secondary education available, which is quite high.
- **Uruguay**: I think it had around 90% of secondary education, so a high number.
- **Bhutan**: Bhutan has a significant presence in secondary education; as of 2020, around 85-90% had access.
- **Niger**: In 2020, the percentage was around 40-50%.
- **Costa Rica**: The data I recall is around 60-70%.
- **Timor-Leste**: About 80-85% in secondary education.
- **Colombia**: Maybe 40-50%.
- **Bhutan**: As mentioned, 85-90%.

Now, let's evaluate each option based on these numbers.

**Option A: Peru, Uruguay, Cambodia, and Niger.**
- High (88% for Peru, 90% for Uruguay) → High
- Cambodia: 50-60% → Low
- Niger: 40-50% → Low
So this option includes two highs and two lows. Possible.

**Option B: Pakistan, Niger, Peru, and Bhutan.**
- High (85-90 for Pakistan, 90 for Peru)
- Low (Niger 40-50, Bhutan 85-90)
So three highs and one low. Possible.

**Option C: Bhutan, Cambodia, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.**
- High (Bhutan 85-90, Uruguay 90)
- Low (Costa Rica 60-70, Cambodia 50-60)
So two highs and two lows. Possible.

**Option D: Costa Rica, Colombia, Niger, and Timor-Leste.**
- High (Costa Rica 60-70)
- Low (Niger 40-50, Colombia 40-50, Timor-Leste 80-85)
So three highs and one low. Possible.

**Option E: Bhutan, Niger, Cambodia, and Costa Rica.**
- High (Bhutan 85-90, Costa Rica 60-70)
- Low (Niger 40-50, Cambodia 50-60)
So two highs and two lows. Possible.

**Option F: Timor-Leste, Pakistan, Peru, and Bhutan.**
- High (Timor-Leste 85-90, Pakistan 85-90, Peru 88, Bhutan 85-90)
- Low (None of these countries have low enrollment; in fact, most have higher)
So all four are high. I think this is incorrect because Timor-Leste had a high rate.

Wait, but perhaps Timor-Leste's data is in 2020? I think Timor-Leste's secondary education was 85-90% in 2020. So option F includes all four with high rates. But I'm not sure if that's accurate because some sources might have different numbers. Alternatively, perhaps Timor-Leste had lower than others, but I'm a bit uncertain.

**Option G: Niger, Bhutan, Timor-Leste, and Colombia.**
- High (Bhutan 85-90, Timor-Leste 85-90)
- Low (Niger 40-50, Colombia 40-50)
So two highs and two lows. Possible.

**Option H: Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Uruguay, and Pakistan.**
- High (Timor-Leste 85-90, Pakistan 85-90, Uruguay 90, Cambodia 50-60)
- Low (Camphor 50-60)
So three highs and one low. Possible.

**Option I: Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.**
- High (Costa Rica 60-70, Peru 88, Uruguay 90, maybe Colombia 50-60)
- Low: None of these have low.
So all four are high. I think this is incorrect because I believe some countries have lower.

**Option J: Uruguay, Costa Rica, Timor-Leste, and Pakistan.**
- High (Uruguay 90, Pakistan 85-90, Timor-Leste 85-90)
- Low: Costa Rica 60-70
So three highs and one low. Possible.

Now, the question is to choose which group is correct. I need to recall which countries typically have higher and lower secondary enrollment.

I think some countries have high, some have medium, and others have lower. For example, some countries have high, some have medium, and some have low.

Wait, let me think again. Which countries are known for higher secondary enrollment?

- Peru: High.
- Uruguay: High.
- Pakistan: High.
- Timor-Leste: High.
- Brazil: High.
- Nigeria: Low.
- Cambodia: Low.
- Colombia: Low.
- Costa Rica: Medium.
- Bhutan: High.

So, the correct option must include a mix of high, medium, and low. Let's check each option again.

Option A: Peru (high), Uruguay (high), Cambodia (low), Niger (low). So two highs, two lows. Possible.

Option B: Pakistan (high), Niger (low), Peru (high), Bhutan (high). Three highs, one low. Possible.

Option C: Bhutan (high), Cambodia (low), Uruguay (high), Costa Rica (medium). Two highs, one low, one medium. Possible.

Option D: Costa Rica (medium), Colombia (low), Niger (low), Timor-Leste (high). Two lows, two mediums. Possible.

Option E: Bhutan (high), Niger (low), Cambodia (low), Costa Rica (medium). Two lows, one medium, one high. Possible.

Option F: All four have high. Which is incorrect because Timor-Leste was high, same as others.

Option G: Two highs, two lows. Possible.

Option H: Three highs, one low. Possible.

Option I: All four are high. Incorrect.

Option J: Three highs, one low. Possible.

But I think the correct answer is option A, B, C, D, E, or something else. I'm not certain, so I'll think of another approach.

Wait, another angle: According to some sources, the countries with the highest secondary school enrolling rates as of 2020 are:

- Peru: 88%
- Uruguay: 90%
- Pakistan: 85-90%
- Timor-Leste: 85-90%
- Brazil: 85-90%
- Nigeria: 40-50%

Others like Colombia, Bhutan, and Canada (but Canada isn't listed here) have lower.

So, looking at the options, which ones include a mix?

Option A: two high (Peru, Uruguay), two low (Cambridge, Niger). So correct.

Option B: three high (Pakistan, Peru, Bhutan), one low (Niger). So correct.

Option C: high (Bhutan, Uruguay), low (Cambridge, Costa Rica). So correct.

Option D: medium (Costa Rica), low (Niger, Colombia), high (Timor-Leste). So correct.

Option E: high (Bhutan, Costa Rica), low (Timor-Leste, Nickel). So correct.

Option G: two high (Bhutan, Timor-Leste), two low (Camphor, Colombia). So correct.

Option H: three high (Timor-Leste, Pakistan, Uruguay), one low (Bhutan). So correct.

Option I: all high. Incorrect.

Option J: three high (Uruguay, Timor-Leste, Pakistan), one low (Costa Rica). So correct.

Wait, but the options are all groups of four. Let me see which options include a mix of high, medium, and low.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: Peru, Uruguay, Cambodia, and Niger. Because that includes two high (Peru, Uruguay), and two low (Cambridge, Niger). So option A is correct.

But another thought: I think countries like Cambodia, Colombia, and perhaps Brazil have lower. Let me look:

- Brazil: 80-85% secondary school enrollment.
- Colombia: 40-50%.
- Canada: 80-85% but not listed here.
- Timor-Leste: 85-90%.

So, if option A includes Cambodia (low), which it does, then A is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, the question asks which group of countries has varying levels of secondary school enrollment as of 2020. The analysis involves recalling the trends in secondary education across the listed countries. Here's the breakdown:

- **Peru**: High (88%).
- **Uruguay**: High (90%).
- **Cameroon (Bhutan)**: Low (40-50%).
- **Niger**: Low (40-50%).
- **Brazil**: Medium (80-85%).
- **Timor-Leste**: High (85-90%).
- **Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bhutan)**: High (85-90%).
- **Colombia**: Low (40-50%).
- **Costa Rica**: Medium (60-70%).

Each option includes four countries, and the task is to identify which option includes a mix of high, medium, and low enrollment rates. After evaluating all options, **Option A (Peru, Uruguay, Cambodia, and Niger)** is correct because it includes two high enrollment countries (Peru, Uruguay) and two low enrollment countries (Bhutan, Nigeria). The other options either include too many high or low rates or are inaccurately categorized.

**Answer: A**
