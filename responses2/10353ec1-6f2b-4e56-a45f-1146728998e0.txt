Question:

Joe Troy purchased a chain saw for $1,200 for his lumber mill. The saw will last 6 years and have no residual value. Mr. Troy wishes to use the straight-line method of depreciation. Find the depreciation and book value for the first two years.

Options:

A: $350 per year, $850 after first year, $500 after second year
B: $100 per year, $1100 after first year, $1000 after second year
C: $400 per year, $800 after first year, $400 after second year
D: $250 per year, $950 after first year, $700 after second year
E: $600 per year, $600 after first year, $0 after second year
F: $500 per year, $700 after first year, $200 after second year
G: $150 per year, $1050 after first year, $900 after second year
H: $200 per year, $1000 after first year, $800 after second year
I: $300 per year, $900 after first year, $600 after second year
J: $450 per year, $750 after first year, $300 after second year

Okay, so I've got this problem here about depreciation for a chain saw. Let me see what I can do. 

Joe bought a chain saw for $1,200, and it's supposed to last 6 years with no residual value. He's using the straight-line method. I need to find the depreciation each year and the book value after the first two years. Hmm.

Wait, straight-line depreciation. Right, straight-line is the same each year. So the formula is (Cost - Salvage Value)/Useful Life. Since there's no residual value, that's zero. So (1200 - 0)/6. Let me calculate that. 1200 divided by 6 is 200. Oh, so that means $200 per year depreciation each year.

So the first year, he'll depreciate $200. The book value after the first year is 1200 - 200 = $1000. Right.

Then the second year, same calculation: another $200 depreciation, so total depreciation after two years is 400. The book value is 1200 - 400 = $800.

Wait, let me check the options. Option C says $400 per year, which doesn't match. Option H is $200 per year. Option C is 400, which is wrong. So looking, the correct depreciation per year is $200, so options H and perhaps others.

Option H: $200 per year. Let's see. First year: 200, book value 1000. Second year: 200 more, book value 800. So the options would have that. Looking at the options, option H says $200 per year, $1000 after first year, $800 after second. So that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is $200 per year. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check the straight-line formula. Cost is 1200, useful life 6 years. So 1200 /6 is 200. So yes, each year $200. So the correct answer should be option H.

Wait, but looking again, option H is $200 per year, book value 1000 after first, 800 after second. But wait, the options: option C is 400 per year, which I don't think is correct.

Another option, option H is 200 per year, which is correct. So in the options, option H is $200 per year, first year's book value is 1000, second is 800. So that's correct.

The correct depreciation per year is $200 (calculated as $1,200 / 6 years), and the book value after the first year is $1,000, after the second year $800.

Answer: H
