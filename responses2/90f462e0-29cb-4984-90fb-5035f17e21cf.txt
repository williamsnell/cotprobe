Okay, so I've got this question about the Argo Scholarship Fund. Let me try to figure it out. The question is asking how much money needs to be invested now so that the fund can provide $1,000 scholarships each year for twenty years, with an annual interest rate of 5%. Hmm, sounds like a present value calculation problem.

Wait, so the fund has twenty $1,000 scholarships. That means the total amount needed over twenty years is $20,000. But since it's money that's being invested, I need to calculate the present value of this annuity. Oh right, because the $1,000 each year is going to be received in the future, so we have to discount it back to the present.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r. Let me confirm: PMT is the payment per period, which is $1,000. r is the rate (5% or 0.05), and n is the number of periods, which is 20 years.

Plugging the numbers in: PV = 1000 * [1 - (1.05)^-20 ] / 0.05. Let me calculate (1.05)^-20 first. I think that's the same as 1 divided by (1.05)^20. Let me compute (1.05)^20. I remember that (1.05)^20 is roughly 2.6533, but maybe I should be precise. Alternatively, I can look it up or compute it step by step.

Wait, maybe I can break it down. 1.05^10 is about 1.6289. Then (1.05^10)^2 is that squared, which would be around (1.6289)^2 = about 2.6533. So (1.05)^20 is approx 2.6533. So (1.05)^-20 is 1/2.6533 â‰ˆ 0.3769.

So the numerator in the brackets becomes 1 - 0.3769 = 0.6231. Then, 0.6231 divided by 0.05 is 12.462. Multiply that by 1000 gives 12,462. So the present value is $12,462.

Looking at the options, option A is $12,462, so that should be the answer.

The Argo Scholarship Fund consists of twenty $1,000 scholarships, requiring a total of $20,000 over twenty years. To find the present value (PV) of this annuity, use the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity:

\[ PV = PMT \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \]

Where:
- \( PMT = 1000 \),
- \( r = 0.05 \),
- \( n = 20 \).

First, calculate \( (1.05)^{20} \approx 2.6533 \). Thus, \( (1.05)^{-20} \approx 0.3769 \). The numerator becomes \( 1 - 0.3769 = 0.6231 \). Dividing by \( r = 0.05 \) gives \( 0.6231 / 0.05 = 12.462 \). Multiplying by \( PMT = 1000 \) yields \( PV = 12,462 \).

The correct answer is **$12,462**, which corresponds to option A.
