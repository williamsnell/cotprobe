Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. The question is about finding the equilibrium constant for the reaction H₂ + I₂ ⇌ 2HI. The given equilibrium concentrations are H₂ at 0.9 moles per liter, I₂ at 0.4, and HI at 0.6. I'm a bit rusty on equilibrium calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium constant, K, is calculated using the concentrations of the products and reactants at equilibrium. The formula for K should involve the concentrations of the substances involved, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients.

The reaction is H₂ (g) + I₂ (g) ⇌ 2 HI (g). So the balanced equation uses 1 mole of H₂ and 1 mole of I₂ to produce 2 moles of HI.

The formula I think is K = [HI]^2 / ( [H₂][I₂] ). Because each coefficient becomes the exponent in the K expression.

Wait, let me make sure I have the formula right. For a general reaction aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD, the K is written as K = ( [C]^c [D]^d ) / ( [A]^a [B]^b ). So here, a and b are 1, and c is 2. So yes, K = ( [HI]^2 ) / ( [H₂][I₂] ). That makes sense.

Now, plug in the given values. [HI] is 0.6, [H₂] is 0.9, [I₂] is 0.4.

So K = (0.6)^2 / (0.9 * 0.4). Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute the numerator: 0.6 squared is 0.36.

Then the denominator: 0.9 multiplied by 0.4. Let's calculate that: 0.9 * 0.4 is 0.36.

So K equals 0.36 divided by 0.36. That's 1.

Wait, so K is 1. Let me double-check. 0.6 squared is 0.36, and 0.9 *0.4 is also 0.36. 0.36 /0.36 is 1. So K is 1.

Looking at the options, the choices are A to J. Option B is 1.0, which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the exponents. Oh wait, the reaction produces 2 moles of HI. So, the K expression is correct because the coefficient 2 is in the numerator as an exponent.

Alternatively, maybe I should write it as K = ( [HI]^2 ) / ( [H₂][I₂] ). Yes, that's correct.

So the calculation seems right. The K is 1. So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the equilibrium constant \( K \) for the reaction \( \text{H}_2 + \text{I}_2 \rightleftharpoons 2\text{HI} \), we use the formula:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{HI}]^2}{[\text{H}_2][\text{I}_2]}
\]

The given equilibrium concentrations are:
- \( [\text{H}_2] = 0.9 \, \text{mol/L} \),
- \( [\text{I}_2] = 0.4 \, \text{mol/L} \),
- \( [\text{HI}] = 0.6 \, \text{mol/L} \).

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
K = \frac{(0.6)^2}{(0.9)(0.4)} = \frac{0.36}{0.36} = 1.0
\]

Thus, the equilibrium constant \( K \) is \( 1.0 \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is **B: 1.0**.
