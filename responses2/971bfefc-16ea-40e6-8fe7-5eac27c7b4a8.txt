Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about why someone would call a flock of birds a "society." I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember hearing that birds in a flock have a hierarchy. Like, each bird takes a turn, maybe? So maybe that's the reason. Looking at the options, option A says that because each bird leads the flock. That sounds familiar. So each bird is doing their part, leading the group.

Option C talks about a motion group in society. Hmm, I think a motion group is a group that moves together, like a social group. But does a flock qualify as a motion group? I'm not sure. It depends on the context. Some sources say a motion group is a group of animals that move in a coordinated way, which a flock does. But option C says it's an "elementary form of society," which might not be the best fit.

Option B says they're unrelated. No, that's not right. Birds are definitely social animals, so B is incorrect.

Option D says the collective intelligence is a society. I'm not sure if that's a correct analogy. It might not be precise enough.

Option E suggests they perform individual activities. That doesn't make sense because a society is about group behavior, not individual actions.

Option F talks about long-term partnerships for breeding. No, that's more about the breeding cycle rather than the societal term.

Option G mentions a common habitat and resources. The term "society" often relates to collective behavior or social structures, so this might not be the best explanation.

Option H says pecking order. I don't recall any pecking order that defines a society. Maybe it's more about hierarchy than social structure.

Option I is about regular meetings. I don't think that's the reason for calling a flock a society. That's more like a group meeting but not necessarily a societal term.

Option J says they can't communicate. Again, they can communicate, but that's not the reason for the term.

So, putting it together. Option A seems to fit because each bird leads the flock, creating a hierarchy, which is a characteristic of a society. Option C might be stretching the definition, but it's possible. Alternatively, the term "society" in the context of birds is more about their social structure, leading to option A being the correct answer.

The correct answer is **A: Birds are called a society because each bird takes a turn leading the flock.**

**Explanation:** The term "society" in this context refers to a hierarchical structure where each bird, or "pecking order," leads the flock, reflecting the collective behavior and social dynamics among birds. 

**Answer:** A.
