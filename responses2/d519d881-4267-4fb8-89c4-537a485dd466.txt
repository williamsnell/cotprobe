Okay, so I have this question about Pascal's triangle. The question is asking for the second number in the row that has 43 numbers. Hmm, let me think about how Pascal's triangle works.

Pascal's triangle is built in rows, where each row starts and ends with 1. The numbers in between are the sum of the two numbers above them. So, for example, row 0 is just 1, row 1 is 1 1, row 2 is 1 2 1, and so on.

Wait, each row corresponds to a level, and the number of elements in each row is equal to the row number plus one. So, row 0 has 1 number, row 1 has 2, row 2 has 3, etc. That makes sense. So if a row has 43 numbers, then that row is row 42 because row 42 has 43 elements (since 42 +1 =43).

Wait no, wait. Let me check again. The number of elements in a row is n+1 where n is the row number. So row 0 has 1 element (0+1=1), row 1 has 2 elements, row 2 has 3 elements, up to row 42 which would have 43 elements. So the row we're interested in is row 42.

Now, the question is, what is the second number in that row. Well, each row starts with 1. So the first number is 1. The second number would be the next number in the row. Looking at the pattern, the row 42 is 1, 42, 1, 42, 1, etc. Wait no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, in Pascal's triangle, each row after the first has numbers that increase up to the middle and then decrease. So row 42 would be 1, 42, 43, 44, ..., up to 42, right?

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The elements of row n are the coefficients C(n,0), C(n,1), ..., C(n,n). So for row 42, the elements are C(42,0)=1, C(42,1)=42, C(42,2)= (42×41)/(2×1)=861, and so on, up to C(42,42)=1.

Wait, but the row would have 43 elements. So the first number is 1, the second is 42, the third is 861, and so on. So the second number is 42.

Looking at the options, option B is 1, C is 2, A is 42. So the correct answer should be option A:42.

The second number in the row of Pascal's triangle that has 43 numbers corresponds to the second element in row 42. Since Pascal's triangle's rows start with 1 and increase up to the middle, the second number is 42. 

Answer: A:42
