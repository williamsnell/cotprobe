Okay, so I've got this question about permutations and functions. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

Statement 1 says, "Every permutation is a one-to-one function." Hmm, okay. I remember that a permutation is a bijective function, which means it's both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). So, if a function is a permutation, it has to be injective. That would make Statement 1 true because every permutation is indeed a one-to-one function. So Statement 1 is correct.

Statement 2 says, "Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one-to-one." Wait, this sounds a bit tricky. Let me think. The "if and only if" means both directions. So, it's saying that a function is a permutation exactly when it's one-to-one. But wait, that's not correct. Because a permutation requires more than just being one-to-one. It also needs to be onto.

For example, consider a function that maps from the set {1,2} to {1,2,3}. If the function is defined as f(1)=1, f(2)=2, then it's one-to-one but not onto because 3 is not in the image. So this function is a function but not a permutation, even though it's one-to-one. Therefore, Statement 2 is false because not every one-to-one function is a permutation—it also needs to be onto.

So, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false.

Now, looking at the options, I need to see which one matches. Let's see:

Option D says "True, True" but that's wrong because Statement 2 is false. So D is out.

Option F says "True, True but Statement 2 is not the correct explanation." No, because Statement 2 is false, so F would be wrong.

Option G says "False, True but Statement 2 is not the correct explanation." No, because Statement 1 is true. So G is incorrect.

Option I says "False, True and Statement 2 is the correct explanation." Hmm, that doesn't fit because Statement 2 is false.

Wait, wait. Let me read the options again. Option E is "True, False." So that would match our conclusion: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. But wait, what about the explanation part?

The question says, "Statement 2 is the correct explanation of Statement 1." But if Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false, then that part can't be correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in evaluating Statement 2.

Wait, Statement 2: "Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one." Or wait, no, the wording is "if and only if it is one to one." No, no, the function being a permutation is equivalent to being a one-to-one function. Wait, that's not correct because a permutation requires being one-to-one and onto. So the equivalence is false.

So Statement 2 is false. So the correct answer is that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false. So the options that match this are E: True, False, and perhaps the explanation part.

Wait, the options are about whether the statements are true or false, and whether Statement 2 is a correct explanation of Statement 1. Since Statement 2 is false, it can't be the correct explanation. So the explanation part is incorrect.

Looking back at the answer options:

Option E says "True, False" and "Statement 2 is the correct explanation of Statement 1." Since Statement 2 is false, E is incorrect.

Wait, the user's options are a bit confusing. Let's look again at the question.

Options are for the correctness of the statements and whether Statement 2 is a correct explanation of Statement 1.

Wait, the initial question is whether Statement 2 is correct and whether it is a correct explanation of Statement 1. Let me re-examine the question.

The question is: "Statement 2 | Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one."

So, the question is about the truth of Statement 2 and whether it's a correct explanation of Statement 1.

So, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false.

Looking for an option where Statement 1 is true (and it's true) and Statement 2 is false. Let's see the options again.

Option E: "True, False" but the explanation part is "Statement 2 is the correct explanation of Statement 1." Since Statement 2 is false, that part is wrong. So E is incorrect.

Wait, what about option I? Option I says "False, True and Statement 2 is the correct explanation of Statement 1." Wait, that's not possible because Statement 2 is false. So I is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine Statement 2.

Statement 2: "Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one."

Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the logic. Statement 2 is claiming that a function is a permutation exactly when it's one to one. Which is false because a permutation requires being one-to-one and onto.

So Statement 2 is false. So the correct answer would be E (true, false) but then also whether Statement 2 is a correct explanation of Statement 1.

Wait, the question is about whether Statement 2 is a correct explanation of Statement 1. So if Statement 2 is false, then it's not a correct explanation. 

So when the answer is that Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, the only options that fit are E and others.

Looking at the options, E is "True, False." So E would be correct because in the question, the options are about the correctness of the statements and whether Statement 2 is the correct explanation.

Wait, but in the options, the first part is whether each statement is true or false. The second part is whether Statement 2 is the correct explanation of Statement 1.

So, the options like E: True, False, and "Statement 2 is correct explanation of Statement 1." But since Statement 2 is false, E would be incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's think about what each option says.

Option E: "True, False" and "Statement 2 is the correct explanation of Statement 1." So that would imply that Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, and Statement 2 is a correct explanation of Statement 1. But since Statement 2 is false, that last part is incorrect.

So E is incorrect.

Let me look at other options. Option B says "True, True" and explains. No, because Statement 2 is false.

Option D says "True, True," same as B.

Option A: "False, True." No, because both are false.

Option F: "True, True but Statement 2 is not the correct explanation of Statement 1." No, because Statement 2 is false.

Hmm. So none of the options match except perhaps if I made a mistake.

Wait, what's the possible answer? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about Statement 2. Let me reevaluate Statement 2.

Statement 2: Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one-to-one.

Wait, that's not correct. Because a permutation is a bijective function (both one-to-one and onto). So the condition is that a function is a permutation if and only if it's one-to-one and onto.

So Statement 2 is incorrect because it claims that being one-to-one is equivalent to being a permutation. But it's not, because you also need being onto.

So Statement 2 is false. So the answer should have Statement 1 as true, Statement 2 as false.

Looking at the options, only options E and others have that.

Wait, so which options have Statement 1 as true and Statement 2 as false? Let me check.

Option E: "True, False." So that's correct in that both are correct in their truth values.

But the second part of the option says, "Statement 2 is the correct explanation of Statement 1." Since Statement 2 is false, this part is incorrect. So E is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the options are in a different arrangement. Let me read the options again:

The options are:

A: False, True

B: True, True and Statement 2 is the correct explanation of Statement 1

C: False, False

D: True, True and so on.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the options. Let me read each option carefully.

The options are:

Option E: True, False, and Statement 2 is the correct explanation of Statement 1.

Wait, no. The structure is: each option is a pair where the first is a correct answer (T or F), and the second is a statement about statement 2 being a correct explanation of statement 1.

Wait, perhaps it's structured as:

Each option is a pair where the first part is whether the statements are true (e.g., Option E: "True, False") and the second part is whether statement 2 is the correct explanation of statement 1.

Wait, that's probably the case. So:

Option E says "True, False" and "Statement 2 is the correct explanation of Statement 1." But since Statement 2 is false, this second part is incorrect.

So the correct answer would have Statement 1 as true, Statement 2 as false, and the second part of the option (whether Statement 2 is a correct explanation) as incorrect.

Looking back at the options, which options have Statement 1 as true and Statement 2 as false.

Looking at the options:

Option E: True, False.

So the answer would be E if the second part is correct. But since Statement 2 is false, the second part is incorrect. Therefore, the correct option is E, but the explanation part is wrong. So E is not correct because the explanation is incorrect.

Wait, wait. Let me check the options again.

Another approach: which options have both statements correct as per their truth values.

Looking:

A: False, True – both statements are incorrect.

B: True, True – but Statement 2 is correct as per the options, but since Statement 2 is false, this is wrong.

Wait, no, the options like B say both are true, but Statement 2 is false.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate whether Statement 2 is false.

Yes, Statement 2 says that every function is a permutation if and only if it's one-to-one. Since a permutation requires being one-to-one and onto, Statement 2 is incorrect. So Statement 2 is false.

So the correct answer must have Statement 1 as true, Statement 2 as false.

Looking at the options, E is True, False. So the first part is correct.

But the second part of the option (whether statement 2 is a correct explanation) is incorrect because statement 2 is false.

So the options are structured as:

Each option is a pair where the first is a correct answer (T or F), and the second is a statement about statement 2 being a correct explanation.

So, if the correct answer is E: True, False, but the second part is incorrect, so the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option where Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, and the second part is correct.

Looking through the options, which have both statements correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's think about this again. I'm going to re-examine each option.

Option A: False, True. So both statements are incorrect, which can't be.

Option B: True, True. Statement 2 is also true, but that's incorrect because Statement 2 is false.

Option C: False, False. Both are false, so can't be.

Option D: True, True. Again, both are true, which is incorrect.

Option E: True, False. So Statement 1 is correct, Statement 2 is incorrect, but the second part of the option says Statement 2 is a correct explanation of Statement 1, which is wrong.

So the correct answer would have Statement 1 as true, Statement 2 as false, and the second part of the option (whether Statement 2 is correct) is incorrect. Therefore, none of the options match, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate Statement 2.

Statement 2 says: "Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one."

Wait, the 'if and only if' suggests that both directions are true. So, for all functions f, f is a permutation iff f is one-to-one. That's not true because for a function to be a permutation, it must also be onto. So the 'if and only if' is incorrect. So Statement 2 is false.

So the only options left are E and perhaps others where statement 2 is false.

Wait, perhaps the initial analysis is correct. So the correct answer is E: True, False, but the second part is incorrect. So E is the only option that has Statement 1 as true, Statement 2 as false, but the explanation is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about the explanation. So the answer should state that Statement 2 is the correct explanation of Statement 1.

But since Statement 2 is false, the explanation is incorrect. So the option E is incorrect because the explanation part is wrong.

Hmm, but perhaps I need to consider that the explanation is correct. Let me think: if someone claims that Statement 2 is a correct explanation of Statement 1, is that correct?

Well, Statement 1 is true because every permutation is a one-to-one function. So, if someone says that Statement 2 is the correct explanation of Statement 1, that would mean Statement 1 is true because Statement 2 is true and is the correct explanation. But Statement 2 is false, so that explanation is incorrect. Therefore, the answer's explanation part is wrong.

So, the correct answer is E, but the explanation is wrong. So the option E is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think about each option again.

Another approach: Let's list each option's correctness.

Option A: False, True.

Option B: True, True. But Statement 2 is false, so B is wrong.

Option C: False, False. Both are wrong.

Option D: True, True. Both correct, but this is wrong.

Option E: True, False. So this is correct in terms of the statements being true and false, but the explanation part is wrong.

Option F: True, True but explanation is incorrect. So in this case, the first part is correct, but the explanation is also incorrect. So F would be correct in terms of the statements, but the explanation part is wrong.

Option G: False, True but explanation is incorrect. No, both statements are wrong.

Option H: False, False but explanation is correct. No.

Option I: False, True and explanation is correct. No.

Option J: True, False and explanation is correct. No.

Wait, the only options left are E and F. Because E says the explanation is correct, F says explanation is incorrect.

But since Statement 2 is false, the explanation about it is incorrect. So the correct answer is E: True, False, but the explanation is incorrect.

So the correct option is E because both statements are correct (Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false), but the explanation (that Statement 2 is a correct explanation of Statement 1) is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the explanation part of option E is wrong. So the correct answer is E, but the explanation is incorrect. So the correct answer is E, but the option is also wrong because the explanation is incorrect.

Wait, but the way the options are structured: each option is a pair where the first element is a correct answer (T or F), and the second is a statement about statement 2 being the correct explanation of statement 1. So for example, E says both statements are correct, but the explanation is correct. So that's a problem because Statement 2 is false.

So, perhaps the correct answer is E, but the options are structured such that only E fits as the answer, but the explanation part is wrong.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The correct answer is E. Statement 1 is true because every permutation is indeed a one-to-one function. However, Statement 2 is false because not every function is a permutation—it must also be onto. The explanation in option E incorrectly states that Statement 2 is a correct explanation of Statement 1, which is not accurate. Therefore, the correct option is E, but the explanation part is incorrect. However, since the truth values of the statements match, E is the closest correct option.

ANSWER: E
