Question:

A steam pipe containing saturated steam at 100 psia is connected to an empty cylinder. What will be the final state of the steam if the cylinder is filled with steam at the same pressure as the pipe?

Options:

A: The steam in the container is condensed
B: The steam in the container is saturated
C: The steam in the container is at the same temperature as the reservoir
D: The steam in the container is subcooled
E: The steam in the container is in a vacuum state
F: The steam in the container is partially condensed with a liquid phase present
G: The steam in the container is slightly superheated
H: The steam in the container is at a higher temperature than the pipe
I: The steam in the container is at a lower pressure than the pipe
J: The steam in the container is highly superheated

Okay, so I'm trying to figure this question out. Let's see, the question is about a steam pipe connected to an empty cylinder. The pipe has saturated steam at 100 psia, and when the cylinder is filled with steam at the same pressure, what's the final state?

Hmm. So the pipe has saturated steam, which means the temperature in the pipe is the saturation temperature at 100 psia. Since the pipe is connected to the cylinder, the pressure inside should equalize. But wait, the cylinder is initially empty, so its initial pressure is low, like atmospheric pressure perhaps.

When you fill the cylinder with steam at the same pressure as the pipe, which is 100 psia, what happens? Well, the pipe's pressure is higher than the initial cylinder pressure. So the steam from the pipe can't just fill the cylinder completely because it's at a higher pressure. So the cylinder's pressure must rise until it reaches 100 psia. 

Wait, but the pipe's initial pressure is 100 psia. So the cylinder, which was under lower pressure, will start to fill as the pipe's pressure increases. Because the pipe is connected, the pressure will equalize. So the cylinder's pressure will end up at 100 psia, right?

Now, when a cylinder is filled with steam at a pressure lower than the pipe's initial pressure, the steam will start condensing. Because the pressure is higher in the pipe, the cylinder's vapor pressure is higher. So the steam in the cylinder (which is at 100 psia) will have to cool down to its saturation temperature, causing some of it to condense into liquid.

Wait, but the pipe's initial state is saturated. So when the cylinder is filled, the pressure in the cylinder is increased, so the vapor pressure in the cylinder increases. Since the pipe had saturated steam at 100 psia, the cylinder will have steam at 100 psia but will cool down to the saturation temperature of 100 psia, meaning it's saturated now.

So the final state of the cylinder's steam is saturated, right? That would be option B: The steam in the container is saturated.

But wait, what about the pipe? The pipe's pressure remains 100 psia, but maybe it cools down as well. Oh, but the question is about the cylinder's final state. So the cylinder's steam is saturated. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial pipe pressure is 100 psia. The cylinder's initial pressure is low, like atmospheric. So when the cylinder is filled, the pressure in the cylinder will rise until it reaches 100 psia. The steam in the cylinder then expands into the pipe. Since the pipe is at 100 psia, the cylinder's vapor will condense as it warms up to the saturation temperature. But wait, no, it's the opposite. No, when the pressure in the cylinder (the container) is lower than the pipe's pressure, the vapor condenses into liquid. But once the cylinder's pressure reaches the pipe's pressure, any further addition of steam would require the pipe's pressure to rise, but the pipe is fixed. So the cylinder's pressure will reach 100 psia, and any additional steam in the cylinder will be at the saturation temperature, so saturated.

So the final state of the cylinder is saturated steam at 100 psia. So the answer is option B.

The question involves a scenario where a steam pipe containing saturated steam at 100 psia is connected to an empty cylinder. The cylinder is then filled with steam at the same pressure (100 psia). The goal is to determine the final state of the steam in the cylinder.

Initially, the pipe contains saturated steam at 100 psia, meaning the temperature is the saturation temperature at that pressure. The cylinder, being initially empty, has a low pressure, likely atmospheric pressure. When the cylinder is filled with steam at 100 psia, the pressure in the cylinder increases until it reaches 100 psia, matching the pipe's pressure. At this point, the cylinder's steam will experience a pressure increase, causing some of the steam to condense into liquid. This process continues until the cylinder's pressure reaches the saturation temperature at 100 psia, resulting in a saturated state.

The pipe remains at 100 psia, but its temperature may adjust slightly to accommodate the increased pressure in the cylinder. The key point is that the cylinder's steam becomes saturated at the final pressure of 100 psia.

Based on this analysis, the final state of the steam in the cylinder is saturated.
