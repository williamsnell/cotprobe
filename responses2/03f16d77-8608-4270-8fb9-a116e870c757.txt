Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about conflict models and integration models. I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question asks about the emphasis on specific types of tensions in the development of state societies. It's divided into two parts: conflict models and integration models. 

I remember that conflict models often focus on the internal and external factors that create tensions within societies. Internal conflicts might include things like division within families or within communities. External conflicts could be things like political, economic, or social issues outside the state. So, the idea is that societies have internal tensions that lead to internal conflicts, which in turn contribute to external challenges.

Then, integration models probably look at how societies integrate with other groups. Integration models might stress internal and extrafamilial tensions. Internal integration is when different groups within a society work together, like within families or communities. Extrafamilial tensions might refer to conflicts between different social groups outside of family dynamics, maybe between different communities or between different social classes.

Looking at the options:

A: external; extrafamilial
B: interfamilial; extrafamilial
C: religious; military
D: internal; intrafamilial
E: external; internal
F: internal; external
G: socioeconomic; political
H: political; economical
I: extrafamilial; interfamilial
J: military; religious

Wait, the question states that conflict models emphasize external and integration models emphasize internal or something else. But I think I'm mixing up terms here. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says: Conflict models emphasize the importance of __________ tensions in the development of state societies, while integration models emphasize ____________ tensions.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the terms used in each model. In the context of state societies, conflict models (like those from the Thomas Piketty or various sociologists) often highlight internal and external factors. Internal conflicts arise within families or communities. External conflicts could be like inequality, political issues, or social movements.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me try to recall. Conflict models often focus on internal and external factors. For example, internal conflicts within families, and external tensions like inequality or political instability.

Integration models, on the other hand, might focus more on internal grouping or intra-group conflicts. Integration models often highlight that societies integrate internally, and maybe some extrafamilial tensions, like between different social groups.

Wait, maybe the options are structured as: Conflict models emphasize internal and external, while integration models emphasize internal and something else. Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, looking at the options, which ones are correct. Let's consider each option:

Option B: "intervention; extrafamilial." Wait, no, that's not right.

Option F: internal; external. So, conflict models emphasize internal and external.

Wait, no, the question says conflict models emphasize internal tensions, and integration emphasizes external? Because the question starts with "Conflict models emphasize the importance of __________ tensions... while integration models emphasize ____________ tensions."

Wait, no, the question says the first blank is about conflict models and the second about integration. So, the first is conflict, the second is integration.

So, for conflict models, I think the emphasis is on internal and external. Or maybe internal and external. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I remember that in some models, like the Thomas Piketty's decomposition, he talks about social class structures and how they create internal and external tensions. Internal class tensions could be within families or communities, while external class tensions might be inequality, social movements, etc.

But integration models, perhaps they focus on the internal cohesion and grouping of different social units. Like, society integrates internally, and maybe there's some intra-group conflict, which could be considered as extrafamilial.

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: Conflict models (the first part) emphasize internal and external tensions. Integration models (second part) emphasize internal and extrafamilial tensions.

Looking at the options, option J is military and religious. Not useful.

Option F: internal and external. So, conflict models emphasize internal and external. Integration models, perhaps, emphasize internal and extrafamilial.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: think of each model's focus.

Conflict models (like those focusing on class structures) emphasize internal class tensions and external class tensions. So, internal (class inequality within families or communities) and external (class issues, inequality, etc. between different social classes).

Integration models, on the other hand, focus on how societies group together. They might say that integration is internal, and perhaps there's some intra-group conflict, which could be considered as extrafamilial. Or maybe the integration model emphasizes the internal grouping and the extrafamilial (like between different social groups) conflicts.

Wait, another thought: the two models might have the first part as internal and the second as external. Or the first as internal and the second as internal, or something else.

Wait, let me look up the standard terms. Wait, I can't actually look things up, so I have to rely on my memory.

I think that in the context of state societies, conflict models (the traditional ones) focus on internal class and social class tensions, as well as external societal tensions. Integration models, on the other hand, focus on the social integration within the state—how people group together—and perhaps the extrafamilial tensions, meaning conflicts between different social groups beyond family ties.

Alternatively, some sources say that integration models emphasize internal and extrafamilial tensions, while conflict models emphasize internal and external. Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, I think I need to find the correct answer. Let me try to think about the options again.

The options are:

A: external; extrafamilial

B: interfamilial; extrafamilial

C: religious; military

D: internal; intra-familial

E: external; internal

F: internal; external

G: socioeconomic; political

H: political; economical

I: extrafamilial; interfamilial

J: military; religious

So, the question is, for conflict models, which part are they emphasizing? The question structure is:

Conflict models emphasize __________ tensions.

Integration models emphasize ____________ tensions.

So, for conflict models, the first blank is the focus. Integration models, the second.

I think conflict models focus on internal and external. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I found a note once that said that conflict models look at internal and external tensions, while integration models focus on internal group divisions and other group-related tensions.

So perhaps, the conflict models emphasize internal and external.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me see. Let's see the options:

Option F: internal; external.

So, conflict model's first blank: internal.

Integration model's second blank: external.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the conflict models emphasize internal and social class tensions, while integration models emphasize internal and extrafamilial.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the correct answer.

Another approach: think about the terms. Internal and external are often used together in conflict models. Integration models might focus more on internal and perhaps intra-group (extrafamilial) tensions.

Wait, another thought: the conflict models often stress internal and external factors contributing to societal tensions, leading to instabilities. Integration models focus on how societies group together and the internal cohesion, as well as any conflicts that might arise between different groups.

So, for integration models, the second blank is between the two models. So, integration models emphasize internal and extrafamilial tensions.

Wait, let me look for the correct answer. The question is about conflict models emphasizing internal/external, while integration models emphasizing internal/extrafamilial.

Looking at the options, option F is internal; external. So, conflict models emphasize internal, integration emphasizes external.

Wait, but that can't be right because integration models are about group cohesion.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J: military and religious. But that doesn't fit.

Wait, no, because option J is military and religious. That's about different types of tensions, not about internal or external.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F: internal and external.

Alternatively, another approach: let's think about what each model's focus is.

Conflict models (like those by Thomas Piketty) probably focus on class structures and social class differences, so internal class tensions (within families or communities) and external class tensions (like inequality, social movements, etc.).

Integration models, on the other hand, might focus more on how societies group together (internal cohesion) and perhaps the intra-group conflicts, which could be considered as extrafamilial.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another possibility: internal and extrafamilial.

Wait, let's see which options match this.

Option F: internal; external.

Option J: military and religious.

So, if conflict models focus on internal and external, and integration models focus on internal and extrafamilial, then the correct answer would be F.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: Let's think about the standard terms. The traditional models I've heard of are the ones that split internal and external. Integration models, perhaps, focus on internal cohesion and maybe some intra-group tensions beyond family.

Wait, I found a source before that says:

In conflict models, the focus is on internal and external tensions.

In integration models, the focus is on internal group cohesion and intra-group tensions.

So, conflict models emphasize internal (within groups) and external (outside groups) tensions.

Integration models emphasize internal group cohesion and intra-group tensions.

Wait, this is getting me more confused. Let's see.

So, for integration models, the first part (the first model's focus) is internal, and the second part (the second model's focus) is intra-group.

So, the first blank (for conflict models) is internal, the second blank (for integration models) is intra-group.

Looking at the options:

Option D: internal; intra-familial.

Option F: internal; external.

Option J: military and religious.

Option D: conflict models emphasize internal, integration models emphasize intra-familial.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought.

Alternatively, perhaps the integration models focus on internal group cohesion and perhaps some extrafamilial tensions.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the answer.

The question is:

Conflict models emphasize __________ tensions in the development of state societies, while integration models emphasize ____________ tensions.

So, for conflict models, the first blank is about what they focus on. Integration models focus on what they do.

So, for conflict models, the first blank is internal and external.

Integration models focus on internal and extrafamilial.

Wait, but the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option F: internal; external.

So, conflict models emphasize internal and external.

Integration models emphasize internal and external.

That can't be right because integration is about group cohesion.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Maybe conflict models focus on internal and external, while integration models focus on internal and intra-group (extrafamilial). So, the four options I'm looking at are:

F: internal; external.

J: military and religious.

Wait, but the military and religious are about different types of tensions, not internal or external.

So, perhaps the correct answer is F: internal and external.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense for integration models, because integration is about group cohesion.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to recall from my studies.

In the context of social class structures, Thomas Piketty's decomposition of the distribution of income into internal class (within the family) and external class (between the family and the rest of society). So, conflict models emphasize internal and external class tensions.

Integration models, perhaps, focus on the group cohesion within society. So, when societies group together, they have internal cohesion, and any conflicts between different groups (like different classes) are considered as extrafamilial.

So, for integration models, the second blank is extrafamilial.

So, the conflict models emphasize internal and external, integration models emphasize internal and extrafamilial.

Looking at the options, option F is internal; external.

Wait, but that's conflicting because the integration model would be internal and extrafamilial. So, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but option F says internal; external. So, conflict models emphasize internal and external. Integration models emphasize internal and extrafamilial. So, that would fit.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because integration models are about group cohesion. Integration models probably focus on internal group cohesion and perhaps some intra-group conflicts.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the correct answer is F.

But I'm not 100% sure. Another way is to look for the correct answer as F, which is internal; external.

So, for the conflict model, they focus on internal and external, while integration models focus on internal and extrafamilial.

So, I think the correct answer is F.
</think>

The question asks about the emphasis of conflict and integration models on specific types of tensions in state societies. Conflict models typically emphasize internal and external tensions, while integration models focus on internal group cohesion and intra-group tensions. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option F (internal; external):** This aligns with the understanding that conflict models emphasize internal class and social class tensions, while external societal tensions. Integration models, on the other hand, focus on internal group cohesion and intra-group conflicts, which can be considered as extrafamilial tensions.

Thus, the correct answer is **F: internal; external**.

ANSWER: F
