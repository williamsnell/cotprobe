Question:

You have a coin and you would like to check whether it is fair or biased. More specifically, let $\theta$ be the probability of heads, $\theta = P(H)$. Suppose that you need to choose between the following hypotheses: H_0 (null hypothesis): The coin is fair, i.e. $\theta = \theta_0 = 1 / 2$.

E: 0.95
F: 0.001

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the P-value for this coin toss problem. Let's see, the question says that we have a coin, and we want to check if it's fair or biased. The setup is that H0 is that the coin is fair, so theta equals 1/2. H1 is that the coin is not fair and theta is greater than 1/2. We tossed the coin 100 times and got 60 heads. The question is asking for the P-value.

Hmm, right. The P-value is the probability of observing a result as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. So in this case, since H0 is theta=0.5, we need to calculate the probability of getting 60 or more heads in 100 tosses, if the coin is fair.

Wait, but wait, H1 is that theta is not equal to 1/2, but specifically greater than 1/2. But since we're calculating the P-value for H0, regardless of H1. Oh, right, because the P-value is the probability of the data under H0. So I don't need to consider H1 when calculating P-value here.

So the setup is a binomial distribution. Each toss is a Bernoulli trial with p=0.5 under H0. We have n=100 trials, and we observed X=60 successes (heads). The P-value is P(X >=60 | H0).

Wait, but for a binomial distribution, calculating P(X >=60) can be a bit tricky because the exact calculation might require summing up a lot of terms. Maybe I can approximate it using the normal distribution because n is large (100), and the conditions for the normal approximation (np and n(1-p) both greater than 5) are met. Because 100*0.5=50, which is way more than 5, so that's good.

So, let's compute the z-score. The formula is z = (X - np0) / sqrt(np0(1-p0)).

Wait, but wait, what's the alternative? Since H0 is theta = 0.5, the expected number of heads is 50. So, X=60. So, the deviation is 10 (60-50=10). The standard deviation is sqrt(100 * 0.5 * 0.5) = sqrt(25) =5.

So, z = (60-50)/(5) = 2.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the alternative hypothesis is theta > 0.5, so since we're calculating the P-value, we're interested in the probability that the sample proportion is at least as large as 0.6 (since 60/100=0.6). But perhaps in the normal approximation, it's better to compute the probability that Z >= 2, right? Wait, but wait, in a binomial distribution, the P-value is the probability that the number of heads is 60 or more. So, using the normal approximation, it's the probability that Z >= (60 -50)/5 = 2. So, the area under the standard normal curve to the right of z=2.

Wait, I remember that z=2 has a cumulative probability of about 0.9772 for the left tail. So, the right tail is 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228, approximately 0.023. But wait, looking at the options, option C is 0.023, which matches this. But wait, am I certain that it's a two-tailed test? No, because H1 is theta > 0.5, so we're only dealing with one tail. So the P-value would be the probability of getting 60 or more heads, which is the upper tail beyond z=2.

But wait, I think the exact calculation might be necessary here because the normal approximation might be less accurate for such a small p-value. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact binomial probability. Let me think. But 100 trials is a lot, and computing the exact binomial for 60 is going to be time-consuming without a calculator, right?

Alternatively, perhaps using the normal approximation is acceptable, especially if the sample size is large enough. But perhaps the exact binomial is better. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the normal approximation.

Wait, the question is about the P-value, which is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as or more extreme than the observed value, assuming the null hypothesis is true. So if we're using the normal approximation, it's correct to say that the z-score is 2, leading to a P-value of approximately 0.0228, which is about 0.023, so option C. But wait, wait, I'm a little confused because I thought the normal approximation for one-sided tests is done correctly.

Wait, another approach: the exact binomial probability for X=60. So, perhaps using the binomial formula would give a more accurate P-value. The formula for the binomial probability is the sum from k=60 to 100 of C(100, k) * (0.5)^100. But that's a lot of terms to calculate. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the binomial coefficient and the approximation for large n.

Wait, but 100 choose 60 is a big number, but perhaps for the purposes of this problem, since it's a multiple-choice question and the normal approximation gives an answer in the options, perhaps the expected answer is C: 0.023.

Wait, but wait, what if I consider that the question is using the exact binomial distribution? Then, the calculation would have to be done more carefully. Let me think: since 100 is a big number, perhaps I can use the normal approximation. But maybe the exact calculation can be approximated using the normal distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps using the z-score method is sufficient.

Wait, but the exact binomial calculation might not be trivial. Let me think, perhaps using the normal approximation is acceptable for the purpose of this problem, given the options presented.

So, the steps are:

1. Calculate the expected number under H0: mu = n*p0 = 100 * 0.5 =50.

2. The observed is 60, so deviation is 10 (60-50).

3. Standard deviation is sqrt(100 *0.5*0.5) =5.

4. The z-score is (60-50)/5=2.

5. So, the P-value is the probability that Z >=2, which is about 0.0228, so 0.023.

So the correct answer would be option C: 0.023.

But wait, let me check another way. The exact binomial probability for X=60 can be calculated, but I'm not sure how quickly. But given the options, 0.023 is the one that fits.

Wait, what if I consider that the question expects the exact binomial calculation. Let me think: the exact probability that X >=60 when n=100 and p=0.5 is the sum from 60 to 100 of C(100, k) *0.5^100.

But that's a lot to calculate manually. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator or formula.

But perhaps using the normal approximation is acceptable, as it's a standard method.

So, the conclusion is that the P-value is approximately 0.023, option C.

To determine the P-value for the given hypothesis test, we start by noting that the null hypothesis \( H_0 \) states that the coin is fair (\( \theta = 0.5 \)), while the alternative hypothesis \( H_1 \) suggests the coin is biased towards heads (\( \theta > 0.5 \)). We observed 60 heads out of 100 tosses.

The P-value is the probability of observing 60 or more heads (i.e., \( X \geq 60 \)) under the null hypothesis. Using the normal approximation for large \( n \) (100 in this case), we calculate the z-score:

\[
z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{60 - 50}{\sqrt{100 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5}} = \frac{10}{5} = 2
\]

The P-value corresponds to the probability that \( Z \geq 2 \) under the standard normal distribution, which is approximately 0.0228 or 0.023. This aligns with option C.
