Okay, so I have this question here about calculating the effective annual yield of a bank account. Let me read it carefully.

The question says the account pays 7% interest, compounded daily. I need to find the effective annual yield. Oh wait, effective annual yield is the actual return on an investment after accounting for the effects of compounding. So, it's the effective rate that would give the same return as the nominal rate with compounding.

The formula for effective annual yield when interest is compounded daily is (1 + nominal rate / number of compounding periods) raised to the number of periods minus 1. So the formula is:

Effective Rate = (1 + (r / m))^m - 1

Where r is the nominal annual interest rate, and m is the number of compounding periods per year. Since it's daily compounding, m is 365.

So plugging in the numbers, r is 7%, which is 0.07 as a decimal. m is 365. Let me compute this step by step.

First, divide 0.07 by 365. That gives me 0.07 / 365 ≈ 0.00019178.

Next, add 1 to that: 1 + 0.00019178 ≈ 1.00019178.

Now, I need to raise this to the power of 365. Hmm, that's a big exponent. I remember that for small numbers, we can use the approximation (1 + x)^n ≈ e^(n*x), where e is the base of natural logarithms. But wait, maybe I should just compute it more directly or use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for effective annual rate. Let me think, since 7% is a relatively small rate, but compounded daily, it's going to be a bit higher than 7%.

Wait, I think I can calculate it more accurately. Let me try to compute (1 + 0.07/365)^365.

Hmm, but doing this manually would be tedious. Alternatively, I can recall that the effective annual rate can be calculated as:

Effective Rate ≈ (1 + 0.07/365)^365 - 1.

I think I can approximate this. Let me compute 0.07/365 first. 0.07 divided by 365 is approximately 0.00019178.

So 1.00019178 raised to 365. Let me think about how to compute this.

I think the formula for (1 + r/m)^(m) can be approximated using the formula for compound interest. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for effective annual rate when m is large.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate it more accurately. Let me try to compute ln(1 + r/m) first and then multiply by m to get the effective rate.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the effective annual rate using the formula:

Effective Rate = e^(r) - 1, but that's when r is the nominal rate. Wait, no, that's when it's compounded continuously. So for daily compounding, it's not continuous.

Wait, no, let me correct that. The correct formula for effective annual rate is (1 + r/m)^m - 1.

So let me compute (1 + 0.07 / 365)^365.

Let me compute 0.07 / 365 first. 0.07 divided by 365 equals approximately 0.00019178.

Now, 1.00019178^365. Hmm, I can use logarithms or maybe a calculator, but since I'm doing this manually, let's think of it in terms of exponentials.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for continuous compounding, but that's not this case. So perhaps I can compute it using a series expansion or a better approximation.

Alternatively, I can note that the effective annual rate for a nominal rate compounded m times a year is (1 + (r/m))^m - 1.

So let me compute (1 + 0.07/365) = 1.00019178.

Now, raising this to the 365th power.

Hmm, I remember that (1 + x)^n ≈ e^(n*x) when x is small. Let me check that. Let me compute 0.00019178 * 365.

0.00019178 * 365 = 0.07 (exactly, because 0.00019178 * 365 = 0.07). So e^(0.07) is e^0.07 ≈ 1.0725. Wait, but wait, in this case, (1 + x)^n with x being small, the approximation is (1 + x)^n ≈ e^(n x) = e^r.

Wait, but that would be e^0.07 ≈ 1.0725, so the effective rate would be 7.25%? But wait, that can't be right because 7% compounded daily should give a higher effective rate than 7%.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: the formula is (1 + r/m)^m.

So, if r is 7% (0.07), m = 365.

So, (1 + 0.07/365)^365.

I can compute this using the formula for effective annual rate. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation that for small x, (1 + x)^n ≈ e^(n x). Let me compute 0.07/365 = 0.00019178. Then n x = 365 * 0.00019178 ≈ 0.07. So e^0.07 ≈ 1.0725. So the effective rate is approximately 7.25%. But I thought earlier that the effective rate would be a bit higher than 7%.

Wait, but wait, another approach: perhaps the effective rate isn't exactly 7.25% because it's (1 + 0.07/365)^365, which is a bit more than e^0.07.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it step by step.

Let me think, perhaps using the formula for effective rate.

The effective annual rate is (1 + 0.07/365)^365 - 1.

So, let's compute this step by step.

First, 0.07/365 is 0.0001917808219178.

We'll compute this 365 times, but that's impractical.

Alternatively, using the formula for effective annual rate when compounded daily:

Effective Rate = (1 + 0.07/365)^365 - 1.

I can compute this as:

(1 + 0.07/365) = 1.0001917808219178.

Now, 1.0001917808219178^365.

Let me compute this using logarithms.

Take natural log of 1.0001917808219178.

ln(1.0001917808219178) ≈ 0.0001917808219178 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x for small x).

Multiply by 365: 0.0001917808219178 * 365 = 0.07.

So, ln(effective rate) ≈ 0.07 → effective rate ≈ e^0.07 ≈ 1.072508.

So, the effective rate is approximately 7.2508%, which is about 7.25%.

Wait, but that seems high. Let me check with another method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the effective annual rate when compounded daily.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a more accurate calculation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the effective annual rate.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

Effective Rate = (1 + r/m)^m - 1.

So let's compute (1 + 0.07/365)^365 -1.

We can compute this using the calculator function. Let me approximate.

Compute (1.00019178082)^365.

Alternatively, using the formula, since 0.07 is the rate, and m=365, the effective rate is approximately:

(1 + 0.07/365)^365 = e^(365 * ln(1 + 0.07/365)).

Which is e^(365 * 0.00019178082) ) = e^(0.07) ≈ 1.072508.

So, the effective rate is approximately 7.25%. But wait, I remember that the effective rate for a 7% nominal rate compounded daily is 7.25%. But looking back at the options, option B is 7.12%, which is lower than 7.25%. So perhaps I've made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm not using the correct formula. Let me think again.

The formula for effective annual rate when compounding is done m times a year is:

Effective Rate = (1 + (r/m))^m - 1.

So, for r=7% and m=365, it's (1 + 0.07/365)^365 -1.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ln(1.00019178) ≈ 0.00019178. Let me check that.

Yes, since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ... for small x. So for x=0.00019178, x² is about 0.0000000368, which is negligible. So ln(1.00019178) ≈ 0.00019178.

So, 0.00019178 * 365 = 0.07, so e^0.07 ≈ 1.072508, so the effective rate is about 7.25%.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is 7.12%, which is lower than this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again: is it (1 + r/m)^(m) -1, or is it (1 + r/m)^m?

Wait, I think it's correct. Let me try to compute (1 + 0.07/365)^365.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Let's think about the actual formula for effective annual rate.

The effective annual rate is calculated as:

Effective Rate = (1 + (r / m))^m - 1.

So for r=7%, m=365.

So, (1 + 0.07/365) = 1.0001917808.

Compute this to the 365th power.

But doing this manually is tedious. Maybe I can approximate it using a calculator perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the binomial approximation for (1 + x)^n, where x is small and n is large. But I'm not sure if that's the most straightforward approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct effective rate is approximately 7.25%. Then looking at the options, option B is 7.12% and option C is 7.50%. So perhaps 7.25% isn't among the options, but let me see.

Wait, perhaps the question expects a more precise calculation. Let me compute it step by step.

Compute 0.07 / 365 = 0.0001917808219178.

Now, let's compute (1.0001917808219178)^365.

We can compute this using the formula:

ln(1.0001917808219178) ≈ 0.0001917808219178.

Multiply by 365: 0.0001917808219178 * 365 = 0.07.

So, e^(0.07) ≈ 1.072508.

Which would make the effective rate approximately 7.25%.

But the options are: A:7.18%, B:7.12%, C:7.50%, D:7.60%, E:6.95%, F:7.25%, G:7.30%, H:6.90%, I:7.00%, J:6.85%.

So option F is 7.25%, which would be the answer if the effective rate is approximately 7.25%. But wait, let me double-check because I'm getting a little confused.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for effective annual rate for daily compounding.

The formula is:

Effective Rate = (1 + (r / m))^m - 1.

So, for r=7%, m=365.

We can compute this as:

1 + (0.07 / 365) = 1.0001917808.

Then, raising this to the 365th power.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula for the effective annual rate when compounded daily, which is (1 + r/m)^m.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for (1 + r/m)^m:

(1 + 0.07/365)^365 = e^(365 * ln(1 + 0.07/365)).

Which is e^(0.07) ≈ 1.072508, so the effective rate is 7.25% (approx).

So, the effective annual rate is approximately 7.25%, which is option F.

Wait, but the options have option F: 7.25%. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, I thought maybe it's a bit higher. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for effective annual rate when interest is compounded daily.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula (1 + r/m)^m - 1 as the effective rate. So, 0.07 is the annual rate, m=365.

So (1 + 0.07/365)^365 -1 = [1.00019178]^(365) -1.

But 1.00019178^365 is approximately e^(0.07) which is e^0.07 ≈ 1.072508.

So, the effective rate is 0.072508, which is 7.2508%, so approximately 7.25%.

Thus, the correct answer is option F: 7.25%.

To calculate the effective annual yield (EAY) of a bank account that pays 7% interest, compounded daily, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Effective Rate} = \left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^m - 1
\]

Where:
- \( r = 7\% = 0.07 \) (nominal annual interest rate),
- \( m = 365 \) (number of compounding periods per year).

### Step 1: Compute the daily interest rate
\[
\frac{r}{m} = \frac{0.07}{365} \approx 0.00019178
\]

### Step 2: Raise the daily rate to the power of 365
\[
\left(1 + 0.00019178\right)^{365}
\]

### Step 3: Approximate using the natural logarithm
\[
\ln\left(1 + 0.00019178\right) \approx 0.00019178
\]
\[
\ln\left(\left(1 + 0.00019178\right)^{365}\right) = 365 \times 0.00019178 \approx 0.07
\]
\[
\left(1 + 0.00019178\right)^{365} \approx e^{0.07} \approx 1.0725
\]

### Step 4: Subtract 1 to find the effective rate
\[
\text{Effective Rate} = 1.0725 - 1 = 0.0725 \, (\text{or } 7.25\%)
\]

### Final Answer:
The effective annual yield of the account is approximately **7.25%**, which corresponds to option **F**.
