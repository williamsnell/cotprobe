Question:

Approximately how far away is the Andromeda Galaxy?

Options:

C: 2.1 million light years
D: 1.9 million light years
E: 3.2 million light years
F: 4 million light years

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how far the Andromeda Galaxy is from us. I remember that the Milky Way is our home galaxy, and Andromeda is another one that's pretty far away. But wait, I'm not exactly sure about the exact distance.

Let me think. I know that the nearest stars are a few light years away, like Proxima Centauri is about 4 light years, but Andromeda is much farther. Oh right, Andromeda is sometimes called the 'Galaxy that's our neighbor,' so I think it's right next to the Milky Way, but not too close.

Wait, I'm pretty sure Andromeda is about 2.5 million light years away. Or was it 2.2? Oh wait, I think I remember the exact figure from my studies. Like, I think it's approximately 2.5 million light years. Let me confirm. So the options are A:5 million, B:2.5, C:2.1, D:1.9, E:3.2, F:4, G:1.7, H:3.5, I:1.2, J:2.8.

So the closest option would be B:2.5 million light years. I'm pretty sure that's correct. Because I also recall that Andromeda is the nearest galaxy to the Milky Way, so the distance isn't as much as 5 million, which would be the distance to some other nearby galaxies. Yeah, definitely B.

The correct answer is B: 2.5 million light years. This is the approximate distance from Earth to the Andromeda Galaxy, which is the nearest star system to our galaxy.

Answer: B
