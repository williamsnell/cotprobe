Question:

A frameshift mutation is created when

Options:

A: a base pair is moved from one location in a gene to another
B: a codon's nucleotide sequence changes so that it calls for production of a different amino acid than the original one
C: telomeric sequences are removed from DNA
D: a base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene
E: a large portion of a chromosome is deleted
F: a gene is duplicated within the DNA sequence
G: a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that it no longer codes for any amino acid
H: a base pair is replaced with a different base pair in a gene
I: a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that it codes for the same amino acid
J: a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that instead of coding for a given amino acid it acts to terminate translation

Okay, let's try to figure out this question. So the question is about frameshift mutations and what happens when they occur. I remember that a frameshift mutation is a type of mutation that disrupts the reading frame of a gene. But wait, how exactly does that happen?

Frameshift mutations occur when there's a change in the number of base pairs, right? So the mutation must change a certain number of bases in a row. If the mutation causes the change in just one base, that's a point mutation. But if it's a larger chunk, like a few bases, that causes a frameshift. 

Looking at the options, option A says a base pair is moved from one location in a gene to another. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Wait, that's more like a rearrangement, like a translocation or inversion. Those are types of chromosomal rearrangements, not mutations that change the reading frame.

Option B says a codon's nucleotide sequence changes so it produces a different amino acid. That's a point mutation, not a frameshift. Because a point mutation changes a single base, which affects just one amino acid. But a frameshift would be a larger change. So B doesn't cause a frameshift.

Option C talks about telomeric sequences being removed. I'm not sure about this. Telomeres are at the ends of chromosomes, and they're involved in DNA replication, especially in the latter parts of the chromosome. If a mutation disrupts the telomere, it could cause issues, but I don't think that's the cause of a frameshift. It's more like a structural problem.

Option D: a codon's sequence changes so it doesn't code for any amino acid. That would be a frameshift causing a premature stop codon. Because it changes the reading frame, the protein would stop early. But wait, the question is about frameshift mutations, which are more about disrupting the reading frame than just creating a stop codon.

Option E: a large portion of a chromosome is deleted. That's a deletion mutation, probably more like a structural or indel mutation. But a frameshift is a specific type of indel. So E could be another type of mutation, but not specifically a frameshift.

Option F: a gene duplication. That would create extra copies of a gene, which could lead to duplication of proteins. But frameshift is a different phenomenon entirely.

Option G: a codon changes so it doesn't code for any amino acid. That's a frameshift causing a premature stop. So this is a frameshift mutation. But wait, option E is a deletion, which is a different issue.

Option H: a base pair is replaced. That's a point mutation. So H is more of a general base substitution, not necessarily a frameshift.

Option I: a codon changes to code for the same amino acid. That's a substitution mutation, but not a frameshift. It changes the amino acid but doesn't cause a frameshift.

Option J: a codon changes to code for a different amino acid. That's a point mutation, not a frameshift.

Wait, so let me recap. Frameshift mutations happen when a mutation changes a chunk of DNA that's more than one base pair. So the mutation must affect a stretch of the gene longer than one base. For example, a mutation that changes three consecutive bases (like a codon changing to something else) would cause the reading frame to shift, leading to a frameshift.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer must be either C or G or F. Wait, option G is about a codon changing to not code for any amino acid, which is a frameshift. Option C is about telomeric sequences being removed. I'm not sure if that's a frame shift scenario.

Wait, no, telomeric sequences are part of the DNA ends. If a mutation removes part of a chromosome's DNA, it's a deletion. But if it's a frameshift, the problem is in the middle of a gene.

Wait, option F is about gene duplication. If a gene is duplicated, that's a structural mutation. But frameshift is a mutation that affects a stretch of DNA, not duplicating a gene. So F is not the answer.

So the correct option is G. Because a frameshift mutation changes a codon to a new one that doesn't code for any amino acid. So the codon changes, disrupting the reading frame.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option F is about gene duplication. That wouldn't cause a frameshift.

So the correct answer is G: a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that it no longer codes for any amino acid. So the mutation changes the codon, leading to a frameshift, which stops the protein and causes a premature stop.

Alternatively, option C says telomeric sequences are removed. That's about DNA structure, but it's not a frameshift. So probably the correct answer is G.

A frameshift mutation disrupts the reading frame of a gene by altering a stretch of DNA longer than one base pair. This causes a frameshift in the codons, leading to a premature stop codon and a truncated protein. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect. A rearrangement like a translocation does not cause a frameshift mutation.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Point mutations affect a single base pair and do not cause a frameshift.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Telomeric sequence removal is unrelated to frameshift mutations.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. A frameshift causes a premature stop codon, not just a change in amino acids.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. A large deletion of a chromosome could cause structural issues but is not a frameshift mutation.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Gene duplication is a structural mutation unrelated to frameshift.
- **Option G**: Correct. A codon change disrupting the reading frame causes a frameshift, leading to a premature stop.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. A base pair replacement is a point mutation.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. A codon change that codes for the same amino acid is a substitution mutation.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. A codon change to a different amino acid is a point mutation.

The correct answer is **Option G**, as it describes a frameshift mutation caused by a codon change disrupting the reading frame.
