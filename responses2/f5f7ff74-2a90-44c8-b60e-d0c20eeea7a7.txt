Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Theodorus's theory of justice. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question states: "The statement is made by: [statement]." The options are A through J, each associated with a different person. I remember that Theodorus was involved in legal theory, especially in the British realm.

I think Theodorus developed a moral philosophy, maybe something like the Talmud but adapted it. I recall that he argued that justice is about the rightness of the action, not necessarily the state of things. So his main idea is about the principle of justice being based on the truth of the consequences, not the state of affairs. This idea is crucial because it contrasts with other legal thinkers like Bentham or Mill, who might focus more on consequences after action.

Looking at the options, I remember that Theodorus is often cited as the author of Theodorus' Law. He was associated with the British Empire, so I should look for a term related to the British Empire. The options include things like Roscoe Pound, which I think was associated with the British Empire. Let me think: Roscoe Pound was a lawyer and perhaps a mentor to Theodorus. He's connected to the idea of Theodorus' Law, which is about the truth of consequences.

So the correct answer should be E: Roscoe Pound because he was a significant figure in Theodorus' legal theories, especially the one that influenced the Talmud. All the other names don't fit as well. For example, Dworkin was a philosopher, H.L.A. Hart was a moral philosopher, and so on. Theodorus is specifically the one who developed the concept.

The correct answer is E: Roscoe Pound, as he was the one who developed Theodorus' Law, which emphasizes the principle of justice based on the truth of the consequences.

Answer: E
