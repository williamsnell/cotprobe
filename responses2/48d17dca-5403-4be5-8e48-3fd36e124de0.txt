Question:

Assume that A. T. Hun's marginal propensity to save = marginal propensity to consume. If he makes an extra $1000 this year, and this increase in his income does not changehis marginal propensities, how much of this $1000 willMr. Hun save?

Options:

A: $800
B: $1000
C: $100
D: $300
E: $200
F: $750
G: $600
H: $400
I: $250
J: $500

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about marginal propensities to consume and save. It says that A. T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume. So, both are equal. If he makes an extra $1000 this year, and the increase in his income doesn't change his marginal propensities, how much of that $1000 will he save?

Hmm. I remember that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) plus the marginal propensity to save (MPS) equals 1. So, if they're equal, each must be 0.5 because 0.5 + 0.5 = 1. So, MPC = 0.5 and MPS = 0.5.

Now, the question is about how much he'll save on this $1000 increase. Since MPC is 0.5, he'll save half of it. So, 0.5 * $1000 = $500. Wait, but wait, I should think about how this applies to savings over multiple years. Because each year, his marginal propensity to save would affect how much he saves each year.

Wait, but the problem says that the increase in income doesn't change the marginal propensities. So, he doesn't have any MPC or MPS that change. That means each year, he saves 50% of his income. So, if he makes $1000 more this year, he saves half, which is $500. So the correct answer should be $500. Looking at the options, J is $500.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Suppose he earns $1000 more. With an MPC of 0.5, he'll save 50% of that. So, $1000 * 0.5 = $500. So the answer is J.

Alternatively, if the MPC was higher, he'd save more, but here it's exactly half. So the correct answer is J: $500.

The correct answer is J: $500.
