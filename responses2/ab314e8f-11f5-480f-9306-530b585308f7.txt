Okay, so I've got this bond question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that a bond yields 5% interest and pays annual interest of $2.50. I need to find the face value of the bond from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that the yield to maturity is the return an investor would receive if they hold the bond until it matures. For a bond, the yield is calculated using the formula: 

Yield = (Annual Interest Payment / Face Value) * 100%

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Is the yield the current yield or the yield to maturity? Oh, right, in this context, since it just says "yields 5%", I think it's referring to the current yield, not the total yield to maturity. So the current yield formula is correct: Current Yield = (Interest Payment / Face Value) * 100%.

Wait, but I should double-check. So if the yield is 5%, that's the annual return based on the current price. So the formula should be 5% = (2.50 / Face Value) * 100. Oh wait, no. Wait, that can't be right because if I have 5% = (2.50 / F) * 100, then solving for F would give F = 2.50 / 0.05. That would be 50, so face value is $50. But looking at the options, option D is $50, which would be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. If the yield is 5%, that's the annual interest rate. So the interest payment is 5% of the face value. So the formula is 2.50 = 0.05 * F. So F = 2.50 / 0.05 = 50. So the face value is $50, which is option D. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes people get the yield to maturity mixed up with current yield. Let me think if the yield given is the current yield or the total yield.

The question says "yields 5% interest." I think that refers to the current yield, not the yield to maturity. So using the current yield formula is correct. Therefore, face value is $50, so the answer should be D.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes people calculate the yield as the annual interest divided by the current market price, which would be yield to maturity. But in this question, the wording says "yields 5% interest." That mentions the annual interest, so it's probably the current yield. So the answer is D, $50.

To determine the face value of the bond, we use the current yield formula. The yield is 5%, and the annual interest is $2.50. Rearranging the formula:

Face Value = Annual Interest / (Yield * 0.01)

Face Value = 2.50 / (0.05 * 0.01) = 2.50 / 0.0005 = $5,000.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake. Let me correct this. The correct formula for current yield is:

Current Yield = (Annual Interest / Face Value) * 100%.

Rearranging for Face Value:

Face Value = Annual Interest / (Current Yield / 100%).

So,

Face Value = 2.50 / (5% / 100%) = 2.50 / 0.05 = $50.

Therefore, the face value is $50, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
