Question:

A march was held to call attention to the fact that minorities are still disenfranchised from the electoral process. A congressional report revealed that in the certain parts of the country, only 42% of minorities eligible to vote were, in fact, registered. The report also indicated that certain states had residency laws restricting a person's right to vote. As a consequence, Congress enacted a statute that makes any law denying minorities the right to vote shall be deemed unconstitutional. This federal statute will most likely be upheld under which of the following constitutional provisions?

Options:

A: Twenty-sixth Amendment.
B: Tenth Amendment.
C: Eighth Amendment.
D: Seventeenth Amendment.
E: Twentieth Amendment.
F: Fourteenth Amendment.
G: Thirteenth Amendment.
H: Nineteenth Amendment.
I: First Amendment.
J: Fifteenth Amendment.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully.

The question is about a law enacted by Congress that makes any law denying minorities the right to vote unconstitutional. The question is asking under which constitutional provision this statute is most likely to be upheld. The options are from the 13th to the 20th Amendments.

Let me start by recalling what each of these amendments covers. 

The 13th Amendment, also known as the Separation of Powers Act, was passed in 1828. It states that the Congress can't tax nor spend money in a way that would infringe upon the rights of the people. Wait, no, actually, the 13th Amendment actually removed the power of the states' taxation to be used for federal purposes. But I'm not sure how that directly relates to voting rights here.

The 14th Amendment came later, in 1868. It's about equal protection under the law, specifically protecting against discrimination and unfair treatment under the law. So this relates to the rights of minorities, which is exactly what the question is about.

The 17th Amendment, passed in 1890, was about the voting rights of American Indians. It granted them the right to vote if they were at least 13 years old. But that's more specific and about a specific group, not the general minority.

The 19th Amendment, I think, was in 1920. It abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, ending the Jim Crow era. That's about the abolition of slavery, which is a different issue. The question doesn't mention slavery, so probably not this.

The 20th Amendment, passed in 1971, abolished federalist machine and other means of preventing the use of the federal government for purposes other than its constitutional obligation to the people. Hmm, not directly about voting rights.

The 26th is the 18th Amendment, which abolished slavery in the union territories of the United States. That's again about the abolition of slavery, so not relevant here.

Wait, the question is about the 14th Amendment. So the statute is making laws that deny voting rights unconstitutional. Since the 14th Amendment protects against racial discrimination and equal protection, any law that criminalizes or denies this is unconstitutional under the 14th.

So the law enacted by Congress is probably related to the 14th Amendment. Therefore, the constitutional provision that would likely uphold this statute is the 14th Amendment.

Looking at the options, the correct answer should be F: Fourteenth Amendment. That's option F.

The law enacted by Congress, which makes any law denying minorities the right to vote unconstitutional, is most likely upheld under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment protects against racial discrimination and equal protection under the law, directly addressing the rights of minorities. 

Answer: F
