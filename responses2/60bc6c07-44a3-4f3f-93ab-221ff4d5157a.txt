Question:

Which of the following statements is false?

Options:

A: The t-distributions have more area under the tails than the normal distribution.
B: The t-distributions are lower at the mean and higher at the tails, and so are more spread out than the normal distribution.
C: Like the normal distribution, the t-distributions are symmetric.
D: The t-distributions are the same as the normal distribution when the sample size is large.
E: The greater the df, the closer the t-distributions are to the normal distribution.
F: The 68-95-99.7 Rule does not apply to t-models.
G: The smaller the df, the better the 68-95-99.7 Rule works for t-models.
H: The t-distributions are only applicable when the data is normally distributed.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about t-distributions. Hmm, I need to figure out which statement is false. Let me think through each option.

The question is asking which statement is false. The options are A to H. I remember that t-distributions are similar to the normal distribution but have heavier tails, especially with smaller degrees of freedom (df). As the df increases, the t-distribution becomes more like a normal distribution.

Let's look at each option:

Option A: The t-distributions have more area under the tails than the normal distribution. That makes sense because t-distributions have fatter tails, so the area outside the tails is more. So A is true.

Option B: The t-distributions are lower at the mean and higher at the tails, and so are more spread out than the normal distribution. Wait, isn't the mean the same? So if t-distributions are more spread out, they have larger variance. So B says they are lower at the mean and higher at tails, which is correct. So B is true.

Option C: Like the normal distribution, the t-distributions are symmetric. Yeah, both distributions are symmetric around the mean. So C is true.

Option D: The t-distributions are the same as the normal distribution when the sample size is large. That sounds right. As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution. So D is true.

Option E: The greater the df, the closer the t-distributions are to the normal distribution. Yes, this is correct. More df means less spread in the tails, so closer to normal.

Option F: The 68-95-99.7 Rule does not apply to t-models. Wait, the 68-95-99.7 rule applies to normal distributions. T-distributions don't follow this rule because their tails are fatter. So F is correct.

Option G: The smaller the df, the better the 68-95-99.7 Rule works for t-models. Hmm, wait. When df is small, the t-distribution has more spread, so the rule (which assumes normality) is less accurate. So if the df is small, the t-models don't follow the 68-95-99.7 rule well. So G is a statement that says "smaller df, better rule." That would be incorrect. So G is false?

Wait, let me double-check. The 68-95-99.7 rule is for a normal distribution. The t-models have higher variance, so they don't follow the rule. So when df is small, the 68-... Rule doesn't apply. So G says "the smaller the df, the better the 68-95-99.7 Rule works for t-models." That's incorrect because with small df, t-models don't follow the rule. So G is the false statement.

Wait, but what about option F? The 68-95-99.7 rule doesn't apply. So F is correct. So the false statement is G.

The false statement is G. When the degree of freedom (df) is small, the t-models do not follow the 68-95-99.7 rule, making G incorrect.

Answer: G
