Alright, so I have this problem here about the Fibonacci sequence. The question is asking for the remainder when the 100th term is divided by 4. Hmm, okay. I remember that the Fibonacci sequence starts with 1, 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two. So, term 1 is 1, term 2 is 1, term 3 is 2 (1+1), term 4 is 3 (1+2), term 5 is 5 (2+3), and it goes on like that.

But calculating up to the 100th term sounds impossible because that's a really big number. There must be a pattern or a cycle that repeats when you take the Fibonacci numbers modulo 4. I think this is called the Pisano period. I remember something about Pisano periods being related to Fibonacci numbers modulo m.

So, to find the remainder when the 100th term is divided by 4, I can look for the Pisano period modulo 4 and see where 100 falls in that cycle. The Pisano period for 4 is the length after which the sequence of Fibonacci numbers modulo 4 starts repeating.

Let me try to find the Pisano period for modulo 4. Let's list out the Fibonacci numbers modulo 4:

Term 1: 1 mod 4 is 1
Term 2: 1 mod 4 is 1
Term 3: (1+1)=2 mod 4 is 2
Term 4: (1+2)=3 mod 4 is 3
Term 5: (2+3)=5 mod 4 is 1 (since 5-4=1)
Term 6: (3+1)=4 mod 4 is 0
Term 7: (1+0)=1 mod 4 is 1
Term 8: (0+1)=1 mod 4 is 1
Term 9: (1+1)=2 mod 4 is 2
Term 10: (1+2)=3 mod 4 is 3
Term 11: (2+3)=5 mod 4 is 1
Term 12: (3+1)=4 mod 4 is 0
Term 13: (1+0)=1
Term 14: (0+1)=1
Term 15: (1+1)=2
And so on.

Wait, looking at the terms, the sequence seems to repeat every 6 terms because after term 6 (which is 0), term 7 is 1, which is the same as term 1. Then term 8 is 1, same as term 2, and so on. So the Pisano period modulo 4 is 6.

That means every 6 terms, the pattern of Fibonacci numbers modulo 4 repeats. So the sequence of remainders when dividing by 4 is periodic with period 6.

So, to find the 100th term modulo 4, I can find where 100 falls in this 6-term cycle.

How do I do that? Well, I can divide 100 by 6 and look at the remainder. The remainder will tell me which position in the cycle the 100th term is.

Let me calculate 100 รท 6. 6*16=96, which is 16 cycles of 6, and 100-96=4, so the remainder is 4. That means the 100th term is the same as the 4th term in the cycle.

Looking back at the sequence I made earlier:

Term 1:1
Term 2:1
Term3:2
Term4:3
Term5:1
Term6:0

So the 4th term is 3. That means the 100th term mod 4 is 3.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way is to think about the Pisano period, which for m=4 is 6. So the sequence of Fibonacci numbers mod 4 repeats every 6 terms. So the 1st,7th,13th,... terms all have the same remainder, and the 2nd,8th,14th,... terms have the same remainder, etc.

So specific to the 100th term, which is 100 mod 6. 100 divided by 6 is 16 with a remainder of 4. So the 100th term corresponds to the 4th term in the cycle. Looking at that, it's 3.

Wait, but the options are letters. Let me check the options again:

Options:
A:7
B:1
C:4
D:5
E:6
F:9
G:0
H:2
I:3
J:8

So, 3 is option I. So the answer should be I:3.
</think>

The Pisano period for modulo 4 is 6, meaning the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 repeats every 6 terms. The 100th term corresponds to the 4th term in the cycle, which is 3. Thus, the remainder is 3.
