Question:

A 42-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 1 week after he passed a renal calculus. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the calculus showed calcium as the primary cation. Physical examination today shows no abnormalities. A 24-hour collection of urine shows increased calcium excretion. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?

Options:

A: Na+ –K + –2Cl− symport inhibitor
B: Alpha-adrenergic blocker
C: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
D: Osmotic diuretic
E: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
F: Na+ –Cl− symport inhibitor
G: Potassium-sparing diuretic
H: Beta-adrenergic blocker
I: Aldosterone antagonist
J: Calcium channel blocker

Okay, so I have this medical question here about pharmacotherapy for a patient with a renal calculus. Let's see what I remember about this topic.

The patient is a 42-year-old man who passed a renal calculus and now comes in for follow-up. The X-ray shows calcium as the primary cation. That makes me think of calculus stones, like kidney stones, which can be calcium or magnesium stones. But since calcium is the primary cation, maybe it's a high-strain stone like a renal calculus.

The physical exam shows no abnormalities, which means everything seems normal. But the urine shows increased calcium excretion. Oh wait, that's concerning because if the kidney is working fine, why would calcium be excreting more? Maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a high-strain calculus which can have issues with function, but the physical exam is normal. Hmm.

Wait, but why would the doctor think the kidney is faulty here? Maybe it's a calculus that's causing some fluid retention or something. So the patient might have some condition affecting the kidney's function, possibly due to the calculus.

The options given are about different pharmacotherapy methods. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Na+ –K + –2Cl− symport inhibitor. I remember that sodium and potassium are widely excreted by the kidney, and chloride is also a major one. Symport inhibitors block the movement of these ions out. So this might help if the patient is dehydrated, which could be a cause for increased excretion.

Option B: Alpha-adrenergic blocker. These drugs affect the release of hormones from the pituitaries, like releasing more adrenergic hormones. That would affect things like blood pressure and maybe heart rate, but I'm not sure how it affects ureters or urination. Maybe not directly relevant here.

Option C: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. This would reduce the conversion of carbon dioxide into bicarbonate, which can affect blood pressure. But again, not directly the cause of increased calcium excretion.

Option D: Osmotic diuretic. That reduces osmolarity by increasing water excretion. For example, in severely hypertonic solutions. But if the patient already has a calculus, which can cause fluid retention, maybe this isn't the best option.

Option E: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. These prevent the conversion of blood sugars into angiotensin III, which then affects blood pressure. Again, not directly related to calcium excretion.

Option F: Na+ –Cl− symport inhibitor. This would prevent the movement of sodium and chloride out of the kidney. If the patient has an increased excretion of sodium, this could help. But I'm not sure if that's the immediate issue here.

Option G: Potassium-sparing diuretic. That would reduce the amount of potassium excreted, which might help if the patient is dehydrated. Potassium is a major excreted ion, so if they're being removed more, maybe the patient is dehydrated.

Option H: Beta-adrenergic blocker. Same as option B, affects downstream effects, not directly related to ureuria.

Option I: Aldosterone antagonist. This would reduce the level of aldosterone, which affects blood pressure. Not directly related.

Option J: Calcium channel blocker. These drugs block the channels that let calcium out of the kidney. So if the primary cation is calcium, blocking the channels would reduce excretion. That makes sense because the calculus is calcium-rich.

So the patient's main issue is increased calcium excretion despite normal physical examination. Since the urine shows this, it's likely that the kidneys are not working optimally. But the calculus is high-strain, so maybe it's causing some functional problems.

If the primary cation is calcium, blocking the calcium channels would prevent it from being excreted, which could lower excretion levels. Or maybe it's a functional calculus that can't be removed by the kidneys. So the patient might be getting more fluid because of the calculus, leading to increased excretion.

So the appropriate treatment would be a calcium channel blocker, option J. That would directly prevent the stone from being excreted, reducing the excretion of calcium.

I think the answer is J.

The patient has a 42-year-old man with a renal calculus who has passed and requires follow-up. The calculus is calcium-rich (primary cation), and despite normal physical examination, urine shows increased calcium excretion. This suggests the kidneys may be functioning suboptimally. The options provided are evaluated as follows:

- **A: Na+ –K + –2Cl− symport inhibitor** could help if the patient is dehydrated, but the issue is with excess calcium excretion.
- **B: Alpha-adrenergic blocker** affects hormones and may not directly address urecretion.
- **C: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor** reduces blood pressure, not calcium excretion.
- **D: Osmotic diuretic** decreases osmolarity, unlikely to cause increased calcium excretion.
- **E: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor** affects blood pressure, not relevant here.
- **F: Na+ –Cl− symport inhibitor** could help if sodium and chloride are being excreted more, but the primary issue is calcium.
- **G: Potassium-sparing diuretic** reduces potassium excretion, which could help if the patient is dehydrated.
- **H: Beta-adrenergic blocker** affects downstream effects, not relevant.
- **I: Aldosterone antagonist** reduces blood pressure, not relevant.
- **J: Calcium channel blocker** directly blocks calcium excretion, addressing the primary issue.

The most appropriate treatment is **J: Calcium channel blocker**, as it prevents calcium from being excreted, helping to reduce the increased excretion observed.

Answer: J
