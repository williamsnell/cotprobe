Question:

Distinguish between the two types of proteins produced by ribosomes.

Options:

A: Structural proteins provide temporary cellular functions, while functional proteins provide permanent structure to cells
B: Structural proteins control cell activity while functional proteins are part of the cell protoplasm
C: Structural proteins catalyze chemical reactions while functional proteins are involved in the structure of the cell
D: Structural proteins are soluble in the cell while functional proteins are generally insoluble
E: Structural proteins are found only outside the cell, while functional proteins are exclusively found inside the cell
F: Structural proteins are only used for muscle contraction, while functional proteins are responsible for energy production
G: Structural proteins are part of the cell protoplasm and contribute to cell and body growth, while functional proteins control cell activity such as hormone production or nutrient metabolism.
H: Structural proteins are unable to catalyze any reactions, while functional proteins form the structural components of ribosomes
I: Structural proteins are synthesized from amino acids in the cytoplasm, while functional proteins are synthesized in the nucleus
J: Structural proteins are produced by free ribosomes, while functional proteins are produced by membrane-bound ribosomes

Okay, so I'm faced with this multiple-choice question about ribosome proteins. Let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that ribosomes are the sites where proteins are synthesized. But wait, what distinguishes the two types of proteins they produce? I think there are two main categories of proteins made by ribosomes.

From what I've studied before, ribosomes have two main types of subunits. The first type is the structural protein, and the second is the functional protein. The structural proteins are like the framework that holds the ribosome together, providing the structure for the ribosome. They're usually made from the coding regions of mRNA, right? So these are structural proteins and are involved in the cell's structure.

The second type of protein is the functional protein. These are the ones that do the actual job of doing the work. They're made from the non-coding regions of mRNA that are spliced out. So functional proteins are involved in the cell's functions, like protein synthesis, structural assembly, and dynamic processes like movement.

Let me look at the options to see which one matches this. 

Option A says structural proteins provide temporary functions, functional provide permanent. I think that's correct but I'm not sure if it's the best answer.

Option B talks about structural controlling activity, functional part of the protoplasm. That's a bit vague. I'm not certain about the exact distinction between structural and functional proteins.

Option C says structural catalyze reactions, functional structure. That's not right. Structural proteins are enzymes, like enzymes, whereas functional proteins are enzymes too, but they're for different things.

Option D: Structural soluble, functional insoluble. No, I don't recall that. Structural proteins are usually in the cytoplasm, and functional are in the nucleus, perhaps. Also, solubility might be a point of difference, but I don't think that's the main distinction between the two types of proteins.

Option E: Structural only outside, functional inside. Wait, no, both are inside the cell. I thought that both proteins are made inside, but maybe some are made in the cytoplasm and others in the nucleus. But the distinction between structural and functional is about their roles, not their location.

Option F: Structural for muscle contractions, functional for energy. That's a specific example, but the question is about the types of proteins, not specific functions.

Option G: Structural part of the cell protoplasm, functional control activity. That sounds correct. Structural proteins are in the cell's structure, part of the protoplasm, and functional proteins are the ones doing the work, like hormone production or nutrient metabolism.

Option H: Structural can't catalyze, but that's not true. Structural proteins can catalyze, like enzymes.

Option I: Amino acids in cytoplasm vs nucleus. That's right for ribosomes, like mRNA is in cytoplasm for translation, but that's the origin of the ribosome. The type (protein) comes from the mRNA, which is in the cytoplasm for the structural proteins, and the functional proteins come from the nucleus.

Option J: Ribosome made from free or membrane-bound. No, ribosomes are always membrane-bound.

So looking back, the correct answer should be G. Structural proteins are part of the cell protoplasm and contribute to growth, while functional proteins control activities like hormone or nutrient metabolism.

The correct answer is G. Structural proteins are part of the cell protoplasm and contribute to cell and body growth, while functional proteins control activities such as hormone production or nutrient metabolism.

**Answer: G**
