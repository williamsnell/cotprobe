Okay, so I have this question about alpha and beta particles emitted by atoms. Hmm, I remember that in chemistry, elements are made up of atoms, and when they emit particles, it changes their identity. 

Let me think. Alpha particles are positively charged, right? Oh wait, no, they're actually helium nuclei. So an alpha particle is a helium nucleus, which means it has a charge of +2. So when an atom emits an alpha particle, it loses two protons. Because protons are the positively charged particles in an atom. So if an atom loses two protons, what else changes?

Oh right, the number of protons affects the element. So the atomic number, which is the number of protons, decreases. So the element changes because each element has a specific number of protons. So for instance, if you emit an alpha particle from Carbon, it becomes Carbon-2 (which is helium), which is helium, so it's a different element.

Beta particles are a bit trickier. I think beta particles are high-energy electrons. Oh wait, noâ€”beta particles are actually high-energy electrons. So when an atom emits a beta particle, it loses a proton, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, beta decay is when a nucleus emits a beta particle, which is an electron. But how does that affect the nucleus? Well, when a beta particle is emitted, a neutron in the nucleus converts into a proton, which then leaves the nucleus, emitting a positron and an electron neutrino. So the atomic number decreases by one because the number of protons decreases by one. Wait, no, because when a neutron converts into a proton and an electron, the nucleus loses a proton (since a neutron becomes a proton and an electron is emitted). So the atomic number (protons) decreases by one, meaning the element changes.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. Let's take a specific example. Let's say we have Carbon-12, which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. If it emits an alpha particle (which is a helium nucleus, 2 protons and 2 neutrons), then it would have 6-2=4 protons left. So the new element would be Carbon-8. So the atomic number decreases by two, so the element becomes oxygen instead of carbon.

Now, when an atom emits a beta particle, what happens? So the beta particle is an electron. Let me think about the process. When a nucleus emits a beta particle, it transforms. Let me think: the beta decay process is when a nucleus emits an electron (beta particle) and an antineutrino. But the key point is that the atomic number decreases by one because the number of protons decreases. So if an atom loses a proton, its atomic number (which is the number of protons) decreases, so the element it becomes is different. For example, if you have tritium (3H), which has 1 proton, emits a beta particle and becomes Helium-3 (2He). So it's a different element.

Wait, another example: let's say a helium nucleus (He-4) emits a beta particle. So He-4 has 2 protons. Emitting a beta (which is an electron) would mean that a neutron converts into a proton, emitting a positron and a neutrino. So the resulting nucleus would have 1 proton (He-3?), wait no. Wait, He-4 has 2 protons. When it emits a beta particle, the number of protons decreases by one. So 2-1=1 proton. So the new element is hydrogen-1. So the atomic number decreases by one, so the element changes.

Wait, but in the case of beta minus decay, the parent atom emits a beta particle (electron) and a neutrino, and the daughter nucleus has one less proton. So the daughter is an isotope of the parent element, but the element has changed because the atomic number is different.

So going back to the question: the question is about any atom that emits an alpha or beta particle. So in both cases, the atomic number decreases. So the element changes because the number of protons (atomic number) is different. So the options to look at are options A, B, E, H, etc.

Looking at the options:

A: changes its atomic number but remains the same element. No, because if it changes atomic number, the element changes.

B: becomes an atom of a different element always. Wait, but what if the atom doesn't emit an alpha or beta? Or if it's a very heavy atom and emits something else? Hmm, no. Because in both alpha and beta decay, the element changes. Wait, but the question is about any atom that does emit either. So for example, beta decay would always change the element.

Wait, the question is not about all atoms, but any atom that does emit either. So in both cases, the element changes, because the atomic number decreases. So the element is different.

So looking at the options:

Option A: changes atomic number, element same. No, because element changes.

Option B: becomes different element always. So whenever an atom emits alpha or beta, the element changes. So yes. It becomes a different element.

Option E: becomes different element sometimes. So sometimes, as in beta decay, but not always. So that's not correct.

So the correct answer would be B, but hold on. Wait, wait. Wait, in the question, it's 'any atom that emits an alpha or beta particle.' So the atom must emit either. So in alpha decay, the atomic number decreases. So the element changes. So the element becomes a different element.

Wait, but option B says 'becomes an atom of a different element always.' So in all cases where the atom emits either alpha or beta, the element changes. Is that correct?

Wait, another thought: sometimes, like in beta decay, the element could change, but in alpha decay, it's always a different element. So if the atom emits an alpha, the element must change. If it emits a beta, the element must change as well. So the element becomes a different element each time.

So looking at the options:

Option B: becomes an atom of a different element always. That's correct.

What about option E: becomes a different element sometimes. That's not correct because in all cases where the atom emits either, the element must change. So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: changes atomic number but same element. No, because element changes.

B: becomes a different element always. Yes, because any alpha or beta decay causes the element to change. So the element becomes different, always.

C: remains same element and isotope. No. Because element changes.

D: becomes a different element with same atomic mass. No, because when you emit an alpha or beta, you lose protons. So atomic mass (Z + A) decreases. Wait, wait. Let me think: when you emit an alpha, the atomic number Z decreases by 2, so the mass number A (Z + N) would decrease by 2. So the mass number (A) goes down, but the element changes. So option D is not correct.

E: becomes different element sometimes. But in all cases, it's different. So E is incorrect.

H: may become an atom of a different element. So 'may' is correct, but always is the correct meaning. So H is not as precise as B.

So the correct answer is B.
</think>

When an atom emits an alpha particle or a beta particle, its atomic number decreases. This change in the atomic number results in a change of the element, as each element is uniquely defined by its atomic number (number of protons). Therefore, the atom becomes a different element. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The atomic number decreases, so the element changes.
- **B**: Correct. The atom becomes a different element always, as both alpha and beta decay cause a change in the atomic number.
- **C**: Incorrect. The element changes, so the atom is not an isotope.
- **D**: Incorrect. The atomic mass decreases, so the element changes.
- **E**: Incorrect. While the atom may become a different element, it always does so, not just sometimes.
- **H**: Incorrect. While the atom may become a different element, it always does so.
- **G**: Incorrect. The atom becomes a different element.
- **I**: Incorrect. The atom becomes a different element, not a different isotope.
- **J**: Incorrect. The atom becomes a different element.

The correct answer is **B**, as the atom always becomes a different element when it emits an alpha or beta particle.
