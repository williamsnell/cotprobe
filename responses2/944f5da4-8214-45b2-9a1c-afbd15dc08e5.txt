Alright, I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about cystic fibrosis mutations. Let me start by recalling what I know about this.

Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. The CFTR protein has a specific structure, and mutations can be various types. The question is asking about the most common type of mutation.

I remember that cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which includes a missense mutation. Missense mutations are changes in one allele of the gene that result in a protein that's not the same as the wild type. In this case, the CFTR protein is necessary for the proper functioning of the respiratory system, and its dysfunction leads to the characteristic wheezing and coughing associated with CF.

Wait, but are there other types of mutations that are common? I know that another type is a frameshift mutation, which can lead to a nonfunctional protein. But wait, isn't that more of a rare cause? Or is it more common?

No, wait, a frameshift mutation happens when a mutation occurs early in the protein, disrupting its structure, leading to a nonfunctional protein. But that's not a missense mutation. Missense mutations are more common because they change a single amino acid, which is easier to identify.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by a missense mutation in the CFTR gene. So the most common type of mutation would be a missense mutation.

Looking at the options, option D is a missense mutation. Option E is an insertion, which I think is less common, but not the most common. Option A is an inversion, which is a rearrangement of DNA that's less common than a substitution or insertion. Option B is substitution, which is a type of missense, but maybe not the most common.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the most common mutation. Missense mutations are more common than, say, a frameshift because they are easier to detect as they change a single amino acid.

So the correct answer should be D: a missense mutation.

The correct answer is D: a missense mutation. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a missense mutation in the CFTR gene, which changes a single amino acid, making it the most common type of mutation.

Answer: D
