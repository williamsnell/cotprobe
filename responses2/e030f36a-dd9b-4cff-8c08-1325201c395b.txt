Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a rocket ejecting mass and calculating its acceleration. Hmm. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says that in the first second of its flight, the rocket ejects 1/60 of its mass with a velocity of 6800 ft/s. And we need to find the acceleration. The options are given from A to J, all in f/s².

Wait, I remember that when dealing with rockets, especially in the context of motion, we usually use the principle of conservation of momentum or maybe some form of Newton's second law for variable mass systems. Oh right, because the rocket is ejecting mass, so its mass is changing over time, which complicates things.

Newton's second law for variable mass is F = d(mv)/dt. Since the mass is changing, variables are m and t. Let's think about the situation. The rocket is ejecting mass, so the mass is decreasing. But wait, is the mass changing due to the rocket losing mass while it's moving, or is it that the rocket's mass is variable because it's ejecting mass? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the problem as the rocket ejecting a certain mass over a time interval, so the mass loss is 1/60 per second? Or maybe the entire mass is instantaneously 1/60, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the problem says "ejects 1/60 of its mass with velocity of 6800 ft/s." So perhaps the mass loss rate is 1/60 per second?

Wait, the problem says "ejects 1/60 of its mass"—I think that implies that over the first second, it ejects 1/60 of its initial mass. So the mass loss rate is (1/60) per second. Wait, but that depends on the initial mass. Hmm, wait, let's read the question again. The first sentence says "ejects 1/60 of its mass"—so perhaps the mass loss is 1/60 of the initial mass. So, if the initial mass is M, then the mass ejected is M*(1/60). 

Wait, but then the rocket's mass at any time t would be M(t) = M - (1/60) * t * M_initial? No, wait, no. Wait, no. The problem says "ejects 1/60 of its mass"—so perhaps the mass lost in the first second is (1/60) of the initial mass. So mass ejected is (M_initial) * (1/60). So the mass lost is M_initial*(1/60), so the remaining mass is M_initial*(59/60). But wait, perhaps that's not the correct approach because I'm not given the initial mass. Hmm.

Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the rocket's momentum. The rocket's momentum is changing as it ejects mass. So the force on the rocket would be the rate of change of momentum. The change in momentum is the mass expelled times their velocity, but opposite in direction. So perhaps the force can be expressed in terms of the mass loss and the velocity.

Let me model this. Let's say the rocket's mass is m(t), and its velocity is v(t). But since it's ejecting mass, the mass is being lost. So, the mass lost per second is dm/dt = - (1/60) * m(t). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says "ejects 1/60 of its mass"—so perhaps in the first second, it ejects 1/60 of its initial mass. But without knowing the initial mass, how can we proceed? Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass loss is 1/60 of the initial mass, and the initial mass is M. So, after one second, the mass is M - (1/60 M) = M*(59/60). But that would mean the mass is decreasing linearly with time, but I think that's only if the mass is being lost at a constant rate. But wait, in the first second, the mass is 1/60 of the initial. So the mass loss rate is (1/60) M per second. Wait, no. Because the time is one second, so the mass lost is (1/60) * M. So, dm/dt = -(1/60) M. So the mass is M(t) = M - (M/60) t.

But perhaps the problem is assuming that the mass is being lost at a constant rate over the first second. So, the mass loss rate is (1/60) M per second. If that's the case, then the mass as a function of time is M(t) = M - (M/60) t.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the initial mass. So perhaps I need to find the acceleration at a certain point in time, say at t=1 second. So, perhaps I can find the acceleration at that time.

Wait, maybe I should think about the rocket's momentum. The momentum is m(t) * v(t). The force on the rocket is the time derivative of this momentum. So, F = d/dt [m(t) v(t)].

But since the mass is changing, we have to apply the product rule. So:

F = m(t) * dv/dt + v(t) * dm/dt.

But what's F? It's the thrust of the rocket. Wait, but the problem doesn't give any information about thrust. Hmm. So maybe that approach isn't helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the rocket's velocity is given, and the mass loss is over a time. So, perhaps the acceleration can be calculated using the change in velocity over the time interval.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the momentum change. Let's assume that the rocket ejects a mass delta_m in a time delta_t. The change in momentum is delta_m * v_e, where v_e is the exhaust velocity, but in this problem, the velocity given is 6800 ft/s, which is probably the velocity of the ejected mass. Wait, but is that the actual direction? Or is that the velocity relative to the rocket? Hmm, I think in this case, the rocket ejects mass with velocity 6800 ft/s. So, perhaps that's the velocity of the expelled mass relative to the ground or relative to the rocket? Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the velocity of the expelled mass relative to the ground. Or perhaps it's the velocity relative to the rocket. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me make sure I understand the setup.

Wait, the problem states that the rocket ejects 1/60 of its mass with velocity 6800 ft/s. So, perhaps the mass is moving at 6800 ft/s relative to the rocket? Or maybe relative to the ground. I'm a bit confused here. Oh wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the velocity is 6800 ft/s from the ground, meaning the ejected mass is moving at that speed. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the mass is ejected at a speed of 6800 ft/s, perhaps in the opposite direction of the rocket's motion, but that's not clear.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the change in velocity of the rocket over the time interval, but since the problem doesn't give the initial velocity, perhaps that's not directly applicable. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants to use the rocket equation, which relates the change in velocity to the exhaust velocity and the mass ratio. But since the question is about acceleration, which is the derivative of velocity, not the change in velocity, perhaps that doesn't apply directly.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of momentum. The problem gives the velocity of the expelled mass (6800 ft/s), so perhaps that's the exhaust velocity. But wait, if the mass is ejected at 6800 ft/s relative to the ground, then the rocket's velocity (v) and the mass's velocity (u) are in the same direction. So, when the rocket ejects mass, it's losing mass and its velocity increases. But I'm not sure how that would be modeled.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the rocket's momentum change. Let's consider that the mass is being lost with velocity u, which is 6800 ft/s. But wait, the question doesn't specify the mass's velocity relative to the rocket. Oh, wait, maybe it's relative to the ground. Hmm, that would affect how the momentum is calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity given is the speed of the mass relative to the ground, meaning it's the exhaust velocity. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the term "velocity of the mass" as the speed, not the velocity vector. But that doesn't make sense, because velocity has direction.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should proceed with the given information. Let's try another approach. Let's model the problem where the rocket ejects mass, so the mass is being lost. The mass lost per second is 1/60 of the initial mass M. So, the mass as a function of time is M(t) = M - (M/60) t.

The velocity of the rocket is v(t). The momentum of the rocket is P = M(t) * v(t).

The rate of change of momentum is dP/dt = M(t) * dv/dt + v(t) * dM/dt.

But wait, the mass is decreasing, so dM/dt is negative. So, dM/dt = - (M/60) per second.

Now, the force F is dP/dt. But what is the force acting on the rocket? It's the thrust, which is the force expelled by the rocket. So F = - (mass expelled per second) * v_exhaust, where the negative sign indicates that the thrust is opposite to the direction of motion. Wait, but v_exhaust is given as 6800 ft/s. So, F = -( (M/60) ) * (6800) ) = - (M * 6800 ) /60.

So, F = - (6800 M/60 ) = - 113.333 M ft/s².

Now, from Newton's second law, F = dP/dt, so:

- (6800 M /60 ) = M(t) * dv/dt + v(t) * (- M/60) )

But wait, M(t) = M - (M/60) t.

So, substituting M(t) into the equation:

- (6800 M/60) = [ M - (M/60) t ] * dv/dt + v(t) * (- M /60 )

We can rearrange this equation to solve for dv/dt, which is the acceleration a(t).

But wait, the variables are getting complicated. Let me see if I can simplify. Let's factor out M on both sides. Let's see:

- (6800 /60) = [ 1 - t/(60) ] * dv/dt - (v(t)/60 )

Hmm, perhaps. Let me rearrange the equation:

-6800/60 = [1 - t/60 ] dv/dt - v(t) (1/60 )

Multiply both sides by 60 to eliminate denominators:

-6800 = 60 [ (1 - t/60) dv/dt - v/60 ]

Wait, perhaps that's not the best approach. Alternatively, let's express the equation as:

-6800 M/(60) = [ M - (M t)/60 ] dv/dt + v(t) ( - M /60 )

Divide both sides by M to simplify:

-6800/(60) = [1 - t/60 ] dv/dt - v(t)/60 

Multiply both sides by 60 to eliminate the denominator:

-6800 = 60(1 - t/60) dv/dt - v(t)

Simplify the left side and the (1 - t/60) term:

-6800 = [60 * (1 - t/60)] dv/dt - v(t )

60*(1 - t/60) = 60 - t.

So,

-6800 = (60 - t) dv/dt - v(t )

Rearranging:

(60 - t) dv/dt = -6800 - v(t )

So,

dv/dt = [ -6800 - v(t) ] / (60 - t )

This is a differential equation. Hmm, solving this would require techniques for solving first-order linear ODEs.

The general form is:

dv/dt + P(t) v = Q(t)

In our case, rearranging:

dv/dt + [ 1/(60 - t) ] v = -6800/(60 - t )

So, the integrating factor μ is exp( ∫ [1/(60 - t)] dt )

Let's compute the integrating factor. Let u =60 -t. du = -dt. ∫ [1/u ] (-du) = ∫ (1/u) du = ln|u| + C. So, integrating factor is e^{ ln |60 -t| } = 60 -t.

Multiply both sides of the DE by the integrating factor:

(60 - t) dv/dt + v = -6800

The left side is the derivative of (v (60 -t )).

So,

d/dt [ v (60 -t) ] = -6800

Integrate both sides:

v (60 -t) = -6800 t + C

Solve for v(t):

v(t) = [ -6800 t + C ] / (60 -t )

We need to find the constant C. At t=0, what's the initial velocity? Wait, the rocket starts from rest, so v(0) = 0.

So,

0 = [ -0 + C ] / (60 - 0 )

So, C = 0.

Thus,

v(t) = ( -6800 t ) / (60 -t )

At t=1 second,

v(1) = (-6800 *1 ) / (60 -1) ) = (-6800)/59 ≈ -115.2542 ft/s

Wait, but the question asks for acceleration, not velocity. Acceleration a(t) is dv/dt. Alternatively, since we have v(t) = (-6800 t)/(60 -t ), we can find dv/dt.

Let me compute a(t):

a(t) = dv/dt = [ -6800 (60 -t) - (-6800 t)(-1) ] / (60 -t )^2 

Wait, wait, perhaps using the quotient rule. Let's compute:

v(t) = (-6800 t) / (60 - t )

So, dv/dt = [ (-6800)(60 -t) + 6800 t ] / (60 -t )^2

Wait, let me compute the numerator:

-6800 (60 - t) + 6800 t = -6800 *60 + 6800 t + 6800 t 

Simplify:

-6800 *60 + 13600 t 

Factor 6800:

6800 [ (-60) + 2 t ]

So,

dv/dt = [6800 (2t -60 ) ] / (60 -t )^2 

Factor numerator:

2t -60 = 2(t -30 )

So,

dv/dt = 6800 * 2 (t -30) / (60 -t )^2 

= 13600 (t -30) / (60 -t )^2 

Wait, but 60 -t is in the denominator squared, so (60 -t )^2.

Alternatively, perhaps simplifying more.

Wait, another approach: (t -30) = (60 -t ) - 90. Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, (t -30) = -(30 - t). So,

dv/dt = 13600 ( -(30 -t) ) / (60 -t )^2 

= -13600 (30 -t) / (60 -t )^2 

But (30 - t) is positive when t <30, negative when t>30.

Hmm, perhaps finding at t=1, which is before 30, so 30-t is positive.

So,

a(1) = -13600 (30 -1) / (60 -1 )^2 

= -13600 *29 / (59^2 )

Calculate denominator: 59^2 is 3481.

So,

a(1) = -13600 *29 / 3481 

Compute 13600 *29:

Let me compute 13600 * 30 = 408000, subtract 13600 → 408000 -13600 = 394400.

So,

a(1) = -394400 /3481 ≈ Let's compute 394400 ÷ 3481.

Hmm, perhaps compute 3481 * 113 = ?

Wait, 3481 * 100 = 348100.

3481 × 113: 113 = 100 +13.

3481 *100=348100.

3481 ×13: Let's compute 3481 *10 =34810, 3481*3=10443. So total 34810+10443=45253.

So 3481 ×113 =348100 +45253=393,353.

Wait, but 3481 ×113 is 3481×100=348100, plus 3481×13=45253 → 348100+45253=393353.

But our numerator is 394400. So 394400 - 393353 = 1047.

So,

394400 = 3481×113 + 1047.

Now, 1047 /3481 ≈ 0.3.

So, a(1) ≈ -113.3 ft/s².

Wait, but the options are given in ft/s. Hmm, but the options are all in whole numbers. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the acceleration. Let me go through the steps again.

We have:

v(t) = (-6800 t) / (60 - t )

So,

dv/dt = [ (-6800)(60 - t ) + 6800 t ] / (60 - t )² 

Wait, that's perhaps easier. So:

dv/dt = [ (-6800)(60 - t ) + 6800 t ] / (60 -t )^2 

Factor numerator:

-6800 *60 + 6800 t + 6800 t 

= -6800*60 + 13600 t 

Wait, no, wait: 6800 t +6800 t=13600 t.

But wait, no, 6800 t +6800 t =13600 t.

So,

Numerator = -6800*60 + 13600 t 

= -408000 + 13600 t 

So,

dv/dt = ( -408000 +13600 t ) / (60 -t )^2 

= [ 13600 t -408000 ] / (60 -t )^2 

Factor numerator: 13600 (t - 30 )

But 13600 = 6800 *2.

So,

dv/dt = 2*6800 (t -30 ) / (60 - t )² 

Wait, but 60 -t = -(t-60 ), so (60 -t )² = (t-60 )².

Hmm, perhaps we can write:

(t-30 ) = (60 -t ) -90.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that (t -30 ) = (60 -t ) -90.

But perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the acceleration at t=1 second.

So, substituting t=1 into dv/dt:

dv/dt = [ 13600 (1) -408000 ] / (60 -1 )^2 

= (13600 -408000 ) / (59 )^2 

= ( -394400 ) / 3481 

= -113.3 ft/s².

Wait a second, but earlier I thought the acceleration was around -113.3 ft/s². But looking at the options given, for example, option D is 20 ft/s², which is positive. Hmm, perhaps I missed a negative sign.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In the calculation, dv/dt = (13600 t -408000 ) / (59 )². For t=1, 13600*1=13600. 408000 is 408,000. So, 13600 -408000 = -394400. So, numerator is -394400, denominator 3481.

So,

dv/dt = -394400 / 3481 ≈ -113.3 ft/s².

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 20, option C is 68, etc. So, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the rocket's mass loss and the velocity imparted. Suppose that the rocket ejects a mass m with a velocity v_e. Then, the change in velocity delta_v is given by delta_v = v_e - (m/M) v_e.

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, the change in velocity can be found by considering the momentum change.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the rocket equation in the form:

delta_v = v_e ln ( M_initial / (M_initial - delta_M) )

But I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the rocket equation but with the mass and velocity given.

Wait, another approach: Let me think that the rocket ejects a mass of mass m, and the velocity of the mass relative to the rocket is v. Then, the velocity of the mass relative to the ground is u = v + (mass/rocket mass) * v_rocket. But I'm not sure about the direction of the velocity.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the velocity of the ejected mass is 6800 ft/s, so the velocity of the mass as observed from the ground is 6800 ft/s. Then, the acceleration of the rocket is the derivative of velocity, which would be the derivative of 6800 ft/s.

Wait, but that's not correct because the mass is changing. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the motion in terms of the change in velocity. Let's say the rocket starts from rest, so initial velocity is zero. After ejecting 1/60 of its mass, perhaps the velocity has changed.

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's best to look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be considered using the concept of acceleration in the context of variable mass. The general equation for acceleration when mass is being expelled is:

a = (d/dt)(v) = (d/dt)[ (M - dm/dt ) * u ] 

Wait, but I'm not sure about the equation setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should assume that the velocity is given as the velocity of the mass relative to the ground, and then find the acceleration.

In that case, the velocity of the mass is 6800 ft/s, and since the mass is being lost at a rate of 1/60 of its initial mass, we can model the change in velocity over time.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is too complex for my current approach. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering that the mass is being lost at a constant rate (1/60 of initial mass per second). So, the mass as a function of time is M(t) = M - (M/60) t.

The velocity of the mass is given as 6800 ft/s. So, the velocity of the mass is 6800 ft/s, regardless of the time. But that can't be, because the mass being expelled is changing, so the velocity of the expelled mass should change as well.

Wait, but if the velocity of the expelled mass is 6800 ft/s, perhaps that's a constant. So, perhaps the mass is being expelled at a constant velocity, so the acceleration is zero. But the problem states that the mass is being expelled, so the acceleration should be non-zero.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering the correct setup. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mass is being expelled at a constant rate, so the mass is being lost at (M/60) per second. So, the mass as a function of time is M(t) = M - (M/60) t.

The velocity of the mass is given as 6800 ft/s, so the velocity of the mass is v = 6800 ft/s. But since the mass is being expelled, the velocity of the mass as observed from the ground would change. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should model the acceleration of the rocket as the derivative of the velocity of the expelled mass. So, if the expelled mass is moving at 6800 ft/s, the acceleration of the rocket would be equal to that, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just recap.

After setting up the differential equation and solving it, I found that the acceleration at t=1 second is approximately -113.3 ft/s².

But looking at the options given, the closest is option D: 20. None of them is 113. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me check the calculation again.

At t=1, a(1) = -13600 (30 -1) / (59)^2 → Wait, no, earlier I thought that the integrating factor gave a positive acceleration, but perhaps I missed the negative.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the acceleration calculation. Let me double-check the differentiation.

We had v(t) = (-6800 t )/(60 - t )

Then,

dv/dt = [ (-6800)(60 -t) + 6800 t ] / (60 -t )^2 

Wait, but in doing the differentiation, perhaps I made a mistake in the numerator.

Wait, let's compute again.

The numerator when differentiating v(t) = (-6800 t )/(60 - t )

Using the quotient rule:

v'(t) = [ (-6800)(60 -t) - (-6800 t)(-1) ] / (60 -t )^2 

Wait, no, the quotient rule is:

d/dt [ f(t)/g(t) ] = [ f’(t) g(t) - f(t) g’(t) ] / [g(t)]²

So,

f(t) = -6800 t → f’(t) = -6800

g(t) =60 -t → g’(t) = -1

So,

v’(t) = [ (-6800)(60 -t) - (-6800 t)(-1) ] / (60 -t )² 

Simplify numerator:

= [ (-6800)(60 -t) - 6800 t ] 

= [ -6800*60 +6800 t -6800 t ]

= [ -6800*60 + 0 ]

= -408000 

So,

v’(t) = -408000 / (60 -t )² 

Which is the correct expression for acceleration.

At t=1, 

a(1) = -408000 / (60 -1 )² = -408000 / 59² 

Compute 59²: 59 *59=3481.

So,

a(1) = -408000 / 3481 ≈ Let's compute 408000 ÷3481.

3481 × 118: 

Because 3481 ×100=348100, 3481 ×18=62658. So 348100 +62658=410,758.

But 408,000 is less than that. So perhaps 3481 × 118 = 410,758 → 3481 ×118=410,758. So, 410,758 is larger than 408,000. So, 3481 ×118=410,758, which is 2,758 more than 408,000. So, 408,000 is 2,758 less than 410,758.

So, 3481 ×117 = ?

Wait, 3481 ×117: 3481 ×120=417,720. Subtract 3×3481=10,443: 417,720 -10,443=407,277.

Which is 407,277.

So, 3481 ×117 =407,277.

Which is less than 408,000 by 723.

So, 408,000 -407,277=723.

So, 408,000=3481 ×117 +723.

So, 408,000/3481=117 +723/3481.

723/3481≈ 0.208.

So, 408,000/3481≈117.208.

So, a(1)= -117.208 ft/s².

Hmm, that's approximately -117.2 ft/s².

But the available options are:

A) 110.3 ft/s²

B) 113.2 ft/s²

C) 68.0 ft/s²

D) 20.0 ft/s²

E) 83.2 ft/s²

Wait, so the correct answer isn't listed. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check again.

a(1)= -408000 /3481 ≈ Let's compute 408000 ÷3481.

We can compute 3481 ×118=3481*(100+18)=348100 +3481*18.

3481*18: 3481*10=34810; 3481*8=27848. So 34810+27848=62658.

So, 3481*18=62658. So, 3481*118=348100 +62658=410758.

Which is larger than 408000 by 2758.

So, 408000 =3481*118 -2758.

So, 408000 =3481*(118) -2758.

So, 408000/3481 =118 -2758/3481.

2758/3481≈0.790.

So, 408000/3481≈118 -0.790=117.21.

So, a(1)= -117.21 ft/s².

Hmm. So, about -117.2 ft/s².

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the rocket's thrust.

The thrust (force) from the rocket is equal to the mass flow rate times the exhaust velocity. So, F = dm/dt * v_e.

The acceleration of the rocket is F/m, so a = (dm/dt * v_e)/m.

But in this problem, perhaps the problem states that the mass is being expelled at a constant rate, but the velocity of the expelled mass is given. So, perhaps the thrust is equal to the mass flow rate times the velocity.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the velocity of the mass is given as 6800 ft/s, so the thrust is equal to m_dot * 6800, where m_dot is the mass flow rate.

The mass flow rate is (M/60) per second, since the mass being expelled is (M/60).

So, m_dot = M/60 per second.

So, F = m_dot * v_e = (M/60) *6800 → F = (M *6800)/60.

The acceleration a = F/m = (M *6800 /60 ) / M =6800/(60 )=113.333 ft/s².

Wait, so that's 113.333 ft/s², which is option B.

But wait, this approach assumes that the mass flow rate is constant and that the thrust is proportional to the velocity.

But in reality, the thrust depends on the exhaust velocity and the mass flow rate, which are both constant in this case. So, the rocket's acceleration is F/m = (m_dot v_e ) / m.

Here, m_dot is (M/60) per second, m is the initial mass.

So, a = ( (M/60) * v_e ) / M = v_e /60.

v_e =6800 ft/s.

So, a=6800/60=113.333 ft/s².

Which is option B. So, according to this approach, the correct answer is B.

But according to the previous approach, where I considered the velocity changing over time, I got a different answer.

Hmm. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the mass is being expelled at a constant rate, and the velocity imparted by the expelled mass is given. So, perhaps the thrust is constant, and thus the acceleration is constant.

So, the acceleration is v_e /60 =6800/60=113.333 ft/s², which is option B.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B.

But I'm a bit confused because in the earlier approach, I considered the velocity as a function of time, and got a different result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the mass is being expelled at a constant rate, so the velocity imparted by the expelled mass is given, and thus the acceleration is constant.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the acceleration using both methods and see which one is correct.

First method: Using the differential equation, I found a(1)= -117.2 ft/s².

Second method: Assuming constant acceleration, I found a=113.333 ft/s².

Which one is correct?

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is the second one, because the problem states that the mass is being expelled at a constant rate, and the velocity imparted is given, so the acceleration is constant.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: 113.2 ft/s².

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem as a rocket, where the mass is being expelled at a constant rate, so the thrust is constant, and the acceleration is constant.

So, the acceleration is F/m = (dm/dt * v_e ) / m = v_e / (m/(dm/dt)) )=v_e * dm/dt /m.

But since dm/dt = M/60 (as M is the initial mass), and m is the initial mass, so dm/dt = (M/60) per second.

Wait, but no, dm/dt is the mass flow rate, which is M/60 per second.

So, a = v_e * (dm/dt ) / m.

Wait, but a = v_e * ((M/60 ) / M )=v_e /60.

So, a=6800/60=113.333 ft/s².

So, the correct answer is B.

But in the first approach, I considered the velocity as a function of time and found a different acceleration.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that in the first approach, I considered the velocity as a function of time, but the problem states that the velocity imparted is constant, so the acceleration is constant.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is the second one, where the acceleration is constant, so the correct answer is B.

Therefore, the answer should be option B.
</think>

The correct answer is **B) 113.2 ft/s²**.

**Explanation:**

The problem involves a rocket expelling mass at a constant rate, with the velocity imparted by the expelled mass given. The key approach is to recognize that when the mass flow rate is constant, the thrust (force) is constant, and thus the acceleration is constant.

1. **Thrust Calculation:**
   The thrust (force) imparted by the expelled mass is given by:
   \[
   F = \dot{m} \cdot v_e
   \]
   where:
   - \(\dot{m}\) is the mass flow rate (\(M/60\) per second).
   - \(v_e\) is the velocity of the expelled mass (6800 ft/s).

2. **Acceleration Calculation:**
   The acceleration \(a = F/m = (\dot{m} \cdot v_e)/m\). Since \(\dot{m} = M/60\) and \(m = M\) (initial mass), the acceleration simplifies to:
   \[
   a = \frac{v_e}{60} = \frac{6800}{60} \approx 113.333 \, \text{ft/s}^2
   \]

3. **Answer Selection:**
   The closest match to 113.333 ft/s² is **B) 113.2 ft/s²**.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.
