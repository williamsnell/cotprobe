At trial, the rider testified that he was attending a horse show when, without provocation, he was kicked by a gray stallion with a black tail. The rider then called the woman as an adverse witness and asked her the following question: "Isn't it true that you are the owner and trainer of a gray stallion with a black tail?" After answering affirmatively, the woman was not asked any further questions on direct examination. Whereupon in cross- examination, the woman was then asked, "Isn't it true that your horse is very gentle and would not kick anyone unless provoked?"Upon objection by the rider's attorney, the rider's strongest argument would be that the woman's proffered testimony is

D: inadmissible, because the woman's testimony contradicts the rider's account.
E: inadmissible as beyond the scope of the woman's direct testimony.
F: admissible as it provides evidence of the horse's general behavior.
G: inadmissible, because the woman's testimony is biased.
H: admissible as it is relevant to the case.
I: admissible, because it can refute the rider's claim.

Okay, so I'm looking at this legal question about evidence admissibility. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

So, the scenario is an equestrian rider suing a woman, claiming that her horse injured her. At trial, the rider says he was at a horse show without provocation and was kicked by a gray stallion with a black tail. Then he called the woman as an adverse witness and asked her two questions. First, she said she owns and trains the stallion, then the second was whether the horse is gentle and wouldn't kick anyone unless provoked. The rider's attorney objects, and the woman is asked her second question. The question is about what the woman's testimony is admissible for.

I remember that evidence admissibility has different rules. There's hearsay, improper forms of impeachment, and so on. Let's go through each option.

Option A says it's inadmissible as hearsay. Hearsay is when someone tries to prove something by testimony of another party that isn't the actual party. The rider is trying to prove his ownership and training of the horse. But wait, the rider's testimony about attending the show without provocation and being kicked could be hearsay. But wait, the woman isn't directly testifying about the horse. So the woman's testimony is about whether the horse is gentle. So the woman's statement is about the horse's behavior, which is hearsay only if it relates to the issue at hand. But in this case, the rider is trying to prove that the woman owns and trains the horse. Since the woman is the witness, and the rider is testifying about the horse's ownership, that's hearsay only if it's about the property of the woman. So if the woman says the horse is gentle, that's hearsay against the woman. But the rider is claiming the woman owns it. So the woman's testimony is about the horse's behavior, which is hearsay. However, the rider is trying to prove that the woman owns and trains the horse. Hearsay requires the statement to be about the property of the other party. So if the woman's testimony is about the horse's behavior, that's hearsay. So that would make it inadmissible unless there's some form of impeachment or substitution. So option A is saying it's inadmissible because it's hearsay. But wait, the woman isn't testifying about the horse's origin or training, so the woman's testimony only concerns the horse's behavior. So that would be hearsay against the woman. But does that make the rider's argument valid? Or is the woman's testimony admissible in itself?

Option B: improper form of impeachment. Improper form of impeachment is when a witness is asked to prove something that would be proven by cross-examination. For example, if someone testifies that they knew something was wrong, you can't cross-examine them to prove it's true. The first question the rider asks is about ownership, which is about the horse's title. The woman is then asked whether the horse is gentle. So the woman's testimony is about the horse's behavior, which is admissible for impeachment. But I'm not sure if the woman can testify about the horse's behavior in itself for impeachment purposes. I think impeachment is about whether the statement is true, not about the content of the statement. So the woman's testimony might not be admissible as impeachment, but the question is about what the woman's testimony is admissible to show.

Option C: inadmissible as substantive evidence. That would be if it's hearsay. But again, the woman's testimony is about the horse's behavior, so it's hearsay only if it relates to the property of the other party. But since the other party is the rider, and the horse's origin is being questioned, it's hearsay. So if the woman's testimony is hearsay, then the rider's argument about it being admissible is incorrect. So option C is not a valid argument.

Option D: admissible as evidence of the horse's general behavior. That would be hearsay again because it's about the horse's origin. So the woman's testimony is hearsay and thus inadmissible unless it's admissible as a hearsay. So D is out.

Option E: Beyond direct testimony. That's not right because the woman is directly testifying about the horse's behavior. So E is not applicable.

Option F: Admissible as it provides evidence of the horse's general behavior. Well, that's hearsay again, so F is not correct.

Option G: Inadmissible because the woman's testimony is biased. The woman is the adverse witness. But bias is about the content of the testimony, not the admissibility. So G's argument isn't about why the testimony is inadmissible.

Option H: Admissible as relevant to the case. That's hearsay, so H is out.

Option I: Admissible because it can refute the rider's claim. So the woman's testimony would prove that the horse is gentle. If the rider's testifies that the horse was kicked because of the black tail, and the woman testifies that it's gentle, that would show that the horse is gentle and wouldn't kick unless provoked. So the rider's argument would be that the woman's testimony supports his claim. So I is a valid argument.

Wait, but I need to think again. The rider is trying to prove that the woman owns and trains the horse. The woman's testimony is about the horse's behavior, which is hearsay. So the woman's testimony is not admissible. So the rider's argument would be that it's admissible because it can refute the claim. But wait, the problem is that the woman's testimony is hearsay, so it's not admissible. So the rider's strongest argument is that the woman's testimony is admissible to show the horse is gentle and would not kick. Alternatively, maybe the woman's testimony is admissible as a hearsay to show the horse's behavior, but the rider's argument is that the woman's testimony is admissible as evidence of the horse's behavior. Or perhaps it's inadmissible because it's hearsay, making the rider's argument invalid. 

Alternatively, if the woman's testimony is admissible in itself, then the rider's argument that it's inadmissible because it's hearsay is incorrect. Or perhaps the woman's testimony is admissible as an admission of the horse's gentle behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps the woman's testimony is admissible as a hearsay to show that the horse is gentle, which would support the rider's claim.

Wait, but the rider is asserting ownership and training. The woman's testimony is about the horse's behavior, which is hearsay. So the woman's testimony is not admissible unless it's admissible for impeachment. But the rider is trying to prove the woman owns the horse. So if the woman's testimony is hearsay, it's inadmissible. So the rider's argument that this testimony is admissible to show the horse's behavior is incorrect. Therefore, the only valid argument would be that the woman's testimony is hearsay and thus inadmissible. But looking at the options, option A says it's inadmissible because it's hearsay. So that's a possible argument. 

Wait, but the question is about the woman's testimony being admissible. If the woman's testimony is not hearsay, then it's admissible. But the woman is the witness, so her testimony is about the horse's behavior, which is hearsay against her. So that makes the woman's testimony inadmissible. Therefore, the rider's strongest argument would be that the woman's testimony is admissible, but that's not true because it's hearsay. Alternatively, the woman's testimony is inadmissible, so the rider can't use it to prove the horse's ownership.

Wait, but the rider's argument is that the woman's testimony is admissible, which isn't correct because it's hearsay. So the rider's strongest argument would be that the woman's testimony is inadmissible because it's hearsay. But the options don't have an option saying that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: inadmissible because it's hearsay.

Option I: admissible because it can refute the rider's claim.

Wait, but if the woman's testimony is hearsay, then the rider's argument that it's admissible to show the horse's behavior is incorrect. So the rider's strongest argument would be that it's inadmissible because it's hearsay. So option A would be the answer.

But wait, the woman's testimony is about the horse's behavior, which is hearsay. So the woman's testimony is inadmissible as hearsay. So the rider's argument is that it's admissible, which is incorrect. So the rider's strongest argument is that it's inadmissible because it's hearsay. So option A.

Alternatively, maybe the woman's testimony is not hearsay. No, because it's about the horse's behavior, which is the property of the other party. So the woman's testimony is hearsay.

Another way, the woman can testify about the horse's behavior, but that's hearsay. So the testimony is inadmissible. Thus, the rider's strongest argument is that the woman's testimony is inadmissible because it's hearsay. So the answer would be A.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the woman's testimony regarding her horse's behavior in cross--examination. The key issue is whether the testimony is hearsay and thus inadmissible.

1. **Option A: Inadmissible because it is hearsay.**
   - The woman's testimony about her horse's behavior is hearsay because it concerns the property of the other party (the rider). For hearsay evidence, the statement must relate to the property of the party being testified about. Since the woman is the witness, and the testimony is about the horse's behavior, it is indeed hearsay.
   - This makes the testimony inadmissible unless impeachment is used, which it is not in this case. Therefore, the rider's strongest argument is that the testimony is inadmissible because it is hearsay.

2. **Option I: Admissible because it can refute the rider's claim.**
   - While the woman's testimony can support the rider's claim by showing the horse is gentle, the issue is whether it is admissible. Since it is hearsay, it cannot be admitted as evidence.

3. **Other options:**
   - **Hearsay (A):** Correct, as the testimony is about the horse's property.
   - **Proper form of impeachment (B):** Incorrect, as impeachment is about the truth of the matter, not the content of the testimony.
   - **Substantive evidence (C):** Incorrect, as it is about the horse's ownership, not its behavior.
   - **Beyond direct testimony (E):** Incorrect, as the woman is directly testifying.
   - **Reaching a reasonable conclusion (F):** Incorrect, as it is about the horse's behavior, not the conclusion.
   - **Bias (G):** Incorrect, as bias pertains to the content of the testimony.
   - **Relevant to the case (H):** Incorrect, as it is about the horse's ownership, not its behavior.
   - **Admissible for impeachment (I):** Incorrect in the context of admissibility.

Thus, the correct answer is that the testimony is inadmissible because it is hearsay.

**ANSWER: A**
