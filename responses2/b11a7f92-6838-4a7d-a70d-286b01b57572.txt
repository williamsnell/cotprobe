Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Okay, the problem is about a collision between two marbles on a smooth horizontal surface. Hmm, smooth surface probably means no friction, so energy is conserved? Wait, but wait—the impact is instantaneous, so maybe we can use conservation of momentum. Oh right, because when objects collide and there's no external forces, momentum is conserved.

So, the setup: there's a 100-gram marble (let's call that mass m1) that's hitting a 25-gram marble (m2). Initially, the 100g marble is moving at 100 cm/sec, and the 25g is stationary. After the collision, the 100g marble slows down to 60 cm/sec. We need to find the speed of the 25g marble after the collision. Let's think about the variables.

Momentum before collision equals momentum after collision. The formula I remember is m1*v1_initial + m2*v2_initial = m1*v1_final + m2*v2_final.

Since the surface is smooth, there's no friction, so yes, momentum is conserved. Also, since it's an inelastic collision (they stick together?), but wait, no, wait—the problem says it's a "squarely" strike. I think that means a direct hit, so each marble bounces off each other. So it's an elastic collision? Or is it just a collision with no energy loss? Wait, the question doesn't specify if it's elastic or inelastic. Hmm, but wait, the problem doesn't state whether kinetic energy is lost. Oh, but wait, in physics, when you have a collision with no given details, sometimes we assume it's an elastic collision, but sometimes it's inelastic. But wait, the problem says "impact," which could be either, but in many problems, when you're not told, it's often treated as inelastic, but sometimes as elastic. Hmm, but the answer options suggest that the 25g marble's speed is either lower or higher than the 100g's.

Wait, let's think about what the problem says. The 100g marble's speed goes down from 100 to 60 cm/s. So it's losing speed. But the 25g marble is moving in the opposite direction? Or same direction? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but since it's a collision, the 25g could be moving in the same direction or opposite.

Wait, but in a typical collision, if the bigger mass (100g) stops, the smaller one would be moving in the opposite direction, right? Because the big one is heavier and stops. So perhaps the 25g marble is moving backward after the collision. So the direction is important.

Let me write down the variables:

m1 = 100g = 0.1 kg

v1_initial = 100 cm/s = 100 m/s (if we take cm/s as meters per second, but wait, no, wait. 100 cm/s is 100 m/s? No, wait, 100 cm is 1m. So 100 cm/s is 1 m/s. Oh, I think I should convert to SI units. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 100 cm is 1 m. So 100 cm/s is 1 m/s. Same for 60 cm/s is 0.6 m/s. So I'll convert all to kilograms and meters per second.

Wait, but wait, the masses are given in grams. So I need to convert them to kilograms. 100g is 0.1 kg, 25g is 0.025 kg.

So, the initial momentum is m1*v1_initial + m2*v2_initial. Since the second marble is stationary, v2_initial is zero. So initial momentum is 0.1 kg * 1 m/s = 0.1 kg·m/s.

After the collision, the 100g marble's velocity is 60 cm/sec. So that's 0.6 m/s. Let v2 be the velocity of the 25g marble after the collision. But wait, wait—what direction is it moving? If the initial is in the positive direction, the 25g could be moving in the negative. So, let's say v1_final is 0.6 m/s (but direction is opposite; maybe negative). So, the 25g's velocity would be negative, say v2 = -v (where v is positive). So the equation is:

0.1 * 1 + 0.025 * 0 = 0.1 * 0.6 + 0.025 * (-v)

Wait, no, because the 25g is moving in the opposite direction, so its velocity is negative. So the equation is:

m1 * v1_initial + m2 * v2_initial = m1 * v1_final + m2 * v2_final.

But since v2_initial is zero, the equation becomes:

0.1 * 1 + 0.025 * 0 = 0.1 * 0.6 + 0.025 * v2.

Wait, but wait, after collision, the 100g is moving in the opposite direction, so its velocity is negative. Let me correct that. Let me define the initial direction as positive. So, after the collision, the 100g moves in the negative direction. So v1_final is -0.6 m/s. So, the equation becomes:

(0.1 kg)(1 m/s) + (0.025 kg)(0) = (0.1 kg)(-0.6 m/s) + (0.025 kg)(v2).

So, 0.1 = -0.06 + 0.025 v2.

Wait, calculate the left-hand side and right-hand side:

Left side: 0.1 kg·m/s

Right side: (0.1 * -0.6) + (0.025 * v2) = -0.06 + 0.025 v2.

So,

0.1 = -0.06 + 0.025 v2.

Adding 0.06 to both sides:

0.1 + 0.06 = 0.025 v2 → 0.16 =0.025 v2 → v2=0.16 / 0.025 → 6.4 m/s.

Wait, that can't be right because the 25g marble's velocity is much lower than the 100g's. But let me check the calculations again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in considering the direction. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the problem says the speed is reduced from 100 cm/s to 60 cm/s. So the 100g's speed is 0.6 m/s in the opposite direction. So, the equation should be:

m1 * v1_initial + m2 * v2_initial = m1 * v1_final + m2 * v2_final.

But v2_initial is zero, and v1_final is -0.6 m/s (since it's opposite).

So,

0.1 * 1 + 0.025 * 0 = 0.1 * (-0.6) + 0.025 * v2.

Calculate left side: 0.1.

Right side: (-0.06) + 0.025 v2.

So,

0.1 = -0.06 + 0.025 v2.

Add 0.06 to both sides: 0.16 = 0.025 v2 → v2 = 0.16 / 0.025 → 6.4 m/s.

Wait, that's 6.4 m/s. So the 25g marble is moving at 6.4 m/s in the opposite direction (negative, so if initial direction is positive, it's moving in the negative).

Wait, but that's much slower than the 100g's 0.6 m/s. But wait, the 25g is smaller. So if it's moving opposite, its speed is 6.4 m/s. But looking at the options, option J is 140 cm/sec, which is 1.4 m/s. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Let's recheck.

Wait, perhaps the initial direction is positive, but the 25g marble's movement is in the same direction. Let me think. If the 100g stops, the 25g would move in the same direction as the initial. So, perhaps I should have considered the 25g's velocity as positive.

Wait, so if the 25g is moving in the same direction as the 100g, then after collision, let's reevaluate.

So, initial velocities: v1_initial = 1 m/s (positive), v2_initial = 0.

After collision, v1_final = 0.6 m/s (same direction), v2_final = v.

So the equation becomes:

0.1 * 1 + 0.025 * 0 = 0.1 * 0.6 + 0.025 * v.

Which is:

0.1 = 0.06 + 0.025 v.

Subtract 0.06:

0.04 = 0.025 v → v = 0.04 / 0.025 → 1.6 m/s.

So, 1.6 m/s is 160 cm/s. Looking at the options, option C is 160 cm/sec. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the 25g would move opposite. But perhaps the problem didn't specify which way it moves. So perhaps the initial direction is positive, and after collision, the 25g moves in the same direction as the 100g? Or opposite? Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't specify whether the 25g moves in the same direction. So we need to assume it's moving in the opposite direction because the 100g stops.

Wait, but in my calculation, the 25g moves at 6.4 m/s in the opposite direction, which is 64 cm/s. But the options don't have that. So maybe my initial assumption was wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Let me re-express the momenta correctly. Let me define the initial direction as positive. So, the 100g marble is moving to the right (positive), the 25g is at rest.

After collision, the 100g is moving to the left (negative direction), and the 25g is moving either to the right or left.

So, the momentum equation should account for their directions.

So:

p_initial = m1 * v1_initial + m2 * v2_initial = 0.1 kg *1 m/s + 0.025 kg *0 = 0.1 kg·m/s.

p_final = m1 * v1_final + m2 * v2_final = 0.1 kg * (-0.6 m/s) + 0.025 kg * v2_final.

So,

0.1 = (-0.06) + 0.025 v2.

0.1 + 0.06 = 0.025 v2 → 0.16 = 0.025 v2 → v2 = 0.16 / 0.025 → v2 = 6.4 m/s.

So, 6.4 m/s is 64 cm/s. But the options don't have this. Let me look at the options again. Oh, option G is 120 cm/sec, H is 40, etc. So that's not an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the 25g doesn't move in the same direction as the 100g. So, maybe it's moving in the opposite direction. So let me try that scenario.

Assuming that the 25g moves in the same direction as the 100g. So, v1_final = 0.6 m/s (same direction), and v2_final = v.

So the equation becomes:

0.1 *1 +0 = 0.1 *0.6 + 0.025 * v.

So,

0.1 = 0.06 + 0.025 v.

Subtract 0.06: 0.04 = 0.025 v → v=0.04/0.025=1.6 m/s → 160 cm/s. Which is option C.

Ah, that's one of the options. So why did I get 6.4 m/s earlier? Because I assumed the 25g moved opposite to the 100g. So, which is correct? Hmm, so which scenario is correct?

Well, in the problem statement, it's a collision between two marbles. If the 100g comes to a stop, it's likely that the 25g is moving in the opposite direction, but sometimes in physics problems, the direction isn't specified, so perhaps the problem is set up such that both are moving in the same direction. 

Wait, but in reality, when a heavier object hits a smaller one, the smaller tends to move backward. So, perhaps the correct scenario is that the 25g marble moves in the opposite direction. But the problem doesn't specify, so how do I proceed?

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should consider that the 100g marble's speed is reduced, so it's moving in the opposite direction to the 25g. So let me try that.

So, setup the equation again:

p_initial = 0.1 * 1 + 0.025 * 0 = 0.1 kg·m/s.

p_final = 0.1 * (-0.6) + 0.025 * v.

So equation:

0.1 = (-0.06) + (0.025 v).

Adding 0.06 to both sides:

0.16 = 0.025 v → v=6.4 m/s.

But 6.4 m/s is 64 cm/s, which is not an option. So this suggests that the initial assumption that the 25g moves in the opposite direction is incorrect. So perhaps the 25g is moving in the same direction as the 100g. So, let's reevaluate.

In that case:

p_initial = 0.1*(1) + 0.025*0 = 0.1.

p_final = 0.1*(0.6) + 0.025 v.

So,

0.1 = 0.06 + 0.025 v.

Subtract 0.06:

0.04 = 0.025 v → v= 0.04 / 0.025 = 1.6 m/s → 160 cm/s.

So, 160 cm/s is option C. That's one of the options. So, perhaps the correct answer is 160 cm/s.

Wait but why did I initially get 6.4 m/s when I assumed the 25g moves opposite? Because that scenario isn't leading to any of the given options, so perhaps the correct scenario is that the 25g is moving in the same direction as the 100g after collision.

Let me think about the physics. A collision where the larger mass stops—this is a perfectly inelastic collision, but in any case. 

Wait, but in reality, when a larger mass hits a smaller one, the smaller tends to move backward. So, perhaps the correct scenario is that the 25g marble moves in the opposite direction. But the problem doesn't specify, so how do I proceed?

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should consider that the 100g marble's speed is reduced, and the 25g's is moving in the same direction. Let's compute.

So, initial momentum: 0.1 * 1 = 0.1 kg·m/s.

After collision: 0.1 * 0.6 + 0.025 * v.

So,

0.1 = 0.06 + 0.025 v → 0.04 = 0.025 v → v = 1.6 m/s.

Which is 160 cm/s. Option C is 160 cm/s. So that would be the answer.

Hmm, but what if the 25g doesn't move in the same direction? Then the 25g would have higher speed than before. But since 100g is moving slower, perhaps the 25g goes faster in the opposite direction. But why would that happen?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the velocities are in opposite directions. Let's re-calculate.

Equation:

0.1 *1 +0 = 0.1*(-0.6) + 0.025 v.

0.1 = -0.06 + 0.025 v → 0.16 =0.025 v → v=6.4 m/s.

Which is 64 cm/s. But that's not among the options. So perhaps the correct scenario is that the 25g is moving in the same direction as the 100g.

Wait, but that scenario doesn't make sense... Because when the 100g is moving towards the 25g, the 25g's initial velocity is zero. So, if the 100g's speed decreases, the 25g's could have velocity in either direction. But the problem might be a perfectly elastic collision, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that the 25g's speed is smaller is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the 25g's speed is actually higher. Let me think. If the 100g is moving, and the 25g is moving in the same direction, and the 100g's speed reduces, perhaps the 25g's speed increases, but in the opposite direction. So, let's consider that.

So, initial momentum is 0.1 *1 + 0.025 *0 = 0.1.

After collision, 0.1 * v1_final + 0.025 * v2_final = 0.1.

v1_final is 0.6 m/s (same direction as initial), so:

0.1 *0.6 = 0.06.

So,

0.06 + 0.025 v2 = 0.1 → 0.025 v2 = 0.04 → v2=1.6 m/s.

Which is 160 cm/sec. So that's option C.

So, in this scenario, the 25g marble moves in the same direction as the initial motion, but its speed increases.

Wait, but how? Because when a larger mass hits a smaller one, the smaller tends to move backward. So, in this case, if the 25g is moving in the same direction as the 100g, then the 25g is moving in the same direction as the initial, but the 100g is moving in the opposite.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of the collision as such: the 25g is moving towards the 100g. So, in that case, the 100g is moving in the opposite direction after collision.

So the initial setup would be:

m1 moving in +x, m2 moving in -x.

After collision:

m1 moving in -x, m2 moving in -x.

Wait, so both are moving in the same direction as the initial.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. Let me model that.

So, initial:

p_initial = 0.1 *1 + 0.025 *0 =0.1.

After collision:

p_final = 0.1 * (-0.6) + 0.025 * (v).

→ 0.1*(-0.6) = -0.06.

So,

-0.06 + 0.025 v = 0.1 → 0.025 v = 0.16 → v=6.4 m/s.

Which is 64 cm/s. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the 25g is moving in the same direction as the 100g after collision.

So, in that case, the equation is:

p_initial = p_final.

So,

0.1*1 + 0.025*0 = 0.1 *0.6 + 0.025 * v.

→0.1 = 0.06 +0.025 v.

Subtract 0.06:

0.04 = 0.025 v → v= 1.6 m/s → 160 cm/s.

Which is option C.

So, perhaps the problem setup is such that the 25g is moving in the same direction as the 100g after collision. So, the correct answer would be 160 cm/sec. But why?

Wait, let me think of another scenario. Suppose the 25g is moving in the opposite direction after the collision. Then:

p_initial = 0.1 *1 + 0.025 *0 =0.1.

p_final = 0.1*(-0.6) +0.025*(-v).

→0.1*(-0.6) = -0.06.

→0.025*(-v) = -0.025 v.

So,

0.1 = -0.06 -0.025 v.

→0.1 +0.06 = -0.025 v.

→0.16 = -0.025 v → v= -6.4 m/s.

So, v is -6.4 m/s, meaning the 25g is moving in the opposite direction to the initial motion.

But this doesn't match any of the options. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more about the concept of momentum transfer. Let me think.

In a perfectly inelastic collision, the objects stick together, but here, perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for velocities after collision.

When a mass m1 hits a mass m2, the velocities are given by:

v1' = [ (m1 - m2) / (m1 + m2) ] v1_initial.

v2' = [ 2 m2 / (m1 + m2) ] v1_initial.

Wait, I think that's the formula for the velocities after collision when the collision is inelastic.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about this.

Another formula I found is:

v1' = [(m1 - m2)/(m1 + m2)] v1_initial.

v2' = [2 m2/(m1 + m2)] v1_initial.

Wait, but let's see if that applies here.

In our case, m1 is 100g, m2 is 25g.

So,

v1' = (100 -25)/(100 +25) *1 = 75/125 *1 = 0.6 m/s.

Wait, but that's the same as the initial.

But that can't be right because the 100g's speed is reduced. So, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is when the collision is inelastic, the velocities are given by:

v1' = [ (1 - m2/m1) ] v1_initial.

v2' = [ (2 m1)/(m1 + m2) ) ] v1_initial.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to find a correct formula.

I think the correct formula for the velocities after an elastic collision is:

v1' = [ (m1 - m2) / (m1 + m2) ] v1_initial.

v2' = [ (2 m2) / (m1 + m2) ] v1_initial.

But if it's an inelastic collision, perhaps the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the principle of conservation of momentum.

Since the surface is smooth (no friction) and the collision is instantaneous, the principle of conservation of momentum applies.

So, initial momentum:

p_initial = m1 * v1_initial + m2 * v2_initial.

Since the 25g is at rest, p_initial = m1 * v1_initial.

After collision, p_final = m1 * v1_final + m2 * v2_final.

Setting them equal:

m1 * v1_initial = m1 * v1_final + m2 * v2_final.

Divide both sides by m1:

v1_initial = v1_final + (m2/m1) * v2_final.

But I'm not sure if this approach is helpful.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I should assume that the 100g marble's velocity is reduced, and the 25g's velocity is in the opposite direction. So, the equation becomes:

m1 * v1_initial = m1 * v1_final + m2 * (-v2_final).

Going back to the variables.

So,

100g *1 = 100g *0.6 +25g * v2_final * (-1).

Wait, but let me properly write the unit conversion.

Wait, 100g is 0.1 kg, 25g is 0.025 kg.

So,

0.1 kg *1 =0.1 kg *0.6 +0.025 kg *v2_final.

So,

0.1 =0.06 + 0.025 v2_final.

Subtract 0.06:

0.04 =0.025 v2_final.

v2_final =0.04 /0.025 = 1.6 m/s =160 cm/s.

So, that's option C.

So, according to this calculation, the correct answer is C, 160 cm/sec.

But earlier, when I assumed the 25g was moving in the same direction, I got 6.4 m/s, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct scenario is that the 25g is moving in the opposite direction, which leads to option C.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is option C, 160 cm/sec.
</think>

The problem involves a collision between two marbles on a smooth horizontal surface. A 100-gram marble strikes a 25-gram marble and comes to rest. The goal is to determine the velocity of the 25-gram marble immediately after the collision.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Conservation of Momentum**:  
   The total momentum before and after the collision must be equal.  
   Initial momentum:  
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = (0.1 \, \text{kg})(1 \, \text{m/s}) + (0.025 \, \text{kg})(0) = 0.1 \, \text{kg·m/s}.
   \]  
   Final momentum:  
   \[
   p_{\text{final}} = m_1 v_1' + m_2 v_2' = (0.1 \, \text{kg})(0.6 \, \text{m/s}) + (0.025 \, \text{kg})(v_2').
   \]  
   Setting \( p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{final}} \):  
   \[
   0.1 = 0.06 + 0.025 v_2'.
   \]  
   Solving for \( v_2' \):  
   \[
   0.04 = 0.025 v_2' \implies v_2' = \frac{0.04}{0.025} = 1.6 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]  

2. **Unit Conversion**:  
   Convert \( v_2' \) from meters per second to centimeters per second:  
   \[
   v_2' = 1.6 \, \text{m/s} = 160 \, \text{cm/s}.
   \]  

3. **Direction of the 25-gram Marble**:  
   Since the 25-gram marble's velocity after the collision is positive, it moves in the same direction as the initial velocity of the 100-gram marble. This aligns with the principle of conservation of momentum and the behavior of objects in collisions.

### Conclusion:
The speed of the 25-gram marble immediately after the collision is **160 cm/sec**, which corresponds to option **C**.

ANSWER: C
