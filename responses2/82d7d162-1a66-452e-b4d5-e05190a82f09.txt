Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these concepts yet. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

The question says we have a sample of 3.00 moles of a diatomic ideal gas at 200 K. It's being compressed reversibly and adiabatically until the temperature reaches 250 K. We're given C_v,m, which is 27.5 J/(K·mol), and we need to calculate the change in entropy, ΔS.

Hmm, I remember that entropy change for a process can be calculated using the formula ΔS = nCv ln(T2/T1) + nR ln(V2/V1), but wait, wait. Or was it for isothermal processes? Oh wait, maybe in adiabatic processes it's different. Since it's adiabatic, Q=0, and the first law applies: ΔU = -W, but for entropy, I think there's another approach.

Wait, another approach: For reversible adiabatic processes, I remember that entropy change is related to the temperature and the heat capacity. Oh right, the formula for entropy change ΔS is nCv ln(T2/T1) + nR ln(V2/V1), but wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Alternatively, for an adiabatic process, the relation between T and V is T1 V1^(γ-1) = T2 V2^(γ-1). But maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Wait wait, but I'm not given the volume, so maybe I should think about using the formula for entropy change in terms of temperature and heat capacity. Oh right, for a reversible adiabatic process, the change in entropy is given by ΔS = nCv ln(T2/T1) + nR ln(V2/V1). But wait, I don't have V2, so maybe I can find it using the adiabatic relations. Alternatively, since it's a diatomic gas, which is a perfect gas, I can use the relation between T and V or T and P.

Wait, another thing I've learned is that for an ideal gas in a reversible adiabatic process, the entropy change is ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1). Alternatively, another formula I remember is ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1) = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1). Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula for entropy change in terms of temperature change and the relation between T and V.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for entropy change when dealing with temperatures and volumes. I think the correct formula is ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1). But since the process is adiabatic and reversible, the change in volume can be related to T using the adiabatic index γ.

Wait, another approach: For an adiabatic process, the change in entropy is given by ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1). But if I can find V2 in terms of T1 and T2, using the relation T V^(γ-1) = constant. So, T1 V1^(γ-1) = T2 V2^(γ-1). Rearranging, V2/V1 = (T1 / T2)^(1/(γ-1)).

Wait, let me double-check that. Oh, right, the relation is T1 V1^(γ-1) = T2 V2^(γ-1), so V2/V1 = (T1 / T2)^(1/(γ-1)).

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. For an adiabatic process of a diatomic gas, the relation between V and T is V ∝ T^(1/(γ-1)). Since γ is (Cp/Cv) for diatomic gases, which is (7/2)/(5/2) = 7/5 = 1.4. So γ is 1.4.

So, V2/V1 = (T1 / T2)^(1/(γ-1)) = (200 / 250)^(1/(0.4)).

Wait, 200/250 is 0.8. 1/(0.4) is 2.5. So (0.8)^2.5.

Hmm, let me compute that. 0.8 squared is 0.64. 0.8^0.5 is about 0.8944. So 0.64 * 0.8944 ≈ 0.5725. So V2/V1 ≈ 0.5725.

So ln(V2/V1) ≈ ln(0.5725) ≈ negative value. Let's think about the value. 0.5725 is about 0.6, so ln(0.6) is approximately -0.5108. So if I calculate n R ln(V2/V1), that would be 3 * 8.314 * (-0.5108) ≈ 3 * 8.314 is about 24.942, multiplied by -0.5108, so approximately -24.942 * 0.5108 ≈ -12.75 J/(mol·K).

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about the exact calculation. Let me compute it accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for entropy change in an adiabatic process. I recall that for a reversible adiabatic process, the entropy change ΔS is given by nR ln(T2/T1) + n Cv ln(T2/T1) ? No, I think that's not right. Alternatively, I think the formula is ΔS = nCv ln(T2/T1) + nR ln(V2/V1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: For an ideal gas undergoing a reversible adiabatic process, the change in entropy is ΔS = nCv ln(T2/T1) + nR ln(V2/V1). But I also know that for a reversible adiabatic process, the relation between T and V is TV^(γ-1) = constant. So, T1 V1^(γ-1) = T2 V2^(γ-1). Let me write that as V2/V1 = (T1/T2)^(1/(γ-1)).

So, V2/V1 = (200/250)^(1/(0.4)) = (0.8)^2.5.

Let me compute 0.8^2.5 exactly. 0.8^2 is 0.64. 0.8^0.5 is approximately 0.8944. So 0.64 * 0.8944 ≈ 0.5725 as before.

So ln(0.5725) ≈ -0.558. So then:

nR ln(V2/V1) = 3 * 8.314 * (-0.558) ≈ 3 * 8.314 ≈ 24.942, 24.942 * (-0.558) ≈ -13.93 J/(mol·K).

Wait, but then the other term, nCv ln(T2/T1) is 3 * (27.5) * ln(250/200). Let's compute that.

250/200 is 1.25. ln(1.25) is approximately 0.2231.

So 3 * 27.5 * 0.2231 ≈ 3 * 27.5 = 82.5; 82.5 * 0.2231 ≈ 18.48 J/(K).

So the total entropy change ΔS is approximately 18.48 + (-13.93) ≈ 4.55 J/(mol·K). Wait, but none of the options are close to that. Hmm, that's concerning. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, let me double-check the formula for the entropy change in a reversible adiabatic process. I think I might have confused the formula. Oh wait, wait, another thought: No, wait, in a reversible adiabatic process, the change in entropy is indeed given by ΔS = nCv ln(T2/T1) + nR ln(V2/V1). But wait, I've heard of another formula where ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1) = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1). Let me make sure I'm applying the right formula.

Alternatively, I think that for a reversible adiabatic process, the formula is ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1). No, I've got that right. So why is the total entropy change in that case around 4.55 J/(mol·K), but the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options. The options are in the range from -20 to +15. Wait, where am I going wrong?

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps for an adiabatic process, the change in entropy is zero because it's an adiabatic process. No, that's not correct because entropy is a state function, and for a reversible process, the change depends on the path. Wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Wait, in a reversible adiabatic process, Q=0, so the change in entropy is zero. Because for a reversible process, ΔS = Q_rev / T. Since Q_rev is zero, ΔS is zero.

Wait, that's right! Oh! Because entropy change for a reversible process (which is the case here) is zero. So if the process is reversible and adiabatic, then the entropy change is zero. That's a key point I've been missing.

So, the correct answer should be zero, which is option E.

Wait, but why? Because in a reversible adiabatic process, Q=0, so ΔS = Q_rev / T = 0 / T = 0.

So that makes sense. Because entropy is a state function, the change only depends on the initial and final states. So whether the process is reversible or not, the change is determined by the initial and final states.

Thus, in this case, even though the process is reversible and adiabatic, the change in entropy is zero because the system's state hasn't changed—it's just moving from one state to another in a way that doesn't affect entropy.

To solve the problem, we analyze the process step by step:

1. **Understanding the Process**: The problem describes a reversible adiabatic compression of a diatomic ideal gas. In such processes, no heat is exchanged with the surroundings (\(Q = 0\)), and entropy is a state function, meaning the change in entropy depends only on the initial and final states, not the path taken.

2. **Key Formula for Entropy Change in a Reversible Process**: For any reversible process, the change in entropy is given by:
   \[
   \Delta S = \frac{Q_{\text{rev}}}{T}
   \]
   Since the process is adiabatic (\(Q_{\text{rev}} = 0\)), the entropy change is:
   \[
   \Delta S = 0
   \]

3. **Applying to the Problem**: The process is both reversible and adiabatic. Therefore, the entropy change for the system is zero, regardless of the temperature change. The fact that the temperature increases from \(200 \, \text{K}\) to \(250 \, \text{K}\) does not affect this result.

4. **Conclusion**: Since the process is adiabatic, no heat is transferred, and the change in entropy is zero.
