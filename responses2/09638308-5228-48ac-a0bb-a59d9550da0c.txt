Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Suppose that a hypothesis test is conducted using a 5% significance level. Which of the following statements are correct?

(i) The significance level is equal to the size of the test

(ii) The significance level is equal to the power of the test

(iii) 2.5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test

(iv) 5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test.

Options:

A: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only
B: (i), (ii), and (iii) only
C: (ii) and (iii) only
D: (i), (iii), and (iv) only
E: (iii) and (iv) only
F: (ii) and (iv) only
G: (i) and (iv) only
H: (i) and (iii) only
I: (i) and (ii) only
J: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about hypothesis testing and significance levels. Hmm, let me think through each part carefully.

The question is about which statements are correct regarding a hypothesis test conducted at a 5% significance level. The options are statements (i) to (iv), and the answer choices are A through J, each selecting different combinations of these statements.

Let's go through each part one by one.

**(i) The significance level is equal to the size of the test.**

Wait, significance level is another term for the size of the test. The size is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true (type I error). So yes, statement (i) must be correct. That's straightforward.

**(ii) The significance level is equal to the power of the test.**

Wait, power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative is true. The significance level is about the Type I error rate. Power is a measure of how effective the test is at detecting an alternative hypothesis. So unless the test is perfect (which it isn't), the significance level isn't equal to power. So statement (ii) is incorrect. 

**(iii) 2.5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test.**

A 2-sided test splits the significance level into both tails. So for a 5% level, each tail would have 2.5%. So statement (iii) is correct.

**(iv) 5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test.**

Wait, 5% is the total significance level. But when split into two tails (both left and right), each tail would have 2.5%. So statement (iv) is incorrect. Because 5% is the total, not 2.5% per tail.

Wait wait, no. Let me clarify. The significance level (alpha) is 5%. For a two-tailed test, that alpha is split into two tails. So each tail would have 5% / 2 = 2.5%. So statement (iv) says 5% in each tail, which is incorrect. Statement (iii) is correct. So (iv) is wrong.

So now, let's tally which statements are correct:

(i) Correct.

(ii) Incorrect.

(iii) Correct.

(iv) Incorrect.

So which options include (i) and (iii) and exclude others? Looking at the options:

Looking at the options given:

Option D: (i), (iii), and (iv) only. Wait, no, because (iv) is wrong. So option D is wrong.

Option J: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) → All incorrect except (i). So that can't be right.

Wait, let me check again.

Wait, no, (i) is correct. (ii) is incorrect. (iii) correct. (iv) incorrect.

So correct statements are (i) and (iii). The options are:

Looking at the choices:

Option D: (i), (iii), (iv) → (iv) is wrong, so D is incorrect.

Option H: (i) and (iii) only → This would include (i) and (iii), but not (ii) or (iv). So that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option D: (i), (iii), and (iv) → (iv) is wrong.

Option H: (i), (iii) only → That includes (i) and (iii). So that would be correct.

Wait, but is (iv) correct? No, because (iv) says 5% in each tail, which is wrong. So (iv) is wrong.

So the correct statements are (i) and (iii). So the options that include only these must be considered.

Looking back at the options:

Option H says (i) and (iii) only. So that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, what options are provided?

Wait the options are:

A: (ii), (iii), and (iv)
B: (i), (ii), (iii)
C: (ii) and (iii)
D: (i), (iii), (iv)
E: (iii) and (iv)
F: (ii) and (iv)
G: (i) and (iv)
H: (i) and (iii) only
I: (i) and (ii) only
J: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)

So, correct statements are (i) and (iii). So option H is (i) and (iii) only, which is correct.

Wait, but earlier I saw that statement (iv) is incorrect. So option H is correct.

So the answer should be option H. So looking at the options, H is (i) and (iii) only. So option (H) is correct.

The analysis of the statements regarding a 5% significance level in hypothesis testing is as follows:

1. **Statement (i):** Correct. The significance level is equal to the size of the test, which is 5%.
2. **Statement (ii):** Incorrect. The significance level (5%) is not equal to the power of the test; power measures the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis.
3. **Statement (iii):** Correct. For a two-sided test, each tail has 2.5% of the distribution.
4. **Statement (iv):** Incorrect. Each tail would have 2.5%, not 5%, for a 5% significance level in a two-sided test.

The correct statements are (i) and (iii). Among the provided options, only **H (i) and (iii) only** includes these correct statements.
