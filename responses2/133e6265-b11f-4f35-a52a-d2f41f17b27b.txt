Okay, so I need to figure out the interest rate earned on a Treasury bill. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that a Treasury bill is a type of investment where the buyer buys the bill before it matures and the seller agrees to buy it back later. The interest here is typically simple interest, not compounded, I think. 

The question gives me the details: I bought a 91-day Treasury bill for $485,000 and it's worth $500,000 at maturity. So the principal is $500k, and the face value is $500k. The time the bill is held is 91 days.

Wait, but when calculating interest rates, we usually use the actual number of days in the period, not the number of months or years. So 91 days is the exact time, not 91/365 of a year.

The formula for the simple interest rate is: 

Interest Rate = (Face Value - Purchase Price) / Purchase Price * (365 / Days)

Plugging in the numbers: Face Value is $500,000, Purchase Price is $485,000. So the difference is $15,000. 

So, 15,000 / 485,000 = let's calculate that. 

Well, 15,000 divided by 485,000 equals approximately 0.031080645 or 3.108%. Then, multiply by (365/91) to get the annual rate.

Let me compute 365 divided by 91. 91 times 4 is 364, so 365/91 is approximately 4.010989.

So 3.108% times 4.010989. Let me calculate 3.108 * 4.011. 

3 *4 is 12, 0.108 *4 is 0.432; 3*0.011 is 0.033; 0.108*0.011 is about 0.001188.

Adding those up: 12 + 0.432 =12.432; 12.432 +0.033=12.465; 12.465 +0.001188â‰ˆ12.466.

So approximately 12.466%. Looking at the options, the closest is 12.5% (option B). Alternatively, maybe I should double-check my calculation.

Wait another way: perhaps using the simple interest formula. 

Alternatively, the formula is also sometimes expressed as:

Interest = (Face Value - Purchase Price) / (Days to Maturity * Face Value) * 365

Which is the same as before. So, same result.

So the rate would be approximately 12.5% (option B).

To calculate the interest rate earned on a 91-day Treasury bill, we use the simple interest formula. The interest rate is calculated as:

\[
\text{Interest Rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Face Value} - \text{Purchase Price}}{\text{Purchase Price}}\right) \times \left(\frac{365}{\text{Days to Maturity}}\right)
\]

Plugging in the values:
- Face Value = $500,000
- Purchase Price = $485,000
- Days to Maturity = 91

Difference: $15,000.

Calculation:
\[
\frac{15,000}{485,000} = 0.031080645 \quad \text{(3.108%)}
\]
\[
\text{Multiply by } \frac{365}{91} \approx 4.010989
\]
\[
0.031080645 \times 4.010989 \approx 12.466\%
\]

The closest option is **12.5%** (Option B).

Answer: B
