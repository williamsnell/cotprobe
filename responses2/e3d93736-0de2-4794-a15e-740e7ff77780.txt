Okay, so I need to figure out how many sides a rhombus has. Hmm, I remember from school that a rhombus is a type of quadrilateral. Quadrilaterals have four sides, right? But wait, is that always the case? Or are there different types of quadrilaterals with more sides?

I think I'm mixing terms here. Let me think. A rhombus is a four-sided shape where all sides are equal in length. So, it's a type of parallelogram, because in a parallelogram both pairs of opposite sides are parallel. But wait, how many pairs of sides does a rhombus have? Well, since it's a quadrilateral, it has four sides, so each pair would consist of two sides. So, the rhombus has four sides in total.

Let me check the options again. The options are A:8, B:3, C:6, D:7, E:12, F:9, G:5, H:10, I:2, J:4. So, looking at these, J is 4. Wait, but isn't a rhombus a type of quadrilateral, which has four sides? So, I think the answer should be J:4. But wait, sometimes people confuse it with a square, which also has four sides. But a rhombus is a more general term, not necessarily a square unless all angles are 90 degrees.

Wait, no, a square is a special case of a rhombus where all angles are right angles. But for the question, it's about the number of sides, not the properties. So regardless of being a square, a rhombus has four sides. So, the correct answer is J:4.

The correct answer is J:4.
