Okay, so I've got this equation here: 5x minus 5 equals negative 10. I need to find the correct solution from the options given. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.

First, I'll write down the equation to make it clearer: 5x - 5 = -10. My goal is to solve for x, which means I need to isolate x on one side of the equation.

I remember from algebra that to solve for a variable, I can perform operations that maintain the equality. So, I'll start by dealing with the constants and coefficients. The equation has a -5 on the left side, and I need to get rid of that first. I can do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation. Let's see:

5x -5 + 5 = -10 +5

On the left side, -5 and +5 cancel each other out, leaving just 5x. On the right side, -10 plus 5 is -5. So now the equation simplifies to:

5x = -5

Now I need to solve for x. Since x is being multiplied by 5, I can divide both sides by 5 to isolate x. Let's do that:

5x /5 = -5 /5

On the left, 5 divided by 5 is 1, so x is just 1. On the right, -5 divided by 5 is -1. So, x equals -1.

Now I'll check the options provided. The options are A: -2, B: -5, C: -4, D:0, E:2, F:1, G: -6, H: -1, I: -7, J: -3.

Looking at these, the value I found is -1, which corresponds to option H. 

Wait, let me double-check my calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting again:

5x -5 = -10

Add 5 to both sides:

5x = -10 +5

That becomes 5x = -5.

Divide both sides by 5:

x = -5 /5 = -1.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be H: -1.

The solution involves solving the equation \(5x - 5 = -10\). Adding 5 to both sides gives \(5x = -5\). Dividing both sides by 5 yields \(x = -1\), which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
