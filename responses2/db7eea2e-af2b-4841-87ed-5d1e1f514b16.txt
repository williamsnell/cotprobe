Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the initial value and the slope of a function using the initial-value theorem. The function given is f(t) = e^(-2t) u(t). I remember that u(t) is the unit step function, which is 0 for t < 0 and 1 for t >= 0. That means f(t) is e^(-2t) for t >= 0 and zero otherwise.

The question is asking me to find the initial value and the slope of the function when t approaches zero from the positive side, t=0^+. They also mention using the initial-value theorem, which I think is related to Laplace transforms and the time derivative of the Laplace transform.

Hmm, wait, what are the initial value and initial slope? Oh right, the initial value is f(0^+), which is just the function evaluated at t=0 from the right. Since u(0+) is 1, f(0+) is e^(0) which is 1. So the initial value should be 1. That would eliminate any options where the initial value is 0 or -1. Looking at the options, options A, C, D, E, etc., have initial values. Wait, looking again, options G has initial value 0, D has 0, E has 0, etc. So based on this, initial value is 1. So the options are A, C, F, H, I, J.

Wait, the initial value from the function is 1, so initial value is 1. So options G (0), D (0), E (0), H (1), I (0.5), J (1). So options G, D, E, H, I, J are possible. Wait, initial value is 1, so H or J. Because they are the only ones with 1 as initial value.

Wait, wait. The initial value is f(0^+), which is 1. So looking at the options, H says initial value 1, and J says initial value 1 as well. Wait, let me check the options again:

Options:
A: Initial 2, slope -4
B: Initial -1, slope 2
C: Initial 1, slope 2
D: Initial 0, slope -1
E: Initial 0, slope 2
F: Initial -1, slope -2
G: Initial 0, slope undefined
H: Initial 1, slope undefined
I: Initial 0.5, slope -1
J: Initial 1, slope -2

So wait, H says initial value is 1, and J says initial value 1 as well. So both H and J have initial value 1. So I need to figure out which one is correct for the slope.

Now, about the initial slope. The initial slope is the derivative of f(t) at t=0^+. So I need to compute f’(0^+).

f(t) = e^(-2t) u(t). The derivative of f(t) with respect to t would be the derivative of e^(-2t) multiplied by u(t) plus e^(-2t) multiplied by the derivative of u(t). Since u(t) is zero for t < 0 and 1 for t >0, its derivative is the Dirac delta function δ(t). But at t=0^+, the delta function is zero. Wait, wait, let me think more carefully.

The derivative of f(t) is f’(t) = d/dt [e^(-2t) u(t)]. Using the product rule: d/dt [e^(-2t)] * u(t) + e^(-2t) * d/dt [u(t)].

The derivative of e^(-2t) is -2 e^(-2t). The derivative of u(t) is δ(t). So putting it together:

f’(t) = -2 e^(-2t) u(t) + e^(-2t) δ(t).

But we're evaluating this at t=0^+. Let's see: the term involving δ(t) is e^(-2*0) δ(t) = 1 * δ(t). At t=0^+, the Dirac delta function is zero because it's a distribution. So the delta term is zero. So the first term is -2 e^(-0) u(0+) = -2 *1 *1 = -2.

Wait, so f’(t) at t=0^+ is -2. So the slope is -2. So the initial slope is -2.

Wait, but in the initial-value theorem, the initial slope is given by lim_{s->∞} s F(s), right? Or maybe by the initial value theorem, it's the limit as t approaches 0+ of f(t) = initial value, which I already got as 1. But wait, the initial value theorem says that the initial value is lim_{t->0^+} f(t) = lim_{s->infty} s F(s). So maybe I can use that to double-check.

Alternatively, let's compute F(s), the Laplace transform of f(t). Since f(t) is e^(-2t) for t >=0, so F(s) is ∫_{0}^infty e^(-2t) e^(-st) dt. Wait, no, more accurately, F(s) is the Laplace transform of e^(-a t) u(t), which is 1/(s + a), for Re(s) > -a.

So in this case, a is 2. So F(s) = 1/(s + 2).

Now, according to the initial-value theorem, the initial value is lim_{s->∞} s F(s) = lim_{s->infty} s/(s + 2) = lim (s^2/(s^2 + 2s)) ) = 1. So initial value is 1, which matches what I got earlier.

But wait, the initial slope is the derivative at zero. Earlier, I found that the derivative is -2 e^(-2t) u(t) + e^(-2t) δ(t). At t=0^+, the δ(t) term is zero, so the derivative is -2 *1 = -2. So slope is -2.

Looking at the options, which have initial value 1 and slope -2? Let's see:

Looking at the options, J is Initial 1, slope -2. So option J.

But wait, let me confirm again. So I computed f’(t) as -2 e^(-2t) u(t) + e^(-2t) δ(t). At t=0^+, the second term is e^0 * δ(0^+) which is 1 * δ(0^+). But the delta function's integral is 1, but the value at a point is zero. So the second term is zero. So the derivative is -2 * 1 = -2. Thus, the initial slope is -2.

So the correct answer should have initial value 1 and slope -2. Looking at the options, option J is that. So the answer is J.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given function \( f(t) = e^{-2t} u(t) \), where \( u(t) \) is the unit step function. The unit step function is 1 for \( t \geq 0 \) and 0 for \( t < 0 \). Therefore, \( f(t) = e^{-2t} \) for \( t \geq 0 \) and \( f(t) = 0 \) for \( t < 0 \).

### Step 1: Initial Value
The initial value of the function is given by \( f(0^+) \), which is simply the value of \( f(t) \) as \( t \) approaches 0 from the positive side. Since \( u(0^+) = 1 \), we have:
\[
f(0^+) = e^{-2 \cdot 0} \cdot 1 = e^0 = 1.
\]
Thus, the initial value of \( f(t) \) is **1**.

### Step 2: Initial Slope
The initial slope of the function is the derivative of \( f(t) \) evaluated at \( t = 0^+ \). To find \( f'(t) \), we differentiate \( f(t) \) using the product rule:
\[
f'(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \left( e^{-2t} u(t) \right) = \frac{d}{dt} \left( e^{-2t} \right) \cdot u(t) + e^{-2t} \cdot \frac{d}{dt} \left( u(t) \right).
\]
The derivative of \( e^{-2t} \) is \( -2e^{-2t} \), and the derivative of \( u(t) \) is the Dirac delta function \( \delta(t) \). Thus:
\[
f'(t) = -2e^{-2t} u(t) + e^{-2t} \delta(t).
\]
Evaluating this at \( t = 0^+ \), the term involving \( \delta(t) \) becomes zero because the Dirac delta function is zero at \( t = 0^+ \). Therefore:
\[
f'(0^+) = -2e^{-2 \cdot 0} \cdot 1 = -2.
\]
Thus, the initial slope of the function is **-2**.

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the initial value and initial slope, we have:
- Initial value: **1**
- Initial slope: **-2**

Looking at the options provided:
- **J** states: Initial value is 1, slope is -2.

This matches our results.
