Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the uncertainty principle, I think. The question is about an electron's position precision given its speed and the measurement precision uncertainty.

Let me read it again. The electron's speed is 1e6 m/s, and the uncertainty in speed is 1 percent. I need to find out how precisely we can determine its position. Hmm, I remember the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle from my studies. It relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp). The formula is Δx * Δp >= h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant.

Wait, but wait. Momentum is mass times velocity, right? So Δp would be mΔv. Oh, right, because momentum is p=mv, so the uncertainty in momentum would be m times the uncertainty in velocity, which is Δv.

So the steps are probably:

1. Calculate Δv, which is 1% of the electron's speed.
2. Find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) by multiplying m (mass of electron) by Δv.
3. Use the Heisenberg equation to find the minimum uncertainty in position (Δx), which is h/(4πΔp).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me think. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is Δx * Δp >= h/(2π). Oh wait, no, I think it's h/(4π) for the product, but sometimes I get confused. So the exact form is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is h/(2π). Wait, no, Wait, I think the correct form is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. Because ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/(2) would be h/(4π). Wait no, let me get this right.

Wait, I think the correct expression is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Because ħ is h/(2π), so h/(4π) would be ħ/2. So the equation is Δx * Δp >= ħ/2.

Wait, no, wait. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. Because ħ is h/(2π). So, the minimum product of uncertainties is h/(4π). Wait, no. Let me check the exact formula.

Wait, no, the correct form is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Because the uncertainty principle is stated as Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. So that's h/(4π), because ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π).

So, the formula is Δx ≥ ħ/(2 Δp).

But wait, let me think again. The general form is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. So to find Δx, you take ħ/(2 Δp). So the minimum Δx is ħ/(2 Δp).

So first, compute Δv. The electron's speed is 1e6 m/s, and the uncertainty is 1 percent. So Δv = 0.01 * 1e6 = 1e4 m/s.

Next, compute Δp = m * Δv. The mass of an electron is about 9.109e-31 kg. So mΔv = (9.109e-31 kg) * (1e4 m/s) = 9.109e-27 kg·m/s.

Then, Δx is ħ/(2 * Δp). Since ħ is h/(2π), which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Wait, so let's compute ħ. Let me calculate it as h/(2π). h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. So h/(2π) is 6.626e-34 / (6.283) ≈ 1.0545e-34 J·s.

So, putting it all together:

Δx = (1.0545e-34 J·s) / (2 * 9.109e-27 kg·m/s)

Wait, let's compute the denominator: 2 * 9.109e-27 = 1.8218e-26 kg·m/s.

So Δx = 1.0545e-34 / (1.8218e-26) = approximately 5.78e-10 m.

Wait, let me do the calculation more precisely.

1.0545e-34 divided by 1.8218e-26 is:

(1.0545 / 1.8218) * 1e(-34 +26) = (approx 0.578) * 1e-8 = 5.78e-9 m.

Hmm, but wait, looking at the answer choices, I don't see 5.78e-9 m. Let me check the options.

Options are:

F: 1e4 m/s (speed, probably wrong)

A: 1.1e-8 m

B: 3.3e-10 m

C: 5.8e-9 m

D: 6.6e-9 m

E:4.5e-7 m

Wait, option C is 5.8e-9 m. So that's close to my calculation. But wait, I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recheck the steps.

Δv is 1% of 1e6 = 1e4 m/s.

Mass is 9.109e-31 kg.

Δp = mΔv = 9.109e-31 * 1e4 = 9.109e-27 kg·m/s.

H-bar is about 1.0545e-34 J·s.

Δx = h/(4pi Δp) ? Wait no, earlier I thought I used ħ/(2Δp). Oh wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the uncertainty principle says Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. So Δx ≥ ħ/(2 Δp).

So plugging in the numbers:

Δx = (1.0545e-34) / (2 * 9.109e-27) = 1.0545e-34 / 1.8218e-26 = approximately 5.78e-9 meters.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.8e-9 m. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. The given options have option C as 5.8e-9. So why is option D 6.6e-9? That's about 6e-9, which is a bit higher.

Wait, could I have made a mistake in the calculation? Let's check.

Let me compute 1.0545e-34 divided by 1.8218e-26.

1.0545e-34 / 1.8218e-26 = (1.0545 / 1.8218) * 1e-8.

1.0545 / 1.8218 is approximately 0.578 (since 1.8218 * 0.578 ≈ 1.0545). So 0.578 * 1e-8 = 5.78e-9 m.

So the correct value is around 5.78e-9 m, which is option C.

Wait, but option D is 6.6e-9. Could I have made a mistake in mass?

Wait, perhaps the mass is different. Let me think. The mass of the electron is approximately 9.109e-31 kg. I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Δx.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's compute h/(4 π Δp).

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

Δp is 9.109e-27 kg·m/s.

So 4πΔp is 4 * 3.1416 * 9.109e-27.

4 * 3.1416 is about 12.566.

12.566 * 9.109e-27 = 114.8e-27 = 1.148e-25 kg·m/s.

h/(4πΔp) = (6.626e-34) / (1.148e-25) ≈ 5.78e-9 m.

Same result. So option C is correct.

To determine how precisely the position of an electron can be simultaneously determined, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

where \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}\), \(h\) is Planck's constant (\(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\)), and \(\Delta p\) is the uncertainty in momentum. Momentum is given by \(\Delta p = m \cdot \Delta v\), where \(m\) is the mass of the electron (\(9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\)) and \(\Delta v\) is the uncertainty in velocity (\(1\%\) of \(1 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}\)).

### Step 1: Calculate \(\Delta v\)
The velocity uncertainty is:
\[
\Delta v = 0.01 \cdot 1 \times 10^6 = 1 \times 10^4 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(\Delta p\)
The momentum uncertainty is:
\[
\Delta p = m \cdot \Delta v = (9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}) \cdot (1 \times 10^4 \, \text{m/s}) = 9.109 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \(\Delta x\)
Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:
\[
\Delta x = \frac{\hbar}{2 \cdot \Delta p}.
\]
Substituting \(\hbar = 1.0545 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(\Delta p = 9.109 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg·m/s}\):
\[
\Delta x = \frac{1.0545 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-27}} = \frac{1.0545 \times 10^{-34}}{1.8218 \times 10^{-26}} \approx 5.78 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated value of \(\Delta x\) is approximately \(5.78 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\), which corresponds to option **C: 5.8 × 10⁻⁹ m**.
