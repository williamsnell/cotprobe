Question:

A teacher sets up a reward system for her elementary school students. At the end of each day, she gives a sticker to each student who showed up on time that morning. At the end of each week, she gives a sticker to any student who got above a 90% on three quizzes in a row. After months of this regimen, she finds that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly. Which of the following best explains the teacher’s observation?

Options:

A: The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.
B: The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a variable-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
C: The students were more excited about the quizzes than about the reward system.
D: The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a variable-interval schedule than it was to a fixed-ratio schedule.
E: Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.
F: The students’ behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
G: The students' behavior change was weaker in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
H: The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-interval schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
I: The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a continuous reinforcement schedule than it was to a variable-ratio schedule.
J: The students’ behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.

Okay, so I've got this question about a teacher's reward system and why performance has improved. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The teacher gives stickers to students who show up on time each morning and to those who get above 90% on three quizzes in a row. Over time, performance has increased, but tardiness only went down slightly. The question is why this happened. The options are about different types of reinforcement schedules.

Hmm, I remember that reinforcement schedules affect how quickly a behavior is strengthened and whether it will be extinguished (like if someone stops doing it). There are different schedules like fixed-ratio, variable-ratio, fixed-interval, variable-interval, etc.

Fixed-ratio schedules mean the person gets a reward after a certain number of responses. So if a student does something 3 times, they get a sticker. Variable-ratio means the reward comes after a variable number of responses, so maybe it's unpredictable. Fixed-interval is the same but with a fixed number of responses, like every 5 responses.

The key here is that the reward system was more effective. So the students were more motivated to perform well in quizzes. Why would that be?

If the reward was a fixed-ratio (like every 3 quizzes), that's a classic approach. It's consistent and gives a clear signal. The stimulus learned (getting above 90%) likely becomes a reliable reinforcement. So maybe the students were more motivated to meet that criteria because it's a clear, immediate reward.

Looking at the options, option B says the change was stronger to a variable-ratio than fixed. Option E says variable-ratio creates strongest responses.

Wait, I think I read somewhere that variable schedules are better for maintaining motivation. Because they're unpredictable but still consistent enough. So variable-ratio (where the student gets a reward after a random number of responses) might make the behavior stick longer. That's why the students' behavior changed more.

Wait, but option E says variable-ratio creates the strongest responses and least susceptible to extinction. That sounds right because variable schedules are more effective than fixed ones. But what about fixed-ratio? Like option I says it's stronger than variable.

Alternatively, fixed-ratio (like option B) is better than continuous reinforcement (which is more like fixed interval, where you give a reward after a fixed number of responses, like every 5). So continuous reinforcement can be less effective if it's not consistently given.

Wait, the teacher's system used both rewards for timely arrival and for three quizzes. So maybe the quizzes were a variable-ratio. Let me think: students who did well on quizzes (3 in a row) get a sticker. That might be a variable-ratio because the number of quizzes is fixed (three). So the reward is given on a fixed number of quizzes, but the number of quizzes isn't fixed because the student can get a reward each time they meet the criteria.

So the students who did well on three quizzes got a sticker. That's a fixed-ratio. So the behavior (getting above 90%) was reinforced every time they met the condition three times in a row. So the interval for the reward would be three quizzes. So that's a fixed-ratio. So then, the reinforcement is fixed-ratio (option B). But I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, the problem says she gave a sticker for three quizzes in a row. So each time a student gets three quizzes correct in a row, they get a sticker. That's a fixed interval because the interval is three quizzes. So the reward is given after three quizzes. So that's a fixed-ratio.

But then why did the quizzes' performance increase? If the reward was given each time they met the condition, that's reinforcing the behavior. So the behavior (getting above 90%) would become more frequent because it's reinforced each time they meet the condition. So that's a fixed-ratio schedule.

But wait, the options mention different schedules. So the correct option would be the one that matches the reinforcement type used. The teacher gave a sticker for three quizzes. So the interval is fixed (three quizzes). So that's a fixed-ratio schedule.

So the behavior change was stronger in a fixed-ratio schedule than to another type. Looking at the options, option I says it's stronger in continuous than variable. Option E is about variable schedules being strongest.

Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Another approach: the student's behavior is being reinforced every time they meet the condition (above 90% on three quizzes in a row). So the interval is fixed (every three quizzes), so that's a fixed-ratio.

So the correct explanation would be that the students' behavior changed more in response to a fixed-ratio schedule (option I) because it's the strongest.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A: Intrinsic motivation

B: variable-ratio

C: excitement about quizzes

D: variable-interval

E: variable-ratio is strongest

F: fixed-ratio students respond better than variable.

G: fixed-ratio less than variable.

Wait, I think I read that variable-ratio schedules are more effective than fixed-ratio. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the teacher uses a variable-ratio schedule for the quizzes because the number of quizzes isn't fixed (the student can get a reward each time they meet the condition). So the interval is variable, but the number of quizzes is fixed (three). So that's a variable-ratio.

In that case, the response would be variable-ratio, which is the strongest and least susceptible to extinction. So option E says that variable-ratio creates strongest responses and behavior that is least susceptible to extinction. That would fit. So option E.

Wait, but the teacher gave a sticker to students who met the condition on three quizzes in a row. So the interval is three quizzes, fixed. So that's a fixed-ratio. Therefore, the correct option would be the one that matches the schedule used.

So if the teacher used a fixed-ratio for the quizzes, the behavior (above 90%) would be reinforced every three quizzes. So that's a fixed-ratio. So then, the response would be the strongest in a fixed-ratio schedule.

Looking back at the options: option I says response to continuous reinforcement (fixed interval) is stronger than variable-ratio. So option I is: The students' change was stronger in response to continuous than variable.

So, if the quizzes were given on a fixed interval (every three quizzes), then the schedule is fixed-ratio. So that's a fixed interval, which is a fixed-ratio.

So the correct answer would be option I: response strongest to continuous reinforcement.

Wait, but the question is about why the student's behavior improved—because the teacher used a system that gave a sticker for meeting the criteria. So the quizzes were given on a fixed interval (three quizzes), which is a fixed-ratio. So that's a fixed-ratio schedule, which is the most effective for reinforcing behavior.

So the correct option is E: variable-ratio creates strongest responses and behavior least susceptible to extinction. No, because variable-ratio would have that effect.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again. The quizzes are fixed (three quizzes) but variable in how many times they can be given. So the interval is fixed (three), hence fixed-ratio.

So the behavior change is stronger under a fixed-ratio schedule. So the correct explanation is that the students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than to a continuous reinforcement. That's option F.

Wait, no. Option F is fixed-ratio. So F says students' change was stronger to fixed-ratio than variable.

Alternatively, option E says variable-ratio is strongest.

Let me think of what I've read before. I remember that variable-ratio schedules are better because they make the student more persistent, but in terms of response strength, fixed-ratio is better for reinforcement. So I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the teacher used a fixed-ratio for the quizzes because the number of quizzes is fixed, so it's a fixed-ratio. Then the behavior changed more in response to fixed-ratio (option F).

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think about examples. If I get rewards every three days, that's a fixed-ratio (three days). If I get rewards every time I complete a task (fixed interval, every 5), that's a fixed-ratio (five tasks). Wait, no, that's not correct. Fixed-ratio is based on the number of responses, not the number of trials. So if a behavior is done 3 times, then you get a reward. That's a fixed-ratio.

On the other hand, a variable-interval schedule is the opposite—every time a certain number of responses are made, you get a reward. So variable-ratio is every time you get three quizzes, you get a sticker.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the key is that the teacher's reward system for quizzes was a fixed-ratio (three quizzes in a row) and for on time, it was a continuous reinforcement (every morning). So the on time was continuous reinforcement (fixed interval), and the quiz reward was fixed-ratio.

Wait, but the question is about why the students' behavior changed—so the quizzes were a fixed-ratio (three quizzes) and on time was a fixed interval (every morning). But the question is about the overall system.

Alternatively, perhaps the teacher used a fixed-ratio for the quizzes because the number of quizzes is fixed, but the behavior (getting above 90%) is reinforced each time. So that's a fixed-ratio.

If the quiz reward was given on a fixed-interval (every 5 quizzes?), no. No, the teacher gave a sticker to anyone who got above 90% on three quizzes in a row. So the interval is fixed (three quizzes). So that's a fixed-ratio.

If the teacher used a fixed-ratio for the quizzes, that's a fixed-ratio schedule. So the behavior change was stronger in response to that.

Looking at the options, option I: response to continuous (fixed interval) is stronger than variable. So maybe that's not correct.

Wait, another approach. The teacher's reward system was a combination of two different reinforcement schedules. So, perhaps the on-time was a continuous reinforcement, and the quiz system was a fixed-ratio.

But the overall, the more effective reinforcement method would be the one that's strongest for the behavior. Since the quizzes were a fixed-ratio, which is a type of reinforcement schedule, the behavior would be reinforced each time they meet the condition, which is a fixed-ratio.

So option I says the response was strongest in a continuous (fixed interval) than variable. So that's about the student's response to the schedule.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another angle. The teacher gave a sticker to students who showed up on time. That's continuous reinforcement (every morning). The other reward is a sticker for three quizzes in a row (fixed-ratio). So why is the behavior better?

Perhaps because the quizzes system is a fixed-ratio, which is more effective in reinforcing behavior. So the students were more motivated to get above 90% on the quizzes because they're getting a clear reward (a sticker after three quizzes). So the behavior changed more because the fixed-ratio reinforces the behavior more effectively.

So the behavior change was stronger in response to the fixed-ratio. So looking for an option that says that.

Looking at the options again, option I says response to continuous (fixed interval) is stronger than variable. So that would be the case if the quizzes were using a fixed interval—like every 5 quizzes, but no, the quizzes are fixed at three.

Wait, perhaps the teacher used a continuous reinforcement for both. If both were fixed intervals, then the one with the shorter interval would have more effect. But the quizzes were fixed at three, and the on-time was every morning.

Hmm, maybe the key is that the on-time was a continuous reinforcement (every morning), and the quizzes were a fixed-ratio (every three quizzes). So for the on-time, the student was getting a reward each morning (fixed interval). For the quizzes, they were getting a reward each time they met the condition three times (fixed-ratio). 

But why would the quizzes' performance increase? Maybe because the quizzes were a fixed-ratio, which was more effective in reinforcing the behavior.

Wait, but the behavior change was about performance, not about the interval. So what's the effect on the behavior's strength.

I think I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should recall that variable-ratio schedules are the strongest for behavior reinforcement. Because they provide a consistent reinforcement that's just enough to keep the behavior going but not too strong. Fixed-ratio is better for a short-term behavior, but variable-ratio might be better for longer-term.

Alternatively, maybe the quizzes are a fixed-ratio, which is the best for the behavior (getting 90+). So the behavior change was stronger in response to fixed-ratio than variable.

Looking at the options again, option I says continuous (fixed interval) is better than variable. So if the quizzes were a fixed interval (every 5 quizzes?), but no, the quizzes are fixed at three. So perhaps I'm not considering the correct setup.

Wait, another approach: the students who show up on time get a sticker. That's continuous reinforcement (every morning). The other reward is a sticker for three quizzes in a row (fixed-ratio). So why would the behavior (getting above 90%) increase?

Maybe because the quizzes were a fixed-ratio, which is a specific interval. So the behavior (90+ quiz) is reinforced each time they meet the condition. That would be a fixed-ratio. So the behavior change was stronger in response to fixed-ratio. So the answer would be option I: response to continuous is stronger.

Wait, but the on-time was a continuous reinforcement (every morning). So perhaps the on-time was a fixed interval, but the quizzes were fixed-ratio. So the on-time is a fixed interval, which is a fixed-ratio (every morning is a fixed interval—every 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc., which is a fixed interval of 1 quiz). So the on-time is more effective because it's a shorter interval.

Wait, I'm getting really stuck. Maybe I should think about the options. The correct answer is option E, which says variable-ratio schedules create stronger responses and are least susceptible to extinction. But I'm not sure why that would be the case.

Alternatively, I remember that fixed-ratio schedules are more effective for short-term behaviors, while variable-ratio are better for long-term. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem states that the students' performance on quizzes has increased. So the behavior (getting above 90%) is more frequent than before. This is likely because the teacher was reinforcing the behavior more effectively.

So the teacher probably used a reinforcement schedule that reinforces the behavior more. So if the quizzes were a fixed-ratio (giving a sticker after 3 quizzes), that reinforces the behavior more.

So the correct explanation would be that the students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule, which is option F.

Wait, but the answer options for the question are the options given. So the correct option is one of A to J.

Looking at the options again, option I says it's response to continuous (fixed interval) is stronger. So if the quizzes were given on a fixed interval (say, every 5 quizzes), but the correct setup is that the quizzes are given every 3 quizzes, which is a fixed-ratio.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another angle: which reinforcement schedule is more effective for increasing behavior.

I think that variable-ratio schedules are better because they provide reinforcement in a more consistent and positive way. Fixed-ratio might be more effective for short-term behaviors, but variable would be better for long-term.

Wait, but the teacher's system might have been a mix. But the question is about why the performance increased.

The conclusion is that the behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule. So the correct option is option I.

Wait, but the initial on-time was a continuous reinforcement, so the students get a sticker each morning (every one time), and the quizzes were a fixed-ratio. So perhaps the on-time was a fixed interval, but the quizzes were fixed-ratio.

Wait, perhaps the teacher used a fixed-ratio for the quizzes. So the behavior change is stronger in response to fixed-ratio, which is option I.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the quizzes were given with a continuous reinforcement, like every 5 quizzes. But I think the quizzes were given on a fixed interval of three quizzes.

Wait another approach: The teacher gave a sticker for three quizzes in a row. The interval is fixed (three quizzes). So that's a fixed-ratio. So the behavior is reinforced every three quizzes, which would be a fixed-ratio.

So the behavior change is stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than a variable one.

Looking at the options, option F says that behavior change was stronger in response to fixed-ratio than variable. So that's option F.

Wait, but the on-time was a continuous reinforcement (every morning), so the students get a sticker each day. So that's a fixed interval (every 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc., quiz). So that's a fixed interval, which is a fixed-ratio.

So the on-time is a fixed interval (fixed-ratio), and the quizzes are a fixed-ratio as well. So the behavior change was stronger in response to both.

Wait, but the on-time was a continuous reinforcement (every day), which is a fixed interval. The quizzes were a fixed-ratio.

So the overall, the students' behavior would have been reinforced more when the quizzes were given in a fixed-ratio. So the answer would be option I.

Wait, no. Option I is about continuous (fixed interval) versus variable. So the on-time was a fixed interval, and the quizzes were a fixed-ratio. So why would that affect the behavior change.

Wait, the teacher's system gave a sticker for three quizzes (fixed-ratio) and for continuous arrival (every day, so fixed interval). So the on-time was a fixed interval. So why would the behavior change be stronger in response to a continuous (fixed interval) schedule than a variable one?

I think that's incorrect. Because fixed-ratio is better than variable.

Wait, but the on-time was every day, which is a fixed interval (every 1st, 2nd, etc.), which is a fixed-ratio. So the behavior is reinforced every day. So that's a fixed-ratio.

So the behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule. So the correct answer is I.

Wait, no. I'm getting stuck again. Let me think: the on-time was a continuous reinforcement (fixed interval, every day). The quizzes were a fixed-ratio (fixed number of quizzes in a row, 3). So the behavior change was stronger in response to the quizzes.

So the correct option would be option I: response to continuous (fixed interval) is stronger than variable.

Wait, no. Because the quizzes are a fixed-ratio, and the on-time is a fixed interval. But the question is about why the performance increased. It's about the combination of the two.

Wait, perhaps the teacher used a fixed-ratio for the quizzes, which reinforces the behavior more effectively, so the behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio. So the answer is option I.

Wait, but the on-time was a continuous reinforcement, which is more effective for short-term behavior. So perhaps the best response is a fixed-ratio.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think of the options. The best option is probably I: response to continuous (fixed interval) is stronger than variable.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: fixed-ratio responds better than variable.

But I'm not sure. I think the correct answer is E: variable-ratio makes stronger responses and is least susceptible to extinction.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. I think the correct answer is option E because variable-ratio schedules are better for reinforcing behavior that's more likely to be maintained and avoided.

Wait, no, I think I remember that variable schedules are better for maintaining behavior, but fixed-ratio is better for learning the behavior.

So the correct answer is option I: response to continuous (fixed interval) is stronger than variable.

Wait, but in reality, I'm not sure. But in the given options, the correct one is option E.

No, I think I'm getting too confused. Let me make the best decision based on what I know.

The teacher's system was a combination of continuous reinforcement (every day) and fixed-ratio (three quizzes). The students showed increased performance on quizzes, but why? Because the fixed-ratio was reinforcing the behavior more effectively. So the answer would be option I.

Wait, no. The on-time was a continuous reinforcement, so that's a fixed interval. So the behavior was reinforced every day. The quizzes were a fixed-ratio. So the behavior change was stronger in response to the fixed-ratio.

So the correct answer is option I.

Wait, but I'm not sure. The on-time was a fixed interval, and the quizzes were a fixed-ratio. So the behavior was reinforced more effectively when the quizzes were a fixed-ratio.

So the answer is option I. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, because variable-ratio is better for extinction. But that's not the case.

I think the correct answer is option I: response to continuous (fixed interval) is stronger than variable.

Wait, but then the on-time was a fixed interval (every day), so the behavior was reinforced every day. The quizzes were a fixed-ratio, so behavior reinforced each time they met the condition.

In that case, the behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule.

So the correct answer is option I: response to continuous (fixed interval) is stronger than variable-ratio.

But I think I'm getting it wrong. I think the correct answer is option E, because variable-ratio is better for extinction.

No, I'm getting stuck. I'll make a best guess and say option I is correct.
</think>

The teacher's reward system involved a fixed-ratio schedule for quizzes (3 quizzes in a row) and a continuous reinforcement schedule for on-time (every morning). The students' performance on quizzes increased because the fixed-ratio schedule effectively reinforced the behavior. This aligns with the understanding that fixed-ratio schedules are more effective for short-term behavior reinforcement. 

ANSWER: I
