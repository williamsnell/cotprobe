Question:

Select the best translation into predicate logic. Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter. (e: Earth; j: Jupiter; Bxy: x is bigger than y)

Options:

B: Be~j
C: Bej
D: ~eBj
E: ~Bej
F: e~Bj
G: ~Bje
H: B~ej
I: ~jBe
J: Bje~

Okay, so I have this question about translating a statement into predicate logic. Let me see what I can do here. The question is about Earth not being bigger than Jupiter. The options are A through J, each with a different predicate and negation.

First, I need to break down the statement: "Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter." I know that in predicate logic, we use the negation operator to express that something is not true. So, "Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter" would be the negation of "Earth is bigger than Jupiter."

Now, let me identify the subjects and predicates. The sentence mentions Earth and Jupiter, which I'll assign to variables e and j respectively. The predicate Bxy represents "x is bigger than y." So, "x is bigger than y" would be written as Bxy, meaning x is the subject and y is the object.

Putting that together, "Earth is bigger than Jupiter" would be written as Bej (since e is Earth and j is Jupiter, so B e j). But the statement is the opposite, so we add a negation. So, the full statement in predicate logic would be ~Bej, which reads "It is not the case that Earth is bigger than Jupiter."

Looking at the options, option E is ~Bej. That matches exactly what I came up with. Let me check the other options to make sure none of them are the same or better.

Option A: j~Be. Wait, that doesn't make sense. It looks like the syntax is incorrect. I think it's a typo because you can't have a statement like that. B is an operator, not a predicate in that context.

Option B: Be~j. Hmm, that would mean Earth is bigger than Jupiter and that Jupiter isn't bigger than Earth, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, that's not right. It affects the truth but isn't the correct translation.

Option C: Bej. That's just the original statement without negation. So that's not the negation.

Option D: ~eBj. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let's parse it. The ~eBj would mean not e being bigger than j. But e is Earth and j is Jupiter. So, eBj is Earth being bigger than Jupiter, which is the opposite of what we want. So ~eBj would mean Earth is not bigger than Jupiter, which is correct. Wait, but is that the right way to write it? Because the order matters. Bxy is x is bigger than y, so eBj is Earth bigger than Jupiter. So ~eBj would be Earth not bigger than Jupiter. So that's correct.

Wait, but I thought the correct way is to use the negation of Bej. Let me think again. Let me re-examine Bej. The predicate Bxy is x is bigger than y. So, Bej is Earth is bigger than Jupiter. So the negation is ~Bej, which is option E.

But in option D, it's written as ~eBj, which would imply not (Earth is bigger than Jupiter). So that's the same as ~Bej. So both options E and D seem correct in meaning. Wait, but looking back, the options are labeled A to J.

Wait, let me re-examine the options:

Option D: ~eBj → which is the same as ~Bej because e is Earth and Bj is the same as Bj. So both D and E are equivalent.

Wait, no. Let's parse each option correctly.

Option E: ~Bej → which means it's not the case that Earth is bigger than Jupiter.

Option D: ~eBj → which is the same as ~Bej because e and j are just variables. So both D and E are correct in meaning. But that can't be, because the question should have only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I misread something. Let me check the options again.

Wait, no, let me check each option more carefully.

Option E is ~Bej. So, variables e and j.

Option D is ~eBj. So, eBj is Earth bigger than Jupiter, so the negation is Earth not bigger than Jupiter.

Wait, both D and E seem to express the same meaning. But that's impossible because there's only one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to write the original statement is ~Bej, which would be option E. Alternatively, D is another way to write the same thing. But in the options, perhaps E is correct.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think about the syntax. In predicate logic, the predicate is Bxy, so Bej is Earth being bigger than Jupiter. So the negation is ~Bej.

So option E is ~Bej. So that's correct.

Option D is written as ~eBj, which is equivalent to ~Bej, as e is Earth and B is the predicate. So both D and E are correct. But that's not possible because the question must have only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me read the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me look again.

The original statement is Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter.

So in predicate logic, it's ~B(e,j) or ~Bej? Because B is a binary predicate, so Bxy is x is bigger than y. So Bej is Earth is bigger than Jupiter. So the negation is ~Bej.

So the correct answer is E.

But wait, I thought option D is ~eBj. Let me parse that. eBj is Earth bigger than Jupiter. So ~eBj is not Earth bigger than Jupiter. So it's correct.

Wait, but both D and E are correct? That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Option E: ~Bej

Option D: ~eBj

Are these two options the same? Because e is the subject, and Bj is the predicate. So eBj is Earth bigger than Jupiter. ~eBj is not Earth bigger than Jupiter.

So both D and E are correct in meaning, but that's impossible; the question must have only one correct option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read the options again.

Wait, perhaps the correct translation is ~Bej, which is option E.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting confused about the subject and object. Let me clarify: Bxy is x is bigger than y. So, Bej is Earth bigger than Jupiter. So the negation is ~Bej, which is option E.

So the correct answer is E.

The question asks to translate the statement "Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter" into predicate logic using the variables e (Earth) and j (Jupiter), and the predicate Bxy (x is bigger than y). 

1. The statement "Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter" is the negation of "Earth is bigger than Jupiter."
2. In predicate logic, "Earth is bigger than Jupiter" is represented as Bej (since e is Earth and j is Jupiter).
3. The negation of Bej is ~Bej, which correctly represents "Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter."
4. Option E: ~Bej accurately reflects this translation.

ANSWER: E
