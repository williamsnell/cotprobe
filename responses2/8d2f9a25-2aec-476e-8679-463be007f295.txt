Alright, I've got this law question to tackle. Let me read it carefully.

So, the scenario is a husband and wife shopping at a department store. The wife, who's heavier than 300 pounds, can't find a large enough size for her. She asks the clerk if the store has the dress in her size. The clerk says, "You look like a hippopotamus, and I'm sorry but we don't carry this dress in the hippo size." Then, a customer in the store laughs, and the wife gets upset and leaves. The question is, if the wife claims she's suing the store based on the clerk's comment, what will happen? The options are whether she wins or loses, with various reasons.

Hmm. So, the key here is to determine whether the store's actions were negligent, which would be a case of negligence causing emotional harm, leading to a claim for tort. I remember that tort law focuses on whether the defendant acted with the intent to cause harm, especially emotional distress.

The store's clerk made a statement that was specific and offensive. The wife felt her size was "too big" for the store to carry. The store said they don't have it in the "hippo" size. The fact that the wife was wearing a dress she didn't find suitable makes me think about emotional distress here.

Wait, but the store's action was based on a statement that's offensive and not a reasonable notice. So, the store's duty to provide appropriate clothing is breached. That's negligence. Now, the question is whether the store's negligence caused the emotional harm to the wife.

In tort law, a claim arises when the plaintiff's injury was caused by the defendant's actions. The store's duty is to provide clothing that fits, but they didn't have it in the wife's size. That's a breach of contract, which is negligence. But the harm here is emotional, not physical.

Emotional distress is a gray area. Under some jurisdictions, negligence resulting in emotional harm can be considered a valid tort claim. Others might require that the harm is not excessive or that the plaintiff wasn't at fault. Since the store's duty was to provide clothing in a reasonable size, the wife's reaction is understandable. But did the store's action cause her emotional distress? The store didn't have the dress in her size, so the lack of it might have led to frustration and later frustration leading to a purchase decision.

Wait, but the question is whether the store's actions caused her emotional distress. The store's employees had the customers laughing, which might have made the wife feel that her request was unreasonable. So the store's actions (the clerk's statement) led to her feeling that the store didn't carry the dress, which made her upset and leave.

So, the store's actions caused her emotional distress. Therefore, she can sue for negligence. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exactum. Some courts might say that if the defendant's actions were specific and offensive, the plaintiff might not be able to recover, but others might allow it.

Wait, let's think about the standard in tort law. The rule of res ipsa loquitur (reverse the rule of law) might apply, but I'm not sure. Or, the rule that a claim arises when the defendant's actions were negligent and the plaintiff suffered a reasonable or actual injury. 

In this case, the store's duty is to provide clothing, but they didn't carry the dress in the required size. This is a breach of contract. So, the store's duty was breached, causing the emotional distress. The emotional distress is a direct result of the store's actions.

So, the store's actions are considered negligent because they breached their duty. The emotional distress is a result of that negligence, so the store is liable under tort law.

But wait, some jurisdictions might not allow for emotional harm claims to be made if the plaintiff wasn't at fault or if the injury was not a direct result of the defendant's actions. However, in the absence of such a finding, the store's conduct is considered negligent, leading to a valid claim.

Looking at the options again:

A: Win because the store doesn't carry in her size. So, if the store didn't carry, that's a breach of contract, but the store's duty was to provide appropriate clothing, which they failed. So, the store was negligent.

B: Win because the comment was extreme. That's more about the nature of the event than the cause of harm.

C: Win because the actions caused emotional distress. That seems correct under tort law.

D: Lose because she didn't suffer physical harm. But the store's lack of clothing was a factor, which could lead to emotional distress.

E: Lose because the statement was in a public place. That's irrelevant here, as the issue is the store's actions and not the context.

F: Win because it was to ridicule and humiliate. This is more of a malice claim, which is a separate issue from tort law.

G: Win because of another customer's участiance. That's about hearsay and not a factual basis.

H: Lose because the comment wasn't causing harm. But the store's failure to carry caused her distress, so that's not correct.

I: Lose because it was in public. Again, not related.

J: Lose because it was in public. Same reasoning.

So, the answer should be that the store was negligent, leading to emotional distress. So, the correct option would be C: Win, because the clerk's actions caused her emotional distress.

The store's breach of contract, resulting in the clothing not fitting the wife's size, constitutes negligence. The emotional distress caused by this failure to carry the dress in the specified size is a reasonable or actual injury. Therefore, the store is liable under tort law.
