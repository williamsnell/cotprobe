Okay, so I've got this problem here about Florence Lesson, a saleswoman who drives her car. The question is asking about her automobile expenses for the past year, broken down into two parts: the cost to the company and the monthly average. Hmm, let's see.

First, the problem states that she gets reimbursed 10 cents per mile. She drove 11,472 miles. So, I need to calculate how much she's reimbursed. That should be 10 cents times the number of miles. Let me do that: 10 cents is $0.10, so 0.10 * 11,472. Let's compute that. 11,472 * 0.10 is $1,147.20. So, she's reimbursed $1,147.20.

Wait, but the question is about the cost to the company, which would be the other part of her expenses. She also has expenses for parking and tolls, which are $787.44. Oh, so the total expenses are the sum of the reimbursement and the expenses. So that's $1,147.20 + $787.44. Let me add those. 1147.20 + 787.44. Let's break it down: 1,147 + 787 is 1,934, and 0.20 + 0.44 is 0.64. So, the total cost to the company is $1,934.64. That matches option A and G. So part (a) is $1,934.64.

Now, part (b) is the average cost per month. She's done this for the past year, which is 12 months. So, I need to divide the total by 12. So, 1,934.64 divided by 12. Let me calculate that. 12 goes into 1934.64 how many times? Let's see: 12 x 161 is 1932, which is close. So 161 x 12 is 1,932. Subtract that from 1,934.64, we get 2.64 left. So that's 2.64 / 12 per month. 2.64 divided by 12 is 0.22. So, 161 + 0.22 is $161.22 per month. Looking at the options, option A has $1,934.64 and $161.22, which matches. Alternatively, option I has 1,934.64 and 95.60. Wait, but wait, 1,934.64 divided by 12 is 161.22, not 95.60. So option I is incorrect.

Let me double-check my calculations. 11,472 miles at 10 cents each: 11,472 * 0.10 = 1,147.20. Then adding 787.44 gives 1,934.64. Divided by 12 is indeed 161.22. So the correct answer should be option A: $1,934.64 and $161.22.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is the same as A: $787.44 and $1,934.64. Oh, wait, no, part (a) is the total expense, which is 1,934.64, and part (b) is the average per month, which is 161.22. So, option A is correct.

The cost to the company is the sum of the reimbursement and expenses, which equals $1,934.64. Dividing this by 12 months gives an average of $161.22 per month.

Answer: A: $1,934.64 and $161.22.
