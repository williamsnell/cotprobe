Okay, so I need to find the supplement of a 40° angle. Hmm, I remember that supplementary angles add up to 180°, right? So if one angle is 40°, the other should be 180° minus 40°. Let me do the math: 180 minus 40 is 140. So the supplement should be 140°. Looking at the options, option C is 140°. Let me check the options again to make sure I didn't mix anything up. Yep, option C is there. I think that's the right answer then.
