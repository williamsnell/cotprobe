Question:

A 15-year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of painless swelling in the left testicle that has varied in size over the past several months. There is no history of trauma.

Okay, so I have this question about a patient presenting with painless swelling in the left testicle. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the patient is a 15-year-old male. That's a pretty young age. Painful swelling in the testicle—could that be something else, like a tumor? But wait, the scan showed normal testicular findings, so maybe it's something else. 

The lesion is painless and transilluminates well, so it's visible. No inguinal nodes, so it's not an inguinal cyst. No trauma history, so no bullet points or anything. The scan results are normal, which I think means it's not a tumor—like, it's benign.

So the options are about management. Let's look at them.

Option A: Ultrasound therapy. That's a standard test for testicular tumors. It can detect abnormalities like tumors, benign tumors, or perhaps even growths of other organs. It's non-invasive, so the patient doesn't need surgery.

Option B: Cryotherapy. I remember that cryotherapy is used to remove tumors, especially in testicular cancer. It uses low temperatures to destroy tumors. But if it's a benign lesion, cryotherapy might not be necessary. Plus, the scan shows normal, so maybe it's not something to remove.

Option C: Needle biopsy. That's used for removing tissue. If it's a benign lesion, a biopsy might not be needed. Biopsies are usually done when the tissue is suspicious, like in cancer. So this seems unlikely.

Option D: Radiation therapy. Testicular cancer can have a high radiation dose, but if it's benign, radiation could cause damage. Also, the scan was normal, so maybe it's not radiation sensitivity. Plus, the patient doesn't have any other issues, so I'm not sure if treatment is needed.

Option E: Laser therapy. Similar to radiation therapy, it's used for cancer. Since the scan was normal, it might not be necessary. Also, the testicular area is sensitive, which could be a concern for both laser and radiation.

Option F: Chemotherapy. Again, if it's a benign lesion, chemotherapy wouldn't be appropriate. It's more for cancer treatment.

Option G: Needle aspiration. That's used when you suspect an inguinal cyst, but the patient has no inguinal nodes. So this isn't the case.

Option H: Sclerosing agent injection. That's a treatment for cysts, which is probably not applicable here.

Option I: surgical repair. If it's a tumor, a surgery might be needed, but the scan was normal. The patient is young, so maybe it's something else.

Option J: Oral medication. Probably not relevant here; the patient's symptoms are more concerning.

So, the most likely option is A: Ultrasound therapy because it's a quick, non-invasive way to assess and possibly guide treatment if needed. Since the scan showed nothing abnormal, maybe the patient is fine, or perhaps they're just experiencing symptoms. Alternatively, if it's a benign lesion, maybe no treatment is needed.

The most appropriate management for the patient with painless swelling in the left testicle is **ultrasound therapy**. This is because the lesion is visible, the scan shows normal findings, and there is no evidence of tumor progression or sensitivity. Ultrasound is a standard diagnostic tool for evaluating benign lesions like testicular cysts or tumors. Given the patient's age and the absence of any other symptoms, performing an ultrasound is the recommended first step for this patient.

**Answer: A**
