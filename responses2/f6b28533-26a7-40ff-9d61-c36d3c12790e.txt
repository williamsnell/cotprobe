Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about unemployment rates and factors that influence them. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that when GNP grows by 3.5%, labor productivity increases by 1.6%, and the labor force grows by 2.2% each year. We need to determine whether unemployment is increasing or decreasing.

Hmm, I remember that there are some theories about the relationship between these factors and the unemployment rate. One key concept here is the Phillips Curve, which describes the inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation in some countries. But wait, I'm not entirely sure how exactly GNP, productivity, and the labor force relate to this.

Let me break it down. GNP growth is the total economic output, so that's a broad measure. Labor productivity is the output per worker, which is another measure of economic performance. The labor force is the number of people available to work.

I think the idea is that when GNP grows, it's often tied to increased productivity and a larger labor force. If GNP increases, and productivity goes up, people might be able to work the same jobs, leading to lower unemployment. But if the labor force grows too much, that could lead to higher unemployment because people might leave the labor market.

Wait, but the question is about the rate of change. So, if GNP grows, productivity grows, and the labor force grows. How do these factors affect unemployment?

I recall that in some models, the natural rate of unemployment is determined by the balance between productivity growth and the labor force growth. If the labor force grows faster than productivity, that might cause the natural unemployment rate to decrease. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship.

Alternatively, the traditional Phillips Curve suggests that a rise in the rate of unemployment is associated with a rise in inflation. But here, we're looking at the relationship between these three variables. Maybe it's more about the long-term implications.

Another angle: the concept of Okun's Law relates unemployment to GDP growth. But Okun's Law links GDP growth to unemployment, not the other variables here. But perhaps it's not directly applicable.

Wait, let's think about the sources of economic growth. GNP growth is a broad term, so it could include factors like productivity and labor force. If GNP is growing, and productivity and labor force are growing as well, maybe the economy is expanding, leading to lower unemployment in the long run.

But does it mean that in the short run, unemployment is increasing or decreasing? Or is it a long-term trend?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the concept of the labor force participation rate. If the labor force grows faster than the number of people employed, that might lead to higher unemployment. But in this question, the labor force is growing by 2.2%, which is higher than GNP growth of 3.5%? Wait, no, 2.2% is less than 3.5%, so maybe the labor force is growing slower than GNP. Or wait, GNP growth is 3.5%? So if GNP is growing, and the labor force is growing, perhaps the economy is expanding, which would tend to lower unemployment.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of the factors. If GNP grows, that can lead to higher productivity, which might lead to lower unemployment in the long run. But if the labor force is growing faster, that could mean more people are available, perhaps leading to lower unemployment.

Wait, but the question is about the rate of change of unemployment. So, does GNP growth lead to a decrease in the rate of unemployment, or an increase?

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but one thing I remember is that when the labor force increases, especially if it's a larger percentage than the increase in productivity, it can lead to higher unemployment. For example, if the labor force grows faster than productivity, the economy might not produce enough to keep the same level of employment, leading to higher unemployment.

Wait, but in this case, GNP growth is 3.5%, which is a bit less than the labor force growth of 2.2%. So the labor force is growing at a slower rate than GNP. So if GNP grows, and the labor force is growing, but not as fast, perhaps the economy's output is increasing, leading to less pressure on the labor force, so lower unemployment.

Alternatively, perhaps the increase in GNP and productivity leads to a higher living standards, making people more willing to work, so perhaps the unemployment rate is decreasing.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me think about a formula or equation that relates these variables.

In some models, the natural rate of unemployment (unemployment without cyclical effects) is determined by the ratio of the growth rate of the labor force to the growth rate of productivity. Wait, or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, the traditional equation I remember is something like:

Unemployment rate = natural rate + cyclical component + structural component

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the key is to think about the relationship between the labor force growth rate and the natural rate of unemployment. If the labor force is growing faster than productivity, then the natural rate of unemployment is lower. So, the economy is expanding beyond its potential, leading to lower unemployment.

In this scenario, the labor force is growing by 2.2%, which is less than GNP's 3.5%. So, the labor force is growing slower than the overall economy's growth.

If that's the case, the economy is expanding beyond its potential, so the natural rate of unemployment is lower. So, the unemployment rate is probably decreasing.

Wait, but the question is about whether it's increasing or decreasing. So if the economy is growing beyond potential, then unemployment would be decreasing. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the increase in GNP and productivity leads to a higher living standard, which may cause people to leave the labor force, leading to higher unemployment. But that's a bit of an assumption.

Wait, another thought: the growth rates are given as GNP by 3.5%, productivity by 1.6%, and labor force by 2.2%. So, the labor force is growing at a slower rate than GNP. So, the labor force is expanding at a slower pace than the economy's growth.

If the economy's growth is 3.5%, and the labor force is growing 2.2%, that means the economy is growing faster than the labor force. So, perhaps the economy is producing more, and the labor force is growing, but the output per worker is increasing.

Wait, but how does that affect unemployment? Maybe the expansion is leading to more jobs being created, so the labor force is expanding but the number of new jobs is increasing.

Wait, but perhaps the key is to consider the relationship between the factors. If the labor force is growing slower than GNP, perhaps the economy is increasing its productive capacity, so the natural rate of unemployment is lower, and thus the actual unemployment will be lower than the natural rate.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the inverse: if the labor force is growing and GNP is also growing, but the labor force is growing at a lower rate, then the economy is expanding beyond its potential, so the natural rate is lower, meaning actual unemployment is lower.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options given.

The options are about whether unemployment is increasing or decreasing.

Option A: Unemployment is decreasing. That would mean that over time, the rate of unemployment is dropping. But without knowing more, I'm not sure.

Option B: Unemployment decreases at a rate directly proportional to the increase in productivity. Not sure.

Option C: Unemployment is cyclical and independent of GNP, etc. But I don't think that's correct because the question says all three variables are given.

Option D: Unemployment increases initially but stabilizes. Not sure.

Option E: Unemployment decreases initially but increases over time. That doesn't seem right.

Option F: Unemployment is increasing. Could be.

Option G: Rate can't be determined. Maybe, if we don't have enough info.

Option H: Unemployment inversely proportional to GNP. Well, GNP is 3.5% growth, and if GNP is growing, perhaps that leads to lower unemployment, but I'm not certain.

Option I: Remains same. Unlikely.

Option J: Decreases inversely. Doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: The question is about whether the rate of unemployment is increasing or decreasing. We have three factors: GNP growth, productivity, and labor force.

I think that if the labor force is growing less than GNP, then the economy is expanding. If the labor force is growing, and the natural rate of unemployment is determined by labor force growth, perhaps the natural rate is lower, so the actual unemployment would be lower than the natural rate.

Wait, but perhaps another way: the natural rate of unemployment is the rate at which the economy would adjust to any increases in labor force or productivity. So if the economy is growing, but the labor force is growing, perhaps the natural rate is determined by the labor force growth rate, but the actual rate is lower, so unemployment is decreasing.

Alternatively, perhaps the growth rates can be used to determine the natural rate of unemployment. The natural rate is often equated to the growth rate of the labor force minus the growth rate of productivity. So, natural rate = labor force growth - productivity growth.

Wait, the natural rate is when the economy is at full employment. If the natural rate is low, then output is increasing at a rate faster than the natural rate, leading to lower unemployment.

In this case, natural rate would be 2.2% (labor force growth) minus 1.6% (productivity growth) = 0.6%. So the natural rate is 0.6% unemployment.

If the actual unemployment is lower than the natural rate, that would mean that the economy is overheating, leading to lower unemployment. But wait, if the natural rate is 0.6%, and the actual is, say, 1%, that would indicate that the economy is expanding beyond potential, leading to lower unemployment.

Wait, but the question is about whether unemployment is increasing or decreasing. So if the natural rate is low, and the actual rate is lower than that, then the economy is expanding, leading to lower unemployment. So, would that mean that unemployment is decreasing?

Alternatively, perhaps the growth rates indicate that the economy is expanding beyond its potential. So, in that case, the natural rate of unemployment is determined by the growth rate of the labor force. So, if the labor force is growing at 2.2%, then the natural rate is 2.2% minus the productivity growth of 1.6%, giving 0.6% unemployment.

If actual unemployment is 0.6%, then the economy is at natural rate, so perhaps not increasing or decreasing. But the question gives different growth rates, so perhaps the actual unemployment is lower than the natural rate, indicating that the economy is growing faster than the potential, leading to lower unemployment.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Option F says "Unemployment is increasing." Option E says "Unemployment decreases initially but increases over time." Option D says "Unemployment increases initially but stabilizes."

But the question is about whether the rate is increasing or decreasing, not the total level.

Wait, perhaps another angle. The increase in GNP causes output to increase. If the labor force is growing at 2.2% and GNP is growing at 3.5%, the economy is growing faster than the labor force. This could mean that the natural rate of unemployment is determined by the labor force growth. So, the natural rate would be the labor force growth rate minus productivity growth rate.

So, natural rate = 2.2% (labor force) - 1.6% (productivity) = 0.6%.

If the actual unemployment is below the natural rate, that would mean that the economy is overheating, leading to lower unemployment. But the question is about whether it's increasing or decreasing.

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that when the labor force grows faster than productivity, then the economy is expanding, which could lead to lower unemployment. So, if the labor force is growing faster, perhaps the natural rate is lower, and the actual rate is lower than that, leading to lower unemployment. So, maybe in the long run, unemployment is decreasing.

But the question is about the current situation, or the rate of change?

Wait, the question is about whether it's increasing or decreasing. So, based on the given growth rates, perhaps the natural rate is 0.6%, and if the actual rate is lower than that, the economy is overheating.

So, if the actual unemployment is lower than the natural rate, then the economy is overproducing, leading to lower unemployment in the long run. So, perhaps the current unemployment is lower than the natural rate, making it decrease.

Wait, but the question is about whether it's increasing or decreasing. If the natural rate is 0.6%, and the actual is lower, then the economy is overproducing, so the actual unemployment is lower than the natural rate. So, the actual rate is less than the natural rate, which would mean that the economy is at lower unemployment. But perhaps the actual rate is lower than the natural rate, hence the economy is not overheating.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Another approach: perhaps in the short run, the increase in GNP and productivity would cause lower unemployment. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to recall that if the labor force grows faster than productivity, the natural rate of unemployment is lower, which would lead to lower actual unemployment. But in the question, GNP is 3.5% and labor force 2.2%, so labor force growth is less than GNP.

Wait, perhaps the natural rate is based on the labor force. So if labor force is growing at 2.2% and productivity at 1.6%, the natural rate would be 0.6%. So, if actual unemployment is lower than 0.6%, then the economy is overproducing. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct conclusion is that the unemployment is decreasing because the labor force is growing slower than GNP. So, the economy is expanding, leading to lower unemployment.

Wait, but this is getting a bit too tangled. Let's go back to the options.

The correct answer, based on my initial thought, is probably option E: unemployment decreases initially but increases over time. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, option F: unemployment is increasing, which doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: if GNP grows faster than the labor force growth, the economy is expanding, and the natural rate of unemployment is determined by the labor force. So, if the natural rate is the labor force growth rate, which is 2.2%, the actual rate would be lower, leading to lower unemployment.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about what the question is really about. It's about the relationship between GNP growth, productivity, and the labor force growth. The question is whether the unemployment rate is increasing or decreasing over time.

I think the key here is the concept called Okun's Law, which relates GDP growth to unemployment. But Okun's Law typically deals with the U.S. context, but in many models, it's related to the relationship between the natural rate of unemployment and the actual rate.

In the context of this question, perhaps the correct answer is that the unemployment rate is decreasing because the labor force is growing slower than GNP, leading to lower unemployment.

Alternatively, since the labor force is growing at 2.2% and GNP is growing at 3.5%, the economy is in a situation where it's growing faster than the labor force. So, perhaps the natural rate of unemployment is determined by the labor force's growth, which is 2.2%. So, if the actual rate is lower, that would indicate that the economy is overheating, leading to lower unemployment.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if GNP is growing faster, perhaps the economy is producing more, so the output per worker is higher. But if the labor force is also growing, perhaps the economy is growing beyond potential, leading to lower unemployment.

Wait, another angle. The natural rate of unemployment is determined by the growth rates of the labor force and productivity. The formula is natural rate = growth of labor force - growth of productivity. So, in this case, 2.2% - 1.6% = 0.6%. So the natural rate is 0.6%. 

If the actual unemployment is lower than the natural rate, that would mean the economy is overheating, leading to lower unemployment. But the question is about whether the rate is increasing or decreasing. So, if the economy is growing beyond the natural rate, the actual rate would be lower than the natural rate, meaning unemployment is decreasing.

Wait, but if the natural rate is 0.6%, and the actual rate is lower, then the economy is overheating, which could lead to lower unemployment. So, perhaps in the long run, the economy is at natural rate, so the unemployment is decreasing.

But the question is about whether the rate is increasing or decreasing now. So if the natural rate is 0.6%, and the actual rate is lower than that, but the economy is growing faster than the natural rate, perhaps the actual rate is approaching the natural rate, leading to lower unemployment in the long run.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again. The options are about whether the rate is increasing or decreasing.

Possibly, the correct answer is that the unemployment rate is decreasing because the labor force is growing slower than GNP. So, the economy is expanding, and the natural rate is 0.6%, so actual is lower, meaning unemployment is decreasing.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the unemployment is decreasing because the labor force is growing slower than GNP, leading to lower unemployment.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another approach: in many models, if the labor force is growing faster than the productive capacity (productivity), then the economy is growing beyond its potential, leading to lower unemployment. So, if GNP grows faster than productivity, the natural rate of unemployment is lower, and actual is lower, so the rate of unemployment is decreasing.

Wait, but in this case, GNP is 3.5% and the labor force is 2.2%. The labor force is growing slower than GNP. So, the economy is growing faster than the labor force. Which would lead to lower unemployment.

So, the correct answer would be that the unemployment rate is decreasing. Looking at the options, option A is 'Unemployment is decreasing.' So, the answer is A.

The correct answer is **A: Unemployment is decreasing**.

### Explanation:
The question involves determining whether the unemployment rate is increasing or decreasing based on given growth rates of GNP, productivity, and the labor force. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Key Concepts**:
   - **Natural Rate of Unemployment**: It is determined by the growth rate of the labor force minus the growth rate of productivity. In this case, the natural rate is 2.2% (labor force growth) - 1.6% (productivity growth) = 0.6%.
   - **Economic Growth Beyond Potential**: If the labor force grows slower than GNP (e.g., 2.2% vs. 3.5%), the economy is growing faster than its potential. This leads to lower unemployment in the long run.

2. **Analysis**:
   - The labor force is growing at 2.2%, while GNP is growing at 3.5%. This means the economy is growing faster than the labor force.
   - The natural rate of unemployment is determined to be 0.6%. If actual unemployment is below this rate, the economy is overheating, leading to lower unemployment.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the economy is growing faster than the potential (i.e., beyond the natural rate), the unemployment rate is decreasing over time.
