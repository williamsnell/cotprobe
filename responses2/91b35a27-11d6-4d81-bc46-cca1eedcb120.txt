Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The Italian nation has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. "Rome the capital of Italy" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….
But the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department."
Edward A. Freeman, British historian and politician, The Chief Periods of European History, 1885

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about history, specifically by Edward A. Freeman in his book "The Chief Periods of European History, 1885." The question is about when Italy's connections to its history and traditions were most fully snapped, according to the author. The options are A to J.

First, I need to read the passage carefully to understand the context. The passage starts by talking about Italy's unity and its choice to join the union. It says that the union was at last united, and they all rejoiced. But then the author raises doubts that the union was too quick or thorough. He uses examples like Sicily, which is no longer a geographical expression, and mentions Roger as a place that's now seven provinces of Italy on the mainland.

The passage then discusses how Italy's unity led to Rome becoming the capital of Italy, which was a significant event. It refers to Rome being the "head of the Italian kingdom," which implies that Rome no longer had the traditional role of the capital but became a kingdom itself. The passage also mentions that Rome's status as a capital was less than Italy because Italy hadn't abandoned its traditional imperial traditions.

Looking back at the options, the question is about when Italy's connections to its history and traditions were most fully snapped. snapped meaning that they were cut off from their history so completely that it wasn't possible anymore.

The key point in the passage is this: "By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast away her Imperial traditions as they were not cast away when brute force made her the head of a French department." So, when Italy became the head of an Italian kingdom, it effectively snapped off its ties to its history and traditions. This is because Rome, in that capacity, no longer had the traditional status as the capital, but Italy was its own entity.

So the event is when Italy became the capital of Italy. Looking at the options, let's look for that. Option C is "Rome became the capital of Italy." So that's when their ties were snapped.

Wait, but the passage also mentions that Italy's army entered Rome (option E) as part of the unification process. But that's a later event, not the one that snapped the ties to history. The main point is when they became the capital, which was the key event in the narrative.

So the correct answer should be option C: Rome became the capital of Italy.

The correct answer is option C: Rome became the capital of Italy. This event marked the most significant snapping of Italy's ties to its history and traditions, as Rome no longer functioned as the capital, effectively ending its historical connections.

Answer: C
