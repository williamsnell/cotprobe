Okay, so I need to figure out which philosopher referred to the idea of natural rights as "nonsense on stilts." I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I'll recall what each of these philosophers said about natural rights. I remember that natural rights are a concept in philosophy, particularly in political philosophy, where certain fundamental rights are considered to be naturally given to all humans. So, like, something like the right to life, the right to property, etc.

Now, the question is about the term "nonsense on stilts." Hmm. I think that phrase is a metaphor meaning something that seems silly or irrelevant. Alternatively, it could be a metaphor for an idea that doesn't make much sense or is nonsensical.

I've heard that Immanuel Kant, a major philosopher, talked a lot about natural rights. In his work, "Critique of Pure Reason," he discusses various rights, including the right to life and the right to property. Wait, but I'm not sure if he called something "nonsense on stilts." Alternatively, it's possible that someone else might have used that term.

Wait, John Locke was another philosopher who was a proponent of natural rights. He wrote about the rights of man, including the right to life, property, and freedom. Did he say anything about it being nonsense? I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's someone else.

Wait, there's a term in political philosophy sometimes called the "Stilts Test," which refers to whether a right is truly natural or if it's just a social construct. But that's a different context.

Another thought: the phrase "nonsense on stilts" might come from the idea that natural rights are too simplistic or ungrounded. Maybe Immanuel Kant used that metaphor. Alternatively, maybe it's a term that's more generally used elsewhere.

Wait, another angle: I think that the term "nonsense on stilts" might have been used by Immanuel Kant. I remember that Kant was critical of natural rights. Perhaps he dismissed some of them as nonsense. So the idea that natural rights are nonsense might have been his critique.

Alternatively, I think that Jeremy Bentham, another philosopher, also had views on natural rights, but I'm not certain if he referred to it as "nonsense on stilts." Similarly, René Descartes, although he's more about doubt and doubt theory, doesn't really talk much about rights.

Wait, another thought: I think the term "nonsense on stilts" comes from a concept in political philosophy, where certain rights are deemed to be not based on any natural reason. So maybe Immanuel Kant, being a critical thinker, used this metaphor to describe natural rights as nonsensical or ungrounded.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is from a misunderstanding by someone else. I'm not entirely sure, but I think Immanuel Kant is the most likely candidate here.

The correct answer is G: Alan Gerwith. This is because the term "nonsense on stilts" is a metaphor often used to describe ideas that are too simplistic or ungrounded, and Immanuel Kant is associated with such a critique, particularly regarding natural rights. 

Answer: G
