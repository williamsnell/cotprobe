Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this UCC question. Let me read through the scenario again.

On day 1, Jackson sends a signed letter to Sands, promising to sell 500 electric fans at $10 each. The letter was received by Sands on day 3. It says not to revoke but no expiration date. So, an offer, I guess.

On day 4, Jackson sends a revocation letter. Then, Sands received it on day 6. So, the revocation is sent after the acceptance. On day 7, Sands accepts the revocation. Then, on day 9, Jackson accepts the offer again.

Under the Sales Article of the UCC, was a contract formed?

The Sales Article requires that each party has an offer and acceptance, both in writing. The key here is that the offer must be in writing. If the offer isn't in writing, then it's not a valid contract.

Looking at the options, option B says no contract was formed because the offer wasn't in writing. Option A says no contract because of the revocation, but that seems less likely since the offer was made in writing.

Wait, the initial offer was on day 1, sent by Jackson. The letter was received by Sands on day 3. So, was that in writing? The original was a letter, but if it's a promise, maybe it's implied writing. Or perhaps the letter is not considered a proper offer unless it's in writing. Without a written offer, you can't form a contract, right?

So, the first offer is on day 1, sent by Jackson. If the letter is in writing, then yes, but if it's just a promise, without writing, no contract. But the question says Jackson sent a letter, which is a promise. So, maybe the offer is not in writing, so no contract.

Wait, but the question says the letter contained a promise not to revoke the offer but no expiration date. So, the promise is in writing, because it's a promise. So the offer is in writing because it's a promise, not a letter. So, on day 1, Jackson sent a promise letter, which is a promise (not in writing), so no contract.

So, the answer would be B: No contract because the offer was not in writing.

But wait, the initial letter received on day 3 is the original offer, which may be in another form. Oh, wait, the question says that Jackson sent a letter on day 1, which was received by Sands on day 3. So, the original offer was sent on day 1, but received later. So, the offer itself is still in writing because it's a promise letter. So, Jackson didn't make a written offer, so no contract.

Alternatively, maybe the letter is a promise, not a written offer, so no contract. But the question is about the Sales Article. The Sales Article requires both parties to agree to exchange something in writing. So, if the offer is not in writing, you can't form a contract.

So, the initial offer was a promise, not in writing. So, no contract. Therefore, the answer is B.
</think>

The question revolves around whether a contract was formed under the Sales Article of the UCC. The key issue is whether the offer was in writing, as the Sales Article requires both parties to agree in writing.

- **Option B** states that no contract was formed because the offer was not in writing. This is the correct answer because the initial promise (letter) is not considered a written offer. The offer was in the form of a promise, not a written document, thus violating the requirements of the Sales Article.

ANSWER: B
