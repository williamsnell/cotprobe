Question:

Which statement best describes the relationship between realist international relations theorists and peace researchers in the early 1960s?

Options:

A: Peace researchers and realists were in full agreement on the focus of their studies, both advocating for a reduction in nuclear arms as the best path to peace.
B: Although peace researchers were critical of the realist focus on military strength, both groups agreed that the Soviet bloc posed a significant threat to Western liberal democracies.
C: Realists and peace researchers shared the same views and advocated for disarmament and peaceful coexistence as the best way to resolve the East-West divide of the Cold War.
D: Whilst peace researchers indentified the escalation of the arms race as a result of failures by the League of Nations, realist scholars deemed it to be the natural progression of ideological differences between the Soviet bloc and Western liberal democracies. This resulted in irreconcilable differences between the study agendas of realists and peace researchers.
E: The East-West divide of the Cold War gave rise to a sharp divide between realists and early peace studies theorists. Whilst realists wished to focus research on that which would favour the survival of Western liberal democracies, advocates of peace studies regarded this approach as being narrow and Western ethnocentric.
F: Both peace researchers and realists advocated an academic focus on the escalation of the arms race. Although tensions existed between the groups in terms of their proposed solutions to this crisis, there existed a consensus that the Soviet bloc should be eliminated as a nuclear threat, thus favouring the survival of Western liberal democracies.
G: Realists and peace researchers had a common goal of promoting peace, but differed significantly in their approaches, with the former advocating for military supremacy and the latter for diplomacy and negotiation.
H: The realist school and peace researchers had minor disagreements on their study agendas, but both believed in the importance of maintaining a balance of power to achieve security.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out which statement best describes the relationship between realist international relations theorists and peace researchers in the early 1960s. Let's break this down.

First, I need to recall what each group is known for. Realist international relations theorists typically focus on the political and social aspects of international relations, often emphasizing conflict resolution, diplomacy, and the historical context. They might advocate for reducing nuclear arms as a means to achieve peace.

Peace researchers, on the other hand, are more academic and might focus on the impact of nuclear arms on peace. They might look at the role of the League of Nations, the Soviet bloc, and other historical factors in international relations.

Looking at the options:

Option A says both focused on reducing nuclear arms. But I'm not sure if both groups were so focused, or if they had differing priorities. I think during the Cold War, there were tensions between the US and the Soviet Union, with the US trying to eliminate the Soviet bloc and the Soviets trying to maintain it. So maybe they were somewhat aligned but each had their own agenda.

Option B: Peace researchers were critical of realist's military focus, but both agreed on the Soviet bloc's threat. So they might have some similarities but different priorities. Peace researchers might focus more on historical context and international relations, while realists focus on military strength and political strategies.

Option C: Realists and peace researchers both advocate for disarmament and peaceful coexistence. That makes sense because both approaches support reducing nuclear arms and promoting mutual respect rather than conflict.

Option D: Peace researchers saw the arms race escalation as the result of the League of Nations failures, while realists thought it was the natural progression. This suggests a conflict in their viewpoints, with peace researchers thinking the arms race was a result of the international system's weaknesses, whereas realists saw it as a natural progression in ideological differences.

Option E: Talks about a sharp divide between realists and early peace studies. I'm not sure about this. Maybe both were interested in international relations, but their approaches were different. Maybe E is suggesting that they had differing opinions but no full disagreement.

Option F: Both focused on the arms race, with both agreeing that the Soviet bloc should be eliminated. This aligns with the Cold War context where both sides were trying to eliminate each other.

Option G: Realists focused on military supremacy, peace researchers on diplomacy and negotiation. That's a clear contrast, which might be accurate since military approaches would be more about supranational dominance, while negotiation and diplomacy focus on resolving conflicts through cooperation.

Option H: Both believed in maintaining a balance of power, but realists focused on military superiority. That's interesting. So they agreed on balance, but their approaches differ.

Now, considering the early 1960s, the Cold War is a good time to look. The US and the Soviet Union were at war, leading to tensions. Realists might have been advocating for reducing arms to prevent the situation, while peace researchers might have focused on the historical impact of the USSR's actions on Western democracies.

Looking at option C: It states that both groups advocate for disarmament and peaceful coexistence. That's a strong statement because these are key principles in both approaches.

Option F also mentions both agreeing on eliminating the Soviet bloc, which is a key point.

Option G's focus on military vs. diplomatic approaches is also correct, but perhaps less directly tied to the early Cold War context.

Wait, the question is about the early 1960s. Realists might have been more focused on military strategies, while peace researchers, especially early ones, might have been more interested in historical diplomatic solutions.

So, which option best describes their relationship? The question is about the best statement about their relationship. Let me review each option again.

Option C says both advocate for disarmament and peaceful coexistence. That's accurate because both approaches focus on reducing nuclear arms and promoting mutual respect.

Option F says both agree on the arms race's escalations leading to eliminating the Soviet bloc, which is a correct historical fact. So both saw the arms race as a result of the Soviet threat, leading to a division in their approaches.

Option D talks about their differing opinions on the arms race's cause. That's another point, but perhaps the question is more about their study agendas rather than the cause.

So, the question is about their relationship, not their views on the cause. The statement that best describes their relationship would be about their study focuses.

Looking at option C, it's about their approaches, not the cause.

Option F is about both agreeing, which is a point. But it's not about their study approaches.

Option D is about differing approaches, but perhaps it's more about the cause.

Wait, the question is about their relationship. So it's about how their study agendas relate.

Option C says both advocate for disarmament and peaceful coexistence. That's accurate. So their approaches were aligned on these points.

Option F says both focused on the arms race, but that's a broader agreement on the cause. But the question is about their study agendas, not their views on the cause.

Looking back, the options are about their study approaches. 

Option C: Both advocate for disarmament and peaceful coexistence.

Option D: They had differing approaches. But that's about the causes, not the study agendas.

So, the correct answer should be C, because it's about the study focus, not the cause.

The correct answer is:

**C: Realists and peace researchers shared the same views and advocated for disarmament and peaceful coexistence as the best way to resolve the East-West divide of the Cold War.**

This option accurately reflects their shared focus on reducing nuclear arms and promoting mutual respect, aligning their study agendas on these key principles.
