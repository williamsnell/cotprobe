Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because osmotic pressure seems a bit tricky. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the molar mass of a protein. The given data is: 3.85 grams of protein dissolved in 250 ml of solvent, and the osmotic pressure is 10.4 mm Hg at 30°C. The options are a bunch of g/mol values, so I guess I need to calculate the molar mass and match it with the options.

Wait, osmotic pressure, right. I remember that the formula for osmotic pressure is π = (nRT)/V, where π is pressure, n is the moles of solute, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and V is the volume. But wait, it's π = (mRT)/(M), where m is the mass, M is molar mass. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think another form is π = (CRT), where C is concentration, which is moles per liter.

Let me think. Oh, right, the formula is π = (nRT)/V, but n/V is concentration (molarity). So n/V is molarity (M). So π = MRT. That makes sense. So molarity is moles per liter.

So rearranging the equation to find molarity: M = π/(RT). But wait, we have π in mmHg. Oh, right, because R is in terms of mmHg if I'm not careful. Let me get the units right. The R constant is usually 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but if the pressure is in mmHg, I might need to convert it.

Wait, another thought: the formula can also be expressed as π = (P)(RT), but I think that's not exactly right. Wait, let's get the correct formula. Osmotic pressure π is given by π = C R T, where C is the concentration in mol/L. And C is n/V. So yes, π = (n/V) * R * T.

So n is the number of moles, which is mass (m) divided by molar mass (M), so n = m/M. So substituting that into the equation, we get π = (m/(M V)) * R T. Solving for M, we have M = (m * R * T) / (π * V).

Wait, but wait, I think I might have messed up the formula. Let me double-check. The osmotic pressure formula is π = MRT, where M is molarity (mol/L). So M = π / (R T). But wait, π is in mmHg, so I need to adjust for that. Alternatively, since R is usually in terms of L·atm/(mol·K), I should convert mmHg to atmospheres.

Right, so 1 atm is 760 mmHg. So 10.4 mmHg is 10.4 /760 atm. Let me compute that: 10.4 /760 is approximately 0.0137 atm. Because 760 is 10 times 76, so 10.4 /760 = 1.04/76 = 0.0137. Yeah, about 0.0137 atm.

So now, calculate M = (m)/(V) * (RT)/(π). Wait, no, let me structure it correctly. The formula is M = π/(R T). But wait, the other way around, because π = M R T → M = π/(R T). Wait, but wait, that can't be right because M is molarity, which is in mol/L, and π is in mmHg. So perhaps I should rearrange the equation correctly.

Wait, let's write the correct formula again. The correct formula for osmotic pressure is π = M * R * T, where M is in mol/L. So M = π/(R T). But wait, units?

Since R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), and T is 30°C which is 303 K.

So putting it all together: M = (π in atm) / (R * T).

Wait, but π is 10.4 mmHg, which is 10.4/760 = 0.0137 atm.

So M = 0.0137 atm / (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 303 K) = 0.0137 / (0.0821 * 303).

Let me compute the denominator first: 0.0821 * 303 ≈ 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63, plus a bit more. 303 is 300+3. So 0.0821 * 3 = 0.2463. So 0.0821 *303 ≈ 24.8623 (approx).

So M ≈ 0.0137 / 24.8623 ≈ 0.000551 mol/L.

Wait, that's a very low concentration, but proteins are typically in solution as such.

Now, since M = 0.000551 mol/L, which is 5.51e-4 mol/L.

But wait, what is M? Oh, right, M is molarity, which is moles per liter. But we have the mass of the protein dissolved: 3.85 grams. So the molarity M is moles per liter. So moles = M * V.

The volume is 250 mL, which is 0.250 L.

So moles of protein = M * V = 0.000551 mol/L * 0.250 L = 0.0001378 mol.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me check the calculation again. Wait, M is 0.0137 / (0.0821 *303) → let's compute that denominator: 0.0821 *303 = 24.8623? Let me compute more accurately.

0.0821 * 300 = 24.63. 0.0821 *3 = 0.2463. So 303 is 300 +3, so 0.0821 * 303 = 24.63 + 0.2463 = 24.8763.

So denominator is 24.8763.

So M = 0.0137 /24.8763 ≈ 0.000552 mol/L. Because 0.0137/24.8763 is approximately 5.52e-4.

Now, moles = M * V = 0.000552 mol/L * 0.250 L = 0.000138 mol.

So, moles = 0.000138 mol.

The mass is 3.85 grams, so Molar mass M_m = mass / moles = 3.85 g / 0.000138 mol ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 3.85 / 0.000138.

Wait, 0.000138 is 1.38e-4. So 3.85 / 1.38e-4 = (3.85 /1.38) *1e4.

Compute 3.85 /1.38: 1.38 *2.78 ≈ 3.8486. So approximately 2.78. So 2.78e4 is 27800 g/mol.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately.

3.85 ÷ 0.000138.

I can write this as (3.85 × 10^4) / 138. Let me compute 38500 /138.

Compute 138 * 278: 138 *200=27600; 138*70=9660 → 27600+9660=37260. 138*8=1104 → 37260+1104=38364. Hmm, 278 *138 = 38364, which is more than 38500. So 278 is 38364, which is 38500-38364=136 more. So 136/138 is about 0.986. So 278.986. So approx 278.986.

Thus, 3.85 / 0.000138 = 278.986 → approximately 279 g/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 27900 g/mol. Oooh, that's a thousand times larger. Oh no, I think I made a mistake with the units. Let me check.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the steps because that would make a big mistake.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe I made an error with the calculation of M.

Let's go back.

Molarity M = π/(R T) → units: mmHg/(atm) * 1/(L·K) → since 1 atm is 760 mmHg, so π in atm is 10.4 mmHg /760 = 0.0137 atm.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

T is 303 K.

So M = (0.0137) / (0.0821 *303) → let me compute denominator: 0.0821 *303 ≈ 24.8663.

So M ≈ 0.0137 /24.8663 → approximately 0.000552 mol/L.

Then moles = M * V = 0.000552 * 0.25 = 0.000138 mol.

So M_m = 3.85 g /0.000138 mol ≈ 3.85 / 0.000138 → same as 3.85 * (1e4)/138 → 38500 /138 = approx 279.0138 g/mol.

Wait, so 279 g/mol. But the options are all in the thousands, like A is 27900. Hmm. Wait, that's a thousand times larger. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the solution's volume is 250 mL, but I used 250 mL as the volume for the solute. Oh wait, no, the 250 mL is the solvent. The solution's volume is different, but for dilute solutions, the volume change is negligible, so we can take it as 250 mL. So perhaps that doesn't affect the calculation much.

Wait, but perhaps I should have considered the total volume as 250 mL + the volume of the protein, but since proteins are small, that's negligible.

So perhaps I didn't make a mistake in the calculation, and the correct molar mass is approximately 279 g/mol. But the options are way higher. So maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, another thought: Oh, wait, I think I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the osmotic pressure formula.

I remember that the formula is π = (n/V) RT, where n is moles, V is volume, R is the gas constant, T is temperature in Kelvin. So, rearranging, n = (π V)/(R T).

But n is also mass divided by molar mass, so n = m / M.

So, M = (m V)/(π V R T) → wait, no. Let me write it again.

n = m/M → π = n R T → m/(M) = π/(R T) → M = m R T / π.

Wait, that's different. Wait, if M = m R T / π → because:

n/V = M → n = M V → so (M V) = n → but n = m/M → M = m/(n) → M = m / (n/V) → M = (m V) /n ? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me do it properly.

Wait, the correct formula: π = (n/V) * R T → n = (π V)/(R T) → n = (m)/(M) → so substituting, m/(M) = (π V)/(R T) → so M = (m R T)/(π V).

Wait, that's different from before. So earlier I had M = π/(R T). But that would be wrong because when I compute M, it would be small, but according to the options, M is in thousands. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have M = (n) / (V), but n is m/M, so M = m/(V (n) )? Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the correct formula again.

Wait, I think I remember that the formula for osmotic pressure is π = i M R T, where i is the van't Hoff factor (for proteins, which are 100% dissociated, i=2). So, since proteins dissociate into two ions, i=2.

So the correct formula should be π = (i M R T), with i=2.

So, π = 2 M R T.

So, M = π / (2 R T).

Let me compute that. So, π is 10.4 mmHg. Convert to atm: 10.4 /760 = 0.0137 atm.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

T is 303 K.

So, M = (0.0137) / (2 * 0.0821 * 303).

Compute denominator: 2 *0.0821= 0.1642; 0.1642 *303 → Let me compute 0.1642 *300 =49.26, 0.1642 *3=0.4926 → total 50. (Wait, 49.26 +0.4926=49.7526.)

So M = 0.0137 /49.7526 ≈ 0.000275 mol/L.

Wait, that's a much lower concentration, which would make the molarity M = 0.000275 mol/L.

So, moles in 250 mL (0.25 L) would be M * V = 0.000275 *0.25 = 0.00006875 mol.

Then, molar mass M_m = mass / moles = 3.85 g / 0.00006875 mol → let's compute that.

3.85 / 0.00006875 = Let me compute this.

Let me write it as (3.85 * 1e5) / 68.75 → 385000 /68.75.

Wait, 68.75 * 5330 = let me compute 68.75 *5000= 343750, 68.75 *330=22762.5 → 343750 +22762.5=366512.5. Hmm, 385000 is a bit higher than that. So 5330 *68.75 = 366512.5. The difference is 385000 - 366512.5= 18487.5. So 18487.5 /68.75 = 269.4? Because 68.75 *269= 18481.25. So 269.4 gives 18487.5.

So total is 5330 +269.4=5599.4 ≈5599.4. So approximately 5599.4 g/mol. Hmm, looking at the options, option G is 32700, which is higher. Wait, but that's in the thousands, which doesn't match.

Wait, this suggests that perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong again.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula when the solution is dilute. Because if the solution is dilute, the volume of the solute compared to the solution is negligible. So for osmotic pressure in dilute solutions, the formula can be approximated as π = M R T, where M is in mol/L. But in that case, M would be very low, leading to a low molar mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula π = M R T, but only considering the solution's volume, not the solute's. That is, M = π/(R T).

Wait, but then π is in mmHg, which I converted to atm by dividing by 760. So, M becomes (10.4 mmHg /760) / (0.0821 * 303).

Wait, let me compute that.

Compute denominator: 0.0821*303 =24.8823.

Then, M = (10.4/760) / 24.8823.

Compute numerator: 10.4/760 = approx 0.0137.

So M = 0.0137 /24.8823 ≈ 0.000552 mol/L.

So, moles in 0.25 L: 0.000552 * 0.25 = 0.000138 mol.

Molar mass M_m =3.85 g /0.000138 mol = approx 27900 g/mol.

Wait, but wait! The options have A as 27900, which is exactly this. So why am I getting that?

Wait, earlier I thought the formula was M = π/(2 R T), which would be 0.0137/(2*0.0821*303) → that would be 0.0137/(49.7) → 0.000275 mol/L. But that would make the molar mass 3.85 / (0.000275 *0.25) → 3.85 / (0.00006875) → around 55,000, which is not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the correct formula, which is π = M R T for the solution, where M is in mol/L. So, M = π/(R T).

But, wait, wait. Let me think about the units again. Because sometimes the formula is written with different units.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is π = M R T, but M is in mol/L, R is in L·atm/(mol·K), and T is in K.

So, solving for M, M = π/(R T).

But π is in atm. So when I have π = 10.4 mmHg, I have to convert it to atm, so 10.4 /760 = 0.0137 atm.

So M = 0.0137 / (0.0821 *303).

Compute denominator: 0.0821 *303 = approx 24.8823.

So M = 0.0137 /24.8823 = approx 5.52e-4 mol/L.

So, M = 0.000552 mol/L.

Moles of protein = M * V = 0.000552 * 0.25 = 0.000138 mol.

Molar mass M_m = 3.85 g / 0.000138 mol = approximately 27900 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option A is 27900 g/mol. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but why did I get a different answer when I thought the formula was M=π/(2 R T)? Because I must have made a mistake in that case.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute that scenario.

If I had used the formula M = π/(2 R T), then M = (0.0137) / (2 *0.0821*303) → 0.0137 / (49.7) → 0.000275 mol/L.

Then, moles would be 0.000275 *0.25 = 0.00006875 mol.

Molar mass would be 3.85 / 0.00006875 → approx 55,900 g/mol.

But that's not any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is π = M R T, where M is in mol/L.

So, M = π/(R T).

So, M= (10.4 mmHg) / (760) / (0.0821 *303).

Which is 0.0137 /24.8823 → 0.000552.

Thus, correct molar mass is 3.85 / (0.000552 *0.25) → 3.85/(0.000138) → 27,900 g/mol.

Which is option A.

So the correct answer is A: 27900 g/mol.
</think>

To determine the molar mass of the protein, we use the formula for osmotic pressure:

\[
\pi = M R T
\]

where:
- \(\pi\) is the osmotic pressure in atm,
- \(M\) is the molarity of the solution in mol/L,
- \(R\) is the gas constant (\(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\)),
- \(T\) is the temperature in Kelvin.

### Step 1: Convert the osmotic pressure to atm
The given osmotic pressure is \(10.4 \, \text{mmHg}\). To convert this to atm:

\[
\pi = \frac{10.4}{760} = 0.0137 \, \text{atm}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve for molarity \(M\)
Rearranging the formula for \(M\):

\[
M = \frac{\pi}{R T}.
\]

Substitute the known values:
- \(\pi = 0.0137 \, \text{atm}\),
- \(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\),
- \(T = 303 \, \text{K}\).

\[
M = \frac{0.0137}{0.0821 \times 303}.
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
0.0821 \times 303 = 24.8823.
\]

Now, calculate \(M\):

\[
M = \frac{0.0137}{24.8823} = 5.52 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mol/L}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the moles of protein
The total volume of the solution is \(250 \, \text{mL} = 0.250 \, \text{L}\). The moles of protein are:

\[
\text{Moles} = M \times V = 5.52 \times 10^{-4} \times 0.250 = 1.38 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the molar mass \(M_m\)
The molar mass is given by:

\[
M_m = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Moles}} = \frac{3.85}{1.38 \times 10^{-4}}.
\]

Perform the division:

\[
M_m = \frac{3.85}{0.000138} = 27,900 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Step 5: Match the result with the options
The calculated molar mass is \(27,900 \, \text{g/mol}\), which corresponds to **Option A**.

ANSWER: A
