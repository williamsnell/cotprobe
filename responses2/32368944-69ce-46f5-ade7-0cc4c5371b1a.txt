Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that a sample of carbon dioxide (CO₂) expands reversibly and adiabatically. It starts at 57.4 kPa and 1.0 dm³, and expands to a final volume of 2.0 dm³. They want the final pressure, and we're supposed to take gamma (γ) as 1.4. The options are given, so I'll have to compute the final pressure and match it to one of them.

Wait, right, for an adiabatic process of an ideal gas, especially for a reversible process, there's a specific formula I remember. Since it's a reversible adiabatic expansion, the process is adiabatic and reversible, so I can use the adiabatic equations.

The key formula I recall is for pressure and volume. For an adiabatic process, PV^γ = constant. So, the initial state is P1, V1, and final is P2, V2. So, P1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, because when the gas expands, the volume increases, and pressure should decrease. So, since V increases, P must decrease. So, the equation makes sense because if V increases (exponent γ is positive), then V2^gamma is larger than V1^gamma. So, P2 would be smaller than P1, which matches what I expect.

So, let's plug in the numbers. P1 is 57.4 kPa, V1 is 1.0 dm³, V2 is 2.0 dm³. γ is 1.4.

So, the equation is P2 = P1 * (V1/V2)^γ.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. Since PV^γ = constant, then:

P1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ.

So, solving for P2: P2 = P1 * (V1/V2)^γ.

Wait, or is it (V2/V1)^γ? Let's see, rearranging the equation:

P2 = P1 * (V1/V2)^γ.

Wait, if V increases, V2 > V1, so (V1/V2) is less than 1. So, (V1/V2)^γ is less than 1, so P2 is less than P1. That's correct because pressure decreases when volume increases.

So, substituting the numbers:

P2 = 57.4 kPa * (1.0 / 2.0)^1.4.

Let me compute (1/2)^1.4. Let's see. 1/2 is 0.5. Let's compute 0.5^1.4.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using logarithms or natural exponents, but maybe it's easier to use a calculator approximation. Alternatively, I can remember that ln(0.5) is approximately -0.6931. So, taking ln(0.5^1.4) = 1.4 * ln(0.5) = 1.4 * (-0.6931) ≈ -0.9703.

So, 0.5^1.4 ≈ e^(-0.9703) ≈ e^-0.97 is about 0.377. Let me get a better approximation.

Using a calculator: 0.5^1.4 = (1/2)^1.4. Let's compute 1.4 log(0.5). Wait, perhaps I should compute it differently.

Alternatively, let's compute 0.5^1.4. Let's break it down:

0.5^1 = 0.5.

0.5^0.4: Hmm, 0.4 is 2/5. So, 0.5^0.4 = e^(0.4 * ln(0.5)) = e^(0.4*(-0.6931))= e^(-0.2772) ≈ 0.758.

So, 0.5^(1.4) = 0.5^1 * 0.5^0.4 = 0.5 * 0.758 = 0.379.

So, approximately 0.379.

So, P2 = 57.4 * 0.379 ≈ let's calculate that.

57.4 * 0.379.

Well, 57 * 0.379 is 57 * 0.3 is 17.1, 57 * 0.079 is approximately 4.503, so total around 21.6. But wait, the 0.4 is 0.4, so we need to add 0.4 * 0.379, which is approximately 0.1516.

So, 57.4 * 0.379 = 21.6 + 0.1516 = 21.7516 kPa.

Wait, that's about 21.8 kPa. Looking at the options, option C is 22 kPa. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, wait a second. Let me verify: the formula is P2 = P1*(V1/V2)^γ. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the formula was rearranged:

P2 = P1 * (V1/V2)^γ.

Wait, that's correct. So, 57.4 * (0.5)^1.4 ≈ 57.4 * 0.377 ≈ let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 57.4 * 0.377.

Let me compute 57.4 * 0.3 = 17.22, 57.4 * 0.07 = 4.018, 57.4 * 0.007 = 0.4018.

Adding those: 17.22 +4.018 = 21.238, plus 0.4018 gives 21.6398 kPa, which is approximately 21.64 kPa. The closest option is C: 22 kPa.

But wait, the options don't have 21.8. Oh, the options are A-F, etc. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options start from A) 18, B)28, then C)22, D)45, E)40, F)15, G)20, H)30, I)25, J)35.

So, option C is 22 kPa. So, I think that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, wait a second. No, wait. Wait, no, wait a second. The formula I used is correct? Let me double-check the formula.

The formula for adiabatic reversible expansion is P1 V1^γ = P2 V2^γ.

So, P2 = P1 * (V1/V2)^γ.

Wait, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, if the process is expansion, then the volume increases. So, V2 > V1, so V1/V2 is less than 1. So, (V1/V2)^gamma is less than 1, so P2 is less than P1.

But wait, another point: when a gas expands adiabatically, it does work on the surroundings, so the internal energy decreases. So, maybe the relationship is different.

Wait, but let me get back. Let me compute (1/2)^1.4 accurately.

Wait, compute 0.5^1.4 exactly. Let's compute 0.5^1 is 0.5, 0.5^0.4 is as earlier 0.758. So, 0.5 * 0.758 is 0.379. So, 0.379 is about 0.379.

So, 57.4 * 0.379 ≈ 21.75 kPa, which is about 22 kPa, option C.

Wait, but wait another moment. Alternatively, I might have mixed up the formula. Another approach: sometimes, people use the relation P2 = P1 * (V1/V2)^(gamma).

Wait, but in our case, V2 is larger, so this method gives us P2 = P1 * (0.5)^(gamma).

Which is same as P2 = P1 * (0.5)^gamma.

Which is same as before. So, 57.4 * (0.5)^1.4 ≈ 21.75.

Looking at the options, C is 22. So, that's the answer.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, wait, no. The formula is correct: for adiabatic expansion, P1 V1^gamma = P2 V2^gamma.

So, solving for P2: P2 = P1 * (V1/V2)^gamma.

Wait, so that's correct. So, option C is 22 kPa.

So, the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we use the adiabatic equation for reversible processes:

\[
P_1 V_1^\gamma = P_2 V_2^\gamma
\]

Rearranging to solve for \(P_2\):

\[
P_2 = P_1 \left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)^\gamma
\]

### Given Data:
- Initial pressure: \(P_1 = 57.4 \, \text{kPa}\)
- Initial volume: \(V_1 = 1.0 \, \text{dm}^3\)
- Final volume: \(V_2 = 2.0 \, \text{dm}^3\)
- \(\gamma = 1.4\)

### Calculation:
1. Compute the volume ratio:
   \[
   \frac{V_1}{V_2} = \frac{1.0}{2.0} = 0.5
   \]

2. Calculate \((0.5)^\gamma\):
   \[
   (0.5)^{1.4} \approx 0.379
   \]

3. Substitute into the formula for \(P_2\):
   \[
   P_2 = 57.4 \, \text{kPa} \times 0.379 \approx 21.75 \, \text{kPa}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The final pressure is approximately \(21.8 \, \text{kPa}\), which matches option **C: 22 kPa**.
