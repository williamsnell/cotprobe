Okay, so I have this question about the wavelength of a 10-eV electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember something about the de Broglie equation. Oh right, the wavelength of a particle is given by lambda equals h over momentum, which is lambda = h/(mv). But wait, for electrons, I think they use the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, right, the formula is lambda equals h/(mv) or lambda equals h/(p), where p is the momentum. But wait, momentum is mass times velocity, so p = mv. Or wait, another way: since the momentum p is also equal to h/(lambda), so lambda is h over p. So another approach is using the equation lambda = h/(sqrt(2mE)), where E is the kinetic energy.

Wait, let me get the units right. The energy is given in electronvolts. I think I need to convert that into joules because the formula uses SI units. But wait, there's a shortcut using the constant 1/(e * c) where e is the charge in coulombs and c the speed of light. Oh right, the relation is lambda (in meters) = h/(e c E), but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Another approach: I remember that the formula for the wavelength in terms of energy is lambda = h*c/(sqrt(2*m_e*E)), where m_e is the mass of the electron. But I might have the formula wrong. Alternatively, using the relation E = (h c)/(lambda), so lambda = h c / E. But wait, I think E is in electronvolts, and when using the formula, E has to be in joules. Or perhaps there's a conversion factor involving eV and the constants to make it easier.

Wait, I think I remember a specific formula for electron wavelength in terms of energy. Oh, I think it's lambda = h/(sqrt(2 * m_e * E)), but maybe it's h/(sqrt(2 * m_e * E)) or something else. Alternatively, another version is lambda = h c / (sqrt(2 m_e E)), but the units have to be compatible.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula involving the reduced Planck's constant. The correct formula is λ = (h) / (p), where p is the momentum. But p can be expressed as sqrt(2 m E), since kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), so p = sqrt(2 m E).

So substituting, λ = h / (sqrt(2 m E)).

But wait, sometimes I've seen the formula written as λ = h / (sqrt(2 m_e E)), but let me make sure about the constants. Oh right, the reduced Planck constant is h/(2 pi), but when we use the formula, sometimes it's simplified. Alternatively, another approach is to remember that for an electron with kinetic energy E (in eV), the wavelength λ (in Angstroms) can be approximately calculated using λ ≈ h/(13.6 eV * Z), but wait, that's when Z is atomic number, but for electrons, Z is effectively 1 (like in the ground state of hydrogen). Wait, but that formula is more for hydrogen-like atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, I remember the formula: lambda (in Angstroms) = h c / (13.6 eV * Z), but again, Z is 1 here because it's an electron. So lambda = (6.626e-34 J s * 3e8 m/s) / (13.6 eV * 1). Wait, but 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. So let me compute this:

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

So (1.9878e-25 J m) / (13.6 eV * 1.6e-19 J/eV) )= (1.9878e-25) / (2.176e-18) ) meters.

Wait, let's compute that.

1.9878e-25 / 2.176e-18 = approximately (1.9878 / 2.176) * 1e-7 meters. 1.9878/2.176 ≈ 0.91, so about 0.91e-7 meters, which is 9.1e-8 meters. Wait, but that's meters. To convert to Angstroms (1e-10 meters), divide by 1e-10: 9.1e-8 / 1e-10 = 910 Angstroms. That can't be right, because 10 eV should correspond to a wavelength much shorter than that. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, I think I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Oh! Wait, another approach: The de Broglie wavelength for an electron is given by lambda = h / (sqrt(2 * m_e * E)), but E is in joules. Let's plug in the numbers.

m_e is the mass of an electron: 9.109e-31 kg.

E is 10 eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E = 1.602e-19 * 10 = 1.602e-18 J.

So lambda = h/(sqrt(2 * m_e * E))

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

Compute 2 * m_e * E: 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-18 J.

Wait, J is kg m²/s². So 2 * m_e * E is 2*9.109e-31 *1.602e-18 = let's compute that.

Wait, 2 *9.109e-31 is 1.8218e-30. Multiply by 1.602e-18.

1.8218e-30 *1.602e-18 = 2.918e-48 kg m²/s²? Because 1.8218e-30 *1.602e-18 = (1.8218 * 1.602) )e-48.

1.8218 * 1.602 ≈ 2.918. So 2.918e-48.

So the square root of that is sqrt(2.918e-48) = approx 1.708e-24 kg m/s.

Wait, because sqrt(1e-48) is 1e-24. Since 2.918 is about 2.92, sqrt(2.92) is about 1.708. So sqrt(2.918e-48) = 1.708e-24.

So lambda = h / (1.708e-24 )

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

So 6.626e-34 / 1.708e-24 = (6.626 / 1.708) * 1e-10 meters.

6.626 /1.708 ≈ 3.88.

So 3.88e-10 meters is the wavelength. 3.88e-10 meters is 0.388 nanometers. Wait, that's 3.88 Angstroms because 1 nm = 10 Angstroms. Wait, no, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 0.388 nm is 3.88 Angstroms.

Looking at the options, option B is 3.86 Angstroms. So the answer should be B.

Alternatively, I remember that the characteristic X-ray wavelength of krypton is about 3.86 Angstroms. Wait, but wait, X-rays are higher energy, so 10 eV would correspond to lower energy. Let me think—higher energy electrons have shorter wavelengths. So 10 eV should correspond to a wavelength a bit shorter than 1 nm (which is 10 A). Hmm, 3.86 A is much shorter, so probably correct.

Another way to think is to use the formula lambda = 12.39 / sqrt(E) Angstroms, but I'm not sure. Wait wait, wait, I recall that the formula for electron wavelength (in Angstroms) is lambda = 12.39 / sqrt(E) when E is in eV. Let me check that.

Wait, if E is 10 eV, then 12.39 / sqrt(10) ≈ 12.39 / 3.162 ≈ 3.91 Angstroms. Oh wait, that's about 3.91, which matches option B (3.86). So yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the wavelength of a 10-eV electron, we use the de Broglie equation, which relates the wavelength \( \lambda \) to the momentum \( p \) of the particle:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\]

For an electron, the momentum \( p \) can be expressed as:

\[
p = \sqrt{2 m_e E}
\]

where \( m_e \) is the mass of the electron and \( E \) is the kinetic energy in joules. Substituting this into the de Broglie equation gives:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2 m_e E}}
\]

Here, \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( m_e \) is the electron mass, and \( E \) is the kinetic energy in joules. Converting the energy from electronvolts (eV) to joules:

\[
E = 10 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

The mass of the electron is \( m_e = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \), and Planck's constant is \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s} \). Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{\sqrt{2 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-18}}}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-18}} = \sqrt{2.918 \times 10^{-48}} \approx 1.708 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg m/s}
\]

Now, divide \( h \) by this value:

\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.708 \times 10^{-24}} \approx 3.88 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}
\]

Convert this to Angstroms (1 Å = \( 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)):

\[
\lambda \approx 3.88 \, \text{Å}
\]

This matches option **B (3.86 Å)**. Additionally, the formula \( \lambda = \frac{12.39}{\sqrt{E}} \, \text{Å} \) for electrons in eV confirms the result:

\[
\lambda = \frac{12.39}{\sqrt{10}} \approx 3.91 \, \text{Å}
\]

The slight discrepancy is due to rounding. Both methods yield a wavelength of approximately 3.86 Å.
