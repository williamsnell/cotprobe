Question:

A model of a proposed low-speed crop-dusting plane is to be tested in a wind tunnel capable of maintaining velocities of 264 ft/s, using atmospheric air. The prototype plane has a design wing span of 27 ft and a proposed speed of 88 ft/s. In order to preserve dynamic similarity, what should be the wing span of the model if the wind tunnel is to operate at full speed? Assume the air at these low velocities to be essentially incompressible. In addition, assume that the temperature of atmospheric air and the temperature of the wind-tunnel air are the same.

A: 9 ft
B: 30 ft
C: 3 ft
D: 6 ft
E: 15 ft
F: 21 ft
G: 12 ft
H: 18 ft

Okay, so I've got this problem about model testing in a wind tunnel. Hmm, dynamic similarity. Right, because it's about preserving similarity when scaling models. So I remember that when you scale a model, you have to make sure all the dynamic similarity criteria are met. The main ones are velocity, density, and pressure. But wait, the problem says the air is essentially incompressible, and temperatures are the same. Oh, wait, incompressible means density doesn't change much, but I'm not sure how that affects the scaling.

Wait, the problem says the prototype's speed is 88 ft/s, and the wind tunnel is at full speed of 264 ft/s. Oh, because full speed meaning the model will operate at the same speed as the tunnel? Or is the tunnel's speed the same as the prototype's? Wait, I think dynamic similarity requires that the ratio of velocities is the same as the ratio of speeds. Or maybe it's that the speeds are scaled so that the dynamic pressure matches.

Wait, no. Dynamic similarity requires that all the relevant dimensionless parameters are the same. The key is the velocity ratio. Because in wind tunnel, you're simulating the same dynamic conditions as the full-scale scenario. So, the velocity in the wind tunnel is the prototype's operating speed, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the model is the proposed crop-dusting plane, which is to be tested in a wind tunnel. So the wind tunnel is designed to mimic the full-scale conditions. So the wind tunnel is set to operate at full speed, which is 264 ft/s. So the model's actual speed when it's operating will be the same as the wind tunnel's speed. So the model's speed is 88 ft/s. So the ratio of prototype speed to model speed is 88/264 = 1/3.

Wait, but wait, no. Because in dynamic similarity, the velocities are scaled such that the ratio of dynamic pressures is equal. Or perhaps velocity is scaled as (prototype speed)/(tunnel speed). Because the dynamic pressure is (1/2) rho V^2, and to maintain similarity, the ratio of velocities squared must be equal to the ratio of dynamic pressures. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Dynamic similarity requires that the ratio of dynamic pressures (or velocities) is the same as the ratio of the actual conditions. Oh, right, the formula for dynamic similarity is V_p / V_t = sqrt( (rho_p * V_p^2) / (rho_t * V_t^2) ). Or using velocity similarity, V_p / V_t = (rho_p / rho_t)^(1/2) * (V_p / V_t)^1 ), which isn't making sense. Wait, no. The model's velocity should be scaled so that (V_p / V_t) = (rho_p / rho_t)^(1/2) * (V_p / V_t). Wait no, perhaps not the right way.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me approach it methodically. The problem states that the air is incompressible, so density is the same as in the prototype. So rho_p = rho_t. Therefore, the dynamic similarity conditions reduce to the velocity ratio. Because for incompressible flow, the pressure ratio only depends on velocity ratio squared. So the velocity ratio is the same as the model's speed to prototype's speed?

Wait, if the velocity ratio V_m / V_p = V_t / V_p, because V_p is the prototype speed. Wait, no, no, I think the correct approach is that the dynamic similarity requires that the ratio of the dynamic pressures is equal to the ratio of the dynamic pressures in the prototype and the model. So (q_p / q_t) = (V_p^2 / V_t^2). But since the air is incompressible, rho_p = rho_t, so q_p / q_t = (V_p^2) / (V_t^2).

But wait, q is dynamic pressure, which is (1/2) rho v^2. So q_p = (1/2) rho_p v_p^2, q_t = (1/2) rho_t v_t^2. So the ratio q_p / q_t = (v_p^2) / (v_t^2), assuming rho_p = rho_t.

But for dynamic similarity, the ratio of dynamic pressures should be equal. So (q_p / q_t) = (v_p^2 / v_t^2) must equal (q_m / q_t) = (v_m^2 / v_t^2), where v_m is the model's speed.

Wait, but wait: in the model, the speed is v_m, and the tunnel is at speed v_t. So to maintain the same dynamic pressure, the model's speed should be scaled such that v_m / v_t = (q_m / q_t)^(1/2) = ( (1/2 rho v_m^2)/(1/2 rho v_t^2) )^(1/2) ) = (v_m / v_t). So that doesn't change anything.

Wait, but I think I'm getting tangled. Let's think about the basic formula for dynamic similarity when the medium is incompressible. The velocity ratio is the same as the ratio of the speeds. Because for incompressible flow, the density is constant, so the pressure is proportional to the square of the velocity (for incompressible inviscid flow, Bernoulli's equation tells us that pressure is inversely proportional to velocity squared, but when you're scaling, the ratio of pressures is velocity ratio squared.

Wait, but for dynamic similarity, the velocity ratio is what's important. So the velocity in the model should be such that (v_m / v_p) = (v_t / v_p). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because v_t is the tunnel's speed. Wait, the model's speed is v_m, and the tunnel is at v_t.

So, the ratio of the model's speed to the prototype's speed is v_m / v_p = (v_t) / (v_p). Wait, that can't be right. Because if v_t is the tunnel speed, which is higher than the prototype's speed, then v_m would be higher than v_p.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's think of the model as a scaled version of the prototype. The prototype is operating at speed V_p and the model operates at V_m. The tunnel is at V_t. So to maintain similarity, the ratio of V_m to V_t must equal the ratio of V_p to V_t. Wait, no, that would mean V_m = V_p * (V_t / V_t) ) = V_p. That can't be right. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Alternative approach: the formula for dynamic similarity is V_p / V_t = (v_m / v_t) * (rho_p / rho_t)^(1/2). But since rho_p = rho_t, this reduces to V_p / V_t = v_m / V_t. Which implies v_m = V_p. But that's the prototype's speed. But that can't be right because the model is a scaled-down version. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the model's dimensions. The prototype's wing span is 27 ft, and the model's is to be determined. The ratio of lengths is same as the ratio of speeds, but scaled down by the same ratio as the model's dimensions.

Wait, but when scaling, the length scale is L_m / L_p = v_m / v_p. Because in similar models, the linear dimensions scale inversely with the square root of the velocity ratio. Or wait, the correct scaling is that the length scale is proportional to sqrt(velocity ratio). Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: if the flow is incompressible and dynamic similarity, then the ratio of the model's length to prototype's length is equal to the square root of (velocity ratio of model to prototype). So, L_m / L_p = sqrt( (v_m) / (v_p) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The dimensionless parameters must be the same. The main ones are the velocity and the density. Since the air is incompressible, density is same. So the velocity must be same in model and prototype scaled down.

Wait, no, because the model's speed is much lower than prototype. So velocity must be scaled down. So the model's speed is v_m = (V_p) * (v_t / V_p ). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait: the model operates at the same speed as the tunnel. So v_m = v_t.

Wait, but that can't be right because the model is a scaled version. If the tunnel is at 264 ft/s and the model is scaled, then the model's speed should be lower. Wait, but the question says the prototype is operating at 88 ft/s. So, the model's operating speed is 88 ft/s, and the tunnel is at 264 ft/s.

So to maintain dynamic similarity, the velocity ratio must be same as the prototype's speed to tunnel speed. Because the model is operating at 88, and tunnel at 264. So, the ratio is 88 / 264 = 1/3.

So the model's speed is 1/3 of the prototype's speed. But that can't be right because the model is a scaled version. Wait, no, because the model's speed will be 88 ft/s, but the tunnel is at 264 ft/s. So the velocity ratio in the model is 88/264 = 1/3. So, the model's velocity should be 1/3 of the prototype's velocity, but in this case, the model's velocity is 88 ft/s which is 1/3 of the prototype's 264 ft/s.

Wait, but wait, in dynamic similarity, the velocity ratio in the model should match the velocity ratio of the prototype operating in the tunnel. So, (v_m / v_p) = (v_t / v_p). So, v_m = v_t * (v_p / v_p) ) = v_t. But that can't be correct because the model would then have the same speed as the tunnel. But the model is a scaled-down version. So I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the model's speed (v_m) is scaled down by the same ratio as the prototype's speed (v_p) compared to the tunnel speed (v_t). So, the scale factor is (v_m) / (v_p) = (v_t) / (v_p) = 1/3. So v_m = (v_t) * ( v_p / v_t ) ) = v_p. But that's the prototype's speed, but the model is smaller. So that can't be correct.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to use the model's speed to determine the scaling factor. The model's speed is 88 ft/s, the prototype is 264 ft/s. So the model is scaled by a factor of 88/264 = 1/3. So the model's all linear dimensions are 1/3 of the prototype's. So the wing span of the model would be 27 ft * (1/3) = 9 ft. That's one of the options, option A.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the model is scaled down by 1/3, then all its dimensions are 1/3, including the wing span. So the model's wing span is 9 ft.
</think>

To determine the wing span of the model, we need to ensure dynamic similarity between the prototype and the wind tunnel. Dynamic similarity requires that the velocity ratio in the model matches the velocity ratio in the prototype operating at the tunnel speed. The prototype operates at a speed of 264 ft/s, and the model operates at a speed of 88 ft/s. The velocity ratio is therefore:

\[
\frac{v_m}{v_p} = \frac{88}{264} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

This velocity ratio indicates that the model is scaled down by a factor of \( \frac{1}{3} \) compared to the prototype. Since the model's wing span is proportional to its linear dimensions, the wing span of the model is:

\[
\text{Wing span of model} = \text{Wing span of prototype} \times \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Substituting the prototype's wing span of 27 ft:

\[
\text{Wing span of model} = 27 \, \text{ft} \times \frac{1}{3} = 9 \, \text{ft}.
\]

Thus, the wing span of the model is 9 ft.
