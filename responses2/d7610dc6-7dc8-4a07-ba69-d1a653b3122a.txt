Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about calculating the principal of a loan. The bank approved a loan with a 6% interest rate for 90 days, and the interest charge is $36. I need to find the principal amount.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, I remember that interest can be calculated in different ways, like simple interest or maybe compound interest. But the question doesn't specify, so I might have to assume simple interest here. Simple interest is calculated using the formula I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal, R is the rate, and T is the time in years.

So, plugging in the numbers I have: I is $36, R is 6%, which is 0.06 in decimal. The time is 90 days, but I need to convert that into years because the rate is annual. 90 days divided by 365 days in a year is approximately 0.246575 years. Let me double-check that calculation. 90 ÷ 365 is roughly 0.246575. Yeah, that seems right.

So, the formula becomes 36 = P * 0.06 * 0.246575. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, T is 90/365, but maybe I should express it as a fraction. Let me think: 90 divided by 365 is 18/73, which is approximately 0.246575. So, the equation is 36 = P * 0.06 * (90/365). Let me compute 0.06 * (90/365) first.

Calculating 90/365: 90 ÷ 365 equals approximately 0.246575. Then 0.06 multiplied by 0.246575. Let's do that: 0.06 * 0.246575 = around 0.0147945. So the equation is 36 = P * 0.0147945.

To find P, I divide both sides by 0.0147945. So P = 36 ÷ 0.0147945. Let me calculate that. 36 divided by 0.0147945. Hmm, let's see. 0.0147945 is approximately 1.47945e-2. So 36 ÷ 0.0147945 is roughly the same as 36 * (1 / 0.0147945). 

Wait, maybe I can calculate it step by step. 36 ÷ 0.0147945. Let me think of it as 36 ÷ (approx 0.0147945). Let's compute 0.0147945 × 2400 = let's see, 0.0147945 * 2400. 0.0147945 * 2400 = around 35.5068. That's close to 36. So 2400 * 0.0147945 ≈35.5068. But I need 36, which is a bit more. So maybe 2400 plus a little. Let me compute 36 / 0.0147945.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 36 / 0.0147945 exactly. Let me do that.

Wait, 0.0147945 * 2400 = 35.5068 as I thought. So 35.5068 is less than 36. The difference is 0.4932. So how much more do I need to add to 2400 to get the next 0.4932/0.0147945 ≈33. So perhaps 2433, but that can't be right. Wait, no, wait: I think I'm getting confused. Wait, perhaps I should compute 36 ÷ 0.0147945.

Let me try 36 ÷ 0.0147945. So, 0.0147945 goes into 36 how many times? Let's compute 36 / 0.0147945.

Hmm, perhaps I can use a calculator approach. Let's think of it as 36 divided by 0.0147945. Alternatively, I can approximate this.

Wait, 0.0147945 is approximately 1.47945e-2. So 36 / (1.47945e-2) = 36 * (1/(1.47945e-2)) = 36 * (100/1.47945) = 36 * 67.646 (approximate value of 100/1.47945). Let's calculate 100 ÷ 1.47945.

1.47945 × 67 is 1.47945 *60= 88.767, 1.47945 *7=10.35615, total 99.12315. So 67 gives 99.12315, which is less than 100. The difference is 0.87685. So 0.87685 ÷1.47945 ≈0.5935. So total 67.5935. So approximately 67.5935.

Thus, 36 * 67.5935 = let's compute that.

36 *60 = 2160; 36 *7=252; 36 *0.5935≈21.366. So 2160+252=2412, plus 21.366 gives 2433.366. So approximately 2433.37.

Wait, but that's way higher than the options given. The options are all in the thousands except for option J as 3200. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 90 days is the time. So T is 90/365. Let me compute 90 divided by 365 again. 365 × 0.246575 = 90. So that's correct. So T is 0.246575 years.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise approach. Let me write the equation again:

I = P * R * T

36 = P * 0.06 * (90/365)

Compute 90/365 = 0.2465753425.

So 0.06 * 0.2465753425 = ?

0.06 × 0.2465753425 = 0.01479452055.

So 36 = P * 0.01479452055.

So P = 36 / 0.01479452055.

Now, let me compute that division.

36 ÷ 0.01479452055.

Hmm, let's compute 36 / 0.01479452055.

Let me think: 0.0147945 is approximately 1.47945e-2.

So 36 ÷ 1.47945e-2 = 36 * (1e2 /1.47945) = 36 * (100/1.47945) ≈36 *67.646.

Wait, 100/1.47945 is approximately 67.646, so 36 *67.646 ≈2434.656.

Wait, that's 2434.656, which is approximately $2435. But none of the options is close to that. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: $3000

B: $2600

C: $2200

D: $2800

E: $3200

F: $2000

G: $2100

H: $1800

I: $2500

J: $2400

Wait, none of these options is 2435. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated as simple interest, but maybe the question is using compound interest. Let me try that approach.

With compound interest, the formula is A = P(1 + R)^T, but the interest is A - P. Wait, but the problem says the charge is $36, which is the interest. So, in that case, if it's compound interest, the interest is interest = P * [(1 + R)^T - 1]. But I don't know if the question specifies that.

Wait, the question is ambiguous. It just says "interest charge." In business contexts, sometimes it's simple interest, sometimes compound. But without more info, perhaps the question is assuming simple interest.

Wait, but the options don't have any number near 2435. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Wait, 90 days, so 90/365 is correct. Let me try to compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the formula to find P.

P = I / (R * T)

I is 36, R is 0.06, T is 90/365.

So P = 36 / (0.06 * (90/365)).

Compute denominator: 0.06 * (90/365) = 0.06 * 0.2465753425 ≈0.01479452055.

So, 36 / 0.01479452055 ≈2434.656.

Wait, that's the same as before. So none of the options match this value. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, wait a second, wait a minute. Maybe the problem is about an annual interest rate, not a monthly or another compounding period. Wait, no, the question says it's for 90 days, and the rate is 6% for 90 days. So perhaps the annual rate is 6%, so 6% per year, and the time is 90 days. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 36 divided by (0.06 * (90/365)) again.

Wait, 90/365 is 0.2465753425.

0.06 * 0.2465753425 = 0.01479452055.

So 36 / 0.01479452055 = ?

Let me compute that division more accurately.

36 ÷ 0.01479452055.

I can think of 0.01479452055 as approximately 0.0147945. Let me compute 36 / 0.0147945.

So 0.0147945 × 2433 = ?

Wait, 0.0147945 * 2433.

Wait, 0.0147945 * 2400 = 35.5068.

0.0147945 * 33 = 0.4886205.

Adding 35.5068 + 0.4886205 = 36.0 (approximately), but I think I'm getting close.

Wait, but when I multiply 0.0147945 by 2433, let me calculate.

0.0147945 * 2433.

Well, 0.01 *2433=24.33.

0.0047945 *2433.

0.004 *2433=9.732.

0.0007945 *2433≈1.937.

Adding all: 24.33 +9.732=34.062 +1.937≈36.0.

So 0.0147945 *2433≈36. So 2433 would give 36 when multiplied by 0.0147945. But wait, earlier calculation when I did the division gave around 2434.656. So maybe 2434.656 is the correct value of P.

But none of the options is close to 2435. Hmm. Looking at the options, option J is 2400. So perhaps I made a mistake in the computation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the time calculation. Let me check.

Wait, 90 days is 3 months. If the bank uses a 30-day month approximation, 90 days would be 3 months, but usually, it's 365 days, so 90/365 is correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute it as 90/365 = 0.2465753425.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Wait, wait, let me recompute 36 divided by (0.06 * (90/365)).

Compute 0.06 * (90/365) = 0.06 * 90 =5.4; 5.4 ÷365 = 0.01479452. So 36 ÷ 0.01479452 = ?

Let me do this division step by step.

36 ÷ 0.01479452 ≈ ?

Let me think of this as 36 ÷ (1.479452 ×10^-2) = 36 × (10^2 /1.479452) ≈36 ×67.646 ≈2434.656.

Hmm, but the options don't have this value. So perhaps the question is trickier than I thought.

Wait, maybe the interest is simple interest for 90 days, but the time is calculated as 90/360 instead of 365. Let me see what that would give.

If T is 90/360 = 0.25 years.

Then, 0.06 * 0.25 = 0.015.

So, P =36 /0.015= 2400.

Ah, that's an option, option I is 2500, J is 2400. So 2400 would be the answer if T was 90/360 instead of 365.

But the question says "90 days," which is ambiguous about the basis. But, in banking, when the exact number of days is given, unless specified, it's usually 365 days. So 90/365 is correct.

But then the answer isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps the interest is not based on 365 days but on a different calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, 90 days is 3 months. If I calculate the annual interest rate as 6% per year, then for 90 days, the interest would be (90/365)*6% of the principal. So, the interest formula is I = P * (R * T), where T is the fraction of the year.

So, I = P * (0.06 * (90/365)).

Which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it again accurately.

36 ÷ (0.06 * (90/365)).

Compute denominator:

0.06 * (90/365) = 0.06 * (90 ÷ 365) = 0.06 * 0.2465753425 = 0.01479452055.

So, 36 ÷ 0.01479452055 = ?

Let me compute this division.

How many times does 0.01479452055 go into 36?

Well, 0.01479452055 * 2434 ≈36.

Wait, perhaps the correct P is 2400, which is option J.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me see:

If 0.01479452 * 2434 = 36.

Wait, 0.01479452 * 2434 = ?

Compute 0.01479452 * 2400 = 35.506848.

Then, 0.01479452 *34 = 0.49899368.

Adding 35.506848 +0.49899368=36.00584168, which is approximately 36.006. So yes, 2434 would give about 36.006 when multiplied by 0.01479452.

So, 2434 is the principal.

But the options don't have 2434. However, option J is 2400. So perhaps the answer is J.

But why is 2400 an option when the calculation leads to approximately 2434? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using an annual rate but compounding daily, but that would complicate the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the bank might use the exact number of days for interest calculation, but that's not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended the interest to be 6% per annum, and the time is 90 days, which is 90/360 = 0.25 years. So then, I = P * 0.06 *0.25 = 0.015 P.

Then, P = I /0.015 =36 /0.015=2400. So option J.

But earlier I thought the time is 90/365. So, which is correct?

If the question says 90 days, the time is 90/365.

If the bank uses a 360-day year, then the time is 90/360=0.25.

But the question doesn't specify whether to use 360 or 365 days. So perhaps the question is expecting the 360-day basis.

So, if that's the case, the principal is 2400, which is option J.

But earlier calculation with 365 days gives P≈2434.656, which isn't an option.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the interest is calculated using a 360-day year, making the principal 2400.

So, the correct answer would be J: $2400.

But wait, the question is ambiguous. So, perhaps the intended answer is J.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation, and the correct answer is J.

So, given the options, I'm inclined to choose J: $2400.
</think>

The correct answer is J: $2400.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - The loan period is 90 days.
   - The interest rate is 6% per annum.
   - We need to find the principal amount (P).

2. **Determine the appropriate time factor:**
   - If the bank uses a 360-day year, the time factor (T) is 90/360 = 0.25.
   - If the bank uses a 365-day year, the time factor is 90/365 ≈ 0.246575.

3. **Calculate the principal using the correct time factor:**
   - **Assuming 360-day year:**
     - Interest (I) = P × R × T = P × 0.06 × 0.25 = 0.015P.
     - Given I = $36, so 0.015P = 36.
     - Solving for P: P = 36 / 0.015 = $2400.
   - **Assuming 365-day year:**
     - Interest (I) = P × 0.06 × (90/365) ≈ P × 0.01479452.
     - Given I = $36, so P ≈ 36 / 0.01479452 ≈ $2434.66.

4. **Match the result with the options:**
   - The calculation using the 360-day year gives $2400, which matches option J.
   - The calculation using the 365-day year gives approximately $2434.66, which is not among the options.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The correct answer is J: $2400.

**Answer:** J
