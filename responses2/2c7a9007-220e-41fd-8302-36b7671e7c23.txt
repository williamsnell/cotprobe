Okay, so I have this question about the impact of government actions on real GDP. Hmm, I need to figure out which option would cause the biggest decrease in real GDP. I remember that government spending and taxes can affect the economy through the aggregate demand model. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I recall that real GDP is the total output of goods and services produced in an economy. Aggregate demand is the total demand for all goods and services, and it's influenced by various factors like government spending, taxes, investment, and net exports. So when aggregate demand changes, it affects real GDP.

The basic equation is AD = C + I + G + (X - M), where C is consumption, I is investment, G is government spending, and X-M is net exports. Real GDP is the output that comes from this aggregate demand.

Now, thinking about the options:

Option A: Government decreases both spending and taxes. If both go down, that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, which should increase real GDP. So A is not the answer.

Option B: Government holds spending and taxes constant. That means AD is held constant, so real GDP doesn't change. So B is neutral.

Option C: Government decreases spending matched with a decrease in taxes. So if G decreases and income taxes decrease, the net effect on G is a smaller negative. So AD = G + (T - T*) where T is taxes. If G goes down and T goes down, but how much? If both decrease by the same amount, the effect on AD might depend on the slope of the tax multiplier. Wait, the tax multiplier is negative, so when taxes decrease, AD increases. But if both G and T go down by the same amount, the net effect is a decrease in G and decrease in (T-T*), so net effect on AD is (G decreases) + (T lower, so (T-T*) lower, so total AD decrease). So if G decreases by a certain amount and (T-T*) also decreases by the same, then the net effect is a smaller decrease than if only G decreases. So the net effect on AD is less negative. So this would lead to a smaller decrease in real GDP. So C might not be the best option.

Option D: Government decreases taxes with no change in spending. So G decreases, T remains same. So AD decreases because (T-T*) is the same as before. So AD falls, leading to lower real GDP. But how much? The tax multiplier is negative, so a decrease in taxes would increase AD. So if G decreases by X and taxes don't change, AD decreases by (X * tax multiplier). Since the tax multiplier is negative, AD decreases by (X)*(-delta) = positive. So AD decreases, so real GDP decreases. So how much does this decrease depend on. But it's a direct decrease in taxes, so if you decrease taxes, you get a positive change in AD.

Option E: Government holds spending constant and increases taxes. So G is same, T increases. So AD decreases because (T-T*) increases, meaning a higher positive term. So AD decreases, real GDP decreases. But the effect is more pronounced because the tax multiplier is negative. So an increase in taxes (T) leads to a larger decrease in AD, hence a larger decrease in real GDP. So E would cause a larger decrease than other options.

Option F: Government increases both spending and taxes. So G increases, T increases. So both terms in AD change. How? If G goes up, AD increases. If taxes go up, (T-T*) increases, which also increases AD. So AD increases, real GDP increases. So F is not the answer.

Option G: Government increases spending with a corresponding increase in taxes. So G increases, T increases. Both terms go up. So AD increases. So real GDP increases. Not the answer.

Option H: Government increases taxes with no increase in spending. So G stays same, T increases. So (T-T*) increases, so AD increases. Real GDP increases. So H is not the answer.

Option I: Government increases spending with no change in taxes. So G increases, T same. AD increases, real GDP increases. So I is not the answer.

Option J: Government decreases spending with no change in taxes. So G decreases, T same. AD decreases. Real GDP decreases. But how much? The tax multiplier is negative, so a decrease in taxes would lead to a decrease in AD. Wait, no: if taxes don't change, decrease in G would just reduce AD by G's amount. So AD decreases.

So between options D and E. Let's think about the impact.

The tax multiplier is -0.25 (I think). The formula is ΔAD = (τ - τ*) * ΔT, but wait, the multiplier is the change in AD divided by the change in taxes. So if taxes decrease by $100, AD decreases by τ - τ* times that. But I might be mixing up the exact number. Alternatively, the tax multiplier is about 0.25, meaning that a $100 decrease in taxes leads to a $25 decrease in AD. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the tax multiplier is negative, so a decrease in taxes (ΔT negative) leads to a decrease in AD. The magnitude depends on the multiplier.

Wait, the government spending multiplier is positive, typically around 0.5-0.75. The tax multiplier is negative, around -0.2 to -0.3. So a $100 decrease in taxes leads to a $25 decrease in AD (since |-0.25| is 0.25). So, for each $100 decrease in taxes, AD decreases by $25.

So option D: decrease in taxes, no change in spending. So AD decreases by 25% of the decrease in taxes. So if taxes decrease by $100, AD decreases by $25.

Option E: increase taxes by $100, so AD increases by $25.

Wait, but the question is about the impact on real GDP. So if government spending decreases (option D), AD decreases, leading to lower real GDP. If they increase taxes (option E), AD increases, leading to higher real GDP.

Wait, but the question is about which option would cause the greatest decrease in real GDP. So option D would lead to a decrease in AD, thus lower real GDP. Option E would lead to an increase in AD, so real GDP would increase.

But wait, the options are about the impact on real GDP. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Let's think of it this way: real GDP is determined by the equilibrium level of AD. If AD decreases, real GDP will decrease. If AD increases, real GDP will increase.

So, looking at each option's impact on AD:

A: Both G and T decrease. So net effect is G decrease and T decrease (T-T*). So if G decreases by G1 and T decreases by T1, the net effect is G decreases by G1, and T-T* decreases by T1. So the net effect on AD is G decreases by G1, and (T-T*) decreases by T1. So if both decrease, the net effect is a smaller decrease than just G's decrease. So AD decreases, real GDP decreases.

Option C: G decreases by G2, taxes decrease by T2. But G2 = T2. So AD = (G - G2) + (T - T2) = G - G + (T - T) = same as before. So AD is the same as before. So no change. So real GDP wouldn't change. So option C doesn't affect real GDP.

Wait, but the question is which option would cause the greatest decrease in real GDP. So which option leads to the largest decrease in AD, leading to lower real GDP.

So let's think:

Option D: decrease in taxes, no change in G. So AD decreases because (T-T*) decreases, so AD decreases. How much? Let's say taxes decrease by $100. Then AD would decrease by 0.25 * $100 = $25.

Option E: increase in taxes, so AD increases by $25.

Which one causes a bigger change in AD? So option D leads to a decrease of $25. Option E leads to an increase of $25. So the impact on real GDP is a decrease of $25 (D) or an increase of $25 (E). So option D would lead to a small decrease in AD, so real GDP would decrease a bit. Option E leads to a significant increase.

Wait, but the question says which choice would create the greatest decrease in real GDP. So between options, D leads to a decrease, E leads to an increase.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is "The government decreases taxes with no change in spending." So that's a decrease in taxes, which, as per the tax multiplier, causes AD to decrease. So real GDP would decrease.

Option E: government increases taxes without spending change. So AD increases. So real GDP increases.

So which option leads to a larger shift? Let's assume the tax multiplier is -0.25, which means a $100 decrease in taxes reduces AD by $25. So if taxes decrease by $100, AD decreases by $25, so real GDP decreases by $25. If taxes increase by $100, AD increases by $25, so real GDP increases by $25.

So which of these would have a bigger impact? The question is about the greatest decrease. So the option that causes a larger AD change would lead to a larger real GDP change.

So option D would lead to a $25 decrease in AD. Option E would lead to a $25 increase.

So the answer is either D or E. But the question is which one would cause the greatest decrease.

Wait, the question is about the greatest decrease in real GDP. So the option that causes the largest decrease in AD. So option D would decrease AD by 25% (if the tax decrease is 100, AD decreases 25). So if the government decreases taxes by a larger amount, like $200, then AD would decrease by 25 * 2 = $50. So a bigger change.

Wait, but the options don't specify how much. So from a multiple-choice perspective, the question is about which option would have the strongest impact on reducing real GDP.

Wait, but the options are about the action, not the magnitude. So if any option leads to a decrease in AD, it would lead to lower real GDP. So options A, B, C, E, F, G, H, I, J all could impact real GDP.

Wait, but the only options that affect real GDP are A, D, E, and which other options? Let me recheck:

Wait, option C: same G and T change, so no impact. So real GDP remains same.

Option B: no impact on AD, so real GDP same.

So the options that affect AD are A, D, E.

Option D: decrease in taxes, no change in G. So AD decreases. So real GDP decreases.

Option E: increase in taxes, no change in G. So AD increases. Real GDP increases.

So the question is which action would lead to the greatest decrease. So the options that cause a decrease in AD are D and E. But between D and E, which leads to a larger decrease.

Wait, if the government decreases taxes, the decrease in AD is larger. For example, if only a small tax cut leads to a larger AD decrease. Let's say the tax cut is $100, AD drops by 25. That's a decrease of 25. If the tax cut is $200, AD drops by 50. So the bigger the tax cut, the bigger the decrease in AD.

So which option among A, D, or E gives the biggest effect? The question is not about the magnitude of the change, but which one among the options given would cause the greatest decrease. So among the options, the one where G decreases and T decreases (same amount) would lead to a smaller decrease than when G decreases and T increases.

Wait, no. Wait, no: option A is decrease in both G and T, leading to a net lower AD. But the tax multiplier is negative. So a decrease in taxes would increase AD, but if G also decreases, the net effect is that both G and (T-T*) change. So if both decrease by same amount, the net effect is smaller.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how much each option affects AD.

Option D: decrease in taxes (no change in G). So AD = (T-T*) - G. So if T decreases, AD decreases by (T-T*) * delta.

Option E: increase in taxes (no change in G). AD increases by (T-T*) * delta.

Which of these leads to a larger change in AD? Suppose the tax change is X. Let's say X is 100. For option D, AD decreases by X * (tax multiplier). For E, AD increases by X * tax multiplier. So the magnitude of change depends on the sign. Since the tax multiplier is negative, option D leads to a negative change (since G decreases, AD decreases by X * (positive tax multiplier)). Option E leads to a positive change (AD increases by X * tax multiplier, which is negative, so AD increases by X * (-0.25) = negative, so AD increases by -25X? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this backward.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the impact on AD as:

- If G decreases, AD decreases by G.
- If T increases, AD increases by (T-T*).

So the impact on AD is G's effect minus T's effect.

Wait, perhaps I should model it mathematically. Let's assume that change in AD is:

ΔAD = (change in G) * (G multiplier) + (change in T) * (T multiplier).

Assuming G multiplier is positive, T multiplier is negative.

So if G decreases by ΔG, it's -ΔG.

If T increases by ΔT, it's +ΔT.

So ΔAD = (-ΔG) * (G_multiplier) + (ΔT) * (T_multiplier).

If G and T are both changed by the same amount, say ΔG = ΔT, then:

ΔAD = (-ΔG) * Gm + (ΔG) * Tm.

Since Tm is negative, let's say Tm = -Tm_abs.

So ΔAD = (-ΔG) * Gm + (ΔG) * (-Tm_abs) = -ΔG (Gm + Tm_abs).

Hmm, if Gm is 0.5 and Tm_abs is 0.25, then:

ΔAD = -ΔG (0.5 + 0.25) = -ΔG * 0.75.

So with a $100 decrease in G, ΔAD would be -75, so AD decreases by 75. That's a decrease of 75 units.

But if the government increases taxes (E), then ΔT is +ΔG. So:

ΔAD = (-ΔG)*Gm + (ΔG)*Tm.

With Tm negative, like -0.25:

ΔAD = (-ΔG)*0.5 + (ΔG)*(-0.25) = (-0.5 -0.25) ΔG = -0.75 ΔG.

So for a $100 increase in taxes (ΔG=+100):

ΔAD = -75. So AD increases by 75, real GDP increases.

Wait, but if G decreases and T increases by same amount, the effect on AD is the same (but opposite sign). So in that case, both D and E would have the same magnitude of impact on AD but opposite signs.

But the question is which option would cause the greatest decrease in real GDP. So the option that leads to the largest decrease in AD would do so.

Wait, but the options have different actions. For example, option D: decrease in taxes, same G. So AD decreases. Option E: increase in taxes, same G, leading to AD increase.

So the only options that cause a change in AD are A, D, E.

Which of these options causes a larger change in AD? Let's say if the government decreases taxes (D), then AD decreases by TΔ - GΔ, but since G is same, the change is just TΔ. But the exact impact depends on the tax multiplier.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that which option leads to a larger shift. Option D would have a larger impact because it's a smaller decrease in taxes (but the multiplier is 0.25). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

The correct answer is likely option D or E.

Wait, but the question is which option would cause the greatest decrease in real GDP. So how much does each option change AD.

Assuming that the tax multiplier is -0.25, a $100 decrease in taxes leads to a $25 decrease in AD. So if the government decreases taxes by $100, real GDP would decrease by $25. If they increase taxes by $100, real GDP would increase by $25.

So which option among the options given would cause a larger change? The options are limited to change in G and T.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Both G and T decrease. So net effect is same as not changing, so no impact.

B: G and T same. No impact.

C: G and T same. No impact.

D: Decrease in T, no change in G: So AD decreases by 25%.

E: Increase in T, same G: AD increases by 25%.

So the effect on real GDP is a decrease of 25% in D and increase of 25% in E.

So the options D and E would each lead to a 25% decrease or increase in AD. But the question is about the greatest decrease. So between D and E, which causes a greater change?

Wait, but the problem says, which choice is most likely to create the greatest decrease in real GDP. So the one that causes the largest AD change. So if the option leads to a larger AD change, it's the answer.

So in options D and E, each leads to a 25% change. So same magnitude change in AD. So the question is which of the options leads to the greatest change.

But I'm not sure about the exact numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, which would lead to a 75% decrease in AD if G and T change by same amount.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the impact of each action on AD.

Option D: decrease in T, same G.

So AD = G + (T-T*) + other terms. So if G stays the same, and T-T* decreases by same amount, AD decreases by the same amount.

So for example, if G was 100, and T was 200, so T-T* is 100. If G remains 100, and T decreases by 100 to 100, then T-T* is 0. So AD was 100 + 100 = 200, now it's 100 + 0 = 100. So AD decreased by 100. So real GDP decreased by 100. So a 100 decrease in AD.

Option E: increase in T, same G.

So G is same, T increases by 100, so T-T* increases by 100. So AD increases by 100. So real GDP increases by 100.

So which of the options in the options given has the largest decrease in AD? Since the options don't specify the magnitude, the question is which option would have the greatest impact on AD.

But looking at the options, the only ones that change AD are D and E.

So which of D or E leads to a larger decrease? Let's think about the impact of each option. Option D: decrease in T, same G. So the change in AD is (T-T*) decreases by same amount as G. So if G decreases by X, and T decreases by X, then the change in AD is (T-T*) decreases by X. So the change in AD is X.

Wait, but if G decreases by X, and (T-T*) decreases by X, then AD = (G - X) + ((T-T*) - X) = G + (T-T*) - 2X. So the change in AD is -2X.

But the tax multiplier is -0.25, so a $100 decrease in taxes leads to a $25 decrease in AD. So for a $100 decrease in G and T, the change in AD is -200.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's take a concrete example.

Option D: decrease in taxes by $100, same G.

So AD = G + (T-T*) - G. Because G is same. Wait, no.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because it's the only option that decreases AD, but in reality, the correct answer should be option D or E, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the real government's impact would be that if the government decreases taxes, AD decreases. So the greatest decrease would be caused by a decrease in taxes. So option D.

But wait, the options are about which would cause the greatest decrease in real GDP. So if you decrease taxes, AD decreases, so real GDP decreases. So the option that causes the greatest decrease would be the one that leads to the largest AD change. So which option leads to the largest AD change? Option D would decrease AD by 25% of the tax decrease. But if the tax decrease is larger, say $100, then AD decreases by $25. If the tax decrease is $200, AD decreases by $50.

But in the options, each action leads to a change in AD. So the correct answer is the option that leads to the largest decrease. So if the action is to decrease taxes, the change in AD is 0.25 times the tax decrease. So a $100 decrease in taxes leads to a $25 decrease in AD. But if the action is to increase taxes, it leads to a $25 increase in AD.

So the only options that affect real GDP are A, D, and E. But the problem is, the options are limited to G and T changes. So the correct answer is option D, which leads to a decrease in AD, thus a decrease in real GDP, and option E, which increases AD, leading to an increase in real GDP.

So the question asks which choice would create the greatest decrease in real GDP. So the correct answer is option D.
</think>

To determine which option would create the greatest decrease in real GDP, we analyze the impact of each action on aggregate demand (AD). The key is understanding how changes in taxes and government spending affect AD, which in turn influences real GDP.

1. **Option A**: Decreases both government spending and taxes. This results in no net change in AD because the decrease in taxes offsets the decrease in spending. Thus, AD remains unchanged, and real GDP does not decrease.

2. **Option B**: Increases both government spending and taxes. This leads to an increase in AD, causing real GDP to increase, not decrease.

3. **Option C**: Decreases both government spending and taxes by the same amount. Since both G and T change equally, the net effect on AD is neutral. Real GDP remains unchanged.

4. **Option D**: Decreases taxes without changing government spending. This directly impacts AD by decreasing taxes, leading to a decrease in real GDP. The magnitude of the change depends on the tax multiplier, which is negative. A $100 decrease in taxes leads to a $25 decrease in AD, causing real GDP to decrease by $25.

5. **Option E**: Increases taxes without changing government spending. This impacts AD by increasing taxes, leading to an increase in real GDP. The magnitude of the change depends on the tax multiplier, which is negative. A $100 increase in taxes leads to a $25 increase in AD, causing real GDP to increase by $25.

6. **Options F, G, H, I, J**: Do not affect AD. They either leave AD unchanged or change AD in the opposite direction, leading to no change in real GDP.

### Conclusion
The option that leads to the greatest decrease in real GDP is **Option D**. Decreasing taxes without changing government spending directly impacts AD by decreasing taxes, resulting in a decrease in real GDP by $25.
