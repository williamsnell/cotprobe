Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best answer for this question about post-divorce adjustment. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question is asking which factor best predicts a child's post-divorce adjustment over two years. The options are A through J, each giving a different factor. I remember that when dealing with divorce, children often go through a tough time, so their adjustment is crucial here.

Option A: Level of involvement of the non-custodial parent. I think this refers to how much the parent remains in the child's care after the divorce. Maybe if a parent isn't as involved, the child might feel neglected. That sounds like a positive factor because less involvement could help the child focus on their own needs.

Option B: Age of the child at the time of divorce. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. The child's age during divorce might affect how the parents handle their relationship post-divorce. But I don't recall a direct link to adjustment post-divorce.

Option C: Degree of continued conflict after divorce. This seems like it's about how the parents have been handling things. If there's a lot of conflict, maybe the child might not feel secure or supported, which could hinder adjustment. More conflict could mean more difficulty, so that might be a bad predictor.

Option D: Degree of hostility during divorce. If the parents were very hostile, that might make the child feel even more division and anxiety. That would definitely make post-adjustment harder, so this is probably not a good predictor.

Option E: Reside of the child with the preferred parent. I'm not sure what this means. If the child is living with a parent they prefer, maybe that's good. But I'm not certain how this directly affects their ability to adjust.

Option F: Academic performance before divorce. This seems more about the child's ability to handle the stress after the divorce, perhaps. But I don't think it's the best predictor of how well the child will adjust post-divorce.

Option G: Financial status after divorce. Not sure. Maybe a more stable financial situation would help the child. But financial status isn't directly linked to adjustment.

Option H: Withdrawal of the more disturbed parent. I'm not familiar with this term. Maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding. Perhaps it's the parent who was more hostile, and they left. If that's the case, the child might feel more secure because their parent is leaving, which is good for adjustment.

Option I: Level of support from extended family. Extended family support could help the child feel more secure and supported, which is crucial for adjustment. This sounds like a good factor.

Option J: Frequency of contact with friends after divorce. A lot of contact might be good, but if the child has friends, they might not need to contact them as much. Also, contact might help in building social skills. But I'm not sure if frequency is the best.

Thinking back, the best factors for adjustment are usually about the support the child has. If the child has a strong support network post-divorce, that's a big plus. Extended family support (I) is a good one. Also, if the non-custodial parent (A) is less involved, the child might feel less burdened, which is positive. 

Wait, but I'm not sure which one is the best. Let me think: the question asks for the best predictor. So perhaps it's about the extent of support. If the child has more extended family support, that would help them adjust better. Alternatively, if the non-custodial parent isn't as involved, that could also help.

Wait, another thought: The level of withdrawal from the more disturbed parent (H) might be an important factor. If the more disturbed parent leaves, the child feels supported, which is crucial for adjustment. So H could be a strong predictor.

Alternatively, extended family support (I) might be another key factor. But I'm not sure if it's more directly related to adjustment than a specific parent's involvement.

Wait, I think the correct answer is H: withdrawal of the more disturbed parent. Because if the more disturbed parent is the one leaving, the child feels supported, which is essential for adjusting well. So their ability to stay home and socialize would improve.

Another angle: The level of involvement of the non-custodial parent (A) — less involvement means the child may feel more secure, but the support from extended family (I) is also a big plus.

Wait, but the question is about the best predictor. From what I remember, the best factors for adjustment post-divorce often include support from extended family, as it's a common and strong support system. So option I would be the best answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about the best predictor. So the factors that, when present, would help the child adjust better.

I think the best is the level of support from extended family (I), because that's a common support system, and without it, the child might struggle. Alternatively, if the non-custodial parent isn't as involved (A), that could also help, but the support from extended family is a more universal factor.

Wait, but the options don't have an 'extended family' option except for H, which is about the more disturbed parent's withdrawal. So perhaps H is the answer.

Wait, no, the options are A to J. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, option H: withdrawal of the more disturbed parent. So that's a good factor because if a parent leaves, the child feels supported, which is crucial for adjustment.

Alternatively, extended family support (I) is option I. So I think I is the best choice. But I'm a bit torn because other factors like the non-custodial parent's involvement (A) or the parents' continued conflict (C) might also be factors.

Wait, another thought: the degree of withdrawal (H) is more about the immediate leaving, which could be a key factor. But the question is about the best predictor of adjustment, which might be the support system, even if it's a bit more external.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Some sources say that the degree of support from extended family is a strong predictor of positive adjustment outcomes. So perhaps I is the answer.

But let me think about the options again. The question is about the best predictor. So if the child has more support from extended family, that's a big plus.

Wait, the options are:

I: level of support from extended family.

So I think I is the correct answer.

Wait, but another factor: the level of withdrawal (H) is a specific event, but the support from extended family (I) is a more general and universal factor. So perhaps I is better.

Wait, but the question is about the best overall factor. So which one is more relevant.

Alternatively, the key factors are the support network (extended family) and the level of parental support (non-custodial parent). But if the question provides these as options, perhaps the best is I.

Wait, the options are A to J. So I is an option. So my conclusion is that the best is I: level of support from extended family.

The best predictor of a child's post-divorce adjustment during the two years following divorce is the level of support from extended family. Extended family support is a universal and crucial factor that provides emotional and social security for the child, which is essential for effective adjustment. While other factors like the involvement of the non-custodial parent or the degree of conflict post-divorce may play roles, the extent of support from extended family is the most significant determinant of a child's ability to adjust to the new environment.
