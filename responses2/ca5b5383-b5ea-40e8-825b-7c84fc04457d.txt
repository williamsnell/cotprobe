Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the securitization process. I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it.

The question asks which statement is not applicable to the Securitization process. The options are A, B, C, D, E. I'll go through each one.

First, I need to remember what I know about securitization. From what I've studied, securitization is a process where a security entity (like a bank or insurance company) secures the assets of another individual or organization. It's a legal and financial process, often used to protect the interests of the party being protected.

Let's look at each option:

Option A: Where the securitizing actor is a democratic state, the relevant audience is usually the wider population who have the right to reject the speech act.
Hmm. So, if the actor is democratic, the audience can reject speech. That makes sense because democratic countries have broad rights about their policies and what they can say. So this seems applicable. So A is not the answer.

Option B: Securitization reveals the power of the securitizing actor.
Wait, does securitization actually reveal the actor's power? I'm not sure. Let me think. Securitization is more about the protection and management of assets, not directly about the actor's power. The actor's power is more about their influence or control. So this statement might not be correct. I'm leaning towards B being the not applicable option because I don't think securitization directly reveals the actor's power.

Option C: The adoption of extraordinary measures can retrospectively convince an audience of the existential threat.
Wait, what's an extraordinary measure? I think that refers to a measure that's unexpected or unusual, like a harsh penalty. So if a country uses an extraordinary measure to control the situation, does that mean the audience can be convinced of an existential threat? That seems a bit off. I'm not sure if this is a correct statement. I might have to think about the context. Oh, wait, maybe this is correct because extraordinary measures are often seen as a form of censorship, which can imply a threat to societal stability. So C might be applicable. So not the answer.

Option D: The process of securitization is always reversible.
I'm not sure about the reversibility of securitization. I think it's not necessarily always reversible. Maybe sometimes it's not possible to undo it. So D could be a statement that's not always true, making it not applicable. So D is a candidate.

Option E: Within authoritarian and other undemocratic regimes, the relevant political decision-making is often dominated by the military and political elite.
Wait, in authoritarian and undemocratic regimes, the government tends to be more powerful, and political elites are involved. So this statement seems correct. So E is applicable, so not the answer.

So let's recap: The question is which statement is not applicable. So which ones are applicable, and which isn't.

Option B: I'm not sure if securitization reveals the actor's power. It sounds more like a legal process about protection, not about power dynamics. So this might not be applicable. So B is the one that's not applicable.

Option D: The process is not always reversible. I've heard that sometimes, especially in cases where there's a lack of resources or information, it might not be reversible. So D is correct, which makes it applicable, so not the answer.

Wait, let's think again about option B. Is securitization about power? I don't think so. It's about the protection of assets, not about the power of the actor. The actor's power comes from their influence, not from the process of securitization. So B's statement is incorrect. Therefore, the statement is not applicable, making B the correct answer.

The correct answer is **B**, as securitization does not reveal the power of the securitizing actor. Instead, it focuses on the protection and management of assets. Therefore, the statement that is not applicable is:

**Answer: B**
