Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about short-term memory capacity. I remember that short-term memory refers to our ability to hold information for a limited period, usually a few seconds to a couple of minutes. The question is asking about the two principal explanations for this limited capacity. 

I think the main theories related to short-term memory are the "working memory" and "long-term memory." Working memory is about holding information in a temporary storage, while long-term memory is for information that lasts longer. But wait, looking at the options, one option is "Working Memory and Long-Term Memory Storage." That seems to fit, but I'm not sure if that's the correct term. Another possibility is something else.

Wait, another thought. There's also the "chunking" and "associative learning." Chunking is when we group information into smaller, manageable chunks, which reduces interference. Associative learning is when we remember information by linking it to something else. But I'm not sure if that's a main explanation for the capacity, or more about how information is stored.

Another option is "Serial Position Effect and Primacy/Recency." The serial position effect refers to how information is remembered in its natural order, meaning the first thing you see it is the easiest to remember. Primacy and recency are about how recently information was learned affecting its retention. But I think these are more about the order of learning rather than the capacity limit itself.

Looking back at the options, option I says "Working Memory and Long-Term Memory Storage." That sounds right because working memory is about the short-term, and long-term is the long-term. So the two principal explanations would be these two aspects.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I remember that working memory is a subset of short-term memory, and it's the one that's limited. Long-term memory is the rest. So the two explanations would be working memory and long-term memory storage. That would point to option I.

Alternatively, another option is "Capacity and Duration." Capacity refers to the amount of information we can hold, and duration is how long it lasts. But that's a more general concept, not specific to short-term memory. And I think the question is specifically about the two principal explanations, which are about the mechanisms or components.

So I think the correct answer is option I: Working Memory and Long-Term Memory Storage. Because working memory is the short-term, and long-term is the longer time frame.

The two principal explanations for the limited capacity of short-term memory are working memory and long-term memory storage. 

Answer: I: Working Memory and Long-Term Memory Storage
