Alright, so I have this algebra problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems. Let me try to think it through step by step. 

The problem states that for some numbers a, b, and c, we have the following equations:
1. a + b + c = 6
2. ab + ac + bc = 5
3. abc = -12

And the question is asking for a³ + b³ + c³. Hmm, okay. I remember something about using symmetric sums and identities to find higher powers like this. Let me try to recall the relevant formulas.

I think there's a formula that relates a³ + b³ + c³ to the sums a + b + c, ab + ac + bc, and abc. Let me try to remember how that goes. Oh right, I think it's something like a³ + b³ + c³ equals (a + b + c)³ minus 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) plus 3abc. Wait, let me write that down to make sure I get it right.

So, the formula is:
a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

Okay, so I can plug in the values from the problem into this formula. Let me substitute the given values into each part.

First, (a + b + c) is given as 6. So, (a + b + c)³ would be 6³. Let me calculate that: 6*6=36, 36*6=216. So, (a + b + c)³ is 216.

Next, the second term is 3*(a + b + c)*(ab + ac + bc). So, plugging in the values, that's 3*6*5. Let's compute that: 3*6 is 18, 18*5 is 90. So, the second term is 90.

Then the third term is 3abc, which is 3*(-12). That's -36.

Putting it all together, a³ + b³ + c³ equals 216 minus 90 plus (-36). Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The formula is (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. So, substituting the numbers:

216 (first term) minus 90 (second term) plus 3abc is 3*(-12) = -36. So it's 216 - 90 + (-36). Let me compute that step by step.

216 minus 90 is 126. Then 126 minus 36 is 90. Wait, that can't be right because none of the options are 90. Hmm, did I do something wrong here?

Wait, wait. Let me check the formula again. Oh! I think I might have made a mistake in the formula. Let me see. I've heard another way: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. Wait, that seems correct. So, 216 - 90 is 126, then adding 3*(-12) is 126 -36 = 90. But 90 isn't one of the options. Let's double-check the problem statement. Did I read it right?

Wait, reviewing the problem: a + b + c = 6, ab + ac + bc =5, abc = -12. So the formula seems correct. Hmm, but the options don't have 90. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, 6 cubed is 6*6=36, 36*6=216. Correct.

Then, 3*(6)*(5) = 3*6=18, 18*5=90. Correct.

Then, 3*(-12) = -36. So, putting it all together: 216 - 90 + (-36) = 216 -90 is 126, 126 -36 is 90. So 90. But the options don't have 90. The closest options are F:90 and J:100, but 90 is option F. Wait, but the options are A:99, B:102, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in my formula.

Wait, wait, I think I might have mixed up the formula. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. Alternatively, I've heard it written as (a+b+c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(a + c). But that's not directly helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. Which is what I used.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me calculate each term again.

First term: 6³ = 216.

Second term: 3*(6)*(5) = 3*6=18, 18*5=90.

Third term: 3*abc = 3*(-12) = -36.

So, putting it all together: 216 - 90 + (-36) = 216 -90 is 126, 126 -36 is 90. So 90. Hmm, but 90 is option F. But the system says the options are A:99, B:102, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait—maybe the formula is actually a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b)(b + c)(a + c). No, that doesn't seem right. Or maybe I'm confusing with something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should use another approach, like finding the values of a, b, c first.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can find the values of a, b, c. But that might be more complicated, but maybe necessary. Let's see.

We have a + b + c =6.

ab + ac + bc=5.

abc= -12.

I can consider that these are the elementary symmetric sums of the roots of a cubic equation. So, the cubic equation would be x³ - (a + b + c)x² + (ab + ac + bc)x - abc =0. Plugging the values, that would be x³ -6x² +5x +12=0. Because abc= -12, so it's -(-12)=+12. So the equation is x³ -6x² +5x +12=0. Let me factor this equation to find the roots.

Let me try to factor it. I'll use the rational root theorem, which says that any rational root p/q is such that p divides 12 and q divides 1. So possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±12.

Let me test x= -1: (-1)^3 -6*(-1)^2 +5*(-1)+12= -1 -6 -5 +12=0. So x= -1 is a root. So (x +1) is a factor.

Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division. Using synthetic division with root -1:

Coefficients: 1 | -6 | 5 | 12

Bring down the 1.

Multiply by -1: 1*(-1)=-1. Add to next coefficient: -6 + (-1)= -7.

Multiply by -1: -7*(-1)=7. Add to next coefficient:5 +7=12.

Multiply by -1:12*(-1)=-12. Add to last coefficient:12 + (-12)=0.

So the polynomial factors into (x +1)(x² -7x +12). Now factor the quadratic: x² -7x +12. Find two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to -7. Those numbers are -3 and -4. So the quadratic factors as (x -3)(x -4). Thus, the entire cubic factors into (x +1)(x -3)(x -4)=0. So the roots are x= -1,3,4.

Therefore, a, b, c are -1, 3, and 4 in some order. Now, let's compute a³ + b³ + c³. Let's compute each cube:

a³ = (-1)^3 = -1.

b³ = 3³ = 27.

c³ =4³=64.

So adding them: (-1) +27 +64= (-1 +27)=26, 26 +64=90. So a³ + b³ +c³=90. Which is option F.

Wait, but earlier I thought I got 90, which is option F, but I remember the options listed in the question don't have 90. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:99

B:102

C:106

D:84

E:91

F:90

G:78

H:72

I:64

J:100

Yes, option F is 90. So my calculation must be correct, leading to 90. Therefore, the correct answer is F:90.
</think>

The problem asks for \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \) given the symmetric sums \( a + b + c = 6 \), \( ab + ac + bc = 5 \), and \( abc = -12 \). Using the identity \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc \), we substitute the given values:

- \( (6)^3 = 216 \)
- \( 3 \times 6 \times 5 = 90 \)
- \( 3 \times (-12) = -36 \)

Thus, \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 216 - 90 - 36 = 90 \). The correct answer is F:90.

Answer: F
