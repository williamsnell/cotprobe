Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a coil and an electromotive force, or emf. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my circuits, but let's try to think this through.

The problem says: A coil with a resistance of 0.05 ohms is connected to a cell that has an emf of 1.5 volts. I need to find the current when the internal resistance of the cell is (a) 0.1 ohms and (b) 0.01 ohms. Then I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Wait, right, in a circuit with an external resistor and an internal resistor, I remember something about the total resistance and the current. Oh right, the cell has internal resistance, so the total resistance is the sum of the external and internal resistances. Then, using Ohm's Law (V=IR), I can find the current.

So for part (a), the internal resistance is 0.1 ohms. Let's add that to the coil's 0.05 ohms. Total R would be 0.05 + 0.1 = 0.15 ohms.

The emf is 1.5 volts. So current I = V/R. So 1.5 / 0.15. Let me calculate that. 1.5 divided by 0.15 is 10. So 10 amps. Wait, that's option A for part (a). But wait, looking at the options, let me check. Oh, let me check all options again. Option I says (a) 8 and (b) 40. Option A is (a)10, (b)50. So for part (a), I get 10 amps. So looking at the options, does any option have part (a) as 10? Let's see option I: (a)8, (b)40. No. Option A: a)10, but part (b) is 50. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The emf is 1.5 volts. The external resistor is 0.05 ohms. The internal is 0.1. So total R is 0.15. So I =1.5 / 0.15 = 10 A. So the correct option for (a) is 10 A. But looking at the options, I don't see any option where (a) is 10. Let me look again.

Looking at the options:

A: a)7.5, b)50
B: a)14, b)28
C: a)12, b)24
D: a)20, b)5
E: a)5, b)20
F: a)30, b)15
G: a)15, b)30
H: a)25, b)10
I: a)8, b)40
J: a)10, b)25

Wait, option J for (a) is 10, and (b) is 25. I thought part (a) was 10, so option J would be (a)10, (b)25. But the other part (b) for J is 25. Let me recheck part (b) for option J. For (b), the internal resistance is 0.01 ohms. So total R is 0.05 + 0.01 = 0.06 ohms. Then I=1.5 / 0.06. Calculating that: 1.5 /0.06. Let's see: 0.06 is 6e-2, so 1.5 is 3e-1. So 3e-1 divided by 6e-2 is (3/6) * (1e-1 /1e-2) = 0.5 * 10 = 5. So 5 A. So option J's (a) is 10, (b) is 5. Which matches what I calculated.

Wait, but in option J, part (b) is 5, but in my calculation for part (b), I get 5 as well. So J's (b) is 5. Wait, but the options are about the current, not the internal resistance. Hmm, but let me think again. The problem is in (a) the internal resistance is 0.1, which is part (a) of the question. The correct answer for (a) would be 10 A. But looking at the options, none of them have (a)10. So wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the problem statement, the coil is connected to the cell. So the cell has an emf of 1.5 V. The coil has resistance 0.05 and the cell's internal resistance is (a) 0.1 or (b) 0.01. So to find the current, the formula is:

I = emf / (R_coil + R_internal)

So for (a), R_total = 0.05 +0.1 = 0.15. I = 1.5 /0.15 = 10 A. So (a) is 10 A. Do any options have (a) 10?

Looking again, option J: (a) 10, (b)5. But the other part (b) is 25 in option J's part (b) is 25. Wait, no, option J's part (b) is 5 A. Wait, no, in my calculation, part (b) was 5 A for option J.

Wait, but what about option I? Option I's (a) is 8 A, which is not 10. Option H's (a) is 25, which is higher than 10. So none of the options have (a)10. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait, wait. Wait, sometimes when resistors are in parallel, but in this case, are they in series? Because a coil and a cell connected in a way that the coil's resistance is in series with the cell's internal resistance. Because the cell's internal resistance is part of the circuit as well. So yes, correct.

So for (a), I get 10 A. But looking at the options, no option has (a)10. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I forgot that the emf is higher than the sum of the resistances. Hmm, no, because 1.5 V is the emf, and the total R is 0.15 ohms. But 0.15 ohms is 150 mOhms, which is less than 1.5 V. So 1.5 / 0.15 is 10, which is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have option (a) 10. So perhaps I made a mistake in part (a) calculation. Let me recheck. Oh wait, no, 0.05 + 0.1 is 0.15; 1.5/0.15 is 10 A. So (a) is 10 A. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the cell as having an internal resistance, so it's a voltage source with internal resistance, and the current is given by I = V / (R_internal + R_extrinsic). Wait, but that's the same as what I did.

Wait, maybe the cell's emf is 1.5 V, and the coil's resistance is 0.05. So when the cell is connected, the current is determined by the voltage across the cell. So the cell's internal resistance is part of the circuit. So the current is (emf) / (R_coil + R_internal). So that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, for part (a), I get 10 A. So looking for which options have (a)10. There's option I (a)8, (b)40; option J (a)10, (b)25. So (a) is 10, (b) is 25. So part (b) is 25. But according to my calculation, part (b) is 5 A. So that's a discrepancy.

Wait, maybe I mixed up (a) and (b) in the options. Let me recheck my calculations.

Wait, no, in part (a), I=1.5/(0.05+0.1) =10 A.

In part (b), I=1.5/(0.05+0.01)=1.5/0.06=25 A.

So (a) is 10, (b) is 25.

Looking at the options:

Which option has (a)10, (b)25? Let's see:

Looking through the options:

Option I: (a)8, (b)40 → No.
Option J: (a)10, (b)25 → Yes.

So option J's (a) is 10, (b) is 25. So that matches our calculations. So the correct answer would be option J. But wait, in the problem statement, part (a) is 0.1 ohm (so I =10 A), and part (b) is 0.01 ohm (I=25 A). So the current for (a) is 10 A, and for (b) is 25 A.

Looking back at the options, yes, option J provides (a)10 and (b)25. So the correct answer is option J.

Wait, but wait! The options show for part (b) J is 25. But let me double-check. So if the internal resistance is 0.01, the total R is 0.06. So 1.5 / 0.06 is 25. So (b) is 25. So option J gives (a)10, (b)25, which matches.

But wait, looking again at the options, option I has (a)8, (b)40, which wouldn't match either. So the correct option is J.

To solve the problem, we use Ohm's Law, \( I = \frac{V}{R} \), where the total resistance in the circuit is the sum of the coil's resistance and the cell's internal resistance. The coil's resistance is \( R_{\text{coil}} = 0.05 \, \Omega \), and the emf of the cell is \( V = 1.5 \, \text{V} \).

### Part (a): Internal resistance \( R_{\text{internal}} = 0.1 \, \Omega \)
The total resistance in the circuit is:
\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{coil}} + R_{\text{internal}} = 0.05 + 0.1 = 0.15 \, \Omega
\]
The current is:
\[
I = \frac{V}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1.5}{0.15} = 10 \, \text{A}
\]

### Part (b): Internal resistance \( R_{\text{internal}} = 0.01 \, \Omega \)
The total resistance in the circuit is:
\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{coil}} + R_{\text{internal}} = 0.05 + 0.01 = 0.06 \, \Omega
\]
The current is:
\[
I = \frac{V}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1.5}{0.06} = 25 \, \text{A}
\]

### Matching with the options:
- For part (a), the current is \( 10 \, \text{A} \), which matches option **J** (10 A, 25 A).
- For part (b), the current is \( 25 \, \text{A} \), which also matches option **J**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: J**
