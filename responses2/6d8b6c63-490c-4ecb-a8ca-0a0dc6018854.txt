Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about two statements regarding machine learning concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's look at Statement 1: "Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators." Hmm, I remember that in statistics, the Gauss-Markov theorem states that the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator is the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) under certain conditions. Wait, but does that apply to linear regression in general, or specifically when comparing to other estimators? Oh right, the Gauss-Markov theorem says that OLS has the smallest variance among all linear and unbiased estimators, but if you consider non-linear estimators, maybe another estimator could have lower variance. But the statement says "among all unbiased estimators," not specifying linearity. So if there are non-linear unbiased estimators with lower variance, then Statement 1 is false. I think Statement 1 is false because it's making a general claim about all unbiased estimators, not just linear ones.

Now Statement 2: "The coefficients α assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative." I'm a bit foggy on AdaBoost, but I recall that AdaBoost uses boosting algorithms where each classifier is a weak learner. AdaBoost assigns weights to each example, and these weights determine how much each weak classifier's influence is. But wait, when using AdaBoost, does it set the coefficients α to be non-negative? Oh right, in the AdaBoost algorithm, the weights α are always positive. They represent the weight of each instance, and since they are summed up in the next round, they add up to 1. So the coefficients are always positive, meaning Statement 2 is true.

Putting it together: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. Looking at the options, which option says that? Option I says both statements are true. Wait, no. Option I is "True, True." Wait, no: let me check. The options are labeled from A to J. 

Wait, the options are:
A: First is sometimes true, False → No, both are false
B: True, Second is sometimes true → No, first is false, second is true
C: False, False → No, second is true
D: False, True → Yes, that's what I thought
E: Both sometimes true → No, both are not sometimes true
F: Both partially true → No
G: First is sometimes false, second is sometimes false → No, second is true
H: First is sometimes false, second is true → Yes, H matches
I: True, True → No, first is false
J: True, False → No, first is false

Wait, I thought Statement 1 is false, 2 is true. So looking for a combination where first is false and second is true. Option H is "False, True." That's correct. So the correct answer must be H.

The analysis points to Statement 1 being false and Statement 2 being true. 

ANSWER: H
