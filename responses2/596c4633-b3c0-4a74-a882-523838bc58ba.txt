Alright, so I've got this question about the formation of the earliest cells and which components were first. Hmm, let me think. I remember that early on, cells must have some basic organelles and structures.

Okay, the options are A to J. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, the question is about the earliest cells. I think the simplest cells likely had basic structures. The nucleus is one of the early components. But which one was first?

I recall that the cell membrane was formed later, maybe around the 19th or early 20th century. The nucleolus comes into play later, I'm pretty sure. The nucleolus is part of the mitochondria, which is important for energy. So, the nucleus comes before the mitochondria.

Next, the chloroplast. Chloroplasts are organelles involved in photosynthesis, which was a big discovery in the 19th century. They must have formed later than the nucleus because the nucleus is the first cell component, and then the mitochondria and chloroplasts came in.

Ribosomes are made of rRNA and proteins. They are involved in protein synthesis. I think ribosomes were around much later, like around the 20th century, maybe after the formation of the Golgi apparatus, which is another later component.

The Golgi apparatus was a later development too. It's involved in modifying and packaging proteins, which happened after the ribosomes. So the Golgi comes after the ribosome.

The endoplasmic reticulum is involved in protein synthesis too, maybe similar to the Golgi. It's another structural component that comes later.

The cell wall is definitely a later development. The earliest cells probably don't have a cell wall yet; the cell wall is part of plants. So E (cell wall) is not the first.

Plasma membrane is part of the cell membrane, so that's even later than the cell wall.

So putting it all together: the first components are the nucleus (G) and maybe the nucleolus (part of mitochondria, but they are later). So the earliest would be the nucleus.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the order of the components. I think the cell membrane was formed later, but the nucleus is still the earliest. So the first components are the nucleus and maybe the nucleolus (of mitochondria). But the question is about the options given, and the options are letters, so which comes first?

So the options are A to J. Let me look at the options again. The choices are:

A: Lysosome
B: Chloroplast
C: Ribosome
D: Golgi
E: Plasma membrane
F: Endoplasmic reticulum
G: Nucleus
H: Mitochondrion
I: Flagellum
J: Cell wall

The cell's earliest components would be the nucleus (G) and maybe the nucleolus (part of mitochondria). But among the options, the first in the sequence would be the nucleus, I think. I remember that the nucleus is the first organelle to form in the cells. So the correct answer should be G: Nucleus.

Wait, but wait. Are there any other components that are involved earlier? Oh, the ribosome is made of rRNA and proteins, which came later. The Golgi comes later too. Chloroplasts and mitochondria came after the nucleus.

So the earliest is the nucleus. So the answer should be G: Nucleus.
</think>

The formation of the earliest cells involves specific organelles and structures. The nucleus is the first component to arise, as it is the cell's primary nucleus. The ribosome, which includes rRNA and proteins, and the Golgi apparatus, which processes proteins, were later formed. Chloroplasts and mitochondria, involved in photosynthesis, also emerged later. The cell wall, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane are structural components of later cells. Therefore, the earliest components are the nucleus (G) and the nucleolus (part of mitochondria). Among the given options, the first component to arise is the nucleus.

Answer: G
