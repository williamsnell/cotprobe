Okay, so I have this statistics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the probability that the sample mean, denoted as X bar, falls between 74.2 and 78.4. The sample is taken from a normal distribution with mean 77 and variance 25. Oh wait, no, the variance is 25, so the standard deviation is 5 since sqrt(25) is 5.

Hmm, the sample size is 16. Right, because it's X1 to X16. So, to find the probability, I think I need to use the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem says that the distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal, regardless of the population distribution, as long as the sample size is large enough. Since our sample size is 16, which is somewhat small but not too small, but since the population is already normal, the sample mean will definitely be normal.

So, the first step is to find the standard error of the mean. The formula for standard error (SE) is sigma divided by the square root of n. Here, sigma is 5, and n is 16. So, SE = 5 / sqrt(16) = 5/4 = 1.25.

Wait, no: sqrt(16) is 4, so 5/4 is indeed 1.25. Got it.

Now, I need to standardize the values 74.2 and 78.4 to Z-scores. The formula for Z is (X - mu) divided by SE. 

For 74.2, the Z-score is (74.2 - 77) / 1.25. Let me compute that: 74.2 minus 77 is -2.8. Dividing by 1.25 gives -2.8 / 1.25. Hmm, 1.25 goes into 2.8 twice (2.5) with a remainder. Wait, 1.25 * 2 is 2.5, so 2.8 is 0.3 more. So 2 + (0.3/1.25) = 2 + 0.24 = 2.24? Wait, no, wait: 1.25 * 2.24 = 2.7999, which is approximately 2.8. So the Z-score is -2.24.

Wait, no, wait: 1.25 multiplied by 2 is 2.5. So 2.5 is 2.5. So 2.8 is 2.5 + 0.3. So 0.3 / 1.25 is 0.24. So 2.5 is 2, and 2.5 is 2. The total is 2.24. So the Z-score is -2.24. Wait, no, wait: no, no, wait: 1.25 * X = 2.8. Let me solve for X: X = 2.8 / 1.25. 1.25 is 5/4, so 2.8 / (5/4) = 2.8 * (4/5) = (2.8 *4)/5. 2.8 *4 is 11.2 divided by 5 is 2.24. So yes, Z = -2.24.

For 78.4, the Z-score is (78.4 - 77) / 1.25. 78.4 -77 is 1.4. 1.4 divided by 1.25. Let me compute that. 1.25 *1.12 is 1.4 (since 1.25 * 1 = 1.25, 1.25 *0.12=0.15, 1.25+0.15=1.4). So Z is 1.12.

So now, I need to find the probability that Z is between -2.24 and 1.12. That is, P(-2.24 < Z < 1.12). 

I can look this up using standard normal tables, or I can compute it using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. Alternatively, I can use a calculator or some software. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to compute it.

Let me recall the standard normal probabilities. For Z=1.12, the cumulative probability is approximately 86.85% (I think it's 0.8686). For Z=-2.24, the cumulative probability is 0.0125 (I think it's 0.0125, because for Z=-2.24, standard tables may have approximations). So the probability between Z=-2.24 and 1.12 is the difference between these two?

Wait, no: the probability between a and b is P(Z < b) - P(Z < a). So, P(-2.24 < Z < 1.12) = P(Z < 1.12) - P(Z < -2.24). 

So P(Z <1.12) is about 0.8686, and P(Z < -2.24) is 0.0125. So 0.8686 - 0.0125 = 0.8561. 

Looking at the options, E is 0.8561. So the answer should be E.

To compute the probability \( P(74.2 < \bar{X} < 78.4) \) for a random sample of size 16 from a normal distribution \( N(77, 25) \):

1. **Calculate the Standard Error (SE):**  
   The SE is \( \sigma / \sqrt{n} = 5 / \sqrt{16} = 1.25 \).

2. **Standardize the Values:**  
   - For \( \bar{X} = 74.2 \):  
     \( Z = (74.2 - 77) / 1.25 = -2.24 \).
   - For \( \bar{X} = 78.4 \):  
     \( Z = (78.4 - 77) / 1.25 = 1.12 \).

3. **Find the Probabilities:**  
   - \( P(Z < 1.12) \approx 0.8686 \).
   - \( P(Z < -2.24) \approx 0.0125 \).

4. **Calculate the Desired Probability:**  
   \( P(-2.24 < Z < 1.12) = P(Z < 1.12) - P(Z < -2.24) = 0.8686 - 0.0125 = 0.8561 \).

The correct answer is **E: 0.8561**.
