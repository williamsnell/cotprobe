Okay, so I have this question about translating a sentence into predicate logic, and I need to pick the correct option from A to J. Let me try to break it down.

The question says: "Leo is taller than Cathy." They've given me some variables: c for Cathy, l for Leo, and Txy which means x is taller than y. So, I need to translate "Leo is taller than Cathy" using these.

Breaking it down: Leo is taller, so the taller person is Leo. The taller is x, taller than y, which is Cathy. So, x should be Leo and y should be Cathy. So the predicate would be Txyc, but wait, the Txy is x is taller than y, so the structure would be T(x,y). So for Leo and Cathy, that would be T(l, c).

Looking at the options:

A: TlcL — Hmm, that seems like T(c, l, c, l), which doesn't make sense because we're only using two variables. Maybe a mistake in the options.

B: cTL — That's C, L, T. Let me see. c is Cathy, T is taller, L is Leo. But the structure would be c is taller than L, which isn't what we want. We need Leo taller than Cathy, so this would be cTl, which would mean Cathy is taller than Leo. So B is wrong.

C: lTc — l is Leo, T is taller, c is Cathy. So this would mean Leo is taller than Cathy, which is exactly what we need. So this seems correct.

Wait, but let's check all options:

D: Tll — l is taller than l, which is not correct. We need c to be in there as the taller.

E: cTl — same as B, which is Cathy is taller than Leo. Wrong.

F: TclC — Wait, that might be T(c, l, c). But that's three variables, which isn't needed here.

G: Tlc — l is taller than c? No, because Tlc would mean Leo is taller than Cathy, which is the opposite.

H: Tcl — Maybe that's T(c, l, c), but again, we don't have the third variable. So probably not.

I: Tcc — c is taller than c, which is a tautology, not relevant.

J: lCT — Leo is taller than C, but not sure about the order. Wait, Txy is x taller than y, so lCT would be Leo taller than Cathy, which is correct. But wait, how are the letters ordered in Txy? Txy is x is taller than y, so TlC would be Leo taller than Cathy, which is correct. But in the options, J is lCT. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the order. Let me check.

Wait, in the options, each option is a string of letters. So for the statement "Leo is taller than Cathy," the correct predicate is Tl(c, l) or Tl(c, l) because Txy is x is taller than y. So it's T(x,y), where x is Leo and y is Cathy. So it's T(l, c).

Looking at the options, let's see:

A: TlcL — Not sure, maybe T(l, c, l, c) but that's four variables.

B: cTL — c is taller than L? No.

C: lTc — l is taller than c? Yes, that's T(c, l) reversed. Wait, no: Txy is x taller than y, so lTc would be Leo taller than Cathy, which is correct.

D: Tll — l taller than l, no.

E: cTl — Cathy taller than Leo.

F: TclC — Maybe T(c, l, c), but not sure.

G: Tlc — l taller than c? Wait, no, because Tlc would be c taller than l, which is incorrect.

H: Tcl — C taller than l, which is wrong.

So, the correct one is either C or H? Wait, in option C, it's lTc. Which would translate to Leo is taller than Cathy. So that's correct. But in the options, is it lTc or Tl(c) or something else?

Wait, option C is lTc. So Tl(c) would be correct. Let me think about the syntax. Txy is x taller than y, so x being l, y being c: T(l, c) is correct.

Alternatively, option C is written as lTc, which would mean T is between l and c. So lTc is T(l, c). So that would be correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options: Option C is lTc, which is correct. Option H is Tcl, which would be Cathy taller than Leo. So that's wrong.

So the correct answer is option C: lTc.

The correct translation is "Leo is taller than Cathy," which is expressed as Tl(c). Among the options, option C (lTc) correctly represents this relationship.

Answer: C
