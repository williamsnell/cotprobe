Okay, let me try to figure out the variance for the ages of the couple's six children. So, the ages are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16. 

First, I remember that variance measures how spread out the ages are from the average. To calculate this, I need to follow these steps: find the mean, subtract each age from the mean, square those differences, find the average of those squares, and then that's the variance.

Let me start by finding the mean. I add up all the ages and divide by the number of children. So, adding them up: 6 + 8 is 14, plus 10 makes 24, plus 12 is 36, plus 14 is 50, and then +16 gives 66. There are six children, so the mean is 66 divided by 6. Let me calculate that: 66 รท 6 equals 11. So the mean age is 11.

Next, I'll find the differences between each age and the mean. 

For 6: 6 - 11 = -5. Then square that: (-5)^2 = 25.
For 8: 8 -11 = -3. Square: 9.
For 10: 10-11 = -1. Square:1.
For 12:12-11=1. Square:1.
For 14:14-11=3. Square:9.
For 16:16-11=5. Square:25.

Now I have these squared differences: 25, 9, 1, 1, 9, 25. 

Adding them up: 25 + 9 is 34, plus 1 is 35, plus 1 is 36, plus 9 is 45, plus 25 is 70. So the sum of the squared differences is 70.

Since variance is the average of these squared differences, I divide by the number of children, which is 6. So 70 divided by 6 equals approximately 11.666... 

Looking at the options, the closest one is D: 11.7. So I think the variance is about 11.7.

The variance was calculated by finding the mean (11), then computing the squared differences from each age, summing them (70), and dividing by the number of children (6), resulting in approximately 11.666... which rounds to 11.7.
