Question:

In Python 3, which of the following function convert a string to an int in python?

Options:

B: float(x)
C: integer(x [,base])
D: double(x)
E: int(x [,base])
F: long(x [,base] )
G: num(x)
H: str(x)
I: char(x)
J: digit(x [,base])

Okay, so I have a question about Python's string to integer conversion functions. Hmm. I remember that in Python, there are several functions that can convert strings to integers. Let me think about what each of them does.

The question is asking which function converts a string to an int. The options are A through J, each with a different function. I need to pick the correct one.

Right, let's go through each option. 

Option A: short(x) — I think this is for converting to a short integer, which is a 16-bit integer. But wait, does it convert a string to an int, or to a number? I'm not sure.

Option B: float(x) — Yes, this converts a string to a float. So that's not what we're looking for.

Option C: integer(x [,base]) — Oh, wait, isn't this part of the math module? Or is it a built-in function? Oh, right, Python's int() function can take a string and an optional base. So this function probably converts a string to an integer, but I'm not sure if it's the correct name or if it's a built-in function.

Option D: double(x) — That's for converting to a double, which is a floating-point number, probably not relevant here.

Option E: int(x [,base]) — Yes, this is the built-in function. It's the one that converts a string to an integer. For example, int("123") returns 123. And it can take a base if specified, like int("123", 8) for octal.

Option F: long(x [,base]) — That's for converting to a long integer. But in Python 3, int is of arbitrary precision, so perhaps this isn't necessary. Wait, actually, in Python 3, int is just a generic type, and the long is an alias for int. So perhaps this isn't the correct function, or maybe it's part of a different module.

Option G: num(x) — I'm not familiar with this function. Maybe it's a typo or something else; perhaps it's not a standard function.

Option H: str(x) — That's for converting to a string, so it's the opposite of what we need.

Option I: char(x) — That's for converting a character to a string, again opposite of what's needed.

Option J: digit(x [,base]) — I think this is for converting a digit character to an integer, but that's not a function I'm aware of.

So the question is asking which function converts a string to an int. The correct options are E and F because they can convert a string to an int. But wait, in Python 3.10 and above, int() is the built-in function for this. So E is the correct one.

Wait, but option F is long(x, base). But in Python 3, int() can handle any size, so maybe it's redundant. So the correct function is E: int(x[, base]).

So the answer should be E.

The correct function in Python 3 that converts a string to an integer is `int(x[, base])`. 

Answer: E
