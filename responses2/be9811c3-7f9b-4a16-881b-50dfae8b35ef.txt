Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the effects of export quotas and export taxes on soybeans. Let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what an export quota and an export tax are. An export quota is a fixed amount of a product that a country can export to other countries. So, if a country sets a quota on soybeans, it's limiting how much can be sent to foreign buyers. An export tax, on the other hand, is a tax imposed on the export of a product, which is usually applied by the exporting country.

Now, the question is asking about the effects on soybeans. Let's look at each option.

Option A: An export quota or export tax primarily benefits importers. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think importers would benefit if the price is lower (so maybe lower import prices), but if the country is exporting more, then importers might gain. Wait, but the question is about the effect on the product as a whole, not just importers. So perhaps this isn't the right answer.

Option B: An export quota or tax benefits domestic producers. That seems unlikely. Producers are usually incented to export if there are incentives, but in this case, the question is about the product itself, not about the producers' incentives. Also, an export tax or quota could reduce the supply available to domestic consumers, so producers would have less to sell, which would hurt them. So B might not be correct.

Option C: A quota or tax leads to a global surplus, driving prices down. Wait, if the quota limits export, it would reduce the supply in the world market. More supply means lower prices, not a surplus. A surplus would mean more supply than demand, leading to higher prices. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Quota or tax ensures stable income for farmers regardless of prices. That doesn't make sense. If prices go up, farmers make more. If prices go down, they make less. So farmers can't ensure stable income regardless. D is probably wrong.

Option E: Quota or tax lowers domestic prices by keeping them lower due to lower supply. If they're exporting less (because of quota), the world price would be higher, which is what would happen if the quota is imposed on an export country. So if the quota is on the exporting country, the domestic price might actually go up, not down. Wait, wait. Let me think again. If a country sets a quota on soybeans, they can't export as much as they'd like. So the world price would go up because other countries can export more. Higher world prices mean domestic prices go up, not down. So E might not be correct. Unless the quota is on a country that's importing, but the question says it's about the product as a whole. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Alternatively, if the quota is on a country whose export is limited, then the supply in the market would decrease, leading to higher prices, so domestic consumers pay more, not less. So E says it helps domestic consumers by lowering prices, which would be incorrect. So E might not be correct.

Option F: Quota or tax decreases world price by increasing competition. If a country imposes a quota, it limits how much can be exported. So other countries have more competition to export, which could lead to higher prices, not lower. Wait, wait. No, if a country can't export as much as before, the rest of the world can export more, so the world price would go up. So the domestic price would increase, not decrease. So F says it decreases the world price, which is wrong. So F is incorrect.

Option G: The quota or tax decreases supply in the domestic market. That makes sense because a quota limits the amount that can be exported, so domestic production decreases. So G is a likely correct answer.

Option H: No significant impact on price or supply. Well, most times, a quota or tax has an impact. So H is probably incorrect.

Let me review each option again. Option G seems right because a quota limits export, reducing supply locally. So the correct answer is G.
</think>

The correct answer is G: An export quota or export tax will decrease the supply of soybeans in the domestic market.

**Explanation:**
An export quota restricts the amount of soybeans that can be exported, thereby reducing the supply locally. This leads to a decrease in domestic supply, as the quantity available for sale decreases. Additionally, an export tax or quota increases competition among other countries for the limited export, which can lead to higher world prices. Therefore, the statement that a quota or tax decreases the supply in the domestic market aligns with the effects of such policies.

Answer: G
