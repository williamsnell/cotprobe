Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I remember that I need to be careful with the IUPAC nomenclature. Let me see what the question is about.

The question is about the name of a compound with the formula CH3CHBrCHClCH2CH3. The options are A to J, each giving different names. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should determine the structure of the molecule. Let's count the carbons. The formula is CH3CHBrCHClCH2CH3. Breaking it down: CH3-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3. So, that's 5 carbons in total. The first carbon is CH3, the next is CHBr, then CHCl, and the last two are CH2 and CH3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me count again. The molecule is:

Carbon 1: CH3 (so methyl group)
Carbon 2: CH (with Br)
Carbon 3: CH (with Cl)
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, noâ€”wait, the structure is CH3-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3. So, the middle carbons are the second and third. So, the molecule has four carbons in the middle. Wait, five carbons in total? Let's draw it out.

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH (with Br)
Carbon 3: CH (with Cl)
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, that can't be right because that would be five carbons. But the structure is CH3-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? No, wait, actually, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-CHBr-CHCl-CH3? No, wait, the formula is CH3CHBrCHClCH2CH3. So, the chain is CH3-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3. So, it's a five-carbon chain? No, wait, but that's five carbons. Wait, the chain is 1-2-3-4-5? But the formula is CH3CHBrCHClCH2CH3, which I think actually has five carbons in a row. Let me count: CH3 is 1, next is CH (2), then CH (3?), wait no, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3. So carbon 1: CH3, carbon 2: CH with Br, carbon 3: CH with Cl, carbon 4: CH2, carbon 5: CH3. That's five carbons.

Wait, but that would mean the structure is 1-methyl, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2BrCH2CHClCH2CH3? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write the structure more clearly.

The formula is CH3-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3. So the molecule is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH (with Br)
Carbon 3: CH (with Cl)
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, no, wait, no. The correct arrangement would be:

Carbon 1: CH3-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because the structure is:

The first carbon is CH3-, then the next is CHBr, then CHCl, then CH2, then CH3. So the entire molecule is: CH3-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3. So, that's five carbons in a straight chain, but with substituents on carbons 2 and 3.

Wait, but that's impossible because a five-carbon chain would be like:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a straight chain. However, in this case, the positions are 2 and 3, so the molecule is:

CH2(CH3)-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

The formula is CH3CHBrCHClCH2CH3. So, the chain is:

CH3-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3. So, it's five carbons in a row. So:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CHBr
Carbon 3: CHCl
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, but that's 1-CH3, 2-CHBr, 3-CHCl, 4-CH2, 5-CH3. So the structure is:

CH3-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3

Wait, but that would make the molecule a straight chain, but perhaps the substituents on carbons 2 and 3. So, it's a five-carbon chain with a Br on Carbon 2 and a Cl on Carbon 3, but wait, Carbon 4 is CH2, which is connected to Carbon 3 and Carbon 5. So, the substituents are on Carbon 2 and 3.

But wait, perhaps I should think of it as a five-carbon chain, but with substituents on C2 and C3. So the structure is:

CH3-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3.

So, the molecule is a pentane with substituents on carbons 2 and 3.

Wait, but in that case, the substituents are Br and Cl on adjacent carbons. So the molecule is 2,3-dibromo- or something? No, wait, each substituent is on separate carbons, so it's a di-substituted compound.

Wait, but the correct name would depend on the positions and the substituents. So, I think the structure is:

CH2Br-CH2-CHCl-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's a different structure. No, the original formula is CH3CHBrCHClCH2CH3. Let me number the carbons:

1 2 3 4 5
CH3 CHBr CHCl CH2 CH3

So, it's a straight chain, with Br on C2, Cl on C3, and a CH2 group on C4, which is connected to C3 and C5.

Wait, but that's a five-carbon chain, so the longest chain is five carbons with substituents on C2 and C3.

So, the parent chain is pentane. The substituents are Br on C2 and Cl on C3.

So, the correct name would be 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane? Or perhaps another name.

Wait, but wait, the substituents are on adjacent carbons. So, the position would be 2 and 3. So, the name would be 2-bromo and 3-chloro pentane.

Looking at the options, option B is 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane. Option A is 2-bromo, 3-chloropropane. Wait, propane is three carbons. So, that's not correct because our molecule has five carbons.

Wait, so the options require me to pick from A to J. Let me see the options again:

Option A: 2-bromo, 3-chloropropane. But propane is three carbons, which doesn't match our five. So A is wrong.

Option B: 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane. That could be correct if the substituents are on C2 and C3 of a five-carbon chain.

Option C: 2,3-dibromochloropentane. That seems to imply both Br and Cl are on the same carbon, but in this case, the substituents are on C2 and C3, not the same. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: trichlorodibromopentane. That would mean each of the three carbons in pentane has Cl and Br substituents. But in our case, only two substituents, each on adjacent carbons. So D is incorrect.

Option E: 2-chloro, 3-bromopentane. Wait, that would mean Cl on C2 and Br on C3. But the actual substituents are Br on C2 and Cl on C3, so this would have the same. So E is same as B?

Wait, no. Let me think. The correct name would list the substituents in the order of their positions, but the options might have the substituents written in a different order.

Wait, no. Let me look at option E: 2-chloro, 3-bromopentane. That implies Cl is on C2 and Br on C3. But in our molecule, Br is on C2 and Cl on C3. So E is same as B, but I'm not sure because the order might not matter in the name. Wait, but I think the correct order would be based on the main chain's substituents, regardless of the order of substituents in the name. So both B and E would correspond to the same structure.

Wait, looking again at the options, let me see:

Option B: 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane.

Option E: 2-chloro, 3-bromopentane.

That's the same molecule but with substituents reversed. So in IUPAC naming, does the order matter? I'm a bit fuzzy on this point. In IUPAC naming, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order. So Cl comes before Br, so the correct name would be 2-chloro, 3-bromopentane. Because Cl is before Br alphabetically, so the substituents are listed in that order.

Wait, but wait. Wait, when naming substituents, the substituent with the lower alphabetical order comes first. Cl is before Br, so in the correct name, the Cl would come first. So the correct name should be 2-chloro, 3-bromopentane. So option E is the correct one.

Wait, but that would mean that the correct answer is option E. But wait, looking back at the options, the options are:

A: 2-bromo, 3-chloropropane.

B: 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane.

C: 2,3-dibromochloropentane.

D: trichlorodibromopentane.

E: 2-chloro,3 -bromopentane.

F: 2,3-chlorobromopentane.

G: 2,3-bromochloropentane.

H: 3-bromo, 2-chloropentane.

I: dibromotrichloropentane.

J: dibromotrichloropropane.

So, the correct name is 2-chloro, 3-bromopentane, which is option E.

Wait, but wait, another thought: in the given molecule, the substituents are on C2 and C3. So in the IUPAC name, it's either 2-bromo, 3-chloro pentane or 2-chloro, 3-bromo pentane, depending on which substituent is first alphabetically.

Since Cl comes before Br, the chloro substituent comes first, so it's 2-chloro, 3-bromo. So the correct name is option E.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane, and E is the same but with the substituents reversed.

Wait, but in IUPAC naming, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order. So, you would list Cl first, then Br. So the substituent with Cl comes before Br, so the name would have Cl first. So option E is correct.

Wait, but option B lists Br first. So would that be incorrect? Wait, no. Because the substituents are Br and Cl. Cl is alphabetically before Br, so the correct order would be Cl first. So the name would be 2-chloro, 3-bromo pentane. So E is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option E is 2-chloro, 3-bromopentane. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait a minute, I'm getting confused. Let me think: when you have two substituents on adjacent carbons, like 2 and 3, and one is Cl and the other is Br, which comes first in the name?

In IUPAC nomenclature, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order. So Cl comes before Br, so Cl is first. So the name would be 2-chloro, 3-bromo pentane. So option E is correct.

So the correct answer should be option E: 2-chloro, 3-bromopentane.

The compound in question is CH3CHBrCHClCH2CH3, which has the molecular formula C5H12. The structure of the molecule is a straight-chain pentane with bromine (Br) on carbon 2 and chlorine (Cl) on carbon 3. To determine the correct IUPAC name, the following steps are taken:

1. **Identify the parent chain**: The longest chain containing all the carbons in the molecule is pentane.

2. **Number the carbons**: The bromine is on carbon 2, and the chlorine is on carbon 3. Thus, the molecule has substituents on adjacent carbons (2 and 3).

3. **Determine the substituents**: The substituents are bromine (Br) on carbon 2 and chlorine (Cl) on carbon 3.

4. **Apply IUPAC rules**: Substituents with higher atomic numbers (e.g., Cl) are listed alphabetically before those with lower atomic numbers (e.g., Br). Therefore, the correct order is 2-chloro, 3-bromo.

5. **Evaluate the options**:  
   - **Option A**: 2-bromo, 3-chloropropane. Incorrect, as propane (3 carbons) does not match the five-carbon structure of the molecule.  
   - **Option B**: 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane. Incorrect, as the substituents are listed in the wrong order (Cl comes before Br).  
   - **Option C**: 2,3-dibromochloropentane. Incorrect, as there is only one bromine and one chlorine substituent.  
   - **Option D**: trichlorodibromopentane. Incorrect, as the molecule has only two substituents.  
   - **Option E**: 2-chloro, 3-bromopentane. Correct, as it lists the substituents in alphabetical order (Cl before Br) and matches the molecular structure.  
   - **Option F**: 2,3-chlorobromopentane. Incorrect, as the order of substituents is reversed.  
   - **Option G**: 2,3-bromochloropentane. Incorrect, as the order of substituents is reversed.  
   - **Option H**: 3-bromo, 2-chloropentane. Incorrect, as the substituents are listed in the wrong order (Br comes before Cl).  
   - **Option I**: dibromotrichloropentane. Incorrect, as the molecule has only one bromine and one chlorine substituent.  
   - **Option J**: dibromotrichloropropane. Incorrect, as propane (3 carbons) does not match the five-carbon structure of the molecule.

The correct name of the compound is **2-chloro, 3-bromopentane**, which corresponds to **Option E**.
