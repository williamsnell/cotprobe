Question:

For the past 20 years a city by the beach has been a popular location for surfboarding. City residents have recently complained that the surfers are creating a public nuisance by littering the beaches, harassing sunbathers, and injuring swimmers with their surfboards. As a consequence, the city adopted an ordinance prohibiting all surfing on its beaches. The newly enacted ordinance further prohibited the sale of surfboards within the city's limits. An out of state surfboard manufacturer had planned to sell a new line of fiberglass surfboards in the city in the upcoming year. This is now precluded by the recently adopted measure. If the manufacturer seeks to enjoin application of the city ordinance, which of the following is the WEAKEST defense for the city?

Options:

A: There is no case or controversy.
B: The manufacturer's case is moot.
C: The manufacturer lacks standing.
D: The case is not ripe.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with the concept of standing in the context of an ordinance. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a city that recently adopted an ordinance prohibiting surfboard usage on its beaches. The out-of-state manufacturer, who planned to sell surfboards in the city, now faces a situation where the city's new ordinance will prevent them from doing so. The question is about whether the manufacturer can seek to enjoin the application of the city's ordinance.

The key issue here is standing. From what I remember, a party is considered "standing" if they've taken sufficient time to prepare for the possible adverse effect of their action. The standard is that they must have taken some time, even if it's just a few months, to show they've had the opportunity to prepare, mitigate, or overcome any potential negative consequences.

So, the manufacturer's case would need to show that they had adequate notice, took steps to protect themselves, and that if the ordinance is passed, their actions would have a positive outcome. In this case, the manufacturer is planning to sell surfboards, which are prohibited by the city's new ordinance. So, they're hoping that the court will find that this action would not only prevent the sale but also protect their business.

The options given are A, B, C, D. Let's think about each.

Option A: "There is no case or controversy." Hmm. I'm not sure. If there's no case or controversy, that might mean the court hasn't heard the issue yet. But the question is about whether the manufacturer can seek to enjoin the application, not whether the case hasn't been heard. So A might not be the best answer.

Option B: "The manufacturer's case is moot." Moot case is when the plaintiff cannot succeed because there's no chance of recovery. If the manufacturer's case is moot, the court would just decide it's not relevant. But the question is about standing, not whether the case is moot. So B probably isn't the right answer.

Option C: "The manufacturer lacks standing." That makes sense because if the manufacturer hasn't taken any steps to show they've had time to prepare, they lack standing. They'd have to wait a few months to take steps like preparing some kind of notice, preparing for the possible adverse effect, etc. If they don't take any steps, they can't be considered standing. So C would be a valid defense.

Option D: "The case is not ripe." I think "ri red" is a legal term that means the case isn't ready for ruling yet. So if the case hasn't been heard, the court won't do anything. But again, if the manufacturer is seeking to enjoin the application, it's more about the action they took, not the case not being ready yet. So D might not be the best answer.

Putting it together: the manufacturer needs to have time to prepare. If they don't, they lack standing. So option C is the correct answer.

The correct answer is C: "The manufacturer lacks standing." The manufacturer needs time to prepare for the adverse effect of the ordinance, such as mitigating risks, preparing a notice, or taking steps to protect themselves. Without such preparation, they lack standing and cannot enjoin the application.

Answer: C
