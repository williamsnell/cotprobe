Okay, so I've got this accounting question here about consignment transactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me think it through.

The question is about what amount of consigned inventory Stone Co. should include in their December 31 year 1 balance sheet. The options are A to J, with various numbers. 

Alright, let's break down the problem. Consignment transactions involve goods being shipped by one company and received by another. But I need to determine which parts of this are included as inventory in Stone's books.

First, the details given:

1. Inventory shipped on consignment to Omega Co. is $36,000. So, that's what Stone shipped to Omega. But wait, when you ship goods on consignment, the consignee (Omega Co.) owns the goods, right? So, when Stone shipped to Omega, they're not the ones holding the inventory—they're the consignor. So, the inventory should be considered by Omega, not by Stone. But wait, Stone's balance sheet is about their own inventory. So the inventory that was shipped to Omega is no longer Stone's own. It would be in Omega's inventory, not in Stone's. So this inventory isn't part of Stone's inventory at December 31. So we can ignore this part.

2. Then, there's a Freight paid by Stone to Omega. Oh, wait, the question says the freight was paid by Stone. So that's a cost of goods sold, I think. Because when you ship goods, you have to pay shipping costs—those are expensed as part of the cost of goods sold. So that $1,800 is not part of the inventory on Stone's books at year end.

3. Next, inventory received on consignment from Gamma Co. is $24,000. So, Gamma sent goods to Stone via consignment. That means Stone owns the goods, so this should be included in Stone's inventory. 

4. Then, the freight paid by Gamma is $1000. That's the cost of shipping from Gamma to Stone. Again, this is a cost of goods sold, not part of the inventory Stone holds. So that's not included in the balance sheet either.

So, putting it all together. The inventory that is part of Stone's inventory is the $24,000 received from Gamma. The other two transactions were either paid for or were goods shipped to someone else, and thus not part of Stone's inventory.

Wait, but wait. I remember that when goods are consigned, the consignor (Stone) holds the goods until they are sold or received. If the goods are received and not sold, they're part of the inventory until they're sold. But in this case, no sales were made during December, so those goods are still in Stone's inventory. So yes, the $24,000 is part of their inventory. The $36,000 was sent to Omega, which is where it goes, so not included. The $1800 paid to Omega is part of the cost of goods sold.

So the amount to include is $24,000. Looking at the options, option C is $24,000—so the correct answer should be C.
</think>

The correct answer is C: $24,000. 

**Explanation:**
- Inventory shipped to Omega Co. ($36,000) is passed through Omega Co.'s balance sheet and is not included in Stone's inventory.
- Freight paid by Stone Co. ($1,800) is considered a cost of goods sold and is not part of Stone's inventory.
- Inventory received from Gamma Co. ($24,000) is owned by Stone Co., so it is included in their inventory.
- Freight paid by Gamma Co. ($1,000) is another cost of goods sold and is not part of Stone's inventory.

Thus, the amount of consigned inventory included in Stone's December 31, Year 1 balance sheet is $24,000. 

Answer: C
