Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the force between two positive charges. Hmm, right, Coulomb's Law comes into play here. 

Alright, let me recall what Coulomb's Law says. I think it's F equals k times q1 times q2 divided by r squared. Oh wait, yeah, F = k * (q1 * q2) / r². Right, where k is Coulomb's constant. I remember the value of k is 8.988 × 10^9 N·m²/C², but maybe I can approximate it as 9 × 10^9 for simplicity in exams. 

The question gives the charges as 100 microcoulombs and 200 microcoulombs. Oh wait, micro is 1e-6, so 100 micro is 1e-4 C and 200 is 2e-4 C. Or maybe I should convert them to coulombs. Yeah, that's right. So 100e-6 C and 200e-6 C. 

The distance between them is 3 centimeters. Oh wait, I need to convert that to meters because the standard unit in the formula is meters. 3 cm is 0.03 meters. Got it.

Putting it all together, F = k * (q1 * q2) / r². Let me plug in the numbers. So F = 9e9 * (1e-4 * 2e-4) / (0.03)^2. Let me calculate the numerator and denominator separately.

First, the numerator: 1e-4 * 2e-4 is 2e-8. Then multiply by k: 9e9 * 2e-8. Let me calculate that. 9e9 is 9*10^9, 2e-8 is 2*10^-8. Multiplying those gives (9*2) * (10^9 * 10^-8) = 18 * 10^(9-8) = 18 * 10^1 = 180. Okay, so the numerator is 180 N·m²/C² if I'm not mistaken. Wait, no, wait—wait, wait, wait. No, because the units might have already been considered in k. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Let's do it step by step. F = (9e9) * (2e-8) / (0.03)^2. Let me compute 9e9 * 2e-8 first. 9e9 is 9*10^9, 2e-8 is 2*10^-8. Multiplying them gives 18 * 10^(9-8) = 18 * 10^1 = 180. Then, the denominator is (0.03)^2. 0.03 squared is 0.0009 or 9e-4. So now the equation is F = 180 / 9e-4. Let's compute that.

Wait, 180 divided by 0.0009. Hmm. Let me think about division. 180 ÷ 0.0009. Since 0.0009 is 9e-4, and 180 is 1.8e2. So 1.8e2 / 9e-4 = (1.8/9) * 10^(2 + 4) = 0.2 * 10^6 = 2 * 10^5. So F is 2e5 Newtons? Wait, that seems really high. Because 2e5 is 200,000 N, which is like 200,000 Newtons of force. 

Wait a second, but wait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through it again.

First, q1 = 100e-6 C, q2=200e-6 C.

r=0.03 m.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So F = (8.988e9) * (100e-6) * (200e-6) / (0.03)^2.

Let me compute the numerator first: 8.988e9 * (100e-6) * (200e-6) = 8.988e9 * (20,000e-12) because 100e-6 *200e-6 = 20,000e-12. Wait, 200e-6 is 2e-4, so 100e-6 is 1e-4, their product is 1e-8. 1e-8 * 8.988e9 = 8.988e9 * 1e-8 = 8.988e1 = 89.88. Oh wait, but wait, that doesn’t seem right because I think I'm missing something. Wait, 100e-6 is 1e-4, 200e-6 is 2e-4. So 1e-4 * 2e-4 = 2e-8. Multiply by 8.988e9 gives 8.988e9 * 2e-8 = (8.988 * 2) * (1e9 * 1e-8) = 17.976 * 1e1 = 179.76. So the numerator is 179.76.

The denominator is (0.03)^2 = 0.0009. So F = 179.76 / 0.0009 = let's compute that. 

Hmm, 179.76 divided by 0.0009. Let me think of 0.0009 as 9e-4. So 179.76 / 9e-4. Let's compute 179.76 / 0.0009. 

Alternatively, I can write it as 179.76 * (1 / 0.0009) = 179.76 * 1111.11... (since 1/0.0009 is approximately 1111.11). So 179.76 * 1111.11. Let's calculate 180 * 1111.11 = 199,999.8. So approximately 200,000 N. 

Wait, but that's the same result as before. So F is approximately 2e5 Newtons. 

Looking at the options, option J is 2e5 N. So that's the answer. 

But wait, the options are given as A to J, with each option being a different multiple of 1e5 or 1e6. So J is 2e5 N. So the correct choice is J.

To determine the force between two positive charges of 100 μC and 200 μC separated by 3 cm, we use Coulomb's Law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{q_1 \cdot q_2}{r^2}
\]

where:
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) (Coulomb's constant),
- \( q_1 = 100 \, \mu\text{C} = 100 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C} = 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{C} \),
- \( q_2 = 200 \, \mu\text{C} = 200 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C} = 2 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{C} \),
- \( r = 3 \, \text{cm} = 0.03 \, \text{m} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the numerator
\[
q_1 \cdot q_2 = (1 \times 10^{-4}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-4}) = 2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{C}^2
\]
\[
k \cdot (q_1 \cdot q_2) = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-8}) = 179.76
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the denominator
\[
r^2 = (0.03)^2 = 0.0009 \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the force
\[
F = \frac{179.76}{0.0009} = 200,000 \, \text{N}
\]

Thus, the force between the charges is approximately \( 2 \times 10^5 \, \text{N} \).

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option is **J: \( 2 \times 10^5 \, \text{N} \)**.
