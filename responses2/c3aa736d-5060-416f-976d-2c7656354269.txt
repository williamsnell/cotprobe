Question:

Semir rolls a six-sided die every morning to determine what he will have for breakfast. If he rolls a 1 or 2, he takes time to cook himself a big breakfast. If he rolls a 3 or larger he grabs a quick lighter breakfast. When he cooks himself a big breakfast, there is a 15% chance he will be late for school. If he has a lighter breakfast, there is a 6% chance he will be late for school. What is the probability Semir will be on time for school any given day?

Options:

A: 0.85
B: 0.1
C: 0.5
D: 0.99
E: 0.91
F: 0.94
G: 0.09
H: 0.75
I: 0.8
J: 0.21

Okay, let's tackle this probability problem. So, Semir is rolling a die every morning to decide his breakfast. I need to find the probability that he's on time for school any given day.

First, let's understand the problem. The die has six sides, so each outcome (1 through 6) is equally likely, each with a probability of 1/6.

He rolls the die to decide his breakfast:

- If it's a 1 or 2, he takes a big breakfast. So that's two outcomes.
- If it's 3 or higher, he takes a lighter breakfast. That's four outcomes.

Wait, no: 3,4,5,6 are four numbers. So 1 and 2 are two numbers. So the probabilities for each breakfast are:

Big breakfast: 2/6 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333...
Lighter breakfast: 4/6 = 2/3 ≈ 0.666...

Now, each type of breakfast has a chance of being late. If he has a big breakfast, there's a 15% chance he's late. So the probability he's on time for a big breakfast is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Similarly, if he has a lighter breakfast, he has a 6% chance of being late. So the on-time probability there is 1 - 0.06 = 0.94.

Wait, but the question is the probability he's on time any day. So for each scenario (big or lighter breakfast), we have on-time probabilities. Then we need to find the overall probability by considering each scenario's likelihood.

So, the overall probability of being on time is the sum of the probabilities of each scenario happening multiplied by the probability of being on time in that scenario.

So, formula-wise, it's:

P(on time) = P(big breakfast) * P(on time | big) + P(lighter) * P(on time | lighter)

Plugging in the numbers:

P(on time) = (2/6) * 0.85 + (4/6) * 0.94.

Let me compute each part:

2/6 is 1/3, which is approximately 0.3333.

0.3333 * 0.85 = Let me calculate that. 0.3333 * 0.8 = 0.26664, 0.3333 * 0.05 = 0.016665. Sum is about 0.2833.

Then, 4/6 is 2/3, approximately 0.6667.

0.6667 * 0.94. Let's see: 0.6667 * 0.9 = 0.6, 0.6667 * 0.04 = ~0.026668. So 0.6 + 0.026668 = 0.626668.

Now add both parts: 0.2833 + 0.626668 ≈ 0.909968, so approximately 0.91.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.91. So the probability is about 91% on time, so the correct answer should be E: 0.91.

To determine the probability of Semir being on time for school, we consider two scenarios: a big breakfast (1 or 2) and a lighter breakfast (3 or higher). 

- For a big breakfast (probability 1/3), the on-time probability is 0.85 (85%).
- For a lighter breakfast (probability 2/3), the on-time probability is 0.94 (94%).

The overall on-time probability is calculated as:

(1/3) * 0.85 + (2/3) * 0.94 ≈ 0.91.

The closest option is E: 0.91.

Answer: E: 0.91
