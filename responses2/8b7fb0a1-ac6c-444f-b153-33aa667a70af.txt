Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a first-order reaction, and I'm given the rate constant and the time, so I need to find the remaining mass of the starting material.

Wait, first-order reactions... Oh right, the formula for the concentration of a reactant in a first-order reaction is ln([A]₀/[A]) = kt. Right, or sometimes it's written as [A] = [A]₀ e^(-kt). Since this is a mass problem, I can probably use the same formula, treating mass as a concentration.

The given data: the specific rate constant k is 86 h^-1. Hmm, h is hours, so that's a pretty high rate. But the time given is 58 seconds. I need to convert the time into hours to match the units. Because the rate is per hour, so I should convert 58 seconds into hours.

So, how many hours is 58 seconds? Let's see, 1 hour is 60 minutes, which is 3600 seconds. So 58 s is 58/3600 hours. Let me compute that. 58 divided by 3600: 58 ÷ 3600 ≈ 0.01611 hours. So k is 86 per hour, and time is 0.01611 hours.

Now, I can plug into the equation. The initial mass [A]₀ is 0.0500 g. I need to find [A], the remaining mass.

So, using [A] = [A]₀ e^(-kt). Let me compute kt first. k is 86, t is 58/3600.

So kt = 86 * (58/3600). Let me calculate that. 86 * 58 is... let's see, 80*58=4640, 6*58=348; total 4640+348=4988. So 4988 divided by 3600. Let me compute that: 4988 ÷ 3600 ≈ 1.3855.

So, kt ≈ 1.3855. Then, e^(-1.3855). Hmm, what's e^1.3855? I'll need to recall some values. I know e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.386 is about e^(ln(4))=4, since ln(4)=1.386. So e^1.3855 is approximately 4. So e^(-1.3855) is 1/4, which is 0.25.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately. Let's see, 1.3855 is approximately ln(4) (since ln(4) is about 1.3863). So e^1.3855 is e^(ln(4) - 0.0008) ≈ 4 * e^(-0.0008). e^0.0008 is approximately 1 + 0.0008 + (0.0008)^2/2, which is about 1.0008. So e^-0.0008 is about 0.9992. So 4 * 0.9992 = 3.9968. So e^(-1.3855) ≈ 0.25 approximately. So e^(-kt) is approximately 0.25.

So [A] = 0.0500 g * 0.25 = 0.0125 g. Hmm, wait but looking at the options, 0.0125 g is option D. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes the calculation could be more precise.

Wait, maybe I should compute kt more accurately. Let me recalculate kt.

k is 86 per hour, t is 58 seconds. Let me compute 58/3600 as a decimal. 58 divided by 3600. Let's do that division.

3600 goes into 58 0 times. So 0., then 580 goes into 3600. Let me compute 58 * 1000=58,000. Wait, no, perhaps I should calculate 58 / 3600. Let's compute 58 divided by 3600.

3600 is 3.6e3. So 58 / 3.6e3 = (58/3.6) * 1e-3.

58/3.6 is approximately 16.111... So 16.111e-3 = 0.016111 hours. So k*t is 86 * (58/3600) = 86 * 0.016111 = ?

Compute 86 * 0.016111. 86 * 0.01 is 0.86, 86 * 0.006 is 0.516. 86 * 0.000111 is about 0.009546. So 0.86 + 0.516 = 1.376 (approx). Adding 0.009546 gives about 1.3855. So same as before.

So e^(-1.3855) = 1/e^(1.3855) = 1/4. So 0.0500 * 0.25 = 0.0125 grams.

But wait, another approach: using exact values. Let me compute kt more accurately.

k =86 per hour. t =58/3600 hours.

So kt=86*(58)/(3600) = (86*58)/(3600) = let's compute 86*58.

86 *50=4300, 86*8=688. So 4300 +688=4988. So 4988/3600 = 1.385555... So approximately 1.38556.

So e^(-1.38556) = 1 / e^(1.38556) = 1/4.0000... approximately? Wait, because e^(1.3863) is 4. So 1.38556 is a little less than 1.3863, so e^(-1.38556) is a little more than 0.25. Wait, no: e^x increases as x increases. So if x is less than 1.3863, then e^x is less than 4, so e^(-x) is greater than 0.25.

Wait, let me think. If x is 1.38556, which is just a tiny bit less than ln(4) (which is 1.386294...). So e^(1.38556) is a bit less than 4, so e^(-1.38556) is a bit more than 0.25.

Hmm, but for precise calculation, perhaps it's better to use more accurate exponentials.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the remaining mass. Let me make sure I'm using the correct formula.

Yes, the correct formula is [A] = [A]₀ e^(-kt). So using this, I get [A] = 0.0500 g * e^(-kt).

So, when I calculate kt=1.38556, e^(-1.38556) is approximately 0.2502 or so. Let me compute e^(-1.38556) more accurately.

I can use a calculator for this. Alternatively, I can use a Taylor series approximation.

But perhaps it's easier to remember that ln(4)=1.386294.

So, 1.38556 is 1.386294 minus 0.000734. So, e^(-1.38556) = e^(-1.386294 + 0.000734) = e^(-1.386294) * e^(0.000734) = (1/4) * (1 + 0.000734 + (0.000734)^2/2) ) approximately.

So 1 / 4 is 0.25. 0.000734 is approximately 0.000734. Squared is about 5.389e-7. Divided by 2 is about 2.6945e-7.

So e^0.000734 ≈ 1 + 0.000734 + 2.6945e-7 ≈ 1.000734.

So e^(-1.38556) ≈ 0.25 * 1.000734 ≈ 0.2501835.

So [A] = 0.0500 g * 0.2501835 ≈ 0.012509 g.

Wait, so approximately 0.012509 grams. Looking at the options, option D is 0.0125 g, which is the closest.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D is 0.0125, which is 0.012500 g. So that seems right.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of kt.

Wait, another approach: using the exponents.

Wait, 86 h^{-1} is the rate constant. So the time is 58 seconds, which is 58/(60*60) = 58/3600 ≈0.016111 hours.

So kt=86 * 0.016111 = ?

Let me compute 86 * 0.016111.

Well, 86 * 0.01 is 0.86.

86 * 0.006111 = ?

Wait, 0.006111 is 6.111e-3.

So 86 * 6.111e-3 = 86 * 0.006111.

Hmm, 80 * 0.006111 = 0.48888.

6 * 0.006111 = 0.036666.

Adding them: 0.48888 + 0.036666 = 0.525546.

So total kt is 0.86 + 0.525546 = 1.385546.

So, same as before, e^(-1.385546) ≈ 0.25018.

So 0.0500 * 0.25018 = 0.012509 g.

Which is 0.012509 grams. The options are A to J. So the closest one is option D: 0.0125 g.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 0.0125 and option B is 0.00078, which is much smaller. So why isn't the answer option D? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think about the units again. Oh wait, no, the rate constant is given as 86 per hour, which is per hour. But the time given is in seconds. So I correctly converted it to hours.

Wait, another thought: What if the units were different? Oh wait, no, the question says the rate is 86 h^-1, which is per hour. So converting 58 seconds into hours is correct.

Hmm, so the calculation leads us to approximately 0.0125 g, which is option D.

Wait, but looking again at the options, another possibility is that perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me make sure.

The formula is [A] = [A]₀ e^(-kt). So the time is in hours, and k is per hour. So yes, that's correct.

Another thought: Did I mix up k and t? No, because we're using kt.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use [A] = [A]₀ (1 - kt) if it's a half-life scenario, but that's for first-order for a half-life. Wait, no, that's not applicable here. The formula I used is correct.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps using ln([A]/[A]₀) = -kt.

So, ln([A]/0.05) = -86 * (58/3600).

Compute (58/3600) = 0.016111 hours.

So, ln([A]/0.05) = -86 * 0.016111 = -1.385546.

So, [A]/0.05 = e^(-1.385546) ≈ 0.25018.

Then [A] = 0.05 * 0.25018 ≈ 0.012509 g.

So same as before, 0.0125 g. So option D.

Wait, but I must have made a mistake because I thought the time was 58 seconds, but perhaps the formula requires time in same units as k.

Wait another approach: let's compute the time in hours. So 58 s = 58/(60*60) = 58/3600 hours = 0.016111 hours.

k is 86 per hour. So kt = 86 * 0.016111 = 1.385546.

Wait, but another idea: perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think about the units.

Wait, the formula is correct because the units of k are per hour, so the product is per hour * hours = unitless (dimensionless exponent), so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option D, 0.0125 g. But wait, looking at the options, option D is 0.0125, and the others are smaller. Hmm.

Wait another possibility: Did I miscalculate kt? Let's recompute kt.

k=86 per hour.

t=58 seconds =58/3600 hours.

So kt=86*(58/3600) = (86 *58)/3600 = (86*58)=4988, so 4988/3600.

Compute that: 3600*1 is 3600. 4988-3600=1388. So 1388/3600=0.38555555...

Wait, 3600 * 0.385555 is 1386. So 4988/3600 is 1 + 1388/3600.

Which is 1 + 0.385555... =1.385555... hours.

So that's correct.

So kt is about 1.385555. e^(-1.385555) is approximately 0.25. So 0.05 * 0.25 =0.0125.

So option D is 0.0125.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D is 0.0125 g, which is exactly 1/80 of 0.05 g. 0.05 /80 is 0.000625, wait no. 0.05 / 8 is 0.00625, 0.05 / 16 is 0.003125, but I'm getting 0.0125, which is 0.05 * 0.25. So this is correct.

Wait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought that 86 is a very high rate, implying that the sample will decrease a lot in 58 seconds.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e^(-1.385555). Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator, e^(-1.385555) ≈ 0.250183. So 0.05 *0.250183 is approximately 0.012509 g.

So the precise value is approximately 0.01251 g, which is about 0.0125 g. So the correct option is D.

But wait, I'm looking at the answer options again, and I see option G is 0.0625 g. Oh wait, no. The options are:

A: 0.00625

B: 0.003125

C: 0.0015625

D: 0.0125

E: 0.015625

F: 0.01875

G: 0.025

H: 0.0270703125

I: 0.03125

J: 0.03515625.

Wait, but the right answer is 0.0125, which is option D.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me think again. The rate is given as 86 h^-1, which is 86 per hour. So for 58 seconds, which is 58/3600 hours, the calculation is correct.

Wait, another approach: using the half-life formula. The half-life t_1/2 is ln(2)/k.

So t_1/2 = ln(2)/86 = approximately 0.00386 hours.

Wait, 0.00386 hours is about 0.00386 * 3600 = 13.9 g. Wait, no, that's not relevant.

Wait, but the half-life is the time it takes for the substance to reduce by half. So if the sample is 0.05 g, and the half-life is 0.00386 hours, then in 0.00386 hours, the sample would be 0.025 g. But in this problem, the time is 58 seconds, which is way less than the half-life. So the sample would decrease by a factor of e^(-kt), which is e^(-1.385555) ≈ 0.25.

So, yeah, 0.05 * 0.25 = 0.0125 g.

So the correct answer is D.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the remaining mass of a reactant in a first-order reaction:

\[
[A] = [A]_0 e^{-kt}
\]

### Step 1: Convert Time to Hours
The given time is 58 seconds. To convert this into hours:

\[
t = \frac{58}{3600} \approx 0.016111 \, \text{hours}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( kt \)
The rate constant \( k \) is 86 per hour. Multiply \( k \) by \( t \):

\[
kt = 86 \times 0.016111 \approx 1.3855 \, \text{(dimensionless exponent)}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( e^{-kt} \)
We need to calculate \( e^{-1.3855} \). Recognizing that \( e^{1.3863} = 4 \) (since \( \ln(4) \approx 1.3863 \)), we find:

\[
e^{-1.3855} \approx 0.25
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Remaining Mass
The initial mass is 0.0500 g. Using the formula:

\[
[A] = 0.0500 \times 0.25 = 0.0125 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 5: Match with Options
The closest option to the calculated value is **0.0125 g**. 

### Final Answer:
**D) 0.0125 g**
