Okay, so I have this question about marginal costs, and I'm a bit new to the concept. Let me think it through step by step. 

Marginal cost, as I remember, is related to economics, specifically in the context of production costs. I think it's about the cost of producing one more unit. But wait, I should make sure I'm getting it right.

The question asks what marginal cost means, and the options are A through J. Let me go through each option to see which one fits.

Option A: the cost of all produced units. Hmm, that seems like total cost, not marginal. Marginal would be just one unit.

Option B: the fixed cost associated with the production facility. Wait, fixed costs are those that don't change with production levels, like rent or salaries. Marginal cost should be variable, not fixed.

Option C: the cost of total production. That's again total cost, not marginal. Marginal is about the addition.

Option D: the cost of initial unit of production. That sounds like the first unit's cost, not the general marginal cost.

Option E: the additional cost of one more unit of production. That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. Marginal cost is the cost to produce one more unit beyond a certain point.

Option F: the total revenue generated from the sale of one additional unit. That's marginal revenue, not marginal cost. Revenue is different because it's about income, not cost.

Option G: the average cost of all units produced. Average cost is total cost divided by the number of units, so that's average, not marginal.

Option H: the cost savings realized from producing one additional unit. That's marginal benefit, which is similar but not exactly the same as marginal cost. Although it's related, cost savings might not be the same as the cost of producing that unit.

Option I: the difference in cost between two levels of production. That could relate to marginal cost, but it's more general. Marginal cost specifically refers to the change between two levels, but it's not just the difference; it's the rate of change.

Option J: the cost of raw materials for all units produced. That's total raw material cost, not the cost per unit.

So, going back, E seems to describe marginal cost correctly. It's the additional cost to produce one more unit beyond the current level. The others don't fit as well. For example, B is fixed, which is total fixed, so E is the correct answer.

The correct answer is E: the additional cost of one more unit of production.

**Answer: E**
