Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the torque developed by an engine. Let me see. The question says that the drive shaft of an automobile rotates at 3600 revolutions per minute and transmits 80 horsepower to the rear wheels. I need to find the torque and choose the correct option from the given choices.

Hmm, I remember that power and torque are related, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh wait, power is torque multiplied by angular velocity, right? So the formula should be Power (P) equals Torque (T) multiplied by angular speed (ω). 

Wait, but torque is in foot-pounds, and angular speed is in radians per second or revolutions per minute. Oh wait, the given speed is in revolutions per minute (rev/min), so I need to convert that into a radian per second or something.

Wait, let me think. I think the formula is P = T * ω, where P is power, T is torque, and ω is angular velocity in radians per second. Alternatively, sometimes I've seen it in units where it's revolutions per minute. Oh, right, there's a formula that combines both.

Wait, another approach. I think power can also be expressed as P = 60 * (T * ω), where ω is in rpm and converted to rad/s. Because when you have hp, it's easier to work in horsepower and convert to torque.

Wait, maybe I should recall the correct units. Let me jot down the variables.

Power: 80 horsepower (hp), which I think is equal to 80 * 745.7 ft-lb/s. Because 1 horsepower is 550 ft-lb per second, so 80 * 550 is 44,000 ft-lb/s.

Wait, but wait: 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/s, so 80 hp is 80 * 550 = 44,000 ft-lb/s. Right.

Now, the formula for power when we have torque and speed in rpm is P = (T * ω) / 12, where ω is in rpm. Wait, no, more accurately, I think the formula is P = (T * ω) * (2π/60), because ω in radians per second is (rev per min) * (2π rad/rev) * (1 min/60 sec) ) = (rev/min) * π/30. So ω = (2π/60) rev/min * (rev to rad). So, more precisely, ω in rad/s = (rev/min) * (2π/60).

So to get P in horsepower, it's (T * ω) / 12. Because we have to convert hp to ft-lb/s.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. I think the correct formula is P (in horsepower) = (T (in lb-ft) * ω (in rpm)) / 525.2, because 525.2 is the conversion factor from horsepower to lb-ft per second.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. I think the relation is P (hp) = (T (lb-ft) * ω (rpm)) / 525.2. Because 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/s, and 1 lb-ft is 1 lb-ft. So, 1 hp = (550 ft-lb/s) → 550 ft-lb/s is 550 ft-lb/s. But 1 lb-ft is 1 ft-lb, so 550 lb-ft/s is 550 ft-lb/s. Wait, but 550 ft-lb/s is actually 550 lb-ft/s because 1 lb-ft is 1 ft-lb.

So, if P is in horsepower, then:

P = (T * ω) / 525.2

Because 1 hp = (550 ft-lb/s) → 550 ft-lb/s = 550 lb-ft/s. So, 550 ft-lb/s is 550 lb-ft/s.

So the formula is P = (T * ω) / 550.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look this up in my mind. Oh right, the formula is P (hp) = (T (lb-ft) * ω (rpm)) / (525.2). Or wait, I think I might have the units wrong. Let me think again.

Power in horsepower is related to torque in lb-ft and angular speed in rpm by the formula:

Power (hp) = (Torque (lb-ft) × Angular speed (rpm)) / 525.2

Alternatively, sometimes people use 550 instead of 525.2 because 1 hp is 550 ft-lb per second. So, perhaps the formula is:

P (hp) = (T × ω) / 550

Wait, but another way to think is: 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/s. So, if we have T (lb-ft) and ω (rev/min), to get power in horsepower, we have to calculate (T × ω) / 550.

Alternatively, sometimes it's written as:

Power (hp) = (T × ω) / 525.2

Wait, perhaps I should better derive it. Let me think about the units.

Power is in horse power. Horse power is 550 ft-lb per second.

Torque is in lb-ft (force times distance). So torque is T = force × radius, so force is T/r.

Angular speed is in radian per second, which can be converted from rev/min.

So, power (hp) = (T × ω) / 550. Because:

T = force (lb) × radius (ft) → so T has units lb-ft.

ω is in rad/s. But to get the equivalent in terms of ft-lb per second, which is hp.

Wait, because 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/s.

So, the power in ft-lb/s is T * ω (converted to rad/s).

So, P (ft-lb/s) = T (lb-ft) × ω (rad/s)

Then, P (hp) = P (ft-lb/s) / 550.

But ω in rad/s is equal to (rev/min) * (2π rad/rev) * (1 min/60 s) ) = (rev/min) * (π/30) rad/s.

So, ω (rad/s) = (3600 rev/min) * (2π rad/rev) * (1 min/60 s) ) → Wait, no. Wait, the given ω is 3600 rev/min, but we need to convert that to rad/s.

So ω (rad/s) = 3600 rev/min * (2π rad/rev) * (1 min/60 s) ) = (3600 * 2π) / 60 = 3600 / 60 * 2π = 60 * 2π = 120π rad/s.

Wait, wait no, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 3600 rev/min * (2π rad/rev) = 3600 * 2π rad/min.

Then multiply by (1 min/60 s): (3600 * 2π) / 60 = 60 * 2π = 120π rad/s.

So ω = 120π rad/s ≈ 376.99 rad/s.

Wait, now putting it all together.

P (ft-lb/s) = T (lb-ft) * 120π (rad/s)

Then P (hp) = P (ft-lb/s) / 550.

So, rearranging: T = P (hp) * 550 / (120π)

Because P (hp) = (T * ω) / 550 → T = (P * 550) / ( ω * 550 ) → Wait, no, sorry, let me re-arrange.

We have P (hp) = (T * ω (rad/s)) / 550.

So, solving for T: T = (P * 550) / (ω * 550) ?

Wait, no. Let me correct. Let me write the formula again.

P (hp) = (T * ω) / 550.

We can rearrange this to solve for T:

T = (P * 550) / ω.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because P = (T * ω) / 550 → T = (P * 550) / ω.

Wait, no, wait. Let me solve for T:

P = (T * ω) / 550 → T = (P * 550) / ω.

Wait, that can't be right because I think the units would make sense. Let me check the units.

P is in hp, which is unitless in terms of ft-lb/s. So P has units of (ft-lb/s). ω is in rad/s.

So T (lb-ft) = (P * 550) / ( ω ). Because:

Multiply both sides by ω: P * ω = T * 550 → T = (P * ω ) / 550.

Wait, that's different. So earlier I had ω in rad/s, so T = (P hp * ω rad/s) / 550. So, yes, that's correct.

Wait, but in our case, the given P is in hp, and ω is in rad/s. So T = (P * ω) / 550.

Wait, but wait, another way to think. Let me go back to the initial problem.

The drive shaft is rotating at 3600 rev/min. The power transmitted is 80 hp. So, what's the torque?

I think I can use the formula P (hp) = (T * ω) / 550.

So, rearranged, T = (P * 550) / ω.

So substituting the numbers:

P = 80 hp.

ω = 3600 rev/min.

But I'll need ω in rad/s. So, 3600 rev/min = 3600 * (2π rad) / 60 s.

Wait, 3600 / 60 = 60. 60 * 2π = 120π rad/s.

So ω = 120π rad/s.

So T = (80 * 550) / (120π).

Let me compute that.

80 * 550 = 44,000.

Denominator: 120 * π ≈ 376.991.

So T ≈ 44000 / 376.991 ≈ ?

Let me compute this division.

44000 / 376.991.

Well, 376.991 is approximately 377.

44000 divided by 377:

Let me compute 44000 ÷ 377.

Hmm. Let me approximate:

377 * 116 = ?

377 * 100 = 37,700.

377 * 16 = 6,032.

So 37,700 +6,032 = 43,732.

That's 116 * 377 = 43,732. Which is less than 44,000.

The difference is 44,000 -43,732= 268.

So 268 /377 ≈ 0.713.

So approximately 116.713 lb-ft.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B: 105, option C:110, etc.

Wait, maybe my calculation is a bit off. Let me do it more accurately.

Compute 44000 ÷ 376.991.

Alternatively, since 376.991 is approximately 377, and we've done 116.713, but perhaps I should not approximate.

Wait another approach, perhaps using exact calculation.

Compute 44000 ÷ 376.991.

I can compute it as follows:

376.991 × 116 = ?

376.991 * 100 = 37,699.1

376.991 *16= 6,031.856

So sum is 37,699.1 +6,031.856 = 43,730.956.

Which is still less than 44,000.

Difference is 44,000 -43,730.956 = 269.044.

So 269.044 ÷376.991 ≈ 0.713.

So total T ≈ 116.713 lb-ft.

Wait, but 116.713 is approximately 117 lb-ft. Looking at the options, option H is 117 lb-ft. So that's in the options.

But wait, I'm getting a T of about 117 lb-ft. Which would be option H.

Wait, but I thought the answer might be around 105. Let me check if I made a mistake in the formula.

Another way to compute it: Let me use the formula P (hp) = T (lb-ft) * ω (rad/s) / 550.

So, T = (P hp * 550) / ( ω (rad/s) )

Wait, but wait, wait, because in the initial setup, I think I might have confused the formula.

Alternatively, another approach: 1 hp = 550 ft-lb per second. So, for 1 hp, torque is 550 lb-ft at 1 rad/s.

But in our case, the drive shaft is rotating at 3600 rev/min, which is 120π rad/s. So, the power is 80 hp, which translates to 80 * 550 ft-lb/s.

So, 80 hp = ( T * 120π ) ft-lb/s.

So, T = (80 * 550) / (120π )

Which is the same as before.

So, T = (44,000) / (376.991) ≈ 116.7 lb-ft.

Looking at the options, option H is 117 lb-ft, which is close.

So the closest option would be H: 117 lb-ft.

But wait, looking at the options, option H is 117, which is the result I got. So the correct answer should be option H.

To compute the torque developed by the engine, we use the relationship between power, torque, and angular velocity:

\[
P = \frac{T \cdot \omega}{550}
\]

Where:
- \( P \) is the power in horsepower (hp),
- \( T \) is the torque in foot-pounds (lb-ft),
- \( \omega \) is the angular velocity in radians per second (rad/s).

### Step 1: Convert the given angular velocity to radians per second
The drive shaft rotates at 3600 revolutions per minute (rev/min). To convert to radians per second:

\[
\omega = 3600 \, \text{rev/min} \times \frac{2\pi \, \text{rad}}{1 \, \text{rev}} \times \frac{1 \, \text{min}}{60 \, \text{s}} = 120\pi \, \text{rad/s}
\]

### Step 2: Rearrange the formula to solve for torque
Rearranging the formula to solve for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{P \cdot 550}{\omega}
\]

### Step 3: Substitute the known values
Given:
- \( P = 80 \, \text{hp} \),
- \( \omega = 120\pi \, \text{rad/s} \).

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[
T = \frac{80 \cdot 550}{120\pi}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
80 \cdot 550 = 44,000
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
120\pi \approx 120 \cdot 3.1416 \approx 376.992
\]

Now, divide:

\[
T \approx \frac{44,000}{376.992} \approx 116.7 \, \text{lb-ft}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated torque is approximately 116.7 lb-ft. The closest option provided is **117 lb-ft** (option H).
