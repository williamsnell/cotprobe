Okay, so I'm trying to figure out during which phase of the cell cycle the DNA in a eukaryotic cell doubles. Hmm, I remember that DNA replication happens a lot in cells, but I need to get the details right.

Wait, DNA replication is an important process. Right, during interphase, DNA is replicated. Interphase is the period when the cell is actively dividing, right? But wait, how much happens in each phase.

So, the phases of the cell cycle go like this: G1, S, G2, M, then if it's mitosis, it goes through anaphase, cytokinesis, and then M again for meiosis. But wait, M is meiosis, not mitosis. Oh, right, M is for mitosis, which is for diploid cells during division.

The question is about when DNA quantity doubles. I think DNA replication happens during the S phase. So, during S phase, the DNA replicates. So each DNA molecule gets copied. So, when DNA doubles, that would be in the S phase, right?

Looking at the options, I need to pick the phase where DNA doubles. Let me go through the options:

A: Telophase – no, that's when the DNA is being removed, and it's the end of the S phase. So after S phase ends, DNA isn't doubled anymore.
B: G_2 – that's part of the interphase, but in G1 and G2, DNA isn't copied yet because it's replication hasn't happened.
C: Prophase – DNA replication hasn't happened here. Prophase is when the chromatin condenses.
D: Interphase – DNA replication is happening here, but the question is about when it doubles, which is during S phase, not interphase as a whole.
E: Metaphase – no, that's a structure, not a phase where DNA is being duplicated.
F: Cytokinesis – that's when the cell divides, removing the cytoplasm and forming new cells. Doesn't involve DNA replication.
G: G_1 – DNA replication hasn't happened yet because the cell is in the G1 phase.
H: Anaphase – that's the phase where sister chromatids separate, but DNA hasn't been doubled yet.
I: S – this is the phase where DNA replicates, so that's the phase when DNA is doubled.
J: M – M stands for mitosis, which is a phase of cell division, not DNA doubling. DNA is replicated during S phase, but M would be after S.

So the correct answer must be I, the S phase.

The DNA in a eukaryotic cell doubles during the S phase of the cell cycle. This is when DNA replication occurs.
