Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about regression analysis, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that a regression is estimated using 27 quarterly observations. The regression equation is y_t = β₁ + β₂x₂ + β₃x_{3t} + u_t. The task is to find the appropriate critical value for a two-sided 5% significance level test of the hypothesis H₀: β₃ = 1.

Hmm, so I remember that in hypothesis testing, especially for regression coefficients, we use t-tests. The critical value depends on the test statistic's distribution. Since we're dealing with a simple hypothesis (β₃ equals a certain value), I think the test statistic here is a t-statistic.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the degrees of freedom. Degrees of freedom is calculated as n - k - 1, where n is the number of observations and k is the number of predictors (including the constant term). But wait, in this case, the model has three variables: x₂, x_{3t}, and the constant β₁. So k is 3. Oh wait, no, wait. The model is y_t = β₁ + β₂x₂ + β₃x_{3t} + u_t. So that's two independent variables plus the intercept, making k=3. So n is 27, so df would be 27 - 3 - 1 = 23.

Wait, but wait again. Oh, wait, sometimes in regression, when testing a specific coefficient, the degrees of freedom is n - 2, because we're dealing with a single coefficient and the intercept. Or is it n - number of parameters? Wait, no, in general, for multiple regression, the degrees of freedom is n - k - 1, assuming we're testing β₀ (the intercept) and all βs. But in this case, the null hypothesis is about β₃, not about the intercept. So perhaps I need to adjust.

Wait, wait. The standard t-test for a single parameter in a multiple regression is similar to testing any other coefficient. So, regardless of which coefficient you're testing, the degrees of freedom is n - (number of parameters). The intercept is one parameter, and each x variable is another. So in this model, we have 3 parameters (intercept, x₂, x_{3t}). So n=27, so df = 27 - 3 = 24.

Wait, but wait again. Because sometimes, when testing a specific coefficient, especially in the context of multiple variables, the degrees of freedom might be n - (number of parameters in the model) - 1. So in this case, number of parameters is 3, so 27 -3 -1 =23.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think. Let's recall: the t-test for a single coefficient is based on the assumption that the other parameters are fixed, and the test statistic follows a t-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to n minus the number of parameters. But wait, no: when testing the significance of a single coefficient, the standard error is calculated by considering all coefficients except the test one as part of the model. So, the degrees of freedom is n - (number of parameters in the model). So if the model has 3 parameters, df is 27 -3 =24.

Wait, but wait, in multiple regression, when testing a single coefficient, the standard error formula includes all the other coefficients. So, the t-statistic is (β_j - β_0)/SE_j, but SE_j involves all other parameters.

So in this case, the degrees of freedom for the t-test would be n - (number of predictors + 1) = 27 - (2 + 1) = 24.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think about the general formula. The t-test for a single coefficient has degrees of freedom equal to n - k, where k is the number of parameters in the model, including the intercept. So here, k is 3: intercept (β₁), x₂ (β₂), x_{3t} (β₃). So df=27-3=24.

Wait, but wait, no, because in the t-test we are estimating the coefficient for x_{3t} (β₃), so the model is y = β₀ + β₁ x₂ + β₂ x_{3t} + u. So including all three parameters.

So the number of parameters is 3. So df is 27 -3 =24.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let's think about the general formula. The t-test for a single coefficient in a multiple regression model has a t-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to n - number of parameters (including intercept). So in this case, the number of parameters is 3 (β₀, β₁, β₂, β₃? Or wait, in the model, it's y = β₀ + β₁ x₂ + β₂ x_{3t} + u_t. So, the intercept is β₀, x₂ is β₁, x_{3t} is β₂, and the constant is β₀. So the model has 3 parameters: β₀, β₁, β₂. Wait, no, that's not right. The model has three parameters: the intercept (β₀), x₂ (β₁), and x_{3t} (β₂). So yes, 3 parameters. So df=27-3=24.

Wait, but wait again. Or is the model y = β₀ + β₁ x₂ + β₂ x_{3t} + u_t, so the parameters are: β₀, β₁, β₂. So three parameters. So df=27-3=24.

So, the t-test for β₃ (which is β₂ in this model, since β₃ is the coefficient of x_{3t}) would have df=24.

So the critical value depends on the t-distribution with 24 degrees of freedom for a two-tailed test at 5% significance.

Wait, what's the critical value for a t-test with 24 df and 5% two-tailed?

I remember that for a 5% two-tailed test, the critical value is the t that leaves 2.5% in each tail. So, using a t-table or calculator.

Looking at the options, let's think about common t values. For df=24, what's the value?

Wait, I know that for df=20, the t critical value for two-tailed 5% is about 2.086, but wait, wait, that's for df=20. Wait, let me think: the t distribution's critical values for different degrees of freedom.

Wait, to find the correct critical value, maybe I should think about the answer options.

The options are:

A: 1.28 → this is z critical for 5% (approx 1.96 for two-tailed z), but in t it's different.

B: 1.88 → perhaps for df=10, but not sure.

C: 1.64 → this is the z value, for example, 90% confidence is 1.645 (for two-tailed), but that's for a large sample.

Wait, but wait, 24 is a fairly large df, so the t-critical value is close to the z critical.

Wait, for a two-tailed 5% test with df=24, the critical value is approximately 2.064. Because I recall that for df=24, the 97.5 percentile is about 2.064, which would be the upper tail value, so the absolute value is 2.064.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. For example, t-distribution tables: at 24 df, 5% two-tailed, the critical value is about 2.064. Yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option E is 2.06.

So the answer should be E: 2.06.

So the critical value is 2.06.

The question involves estimating a regression model with 27 quarterly observations and determining the appropriate critical value for a two-sided 5% significance level test of the hypothesis \( H_0: \beta_3 = 1 \). The model is given by:

\[ y_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_{3t} + u_t \]

The critical value for a t-test is determined by the degrees of freedom (df) and the significance level. Here, the model has three parameters (\( \beta_1 \), \( \beta_2 \), and \( \beta_3 \)), so the degrees of freedom is:

\[ df = n - k = 27 - 3 = 24 \]

The test is for \( \beta_3 \), which corresponds to the coefficient of \( x_{3t} \). For a two-sided 5% significance level, the critical value is the t-value that leaves 2.5% in each tail of the t-distribution with 24 degrees of freedom. From standard t-table values, the critical value for \( df = 24 \) and \( \alpha = 0.05 \) is approximately 2.064.

Among the options provided, the closest value is:

**E: 2.06**
