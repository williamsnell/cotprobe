Okay, so I've got this problem here about ice cream calories and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that there are 230 calories in 4 ounces of ice cream. I need to find out how many calories are in 6 ounces of that same ice cream. The options are A to J, with various numbers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on unit conversions, but I think I remember that if the rate is constant, I can use proportions or something.

Wait, right, so the calories are directly proportional to the ounces. So if 4 ounces is 230 calories, then 6 ounces would be more. So the ratio would be 6 divided by 4, or 3/2. So I should multiply 230 by 3/2. Let me calculate that. 230 times 3 is 690, divided by 2 is 345. Oh, so that would be 345 calories for 6 ounces. Looking at the options, option H is 345. So H must be the right answer.

Wait, another way to think about it: 4 ounces is 230, so 1 ounce is 230/4, which is 57.5 calories per ounce. Then 6 ounces would be 57.5 * 6. Let me compute that. 57.5 * 6: 50*6=300, 7.5*6=45, so total 345. Yep, same answer. So H is definitely correct.

The problem involves finding the calories in 6 ounces of ice cream when 4 ounces contain 230 calories. Since the calorie content is directly proportional to the weight, we can set up a proportion: 4 oz : 230 cal = 6 oz : x cal. Solving for x gives x = (230 Ã— 6) / 4 = 345 calories. Thus, the answer is **H: 345**.

Answer: H
