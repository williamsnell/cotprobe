Okay, so I've got this question about average fixed costs. Hmm, I remember that fixed costs are expenses that don't change with the level of production, like rent or salaries. But wait, no, not exactly. Fixed costs are costs that remain the same regardless of how much you produce. So if a company produces more, fixed costs per unit might decrease because the total fixed cost is spread over more units.

The question says the shoe manufacturer has an average fixed cost of $0.50 per shoe at an output of 10,000 shoes. Then they expand production to 12,500 shoes. The question is asking what the new average fixed cost would be.

Wait, but average fixed cost is total fixed cost divided by the number of units produced. So if the average fixed cost goes down when you produce more, that's because the total fixed cost hasn't changed. For example, if you have $1000 in fixed costs, and you produce 10,000 shoes, the average is $0.10 per shoe. If you increase production to 12,500, the total fixed cost is still $1000, so the average becomes $1000 /12500 = $0.08. But wait, in the example given, the average went from $0.50 to a lower value when production increased. So the actual question must be considering that fixed costs are unchanged but perhaps there are changes in the fixed costs themselves. Oh, but the question says he ex-panded production, so I think the total fixed costs have not changed. But wait, wait, the question says "average fixed cost of $0.50 per shoe at an output of 10,000 shoes." So fixed cost per unit is 0.50 when output is 10,000. So FC = 0.50 * 10,000 = $5000.

If he increases production to 12,500, the total fixed cost is still $5000. So the new average fixed cost (AFC) would be FC / Q = 5000 /12500 = $0.40.

Looking at the options, choice D is $0.40. So the correct answer should be D.

The average fixed cost (AFC) is calculated as total fixed cost (FC) divided by the quantity produced (Q). Initially, FC is $0.50 per shoe at 10,000 shoes, so FC = 0.50 * 10,000 = $5,000. When production expands to 12,500 shoes, FC remains $5,000. Thus, the new AFC is 5,000 / 12,500 = $0.40.

Answer: D
