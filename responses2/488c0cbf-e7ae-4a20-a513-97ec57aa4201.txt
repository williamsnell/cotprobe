Okay, so I've got this question here about Mr. Torres and his stock, and I need to figure out how much he made from it for the year. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question says he owns 350 shares of Krescostock. Each share has a quarterly dividend of $1.20. Then there's an extra year-end dividend of $0.30 per share. I need to calculate his total income from the stock for the entire year.

Hmm, so I should probably break this down into two parts: the regular quarterly dividends and the extra dividend he got at the end of the year.

Let me start with the quarterly dividends. Each quarter, he gets $1.20 per share. Since the dividends are paid quarterly, that means four times a year. But wait, the question says there's an extra dividend at the end of the year, so maybe the extra is a one-time payment, not compounded. So, perhaps the $0.30 is added once at the end of the year.

So, first, calculate the total dividends from the regular quarterly payments. He has 350 shares, and each share gets $1.20 every three months.

So, per share, the quarterly dividend is $1.20. For 350 shares, that's 350 multiplied by 1.20.

Let me calculate that. 350 * 1.20. Let's see, 350 * 1 is 350, and 350 * 0.20 is 70. So, 350 +70 = $420 per quarter.

Wait, but that's just for one quarter. But since it's a year, there are four quarters. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I confused something. Because each quarter, he gets the dividend. So each quarter's dividend is 350 * 1.20, which is 420. So for four quarters, that's 420 * 4 = $1,680. But wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because each quarter is a payment. So the $420 is per quarter. So a year is 4 quarters, so 4 * 420 = $1,680. But wait, that can't be right because that would be the total for the year if he got $1.20 per share each quarter. But wait, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Wait, no, wait. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question states he receives a quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share. So for each share, he gets $1.20 every three months. So over a year, each share would accumulate four dividends, right? So 350 * $1.20 per share * 4 quarters. Wait, that's not correct because that would be counting each quarter as a separate payment. Wait no, that would be overcomplicating. Actually, the total annual dividend per share is 4 * $1.20 = $4.80, so 350 * 4.80.

Wait, maybe that's better. Let me calculate that. 350 times 4.80. Let me break it down. 350 * 4 is 1400, and 350 * 0.80 is 280. So 1400 + 280 = $1,680. So that's the total from the regular quarterly payments for the year.

Then, there's the extra dividend at the end of the year, which is $0.30 per share. So for 350 shares, that would be 350 * 0.30 = $105.

So the total income from the stock is the sum of the two parts. That would be $1,680 (from quarterly) plus $105 (from extra) = $1,785.

Looking at the options, option H is $1,785. So that's the answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, another way to approach it: Each quarter, he gets 350 * 1.20 = 420. So four quarters would be 420 * 4 = 1680. Plus the extra 350 * 0.30 = 105. So 1680 + 105 = 1785. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be H: $1,785.

The correct answer is H: $1,785.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Quarterly Dividend Calculation**: Mr. Torres receives $1.20 per share each quarter. For 350 shares, this is 350 * $1.20 = $420 per quarter. Over four quarters, this becomes 4 * $420 = $1,680.

2. **Extra Year-End Dividend**: An additional $0.30 per share is received at the end of the year. For 350 shares, this is 350 * $0.30 = $105.

3. **Total Dividend**: Summing both parts, $1,680 + $105 = $1,785.

Thus, the total income from the stock for the year is $1,785.
