Okay, so I have this bond valuation question here. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about finding the fair market value of a 15-year bond that pays $25 every six months, with a face value of $1000. The current market interest rate is 4%. 

Hmm, I remember that bond valuation involves calculating the present value of the bond's future cash flows, which includes the periodic interest payments and the return of the principal at maturity. Since this bond pays every six months, I think I need to calculate the present value for each six-month period and then sum them up, plus the present value of the principal.

Wait, so the bond is paying $25 every six months. Over 15 years, there are 15 * 2 = 30 payment periods. The market interest rate is 4%, but since the payments are semi-annual, I should adjust the rate accordingly. The semi-annual rate would be 4% / 2 = 2%, right?

So each six-month period, the cash flow is $25. I need to discount these cash flows and the final principal back to present value. The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity (since payments are made at the end of each period) is PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r. But wait, since the payments are every six months, the number of periods is 30, and the rate per period is 2%.

Let me plug in the numbers. PMT is $25, r is 0.02, n is 30.

So the present value of the coupon payments would be 25 * [1 - (1.02)^-30]/0.02. Let me compute this term.

First, I'll calculate (1.02)^-30. Let me compute 1.02^-30. Hmm, I think that's approximately 0.5828. So 1 - 0.5828 = 0.4172. Then, 0.4172 / 0.02 = 20.86. So 25 * 20.86 is about 521.5.

Wait, but wait, 0.4172 / 0.02 is 20.86? Let me double-check. 0.02 * 20.86 = 0.4172. Yes that's correct.

So the present value of the coupon payments is about $521.5. Now, the principal is $1000, and that's paid back at the end of 30 periods. So the present value of the principal is 1000 / (1.02)^30. Which is 1000 / 1.02^30.

What's 1.02^30? Let me think, I remember that 1.02^10 is approximately 1.219, so 1.02^30 is (1.02^10)^3 ≈ (1.219)^3. Let me compute that: 1.219^3. 1.219 *1.219 is approx 1.485, then multiplied by 1.219 again: 1.485 * 1.219 ≈ 1.813. So 1.02^30 is roughly 1.8167. So 1000 / 1.8167 ≈ 550.56. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate 1.02^30 with a calculator approach.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute 1.02^30 using logarithms or exponential functions, but perhaps it's easier to just compute 1/(1.02^30). Let me think step by step. Alternatively, using the rule of 72, but that's not helpful here. Alternatively, accepting that it's approximately 0.81699. Because 1.02^30 is about 1.8167, so 1/1.8167 is about 0.5506.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 1.02^30.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest:

(1 + r)^n = (1 + 0.02)^30.

Let me compute 1.02^30:

I think 1.02^10 ≈ 1.21899.

Then 1.21899^3 is (1.21899)^2 * 1.21899.

(1.21899)^2 is approx 1.486.

1.486 * 1.21899 ≈ 1.8167. So yes, 1.02^30 is approximately 1.8167.

So 1000 / 1.8167 ≈ 550.56. So the present value of the principal is approximately $550.56.

Wait, but earlier I thought the coupon payments present value was about $521.5. So the total present value of the bond is 521.5 + 550.56 = approximately $1072.06.

Wait, but the options don't include that number. The options are A: 975, B:1250, C:1150, D:1050, E:1085.65, F:1000, G:1111.97, H:950, I:1200, J:900.

Hmm, E is 1085.65, which is close to my approx 1072. Hmm, perhaps my initial calculations were a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-examine the calculation.

Wait, the present value of the coupon payments is 25 * [1 - (1.02)^-30 ] / 0.02. Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute (1.02)^-30: which is 1/(1.02^30) ≈ 1/1.81669678 ≈ 0.550633.

So, 1 - 0.550633 = 0.449367.

0.449367 / 0.02 = 22.46835.

Multiply by 25: 25 * 22.46835 = 561.70875.

So the present value of the coupons is approximately $561.71.

Now, the present value of the principal is 1000 / 1.81669678 ≈ 550.56.

Adding both: 561.71 + 550.56 ≈ 1112.27. Wait, that's around $1,112.27, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps my approximation for 1.02^30 was a bit off. Let me think again.

Wait, 1.02^10 is approximately 1.218994.

Then 1.02^30 = (1.02^10)^3 = (1.218994)^3.

Let me compute that:

1.218994 * 1.218994 = approximately 1.485.

Then, 1.485 * 1.218994 ≈ 1.485 * 1.218994.

Calculating 1.485 * 1.218994:

1 * 1.218994 = 1.218994.

0.485 * 1.218994 ≈ 0.485 *1.2 = 0.582, and 0.485 *0.018994≈0.00918.

So 0.582 + 0.00918 = 0.59118.

So total is 1.218994 + 0.59118 ≈ 1.810174.

Wait, so 1.02^30 is approximately 1.810174.

So 1000 / 1.810174 ≈ 552.30. So the principal's present value is approximately $552.30.

Now, the coupon present value: 25 * [1 - (1.02)^-30 ] / 0.02.

Wait, (1.02)^-30 is 1/(1.810174) ≈ 0.5523.

So 1 - 0.5523 = 0.4477.

0.4477 / 0.02 = 22.385.

Multiply by 25: 25 * 22.385 = 559.625.

So the coupon PV is $559.63, and principal is $552.30.

Adding them: 559.63 + 552.30 = 1,111.93.

Wait, so approximately $1,111.93. Looking at the options, option G is 1111.97. That's very close. But wait, did I compute accurately?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more precisely. Let me recalculate.

First, exact calculation of (1.02)^30:

Using the formula (1 + r)^n, where r=0.02, n=30.

I can use the formula for compound interest, but perhaps I should accept that (1.02)^30 is approximately 1.81669678. So, 1/1.81669678 is 0.550633.

So, the present value of the coupon is 25 * (1 - 0.550633) / 0.02.

Which is 25 * (0.449367) / 0.02.

0.449367 / 0.02 is 22.46835.

25 * 22.46835 = 561.70875.

The principal's present value is 1000 / 1.81669678 = 550.5633.

Adding them together: 561.70875 + 550.5633 = 1,112.272.

So approximately $1,112.27.

The closest option to this is option G: 1111.97, which is $1,111.97. That's very close. So the fair market value is approximately $1,112.27.

Wait, but looking at the options, they have 1111.97 as option G. So that's the choice.

To determine the fair market value of the bond, we calculate the present value of the bond's future cash flows, which include the semi-annual coupon payments and the return of the principal. The bond pays $25 every six months for 15 years, and the market interest rate is 4% annually, adjusted to 2% semi-annually. The face value of the bond is $1,000.

### Step 1: Calculate the present value of the coupon payments
The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:
\[
PV = PMT \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}
\]
Where:
- \(PMT = 25\) (annual coupon payment, adjusted to semi-annual as $25/2 = $12.50)
- \(r = 0.02\) (semi-annual interest rate)
- \(n = 30\) (number of periods)

\[
PV_{\text{coupons}} = 12.50 \times \frac{1 - (1.02)^{-30}}{0.02}
\]

First, calculate \((1.02)^{-30}\):
\[
(1.02)^{-30} \approx 0.550633
\]
Then:
\[
1 - 0.550633 = 0.449367
\]
\[
\frac{0.449367}{0.02} = 22.46835
\]
\[
PV_{\text{coupons}} = 12.50 \times 22.46835 = 280.8544
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the present value of the principal
The present value of the principal is calculated as:
\[
PV_{\text{principal}} = \frac{1000}{(1.02)^{30}}
\]
Using \((1.02)^{30} \approx 1.816697\):
\[
PV_{\text{principal}} = \frac{1000}{1.816697} \approx 550.5633
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total present value
\[
PV_{\text{total}} = PV_{\text{coupons}} + PV_{\text{principal}} = 280.8544 + 550.5633 \approx 831.4177
\]

Wait, this doesn't match the earlier approximation. There's a discrepancy here. Let me recheck the calculations.

Upon re-evaluation, the correct approach is to use the correct present value formula. The correct calculation for the coupon payments should be:
\[
PV_{\text{coupons}} = 25 \times \frac{1 - (1.02)^{-30}}{0.02}
\]
Where \(PMT = 25\), \(r = 0.02\), and \(n = 30\). 

\[
PV_{\text{coupons}} = 25 \times \frac{1 - (1.02)^{-30}}{0.02}
\]
Calculate \((1.02)^{-30}\):
\[
(1.02)^{-30} \approx 0.550633
\]
So:
\[
1 - 0.550633 = 0.449367
\]
\[
\frac{0.449367}{0.02} = 22.46835
\]
\[
PV_{\text{coupons}} = 25 \times 22.46835 = 561.70875
\]

The principal's present value:
\[
PV_{\text{principal}} = \frac{1000}{(1.02)^{30}} \approx 550.56
\]

Total present value:
\[
PV_{\text{total}} = 561.70875 + 550.56 \approx 1,112.27
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
The closest option to the calculated fair market value of approximately $1,112.27 is **G: 1111.97**.
