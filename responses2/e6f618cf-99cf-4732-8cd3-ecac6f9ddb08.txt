Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: If f(2x) = x + 5 and f(g(6)) = 13, then 2 * g(6) = ?

The options are A to J, with various numbers. Hmm, I think I need to find what 2*g(6) is. Let me break this down.

First, let's look at the first equation: f(2x) = x + 5. I need to find an expression for f in terms of its input. So, if I let u = 2x, then x would be u/2. Substituting that into the equation, f(u) = (u/2) + 5. So, f(y) = (y/2) + 5 where y is the input to the function f.

Wait, that's helpful. So, f is a function that takes a number, divides it by 2, and adds 5. So f(y) = (y/2) + 5.

Now, the second part of the problem is f(g(6)) = 13. Let me substitute g(6) into f. Since f(y) = y/2 +5, f(g(6)) = g(6)/2 +5. And that equals 13.

So, I can set up the equation:

g(6)/2 +5 = 13.

I can solve for g(6). Let's subtract 5 from both sides:

g(6)/2 = 13 -5 = 8.

Then multiply both sides by 2:

g(6) = 16.

Wait, but the question is asking for 2 * g(6). Oh, right! So 2 multiplied by g(6) is 2 * 16 =32.

Looking at the options, B is 32. So the answer should be B.

The problem involves finding the value of \( 2 \cdot g(6) \) given the functions \( f(2x) = x + 5 \) and \( f(g(6)) = 13 \).

**Step 1:** Express \( f \) in terms of its input.
Let \( u = 2x \). Then \( x = \frac{u}{2} \), so:
\[
f(u) = \frac{u}{2} + 5
\]
Thus, for any input \( y \), \( f(y) = \frac{y}{2} + 5 \).

**Step 2:** Substitute \( g(6) \) into \( f \).
Given \( f(g(6)) = 13 \), substitute:
\[
\frac{g(6)}{2} + 5 = 13
\]

**Step 3:** Solve for \( g(6) \).
Subtract 5:
\[
\frac{g(6)}{2} = 8
\]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
g(6) = 16
\]

**Step 4:** Multiply \( g(6) \) by 2.
\[
2 \cdot g(6) = 2 \cdot 16 = 32
\]

**Answer:** B: 32
