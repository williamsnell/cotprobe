Question:

Which one of the following criticisms of the Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger approach to dealing with cointegrated variables is overcome by the Engle-Yoo (EY) procedure?

Options:

A: In the context of small samples, Dickey Fuller tests are prone to conclude that there is a unit root in a series when there is not
B: The Engle-Granger (EG) approach can only detect up to one cointegrating relationship even though there could be more than one
C: The variables are treated asymmetrically in the cointegrating tests
D: It is not possible to perform tests about the cointegrating relationship

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about econometric methods, specifically related to cointegration and unit roots. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about the criticism of the Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger approach and how the Engle-Yoo procedure addresses it. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I need to remember what each method does. The Dickey-Fuller and Engle-Granger methods are used to test for cointegration. Cointegration refers to a long-term equilibrium relationship between non-stationary time series variables. If two variables are cointegrated, their linear combination is stationary, which is important for many economic models.

The Dickey-Fuller test is used to detect unit roots in individual series, but when dealing with cointegrated variables, Engle-Granger (EG) uses a two-step approach. In the first step, they estimate the long-run relationship and then apply the Dickey-Fuller test on the residuals. If the residuals are stationary, it suggests cointegration.

Now, the question is about a criticism of the Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger approach and what the Engle-Yoo (EY) procedure does to overcome it.

I remember that one of the main criticisms of the Engle-Granger two-step approach is that it can have issues when there are multiple cointegrating relationships. The EG method is typically used for one cointegrating equation, but if there are more than one, it might miss some. So option B says that EG can only detect up to one cointegrating relationship even though there could be more. That sounds familiar. I think that's a common criticism, because if there are multiple cointegrating vectors, the EG approach with a single cointegrating equation would fail to capture all of them.

So the EY test is supposed to address this, I believe. The EY approach allows for the possibility of multiple cointegrating relationships. It does this by relaxing some of the assumptions, maybe by allowing for different cointegrating vectors in each step. So the EY method can detect more than one cointegrating equation.

Looking at the options again:

A: Small samples. Dickey-Fuller tests are often oversized in small samples. The EY approach might handle this better because it doesn't rely on the same assumptions for unit root testing as the Dickey-Fuller. So A might be a correct criticism of the Dickey-Fuller approach.

B: This is about multiple cointegrating relationships. The criticism is that EG can only detect one. So the EY addresses that.

C: Variables are treated asymmetrically. I don't think EY does that. It's more about testing multiple relationships.

D: It is not possible to perform tests about the cointegrating relationship. That doesn't sound right. The EY procedure should allow for testing of cointegrating relationships.

So the question is, which criticism is overcome by EY? The EY procedure probably addresses the multiple cointegrating equation issue, which is option B.

Wait, but what about option C? I think the EY test is asymmetric because it can handle cases where the number of cointegrating vectors is more than one. Or does it allow for a more flexible testing approach?

Wait, no. The EY test is designed to detect multiple cointegrating vectors. It does this by allowing for different lag lengths and testing for the presence of additional cointegrating equations. So the EY approach isn't treating variables asymmetrically in the cointegrating tests. So option C isn't correct.

So the correct answer is B: the criticism of the Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger approach that can only detect up to one cointegrating relationship even though there could be more than one is overcome by the EY procedure.

The question asks which criticism of the Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger (EG) approach is overcome by the Engle-Yoo (EY) procedure. The EG method is traditionally used to test for cointegration, focusing on a single cointegrating relationship. However, it has a significant limitation: it can only detect up to one cointegrating relationship, even though there might be more. This limitation is a well-known criticism of the EG approach.

The EY procedure addresses this issue by allowing for the detection of multiple cointegrating relationships. It does this by relaxing some assumptions, enabling the testing of several cointegrating vectors. This makes the EY approach more versatile and capable of handling complex cointegration scenarios.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: While the EY procedure may handle small samples better due to its different assumptions, this is not a criticism of the EG approach itself.
- **B**: Correct. The EY procedure overcomes the criticism that the EG method can only detect one cointegrating relationship.
- **C**: Incorrect. The EY procedure does not treat variables asymmetrically; it tests for multiple cointegrating vectors.
- **D**: Incorrect. The EY procedure does allow for testing cointegrating relationships.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.
