Question:

A psychologist believes that positive rewards for proper behavior are more effective than punishment for bad behavior in promoting good behavior in children. A scale of "proper behavior" is developed. μ1= the "proper behavior" rating for children receiving positive rewards, and μ2= the "proper behavior" rating for children receiving punishment. If H0: μ1− μ2= 0, which of the following is the proper statement of HA?

Options:

A: HA: μ1− μ2≤ 0
B: Any of the above is an acceptable alternative to the given null.
C: HA: μ2− μ1> 0
D: HA: μ1= μ2
E: HA: μ2− μ1< 0
F: HA: μ1− μ2≠ 0
G: HA: μ1− μ2< 0
H: HA: μ1− μ2= 1
I: HA: μ1− μ2> 0
J: HA: μ1− μ2≥ 0

Okay, so I have this psychology question here about hypothesis testing. Let's try to break it down. The question is about comparing two groups: one that gets positive rewards for proper behavior and another that gets punishment for bad behavior. The psychologist is claiming that positive rewards are more effective than punishment in promoting good behavior in children.

The null hypothesis, H0, is that the difference in their "proper behavior" ratings is zero. So H0: μ1 - μ2 = 0. That means there's no difference between the two groups.

Now, the alternative hypothesis, HA, is what we're trying to find. The options are given from A to J. I need to figure out which option correctly represents the alternative hypothesis.

The alternative hypothesis should reflect the psychologist's belief. The psychologist thinks that positive rewards (μ1) are better than punishment (μ2). So, for μ1 and μ2, μ1 is greater than μ2. So, HA would state that μ1 - μ2 is greater than 0. Let me look at the options.

Option A: HA: μ1− μ2 ≤ 0. That's saying μ1 is not more than μ2, which is the opposite of what we want. So that's probably not the alternative.

Option B: Any of the above is acceptable. Hmm, maybe, but I think only one is correct.

Option C: HA: μ2− μ1> 0. Wait, that's the opposite of what we want. Because μ1 is larger than μ2, so μ2 - μ1 would be negative. So HA in this case would state μ2 is better than μ1, which is the opposite of the alternative.

Option D: HA: μ1= μ2. That's the null, not the alternative.

Option E: HA: μ2− μ1< 0. That would mean μ2 is less than μ1, which is the opposite of our alternative. So that's not it.

Option F: HA: μ1− μ2≠ 0. This is a two-tailed test, meaning it allows for both μ1 being greater or less than μ2. But the question is about promoting good behavior. Since the psychologist thinks that positive rewards (μ1) are better, the alternative should specifically say μ1 is greater than μ2, not just any difference.

Option G: HA: μ1− μ2< 0. Again, that's the opposite of μ1 being greater. So not correct.

Option H: HA: μ1− μ2= 1. This is a specific value, but in hypothesis testing, we usually deal with differences in means, not fixed values. So not sure if this is correct or not. It's possible, but maybe not the standard approach.

Option I: HA: μ1− μ2> 0. This aligns with the idea that μ1 is higher. That's exactly what we want for the alternative hypothesis.

Option J: HA: μ1− μ2≥ 0. This allows for μ1 being equal to or higher than μ2. It's a one-tailed test, but the null is also about equality, so this might be acceptable if we're considering only one-directional. But the question says the alternative is "a more effective than punishment", which implies a one-tailed test.

Wait, but the null and alternative are both about the difference. The alternative is just stating the direction, so it could be either one-tailed or two-tailed. But the question doesn't specify one-tailed or two-tailed. So, considering the options, I think option I is correct, but I need to make sure.

Wait, the question says "the correct statement of HA" given that H0 is μ1 - μ2 = 0. The alternative would be that μ1 - μ2 is greater than 0. So, HA should state μ1 > μ2. Which is option I.

Wait, looking at the options, option I is HA: μ1− μ2> 0. Yes, that's exactly what we want.

Option F is μ1 - μ2 ≠ 0, which is a two-tailed test, but the alternative hypothesis should be directional, so F is a possible alternative but it's not one-tailed. So if the question is about a one-tailed test, I. But the question doesn't specify that, so perhaps option F is acceptable as well. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about promoting good behavior. The alternative hypothesis should posit that μ1 is actually higher than μ2, so the alternative should be μ1 > μ2. Thus, the correct option is I.
</think>

The null hypothesis states that there is no difference between μ1 and μ2, i.e., μ1 - μ2 = 0. The alternative hypothesis should reflect the idea that positive rewards (μ1) are more effective than punishment (μ2), implying μ1 > μ2. 

Analyzing the options, option I (HA: μ1− μ2> 0) correctly represents the directional alternative hypothesis.
