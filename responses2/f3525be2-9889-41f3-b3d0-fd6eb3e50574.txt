Okay, so I've got this question here about probability and expectation, right? Let me try to work through it step by step. The question says that w is the number of heads when two coins are tossed, and I need to find the expectation of w, which is denoted as ⟨w⟩. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, let's start by recalling what expectation means. From what I remember, expectation is like the average outcome you'd expect if you did an experiment many times. So for example, if you toss a coin multiple times, the expectation would be the average number of heads you'd get.

In this case, we're dealing with two coins. I think I should list out all the possible outcomes and then calculate the expectation based on their probabilities.

When you toss two coins, each coin can land on either heads (H) or tails (T). So the possible outcomes are: HH, HT, TH, TT. That’s four possible outcomes, each equally likely because each coin toss is independent and fair.

Wait, so each outcome has a probability of 1/4, right? Because there are two coins, each with two possibilities, so 2^2 =4 total outcomes, each equally probable.

Now, for each outcome, I need to find the number of heads. Let's see:

- HH: two heads → w=2
- HT: one head → w=1
- TH: one head → w=1
- TT: zero heads → w=0

So, the possible values of w are 0, 1, 2. Now, I need to calculate the expectation, which is the sum of each value multiplied by its probability.

Mathematically, the expectation ⟨w⟩ = sum over all possible values (k * P(w=k)).

So let's compute each term:

For w=0: 0 * P(w=0) = 0 * (1/4) = 0
For w=1: 1 * (number of outcomes with one head) / total outcomes. There are two such outcomes (HT and TH), so 2/4 = 1/2. So 1 * 1/2 = 1/2.
For w=2: 2 * (number of outcomes with two heads) / total outcomes. There's only one outcome (HH), so 1/4. So 2 * 1/4 = 1/2.

Now, adding these up: 0 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the expectation is 1.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me think again. Another way to compute expectation is using the formula E[w] = Σ [k * P(k)], which I did. So that's correct.

I remember that for two independent events, like flipping two coins, the expectation of the sum is the sum of the expectations. Since each coin has an expectation of 0.5 (because the expectation for a single coin is 0.5 heads), adding two of them gives 1. So that matches my earlier result.

Alternatively, I could compute it using the formula for expectation for a binomial distribution, which applies here since each trial (coin toss) is independent and has the same probability.

The formula for a binomial distribution is E[X] = n * p, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success (heads in a single trial).

Here, n=2, p=0.5. So E[w] = 2 * 0.5 = 1. Yep, that's the same answer.

So both methods confirm that the expectation is 1, which is option B.

The expectation of w, denoted ⟨w⟩, is calculated by considering all possible outcomes of tossing two coins and their respective probabilities. Each outcome (HH, HT, TH, TT) has a probability of 1/4. The number of heads (w) is 2 for HH, 1 for HT and TH, and 0 for TT. Using the formula for expectation:

⟨w⟩ = (0 * 1/4) + (1 * 2/4) + (2 * 1/4) = 0 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.

Thus, the correct answer is 1.

Answer: B
