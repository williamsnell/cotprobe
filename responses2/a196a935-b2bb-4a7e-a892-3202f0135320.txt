Alright, let me try to figure out this markup percentage problem. Okay, so the question is about calculating the markup percentage based on the cost and the selling price. The radio sells for $89.95, and the store buys each for $65.05. I need to find both the markup percentage based on cost and based on selling price.

First, I should remember what markup means. Markup is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. So, the markup amount would be the difference between the selling price and the cost. Let me calculate that.

Selling price is $89.95. Cost is $65.05. So, subtracting these: 89.95 - 65.05 equals 24.90. So, the markup is $24.90. 

Now, I need to find the markup percentages based on each of these. Let me start with the markup based on cost. The formula for markup based on cost is (Markup / Cost) * 100%. 

So, that's 24.90 divided by 65.05. Let me compute that. Hmm, 24.90 divided by 65.05. Let me think, 65 times 0.38 is about 24.7, which is close to 24.9. Let me do a more accurate calculation.

65.05 times 0.38 would be 65 * 0.38 = 24.7, plus 0.05 * 0.38 = 0.019. So, total is approximately 24.719. That's a bit more than 24.9. Wait, maybe I should set it up as a division.

Alternatively, maybe using a calculator approach. Let's compute 24.90 / 65.05. Let's see, 65.05 goes into 24.90 how many times? 65.05 is larger than 24.90, so it's less than 1. Let's compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach: 24.90 ÷ 65.05 = approx 0.383. Multiply by 100% to get the percentage: 38.3%. Looking at the options, option G is 36.50%, and option D is 40.00%. Hmm, 38.3 is closer to 38.28%, which is option A. Wait, no—wait, option A is 38.28% and 27.68%. Hmm, but I thought the markup is 24.90, so 24.90 / 65.05 is about 38.3%, which is roughly 38.3%. Looking at the options, option A's first number is 38.28%, which is very close. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, 65.05 multiplied by 0.38 is 24.719, which is 24.719, but the markup is 24.90. So 0.38 is 24.719, and we need 24.90, which is 0.181 more. So, 24.719 is 0.38, and 24.90 is 0.38 plus an additional amount. Let me set up the equation: 24.90 = 65.05 * x. Solving for x, x = 24.90 / 65.05 ≈ 0.383, which is 38.3%, so approximately 38.3%, which is about 38.3%, so the first part is 38.3%. The options give A as 38.28% and D as 40.00%. Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is 38.28% and 27.68%. But I thought the markup is 24.90 on a cost of 65.05, so 24.90/65.05 = 0.383, which is 38.3%. So the first option is 38.28%, which is close. 

Now, the second part is the markup based on the selling price. The formula here is (Markup / Selling Price) * 100%. So, 24.90 divided by 89.95. Let me compute that. 

So, 24.90 ÷ 89.95. Let me compute this. Well, 89.95 multiplied by 0.2768 (from the options) would be approximately 89.95 * 0.2768. Let me compute that. 89.95 * 0.2768. Let's break it down: 89.95 * 0.2 is 17.99, 0.07 is 6.2965, 0.006 is 0.5397, and 0.0008 is 0.07196. Adding all together: 17.99 +6.2965 = 24.2865, plus 0.5397 is 24.8262, plus 0.07196 is 24.89816. So 0.2768 would give approximately 24.898, which is very close to 24.90. So, that means 24.90 is about 0.2768, so 27.68% when multiplied by 100%. So, the markup based on selling price is 27.68%. 

Looking at the options, option A is 38.28% and 27.68%. So that's the correct pair. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the markup is computed as (Selling Price - Cost) / Selling Price * 100%. So, (89.95 - 65.05) is 24.90. So, 24.90 divided by 89.95 is indeed 0.2768, which is 27.68%. So, yes, that's correct. 

So, based on cost, it's 38.3%, which we approximate to 38.28% in option A, and based on selling price, 27.68%. So the correct answer is option A.
</think>

The markup based on cost is calculated by dividing the markup amount by the cost: (24.90 / 65.05) ≈ 0.383 or 38.3%. Based on the selling price, it's 24.90 / 89.95 ≈ 0.2768 or 27.68%. The closest option is A: 38.28%, 27.68%.
