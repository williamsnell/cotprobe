The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A city enacted an ordinance prohibiting the singing and chanting of songs from 1:00P. M. to 1:00A. M. by two or more persons if such noise is audible off the premises where the singing takes place. The ordinance expressly exempted from its purview the singing or chanting of religious songs. After the ordinance was enacted and went into effect, several college students were walking down the street on their way to a victory celebration following a big college football game. They began loudly chanting, "We're number 1. . . we're number 1. " One of the residents who lived on the street was greatly disturbed by the noise and reported the incident to the police, who were immediately summoned to the scene. The students who engaged in the chanting were arrested and charged with violating the ordinance. The students who were prosecuted now bring suit challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance. Which of the following would constitute their WEAKEST argument against enforcement of the city ordinance?

Options:

A: The ordinance deprives persons of their liberty without due process of law because the ordinance is not related to any legitimate community interest.
B: The ordinance is unjust as it discriminates against those who are not religious.
C: The ordinance is not fair because it only applies to two or more persons, thus single individuals can create noise without consequence.
D: The ordinance deprives the persons of the equal protection of the laws by impermissibly distinguishing between religiously inspired singing and all forms of singing.
E: The ordinance directly contradicts the students' right to celebrate their college's victory.
F: The ordinance deprives persons of their freedom of expression, in violation of the First andFourteenth Amendments.
G: The ordinance is biased against persons who can't sing or chant religious songs.
H: The ordinance is invalid as it fails to consider the cultural importance of chanting and singing in a group.
I: The ordinance is not applicable because it was after a football game, a special occasion.
J: The statutory language of the ordinance is vague and overbroad since it attempts to encompass all forms of singing.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let's read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.

The city enacted an ordinance that prohibits two or more people from singing or chanting songs from 1:00 P.M. to 1:00 A.M. if such noise is audible off the premises. It specifically exempted religious songs. Then, some college students were walking to a victory celebration and started chanting a song about being number one. The police were called, and the students were arrested. Now, the students are suing the city to show the ordinance is unconstitutional.

The question is asking which argument would be the weakest against the enforcement of the city ordinance. The options are A to H, and the correct answer is one of them.

Hmm. So, I need to think about the legal principles involved here. The main issue here is whether the ordinance is constitutional. It's about whether the law is being applied improperly.

I remember that the First Amendment's right to freedom of speech is a key point. The ordinance prohibits chanting of certain songs, but it doesn't specify what constitutes a speech. The Supreme Court has dealt with cases where laws prohibit certain types of speech without a clear constitutional basis.

Looking at the options, I think option C is about the ordinance applying only to two or more people. It says that single individuals can create noise without consequence. But wait, the law prohibits two or more people from doing it, but does that apply to individuals individually? Or is it that the maximum number is two, so one person can sing or chant alone without any problem.

Wait, no. The wording is "by two or more persons." So, if a single person is singing or chanting, they're not part of a group of two or more. So, does that mean the law doesn't apply to single individuals? Because the requirement is for two or more. If someone is singing alone, they're not part of a group that's being restricted. So, the law doesn't impose any restrictions on individuals; it's only limiting groups of two or more.

Wait, that's an important point. So, if the ordinance was about groups, then individuals aren't restricted. But the way it's phrased is that two or more can't do it. So, a single person can do it without any issue. Therefore, the students' argument that single individuals can create noise without consequence would be based on this.

Wait, but the students' case is about the ordinance being illegal because it's only allowing two or more to do it. So, if the law doesn't apply to individuals, then the students' argument that the law doesn't protect them is incorrect. But the question is about the students' weakest argument against enforcement. So, perhaps the students are arguing that the law is too restrictive because it's only allowing two or more to sing, thus preventing anyone from being able to do it. So, if the law doesn't apply to single individuals, then the students' argument is correct, and their strongest argument would be that the law is too broad, but the question is about the weakest.

Wait, but the question is asking which argument would be the weakest against enforcement. So, the students are trying to show that the ordinance is unconstitutional. So, the argument that the law is too restrictive is a valid point. But which argument is the weakest? Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the law is not based on a legitimate community interest.

Looking at the options, option A says the ordinance deprives people of their liberty without due process because it's not related to any legitimate community interest. That seems a strong argument. If the law is not about a legitimate interest, then it's unconstitutional. But the issue here is about whether the law is overbroad. For example, if the law prohibits two or more people from singing, but allows one person, then the law is not overbroad. But if the law prohibits any number of people (meaning it's a requirement that can be met by any number), then it's overbroad.

Wait, the wording is "by two or more persons", meaning that two or more are prohibited. So, if a single person is allowed to sing alone, that's not a restriction. So, the law doesn't prevent individuals from using the singing or chanting. Therefore, the ordinance is not overbroad because it doesn't restrict individuals. So, the issue isn't about overbroadness but about whether the law is applied improperly to groups.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The law says "by two or more persons". So, it's not a requirement that two or more must use it. It's a prohibition that two or more can use it. So, if one person uses it, it's allowed. Therefore, the law doesn't overrule individuals.

Wait, but option C says that the ordinance only applies to two or more, so single individuals can create noise without consequence. But according to the law, if you're one person, you're not part of a group that is prohibited. So, the law doesn't apply to individuals. Therefore, the students' argument that the law is too restrictive because it only allows two or more is incorrect. But the question is about the students' weakest argument against enforcement. So, perhaps the argument that the law is not related to any legitimate community interest is a strong argument against enforcement. Alternatively, if the law is not based on a legitimate interest, then it's unconstitutional.

Wait, but the law is about preventing certain types of noise off the premises. It's about preventing two or more people from doing it. So, perhaps the issue isn't about a community interest, but rather about whether the law is applied improperly. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the law prohibits two or more people, but allows individuals to sing alone. So, the law is not overbroad because it's not a requirement for two or more. So, the students' argument that the law is too restrictive (and thus invalid) is correct. But the question is about which argument is the weakest against enforcement.

Wait, perhaps the issue is about the language of the law. The law says "by two or more persons". If the law were "by any number of persons", then it would be overbroad. But the current language is specifically two or more. So, perhaps the law is too restrictive because it only allows two or more, thus excluding single individuals. So, if that's the case, the students are saying that the law is too restrictive, thus invalid. But that's not correct because the law doesn't apply to individuals.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let's think about the options again.

The question is asking which argument would be the weakest against enforcement. So, the students are arguing that the law is too restrictive because it only allows two or more. But that's not the case. The law doesn't restrict individuals because it's about groups of two or more.

Wait, but I'm told the law prohibits two or more from singing, but allows one person. So, the law doesn't apply to individuals. Therefore, the students' argument that the law is too restrictive is invalid. But the question is about which argument would be the weakest against enforcement.

Wait, perhaps the issue isn't about whether the law is overbroad, but about whether it's based on a legitimate interest. For example, if the law is about preventing religious songs, maybe that's a legitimate interest. But the question is about whether the law is overbroad in its application, not whether it's based on a legitimate interest.

Alternatively, perhaps the key issue is that the law is not applicable to all types of singing. If the law only applies to certain types of songs, but not all, then it's not a free expression. But that's a different issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the law only applies to two or more people, so single individuals can create noise without any restrictions. But the students' argument is that the law is too restrictive because it only allows two or more. But that's incorrect because the law doesn't apply to individuals.

Wait, but the question is about the students' argument against enforcement. So, the students are trying to argue that the law is too broad, meaning it's overbroad, thus invalidating the ordinance. So, if the law only applies to two or more people, it's not overbroad because it doesn't apply to any number of people. So, the students' argument would be wrong. But the question is about the weakest argument against enforcement, which would be the least valid. So, the students' argument that it's too restrictive because it only applies to two or more is the correct argument, but perhaps the students are trying to argue that it's not applicable to any number of people, which would be a stronger argument.

Wait, no. The students' argument is that the law prohibits two or more, so single individuals can't sing. But according to the law, if you're one person, you're not part of a group of two or more. So, the law doesn't restrict you. Therefore, the law is not too restrictive. So, the students' argument that the law is too restrictive is correct, but perhaps that's the strongest argument. But the question is about which is the weakest. Wait, no, the question is which would constitute their WEAKEST argument against enforcement.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is not based on a legitimate interest. For example, if the law is about singers who are religious, maybe that's a legitimate interest. But the options don't suggest that, so perhaps it's about whether the law is overbroad. Option C is about the law only applying to two or more, thus preventing single individuals. But according to the law, that's not the case. So, the law doesn't apply to individuals, so the argument that it's too restrictive is invalid.

Alternatively, maybe the law's description is confusing. Let me re-examine the wording: "by two or more persons if such noise is audible off the premises." So, if two or more are singing or chanting, it's prohibited. But if one person does it, it's allowed. So, the law doesn't apply to individuals. Therefore, the students' argument that it's too restrictive is correct, but perhaps that's the strongest argument. However, the question is about the weakest.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is not considering whether the individuals can sing or chant. Option G says the law is biased against those who can't sing or chant. But the law's language doesn't address that. It just prohibits singing or chanting regardless of whether someone can do it. So, that's not the issue. So, G is not the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the law is not considering cultural importance. Option F says it's against the First and Fourteenth Amendments. But the law is about freedom of speech, not about religious freedom. So, F is not the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the law is only about two or more people, thus making it too restrictive, but that's not the case. The law doesn't restrict individuals.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the law is not about any type of singing, but only for specific songs. So, if the ordinance is about all forms of singing, then it's too restrictive. But the law is about specific songs, so maybe it's not. Alternatively, perhaps the law is not about all forms of singing but only certain ones.

Wait, perhaps the key issue is that the law's prohibition is about people, not about the nature of the singing. So, the law doesn't prevent all forms of singing, only certain types. So, if the ordinance only prohibits certain songs, then it's not a free expression. But the students are singing a song that is not religious. So, maybe the law is too restrictive because it's not about any form of singing, only specific ones. So, if the law prohibits only certain types of singing, then it's too restrictive. But the students are singing a non-religious song, so perhaps that's not the issue.

I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the options again.

Option C: The ordinance is not fair because it only applies to two or more persons, thus single individuals can create noise without consequence. But according to the law, if you're one person, you're not part of a group of two or more, so you're allowed to use the singing. Therefore, this argument is incorrect. So, the students' argument that it's too restrictive because it only applies to two or more is correct, but perhaps it's the strongest argument.

But the question is about the weakest argument. Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law prohibits two or more, but allows one person. So, the law is not overbroad because it doesn't apply to individuals. Therefore, the students' argument that it's too restrictive is correct, but perhaps that's the correct argument. But the question is about the weakest. Alternatively, perhaps the students think it's too restrictive because it's only allowing two or more to use it, thus excluding single individuals. But according to the law, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is not considering whether the individuals are religious. Option G was about that, but the law doesn't address that. So, G isn't the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is not considering cultural importance. Option F was about that, but the law is about freedom of speech, not religious freedom. So, F is not the correct answer.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to approach this differently.

Which of the options is the weakest argument against enforcement? The students are trying to argue that the law is too restrictive because it only applies to two or more. But the law doesn't apply to individuals. So, the students' argument that it's too restrictive is correct, but perhaps not the weakest. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that it's not based on a legitimate community interest. So, if the law is about preventing certain types of speech, but it's not a legitimate interest, then it's unconstitutional.

But the law is about preventing two or more people from using it, without a specific reason. So, it's about preventing noise, not about religious freedom. So, that's a different issue.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is not considering whether the individuals are capable of singing. So, Option G: the law is biased against those who can't sing or chant. But the law doesn't address that; it just prohibits two or more from using it, regardless of whether someone can sing.

So, G is not the correct answer. So, the students' argument that the law is too restrictive because it only allows two or more is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which argument would be the weakest against enforcement. So, perhaps the argument that the law is not applicable because it's overbroad is the weakest. Let me think.

Option C: The law prohibits two or more, so single individuals can't sing. But according to the law, if you're one person, you're not part of a group of two or more, so you can still sing. Therefore, the law doesn't apply to individuals. So, the students' argument that it's too restrictive is correct. But perhaps that's the strongest argument.

Wait, but the question is about the weakest. So, perhaps the students' argument is not the weakest. Maybe another option is weaker.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the law is not considering whether the individuals can actually sing. So, if someone is a cyclist, they can't sing, but the law doesn't address that. So, that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is not considering the cultural or religious aspects. Option F is about First and Fourteenth Amendments, but the law is about freedom of speech, so F is not correct.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of each option and which is the weakest against enforcement.

Option A: Deprives people of liberty without due process because the law is not related to a legitimate community interest. That's a strong argument because the law is about preventing noise, not about religious freedom. So, it's not a legitimate interest, making it unconstitutional. That's a valid argument.

Option B: Discriminates against religious songs. But the law doesn't discriminate; it just prohibits. So, B is incorrect.

Option C: Applies only to two or more, thus single individuals can't sing. But according to the law, single individuals can sing, so this is incorrect. So, C is a correct argument.

Option D: Implies that the law is differentiates between religiously inspired and others, so it's fair. But the law doesn't address this differentiation; it's just about preventing. So, D is a correct argument.

Option E: The law is invalid because it's overbroad. But the law doesn't apply to individuals, so it's not overbroad. So, E is incorrect.

Option F: Against First and Fourteenth. Not relevant.

Option G: Biased against those who can't sing. Not relevant.

Option H: Ignore cultural importance. Not relevant.

Option I: Enforceable because it's after a special occasion. Not relevant.

Option J: The law contradicts the students' rights. That's a correct argument.

Wait, now I'm confused. The students' argument is that the law is too restrictive because it only allows two or more. But according to the law, that's not the case. So, the students are correct in their argument, but perhaps another option is a stronger argument.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is too restrictive because it doesn't consider whether the individuals can actually sing. So, if someone can't, the law allows them, which is fine. So, that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is not based on a legitimate community interest. So, the law is about preventing noise, not about religious freedom. So, the students' argument that it's unconstitutional because it's not a legitimate community interest is correct. But the question is about the weakest argument.

Alternatively, perhaps the students are arguing that the law is too restrictive because it's overbroad. But according to the law, it's not overbroad because it doesn't apply to individuals. So, that's incorrect. But the students are correct in their argument.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is not considering the types of singers. So, Option F, which was about the First Amendment, is irrelevant. So, F is not the answer.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the law prohibits two or more from using it, but it's not about any kind of speech. So, perhaps the law is not about freedom of speech, but about preventing a certain type of noise, which is not the issue here.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of each option again in context.

The students argue that the ordinance is too restrictive because it only allows two or more to use it, thus preventing single individuals. But according to the law, single individuals can use it.

Wait, but the law says "by two or more persons if such noise is audible off the premises." So, the requirement is for two or more. If you're one person, you're not part of a group that is prohibited. Therefore, the law doesn't apply to individuals. So, the students' argument that it's too restrictive is correct.

Wait, but the question is which argument is the weakest. So, perhaps the students' strongest argument is correct, but maybe another option is weaker.

Alternatively, perhaps the students are correct because their argument is stronger than the others. But the question is about the weakest.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is not considering the types of singers. So, Option F is not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is not considering the religious aspect. Option G is not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is not considering whether the individuals can actually sing. So, Option D is not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is not considering whether the individuals are capable of using it. So, the students' argument that it's too restrictive is correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is not considering whether the individuals are religious. Option G is not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is not considering whether the individuals can actually sing or chant. So, the students' argument that it's too restrictive is correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the law is not considering whether the individuals can sing or chant, but the students are singing a non-religious song. So, perhaps that's not the issue.
