Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about a thermopile and a furnace. Hmm, I remember thermopiles are devices that convert heat into electricity. So, when they're near other sources of heat, their output changes.

The problem says there's a thermopile near a furnace with a small circular opening. The furnace is at 2000 K, and the distance is such that the hole subtends the same solid angle as the sun's disk. Oh wait, I should probably recall what a solid angle is. Solid angle is like the 3D version of the angle, right? The bigger the solid angle, the more light you're getting.

The galvanometer deflection is given as (1/80) of what it was when the thermopile is in full sunlight. I think when a source emits radiation, the radiation intensity depends on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is I = εσT⁴, where ε is emissivity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature.

So, when the source is in full sunlight, the entire surface emits radiation. But when the source is near a heated object, only the part of the surface within the solid angle of the source emits radiation. Wait, maybe I should model this. The problem states that the hole's solid angle equals that of the sun's disk. Oh, but the sun's disk is a full sphere's cross-section, so the solid angle of the sun is 4π steradians, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe the sun's disk subtends a certain solid angle, and the hole in the thermopile does too.

Wait, the hole's solid angle is the same as the sun's. But the sun's solid angle is 4π steradians (since it's a sphere, the entire sphere is 4π). Oh wait, no. Actually, the sun's disk is a tiny part of the sky, but the solid angle it subtends is (π/2)^2, or maybe (π/√2)^2. Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The sun's disk has a certain solid angle. So, the hole in the thermopile has the same solid angle as the sun's disk.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure this.

The setup is: there's a furnace (or a source of heat) at 2000 K. It's placed at a distance where the hole (which is like a small opening) in the thermopile subtends the same solid angle as the sun's disk. So, the hole in the thermopile has a solid angle equal to that of the sun's disk.

Wait, maybe the sun's disk is the entire visible area, but I think the sun's disk is a small part of the sky. Let me think: the sun's disk is a circle, but when viewed from Earth, it's a small angle. The solid angle of the sun's disk as seen from Earth is about 0.008 steradians (I think, but I'm not exact on the number). But perhaps in this problem, the sun's disk is considered to subtend a solid angle of Ω. The hole in the thermopile subtends the same solid angle, so their solid angles are equal.

So, the problem states that the deflection is (1/80) when the hole's solid angle is the same as the sun's. Wait, the question says the deflection is (1/80) of that when the thermopile is in full sunlight. So, I need to compare the galvanometer deflection in two scenarios: one where the hole's solid angle equals the sun's, and another where the source is in full sunlight.

Galvanometer deflection is proportional to the power (energy per unit time) passing through it. So, when a source emits radiation, the power is I * A, where I is the intensity and A is the area. But the area through which the radiation passes depends on the solid angle.

So, the power received by the thermopile would be I * (hole area) / (solid angle) * solid angle? Or wait, perhaps the power is I * (area projected), but the area projected depends on the solid angle.

Wait, probably the power received is the product of the flux (intensity) and the area projected onto the sensor. The area projected is A * cosθ, where θ is the angle between the normal to the surface and the line of sight. But when considering a small hole, the solid angle is (A/d²), where A is the area of the hole and d is the distance. So, the flux through the hole is I * A * cosθ. But I think in this problem, we're considering the flux through the hole as the power received.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the flux received by the thermopile. The flux (intensity) from the source is I_source = ε σ T⁴. The power received by the thermopile is I_source * (A * cosθ), where A is the area of the hole (since only the part of the hole in the direction of the source contributes), and cosθ is the cosine of the angle between the hole's normal and the source's direction.

But the flux through the hole (power received) is I * (A * cosθ) = I * (A) * (1/d) cosθ, because θ is the angle. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the solid angle is Ω, the flux through the hole is I * (A / d²) * (1/2), because the solid angle of a sphere is 4π, but the solid angle of the hole is Ω. So, I think the flux through the hole is I * (A * cosθ) = I * (A / d²) * (1/2) (since the solid angle is Ω = A/d², assuming the hole is small and solid angle is small.)

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think about the flux received by a small area A. The flux is I * A * cosθ. But the flux is equivalent to the power per unit area, so the power through area A is P = I * A * cosθ.

But the flux is also I * (area projected on the sensor). The area projected would be A * cosθ. However, since the source is a distance d, the flux through the area is I * (A * cosθ) = I * A * (d / (d))^2 * cosθ = I * A * cosθ. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: The power received by the thermopile is the flux from the source multiplied by the area through which the flux passes. The flux is the power per unit area, so the received power P = I * (A * cosθ) = I * area * cosθ, where area is the area of the hole (since the hole is small, only that part contributes). Alternatively, considering the solid angle, perhaps the effective area is A * cosθ, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the power received is the intensity of the source multiplied by the area through which the flux passes. The flux through the area is I * (A / d²) * (1/2) if the solid angle is Ω = A / d². Wait, this might not be right.

Alternatively, the power received by the thermopile is P = (intensity) * (area) * cosθ. But the intensity is the same as the flux, so P = I * A * cosθ. But wait, the source emits energy in all directions, so the flux from the source is I = ε σ T⁴. The flux through the area A is I * A * (cosθ), where θ is the angle between the source's direction and the area's normal.

Now, the hole subtends the same solid angle as the sun's disk. Let me denote that solid angle as Ω. So, the solid angle of the sun is the same as that of the hole.

The solid angle of a sphere is 4π steradians. The sun's disk is a circle, which subtends a certain solid angle. Let me call the solid angle of the sun's disk as Ω. The hole in the thermopile subtends the same Ω.

So, the flux through the hole is P = I * (A * cosθ) = I * (A * (d / d * sin(θ/2)) )? Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again.

The flux through the hole is I * (A * cosθ). But since the solid angle is the same as the sun's, let me think about the flux in terms of the solid angle. The solid angle Ω is (A * cosθ) / d², right? Because for a small area A, the solid angle is Ω = A * cosθ / d², given that the distance is d.

Wait, so Ω = (A * cosθ) / (d²). So, the flux through the hole is P = I * (A * cosθ) = I * (d² * Ω). Because rearranged: I = (P) / (A cosθ) = (I * A cosθ) = (d² Ω) * I.

Wait, no, I think I should express it in terms of the solid angle. The power received is P = I * (A * cosθ) = I * (d² * Ω). Because from the formula, I = ε σ T⁴, and the flux through the area is I * A * cosθ = ε σ T⁴ * A cosθ. But since Ω = (A cosθ) / d², then A cosθ = d² Ω. So, substituting, the power P = ε σ T⁴ * d² Ω.

So, the power received by the thermopile is proportional to T⁴ multiplied by the solid angle Ω.

Now, when the source is in full sunlight, the flux through the thermopile is maximum. Let me compute that. When the source emits uniformly, the flux through the hole is I * A * cosθ. Since the solid angle is 4π steradians (the sun's disk), because the sun's disk subtends a full sphere. Wait, no, the sun's disk is a part of the sky, not the entire sphere. So, the solid angle of the sun's disk is something less than 4π steradians. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the solid angle wrong.

Wait, perhaps the sun's disk is a circle viewed from Earth. So, the solid angle for a disk is 2π (1 - cos φ), where φ is the angular radius. But wait, the sun's angular radius is about 0.5 degrees, so φ is approximately 0.5 degrees. But perhaps this is getting too detailed and I should focus on the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when the source is in full sunlight, the solid angle is 4π steradians, so the flux through the hole is I_source * (A * cosθ) = I_source * (A * 1), since cosθ = 1 (if the source is directly in front, θ is 0). Because when the source is in full sunlight, the flux through the hole is I * A. Then, the power received is P = I * A.

Wait, but the problem says that when the source is in full sunlight, the deflection is some value, let's say D. When the source is near the hole, the deflection is (1/80) D.

So, when the hole's solid angle is the same as the sun's, the flux through the hole is I * (A * cosθ), which is I * (d² Ω), because Ω = A cosθ / d². So, I * (d² Ω) is the flux.

When the source is in full sunlight, the flux through the hole is I * A. So the power in this case is P_full_sun = I_full_sun * A.

The power when the hole is the same solid angle is P_hole = I * (d² Ω).

The galvanometer deflection is proportional to the power. So, the ratio of the two deflections is (P_hole) / (P_full_sun) = (I * d² Ω) / (I * A) ) = (d² Ω) / A.

Wait, but I is the same in both cases? Or is it not? Wait, when the source is in full sunlight, it's uniformly emitting, so I_full_sun = ε σ T⁴.

When the source is near the hole, the power received is P_hole = (I * A * cosθ) = (ε σ T⁴) * (A cosθ). But A cosθ = d² Ω, from earlier. So, P_hole = ε σ T⁴ * d² Ω.

Now, the power when in full sunlight is P_full_sun = I_full_sun * A = ε σ T⁴ * A.

So, the ratio of P_hole to P_full_sun is (ε σ T⁴ d² Ω ) / (ε σ T⁴ A ) ) = (d² Ω ) / A.

But the problem states that the deflection is (1/80) when the hole's solid angle equals the sun's. So, the ratio is (1/80) = (d² Ω) / A.

But wait, what is Ω? The sun's solid angle is Ω_sun, and the hole's solid angle is equal to Ω_sun. So, Ω = Ω_sun.

So, (1/80) = (d² Ω_sun) / A.

But I'm not sure how to find the relationship between d and A. Alternatively, perhaps I should express A in terms of some known quantities. Wait, the hole is placed near the furnace. The distance is such that the hole subtends the same solid angle as the sun's disk. The problem gives that the solid angle of the sun's disk is the same as the hole. So, I think the setup allows us to relate these quantities via d and the solid angle.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of the problem in terms of the flux and power.

The flux (power per unit area) from the source when it's in full sunlight is I_full_sun = ε σ T⁴.

The power through the hole (P_hole) is I_full_sun * A * cosθ. But since θ is such that the solid angle is Ω, and the solid angle is (A * cosθ) / d² = Ω. So, A cosθ = d² Ω.

So, P_hole = I_full_sun * A * cosθ = I_full_sun * (d² Ω).

The power when the source is in full sunlight is P_full_sun = I_full_sun * A.

So, the ratio is P_hole / P_full_sun = (I_full_sun * d² Ω ) / (I_full_sun * A) ) = (d² Ω) / A.

The problem says that P_hole / P_full_sun = 1/80.

So,

( d² Ω ) / A = 1/80.

But I don't know what Ω is in terms of the sun's properties. Alternatively, perhaps the hole's solid angle is the same as the sun's, which is 4π steradians? No, that can't be right. The sun's disk is a small part of the sky, so its solid angle is less than 4π.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the sun's solid angle. The sun's disk as seen from Earth subtends a certain solid angle. Let me recall that the sun's angular diameter is about 0.5 degrees, which is about 0.0087 radians. The solid angle can be approximated as (2θ)² / 4, but wait, that's for a dipole approximation. Alternatively, the solid angle of a circle (like the sun) can be approximated as Ω ≈ (2θ)^2, where θ is the angular radius. So, θ is 0.5 degrees, which is about 0.0087 radians. So, (2 * 0.0087) )² = (0.0174 )² = 0.0003025 steradians. Approximately 0.0003 sr.

But I'm not entirely confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the formula.

So, the ratio (d² Ω) / A = 1/80.

But I need another equation relating d and A. Wait, perhaps the problem gives that the distance is such that the hole subtends the same solid angle as the sun's disk. So, the solid angle of the hole is Ω = (A * cosθ) / (d²). But I don't know θ, because the hole's position isn't given. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the distance d in terms of the hole's area.

Wait, perhaps the distance d is such that the hole's area is A = π (a)^2, where a is the radius of the hole. But without knowing a, this seems tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the formula without the specific geometry.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the flux received when the source is in full sunlight and when it's near the hole.

When the source is in full sunlight, the flux through the hole is I_full_sun * A. And the power is P_full = I_full_sun * A.

When the source is near the hole, the flux through the hole is I * A * cosθ, and the power is P_hole = I * A cosθ.

The galvanometer deflection is proportional to the power. So, deflection (D) is proportional to P. So, D_hole = k * P_hole, D_full = k * P_full.

Given that D_hole = (1/80) D_full.

So,

k * P_hole = (1/80) * k * P_full.

Canceling k, we get P_hole = (1/80) P_full.

So,

I * A cosθ = (1/80) * I_full_sun * A.

Canceling I and A from both sides,

cosθ = (1/80) * I_full_sun.

But I_full_sun is ε σ T⁴, and I here is ε σ T_p^4 (T_p is the temperature of the thermopile). So,

cosθ = (I_full_sun / 80 ) / I_hole.

Wait, no, I_hole is the power emitted by the thermopile (ignoring the efficiency of the thermopile, but since it's a perfect insulator, perhaps it's all emitted).

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplified, and I can ignore the efficiency of the thermopile. So, the power emitted by the thermopile is P = ε σ T_p^4, but since it's a perfect insulator, all that power is absorbed by the thermopile. So, P = ε σ T_p^4.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed.

So,

I_hole = ε σ T_p^4.

I_full_sun = ε σ T_full^4.

So,

cosθ = (I_full_sun / 80) / I_hole.

Hmm,

cosθ = ( (ε σ T_full^4) / 80 ) / ( ε σ T_p^4 ) )

Simplify,

cosθ = ( T_full^4 / 80 ) / T_p^4.

Which is,

cosθ = ( (3000)^4 ) / (80) ) / ( (2000)^4 ).

Wait, because the problem states that the distance is such that the hole's solid angle equals the sun's. But the problem also says that the hole's solid angle is the same as the sun's solid angle. So, the sun's solid angle is the same as the hole's solid angle.

Wait, let's think about the sun's solid angle. The sun's disk is a small part of the sky. The solid angle of the sun's disk is about 0.008 steradians, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed with the formula.

So,

cosθ = ( (T_full^4) / 80 ) / (T_p^4 )

= (T_full^4 / (80 T_p^4) )

= ( (3000/2000)^4 ) / 80

= ( (3/2)^4 ) / 80

= (81/16) / 80

= 81/(16*80) = 81/1280 ≈ 0.06328.

So, cosθ ≈ 0.06328, which implies θ ≈ arccos(0.06328) ≈ 86 degrees.

Wait, but then the power ratio is (I_full_sun * d² Ω ) / (I_hole * A ) = ( (I_full_sun / I_hole) * (d² Ω / A) ) ).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the ratio d² Ω / A. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the flux.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the flux from the source when the hole is the same as the sun's solid angle.

The flux through the hole is I * A * cosθ. But the solid angle of the hole is Ω = (A cosθ) / d².

So, I * A cosθ = I * (d² Ω).

So, P_hole = I * d² Ω.

The power when the source is in full sunlight is P_full = I_full_sun * A.

So, the ratio of P_hole to P_full is (I d² Ω) / (I A) )= (d² Ω) / A.

But I also know that the ratio of the deflections is (1/80) = (d² Ω) / A.

So,

d² Ω = A (1/80).

But I'm not sure how to relate A and d. Wait, perhaps the distance d is such that the hole's area is A = π a², and the solid angle is Ω = (A cosθ) / d².

But without knowing a, this seems impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the formula without the specific geometric considerations, relying on the ratio of solid angles and the flux.

Wait, another approach: The flux through the hole is I * A * cosθ, and the flux through the whole area of the sun is I_sun * A_sun * cosθ_sun.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to write the equations again.

We have:

1. P_hole = I_hole * A * cosθ = (ε σ T_p^4) * A * cosθ.

2. P_full_sun = I_sun * A_sun = (ε σ T_full^4) * A_sun.

The ratio of the powers is (P_hole) / (P_full) = [ (T_p^4) * A * cosθ ] / [ (T_full^4) * A_sun ) ].

But I don't know A and A_sun. Wait, perhaps the distance d is such that the area of the hole is A = π a², and the solid angle of the hole is Ω = (A cosθ) / d².

But without knowing a or θ, this is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the formula that the power is proportional to T^4, and the flux through the hole depends on the solid angle.

In that case, the flux through the hole is proportional to T_p^4, and the flux through the whole sun's disk is proportional to T_full^4.

But the ratio is (P_hole / P_full) = (T_p^4) / (T_full^4) ) * (Ω / (4 π) ) * (1/ d^2) ) ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think about the formula again.

The power received by the thermopile is P = I * A * cosθ, where θ is the angle between the source's direction and the thermopile's normal. The solid angle of the source's disk is Ω = (A cosθ) / d². So, the power P = I * (d² Ω) ).

When the source is in full sunlight, the flux through the hole is I * A * cosθ. The power is P_full = I * A.

So, the ratio of the power in the two cases is P_hole / P_full = (I * (d² Ω )) ) / (I * A ) = (d² Ω ) / A.

Given that the ratio is (1/80) = (d² Ω ) / A.

But I don't know A or Ω. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the solid angle of the sun is 4π steradians, but that can't be correct because the sun's disk is a small part of the sky. Alternatively, perhaps the sun's solid angle as seen from Earth is 2π (1 - cos φ), where φ is about 0.5 degrees, which is approximately 0.0087 radians.

So, Ω ≈ 2 * π * (1 - cos(0.0087)) ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * (1 - 0.9999992) ) ≈ 6.283 * 0.0000008 ≈ 5.026e-6 sr.

That's a really small solid angle. So, the ratio (d² Ω ) / A would be (d² * 5.026e-6) / A.

But without knowing d or A, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by assuming that A is the same in both cases, which is not the case, but maybe that's a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the formula.

Given that the ratio is (d² Ω ) / A = 1/80.

But I'm not sure how to relate Ω and A. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the fact that the solid angle of the sun's disk is about 0.008 steradians, and the distance d is such that (d² Ω ) / A = 1/80.

But without knowing A, this is impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the fact that the power received when near the hole is (I * A) * (d² Ω) / (d^2 * (Ω) ) ), but that seems unclear.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the problem. The problem gives that the deflection when the hole's solid angle equals the sun's solid angle is (1/80) of the maximum deflection. So, the ratio is 1/80.

The ratio of the power is (d² Ω ) / A = 1/80.

But I don't know A or Ω. Unless I can find a relation between d and A, perhaps from the distance.

Wait, perhaps the hole is a certain area A, and the distance d is such that the solid angle of the hole is Ω. But without knowing A, this is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that the flux from the source when in full sunlight is I_full_sun, and when near the hole, it's I_hole, which is the flux through the hole. But that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm missing a key equation.

Wait, perhaps the flux from the source when in full sunlight is I_full_sun, and when near the hole, it's I_hole = I * (A * cosθ) / (d²). Wait, no, because the flux through the hole is I * A * cosθ.

But when the source is in full sunlight, the flux through the hole is I * A, because the solid angle is 4π steradians, so the flux is I * A.

So, the ratio is (I * (A * cosθ) ) / (I * A ) ) = cosθ.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense, because when the source is in full sunlight, cosθ is 1, so the ratio would be 1, but the problem says the ratio is (1/80), which implies that cosθ is (1/80).

But that doesn't make sense because the solid angle of the sun's disk is about 0.008 steradians, so cosθ would be cos(0.008) ≈ 0.99998, which is approximately 1. So, the ratio is about 1, which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm approaching it incorrectly. Let's try to think about the problem again.

The problem states that the distance is such that the hole subtends the same solid angle as the sun's disk. So, the solid angle of the hole (Ω) equals the solid angle of the sun's disk (Ω_sun).

The flux through the hole is I_hole = I * (A * cosθ) = I * (d² Ω).

When the source is in full sunlight, the flux through the hole is I_sun * A = ε σ T⁴ * A.

The ratio of the two fluxes is (I_hole) / (I_sun * A) ) = (d² Ω) / A.

This ratio is given as 1/80.

So,

d² Ω = A (1/80).

But I don't know A, which is the area of the hole. Oh wait, the problem doesn't give the size of the hole. So, I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the problem is intended to be solved using the formula for the flux ratio, and ignore the specific geometry, as the distance is adjusted such that the solid angle condition is met.

Wait, maybe the problem is intended to use the fact that the flux ratio is (T_p^4) / (T_f^4) ) * (Ω / (4 π)) ) * (1/ d^2) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the solid angle of the sun is 4π, which is impossible. But perhaps it's a typo and intended to use a different value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the solid angle and just use the fact that the flux ratio is (1/80) = (T_p^4) / (T_f^4) ) * (A / A) ) * ... but I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the problem is intended to use the fact that the solid angle of the sun's disk is 4π, which is impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the solid angle and only consider the flux ratio.

Wait, perhaps the flux ratio is (1/80) = (T_p^4) / (T_f^4) ) * (A / A) ), but that doesn't make sense because the area cancels out.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the area of the hole A is the same in both cases, but that's not possible because the flux through the hole depends on the solid angle.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the formula that the flux ratio is (1/80) = (T_p^4) / (T_f^4) ) * (A / A) ), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the fact that the power is proportional to T^4, and the flux through the hole is proportional to T^4 * (Ω).

So, the ratio of the power is ( (T_p^4) * (Ω) ) / ( (T_f^4) * (Ω) ) ) = (T_p^4 / T_f^4 ) ) * (Ω / Ω ) ) = (T_p^4 / T_f^4 ).

But the problem says the ratio is 1/80, so (T_p^4 / T_f^4 ) = 1/80.

Taking the fourth root, T_p / T_f = (1/80)^(1/4) ) ≈ (0.0125)^0.25 ≈ 0.625.

So, T_p ≈ 0.625 T_f.

So, the temperature of the thermopile is 0.625 times that of the furnace.

But the problem doesn't give the temperature of the furnace. Wait, the problem says 'the distance is such that the hole subtends the same solid angle as the sun's disk'.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the distance d such that the hole's solid angle is equal to the sun's solid angle. But without knowing the size of the hole, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the hole's area A such that (A * cosθ) / d² = Ω, where Ω is the sun's solid angle.

But without knowing A or θ, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the flux ratio (I * cosθ ) / (I_full_sun ) ) = 1/80.

So,

cosθ = (I_full_sun / 80 ) / I.

But I don't know I or I_full_sun. So, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the geometry and just use the formula with the flux ratio.

Wait, so the flux through the hole is I_hole = I * cosθ.

The flux when in full sunlight is I_full_sun.

The ratio is I_hole / I_full_sun = (I * cosθ) / I_full_sun = 1/80.

But I don't know I or I_full_sun. So, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the hole's radius a, and the distance d is such that (π a² cosθ) ) / d² = Ω.

But without knowing a, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the solid angle of the hole equal to the solid angle of the sun's disk. So, Ω_hole = Ω_sun.

But then, the solid angle of the sun's disk is Ω_sun = (A * cosθ ) / d², where A is the area of the sun's disk, but I don't know A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the flux through the hole equal to (I * cosθ) = (I_full_sun) * (1/80).

So,

cosθ = (I_full_sun) / (80 I).

But I don't know I or I_full_sun.

Hmm, this is really confusing. Maybe I should try to think of the problem in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the flux.

The flux emitted by the thermopile is F = ε σ T_p².

The flux from the source when the hole is the same solid angle as the sun's disk is F_hole = F * cosθ.

The flux when the source is in full sunlight is F_full = F * 1.

The ratio of the fluxes is F_hole / F_full = cosθ = 1/80.

So,

cosθ = 1/80.

Thus,

T_p = T_f * sqrt( (1/80) )

Wait, no, because F_hole = F * cosθ.

So,

F_hole = F * cosθ.

F_full = F.

So,

F_hole / F_full = cosθ = 1/80.

So,

F_hole = F * (1/80).

But F is the flux from the source.

So,

F_hole = F * (1/80).

Now, F is the power emitted by the thermopile, which is F = ε σ T_p^4.

So,

F_hole = ε σ T_p^4 * (1/80 ) = F * (1/80 ).

So,

ε σ T_p^4 / 80 = ε σ T_f^4.

Canceling ε σ,

T_p^4 / 80 = T_f^4.

So,

T_p = T_f * (80)^(1/4).

But (80)^(1/4) is about 3, so T_p ≈ 3 T_f.

But the problem says the ratio is 1/80. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the flux ratio. If F_hole = F * cosθ, then F_hole = F * (1/80).

But F is the flux from the source when in full sunlight. Wait, no, F is the power emitted by the thermopile. So, F = ε σ T_p^4.

So, F_hole = F * cosθ = ε σ T_p^4 * (1/80).

But F is the power emitted by the thermopile, so F_hole is the power emitted by the hole (the thermopile) through the hole.

Wait, but the power through the hole is F_hole = F * cosθ.

The power when the source is in full sunlight is F_full = F.

So, F_hole / F_full = cosθ = 1/80.

So,

F_hole = F * (1/80) = ε σ T_p^4 * (1/80).

But F is ε σ T_p^4.

So,

F_hole = (ε σ T_p^4 ) * (1/80 ) = F * (1/80 ).

So, yes, the ratio is 1/80.

But the problem states that the deflection when the hole's solid angle equals the sun's solid angle is (1/80) of the maximum deflection. So, the ratio is 1/80.

So, the calculation is correct.

So, the temperature of the thermopile is 3 times that of the source.

But the problem doesn't give the source's temperature, so perhaps the problem assumes the source's temperature is zero. But that can't be because the source emits radiation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the source's temperature as zero, but that's not physically correct because radiation is emitted.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the source's temperature and assume it's zero, but that's not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the ratio of the fluxes is 1/80, which gives the ratio of the temperatures as (80)^(1/4) = 3. So, T_p = 3 T_f.

But the problem doesn't give T_f, so perhaps the answer is 3 times the source's temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the distance is such that the hole subtends the same solid angle as the sun's disk. So, the calculation of the solid angle leads to the ratio of 1/80.

So, the final answer is T_p = 3 T_f.

But the problem doesn't specify the source's temperature, so perhaps the answer is simply 3 times the source's temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the distance is such that the hole subtends the same solid angle as the sun's disk. So, the solid angle is Ω. So, the flux ratio is (d² Ω ) / A = 1/80.

But I don't know Ω or A.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the solid angle of the sun's disk as 4π, which is impossible, but perhaps it's a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the solid angle of the sun's disk as 2π, which is the solid angle of a hemisphere, but that's also unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the solid angle of the sun's disk as (1/80) * (d² A), but without knowing d or A, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the solid angle of the sun's disk as (1/80) * (d² A), but since A is the area of the hole, which is (π a²), and d is the distance, perhaps the problem is intended to have the solid angle Ω = (d² π a²) / (4 π) ) = (d² a²) / 4.

But without knowing a, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the flux ratio as (1/80), which leads to the temperature ratio of 3, so T_p = 3 T_f.

But the problem doesn't give T_f. So, perhaps the answer is simply 3 times the source's temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the distance is such that the hole subtends the same solid angle as the sun's disk. So, the solid angle is the same, but without knowing the size of the hole, I can't find the solid angle.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the solid angle of the sun's disk as Ω = (d² π a²) / (4 π) ) = (d² a²) / 4.

But without knowing a, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the solid angle of the sun's disk as Ω = (d² a²) / 4, but since a is the radius of the hole, and d is the distance, perhaps the problem is intended to have the solid angle as Ω = (d² a²) / 4, and the problem is to find T_p in terms of T_f.

But without knowing a, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the solid angle of the sun's disk as Ω = (d² a²) / 4, and the problem is to find T_p in terms of T_f, but without knowing a, I can't proceed.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. The key point is that the flux ratio is 1/80, leading to T_p = 3 T_f.

But the problem doesn't give T_f, so perhaps the answer is simply 3 times the source's temperature.

So, the final answer is 3 times the source's temperature.

The temperature of the thermopile is 3 times the temperature of the source. 

ANSWER: 3 times the source's temperature.
