Okay, so I have this question about legumes. The question asks which of the options given are not legumes. The options are A to G: peas, soybeans, peanuts, radishes, lentils, beans, and chickpeas.

First, I need to remember what legumes are. Legumes are plants that produce beans, such as beans, lentils, chickpeas, peas, etc. They're also called legumes because they're part of the legume family in plants. So, they're the ones that have beans in their seeds, right?

Now, let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Peas. Peas are definitely legumes because they're beans. So, peas are legumes. So A is not the answer.

Option B: Soybeans. Soybeans are a legume, part of the legume family. They're another example of beans. So B is legumes, not the answer.

Option C: Peanuts. Peanuts are another legume, specifically a legume called peanuts. So C is legumes.

Option D: Radishes. Radishes are vegetables, not legumes. They're also called turnips or green beans. So D is definitely not a legume.

Option E: Lentils. Lentils are a legume, a plant that produces beans. So E is a legume.

Option F: Beans.Beans are legumes because they're beans. So F is a legume.

Option G: Chickpeas. Chickpeas are legumes, like lentils and peas. So G is a legume.

Wait, but looking back, the question is which are NOT legumes. So from the options, the ones that aren't legumes are the ones that are not beans or part of the legume family.

Looking at the options, D is radishes, which are vegetables. So the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D: radishes. These are not legumes as they are vegetables, specifically a type of plant called radish. 

Answer: D
