Okay, so I've got this problem about Mr. Atlas and his note. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says he had a note for $45,000. He discounted it 120 days before it was due. The bank's discount rate was 6%. I need to find the proceeds he gets.

Hmm, I remember that when you discount a note, the proceeds are the amount you actually receive when the note is sold at a discount. The formula for this is usually based on simple interest, right?

So, the formula for proceeds when discounting a note is:

Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value × Discount Rate × Time)

Wait, or is it (Face Value × (1 - (Discount Rate × Time))) ? Oh, wait, the discount rate is typically applied to the face value, but when you discount before the due date, the discount is calculated up to the discounting date.

Wait, let me think. The time here is 120 days, so the discount period is 120 days. Since the note is discounted 120 days before it's due, that means the discount period is 120 days. So the time factor is 120/360 because we're probably using a 360-day year for simplicity.

Wait, but sometimes in exams, the exact number of days is used, but 120 is likely. So let me proceed with 120 days.

So, the discount rate is 6%, so 0.06 in decimal.

So, the discount amount would be Face Value × (Discount Rate × Time). Wait no, wait. No, the discount is based on the face value. Wait, maybe the formula is:

Discount = Face Value × (Discount Rate × Time)

Then, Proceeds = Face Value - Discount

Alternatively, sometimes the discount is calculated as the amount you pay. Wait, but the question is asking for the proceeds, which is the amount you receive. So yes, that formula should work.

So, let's plug in the numbers.

Face Value = $45,000
Discount Rate = 6% (0.06)
Time = 120 days. Since it's a 360-day year, 120/360 is 1/3 of a year.

So, Discount = 45000 * 0.06 * (120/360)

Calculating that:

First, 120/360 is 1/3. So, 0.06 * 1/3 = 0.02.

So, Discount = 45000 * 0.02 = 900.

So, the discount is $900. Therefore, the proceeds would be 45000 - 900 = 44100.

Looking at the options, option A is $44,100. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is the discount calculated on the face value or the discounted amount? No, I think I did that right because when discounting, you take the face value and discount it at the rate for the time.

Alternatively, sometimes the formula is:

Proceeds = Face Value × (1 - (Discount Rate × Time))

Which is the same as Face Value - (Face Value × Discount Rate × Time). So yeah, same thing.

So the answer should be option A: $44,100.

The correct answer is A: $44,100.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the given values:**
   - Face Value (FV) = $45,000
   - Discount Rate (r) = 6% = 0.06
   - Time (t) = 120 days

2. **Convert time to a fraction of the year:**
   - Since it's a 360-day year, 120 days = 120/360 = 1/3 year.

3. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - Discount = FV × r × t = 45000 × 0.06 × (1/3)
   - Discount = 45000 × 0.02 = $900.

4. **Determine the proceeds:**
   - Proceeds = FV - Discount = 45000 - 900 = $44,100.

5. **Match the result to the options:**
   - Option A: $44,100 is the correct answer.
