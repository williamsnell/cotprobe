Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about heating water using an immersion heater. Hmm, let's see what I can figure out. Alright, let me read the question again.

So the system is 82.5 grams of liquid water at 300 K. They're heating it with an immersion heater at a constant pressure of 1.00 bar. Oh right, the current is 1.75 A through a 25.0 ohm resistor for 100 seconds. The question is, what's the final temperature? The options are A to J, with various K values.

Wait, I remember that when current passes through a resistor, it generates heat. So the power consumed by the resistor will be converted into heat, which raises the temperature of the water.

First, I should probably calculate the power supplied by the resistor. Power is current squared multiplied by voltage, right? Oh wait, power (P) is I² * V. Oh wait, but voltage is given as 1.00 bar. Hmm, but wait, the units. Power is in watts, which is J/s. So I need to make sure all units are consistent.

Wait the units for the resistor's resistance is ohms, and the current is in amperes. So V = I * R. Let me calculate the voltage first.

So I is 1.75 A, R is 25 ohms. So V = 1.75 * 25 = 43.75 V. Oh wait, but wait, 1 bar is a pressure, but for resistors, the voltage is in volts (V), right? So the voltage here is 43.75 V.

Wait, but the immersion heater is at a constant pressure of 1.00 bar. Oh wait, does that mean the pressure is constant? Or is the pressure referring to the surrounding pressure? Because when you have an immersion heater, the pressure is maintained, but the water is heated. Or perhaps the pressure is atmospheric, but I'm not sure. Hmm, the problem might just be using 1.00 bar as just the pressure of the water being heated, which is 101.325 kPa. But since the question says "constant pressure of 1.00 bar," maybe I can ignore that part, or perhaps it's just for context. Wait, maybe that's a red herring, and the 1.00 bar is just the pressure of the system, which probably is the water's pressure. So perhaps it's the pressure of the water. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me proceed.

So the power P is I² * R. So (1.75 A)^2 * 25 ohms.

1.75 squared is 3.0625. 3.0625 *25 is 76.5625 watts. So P is 76.5625 W. Wait, wait, because 1.75 squared is actually (1.75)^2 = 3.0625. 3.0625 * 25 = 76.5625. So yes, 76.5625 watts.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1.75 * 1.75 is 3.0625, yes. So 3.0625 *25 is 76.5625? Wait, 25 times 3 is 75, 0.0625 times 25 is 1.5625, so total 76.5625 W. So that's about 76.56 W.

So the power is 76.56 J/s.

Now, the time is 100 seconds. So the energy provided is power * time. So 76.56 J/s * 100s = 7656 J.

Wait, 76.56 * 100 is 7656 J. So that's 7656 joules.

Now, this energy goes into heating the water. The specific heat capacity of water is c = 4.184 J/(g·K). The mass is 82.5 grams.

The heat Q needed to raise the temperature is Q = m * c * ΔT.

We can solve for ΔT: ΔT = Q/(m*c).

So plugging the numbers: 7656 J / (82.5 g * 4.184 J/(g·K) )

Calculate denominator: 82.5 *4.184 = Let me compute that.

82.5 *4 is 330, 82.5 *0.184 is 15.24, so 330 +15.24 = 345.24. So 345.24 J/K.

So Q=7656 J, m*c=345.24 J/K.

ΔT = 7656 / 345.24 → Let me compute that. Hmm.

Well, 345.24 * 22 = let me compute 345 *22. 300*22=6600, 45*22=990 → 7590. 345.24*22 is 7590 + 0.24*22=5.28 → 7595.28.

Wait, but 7656 is higher than 7595.28. So 22 would give 7595.28, and 7656 is about 60.72 more.

So how much more? 60.72 /345.24 ≈ 0.1756. So about 22.1756 K.

So ΔT ≈ 22.18 K.

Adding that to initial temperature: 300 K +22.18=322.18 K, approximately 322.2 K.

Looking at the options, option A is 322 K. So that's our answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I account for the pressure correctly? The question says the immersion heater is at a constant pressure of 1.00 bar. Does that affect the calculation? Because the pressure of the water is 1.00 bar, but the power calculation is based on the resistor's voltage. So the heater's power is I² R, which is 76.56 W, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure is a red herring because the problem is more about the power from the resistor, which is 76.56 W. So the calculation should be right.
</think>

To determine the final temperature of the water, we calculate the energy provided by the immersion heater and use it to heat the water. The power supplied by the resistor is given by:

\[
P = I^2 R
\]

Substituting \(I = 1.75 \, \text{A}\) and \(R = 25.0 \, \Omega\):

\[
P = (1.75)^2 \cdot 25 = 76.56 \, \text{W}
\]

The energy provided over 100 seconds is:

\[
Q = P \cdot t = 76.56 \, \text{W} \cdot 100 \, \text{s} = 7656 \, \text{J}
\]

The heat required to raise the temperature of the water is given by:

\[
Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T
\]

Rearranging for \(\Delta T\):

\[
\Delta T = \frac{Q}{m \cdot c}
\]

The mass of water is \(82.5 \, \text{g}\), the specific heat capacity of water is \(c = 4.184 \, \text{J/(g·K)}\), and \(m \cdot c = 82.5 \cdot 4.184 = 345.24 \, \text{J/K}\). Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta T = \frac{7656}{345.24} \approx 22.18 \, \text{K}
\]

Adding this temperature increase to the initial temperature of \(300 \, \text{K}\):

\[
T_{\text{final}} = 300 + 22.18 \approx 322.2 \, \text{K}
\]

From the options provided, the closest match is **322 K** (Option A).
