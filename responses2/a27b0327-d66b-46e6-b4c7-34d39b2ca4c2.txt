Okay, so I have this question about CPA fraud and liability. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about when a CPA who fraudulently issues an unqualified opinion on a corporation's financial statements would be liable to certain parties. The options are corporate shareholders and corporate bondholders. The question gives four answer options: A to J, but the correct answer is one of them.

Alright, I remember that when a CPA issues an unqualified opinion, it's generally considered that opinion is not binding unless there's some evidence that the CPA knew about the fraud or that the opinion actually misstates the financials. But wait, what determines the liability?

I think the concept is about whether the CPA's opinion is binding. An unqualified opinion isn't automatically binding, but if there's proof that the CPA knew about the fraud or that the opinion was misstated, then the opinion becomes binding. This is usually the case if there's evidence of a material misstatement or if the CPA had knowledge of the fraud.

Now, if the CPA is found to have known about the fraudulent activity, then the opinion would be binding. In that case, the CPA would be liable to both the shareholders and bondholders because the opinion is now a true reflection of the financials, which the shareholders and bondholders rely on for their decisions. So both parties would be liable.

But wait, the question says the CPA fraudulently issues an unqualified opinion, so maybe there's some assumption that the CPA didn't know. However, if the opinion is found to be misstated or if the CPA is found to have knowledge, then it becomes binding. But if the CPA is found to have no knowledge, then the opinion is not binding, and thus the CPA would not be liable to either party.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "will a CPA be liable if the CPA fraudulently issues..." So the condition is that the CPA's actions are fraudulent. So we need to think about the law regarding the CPA's liability.

I recall that the primary rule here is that an opinion is unqualified and not binding unless there's evidence that the CPA had knowledge of the fraud or that there was a material misstatement in the financial statements. So if the CPA is found guilty of fraud, then the opinion is deemed to be a true statement because the CPA is believed to know the facts.

So, in this case, the CPA is found to have fraudulently issued the opinion. That would mean that the opinion is deemed to be true, and the CPA is liable to all parties for the misstatement, because the opinion is no longer unqualified. Therefore, both shareholders and bondholders would be liable.

Looking at the options:

Option D says "Yes Yes." That would be correct if the CPA is found guilty of fraud, and the opinion is deemed to be true because the CPA is believed to know about the fraud.

Option E says "No Yes." That's the opposite. If the CPA is found not guilty, then the opinion isn't binding.

Other options: 

- A: No No. But the question is about liability, so that doesn't make sense.
- B: To both parties if CPA had knowledge. But if the CPA is found guilty, it's about liability regardless of whether the CPA knew, but the question says the CPA fraudulently issued it.
- C: Only bondholders if they can prove reliance. I don't think so. The issue here is whether the CPA is liable to the shareholders or bondholders, not just the bondholders.
- F: To neither unless they can prove reliance and loss. I don't think so, because the CPA's unethical behavior would lead to liability, whether or not they prove reliance or loss.
- G: Yes No. That would be if the CPA was found not guilty, and the opinion is unqualified. So the CPA isn't liable, and if the CPA is found guilty, then the opinion is deemed true, so both are liable.
- H: Only to shareholders if they prove reliance. Hmm, perhaps if there's a reliance, but I don't think so. The issue is whether the opinion is true, not just reliance.
- I: To both if they can prove a contractual relationship. That's more about contract law, not here.
- J: To both unless they can prove loss. Wait, if the CPA is found guilty, the opinion is deemed true. So the CPA is liable regardless of whether the CPA proves loss or not. So J says "unless they can prove financial loss," but if loss is not proven, they're still liable because the opinion is deemed true.

Wait, let me clarify. The key is whether the CPA's actions (fraudulent issuing the opinion) make the opinion true. If the CPA is found guilty of fraud, then the opinion is deemed true, so the CPA is liable to all parties. So in that case, both shareholders and bondholders are liable (yes to both).

So if the CPA is found guilty, then both are liable. So which option says that? Let's look at option D: "Yes Yes." That would be correct.

Other options: Option G is "Yes No," which would be if the CPA is found not guilty, and the opinion isn't binding because the CPA didn't know. So the opinion isn't true, hence no liability. But in this question, the CPA did fraudulently issue the opinion, implying guilt.

So the correct answer would be option D: Yes Yes.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: D: Yes Yes**

**Explanation:**
When a CPA fraudulently issues an unqualified opinion on a corporation's financial statements, the CPA's unethical behavior makes the opinion deemed true if found guilty of fraud. This results in the CPA being liable to both corporate shareholders and corporate bondholders, as their reliance on the financial statements is affected. Therefore, the CPA is liable to both parties.
