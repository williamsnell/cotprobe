Okay, so I have this transformer question and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says there's a 5-kVA transformer supplying a lighting load. Normally, it operates at full load for 1% of the time and half load for 1.5 hours. But during the rest of the day, there's no load. The iron loss is 200 watts, and the full-load copper loss is 200 watts. I need to find the all-day efficiency.

Hmm, so all-day efficiency means the average efficiency over the entire day. I remember that efficiency is related to the power output divided by the power input. But since there's varying loads, I need to account for both full load and half load periods.

Wait, the transformer has an iron loss that's constant, right? So the total loss each day would be iron loss plus copper loss. Let me outline the steps.

First, calculate the total power input. The transformer's total power is the sum of the full load and half load powers. But wait, the transformer's capacity is 5 kVA, which is the apparent voltage times current. But I don't have the actual current or voltage. Oh, but maybe I don't need them because the losses are given.

Wait, the full-load copper loss is 200 W. So the full load copper loss is I^2 R = 200 W. The full load current can be found using I = V/R, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the full load current based on the copper loss.

But maybe I don't need the actual current because losses are given. Let me think. The full load copper loss is 200 W, which is I^2 R. But I don't know R or I. Hmm, maybe I can find the current from the copper loss.

Wait, the transformer's full load copper loss is 200 W. So I^2 R = 200. But I don't know R or I. Hmm, perhaps I can find the full load current because the total apparent power is 5 kVA.

Wait, the full load copper loss is 200 W, and the full load power (apparent power) is P = V I. But without knowing V or I, I might need another approach. Alternatively, maybe the full load copper loss can be used to find the current when the transformer is at full load.

Wait, full load copper loss is 200 W. Assuming that the full load current is I, then I^2 R = 200. But I don't know R. Alternatively, maybe the full load current can be determined from the copper loss. Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Let me think about the problem differently. The transformer's power output is normally at full load, but during the rest of the day it's off. So the only time it's supplying power is when it's running at full or half load.

Wait, the question says during normal day's run, it's full load for 1% hours and half load for 1.5 hours. But then no load on the rest of the day. So the transformer is on for 2.5% of the day (1% + 1.5%).

But perhaps the time is being considered in hours, so for every hour, the transformer is on for 2.5% of the time. Hmm, but more accurately, it's on for 1% of the day and off for 98.5%, but no, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Wait, let me read again.

"The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen. The question says, during the rest of the day, there would be no load. The rest of the day is 98.5% of the day, I think. So the transformer is on for 1% of the day, and off for 98.5%."

But perhaps the time is not in hours but in terms of the day's duration, but the question is about all-day efficiency, which is the average over the entire day.

So the average power is (power during full load time) + (power during half load time). Since the transformer is on for 1% of the day at full load, and 1.5% at half load, and off the rest.

Wait, perhaps the time periods are in hours. So 1% of 24 hours is 0.24 hours, and 1.5% is 0.36 hours. So total on time is 0.6 hours, and off time is 18 hours. So the average power is (P1*0.24 + P2 *0.36)/0.6.

Wait, but first I need to calculate the apparent power at full load and half load.

Wait, the transformer's total apparent power is 5 kVA. So when it's at full load, the current is I_fl. Similarly, at half load, the current is I_hl = I_fl / 2.

Wait, because power is V I. At full load, P = V I_fl =5 kVA. Half load would be P/2 = 2.5 kVA. So the current is I_fl = (5)/(V), and I_hl = (2.5)/(V) = I_fl / 2.

So the power output (P_out) during full load is 5 kVA. During half load, it's 2.5 kVA.

But wait, the question is about the efficiency, which depends on the input power minus losses. So the input power is the apparent voltage times the current (I^2 R + V^2/R). Wait no, input power is V^2 / R (copper losses plus iron losses).

Wait, the total losses are the sum of copper losses and iron losses. So the input power is (I^2 R + V^2 / R) = (V^2 / R) [since I^2 R is copper and V^2/R is the same as I^2 R (since I= V/R)].

Wait, let me compute the input power. Let's denote:

I = current at full load.

I_fl = I

P_fl = V I_fl = 5 kVA.

So V = 5e3 V (since 5 kVA = 5000 V * I, so I = 5000 / V. Wait, but without V, maybe I can express in terms of I.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the copper loss. Copper loss is I^2 R = 200 W.

So R is the resistance of the transformer's windings.

But also, P_fl = V I = 5e3 V * I = 5e3 * (5000 / V) = 25e6 / V^2 ? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, V I = 5e3 V * I = 5e3 * I (since V is in volts and I in amps, product is watts). So P_fl = V I = 5e3 V * I = 5e3 * (5000 / V) ) ? Wait, that would be 5e3 * (V^{-1} *5e3) ) = 5000 *5000 / V. That can't be right because that would give V in the denominator, which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think in terms of power.

At full load, the apparent power is 5 kVA. So V * I_fl =5e3 * I_fl =5e3 * I_fl = 5000 * I_fl =5,000 * I_fl (since 5kVA =5000 V * I_A). So I_fl = 5e3 V / V =5000 A? That can't be right because that would mean I=5000A at 5 kVA, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me re-express:

5 kVA =5000 V * I (where I is in amps). So I =5000 V / V =5000 / V. Wait, no. Wait, V is the voltage, and I is current. So 5kVA is 5000 V * I_A =5e3 V * I_A. So I_A =5e3 / V. That doesn't seem right either. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the load.

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think about the iron loss and copper loss.

Iron loss is 200 W. Full load copper loss is 200 W. So, the full load copper loss (I^2 R) is 200 W.

So at full load, the current is I_fl = sqrt(200/R). But without R, I can't find I.

Wait, but perhaps the full load current can be found from the transformer's apparent power. Because P = V I, and at full load, P=5kVA. But without knowing V, I can't find I. Maybe the voltage is the same as the rated voltage. Wait, but the question doesn't specify, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformer's copper loss is 200 W at full load, so I^2 R =200.

But then, the apparent power at full load is V * I_fl =5000 V * I_fl.

But I don't know V. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find the copper loss in terms of the full load current.

Wait, because at full load, the current is I_fl. So I^2 R = (I_fl)^2 R =200 W.

And the full power is P = V I_fl =5000 V * I_fl.

But without V, I can't find I_fl. So maybe I can express in terms of the copper loss.

Wait, let's see. Let me denote:

I_fl = current at full load.

P_fl = V * I_fl =5,000 V * I_fl =5,000 I_fl (since P is in watts).

But at full load, the copper loss is I_fl^2 R = 200 W.

So, I can express R as 200 / (I_fl^2).

But I also have P_fl =5,000 * I_fl = V * I_fl. So V = P_fl / I_fl =5,000 I_fl / I_fl = 5,000 V? That can't be right. Wait, that would imply V =5,000 V, which is impossible as that would make P_fl =5,000 *5,000 =25e6 W, which is 25 megawatts, way more than the 5kVA stated.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me try again.

Wait, 5 kVA = 5,000 V * I_fl.

So I_fl = (5,000 V) / V.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 5,000 V * I_fl =5,000 * I_fl. So that's 5,000 I_fl =5,000 V * I_fl, which implies that V =5,000 V. That would mean the voltage is 5,000 volts, which is impractical for a transformer.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach.

Maybe I can find the apparent power at full load and half load.

Wait, the full load copper loss is 200 W. So, I^2 R =200.

At half load, the current is I_hl = I_fl / 2. So the copper loss is (I_hl)^2 R = (I_fl^2 /4) R = (I^2 R)/4 =200 /4=50 W.

So, at half load, the copper loss is 50 W.

But the full load copper loss is 200 W, and at half load, it's 50 W.

So, the full load copper loss is 4 times the half load.

Now, the question says that the transformer operates at full load for 1% of the time and half load for 1.5% of the time. So the time is in hours.

Wait, but the time isn't given in the question. The problem states that it's full load 1% of the time, half load 1.5% of the time, and no load the rest of the time. The question is about the all-day efficiency.

But since the time isn't specified, perhaps the problem is considering that the time is 2.5% of the day (1% +1.5%), but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the question is that during the rest of the day (which is 97.5% of the day), the transformer is off, so no losses. So the average power is (P_full * 1% + P_half *1.5%) / (1% + 1.5%).

Wait, but the question gives the time as 1% hours and 1.5% hours. So perhaps the total time is 2.5% of the day.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the total hours of operation per day, so perhaps the time is considered as a portion of the day, but I have to think in terms of the time.

Wait, perhaps the time is in hours, so the transformer is on for 1% of the day, which is 0.01 * 24 = 0.24 hours, and off for the rest of the time, which is 2.56 hours. But perhaps that's not necessary.

But maybe I can proceed without the time, because the time cancels out.

Wait, because efficiency is (P_out / P_in) *100. Since P_out is the sum of the power during full and half load.

But let's find P_out. The power during full load is P_fl =5,000 V * I_fl. But I don't know V. But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the apparent power at full load is S_fl = V * I_fl, and at half load S_hl = V * I_hl = V * (I_fl/2) = S_fl /2.

So P_out = S_fl * (1% + 1.5%) = S_fl *2.5%.

So P_out = 2.5% of S_fl.

But what is S_fl? It's 5 kVA, so 5,000 W.

So P_out = 2.5% *5,000 =125 W.

Wait, but that can’t be right because the iron and copper losses are in the same units, but wait, 125 W is the output, and the copper loss is 200 W, which is higher. That can't be right because copper loss is more than the output.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Because the full load copper loss is 200 W, and the apparent power is 5,000 W. So the copper loss is 200 W, which is 4% of the output (200/5,000=0.04). So the efficiency at full load is (5000-200)/5000 = 4800/5000=0.96=96% efficiency.

But that's the efficiency during full load. But the question is about all-day efficiency, which is the average.

Wait, but the transformer is on for 1% of the time at 96% efficiency, and 1.5% at a lower efficiency.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me outline the steps again.

All-day efficiency is (Total output power) / (Total input power) *100%.

Total output power is the time the transformer is on multiplied by the power at that time.

So, the transformer is on for 1% of the time, which is 0.01 *24=0.24 hours. At full load, the power is P_fl=5kVA. So output power during full load is 5kVA *0.01=50 W.

And for 1.5% of the time (0.015 *24=0.36 hours), the output power is 5kVA *0.015=75 W.

So total output power is 50+75=125 W.

Now, what's the total input power?

The input power is the apparent voltage multiplied by the current. But given that the full load copper loss is 200 W, and P_fl =5kVA.

Wait, the copper loss is I^2 R =200 W.

At full load, P_fl=5,000 V * I_fl =5,000 I_fl =5kW.

But wait, that's 5,000 W. But the copper loss is 200 W, which means 200 W is the I^2 R.

So, I^2 R =200.

But I_fl^2 R =200 W.

So, I_fl = current at full load.

Wait, perhaps I can find the copper loss in terms of the full load current.

Wait, the full load copper loss is 200 W, so I_fl^2 R =200.

So R =200/(I_fl^2).

But the apparent power at full load is P =5kVA =5,000 V * I_fl.

So, V =5,000 I_fl /5,000 = I_fl.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would make V=I_fl, and then the apparent power would be 5,000 * I_fl.

But that seems off. Wait, no, the apparent power is 5,000 V * I_fl, which equals 5kVA.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the full load current.

Wait, if I_fl is the current at full load, then P_fl = V * I_fl =5kVA.

But R is 200 W / I_fl^2.

So, the apparent power is 5kVA, but the copper loss is 200 W.

Wait, but then the apparent power at full load is 5kVA, which is V * I_fl =5e3 * I_fl =5e3 I.

But I don't know I or V.

Wait, perhaps I can find the copper loss in terms of the full load power.

Wait, the full load power is 5kVA, and the copper loss is 200 W. So, the ratio is 200/5000=0.04, which is 4% of the full load power.

So, the efficiency at full load is (5kVA -200W)/5kVA = (5000 -0.2) /5000 = 0.9996=99.96% efficiency.

But that's the efficiency when the transformer is running at full load, but when the transformer is off, it's not consuming any power.

So, the transformer is on for 1% of the time (0.01 days =0.24 hours), at 99.96% efficiency, so the output during full load is 5kVA *0.01=50 W.

And for 1.5% of the time (0.015 days=0.36 hours), at half load, the output is 5kVA *0.015=75 W.

So, the total output is 50+75=125 W.

Now, the total input power is the apparent voltage multiplied by the current, which is V * I.

But I don't know V. However, since the full load copper loss is 200 W, and P_fl is 5kVA, perhaps I can find V.

Wait, P_fl is 5kVA = V * I_fl.

But I_fl is 5000 I / V, from the first equation.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let me think in terms of the apparent power.

At full load, P_fl is 5kVA. Since the transformer is on for 1% of the time, the output during that time is 5kVA *1%=50 W.

But the input power is V * I, which is 5kVA *1% =50 W (only if V is 5kV, which is unrealistic). So that can't be right.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

The transformer's apparent power is 5kVA. At full load, the current is I_fl, and the power is V * I_fl =5kVA. So V=5kVA / I_fl.

At full load, the copper loss is I_fl^2 R =200 W.

But I don't know R or I_fl.

Wait, but at full load, the apparent power is V * I_fl =5kVA.

So, V =5e3 V.

Wait, that can't be right because then I_fl would be 1 A, making V=5e3 V. So, 5kVA is indeed correct.

But then, if the transformer is on for 1% of the day, the output during that time is 5kVA *0.01=0.05kW=50 W.

But the input power during that time is V * I_fl =5e3 V *1 A=5e3 V. But that's 5e3 *5e3 W? No, that can't be right.

Wait, I'm confused again. Let me think in terms of the losses.

The full load copper loss is 200 W. So, the current at full load is I_fl = sqrt(200 R).

But I also know that P_fl=V I_fl=5e3 V * I_fl =5e3, so V =5e3 / I_fl.

But that still doesn't help me find I_fl.

Wait, perhaps I can find the copper loss in terms of the apparent power.

At full load, P_fl=5e3 V * I_fl=5e3.

The copper loss is I_fl^2 R =200.

So, R=200 / I_fl^2.

But I also know that V=5e3 / I_fl.

So, substituting into R:

R=200 / ( (5e3 / I_fl)^2 )

=200 / (25e6 / I_fl^2 )

=200 * I_fl^2 / 25e6

= (200 / 25e6) * I_fl^2

= (8e-6) * I_fl^2.

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Wait, maybe I can find I_fl^2 R =200, and V I_fl =5e3.

So, I can write I_fl =5e3 / V.

Substituting into I_fl^2 R =200:

(5e3)^2 / V^2 * R =200.

So, R= (200 V^2) / ( (5e3)^2 )

But R is also V^2 / I^2 = V^2 / (I_fl^2).

So,

V^2 / I_fl^2 = (200 V^2) / (25e6) )

Divide both sides by V^2:

1 / I_fl^2 = 200 / (25e6 )

So,

I_fl^2 =25e6 / 200 =125e3.

So, I_fl =sqrt(125e3)= sqrt(1.25e5)= approximately 353.55 A.

Wait, that seems very high for a transformer. But let's proceed.

So, I_fl =353.55 A.

Then, the copper loss is I_fl^2 R =200 W.

So, R=200 / (I_fl^2 )=200 / ( (353.55)^2 )=200 / 125000=0.0016 ohms.

Wait, that's a very low resistance. That seems correct.

Now, I can compute the apparent power at full load: V I_fl =5e3 V * 353.55 A =5e3 *353.55=1.76775e6 W, which is 1,767.75 MW. That's way too high for a transformer.

Wait, that can't be right. The apparent power at full load can't be that high. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Let me re-examine the calculation of I_fl.

I had:

I_fl^2 =25e6 /200 = 125e3.

So, I_fl = sqrt(125e3) = sqrt(125 *1e3 )= sqrt(125) * sqrt(1e3 )= approx 11.18 * 31.62= approx 353.55 A.

Wait, that's correct.

But then, V=5e3 V / I_fl =5e3 /353.55 ≈14.14 V.

Wait, that's very low. So, the apparent voltage would be 14.14 V, and the current is 353.55 A, making the power 5e3 V *353.55 A=1.76775e6 W, which is 1,767.75 MW. That's impossible because power can't exceed the product of voltage and current at 100% efficiency.

So, there must be a mistake in the assumption.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the full load current as I_fl, and the apparent power is 5kVA, which is V * I_fl.

But I have V =5e3 / I_fl.

Then, I can plug into the copper loss equation.

The copper loss is I_fl^2 R =200 W.

But I also have R = (V^2) / I_fl^2.

Wait, so R = ( (5e3 / I_fl )^2 ) / I_fl^2 )= (25e6 / I_fl^2 ) / I_fl^2 )=25e6 / I_fl^4.

But then, I_fl^2 R =200 W.

Substituting R:

I_fl^2 * (25e6 / I_fl^4 ) )=200.

Simplify:

25e6 / I_fl^2 =200.

So, I_fl^2 =25e6 /200=125e3.

So, I_fl= sqrt(125e3)= approx 353.55 A.

Which brings us back to the same problem.

So, that suggests that there must be a mistake in the problem statement, because the numbers don't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the copper loss is I^2 R, which is 200 W.

So, I^2 R =200.

But I also have P_fl =V I=5e3 V * I=5e3.

So, V=5e3 I /5e3= I.

Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the copper loss in terms of the apparent power.

Wait, copper loss is I^2 R.

But I=V/R.

So, I^2 R= ( V^2 / R^2 ) R= V^2 / R.

So, V^2 / R =200 W.

But then, V= sqrt(200 R).

But I don't know R.

Wait, perhaps I can find R.

Wait, if I can express R in terms of the copper loss.

Wait, if I=353.55 A, then R=200 / (353.55)^2=200 /125000=0.0016 ohms.

So, R=0.0016 ohms.

Then, the apparent voltage V= sqrt(P * R) = sqrt(5e3 *0.0016 )=sqrt(8)=2.828 volts.

So, V=2.828 V.

But then, I=V/R=2.828 /0.0016=1767 A.

Wait, that's the current. But that's way higher than the full load current.

Wait, but earlier I calculated I_fl as 353.55 A, which is half of 707 A.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me try again.

If copper loss is 200 W, and I^2 R=200, then I= sqrt(200 / R).

But I also have I_fl^2 R=200.

Wait, but that doesn't help me find R.

Wait, perhaps I should find the copper loss in terms of the power.

Wait, copper loss is I^2 R.

But the power is P = V I.

So, I = P/(V).

Substituting into the copper loss equation:

I^2 R = (P^2)/(V^2) R.

But I don't know V or P.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the apparent voltage is 5000 V, and the current is 1 A, but that doesn't fit the numbers.

Wait, perhaps the transformer is on for 1% of the time, so the output is 5e3 * 0.01 =50 W.

But the copper loss is 200 W, so the apparent voltage is 5e3 V, and the current is 5e3 V / R.

Wait, but I don't know R.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the transformer is on for 1% of the time, so the output is 5e3 *0.01=50 W.

But the copper loss is 200 W, which is the power lost in the transformer. So, the total power input is 50 + 200 =250 W.

So, the efficiency is (50)/(250) *100%=20%.

Wait, but that's a much lower efficiency than the copper losses suggest.

Hmm, but perhaps that's the case.

Wait, let me think again.

If the transformer is on for 1% of the time, the output is 5e3 *0.01=50 W.

The copper loss is 200 W, so the apparent voltage is 200 V (assuming 100% efficiency).

So, the apparent voltage is 200 V, current is 200 A.

So, the copper loss would be I^2 R = (200)^2 R=40,000 R=200 W.

So, R=200/40,000=0.005 ohms.

Then, the apparent power is V I=200 *200=40,000 W, which is 40,000 W, which is much higher than the 5e3 W (5,000 W) that the transformer is rated for.

So, this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the copper loss is 200 W, so the apparent voltage is such that I^2 R=200.

But the transformer is on for 1% of the time, so the output is 5e3 *0.01=50 W.

So, the efficiency is (50)/(200 +200) *100% =50/(400)*100% =12.5%.

Wait, that's because the copper loss is 200 W, and the transformer is on for 1% of the time, so the output is 50 W.

But then, the efficiency is (50)/(200 +200) *100% =50/400 *100% =12.5%.

Hmm, that seems more plausible.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformer is on for 1% of the time, so the output is 5e3 *0.01=50 W.

The copper loss is 200 W, so the total input power is 50 +200=250 W.

So, the efficiency is (50)/(250)*100% =20%.

Wait, but earlier I thought the efficiency would be 96%, but that's when the transformer is on for 1% of the time.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

So, the transformer is on for 1% of the day, which is 0.01 *24=0.24 hours.

At full load, the apparent power is 5kVA, and the transformer is on for 1% of the time, so the output power is 5kVA *0.01=50 W.

At 1% of the time, the transformer is running at full load, so the current is I_fl.

But the copper loss during full load is 200 W, so the apparent voltage during full load is V = P / I_fl =5e3 V / I_fl.

But copper loss is I_fl^2 R =200 W.

So, R =200 / I_fl^2.

But at the same time, V =5e3 V / I_fl.

So, V =5e3 / I_fl.

So, R =200 / ( (5e3 / I_fl )^2 ) =200 / (25e6 / I_fl^2 )= (200 I_fl^2 ) / 25e6.

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Wait, maybe I can find I_fl.

In the transformer, the full load copper loss is 200 W, which equals I_fl^2 R.

But R is the resistance of the transformer, which is related to the voltage and current.

Wait, R = V / I.

So, R = V / I.

But V =5e3 V.

Wait, no, that's not correct because I'm considering the full load current.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation.

So, the transformer is on for 1% of the time, so the output is 5e3 *0.01=50 W.

The copper loss is 200 W, so the total input is 50 +200=250 W.

So, the efficiency is (50)/(250) *100% =20%.

That seems more reasonable.

So, the answer is 20% efficiency.

But wait, why 20% and not 96%?

Because when the transformer is on for 1% of the time, the output is 50 W, and the copper loss is 200 W, so the efficiency is 20%.

But when the transformer is on for 100% of the time, the output is 5kVA, and the copper loss is 200 W, so the efficiency is (5kVA -200 W) /5kVA *100% = (4,998,000 -200)/4,998,000 *100% ≈99.96%.

Which makes sense.

So, the efficiency varies depending on how much of the time the transformer is on.

So, in this problem, since the transformer is on for 1% of the time, the efficiency is 20%.
</think>

The transformer is on for 1% of the time, so the output power during this period is 5kVA multiplied by 1%, which equals 50 W. The copper loss during full load is 200 W. Therefore, the total input power is the sum of the output power and the copper loss, which is 50 W + 200 W = 250 W. The efficiency is the output power divided by the input power, which is (50 W) / (250 W) = 0.2, or 20%.

ANSWER: 20%
