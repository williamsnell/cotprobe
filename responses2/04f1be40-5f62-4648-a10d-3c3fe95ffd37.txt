Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about finding the molecular weight of a hydrogen-air mixture. The data given includes the composition of air, the volume and temperature of the flask, and the amount of hydrogen added. Hmm.

First, I'll jot down the given data to keep things straight. Air is approximately 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen by moles. So, the mole fraction of nitrogen is 0.8 and oxygen is 0.2. The total moles of air are, I guess, 1 mole? Or wait, no, because that's just their mole fractions. Oh wait, no, the mole fraction is the ratio of each component's moles to the total. So if nitrogen is 80% and oxygen 20%, then the mole fraction of air (as a whole) is 1.0 (since 0.8 + 0.2 = 1.0). So, each mole of air is 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen.

The flask's volume is 22.4 liters at 0°C and initial pressure is 1 atm. I remember that at standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters. But wait, here the temperature is 0°C, which is 273.15 K, and pressure is 1 atm. Oh wait, but 22.4 liters at 0°C and 1 atm is exactly STP? No, wait, STP is 273.15 K and 1 atm. So 22.4 L at 0°C and 1 atm is not STP. So I can't use the ideal gas law directly here because the volume and temp don't match STP. Oh wait, but wait, wait, the flask is maintained at 0°C and initially filled with air at 1 atm. So the initial moles of air in the flask (before adding hydrogen) can be calculated using the ideal gas law.

Wait, but let's think about the initial moles of each gas before hydrogen is added. The flask has a volume of 22.4 L at 0°C (273 K) and 1 atm. So applying the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. P is 1 atm, V is 22.4 L, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T is 273 K.

So, n = PV/(RT) = (1 atm)(22.4 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 273 K). Let me calculate that.

Calculating numerator: 1 * 22.4 = 22.4 L·atm.
Denominator: 0.0821 * 273 ≈ 22.4733 L·atm/mol.
So n = 22.4 / 22.4733 ≈ approximately 0.998 moles. Well, that's almost 1 mole. So the initial moles of air are about 1 mole.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait another thing. The problem says "a 22.4-liter flask maintained at 0°C and initially filled with air at 1atm pressure." So n_initial = (1 atm * 22.4 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 273 K) → which is approximately 1 mole. So yeah, n_initial = approximately 1 mole.

So, the mole count of each gas in the initial state is 0.8 for N2 and 0.2 for O2. So the initial moles are 0.8 moles N2 and 0.2 moles O2. Then, when we add 4.0 grams of hydrogen, what's the new mole count?

Wait, hydrogen is H2. So its molar mass is 2 g/mol. So 4.0 g of H2 is 4.0 / 2 = 2.0 moles. So adding 2 moles of H2 to the mixture.

So now, the total moles of the mixture would be the initial moles plus 2.

But wait, the initial moles of air were 1 mole. So adding 2 moles of H2 gives a total of 3 moles of gas (0.8 N2, 0.2 O2, 2 H2).

Wait, but wait. Are all these gases behaving ideally? The problem doesn't specify, but I think for this problem, we can assume ideal behavior because it's a standard problem setup. So yes, we can proceed with the ideal gas law.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the situation before adding H2. The initial moles of each gas in the flask are 0.8 and 0.2, based on the air composition. So the initial amount is 1 mole.

But when we add H2, the moles of each gas change. So, after adding, the total moles are 0.8 + 0.2 + 2 = 3 moles.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should double-check that. So initial moles of N2 is 0.8, O2 is 0.2, and H2 is 2. So total moles is 0.8 + 0.2 + 2 = 3 moles.

So the total moles in the flask after adding hydrogen is 3 moles.

But wait, wait: the flask was initially filled with air, which is 0.8 N2 and 0.2 O2. Then, 4g H2 is added. So 4g H2 is 2 moles (since H2 is 2g/mol). So adding 2 moles H2: so the total moles become 1 mole (initial) + 2 = 3.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the mole fractions again. Because the mixture after adding H2 would have a different mole fraction. But the question is about the molecular weight of the hydrogen-air mixture. Wait, no. The question is about the molecular weight of the hydrogen-air mixture. Wait, wait, no: the hydrogen is being added to the air, so the mixture is more hydrogen than the original air. But the question is about the molecular weight of the mixture as a whole. Or wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

The question is: What will be the molecular weight of the hydrogen-air mixture? Oh, wait, no, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the hydrogen is added to the air, so the mixture is a combination. So the hydrogen is part of the mixture. So the mixture is H2 and the air. But the question is about the "molecular weight of the hydrogen-air mixture". Wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps it's asking for the molecular weight of the hydrogen as part of the mixture, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the molecular weight of the hydrogen added to the air. But that can't be because the molecular weight of hydrogen is 2 g/mol, and the question's options don't include that.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps the problem is that the hydrogen is a gas added to the air, so the mixture is hydrogen and the air. But the question is about the molecular weight of the hydrogen-air mixture. Wait, no, perhaps it's being asked for the average molecular weight of the mixture, which includes both the hydrogen and the air's molecules. But that's unusual because usually, the average molecular weight of a gas mixture is calculated as the sum of the mole fractions multiplied by the molar masses of each gas. But in this case, the hydrogen is a separate gas.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again.

The question is: "What will be the molecular weight (i.e., the average molecular weight) of the hydrogen-air mixture?" Hmm. So the mixture is a combination of hydrogen and the original air. But the original air's mole fractions are 80% N2 and 20% O2, so their molar masses are 28 and 32 respectively. But the hydrogen has a molar mass of 2 g/mol.

Wait, but the question says "molecular weight of the hydrogen-air mixture". Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the average molar mass of the hydrogen and the air mixture. In that case, the average molar mass would be the sum of (x1*M1 + x2*M2), where x1 and x2 are the mole fractions of hydrogen and the air, and M1 and M2 are their molar masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the molar mass of the hydrogen gas that's added. But then the options don't include 2, but option H is 18, which is perhaps another factor.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Alternative approach: The hydrogen is added to the air, so the mixture is hydrogen plus air. So the total moles would be the initial moles of air plus the moles of hydrogen.

But initially, the air is 1 mole. Then adding 4g H2, which is 2 moles. So total moles is 3 moles.

But the question is about the molecular weight of the hydrogen-air mixture. So perhaps the problem wants the average molar mass of the mixture, considering both gases.

Wait, but the molecular weight of the mixture would be (moles of H2 * molar mass H2) + (moles of N2 * molar mass N2) + (moles of O2 * molar mass O2) divided by total moles.

Wait, that's correct. Because the average molecular weight is the sum of (moles of each gas * molar mass) divided by total moles.

So in this case:

Moles of H2: 2 moles.

Molar mass of H2: 2 g/mol.

Moles of N2: 0.8 moles.

Molar mass of N2: 28 g/mol.

Moles of O2: 0.2 moles.

Molar mass of O2: 32 g/mol.

Total moles: 2 + 0.8 + 0.2 = 3.

So sum = (2 * 2) + (0.8 * 28) + (0.2 * 32) → let's calculate each term.

2 * 2 = 4.

0.8 *28 = 22.4.

0.2 *32=6.4.

Total sum =4 +22.4 +6.4=32.8 g.

Average molecular weight is 32.8 /3 = 10.933 g/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 26.6, option G is14.4, option H is18, I is 2, E is 22.4, J is10.9, etc. So 10.9 is option J.

Wait, but wait. But wait, the question is phrased as the hydrogen-air mixture. So perhaps the way I'm calculating is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is just about the molar mass of the hydrogen added to the air. But then that would be 2 g/mol, which is not among the options except option I.

Wait, no, the question is about the hydrogen-air mixture. So the mixture is made up of H2 and air (which is O2 and N2). So the average molecular weight is 32.8 g per 3 moles, which is approximately 10.9, which is option J.

Looking back at the options:

A: 36.0 → high.

B:4.0→ too low.

C:32.8→ perhaps?

D:28.8→ 28.8/3 =9.6, but 28.8 is the sum of the initial moles of N2 and O2. But perhaps that's the sum. No, because the sum of moles is 1, 32.8 is the average.

Wait, but why am I getting 32.8 as the average. Looking at the options, option C is 32.8, which is exactly what I got. So that's the answer?

Wait, but is the question asking for something else? Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "the molecular weight of the hydrogen-air mixture?"

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. The hydrogen is being added to the air. So the mixture is hydrogen and the air. But the air's composition is N2 and O2. So the mixture's average molecular weight is (n_H2*(2) + n_N2*(28) + n_O2*(32)) / (n_H2 + n_N2 + n_O2).

So, n_H2 is 2 moles, n_N2=0.8, n_O2=0.2. So:

Sum is (2 * 2) + (0.8 *28) + (0.2 *32) = 4 + 22.4 +6.4=32.8.

Total moles = 3.

32.8/3 = 10.933... which is approximately 10.9. So option J is 10.9, which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A:36.0

B:4.0

C:32.8

D:28.8

E:2.0

F:26.6

G:14.4

H:18.0

I:2.0

J:10.9

So the correct option is J, 10.9.

But why did I get 32.8 when I calculated the sum? Oh, wait no, 32.8 is the sum of the products. Wait, no, the average is 32.8 /3 = 10.933, which is approximately 10.9.

So the correct answer is J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because initially, the air is 80% N2 and 20% O2, which would have a molar mass of (0.8*28 + 0.2*32) = 22.4 +6.4 =28.8. So that's the initial sum. But when we add 2 moles of H2, the average increases because H2 is lighter. So the average increases from 28.8 to 32.8. So the average is indeed 32.8 /3 = 10.933.

So the correct answer should be option J:10.9 gm/mole.

But wait, let me think again. The problem statement says that the flask is filled with air at 1 atm, 22.4 L at 0°C. So the initial moles of air should be 1 mole.

Wait, but wait, 1 mole of any ideal gas at 273 K and 1 atm is 22.4 L. So yes, initial moles of air are 1 mole. So adding 2 moles of H2 gives 3 moles. So the average molecular weight is 32.8 /3 ≈10.93.

So the correct answer is J:10.9 gm/mole.

To determine the molecular weight (average molecular weight) of the hydrogen-air mixture, we analyze the composition and behavior of the gases involved:

1. **Initial Air Composition and Moles**: Air is approximately 80% nitrogen (N₂) and 20% oxygen (O₂) by mole fraction. Using the ideal gas law, the initial moles of air in the 22.4 L flask at 0°C (273 K) and 1 atm pressure are calculated as:

   \[
   n_{\text{air}} = \frac{PV}{RT} = \frac{(1 \, \text{atm})(22.4 \, \text{L})}{(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/mol·K})(273 \, \text{K})} \approx 1 \, \text{mole}.
   \]

   Thus, the initial moles of N₂ and O₂ are 0.8 moles and 0.2 moles, respectively.

2. **Hydrogen Addition**: 4.0 g of hydrogen (H₂) is added to the flask. The molar mass of H₂ is 2 g/mol, so the number of moles of H₂ is:

   \[
   n_{\text{H}_2} = \frac{4.0 \, \text{g}}{2 \, \text{g/mol}} = 2 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

3. **Total Moles in the Mixture**: After adding 2 moles of H₂, the total moles of gas in the mixture are:

   \[
   n_{\text{total}} = n_{\text{air}} + n_{\text{H}_2} = 1 \, \text{mole} + 2 \, \text{moles} = 3 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

4. **Molecular Weight of the Mixture**: The molecular weight of the hydrogen-air mixture is calculated as the weighted average of the molar masses of N₂, O₂, and H₂, based on their mole fractions in the mixture. The molar masses are:

   - N₂: 28 g/mol,
   - O₂: 32 g/mol,
   - H₂: 2 g/mol.

   The total sum of (moles × molar mass) for the mixture is:

   \[
   \text{Sum} = (0.8 \, \text{mol} \times 28 \, \text{g/mol}) + (0.2 \, \text{mol} \times 32 \, \text{g/mol}) + (2 \, \text{mol} \times 2 \, \text{g/mol}) = 22.4 \, \text{g} + 6.4 \, \text{g} + 4 \, \text{g} = 32.8 \, \text{g}.
   \]

   The average molecular weight of the mixture is then:

   \[
   \text{Average Molecular Weight} = \frac{\text{Sum}}{\text{Total Moles}} = \frac{32.8 \, \text{g}}{3 \, \text{mol}} \approx 10.93 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

5. **Answer Selection**: Among the given options, the closest match to the calculated average molecular weight of 10.93 g/mol is **10.9 g/mol**.
