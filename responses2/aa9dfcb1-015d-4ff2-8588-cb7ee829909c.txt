Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the molarity of a solution. Hmm, let me think. The question says it's a 40.0% solution of HCl with a density of 1.20 g/mL. And the options are all different molarity values. 

Wait, molarity is moles of solute per liter of solution, right? So I need to calculate that. But wait, the percentage here is by mass, isn't it? So 40.0% would mean that 40% by mass of the solution is HCl. But how do I find the molarity from that?

Oh, right, I remember that to find molarity, I need to know the moles of solute and the volume of the solution. But since the solution's density is given, I can find out the mass of the solution and then the volume. 

Let me break it down. First, I'll find the mass of the solution. Since density is mass/volume, I can rearrange it to find the volume. Let's say I take a volume of 1 liter, which is 1000 mL. Multiply that by 1.20 g/mL to get the mass of the solution. Wait, no, wait. Actually, for 1 liter (1000 mL), the mass would be 1000 mL * 1.20 g/mL = 1200 grams. Oh, but wait, the solution isn't 100% HCl. Only 40% is HCl. So the mass of HCl in 1200 grams solution is 40% of that. 

So, mass of HCl = 0.4 * 1200 g = 480 grams. 

Now, I need to find the number of moles of HCl. To do that, I have to find the molar mass of HCl. H is about 1.008 g/mol, Cl is around 35.45 g/mol. So adding them gives 36.458 g/mol. 

So moles of HCl = mass / molar mass = 480 g / 36.458 g/mol. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 480 divided by 36.458. Let me see, 36.458 * 13 is about 474 (13*36=468, 13*0.458=5.954, total 473.95). So 13 moles would be about 474 grams. So 480 is a bit more. Let me compute 480 /36.458. Let's see, 36.458 * 13.15 = ? Let's compute 36.458 *13 = 474, 0.15 *36.458 is about 5.47. So 474 +5.47= 479.47. That's very close to 480. So 13.15 would give about 479.47 g. So, 480 is 13.15 approximately. So, moles ≈13.15 mol.

Wait, but wait, the solution is 1 liter. So the molarity is moles per liter. So since I took 1 liter, the molarity is 13.15 M. Looking at the options, option I is 13.15 M. So the answer should be option I.

Wait, let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in the calculations? 

Step 1: Calculate the mass of the solution. 1000 mL * 1.20 g/mL = 1200 g. 

Step 2: Mass of HCl is 40% of 1200, which is 480 grams. 

Step 3: Molar mass of HCl: 1.008 (H) + 35.45 (Cl) = 36.458 g/mol.

Step 4: Moles = 480 / 36.458 ≈ 13.15 mol.

So molarity is 13.15 M. So option I is correct.

To determine the molarity of a 40.0% HCl solution with a density of 1.20 g/mL, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the mass of the solution**:  
   For 1 liter (1000 mL), the mass of the solution is:  
   \[
   \text{Mass} = 1000 \, \text{mL} \times 1.20 \, \text{g/mL} = 1200 \, \text{g}.
   \]

2. **Determine the mass of HCl in the solution**:  
   Since the solution is 40.0% HCl by mass, the mass of HCl is:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of HCl} = 0.40 \times 1200 \, \text{g} = 480 \, \text{g}.
   \]

3. **Calculate the molar mass of HCl**:  
   The molar mass of HCl is:  
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of HCl} = 1.008 \, \text{g/mol} + 35.45 \, \text{g/mol} = 36.458 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

4. **Find the number of moles of HCl**:  
   Using the formula \( \text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} \):  
   \[
   \text{Moles of HCl} = \frac{480 \, \text{g}}{36.458 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 13.15 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

5. **Determine the molarity**:  
   Since the solution is 1 liter, the molarity is:  
   \[
   \text{Molarity} = \frac{\text{Moles of HCl}}{\text{Volume of solution in liters}} = 13.15 \, \text{M}.
   \]

Thus, the molarity of the solution is **13.15 M**, which corresponds to option **I**.
