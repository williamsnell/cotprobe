Okay, I have this problem about two cities with income distributions, and I need to find the probability that a person from the first city has a lower income than a person from the second city. The options are given, so I'll try to work through it step by step.

So, the pdfs are given as f(x) = 2/x³ for 1 < x < ∞, and g(y) = 3/y⁴ for 1 < y < ∞. Both x and y represent incomes in dollars, but each unit is $20,000. But since we're dealing with probabilities and comparing them, the units might not matter, so I can ignore that for now.

The problem asks for P(X < Y). That is, the probability that a randomly selected person from the first city (with distribution f) has an income less than that of a randomly selected person from the second city (with distribution g). 

I remember that for continuous random variables X and Y, the joint probability distribution is f(x)g(y) because they are independent, right? So the joint PDF is f(x) * g(y).

To find P(X < Y), I need to integrate the joint PDF over the region where x < y. Since both x and y are greater than 1, I can set up the double integral as an iterated integral. Let me think about the limits.

So, P(X < Y) = ∫ [from x=1 to ∞] ∫ [from y=x to ∞] f(x) g(y) dy dx.

Because x has to be less than y, for each x, y ranges from x to infinity. And x itself ranges from 1 to infinity.

Alternatively, another approach is to switch the order of integration. Maybe integrating over y first and then x. Let me see which way is easier.

Wait, another way to compute P(X < Y) is to realize that it's the probability that Y > X. Which is the same as 1 - P(Y ≤ X). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe not the easiest approach here.

So, let's proceed with the first approach. Let me write out the integrals.

First, the inner integral is over y from x to ∞ of f(x) g(y) dy. Since f(x) doesn't depend on y, it's a constant with respect to y. So f(x) is 2/x³, and g(y) is 3/y⁴. So the inner integral becomes:

∫ (from y=x to ∞) (2/x³) * (3/y⁴) dy = (2*3)/(x³) ∫ (1/y⁴) dy from y=x to ∞.

The integral of 1/y⁴ is ∫ y^(-4) dy = [ y^(-3)/(-3) ] + C = (-1)/(3 y³) + C. Evaluated from y=x to ∞.

At y=∞, the term is zero. At y=x, it's (-1)/(3 x³). So the integral becomes [0 - (-1/(3x³))] = 1/(3x³).

So, the inner integral is (2*3)/(x³) * (1/(3 x³)) )= (6)/(x³) * (1/(3 x³)) = 6/(3 x⁶) = 2/(x⁶).

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. So, 2/x³ multiplied by 1/(3 x³) would be 2/(3 x⁶). Right, because 2 * 1/(3) is 2/3, and x³ * x³ is x⁶.

So the inner integral is 2/(3 x⁶). So now, the outer integral is from x=1 to ∞ of 2/(3 x⁶) dx.

Compute that integral. The integral of x^(-6) dx is x^(-5)/(-5) + C. So evaluating from 1 to ∞.

At infinity, that term is zero. At x=1, it's [1^(-5)/(-5)] which is (-1/5). So subtracting, 0 - (-1/5) = 1/5.

So the integral becomes (2/3) * [1/5] = 2/(15).

Wait, wait a minute. But let me think again. The integral of 2/(3 x⁶) dx is:

(2/3) * ∫ x^(-6) dx = (2/3) * [x^(-5)/(-5)] evaluated from 1 to ∞.

Which is (2/3) * [ (0 - (-1/5)) ] = (2/3)*(1/5) = 2/15.

Hmm, but 2/15 is not one of the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, the options are A: 1/2, B:3/5, etc. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, let's go back. I think I made an error in setting up the integral. Let me re-express the problem.

Wait, so the joint PDF is f(x)g(y) = (2/x³)(3/y⁴) = 6/(x³ y⁴). So, the probability P(X < Y) is the double integral over x < y of 6/(x³ y⁴) dx dy.

Wait, in my initial approach, I integrated over y in [x, ∞) and x from 1 to ∞. Let me recompute that integral step.

So, for x from 1 to ∞, and for each x, y from x to ∞.

So the integral becomes:

∫ (x=1 to ∞) [ ∫ (y=x to ∞) 6/(x³ y⁴) dy ] dx.

First, integrate with respect to y. The integrand is 6/(x³ y⁴) = (6/x³) * y^(-4).

The integral of y^(-4) dy is [y^(-3)/(-3)] + C. So evaluating from y=x to ∞.

At ∞, it's zero. At y=x, it's [ x^(-3) * (-1/3) ] = -1/(3 x³).

So the inner integral is (6/x³) * [ 0 - ( - 1/(3 x³) ) ] = (6/x³) * (1/(3 x³)) = 6/(3 x⁶) = 2/(x⁶).

Ah, so the inner integral is 2/(x⁶) dx. Then, the outer integral is ∫ (x=1 to ∞) 2/(x⁶) dx.

Compute ∫2/x⁶ dx = 2 ∫ x^(-6) dx = 2 * [ x^(-5)/(-5) ] + C = -2/(5 x⁵) + C.

Evaluate from 1 to ∞.

At x=∞, term is zero. At x=1, it's -2/(5 *1^5) = -2/5. So, subtracting gives 0 - (-2/5) = 2/5.

So the outer integral is 2/5, so P(X < Y) = 2/5.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 2/5. So the answer should be G.

But wait, earlier I thought maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the initial setup again.

Wait, perhaps I got the limits wrong. Is P(X < Y) ∫∫ f(x)g(y) dx dy over x < y.

Another approach is to recognize that P(X < Y) = E[1_{X < Y}], where 1_{X < Y} is an indicator function which is 1 when X < Y and 0 otherwise.

Alternatively, using the survival function: P(X < Y) = ∫∫_{x < y} f(x)g(y) dx dy.

But perhaps I can compute it as the expectation of P(Y > X | Y), which is ∫ [from y=1 to ∞] P(X < y) g(y) dy.

Because for each y, the probability that X < y is the CDF of X evaluated at y.

Wait, maybe that's a better approach. Let me try that.

So, P(X < Y) = ∫ [from y=1 to ∞] P(X < y) g(y) dy.

P(X < y) is the CDF of X at y. For X, the CDF is F_X(y) = ∫ f(x) dx from 1 to y. Since f(x) = 2/x³.

So F_X(y) = ∫ (2/x³) dx from 1 to y = [ -1/x² ] from 1 to y = (-1/y²) - (-1/1²) )= 1 - 1/y².

So P(X < y) = 1 - 1/y².

Now, plug this into the integral:

P(X < Y) = ∫ [from y=1 to ∞] (1 - 1/y²) * g(y) dy.

g(y) = 3/y⁴. So, substituting:

= ∫ (from y=1 to ∞) (1 - 1/y²) * 3/y⁴ dy.

= 3 ∫ (from y=1 to ∞) [ (1/y⁴) - (1/y^6) ] dy.

Which is 3 [ ∫ 1/y⁴ dy - ∫ 1/y⁶ dy ] from 1 to ∞.

Compute each integral:

∫ 1/y⁴ dy = [ y^(-3)/(-3) ] + C = -1/(3 y³) + C.

∫ 1/y⁶ dy = [ y^(-5)/(-5) ] + C = -1/(5 y⁵) + C.

Evaluated from 1 to ∞.

At ∞, both terms are zero. At y=1, we have:

For the first integral: -1/(3 * 1³) = -1/3.

For the second integral: -1/(5 *1^5) = -1/5.

So the integral becomes:

3 [ (0 - (-1/3)) - (0 - (-1/5)) ) ] = 3 [ (1/3) - (1/5) ) ].

Compute 1/3 - 1/5: (5 -3)/15 = 2/15.

Multiply by 3: 3*(2/15) = 6/15 = 2/5.

So that's the same result as before, 2/5. So that's option G.

Wait, but the options have option G as 2/5. So that would be the answer.

But wait, I thought the initial approach gave 2/5, and the second approach also. So why did I think I made a mistake earlier?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach with the limits. Let me double-check that.

Wait, in the first approach, the integral was ∫ (from x=1 to ∞) [ ∫ (from y=x to ∞) (6/(x³ y⁴)) dy ] dx.

Wait, let me recompute the inner integral again.

Inner integral with respect to y: ∫ (6/(x³ y⁴)) dy from y=x to ∞.

Which is 6/(x³) ∫ (1/y⁴) dy from y=x to ∞.

Which is 6/(x³) [ (-1/(3 y³)) ] from y=x to ∞.

At ∞, it's zero. At y=x, it's (-1/(3 x³)) * (-1) ) = 1/(3 x³).

So the inner integral is 6/(x³) * (1/(3 x³)) ) = 6/(3 x⁶) = 2/(x⁶).

Wait, but 6/(x³) * [1/(3 x³)] is (6*1)/(3 x^6) )= 2/(x^6) yes.

So the integrand is 2/(x^6), correct.

So the outer integral is ∫ (from x=1 to ∞) 2 x^(-6) dx.

Which is 2 [ x^(-5)/( -5 ) ] from 1 to ∞.

At ∞, x^(-5) is 0. At x=1, it's 1^(-5) = 1. So the result is 2*(0 - (-1/5)) = 2*(1/5) = 2/5.

So the first approach gives the same answer as the second approach. So I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation, perhaps in setting up the limits. But both ways lead to 2/5, so that's the correct answer.

Looking back at the options, that's option G: 2/5.

So the answer should be G.

To compute \( P(X < Y) \), we use the joint probability density function (PDF) of \( X \) and \( Y \), which is the product of their individual PDFs:

\[
f(x) = \frac{2}{x^3}, \quad 1 < x < \infty, \quad \text{and} \quad g(y) = \frac{3}{y^4}, \quad 1 < y < \infty.
\]

The probability \( P(X < Y) \) is given by the double integral:

\[
P(X < Y) = \int_{1}^{\infty} \int_{1}^{y} \frac{2}{x^3} \cdot \frac{3}{y^4} \, dx \, dy.
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( x \):

\[
\int_{1}^{y} \frac{2}{x^3} \, dx = \left[ -\frac{1}{x^2} \right]_{1}^{y} = 1 - \frac{1}{y^2}.
\]

Substitute this result into the outer integral:

\[
P(X < Y) = \int_{1}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{1}{y^2}\right) \cdot \frac{3}{y^4} \, dy = 3 \int_{1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{y^4} - \frac{1}{y^6}\right) \, dy.
\]

Compute the integrals:

\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{y^4} \, dy = \left[ -\frac{1}{3y^3} \right]_{1}^{\infty} = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{y^6} \, dy = \left[ -\frac{1}{5y^5} \right]_{1}^{\infty} = \frac{1}{5}.
\]

Thus,

\[
P(X < Y) = 3 \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{5} \right) = 3 \cdot \frac{2}{15} = \frac{6}{15} = \frac{2}{5}.
\]

The final answer is \( \frac{2}{5} \), which corresponds to option G.
