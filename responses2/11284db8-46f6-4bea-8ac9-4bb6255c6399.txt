Okay, so I've got this question about the average speed of O₂ and CO₂ molecules at the same temperature. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that the average speed of gas molecules depends on temperature and molar mass. The formula, I think, is something like the root mean square speed. Oh right, the root mean square speed (v_rms) is given by the equation v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M), where R is the gas constant, T is temperature, and M is the molar mass.

So, same temperature, so T is the same. But different molar masses. O₂ has a molar mass of about 32 g/mol, and CO₂ is 44 g/mol. Wait, wait, wait—no, wait. O₂ is O2, which is 32 g/mol. CO₂ is C (12) + 2 O (32 each), so 12 + 32*2 = 88? Oh, wait, no, CO₂ is carbon dioxide, so it's 12 + (2*16) = 44 g/mol. Yeah, that's right.

So, since v_rms is inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass, a higher molar mass would result in a slower average speed. Because sqrt(M) increases as M increases, so 1/sqrt(M) decreases. So O₂ has a lower molar mass, so its v_rms is higher. CO₂ has a higher molar mass, so its v_rms is lower.

Wait, let me get that right. The formula: higher v_rms when M is lower. So O₂, lower M, faster speed. CO₂, higher M, slower speed. So O₂'s average speed is higher than CO₂'s.

But the question is about the average speed of CO₂. The given O₂'s average speed is 1700 km/h. So we need to find CO₂'s.

We can set up a ratio using the v_rms formula.

v1 / v2 = sqrt(M2 / M1)

Where v1 is O₂, v2 is CO₂. M2 is 44 g/mol, M1 is 32 g/mol.

So v2 = v1 * sqrt(M1 / M2)

Plugging in, v2 = 1700 * sqrt(32/44)

Wait, 32/44 is 8/11. So the square root of 8/11.

Hmmm, let me calculate 8/11. 8 divided by 11 is approximately 0.7273. The square root of 0.7273 is about 0.853. So v2 is about 1700 * 0.853 ≈ 1450 km/h.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Let's compute 32 and 44.

32 is 32, 44 is 44. 32/44 = 8/11. Square root is sqrt(8/11). Let me compute that accurately. So sqrt(8) is 2.828, sqrt(11) is about 3.3166. So 2.828 / 3.3166 ≈ 0.853.

So 1700 * 0.853 ≈ 1700 * 0.85 = 1445, plus a bit more. So about 1450 km/h.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E: 1450 km/h.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, wait, I might have gotten the formula backwards. Because the question is about average speed, but sometimes people refer to rms speed. So if the question is about average speed, that's a different thing, because average speed can be calculated using different methods, but I think in this context, the question is about root mean square speed.

Because the average speed is often referred to as (3/2)RT, but I think the question is about the root mean square speed, which is sqrt(3RT/M).

So with that, I think the correct answer would be E) 1450 km/h.

To determine the average speed of CO₂ molecules at the same temperature as O₂ molecules, we use the root mean square (rms) speed formula: 

\[
v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}}
\]

where \( R \) is the gas constant, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( M \) is the molar mass. Since the temperature is constant, the rms speed is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass (\( \sqrt{M} \)).

The molar mass of O₂ is 32 g/mol, and the molar mass of CO₂ is 44 g/mol. The ratio of the rms speeds of O₂ to CO₂ is given by:

\[
\frac{v_{\text{O₂}}}{v_{\text{CO₂}}} = \sqrt{\frac{M_{\text{CO₂}}}{M_{\text{O₂}}}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{v_{\text{O₂}}}{v_{\text{CO₂}}} = \sqrt{\frac{44}{32}} = \sqrt{\frac{11}{8}} \approx 0.853
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( v_{\text{CO₂}} \):

\[
v_{\text{CO₂}} = v_{\text{O₂}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{M_{\text{O₂}}}{M_{\text{CO₂}}}} = 1700 \cdot 0.853 \approx 1450 \, \text{km/h}
\]

Thus, the expected average speed of CO₂ molecules at the same temperature is approximately 1450 km/h. Among the given options, the closest value is 1450 km/h, which corresponds to option E.
