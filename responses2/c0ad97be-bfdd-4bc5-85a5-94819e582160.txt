Okay, so I've got this group theory question here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about when the map x → a x a² is a homomorphism of the group G into itself. Right, homomorphism means that the operation is preserved, so for all x and y in G, f(x y) = f(x) * f(y). 

So the function given is f(x) = a x a². I need to find the condition under which this is a homomorphism. Let's think step by step.

First, for f to be a homomorphism, f(x y) must equal f(x) * f(y). Let's compute both sides.

f(x y) = a (x y) a². Since group operation is associative, this is the same as (a x a²) * (a y a²) because you can rearrange the a's. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Because f(x) is a x a², so f(x y) would be a (x y) a². Since group operation is associative, that's a x (y) a²? No, wait. Actually, the function f is a homomorphism if a (x y) a² = (a x a²) * (a y a²). But wait, the group operation is associative, so a (x y) a² is equal to (a x a²) * (a y a²). Wait, that's because a x y a² can be rewritten as (a x a²) multiplied by (a y a²) when you multiply them. Hmm, but that's the same as (a x a²) * (a y a²) = a x a² a y a². But wait, that would suggest that a x y a² equals a x a² a y a². But that's not necessarily equal to (a x a²) * (a y a²) because the multiplication is inside the a's.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's compute f(x y) and f(x) f(y) and see what condition makes them equal.

f(x y) = a (x y) a².
f(x) f(y) = (a x a²) (a y a²) = a x a² a y a².

Now, let's compute f(x y) and f(x) f(y):

f(x y) = a x y a².
f(x) f(y) = a x a² a y a².

We can rearrange the terms in the f(x) f(y) expression because in a group, the operation is associative. So:

a x a² a y a² = a x (a² a) y a². Wait, no, because a² is on the left, then a on the right. Hmm, perhaps a better way is to rearrange terms:

a x a² a y a² = a x (a² a) y a². Wait, but a² a is a³. So it becomes a x a³ y a².

Hmm, but f(x y) is a x y a². So for this to equal f(x) f(y), we need:

a x y a² = a x a³ y a².

We can cancel out the a and a² on both ends. Let's see:

Left side: a x y a².
Right side: a x a³ y a².

If I write both sides as a * (some element) * a², then to make them equal, the middle parts must be equal. So the middle part is x y on the left and x a³ y on the right.

So x y = x a³ y.

Wait, that would suggest that x y = x (a³ y). Hmm, but that's only possible if a³ y = y a³, perhaps. Wait, no, because x y = x (a³ y) implies that x y = x a³ y → y = a³ y. Which would mean that a³ is the identity element. Because if y is arbitrary, then a³ y = y implies a³ = e.

Wait, but that's only if x y = x a³ y. So x y = x (a³ y). Let's see: x y is on the left, and x a³ y is on the right. So when you divide both sides by x (on the left), you get y = a³ y. So that would require a³ y = y for all y in G, which implies a³ = e.

Wait, so the condition is a³ = e. So looking back at the options, option E is a³ = a. Hmm, no, E is a³ = e. So option E is a³ = e.

Wait, but let me check again. Let me recompute f(x y) and f(x) f(y). 

f(x y) = a (x y) a² = a x a² y a².

f(x) f(y) = (a x a²) (a y a²) = a x (a² a) y a². Wait, this is a x a³ y a².

Wait, but a x a² a y a² is a x (a² a) y a², which is a x a³ y a².

So f(x) f(y) is a x a³ y a².

We want f(x y) = f(x) f(y). So:

a x a² y a² = a x a³ y a².

Wait, no, I think I messed up earlier steps. Let me do this again.

f(x y) = a (x y) a² = (a x a²) * (a y a²) because a is in the middle. Because the operation is associative, a (x y) a² = (a x a²) (a y a²).

Wait, but then f(x y) equals (a x a²) (a y a²). But f(x) f(y) is also (a x a²) (a y a²). So f(x y) equals f(x) f(y) if and only if (a x a²) * (a y a²) equals (a x a²) * (a y a²), which is always true. Wait, that can't be right because then the condition would be always true, which isn't one of the options. That suggests I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, no, I think I confused the function definitions. Let me clarify.

The function f is defined as f(x) = a x a². So f is a homomorphism if f(x y) = f(x) f(y) for all x, y in G.

So let's compute f(x y) and f(x) f(y):

f(x y) = a (x y) a².

f(x) f(y) = (a x a²) (a y a²) = a x a² a y a².

Because in a group, we can rearrange the terms using associativity, so a x a² a y a² = a x (a² a) y a² = a x a³ y a².

But f(x y) = a x a² y a².

So for f(x y) to equal f(x) f(y), we need:

a x a² y a² = a x a³ y a².

If we can cancel a x a² from both sides, then we get y a² = a³ y a².

Wait, but that's not going anywhere. Alternatively, perhaps we can factor out a x a² from both sides.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to factor out a x a² from both sides. So:

Left side: a x a² y a² = a x a² (y a²).

Right side: a x a³ y a² = a x a³ y a².

So for a x a² y a² to equal a x a³ y a², we can cancel a x a² from both sides on the left and right, but wait, the right side has a x a³ y a², so it's a x a³ y a².

So perhaps to make a x a² y a² = a x a³ y a², the y a² must equal a³ y a². That would imply that a³ y a² = y a².

Wait, that's getting a bit confusing. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps if I set x to be the identity element e. Then f(e) would be a e a² = a a² = a³.

If f is a homomorphism, then f(e) must be equal to f(e) * f(e), because e*e=e, so f(e) = f(e) * f(e). So a³ = a³ * a³.

Which would imply a³ = e.

So in this case, the condition is a³ = e. So option E is a³ = e. 

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the function f(x y) = a x a² y a² and f(x) f(y) = a x a³ y a², and if f(x) f(y) equals a x a³ y a², and f(x y) is a x a² y a², to have them equal, we must have a x a² y a² = a x a³ y a².

Which would imply that a² y a² = a³ y a². Hmm, but that would require a² y a² = a³ y a².

We can factor a² from both sides on the right: a² y a² = a² (a y a²). 

So, a² y a² = a² (a y a²). 

Divide both sides by a² (since a² is invertible, as it's a group element), we get y = a y a².

Wait, but that would mean a y a² = y. That would require a y a = y a, which is a relation on y. But this has to hold for all y in G, which is only possible if a is in the center of G. But the question doesn't specify that G is abelian. So perhaps this is only possible if a is central.

Wait, but the question is about the homomorphism condition. So maybe the condition a³ = e is needed, regardless of whether the group is abelian.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me approach it again.

For f to be a homomorphism, f(x y) must equal f(x) f(y). So,

f(x y) = a (x y) a².
f(x) f(y) = (a x a²) (a y a²) = a x a² a y a².

But in a group, the product is associative, so we can rearrange:

a x a² a y a² = a x (a² a) y a² = a x a³ y a².

So f(x y) is a x a² y a², and f(x) f(y) is a x a³ y a².

For these to be equal for all x and y, the middle parts must be equal. So:

a x a² y a² = a x a³ y a².

We can cancel a x a² on both sides, assuming a x a² is invertible, which it is because it's a group element. So cancelling a x a² from both sides, we get:

y a² = a³ y a².

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me move all terms to one side.

y a² = a³ y a².

Let me multiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} (the inverse of a):

a^{-1} y a² = a² y a².

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange terms.

Wait, if y a² = a³ y a², then multiply both sides on the left by a^{-1}:

a^{-1} y a² = a² y a².

But that's not immediately helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor y from both sides.

Wait, let me think about this differently. Let's try to see if a^3 must be equal to e.

Let me set x = e. Then f(e) = a e a² = a a² = a³.

If f is a homomorphism, then f(e) must satisfy f(e) = f(e) * f(e), because e * e = e, so f(e) * f(e) = f(e).

So a³ = a³ * a³.

Which implies a³ (e) = a³ a³.

So a³ = a^6. 

Wait, but that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, since a³ = a³ * a³, let's factor a³:

a³ (e) = a³ * a³ → a³ (e) = a³ a³ → e = a³.

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I should write a³ = a³ * a³.

Wait, but that's a³ = a³ a³. If I can factor a³ from both sides, assuming a³ is invertible, which it is because it's a group element.

So, a³ (e) = a³ a³ → e = a³ a³ → e = a^6. But that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that for f(x y) = f(x) f(y), we must have a³ = e. Let's see:

If f(x y) = a x a² y a².

And f(x) f(y) = a x a² a y a².

So for f(x y) = f(x) f(y), we need:

a x a² y a² = a x a² a y a².

Now, in a group, a x a² a y a² = a x a³ y a².

So, a x a² y a² = a x a³ y a².

We can divide both sides by a x a² (since a x a² is invertible), which gives:

y a² = a³ y a².

Wait, but this would require that y a² = a³ y a² for all y in G. Which implies that a³ is the identity, because moving y to the left:

y a² = a³ y a² → y a² a^{-3} = y a² → y (a² a^{-3}) = y a².

Wait, but that would require a² a^{-3} = a², so a^{-3} = e, so a^3 = e. Because if a^{-3} = e, then a^3 is e.

So yes, this condition leads us to a^3 = e.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: a³ = e.

The question asks under what condition the map \( x \mapsto a x a^2 \) is a homomorphism of the group \( G \) into itself. To determine this, we analyze the homomorphism property \( f(x y) = f(x) f(y) \) for all \( x, y \in G \).

1. **Compute \( f(x y) \) and \( f(x) f(y) \):**
   - \( f(x y) = a (x y) a^2 \).
   - \( f(x) f(y) = (a x a^2) (a y a^2) = a x a^2 a y a^2 \).

2. **Simplify \( f(x) f(y) \):**
   Using associativity of the group operation, \( a x a^2 a y a^2 = a x (a^2 a) y a^2 = a x a^3 y a^2 \).

3. **Equate \( f(x y) \) and \( f(x) f(y) \):**
   For \( f \) to be a homomorphism, \( a x a^2 y a^2 = a x a^3 y a^2 \). Canceling \( a x a^2 \) from both sides, we get \( y a^2 = a^3 y a^2 \).

4. **Derive the condition:**
   Rearranging \( y a^2 = a^3 y a^2 \), we find that this holds for all \( y \in G \) if and only if \( a^3 = e \). This ensures that the relation is satisfied universally.

Thus, the condition for \( f \) to be a homomorphism is \( a^3 = e \).
