Question:

Greene is the sole shareholder of Seagull, a calendar-year S corporation. Greene's basis at the beginning of the year is $15,000. Seagull reported an ordinary loss of $5,000 and $2,000 of municipal bond interest for the year. Seagull distributed cash of $6,000 to Greene on November 1. What is Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year?

Options:

A: $6,000
B: $15,000
C: $10,000
D: $16,000
E: $7,000
F: $8,000
G: $5,000
H: $14,000
I: $4,000
J: $12,000

Okay, so I need to figure out Greene's basis in Seagull after the year. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So, here's what I remember: When calculating basis in a calendar-year S corporation, the initial basis is the amount you have from the stock you own. Then, you adjust it based on the company's income and losses.

Greene's beginning basis is $15,000. The company, Seagull, reported an ordinary loss of $5,000 and a municipal bond interest loss of $2,000. Wait, but how do these losses affect the basis?

Wait, I think in S corporations, the loss can reduce the basis. But I need to consider whether the losses are ordinary or not, and how they're treated. Oh right, in S corporations, the entire loss is treated as an adjustment to the basis. So I don't have to split it into regular and irregular, or anything like that.

The initial basis is $15k. Then, the company's losses would decrease that basis. So, the total loss is $5k + $2k = $7k. But wait, is that correct? Because S corporations treat all losses as a deduction from basis. So the basis would decrease by the total loss.

Wait, but I also have to consider whether the loss is from the year before the distribution. Because the distribution happens at the end of the year, the loss would be applied to the basis before the distribution.

So, let me outline the steps:

1. Start with basis: $15k.

2. Subtract all the distributions made during the year. But in this case, the distribution is only on November 1, which is part of the year. So, the loss comes from the entire year. So, the basis is reduced by the total loss.

Wait, but wait. The company's loss is $5k and $2k, so total $7k. So, the basis after applying the loss would be $15k - $7k = $8k. But does that make sense? Because distributions are after the loss is applied. Or wait, was the distribution before or after?

In S-corporations, I think the distribution is after the adjusted basis has been adjusted by the year's losses. So:

- Start with basis: $15k.

- Subtract the total loss: $15k - $7k = $8k. That's the adjusted basis before the distribution.

- Then, distribute $6k. But wait, can you only distribute up to your adjusted basis? Because in S-corporations, if you have more cash than your basis, you can only take the amount equal to your basis, not the full loss.

So, in this case, the adjusted basis is $8k, so you can only give $8k. But the distribution is $6k which is less than $8k. So, you would transfer $6k, and your basis doesn't change because you only take up to your basis each year.

Wait, but wait, is this correct? Because in S corporations, any excess loss can be carried forward, but in this scenario, since the distribution is before any possible carryover, I think the distribution is limited by the adjusted basis.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another approach: the basis is calculated by subtracting the total loss from the initial basis. Then, when distributing, you can only give up up to the adjusted basis. So, for example, if your basis is $10k and you receive a distribution of $5k, you can only deduct $5k, leaving your basis as $5k.

Wait, but in this case, the distribution is $6k, but the basis after loss is $8k. So, the company is distributing $6k beyond that? Or is it just $6k? Because the basis is $8k, so you can only give $8k, but the distribution is $6k. So, the distribution is $6k, and your basis remains $8k because you only take $6k (which is less than your adjusted basis). 

Wait, wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

In S-corporation: The basis is the initial basis minus any distributions made during the year, but only up to the adjusted basis.

No, wait, the process is:

1. Initial basis: $15k.

2. Subtract the corporate losses: $5k + $2k = $7k.

So, basis becomes 15k -7k = 8k.

3. Then, distribute $6k. Since the adjusted basis is 8k, and you're distributing $6k, which is less than 8k, the distribution is only 6k, so the basis remains at 8k.

Wait, but the options don't have 8k as a choice. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options: A)6K, B)15K, C)10k, D)16k, E)7k, F)8k, G)5k, H)14k, I)4k, J)12k.

So, the correct answer is F)8k. But wait, I thought the options are about what is the basis at the end. So, after the distribution, the basis remains at 8k. So, the answer would be F.

Wait, but wait another thing. I think I might be missing something else. Because in some cases, the distribution is treated as a return of capital or something else. Or is there a different rule?

Wait, in S-corporations, the basis is calculated as the initial basis minus the total loss. So, in this case, $15k minus $7k equals $8k. Then, when distributing $6k, you can only transfer up to the adjusted basis. So, the distribution is $6k, and the basis remains $8k.

So, the correct answer is F)8k. But wait, looking back at the options, option F is 8k, so I think that's the answer.

To determine Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year, we follow these steps:

1. **Initial Basis**: Greene's initial basis is $15,000.

2. **Total Loss**: Seagull reported an ordinary loss of $5,000 and a municipal bond interest loss of $2,000, totaling $7,000.

3. **Adjusting Basis**: The total loss deductions reduce Greene's basis:
   \[
   \text{Basis after loss} = \$15,000 - \$7,000 = \$8,000
   \]

4. **Distribution**: Greene distributed $6,000 to him. Since the adjusted basis is $8,000, he can only transfer $6,000, leaving his basis unchanged at $8,000.

Thus, Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year is $8,000.
