Okay, I'm trying to figure out the pH of a neutral solution at 50°C. The question gives me pKw as 13.26 at 50°C. Hmm, I remember that at 25°C, water has a pH of 7, which is neutral, and that the pKw is 14. But wait, why is that?

Oh right, because at 25°C, the autoionization of water produces 10^-7 moles per liter of H+ and OH- ions. So pKw is the negative log of that concentration, which is 7. But at 50°C, the Kw increases. Since Kw at 50°C is 10^13.26, because pKw is 13.26, the square root of Kw would give me the concentration of H+.

Wait, how does that work? Oh, right. At any temperature, the product of H+ and OH- concentrations is Kw. So for a neutral solution, [H+] equals [OH-], which is the square root of Kw. That makes sense because if Kw is bigger, the concentration of H+ ions increases, and that makes the solution more acidic. Wait no, wait, that's not correct. Because if Kw is higher, [H+] would be higher, making the solution more acidic. So for a neutral solution, [H+] equals sqrt(Kw). 

So, the pH is the negative logarithm of [H+]. So pH = -log10 (sqrt(Kw)). Alternatively, that's the same as (1/2) * log10 (Kw). Because sqrt(Kw) is Kw^(1/2), so log(Kw^(1/2)) is (1/2) log Kw.

Wait, but then Kw is 10^13.26. So log10(Kw) is 13.26. So half of that is 6.63. So pH is 6.63? That would be option G. But wait, wait, wait. No, wait, because in a neutral solution, [H+] is sqrt(KW) because pH = pKa (if it's a weak acid, but here it's water). So wait, is the pH at neutral solution 7? No, because pH is 7 when Kw is 1e-14 in 25C, but at 50C, Kw is much higher.

Wait, let me think again. At 25C, Kw is 1e-14. So sqrt(1e-14) is 1e-7, so pH 7. At 50C, Kw is 1e13.26. So sqrt(Kw) is 1e(13.26/2) = 1e6.63. So [H+] is 1e6.63, so pH is 6.63. So the answer should be G, 6.63.

Wait, but another way to think about it: the pH of a neutral solution is half of the pKw. Because pKw is -log10(KW), and pH is -log10([H+]). If [H+] = sqrt(KW), then pH = (1/2) * pKw. Because pKw is the same as -log10(KW). So if [H+] is sqrt(KW), then pH is (1/2)*pKw. So plug in pKw=13.26, so pH is 13.26/2 = 6.63. So yes, option G.

The pH of a neutral solution at 50°C is determined by the relationship between the concentration of hydrogen ions ([H⁺]) and the water autoionization constant (Kw). At 50°C, Kw is given as 10¹³.26. For a neutral solution, [H⁺] equals [OH⁻], and both are equal to the square root of Kw. Thus, [H⁺] = √(Kw) = 10^(13.26/2) = 10⁶.63. The pH is the negative logarithm of [H⁺], so pH = -log10(10⁶.63) = 6.63. This matches option G.
