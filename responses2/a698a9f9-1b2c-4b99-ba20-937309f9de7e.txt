Alright, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. Oh right, there's a ball hanging from a vertical string, and originally it's at rest, so the tension in the string is equal to mg because of gravity. But now the ball is being made to move in a horizontal circle, so it's describing a cone. The question is about what happens to the tension in the string.

Wait, I remember that when an object moves in a circular path, it experiences centripetal force. So the tension in the string must be providing that centripetal force. But wait, when the ball is moving in a horizontal circle, isn't the force from the string combined with the vertical component balancing the weight of the ball?

Oh right, when the ball moves in a horizontal circle, the string makes an angle with the vertical. So the tension isn't just supporting the weight; it's also providing the necessary centripetal force. So the tension T can be resolved into two components: one vertical (T cos θ) supporting the weight (mg), and one horizontal (T sin θ) which is the centripetal force.

So from the vertical component: T cos θ = mg → T = mg / cos θ.

The horizontal component is T sin θ = (mv²)/r, where v is the speed of the ball and r is the radius of the circular path.

But since the string is making an angle θ with the vertical, I can relate these variables. From the vertical equation, cos θ = mg / T. And from the horizontal component equation, T sin θ = mv²/r. Also, since sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ = 1, I can substitute cos θ from the vertical equation.

Let me think... wait, another approach: the radius r can be related to the length of the string L and the angle θ. So r = L sin θ.

Putting it all together. The horizontal force (centripetal) is mv²/(L sin θ) ) = T sin θ.

But wait, from T cos θ = mg, so T = mg / cos θ.

Substituting T into the horizontal equation: (mg / cos θ) * sin θ = mv²/(L sin θ).

Simplify that: mg tan θ = mv²/( L sinθ )

Multiply both sides by L sinθ: mg L tanθ sinθ = mv².

Hmm, wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe better to think in terms of ratios.

The tension T is mg / cos θ. Now, what's cos θ? Well, from the geometry of the situation, the string makes angle θ with the vertical. So cos θ = adjacent / hypotenuse = mg / T.

So T = mg / cos θ.

But wait, when the ball is moving in a circle, the tension is greater than mg. Because the string is providing both the centripetal force and the support of the weight. So T must be larger than mg.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose the ball is moving in a circle. The vertical component of the tension must balance mg. The horizontal component is the centripetal, so T sin θ = mv²/r.

But T is greater than mg, because the string's angle is such that the vertical component can't support all the weight.

So the tension is greater than mg. So looking at the options, option D says it's greater than mg always. But wait, what if the speed is zero? Then the string doesn't have any horizontal component, so the tension would just be mg. So when speed changes, tension changes as well.

Wait, but in the problem, the ball is moving in a horizontal circle, so it's definitely moving at some speed. So T is greater than mg. So the tension is always more than mg. So which option is that? Option D says it's greater than mg always.

Wait, looking at the options: Option D: is greater than mg always.

Another angle: when the speed is zero, the tension is mg. But the problem states that the ball is moving in a horizontal circle, so speed is definitely non-zero. So tension must be greater than mg.

Wait, but what about when speed increases? The centripetal force (T sin θ) increases, so T must also increase. So yes, tension is always greater than mg.

So the correct answer should be D: is greater than mg always.

Wait, but I should check the other options. Let's see.

Option E: is equal to the square of the speed of the ball. That doesn't seem right. Tension is proportional to speed squared, yes, because T sin theta is (mv²)/r → T = (mv²)/(r sin theta) → but r = L sin theta, so T = (mv²)/(L (sin theta)^2 ). So T is proportional to speed squared. So E is incorrect.

Option F: remains unchanged regardless of movement. That's not true, because as speed increases, T increases.

Option G: is inversely proportional to the speed → No, T is proportional to speed squared.

Option H: is less than mg → No, T is greater.

Option I: directly proportional to speed → No, because T is proportional to speed squared.

Option J: may be greater or less → No, it's always greater.

So the correct answer is D. So the tension is greater than mg always.

When a ball of mass \( m \) is made to move in a horizontal circle, the tension in the string must provide both the vertical support for the ball's weight (\( T \cos \theta = mg \)) and the centripetal force (\( T \sin \theta = \frac{mv^2}{r} \)), where \( \theta \) is the angle the string makes with the vertical, \( v \) is the speed of the ball, and \( r \) is the radius of the circular path. 

From \( T \cos \theta = mg \), it follows that \( T = \frac{mg}{\cos \theta} \). Since \( \cos \theta \) is always less than 1 (because \( \theta \) is non-zero for motion), \( T \) is always greater than \( mg \). 

Additionally, from \( T \sin \theta = \frac{mv^2}{r} \), the tension is proportional to \( v^2 \), meaning it increases with the square of the speed. This confirms that \( T \) is always greater than \( mg \) and increases as the speed increases. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A**: Incorrect. The tension is not equal to \( mg \) when the ball is moving in a horizontal circle.
- **B**: Incorrect. The tension is not equal to \( mg \).
- **C**: Incorrect. The tension is not always less than \( mg \).
- **D**: Correct. The tension is always greater than \( mg \) and increases as the speed increases.
- **E**: Incorrect. The tension is not equal to \( v^2 \).
- **F**: Incorrect. The tension changes with speed.
- **G**: Incorrect. The tension is not inversely proportional to \( v \).
- **H**: Incorrect. The tension is not less than \( mg \).
- **I**: Incorrect. The tension is not directly proportional to \( v \).
- **J**: Incorrect. The tension is not always greater than \( mg \).

Thus, the correct answer is:
