Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about soft determinism. Hmm, I remember determinism is a philosophical concept, right? It's about whether every event, including human actions, is the result of prior events according to cause and effect.

Wait, soft determinism. I think that's a term used in psychology or philosophy. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact meaning. Soft determinism suggests that human behavior is determined by physical laws, but without the need for conscious will. So it's more about biological determinism than strict causation because it doesn't require free will.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Our actions are completely predetermined. That sounds like strict determinism, not soft. Because strict determinism typically implies that every action is the result of prior causes without any room for free will. Soft might allow some controllability.

Option B: We have no control over our actions. Hmm, if it's soft determinism, that could mean that while actions are determined, they're not under our free will. So perhaps this is correct, but I'm not entirely sure.

Option C: The thesis of determinism is false. The thesis is the proposition that everything is determined. Soft determinism would mean that determinism is true, not false. So this might not be the right answer.

Option D: The thesis of free will is false. I'm not sure if that's related here. The question is about determinism, not free will, so maybe this isn't the right choice.

Option E: The thesis of determinism is true. That sounds correct if the question is about soft determinism, but wait, the question just says "soft determinism entails that", so I think the answer is about what soft determinism says, not whether the thesis is true.

Option F: There are no restraints on human behavior. That's a bit broad. Soft determinism is about biological control, not necessarily no restraints. So maybe F isn't the answer.

Option G: Human behavior is entirely random. No, that's more about probabilistic outcomes, not determinism.

Option H: Our desires are predetermined, but our actions are not. That sounds like it's saying that while our desires are determined, our actions are not. That seems a bit conflicting. If determinism is about actions being determined, then this might not fit.

Wait, the question is about what soft determinism entails. Soft determinism is the view that human behavior is governed by biological determinism, meaning that all events, including our actions, are caused by prior events. But it doesn't necessarily mean that there are no free will or that we can control our actions. So soft determinism doesn't require that we have no control over our actions; it just means that our actions are determined by physical processes, not by our own free choices.

So looking again at the options, option B says we have no control over our actions. Does soft determinism support that? I think soft determinism would allow for some control, but not full control. So option B would be incorrect because soft determinism allows for some controllability but not complete avoidance of free will.

Option E says determinism is true, which is correct for soft determinism. But the question is what does soft determinism entail. So perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Soft determinism is a form of scientific determinism that doesn't require free will. So the thesis of determinism (that all events are determined by prior) is true. So option E would be correct.

But I'm a bit mixed up because the options are about what determinism entails. Soft determinism is a type of scientific determinism that doesn't involve free will. So the determinism is true.

But looking at the options, E says the thesis of determinism is true. If the question is about what soft determinism entails, then E is correct. But wait, the question is about soft determinism, not whether determinism is true.

Wait, the question is: Soft determinism entails that _____.

So the correct answer should align with the definition of soft determinism. Soft determinism is a form of scientific determinism that doesn't require free will. So the determinism is true (E is correct). But option E says the thesis of determinism is true, which is correct for soft determinism.

Wait, but the options are:

E: the thesis of determinism is true

So if someone says "soft determinism entails that the thesis of determinism is true", then E is correct. Because the thesis is about determinism in general.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The correct answer is E: the thesis of determinism is true. Soft determinism is a form of scientific determinism that supports the thesis that all events, including human actions, are determined by prior events according to biological laws. It does not require free will but allows for some controllability. Therefore, the determinism is true as per the thesis.

Answer: E
