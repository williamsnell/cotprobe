Okay, so I've got this question here about the rock on Mars that was mistakenly called "bigfoot." The question says it was about 5 cm tall and had an angular size of 0.5 degrees. I need to figure out how far it was from the rover. The options are various distances in meters and feet, so I have to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that angular size, or how big something appears in the sky, is related to its actual size and the distance from the observer. The formula that comes to mind is the small angle approximation. The formula is: 

angular size (in radians) ≈ actual size / distance.

So, the angular size is given in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians. Wait, right, because the formula uses radians. So I should convert 0.5 degrees to radians.

1 degree is π/180 radians, so 0.5 degrees is 0.5 * π/180. Let me calculate that. 0.5 * 3.1416 / 180 ≈ 0.008727 radians.

The actual size of the rock is given as 5 cm. I need to convert that to meters because the distance options are in meters. 5 cm is 0.05 meters.

Now, plugging into the formula: 0.008727 ≈ 0.05 / distance. So, solving for distance: distance ≈ 0.05 / 0.008727. Let me compute that. 0.05 divided by 0.008727 is approximately 5.74 meters.

Wait, that's about 5.7 meters. Looking at the options, option G is about 5 meters, which seems to match. But wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach. Let me think again. The angular size (θ) is given as 0.5 degrees, which is 0.0087 radians. The height (h) is 5 cm, which is 0.05 m. Using θ = h / d, so d = h / θ. So d = 0.05 / 0.0087 ≈ 5.74 meters. That’s about 5.7 meters, which is option G. But wait, none of the options is exactly 5.7 meters. Let me check the options again.

The options are: A: 6 meters, B:6ft (about 1.8 meters), C:20m, D:15m, E:15ft (~4.57m), F:5ft (~1.52m), G:5m, H:20ft (~6.09m), I:10m, J:10ft (~3.05m).

So option G is 5 meters, which is close to 5.7. But wait, I might have made an error in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact formula without approximating. Let me do the calculation more precisely.

θ = 0.5 degrees. Convert to radians: 0.5 * (π/180) = π/360 ≈ 0.00872664626 radians.

h =5 cm = 0.05 m.

Using θ = h/d → d = 0.05 / 0.00872664626 ≈ 5.729 meters ≈ 5.73 m.

So about 5.7 meters, which is closest to 6 meters (option A) or 5 meters (option G). But 5.73 is closer to 6 than 5. So option A is 6m, which is about 6 meters.

Wait, but another approach: sometimes people use small angle in arcminutes or arcseconds. Let me think. 0.5 degrees is 30 arcminutes. Alternatively, perhaps I should have converted the angular size into arcseconds.

Wait, 1 degree is 60 arcminutes, and 1 arcminute is 60 arcseconds, so 0.5 degrees is 30 arcminutes, which is 30 *60 = 1800 arcseconds.

Angular size (θ) in arcseconds is 1800. Height h is 5 cm. Using the formula: θ (in arcseconds) = (h * 206265) / d, where 206265 is the conversion factor from arcseconds to radians.

Wait, perhaps another way. Let's use the exact formula with the conversion factor.

Wait, the formula can be written as θ (in radians) = h (meters) / d (meters).

So θ ≈ 0.05 / d.

But θ in radians is 0.5 degrees = 0.00872664626.

So 0.00872664626 = 0.05 / d → d = 0.05 / 0.00872664626 → d ≈5.729 meters.

So, about 5.73 meters.

Looking at the options, option G is 5 meters, which is the closest. But option A is 6 meters. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach. Let me think about the actual size and the distance.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me check the units again.

h =5 cm = 0.05 meters.

θ=0.5 degrees = 0.5*(π/180) ≈0.0087266 radians.

Using the formula: d = h / θ.

So d ≈ 0.05 / 0.0087266 ≈5.73 meters.

So the correct answer is approximately 5.7 meters, which is closest to 6 meters (option A). But wait, the options also include 5 meters (option G). Oh wait, because 6 meters is option A and 5 meters is option G. So which is more accurate?

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula differently. For example, sometimes, people use the formula h = d * tan(theta), where theta is in radians. For small angles, tan(theta) ≈ theta. So the same result as before.

So the distance is about 5.7 meters, which is 5.73 m. So the closest option is 6 meters (option A) or 5 meters (option G). Hmm, but 5.7 is closer to 6 than to 5. So option A (6 meters) is the correct answer.

Wait, but the options are:

A: About 6 meters
G: About 5 meters

So the answer should be A. But wait, another thought: maybe I should convert the distance into feet. 5.7 meters is approximately 18.74 feet.

Looking at the options, option F is 5 feet, which is about 1.52 m. Option E is 15 feet (~4.57m). Option J is 10 feet (~3.05m). Option H is 20 feet (~6.09m).

Wait, so 5.7 meters is approximately 18.74 feet. The options don't have that. The closest is option H: 20 feet, which is 6.09 meters. But that's not matching. Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the formula. Let me make sure.

The formula is:

θ (radians) = h (m) / d (m)

So solving for d: d = h / θ.

h is 0.05 m.

θ is 0.5 degrees converted to radians: 0.5 * (π/180) ≈0.0087266.

So d = 0.05 / 0.0087266 ≈5.73 m.

So about 5.7 meters. So the answer is 5.7 meters, which is approximately 5.7 meters. So the options are A (6m), G (5m).

Wait, perhaps the options have some approximation. Let me see the options again.

The options are:

A: About 6 meters

G: About 5 meters.

So 5.7 is closer to 6 than 5. So the correct answer is A (6 meters).

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the rock is 5 cm tall, but the angle is 0.5 degrees. Maybe the calculation is correct, but I should consider that 5 cm is 0.05 m, which is correct.

Wait, did I convert degrees correctly? 0.5 degrees is 0.0087 radians. Correct.

Another possibility: perhaps I'm using the wrong units. Maybe the angular size is in arcminutes or arcseconds. Let me try that.

0.5 degrees is 30 arcminutes (since 1 degree = 60 arcminutes). So θ =30 arcminutes.

Wait, another formula for angular size is: θ (in arcseconds) = 206265 * (h (meters) / d (meters)).

Wait, perhaps I should use that formula.

So θ (arcseconds) = (h / d) * 206265.

We have θ =0.5 degrees, which is 30 arcminutes = 1800 arcseconds.

So 1800 = (h /d) *206265 → h/d = 1800 / 206265 → h/d ≈0.0087266.

So h = d *0.0087266 → d = h /0.0087266.

h is 0.05 m → d = 0.05 /0.0087266 ≈5.73 m.

Same result as before.

So, no mistake here. So the distance is approximately 5.7 meters, which is closer to 6 meters (option A) than to 5 meters (option G).

But wait, looking at the options again:

A:6m, G:5m.

So the correct answer is A?

Wait, but is there any other way this could be approached? Another way: using the small angle formula where the actual size is h, and the distance is d.

The small angle is θ= h/d, but that's only when θ is in radians.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Another way is to use θ (radians) = h (meters) / d (meters). So no mistake there.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is θ (in degrees) = (h (cm) / 100) / d (meters) * (180/π).

Wait, let me think.

Angular size in degrees: θ (degrees) = (h (cm) ) / (d (m) * 5.03) ). Wait, I'm not sure about the conversion factor. Wait, maybe the formula is θ (degrees) = (h (cm) / 100 ) / (d (m) * 5.03).

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is θ (degrees) = (h (cm) / 100 ) / d (m) * (180/π).

Wait, let me check.

Because we have θ (radians) = h (m) / d.

But since 1 radian = 57.3 degrees, h (m) = h (cm)/100.

So θ (radians) = (h (cm)/100 ) / d.

θ (degrees) = θ (radians) * (180/pi) )= [ (h (cm)/100 ) / d ] * (180/pi) )

So, θ (degrees) = (h (cm) * 180) / (pi * 100 * d )

So solving for d: d = (h (cm) * 180) / (pi * 100 * θ (degrees) )

Let me plug in the numbers.

h =5 cm. θ =0.5 degrees.

So d = (5 * 180) / (pi * 100 * 0.5 )

Compute numerator: 5 * 180 =900.

Denominator: pi * 100 *0.5 = 50 pi ≈157.08.

So d=900 /157.08 ≈5.73 meters.

So same result. So the rock is about 5.7 meters away. So the correct answer is option A (6 meters) or option G (5 meters), but 5.7 is closer to 6, so option A.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 5.7 meters. So 5.7 m is approximately 18.74 feet.

Looking at the options:

A:6m (18 feet approx)

G:5m (16.4 ft)

So 5.7 m is closer to 6 m than to 5 m.

So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but another thought: the question states that the angular size is about 0.5 degrees. So perhaps the rock's angular size is 0.5 degrees, but the actual size is 5 cm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the distance in feet for better understanding.

5 m is about 16.4 feet. 6 m is about 19.6 feet.

5.7 m is about 18.7 feet. The options don't have 18.7, so the closest is 19.6 (6m) or 16.4 (5m). 18.7 is closer to 19.6 (6m) than to 16.4 (5m). So 6m is the better choice.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.

To determine the distance to the rock, we use the small angle formula:

\[
\theta \, (\text{radians}) = \frac{h \, (\text{m})}{d \, (\text{m})}
\]

Rearranging for \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{h}{\theta}
\]

### Step 1: Convert angular size to radians
The angular size is given as \(0.5^\circ\). Converting to radians:

\[
0.5^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 0.0087266 \, \text{radians}
\]

### Step 2: Convert height to meters
The height of the rock is \(5 \, \text{cm} = 0.05 \, \text{m}\).

### Step 3: Solve for distance
Using the formula:

\[
d = \frac{0.05}{0.0087266} \approx 5.73 \, \text{meters}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated distance is approximately \(5.73 \, \text{meters}\). Among the options:

- **A: About 6 meters** (closest to \(5.73 \, \text{meters}\))
- **G: About 5 meters** (less close)

Thus, the correct answer is **A: About 6 meters**.
