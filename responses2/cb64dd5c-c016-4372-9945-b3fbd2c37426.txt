Okay, so I've got this limit problem to solve: the limit as x approaches π/2 of cos(x) multiplied by cos(tan(x)). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that when dealing with limits involving trigonometric functions, it's important to analyze the behavior of each function as x approaches the given value. In this case, x is approaching π/2. I know that tan(x) has a period of π and asymptotes at odd multiples of π/2. So, as x approaches π/2 from the left, tan(x) goes to positive infinity. 

Let me break down the expression: cos(x) * cos(tan(x)). So, as x approaches π/2, cos(x) approaches cos(π/2), which is 0. And cos(tan(x)) becomes cos(inf) as tan(x) tends to infinity. Wait, cos(tan(x)) when tan(x) is very large. Since tan(x) approaches π/2 from above, it's an angle where cosine is approaching zero? Wait no, wait. Let me think about the behavior of cos(y) as y approaches infinity. Cosine oscillates between -1 and 1 as y increases, so it doesn't approach a specific limit. So, cos(tan(x)) doesn't have a limit as x approaches π/2 because tan(x) goes to infinity, making cos(tan(x)) oscillate.

But wait, the main term is cos(x), which approaches zero. So, we have 0 multiplied by something that oscillates. Hmm. That might lead to an indeterminate form 0 times infinity, which is an indeterminate form. So, I need to find a way to evaluate this limit.

I recall that for limits of the form lim f(x)*g(x), where f(x) approaches 0 and g(x) approaches infinity, we can rewrite it as lim [g(x)/ (1/f(x))], which would then be a limit that can be evaluated if it's in a form suitable for L'Hospital's Rule. Alternatively, perhaps using substitution or series expansions.

Wait, but in this case, f(x) is cos(x) approaching 0, and g(x) is cos(tan(x)), which oscillates. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the behavior of cos(tan(x)) as x approaches π/2.

Let me consider substituting t = x - π/2, so as x approaches π/2, t approaches 0. Then, tan(x) can be expressed in terms of t. Let me compute tan(x) when x = π/2 + t.

We know that tan(π/2 + t) = -cot(t). Because tan(π/2 + t) is equal to -cot(t). So, tan(x) = -cot(t). Therefore, cos(tan(x)) becomes cos(-cot(t)). Cosine is an even function, so cos(-cot(t)) = cos(cot(t)).

Now, as t approaches 0, cot(t) is 1/t, because cot(t) = cos(t)/sin(t), and as t approaches 0, sin(t) ≈ t and cos(t) ≈ 1, so cot(t) ≈ 1/t.

So, cos(cot(t)) = cos(1/t). Now, as t approaches 0, 1/t approaches infinity. So, cos(1/t) as t approaches 0 (from the right) is cos(inf), which oscillates between -1 and 1. Similarly, from the left, t approaches 0 from negative values, but cot(t) would be negative because t is negative, so 1/t is negative, but cos is even, so cos(1/t) is the same as cos(1/|t|).

So, cos(1/t) oscillates as t approaches 0. Therefore, cos(tan(x)) oscillates between -1 and 1 as x approaches π/2. 

But wait, the original expression is cos(x) * cos(tan(x)).

When x approaches π/2, cos(x) approaches 0, and cos(tan(x)) oscillates between -1 and 1. So, the product is 0 multiplied by something that's oscillating between -1 and 1. So, in the limit, the product might approach 0, but sometimes it could approach a maximum or minimum. But since the oscillation is bounded, the product's limit might not exist because it could approach different values depending on x. 

Wait, but let's think again. The limit as x approaches π/2 of cos(x) * cos(tan(x)).

Another approach: Let's consider the function f(x) = cos(x) * cos(tan(x)).

As x approaches π/2, cos(x) approaches 0. Let me see if the product can be expressed as something that tends to 0.

Alternatively, maybe I can write it as cos(x) * cos(tan(x)) and then consider the behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps using a substitution: Let me set y = π/2 - x. Then as x approaches π/2, y approaches 0. So, cos(x) = cos(π/2 - y) = sin(y). And tan(x) = tan(π/2 - y) = cot(y). So, cos(tan(x)) = cos(cot(y)).

So, the expression becomes sin(y) * cos(cot(y)).

Now, as y approaches 0, cot(y) = 1/tan(y) ≈ 1/y. So, cos(cot(y)) = cos(1/y). As y approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/y approaches positive infinity, so cos(1/y) oscillates between -1 and 1. Similarly, from the negative side, 1/y approaches negative infinity, but cos is even, so it's the same as cos(1/|y|), which again oscillates.

So, the expression is sin(y) times cos(1/y). Now, as y approaches 0, sin(y) approaches 0. And cos(1/y) oscillates between -1 and 1. So, the product is 0 times a bounded oscillating function. 

In such cases, the product's limit might not exist because the oscillations could cause the function to not approach a single value. But sometimes, the limit could be 0 if the oscillations are such that the product tends to 0. But in reality, because cos(1/y) doesn't approach 0, just oscillates, the product doesn't approach a single value. So, the limit doesn't exist.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, I see an option E: π/2, which is approximately 1.5708, and H: -√2/2 ≈ -0.707, and F: √2/2 ≈ 0.707. But none of these options are 0. So, perhaps the limit does not exist, but looking at the options, E is a number, not an undefined one. The options are A to J.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the problem. The question is the limit as x approaches π/2 of cos(x)cos(tan(x)).

Wait, perhaps the limit does exist. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when x approaches π/2, cos(x) approaches 0, and tan(x) approaches infinity. So, cos(tan(x)) oscillates between -1 and 1. So, the product is 0 multiplied by something that doesn't approach a limit.

But when x approaches π/2 from the right, y approaches 0 from the positive side, so 1/y approaches positive infinity. So, cos(1/y) oscillates. The same for x approaching π/2 from the left, y approaches 0 from the negative side, but cot(y) is -1/y, so cos(-1/y) is cos(1/y) again, which oscillates.

Wait, but perhaps I can analyze the behavior more carefully. Let's take a sequence of x approaching π/2 and see what the function tends to.

Let me pick x_n = π/2 - 1/n, where n approaches infinity. So, as n increases, x approaches π/2 from below.

Then, cos(x_n) = cos(π/2 - 1/n) = sin(1/n). Since 1/n approaches 0, sin(1/n) ≈ 1/n.

And tan(x_n) = tan(π/2 - 1/n) = cot(1/n) = 1/tan(1/n) ≈ n, because tan(1/n) ≈ 1/n for small 1/n.

So, cos(tan(x_n)) ≈ cos(n). As n increases, cos(n) oscillates between -1 and 1.

So, the product is sin(1/n) * cos(n) ≈ (1/n) * cos(n). As n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so the product approaches 0.

Similarly, taking a sequence x_n = π/2 + 1/n, approaching from above.

Then, cos(x_n) = cos(π/2 + 1/n) = -sin(1/n) ≈ -1/n.

tan(x_n) = tan(π/2 + 1/n) = -cot(1/n) ≈ -n.

So, cos(tan(x_n)) = cos(-n) = cos(n), again oscillating.

So, the product is (-1/n) * cos(n), which also approaches 0 as n approaches infinity.

Hmm, so both from above and below, the limit seems to approach 0. But wait, earlier I thought about the function oscillating, but in these specific sequences, it's approaching 0. Does that mean the limit is 0?

Wait, but in other sequences, perhaps the limit could be different. For example, take x_n = π/2 + 1/(nπ). Then, tan(x_n) = tan(π/2 + 1/(nπ)) = -cot(1/(nπ)) ≈ -nπ. So, cos(tan(x_n)) = cos(-nπ) = cos(nπ) = (-1)^n.

So, cos(x_n) = cos(π/2 + 1/(nπ)) = -sin(1/(nπ)) ≈ -1/(nπ).

So, the product is (-1/(nπ)) * (-1)^n = (1/(nπ)) * (-1)^{n+1}.

As n approaches infinity, this oscillates between 1/(nπ) and -1/(nπ), but the magnitude 1/(nπ) tends to 0. So, the product tends to 0.

Wait, but that's just two specific cases. What about if we choose x_n such that n is such that tan(x_n) is an integer multiple of π/2?

Wait, perhaps I need a different approach. Let me think about the limit of the product.

We have cos(x) * cos(tan(x)).

As x approaches π/2, cos(x) approaches 0. Let me denote cos(x) as ε, which approaches 0.

So, the product becomes ε * cos(tan(x)).

But tan(x) approaches infinity as x approaches π/2. So, cos(tan(x)) oscillates between -1 and 1.

So, the product is ε * [something between -1 and 1]. So, the product is between -ε and ε. As ε approaches 0, both upper and lower bounds approach 0. So, by the Squeeze Theorem, the limit should be 0.

Ah, so that makes sense. Because cos(tan(x)) is bounded between -1 and 1, and cos(x) approaches 0, the entire expression is squeezed between -cos(x) and cos(x), both of which approach 0. So, the limit is 0.

So, looking back at the options, option I is 0.

Wait, but earlier I thought that because cos(tan(x)) oscillates, the limit might not exist, but in reality, the squeeze theorem shows it approaches 0. So, the answer should be I: 0.
</think>

The limit as x approaches π/2 of cos(x)cos(tan(x)) is 0, as the product is squeezed between -cos(x) and cos(x), both of which approach 0.

Answer: I: 0
