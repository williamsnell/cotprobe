Okay, so I have this question about statistics, specifically about confidence intervals and averages. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that a director of a local food bank asks for data on all donations given during November. Out of 100 checks, the average donation is $155 with a standard deviation of $32. I need to pick the correct statement from the options A to J.

First, I remember that when we talk about confidence intervals, we're giving an estimated range of values which is likely to include the true population parameter, in this case, the average donation. The average here is $155, which is the sample mean. The standard deviation is $32, which is the sample standard deviation.

The options involve different confidence levels and ranges. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: We are 95% confident that the average donation is between $149 and $161. Hmm, wait. The confidence interval is calculated using the sample mean and the standard error. The formula is usually mean ± (z-score * standard error). The standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. Here, the sample size is 100, so the square root is 10. So standard error is 32 / 10 = 3.2. The z-score for 95% confidence is about 1.96. So 1.96 * 3.2 is approximately 6.272. Adding and subtracting that from the mean of 155 gives 155 - 6.272 = 148.728 and 155 +6.272=161.272. So the interval is roughly $149 to $161. But wait, the options don't say "about" but exactly, so maybe this is an option.

Option B: The average is $32. That's not possible because the sample mean is $155. So B is wrong.

Option C: 95% confidence interval is $123 to $187. Wait, let me recalculate that. If the standard error is 3.2, and 1.96 *3.2 is about 6.27, so 155-6.27 is about 148.73, which is about $149, not $123. So C is incorrect. Also, the standard deviation of the donations is $32, but the average is $155, so that's not a correct statement. Also, the wording is off, because the confidence interval is about the mean, not the standard deviation. So C is wrong.

Option D: The average is $155. Again, this is the sample mean, not a confidence interval. So D is incorrect.

Option E: The standard deviation is $155. That's a big jump. The sample standard deviation is $32, so E is incorrect.

Option F: 75% of all donations are more than $155. Wait, that's making a statement about the percentage of donations. This is incorrect because the confidence interval is about the average, not the distribution. The standard deviation being 32 doesn't necessarily mean that 75% are above 155. Also, without knowing the distribution, we can't directly say that. So F is wrong.

Option G: 95% confidence interval is $91 to $219. Let me compute that. The confidence interval would be 155 ± (1.96 * (32/sqrt(100))). 32/10 is 3.2. 1.96 *3.2 is about 6.27. So 155 -6.27=148.73, and 155 +6.27=161.27. So the interval is ~$149 to ~$161. So G is saying $91 to $219, which is way too wide. So G is incorrect.

Option H: 50% of donations are less than $155. This is a statement about the median, but the question is about the average. So H is incorrect.

Option I: 50% of donations are more than $155. Similarly, this is about the median and not the average. So I is wrong.

Option J: 99% confidence interval is $91 to $219. Wait, let me compute this. For a 99% confidence level, the z-score is about 2.576. So 2.576 *3.2 = approx 8.243. So 155 -8.243=146.757, and 155 +8.243=163.243. So the interval would be around $147 to $163. So the range in J is $91 to $219, which is way too big. So J is incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check. For 95% CI, it's 1.96*3.2=6.27, leading to $149 and $161. So A says 95% CI from ~$149 to $161. So A is correct. But looking back, I think I made a mistake. Because the 95% confidence interval for the mean is about $149 to $161. So option A is correct.

Wait, but let me look at option G again. The 95% confidence interval is from 155 - 6.27 = 148.73 to 161.27, as I calculated. So it's about $149 to $161. So the statement in option A is correct.

Wait, but option G says the average is between $91 and $219. That's a much wider interval. So why is option G correct? Oh, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the standard error is 32/sqrt(100)=3.2. So for 95% confidence, it's 1.96 *3.2=6.272. So the CI is 155 -6.272 =148.728 to 155 +6.272=161.272. So the interval is roughly 149 to 161, which is what option A says. So option A is correct.

Option G is the one suggesting a much wider interval, which isn't correct. So the correct answer would be option A and maybe others, but looking through the options, option A is the only one that correctly describes the confidence interval for the average.

Wait, option G's 95% confidence interval is between $91 and $219. That would require a much higher standard error. Let me see: 91 to 219 is a range of 128, which is 1.96 *6.272 would be 12.32. But that would make the standard error 12.32 /1.96≈6.27, which is the same as before. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, 91 is way lower than 155. So if the interval is 91 to 219, that suggests a much narrower confidence interval, which is not the case here. So G is incorrect.

Wait, but someone might miscalculate and think the confidence interval is wider. So in that case, option G would be incorrect.

Looking back, the only correct option is A. So the correct answer must be A.

The question asks for the most appropriate statement regarding the average donations given during November, based on the sample data. The sample mean is $155 with a standard deviation of $32 from 100 donations. The correct statement involves a 95% confidence interval for the average donation.

- **Option A**: Correct. The 95% confidence interval is calculated as $155 ± 1.96 * (32/10) ≈ $155 ± 6.27, which results in approximately $149 to $161. This correctly describes the confidence interval.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The 95% confidence interval is narrower than $91 to $219, which is much wider. The correct interval is much closer to $149 to $161.
- Other options are incorrect for various reasons: incorrect statements about the average donation, standard deviation, median, or confidence levels.
