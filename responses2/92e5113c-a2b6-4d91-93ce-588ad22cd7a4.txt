Question:

We are training fully connected network with two hidden layers to predict housing prices. Inputs are $100$-dimensional, and have several features such as the number of square feet, the median family income, etc. The first hidden layer has $1000$ activations. The second hidden layer has $10$ activations. The output is a scalar representing the house price. Assuming a vanilla network with affine transformations and with no batch normalization and no learnable parameters in the activation function, how many parameters does this network have?

Options:

A: 120010
B: 111110
C: 100121
D: 112110
E: 110010
F: 110020
G: 122121
H: 110011
I: 111021
J: 130021

Okay, so I've got this question about a neural network setup, and I need to figure out how many parameters are in it. Let's see. The setup is a fully connected network with two hidden layers. The inputs are 100-dimensional, which is a lot, and there are several features like square footage, median income, etc.

The first hidden layer has 1000 activations. Hmm, so the number of neurons in the first hidden layer is 1000. The second hidden layer has 10 activations. So, that's 10 neurons.

The output is a scalar, which means the network is predicting a single value, like a price. Since it's a fully connected network, all the neurons are connected to each other. So, I need to calculate the number of weights and biases for each layer.

Let me think about the layers. The input layer has 100 features. Then comes the first hidden layer with 1000 neurons. Then the second hidden layer with 10 neurons, and finally the output layer with 1 neuron.

For each layer, the number of weights (excluding biases) is the number of neurons multiplied by the number of inputs from the previous layer. And each layer also has a bias term.

So, let's break it down layer by layer.

First, the input layer. It's connected to the first hidden layer. The input layer has 100 features, so the first hidden layer has 1000 neurons. So, the number of weights between the input and first hidden layer is 100 * 1000 = 100,000. And each layer has one bias, so 100,000 + 1 = 100,001 parameters for the first layer.

Wait, no, wait. Wait. The first hidden layer is the first layer after the input. So, the first layer (input to first hidden) has 1000 neurons. So each of those is connected to the 100 inputs. So, 100 * 1000 = 100,000 weights. Each of the 1000 neurons has a bias, so 1000 biases. So, total for first layer is 100,000 + 1000 = 101,000?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Because in each layer, the number of weights is (number of neurons) * (number of inputs from previous layer). But the bias is added for each neuron. So, each layer (except the output) has (number of neurons) * (number of inputs from previous) + (number of neurons) weights, because each neuron gets a bias.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Let's take the input layer as the first layer. Then the first hidden layer is the second. So, the input layer has 100 features. The first hidden layer has 1000 neurons. Each input feature is connected to all 1000 neurons. So, 100 * 1000 = 100,000 weights. And each of the 1000 neurons has a bias, so 1000 biases. So that's 100,000 + 1000 = 101,000 parameters for the first layer.

Wait, no. Wait, the first hidden layer is the second layer. So, the first layer is the input layer, which has 100 inputs. The next layer is the first hidden layer, which has 1000 neurons. So, the first hidden layer has 1000 neurons, each connected to all 100 inputs. So, the number of weights is 100 * 1000 = 100,000. Each of the 1000 neurons also has a bias, so 1000 biases. So, 100,000 + 1000 = 101,000 parameters for the first hidden layer.

Now, the second hidden layer. It has 10 neurons. Each of these is connected to the first hidden layer, which has 1000 neurons. So, the number of weights is 10 * 1000 = 10,000. Each of the 10 neurons also has a bias, so 10 biases. So, 10,000 + 10 = 10,010 parameters for the second layer.

Then, the output layer. It's a single neuron, so it's connected to the second hidden layerâ€™s 10 neurons. So, the number of weights is 10 * 1 = 10. And each of the 10 neurons has a bias, but wait, no: the output layer is a scalar, so it's just one neuron. So, each of the 10 neurons in the second hidden layer connects to this output. So, the total weights for output layer: 10 * 1 = 10. And 10 biases? Wait no, no. Wait, the output layer is a single neuron, so it's connected to the second hidden layer's 10 neurons. So, the number of weights is 10 (each of the 10 input to the output) multiplied by 1 (the output layer's output). So, 10 weights. Then, the output layer has one bias. So, 10 + 1 = 11 parameters for the output layer.

Now, let's sum all these up.

First hidden layer: 101,000
Second hidden layer: 10,010
Output layer: 11

Total parameters: 101,000 + 10,010 = 111,010; plus 11 gives 111,021.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 112110, which is higher than this. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me check again. Oh wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me recount.

Wait, maybe the output layer has parameters in a different way. Let me think: the output layer is a scalar, meaning it's a single neuron. So, it has 1 output unit. So, the number of weights is the number of inputs to it (which is 10, from the second hidden layer) multiplied by 1 (the output unit). So, 10 weights. Then, the output layer has 1 bias. So, total for the output layer is 11 parameters.

But wait, the options are A to J. Let's see.

Wait, the options are:

A: 120010
B: 111110
C: 100121
D: 112110
E: 110010
F: 110020
G: 122121
H: 110011
I: 111021
J: 130021

Wait, 111021 is option I. But according to my calculation, 101,000 + 10,010 + 11 is 111,021. So, that's option I.

Wait, but wait, another mistake: I think I might have miscalculated the first hidden layer's parameters. Let me re-calculate.

First hidden layer: 100 inputs, 1000 neurons.

Weights: 100 * 1000 = 100,000.

Biases: 1000.

So, 101,000. That's correct.

Second hidden layer: 1000 inputs, 10 neurons.

Weights: 1000 * 10 = 10,000.

Biases: 10.

So, 10,010.

Output layer: 10 inputs, 1 output.

Weights: 10.

Biases: 1.

So, 11.

Total: 101,000 + 10,010 = 111,010 + 11 = 111,021.

Looking at the options, option I is 111021. So, that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check because I might have missed something. Oh, wait, perhaps the first hidden layer is 1000, but the first hidden layer is after the input layer which has 100 features. So, the first hidden layer is 1000 neurons, each connected to 100 features. So, 100*1000 weights, and 1000 biases.

Yes, that's correct.

Another thing, perhaps the output layer is not 1, but 10? But no, the output is a scalar, so it's 1.

Wait, but the options don't have 111,021 as a correct one? Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 120010

B: 111110

C:100121

D:112110

E:110010

F:110020

G:122121

H:110011

I:111021

J:130021

Oh yes, option I is 111021.

So, the correct answer is I.

To determine the number of parameters in the fully connected neural network, we analyze each layer:

1. **Input Layer**:  
   - Input features: 100  
   - First hidden layer: 1000 neurons  
   - Weights: \(100 \times 1000 = 100,000\)  
   - Biases: 1000  
   - **Total for first hidden layer**: \(100,000 + 1000 = 101,000\)  

2. **Second Hidden Layer**:  
   - Second hidden layer: 10 neurons  
   - Weights: \(1000 \times 10 = 10,000\)  
   - Biases: 10  
   - **Total for second hidden layer**: \(10,000 + 10 = 10,010\)  

3. **Output Layer**:  
   - Output layer: 1 neuron  
   - Weights: \(10 \times 1 = 10\)  
   - Biases: 1  
   - **Total for output layer**: \(10 + 1 = 11\)  

4. **Total Parameters**:  
   - Summing all layers: \(101,000 + 10,010 + 11 = 111,021\).  

Thus, the total number of parameters in the network is **111,021**, which corresponds to option **I**.
