Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a capacitor losing charge over time. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the capacitor loses half its remaining charge every second. After five seconds, its charge is q. I need to find the initial charge.

Hmm, I remember that the charge on a capacitor decreases exponentially over time when discharging. The formula for charge as a function of time is Q(t) = Q0 * e^(-t/RC), where Q0 is the initial charge, R is resistance, and C is capacitance. But wait, in this problem, they're saying that every second the charge halves. Oh, that sounds like a different scenario, maybe where the discharge is modeled by a different formula.

Wait, if the charge halves every second, that's a different decay rate. So the charge is decreasing by a factor of 1/2 each second. So after one second, it's Q0/2. After two seconds, Q0/4, and so on. So after five seconds, it's Q0 / (2^5). Because each second it's multiplied by 1/2. So Q = Q0 / (2^5) = Q0 /32.

But wait, the problem says that after five seconds, the charge is q. So q = Q0 / 32. So to find Q0, I just rearrange that equation. Q0 = 32q.

Looking at the options, option I is 32q. So that should be the answer. But wait, are there any other factors I'm missing? Let me think again. Oh, right, the problem says it's a capacitor losing half its charge every second. So yes, the formula applies here. So I'm confident that the initial charge was 32q.

The charge on a capacitor discharging follows an exponential decay. However, in this specific scenario, the charge halves every second. After five seconds, the charge is q. Using the formula \( Q(t) = Q_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t \), we substitute \( t = 5 \) and \( Q(5) = q \), giving \( q = Q_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 \). Solving for \( Q_0 \), we find \( Q_0 = 32q \). Thus, the initial charge is \( 32q \), which corresponds to option I.

Answer: I
