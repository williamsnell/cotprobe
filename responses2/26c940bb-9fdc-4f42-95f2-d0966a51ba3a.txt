Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Anorexia Nervosa, and I need to figure out which option isn't a diagnostic feature. Let me start by recalling what I know about Anorexia Nervosa. It's a condition where someone experiences significant weight loss, specifically when their body is smaller than their body size. People with this condition often have emotional and psychological challenges.

The question lists eight options, and I need to identify which one isn't considered a diagnostic feature. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Sleep disorders. From what I remember, Anorexia Nervosa can affect sleep patterns. People might have trouble falling asleep, sleep apnea, or have irregular sleep schedules. So A is a feature, not the answer we're looking for.

Option B: Rapid heartbeat. I'm not sure about this one. I think heart rate variability is more about things like exercise or stress, but rapid heartbeat alone doesn't ring a bell as a specific feature of Anorexia Nervosa. Maybe it's a general observation, but I'm not certain if it's a diagnostic feature.

Option C: High blood pressure. I recall that Anorexia Nervosa is often associated with high blood pressure. People with the condition might have hypertension, so C is definitely a diagnostic feature.

Option D: Obsession with physical activity. That rings a bell. People with Anorexia Nervosa might get overly involved in physical activities, which is a type of obsession, so D is a feature.

Option E: Significant weight loss. This is the core of Anorexia Nervosa, so E is a feature.

Option F: Depressive symptoms. I'm not sure if this is a feature. Sometimes people with Anorexia Nervosa might have mood issues, but is that a diagnostic feature or just a symptom? I think it's considered a symptom rather than a feature. So this might be the answer.

Option G: Fear of becoming fat. This sounds like a coping mechanism or a coping strategy, which is more about how the individual reacts rather than a feature of the condition itself.

Option H: Body image distortion. This is a clear feature. People with Anorexia Nervosa often have an unbalanced body image, which is a key characteristic.

So, going back to the options, F is about significant weight loss, which is definitely a feature. The question is asking which is NOT considered a diagnostic feature, so F would be the answer because it's not a feature but a symptom. Alternatively, someone could argue that F is a symptom rather than a feature, but I think the question is asking which is not a diagnostic feature, meaning it's not a condition itself but a symptom. So F is the answer.

The correct answer is F: Depressive symptoms.
