Okay, let's see. I've got this math problem here: simplify (2 + 5)^2 minus 42. Hmm, I need to do that step by step. 

First, I remember that there's an order of operations, right? So, parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, I have 2 plus 5. Adding those together gives 7. So now the expression becomes 7 squared minus 42.

Next, I need to calculate 7 squared. I know that squaring means multiplying the number by itself, so 7 times 7. Let me do that: 7 times 7 is 49. So now the problem is 49 minus 42.

Wait, 49 minus 42. Let me subtract: 49 minus 40 is 9, and then minus 2 more makes 7. So the result is 7.

Looking at the options, option C is 7. So the correct answer should be C.
