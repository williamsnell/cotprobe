Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about projectile motion. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question is about finding the speed at impact when a projectile is fired with an initial speed of 200 m/s at a 60-degree angle. The options are given from A to J, each with different speeds.

Hmm, projectile motion. I remember that when you launch something, it follows a parabolic path. The key here is probably to find the speed just before it hits the ground, which is when the vertical displacement is zero. So, I think I need to break the motion into horizontal and vertical components.

Wait, right. The initial velocity can be split into horizontal (v0x) and vertical (v0y) components. The initial speed is 200 m/s at 60 degrees. So, v0x is 200 * cos(60°), and v0y is 200 * sin(60°). Let me calculate those.

Cos(60°) is 0.5, so v0x is 200 * 0.5 = 100 m/s. Sin(60°) is about 0.866, so v0y is 200 * 0.866 ≈ 173.2 m/s.

Now, when the projectile lands, its vertical velocity will be the same in magnitude but opposite in direction to the initial vertical velocity. So, the final vertical velocity (vy) at impact would be -173.2 m/s. But wait, direction doesn't matter for speed calculation because speed is scalar. So, the speed components are 100 m/s horizontal and 173.2 m/s vertical.

Wait, but wait, isn't there another thing to consider? Oh, right, the horizontal component of velocity remains constant throughout the flight because there's no acceleration (assuming we're neglecting air resistance). So, vx remains 100 m/s at impact.

So the speed at impact is the vector sum of the horizontal and vertical components. So, I can use the Pythagorean theorem here. That would be sqrt(vx^2 + vy^2). Let me plug in the numbers.

vx is 100, so 100 squared is 10,000. vy is 173.2, so 173.2 squared is approximately (since 173^2 is 30,000 roughly, but let me calculate it more accurately). 173 * 173: 170^2=28900, 3^2=9, and cross terms 2*170*3=1020. So (170+3)^2= 170^2 + 2*170*3 +3^2 = 28900 + 1020 +9= 29929. So that's 173.2 squared, but wait, 173.2 is sqrt(300) approximately, but let me compute 173.2^2 exactly. Wait, 173.2 is approximately sqrt(300), but maybe I should just take 173.2^2 = 300 * (1.732)^2. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it as (200 * sin(60))^2. Wait, 200^2 is 40,000. sin^2(60) is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. So 40,000 * 3/4 is 30,000. So, 173.2^2 is 30,000. Oh, that's convenient. So vy squared is 30,000. So, adding to vx^2 which is 10,000, we get 40,000. So the speed is sqrt(40,000) = 200 m/s. Wait, that's option F.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: when I calculated vy, I took the negative value, but speed is the magnitude, so the direction doesn't matter. So, the vertical component is 173.2 m/s downward, but speed is 173.2 m/s, same as 173.2 m/s upward. So the calculation is correct.

So the speed at impact is sqrt(100^2 + 173.2^2) = sqrt(10,000 + 30,000) = sqrt(40,000) = 200 m/s. So the correct answer should be F:200 m/s.

Let me think again. The initial speed is 200 m/s, and the vertical component squared plus horizontal component squared equals the initial speed squared. Wait, wait a moment. Oh, because if you have initial velocity as v0x and v0y, then their squares sum to v0^2. So, (v0x)^2 + (v0y)^2 = (200)^2 = 40,000. At impact, the horizontal component is still 100 m/s, and vertical is 173.2 m/s, so (100)^2 + (173.2)^2 = 10,000 +30,000=40,000. So the speed at impact is sqrt(40,000) which is 200 m/s. So yes, option F is correct.

To solve the problem of finding the speed at impact of a projectile launched with an initial speed of \( 200 \, \mathrm{m/s} \) at an angle of elevation of \( 60^\circ \), we break the motion into horizontal and vertical components.

1. **Initial velocity components**:
   - Horizontal component: \( v_{0x} = 200 \cdot \cos(60^\circ) = 100 \, \mathrm{m/s} \).
   - Vertical component: \( v_{0y} = 200 \cdot \sin(60^\circ) \approx 173.2 \, \mathrm{m/s} \).

2. **Vertical velocity at impact**:
   - At impact, the vertical velocity is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the initial vertical velocity: \( v_y = -173.2 \, \mathrm{m/s} \). However, since speed is a scalar quantity, the direction does not affect the calculation.

3. **Speed at impact**:
   - The horizontal component of velocity remains constant throughout the flight, so \( v_x = 100 \, \mathrm{m/s} \).
   - The total speed at impact is the magnitude of the velocity vector, calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     v_{\text{impact}} = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = \sqrt{100^2 + 173.2^2} = \sqrt{10,000 + 30,000} = \sqrt{40,000} = 200 \, \mathrm{m/s}.
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The speed at impact is \( 200 \, \mathrm{m/s} \), which corresponds to option F.
