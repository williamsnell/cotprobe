Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about postcolonialism and its distinguishing features from other perspectives on security. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

The question asks which option is NOT a defining feature of postcolonialism. The options are A through I. I need to figure out which one doesn't fit the postcolonial context.

First, I should recall what I know about postcolonialism. It's a term used in studies of colonialism, often focusing on the ways that colonial influences have shaped societies, especially regarding security and security-related issues. Postcolonialism tends to analyze how these colonial eras have affected the present, sometimes challenging traditional notions of sovereignty and security.

Looking at the options:

A: Focuses on economic factors in security. I remember that postcolonialism does consider economic factors, so this is a feature, not the answer.

B: Not predominantly or exclusively European. Postcolonialism is a broad term that includes non-欧洲 countries, so this is a defining feature.

C: Doesn't consider colonial history's influence. Wait, this seems counterintuitive. If you say a country doesn't consider colonial history, that might not be a defining feature. Because postcolonialism often examines and rejects colonial narratives, so maybe this is a feature, not the answer. Or perhaps it's a defining point.

D: Doesn't consider global inequality. I think postcolonialism does consider inequality, especially in the context of resource distribution and how it affects security. So this is probably a defining feature.

E: Refers to the nation as a referent object. I think postcolonialism does consider the nation, and maybe it's not a major war, which is a broader term. But I'm not sure about this. Wait, the question says it's not considering 'small wars,' but I think E is a defining point.

F: Focuses on violence. Yes, in many postcolonial analyses, violence is a key issue, especially in the context of colonialism and postcolonialism's often critical views on war and conflict.

G: Concentrates on bilateral issues. Hmm, I'm not sure. Postcolonialism might focus on multilateral issues because it's more about the global community rather than just two countries. So if G says it's bilateral, that might not be a defining feature.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Postcolonialism often looks at global issues, so perhaps it's more about multilateral rather than bilateral. So G might not be a defining feature.

H: Disregards cultural factors. I think this is a key point. Postcolonialism often questions and deconstructs the role of culture in security, seeing it as secondary. So this is a defining feature.

I: Considers asymmetric conflicts. I recall that postcolonialism does examine such conflicts, especially since they're more about global dynamics than local issues.

So going back to the options, the question asks which is NOT a defining feature. So which option is NOT a defining one.

Looking again:

Option C: Doesn't consider the influence of colonial history on current security issues. Wait, is that a feature? Because postcolonialists often critique colonial narratives, implying that colonial history doesn't influence current security. So if a country's security issues are not influenced by colonial history, it's a feature. So this is a defining feature, meaning C is not the answer.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT a feature. So the question is looking for the option that is NOT a defining aspect of postcolonialism.

Wait, let me think again. Each option is a statement about what postcolonialism includes or excludes.

Let me think about each option:

A: Economic factors are a key part of postcolonial studies. So this is a feature.

B: It's a defining feature because it's not predominantly European. So not the answer.

C: Doesn't consider colonial history. Wait, is that a feature? Or is that considered a defining point? Because postcolonialism often critiques colonial history, so perhaps this is a feature.

D: Doesn't consider global inequality. A defining feature because inequality is a key aspect.

E: Refers to the nation as a referent object. Another defining feature.

F: Focuses on violence. Definitely a defining point.

G: Concentrates on multilateral issues. Wait, perhaps G is not a defining feature. Because postcolonialism often emphasizes multilateral rather than bilateral. So if G says it's about bilateral, that might not be a defining feature.

H: Doesn't consider cultural factors. Definitely a key point, so it's a defining feature.

I: Considers asymmetric conflicts. I believe this is a key part.

So the options that are NOT defining features are the ones that don't describe a postcolonial perspective.

So looking for the option that is NOT a feature.

The question is which is NOT a defining feature. So which option is incorrect.

Option C: Doesn't consider colonial history. But I thought that's a defining feature. Because postcolonial analysis often challenges colonial narratives, which include colonial history's influence.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a feature. So if any of these options are incorrect, they're not features.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which is NOT a feature. So if any option is not a defining point.

Looking back, the question is which is NOT a feature.

So the options:

Which is NOT a defining feature.

So which of A to I is not a postcolonial concept.

Looking for the incorrect statement.

Option C: Doesn't consider colonial history. Wait, but I thought that was a defining point. So C is a defining feature, so it's not the answer.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine each statement.

Wait, I think I might have misread option C. The statement says "does not consider the influence of colonial history on current security issues." So is that a defining feature?

Wait, postcolonialism does often examine the impact of colonial history on security. So if they focus on it, it's a feature. So C's statement is a defining feature, so not the answer.

Wait, then the options that are not features would be the incorrect statements.

Wait, let me think again. For example, option G: "Postcolonialism concentrates on bilateral rather than multilateral security issues." Is this a defining feature? Because in postcolonialism, they tend to look at global issues, so perhaps they don't focus on bilateral. So this is a defining feature, so it's not the answer.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT a feature.

So let's think: the options are statements about what defines postcolonialism. So which statement is not a defining point.

Wait, perhaps option G is incorrect. If postcolonialism does not concentrate on bilateral, which is a multilateral concept, then G is incorrect. So G would be the answer because it's not a defining feature.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of each option in terms of whether it's a defining aspect.

A: Economic factors are a key part. So yes, defining.

B: Not predominantly European—yes, defining.

C: Doesn't consider colonial history. Hmm, but that's a defining feature. So C is a feature, not the answer.

D: Doesn't consider inequality, yes, a defining factor.

E: Refers to nation as referent object—yes, a defining point.

F: Focuses on violence—definitely a defining feature.

G: Concentrates on multilateral—yes, a defining feature.

H: Disregards culture—definitely a feature.

I: Asks about asymmetric conflicts—yes, a feature.

So which option is NOT a defining feature? Let's check. The question is which is NOT a feature.

Option C: Doesn't consider colonial history. But I thought that was a defining feature. So C is a defining feature, so it's not the answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the answer is G. Because maybe postcolonialism doesn't focus on multilateral issues. So option G is a statement that is incorrect because postcolonialism does focus on multilateral.

Wait, but let me try to think: postcolonialism tends to examine global polity, so when looking at security, they might not focus on just bilateral issues. So G is a statement that would not be a feature of postcolonialism. Therefore, G is the answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about whether it's a defining feature, not about a statement.

Wait, the question is "Which of the following ways is NOT a defining feature that distinguishes postcolonialism from other perspectives on security?"

So the options are statements. So for example, statement C: Doesn't consider colonial history. I think that is a defining feature because postcolonialists often reject colonial narratives, which include colonial history's influence.

So if a country's security is not influenced by colonial history, it's a defining feature. So C would not be the answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about what each statement is.

Wait, perhaps the answer is G. Because postcolonialism tends to analyze the global community rather than just bilateral relations. So option G says it focuses on bilateral rather than multilateral. If that's incorrect, then G is the answer.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

Which of these is NOT a feature of postcolonialism.

Postcolonialism tends to focus on global rather than just bilateral issues. So the statement G is incorrect. So G is the answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option G, as the question is about not being a defining feature.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a feature. So if G is incorrect, then it's the answer.

Alternatively, I'm getting confused. Let me think about each option again.

Option C: Doesn't consider colonial history. Is this a defining feature? Or is it a distinguishing feature?

I think that's a defining feature because postcolonial analysis often emphasizes that colonial history is not a valid influence on current security. So if a country's security issues are not influenced by colonial history, it's a defining feature. So option C is a defining feature; it's not the answer.

Okay, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what each feature entails.

Option G: Concentrates on multilateral. Postcolonialism generally looks at multilateral issues, so this is a feature. Therefore, G is not the answer.

Therefore, the incorrect statement is G. So the answer is G.
</think>

To determine which option is NOT a defining feature of postcolonialism, we analyze each statement:

- **Option A**: Focuses on economic factors in security studies. This is a defining feature of postcolonialism.
- **Option B**: Postcolonialism is not predominantly or exclusively European. This is a defining feature.
- **Option C**: Does not consider the influence of colonial history on current security issues. This is a defining feature, as postcolonialists often critique colonial narratives.
- **Option D**: Does not consider global inequality in security. This is a defining feature.
- **Option E**: Refers to the nation or community group as a valid referent object. This is a defining feature.
- **Option F**: Focuses on violence in world politics. This is a defining feature.
- **Option G**: Concentrates on bilateral rather than multilateral security issues. This is incorrect, as postcolonialism often emphasizes multilateral rather than bilateral issues.
- **Option H**: Disregards cultural factors in security studies. This is a defining feature.
- **Option I**: Considers asymmetric conflicts in security studies. This is a defining feature.

The statement that is NOT a defining feature is **Option G**, as postcolonialism typically focuses on multilateral rather than bilateral security issues.

**ANSWER: G**
