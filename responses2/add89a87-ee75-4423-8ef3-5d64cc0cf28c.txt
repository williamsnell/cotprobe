Okay, so I need to figure out the discount rate for this portable color television. Let me see. The product is listed at $280, and the net price is $196. Hmm, the net price is the price after the discount has been applied, right? So the discount rate is the percentage reduction from the original price to the net price.

First, I should find out how much the discount is in absolute terms and then express that as a percentage of the original price. The discount amount would be the original price minus the net price. So that's 280 minus 196. Let me calculate that: 280 - 196 equals 84. So the discount is $84.

Now, to find the discount rate, I take that discount amount and divide it by the original price. So 84 divided by 280. Let me do that division. 84 รท 280 equals 0.3. To express that as a percentage, I multiply by 100, so 0.3 * 100 is 30%. So the discount rate is 30%.

Looking at the options, option B is 30%. So the correct answer should be B.

The discount rate is calculated by finding the difference between the original price and the net price, then dividing by the original price and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.

1. **Calculate the discount amount**: 280 - 196 = 84  
2. **Calculate the discount rate**: (84 / 280) * 100 = 30%.  

**Answer: B: 30%**

Answer:
     B
