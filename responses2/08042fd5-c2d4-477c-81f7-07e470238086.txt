Okay, so I have this question about Morse code and how many distinct symbols can be represented with sequences of 1, 2, 3, or 4 dots and dashes. Hmm, I remember that Morse code uses dots (.) and dashes (-) to represent letters, numbers, and special characters. Each symbol is a unique combination of these elements.

Wait, so the question is about the total number of distinct symbols possible with up to four elements. Each element can be either a dot or a dash. So I think this is a problem about combinations with two choices each position.

Let me think: for each position in the sequence, there are 2 options. So for a sequence of length n, the number of possibilities is 2^n. But wait, Morse code allows up to 4 elements, so I need to calculate the total for sequences of 1, 2, 3, and 4 elements.

So that would be the sum of 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4. Let me compute that. 2^1 is 2, 2^2 is 4, 2^3 is 8, and 2^4 is 16. Adding those up: 2 + 4 is 6, plus 8 is 14, plus 16 is 30. So that's 30 distinct symbols.

Wait, but wait a second. I remember that Morse code also includes the space character, which is represented by four dashes. So is that included in this count? Because the question says up to 4 elements, so yes, four dashes counts as a valid symbol. So 30 seems right.

Looking back at the options, let me check. The options are A:40, B:20, C:15, D:10, E:30, F:4680, G:100, H:3, I:50, J:60.

So E is 30, which matches my calculation.

The correct answer is **30**, which corresponds to option **E**. This is calculated as the sum of 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4, which equals 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30.

Answer: E
