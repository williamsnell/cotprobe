Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the price level and whether last year was an inflationary or deflationary period.

Alright, the data given is: real output of goods and services was $1600 billion last year. The money supply was $500 billion, and the velocity of money was 4. I need to find the price level and determine if it was inflationary or deflationary.

Hmm, I remember there's a formula related to this. Oh right, the quantity theory of money. The basic equation is something like MV = PY. Let me think about the exact formula.

Wait, the correct equation is:

MV = PY

Where:
- M is the money supply,
- V is the velocity of money,
- P is the price level,
- Y is the real output (GDP).

So, rearranging for P, the price level, the formula becomes:

P = (MV) / Y

Wait, but let me make sure. Yeah, that's right. Because if you rearrange MV = PY, you get P = (M*V)/Y.

So plugging in the numbers:

M is $500 billion. V is 4, and Y is $1600 billion.

So P = (500 * 4) / 1600

Let me compute that. 500 multiplied by 4 is 2000. Then 2000 divided by 1600.

Wait, 2000 divided by 1600. Let's see, 2000 ÷ 1600. Hmm. 1600 goes into 2000 once with 400 left over. So that's 1.25. Because 1600 * 1.25 = 2000. Yeah, because 1600 * 1 is 1600, and 1600 * 0.25 is 400. So total 2000.

So P is 1.25. So the price level is 1.25.

Now, what about the inflation or deflation? Well, the price level is a percentage change from the previous year. But wait, in this case, I don't have data from the previous year. So I can't compute the percentage change. Oh, that's a problem. The question is asking whether it was inflationary or deflationary, but without the previous year's price level, I can't tell.

Wait, but the question is asking for the price level and the period. So the options include things like 1.25, which is the calculated price level, and then options about inflationary or deflationary. But without knowing the previous year's price level, I can't determine if it was inflation or deflation. So the price level is 1.25, but the question is about whether it was inflationary or deflationary. Since I can't compute the change, I don't have enough information. So the correct answer is A: 1.25, Not enough information.

Wait, but wait, the options might have other possibilities. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 1.25, Not enough information
B: 0.8, Inflationary
C: 2.5, Inflationary
D: 2, Stable
E: 1.6, Deflationary
F: 3, Deflationary
G: 1.5, Not enough
H: 1.25, Inflationary
I: 2, Not enough
J: 1, Not enough

Hmm, wait, the correct calculation gives 1.25. So option A says that and 'Not enough information'—so that's correct because I can't determine the period without the previous year's data. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: Sometimes, the formula is PV = M * V = PY. But let me double-check the units. M is in dollars, V is velocity, Y is real GDP, so P is a ratio (price level), which is unitless. So, in the formula:

M (dollars) * V (unitless) = P (unitless) * Y (dollars)

So M*V = PY → P = (M*V)/Y.

Yes, that's correct.

So the price level is 1.25. So the options that have 1.25 are options A and H. Option A says 'Not enough information' and H says 1.25 and 'Inflationary period.'

Wait, but the question is whether it was inflationary or deflationary. Without the previous year's price level, I can't compute the change. So the answer should be that I don't have enough information. So option A is correct.

So the price level would be 1.25, and the period is not enough info. So the answer is option A.
</think>

To determine the price level and the inflationary or deflationary period, we use the quantity theory of money formula: 

\[ MV = PY \]

Rearranging for \( P \), the price level:

\[ P = \frac{MV}{Y} \]

Given:
- \( M = \$500 \) billion
- \( V = 4 \)
- \( Y = \$1600 \) billion

Calculating \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{500 \times 4}{1600} = \frac{2000}{1600} = 1.25 \]

The price level is \( 1.25 \). However, the question asks whether the period was inflationary or deflationary. Without knowing the previous year's price level, we cannot determine the change in prices. Therefore, the correct answer is:

- Price level: 1.25
- Not enough information to determine inflationary or deflationary period.
