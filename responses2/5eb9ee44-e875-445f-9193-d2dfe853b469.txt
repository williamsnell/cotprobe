Okay, so I have this problem here. It says: In the xy-plane, the graph of x^(log y) = y^(log x) is... and then there are options A through J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the equation. It's x raised to the log y equals y raised to the log x. Both sides are exponents with logarithms as their exponents. Maybe I can take the logarithm of both sides to simplify this.

Taking natural logs on both sides. Let me do that step by step. So, ln(x^(log y)) equals ln(y^(log x)). Using the logarithm power rule, that becomes (log y) * ln(x) = (log x) * ln(y). 

Wait, log here—does it mean base 10 or natural logarithm? The problem doesn't specify, but often in math problems unless stated otherwise, log is natural log. But sometimes it's base 10. Hmm, but maybe regardless, the equation would look similar.

So, the equation simplifies to (log y) * ln x = (log x) * ln y. Let me rearrange this. Let me write it as (ln y) / (log y) = (ln x) / (log x). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me see: If I divide both sides by (log y) * (ln x), I get 1 = (log x)/(log y) * (ln y)/(ln x). Wait, maybe that's complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express log y and log x in terms of natural logs. Let me denote log as ln for natural log for simplicity. So, (ln y) / (ln x) = (ln x) / (ln y). Let me set this ratio as some variable. Let’s say k = (ln y)/(ln x). Then, the equation becomes k = 1/k, which implies k^2 = 1, so k = 1 or k = -1.

So, two cases: when (ln y)/(ln x) = 1 and when it's -1.

Case 1: (ln y)/(ln x) = 1 → ln y = ln x → y = x.

Case 2: (ln y)/(ln x) = -1 → ln y = -ln x → ln y = ln(1/x) → y = 1/x.

Wait, but wait a second. The original equation is x^(log y) = y^(log x). Let me test x = y. Let's plug in x = y into the original equation. Left side becomes x^(log x). Right side also is x^(log x). So, yes, it's valid. So, y = x is a solution.

Now, the other case: y = 1/x. Let's test x = 2, y = 1/2. Then, original equation: x^(log y) = 2^(log(1/2)) = 2^(-log 2) = 2^(-log 2). Similarly, y^(log x) = (1/2)^(log 2) = (1/2)^(log 2) = 2^(-log 2). So both sides are equal, so y = 1/x is a solution.

Wait a minute, does that mean that the solutions are lines y = x and y = 1/x?

But wait, the options given don't include multiple lines. The options are single curve or points or closed loops. So, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I can take both sides to the power of 1/(log x log y) or something. Let me go back to the original equation: x^(log y) = y^(log x).

Another approach: Let's take logs of both sides again, but perhaps in a different way. Let me rewrite the original equation:

x^{log y} = y^{log x}.

Let me write both sides as exponentials. Alternatively, maybe express the equation with exponents in terms of x and y. Let's take both sides to the power of 1/(log x * log y) to see if that helps. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write each side as e^{ln(x^{log y})} = e^{ln(y^{log x})}.

Which simplifies to e^{(log y)(ln x)} = e^{(log x)(ln y)}.

Since the exponents must be equal, we have (log y)(ln x) = (log x)(ln y).

Let me rearrange this equation: (ln x)(log y) - (ln y)(log x) = 0.

Hmm, perhaps factor this differently. Let me factor out (ln x)(ln y):

Wait, perhaps it's better to express log y as (ln y)/(ln 10) if log is base 10, but without knowing, perhaps I can consider log as log base a certain base, but perhaps it's better to let’s suppose that log is log base same as x or y. Alternatively, perhaps I can divide both sides by (ln x)(ln y), but only if they are not zero.

Wait, but if ln x is zero, that would imply x=1, same with ln y. Hmm, but let me proceed. Let me denote a = log x, b = log y. Then, the equation becomes:

a * ln x = b * ln y. But ln x is a * ln 10 (if log is base 10), but perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps take both sides to the power of 1/(log x * log y), but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the equation x^{log y} = y^{log x}. Let me take both sides as a ratio: x^{log y} / y^{log x} = 1.

Alternatively, let me take logs again:

ln(x^{log y}) = ln(y^{log x}).

Which gives (log y) * ln x = (log x) * ln y.

Hmm, perhaps express everything in terms of ln x and ln y.

Let’s let u = ln x and v = ln y.

Then, the equation becomes v * u = u * v. Which is 0=0? Wait, that can't be right because that would imply that the equation holds for any x and y, which is not the case.

Wait, that must mean I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, wait, u = ln x, v = ln y.

Then, the equation is v * u = u * v. Which is always true, so that means that the equation x^{log y} = y^{log x} is an identity, which is not possible because it's not true for all x and y.

Wait, but that can't be. So, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me go back. The original equation is x^(a) = y^(b), where a = log y and b = log x. So, x^a = y^b.

But since a = log y and b = log x, so x^{log y} = y^{log x}.

Wait, but if a = log y and b = log x, then the equation is x^a = y^b = x^{a} = y^{a}.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I can express y^{log x} as x^{something}.

Wait, perhaps I can write y^{log x} as e^{(log x)(ln y)}, and x^{log y} as e^{(log y)(ln x)}. So, the equation becomes e^{(log y)(ln x)} = e^{(log x)(ln y)}. So, the exponents must be equal, so:

(log y)(ln x) = (log x)(ln y).

Hmm, let me rearrange this equation. Let's divide both sides by (log x)(log y), assuming neither is zero. So:

[ (log y) / (log x) ) ] = (ln y) / (ln x).

But log y / log x is log_x y, and ln y / ln x is log_x y as well, because log_x y = (ln y)/(ln x). So, this equation simplifies to log_x y = log_x y, which is always true. So that suggests that any x and y that satisfy x^{log y} = y^{log x} are valid, but that can't be right because, for example, if x = y, then both sides are x^{log x} = x^{log x}, so that's valid. Similarly, if x = 1, then 1^{log y} = 1, and y^{log 1} = y^0 = 1, so 1=1, which is valid. If x=10, y=100: x^{log y} = 10^{log 100} = 10^2 = 100, and y^{log x} = 100^{log 10} = 100^1 = 100. So that works. 

Wait, but what about x=2, y=1/2? Let's check: x^{log y} = 2^{log(1/2)} = 2^{-log 2} ≈ 2^{-0.3010} ≈ 0.5. Similarly, y^{log x} = (1/2)^{log 2} = (1/2)^{0.3010} ≈ 0.5. So, 0.5 = 0.5. That works.

Wait, so it seems that any x and y that satisfy x^{log y} = y^{log x} are valid. But that's not possible because it's not an identity; it's a conditional equation. So, perhaps the equation simplifies to some constraint. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me try a different approach. Let me rewrite the original equation:

x^{log y} = y^{log x}.

Let me take both sides to the power of 1/(log x * log y). So, that would give:

(x^{log y})^{1/(log x log y)} = (y^{log x})^{1/(log x log y)}.

Which simplifies to x^{(log y)/(log x log y)} = y^{(log x)/(log x log y)}.

Which is x^{1/(log x)} = y^{1/(log y)}.

But 1/(log x) is the reciprocal of log x. Let me denote a = log x and b = log y.

So, the equation becomes x^{1/a} = y^{1/b}.

But x = 10^a (if log is base 10), and y = 10^b.

Substituting, (10^a)^{1/a} = (10^b)^{1/b} → 10^{a*(1/a)} = 10^{b*(1/b)} → 10^{1} = 10^{1}, which is 10=10. So, that's valid for any a and b. But that suggests again that the equation is always true, which can't be right because the equation x^{log y} = y^{log x} isn't always true.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try plugging in specific numbers. Let me choose x=2, y=2. Then, 2^{log 2} = 2^{log 2}, which is true.

Another example: x=4, y=16. 4^{log 16} = 4^(1.204) ≈ 4^1.204 ≈ 4^1 * 4^0.204 ≈ 4 * ~1.3 ≈5.2. On the other side, y^{log x} = 16^{log4} = 16^(0.602) ≈ 16^0.602 ≈ (2^4)^0.602 ≈ 2^(4*0.602) ≈ 2^2.408 ≈ about 5.2. So, that's equal.

Wait, so perhaps the equation holds for any x and y? But that can't be right because x^{log y} = y^{log x} is not an identity. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial algebra.

Wait, let me try taking the original equation: x^{log y} = y^{log x}.

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides again. So, ln(x^{log y}) = ln(y^{log x}).

Which is (log y) * ln x = (log x) * ln y.

Let me rearrange this as: (ln x)/(ln y) = (log x)/(log y).

Wait, that's because (log y) = (ln y)/(ln 10) and (log x) = (ln x)/(ln 10). So, substituting:

(ln x)/(ln y) = ( (ln x)/(ln 10) ) / ( (ln y)/(ln 10) ) )

Which simplifies to (ln x)/(ln y) = (ln x)/(ln y). So, again, this is an identity, which suggests that any x and y satisfy the equation.

Wait, but that can't be true because, for example, if x=10 and y=100, then x^{log y} = 10^{log 100} = 10^2 = 100, and y^{log x} = 100^{log 10} = 100^1 = 100. So, that works.

If x=10 and y=10, then both sides are 10^{1} = 10 and 10^{1} = 10. So, that works.

But if x=10 and y=1, then x^{log y} =10^{0}=1, and y^{log x}=1^{1}=1. So, that works.

Wait, so maybe the equation holds for any x and y? But that can't be correct because when I plug in x=2 and y=1/2, the equation holds as I saw earlier. So perhaps the equation is an identity, meaning any x and y satisfy it. But that can't be right because when I thought about x=2 and y=1/2, it worked. So, perhaps the equation is always true, but that's not possible because the problem states it's a graph, implying it's a specific curve.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me think again. Maybe I should substitute variables differently.

Let me let’s set x = y. Then, the equation becomes x^{log x} = x^{log x}, which holds.

Alternatively, let me set x = a and y = b, and try to see what the equation says. Or perhaps I can write the equation as x^{log y} = y^{log x} and then take both sides to the power of 1/(log x log y), but that again leads to 1=1.

Wait, but maybe I can take the equation and write it as (log y) / (log x) = (log x)/(log y), which would imply that (log y)^2 = (log x)^2, so log y = ± log x.

So, that would lead to two cases:

Case 1: log y = log x → y = x.

Case 2: log y = - log x → log y = log (1/x) → y = 1/x.

So, the solutions are the lines y = x and y = 1/x.

But wait, but looking at the original equation, perhaps these are the only solutions. Because when I tried plugging in other numbers, like x=2, y=1/2, it worked. So, perhaps the graph is the union of these two lines. So, the graph would consist of y = x and y = 1/x.

But wait, the options don't include both lines and hyperbola. Option E is a ray in the open first quadrant, which would be y = x for x>0. Similarly, option F is an open second quadrant, which is x<0, y>0. Option D is the entire plane, which seems unlikely. Option G is the open first quadrant.

Wait, the open first quadrant would be x>0 and y>0. So, if the graph is y = x and y = 1/x, then in the first quadrant, y=x is a ray from (0,0) to infinity, and y=1/x is a hyperbola in the first quadrant. But perhaps the equation in the first quadrant has only y=x as a solution, because y=1/x is valid as well.

Wait, but in the equation x^{log y} = y^{log x}, does y=1/x satisfy for all x>0 except x=1? Let me test x=2, y=1/2: as before, x^{log y}=2^{log(1/2)}=2^{-log 2}= approx 0.5. Similarly, y^{log x}=(1/2)^{log 2}=approx 0.5. So, it's valid.

So, the solutions are y=x and y=1/x. So, the graph is the union of these two lines. But in the first quadrant, both lines are present except at x=1 where they intersect. So, the graph would consist of y=x and y=1/x in the first quadrant. But looking at the options, option E is a ray in the open first quadrant, which is y=x. Option G is the open first quadrant, which includes both lines. However, maybe y=1/x is not part of the graph.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back. When I took logarithms, I got (log y)/(log x) = (log x)/(log y), which implies (log y)^2 = (log x)^2, so log y = ± log x. So, log y = log x → y=x. Or log y = - log x → log y = log(1/x) → y=1/x.

Now, let me see if these are the only solutions. Suppose I take x=3, y=3/2. Let's compute both sides.

x^{log y} =3^{log(3/2)}. Let me compute log(3/2)= log 1.5≈0.176.

So, 3^0.176≈ e^{0.176 * ln3} ≈ e^{0.176*1.0986}≈e^{0.194}≈1.213.

Similarly, y^{log x}=(3/2)^{log3}. log3≈0.477.

(3/2)^{0.477}= e^{0.477 * ln(1.5)}≈e^{0.477*0.4055}≈e^{0.194}≈1.213. So, both sides are equal.

Wait, so perhaps the graph is the union of y=x and y=1/x. But let me look at the options. Option D is the entire plane, which is likely incorrect. Option E is a ray in the open first quadrant, which is y=x for x>0. Option G is the open first quadrant, which includes both lines. Option F is an open second quadrant, which is x<0, y>0. Option A is the origin. Option B is the x-axis. Option C is the y-axis. Option J is the entire plane, which we know is incorrect.

Wait, in the first quadrant, the graph is y=x and y=1/x. But the options don't have 'both lines' or 'the union of lines and hyperbola' options. Let me check the options again.

Options given:

A) The origin.

B) The x-axis.

C) The y-axis.

D) The entire plane.

E) A ray in the open first quadrant.

F) An open second quadrant.

G) The open first quadrant.

H) The entire plane.

Wait, none of the options say 'the union of y=x and y=1/x' but maybe option G is the open first quadrant, which includes the hyperbola y=1/x and the line y=x. So, perhaps option G is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the graph is only y=x in the first quadrant, making option E correct. But wait, earlier I saw that y=1/x is also a solution. So, perhaps the correct graph is the union of y=x and y=1/x, which is option G.

Wait, but let me look back at the original equation. Maybe I should think of x^{log y} = y^{log x} as (log y) / (log x) = 1. So, log y = log x → y = x, but that's only in the case where log x ≠ log y. Alternatively, if log y = - log x, then y = 1/x.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the equation x^{log y} = y^{log x} as (log y)/log x = (log x)/log y, which implies (log y)^2 = (log x)^2, leading to log y = ± log x, which are the cases y =x and y=1/x.

So, the graph is y =x and y=1/x. In the first quadrant, y=x is a ray starting at (0,0), and y=1/x is a hyperbola. So, the entire graph in the first quadrant would include both lines. So, the correct answer is option G: The open first quadrant.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is a ray in the open first quadrant, which would be y=x. So, perhaps option G is the correct answer because it includes both lines.

Alternatively, perhaps the graph is a single curve, but I think it's two lines. So, I think the correct answer is option G: The open first quadrant.
</think>

The correct answer is G) The open first quadrant.

**Explanation:**

The given equation is \( x^{\log y} = y^{\log x} \). To analyze its graph, we proceed as follows:

1. **Take the natural logarithm of both sides:**
   \[
   \ln(x^{\log y}) = \ln(y^{\log x})
   \]
   Simplifying using the property \(\ln(a^b) = b \ln a\):
   \[
   (\log y) \ln x = (\log x) \ln y
   \]

2. **Rearrange the equation:**
   \[
   (\log y) \ln x - (\log x) \ln y = 0
   \]
   Factor out common terms:
   \[
   (\log x)(\log y)(\frac{1}{\log x} - \frac{1}{\log y}) = 0
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \log x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \log y = 0
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   x = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 1
   \]

3. **Analyze the solutions:**
   - The line \( y = x \) is valid for \( x > 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), which lies in the open first quadrant.
   - The hyperbola \( y = \frac{1}{x} \) is also valid for \( x > 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), lying in the open first quadrant.

4. **Conclusion:**
   The graph of the equation \( x^{\log y} = y^{\log x} \) in the open first quadrant consists of the line \( y = x \) (option E) and the hyperbola \( y = \frac{1}{x} \) (option G). However, since the problem asks for the graph in the open first quadrant, the correct answer is G) The open first quadrant.

ANSWER: G
