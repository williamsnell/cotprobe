Okay, so I have this question about the Role-Learning Theory, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about this theory. I remember that role-learning theory has to do with how people acquire their roles in a society or organization.

I think the theory is about how people become aware of their roles through various forms of interaction. So, what's the basic idea? I believe it suggests that roles are learned through observation and practice. That would mean that people either observe others doing things or they take on responsibilities through their actions.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: We learn our roles through observation only. Hmm, I'm not sure. I remember hearing that sometimes people learn roles through observation, but maybe it's not the only way. There might be other methods too.

Option B: Roles are learned through punishment and reward systems. Wait, no, role-learning theory is more about internalization and observation, not solely through rewards. Punishment systems are more about behavior management, not the learning of roles.

Option C: Social roles are fixed and singular. That doesn't sound right. I think social roles are more flexible and can change. Also, I don't recall the theory saying they're fixed.

Option D: Role-learning theory is not related to social roles but to professional roles. That doesn't make sense because the theory is about social roles, like in an organization. So D seems incorrect.

Option E: We internalise and take on social roles from a pre-existing framework. This rings a bell. I think internalizing means we take on roles based on our own experiences and knowledge, which could be from a previous social structure or framework. So E might be correct.

Option F: Roles have to be learned to suppress unconscious motivations. I'm not sure about this. Role learning is about internalizing and becoming aware of roles, not suppressing motives. I think the suppression part might be more about career choices or something else.

Option G: Social roles are predetermined and cannot be changed. No, I think social roles are flexible and can change based on individual circumstances and interactions.

Option H: Roles are not learned but are innate to each individual. No, I'm pretty sure role learning is a process, not pre-existing. Innate might refer more to biological aspects, not the learning process.

Putting it together, the correct answer should be E. It aligns with the idea that roles are learned through internalization from a social framework. So the answer should have E as the correct option.
