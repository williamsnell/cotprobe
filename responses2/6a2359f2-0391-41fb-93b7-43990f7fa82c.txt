Question:

A placebo-controlled clinical trial is conducted to assess whether a new antihypertensive drug is more effective than standard therapy. A total of 5000 patients with essential hypertension are enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two groups: 2500 patients receive the new drug and 2500 patients receive placebo. If the alpha is set at 0.01 instead of 0.05, which of the following is the most likely result?

Options:

A: The study will have less power
B: The study will require fewer participants
C: There is an increased likelihood of statistically significant findings
D: The study will be less reliable
E: Significant findings can be reported with greater confidence
F: The placebo effect will be more pronounced
G: The study will have more power
H: There is a decreased likelihood of statistically significant findings

Alright, so I'm looking at this question about a clinical trial. Okay, let's break it down. The scenario is a placebo-controlled trial assessing a new antihypertensive drug compared to standard therapy. They have 5000 patients, split equally into two groups of 2500 each. The alpha level is being changed from 0.05 to 0.01. The question is about what this change means in terms of the study's power, participants, and reliability.

Hmm, I remember that alpha is the significance level, which is the probability of a Type I error—rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true. A lower alpha (like 0.01 instead of 0.05) makes it harder to reject the null. So the study has a lower threshold for significance. That typically means that the threshold for finding a statistically significant result is more stringent. 

So power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative is true. Power is influenced by several factors, including sample size, effect size, alpha level, and the true effect size. 

In this case, the sample size is fixed at 2500 in each group. If alpha is decreased, the power might decrease because you're requiring a stronger effect to be significant. Wait, but wait. Actually, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Lower alpha (0.01) means you're more likely to have a Type II error (failing to reject when there is a real effect), which lowers the power. Because lower power means the study is less likely to detect a true effect. So, if you set alpha lower, you might not get as much power. So the study would be less likely to find a significant effect when there is one, thus having less power.

Looking at the options, option A says the study will have less power. That sounds right. Because with a lower alpha, it's harder to achieve significance, so power decreases. 

Option C says there's an increased likelihood of significant findings. That's the opposite; lower power means fewer significant findings, not more.

Option E says findings can be reported with greater confidence. That's about significance, but also about confidence intervals. Wait, confidence in the results depends on the effect size and the study's power. Lower power means confidence in the effect's size is limited—so results aren't as confidently reported. But the question is about whether findings can be reported with greater confidence. Hmm. Wait, no. If the study is less powered, you can't be as confident in the effect. So E might not be correct.

Option D says the study will be less reliable. Reliability refers to the consistency of the results. If the study has lower power, it's less likely to find a true effect, so results might not be as reliable. So D could be a contender. But the question is about the most likely result.

Wait, the question is about the 'most likely result'—so which is more likely when alpha is set lower. Let's recap: Lower alpha (0.01) makes it harder to reject the null, so when the true effect exists, it's less likely to become significant. So the study's power decreases because it's harder to reach significance. So the study is less likely to find a significant result when the effect exists. So the most likely result is that the study will have less power. So option A.

But wait, another point: the effect size. If the effect is larger, then a lower alpha would still make it more likely to detect it. But the question doesn't mention the effect size. So assuming the true effect is present, lower alpha reduces power.

So the correct answer should be A: The study will have less power.

The correct answer is A: The study will have less power. By lowering the alpha level from 0.05 to 0.01, the study becomes more stringent in rejecting the null hypothesis, which reduces the study's power to detect a true effect. This means the likelihood of finding a statistically significant result when there is one decreases.

Answer: A
