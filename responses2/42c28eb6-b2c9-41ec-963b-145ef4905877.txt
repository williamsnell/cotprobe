Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about estimating the standard reaction Gibbs energy (ΔG°) of the reaction N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) → 2NH₃(g) at 1000 K using their values at 298 K. The options are given from A to J, and each is a certain value in kJ/mol.

Hmm. I remember that Gibbs free energy changes are related to the equilibrium of a reaction. Oh wait, the van 't Hoff equation comes into play here, right? Because we're dealing with a change in temperature from 298K to 1000K. But wait, the question is about the standard Gibbs energy at a different temperature, so I probably need to find how ΔG changes with temperature.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the standard Gibbs energy at a different temperature isn't just ΔH and ΔS multiplied by T and then added or something. Oh, right! The Gibbs free energy equation is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. But wait, that's at a particular temperature. So for each temperature, it's ΔG(T) = ΔH + (ΔS - R ln T), or something like that. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The van 't Hoff equation relates the change in the equilibrium constant with temperature. The equation is ln(K) = -ΔH/(R T) + ΔS/(R). But wait, we're dealing with Gibbs free energy at a different temperature. Alternatively, the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction at a different temperature can be approximated using the relation ΔG°(T) = ΔH° - TΔS°. But wait, that's only if the reaction is at equilibrium, which it isn't. So I think that's not the right approach here.

Alternatively, the change in ΔG between two temperatures can be found using the van 't Hoff equation. Let me recall that. The equation is d(ln K)/dT = ΔH/(ΔS) * (1/T²) - ΔH/(ΔS) * (1/(T^2)) ... Wait, maybe I should remember the van 't Hoff equation correctly. It's ln K = -ΔH/(R T) + ΔS/(R). So taking the derivative with respect to T, the d(ln K)/dT is (-ΔH/(R T²)) - (ΔS/R). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

The van 't Hoff equation is derived from the Gibbs free energy equation. The equation is:

ln K = (-ΔH°)/(R T) + (ΔS°)/R.

Taking the derivative of ln K with respect to T, we get:

d(ln K)/dT = (-ΔH°)/(R T²) + (ΔS°)/(R).

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach for this problem. Alternatively, I can use the approximation for small changes in temperature. Let me consider that the change in ΔG°(T) with temperature can be estimated using the heat capacity? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, another approach. The formula for the change in Gibbs energy when the temperature changes can be found using the equation:

ΔG(T2) = ΔG(T1) + ΔH°(T1) * (T2 - T1)/(T2) + [ΔS°(T1) - ΔS°(T2)] * (T2 - T1)/T1.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to consider that the Gibbs free energy change is a function of temperature. The equation for ΔG(T) is ΔG(T) = ΔG°(T) = ΔH° - TΔS°(T). Wait, but wait, ΔH° and ΔS° are supposed to be constant in this case because the problem states that all gases are perfect, implying that temperature doesn't change the heat capacities significantly. So, assuming ΔH° and ΔS° are constant with temperature, the Gibbs free energy change at a different temperature can be approximated.

So, the formula would be:

ΔG°(T2) = ΔG°(T1) + (ΔH° - T1ΔS°)(T2 - T1)/T1.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up some formulas. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the equation for the change in ΔG when temperature changes from T1 to T2 is:

ΔG(T2) = ΔG(T1) + (ΔH° - T1ΔS°)(T2 - T1)/T1.

Wait, I'm not entirely confident, but I think that's the correct approach.

Wait, wait. Let me think in terms of the van 't Hoff equation. The van 't Hoff equation is ln(K2/K1) = (ΔS°)/(R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) + (ΔH°)/(R) (1/T2 - 1/T1) * ... Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to approach this step by step.

First, calculate the standard Gibbs energy change at 298 K, which is ΔG°(298 K). Then, use the van 't Hoff equation to find the change in ΔG° when the temperature increases to 1000 K.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the necessary data. I need to know ΔH° and ΔS° for the reaction. Let's look up the standard enthalpy and entropy changes for the reaction N₂(g) + 3 H₂(g) → 2 NH₃(g).

Wait, but I don't remember the exact values. Let me think. From what I remember, the standard enthalpy change for the formation of NH3 is about -45.6 kJ/mol. Because the enthalpy of formation of N₂ and H₂ is zero, and that of NH3 is -45.6.

So, the reaction is N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3.

The enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔH°) would be 2*(-45.6) = -91.2 kJ/mol.

Wait, no, wait. Because the reaction is 1 mole of N2 and 3 H2. So each mole of NH3 has ΔH° of -45.6, so 2 moles would be 2*(-45.6) = -91.2 kJ. So ΔH° = -91.2 kJ/mol.

Now, the entropy change. The standard entropy change for the reaction is ΔS° = [2 * S°(NH3)] - [S°(N2) + 3 * S°(H2)].

I think the standard entropy values (S° in J/mol·K) are approximately:

S°(N2) ≈ 191.6 J/mol·K.

S°(H2) ≈ 130.7 J/mol·K.

S°(NH3) ≈ 192.4 J/mol·K.

So putting that in:

ΔS° = [2 * 192.4] - [191.6 + 3 * 130.7].

Calculating:

= (384.8) - (191.6 + 392.1)
= 384.8 - (583.7)
= -198.9 J/mol·K.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. Because 2 * 192.4 is about 384.8. 191.6 + 3*130.7: 3*130.7 is 392.1, plus 191.6 is 583.7. 384.8 - 583.7 is indeed -198.9 J/(mol·K). So, approximately -198.9 J/(mol·K).

Wait, but wait, another way: 2 * NH3 is 2*(192.4) = 384.8. N2 is 191.6, H2 is 3 * 130.7 = 392.1. So 384.8 - (191.6 + 392.1) = 384.8 - 583.7= -198.9 J/(mol·K).

So, ΔS° is -198.9 J/(mol·K) = -0.1989 kJ/(mol·K).

Wait, but wait, standard molar entropy is in J/(mol·K), right? So ΔS is in J/(mol·K) as well. So -198.9 J/(mol·K) = -0.1989 kJ/(mol·K).

So, now, let's plug into the formula for ΔG°(T) = ΔH° - TΔS°.

Wait, no, wait. Because the Gibbs free energy at a temperature T is given by ΔG°(T) = ΔH° - T*ΔS°. But wait, because ΔH and ΔS are for the reaction at 298 K. Wait, but wait, in the van 't Hoff equation, that's the case.

Wait, no, let me clarify. The ΔG°(T) is calculated using the same ΔH° and ΔS°, which are the standard enthalpy and entropy changes at 298 K. So for our reaction, ΔH° is -91.2 kJ/mol, and ΔS° is -0.1989 kJ/(mol·K).

Wait, but wait, wait a second. The formula is correct? Because I thought that ΔG°(T) = ΔH° - TΔS°, but wait, that's only when the reaction is at equilibrium. Or wait, no: the equation is ΔG°(T) = ΔH° - TΔS°, which is valid because ΔG = ΔH - TS. So that's correct.

So, let's compute ΔG°(298 K) using this formula:

ΔG°(298) = ΔH° - (298 K) * ΔS°.

Wait, but wait, what's the unit of ΔS°? Because ΔS is in kJ/(mol·K), so when you multiply by T (which is in K), you get kJ. Let me make sure the units are consistent. Let's calculate:

ΔG°(298) = (-91.2 kJ/mol) - (298 K) * (-0.1989 kJ/(mol·K)).

The units are correctly handled: K cancels with 1/K, giving kJ.

So compute the second term: 298 * (-0.1989) = negative. Multiply by the negative in front: so 298 * 0.1989 = let's calculate 300 * 0.2 is 60, but 298 is 300 - 2. So 298 * 0.1989 = approx 298 * 0.2 = 59.6, minus 2 * 0.1989 = 0.3978. So 59.6 - 0.3978 = 59.2022. So it's approximately 59.2 kJ.

So, ΔG°(298) = (-91.2 kJ) - (298 * (-0.1989 kJ/mol·K)) = -91.2 + 59.2 = -32 kJ/mol.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, so ΔG°(T) = ΔH° - TΔS°.

ΔH° is -91.2 kJ/mol.

ΔS° is -0.1989 kJ/(mol·K). So, TΔS° is 298 * (-0.1989) = -59.2022 kJ.

So, ΔG°(298) = (-91.2) - (-59.2022) = (-91.2) + 59.2022 = -31.9978 kJ/mol, approximately -32 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait a second, if the reaction is exothermic (ΔH negative), and the entropy change is negative (ΔS negative), that suggests the reaction is more favorable at lower temperatures because as T increases, the entropy term becomes more negative, making ΔG more negative. Wait, but in the calculation, at 298 K, ΔG is about -32 kJ/mol.

But wait, the problem is asking us to find ΔG at 1000 K. So, let's proceed.

Using the same equation:

ΔG°(1000) = ΔH° - (1000) * ΔS°.

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔG°(1000) = (-91.2) - (1000)*( -0.1989).

Wait, the ΔS° is -0.1989 kJ/(mol·K), so TΔS° is 1000 * (-0.1989) = -198.9 kJ.

So, ΔG°(1000) = (-91.2) - ( -198.9 ) = (-91.2) + 198.9 = 107.7 kJ/mol.

Wait, that would make ΔG°(1000) positive. But wait, that seems in line with the typical behavior, because higher temperatures can lead to more positive ΔG if the entropy term is negative and dominant.

Wait, but wait. I think I made a mistake in my calculation. Because when I compute TΔS°, the T is 1000 K, and ΔS is -0.1989 kJ/(mol·K), so 1000 * (-0.1989) = -198.9 kJ.

So, the term TΔS° is -198.9 kJ. So, ΔG°(1000) = (-91.2) - (1000 * (-0.1989)) = (-91.2) - (-198.9) = (-91.2) + 198.9 = 107.7 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait a minute. If temperature increases, and the Gibbs free energy is becoming more positive, that suggests the reaction becomes less spontaneous, but wait, that's not the case. Or is it?

Wait, but wait. The reaction is exothermic (ΔH negative), which is favorable at lower temperatures. But the entropy change is negative, meaning that as temperature increases, the entropy term becomes more negative, which would make the Gibbs free energy more negative. So, the calculation for 298 K was correct as -32 kJ, but for 1000 K, it's higher.

Wait, but according to the calculation, it's 107.7 kJ/mol, which is positive. So the reaction would be non-spontaneous at 1000 K.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because if the reaction is exothermic and entropy is negative, it's more favorable at lower temps. So, the Gibbs free energy should be more negative at higher temps.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check. The formula is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. So, at higher temperatures, the TΔS term is more negative, so if ΔH is negative and TΔS is negative, the result is more negative, making ΔG more negative. So, in that case, at 1000 K, the Gibbs free energy should be more negative than at 298 K.

But according to the calculation, it's 107.7 kJ, which is positive. That doesn't align. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the ΔG at 1000 K.

ΔG°(1000) = ΔH° - TΔS°.

ΔH° is -91.2 kJ/mol.

ΔS° is -0.1989 kJ/(mol·K).

So, TΔS° is 1000 K * (-0.1989 kJ/(mol·K)) = -198.9 kJ.

So,

ΔG°(1000) = (-91.2) - (-198.9) = (-91.2) + 198.9 = 107.7 kJ/mol.

Wait, but that's a positive number. But according to the earlier reasoning, the reaction should be more favorable at higher temperatures. So that's conflicting. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's re-express the formula in terms of (kJ and K). Let's be precise.

ΔG°(1000 K) = (-91.2) - (1000 * (-0.1989)).

So, 1000 * (-0.1989) = -198.9.

So,

ΔG°(1000) = (-91.2) - (-198.9) = (-91.2) + 198.9 = 107.7 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but according to the earlier reasoning, the reaction should become less favorable as temperature increases, but that's not the case here. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the van 't Hoff approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the Gibbs free energy change is a function of temperature. The equation for the change in Gibbs free energy with temperature is ΔG(T) = ΔH + (ΔS - (ΔH)/(T)) * (T1) - (T2 - T1)ΔH/(T), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is to use the van 't Hoff equation to find the change in ΔG when T changes.

Wait, another approach. The van 't Hoff equation is ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH/(R)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) + (ΔS/(R)) (1/T2 - 1/T1).

But perhaps that's for the equilibrium constant. Alternatively, since ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, perhaps we can differentiate it with respect to T.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct way to find ΔG at another temperature is to use the formula:

ΔG(T) = ΔG°(T) = ΔH° - TΔS°.

Wait, but wait, no. ΔG°(T) is the standard Gibbs free energy at temperature T. So, yes, the formula is correct.

So, let's proceed. So, at 298 K, the Gibbs free energy is approximately -32 kJ/mol.

At 1000 K, it's 107.7 kJ/mol. So, the reaction is more favorable at higher temperature, which aligns with the earlier reasoning.

But wait, looking at the options, one of the options is C: 107.7 kJ/mol.

But wait, I'm again a bit confused because the calculation shows that at 1000 K, the Gibbs free energy is positive, which suggests it's non-spontaneous. But according to our earlier reasoning, since the reaction is exothermic (ΔH negative), and the entropy change is negative, the reaction should be more favorable at higher temperatures.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in my calculation. Let me recheck.

ΔH° is -91.2 kJ/mol.

ΔS° is -0.1989 kJ/(mol·K).

So, TΔS° is 1000 K * (-0.1989 kJ/(mol·K)) = -198.9 kJ.

So, ΔG°(1000 K) = (-91.2) - (-198.9) = (-91.2) + 198.9 = 107.7 kJ/mol.

Yes, that's correct. So, the calculation is correct, but according to the reasoning, the reaction should be more favorable at higher temperatures. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A: -32 kJ/mol.

Wait, but in the question, the reaction is exothermic, so at higher temperatures, the reaction should be more favorable (more negative ΔG). But according to our calculation, it's less negative (positive), which contradicts that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the entropy change.

Wait, the entropy change ΔS° is calculated as [2 * S°(NH3)] - [S°(N2) + 3 * S°(H2)].

So, let's recompute that.

S°(N2) = 191.6 J/mol/K.

S°(H2) = 130.7 J/mol/K.

S°(NH3) = 192.4 J/mol/K.

So,

2 * 192.4 = 384.8.

191.6 + 3 * 130.7 = 191.6 + 392.1 = 583.7.

384.8 - 583.7 = -198.9 J/mol/K.

So, yes, ΔS° is -198.9 J/mol/K, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but perhaps I'm missing a negative sign in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have:

ΔG°(1000) = (-91.2) - (1000 * (-0.1989)).

So, 1000 * (-0.1989) = -198.9.

So,

ΔG°(1000) = (-91.2) - (-198.9) = (-91.2) + 198.9 = 107.7 kJ/mol.

Yes, that's correct. So, the reaction is more favorable at 1000 K (ΔG positive) than at 298 K (ΔG negative). That aligns with the reasoning that, for exothermic reactions, higher temperatures make the reaction less favorable (more positive ΔG). So, the calculation is correct.

So, the correct answer is 107.7 kJ/mol, which matches option C.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 107.7 kJ/mol.

Wait, but in the question, the reaction is N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3, which is exothermic. So, at higher temperatures, the reaction is less favorable, which is reflected in a positive ΔG.

So, the correct answer is option C: 107.7 kJ/mol.

Wait, but looking back, the options given are:

A: -32 kJ/mol

B: -162 kJ/mol

C: 107.7 kJ/mol

D: 298.7 kJ/mol

Wait, so the correct answer is option C. So, the answer should be C.
</think>

To estimate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction $\mathrm{N}_2(\mathrm{g}) + 3 \mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{NH}_3(\mathrm{g})$, we use the formula:

$$\Delta G^\circ(T) = \Delta H^\circ - T \Delta S^\circ,$$

where:
- $\Delta H^\circ = -91.2 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$ (exothermic reaction),
- $\Delta S^\circ = -0.1989 \, \mathrm{kJ/(mol·K)}$ (negative entropy change),
- $T = 1000 \, \mathrm{K}$.

### Step 1: Calculate $\Delta G^\circ(1000 \, \mathrm{K})$
Substitute the values into the formula:

$$\Delta G^\circ(1000 \, \mathrm{K}) = (-91.2 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}) - (1000 \, \mathrm{K}) \times (-0.1989 \, \mathrm{kJ/(mol·K)}).$$

### Step 2: Simplify the Expression
First, calculate $T \Delta S^\circ$:

$$1000 \, \mathrm{K} \times (-0.1989 \, \mathrm{kJ/(mol·K)}) = -198.9 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}.$$

Now, substitute back into the formula:

$$\Delta G^\circ(1000 \, \mathrm{K}) = (-91.2 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}) - (-198.9 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}) = (-91.2) + 198.9 = 107.7 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}.$$

### Step 3: Interpret the Result
The calculated $\Delta G^\circ(1000 \, \mathrm{K})$ is $+107.7 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$. This indicates that the reaction is non-spontaneous at $1000 \, \mathrm{K}$, as expected for an exothermic reaction with a negative entropy change. This aligns with the reasoning that higher temperatures reduce the tendency of an exothermic reaction to proceed.

### Step 4: Match with the Options
The options provided are:
- A: $-32 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$,
- B: $-162 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$,
- C: $+107.7 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$,
- D: $+298.7 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$.

The correct answer is **C: $+107.7 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$**, as this matches the calculated value of $\Delta G^\circ(1000 \, \mathrm{K})$.

ANSWER: C
