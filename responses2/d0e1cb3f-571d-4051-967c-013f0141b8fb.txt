Okay, so I have this question about density and how it changes when the volume of an object doubles. Hmm, let's think this through. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So the formula is rho = m/v. 

The question says the mass remains the same, but the volume doubles. Wait, if the mass doesn't change, then how does the density change? Let's break it down. Let's say the original volume is V and the mass is m. Then the original density is m/V. Now, the volume becomes 2V. The mass is still m, so the new density would be m/(2V). 

So the new density is (m/V) * (1/2) which is half of the original density. Oh, right, so the density would decrease by a factor of two. So looking at the options, D says it would double, which would be the opposite. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait. No, wait, no. Because if volume increases, and mass stays the same, density goes down. So the new density is half. So the answer should be D: double? Wait, no, wait. Wait, what's the original. Let me recheck.

Wait, original density is rho = m/V. New volume is 2V, same mass. So new rho = m/(2V) = (m/V) * (1/2) = rho/2. So indeed, the density is halved. So the answer is D says double. Wait no, wait. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, D says it would double. If the original was 2, and now it's 1, so it's halved. So the answer is D isn't correct. So the correct answer is D is incorrect. So the correct answer must be halved, which is option D, but wait, that's not right, because option D says double. So, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through again.

Wait, no, wait. I think I'm mixing up. The question is, when volume doubles and mass remains same, what is the new density? So the original density is m/V. New volume is 2V. New density is m/(2V) = (m/V) * (1/2) = rho/2. So the density is half. So the new density is half the original. So the density is decreased by half. So the correct option is D: double. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no. No, wait, the new density is (original density) multiplied by 1/2, so it's half. So the density is halved, not double. So the correct answer is not D.

Wait, so the options are:

D: double.

Wait, no. So the new density is half. So the correct answer would be option D is incorrect. So what is the correct change? The density halves. So looking at the options, the options are A to J. Let's read the options again. 

Options:

A: triple. → No, because volume is doubled, not tripled.

B: None. → Well, if the correct change is a halving, then none of the options except E are incorrect, so B is not correct.

C: halve. → Yes, that's correct.

D: double. → Incorrect, because it's halved.

E: same. → No, because volume is changing.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me think again. If the object's mass stays the same, and the volume doubles, then the density becomes (m)/(2V) = (1/2)(m/V) = (1/2) rho. So yes, density is halved. So the correct answer is C: halve. So the correct option is C. 

Wait, but the options don't have C as 'halve'. Let me look: the options are A: triple, B: none, C: halve, D: double, E: same, F: increase but not double, G: decrease by 4, H: remain same only if liquid, I: increase by 4, J: decrease but not halve.

So option C is 'halve', which is correct. So the answer is C. 

Wait, but wait, looking back: I think I made a mistake. Because the question says, if the volume doubles... So when I double the volume, density becomes half. So the correct answer would be option C: halve. So the answer is C. But wait, the options say A-D are all about different changes. So the correct option is option C: halve. So the answer is C.

The density of an object is given by the formula \( \rho = \frac{m}{V} \), where \( m \) is the mass and \( V \) is the volume. When the volume of an object doubles while its mass remains constant, the new density becomes \( \rho' = \frac{m}{2V} = \frac{1}{2} \rho \). This means the density is halved. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A: triple** — Incorrect, as the volume doubles, not triples.
- **B: None** — Incorrect, because option C is correct.
- **C: halve** — Correct, as shown by the calculation.
- **D: double** — Incorrect, as the density decreases, not increases.
- **E: same** — Incorrect, as the volume changes.
- **F: increase, but not necessarily double** — Incorrect, as the density does not increase.
- **G: decrease by a factor of four** — Incorrect, as the density is halved, not reduced by a quarter.
- **H: remain the same only if the object is a liquid** — Incorrect, as density depends on the material, not just being a liquid.
- **I: increase by a factor of four** — Incorrect, as the density decreases.
- **J: decrease, but not necessarily halve** — Incorrect, as the decrease is by a factor of two.

The correct answer is **C: halve**.
