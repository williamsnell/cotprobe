Okay, so I've got this problem about Mr. Thomas buying a lawn mower. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these financial terms, but I'll give it a shot.

So the question says he bought a $190 lawn mower on an installment plan. He's paying 8% per year as a service charge. He's going to pay it off in 6 equal monthly payments. I need to find out how much each monthly payment is and what the true interest rate he was charged. The options are A to J, each with a different payment and interest rate.

Hmm, I remember that installment plans usually involve some form of interest. Oh wait, this is about the true interest rate he's paying. But I'm not entirely sure how to calculate that. Maybe I should break it down.

First, the service charge is 8% per annum. So that's an annual rate. I think this means that the interest is calculated on a yearly basis. But since he's paying monthly, maybe that's an annual rate I need to convert into a monthly rate? Or wait, perhaps the 8% is the interest rate, and the time is monthly, so the interest per month would be 8% divided by 12. That makes sense because interest rates are usually expressed on a daily or monthly basis.

So, the total amount he pays over the 6 months is the principal plus the interest. The principal is $190, and the interest is 8% per year. But since he's paying monthly, each month's interest would be (8% / 12) * $190. 

Wait, but the problem states that he was charged a flat fee of 8% per year. Does that mean the interest is 8% of the principal, and he's paying it over 6 months? Or is the 8% the interest rate, and he's calculating the interest component on the monthly payments?

I think the 8% is the annual interest rate. So the total interest over the 6 months is 8% * (6/12) = 4% of $190. Let me compute that: 0.08 * 190 = $15.20. So the total amount he has to pay is $190 + $15.20 = $205.20.

But wait, he's paying it in 6 equal monthly installments. So each payment would be $205.20 / 6 = $34.20. Looking at the options, option A is $34.17, which is close. So maybe the payment is approximately $34.17.

But wait, this doesn't account for the time value of money or compounding. Because if you're paying off the interest over time, the true interest rate (the effective rate) might be different.

Alternatively, maybe the true interest rate is the effective annual rate. The effective annual rate (EAR) is calculated using the formula EAR = (1 + (i/n))^n - 1, where i is the nominal interest rate and n is the number of periods per year. But wait, in this case, the interest is being charged on a flat rate, so perhaps it's a simple interest scenario.

Wait, no. The 8% is an annual rate, but he's paying it monthly. So perhaps the interest is 8% per annum, and the monthly payment would be $205.20 over 6 months, but that doesn't sound right because the problem is asking for the true interest rate.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the monthly payment using the installment formula. The formula for installment payments is P = (Pv * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n), where Pv is the present value, r is the monthly rate, and n is the number of payments.

Wait, but in this case, the interest rate is 8% per annum. So the monthly rate would be 8% / 12 = approximately 0.6667% per month. So r = 8%/12 = 0.08/12 ≈ 0.0066667.

The present value (Pv) is $190, and n=6. So plug into the formula:

P = (190 * 0.0066667) / (1 - (1 + 0.0066667)^-6 )

First, calculate the numerator: 190 * 0.0066667 ≈ 1.26667.

Denominator: 1 - (1.0066667)^-6.

Calculating (1.0066667)^6: let's compute step by step.

(1.0066667)^1 = 1.0066667

^2: (1.0066667)^2 ≈ 1.01337

^3: ≈ 1.02008

^4: ≈ 1.02685

^5: ≈ 1.03368

^6: ≈ 1.04073.

So (1.0066667)^-6 ≈ 1 / 1.04073 ≈ 0.961.

So denominator is 1 - 0.961 = 0.039.

So P = 1.26667 / 0.039 ≈ 32.4718.

Wait, that's about $32.47, which is close to option F ($32.93) but not exact.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach because the problem mentions the true interest rate. Maybe the 8% is the nominal rate, and I need to calculate the effective annual rate.

Wait, but the effective annual rate is calculated as (1 + (r/m))^m - 1, where m is the number of compounding periods per year. But the 8% is annual, so m=1. So EAR is 8% in that case. But that's the same as the nominal rate, so the effective rate is 8%? But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the true interest rate.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the total amount he's paying is $190 + interest. Let's calculate the interest.

If he's paying in monthly installments, the interest per month is 8% per year. So interest for each month is 8% / 12 * $190 ≈ 1.2667. So each month, he's paying approximately $1.2667 in interest.

Wait, but that's per month. So over 6 months, the interest would be 6 * 1.2667 ≈ 7.6002.

So total amount paid is 190 + 7.6002 ≈ 197.6002. Divided by 6 months: 197.6002 /6 ≈ 32.9333, which is about $32.93, which matches option F. But that's just the total payment per month, not the interest rate.

Wait, but the question asks for the true interest rate, which is probably the effective annual rate. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the true interest rate is the effective annual rate. So the effective rate (EAR) is calculated as (1 + (r/m))^m -1. Here, r is 8% per annum, m=12. So EAR = (1 + 0.08/12)^12 -1 ≈ (1.0066667)^12 -1.

Calculating (1.0066667)^12: I remember that (1 + 0.08/12)^12 is approximately 1.0830, so EAR ≈ 0.083 or 8.3%. That's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated using simple interest. Let's check that. Simple interest is Pt = P + (P * r * t). Here, P is $190, r=8% per year, t=6 months = 0.5 years. So simple interest would be 190 * 0.08 * 0.5 = 190 * 0.04 = $7.60. So total amount is 197.60, so monthly payment is 197.60 /6 ≈ $32.93.

But that's the same as before. So the monthly payment is approximately $32.93, which is option F.

As for the true interest rate, perhaps it's the simple interest rate? But that can't be right because the problem is about the true interest rate, which is usually the effective rate.

Wait, another approach: the total amount paid is $205.20 (as calculated earlier). Divided by 6 gives $34.20 per month. But this doesn't match any of the options except maybe option A, which is $34.17.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me summarize.

The problem is about an installment plan where Mr. Thomas buys a lawn mower for $190 with an 8% per annum service charge. He pays in 6 equal monthly payments. We're to find the monthly payment and the true interest rate.

Possible steps:

1. Calculate the effective monthly interest rate, then compute the monthly payment.

2. Calculate the effective annual interest rate.

Let me try step 1.

First, the total amount to be paid is the principal plus interest over 6 months. The interest is 8% per annum, so per month it's 8% /12 = 0.6667%. So the monthly interest rate is approximately 0.6667%.

The formula for the monthly payment for installment is:

PMT = (Pv * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n )

Where:
- Pv = $190
- r = 0.08 / 12 = 0.0066667
- n=6

So PMT = (190 * 0.0066667) / (1 - (1.0066667)^-6 )

Calculate numerator: 190 * 0.0066667 ≈ 1.26667.

Denominator: (1 - (1.0066667)^-6 ) ≈ (1 - 0.9614) ≈ 0.0386.

So PMT ≈ 1.26667 / 0.0386 ≈ 32.93, which is about $32.93, which matches option F. So the monthly payment is $32.93.

Now, the true interest rate. The effective annual rate (EAR) is calculated as (1 + r)^n -1, where r is the periodic rate.

So r is 0.08/12 = 0.0066667, and n=12.

EAR = (1 + 0.0066667)^12 -1 ≈ 1.0830 -1 = 0.083, so 8.3%. But this isn't one of the options. The closest is option B, which is 9%, but it's not matching.

Wait, but another way to compute effective annual rate is to use the total amount. The total amount paid is:

PMT *6 = 32.93 *6 ≈ 197.58, which is less than $205.20, so perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the effective rate is the simple interest rate of 8% per annum. But that doesn't sound right because it's the same as the nominal rate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the effective rate, but the options don't include 8.3%. Let me look back at the options.

Looking at the options, option B is 9% and the payment is $36.67. That's not matching our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective rate is being calculated using the present value of the payments.

Wait, another approach: The total amount he paid is 190 + interest = 190 + 8% of 190*6. Wait, no, that's not correct because the interest is on the principal, but the payments are spread over time.

Wait, maybe I should use the present value formula to find the monthly payment, which would give the same result as the installment formula, and then compute the effective annual rate.

So, as I did earlier, PMT is approximately $32.93, which is option F. But the effective rate is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective rate is the simple interest rate, which is 8% per annum. But that would make the effective rate 8%, not matching any options except maybe option C or D.

Wait, the options are:

A: 34.17, 14.5%

B: 36.67,9%

C:40,12%

D:30,15%

E:29.17,20%

F:32.93,13.7%

G:35,10%

H:33.50,11%

I:31.67,16%

J:31.00,18%

So option F says $32.93 interest rate, which matches our calculation.

But the question is also about the true interest rate he was charged. So perhaps the question is asking for the effective annual rate, which we calculated as approximately 8.3%, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the true interest rate is different. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the effective annual rate, which would be 8% per annum, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the 8% is the periodic rate, not the annual rate. No, 8% per annum is given.

Wait, another approach: The problem might have intended that the 8% is the effective annual rate, so the true interest rate is 8%. But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the effective rate is higher.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: 34.17 and 14.5%. Our calculated amount is 32.93, so close to 33. So perhaps the payment is $33, but the options don't have that. The next closest is 32.93.

But the interest rate part, our calculation was approximately 8.3%, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps using the effective annual rate formula:

EAR = (1 + r/m)^m -1

r is 8%, m=12.

So:

(1 + 0.08/12)^12 -1 = (1.0066667)^12 -1.

Let me calculate this more accurately.

1.0066667^12.

We can compute it step by step:

1.0066667^2 = 1.01337.

^3: 1.01337 * 1.0066667 ≈ 1.02008.

^4: 1.02008 * 1.0066667 ≈ 1.02685.

^5: 1.02685 * 1.0066667 ≈ 1.03368.

^6: 1.03368 * 1.0066667 ≈ 1.04073.

So 1.04073 – 1 = 0.04073, which is 4.073% annual rate. That's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me try using a calculator approach.

Using natural logs:

ln(1.0066667) ≈ 0.0066444.

Multiply by 12: 0.0066444 *12 ≈ 0.07973.

Then subtract 1: e^0.07973 –1 ≈ 1.0833 –1 = 0.0833, which is 8.33% as before.

So the effective rate is about 8.3%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is using simple interest. Let's compute using simple interest.

Simple interest formula: I = P * r * t.

Here, P = 190, r=8% annually, t=6 months.

So I = 190 * 0.08 * (6/12) = 190 * 0.08 * 0.5 = 190 * 0.04 = $7.60.

So total amount paid is 190 +7.60=197.60.

Divided by 6, monthly payment is 197.60 /6 ≈ 32.93, which matches option F.

So the monthly payment is $32.93, which is option F.

As for the interest rate, perhaps the question is referring to the effective annual rate.

Wait, but let's think again. The problem is about the true interest rate. So perhaps the effective rate is the same as the nominal rate, but that's not correct because of compounding.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the effective annual rate, but the options don't have the correct number. So perhaps the options are incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the 8% is not the nominal rate but the effective rate. But that would complicate things, and I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my understanding of the problem. Let me read the question again.

"Mr. Thomas purchased a $190 lawn mower on an installment plan. He was charged an 8% per year flat fee. He paid it off in 6 equal monthly payments. How much was each payment? What was the true interest rate he was charged?"

So the interest is 8% per year, flat. So the monthly interest is 8%/12.

The calculation for the monthly payment is as I did before, leading to approximately $32.93.

Now, the "true interest rate" is the effective annual rate, which I calculated as approximately 8.3%, which isn't an option.

So perhaps the problem is asking for the effective rate, but the options don't include it. Alternatively, perhaps the true interest rate is the simple interest rate.

Wait, another approach: The true interest rate is the effective annual rate. Let's compute the effective rate using the total amount.

The total amount paid is 190 + (8% * 190 * 6/12) = 190 + (190 * 0.08 * 0.5) = 190 + (7.60) = 197.60.

So PMT = 197.60 /6 = 32.93, which matches option F.

But the true interest rate is calculated as the effective rate. Let me compute it correctly.

The formula for the effective annual rate when the interest is compounded monthly is:

EAR = (1 + (r/m))^m -1

r is the nominal annual rate.

Wait, 8% is the annual rate, so r=0.08.

m=12.

So:

EAR = (1 + 0.08/12)^12 -1.

Calculate 0.08/12 = 0.0066667.

(1 + 0.0066667)^12 = ?

Using logarithms: ln(1.0066667) ≈ 0.0066444.

Multiply by 12: 0.07973.

So e^0.07973 ≈ 1.0833.

Subtract 1: 0.0833, or 8.33%.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as the present value of an ordinary annuity.

Wait, maybe the true interest rate is calculated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the simple interest rate. So, the total interest is 190 * 0.08 *6/12 = 190 *0.04 = $7.60. So the total amount is $197.60, which gives a monthly payment of about $32.93.

But the true interest rate is the effective rate, which is 8.33%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing another approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the effective rate is the compound interest rate. The formula is:

EAR = (1 + (r/m))^m -1.

Which as I did before, is approximately 8.33%.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula for effective annual rate.

Wait, perhaps the effective rate is calculated as (1 + r)^n -1.

Wait, but that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We can rearrange this to solve for PMT.

PMT = PV / [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

But in this case, the PV is $190, the r is 8% per annum, and n=6.

So PMT = 190 / [ (1 - (1 + 0.08)^-6 ) / 0.08 ]

Compute the denominator:

(1 - (1.08)^-6 ) /0.08.

(1.08)^6 ≈1.58687.

So (1 - 1.58687^-1 ) ≈ (1 - 0.56446 ) ≈ 0.43554.

Divide by 0.08: 0.43554 /0.08 ≈5.44425.

So PMT = 190 /5.44425 ≈34.93.

Ah, so that gives approximately $34.93, which is close to option A's $34.17. But the calculation I did earlier gave $32.93, which is closer to option F.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

The present value factor for an ordinary annuity is:

PVIFA(r, n) = [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

So, PMT = PV / PVIFA(r, n).

So, in this case, r=8% annually, n=6.

So, PVIFA(8%,6) = [1 - (1.08)^-6 ] / 0.08.

(1.08)^-6 ≈1/1.58687 ≈0.6302.

So 1 - 0.6302 = 0.3698.

Divide by 0.08: 0.3698 /0.08 =4.6225.

So PMT=190 /4.6225 ≈40.88.

Wait, that's way higher than the previous calculations.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting results. Let me try recalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator accurately.

Compute (1 - (1.08)^-6 ) /0.08.

1.08^-6 = 1/(1.08^6).

Compute 1.08^6.

1.08^1=1.08

1.08^2=1.1664

1.08^3=1.259712

1.08^4≈1.360489

1.08^5≈1.469328

1.08^6≈1.586874

So 1.08^-6 =1/1.586874≈0.6302.

So 1 - 0.6302 =0.3698.

Divide by 0.08: 0.3698 /0.08 =4.6225.

So PMT=190 /4.6225≈40.93.

Wait, that's a different result than the earlier one.

But that can't be right. Because the present value of the payments should be $190.

So, if the PMT is $40.93, then the present value is 40.93 *4.6225≈190. So that makes sense.

So the correct payment is approximately $40.93, which is option C.

So why did I get $32.93 earlier? Because I used a different formula.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Let me think again.

The formula I used is:

PMT = PV / [ (1 - (1 + r/m)^-m n ) / (r/m) ]

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

PMT = PV * [ r/(1 - (1+r)^-n ) ]

Which is the same as PV / PVIFA(r, n).

So, in this case, the PMT is 190 / PVIFA(0.08,6).

As calculated, PVIFA is approximately 4.6225.

So, PMT =190 /4.6225 ≈40.93.

So the correct payment is $40.93, which is option C.

Now, the true interest rate is the effective rate, which we calculated as approximately 8.33%, but that's not an option.

Wait, but the options don't include any of these. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing another approach.

Wait, perhaps using the total amount and the present value.

Wait, but the problem is about the true interest rate. So perhaps the effective rate is the rate that makes the present value equal to $190.

So, the effective rate is the rate r such that:

190 = PMT * PVIFA(r,6).

But without knowing PMT, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the simple interest approach, which would mean that the effective rate is 8% per annum, which isn't an option.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to summarize.

In the problem, the monthly payment is $32.93, which matches option F.

The effective annual rate is approximately 8.33%, which isn't an option.

But the options given are:

A: 34.17 and 14.5%

B: 36.67 and 9%

C:40 and12%

D:30 and15%

E:29.17 and20%

F:32.93 and13.7%

G:35 and10%

H:33.50 and11%

I:31.67 and16%

J:31.00 and18%

So option F is the payment of $32.93, and the true interest rate is 13.7%, which also isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the simple interest rate, and the effective rate is different.

Wait, the simple interest over 6 months would be 8% *6/12 =8% *0.5=4%, so the total interest is $7.60, and the total amount is $197.60.

So the effective rate on the total amount is 8.33%, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the true interest rate is the effective annual rate, but the options are incorrect.

In that case, perhaps the correct answer is option F: $32.93, but the true interest rate is 13.7%, which isn't an option.

Wait, but none of the options give the correct effective rate. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation of the effective rate again.

Let me calculate the effective rate using the total amount.

The present value is $190, and the present value factor is 4.6225.

So, PMT =190 /4.6225≈40.93.

Now, the effective rate can be calculated using the formula:

r = ( (PMT / PV) * (m) )^(1/m) -1.

Wait, perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, let me use the formula for effective interest rate:

The effective interest rate for n periods can be found by solving:

(1 + i)^n = (1 + r)^n.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective rate is calculated using the present value of the annuity.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the effective rate using the total amount.

The total amount paid is $197.60, which is $190 + $7.60.

The present value of this is $190, so the effective rate is the rate that makes the present value of $197.60 equal to $190.

Wait, that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective rate is the rate that makes the present value of $197.60 equal to $190.

So, using the formula:

PV = FV / (1 + r)^n.

So, $190 = $197.60 / (1 + r)^6.

So, (1 + r)^6 = $197.60 / $190 =1.04.

So, take the 6th root of 1.04.

1.04^(1/6) = approx 1.0066.

So, r=0.0066, which is 0.66% per month, which is 8% per annum.

So that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's re-calculate it.

(1 + r)^6 =1.04.

Take the 6th root:

r = (1.04)^(1/6) -1.

Compute 1.04^(1/6):

Using logarithms:

ln(1.04)=0.03922.

Divide by 6: 0.006537.

Exponentiate: e^0.006537≈1.00656.

So, r=1.00656 -1=0.00656, or 0.656% per month, which is 8% per annum.

So that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the present value.

Wait, perhaps the effective rate is 8.33%, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is incorrect, and the options don't include the correct answer.

In that case, perhaps the correct answer is option F, with the payment of $32.93, but the true interest rate is 13.7%, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the simple interest rate, which would be 8% per annum, but that's not an option either.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the effective annual rate, which is 8.33%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the effective rate.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the effective rate:

r = ( (1 + i)^n -1 ) /n.

Wait, no, that's for the effective rate when the interest is compounded n times.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it as:

r = ( (PMT / PV) * (m) )^(1/m) -1.

Wait, perhaps that's the formula for the effective rate.

So, with m=6 months, but that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

In any case, I think that the payment is $32.93, which is option F, and the true interest rate is approximately 8.33%, which isn't an option.

Wait, but the options don't have this.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as the total amount paid and the present value.

Wait, perhaps the true interest rate is the rate that makes the present value of the payments equal to the loan amount.

So, using the present value formula:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We have PV =190, n=6, and we're solving for r.

But without knowing PMT, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula in reverse.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the present value factor for a given rate and see if it equals 190/40.93.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to just accept that the effective rate is approximately 8.33%, which isn't an option.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option F: $32.93, and the true interest rate is 13.7%, which is not an option. So, perhaps the problem is incorrect, or the options are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the simple interest rate, which would be 8% per annum, but that's not an option either.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the effective rate.

Wait, let me try to calculate it again.

The effective rate is the rate that makes the present value of the payments equal to the loan amount.

So, PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We have PV=190, n=6.

So, we need to solve for r.

Let me try plugging in r=0.07 (7%).

Compute [ (1 - (1.07)^-6 ) /0.07 ].

(1.07)^-6 =1/(1.07^6)=1/1.4859=0.6736.

1 -0.6736=0.3264.

0.3264 /0.07≈4.6629.

So, 190 *4.6629≈906.10, which is higher than 190. So, the present value is much higher than 190 at 7% effective rate.

Wait, that's not possible. Because at a higher rate, the present value decreases.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-calculate.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct formula.

Wait, the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

So, at r=0.07, n=6:

(1 - (1.07)^-6 ) /0.07.

(1.07)^-6 ≈0.6202.

1 -0.6202=0.3798.

0.3798 /0.07≈5.4257.

So, PV = Pmt *5.4257.

We need PV=190.

So, Pmt=190 /5.4257≈35.32.

So, at 7% effective rate, the monthly payment would be $35.32.

But the loan amount is $190, so the present value of the payments would be higher than $190.

Wait, this seems confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

In any case, given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to the conclusion that the correct answer is option F: $32.93, and the true interest rate is 13.7%, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps the answer is option F, but the true interest rate is not provided.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option C: $40.93, with a true interest rate of 12%, which is also not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the effective rate of return on the total amount.

Wait, the total amount is $197.60.

The present value is $190.

So, the effective rate can be calculated as:

(1 + r)^6 =197.60/190=1.04.

So, (1 + r)^6=1.04.

Take the 6th root:

1 + r =1.04^(1/6).

Compute 1.04^(1/6):

Using logarithms:

ln(1.04)=0.03922.

Divide by 6: 0.006537.

Exponentiate: e^0.006537≈1.00656.

So, r=0.00656, or 0.656% per month, which is approximately 8% per annum.

Thus, the effective rate is 8%, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the effective rate is the rate that makes the present value of the loan equal to the amount paid back.

So, using the present value of an ordinary annuity:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We have PV=190, n=6.

We need to solve for r.

Let me try r=0.08.

Compute [ (1 - (1.08)^-6 ) /0.08 ].

(1.08)^-6 =1/(1.08^6)=1/1.58681=0.63017.

1 -0.63017=0.36983.

0.36983 /0.08=4.6229.

So, PMT=190 /4.6229≈40.93.

So, the monthly payment is $40.93, which matches option C.

Thus, the effective rate is 8%, which is not an option.

But the options are A to J, with some giving the true interest rate.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the effective rate to be the simple interest rate.

Wait, in that case, the effective rate would be 8% per annum, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the effective rate to be the simple interest rate, which is 8% per annum, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

In conclusion, the correct payment is $32.93, which is option F, and the true interest rate is 8%, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the answer is option F, but the true interest rate is not provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the simple interest rate, which is 8% per annum, but that's not an option either.

So, I think the correct answer is option F, with the payment of $32.93, and the true interest rate is 8%, which isn't an option. Therefore, the answer is option F.
