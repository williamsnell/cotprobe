Okay, so I've got this question about a separately excited generator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electrical engineering, but I'll try to think through this step by step. Alright, the question is about calculating the no-load voltage under different speed conditions. The armature voltage is given as 150 V, and the speed changes from 1800 rpm. I need to find the new no-load voltage when the speed is increased to 2000 rpm and when it's reduced to 1600 rpm.

Wait, I remember that in a separately excited generator, the field current is kept constant, right? Because it's connected to a battery or something, so it doesn't vary. So the only thing that changes is the speed, which affects the induced EMF. Oh wait, no, wait. The armature's induced EMF depends on speed, which is linked to the flux and the speed. But in a separately excited generator, the field current is constant.

So the induced EMF (Ea) in a generator is given by E = (voltage constant) * (speed) / (armature resistance) because the armature resistance is fixed. Wait, no, the armature resistance isn't fixed here. Or wait, is it? I think in a separately excited generator, armature resistance is usually negligible compared to the external resistance. Wait, no, in this case, the excitation is separate, so the armature resistance might be part of the circuit. Oh, but maybe the question is assuming that the armature's resistance is fixed. Wait, no, the armature's resistance isn't given here, so maybe we can assume it's a negligible effect. Or perhaps the armature's resistance isn't changing because it's a separate part. Hmm, maybe I should focus on the induced EMF formula.

The induced EMF in a generator is E = K * (N * P) where K is a constant (which depends on voltage drop, armature resistance, etc.), N is the speed, and P is the number of poles. But wait, no, the induced EMF is proportional to (speed) divided by (armature resistance), but if armature resistance is fixed, then the induced EMF is proportional to speed. No, wait, actually, the induced EMF is given by E = K * (N * f), where f is some frequency factor. Alternatively, perhaps the generated EMF depends on speed, but since the armature resistance is fixed, the generated EMF is directly proportional to speed.

Wait, but armature resistance is related to the speed. Because when the speed increases, the armature resistance decreases? Or increases? Let me think. Oh right, armature resistance is proportional to (flux)/(current), and flux is proportional to speed. So higher speed, same current, so higher resistance. Or wait, the armature resistance is inversely proportional to speed. Because if speed increases, armature current increases, leading to higher armature resistance. So speed and armature resistance are inversely related.

Wait, maybe the generator's induced EMF is given by E = K * (N * P) / R_a, where R_a is the armature resistance. So if N increases, E increases, but R_a decreases. So both numerator and denominator change. But since the question is about the no-load voltage, which is the voltage at no excitation. Wait, no, no-load condition is when the excitation is applied. So perhaps it's better to think about the relationship between speed and generated EMF when the field current is kept constant.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think again. The key here is that in a separately excited generator, the field current is kept at a constant value because the excitation is connected externally. So the armature's induced EMF depends on speed and the speed of the generator. But when the speed changes, the induced EMF changes, because the armature resistance is fixed. Wait, no, because armature resistance is fixed. So the armature's EMF is E = (K * N)/R_a. Oh wait, K is the constant that includes the voltage drop, armature resistance, etc.

So, when the speed increases, from 1800 to 2000 rpm, the induced EMF would increase. Let's compute the new voltage.

Wait, but the armature resistance is fixed. So the induced EMF is directly proportional to the speed. So if speed increases from 1800 to 2000, the generated EMF increases. So the armature EMF (Ea) would be 150 V * (2000/1800) = (150 * 2000)/1800 = 150 * (10/9) ≈ 166.666... V. So about 166.666 V. But wait, no, that's when the excitation is fixed. But wait, in a separately excited generator, field current is constant. So when the speed increases, the armature EMF increases.

Wait, but the question is about the no-load voltage. Oh, right. The no-load voltage is the voltage when the armature current is zero. Wait, no, no, no. Wait, no, no-load voltage is when the excitation is applied, and the armature is open circuit. So perhaps that's when the armature's induced EMF is zero, but that doesn't make sense because the field current is kept constant. So no, perhaps the no-load voltage is the voltage at no excitation? No, that's not possible because the excitation (field current) is kept at a constant level. So perhaps the no-load voltage is the voltage under no excitation, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the different voltage equations for a generator. For a separately excited generator, the terminal voltage is given by E = K * (N * P) / R_a, but when the field current is kept constant, which it is in this case.

So, the generated EMF (Ea) is directly proportional to speed. So when N increases, Ea increases. So, if the armature resistance is fixed, then Ea is proportional to N.

Wait, but that would mean that if speed increases, the generated EMF increases. So, in the no-load condition, the armature current is zero, so the terminal voltage is equal to the generated EMF. Or wait, no. Wait, no-load condition is when the armature is open circuit. But in that case, the terminal voltage would be the voltage across the open circuit, which is the generated EMF. So in that case, the no-load voltage is the generated EMF.

Wait, but no, wait. No, because in a generator, when the armature is open, the generated EMF is what's present. So the terminal voltage is the same as the generated EMF, because there's no current. So the no-load voltage is the same as the generated EMF.

Wait, but for a generator with field excitation, the terminal voltage is given by E = (K * N * P) / R_a when the armature is open. So the terminal voltage would be the generated EMF. So the no-load voltage is the same as the generated EMF, which is proportional to speed.

So, when the speed increases, the no-load voltage increases. When it decreases, it decreases.

So, the initial no-load voltage is 150 V at 1800 rpm.

For part (a), speed is increased to 2000 rpm. So the new voltage is 150 * (2000/1800) = (150)*(10/9) ≈166.666... V → 166.666 V.

For part (b), speed is reduced to 1600 rpm. So the new voltage is 150 * (1600/1800) = (150)*(8/9) = 133.333 V.

Wait, but wait a second, what if the armature's resistance is changing? Because as speed increases, the armature resistance decreases. Because armature resistance is proportional to speed and inversely proportional to current. So if speed increases, current increases, so armature resistance decreases.

Wait, but in the initial setup, armature's resistance is fixed. So when speed increases, resistance decreases, so the generated EMF Ea is (K*N)/R_a.

Wait, but Ea is the generated EMF. So when speed increases, Ea would increase, but R_a is decreasing. So (N increases, R_a decreases) → Ea = (K*N)/(R_a) → (N/R_a) increases, so Ea would increase. So the earlier calculation holds.

So our initial assumption is correct: the no-load voltage increases with speed.

Wait, but then the options are:

Looking at the options, option E is 166.7 V and 133.3 V.

Wait, the options are: 

E: 166.7 V and 133.3 V. So that's option E.

But wait, what about the options? Let me look again.

The options are:

A: 175.5 and 125.5

B: 200 and 160

C: 165 and 135

D: 210 and 120

E: 166.7 and 133.3

F: 158.3 and 141.7

G: 190 and 110

H:150 and 180

I: 145 and 155

J: 183.3 and 116.7.

So part (a) (increased to 2000) would be higher than 150, so options A, C, E, F.

Part (b) (decreased to 1600) would be lower than 150, so options B, C, E, F, etc.

So E is 166.7 and 133.3, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait, what about the field current? Because in the case of a separately excited generator, the field current is kept fixed. So the field current doesn't change. So the induced EMF is directly proportional to speed.

So for part (a): 1800 → 2000 → 150*(2000/1800) = 166.666 V → 166.7 V.

Part (b): 150*(1600/1800) = 133.333 V → 133.3 V.

So option E matches.

But wait, another thought: sometimes in generators, voltage drops are considered. Because the armature resistance and others cause a voltage drop. But wait, in a no-load condition, the armature current is zero, so the entire generated EMF is present. So the terminal voltage would be equal to the generated EMF.

Hence, the correct option is E: 166.7 V and 133.3 V.

To determine the no-load voltage of a separately excited generator when the speed changes, we analyze the relationship between speed and generated EMF. In a separately excited generator, the field current is constant, so the generated EMF is directly proportional to the speed of the generator. The formula for the generated EMF is:

\[
E_a = \frac{K \cdot N}{R_a}
\]

where \(K\) is a constant, \(N\) is the speed, and \(R_a\) is the armature resistance. Since \(K\) and \(R_a\) are constant, \(E_a\) is directly proportional to \(N\). For no-load conditions, the terminal voltage equals the generated EMF.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Initial no-load voltage at 1800 rpm**: \(E_{\text{initial}} = 150 \, \text{V}\).
2. **Speed increased to 2000 rpm**:
   \[
   E_{\text{increased}} = 150 \cdot \frac{2000}{1800} = 150 \cdot \frac{10}{9} \approx 166.67 \, \text{V}.
   \]
3. **Speed reduced to 1600 rpm**:
   \[
   E_{\text{reduced}} = 150 \cdot \frac{1600}{1800} = 150 \cdot \frac{8}{9} \approx 133.33 \, \text{V}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option E**: \(166.7 \, \text{V}\) and \(133.3 \, \text{V}\) matches the calculated values for the increased and decreased speeds, respectively.
- Other options either do not align with the calculations or represent incorrect voltage values.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: E**
