Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about American attitudes towards President Bill Clinton during his term. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question says that many Americans supported his policies despite disagreeing with his personal infidelity. The key point here is the split in opinion between those who supported his policies and those who didn't. The options refer to various psychological and social concepts. I need to figure out which one best captures this dichotomy.

Let's go through the options one by one. The options are: External locus of control, situational ethics, internal validity, cognitive dissonance, social desirability bias, attitudinal coherence, attributional bias, moral relativism, self-representation, behavioral consistency.

The scenario is about differing opinions and how that affects public attitudes. So, the conflict between people's views on a president's policies is a social issue. When people disagree, especially on important issues, their differing views can lead to various social phenomena.

Option A: external locus of control. That's about how behavior is influenced by external factors beyond individual choice, like the government's policies. But the question is more about differing personal beliefs leading to differing policy support. So maybe not the best fit.

Option B: situational ethics. This relates to how actions are deemed good or bad in specific contexts. Maybe, but I'm not sure how it directly applies here. The question is about differing opinions, not about context in general.

Option C: internal validity. Hmm, internal validity is about whether the results of a study are due to the variables being studied rather than other factors. I'm not sure how this connects to the support and policy decisions. It doesn't seem directly applicable here.

Option D: cognitive dissonance. This concept is about feeling discomfort when holding beliefs that conflict with observations. It's more about why people make irrational decisions, but does it explain a split in opinions leading to policy support? Maybe, but the question seems to focus on the conflict itself rather than the underlying cognitive processes.

Option E: social desirability bias. This occurs when people provide answers that seem more desirable to themselves than they actually are. For example, answering truthfully even when they don't want to. So, if people are unsure about their personal infidelity, they might not tell the truth, leading to a dichotomy. But the question mentions their differing views on personal infidelity, which would affect policy decisions. So, maybe this is a possible angle.

Option F: attitudinal coherence. This refers to how closely people align their attitudes with their beliefs. If people have conflicting views, they might not align their attitudes, leading to a split. So this could be the right answer.

Option G: attributional bias. This is about how people attribute their own behavior to different causes—like blaming others for their actions. It's more about personal behavior than differing opinions.

Option H: moral relativism. This is the idea that moral values are relative and depend on cultural context. It doesn't directly explain the split in support for a specific president's policies, unless the policies are viewed differently in various contexts.

Option I: self-representation. This is about how people choose to present their views. If many people are self-representing their beliefs, it could lead to differing views, but I'm not sure.

Option J: behavioral consistency. This is about how behavior matches expectations. If people's differing views cause inconsistencies in their actions, this could be a factor. But I'm not sure if it's the best term here.

Putting it all together, the question is about differing opinions leading to a split in support for policies. Social desirability bias (E) is about honesty and openness to personal issues. If people have conflicting views, they might not honestly reveal them, leading to a dichotomy. For example, some might say they supported Clinton's policies but are unsure, leading to internal inconsistency. But I'm not certain; maybe attitudinal coherence (F) is the better fit because it refers to how attitudes are formed and maintained, which directly relates to differing views.

Wait, another thought. When people have differing views, it creates a lack of attitudinal coherence. If their attitudes aren't aligned, they might not support the policies—so attitudinal coherence would decrease, leading to a split. So F seems plausible.

Alternatively, social desirability (E) could lead to inconsistent policies because people might not disclose their personal infidelities, causing their support for policies to be inconsistent. But the question specifically states that many Americans supported his policies despite disagreeing with personal infidelity. So if they're aware and open about their infidelity, they might still support the policies. In that case, maybe E isn't the best fit because social desirability bias could lead to inconsistent responses, but the question says they supported the policies despite differing views. So perhaps the split is about differing beliefs, not differing openness to those beliefs.

But the question focuses on differing opinions, not differing openness. So if many people have differing views, but still support the policies, perhaps it's about their differing attitudes (F) leading to inconsistent support. Or maybe it's about their differing views contributing to a lack of attitudinal coherence, which could reduce support.

Alternatively, the correct answer is F: attitudinal coherence. Because if their attitudes are not in line with their differing views, they might not support the policies. So the lack of attitudinal coherence leads to a split in support. So I'm leaning towards F being the right answer.

The dichotomy of opinion between those who support President Bill Clinton's policies and those who do not stems from differing views on personal infidelity. This reflects a lack of attitudinal coherence, where the varying beliefs lead to inconsistent policy support. 

Answer: F: attitudinal coherence.
