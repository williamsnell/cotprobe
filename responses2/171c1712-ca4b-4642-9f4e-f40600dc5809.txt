Question:

Options:

A: $\frac{3}{4}$
B: $\frac{3}{5}$
C: $\frac{1}{4}$
D: $\frac{1}{2}$
E: $\frac{1}{6}$
F: $\frac{1}{5}$
G: $\frac{2}{5}$
H: $\frac{1}{3}$
I: $\frac{2}{3}$
J: $\frac{5}{6}$

Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The urn has four balls: two orange and two blue. I need to find the probability that the other ball is also orange, given that at least one is orange.

Hmm, conditional probability. Right, so the formula I remember is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). So here, event A is the other ball being orange, and event B is having at least one orange ball. But wait, if we know that at least one is orange, then the other could be orange or blue. So, since we already have at least one orange, the possible scenarios are either both are orange or one orange and one blue. So, I need to calculate the probability of both being orange divided by the probability that at least one is orange.

Let me think about the total possible ways to draw two balls from four. Oh, that's combination. The total number of ways to choose two balls is 4 choose 2, which is 6. 

Now, let's break down the scenarios. The possible pairs are: OO, OB, BO, BB. Wait, but since we're selecting without replacement, the order doesn't matter. So, the possible outcomes are:

1. Both orange (OO)
2. One orange and one blue (OB)
3. Both blue (BB)

But wait, in the original problem, we are told that at least one is orange. So, we can eliminate the BB case. So, the possible cases where at least one is orange are OO and OB.

So, the number of favorable cases for event B is 1 (OO) + 2 (OB, BO, but since in pairs, it's just 2) — wait no, wait. Wait, the four balls are two orange (O1, O2) and two blue (B1, B2). So the possible pairs when selecting without replacement are:

1. O1 & O2
2. O1 & B1
3. O1 & B2
4. O2 & B1
5. O2 & B2
6. B1 & B2

But since at least one is orange, we exclude the 6th case. So the remaining five cases are the possible outcomes given B. Wait, no. Wait, in the initial scenario, the total is 6, and we're told that at least one is orange, so that means we're considering the 5 cases where it's not BB. So the sample space for this conditional probability is 5 cases.

Wait, but wait. The problem says we're told that at least one is orange. So, the sample space is the 5 cases where at least one is orange. So, the probability we need is the number of those 5 cases where the other ball is orange.

In the OO case, the other is definitely orange, so that's one case. In the OB cases, each of the two blue balls paired with one orange will have the other as blue. So, in the 5 cases where at least one is orange, the number of cases where the other is orange is 1 (OO) plus 2 (O and B pairs). Wait, no. Let me re-express this.

Wait, the possible favorable cases for A (the other is orange) are:

- Both are orange: OO. That's one case.

- One orange and one blue: but since we're told that at least one is orange, any of the other cases (O and B) would satisfy the condition. So, each of those two cases (O1B1, O1B2, O2B1, O2B2) — wait no, wait, in our list, each O is paired with each B. So, in the sample space, the OO case is one, and the OB cases are three others (O1B1, O1B2, O2B1, O2B2?), wait no. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, no, the 6 possible pairs are:

1. OO
2. OB
3. OB
4. OB
5. OB
6. BB

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in listing them.

Wait, number of cases where one is orange and one is blue.

Wait, for two oranges and two blues, the number of ways to pick one orange and one blue is 2 * 2 = 4.

So, the possible cases are OO (1), OB (4), BB (1). Wait, but since we are told that at least one is orange, we can't include BB. So, the sample space is OO, OB, OB, OB, OB. Wait, that's 5 possibilities.

Wait, wait, no. Because OO is one case, and the 4 OB cases are all under the condition that at least one is orange. So, the sample space for the given condition is 5 cases (1 OO and 4 OB). So, the number of favorable cases for A (other is orange) is 1 (since only OO has both oranges). So, the probability is 1 (for OO) divided by 5 (the total cases where at least one is orange). So, 1/5 is the probability.

Wait, but wait, let's approach this from another angle. Alternatively, the probability of getting at least one orange is 5/6 (since in the 6 possible cases, only BB is excluded, which is 1/6). But we're told that at least one is orange, so the sample space is 5 cases.

In those 5 cases, how many have two oranges? Only the OO case. So, the probability is 1/5.

Wait, but wait another thing: another way to compute this is using conditional probability. So, P(A|B) is equal to P(A ∩ B) / P(B).

In this case, event A is that the second ball is orange. But event B is that at least one is orange. So, A is a subset of B because if both are orange, then certainly at least one is orange.

So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), since A is a subset of B. So, P(A) is the probability that both balls are orange. The number of ways to pick two oranges is 1 (since there are two oranges, so the only way is OO). So, the probability is 1/6.

And P(B) is the probability that at least one is orange. As before, that's 5/6.

So, P(A|B) = (1/6) / (5/6) = 1/5.

Wait, so that's 1/5, which is option F.

Alternatively, using the counting method: the number of ways to have both oranges is 1 (only OO). The number of ways that at least one is orange is 5 (as before). So, the probability is 1/5. So, the answer should be F.
</think>

The problem involves conditional probability where we are to find the probability that the other ball is orange given that at least one is orange. 

- Total possible pairs: 4C2 = 6.
- P(B) = probability of at least one orange = 5/6 (excluding the BB case).
- P(A) = probability of both oranges = 1/6.
- Using P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/6)/(5/6) = 1/5.

Answer: F: 1/5
