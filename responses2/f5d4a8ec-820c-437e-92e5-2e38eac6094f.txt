Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this combinatorics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly.

We have a group of 10 people: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. We need to choose a committee of 4 people. There are two restrictions:

1. A and B should not be chosen together.
2. A, C, F should not be chosen together.

I need to find out how many valid committees there are under these conditions.

Hmm, so the problem is about counting the number of 4-person committees from 10, with two exclusion rules. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe using inclusion-exclusion? Because we have two overlapping conditions.

First, without any restrictions, the number of ways to choose 4 people out of 10 is the combination C(10,4). Let me calculate that: 10!/(4!6!) = (10×9×8×7)/(4×3×2×1) = 210. So, 210 possible committees.

Now, let's consider the restrictions.

Restriction 1: A and B cannot be together. So, committees that include both A and B are invalid. How many such committees are there? Well, if both A and B are in the committee, then the remaining two spots are to be filled from the other 8 people (since we can't choose A and B). So, the number of invalid committees for restriction 1 is C(8,2) = 28.

But wait, that's just the number of committees that include both A and B. But we have another restriction, so we might need to adjust for both together.

Restriction 2: A, C, F cannot be together. So, any committee that includes all three A, C, and F is invalid. How many such committees are there? Well, if A, C, F are all in the committee, then the fourth member is chosen from the remaining 7 people (since we've already used A, C, F). So, the number of invalid committees for restriction 2 is C(7,1)=7.

Wait, but now I'm getting into overlapping cases. Because a committee might violate both restrictions. For example, a committee that has A and B and also includes A, C, F. Wait, that can't happen because A is in both. So, in such a case, the committee would have A, B, and maybe others that include C and F. But let me think: if A is in a committee, then for restriction 1, if A is there, B can't be. But for restriction 2, if A is there, then C and F can't both be there. So, a committee that includes A, B, and also includes A, C, F is impossible because A can't be in two places at once. Wait, no, that's not possible because the committee can't have both B and C and F and A. So, the committees that include A, B, C, F are invalid, but those committees are only counted once if we consider both restrictions.

So, perhaps when calculating the total invalid committees for both restrictions, we need to subtract the overlap where committees are invalid due to both restrictions.

Let me outline the steps.

Total possible committees without restrictions: 210.

Subtract the invalid committees under restriction 1: 28. So, 210 -28=182.

Subtract the invalid committees under restriction 2: 7. Now 182-7=175.

But wait, this might not be correct because subtracting both might have subtracted some committees twice if they are invalid under both restrictions. So, we need to add back the committees that are invalid under both restrictions to avoid double-counting.

So, how many committees are invalid under both restrictions 1 and 2?

A committee is invalid under both if it includes both A & B and includes A, C, F. Wait, that's impossible. Because if a committee includes A, it can't have both B and C and F. So, the only way a committee can be invalid under both is if it includes A and B (so A & B) and also includes all three A, C, F. But that's impossible because A can't be in two places at once. So, such a committee doesn't exist. Therefore, there are zero committees that are invalid under both restrictions. So, I don't need to add anything back.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check: can a committee include A, B, and also include A, C, F? Well, if a committee includes A, then for restriction 1, B can't be there. So, if a committee includes A and B, it can't include C or F. But for restriction 2, the committee includes A, so it can't include both C and F. So, a committee that includes A and B would also include A, C, F, which is not possible. So, the two restrictions can't both be violated by the same committee. Therefore, there's no overlap between the two invalid sets. So, we don't need to add anything back.

So, the total invalid committees are 28 (from restriction 1) +7 (from restriction 2) =35. So, the total valid committees would be 210-35=175.

Wait, but wait. Let me verify that. The problem is that when subtracting 28 and 7, we might have subtracted some committees twice. But, as per our earlier analysis, those committees that are invalid under both can't exist, so there's no double subtraction. So, the total invalid is 35, giving 210-35=175.

Looking at the options, option F is 176. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the invalid committees. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the valid committees directly by considering all possible cases.

The valid committees can be categorized based on whether they include A or not.

Case 1: The committee does not include A.

In this case, the restrictions apply to the remaining people (B-C-F-G-H-I-J), but wait, restriction 1 is about A and B, which is already satisfied because A isn't in the committee. Restriction 2 is about A, C, F. Also, since A isn't in the committee, restriction 2 is irrelevant in this case. So, in this case, any committee of 4 from the remaining 9 people (since A is excluded) is allowed.

Wait, no. The problem is that if A is not in the committee, then the restrictions on A and B are automatically satisfied. So, in this case, any 4-person committee from B, C, F, G, H, I, J is allowed, provided that A isn't in it. So, the number of committees here is C(9,4) = 126.

Case 2: The committee includes A.

In this case, we have to ensure that A is present, and that the other three members do not include both B and also don't include all of A, C, F.

Wait, more precisely, from the committee, since A is present, the restrictions are:

- Restriction 1: B cannot be in the committee. So, if A is present, B is excluded.

- Restriction 2: A, C, F cannot all be present. Since A is present, C and F cannot both be present.

So, for a committee including A, the other three members can't have both B and C and F. Because if they do, then A is present, and C and F are present, so that would violate restriction 2.

So, in this case, when A is present, the other three must not include all of C and F, and also not include B.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of possible combinations when A is present.

So, the committee is A plus three others from the remaining 9 people (since A is present), but with two constraints:

- B is not in the committee.

- C and F cannot both be in the committee.

So, the other three members can't include both B and C and F.

Wait, but since B is not in the committee (because of restriction 1), the only constraint is that C and F can't both be present. So, in the other three, if any, they can't have both C and F.

So, when A is in the committee, the other three can be any 3 from the 9 people (excluding A), but excluding the cases where both C and F are present.

Wait, but the other three can include C or F, but not both. So, the number of possible committees when A is present is:

Total number of committees with A and 3 others from the 9 (excluding A) minus the number of committees where both C and F are included in the 3.

So, let's compute that.

Total options for the other three: C(9,3) = 84.

But the number of invalid ones where both C and F are included is: C(7,1), because we have to choose C and F, then one more from the remaining 7 people (excluding A, C, F).

So, the invalid committees are 7.

So, valid committees when A is present are 84 -7 =77.

So, total valid committees in case 2:77.

Adding case 1 and case 2: 126+77=203.

Wait, but that's 203, which is not one of the options. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, the options given are A:184, B:200, C:220, D:150, E:135, F:176, G:210, H:190, I:126, J:165.

Hmm, 203 is not among them. So, perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps my approach to case 2 is incorrect because I'm considering the other three members without considering the exclusion of B. Wait, no: B is already excluded because A is present due to restriction 1.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's try calculating the number of valid committees by considering the restrictions together.

Another approach: calculate the total number of possible committees, subtract the committees that are invalid due to the restrictions, but make sure not to subtract anything more than once.

The total is 210.

Invalid due to restriction 1: C(8,2)=28.

Invalid due to restriction 2: C(7,1)=7.

But if a committee is invalid due to both, that can't happen because A can't be in two places. So, no overlap. So, the total invalid is 28+7=35.

So, 210-35=175.

But earlier, when I considered case 1 and case 2, I got 126+77=203, which is conflicting.

Hmm. So, which is correct? Let me check each approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in case 2.

In case 2, when A is present, the other three can't include both C and F. So, number of invalid is committees that include both C and F, and another one.

So, for the other three, the number of ways to have both C and F is C(7,1)=7. So, committees where A is present and the other three include C and F and one more.

So, the number of such committees is 7.

So, in case 2, the valid committees are 84-7=77.

Case 1: 126.

Total: 126+77=203.

But that's not matching the previous 175.

So, perhaps my first method is incorrect because it's not considering both restrictions together.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to use inclusion-exclusion properly. So, the number of valid committees = total - (invalid due to restriction 1 + invalid due to restriction 2) + (invalid due to both).

But earlier, I thought there's no overlap, so it's 210 -28 -7 +0=175.

But the case-based approach gave 203.

Hmm, which is correct? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering all the constraints properly. Let me try another approach.

Let me model this with cases based on whether A is included or not.

Case 1: A is not in the committee. Then, we have to choose 4 from the remaining 9 (B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J). So, the number of possible committees here is C(9,4)=126.

Case 2: A is in the committee. Then, since A is present, the other three members must not include B (due to restriction 1) and also not include both C and F (due to restriction 2). So, the other three can include C or F, but not both.

So, in this case, the other three can be any 3 from the remaining 9 (excluding A), but with the constraints that they don't include both C and F.

Wait, but let me think: when A is in the committee, the other three can include C or F, but not both. So, the number of ways to choose the other three is:

Total possible without restriction: C(9,3) =84.

Subtract the number of committees where both C and F are included. For those, we have to choose the third member from the remaining 7 (excluding A, C, F). So, that's 7.

So, valid committees in case 2: 84-7=77.

So, total valid committees: 126+77=203.

But according to the inclusion-exclusion approach, it's 175.

Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion approach. Wait, the inclusion-exclusion method considers the two restrictions separately and subtracts their individual invalid cases, but perhaps they are overlapping in more complex ways.

Wait, the inclusion-exclusion approach would be:

Valid = Total - (A ∪ B), where A is the invalid due to restriction 1, B is invalid due to restriction 2.

But |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|.

But earlier I thought |A ∩ B|=0, meaning that no committee is invalid under both restrictions. Let me check that again.

A is the set of committees where A and B are both present. B is the set of committees where all of A, C, F are present.

Can a committee be in both A and B? That would require that A is present (so B is automatically present because B requires A and B) and also that A, C, F are all present. But that's impossible because A can't be in both A and C, F. So, |A ∩ B|=0.

So, |A ∪ B| = 28 (A) +7 (B) -0=35.

So, valid committees =210-35=175.

But then why does the case-based approach give 203?

Hmm. There's a mistake here. Because when I split the cases, perhaps I'm missing some constraints.

Wait, let me think again. When A is present, the other three can't have both C and F. But perhaps the committee also can't have B, because of restriction 1.

So, in case 2, the other three can't include B either.

Wait, but wait: when A is present, restriction 1 says that B can't be present. So, in case 2, the other three can't include B. So, the other three are selected from C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J (excluding A and B). So, in case 2, the other three must all be from the 8 people (excluding A and B). But with the restriction that they can't include both C and F.

So, the number of possible committees when A is present is the number of ways to choose 3 from the 8 (excluding A and B), but subtracting those that include both C and F.

Wait, but in this case, the 8 people are C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. So, the total when choosing 3 is C(8,3)=56.

Now, the number of invalid committees in this case are those that include both C and F. How many are there?

To compute that: we have to choose C and F, and one more from the remaining 6 (excluding A, C, F). So, 6 options.

So, the invalid committees when A is present are 6. So, the valid committees in case 2 are 56-6=50.

Wait, so case 2 would then be 50, not 77. Then, case 1 is 126, so total is 126+50=176, which matches option F.

Ah, I see. Earlier, I assumed that when A is present, the other three can include C and F, but I didn't account for the fact that B is already excluded. So, when A is present, the other three are chosen from 8 (excluding A and B), but in that selection, C and F can't both be present.

So, the correct number in case 2 is 56-6=50. Therefore, 126+50=176, which is option F.

So, the correct answer is 176, which is option F.
</think>

The problem involves selecting a committee of 4 people from 10, with two restrictions:
1. A and B cannot be together.
2. A, C, and F cannot be together.

### Key Steps:

1. **Total Possible Committees Without Restrictions**:  
   The number of ways to choose 4 people from 10 is given by the combination formula:  
   \[
   \binom{10}{4} = 210
   \]

2. **Invalid Committees Due to Restriction 1 (A and B together)**:  
   If both A and B are in the committee, the remaining 2 members are chosen from the other 8 people (since B is already excluded due to the first restriction).  
   \[
   \binom{8}{2} = 28
   \]

3. **Invalid Committees Due to Restriction 2 (A, C, F together)**:  
   If A, C, and F are all in the committee, the fourth member is chosen from the remaining 7 people (since A is already excluded due to the second restriction).  
   \[
   \binom{7}{1} = 7
   \]

4. **Overlap Consideration**:  
   A committee cannot violate both restrictions simultaneously because A cannot be in two places at once. Thus, there is no overlap to adjust for.

5. **Valid Committees Calculation**:  
   Using inclusion-exclusion:  
   \[
   \text{Total Valid} = 210 - (28 + 7) = 210 - 35 = 175
   \]

6. **Case-Based Approach Correction**:  
   When A is present, the other three cannot include both C and F. Thus, the number of valid committees when A is present is:  
   \[
   \binom{8}{3} - \binom{6}{1} = 56 - 6 = 50
   \]

7. **Final Calculation**:  
   Adding the valid committees when A is not present (126) and when A is present (50):  
   \[
   126 + 50 = 176
   \]

### Answer:
The number of valid committees is **176**, which corresponds to option **F**.
