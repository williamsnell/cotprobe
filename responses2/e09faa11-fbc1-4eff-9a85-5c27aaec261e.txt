Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the best estimate for 4,286 multiplied by 390. Hmm, I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with big numbers, but let's take it step by step.

First, I remember that when estimating, it's helpful to round the numbers to make the multiplication easier. Rounding can give a quick approximation, which might help eliminate some options. Let's look at each number:

4,286 is the first number. I think the best way to round this is to the nearest thousand because that would make the number simpler. Since the hundreds digit is 2, which is less than 5, I guess I round it down to 4,000. Wait, but sometimes people round up when it's closer, but here it's 2, so definitely 4,000.

Now the second number is 390. Let's round that. The tens digit is 9, which is more than 5, so I should round up to the nearest hundred. That would make it 400. Alternatively, sometimes people might round it to 400 because the tens digit is 9, but 390 is closer to 400 than to 300. Wait, wait, actually 390 is closer to 400 than to 300 because 390 is 10 away from 400 and 90 away from 300. So yes, 400 is the better estimate.

So now I have two rounded numbers: 4,000 and 400. Multiplying these together should give me a rough idea of the actual product. Let's do that: 4,000 * 400. Hmm, 4*4 is 16, and the zeros: 4,000 has three zeros, and 400 has two. So together, that's 5 zeros. Wait, no, wait: 4,000 is 4 * 10^3, and 400 is 4 * 10^2. So multiplying them gives 16 * 10^(3+2) = 16 * 10^5, which is 1,600,000. So that's 1.6 million.

Wait a second, but wait. Let me double-check because sometimes when multiplying rounded numbers, the actual product might be a bit different. But perhaps this is a good enough estimate.

Looking back at the options, let me see what's available. The options are A:120,000; B:12,000,000; C:1,200,000; D:16,000; E:1,600; F:12,000; G:160,000; H:1,600,000; I:1,200; J:16,000,000.

Wait, the options are all in different orders of magnitude. I estimated around 1.6 million, which is 1.6e6. Looking at the options, option G is 160,000, which is 1.6e5, which is an order of magnitude lower. Option H is 1.6e6, which is exactly what I got. Option J is 1.6e7, which is 16 million. So option H is the closest to my estimate.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe I should compute the exact product to see which option is the closest. Let's calculate 4,286 * 390 accurately.

Alternatively, let's compute it step by step. 4,286 multiplied by 390 can be broken down.

Alternatively, think of 4,286 * 390 as 4,286 * (400 - 10) = 4,286 * 400 - 4,286 *10.

Calculating 4,286 * 400: 4,286 * 4 = 17,144, so 17,144 * 100 (since 400 is 4*100) is 1,714,400.

Then, 4,286 *10 is 42,860. Subtracting: 1,714,400 - 42,860 = 1,671,540. So the exact product is 1,671,540.

Now looking at the options, the closest one is option H:1,600,000. Alternatively, maybe 1.6 million is the best estimate. Let me look at the options again.

Option G is 160,000, which is 1.6 million, but wait no, 160,000 is 0.16 million. Wait, 1,600,000 is 1.6 million. So the exact value is 1,671,540. So that's about 1.67 million. So the closest option would be H:1,600,000. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for an estimate without the exact calculation, so using rounded numbers would give H.

Wait, the question says "the best estimate". So perhaps the question allows for some approximation, not necessarily the exact number. So if I round 4,286 to 4,000, and 390 to 400, the product is 1,600,000, which is option H. Alternatively, maybe 390 is closer to 400, but perhaps using 390 would give a different result.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question expects me to round each number to the nearest significant figure. Let's see:

4,286 is approximately 4,000 (nearest 1000). 390 is approximately 400 (nearest 100). Multiplying those gives 1,600,000.

Alternatively, perhaps some people might round 390 to 300, but that's a big difference. 390 is closer to 400 than 300.

So, the estimated product is 1.6 million, which is option H. Looking at the options, H is 1,600,000, which is exactly 1.6 million. So that's the best estimate.
