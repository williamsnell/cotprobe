Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I want to make sure I understand it correctly. Let me read it again.

The question says that Count Rumford observed that using cannon boring machinery, a single horse could heat 11.6 kg of ice water (which is at 273 K) to 355 K in 2.5 hours. The problem then asks, assuming the same rate of work, how high a horse could raise a 225 kg weight in 2.5 minutes. The options are given in meters.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the height the horse can raise using the same amount of work as heating that much ice. The key here is to find the work done in heating the water and then apply that same work to lift the weight, calculating the height.

First, I should calculate the amount of heat energy required to raise the ice from 273 K to 355 K. The formula for heat is Q = m * c * ΔT, where m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

The mass of the water is 11.6 kg. Wait, but the specific heat capacity given is in J/K/g. Oh, right, so I need to convert the mass to grams because the c is in J/(K·g). 11.6 kg is 11,600 grams.

The specific heat capacity c is 4.18 J/K·g. The change in temperature is 355 K - 273 K = 82 K.

So putting that into the formula: Q = 11600 g * 4.18 J/(K·g) * 82 K.

Let me compute that. First, multiply 11600 by 4.18. 11600 * 4 is 46,400, and 11600 * 0.18 is 2,088. So 46,400 + 2,088 = 48,488 J. Then multiply that by 82 K.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate that. 48,488 J/K·g * 82 K. Oh wait, no—no, no, no—the units are correct here.

Wait a second, no. Let me do the math step by step. 11600 * 4.18 is:

11600 * 4 = 46,400
11600 * 0.18 = 2,088
So adding those gives 48,488 J/K·g.

But wait, that's when you have per gram. So for 11600 grams, it's 11600 * 48,488 J? No, wait, that can't be right because 11600 g * 4.18 J/(K·g) * 82 K.

Wait, no, the formula is correct. The 4.18 is per gram, so 11600 grams * 4.18 J/(g·K) * 82 K = (11600 * 4.18 *82 ) J.

Let me compute that step by step. Let's do 11600 * 4.18 first. 11600 *4 is 46,400. 11600 *0.18 is 2,088. So 46,400 +2,088 = 48,488. Then multiply by 82.

Hmm, 48,488 *82: Let me compute that.

48,488 *80 = 3,879,040

48,488 *2 = 96,976

Adding those: 3,879,040 + 96,976 = 3,976,016 J.

Wait, is that right? Because that's a lot of energy. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the calculation.

Wait, 11600 *4.18 = 11600 *4.18. Let's compute 11600 *4 = 46,400. 11600 *0.18 is 2,088, so total 48,488 J/(kg·K) * 82 K.

Wait, no, sorry, the m is in kg, but in grams, so 11600 grams. So the m is 11600 g, so the Q is m*c*ΔT = 11600 g *4.18 J/(g·K) *82 K.

So that's 11600 *4.18 = 48,488 J/K. Then multiply by 82 K.

48,488 *82. Let's compute that.

48,488 *80 = 3,879,040

48,488 *2 = 96,976

So total is 3,879,040 +96,976 = 3,976,016 J.

Wait, that's about 3.976 million joules. That seems a lot, but maybe it's correct.

So the work done is 3,976,016 joules.

Now, this same work is used to lift the 225 kg weight in 2.5 minutes. We need to find the height.

Power is work over time. But first, we need to find the power, then use work = force * distance (which is the same as power * time).

Alternatively, since work done is equal to the change in potential energy, which is mgh, where h is the height. So, the work done would be mgh = 3,976,016 J.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The work done by the horse is the same as the heat, so yes, mgh = 3,976,016 J.

Wait, wait, but the units here: the mass is 225 kg, and specific gravity is 1, so m is in kg.

So, m =225 kg, g=9.8 m/s², h is the unknown.

So,

225 kg *9.8 m/s² * h = 3,976,016 J

So,

h = 3,976,016 J / (225 *9.8 )

Compute denominator: 225 *9.8 = let's compute that.

225 * 9 = 2025, 225 *0.8=180; sum is 2025 +180=2205.

So denominator is 2205.

So h = 3,976,016 /2205.

Compute that.

Let me do the division: 3,976,016 ÷ 2205.

Well, let's see. 2205 * 1800 = 2205 *1000=2,205,000; 2205 *800=1,764,000. So 1000+800=1800: 2,205,000+1,764,000= 3,969,000.

So 2205 * 1800 = 3,969,000.

Subtract that from 3,976,016: 3,976,016 -3,969,000=7,016.

Now, 2205 *3=6,615. So 3,969,000 +6,615=3,975,615. Then 7,016-6,615=401.

So h is approximately 1800 +3 =1803 meters, and then 401/2205 is about 0.182.

So h ≈1803.182 m. Wait, that's about 1803 meters, which is way more than any of the options given. That can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, hmm. Because the options are all in the range of 10-50 meters. So perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the calculation of the work done. Let me go back.

Wait, the first part was the work done to heat the ice, which was 3,976,016 J. Then, that same work is used to lift the horse. So that makes sense.

But wait, if the horse is using the same rate, then the amount of work done is the same, which is 3.976e6 J.

So, for the second part: mgh = 3.976e6 J, m=225 kg, g=9.8 m/s².

So,

h = 3.976e6 / (225 *9.8 )

Let me recompute that.

Denominator: 225 *9.8 = 2205.

So h=3,976,016 / 2205. Let's compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 3,976,016 divided by 2205.

Well, 2205 *1800 = 3,969,000.

3,976,016 - 3,969,000 =7,016.

So 7,016 /2205 ≈ 3.18 m.

So total h is 1800 +3.18 =1803.18 m. That's about 1803 meters. But the options are all under 50 meters. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, in the first part, the ice is 11.6 kg, which is 11,600 grams. Correct.

c is 4.18 J/(g·K). Correct.

ΔT is 82 K, correct.

So Q = m*c*ΔT =11600 *4.18 *82.

Wait, 11600 *4.18 is 48488 J/K. Multiply by 82 K gives 48488*82= 3,976,016 J. That seems correct.

So then, in the second part, m=225 kg, g=9.8 m/s², h =3,976,016/(225*9.8)=3,976,016/(2205). Wait, that's what I did before.

Wait, but perhaps the time is in minutes? The problem says in 2.5 minutes. Does that affect anything? No, because power is work over time; but since the question is about the same rate, the time doesn't change the amount of work.

Wait, maybe I should use the same rate of work, which is Q/t. Since the same rate applies, the work done would be the same. So that part should be correct.

But wait, maybe I messed up the initial calculation of the heat. Let me recompute.

11600 g * 4.18 J/(g·K) *82 K. Let's break it down.

11600 *4.18 = 48,488 J/K. Multiply by 82 K.

So 48,488 *82 = ?

Let me compute 48,488 *80 = 3,879,040.

48,488 *2 = 96,976.

Adding gives 3,879,040 +96,976 = 3,976,016 J. Correct.

So the first part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the horse is using the same rate of work. So, the power is the same. So the work done is same, so h = work/(mgh). Wait, no, mgh is the potential energy, which equals the work.

Wait, but the horse's power is work per time. So, if the time is 2.5 minutes, that's 150 seconds (since 2.5 min *60=150s). So the power is 3,976,016 J /150 s ≈26,506.77 W.

Then, the work done for the second part is 3,976,016 J. So, to find the height, it's the same as mgh = work. So h=work/(m g).

Wait, but that's the same as before, so h is about 1803 m, which is way beyond the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the heat capacity is for water, but the mass is 11.6 kg, and the ice is 11.6 kg. So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe I should check the specific heat formula again. The specific heat is 4.18 J/K·g. So yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I did the initial calculation wrong. Let me compute 11600 *4.18 *82 again.

11600 *4.18 = (11600 *4) + (11600 *0.18) = 46,400 + 2,088 = 48,488.

48,488 *82 = ?

Let me compute 48,488 *80 = 3,879,040.

48,488 *2 = 96,976.

Adding: 3,879,040 +96,976 = 3,976,016. Correct.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I've used 2.5 hours for the first part and 2.5 minutes for the second. But the work done is the same. So that shouldn't affect the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the time because the horse is working at the same rate, but that should not impact the total work. Hmm.

Oh wait, maybe the initial calculation of the heat was wrong. Let me think: 11.6 kg of water, specific heat 4.18, temp from 273 to 355 K.

Wait, 355-273=82 K. So that part is correct.

Another possibility: perhaps I confused the work done with the potential energy. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula for work done.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute the power used, then find the work done over 2.5 minutes.

Wait, the initial power is Q/t = (3,976,016 J)/(2.5*3600 s) = 3,976,016 /9000 ≈441.78 W.

Then, for 2.5 minutes (150s), the work is 441.78 *150 ≈66,267 J.

Wait, but that's a lot less than the 3.9 million J. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, no, because the initial calculation of the heat is 3.976e6 J, but the horse can use that same amount of work to do the lifting.

But wait, that approach would give the same result as before, which is 1803 meters, way too high. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial part.

Wait, maybe I should compute the mass in kg instead of grams. Let me try that.

Wait, 11.6 kg is correct. So 11.6 kg *4.18 J/(kg·K) *82 K.

So,

11.6 *4.18 = 48.148 J/K. Multiply by 82 K: 48.148 *82.

48 *82 = 3936. 0.148 *82 ≈12.176. So total is about 3936 +12.176=3948.176 J. But wait, that's way lower than 3.9e6 J. Oh no! I think I messed up the units here.

Wait, 11.6 kg is 11,600 grams. But when using kg, 11.6 kg *4.18 J/(kg·K) *82 K.

Wait, 11.6 *4.18 =48.148 J/K. Multiply by 82 K: 48.148 *82=3948.176 J.

Wait, earlier I had 11600 g *4.18 *82, which gave 3,976,016 J. Oh! There's the mistake. Because when using grams, 11600 g *4.18 J/(g·K) *82 K = 3,976,016 J. But when using kg, 11.6 kg *4.18 J/(kg·K) *82 K = 3,948 J. Which is way smaller.

Wait, that's a big difference. So why the discrepancy? Because when using grams, I have to multiply by 1e3 to get kg. Oh, because 11.6 kg is 11600 grams, so when using grams, the calculation is correct. But when using kg, I have to multiply by 1e3.

So that's the mistake. So the correct calculation for the heat is 3,948 J.

Wait, so that's a big difference. So, let me recompute.

Using kg:

m=11.6 kg,

c=4.18 J/(kg·K),

ΔT=82 K.

So Q = m * c *ΔT =11.6 *4.18 *82.

So 11.6 *4.18 = let's compute 11 *4.18 =46. 0.6*4.18=2.508. Sum: 46 + 2.508=48.508.

Multiply that by 82:

48.508 *80 = 3,880.64,

48.508 *2 =97.016,

Total: 3,880.64 +97.016=3,977.656 J.

Wait, that's about 3,977.66 J. But earlier, when I used grams, I got 3,948,176 J. So which one is right?

Wait, the confusion arises from whether the mass is in grams or kilograms. Let me clarify.

When the problem says "11.6 kg of water", that's correct. So using kg in the calculation, I should get 3,977.66 J.

Wait, but when I used grams, I had 3,976,016 J. So why the discrepancy?

Ah! Because when using grams, I have to convert kg to grams. Wait, no, when using kg in the formula, I can compute directly. Wait, no, the mistake is that when using kg, I have to multiply by 1e3 to get grams, but perhaps I did that in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute using grams, but that would require knowing the m in grams. Let me try that again.

Using grams:

m=11,600 grams,

c=4.18 J/(g·K),

ΔT=82 K.

So,

Q=11,600 *4.18 *82.

Compute 11,600 *4.18 =48,488 J/K.

Then multiply by 82: 48,488 *82 =3,976,016 J.

Wait, that's correct. So why earlier when using kg, I got 3,948 J? Because in that earlier approach, I mistakenly thought that 11.6 kg is 11,600 grams, but perhaps I had a miscalculation when computing 11.6 *4.18.

Wait, 11.6 *4.18 should be:

11 *4.18=46.98,

0.6*4.18=2.508,

Sum:46.98 +2.508=49.488.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 48.508, which is incorrect. So 11.6 *4.18 =49.488, not 48.508. So miscalculation.

So correct calculation is 11.6 *4.18=49.488, multiply by 82: 49.488 *82.

Calculating:

49 *82=4, 9*80=720, no, wait, 49*80=3,920, 49*2=98; so 3,920 +98=4,018.

Wait, 49 *82 = (40*82)+(9*82)=3,280 +738=3,280+738=4,018.

0.488 *82: 0.4*82=33.2, 0.08*82=6.56, 0.008*82=0.656.

So 33.2 +6.56=39.76 +0.656=40.416.

So total Q=4,018 +40.416=4,058.416 J.

Wait, that's about 4,058 J.

Wait, that's much lower than the 3.976e6 J I thought earlier. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 49.488 *82.

Let me compute 49.488 *80 = 3,959.04,

Then 49.488 *2 =98.976,

Add: 3,959.04 +98.976=4,058.016 J.

Ah, so that's about 4,058 J. Which is much lower than the 3.976e6 J I calculated earlier.

So this suggests that the correct way is to use grams, getting about 4,058 J, which would lead to a much lower height.

But that's not matching the earlier options. So perhaps I made another mistake.

Wait, another possible mistake: perhaps I confused the formula for work done in lifting. Maybe I should compute the potential energy, which is mgh, and set that equal to the work done. So:

mgh = work.

Then, h = work/(m g).

Wait, so with work being 3,976,016 J, m=225 kg, g=9.8 m/s².

So,

h = 3,976,016 / (225 *9.8).

As before, denominator is 2205.

So,

h = 3,976,016 /2205 ≈1803.18 m.

Which is way beyond any of the options given. So the correct answer can't be any of the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct work done. If the work done is 3,976,016 J, then h=3,976,016/(225*9.8)≈1803 m, which is not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the initial problem wasn't correctly read. Let me read the problem again.
