Question:

A woman who was three months pregnant enrolled in a pre-natal and post-natal exercise program at the local gymnasium. The contract signed by the woman was to last for one year and called upon the woman to pay $2,000 in quarterly payments of $500. The contract also specified that all fees were non-refundable. Upon signing the contract, the woman made her first payment of $500 and started classes the next day. The woman attended classes on a regular basis for the next three months. At the end of the three-month period, the woman was involved in an automobile accident. Although she was not seriously injured, her doctor advised the woman that she needed complete rest. Her doctor told her to avoid strenuous activity and advised her to discontinue her pre-natal exercise classes. One week later, the woman received a billing notice from the gymnasium, indicating that her second installment payment of $500 was past due. She immediately telephoned the manager of the gymnasium and informed him that she would not be attending any further classes because of her accident. Also, the woman said she did not feel obligated to make any additional payments. Which of the following most accurately describes the woman's duty to pay the gymnasium the second installment fee of $500?

Options:

A: It would not be excused, because the woman did not negotiate a clause in the contract that would allow for cancellation in the event of a health emergency.
B: It would not be excused, because the woman voluntarily entered into the contract knowing that it was non-refundable.
C: It would be excused, because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated.
D: It would not be excused, because the woman's inability to attend the classes does not affect the gymnasium's ability to provide them.
E: It would be excused, because the accident was an unforeseen event that made it impossible for her to continue the classes.
F: It would be excused, because the woman's health conditions changed due to no fault of her own.
G: It would not be excused, because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable.
H: It would be not excused, because her covenant to make the installment payment is also enforceable as a condition precedent.
I: It would be excused, because of impossibility of performance.
J: It would not be excused, as the gymnasium offered services that the woman could no longer use due to personal reasons.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about contract excusability. Let's read through it again carefully.

So, a woman signed a pre-natal and post-natal exercise program contract. It lasted a year, with quarterly payments of $500 each. All fees are non-refundable. She paid the first $500 and started classes the next day. She attended classes regularly for three months. Then, she had an accident. Her doctor advised her to avoid strenuous activity and stop attending classes. A week later, the gym received a bill notice saying the second installment was past due. She called the manager and said she won't be attending any more classes because of the accident. Also, she said she didn't feel obligated to make additional payments.

The question is about whether she's excused from paying the second installment because of her accident.

The options are A to J, with various reasons. I need to determine which is the best explanation.

First, what's the general rule about excusability in contracts? I remember that there are several factors that can excite a party, like breach of contract, unforeseen circumstances, lack of necessity, or something else.

In this case, the woman was under contract to pay $500 each installment. She was supposed to make payments every quarter. She did the first one, then started classes. She attended regularly for three months. Then she had an accident and stopped. But the gym received a bill for the second payment, which was past due. She called the manager and said she won't pay anymore.

So, the issue is whether she can excite the second payment.

First, options:

A: Not excusable because no contract clause allows cancellation in a health emergency.

B: Not excusable because she voluntarily entered into the contract knowing it was non-refundable.

C: Excusable because essential purpose was frustrated.

D: Not excusable because inability to attend doesn't affect gym's ability.

E: Excused because of impossibility of performance.

F: Excused because health conditions changed due to no fault.

G: Not excusable because fees were non-refundable.

H: Excusable because covenant is enforceable as condition precedent.

I: Excused because of impossibility.

J: Excused because gym services can't be used due to personal reasons.

Hmm. So, let's think about each factor.

First, the contract specifies non-refundable fees. So if she had to pay the second installment, and it's non-refundable, maybe that's a reason for excusability. Because if the contract says it's non-refundable, then she can't get a refund, so she might be excused. But I think in some jurisdictions, non-refundable contracts can sometimes allow excusability if there was a breach in necessity or something else.

Wait, what's the general rule here. The contract says all fees are non-refundable. So, if the woman had to pay the second installment, and it's non-refundable, perhaps she can't get a refund, but can she still be excused?

In some cases, non-refundable contracts can allow excusability when there was an unforeseen event that prevented the performance. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the reason for excusability might be that she was under contract to make the payments, and the reason she couldn't pay is because the gym couldn't provide the classes, which was an unforeseen event. Or maybe because of her health, which could be an unforeseen event.

Wait, another angle: the gymnasium offered services because she was under contract. She was supposed to pay. But if it's non-refundable, perhaps she can still be excused because she didn't perform, but the contract didn't say anything about whether the performance was necessary.

Wait, the contract says the essential purpose was to pay the fees. So if she didn't perform, can she still be excused? I think that's a point. If the essential purpose is fulfilled, but the performance was prevented, you might not be excused.

Wait, but the essential purpose is to provide the classes. If she couldn't attend, did the contract say anything about that? The contract is only about the fees being non-refundable. But the contract didn't say anything about whether she was required to pay or not.

But in this case, she was required to pay. So, perhaps she's excusable because the contract's essential purpose is to provide the classes, and she couldn't perform because of the accident.

Wait, I think the key issue is whether the contract's lack of refundable fees allows for excusability. If the contract's essential purpose is fulfilled (she paid the bill), then maybe she can be excused because of an unforeseen event.

Wait, but the contract's terms are non-refundable. So if she can't get a refund, but the essential purpose was fulfilled, does that mean she's excusable?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think of the factors for excusability. One common factor is that the performance was prevented by an unforeseen event. So if the gym couldn't perform because of her accident, that's an unforeseen event, and the contract didn't mention that. So maybe that's a reason for excusability.

Alternatively, the contract's non-refundable nature might allow her to be excused.

Wait, another point: some contracts allow excusability if the performance was due to unforeseen circumstances, but the contract doesn't mention that.

Wait, I remember that in some states, non-refundable contracts can excite excusability if there was an unforeseen event that prevented performance. So, if she had to pay the second installment, and the contract said the payments were non-refundable, then she can be excused because the performance was prevented by an unforeseen event.

So perhaps the reason is that the contract's non-refundable clause allows for excusability. So the answer would be G, because it's non-refundable.

But let's think about the other options. Option A is about no contract clause allowing cancellation in a health emergency. If the contract had a clause, like, if you can cancel at any time, but here the contract is non-refundable. So maybe A applies if the contract allowed cancellation in a health emergency. But the contract doesn't say anything about that.

Option E says the gym couldn't perform because of the impossibility. But she was under contract, so she should have been able to pay. Unless the gym didn't offer the classes because her health made it impossible. But the contract didn't say that. It just says the gym is providing services. So perhaps the impossibility was due to her personal reasons, making the contract's performance impossible.

So, if the contract's performance was impossible because of her health (like she couldn't attend because of an accident), then that's a reason for excusability. So that would be option F, which says the health conditions changed due to her no-fault. But the question is whether the gym couldn't perform due to her health. The gym's performance was possible because she was under contract. So perhaps the reason is option I: impossibility because personal reasons.

Wait, but the question is about whether she was excused. So if the gym couldn't perform due to her health, that's a reason for excusability because the performance was frustrated. So that would make option I correct.

But wait, the contract's essential purpose is to provide the classes. So if she couldn't attend, but she was required to pay, maybe she's excused because the performance was due to unforeseen events. But the contract didn't say that. So perhaps the non-refundable part allows excusability.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to see each option.

Option A: No clause allowing cancellation in a health emergency. The contract doesn't say that, so A isn't applicable.

Option B: She voluntarily entered the contract knowing it's non-refundable. But she didn't enter voluntarily. She's the one under contract, so she's the one who should be excused. So B isn't relevant.

Option C: Excused because the essential purpose was frustrated. The essential purpose is fulfilled because she paid. So maybe that's not the reason.

Option D: Not excusable because the gym couldn't perform. But the gym's performance was possible because she was under contract. So if performance was impossible due to her health, it would be excusable. So D is not correct.

Option E: Excused because impossibility of performance. The gym couldn't perform because of her health. So that would be a reason for excusability, but is that part of the contract? The contract just says that it's non-refundable. So E isn't a reason unless the contract specifies that.

Option F: Health conditions changed. If the woman's health made it impossible, then yes, the contract's performance was frustrated. So that would be a reason for excusability.

Option G: Non-refundable. So if she couldn't get a refund because she had to pay, perhaps she's excused.

Option H: Covenants are enforceable as condition precedent. So if she had to pay, maybe that's why.

Option I: Impossibility due to personal reasons. So if the woman couldn't pay because of her health, then it's excusable.

So, looking back, the options are:

The woman was under contract to pay $500 each. She paid the first. She was supposed to attend classes regularly for three months. She had an accident, so she stopped. The gym received a bill notice for the second installment, so she didn't pay that. She called the manager and said she won't pay anymore.

Now, the question is whether she's excused from paying the second installment.

So, the key points are:

1. The contract is non-refundable.

2. She had to pay the second installment, which was due.

3. She was under contract to pay.

4. She was required to make the payment.

The issue is whether she's excused for not paying because of her health emergency.

Alternatively, the non-refundable clause allows for excusability because she couldn't get a refund. So she's excused.

Wait, but I remember that non-refundable contracts can sometimes excite excusability, but only if the performance was prevented by an unforeseen event. So in this case, the gym couldn't perform because of her health, which is an unforeseen event.

So, if that's the case, then G is a possible answer. Because the contract's essential purpose was frustrated because the performance was due to an unforeseen event. The contract doesn't say anything about whether performance was necessary, so the non-refundable part allows excusability.

Wait, no. The essential purpose is fulfilled (she paid the second installment), so perhaps she's excused because of the non-refundable clause.

Alternatively, another approach: the contract's non-refundable part allows her to be excused. So the correct answer would be G.

Wait, but let's think about the contract's terms. The contract doesn't say anything about the necessity of the performance. It just says it's non-refundable. So, if it's non-refundable, she's excused because she couldn't get a refund, but she had to pay. So, she's excused because the contract's non-refundable clause allows for excusability.

Alternatively, the contract's non-refundable clause allows excusability because the performance was prevented by an unforeseen event (her health emergency).

So, the correct answer would be G or A.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me try to recall the rule.

In the case of a non-refundable contract, the excusability might not apply because the performance wasn't due to an unforeseen event, but the contract's terms might not address it.

But some states allow excusability for non-refundable contracts if the performance was due to an unforeseen event. So, in this case, if the gym couldn't perform because of her health (unforeseen), the contract allows excusability.

So, the correct answer would be G or F.

Wait, option F says the health conditions changed due to no fault of her own. The woman's health was due to no fault, so that's a personal reason. So if the gym couldn't perform because of her health, then it's an unforeseen event.

Wait, but the contract doesn't say anything about her health. So perhaps the contract's performance was due to her health. So maybe the reason is F.

Alternatively, the contract's non-refundable nature allows excusability because she couldn't get a refund, so she's excused.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the options again.

The question is about which of these options best describes the woman's duty to pay the second installment.

So, if the contract is non-refundable, and she has to pay, perhaps she's excused because the contract's mandatory purposes were fulfilled. So, the correct answer would be G, because the contract's essential purpose was frustrated.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think in some jurisdictions, non-refundable contracts allow for excusability if the performance was due to an unforeseen event. So, in this case, the gym couldn't provide classes due to her health, which is an unforeseen event. So, that's a reason for excusability.

So the answer would be G: It would be excused, because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated.

Alternatively, if the contract's performance was frustrated because of a health emergency, then option F would be correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, but I think that when the contract is non-refundable, the excusability isn't automatically granted unless the performance was due to an unforeseen event.

I think the answer is G: It would be excused, because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated.

Wait, another approach: the key point is that the contract's essential purpose is fulfilled (she paid), so if the performance was due to an unforeseen event, which the contract doesn't specify, the contract allows excusability.

But the problem is that the contract doesn't state that the performance was due to an unforeseen event. It just says the fees are non-refundable.

So perhaps the answer is G: It would be excused, because the essential purpose was frustrated.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, the answer is F: Because her health conditions changed due to no fault of her own.

Wait, but the contract didn't say anything about her health. So she faced a personal reason, but that's not an unforeseen event. Unless the gym's performance was impossible because of her health, which is an unforeseen event.

Wait, but the contract doesn't say that. So perhaps the reason is F, because the health was due to her own fault, but that's not an event that was unforeseen.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of which option is correct.

Another approach: The key is whether the contract's terms allow her to be excused. If the contract is non-refundable, that might allow excusability, but the performance was due to her health, which is a personal reason that's not necessarily an unforeseen event.

So, perhaps the correct answer is G, because the essential purpose was frustrated.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think some states allow excusability for non-refundable contracts if the performance was due to an unforeseen event.

In this case, the contract is non-refundable, and the performance was due to her health emergency, which is an unforeseen event. So the correct answer would be G.

Alternatively, if the contract doesn't mention that, then it's not G, but F.

I think the correct answer is G.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: The contract's non-refundable part doesn't prevent you from excusing yourself for not paying the bill. So, if she had to pay the second installment, and it's non-refundable, she's excused.

So, the correct answer is G.
</think>

The woman enrolled in a pre-natal and post-natal exercise program that lasted a year with non-refundable fees. She paid the first installment and was scheduled to attend classes for three months. After attending, she was involved in an automobile accident, which advised her to stop attending classes. The gym received a bill notice for the second installment, and she called the manager to inform her of her decision to discontinue further classes. The question is whether she was excused from paying the second installment due to her accident.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A**: Incorrect. There is no clause in the contract that explicitly allows excusability for a health emergency. The contract only states that fees are non-refundable.

2. **Option B**: Incorrect. The woman was not voluntarily entering into the contract knowing it was non-refundable. She was under contract and would be excused if excusability applies.

3. **Option C**: Incorrect. Excusability is not guaranteed when the contract's essential purpose (paying the second installment) was frustrated by an unforeseen event (her accident).

4. **Option D**: Incorrect. The woman did not have a contractual obligation to make the second installment, nor was her decision to discontinue classes excused by the contract's terms.

5. **Option E**: Incorrect. The gym could not be excused from performing classes because the contract's essential purpose was fulfilled (she paid the second installment).

6. **Option F**: Incorrect. The woman's health conditions were due to her own fault, not an unforeseen event. The contract does not specify that performance was required to be unforeseen.

7. **Option G**: Correct. The contract's essential purpose was frustrated because the performance was due to an unforeseen event (her accident). The non-refundable clause allows excusability.

8. **Option H**: Incorrect. The contract does not explicitly allow excusability for a contractual obligation to continue classes.

9. **Option I**: Incorrect. The gym's inability to perform due to her personal reasons is not considered an unforeseen event.

10. **Option J**: Incorrect. The gym could not be excused from providing services due to personal reasons.

### Conclusion:
The woman was excused from paying the second installment because her accident frustrated the performance of the exercise program. The non-refundable clause in the contract allows excusability for unforeseen events.
