Okay, so I've got this question here where I need to express two fractions as percentages: 2/5 and 1/100. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my math, but let's try to break it down.

First, I remember that to convert a fraction to a percentage, you multiply the fraction by 100 and then add the percent sign. So for 2/5, I'll do 2 divided by 5, and then multiply by 100. Let me think, what's 2 divided by 5? Oh right, 2 divided by 5 is 0.4 because 5 goes into 2 zero times, then 5 into 20 is 4 times (5x4=20). Wait, no, 5x0.4 is 2. So 2/5 is 0.4 as a decimal. Multiply by 100 gives 40%, so that's the first part.

Now for 1/100. That one seems simpler. If I divide 1 by 100, I get 0.01. Multiply by 100, that's 1%. So the second part is 1%.

Looking at the options, I need to find the pair that has 40% and 1%. Let's check the options.

Option A: 40%, 0.25% → No, the second part is 0.25%, not 1%.
Option B: 40%, 1% → Yes, that's the pair we're looking for.
Option C: 35%, 0.75% → No, both are way off.
Option D: 50%, 1% → First part is 50%, wrong.
Option E: 40%, 0.5% → No, second part 0.5% is incorrect.
Option F: 20%, 0.5% → No, both are too low.
Option G: 20%, 0.25% → No, first part is 20%, which is wrong.
Option H: 50%, 0.5% → First part is wrong.
Option I: 30%, 0.25% → No.
Option J: 20%, 1% → First part is 20% which is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option B, which is 40% and 1%.
