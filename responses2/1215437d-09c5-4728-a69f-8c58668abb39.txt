Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about natural resources and which country is least self-sufficient in modern industry. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the question. It's asking which of the listed countries has the least reliance on imported natural resources compared to itself. So, the least self-sufficient. That means I'm looking for the country where industries or sectors require a lot more foreign-made resources than they can produce domestically.

I remember that some countries have a lot of natural resources, but many are still relying on imported materials. For example, Japan is known for its heavy industry, including steel and other metals, but I think they have a lot of their own. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Japan. I know Japan is a big country with a lot of manufacturing, especially electronics and automotive. Their steel industry is pretty self-sufficient. I think they have significant mining resources, but maybe not as high as some of the others.

Option B: Canada. Canada is a big mining country. They have a vast amount of coal, copper, and other minerals. But they might import some energy like oil, which is a significant part of their economy. So, maybe Canada is moderately self-reliant, but not the least.

Option C: Australia. Australia is another mining heavy country. They have a lot of gold and copper, but they also import a lot of energy, like natural gas. I'm not sure if they're self-sufficient in all areas, but they do import a lot, so maybe they're not the least.

Option D: France. France has a significant coal endowment, especially in Europe. They also import a lot of oil, which is a major component of their energy. So, France's reliance on imports is high.

Option E: Brazil. Brazil is known for its agricultural products. They have a lot of coffee, bananas, and sugar. But their main industry is agriculture, so they might import a lot of inputs like fertilizers and machinery. Wait, but the question is about natural resources, so maybe Brazil's agricultural resources are self-reliant, or do they import a lot?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about natural resources needed for modern industry. So, natural resources in general, not necessarily the agricultural ones.

Option F: China. China has a large natural resource base. They import a lot of oil, natural gas, and many minerals. They also have a vast energy sector, but their main industry is manufacturing. So, they're heavily reliant on imports for resources, which would make them the least self-sufficient.

Option G: United Kingdom. The UK is another big producer of natural resources. They import a lot of energy, including oil and natural gas, but their domestic resources are significant. So, they're not the least self-sufficient.

Option H: Germany. Germany's natural resources include a lot of coal and minerals, but they import a lot of energy, like oil and natural gas. They might be moderately self-reliant but not the least.

Option I: United States. The US is a major exporter of natural resources. They have a lot of coal, natural gas, and minerals. But they import a lot of energy and have a large energy sector. So, they're heavily dependent on imports.

Option J: Russia. Russia has a vast natural resource endowment, especially in minerals and energy. They import a lot of energy and a significant portion of their resources. So, they're not the least.

Wait, but I need to determine which is LEAST self-sufficient. So, which country's industry uses the most imported resources compared to self-produced.

China is known for its agriculture but not for its natural resources. Their main industry is manufacturing, which requires a lot of domestic resources. Also, their natural resources (like minerals, energy) are mainly imported. For example, China imports a lot of oil and natural gas. So, their energy resources are not self-sufficient. Also, their agricultural products don't rely as much on domestic resources compared to, say, the US or Japan.

Wait, but the question is about natural resources, so all of their resources, not just the ones used in industry. So, for example, China imports a lot of energy, which is a natural resource. So, their reliance on imports is high compared to their own resources.

So, looking at the options, which country has the least self-sufficiency? It's probably China because their natural resources (like coal, minerals) are mainly imported, and their main industries (manufacturing) also require a lot of imports.

Another point: Japan has a lot of its own resources, especially in mining. For example, Japan's own coal production is high. They also have a lot of steel, which is self-sufficient. So, perhaps Japan is more self-sufficient than China.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the least self-sufficient. China uses a lot of imports for natural resources. For example, China imports a lot of natural gas and oil, which are part of their natural resources. So, without these imports, their ability to produce their own resources would be minimal.

So, the answer is probably China, option F.

The question asks which country is LEAST self-sufficient in modern industry, meaning it relies the most on imported natural resources. Analysis of each option:

- **Japan (A)**: Known for its extensive mining and manufacturing, with a significant domestic energy base. It's moderately self-reliant.
- **Canada (B)**: Relies on imports of oil and energy, but its natural resources are self-sufficient.
- **Australia (C)**: Also depends on imports, though its mining is substantial.
- **France (D)**: Relying on oil imports, but has a substantial domestic energy base.
- **Brazil (E)**: While agricultural, its main industry (agriculture) is self-reliant. However, natural resources like coffee and bananas might have a reliance on imports, but the question focuses on natural resources used in industry.
- **China (F)**: A major exporter of natural resources (minerals, oil, gas), with a large domestic energy base. Its main industry (manufacturing) requires a significant reliance on imports.
- **United Kingdom (G)**: Relies on energy imports but has a substantial domestic resource base.
- **Germany (H)**: Mines and imports are significant, but its industry is self-reliant.
- **United States (I)**: Relies heavily on imports, especially of energy.
- **Russia (J)**: Relies on energy and natural resources, but its domestic endowment is substantial.

**Conclusion**: **China (F)** is the least self-sufficient because it imports a large portion of its natural resources (oil, natural gas, minerals) and relies heavily on these imports for its operations.

Answer: F
