Okay, so I've got this question about custody rights and welfare benefits termination. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is asking what type of process is required for both the termination of a parent's custody rights and the termination of welfare benefits. The options are A to I, with the correct answer probably being one of these.

First, I remember that in many legal systems, especially those involving custody and welfare benefits, there's a process of investigation or hearing before a court or a panel. This process is called a termination hearing. 

In such a hearing, the court may first conduct a prior notice phase, where the relevant parties are informed. This is often called a notice hearing. I think the idea is to get everyone who might be affected to be informed so they can respond if needed.

After that, there's an opportunity to respond. The parties can provide evidence or arguments about why they might be entitled to the benefits or custody. This response could be a motion or a reply to the court's initial findings.

If the court decides that the termination is appropriate, then the process moves to a final hearing where the court makes its decision. But the question is about the type of process required for termination, not whether it's a final decision.

Looking at the options, the question is about both termination of custody and welfare benefits. So the process must involve prior notice first, then the opportunity to respond. Let me check each option:

Option A: Prior screening by neutral fact finder. I'm not sure if this is a standard process. Neutral fact finder sounds more like a legal aid process where someone tries to find evidence without the court's involvement.

Option B: Prior screening, notice, and opportunity to respond. Wait, prior screening might not be the right term here. Maybe this is mixing things up. I think prior notice is more about informing the parties.

Option C: Prior notice and prior evidentiary hearing. Oh, this seems right. Prior notice is the initial step where relevant parties are informed, and then a prior evidentiary hearing where they can present their case.

Option D: Prior notice and immediate termination. Hmm, not sure. Immediate termination might not be the usual process. It's more about waiting until the court decides.

Option E: Immediate termination without notice. That doesn't fit because if you don't know who's entitled, you can't proceed.

Option F: Prior screening and subsequent hearing. Wait, that's a bit different because screening might be part of the initial process, but screening is usually a separate process, not the first step. The first step is notice.

Option G: Prior notice by biased fact finder. Not sure about the 'biased' part. I don't think so; the fact finder is neutral.

Option H: Prior notice and opportunity to respond. That sounds right. Prior notice is first, then the opportunity to respond.

Option I: Post-termination hearing. That's more about the actual decision, not the process leading up to it.

So the correct process would involve prior notice and then an opportunity to respond. That's option H. But wait, let me make sure. Another thought: Sometimes, the process might involve prior screening as part of the initial phase, but I don't think so. I think prior notice is the first step, then the court examines evidence, and then any response.

So the answer should be H: Prior notice and opportunity to respond.

The correct answer is H: Prior notice and opportunity to respond.
