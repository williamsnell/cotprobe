Okay, so I have this problem where I need to use Green's Theorem to evaluate the line integral ∮_C y³ dx + x³ dy, where C is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, and the orientation is positive, meaning it's counterclockwise. Hmm, Green's Theorem relates a line integral around a simple closed curve C to a double integral over the region D bounded by C. The theorem states that ∮_C P dx + Q dy = ∬_D (∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y) dA. 

So here, P is y³ and Q is x³. I need to compute the partial derivatives. Let me compute ∂Q/∂x first. Since Q is x³, the derivative with respect to x is 3x². Next, ∂P/∂y. P is y³, so derivative with respect to y is 3y². 

So the integrand becomes (3x² - 3y²) dA. I can factor out the 3, so it's 3(x² - y²) dA. Now, since the region D is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, it's symmetric in all directions, but x² - y² might complicate things. Maybe I can switch to polar coordinates because that might simplify the integral. 

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, and dA = r dr dθ. So substituting, x² = r² cos²θ and y² = r² sin²θ. So, x² - y² becomes r² (cos²θ - sin²θ) = r² cos(2θ). Therefore, the integrand becomes 3 r² cos(2θ) dA, and dA is r dr dθ. So the whole thing becomes 3 ∫∫ r² cos(2θ) * r dr dθ. Let me write that as 3 ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) r³ cos(2θ) dr dθ.

Now, I can separate the integrals since the integrand is a product of a function of r and a function of θ. So it's 3 [ ∫ (0 to 2π) cos(2θ) dθ ] [ ∫ (0 to 2) r³ dr ].

Let's compute each part. First, the integral over θ:

∫ (0 to 2π) cos(2θ) dθ. The integral of cos(2θ) is (1/2) sin(2θ). Evaluating from 0 to 2π, sin(2*2π)=sin(4π)=0, and sin(0)=0. So the integral is zero. 

Wait, that's zero because the function cos(2θ) is symmetric over 0 to 2π and positive and negative parts cancel out. So the entire double integral becomes 3 * 0 * [integral over r] = 0. But wait, that can't be right because Green's theorem gives the line integral, which in this case should be non-zero. Hmm, did I make a mistake in applying Green's theorem?

Wait, let me double-check. The vector field is y³ dx + x³ dy. So P = y³, Q = x³. Then ∂Q/∂x is 3x², ∂P/∂y is 3y². So the integrand is 3x² - 3y². Then yes, that's right. So in polar coordinates, 3(x² - y²) dA, which as I did earlier. Then substituting x² = r² cos²θ, y² = r² sin²θ. So x² - y² becomes r² (cos²θ - sin²θ) = r² cos(2θ). 

So the integrand is 3 r² cos(2θ) * r dr dθ = 3 r³ cos(2θ) dθ dr. 

Wait, I think I messed up the exponents. No, in the integrand, it's 3 (x² - y²) dA, which becomes 3 r² cos(2θ) * r dr dθ? Wait, no. Wait, x² is r² cos²θ, and y² is r² sin²θ. So x² - y² is r² (cos²θ - sin²θ) = r² cos(2θ). So the integrand is 3 (x² - y²) dA = 3 r² cos(2θ) * (r dr dθ). Because dA is r dr dθ. So that's 3 r² * cos(2θ) * r dr dθ = 3 r³ cos(2θ) dr dθ. 

Right, so the integral is 3 ∫ (0 to 2π) cos(2θ) dθ ∫ (0 to 2) r³ dr. The first integral is zero, so the whole thing is zero. But wait, that's strange because the line integral should be non-zero for a closed path around the origin. Wait, but maybe the symmetry here leads to the integral being zero. Let me think again.

Wait, the vector field is y³ dx + x³ dy. So let's think about the vector field components. If I have a closed curve, and the vector field has components that are odd functions in each variable, perhaps the line integral is zero due to symmetry. Let me consider a small perturbation. For example, suppose the vector field is symmetric in x and y in a way that the line integral around a circle cancels out. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something with the application of Green's theorem. Let me think again: I applied Green's correctly. So according to Green's, the line integral is equal to the double integral of 3(x² - y²) over the area. But if that integral is zero, then the line integral is zero.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should compute the line integral directly as another method to verify. Let me try parametrizing the circle. The circle is x² + y² = 4, radius 2. So parametrizing with θ from 0 to 2π: x = 2 cosθ, y = 2 sinθ. Then dx = -2 sinθ dθ, dy = 2 cosθ dθ.

Substituting into the line integral:

∮_C y³ dx + x³ dy = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [ (2 sinθ)^3 (-2 sinθ dθ) + (2 cosθ)^3 (2 cosθ dθ) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (8 sin³θ) * (-2 sinθ dθ) = -16 sin⁴θ dθ
Second term: (8 cos³θ) * (2 cosθ dθ) = 16 cos⁴θ dθ

So the integral becomes ∫ (-16 sin⁴θ + 16 cos⁴θ) dθ from 0 to 2π.

Factor out 16: 16 ∫ (cos⁴θ - sin⁴θ) dθ.

Hmm, perhaps I can simplify cos⁴θ - sin⁴θ. That’s a difference of squares: (cos²θ)^2 - (sin²θ)^2 = (cos²θ - sin²θ)(cos²θ + sin²θ) = cos(2θ) * 1 = cos(2θ). So the integral becomes 16 ∫ cos(2θ) dθ from 0 to 2π.

The integral of cos(2θ) over 0 to 2π is [ (1/2) sin(2θ) ] evaluated from 0 to 2π. sin(4π) = 0 and sin(0) = 0, so the integral is zero. Therefore, the line integral is 16 * 0 = 0. So that confirms what I got using Green's theorem. So the answer should be zero.

Wait, but the options include option F: 0. But wait, the options are labeled A to J, and the choices are given as:

A: 55.32
B: -32.214
C: -75.396
D: -64.428
E: 25.132
F: 0
G: 100.123
H: 80.456
I: 150.789
J: 40.284

So the correct answer is F: 0. But wait, let me check again if I made any mistake in the line integral approach. Because I remember that for a vector field to have a non-zero circulation around a closed curve, it's necessary that the field is not irrotational. But in this case, the integral is zero, which suggests that the field is irrotational, so the circulation is zero. That aligns with my Green's theorem result.

So the correct answer is F: 0.

To evaluate the line integral ∮_C y³ dx + x³ dy using Green's Theorem, we first compute the integrand as ∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y = 3x² - 3y². Converting to polar coordinates, we have x² - y² = r² cos(2θ), so the integrand becomes 3r² cos(2θ). The double integral over the circle of radius 2 is evaluated, and due to the symmetry of the integrand, the integral over θ from 0 to 2π results in zero. Thus, the line integral evaluates to zero.

Answer: F: 0
