Okay, so I've got this question about time series models, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about the process for y_t defined as y_t = μ + λ t + u_t. I need to choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, first, I remember that in time series analysis, stationarity and trends are important concepts. Let me think about each part of the equation. The equation has three components: a constant μ, a term with time t, and an error term u_t.

The μ is a constant, like the intercept. Then λ t is a linear time trend, meaning it increases by λ each period. The u_t is the error term, which I think is assumed to be white noise. So, without any additional structure, y_t seems to have a deterministic component that's increasing over time, and a random error.

Wait, what's the difference between a deterministic and stochastic trend? Oh right, a deterministic trend is a non-random, predictable component, while a stochastic trend would have some randomness, like a unit root. But in this case, t is just linear, so it's a deterministic trend. So the process has a trend that's increasing, but it's not random.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Non-stationary without trend. Hmm, but it's got a trend. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Random walk with drift. Wait, a random walk without a drift is when y_t = u_t + u_{t-1}, which might not fit. But with a drift, it's y_t = mu + lambda*t + u_t. Wait, but in this case, the process includes a drift term because the drift would be λ, and the process is a random walk with drift. So B might be correct.

Option C: Stationary. No, because if you add a linear time trend, the process isn't stationary anymore. Stationary processes have constant variance and mean, but with a trend, the mean is changing over time. So C is wrong.

Option D: Mean-reverting. No, mean-reverting would imply that the process tends to return to a certain level over time, which isn't the case here. The trend is increasing, so the process isn't mean-reverting. So D is out.

Option E: Stationary with trend. Wait, no. Stationary would require constant variance and mean, but here the mean is increasing linearly. So E is incorrect because the process isn't stationary. Also, the presence of a trend doesn't make it stationary; it's the opposite. So E is wrong.

Option F: Deterministic trend process. Yes, this seems right. The process has a deterministic trend because it includes a term that changes with time, specifically λt. So F is a possible answer.

Option G: Random walk without drift. A random walk without drift would have the form y_t = u_t + u_{t-1}, which isn't the case here. Also, the presence of the t term makes it a random walk with drift, not without. So G might not be correct.

Option H: White noise. No, because the equation includes terms that are not just random fluctuations. So H is wrong.

Option I: Unit root process. Wait, a unit root implies a non-stationary process, but here the process is not stationary because of the trend. So I think I is incorrect.

Option J: Deterministic without trend. No, because y_t includes a trend term. So J is wrong.

So looking back, the correct description is that the process has a deterministic trend, so the correct option is F. Alternatively, wait, option E said stationary with trend. But that's not correct. So F is the correct one.

The process for \( y_t \) is given by \( y_t = \mu + \lambda t + u_t \), where \( \mu \) is a constant, \( \lambda t \) is a deterministic trend component, and \( u_t \) is an error term. This indicates that \( y_t \) has a deterministic trend, meaning it increases linearly over time. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect, as the process is not stationary and includes a trend.
- **B**: Correct, as it describes a random walk with drift, which fits the model.
- **C**: Incorrect, as the presence of a trend makes the process non-stationary.
- **D**: Incorrect, as mean-reverting processes do not have a time-increasing trend.
- **E**: Incorrect, as the process includes a trend, not just stationarity.
- **F**: Correct, as it describes a deterministic trend process.
- **G**: Incorrect, as it includes a drift term, making it a random walk with drift.
- **H**: Incorrect, as it is not white noise but includes a trend component.
- **I**: Incorrect, as the process is not a unit root process.
- **J**: Incorrect, as there is a trend component.

The correct description is that the process is a deterministic trend process.
