Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum efficiency question. Let's see what I remember. Hmm, quantum efficiency is the ratio of the number of photons detected to the number of photons sent into the detector. Oh wait, right, quantum efficiency (η) is given by η = detected photons / total photons. 

The question says the quantum efficiency is 0.1. Oh wait, wait. Wait, 0.1 is 10%? Or is it 10 times per photon? Wait, no, I think quantum efficiency is the reciprocal. Because if the efficiency is η, then η is detected photons divided by total. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing things. Let me think again. 

Wait, no, quantum efficiency is typically the probability that a photon is detected. Oh yes, so for each photon, there's a 0.1 chance of being detected. So if you send N photons, the average detected is N * η.

In this case, N is 100. So 100 * 0.1 = 10. So the average is 10. Right, so all options that say 10 on average are probably correct.

But wait, the question is about the "rms deviation" as well. Hmm, what's the rms deviation here? Oh right, the rms deviation is the standard deviation. So for a binomial distribution, the variance is N * η * (1-η), so the standard deviation (rms) would be sqrt(N η (1-η)).

Let's calculate that. N is 100, η is 0.1, so 1-η is 0.9. So variance is 100 * 0.1 * 0.9 = 9. So the standard deviation is sqrt(9) = 3. So the rms deviation is 3.

So the options with average 10 and rms 3 are correct. Let me look at the options. Option B is average 10, rms about 3. Option F is 5 average, which doesn't match. So the correct answer must be option B or F. Wait, F has 5 average, which would be 50% efficiency, but the given η is 0.1. So option B is correct.

Wait, what about the options: 

A: 10 average, rms 5. No, our calculation says rms is 3.

B: 10 average, rms 3. Yes.

C: 10, rms 0.1. That doesn't make sense. That can't be right.

D: 10, rms 1. Also no.

E: 10, rms 6. No.

F: average 5, which would be if η was 0.5, but η is 0.1, so no.

G: 20 average. No, because 100 * 0.1 is 10.

H: 10 average, rms 4. No, our calculation was 3.

I: 15 average. No.

J: 10 average, rms 2. No.

So only option B is correct. So the answer is option B.

The quantum efficiency (η) is given as 0.1, meaning that 10% of the photons sent into the detector are detected. For 100 photons, the average number of photons detected is:

\[
\text{Average} = N \cdot \eta = 100 \cdot 0.1 = 10
\]

To calculate the rms (root mean square) deviation, which is the standard deviation for a binomial distribution, the formula is:

\[
\text{Variance} = N \cdot \eta \cdot (1 - \eta) = 100 \cdot 0.1 \cdot 0.9 = 9
\]
\[
\text{Rms deviation} = \sqrt{\text{Variance}} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

Thus, the average number of detected photons is 10, and the rms deviation is 3. Among the options, only **Option B** (average of 10 times, rms deviation of about 3) matches these values.
