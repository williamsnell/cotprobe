Alright, so I've got this problem here about Steven Moore buying a car and figuring out his monthly payments. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. 

Okay, the car costs $3,462.20, and he's paying it off in 35 months. I remember there's a formula for calculating monthly payments on a loan. Oh right, it's the present value of an annuity formula. The formula is:

PMT = PV * [i (1 + i)^n] / [(1 + i)^n - 1]

Where:
- PMT is the monthly payment.
- PV is the present value, which is the price of the car.
- i is the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12).
- n is the number of payments (months).

Wait, but wait, the problem doesn't specify the interest rate. Oh, that's a problem. Without the interest rate, I can't calculate the exact monthly payment. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Did I read the question correctly? Let me check again.

The question says he "wishes to pay for it in 35 months. Find his monthly payments." Oh, but no interest rate is given. Maybe I'm supposed to assume it's a simple interest or some standard rate? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh wait, perhaps the original problem had an implied interest rate, but it's not here. That could be a problem. 

Wait, perhaps the question is incomplete or missing information. Without knowing the interest rate, it's impossible to compute the exact monthly payment. So maybe the correct answer isn't there, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the interest rate is given elsewhere. But since the options are provided, maybe the interest rate is standard. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, like rounding or approximating.

Wait, another thought: sometimes when calculating car payments, people use the simple interest formula, PV = PMT * n + (PMT * n * r) / 2. But perhaps that's not accurate.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting to know that 35 months is about 2 years and 11 months. But without the interest rate, how can I proceed?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes a zero interest rate, but that would make the payment equal to the principal, which isn't an option. So that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use an average interest rate, like 12% annual, so 1% monthly. Let's see. Let's try that.

So, using the formula with i = 1% (0.01) and n =35.

PV = 3462.20

M = 3462.20 * [0.01 (1+0.01)^35 ) / ( (1+0.01)^35 -1 ) ]

Calculating (1.01)^35: Let's approximate. 1.01^35 is about 1.4116?

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 

Using the rule of 72, which says double the time to double the amount at a given rate. But 1% is low, so perhaps it's better to calculate it step by step or use a calculator. Alternatively, I can approximate.

Wait, 1% interest for 35 months. Alternatively, perhaps using the rule of 78 for interest calculation, but that's usually for loans where interest is paid in installments, and at the end of the loan term. But maybe that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula with a certain interest rate, but since it's not given, maybe the intended method is different. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting an approximate calculation, using a simple interest approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think that maybe the question is incomplete, but given the options, let me try to compute possible answers using different interest rates to see which option makes sense.

Let's try different i values.

Option A: 100.20

If PMT is 100.20, then 100.20 *35 = 3507. So 3507 is more than 3462.20, which would mean that the total would be higher than the car's price, implying a negative interest rate, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be right. So Option A is too low.

Option B: 102.55

102.55 *35 = 3590.25. Again, that's higher than 3462.20, so same issue.

Option C: 110.35

110.35 *35 = 3862.25 → way too high.

Option D: 95.46 → 95.46*35 = 3341.10 → less than 3462.20. So that's too low. But wait, if PMT is 95.46, the total would be 3341.10, so the difference is 3462.20 – 3341.10 = 121.10. So the total interest would be that, but maybe the monthly calculation would have more.

Option E: 98.92 → 98.92 *35 = 3462.20 → wait, exactly the present value. That would mean that the monthly payment plus interest would exactly equal the car price, which is only possible if the interest rate is such that the present value is equal. So in that case, the monthly payment would be equal to the interest rate multiplied by the present value. Hmm, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the formula is PMT = PV * [i (1+i)^n ] / [ (1+i)^n –1 ]

So if PMT is 98.92, then:

98.92 = 3462.20 * [i*(1+i)^35 ] / [ (1+i)^35 – 1 ]

But if 98.92 *35 = 3462.20 → 3462.20 = 98.92 *35 → 3462.20 = 3462.20 → so that's correct. Which would only happen if the interest rate is such that (1+i)^35 –1 = i*(1+i)^35 → which seems unlikely unless i is zero. But that's not possible. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to use the simple interest formula. The simple interest formula is:

Total Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Total Amount = Principal + Interest.

But since we're dealing with monthly payments, perhaps the interest is calculated monthly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the simple interest over the period, but that doesn't make sense for monthly payments.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated as (PMT * n) where PMT is the monthly payment, but that's not how amortized loans work. Each payment includes both principal and interest, with the portion decreasing each month.

Wait, but perhaps the question is expecting the use of the simple interest formula: I = P * R * T, where I is the total interest, P is principal, R is annual rate, T is time in years.

Wait, but without the rate, I can't calculate that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the correct answer is E) 98.92 because 35 * 98.92 = 3462.20 exactly. But wait, that would imply that the present value of the payments equals the car's price, which seems correct only if the interest rate is such that the present value is equal. But in that case, the monthly payment would be equal to the interest rate, but that's not the case here. So perhaps that's not the correct approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have a 0% interest rate, but that would mean the monthly payment is 3462.20 /35, which is about 98.92. So that would make option E correct. But I'm not sure if the problem implies a 0% interest rate. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the intended approach is to use the simple interest formula, assuming 0% interest. So then the monthly payment would be 3462.20 /35 = 98.92, which is option E. That might be the intended solution. But I'm not confident because the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, if the problem expects a more accurate calculation using the amortization formula, which I can't compute without the interest rate, then perhaps the answer would be different. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have the monthly payment be the same as the simple interest, which is 98.92. But I'm not sure. Without more information, I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I'll proceed under the assumption that the problem is implying a 0% interest rate, and thus the monthly payment is 3462.20 /35 = approximately 98.92.
</think>

The problem requires calculating the monthly payment for a car loan, but the monthly interest rate is unknown. Without the interest rate, it's impossible to determine the exact payment. However, assuming a 0% interest rate, the monthly payment would be the total price divided by the number of months, which is 3462.20 / 35 ≈ 98.92.
