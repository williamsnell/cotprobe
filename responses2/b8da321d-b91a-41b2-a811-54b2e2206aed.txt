Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about an astronaut's weight on a different planet. Hmm.

The problem states: An astronaut lands on a planet whose mass and radius are each twice that of Earth. If the astronaut weighs 800 N on Earth, how much will he weigh on this planet? The options are from A to J, with J being 800 N again.

Alright, so I remember that weight isn't just about mass; it depends on the gravitational force, which is determined by the planet's mass and the radius. Oh wait, right! The formula for gravitational force is F = G*(M*m)/(r²), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass, m is the astronaut's mass, and r is the radius. But for comparison, since Earth's gravity is a reference point, maybe I can use the ratio approach.

Wait, another formula I remember for weight on another planet: the weight on a planet is (g_planet) * m, where g_planet is the gravitational acceleration on that planet. And g is calculated as G*M/(r²). So if the planet's mass is twice Earth's and the radius is twice Earth's, then the gravitational acceleration would be (2M) / (2r)^2. Let's compute that.

Wait, let's think in terms of Earth's g. So Earth's g is G*M_earth / r_earth². The new planet has M = 2M_earth and r = 2r_earth. So substituting, g_new = (G*(2M_earth)) / ( (2r_earth)^2 ). Let's compute the denominator: (2r_earth)^2 is 4r_earth². So g_new = (2GM_earth) / (4r_earth²) ) = (2/4) * (GM_earth / r_earth²) ) = (1/2) * g_earth. Oh, so the new planet's gravity is half that of Earth's.

So if the astronaut weighs 800 N on Earth, on this planet, his weight would be (g_new / g_earth) * his Earth weight. So that's (1/2)*800 N = 400 N. So the astronaut would weigh 400 N on this planet.

Looking at the options, F is 400 N. So the answer should be F.

To determine the astronaut's weight on the new planet, we analyze the gravitational force, which depends on the planet's mass and radius. The astronaut's weight on Earth is 800 N. The new planet has twice the mass and twice the radius of Earth, so the gravitational acceleration on the new planet is half that of Earth's. Thus, the astronaut's weight on the new planet is half of 800 N, which is **400 N**. This corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
