Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Nixon's departure. The question is asking, "Before Nixon resigned, how many believed he should be removed from office?" The options are A through J, each with a percentage.

Hmm, I remember that when someone resigns, the public reaction varies. Nixon was a significant figure, so people probably had varying opinions. I think there were different percentages of people supporting his resignation compared to their views on his policies.

I recall that about 44% of people believe Nixon should be removed. Wait, let me think again. Oh right, I think the general public split pretty evenly. But I'm not entirely sure. Oh, right, I think the majority believed in removing him, but some were against it. Alternatively, maybe the number was around 50%. 

Wait, another angle: Nixon's resignation was a big event. He was a former president, so his legacy is well-known. People might have felt that his policies were outdated or that he wasn't making the right decisions then. So the majority might have been against removing him, but I'm not sure about the exact percentage.

Looking at the options, option D is 44%, which is a bit less than half. Alternatively, I've heard that the majority of people didn't support his resignation. Oh, wait, but waitâ€”some people might support it. Let me think of past surveys. I think a 44% figure is more likely. Also, I remember that about 33% might have supported it, but I'm not certain.

Another approach: I think the majority of people, perhaps 50%, didn't support his resignation. But some 44% might have. Let me try to recall. Oh, I think I remember that the majority of people in the public opinion were against his resignation. So the percentage supporting it would be lower. But wait, some people do support it. Maybe around 44% did.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think about the actual numbers. I think the correct answer is 44%, which is option D. Because several surveys and studies have indicated that about 44% of the public believed Nixon should be removed. So the correct answer would be D:44%.
