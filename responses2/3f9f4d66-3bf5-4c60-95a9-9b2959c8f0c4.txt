Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of wave motion. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that a source particle is executing periodic motion given by y = 6 sin(pi * t/3), but wait, no—let me check the question again. Oh, wait, the equation is y = 6 sin(pi t / 3), but I think I might have misread something. Oh wait, no, looking again: the equation is y =6 sin(π t/3), but the source is moving out waves at 6 cm/s. 

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the function y = 6 sin(π t /3) is an equation for displacement over time, but the function is given as a wave equation. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh wait, no, the problem states that the source particle is executing periodic motion, which is perhaps the same as the wave equation. Or maybe it's a standing wave or something else. Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the given data.

Wait, the source particle is vibrating, and the waves it emits travel through a medium at 6 cm/s. The question is about the displacement of a second particle 80 cm from the source after one minute. 

So, let's get the key points:

1. The source particle is vibrating, and its motion is described by y = 6 sin(π t / 3). Wait, that seems odd because the units might not match. Let me think—if it's a displacement, the formula should have units of cm. So perhaps that's the equation for the particle's position over time, but let me not get stuck on that yet.

Wait, but the source emits waves at 6 cm/s. So the wave speed is 6 cm/s. Hmm, that might help me find the wavelength or something else.

The question is about the displacement of a second particle 80 cm from the source after one minute (which is 60 seconds).

So, the setup: there's a source particle that's moving, emitting waves. The wave speed is 6 cm/s. A second particle is 80 cm away from the source. We need to find its displacement at t=60 s.

Wait, but the source particle's motion is periodic. So, perhaps the source is moving in some way (like oscillating), and the waves it emits are traveling through the medium. The wave speed is given, but what about the source's motion?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about what each part of the problem says.

The source particle's motion is given by y = 6 sin(π t / 3). Wait, that's the equation for displacement over time. So, in a typical vibration, the displacement y as a function of time.

But the source is vibrating, and it's the same as the wave? Or perhaps the source's motion is the same as the wave. Hmm, if the wave is moving at 6 cm/s, then the wave's speed is 6 cm/s. So the wave equation would be something like y = y0 sin(kx - ωt), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the source is oscillating, and the waves it emits have a certain wave equation. Let me think: The wave speed is 6 cm/s. So for a wave on a string, the wave speed v is given by v = f λ, where f is frequency and λ is wavelength. Alternatively, in terms of wave equation, v = (ω/k), where ω is angular frequency and k is the wave number.

But I'm not sure how that connects to the source's motion. Wait, the problem says the source is vibrating, and the waves it emits travel at 6 cm/s. So perhaps the source's vibration is the same as the wave's motion. Or maybe the source's motion is a function of time, like y = 6 sin(π t / 3), and the wave is moving with speed 6 cm/s.

Wait, perhaps the source's displacement is the same as the wave's displacement. But that doesn't make much sense because a source is emitting waves, not moving. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the source is moving because of some oscillation, like a particle attached to a spring, and this oscillation is what's causing the wave to propagate. So the source's motion is periodic, and the waves it produces have a certain speed.

Wait, the problem says the waves travel at 6 cm/s. So the wave speed is 6 cm/s. That's important. So, for a wave on a string, the speed v is related to the tension and the linear mass density, but I don't think that's needed here. Since we know v, perhaps we can find the wavelength or something else.

But the question is about the displacement of a particle 80 cm away from the source after one minute. So, the particle is 80 cm from the source, and the wave speed is 6 cm/s. So, the time it takes for the wave to reach that particle is the distance divided by the speed. So, time = 80 cm / 6 cm/s = (let me calculate that) 80 divided by 6 is about 13.333 seconds. So that's the time when the wave from the source reaches the particle 80 cm away.

Wait, but the problem states that the source began to vibrate after one minute, which is 60 seconds. So, the wave will reach this second particle at t = 13.333 s. But the total time is 60 s. So, the wave takes 13.333 s to reach the 80 cm particle.

But the question is about the displacement of that second particle at the time it's 80 cm away. So that is at t=13.333 s.

Wait, but what is the displacement of that particle at that time? Because the particle is oscillating, the displacement depends on its motion.

Wait, but wait a second. The source's motion is given by y = 6 sin(π t / 3). So, that's the displacement of the source particle over time. But the waves are traveling from the source, so the motion of the source affects the shape of the wave, but perhaps the particles in the medium oscillate with the same frequency as the source.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concepts. Let me think again. The source is vibrating, which creates a wave. So, the vibration of the source is the same as the wave.

Wait, but the problem says the source's motion is given by y = 6 sin(π t / 3). So that's the displacement of the source particle as a function of time. So, the source is moving, causing the wave to be emitted. But the wave itself is moving through the medium, so the particles in the medium will oscillate with the same frequency as the source.

Wait, but if the source is moving, then the wave's phase will change. Hmm, perhaps I should model this with the wave equation. Or maybe the source's displacement is a function of time, and the wave is generated with that motion.

Alternatively, perhaps the source's motion is the same as the wave's motion. So, the displacement of the source particle is the same as the displacement of the wave at that point in time.

Wait, perhaps the wave emitted by the source has a certain equation, and the source's motion (its displacement over time) is y = 6 sin(π t / 3). But I'm not sure how that ties into the wave's equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the source is moving because of some oscillation, like a pendulum, which is causing the wave to propagate. So the source is moving, and the wave is emitted. The displacement of the source is y = 6 sin(π t/3), so the source's position at time t is y(t) = 6 sin(π t /3). But I'm not sure how that affects the displacement of a particle 80 cm away.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem is more straightforward. Let's try to think about it step by step.

The wave speed is 6 cm/s. The particle is 80 cm away from the source. So, the time it takes for the wave to reach this particle is 80 cm divided by 6 cm/s. Let me compute that: 80 /6 = about 13.333 seconds. So, the wave from the source takes 13.333 seconds to reach that point. Therefore, at t=13.333 s, the wave has reached that particle, which means that the particle's displacement is due to the wave.

But what is the displacement of the particle at that time? The displacement depends on the wave equation. But I don't have the full wave equation. However, in this problem, I think the key is that the particle's displacement is the same as the source's displacement at that time, because the source is moving and the wave is generated in such a way that the particle's displacement is the same as the source's.

Wait, that makes sense because the source is moving, and the wave is created by the source's motion. So, the displacement of the particle 80 cm away is equal to the displacement of the source at that same time, as the wave is generated by the source's motion.

So, the displacement of the source at time t =13.333 s is y =6 sin(π t /3). Let me compute that.

t =13.333 seconds, so t/3=4.444. Multiply by π: 4.444 * π ≈ 13.96 cm. Wait, wait no: sin(π t/3) at t=13.333.

t is 40/3 seconds, because 13.333 is approximately 40/3 (since 3*40=120, 40/3=13.333).

So, t=40/3.

So, π t/3 = π*(40/3)/3 = π *40/(9) ≈ (approx) 4.1888 radians.

Wait, sin(4.1888) is sin(pi + 0.1888) because 4.1888 is pi*1.333 (since pi is about 3.1416). So 4.1888 is pi*1.333, which is 2pi/3, because pi*2/3 is about 2.0944, wait no. Wait, pi is about 3.1416. 3.1416 * 1.333 is approximately 4.1888 (since 3.1416 * 4/3 is 4.1888). So, sin(4.1888) = sin(4pi/3) because 4pi/3 is 240 degrees, whose sin is -√3/2.

Wait, wait, let me compute 4.1888 radians: 4.1888 is approximately 240 degrees. Because pi radians is 180 degrees. So 1 radian is about 57.3 degrees. So 4 radians is about 229.2 degrees, and 4.1888 is about 240 degrees. So, yes, 4.1888 radians is 240 degrees. The sine of 240 degrees is -√3/2.

So, sin(4.1888) is -√3/2.

So, the displacement of the source at t=40/3 s is 6 * (-√3/2) = -6*(0.8660) ) ≈ -5.196 cm.

Wait, but wait. The source's displacement is the same as the wave's displacement at that point. So, the particle at 80 cm is displaced by the same value. Therefore, the displacement is approximately -5.2 cm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 5.2 cm. But the options are A:13.3, B:9, C:80, D:5.2, E:10.6, F:4.8, G:6, H:7.5, I:3, J:0.

Wait, so the displacement is -5.2 cm, but the options don't have a negative. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 4.1888 radians is 240 degrees, and sin(240 degrees) is -√3/2. So 6 * (-√3/2) is -3√3. Because 6*(√3/2) is 3√3. So, 3√3 is approximately 5.196 cm. But with the negative sign, it's -5.196 cm.

So, the displacement is about -5.2 cm. But looking at the options, the closest is option D:5.2 cm. However, displacement is a vector quantity, so the negative sign indicates direction, but the magnitude is 5.2 cm.

Wait but the question says, "Find the displacement of a second particle 80 cm from the source one minute after the source began to vibrate." So, "after the source began to vibrate"—so the time is 60 seconds, but the wave takes 13.333 seconds to reach the 80 cm particle. So, the wave hasn't reached yet. Hmm, wait, that's a problem.

Wait, this is confusing. Because the particle is at 80 cm, which is beyond the time it takes for the wave to reach it. So, the wave hasn't reached that particle yet. Or wait, no, because 80 cm is the distance. Let me clarify:

Time taken for wave to reach 80 cm particle: 80 cm / 6 cm/s = 13.333 s. So, at 13.333 s, the wave has reached that particle. But the question says, "one minute after the source began to vibrate." So, 60 s after. So, the wave hasn't reached the particle yet, because it arrives at 13.33 s.

Wait, this is a problem. So, how can the wave have reached the particle in 13.33 s when it was supposed to be 80 cm away? Because 60 s is more than 13.33 s. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the wave speed is 6 cm/s. Or maybe the wave speed is not 6 cm/s. Let me recheck the problem.

Wait, the problem says: "the source particle is executing a periodic motion defined by y = 6 sin(pi t/3), and the waves travel through a medium at the rate of 6 cm per second."

So, the wave speed is 6 cm/s. That's correct. So, the wave equation must have a speed v =6 cm/s. So, for a wave, the wave number k is 2pi / lambda, and the angular frequency omega is 2pi f, and v=omega/k.

But I don't think that affects this problem directly. Let me get back.

So, the particle at 80 cm is 80 cm away. The wave speed is 6 cm/s, so the time it takes for the wave to reach that particle is 80 /6 ≈13.333 s. So, at 13.333 s, the wave arrives at that point.

But the question is about the displacement of the particle at t=60 s (one minute). So, the wave has not yet reached the particle at 80 cm, because 13.333 s <60 s.

Wait, that's a problem because if the wave hasn't reached the particle, then the displacement is zero? But that can't be, because the particle is moving.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me think: the source particle is moving, and the wave is emitted. So, the displacement of the source is y =6 sin(π t/3). So, that's the displacement of the source particle. But the wave emitted by the source will have a certain amplitude, which might influence the particle's displacement.

Wait, perhaps the displacement of the particle is the same as the source's displacement at time t, because the wave is generated by the source's motion. So, the particle's displacement at time t is y=6 sin(π t/3). So, at t=60 s, the displacement is y=6 sin(π*60/3) = 6 sin(20pi).

Wait, sin(20pi) is zero because 20pi is an integer multiple of pi, sin(20pi) = 0. So, the displacement would be zero, which is option J.

But that can't be right because the wave hasn't reached the particle yet. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The wave is emitted from the source, so the displacement of a particle at distance 80 cm is influenced by the wave's phase at that time. But the wave's phase at the source's position (t=0) is zero, because y=6 sin(0) =0. As time increases, the wave propagates, and the phase increases.

Wait, but the source is moving, so the wave's phase doesn't just depend on the time but also on the source's motion. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the wave being emitted from the source, but about the particle moving. No, the problem says the source is emitting waves.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the wave's amplitude is 6 cm, and the source's motion is the same as the wave—so, the source's position at time t is y =6 sin(π t /3). So, the source's displacement is 6 sin(π t /3). But the wave's displacement is a function of distance and time.

Wait, perhaps the displacement of the particle at 80 cm is the same as the source's displacement at the same time, because the wave is generated by the source's motion. So, the particle's displacement is y =6 sin(π t /3). But at t=60 s, that would be 6 sin(20 pi) = 0, so displacement is zero. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. The wave takes 80/(6) = 40/3 ≈13.333 s to reach the particle. So, at t=60 s, the wave hasn't reached the particle. So, the particle's displacement is zero, but that's not the case.

Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not correctly modeling the problem. Let me think again.

The source particle is executing periodic motion defined by y =6 sin(π t/3). So, this is the position of the source over time. The wave is moving at 6 cm/s. So, the wave equation would be y = y0 sin( (omega/k) x - ω t ), but perhaps it's more complicated.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the wave equation is y = y0 sin(kx - ω t), but the source's motion is ysource = y0 sin(omega t). So, the wave is generated by the source's motion. So, the displacement of the particle at x=80 cm is the same as the source's displacement at the same time.

So, the displacement of the particle is y =6 sin(π t /3) at any time t.

But at t=60 s, this would be y =6 sin(20 pi) =6 *0=0. So, the displacement would be zero. But that's not an option except for J.

But wait, that can't be right because a particle 80 cm away from the source would have a displacement based on the wave's propagation. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the wave's displacement is given by some function, and the source's motion affects the phase.

Wait, perhaps the wave's equation is y = y0 sin(kx - ω t + phi), where phi is a phase shift. But if the source is moving, then phi can be a function of time.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me try to find another approach.

The problem says that the source's motion is given by y =6 sin(π t/3), and that waves are moving at 6 cm/s. The second particle is 80 cm away, so the wave takes 80/6=13.333 s to reach it. So, the wave is emitted at t=0, and arrives at the 80 cm particle at t=13.333 s.

But the question is about the displacement of the particle at t=60 s (one minute). So, the wave hasn't reached the particle yet. So, the particle is at rest, but that's not the case because the wave is propagating.

Wait, no. The wave is propagating, so the particle is moving, but the wave is moving through it. So, the displacement of the particle is due to the wave's phase.

Wait, perhaps the wave is moving, and the particle is a point in the medium. So, the displacement of the particle is determined by the wave's equation.

Wait, but the source's motion is the same as the wave, so the particle's displacement is the same as the source's displacement at that time.

So, at t=60 s, the source's displacement is y=6 sin(π *60 /3) =6 sin(20 pi)=0. So, displacement is zero. So, the answer would be J:0 cm.

But wait, that doesn't seem to align with the wave's movement because the wave hasn't reached the particle yet. So, why is the displacement zero?

Ah, perhaps because the wave's phase hasn't affected the particle's position beyond the source's motion.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of another approach. The problem says that the source is moving, and the wave is emitted in such a way that the particle's displacement is the same as the source's displacement.

So, the displacement of the particle is y=6 sin(π t/3). So, at t=60 s, y=0. So, the answer is J.

Wait, but that can't be right because the wave didn't reach the particle yet, but the displacement is determined by the source's motion. So, perhaps the wave's displacement at the source's position is zero, which affects the particle's displacement. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the wave equation is y = y_max sin(kx - ωt). So, in this case, y_max would be the amplitude, which could be 6 cm. So, y =6 sin(kx - ωt). But the source's motion affects the phase, so ysource = y0 sin(kx - ωt + delta), where delta is the phase shift due to the source's motion.

But perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to think differently.

The problem gives the wave speed as 6 cm/s. The source emits waves, and the particle 80 cm away is moving due to the wave.

Wait, the wave equation is y = y_max sin(kx - ωt). The source is moving, so the wave's phase is shifted. So, the displacement of the source is ysource = y_max sin(ωt), because the source's position is at x=0.

Wait, no, because the wave is emitted from the source, so the source's motion affects the wave's phase.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave equation is y = y_max sin(kx - ωt + φ), where φ is a function of time due to the source's motion.

So, the displacement of the source is ysource = y_max sin(ωt + φ). But the problem states that the source's motion is y =6 sin(π t/3). So, perhaps φ is zero, and the source's displacement is ysource =6 sin(π t/3).

Wait, that's confusing. Let me try to model the wave properly.

The wave equation is y = y_max sin(kx - ωt + φ), where φ is the initial phase. The source is moving, so the wave's phase is shifted.

The displacement of the source is ysource = y_max sin(ωt + φ). So, the source's position is influenced by the wave's phase.

So, the source's displacement is ysource = y_max sin(ωt + φ). The wave's amplitude is y_max, which is 6 cm. So, ysource =6 sin(ωt + φ).

But the problem states that the source's motion is y =6 sin(π t/3). So, that's ysource =6 sin(π t/3). So, perhaps φ is zero, and the phase shift is zero because the source is moving in the direction of the wave.

Wait, but then the wave equation would be y =6 sin(ωt + kx), because the source is moving in the direction of the wave.

Wait, perhaps I should express the wave equation with the source's motion.

The wave equation is y = y_max sin(kx - ωt + φ), where φ is the initial phase. The source is moving, so the wave's phase is shifted.

The displacement of the source is ysource = y_max sin(ωt + φ).

So, combining the two, the source's displacement is ysource = y_max sin(ωt + φ) = y_max sin(π*60/3 + 0) =6 sin(20 pi)=0.

So, the source's displacement is zero, which means the particle's displacement is zero.

Wait, but that seems to contradict the wave's movement because the wave hasn't reached the particle yet. But according to this model, the source is moving, and the wave is moving in such a way that the source's displacement is zero, leading to the particle's displacement being zero.

But that can't be right because the wave is propagating, and the particle should be moving in response to the wave's motion.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Let me try to think again.

The wave equation is y = y_max sin(kx - ωt + φ). The source is moving, so the wave's phase is φ. The source's displacement is ysource = y_max sin(ωt + φ).

So, the source's displacement is ysource =6 sin(20 pi) =0.

Hmm, that's confusing. So, the particle's displacement is zero, which is option J.

But that can't be correct because a wave propagates through a medium, and the particles in the medium are displaced in response to the wave's motion. So, perhaps the model is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the wave equation should be y = y_max sin(kx - ωt), and the source's motion is ysource = y_max sin(ωt + φ). So, the displacement of the source is ysource =6 sin(20 pi + phi). But if the phase is zero, then it's 0.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to summarize:

1. The wave speed is 6 cm/s.

2. The source's motion is given by y =6 sin(π t/3).

3. The particle at 80 cm is 80 cm away from the source.

4. The wave takes 80/6 ≈13.333 s to reach the 80 cm particle.

5. The source's displacement at t=60 s is y=6 sin(20 pi)=0.

6. So, the particle's displacement is zero.

Thus, the answer is J:0 cm.

But wait, that seems to conflict with the wave's movement because the wave hasn't reached the particle yet. So, why is the displacement zero?

Ah, perhaps because the wave's phase shift is zero, and the source's displacement is zero because it's moving in the same direction as the wave, which causes the displacement to cancel out.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is correct, and the displacement of the particle is zero.

But I'm not confident. Let me think of another approach.

The wave equation is y = y_max sin(kx - ωt). The source is moving, so the displacement of the source is ysource = y_max sin(ωt + phi). So, the source's displacement is ysource =6 sin(20 pi + phi). If phi is zero, then ysource=0.

So, the particle's displacement is zero. Therefore, the answer is J:0 cm.
</think>

The problem involves a source particle executing periodic motion and emitting waves traveling at 6 cm/s. A particle 80 cm away is 80/6 ≈13.333 s away from the source. The source's motion is given by \( y = 6 \sin(\pi t / 3) \), and we need to find the displacement of the 80 cm particle at \( t = 60 \) s.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Wave Speed and Travel Time**:  
   The wave travels at 6 cm/s. The time for the wave to reach the 80 cm particle is \( t = 80 / 6 \approx 13.333 \) s. However, the question asks for the displacement at \( t = 60 \) s, which is beyond the wave's travel time.

2. **Source Displacement at \( t = 60 \) s**:  
   The source's motion is \( y = 6 \sin(\pi t / 3) \). At \( t = 60 \) s,  
   \[
   y = 6 \sin\left(\frac{\pi \cdot 60}{3}\right) = 6 \sin(20\pi) = 6 \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]  
   Thus, the source's displacement is 0 cm.

3. **Displacement of the 80 cm Particle**:  
   The wave equation is \( y = y_{\text{max}} \sin(kx - \omega t) \), where \( y_{\text{max}} = 6 \) cm. The source's motion is \( y = 6 \sin(\omega t) \), which at \( t = 60 \) s gives 0 cm. The wave's phase shift is zero, so the particle's displacement is influenced by the source's motion.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The displacement of the 80 cm particle at \( t = 60 \) s is determined by the source's motion, which is 0 cm. 

ANSWER: J
