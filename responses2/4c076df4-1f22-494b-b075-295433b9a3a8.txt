Question:

John is playing a game in which he tries to obtain the highest number possible. He must put the symbols +, $\times$, and - (plus, times, and minus) in the following blanks, using each symbol exactly once:\[2 \underline{\hphantom{8}} 4 \underline{\hphantom{8}} 6 \underline{\hphantom{8}} 8.\] John cannot use parentheses or rearrange the numbers. What is the highest possible number that John could obtain?

Options:

A: 22
B: 90
C: 100
D: 78
E: 99
F: 46
G: 56
H: 50
I: 66
J: 38

Okay, so I've got this problem where John needs to place the symbols +, ×, and − in the blanks of the expression 2 _ 4 _ 6 _ 8. Each symbol must be used exactly once. My goal is to find the highest possible number he can get.

Hmm, let me think about the possible combinations. Since he has three symbols and three blanks, each symbol appears once. So the expression will look like 2 _ 4 _ 6 _ 8. The possible orders of the symbols are the permutations of +, ×, and −.

Wait, how many permutations are there? There are 3 symbols, so 3! = 6 possible arrangements. Let me list them all:

1. + × -
2. + - ×
3. - + ×
4. - × +
5. × + -
6. × - +

I need to evaluate each of these to see which gives the highest result.

Starting with the first one: 2 + 4 × 6 - 8.

I remember that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. So 4 × 6 is 24. Then 2 + 24 is 26, and 26 - 8 is 18. That's not too high.

Second option: 2 + 4 - 6 × 8.

Wait, no, wait, the order of the symbols is +, -, ×. So it's 2 + 4 - 6 × 8. 

Wait, no, no. Wait, the expression is 2 + 4 - 6 × 8. The multiplication is between 6 and 8. So 6 ×8 is 48. Then 2 +4 is 6. So 6 -48 is -42. That's a negative number, so not good.

Third option: 2 - 4 + 6 × 8.

Again, multiplication first. 6 ×8 is 48. So 2 -4 is -2. Then -2 +48 is 46. So 46 is one possibility.

Fourth option: 2 - 4 × 6 +8.

Wait, the order is -, then ×, then +. So the multiplication is 4 ×6 which is 24. So 2 -24 is -22, then +8 is -14. That's lower than 46.

Fifth option: 2 × 4 + 6 - 8.

Multiplication first: 2×4 is 8. Then 8 +6 is 14, then 14-8 is 6. That's lower than 46.

Sixth option: 2 × 4 - 6 +8.

Multiplication first: 2×4 is 8. Then 8 -6 is 2, then +8 is 10. That's even lower.

Wait, so from all the options, the highest number I got was 46. But wait, let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Option 3: 2 -4 +6 ×8.

Wait, 6 ×8 is 48, 2 -4 is -2, so -2 +48 is 46. That's correct.

What about other possibilities? Did I miss any? Let me double-check each option.

Wait, another possibility: 2 ×4 +6 -8. That was 8+6=14, 14-8=6. No, that's lower.

Another one: 2 +4 ×6 -8 = 2+24=26, 26-8=18. No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me redo the second option correctly.

Wait, option 2: 2 +4 -6 ×8. So that's 2 +4 =6, then 6 - (6×8). Wait, no, multiplication is done before subtraction. So 6 ×8 is 48. So 6 -48 is -42. That's correct.

What about the other permutations? Did I consider them all?

Wait, another permutation is 2 -4 +6 ×8, which we've already done.

Wait, another angle: perhaps using subtraction after multiplication? Like 2 ×4 +6 -8, which I did.

Wait, maybe there's another way. Oh wait, what about 2 +4 ×6 -8, which I already did.

Wait, another thought: is there a way to get a higher number by rearranging? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the positions of the operators. Let me make a table:

Possible operator orders:

1. +, ×, - → 2 +4 ×6 -8 → 18
2. +, -, × → 2 +4 -6 ×8 → -42
3. -, +, × → 2 -4 +6 ×8 →46
4. -, ×, + → 2 -4 ×6 +8 →-14
5. ×, +, - →2×4 +6 -8 →8+6=14-8=6
6. ×, -, + →2×4 -6 +8 →8-6=2+8=10

So, the highest is 46.

Wait, but wait, the options given are A:22, B:90, C:100, D:78, E:99, F:46, G:56, H:50, I:66, J:38.

So, 46 is option F.

But wait, did I miss any other possibilities? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I can arrange the operators differently. Let me try all possibilities again.

1. +, ×, - → 2 +4 ×6 -8 → 2+24-8=18
2. +, -, × →2+4 -6 ×8 →6 -48=-42
3. -, +, × →2 -4 +6 ×8 →2-4= -2; -2+48=46
4. -, ×, + →2 -4 ×6 +8 →-24+8= -16
5. ×, +, - →2×4 +6 -8 →8+6=14-8=6
6. ×, -, + →2×4 -6 +8 →8-6=2+8=10

So, indeed, the maximum is 46.
