Question:

A company sells DVD players for $200 per unit. The players have a unit variable cost of $160. The company estimates that it will sell one home entertainment system for every four DVD players sold. Home entertainment systems have a unit variable cost of $460 and sell for $600 per unit. The company's fixed costs are $90000. Assuming that the sales mix estimate is correct how many DVD players need to be sold for the company to break even?

Options:

A: 300
B: 2000
C: 500
D: 400
E: 700
F: 1200
G: 1000
H: 800
I: 600
J: 1500

Alright, so I've got this break-even analysis problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem states that a company sells DVD players for $200 each. Each of these has a variable cost of $160. Then, for each home entertainment system sold, which they're selling for $600, they have a unit variable cost of $460. The company's fixed costs are $90,000. The sales mix is one home system for every four DVD players sold. I need to find out how many DVD players need to be sold to break even. The options are A to J.

Wait, okay. Let me make sure I understand the sales mix correctly. So for every four DVD players sold, one home system is sold. That means the ratio of DVD players to Home systems is 4:1. So for every five units sold in total (4 + 1), the company sells 4 DVD and 1 Home.

Hmm, so I think I need to calculate the contribution margin for each product and then figure out the weighted average contribution margin. Because break-even analysis uses contribution margins to cover fixed costs.

First, let's find the contribution margin per unit for each product. Contribution margin is sales price minus variable cost.

For the DVD players:
Sales price = $200, Variable cost = $160.
Contribution margin per DVD = 200 - 160 = $40.

For the Home entertainment systems:
Sales price = $600, Variable cost = $460.
Contribution margin per Home = 600 - 460 = $140.

But wait, the sales mix is 4 Dvds for each Home. So for each group of five units (4 Dvds + 1 Home), the total contribution margin is (4 * 40) + (1 * 140) = 160 + 140 = $300.

Wait, but fixed costs are $90,000. So how much does each group of five units contribute towards fixed costs? That's $300 per group.

Now I need to find out how many such groups are needed to cover $90,000. So number of groups = fixed costs / contribution per group = 90,000 / 300 = 300 groups.

Each group is 5 units, so total units sold would be 5 * 300 = 1500 units. Wait, but that's the total units. But the question is asking how many DVD players are needed, so I need to calculate the number of Dvds in those 1500 units.

Wait, because for each group of 5, 4 are Dvds and 1 is a Home. So in 1500 units, the number of Dvds would be (4/5)*1500 = 1200 Dvds.

Wait, but wait another thing. Is the contribution margin per group correctly calculated? Let me re-calculate that. 4 Dvds: 4 * $40 = $160. 1 Home: $140. So 160+140=300. Yes, correct.

So 300 groups of five units = 1500 units. So Dvds in this are 4 * 300 = 1200. So the answer is 1200 Dvds.

Wait, but looking at the options, H is 800, G is 1000, F is 1200. So 1200 is option F.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the sales mix is 4:1, so for each group of 5 units, 4 are Dvds and 1 is Home. So for 1500 total units, 1200 Dvds and 300 homes. So that makes sense.

Wait, but another way to think about this is to compute the weighted average contribution margin. Let me try that approach to verify.

So, per unit, the contribution margin for each product:

Dv: 40, H:140.

But the ratio is 4 Dv to 1 H. So the total units in ratio are 5. So the weighted average contribution is (4 *40 + 1 *140) /5 = (160 +140)/5 = 300/5 = 60 per unit.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, if each group of 5 units contributes $300 to fixed costs, then the weighted average is 300/5 = $60 per unit.

But fixed costs are 90,000. So number of units needed is 90,000 / 60 = 1500 units. Which is the same as before. So, that's 1500 units in total, so 1200 Dv and 300 H.

Which leads to option F, 1200 Dv.

So the correct answer would be option F:1200.

To determine how many DVD players need to be sold for the company to break even, we analyze the contribution margin and sales mix. The contribution margin per unit for DVD players is $40, and for Home entertainment systems, it is $140. Given the sales mix of 4:1 (4 Dvds for each 1 Home), the contribution margin per group of 5 units is $300 (160 + 140).

The fixed costs are $90,000. To cover these costs, the number of groups needed is calculated as:

\[
\text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Fixed costs}}{\text{Contribution per group}} = \frac{90,000}{300} = 300 \text{ groups}.
\]

Each group contains 4 DVD players, so the total number of DVD players sold is:

\[
4 \times 300 = 1200.
\]

Thus, the company needs to sell **1200 DVD players** to break even.

**ANSWER: F**
