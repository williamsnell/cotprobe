Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a patient with specific symptoms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The patient is a 29-year-old male who's presenting with a pounding heart, poor sleep, and restlessness. He's moved on from a previous job, taking a promotion, and now is struggling with increased responsibility at work. He's worried about adapting and has called in sick 3 days in the past two weeks.

Looking at the symptoms: poor sleep, pounding heart, and restlessness. Also, he's had 3 days of sick days during the past two weeks. The options are various personality disorders and mood disorders. 

I remember that restlessness and poor sleep are often linked to anxiety disorders. For example, panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) can cause restlessness and poor sleep. Poor sleep is a common symptom of these conditions.

Looking at the options:
A: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) – more about social interactions, not sleep issues or restlessness.
B: Adjustment disorder with anxious mood – sounds like it could be a type of anxiety disorder, possibly related to social adaptation issues.
C: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – more about stress from past events, not necessarily restlessness or poor sleep.
D: Panic disorder – leads to restlessness, poor sleep, and panic attacks. I think this fits because panic attacks cause restlessness and poor sleep.
E: Dysthymia – more about irritability and restlessness, but not as severe as panic or anxiety disorders.
F: Obsessive-compulsive – usually involves repetitive thoughts causing distress, not sure.
G: Major depressive disorder – more about sadness, not necessarily restlessness.
H: Bipolar disorder – high-energy, leads to mood swings and restlessness, but maybe more extreme.
I: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) – causes restlessness and poor sleep, anxiety, and panic-like behaviors.
J: Schizophrenia – affects the mind and can cause restlessness and anxiety but more with delusions and paranoia.

So, the key symptoms are poor sleep, restlessness, and increased responsibility. These are all points that GAD and panic disorder can cause. But GAD is more about chronic stress and anxiety, while panic disorder can also cause restlessness.

Wait, but GAD is a single episode and has moderate mood swings, while panic is more about immediate panic. The patient's symptoms are more about restlessness and poor sleep, which are more associated with GAD and panic. However, GAD is a more general anxiety disorder, whereas panic disorder is more specific.

But looking at the options, GAD is an option (G), and panic is (D). So which one fits better? Since the patient has had 3 days of sick days, that suggests he's had a lot of stress. Both GAD and panic can cause restlessness.

Wait, but GAD is a more severe form of anxiety. It's possible that the patient might have GAD if he's experiencing persistent stress, but panic can cause it.

Alternatively, if the patient has had a previous trauma, he might have PTSD (option C). But the question doesn't mention any trauma.

Wait, but in the question, the patient is 29, and he's had a promotion, but the symptoms are about his current work responsibilities. So perhaps he's dealing with anxiety from adapting, which could be GAD.

Another thing: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a single episode, moderate mood swings, and causes restlessness. Panic disorder can cause worse symptoms, but it's more about immediate panic rather than chronic restlessness.

The patient's symptoms are persistent. GAD can lead to chronic anxiety, while panic can cause it. But if the patient has had 3 days of sick days, that could be indicative of GAD because it's more about chronic stress.

Wait, but the options include G: post-traumatic stress disorder, which is a different issue. So if the patient had a traumatic event, he would have PTSD. But the question doesn't mention any trauma, so I think it's less likely.

Alternatively, the patient's current work might be causing anxiety from his new role. He's adapting, so maybe he's dealing with anxiety related to that situation. So GAD or panic.

Wait, but looking at the options again, G is post-traumatic, but the patient hasn't mentioned any trauma. So perhaps not. The options are A to J, and the best fit seems to be either GAD (G) or panic disorder (D).

But GAD is a single episode, moderate mood swings, and causes restlessness. D is panic disorder, which also causes restlessness and poor sleep but maybe more about panic attacks.

The patient's symptoms are more about restlessness and poor sleep, which are more indicative of GAD or panic. However, GAD is a general anxiety disorder, whereas panic is more about panic attacks.

Wait, but the options include GAD as G, which is a single episode, moderate. Whereas panic is D, single episode, but more about panic attacks.

So the patient's symptoms could be either. But what's more likely? Restlessness and poor sleep are more consistent with GAD or panic. Both GAD and panic can cause restlessness, but GAD is more about chronic anxiety.

But the patient's current situation is about adapting to a new role, which might be more anxiety related than panic. So maybe GAD is the better fit.

Alternatively, another angle: the patient has had 3 days of sick days. This is a lot, perhaps indicating chronic stress. GAD is associated with chronic anxiety. So maybe G is the answer.

Wait, but the options also include D: panic disorder. Panic can cause restlessness and poor sleep. So the question is, which one is more likely based on the symptoms.

Another clue: the question says he has called in sick 3 times in two weeks. That's a lot of stress. Both GAD and panic can cause restlessness. But panic can lead to more severe symptoms, including panic attacks. However, the patient's symptoms are more about restlessness and poor sleep, which are more of a general anxiety disorder.

Wait, but GAD is a single episode, moderate. Whereas panic is D, which is more of a single episode but more about panic attacks.

Wait, but the patient's condition is more about adapting to a new job, which could be anxiety-related. So perhaps GAD is the correct answer. Or panic.

Wait, but the options include both GAD and panic as possible answers.

Wait, another thought: the options include G as post-traumatic stress disorder. If the patient had a trauma, he would have C. But the question doesn't mention trauma.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible symptoms. His poor sleep and restlessness are more indicative of GAD or panic. GAD is a single episode, moderate mood swings, which fits.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, the options are:

Options:
A: social anxiety
B: adjustment with anxious mood
C: PTSD
D: panic
E: Dysthymia
F: OCD
G: major depressive
H: bipolar
I: GAD
J: schizophrenia

So the patient's symptoms are:

- Pianic, poor sleep, restlessness, and increased responsibility.

Looking for which disorder that fits.

GAD: causes restlessness, poor sleep, anxiety, panic-like behaviors. It's a single episode, but persistent.

Panic disorder: causes restlessness, poor sleep, panic attacks, and more extreme behaviors. It's more about panic attacks.

So the symptoms here are more about restlessness and poor sleep, which are more like GAD and panic.

But GAD is a more general anxiety disorder, whereas panic is more about panic.

But the patient has a lot of restlessness and poor sleep, which is more consistent with GAD or panic.

Wait, but GAD is a single episode, which the patient might have had. Whereas panic is more about single episodes with panic attacks.

Wait, but the patient has 3 days of sick days, which could indicate chronic stress. GAD can lead to chronic anxiety, so maybe more consistent.

So the possible answers are G and D.

But wait, the options are single-diagnosis, so the question is about the likely diagnosis.

G is post-traumatic stress disorder (C), but the patient hasn't mentioned any trauma. So C is less likely.

Wait, but I'm not sure. The patient has had a promotion and is moving to a new job, which might trigger certain stressors. So maybe PTSD (C) is possible if there was a recent trauma.

But without info on trauma, it's harder.

Alternatively, the patient's symptoms could be GAD.

Another point: The patient's current role is taking a promotion, so he's adapting to a new job, which could involve stress. GAD is a common condition for people adapting to new environments, especially when it's causing anxiety.

So, I'm leaning towards G (post-traumatic stress disorder) or D (panic disorder). But if he's had 3 days of sick days, that's more of stress, which could fit GAD.

Wait, but another thought: the patient's symptoms could be generalized anxiety disorder.

Wait, but I think GAD is more about chronic anxiety, which fits restlessness and poor sleep. GAD has a single episode, moderate mood swings, but persistent.

But the options include GAD as G, and panic as D.

Wait, another angle: panic disorder can lead to persistent restlessness and poor sleep. Whereas GAD can also cause that. So which is more likely?

In the absence of trauma, the more common type of anxiety for adapting to new situations is GAD. So maybe G is the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think I should make a decision.

The patient's symptoms fit Generalized Anxiety Disorder or panic disorder. Between G and D.

Another way to approach this is to think about the possible conditions:

- Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) can cause chronic stress, restlessness, poor sleep, and anxiety.
- Panic disorder can cause restlessness, poor sleep, panic attacks, and more severe symptoms.

The question says he's been unable to concentrate on his new duties, which might be stress related. So GAD or panic.

But GAD is a more general anxiety disorder, whereas panic is more about panic attacks.

Hmm, maybe GAD is the better fit because it's more about chronic stress related to adaptation.

Alternatively, panic could be a possibility if he's experiencing panic attacks, but the question doesn't indicate that.

Wait, but the options include G and D. So perhaps the correct answer is G (post-traumatic stress disorder), but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, but without any trauma info, the answer is probably GAD or panic.

Wait, perhaps the answer is either G or D.

Wait, but considering the options, the most likely answer is G. Wait, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, I think the answer is G. Wait, but now I'm getting confused.

Another approach: think about the options. Which of these is associated with restlessness and poor sleep.

GAD is a common cause for restlessness and poor sleep, especially in people adapting to new environments. So yes, GAD is a likely diagnosis.

But wait, I'm not so sure. Another point: panic disorder can cause more severe restlessness and poor sleep, but GAD is a more general anxiety disorder, so it's possible.

Alternatively, the patient's problem could be GAD.

So, based on the symptoms, the likely diagnosis is either G or D.

Wait, but the options are about which is the most likely.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The patient's symptoms are consistent with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), especially if he's adapting to a new job and is feeling anxious. GAD can cause chronic anxiety, restlessness, poor sleep, and anxiety-like behaviors.

So, the answer is likely G (post-traumatic stress disorder), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the patient's current position is taking a promotion, so he's adapting, which is more likely to be anxiety-related.

Wait, another thought: panic disorder is more about panic attacks, not chronic stress. So if the patient is experiencing restlessness and poor sleep due to anxiety, that's GAD.

I think I've got to go with GAD as the diagnosis here.
