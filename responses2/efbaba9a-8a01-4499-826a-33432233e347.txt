Question:

A man needed to have the oil changed on his car. On Friday, he decided to take his car to the local dealership to have the oil changed and asked his neighbor if she would give him a ride home from the dealership. The neighbor said, "Why pay the high prices a dealership will charge you? I can change the oil in your car for you. If you will agree to pay me $50, I'll change the oil in your car over the weekend. " The man readily agreed. On Sunday afternoon, the man noticed that his neighbor still had not started working on the car. He asked his neighbor if the car would be ready for him to drive to work Monday morning. The neighbor replied, "I thought about it and realized $50 is too low a price for the work involved. I don't think I'm going to change the oil in your car. " The man then said, "Look, I realize $50 is low for the work involved. If you can change the oil in my car by tomorrow morning, I'll pay you an additional $25. And I won't sue you in small claims court for your failure to perform your promise. " The neighbor then changed the oil late Sunday afternoon, but the man refused to pay to the neighbor anything more than $50. In a suit by the neighbor to recover the additional $25 promised by the man, the neighbor will

Options:

A: lose, because the neighbor had a pre-existing duty to change the oil in the car for $50.
B: win, because the second contract for $75 superseded the original $50 contract.
C: win, because the man willingly offered an additional $25 for the service.
D: win, because the man breached the verbal contract they had.
E: win, because she performed her part of the bargain.
F: win, because the man promised not to sue in small claims court.
G: lose, because the neighbor did not fulfill the initial agreement within the agreed timeframe.
H: lose, because the man's offer of an additional $25 was not legally binding.

Okay, so I have this legal question here about a contract between a man and his neighbor regarding changing the oil in his car. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the man goes to a dealership, asks his neighbor to drive him home. The neighbor agrees to change the oil for $50, but only if the man agrees to pay that same amount. Then, the man says he realizes $50 is low and asks for an extra $25. The neighbor changes the oil that night, but the man doesn't pay more than $50. The question is, in a suit by the neighbor to recover the $25, they'll win or lose.

Alright, let's outline the contracts here. There's an initial contract where the man pays $50 to get the oil changed. Then, the neighbor offers an additional $25 if the man pays more than $50. So, that's a second contract. Now, the key here is whether these contracts are binding.

In contract law, a secondary contract (also called a bonus contract) is typically not binding unless it's a promise to perform a service within a certain timeframe. But in this case, the initial contract is a promise to pay $50. The secondary contract is for an additional $25, which the neighbor is offering to get in exchange for the man paying more than $50.

Wait, the man in the initial agreement agreed to pay $50. So, when the neighbor offers him an additional $25, the total becomes $75. The next day, the man says he won't sue if he doesn't pay more than $50. So, he agrees to pay at least $50 but not more than $75.

Now, the question is whether the secondary contract is enforceable. The initial contract by the man is a promise to pay $50. But the secondary contract is an offer to get an extra $25. So, is the second contract something that can be enforced?

I remember that a secondary contract is usually not enforceable unless it's a promise to perform within a specified time. In this case, the secondary contract is for an additional $25, but the man agreed to pay up to $75. So, the man is not required to perform unless he pays more than $50. But since the secondary contract is an offer, it's not a promise to perform within a timeframe. So, the second contract isn't binding.

Wait no, wait a second. The way the contract is structured: the initial contract is a binding promise of $50. The secondary is an offer to get an extra $25. So, the secondary contract is not a promise to perform but rather an offer to get an additional service. So, the man's promise to pay $50 is binding, but the neighbor's promise to get an extra $25 is not.

But wait, the initial agreement is a promise to pay $50. So, the man is agreed to pay $50. Then, the neighbor is offering to get an extra $25, but only if the man pays more than $50. So, the man is making an offer to get an additional $25, but only if he pays more than $50.

So, in terms of enforceability, the second contract isn't a performance obligation because the performance is contingent on the man paying more than $50. So, that's not a performance contract. So, the second contract isn't enforceable unless it's a promise to perform. Since it's a promise to get an additional $25, which is an offer, it's not legally binding.

Therefore, the second contract isn't enforceable. So, the neighbor isn't legally bound to give the extra $25. So, when the suit comes in for the $25, the neighbor can't get that money because the second contract isn't there.

So, options:

A: lose, because neighbor had a pre-existing duty. Well, the initial contract is for $50. The second is for $25. So, the neighbor didn't have a duty to change the oil for $50. They only had a duty to make the change, but the second contract isn't a performance obligation.

B: win, because second contract supersedes. But the second isn't binding.

C: win because man offers additional $25. But the second contract isn't enforceable.

D: win because man breached the verbal contract. No, because the man didn't breach the verbal contract. He agreed to the initial $50, but the second contract isn't enforceable.

E: win because neighbor fulfilled initial agreement. But the neighbor didn't perform the initial $50. Because the initial contract is a promise, and the neighbor didn't perform their part in the initial agreement, so the neighbor didn't fulfill. So, the neighbor didn't perform their initial duty, so their initial agreement wasn't performed. The man's offer to pay more doesn't make up for that, because each contract is separate.

So, the neighbor didn't perform the initial $50. So, they can't get the $25 from the second contract because the first wasn't performed. So, the neighbor is out of pocket on the initial $50, and the $25 is not a performance obligation.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the initial contract is a binding promise to pay $50. The secondary is an offer to get an additional $25. So, the neighbor is only obligated to perform their part if the man doesn't pay more than $50. But since the neighbor didn't perform their part in the initial agreement, the second contract isn't binding. So, the neighbor can't get the $25.

Therefore, in the suit, the neighbor can't get the $25 because the second contract isn't enforceable. So, the correct answer is E: lose, because the man's offer wasn't legally binding.

Alternatively, looking at option F: lose because the man's offer wasn't binding. This makes sense because the second contract isn't a performance obligation. So, the man didn't make the neighbor perform the additional $25; instead, the neighbor had a pre-existing duty to make the initial change, but that wasn't fulfilled.

So, in the suit, the neighbor can't get the $25 because the second contract isn't there. So, she can't recover that money. Therefore, she loses, so the correct answer is E.
</think>

The legal analysis indicates that the second contract for an additional $25 is not enforceable as it is not a performance obligation. The initial contract by the man to pay $50 is a binding promise, but the neighbor's promise to get an additional $25 is not legally binding because it is an offer, not a performance obligation. The neighbor had a pre-existing duty to change the oil in the car, which was not fulfilled, making her out of pocket on the initial $50. The man's offer to pay more than $50 does not compensate for the initial failure to fulfill the initial contract. Therefore, the neighbor cannot recover the $25 from the second contract, and she loses the suit.
