Okay, so I've got this infinite double summation to evaluate. The series is given by the sum from m=1 to infinity and n=1 to infinity of (m² n) divided by (3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n)). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down.

Let me write out the general term to see if I can spot any patterns or simplifications. The term is (m² n) / [3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n)]. So, the denominator is 3^m times (n 3^m + m 3^n). Maybe I can factor that. Let's see, n 3^m is 3^m multiplied by n, and m 3^n is 3^n multiplied by m. So the denominator is 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n).

Wait, perhaps I can separate the terms in the denominator. Let me factor out 3^min(m,n) or something. Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the term to see if it can be split into separate fractions or something.

Alternatively, maybe I can look for symmetry. The term involves m and n in a symmetric way, except for the m² n in the numerator. Let me consider swapping m and n. If I switch m and n, what happens? The term becomes (n² m) / [3^n (m 3^n + n 3^m)]. So, it's similar but not exactly the same as the original term.

Hmm, maybe I can add the term (m,n) and (n,m) together and see what that gives. Let me compute T(m,n) + T(n,m). T(m,n) is (m² n) / [3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n)]. T(n,m) is (n² m) / [3^n (m 3^n + n 3^m)].

Wait, let's compute T(m,n) + T(n,m):

= [m² n / (3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n))] + [n² m / (3^n (m 3^n + n 3^m))]

Hmm, since the denominators are the same except for the 3^m and 3^n factors, maybe I can factor that out. Let's see:

Denominator is 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n) = 3^m * [n 3^m + m 3^n] = 3^m n 3^m + 3^m m 3^n = n 3^{2m} + m 3^{m + n}.

Similarly, the other denominator is 3^n (m 3^n + n 3^m) = m 3^{n + m} + n 3^{2n}.

Wait, but this might not help much. Maybe I can factor 3^{m + n} from both denominators.

Let me see: The first denominator is 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n) = 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n) = 3^m [n 3^m + m 3^n] = 3^m n 3^m + 3^m m 3^n = n 3^{2m} + m 3^{m+n}.

Similarly, the second denominator is 3^n (m 3^n + n 3^m) )= 3^n [m 3^n + n 3^m] = m 3^{2n} + n 3^{m +n}.

Wait, so when you add T(m,n) and T(n,m), the denominators are the same. Let me compute the sum:

T(m,n) + T(n,m) = [m² n / (n 3^{2m} + m 3^{m+n}) ) ] + [n² m / (m 3^{2n} + n 3^{m+n}) ) ]

Hmm, maybe I can factor 3^{m + n} from both denominators. Let me see:

Denominator 1: n 3^{2m} = n 3^m * 3^m. 3^{m + n} is 3^m * 3^n. So n 3^{2m} = (n 3^m) * 3^m, and 3^{m +n} = 3^m * 3^n. So denominator 1 can be written as 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n) = same as the original denominator. Wait, no, that's the same as the original denominator. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, let me factor 3^{m + n} from numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's look for a substitution. Let me set a = 3^m and b = 3^n. Then the term becomes [m² n] / [a (n a + m b)].

So T(m,n) = m² n / [a (n a + m b)].

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can split the fraction into two parts. Let's see, m² n / [a (n a + m b)] can be written as m² n / [ a (n a) + a m b ] = m² n / (n a² + a m b).

Hmm, not obvious. Alternatively, let's think about partial fractions or other manipulations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the term as (m² n) / [3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n)] = [m² n] / [3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n)].

Wait, let me factor 3^m and 3^n from the denominator:

Denominator: 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n) = 3^m (3^m n + 3^n m) = 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n).

Wait, perhaps I can factor 3^{min(m,n)}? Let me suppose m <=n, so min is m. Then 3^{m} (n 3^m + m 3^n) = 3^m [n 3^m + m 3^n] = 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n) = 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n).

Hmm, maybe I can factor out 3^m from the second term: n 3^m + m 3^n = 3^m (n) + 3^n (m) = 3^m (n) + 3^n (m). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out 3^{m + n} from the denominator. Let's see:

n 3^m + m 3^n = 3^m n + 3^n m = 3^m n + 3^m * 3^{n - m} m (assuming m <=n) or 3^n m + 3^n * 3^{m -n} n (if n >m). Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write 3^m = 3^{m} and 3^n = 3^{n}, but I'm not seeing a clear path. Maybe I can try a substitution for the sum.

Wait, the entire sum is over m and n from 1 to infinity. Maybe I can consider swapping the order of summation. Alternatively, perhaps I can separate the numerator and denominator into parts that can be summed individually.

Wait, let me try to express the term as m² n / [3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n)].

Let me factor 3^m from the denominator:

Denominator: 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n) = 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n) = 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n).

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as 3^{2m} n / [3^{2m} (n + m (3^{n - m})) ].

Wait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe write the denominator as 3^m * 3^m n + 3^m * 3^n m = 3^{2m} n + 3^{m} 3^{n} m.

Wait, perhaps I can factor 3^{m} from both terms in the denominator:

Denominator: 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n) = 3^m [n 3^m + m 3^n] = 3^m [n 3^m + m 3^n].

Hmm, not much progress.

Wait, maybe I can write the denominator as 3^{m} * n * 3^m + 3^{m} * m * 3^n = 3^{2m} n + 3^{m +n} m.

Hmm, maybe I can write the term as:

(m² n) / [3^{2m} n + 3^{m +n} m].

Wait, perhaps this can be split into two fractions. Let's see:

= [m² n] / [3^{2m} n + 3^{m +n} m] = [m² n] / 3^{m} [3^{m} n + 3^{n} m ].

Wait, that's the same as m² n / [3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n)].

Hmm, not helpful. Maybe I can split this into two fractions:

= (m² n) / [3^{2m} n + 3^{m +n} m ] = (m² n)/(3^{2m} n) + (m² n)/(3^{m +n} m) )

Wait, no, that's incorrect because the denominator is a sum, and you can't split that way. Unless I have a common denominator, but that's not applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps I can perform partial fractions.

Wait, maybe I can write the term as (m² n)/(3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n)) = [m² n] / [3^{2m} n + 3^{m +n} m ].

Hmm, perhaps I can factor 3^{m} from the denominator:

= [m² n] / [3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n)] = [m² n] / [3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n)].

Wait, maybe I can split the fraction into two terms, each involving 3^m and 3^n. Let me try:

= [m² n] / [3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n)] = [m² n] / [3^m (3^m n + 3^n m)] = [m² n] / [3^{2m} n + 3^{m +n} m ].

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as [m² n] / [3^{m}(n 3^m + m 3^n)].

Wait, maybe I can factor 3^{m} from the denominator:

Denominator: 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n) = 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n) = 3^m (3^m n + 3^n m) = 3^{m} * n * 3^m + 3^m * 3^n m = 3^{2m} n + 3^{m+n} m.

Hmm, perhaps I can write the term as (m² n) / (3^{2m} n + 3^{m+n} m). That's the same as (m² n) / [3^{2m} n + 3^{m} 3^{n} m] = [m² n] / [3^{2m} n + 3^{m} 3^{n} m ].

Wait, perhaps I can factor 3^{m} from both terms in the denominator:

Denominator: 3^{2m} n + 3^{m} 3^{n} m = 3^{m} (3^{m} n) + 3^{m} (3^{n} m) ) = 3^m (3^m n + 3^n m).

Wait, but that's where we started. Hmm. Maybe I can split the numerator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as (m² n) / [3^{2m} n + 3^{m} 3^{n} m ] = (m² n) / [3^{2m} n + 3^{m +n} m ].

Wait, perhaps I can factor 3^{m} from the denominator:

Denominator: 3^{2m} n + 3^{m +n} m = 3^{m} (3^m n) + 3^{m} (3^{n} m ) = 3^m (3^m n + 3^n m).

Hmm, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I can write the term as:

[m² n] / [3^{2m} n + 3^{m} 3^{n} m ] = [m² n] / [3^{m} ( 3^m n + 3^n m ) ].

Hmm, but that's the same as before.

At this point, I'm not seeing a clear path. Maybe I can consider swapping the order of summation. Let me consider summing over m first, then n. Or perhaps evaluating T(m,n) + T(n,m) as a combined term.

Wait, earlier I considered T(m,n) + T(n,m) = [m² n / (3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n))] + [n² m / (3^n (n 3^n + m 3^m))].

Hmm, perhaps I can factor 3^m and 3^n into the denominators.

Wait, let's compute T(m,n) + T(n,m):

= [m² n / (3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n))] + [n² m / (3^n (n 3^n + m 3^m))].

Hmm, but the denominators are different. Maybe I can find a common denominator. The denominators are 3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n) and 3^n (n 3^n + m 3^m). Notice that n 3^m + m 3^n is the same as m 3^n + n 3^m, so they are the same. So the denominators are 3^m D and 3^n D, where D = 3^m n + 3^n m.

So, the denominators are 3^m D and 3^n D. So, the common denominator is 3^{m + n} D.

So:

T(m,n) + T(n,m) = [m² n * 3^n D + n² m * 3^m D ] / [3^{m+n} D^2 ].

Wait, wait, no. Because each term's denominator is 3^m D and 3^n D.

So, to combine them, the common denominator is 3^m * 3^n D = 3^{m +n} D.

So, the first term is m² n / (3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n)) ) → multiply numerator and denominator by 3^n to get m² n * 3^n / (3^{m +n} D).

The second term is n² m / (3^n (n 3^n + m 3^m)) → multiply numerator and denominator by 3^m to get n² m *3^m / (3^{m +n} D).

So, T(m,n) + T(n,m) = [ m² n 3^n + n² m 3^m ] / (3^{m +n} D ), with D = 3^m n + 3^n m.

Wait, but D is 3^m n + 3^n m, so the denominator in the combined fraction is 3^{m +n} (3^m n + 3^n m).

So, numerator is m² n 3^n + n² m 3^m = m n (m 3^n + n 3^m) = m n (3^m n + 3^n m) [since m 3^n + n 3^m is the same as 3^n m + 3^m n].

So, the numerator becomes m n (3^m n + 3^n m ) = m n D.

Wait, so the numerator is m n D, denominator is 3^{m +n} D.

So, T(m,n) + T(n,m) = [m n D ] / [3^{m +n} D ] = (m n) / 3^{m +n}.

Wait, that's a significant simplification! So T(m,n) + T(n,m) = (m n) / 3^{m +n}.

Oh, that's a big breakthrough. So each pair (m,n) contributes (m n) / 3^{m +n}.

Wait, so then the original double sum is the sum over all m and n ≥1 of (m n) / 3^{m +n}.

Hmm, that seems more manageable. So the total sum S is sum_{m=1}^\infty sum_{n=1}^\infty (m n) / 3^{m +n}.

Hmm, but perhaps I can compute this sum by considering it as the product of two separate sums. Because, (m n) is m times n, and 1/3^{m +n} is (1/3^m)(1/3^n). So, the double sum can be written as [sum_{m=1}^\infty m/3^m ] * [sum_{n=1}^\infty n/3^n ].

Because (m n) / 3^{m +n} = (m/3^m) * (n/3^n).

Yes, that's correct. So, S = [sum_{k=1}^\infty k / 3^k ]^2.

Wait, because m and n are symmetric, so the product is [sum_{m=1}^\infty m/3^m]^2.

Now, I can compute the sum S1 = sum_{k=1}^\infty k x^k, where x = 1/3.

Wait, I remember that sum_{k=0}^\infty k x^k = x/(1-x)^2, but our sum starts at k=1, so it's the same as sum_{k=0}^\infty k x^k minus the k=0 term, which is zero.

So, sum_{k=1}^\infty k x^k = x/(1 -x)^2.

So, substituting x = 1/3, we get:

S1 = (1/3) / [1 - (1/3)]^2 = (1/3) / [ (2/3) ]^2 = (1/3) / (4/9) = (1/3) * (9/4) = 3/4.

So, S1 = 3/4. Therefore, S = (3/4)^2 = 9/16.

So, the value of the double sum is 9/16, which is 0.5625. Looking at the options provided, option A is 9/16 (0.5625), which matches our result.

So, the correct answer is option A.
</think>

To evaluate the double series 

$$S = \sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n)},$$

we proceed as follows:

1. **Simplify the Summation Pair**:

   Consider the term \(T(m, n)\) and \(T(n, m)\):

   $$T(m, n) = \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n)},$$
   $$T(n, m) = \frac{n^2 m}{3^n (n 3^n + m 3^m)}.$$

   Adding these terms:

   $$T(m, n) + T(n, m) = \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n 3^m + m 3^n)} + \frac{n^2 m}{3^n (n 3^n + m 3^m)}.$$

   Notice that the denominators are the same when factoring out \(3^m\) and \(3^n\). Therefore, the sum simplifies to:

   $$T(m, n) + T(n, m) = \frac{m^2 n + n^2 m}{3^m 3^n} = \frac{mn(m + n)}{3^{m + n}} = \frac{mn}{3^{m + n}}.$$

2. **Express as Product of Single Sums**:

   The double sum can be rewritten as:

   $$S = \sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{m n}{3^{m + n}} = \left( \sum_{m=1}^\infty \frac{m}{3^m} \right) \left( \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n}{3^n} \right).$$

   Let \(S_1 = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k}{3^k}\). Then:

   $$S = (S_1)^2.$$

3. **Compute \(S_1\)**:

   The sum \(S_1\) is a standard power series:

   $$S_1 = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k}{3^k} = \frac{1/3}{(1 - 1/3)^2} = \frac{1/3}{(2/3)^2} = \frac{1/3}{4/9} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{4} = \frac{3}{4}.$$

4. **Compute \(S\)**:

   Substitute \(S_1\) into the expression for \(S\):

   $$S = \left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{16}.$$

5. **Conclusion**:

   The value of the double series is:

   $$S = \frac{9}{16},$$

   which corresponds to option A.
