Okay, so I need to find the value of this expression: −16 + 13 + (−33). Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

First, I remember that when adding positive and negative numbers, it's helpful to think about their positions on a number line. But maybe I should just do it mathematically. Let me see.

The expression is −16 plus 13 plus −33. I think I can rearrange it to make it easier. Let's combine the negative numbers first. So, −16 plus (−33) is the same as −16 minus 33. Let me calculate that: 16 plus 33 is 49, so it's −49. 

Wait, but then I still have to add 13. So −49 plus 13. That would be −49 + 13. Let me subtract 13 from 49: 49 minus 13 is 36. So 49 minus 13 is 36, but since it's negative, it's −36. 

Wait, let me double-check that. Starting with −16: adding 13 would make it −3. Then adding −33 would be −3 minus 33, which is −36. Yeah, that makes sense. 

So the value of the expression is −36. Looking at the options, option H is −36. So the correct answer should be H.

The expression is evaluated as follows:

- Start with −16.
- Add 13: −16 + 13 = −3.
- Add −33: −3 − 33 = −36.

The correct answer is −36, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
