Okay, so I have this problem about a trapezoid and midsegments. Hmm, let me read it again. The problem says that RS is the midsegment of trapezoid MNOP. MN is 10x + 3, RS is 9x - 1, and PO is 4x + 7. The question is asking for the length of RS, and there are several options given.

Wait, okay, so a trapezoid has two parallel sides, which are called the bases. The midsegment is a line segment that connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides. I remember that the length of the midsegment is the average of the lengths of the two bases. Oh right, that's the formula: midsegment (RS) = (MN + PO)/2.

So, in this case, RS is the midsegment, so it should be equal to (MN + PO)/2. Let me write that down.

RS = (MN + PO)/2.

We have expressions for MN, RS, and PO in terms of x. Let me substitute those in:

9x - 1 = ( (10x + 3) + (4x + 7) ) / 2.

Wait, because MN is 10x + 3, PO is 4x + 7, so adding those gives (10x + 3 + 4x +7) = 14x +10. Then divide by 2, so that's (14x +10)/2, which simplifies to 7x +5.

So now, RS is equal to 7x +5. But RS is also equal to 9x -1. So I can set up the equation:

7x +5 = 9x -1.

Let me solve for x. Subtract 7x from both sides: 5 = 2x -1. Add 1 to both sides: 6 = 2x. So x = 3.

Now that I have x, I can find RS. RS is 9x -1. Substituting x=3 gives:

RS = 9(3) -1 = 27 -1 = 26.

Wait, let me double-check. If x is 3, then MN would be 10*3 +3 =30 +3=33. PO is 4*3 +7=12+7=19. The midsegment should be (33 +19)/2=52/2=26. Yes, that matches. So RS is 26.

Looking at the options, option F is 26. So the answer should be F.

The length of RS is calculated using the midsegment formula, which averages the lengths of the two bases. By substituting the given expressions and solving for x, we find that x = 3. Plugging this back into RS's expression gives RS = 26, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F: 26
