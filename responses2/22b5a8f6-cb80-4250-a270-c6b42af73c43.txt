Question:

A company created a drug to lower high blood pressure. The President issues an executive order prohibiting the shipment and sale of the drug within the United States. Under this executive order, federal agents are empowered to prosecute all interstate shippers and sellers of the drug. The President claims that he is acting upon conclusive evidence that the drug causes cervical cancer in laboratory monkeys. This executive order is

Options:

A: invalid, because it is an infringement on the powers of the Food and Drug Administration.
B: valid, because the President can make decisions based on potential risks to public health.
C: valid, because the President has the authority to ensure that laws are faithfully executed.
D: invalid, because the President does not have the power to regulate interstate commerce.
E: invalid, because the President cannot base decisions on unproven scientific evidence.
F: valid, because the President has the authority to regulate potentially harmful substances.
G: valid, because the President has the authority to protect public health.
H: valid, because the President has the authority to impose economic regulations unless overruled by Congress.
I: invalid, because it infringes on the rights of the pharmaceutical company.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about a president's executive order regarding drug sales and their impact on public health. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that a company made a new drug to lower high blood pressure, and the president is giving an executive order that prohibits the drug from being sold or shipped in the U.S. They say federal agents can prosecute any shippers and sellers. The president claims that his actions are based on lab evidence showing the drug causes cervical cancer in lab monkeys.

The options are A through I, each offering a different reason why the executive order might be invalid or valid.

First, I remember that the U.S. has some regulations regarding drug regulation. The FDA is involved, as it's the agency that issues labels and drugs. But the executive order here is about state-level enforcement, not federal regulation.

The key here is whether the executive order is within the scope of the FDA's authority. The FDA deals with the production, approval, and distribution of drugs. Their role is to ensure that the drugs meet certain standards, so if the drug is approved by the FDA, it should be safe to sell in the U.S.

The executive order says federal agents can prosecute all interstate shippers and sellers. That sounds like it's expanding the government's authority over drug sales. But does that fall under the FDA's jurisdiction? Or is it a separate federal action?

I think federal agencies have authority to regulate interstate commerce, which includes drug sales. But the FDA is separate from the federal government's enforcement powers. The FDA can oversee the drug manufacturing and labeling, but the federal government can't control every state's drug laws, especially those involving interstate sales.

So the executive order targets state-level drug distribution. If this is about states, then the FDA isn't the one making the enforcement decision here. The executive order would be the one that decides whether to prosecute states, not the FDA.

The president's claim is that his executive order is based on lab evidence, which suggests that the drug is causing cervical cancer in lab animals. But the FDA has already done its due diligence, including labeling the drug and conducting clinical trials. They've already found that the drug is safe for humans, so it's unlikely to cause cancer in humans.

Therefore, the executive order's validity would depend on whether it's within the scope of the FDA's authority. Since the order is about state-level sales, which the FDA isn't directly enforcing, the executive order is invalid. Because the FDA can't prosecute states for selling drugs, the executive order is an infringement on their authority.

Looking at the options, option A says the order is invalid because it infringes on the FDA's powers. That makes sense because the FDA deals with drug states, and this is a state-level law.

Option E says the executive order is invalid because the President can't base decisions on unproven scientific evidence. But the president is claiming based on lab evidence, which should be credible. Unproven evidence isn't the issue here; it's more about whether the FDA's authority covers state-level drug sales.

So the correct answer is A: invalid, because it's an infringement on the FDA's powers.

The executive order is invalid because it infringes on the FDA's authority to handle state-level drug sales. The FDA is responsible for overseeing drug manufacturing, labeling, and distribution, but the executive order targets interstate drug sales, which the FDA isn't directly responsible for enforcing. The president's reliance on lab evidence suggests credibility, but the FDA's role is to regulate drug safety, not state-level law enforcement. Therefore, the order is an infringement on the FDA's powers, making option A correct.

Answer: A
