Okay, so I've got this bond question to tackle. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The question is about calculating the cost of purchasing three $1,000 bonds. The bonds have a 6% interest rate, and the interest is paid every January 1 and July 1. The bonds were bought on August 30, and there's a brokerage fee of $5 per bond. I need to find the total cost, including accrued interest. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, let's think about the components involved here. First, the bonds themselves. Each bond costs $1,000, and there are three of them. So the initial cost without any fees would be 3 * $1,000 = $3,000. But wait, there's a brokerage fee, which is a one-time charge per bond. The fee is $5 per bond, so for three bonds, that would be 3 * $5 = $15. So that's an upfront cost. So the total initial cost including fees is $3,000 + $15 = $3,015. But wait, the options don't include $3,015. So maybe I'm missing something about the bond's purchase price.

Wait, the bonds were bought at 102. Oh wait, 102 is the purchase price as a percentage. So that's 102% of the face value, which is $1,000. So each bond's purchase price is $1,020. Therefore, three bonds would cost 3 * $1,020 = $3,060. But wait, if the bonds were bought at 102, that's the price paid for each bond. So the cost would be $3,060. But then we have to add the brokerage fee. So $3,060 + $15 = $3,075. Hmm, that's one of the options, option G. So why is my initial thought conflicting?

Wait, the question says the cost includes accrued interest. Oh, because when you purchase a bond, especially one that pays interest, you pay the purchase price plus any accrued interest. But in this case, the bonds pay interest on January 1 and July 1. So if the bonds are bought on August 30, then the next interest payment is on January 1, right? So the bonds were purchased after the last interest payment date.

Wait, the bonds pay 6% interest semi-annually, so each interest payment is on Jan 1 and July 1. If the bonds are bought on August 30, that's after the last interest payment date in the six months. So no interest would have been paid yet. So the accrued interest would be zero for the time the bonds were held.

Wait, no, because the bonds were purchased on August 30, and the next interest payment is Jan 1. So the period from August 30 to Jan 1 is 123 days. But for bond interest, it's typically calculated on a 30/360 basis or sometimes exact days. But since the question doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume that the interest hasn't been paid yet, so the accrued interest is zero. So the cost is just the purchase price plus any other costs, which is the $15 fee. So 3*1,020 = 3,060 plus 15, totaling 3,075. So option G.

Wait, but earlier I thought the purchase price was 102, which is 1,020 per bond. So the total is 3,060, plus 15, which is 3,075. So that's option G. But looking at the options, option G is $3,075. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: $3,090

B: $3,045

C: $3,105

D: $3,120

E: $3,060

F: $3,000

G: $3,075

H: $3,030

I: $3,180

J: $3,150

So option E is $3,060 and option G is $3,075. So according to my calculation, the correct answer should be E plus the $15 fee, which is 3,075. So E is 3,060, which is without the fee. So that can't be. Then perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should consider whether the bonds are being bought at 102, meaning that the face value is $1,000, so each is $1,020. So for three bonds: 3 * 1,020 = 3,060. Then plus the $5 per bond fee: 3 * 5 = 15. So total cost is 3,060 + 15 = 3,075. That's option G.

Wait, but why does option E say $3,060? That's only the purchase price. So perhaps the question is only asking for the purchase price, not including the fees. Let me reread the question to make sure.

The question says: "What was the cost, including accrued interest, of three $1,000 bonds..." So the cost includes accrued interest. So that includes the purchase price (102% of face) plus the accrued interest plus the brokerage fee. But as I thought earlier, since the bonds were bought after the last interest payment date, the accrued interest is zero. So the total cost is 3 * 1,020 + 3 *5 = 3,060 +15= 3,075, which is option G.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 3,060. So perhaps the question is only considering the purchase price. But the question says "including accrued interest" so yes, we have to include the $15.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the bonds were bought on August 30, which is the 1st of Jan, so no interest has been paid yet. So the cost is just the purchase price, $3,060, plus the $15 fee, which gives 3,075.

But wait, the options for E is 3,060, and G is 3,075. So if the question is about the cost including accrued interest, which is the purchase price and the interest, but since there's no interest, it's just the purchase price plus the fee.

Wait, no. The purchase price is the price paid for the bonds, which includes the face value plus the premium. In this case, the bonds are bought at 102, so 1,000 * 1.02 = 1,020 per bond. So the total is 3,060. Then plus the $5 per bond, so 3 bonds *5=15. So total is 3,075. So the correct answer should be G.

But wait, the initial purchase price is 3,060, but without the fee, the cost would be 3,060. The question says "including accrued interest", but if the accrued interest is zero, then the total cost is 3,060. So the correct answer would be option E (3,060). But I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, let me think again. The question says "purchase on August 30 at 102. Assume a brokerage fee of $5 a bond."

So the cost of the bonds is the purchase price plus the fee. The purchase price is 102% of face value, which is $1,020 per bond, 3 bonds: 3,060. Plus 3 *5 = 15. So 3,075. That's G.

So why is E 3,060? Because E is just the purchase price without considering the fee. So the question is asking for the "cost including accrued interest and brokerage fee." So the total includes all these. So the correct answer is G.
</think>

The cost of purchasing the bonds includes the purchase price (102% of face value) plus any accrued interest and the brokerage fee. Since the bonds were purchased after the last interest payment date, there is no accrued interest. Each bond costs $1,020 (102% of $1,000), so three bonds cost 3 × $1,020 = $3,060. Additionally, the brokerage fee of $5 per bond adds 3 × $5 = $15. Therefore, the total cost is $3,060 + $15 = $3,075, which corresponds to option G.

**Answer: G**
