Okay, so I've got this addition problem here: 46,911 plus 653,092. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit nervous because I don't want to make any mistakes, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I'll write down the numbers to visualize them better. Let's see, 46,911 is a five-digit number, and 653,092 is a six-digit number. Adding them together, I guess I should align them by their place values. Maybe I should write them one under the other, making sure the digits line up correctly.

So, 653,092
+  46,911
= ?

I'll start by adding the ones place. The ones digit of 653,092 is 2, and of 46,911 is 1. So 2 + 1 equals 3. That's easy, I can write down 3.

Next, the tens place. 653,092 has a 9 in the tens place, and 46,911 has a 1. 9 + 1 is 10. Hmm, so I'll write down 0 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.

Moving to the hundreds place: 653,092 has a 0, and 46,911 has a 9. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 46,911 is 46 in the ten thousands place, and 911 is in the hundreds, tens, and ones. Oh, right. So 653,092 is 653 thousand and 92, and 46,911 is 46 thousand and 911.

So, hundreds place: 653,092 is 653 thousands, so 653,092's hundreds digit is 0. And 46,911's hundreds is 9. So 0 + 9 is 9 plus any carryover. But wait, in the tens place, we had a carryover of 1, so the hundreds place calculation is 0 + 9 + 1 (carryover) equals 10. So I write down 0 and carry over 1? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the hundreds place is 0 + 9, which is 9, plus the carryover from the tens, which is 1, giving 10. So I write 0 and carry over 1 to the thousands place.

Thousands place: 653,092 has a 3 in the thousands place, 46,911 has a 6. So 3 + 6 is 9, plus the carryover of 1 makes 10. So I write 0 and carry over 1 to the ten thousands place.

Ten thousands place: 653,092 has a 5, 46,911 has a 4. 5 + 4 is 9, plus the carryover 1 makes 10. So write 0 and carry over 1 to the hundred thousands place.

Hundred thousands place: 653,092 has a 6, 46,911 doesn't have a hundred thousands place, so it's 0. 0 + 6 (from 653,092) plus the carryover 1 equals 7. So I write 7.

Putting it all together, starting from the ones to the hundred thousands, I have 7 in the hundred thousands, 0 in ten thousands, 0 in thousands, 0 in hundreds, 3 in tens, and 2 in ones.

So the sum is 700,003. Wait, let me double-check. 653,092 plus 46,911. Let's add them as numbers:

653,092
+ 46,911
= ?

Let me break it down:

653,092 + 46,911.

Adding 653,092 + 46,911. Let's think of 653,092 as 653 thousands plus 92.

46,911 is 46 thousands plus 911.

Adding thousands: 653 + 46 = 699 thousands.

Adding the remaining: 92 + 911 = 1003.

So 699 thousands plus 1003 is 700,003. Oh, because 699 thousands is 699,000, plus 1,003 is 700,003. So yes, that's correct.

Looking back at the options, option C is 700,003. So the correct answer is C.
