Question:

Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Note that 1 atm = 1.013 25 bar. Unless otherwise stated, thermochemical data are for 298.15 K.
Silylene $\left(\mathrm{SiH}_2\right)$ is a key intermediate in the thermal decomposition of silicon hydrides such as silane $\left(\mathrm{SiH}_4\right)$ and disilane $\left(\mathrm{Si}_2 \mathrm{H}_6\right)$. Moffat et al. (J. Phys. Chem. 95, 145 (1991)) report $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{SiH}_2\right)=+274 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. If $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{SiH}_4\right)=+34.3 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ and $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{Si}_2 \mathrm{H}_6\right)=+80.3 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$(CRC Handbook (2008)), compute the standard enthalpies of the following reaction:
$\mathrm{Si}_2 \mathrm{H}_6(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{SiH}_2(\mathrm{g})+\mathrm{SiH}_4(\mathrm{g})$

Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about the enthalpy change for a reaction involving silylene, silane, and disilane. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. 

The question is asking about the standard enthalpy change for the reaction: Si₂H₆(g) → SiH₂(g) + SiH₄(g). They've given me some data from the CRC Handbook and a reference by Moffat et al. 

So the given data points are:
- ΔfH°(SiH₂) = +274 kJ/mol
- ΔfH°(SiH₄) = +34.3 kJ/mol
- ΔfH°(Si₂H₆) = +80.3 kJ/mol

Wait, but wait. I think I need to be careful here. The standard enthalpy of formation is the change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So SiH₂ is a silylene, SiH₄ is disilane, and Si₂H₆ is disilane.

But the reaction given is breaking disilane into silylene and silane. So that's the reverse of the process where SiH₄ is formed from SiH₂ and Si₂H₆.

So the reaction is Si₂H₆ → SiH₂ + SiH₄. Which would mean that the enthalpy change is the negative of the enthalpy change of the forward reaction where SiH₄ is formed from SiH₂ and Si₂H₆.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about that. Let me think again. The standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements. So for the reaction:

SiH₂ + Si₂H₆ → Si₂H₆ + SiH₂? No, wait, no. Actually, if we take Si₂H₆ as the reactant, and it decomposes into SiH₂ and SiH₄, then the enthalpy change would be the negative of the enthalpy of formation of SiH₄ plus the enthalpy of formation of SiH₂, minus the enthalpy of formation of Si₂H₆.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The decomposition reaction would be the opposite of the formation. So, the formation of SiH₂ from Si and H₂ is ΔfH°(SiH₂) = +274 kJ/mol. Similarly, the decomposition of Si₂H₆ would produce SiH₂ and SiH₄.

So the reaction we're looking at is:

Si₂H₆ → SiH₂ + SiH₄.

The standard enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH°) would be the sum of the ΔfH° of the products minus the ΔfH° of the reactant.

Wait, but actually, it's the opposite. Let me write the reaction as:

Si₂H₆ → SiH₂ + SiH₄.

So the ΔH° for this is the sum of the ΔfH° of the products (SiH₂ and SiH₄) minus the ΔfH° of the reactant (Si₂H₆).

Wait, no. Because for the formation, each element in its standard state forms the compound. For the decomposition, the reverse would happen. So the formation of SiH₂ is +274 kJ, the formation of SiH₄ is +34.3 kJ. So when Si₂H₆ decomposes, the enthalpy change would be the sum of the ΔfH° of the products (they are SiH₂ and SiH₄) minus the ΔfH° of the reactant (Si₂H6).

So, ΔH° = [ΔfH°(SiH₂) + ΔfH°(SiH₄)] - ΔfH°(Si₂H₆)

Plugging in the numbers:

= (274 + 34.3) - 80.3

Let's compute that:

274 +34.3 is 308.3. Then subtract 80.3: 308.3 -80.3 = 228 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait. The reaction is Si₂H₆ → SiH₂ + SiH₄. So the enthalpy change is 228 kJ per mole. So that would match option D, which is 228 kJ/mol.

Alternatively, I could think about the reaction as the reverse of the formation of Si₂H₆. Because ΔfH° is for the formation of the compound from its elements, so the reverse would be subtracting that value.

Hmm. Let me think again. The ΔfH° for the compound is the sum of the ΔfH° of the elements minus the ΔfH° of the compound. But wait, in this case, the elements for Si₂H₆ would be Si(s) and H₂(g). But the question says "all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise", so perhaps the standard state for H₂ is gas, and Si would be solid.

Wait, but for the formation of Si₂H₆, it's Si(s) + 3 H₂(g) → Si₂H₆(g). So the ΔfH° is the sum of ΔfH° of the elements (Si(s) and H2(g)) minus that of Si₂H6(g). But I'm not sure if that's necessary here because the given data already provides the ΔfH° for Si₂H₆, SiH₂, and SiH₄.

So in the given problem, they've already provided the ΔfH° for each compound. So the reaction Si₂H6 → SiH2 + SiH4 is the reverse of the formation of Si₂H6 from Si and H2, but perhaps that's not directly relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the formation of Si₂H6 is the sum of the formation of SiH2 and the formation of H2 (since Si + H2 → SiH2). So, the ΔfH° for Si₂H6 would be the sum of the ΔfH° for SiH2 and H2.

But in any case, the question is about the enthalpy change for the decomposition of Si₂H6 into SiH2 and SiH4.

So the enthalpy change for the decomposition is the sum of the ΔfH° of the products minus the ΔfH° of the reactant.

So (ΔfH°(SiH2) + ΔfH°(SiH4)) - ΔfH°(Si₂H6) = 274 +34.3 -80.3 = 228 kJ/mol. So the answer must be option D, 228 kJ/mol.

To determine the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:

\[
\mathrm{Si}_2\mathrm{H}_6(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{SiH}_2(\mathrm{g}) + \mathrm{SiH}_4(\mathrm{g}),
\]

we use the standard enthalpies of formation (\(\Delta_f H^\ominus\)) provided in the problem. The reaction is the reverse of the formation of \(\mathrm{Si}_2\mathrm{H}_6\), so the enthalpy change for the reaction is given by:

\[
\Delta H^\ominus = [\Delta_f H^\ominus(\mathrm{SiH}_2) + \Delta_f H^\ominus(\mathrm{SiH}_4)] - \Delta_f H^\ominus(\mathrm{Si}_2\mathrm{H}_6).
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\Delta H^\ominus = (274 + 34.3) - 80.3 = 308.3 - 80.3 = 228 \, \mathrm{kJ \, mol^{-1}}.
\]

Thus, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction is \(228 \, \mathrm{kJ \, mol^{-1}}\), which corresponds to option D.
