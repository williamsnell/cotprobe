Okay, let's see. I have this chemistry problem about calcium cyanamide reacting with water to produce ammonia, and I need to find out how much ammonia is produced when 200 kg of CaCN2 reacts. Hmm, I remember that the equation given is CaCN2 + 3H2O → CaCO3 + 2NH3. So, the balanced equation is correct because on the left, CaCN2 has one Ca, one C, two N, and the water gives three H2O, which is 3 H and 6 O. The right side, CaCO3 has one Ca, one C, and three O, and NH3 is 2 N and 3 H. So the atoms are balanced: Ca, C, O, and N.

So the reaction produces 2 moles of NH3 per mole of CaCN2. I need to find the mass of NH3 produced from 200 kg of CaCN2. 

First, I should find the molar mass of CaCN2. Let's calculate it. Calcium is about 40.08 g/mol, carbon is 12.01, nitrogen is 14.01. So, CaCN2 is Ca + C + 2N. So, 40.08 + 12.01 + (2 * 14.01) = 40.08 +12.01=52.09, plus 28.02 (2*14.01) → 52.09 +28.02=80.11 g/mol.

The mass given is 200 kg, which is 200,000 grams. To find moles, I divide the mass by molar mass: 200000 g / 80.11 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 80.11 is approximately 80.11, so 200000 /80.11 ≈ 2495.36 moles.

Now, each mole of CaCN2 produces 2 moles of NH3. So moles of NH3 = 2 * 2495.36 = 4990.72 moles.

Next, I need the molar mass of NH3. N is 14.01, H is 1.008. So, 14.01 + 3*(1.008) = 14.01 +3.024=17.034 g/mol.

So the mass of NH3 is moles multiplied by molar mass: 4990.72 *17.034 g.

Calculating that: let's see. 4990.72 *17.034. Let me break it down. 4990 *17 is 84,830, and then 0.72*17.034 is approximately 12.27. So total approximately 84830 +12.27 =84842.27 grams. Wait, wait, that's 84842 grams, which is 84.842 kg.

Wait, but let me do a more precise calculation. Let's compute 4990.72 *17.034:

First, compute 4990.72 *17 = let's see, 4990 *17 is 84,830. Then, 0.72 *17 is 12.24. So 84,830 +12.24 =84,842.24.

Then, 4990.72 *0.034 (the remaining part of 17.034) is 4990.72 *0.03=149.7216, and 4990.72 *0.004=19.96288. Adding those gives 149.7216 +19.96288=169.68448. So total is 84,842.24 + 169.68448 = 84, 842.24 +169.68448 = 84, 842.24+169.68448 = 84, 842.24 +169.68448 = 84, 842.24 + 169.68448 = 84, 842.24 +169.68448 = 84, 842.24 +169.68448 = 84, 842.24+169.68448=84, 842.24+169.68448=85, 842.24+169.68448=85,842.24+169.68448=85, 842.24+169.68448=84,842.24+169.68448= 84,842.24 + 169.68448 = 85,011.92448 grams.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 84,842 grams, but this calculation gives about 85,011 grams, which is 85.011 kg. So approximately 85 kg of NH3 is produced. Looking at the options, option B is 85 kg of ammonia. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach. 

Alternative approach: Calculate the moles of CaCN2, multiply by 2 for NH3 moles, then multiply by molar mass of NH3.

Molar mass of CaCN2: 40.08 + 12.01 + (2*14.01) = 40.08 +12.01=52.09; 2*14.01=28.02 → 52.09 +28.02=80.11 g/mol.

200 kg is 200,000 grams. Moles of CaCN2 = 200,000 /80.11 ≈ approx 2495.36 moles.

Each mole produces 2 moles of NH3. So 2495.36 *2 = 4990.72 moles of NH3.

Molar mass of NH3 is (14.01) + (3*1.008) =14.01 +3.024=17.034 g/mol.

Mass of NH3: 4990.72 *17.034 = let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 4990.72 *17.034.

Let me compute it step by step:

First, 4990.72 *17 = ?

4990.72 *10 = 49,907.2

4990.72 *7= 34,935.04

So, 49,907.2 +34,935.04=84,842.24 grams.

Then, 4990.72 *0.034 = ?

4990.72 *0.03 =149.7216

4990.72 *0.004=19.96288

Adding those: 149.7216 +19.96288=169.68448 grams.

Total NH3 mass: 84,842.24 +169.68448=84,842.24 + 169.68448=84,842.24 +169.68448=85,011.92448 grams. Wait, 85,011.92448 grams is 85.01192448 kilograms, approximately 85.01 kg.

So the answer is approximately 85 kg of ammonia. Looking at the options, option B is 85 kg. So the correct answer is B.

To determine the weight of ammonia produced when 200 kg of calcium cyanamide (CaCN₂) reacts, we start with the balanced chemical equation:

\[
\text{CaCN}_2 + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{CaCO}_3 + 2\text{NH}_3
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the molar mass of CaCN₂
The molar mass of CaCN₂ is calculated as:
\[
\text{Ca} = 40.08 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{C} = 12.01 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{N} = 14.01 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
\[
\text{Molar mass of CaCN}_2 = 40.08 + 12.01 + (2 \times 14.01) = 40.08 + 12.01 + 28.02 = 80.11 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

### Step 2: Convert the mass of CaCN₂ to moles
The given mass of CaCN₂ is 200 kg, which is 200,000 g. Using the molar mass:
\[
\text{Moles of CaCN}_2 = \frac{200,000 \, \text{g}}{80.11 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 2495.36 \, \text{moles}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the moles of NH₃ produced
From the balanced equation, 1 mole of CaCN₂ produces 2 moles of NH₃. Therefore:
\[
\text{Moles of NH}_3 = 2 \times 2495.36 = 4990.72 \, \text{moles}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mass of NH₃ produced
The molar mass of NH₃ is:
\[
\text{Molar mass of NH}_3 = 14.01 + (3 \times 1.008) = 14.01 + 3.024 = 17.034 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
\[
\text{Mass of NH}_3 = 4990.72 \, \text{moles} \times 17.034 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
Breaking this down:
\[
4990.72 \times 17.034 = 84,842.24 \, \text{g} + 169.68448 \, \text{g} = 85,011.92448 \, \text{g}
\]
\[
\text{Mass of NH}_3 \approx 85.01 \, \text{kg}
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated mass of ammonia produced is approximately 85 kg. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**B: 85 kg of ammonia**
