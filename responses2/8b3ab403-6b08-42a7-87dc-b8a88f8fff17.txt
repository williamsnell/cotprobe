Okay, so I've got this finance question here about Felton Farm Supplies. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what it's asking. The question says that the company has an 8 percent return on total assets of $300,000, and a net profit margin of 5 percent. I need to find out what their sales are, and then choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that Return on Total Assets (ROA) is a measure of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. The formula for ROA is Net Income divided by Total Assets. So, Net Income = ROA * Total Assets.

Wait, but in this case, I don't have the Net Income directly. I have the ROA as 8%, and the Total Assets as $300,000. So, let me calculate the Net Income first. 

Net Income = 8% of $300,000. Let me do that: 0.08 * 300,000 equals $24,000. So, the net income is $24,000.

Now, the net profit margin is 5%. Net Profit Margin is Net Income divided by Sales. Wait, no, actually, Net Profit Margin is Net Income divided by Revenue (or Sales). So the formula is Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Sales. 

I can rearrange that to find Sales: Sales = Net Income / Net Profit Margin. Plugging in the numbers: $24,000 divided by 5% (which is 0.05) equals ... let me compute that. 

24,000 / 0.05 = 480,000. So, sales should be $480,000.

Looking at the options, option I is $480,000. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me double-check to ensure I didn't mix up any formulas. So, another way to approach it is considering ROA and Net Profit Margin together. The Net Profit Margin is Net Income divided by Sales, and ROA is Net Income divided by Total Assets. 

So, Net Income is $24k, so Sales = 24,000 / 0.05 = 480,000. Yep, that matches.

Alternatively, since we know ROA is Net Profit Margin multiplied by Total Assets Turnover, which is Sales / Total Assets. So, maybe another way to think about it. 

ROA = Net Profit Margin * (Sales / Total Assets). 

Plugging in the numbers: 8% = 5% * (Sales / 300,000). 

Wait, let's do that calculation. 

0.08 = 0.05 * (Sales / 300,000)

Divide both sides by 0.05: 0.08 / 0.05 = Sales / 300,000.

0.08 / 0.05 is 1.6. So, 1.6 = Sales / 300,000.

Multiply both sides by 300,000: Sales = 1.6 * 300,000 = 480,000. Same result. So that confirms it.

Another way: Perhaps using the equation that relates ROA and Net Profit Margin to calculate Sales. 

Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Sales.

Net Income = ROA * Total Assets = 0.08 * 300,000 = 24,000.

So, 24,000 = 0.05 * Sales.

Thus, Sales = 24,000 / 0.05 = 480,000. Yep, same answer.

So, the correct answer is option I, which is $480,000.

The correct answer is I: $480,000.

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Net Income using ROA:**
   - ROA = 8% (or 0.08)
   - Total Assets = $300,000
   - Net Income = ROA × Total Assets = 0.08 × 300,000 = $24,000

2. **Use Net Profit Margin to find Sales:**
   - Net Profit Margin = 5% (or 0.05)
   - Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Sales
   - Rearranging: Sales = Net Income / Net Profit Margin = $24,000 / 0.05 = $480,000

3. **Verification using Alternative Method:**
   - ROA = Net Profit Margin × (Sales / Total Assets)
   - 0.08 = 0.05 × (Sales / 300,000)
   - Solving: 0.08 / 0.05 = Sales / 300,000 → 1.6 = Sales / 300,000 → Sales = 1.6 × 300,000 = $480,000

Thus, the sales are $480,000, which corresponds to option I.

**Answer: I**
