Okay, so I've got this real property question about conveyances and estates. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is a bit complex, but I'll take it slowly. So, the professor owns an apartment building. He made a conveyance to his son and daughter as tenants in common. That means both the son and daughter get equal share in the property. But wait, the problem says the professor reserved a life estate to himself. Hmm. Life estate is when you have a right to inherit the property, right?

But the professor then moved the conveyance to his children and kept it safe in the family vault. Then, the son married a doctor. The professor, who disliked the doctor, executed another deed: a correction deed where he conveyed the apartment building to his son and daughter as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. 

Wait, what's a correction deed? I think it's when the grantee (in this case, the son and daughter) take the property after an event, and a new grant is made to them as joint tenants with a survivorship right. Survivorship right means that if one of them dies, the other takes over. 

So the son and daughter were previously tenants in common but now are joint tenants with a survivorship. But wait, the professor still reserved a life estate? Or did the new deed add another life estate? Because the original conveyance already had a life estate. 

The question is about the title after the son and daughter got the correction deed. Both children accepted delivery. Six months later, the son died intestate, leaving the doctor as his sole heir. So, we have to determine who owns the apartment building now.

Let me think. The initial conveyance was to son and daughter as tenants in common. But the professor had a life estate. Wait, the wording says he reserved a life estate to himself, so he has a life estate, which is separate from the joint tenancy.

Then, he made a correction deed, so the son and daughter are now joint tenants. But the professor still has a life estate. So, the son and daughter are tenants, but the professor still holds a life estate.

Wait, no. Wait, correction deed: the original conveyance was to son and daughter as tenants in common, with professor having a life estate. Then, after the son and daughter took the building, the professor executed another deed, making them joint tenants with the right of survivorship. So, the joint tenancy is now in effect.

But the professor retained the life estate. So, the professor's estate is separate, but he still has a life estate over the property. The son and daughter are now joint tenants. But wait, the son died intestate. When a person dies intestate, the survivor takes over. So, the son's estate passed to the daughter. 

But the professor still has a life estate. So, the daughter, who took over from the son, now has both the survivorship right and the professor's life estate. So, the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and the survivorship. 

Wait, but in the question, both children accepted delivery. So both son and daughter received the correction deed. But when the son dies, the daughter takes over. But the son's death doesn't affect the daughter's status because the daughter is the joint tenant, and her right of survivorship takes over. 

So, the daughter is the one who now holds the survivorship. But does she also have the professor's life estate? So, in the question, it's about the current title, so the daughter and the professor as joint tenants with a right of survivorship, or the daughter alone?

Wait, no. Because the professor's life estate is separate. The professor's life estate would, in theory, take effect only after the son's death. But when the son dies, the daughter takes over, but the professor's life estate is a separate interest. So, the daughter's estate is a joint tenancy with the professor's life estate.

Wait, but the options don't include that. Let me look at the options again.

The options are about who owns the building. Let's see.

Option A: son's estate subject to professor's life estate. No, because the son died, so the daughter takes over.

Option B: daughter and doctor as tenants. But the doctor is the father, right? Because the son married a doctor, which is the father. So, the daughter and the doctor (the father) as tenants. But that doesn't seem right because the correction deed was to son and daughter as joint tenants, but the daughter took over the son's estate.

Option C: daughter as sole owner. No, because the professor has a life estate. So the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor's life estate.

Option D: daughter and doctor as tenants. Again, the doctor is the father, so that doesn't make sense if the son was the one married.

Option E: the professor as sole owner. No, because he has a life estate.

Option F: daughter subject to the professor's life estate. So, the daughter has both the joint tenancy and the life estate. So, she's a joint tenant with the professor's life estate. But does the professor's life estate take effect when the son dies?

Wait, the life estate was reserved by the professor, so it's separate from the joint tenancy. So, the daughter would have the joint tenancy and the life estate.

Wait, but when the son dies, the daughter takes over the son's share. So, the daughter's right to survivorship takes over. So, the daughter becomes the new joint tenant with the professor and the survivorship.

Wait, but the professor's life estate is separate. So, the daughter would have a joint tenancy with the professor and she has the right of survivorship. So, the daughter and professor as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Wait, but is the son's death affecting the professor's estate? Or is the professor's estate separate?

Wait, the life estate is a right of survivorship, which is a type of interest. Life estates are distinct from tenancy interests. So, the professor's life estate is separate. So, the daughter has the joint tenancy with the professor and the survivorship. Wait, but the survivorship is for the daughter, as she is the survivor.

So, the daughter is the joint tenant with the professor and the survivorship. But is the survivorship the right to take over if one dies, or is it a separate right? Oh, right, the right of survivorship is a type of estate that is a form of joint tenancy. So, if the son dies, the daughter takes over and the survivorship right takes over.

But the professor's life estate is a separate estate. So, the daughter now has both the joint tenancy and the professor's life estate.

Looking at the options, option I says "the daughter and the professor as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate." Wait, no, the right of survivorship is a joint tenancy, not a life estate. So, the right of survivorship is a type of joint tenancy, but the professor's life estate is another estate. So, the daughter has a joint tenancy with the professor and the survivorship. So, the right of survivorship is a joint tenancy, and the professor's life estate is separate. 

Wait, but the options are a bit unclear. Let me think again. The options are about the title in terms of ownership. 

Current title: The son died intestate, so the daughter took over from the son. So, the daughter's right to survivorship is now effective, and the professor's life estate is a separate right. So, the daughter is now a joint tenant with the professor, and the survivorship takes over.

Wait, but what about the professor's life estate? So, the daughter has the survivorship, but does she also have the life estate? Yes. So, she's a joint tenant with the professor and the survivorship.

But in the options, which one matches this. Let's see:

Option A: son's estate subject to professor's life estate. No, the son died, so the daughter is the owner.

Option B: daughter and doctor as tenants. But the doctor is the father, not the daughter. So, the son and daughter were originally tenants, but the correction deed made them joint tenants. Wait, no. Let me read the correction deed again.

The correction deed was: "to my son and daughter as joint tenants with the right of survivorship." So, the son and daughter were joint tenants, but the professor still has a life estate. So, the daughter is the joint tenant and the survivor, but the life estate is separate.

Wait, no: when the son dies, the daughter takes over. So, the daughter's estate is now a joint tenancy with the professor and the right of survivorship.

So, the daughter's title is: she has both the right of survivorship and the professor's life estate.

But looking at the options, option I says "the daughter and the professor as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate." Hmm, that's a bit tangled. Let me parse option I again.

Option I: "the daughter and the professor as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate." So, the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor and the right of survivorship. But the right of survivorship is a type of joint tenancy, not a life estate. So, it's a joint tenancy and a life estate. So, the right of survivorship is separate from the life estate.

Wait, perhaps the right of survivorship is a type of joint tenancy, and the life estate is a separate estate. So, the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor and the right of survivorship. So, the options don't have that. Let's look again.

Wait, the options are:

A: son's estate subject to professor's life estate.

B: daughter and the doctor as tenants.

C: daughter alone.

D: daughter and the doctor.

E: professor alone.

F: daughter subject to professor's life estate.

G: the doctor (father) subject to professor's life estate.

H: daughter and the professor as joint tenants with survivorship, subject to professor's life estate.

I: daughter and the professor as joint tenants with survivorship, subject to professor's life estate.

J: the doctor (father) as sole owner.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the options. Looking again:

Wait, the options are:

A: son's estate subject to professor's life estate.

B: daughter and doctor as tenants.

C: daughter alone.

D: daughter and doctor as tenants.

E: professor alone.

F: daughter subject to professor's life estate.

G: the doctor subject to professor's life estate.

H: daughter and professor as joint tenants with survivorship, subject to professor's life estate.

I: daughter and professor as joint tenants with survivorship, subject to professor's life estate.

Wait, perhaps option I is correct. So, the daughter and the professor are joint tenants, with the right of survivorship. But the right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy. So, the daughter has the right of survivorship as part of her ownership, but the professor's life estate is a separate, independent estate.

So, the daughter now has both the right of survivorship (as part of her ownership) and the life estate. So, the daughter's ownership includes both.

Wait, but in real property law, a life estate is a separate estate. So, the daughter's ownership is a joint tenancy with the professor and the right of survivorship, which is separate. So she is a joint tenant with the professor and the right of survivorship.

Looking at the options, option I is: "the daughter and the professor as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate." Hmm, that phrasing might be a bit confusing. Because the right of survivorship is a joint tenancy, and the professor's life estate is separate. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor and the right of survivorship, and the professor's life estate is separate. So perhaps the correct option is I.

Wait, but the options don't include that. Let me look again.

I: daughter and the professor as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate.

Hmm, that's not quite right. Because the right of survivorship is a separate interest, so the daughter has a joint tenancy with the professor, and the right of survivorship is a separate estate, which is her right. So, the right of survivorship is a part of her ownership. 

Wait, another thought. The professor's life estate is a separate estate from the right of survivorship. So, the daughter's ownership is a joint tenancy with the professor, and the right of survivorship is a separate estate. So, the daughter has a joint tenancy with the professor, and she also has the right of survivorship.

But in real estate, a joint tenancy doesn't have a separate right of survivorship. The right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy. So, the right of survivorship is part of the joint tenancy. Therefore, the daughter's ownership is a joint tenancy with the professor, and the right of survivorship is part of that. So, she has both a joint tenancy with the professor and the right of survivorship.

Wait, but the right of survivorship is a type of estate, not a tenancy. So, the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and she has the right to survive the professor. So, the daughter is now a joint tenant with the professor, and the right of survivorship is her right.

But the options don't have an option that says that. Let me check all the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C: daughter as sole owner, subject to the professor's life estate.

No, because the son died, so the daughter can't be a sole owner.

Option I: daughter and professor as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate.

Wait, perhaps the phrasing is a bit different. The right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy, so the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and the right of survivorship is a separate estate. So, the daughter holds a joint tenancy with the professor and she has the right to survivorship. So, the daughter's estate is a joint tenancy with the professor, and she has the right to survive. 

But the options don't have this phrasing. The closest is option I, which is "the daughter and the professor as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate." Hmm, perhaps I is the intended answer.

Wait, but the right of survivorship is not a subject to a life estate. It's a separate right. So, the daughter's ownership includes both the joint tenancy and the right of survivorship. But the right of survivorship isn't subject to a life estate. So, the daughter's estate is a joint tenancy with the professor, and she has the right to survivorship. So, the right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy, not a separate estate.

So, perhaps the correct answer is that the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor and has the right of survivorship. But looking at the options, I think option I is the closest, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the right of survivorship doesn't take effect until the son dies, so the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and the professor's life estate is separate. So, the daughter's title is a joint tenancy with the professor and the professor's life estate. So, the professor's life estate is a separate right, so the daughter has both.

But the options don't have that. Let me see the options again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the daughter is the sole owner of the property because the son died. But that's not the case, because the son and daughter were joint tenants before the correction deed. But the correction deed makes them joint tenants, but the professor's life estate remains.

Wait, no. The professor's life estate is a separate right. So, the son and daughter's joint tenancy is separate from the professor's life estate. So, the son and daughter each had a right of survivorship, but the professor's life estate is a separate right. So, the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor and the right of survivorship. So, she has both.

Wait, but the right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy, so the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor. So, the correct answer would be an option that reflects a joint tenancy with the professor and the right of survivorship. Looking at the options, I think option I is the correct one.

Wait, but let me re-examine the options. Option I says "the daughter and the professor as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate." Does that mean that the right of survivorship is subject to the professor's life estate? That doesn't make sense because the right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy, not a life estate.

Ah, wait, maybe the right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy, so the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor. So, she is subject to the professor's life estate? No, because the right of survivorship is separate. So, the right of survivorship is a separate interest. So, the daughter has a joint tenancy with the professor, and she has the right to survive.

Wait, but the right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy, so the daughter's ownership is a joint tenancy with the professor, but she also has the right to survive. The professor's life estate is separate, so she's a joint tenant with the professor, but the professor's life estate is a separate estate.

So, the correct title is: the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and she has the right to survive. But the professor's life estate is a separate estate. So, the correct answer is that the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and she holds a right of survivorship.

Looking at the options, the only one that makes sense is option I: the daughter and the professor as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate. Wait, that's a bit confusing phrasing.

Alternatively, perhaps the right of survivorship doesn't take effect until the son dies. So, the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and she has the right of survivorship. So, the right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy, which the daughter has. So, the daughter is a joint tenancy with the professor. So, the correct answer is that the daughter is the only owner of the property, but that's not correct because the son died and she inherited.

Wait, no, because the son died, the daughter inherited her share, which was a joint tenancy. So, the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and she has the right to survivorship. So, the daughter's title is a joint tenancy with the professor and the right of survivorship.

But in terms of the options, perhaps the correct answer is that the daughter has a joint tenancy with the professor, and she has the right to survivorship. So, the right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy, so the daughter's title is a joint tenancy with the professor, and she has the right to survivorship.

But looking at the options, none of them perfectly match, except perhaps option I.

Wait, maybe the right of survivorship doesn't take effect until the son dies. So, the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor and she has the right to survivorship, but the right of survivorship is only effective when the son dies. So, the daughter takes over and holds the right of survivorship, and the professor's life estate is separate.

So, the daughter's title is: she is a joint tenant with the professor, and she has the right to survivorship. But the right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy, so the daughter is a joint tenancy with the professor, and she has the right to survive.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option I.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think step by step.

1. The professor made a conveyance to the son and daughter as tenants in common, and he had a life estate. So, the son and daughter each had a right of survivorship, and the professor had a life estate.

2. Six months later, the son married the daughter. So, the son and daughter were now joint tenants, but the son's life estate and right of survivorship passed to the daughter.

3. The professor then made another conveyance to the son and daughter as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. So, the son and daughter are now joint tenants, and they also have the right of survivorship. But the professor's life estate is still separate.

4. Since the son died, the daughter took over. The daughter inherited the son's share, which was now a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship, but the professor's life estate remains.

5. So, the daughter is now a joint tenant with the professor, and she has the right to survivorship. The right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy, so it's part of her ownership.

6. Therefore, the daughter's title is a joint tenancy with the professor and the right of survivorship.

Looking at the options, none directly say that. The closest is option I, which says "the daughter and the professor as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate." But that's confusing. 

Wait, perhaps the right of survivorship is a separate interest, so the daughter doesn't have it unless she survives. But the professor's life estate is separate. So, the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor and has the right to survivorship, but the right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy, not a life estate.

So, the correct answer is that the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and she has the right to survivorship. But looking at the options, none match this exactly. 

Wait, maybe the professor's life estate takes effect when the son dies. So, the daughter, after the son's death, has the professor's life estate and the right of survivorship. 

So, the correct option would be that the daughter is the sole owner, but that's incorrect because the son died.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and she has both the right of survivorship and the professor's life estate. So, the daughter's title is: she is a joint tenant with the professor, and she has the right to survivorship and the professor's life estate.

But looking at the options, none seem to exactly fit this. The closest is option I.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to make a decision. 

The son and daughter were joint tenants before the professor's correction deed. The professor's life estate was separate. The son died, so the daughter's share is now a joint tenancy with the professor. So, the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and she has the right to survivorship. But the right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy, not a life estate.

So, the correct answer would be that the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and she has the right to survivorship. But the options don't have this. 

Alternatively, perhaps the right of survivorship is not a life estate. So, the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and she has the right to survivorship. So, the professor's life estate is a separate estate. So, the correct answer is that the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and she has the right to survivorship. But looking at the options, none of them exactly say that.

Wait, but looking at the options again, the correct option must be that the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and she has the right of survivorship. So, the right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy, so the daughter holds both. 

So, the correct answer is that the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and she has the right of survivorship. But since the options don't give this, perhaps option I is the best fit.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the daughter is a joint tenant with the professor, and she has the right of survivorship, which is a form of joint tenancy, so the daughter's title is: she is a joint tenant with the professor and has the right of survivorship. So, the right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy, which she holds. 

In that case, the right of survivorship is a separate interest, but it's a form of joint tenancy. So, the daughter's title is a joint tenancy with the professor, and she holds the right of survivorship. So, the correct answer is option I, which states: "the daughter and the professor as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate."

Hmm, perhaps the wording is a bit off, but I think option I is the intended answer.
</think>

The correct answer is option I: "the daughter and the professor as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate."

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initial Conveyance**: The professor conveyed the apartment to the son and daughter as tenants in common with a life estate. This life estate reserved the right to continue living in the apartment for the lifetime of the professor.

2. **Correct Deed**: The professor then conveyed the apartment to the son and daughter as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. This right of survivorship means that the son and daughter are no longer responsible for the professor's estate but are instead jointly and severally responsible for the property, with the option to survive the professor.

3. **Son's Death**: Six months after the son's death, the son and daughter became joint tenants with the right of survivorship. The son's share was sold to the daughter, who inherited the son's right of survivorship.

4. **Right of Survivorship**: The right of survivorship is a form of joint tenancy, meaning that the daughter is jointly and severally liable for the property but is not personally responsible for the professor's estate.

5. **Professor's Life Estate**: The professor's life estate remains separate from the right of survivorship, meaning it does not affect the daughter's right to survive the professor.

6. **Final Ownership**: The daughter, now the sole owner of the property, inherited the son's share and thus the right of survivorship. The professor's life estate remains unaltered.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the daughter and the professor are joint tenants with the right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate.

ANSWER: I
