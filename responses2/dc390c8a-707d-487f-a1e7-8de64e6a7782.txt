Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about how the current changes when more lamps are connected in a series circuit. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the setup is that we have a power source, and several lamps connected in series. I remember that in a series circuit, the current is the same through all components. But wait, what about the voltage?

In a series circuit, the total voltage is divided among the lamps. Each lamp has a certain resistance, which affects the current. The more lamps we have, each with their own resistance, the more resistors are in series, which increases the total resistance of the circuit. 

Oh, right, according to Ohm's Law, which is V=IR, the current I is equal to the voltage (V) divided by resistance (R). If the total resistance increases, assuming the voltage of the power source is fixed, then the current should decrease because I = V/R. So, more lamps in series would mean more resistance, leading to less current.

Wait, but wait. Suppose the power source is fixed, like a battery. So, if I add more lamps in series, each lamp contributes to the total resistance. So, the current would decrease because R is increasing. So, current goes down as more lamps are added.

Looking at the options, option E says current decreases. Option H says current increases. That can't be right because adding more resistors would make R larger, so I would be V/R, which is smaller.

Option I says current halves. Well, that's a possibility, but I think the change isn't proportional. It depends on how many lamps there are. If each lamp adds the same resistance, then each additional lamp would cause the current to decrease by a factor of (R_n+1)/(R_n). So, the current doesn't just decrease by a fixed amount, but by a varying factor based on the number of lamps.

So, the current doesn't become much larger or fixed; it decreases gradually as more lamps are added. So, the best option is E: current decreases.

Wait, but let me think again. If all lamps are identical and in series, the more you add, the more the total resistance increases, so current decreases. So, the correct answer is E.

As more lamps are connected in a series circuit, the total resistance increases, leading to a decrease in the current according to Ohm's Law (I = V/R). This is because each additional lamp adds to the total resistance, which reduces the available voltage per lamp. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: decreases.
