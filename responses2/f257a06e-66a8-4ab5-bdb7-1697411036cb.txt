Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to think it through. The question is about a block being dragged along a table and the frictional force it experiences. The question is asking about the nature of the force exerted by the table on the block.

Hmm. I remember that frictional forces are generally opposite to the relative motion between two surfaces. So if the table is pushing against the block, the force would be in the direction the block is moving, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Let me get this straight. When you drag a block along a table, the block is moving. If the table is pushing back, the frictional force would be opposite to the direction of the block's movement. So the table's force would be in the same direction as the block's movement, opposing it.

Wait, but the question is about the force the table exerts on the block. So the table's force is the frictional force. Because friction always opposes the relative motion between the surfaces. Since the block is moving, the frictional force is in the direction opposite to its motion. So the table exerts a force opposite to the block's movement. So the table's force is opposite to the block's movement.

Wait, but the options. Let's look at the options again.

Option C says: in the opposite direction of movement. So the force from the table is opposite to the block's movement. So if the block is moving to the right, the table's force is to the left. So the table is exerting a force opposite to the block's movement. So that's correct.

What about the options. The options are:

A: parallel to the table → Yes, because friction is a force that's parallel to the surface. So the table's surface is the table, so the friction is parallel. But wait, when the block is moving, the frictional force is opposite to the direction of movement. So the table's force would be opposite.

Wait, but the question is about the force exerted on the block by the table. Let me think. The force the table exerts on the block is the frictional force. So I'm a bit confused. Because the frictional force is opposing the block's motion.

So the table's force is in the direction opposite to the block's movement. So the table's force is opposite to the direction the block is moving. So the table's force is opposite to the direction of motion.

Wait, but the question is about what the force is. So the force is in the opposite direction of the block's movement.

Wait, but looking at the options again: option C is "in the opposite direction of movement." That's correct. So option C is correct.

Wait, wait. The table's force on the block is friction. So the table's force is opposite to the block's movement. So the table's force is opposite to movement. So the option C says the force is opposite to movement, so that matches.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about other options. Option A says the force is parallel to the table. Well, friction is a force acting on the block, and it's parallel to the table. So that part is correct, but the direction is opposite to the block's movement.

Wait, the question is about the nature of the force, not its direction. Wait no, the question is which option correctly describes the nature of that force. So the force is friction, which is parallel to the surface.

So option C is correct. Because the table's force is in the opposite direction of movement, but the force itself is parallel to the table.

So the correct answer is option C.

Now, looking at the options. Let me read all the options again.

Options:

A: parallel → correct, friction is parallel.

B: equal to frictional → no, because the frictional is a force that's the static or kinetic friction.

Wait, no. The block is moving, so it's kinetic friction. The frictional force is equal in magnitude, opposite in direction.

Wait, no, the force the table exerts is the frictional force. So the magnitude would be equal to the kinetic friction, but that's not one of the options. So if the question is about the nature of the force, not its magnitude, then the force's nature is opposite to movement.

So the options are about what the force is, not its magnitude.

So the correct option is C: in the opposite direction of movement.

Wait, but wait another thing. The table's force is friction, which is opposite to the block's direction. So the force is opposite to movement.

Yes, option C is correct.

The question asks about the nature of the force exerted by the table on a block being dragged along a table, considering that the block experiences a frictional force opposing its movement. 

Frictional forces are always opposite to the relative motion between two surfaces. In this case, as the block is dragged along the table, the frictional force is exerted by the table in the opposite direction to the block's motion. The table's force is specifically the frictional force, which is parallel to the table's surface. However, the question focuses on the nature of the force, not its direction. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Parallel to the table** — This is correct, as frictional forces are always parallel to the surface.
- **B: Equal to the frictional force** — This is incorrect because the frictional force is not equal in magnitude to the force exerted by the table; they are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.
- **C: In the opposite direction of movement** — This is correct, as the frictional force opposes the block's motion.
- **D: Perpendicular to the table** — This is incorrect, as the frictional force is parallel to the table, not perpendicular.
- **E: In the direction of movement** — This is incorrect, as friction opposes the motion of the block.
- **F: Zero** — This is incorrect, as friction always opposes motion and is non-zero unless the block is stationary.
- **G: Equal to the gravitational force** — This is incorrect, as the gravitational force acts downward, while the frictional force acts horizontally.
- **H: Neither parallel nor perpendicular to the table** — This is incorrect, as the frictional force is parallel to the table.
- **I: Always greater than the frictional force** — This is incorrect, as the frictional force is equal in magnitude to the force exerted by the table.
- **J: Always less than the frictional force** — This is incorrect, as the frictional force is equal in magnitude to the force exerted by the table.

The correct answer is **C: in the opposite direction of movement**, as the frictional force is parallel to the table and opposes the block's motion.
