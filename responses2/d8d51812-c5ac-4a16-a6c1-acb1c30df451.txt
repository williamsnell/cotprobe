Alright, so I've got this problem here about Mrs. Valdez's property tax and assessment. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says she pays a property tax of 2.432 percent. Then, there's a collection fee of 1% on that tax. The total charge on her home is $70.62, and I need to find the assessed valuation.

Hmm, okay. So the total charge includes both the tax and the collection fee. I think that means the $70.62 is the sum of the property tax and the collection fee. So the 2.432% is the tax, and then an additional 1% is the collection. So, the total is 3.432% of the assessed valuation equals $70.62. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The problem says the collection fee is an additional 1% on the tax. So the tax is 2.432%, and the collection is 1% of that. So the total is 2.432% + 1% = 3.432% of the assessed valuation. So total charge is 3.432% of the assessed valuation.

But wait, the total charge is given as $70.62. So 3.432% of assessed valuation = $70.62. So to find the assessed valuation, I can set up the equation:

Total = (Assessed Value) * (Tax Rate + Collection Fee Rate)

So, 70.62 = assessed_val * (0.02432 + 0.01) 

Adding 0.02432 and 0.01 gives 0.03432. So,

Assessed_val = 70.62 / 0.03432 

Let me calculate that. Let me think. 70.62 divided by 0.03432. Hmm.

Wait, 0.03432 is approximately 0.03432. Let me compute it:

70.62 / 0.03432 = ?

Well, 70.62 / 0.03432. Let's compute this step by step.

First, 0.03432 is approximately 3.432 ×10^-2. So dividing by that is the same as multiplying by 1/(3.432e-2) = 100/3.432.

So 70.62 * (100/3.432) = (70.62 * 100) /3.432 = 7062 /3.432.

Let me compute 7062 ÷ 3.432.

Hmm, let's see:

3.432 × 2000 = 6864 (because 3.432 * 2000 = 6864)

Subtract that from 7062: 7062 - 6864 = 198.

Now, how many times does 3.432 go into 198? Let's see:

3.432 * 50 = 171.6

198 -171.6 = 26.4

3.432 * 7.64 = about 26.4 (since 3.432 *7 =24.024, 3.432 *0.64 ≈ 2.195 → total ≈26.219). So approximately 50 +7.64 =57.64.

So total is approximately 2000 +57.64 = 2057.64.

Wait, but that's the result of 7062 /3.432 ≈2057.64.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, let me compute 70.62 divided by 0.03432.

I can use a calculator approach.

Compute 70.62 / 0.03432.

So 70.62 ÷ 0.03432 ≈ ?

Let me compute this division step by step.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 100000 to eliminate decimals:

70.62 * 100000 = 7,062,000

0.03432 *100000 = 3432.

So now, 7,062,000 ÷ 3432. Let's compute that.

Divide both by 12 to simplify: 7,062,000 ÷12 = 588,500; 3432 ÷12=286.

So now, 588,500 / 286.

Compute how many times 286 goes into 588,500.

Let me compute 286 × 2000 = 572,000.

Subtract: 588,500 -572,000 =16,500.

Now, 286 × 57 = 16,302 (since 286 *50=14,300; 286*7=2,002 → total 16,302).

Subtract from 16,500: 16,500 -16,302=198.

Now, 286 ×0.7 = 200.2 → wait, 286 *0.7 is 200.2, which is larger than 198. So 0.697... approximately.

So total is 2000 +57 + 0.697 ≈2057.697.

So approximately $2057.70.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. The options are in thousands: options A to J are all multiples of 100, except G is 2750 and so on. Oh wait, wait, wait. No, looking back at the options:

Options are:

A: $3,000

B: $3,150

C: $3,250

D: $3,500

E: $2,875

F: $2,500

G: $2,750

H: $2,600

I: $2,950

J: $3,100

Wait, none of these are near $2050. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in my calculation?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated somewhere. Let me go through again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the assessed valuation.

Wait, the total charge is the sum of the property tax and the collection fee. So:

Total Charge = Tax + Collection.

Tax is 2.432% of assessed value.

Collection is 1% of tax, which is 1% of (2.432% * assessed value).

So the total is 2.432% +1% =3.432% of assessed value.

So:

70.62 = assessed_val * (3.432/100) → 0.03432.

So:

assessed_val = 70.62 / 0.03432 = ?

Let me compute this accurately.

Compute 70.62 ÷ 0.03432.

Let me write it as 70.62 / 0.03432 = ?

I can think of it as 70.62 / (3432/100000) )= 70.62 * (100000/3432) )= (70.62 *100000) /3432.

Compute 70.62 *100000 =7,062,000.

Divide by 3432.

Now, find how many times 3432 fits into 7,062,000.

Let me see.

3432 × 2000 = 6,864,000.

Subtract that from 7,062,000: 7,062,000 -6,864,000=198,000.

Now, 3432 × 57 = ?

3432 ×50 =171,600

3432 ×7=24,024 → total 195,624.

So 3432 ×57=195,624. Subtract that from 198,000: 198,000 -195,624 =2,376.

Now, 2,376 ÷3432 = 0.6923 approximately.

So total is 2000 +57 +0.6923=2057.6923. So approx $2057.69.

But the options are all in thousands, so perhaps I messed up the question.

Wait the options are:

A: $3,000

B: $3,150

C: $3,250

D: $3,500

E: $2,875

F: $2,500

G: $2,750

H: $2,600

I: $2,950

J: $3,100

Wait, none of these is close to $2057.69. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "the collection fee of 1% of the tax is charged."

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood. Maybe the collection fee is 1% of the assessed value, not the tax. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says: "a collection fee of 1% of the tax is charged." So it's 1% of the tax, not 1% of assessed value.

So that would mean:

Total charge = tax + collection = tax + (1% of tax) = 1.01 * tax.

Wait, that's a different approach. So Total charge is 1.01 * tax.

Tax is 2.432% of assessed value.

So total charge = 1.01 * (0.02432 * assessed_val) = 0.02432 * (1.01) * assessed_val.

Wait, but 1.01 * 0.02432 is approx 0.0245632.

So total charge = 0.0245632 * assessed_val.

Which is approximately 2.456% of assessed value.

So in this case, 70.62 = (0.0245632) * assessed_val.

So assessed_val = 70.62 / 0.0245632 ≈ ?

Compute 70.62 divided by 0.0245632.

Let me compute this.

0.0245632 × 2860 = ?

0.0245632 * 2000 =49.1264

0.0245632 * 800=19.65056

0.0245632 * 60=1.473792

0.0245632 * 6=0.1473792

So adding all: 49.1264 +19.65056=68.77696 +1.473792=70.250752 +0.1473792=70.4, something. So approximately 2860.

So 0.0245632 *2860 ≈ 70.4. So 70.62 is about 2860. So 2860.

But looking at the options, the closest is option E: $2,875. So perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

If the collection fee is 1% of the tax, then:

Total charge = tax + collection = tax(1 + 1%) = tax ×1.01.

Tax is 2.432% of assessed value. So total charge = assessed_val * 0.02432 × 1.01.

So 70.62 = assessed_val × (0.02432 ×1.01) → 0.0245632.

So assessed_val =70.62 / 0.0245632 → 70.62 ÷0.0245632.

Compute 70.62 ÷ 0.0245632.

Let me compute it step by step.

Calculate 70.62 ÷ 0.0245632.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1,000,000 to eliminate decimals:

70,620,000 ÷24,563.2.

Now, let me compute that.

Wait, 24,563.2 × 2860 = ?

24,563.2 × 2000 =49,126,400

24,563.2 × 800=19,650,560 → total 68,776,960

24,563.2 ×60=1,473,792 → 68,776,960 +1,473,792=70,250,752.

That's close to 70,620,000. So 24,563.2 ×2860=70,250,752.

Difference: 70,620,000 -70,250,752=369,248.

Now find how much more: 369,248 ÷24563.2 ≈ 15.06.

So total is 2860 +15.06 ≈2875.06.

So approximately 2875.06.

Looking at the options, option E is $2,875. So that's the closest.

So the correct answer should be E: $2,875.

The problem involves calculating the assessed valuation of Mrs. Valdez's home, given the property tax, collection fee, and total charge. The total charge includes both the property tax (2.432%) and a 1% collection fee on the tax. 

### Step 1: Understand the components
- **Property Tax**: 2.432% of assessed value.
- **Collection Fee**: 1% of the property tax, which is 1% of (2.432% of assessed value) = 3.432% of assessed value.
- **Total Charge**: Sum of property tax and collection fee, which equals 3.432% of assessed value.

### Step 2: Set up the equation
The total charge is given as $70.62:
\[
\text{Total Charge} = 3.432\% \times \text{Assessed Value}
\]
\[
70.62 = 0.03432 \times \text{Assessed Value}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for Assessed Value
\[
\text{Assessed Value} = \frac{70.62}{0.03432}
\]

### Step 4: Perform the calculation
\[
\frac{70.62}{0.03432} \approx 2057.69
\]

### Step 5: Adjust for the collection fee interpretation
If the collection fee is 1% of the tax rather than 1% of the assessed value, the calculation changes:
- **Tax**: 2.432% of assessed value.
- **Collection Fee**: 1% of tax = 1% of (2.432% of assessed value) = 1.01% of assessed value.
- **Total Charge**: 1.01% of assessed value.

\[
70.62 = 1.01 \times 0.02432 \times \text{Assessed Value}
\]
\[
70.62 = 0.0245632 \times \text{Assessed Value}
\]
\[
\text{Assessed Value} = \frac{70.62}{0.0245632} \approx 2875.06
\]

### Final Answer:
The assessed valuation is approximately **$2,875**, which corresponds to option **E**.

**ANSWER: E: $2,875**
