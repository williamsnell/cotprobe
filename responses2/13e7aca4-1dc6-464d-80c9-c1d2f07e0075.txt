Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the sources of international law, and I'm a bit new to this topic. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the relationship between the formal sources of international law. The options are A through J. I remember that international law is a system that's built on various formal sources, but I'm not exactly sure how they relate to each other.

First, I should probably break down what each option is saying. Let's go through each one.

Option A: Treaties supersede custom. Treaties are binding contracts between states, while custom refers to the general practice of a particular behavior. So, does one come before the other? I think in some cases, like in the International Law Commission's (ILC) case law, treaties can supersede custom. Like, in some cases, a treaty is enforceable because it's more binding than the general practice. But I'm not entirely sure if this is always the case or just in some situations.

Option B: Treaties and General Principles of Law are of equal importance, but both supersede custom. Hmm. So here, both treaties and the general principles of law are equally important. Both of these sources are more binding than custom. That makes sense because treaties are designed to be binding, and the general principles are foundational. So they are both more important than custom.

Option C: General Principles of Law supersede both custom and treaties. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I thought treaties are more important. Because generally, treaties are binding and enforceable, while the general principles are more foundational but perhaps not as binding as treaties. So C might be incorrect.

Option D: Judicial decisions and teachings are the only sources. No, that's not correct. International law is a system that's built on formal sources, which include treaties, general principles, and sometimes even judicial decisions. So D doesn't capture the full picture.

Option E: Judicial decisions and teachings supersede both custom and treaties. That's not right either. Because I think the general principles are more important than the judicial decisions, especially in modern law, where the general principles form the basis. So E is probably incorrect.

Option F: Custom and General Principles are equal, but both supersede treaties. Wait, I thought the general principles are more important than the treaties. So F might be the opposite of B.

Option G: Hierarchy varies from case to case. That's a possibility, but I don't think that's the standard view. Usually, there's a clear hierarchy, like treaties being more important than custom, which in turn are more important than the general principles.

Option H: Treaties supersedes both custom and treaties. No, that doesn't make sense. Treaties are more important than treaties themselves. That's a circular statement and probably incorrect.

Option I: Treaties and custom are equal, but General Principles supersede both. That's similar to B but swapped. So in I, both treaties and custom are equal, but the general principles are more important than both. But earlier I thought treaties were more important. So I might be wrong here.

Option J: No hierarchy. That's incorrect because there must be a hierarchy, though it varies.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recap. The key points are that treaties are more binding than custom, and the general principles are more foundational but perhaps less binding than treaties. I remember that treaties are often considered more important than the general principles in international law. So if that's the case, then the correct answer would be that both the general principles and treaties are more important than custom. 

Looking back at the options, option B says that both treaties and general principles are equal and both are more important than custom. That aligns with my understanding. But wait, option I says treaties and custom are equal, and the general principles are more important. But I think that's not correct because, historically, treaties have been more important. 

Alternatively, option B seems correct because it states that both the general principles and treaties are equal and both supersede custom. But I'm a bit uncertain because I've heard that the general principles are more important than treaties.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the hierarchy. Let me think again. Treaties are multi-stakeholder agreements, which are more binding than general principles. So the general principles are the foundational ones but less binding than treaties. So if that's the case, then the correct answer would be that both the general principles and treaties are more important than custom. 

Looking at the options, option B says that both are equal, but option I says that both are equal, but the general principles are more important. So which is it?

Another approach: the question is about the formal sources. The main sources are treaties, general principles, and sometimes judicial decisions. So among the formal sources, which are more important? Treaties are more important than general principles, which are more than the general principles themselves? Or is it the other way around.

Wait, perhaps in the context of international law, the general principles are more foundational than the treaties, so the general principles are more important in the sense that they form the basis. Treaties are then more important than the general principles. So in that case, the general principles are more important than the treaties, but the treaties are more important than the general principles? No, that doesn't make sense. Treaties are the primary binding sources.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me think about some real examples. For instance, the Convention on the Law of the Sea (CLAS) is a treaty, but the principles of international maritime law, such as the customary international law principles (like the Convention on the Law of Treaties, etc.), are foundational. So the general principles are more important than the treaties.

So if that's the case, the correct option would be B: Treaties and General Principles are equal, but both supersede custom. But no, because I thought general principles are more important than treaties. Wait, no, I think the general principles are more important than the treaties. Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that in the context of international law, treaties are the primary binding sources, and the general principles are the foundational ones. So the general principles are more important than the treaties. Therefore, if that's the case, the correct answer would be that both the general principles and the treaties are more important than custom, which is option B or option I.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option B: Treaties and General Principles are of equal importance, but both supersede custom.

Option I: Treaties and custom are equal, but General Principles are more important.

If the general principles are more important than the treaties, then option B is incorrect because it says they're equal. Option I says that treaties and custom are equal, but general principles are more important. But that would imply that the general principles are more important than the treaties, which is correct. So what's the correct option?

Wait, the question is about the formal sources. The formal sources are treaties, general principles, and perhaps some judicial decisions. So, the hierarchy is generally that the general principles are more important than the treaties, which are more important than the conventional legal principles.

Wait, but in the context of the question, the correct option is about the formal sources. So if the general principles are more important than the treaties, then the formal sources are general principles and treaties, with general principles being more important.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Treaties and General Principles are of equal importance, but both supersede custom. Incorrect if General principles are more important than Treaties.

Option I: Treaties and custom are equal, but General Principles are more important. That would imply that Treaties and custom are equal, but General is more important. So in that case, General > Treaties > Custom. That's what I'm thinking, but that's not what option I says. Option I says Treaties and custom are equal, and General is more important. So that's the same as saying General is more important than Treaties, which are equal. So that's correct.

Wait, but in reality, the general principles are the most important, followed by treaties. So the hierarchy would be General > Treaties > Conventional Legal Principles.

So if that's the case, the correct option would be that the general principles and treaties are more important than custom. So option B says they're equal, which is wrong. Option I says Treaties and custom are equal, but General is more important. That would be correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck because I'm not confident about the exact hierarchy. Let me think again. Treaties are the primary binding agreements, and the general principles are the foundational ones. So General principles are more important than Treaties. So if the formal sources are the general principles and the treaties, then the correct option would be that both General and Treaties are more important than Custom.

Looking again, option B says they are equal and both sup. Custom. That's incorrect because General principles are more important than Treaties. Option I says Treaties and custom are equal, and General is more important. That would be correct.

So the correct answer is option I: Treaties and custom are of equal importance, but General Principles are more important.

The question asks about the relationship between the formal sources of international law. The formal sources include treaties, general principles of law, and sometimes judicial decisions. Treaties are the primary binding agreements, while the general principles are foundational. Treaties are more important than the general principles, but both are more important than custom.

Option A is incorrect because treaties do not necessarily supersede custom in all cases. Option B incorrectly states that both treaties and general principles are equal, which is not the case. Option C is incorrect because general principles are more foundational than treaties. Option D is incorrect as it includes judicial decisions, which are not the primary sources. Option E is incorrect because it swaps the relative importance of the general principles and treaties. Option F reverses the hierarchy, which is incorrect. Option G and H suggest varying hierarchies, which is not standard. Option J implies no hierarchy, which is incorrect.

The correct option is I, which states that treaties and custom are of equal importance, but the general principles are more important. This aligns with the hierarchy where general principles are foundational and more important than treaties, which are then more important than conventional legal principles.
