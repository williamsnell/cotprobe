Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the glycine^+ ion. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the isoelectric point (pI) of the glycine^+ ion. The isoelectric point is the pH at which the molecule has an equal number of positive and negative charges. Right, so I remember that for proteins, the isoelectric point is the pH where the net charge is zero.

The molecule in question is the glycine^+ ion. Glycine is a small molecule, but when it's protonated, it loses a proton from the amino group. Let's see, the structure of glycine is NH2CH2COOH. When it's in its + charge state, the NH2 group loses a proton, becoming NH3.

So the two dissociations are:
1. NH3CH2COOH ↔ H+ + NH3CH2COO-
with pK1 = 2.35.
2. NH3CH2COO- ↔ H+ + NH2CH2COO-
with pK2 = 9.78.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure. Glycine's neutral form is NH2CH2COOH. When it loses a proton, the positive charge moves to the nitrogen. So the first dissociation would be from the amino group, correct.

The isoelectric point is determined by the pKa values of the ions. I remember that the isoelectric point is the average of the pKa values of the two relevant dissociation steps. Or wait, is it the average of all the pKa values that are less than the pI?

Wait, no, I think it's the average of the pKa values for the two dissociation steps because those are the two points where the charge changes. Or perhaps it's the average of the pKa values of the two pKa values that are relevant. Let me recall: the isoelectric point is the pH where the net charge is zero, which occurs when the sum of the positive charges equals the sum of the negative charges.

The molecule's charges come from the amino group. The glycine^+ ion has the amino group as NH3+ and the carboxylate as NH2CH2COO-.

So the net charge of glycine^+ is +1 (from the NH3+) and -1 (from the NH2CH2COO-), making the overall charge +1? Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Let me correct. The neutral form is NH2CH2COOH, which has no charge. When it loses a proton (the NH2 group), you get NH3+ and the carboxylic acid becomes NH2CH2COO^-.

Wait, so the molecule in question is NH3+ (from the loss of a proton) and NH2CH2COO^- (the conjugate base of the carboxylic acid). So the total charge is +1 -1 = 0? No, wait, because the entire molecule is in the +1 form. Wait, wait, the molecule is the protonated form, so the charges are +1 and -1. So the net charge is 0? No, wait, the molecule's charge is +1 (from NH3+) and the conjugate base is -1 (from NH2...), so the net charge is 0? But that doesn't make sense because the molecule is neutral in its form.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Glycine is a neutral molecule, but when it loses a proton, it becomes a positively charged molecule (as glycine^+). So the structure is: NH3+CH2COO^-.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the neutral form is NH2CH2COOH, which is neutral. So when you lose a proton from the amino group (NH2 → NH3+), the molecule becomes NH3+CH2COO^-.

So the charges are +1 (from NH3+) and -1 (from CH2COO^-), so net charge is 0. But that's the neutral form. So the + charge is from NH3+ and the - from the conjugate base.

But the question is about the isoelectric point of the glycine^+ ion. So, the molecule is NH3+CH2COO^- (since it's protonated). So the charges are +1 and -1.

Wait, but the isoelectric point is the pH where the sum of the positive charges equals the sum of the negative charges. So in this case, the only positive charge is +1, from the amino group, and the only negative charge is -1, from the carboxylate. So the net charge is zero, but that's the neutral form. So the pI would be where the net charge is zero.

Wait, but that can't be right because the molecule is protonated. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps the isoelectric point is determined by the average of the two pKa values. Because the molecule can exist in two forms: the protonated (carboxylic acid) form and the unprotonated (sodium carboxylate) form. The pI is the average of the pKa values of the two forms that are present at neutral charge.

Wait, no, the pKa of the first dissociation (from NH2 to NH3+ is pKa1 = 2.35. That's the pKa for the NH2 group to become NH3+.

The second dissociation is from NH3+ to NH2 (carboxylate) with pKa2 = 9.78.

Wait, wait, but glycine's isoelectric point is known to be around 5.92. But I need to compute it.

Wait, for a molecule with two pKa values, the isoelectric point is the average of the two pKa values. Because the molecule can exist in two protonated forms (the carboxylic acid and the carboxylate), and the isoelectric point is the pH where the positive and negative charges balance.

But wait, the first and second pKa are for two different dissociations. So the isoelectric point would be somewhere between the two pKa values.

Wait, let me think again. The molecule can exist in two protonated forms: one where the amino group is protonated (pKa1), and another where the carboxylate is protonated (pKa2).

Wait, no. The first dissociation is the loss of a proton from the amino group to form NH3+. The second is the loss of a proton from the carboxylate group to form NH2CH2COO^-.

So the molecule can exist in three protonated forms? No, for glycine, it's not that. Glycine is a neutral molecule, and as it loses a proton, it becomes positively charged. So the molecule exists as a positively charged form (NH3+CH2COO^-) and as a neutral form (NH2CH2COOH). But in the given problem, the molecule is in its protonated form, so it's NH3+CH2COO^-.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the isoelectric point again. The isoelectric point is where the sum of positive charges equals the sum of negative charges.

In the neutral form, the molecule has no charge. So when it loses a proton, the charge becomes +1. But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the isoelectric point is the average of the two pKa values of the two relevant protons. Because each acid has a pKa where the molecule can lose a proton. So, the isoelectric point would be the average of pKa1 and pKa2.

Wait, but glycine's isoelectric point is around 5.92, which is the average of 2.35 and 9.78? Let me calculate that: (2.35 +9.78)/2 = 12.13/2 = 6.065. Hmm, but the options don't have 6.06, except option H is 6.07, and option I is 8.12. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no, perhaps the problem isn't about the two pKa values but about the two pKa values of the two relevant dissociations. Because the molecule can lose two protons: the first from the amino group, then from the carboxylate group.

Wait, but the molecule is a glycine^+ which is the protonated form, which has only one proton available. So the carboxylate group is already protonated. So perhaps the isoelectric point is determined by the pKa of the first dissociation (pKa1) because that's the point where the amino group donates a proton. But the carboxylate group's pKa is much higher, pKa2.

Alternatively, maybe the isoelectric point is between the two pKa values because the molecule can switch between these forms.

Wait, another approach: the isoelectric point is determined by the sum of the charges. Let's consider the molecule's possible forms:

1. Neutral form: NH2CH2COOH → neutral.
2. Protonated amino group: NH3+CH2COO^- → +1.
3. Protonated carboxylic acid: NH2CH2COOH → neutral.

Wait, but the molecule in question is the protonated form, so it's NH3+CH2COO^-.

Wait, but the isoelectric point is when the sum of positive charges equals the sum of negative charges. In this case, the molecule has +1 and -1. So the net charge is zero, which is the neutral form. But that can't be right because the problem is about the isoelectric point of the glycine^+ ion, which is the protonated form.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can exist at a certain pH where the number of positive charges equals the number of negative.

Wait, let me think of the molecule as having two acidic protons: the amino group and the carboxylate group. Each can lose a proton, so the molecule can have different protonated forms.

The amino group can lose a proton (pKa1 = 2.35), so the molecule can be in a protonated form (NH3+CH2COO^-) or neutral (NH2CH2COOH).

The carboxylate group can lose a proton (pKa2 =9.78), but in this molecule, the carboxylate is already protonated, so maybe that's not relevant.

Wait, perhaps the isoelectric point is determined by the pKa1 of the amino group. Because when the pH is around pKa1, the amino group is protonated, and the carboxylate is deprotonated.

So, at pKa1 = 2.35, the amino group becomes protonated (NH3+), and the carboxylate isn't available. So the molecule would have a net charge of +1.

But when the pH is higher than pKa1, the amino group loses a proton, and the molecule becomes neutral (so net charge zero) because the carboxylate is deprotonated as NH2CH2COO^-.

Wait, but the isoelectric point is the pH where the sum of positive and negative charges are equal. In this case, the molecule has a positive charge of +1 and negative charge of -1. So the net charge is zero, which occurs when the pH is such that the molecule can't further accept or donate protons. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the isoelectric point is between the two pKa values, but in the case of glycine, the isoelectric point is known to be around 5.92. Let me calculate that.

Wait, the isoelectric point is found by averaging the two pKa values. So (2.35 +9.78)/2 = (12.13)/2 = 6.065, which is approximately 6.07. Looking at the options, option H is 6.07. But I thought the correct answer for glycine's isoelectric point is around 5.92. Did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think differently. The molecule, as written, is in the +1 form. So NH3+CH2COO^-.

In this form, the molecule has a positive charge of +1. But wait, that's the same as the neutral molecule. So the isoelectric point would be when the molecule has a net charge of zero.

Wait, but when the molecule is in a neutral form, the charge is zero. When the amino group is protonated, it becomes +1, and the carboxylate is neutral, so the charge is +1. When the carboxylate is deprotonated, it becomes NH2CH2COO^- (charge -1), and the amino group is neutral. So the molecule can exist in a neutral form (charge 0) and two protonated forms (charges +1 and -1). But the molecule in question is protonated, so it's at +1.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the definition again. The isoelectric point is the pH where the sum of positive charges equals the sum of negative charges. So, in the neutral form (pH much higher than pKa1 and pKa2), the molecule has zero net charge. Wait, but that's when the molecule is in its neutral form.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to consider the two possible dissociation steps. The molecule can lose a proton from its amino group, leading to a positive charge, and not lose a proton from the carboxylate group (since it's already protonated), or it can lose a proton from the carboxylate, leading to a negative charge.

So the molecule can exist in two protonated forms: one where the amino group is protonated (positive charge of +1, no negative charges, so net +1), and another where the carboxylate is deprotonated (so the molecule is neutral, net 0). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the molecule isn't neutral as a standalone, it's a protonated form.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the molecule can have a net positive charge of +1 (when only the amino group is protonated) and a net negative charge of -1 (when the carboxylate is deprotonated). But that can't happen because the molecule can't have both at the same time. It either has both charges or one or none.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again about the possible forms. So the molecule is in the +1 form. So it's NH3+CH2COO^-.

In this form, it has +1 charge. So the sum of positive charges is +1, and the sum of negative charges is 0. So the net charge is +1. But the problem is asking for the pI, which is the pH where the number of positive charges equals the number of negative charges. So in this case, the molecule isn't neutral, it's positively charged.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. The isoelectric point is the pH where the molecule can exist in a form where the sum of positive and negative charges are equal. So, for the molecule to be neutral (charge 0), the positive and negative charges must balance.

In the neutral form, NH2CH2COOH (neutral), no charge. So, when the molecule loses a proton (in the first dissociation), it becomes NH3+CH2COO^- (charge +1). When it loses a proton from the carboxylate (the second dissociation), it becomes NH2CH2COO^- (charge -1).

So, the molecule can exist in three forms:

1. Neutral: NH2CH2COOH (pKa1 and pKa2)
2. Protonated amino group: NH3+CH2COO^- (pKa1)
3. Protonated carboxylate: NH2CH2COO^- (pKa2)
4. Unprotonated amino and carboxylate: NH3+CH2COO^- (pKa1 and pKa2)

Wait, but that's more than three. Let me think again: the molecule can lose two protons, but each loss reduces the possible forms. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the isoelectric point is determined by the pKa of the first dissociation, which is 2.35. But that doesn't account for the second pKa.

Wait, maybe the isoelectric point is the average of the two pKa values where the molecule can lose protons. So, (2.35 + 9.78)/2 = 6.065, which is approximately 6.07. That's option H. But I'm a bit uncertain because glycine's isoelectric point is known to be around 5.92, not 6.07. So maybe I'm missing a key point.

Ah, wait! The molecule is the protonated form (NH3+CH2COO^-), so the net charge is +1. But the isoelectric point refers to the pH where the molecule has equal positive and negative charges. So, in this case, the molecule is in a form where it can't lose any more protons to adjust charge. 

Wait, perhaps the isoelectric point is between the two pKa values. Let me think of the molecule in the neutral form (pKa1 and pKa2). The neutral form is the molecule in the absence of any acidic protons. But in this case, the molecule is the protonated form, so it can't be in its neutral form.

Wait, maybe the isoelectric point is when the molecule is protonated to a certain extent. Let me think: the molecule can lose two protons, but each loss is a dissociation step.

Wait, another approach: The isoelectric point is where the sum of positive charges equals the sum of negative charges. In the molecule's form, which is NH3+CH2COO^- (charge +1), the sum of positive is 1, negative is 0. So net positive.

But for the isoelectric point to be where the sums are equal, the molecule must be in a form where the positive and negative charges are balanced. So perhaps the molecule loses a proton from the amino group, making it NH2CH2COO^- (which is -1), and that's the isoelectric point. So, the pH where the molecule is NH3+CH2COO^- (charge +1) equals the NH2CH2COO^- (charge -1) is the isoelectric point.

But wait, if the molecule can lose a proton from the amino group, that would set it to +1, but the isoelectric point is when the sum of positive charges equals the sum of negative. So if the molecule is in a form where it can't change the charge (like when the amino group is protonated and the carboxylate is deprotonated), that's the isoelectric point.

Wait, but that's not right because when the amino group is protonated, the molecule is positively charged, and when the carboxylate is deprotonated, it's negatively charged. So the isoelectric point would be the pH where the molecule can exist in a form where the positive and negative charges balance.

Wait, perhaps the isoelectric point is the average of the two pKa values because the molecule can lose one of the protons. But I'm not sure.

Another way: the isoelectric point is the average of the two pKa values of the two protonation states. So the molecule can lose either the amino proton (pKa1) or the carboxylate proton (pKa2). The isoelectric point would be somewhere between these two pKa values.

Wait, perhaps the isoelectric point is the pKa of the first dissociation. Because when the pH is around pKa1, the molecule can lose the amino proton, giving it a positive charge. So the isoelectric point is the point where the molecule is in a form where the positive and negative charges are balanced.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to compute the isoelectric point as the average of the two relevant pKa values. The two pKa values are 2.35 and 9.78. So (2.35 +9.78)/2 = 12.13/2 = 6.065. Rounded to one decimal place, it's 6.1. But looking at the options, the closest is option H:6.07, which is 6.07. So perhaps the correct answer is 6.07.

Wait, but glycine's isoelectric point is known to be around 5.92. So why is the calculated value here 6.07?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the correct pKa values for the molecule. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem says: Glycine is a neutral molecule. It can lose a proton from the amino group (pKa1=2.35) to become NH3+CH2COO^- (positive charge). It can lose a proton from the carboxylate group (pKa2=9.78) to become NH2CH2COO^- (negative charge). So, the molecule, in its +1 form, can be considered as having a +1 charge. But to have a net charge of zero, it must be in a form where the negative charge is +1. But that's not possible because the molecule can't have both charges simultaneously.

Wait, perhaps the isoelectric point is determined by the point where the molecule is protonated to a certain extent, perhaps when the amino group is protonated, and the carboxylate is deprotonated.

Wait, the molecule's isoelectric point is the pH where the molecule has a positive charge of +1 and a negative charge of -1. But that's impossible unless the molecule can switch between these two forms, which it can't.

Wait, no, perhaps the isoelectric point is when the molecule is in a form where the positive and negative charges are balanced. So, when the amino group is protonated (positive charge), the carboxylate is deprotonated (negative charge). So, the molecule has a net charge of +1. But the isoelectric point is the pH where the net charge is zero.

Wait, that would mean that the isoelectric point is when the molecule can lose a proton from the amino group, making it neutral. So, the pKa1 is 2.35, and that's the point where the amino group is protonated, and the carboxylate is deprotonated. So, the isoelectric point is the average of the pKa1 and pKa2: (2.35 + 9.78)/2 = 6.065, which is approximately 6.07.

Wait, but glycine's isoelectric point is known to be around 5.92. So I'm getting confused. Let me try to find another approach.

Another approach: the isoelectric point is the average of the two pKa values of the two dissociation steps. So, (2.35 +9.78)/2 = 6.065, which is approximately 6.07. But wait, in the problem statement, the options are:

A) 2.35

B) 5.98

C) 6.00

D) 8.12

E) 7.56

F) 8.58

G) 9.78

H) 6.07

I) 8.12

Wait, the calculated isoelectric point is 6.065, which rounds to 6.07. So, option H is 6.07. But I thought the correct answer is 5.92. So maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the isoelectric point is the average of the two pKa's of the two dissociation steps. Wait, but the isoelectric point is not the average of the pKa's of the two dissociation steps, but the pKa of the first dissociation.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The first pKa is 2.35, which is the point where the amino group is protonated, giving a positive charge. The second pKa is 9.78, where the carboxylate group is protonated, giving a negative charge.

So, the isoelectric point is where the net charge is zero. So, the molecule must have a negative charge of -1, and a positive charge of +1. But that can't happen because the molecule can't have both charges at the same time.

Wait, perhaps the isoelectric point is the point where the molecule is in a form where the positive and negative charges are balanced. So, when the amino group is protonated (positive charge +1), the carboxylate is deprotonated (negative charge -1). So, the molecule has a net charge of zero. Thus, the isoelectric point is the pH where this occurs, which is the average of the two pKa's.

So, (2.35 +9.78)/2 = 6.065, which is approximately 6.07. So, option H is 6.07, which would be the correct answer. However, I thought glycine's isoelectric point is around 5.92. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the isoelectric point is when the molecule is in the neutral form, but that can't be because the neutral form has no charge. Alternatively, perhaps the isoelectric point is when the molecule is in the form where the positive and negative charges are balanced.

Wait, another way: The isoelectric point is the pH where the sum of the positive charges equals the sum of the negative charges.

In this case, the molecule can have a charge of +1 (amino group protonated) and -1 (carboxylate group deprotonated). But that would require both charges to be present, which isn't possible. So, the only way for the sum of positive charges to equal the sum of negative charges is when the molecule has a charge of zero, which occurs when the amino group is protonated and the carboxylate is deprotonated.

Wait, that can't be right because the molecule can't have both charges. Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me try to conclude.

The isoelectric point is the average of the two pKa values of the two dissociation steps. So, (2.35 +9.78)/2=6.065, which is approximately 6.07. So option H is the correct answer.
</think>

The isoelectric point (pI) of the molecule is determined by the average of the two dissociation pKa values. For the molecule, the relevant dissociation steps are:

1. Protonation of the amino group at pKa₁ = 2.35 (positive charge).
2. Protonation of the carboxylate group at pKa₂ = 9.78 (negative charge).

The isoelectric point is the pH where the sum of the positive charges equals the sum of the negative charges. Since the molecule can exist in forms where it has a positive charge (+1) and a negative charge (-1), the isoelectric point occurs when these charges are balanced. This happens when the amino group is protonated (positive charge) and the carboxylate group is deprotonated (negative charge), resulting in a net charge of zero.

The isoelectric point is calculated as the average of the two pKa values:

\[
\text{pI} = \frac{\text{pKa}_1 + \text{pKa}_2}{2} = \frac{2.35 + 9.78}{2} = \frac{12.13}{2} = 6.065
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the isoelectric point is approximately 6.07. Therefore, the correct answer is:
