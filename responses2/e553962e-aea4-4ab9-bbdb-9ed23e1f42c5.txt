Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about sarcomeres in skeletal muscle. I'm a bit rusty on my muscle structure, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about which statement is correct regarding a sarcomere in striated muscle. The options are A through H. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The A band shortens during muscle contraction. Hmm. The A band is a structure where the sarcomere is stretched. I remember that during muscle contraction, the length of the A band increases because the sarcomere tightens. Oh wait, no, when you contract, the sarcomere shortens. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, the A band is the part that remains in length. So during contraction, the sarcomere shortens, meaning the A band shortens, right? Or is it the opposite? Oh wait, during relaxation, the A band is longer, and during contraction, it's shorter. So A says the A band shortens, which is correct. But I need to check. Or maybe A band is in the middle. Wait, I think during contraction, the sarcomere becomes more compact, so the A band shortens. So A is correct. But I'm not sure yet. Let's check the other options.

Option B: During contraction, H zones become elongated. H zones are the areas where the actin and myosin filaments cross. I think during contraction, the H zone becomes more extended, because the filaments move towards each other. So B sounds correct. But wait, I'm not entirely certain. I'll come back to this.

Option C: Proteins troponin and tropomyosin form thin and thick filaments. I think that's right. I remember that the thick filaments are made of tropomyosin and the thin of troponin. So C is correct. But wait, the question is about which statement is correct, so all may not be. So let's see each.

Option D: Myosin filaments are in the I band. I'm not sure about that. The I band is where the sarcomere is relaxed. I think the thick filaments are in the I band, where they're moving to contract. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Troponin and tropomyosin are in the H zone. I recall that H zones are where the actin and myosin filaments cross. During contraction, the H zone moves towards the center, and myosin contracts. So if E is saying they are in the H zone, that must be incorrect. Because they are moving to the center, not being there.

Option F: Tropomyosin binds to myosin, blocking. I think during the phase of contraction, when the sarcomere is moving towards the center, the myosin is attached to the thick filaments, and the actin is attached to the thin. So during the phase where myosin is moving, it would be bound to the thick filaments. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, in the phase of the sarcomere's movement towards the center (contraction), the myosin is attached to the thick filaments, and the actin is attached to the thin. So when the sarcomere is in the H zone, the contract bridge is formed. So the actin is on the thin, and the myosin is on the thick. But during that time, the tropomyosin is on the thick and myosin on the thin. So F says it's the opposite, that tropomyosin binds to myosin. That would be when the sarcomere is in the I zone, I think. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Thin filaments are myosin. No, I think the thick filaments are made of tropomyosin, and the thin are made of myosin. So G is incorrect.

Option H: In relaxed position, tropomyosin blocks myosin's access. I'm not too sure about this. In the relaxed position, the sarcomere is in the H zone, so the actin is attached to the thin filaments, and the myosin is attached to the thick. So I think during relaxation, the thick filaments are on the myosin side (tropomyosin), and the thin are on the actin side. So during relaxation, like when the sarcomere is at rest, the thick filaments are attached to myosin. So H says in the relaxed position, tropomyosin blocks myosin's access. Wait, that doesn't make sense because I think the thick is where the myosin is. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the zones. Let me think about the zones again. The I band is relaxed, and the H zone is where they cross. So during the H phase, the actin is on the thin, and the myosin on the thick. So during H, the thick is where the myosin is attached. So myosin wouldn't be blocked by tropomyosin in that situation. So H is incorrect.

So let's recap:

Option A: Is the A band shortening? During contraction, the sarcomere becomes more compact. So A band shortens, so A is correct. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right answer. Let's see other options.

Option B: During contraction, H zones become elongated. I think that's correct because the contraction moves the H zone towards the center. So B is correct.

Wait, but the question says which statement is correct. So perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are presented as letters A to H, and we have to pick one correct statement. Or is the question that only one statement is correct?

Wait, the question is phrased: "Which of the following statements concerning a sarcomere of a striated muscle (such as skeletal muscle) is correct?" So only one is correct. So now I have to see which one is correct.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: A band shortens. Correct.

Option B: H zones elongate. Correct.

Option E: Trop. and tropo. in H. Incorrect.

Option C: correct, but let's see.

So which statements are correct?

Wait, the question is which is correct, so perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are all separate. So the correct answer is one of the options.

Now, looking again:

Option C: Proteins are in H. That's correct, I think.

So let's reevaluate each statement.

Option A: Correct.

Option B: Correct.

Option C: Correct.

But that can't be, as the options are all separate. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct answers are multiple, but the question is a multiple-choice with each option, but the options are letters A to H, each possibly correct but only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think again.

Let me go through each. 

A: The A band shortens during muscle contraction. Yes, during contraction, the sarcomere shortens, so the A band shortens. So A is correct.

B: H zones become elongated. Correct. Because during contraction, the H zone (where the filaments cross) moves towards the center, making it longer.

C: The thick and thin filaments are made of tropo and troponin. Correct.

D: Myosin in I band. I think that's the thick filaments, so D is incorrect.

E: The H zone contains both. No, because during the phase of movement, the H zone is where the myosin is attached to thick, and the actin is on thin. So E is incorrect.

F: Tropom. binds to myosin. No, because during the H phase, the myosin is on thick, and in I phase, it's on thin.

G: Thin is myosin. No, thick is.

H: In relaxed position, H zone has tropom. blocking. No. Because in relaxed (H zone), the filaments are arranged with myosin on thick.

So the correct options are A, B, C, and C is correct.

But the question is about which statement is correct, so I think all correct except perhaps some.

Wait the options are A to H, each statement. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach each statement again.

Option A: The A band shortens during muscle contraction. Correct.

Option B: During contraction, H zones become elongated. Correct.

Option C: The proteins are correct.

Option E: No, E is about H having both, which is wrong.

So the correct options would be A, B, and C. But the question gives options A to H, each as a statement, and only one is correct. Or, perhaps the question is which option is correct, and there may be more than one correct.

Wait, the question says "which of the following is correct", so perhaps more than one is correct. But the options are all separate, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the options have more than one correct answer, but the question is a multiple-choice where you pick one correct, but perhaps the correct answer is only one.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C: The proteins are correct. So that's correct.

So perhaps the correct answers are A, B, C, but the options are presented in a way that only one is correct. Or perhaps the question is about which one is correct.

Wait, the options are A to H, each statement. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me think about each.

Option A: The A band shortens. Correct. Because during contraction, the sarcomere becomes more relaxed, so the A band shortens.

Option B: The H zones become elongated during contraction. Correct, because during the phase where the sarcomere is moving towards the center (contraction), the H zone lengthens. So B is correct.

Option C: The proteins are correct. So this is correct.

Options D: Myosin in the I band. Correct, because it's the thick filaments.

Wait, but the I band is where the sarcomere is relaxed. So the thick filaments are on the myosin side, so the I band is in the thick. So D is correct.

So perhaps more than one is correct. But the question is about which of the following is correct. So perhaps all except for one are correct, but the question is phrased to choose the correct statement.

But looking at the options, each is a separate statement, and the question says which statement is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is multiple, but the options are to choose one. Alternatively, maybe only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the answers. Let me check another approach.

I think the correct options are A, B, C, and D is incorrect. Let's see:

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of each statement.

Option C: The proteins are correct. So that's correct.

Option A is correct, but I'm not sure about the others.

Option B is correct.

So which of the options is correct? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A, B, and C. But the question options are letters, so perhaps the correct answer is option C. Wait, the question says 'which statement is correct' and each option is a statement.

Wait, perhaps the correct statement is C, but I need to check.

So, the correct options are A, B, C.

Looking for the correct answer, perhaps the correct statements are A, B, and C. But the options are presented as separate statements.

Wait, perhaps the question is only one correct statement.

Wait, another approach: think of the sarcomere in the relaxed state (H zone) and the active state (I zone).

In the relaxed state, the sarcomere is in the H zone. The thick filaments are attached to myosin, and the thin filaments are attached to actin. So the statement in option D is correct. So D is correct.

So correct statements would be A, B, C, D, and E, etc. But looking again, the question is about which of the statements is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the correct answer is option C: Proteins are correct. Alternatively, the correct answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but let's think about each of the options again.

Option A: Correct. Because during contraction, the sarcomere shortens, so the A band shortens.

Option B: Correct. Because during contraction, the H zone moves towards the center, making it longer.

Option C: Correct. Because the thick is made of tropomyosin, and the thin of myosin.

Option D: Correct. Because in I band, the myosin is attached to thick filaments.

Option E: Incorrect. H zone doesn't have both.

Option F: Incorrect. Because during H phase, myosin is on thick.

Option G: Incorrect. Thin is myosin.

Option H: Incorrect. In H phase, myosin is on thick.

So all of A, B, C, D are correct. But the options are presented as separate, so perhaps the question is which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answers are A, B, and C, but the question only allows one correct. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of what each option says.

The question is about which is correct. So for each statement, I'll evaluate.

A: Correct.

B: Correct.

C: Correct.

D: Correct.

So which of these is correct? Because the question is presented as a multiple-choice, but only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about the sarcomere structure.

In the H zone (relaxed position), the sarcomere is in the I band, which is where the sarcomere is at rest. The I band has the thick filaments on myosin, and the thin filaments on actin.

Wait, in the H zone (relaxed), the sarcomere is in the H zone. So the sarcomere is in the I band, but the sarcomere is in the relaxed position (H zone), which is the state where the sarcomere is resting. So perhaps the statement D is correct because in the I band, the sarcomere is at rest, and the thick filaments are attached to myosin.

So D is correct.

So, the correct options are A, B, C, D, but the question is which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about each option again.

Option C: The proteins (tropo and troponin) are correct. Yes, the thick filaments are made of tropomyosin, and thin of myosin.

So C is correct.

Therefore, correct statements are A, B, C, D.

But the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps all of these are correct, but the options are A to H, each a separate statement. So I need to choose all correct ones.

Wait, but the question is presented as multiple-choice options, each (A to H) being a statement. The question is, which statement is correct. So perhaps the correct answers are multiple, but the question is a single-choice. So perhaps I have to select the correct letter.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but I'm not. Let me think to recall the sarcomere structure.

The sarcomere is a bundle of myosin and actin filaments connected by bridgehead proteins. The sarcomere has two main bulges: the I band on the outside and the H band (relaxed) in the center.

In the I band, the thick filaments are attached to myosin, and the thin to actin. So D is correct.

In the H band (relaxed), the sarcomere is in the I band, so the thick filaments are on the myosin side. So D is correct.

So which of the options is correct?

The question is which statement is correct. So, all the options except E and others are correct.

Wait, but the question is a single choice. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the question is in the context of a question where the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to pick the correct option.

Looking back, I think the correct answer is C. Because the proteins are correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought A, B, C, D are correct. However, the options are presented as single letters, so perhaps only one is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of what the question is actually about. The question is about which statement is correct concerning a sarcomere.

Looking for each option:

Option C says the proteins are correct. Yes, that's right.

So the correct answer must be option C.
</think>

To determine the correct statement about a sarcomere in striated muscle, each option was analyzed as follows:

### Option A: "The A band shortens during muscle contraction."
This is correct. During contraction, the sarcomere shortens, causing the A band to shorten. The A band is a region where the sarcomere is stretched, and its length decreases.

### Option B: "During contraction, H zones become elongated."
This is also correct. The H zone (heterogeneous zone) is where the sarcomere crosses, and during contraction, it moves towards the center, elongating.

### Option C: "The proteins troponin and tropomyosin constitute the thick and thin filaments, respectively."
This is correct. In the sarcomere, the thick filaments are composed of tropomyosin, and the thin filaments are composed of myosin. This arrangement is consistent with the structure of the sarcomere.

### Option D: "Myosin filaments are found in the I band."
This is correct. The I band (intact zone) is where the sarcomere is relaxed. During this state, the thick filaments are attached to myosin, and the thin filaments are attached to actin.

### Option E: "Troponin and tropomyosin are located in the H zone."
This is incorrect. The H zone (heterogeneous zone) is where the sarcomere is in the relaxed state. During this state, the thick filaments are attached to myosin, and the thin filaments are attached to actin.

### Option F: "Tropomyosin binds to myosin, blocking the actin-binding site."
This is incorrect. During the H zone, the thick filaments are attached to myosin, and the thin filaments are attached to actin. There is no binding between tropomyosin and myosin in this state.

### Option G: "The thin filaments are made of myosin."
This is incorrect. The thick filaments are made of tropomyosin, and the thin filaments are made of myosin.

### Option H: "In the relaxed position, tropomyosin impedes myosin's access."
This is incorrect. In the relaxed state (H zone), the sarcomere is in the H zone, and the thick filaments are attached to myosin. There is no binding between tropomyosin and myosin in this state.

### Conclusion:
Options A, B, C, and D are all correct statements about the sarcomere. However, since the question asks for a single correct answer, the most comprehensive and accurate choice is **C**, as it directly describes the composition of the sarcomere.

ANSWER: C
