Okay, so I need to figure out how much someone needs to earn annually to be among the top one percent of global residents. I remember hearing that the top earners can make a lot of money, maybe even more than the average. But I'm not exactly sure how precise that is.

Let me think about the data. I think the top 1% of global annual income is a significant portion. I recall that as of recent estimates, the average global annual income is around $56,000. But wait, that's the average. The top earners are way above that. 

I remember reading somewhere that the top 1% makes about $150,000 or more. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact figure. Let me check my memory. Oh yeah, I think $150,000 is the approximate amount. So if someone makes that amount, they're in the top one percent.

Looking at the options provided, option H is $150,000. Option I is $250,000, which is higher. But I think $150k is the typical figure for that top percentile. So the correct answer should be H, $150,000.

The correct answer is H, $150,000.

Answer: H
