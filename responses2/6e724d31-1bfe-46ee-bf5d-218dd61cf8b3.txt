Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about slippery-slope arguments. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is asking when a slippery-slope pattern of argument is fallacious. Let's break down what a slippery-slope argument is. From what I remember, a slippery slope is a situation where someone presents a chain of events that seem to lead to a very negative outcome, but it's actually not that straightforward. It's a common fallacy because people assume that if each step leads to another, eventually, something bad will happen. But it's not necessarily the case.

The options are A to J. Let me think about each one.

Option A: There is a good reason to think that doing one action will inevitably lead to another undesirable action. Wait, that sounds like the opposite. If there's a good reason, then it's not a slippery slope. So A is not the correct answer because the argument is fallacious when there's a good reason.

Option B: It is based on a logical progression. A logical progression is the opposite of a slippery slope. So B is not correct either.

Option C: There are more than two possible results. Hmm, I'm not sure. I thought a slippery slope is about the chain of a single bad outcome leading to more, not multiple. But is the number of possible results relevant? Maybe if there are too many possible outcomes, it's more of a problem. But I'm not sure if that's the main point here.

Option D: It is based on a series of cause and effect situations. Wait, a cause and effect chain suggests that each step leads to the next, which is the slippery slope. So D is actually a characteristic of a slippery slope, not the fallacy. So D wouldn't be the answer.

Option E: It is grounded in established facts. Well, if the argument is based on facts, it might not be a slippery slope at all. So E isn't the right answer.

Option F: It is based on a hypothetical situation. Hypothetical situations are common in slippery slopes because they're about assuming a chain reaction. So F might be correct, but I'm not certain.

Option G: There is no good reason to think that doing one action will inevitably lead to another undesirable action. Wait, that sounds like A again. If there's no good reason, then the argument is fallacious. So G is the opposite of A.

Option H: There are only two possible results. If there are only two, maybe it's a different scenario. For example, if each action only leads to one outcome, then a slippery slope isn't the case. But I'm not sure. Maybe H is relevant.

Option I: There is a significant amount of evidence supporting the pattern. That's about support, not the nature of the argument. So I's not the right answer.

Option J: It is hypothetical. Again, similar to F and J. If the argument is hypothetical, it's more about the cause-effect chain, not the slippery slope.

Now, putting it all together. The slippery-slope argument is fallacious when there's a good reason to think that one action leads to another undesirable outcome. So the fallacy occurs when the argument is based on a chain that seems to inevitably lead to a bad thing, but it's not guaranteed. So the correct answer should be when there's a good reason to think that one action will lead to another bad thing.

Looking at the options, option A says "There is a good reason to think that doing one action will inevitably lead to another undesirable action." That's exactly when the argument is fallacious. So the answer is A.

The slippery-slope argument is fallacious when there's a good reason to think that one action will inevitably lead to an undesirable outcome. This is because such an argument assumes a chain reaction that isn't necessarily inevitable. 

Answer: A
