Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the sum of all positive integer values of n such that n squared is a factor of 1200. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that if n squared is a factor of 1200, then n squared must divide 1200 without leaving any remainder. So, n² | 1200. That means n² is a divisor of 1200. So, I need to find all such n and then sum them up.

To approach this, I think I should start by factoring 1200 into its prime factors. That usually helps with these kinds of problems. Let me do that.

1200 can be divided by 2 first. 1200 ÷ 2 = 600. Then, 600 ÷ 2 = 300. 300 ÷ 2 = 150. 150 ÷ 2 = 75. Now, 75 can't be divided by 2 anymore. So, I've divided by 2 four times. So, 2⁴ is part of the prime factors.

Next, I'll divide by 3. 75 ÷ 3 = 25. So, that's one 3. Then, 25 ÷ 3 is not possible, so moving on. Now, 25 ÷ 5 = 5. That's one 5. 5 ÷ 5 = 1. So that's two 5s.

So, putting it all together, 1200 factors into 2⁴ × 3¹ × 5². Now, let's denote the prime factors as exponents: 2^4, 3^1, 5^2.

Now, since n² is a factor of 1200, the exponents in the prime factorization of n² must be less than or equal to those in 1200. So, let's think about how that works.

For a number n, if it's written as n = 2^a × 3^b × 5^c, then n² would be 2^(2a) × 3^(2b) × 5^(2c). For n² to divide 1200, which is 2^4 × 3^1 × 5^2, each of these exponents in n² must be ≤ the corresponding exponent in 1200.

So, the constraints are:
- 2a ≤ 4
- 2b ≤ 1
- 2c ≤ 2

Let me solve these inequalities for a, b, and c.

Starting with a: 2a ≤ 4 → a ≤ 2. Since a must be an integer (because exponents in prime factors are whole numbers), a can be 0, 1, or 2.

Next, b: 2b ≤1 → b ≤ 0.5. Since b must be a non-negative integer, the only possible value is b=0.

Now, c: 2c ≤2 → c ≤1. So, c can be 0 or 1.

So, the exponents a, b, c must satisfy a=0,1,2; b=0; c=0 or 1.

Now, let me list all possible combinations of a, b, c.

a can be 0,1,2.
b is fixed at 0.
c can be 0 or 1.

So, the possible n² values are determined by each combination.

Let me list each possible n²:

1. a=0, b=0, c=0: n² = 2^0 *3^0 *5^0 =1. So, n=1.
2. a=0, b=0, c=1: n²=2^0 *3^0 *5^2=25. So, n=5.
3. a=1, b=0, c=0: n²=2^2 *3^0 *5^0=4. So, n=2.
4. a=1, b=0, c=1: n²=2^2 *5^2=4*25=100. So, n=10.
5. a=2, b=0, c=0: n²=2^4 *3^0 *5^0=16. So, n=4.
6. a=2, b=0, c=1: n²=2^4 *5^2=16*25=400. So, n=20.

Wait, but a can also be 1, so let's see. Are there more possibilities? For example, a=1, c=1: n² would be 2^(2*1) *5^(2*1) = 4*25=100, so n=10.

Wait, so all the possible n² values are 1, 4, 25, 100, 16, 400. So the corresponding n values are 1, 2, 5, 10, 4, 20.

Wait, let me check each one to make sure they are factors of 1200.

- 1 is a factor of any number, so yes.
- 1²=1: yes.
- 2²=4: 1200 ÷4=300 → yes.
- 5²=25: 1200 ÷25=48 → yes.
- 10²=100: 1200 ÷100=12 → yes.
- 4²=16: 1200 ÷16=75 → yes.
- 20²=400: 1200 ÷400=3 → yes.

So, all these n² are factors.

Now, the question asks for the sum of all positive integer values of n such that n² is a factor of 1200. So, we need to sum 1,2,5,4,10,20.

Let me add them up: 1 +2 is 3, plus5 is 8, plus4 is 12, plus10 is 22, plus20 is 42.

Wait, that's 42. Looking at the options, option H is 24, option D is 42. So, the sum is 42, which is option D.

Wait, let me double-check the sum:

1 + 2 = 3; 3 +5=8; 8+4=12; 12+10=22; 22+20=42. Yes that's correct.

So, the answer should be 42, which is option D.

The sum of all positive integer values of n is 1 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 42.
