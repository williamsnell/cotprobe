Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about acetic acid and ionization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question has two parts, a) and b), both dealing with the ionization of acetic acid. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, which means it doesn't completely dissociate in water. The ionization constant, Ka, is given as 1.8 × 10^-5.

Starting with part a): Calculate the concentration of H+ ions in a 0.10 molar solution of acetic acid. Okay, so the initial concentration of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is 0.10 M. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely. The dissociation reaction is CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

The expression for the ionization constant is Ka = [H+][CH3COO^-]/[CH3COOH]. Let's denote [H+] as x. So [H+] = x, and [CH3COO^-] is also x because each molecule loses one H+ to give a CH3COO^- ion. The concentration of undissociated CH3COOH is (0.10 - x).

Substituting into the Ka equation: 1.8e-5 = (x^2) / (0.10 - x). Since Ka is small, x is much smaller than 0.10. So I can approximate 0.10 - x ≈ 0.10. Let me check the approximation. The Ka is about 1.8e-5, and 0.10 * 1.8e-5 is about 1.8e-6, which is much smaller than x (if x were about 1e-5). So the approximation should hold.

So the equation simplifies to 1.8e-5 = (x^2)/(0.10). Multiply both sides by 0.10: x^2 = 1.8e-6. Taking square roots, x is sqrt(1.8e-6) ≈ 1.34e-3 M. So H+ concentration is approximately 1.34e-3 M. Looking at the options, part A is 1.4e-3, which is close. Option A's first part is correct, but what about the second part?

Wait, part a) is just the initial solution, so I think that's the answer. But wait, the options have multiple parts. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.4e-3 M for H+ and 1.9e-6 M for acetate? Hmm, but wait, no, acetate comes from both the dissociation and the initial concentration. Oh, wait, no, in part a), the acetate comes from the dissociation, but for part b), the acetate is fixed at 1.0 M.

So moving on to part b): The concentration of acetate ions is increased to 1.0 M by adding sodium acetate. So the solution is 0.10 M acetic acid but with 1.0 M acetate from sodium acetate. Now, the acetate ion is a strong electrolyte and will dissociate completely. So in this solution, the acetate concentration is 1.0 M.

So the new concentration of acetate is 1.0 M, and the concentration of H+ will be determined by the dissociation of acetic acid. Let's write the new setup.

So the equation is: Ka = (x^2)/(0.10 - x), same as before, but now the acetate is 1.0 M. So x^2 = Ka * (0.10 - x). Again, since Ka is small, 0.10 - x ≈ 0.10. Let's see: x^2 ≈ (1.8e-5 * 0.10) = 1.8e-6. So x is sqrt(1.8e-6) ≈ 1.34e-3 M. Now, wait, that's the same as part a) initial approximation. But wait, because acetate is now 1.0 M, so the solution is more acidic.

Wait, but wait, no, because acetic acid is weak, but in this case, the acetate is much stronger. So when you have a situation where the acetate concentration is high enough, the solution becomes more like a solution of a weak acid with a strong conjugate base. So the H+ concentration would increase compared to part a). Because now, the acetate is in excess, so the acid will release more H+.

Wait a minute, but in part a), the acetate comes from the dissociation of acetic acid. In part b), the acetate is fixed at 1.0 M, so the H+ concentration will be determined by the dissociation of acetic acid, but the solution already has some acetate.

Wait, perhaps we can model it more accurately. Let's set up the equation without approximation.

Ka = (x^2) / (0.10 - x) = 1.8e-5.

So, x^2 = 1.8e-5 * (0.10 - x) = 1.8e-6 - 1.8e-5 x.

Then, x^2 + 1.8e-5 x - 1.8e-6 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation: a x^2 + b x + c = 0 where a=1, b=1.8e-5, c= -1.8e-6.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a).

Compute discriminant: (1.8e-5)^2 + 4*1 * 1.8e-6 = (3.24e-10) + (7.2e-6) ≈ 7.2e-6. Because 3.24e-10 is negligible compared to 7.2e-6.

Square root of 7.2e-6 is approximately sqrt(7.2) * 1e-3 = 2.683e-3.

So x = [-1.8e-5 ± 2.683e-3 ] / 2.

We take the positive root since x is positive: ( -1.8e-5 + 2.683e-3 ) / 2 ≈ (2.6712e-3) / 2 ≈ 1.3356e-3 M. So H+ concentration is about 1.34e-3 M.

Looking at the options, let's see which one has H+ around 1.34e-3. Looking at the options, option B is 1.5e-3, option D is 1.2e-3, option H is 1.3e-3. So option H is 1.3e-3.

Wait, but wait, in part b, the acetate concentration is 1.0 M, so the initial approximation that x^2 ≈ 1.8e-6 * 0.10 is 1.8e-7, but when we consider that acetate is 1.0 M, the denominator becomes (0.10 - x) ≈ 0.10, so x is sqrt(1.8e-5 *0.10) = sqrt(1.8e-6) = 1.34e-3. So H+ is approximately 1.34e-3 M. So the first part is approximately 1.34e-3 M.

But let me check the exact value. So the equation is x² = 1.8e-5*(0.10 -x).

Which is x² = 1.8e-6 - 1.8e-5 x.

Bring all terms to left: x² + 1.8e-5 x -1.8e-6 = 0.

We can compute the exact value using quadratic formula. Let me compute it more accurately.

Quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

Wait, wait, the equation is x² + (1.8e-5)x -1.8e-6 = 0.

So a = 1, b = 1.8e-5, c = -1.8e-6.

Discriminant D = b² + 4 a c = (1.8e-5)^2 + 4*1*(-1.8e-6) = 3.24e-10 - 7.2e-6 ≈ -7.19676e-6.

Wait, that's negative, which can't be right. Did I make a mistake in signs?

Wait, the equation is x² + 1.8e-5 x -1.8e-6 = 0.

So D = (1.8e-5)^2 + 4*(1)*(1.8e-6) = 3.24e-10 + 7.2e-6 ≈ 7.2000324e-6.

So sqrt(D) is sqrt(7.2000324e-6) = approx 2.68328e-3.

So x = [ -1.8e-5 + 2.68328e-3 ] / 2.

= [ 2.68328e-3 - 0.00018 ] / 2.

Wait, wait, 1.8e-5 is 0.000018, so 2.68328e-3 is 0.00268328.

Subtract 0.000018: 0.00268328 - 0.000018 = 0.00266528.

Divide by 2: 0.00133264 M. So x ≈ 1.33264e-3 M. Approximately 1.33e-3 M. Which is about 1.33e-3, which is 1.34e-3. Looking at the options, option H is 1.3e-3, option D is 1.2e-3, option B is 1.5e-3.

Wait, but 1.3e-3 isn't an option. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options again:

Option H: 1.3e-3 M; 1.8e-6 M.

Wait, but the acetate in part b is 1.0 M. So acetate doesn't affect the H+ calculation because it's a strong acid; the H+ comes from acetic acid.

Wait, but wait, let me calculate H+ accurately.

So the exact x is 1.33264e-3 M. So about 1.33e-3. Looking at the options, none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait. Let me check the initial ionization calculation again.

In part a, the initial solution is 0.10 M acetic acid. The H+ comes from the dissociation. The Ka equation is correct.

In part a, x^2 / (0.10 - x) = 1.8e-5.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.10, x^2 ≈ 1.8e-6, so x = sqrt(1.8e-6) ≈ 1.34e-3 M. So part a's H+ is 1.34e-3 M.

But looking at the options, option H is 1.3e-3 M. Option D is 1.2e-3. Option B is 1.5e-3.

So the correct H+ in part a is about 1.34e-3 M. So the first part of option H is 1.3e-3, which is close, but the second part is 1.8e-6. Wait, but in part a) the acetate is zero, so part a) H+ = 1.34e-3, and acetate is zero. So part a) would be H+ ≈ 1.34e-3 M and acetate ≈ 0 M. So looking at the options, the first part in option H is 1.3e-3, which is close.

But wait, the options are part a) and part b). So part a) is 1.34e-3, which is closest to option H (1.3e-3). But the acetate is zero, and the second part is 1.8e-6 in option H.

Wait, but part b) has acetate at 1.0 M. So in part b), acetate is 1.0 M, so the H+ is determined by the dissociation of acetic acid.

Wait, but let me re-calculate the exact value of x for part b.

Another approach: the solution is 0.10 M acetic acid (CH3COOH) and 1.0 M acetate (CH3COO^-).

So the solution is a mix of a weak acid and its conjugate base. The pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Here, pKa is -log(1.8e-5) = 4.7447 approx.

[A^-] is 1.0 M, [HA] is 0.10 M.

So pH = 4.7447 + log(10) = 4.7447 + 1 = 5.7447. Therefore, [H+] is 10^-5.7447 ≈ 1.78e-6 M.

Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see any option with 1.78e-6. The closest option is option A, which has 1.9e-6. Or wait, let's look at all the options.

The options are:

A: 1.4 × 10^-3 M; 1.9 × 10^-6 M

So H+ is 1.9e-6 in option A.

Wait, but according to my calculation using Henderson-Hasselbalch, [H+] is about 1.78e-6 M, which is close to 1.8e-6. Option A's H+ is 1.9e-6. Could that be correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Henderson approach. Let me double-check.

Wait, the acetic acid is 0.10 M, and the acetate is 1.0 M. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 1.0 / 0.10 = 10.

pH = pKa + log(10) = 4.7447 + 1 = 5.7447. So [H+] is 10^-5.7447 = approximately 1.8e-6 M.

So the H+ is around 1.8e-6 M. Looking at the options, option A has 1.9e-6 M. But wait, why is option A's first part 1.4e-3 and second 1.9e-6?

Wait, but in part a) the H+ is about 1.3e-3, and in part b) it's about 1.8e-6. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier calculations.

Wait, let me re-calculate part a) more accurately.

In part a), the equation is 1.8e-5 = (x^2)/(0.10 -x).

Assuming x << 0.10, so x^2 = 1.8e-5 * 0.10 = 1.8e-6.

x = sqrt(1.8e-6) = approx 1.3416e-3 M.

So x = 1.3416e-3 M. So H+ is 1.34e-3 M, which is approximately 1.34e-3. Looking at the options, option H is 1.3e-3. So that’s the closest.

But wait, the options for part a) are:

A:1.4e-3 M; 1.9e-6 M

B:1.5e-3 M; 2.0e-6 M

C:1.1e-3 M; 1.6e-6 M

D:1.2e-3 M; 1.7e-6 M

E:1.7e-3 M; 2.2e-6 M

F:0.8e-3 M; 1.3e-6 M

G:1.0e-3 M; 1.5e-6 M

H:1.3e-3 M; 1.8e-6 M

I:1.6e-3 M; 2.1e-6 M

J:0.9e-3 M; 1.4e-6 M

So the correct first part for part a) is 1.34e-3, which is closest to option H's 1.3e-3.

But wait, the second part in part a) is 1.8e-6 M, which is option H's second part.

Wait, but the question part a) and part b) are separate. So for part a, the H+ is 1.3e-3, acetate is 0.

But the options don't have an option with H+ 1.3e-3 and acetate 0. So perhaps I made a mistake in part a) calculation.

Wait, another approach. Let's write the exact equation.

Ka = (x^2)/(0.10 - x) = 1.8e-5.

Multiply both sides by (0.10 -x):

x² = 1.8e-5 (0.10 -x) = 1.8e-6 - 1.8e-5 x.

Bring all terms to one side:

x² + 1.8e-5 x - 1.8e-6 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [ -1.8e-5 ± sqrt( (1.8e-5)^2 + 4*1e0 *1.8e-6 ) ] / 2.

Compute discriminant:

(1.8e-5)^2 = 3.24e-10.

4 * 1 * 1.8e-6 = 7.2e-6.

Discriminant is 3.24e-10 + 7.2e-6 = 7.2000324e-6.

Square root of 7.2000324e-6 is approximately 2.68328e-3.

So x = [ -1.8e-5 + 2.68328e-3 ] / 2.

Calculating numerator:

2.68328e-3 - 0.00018 = 2.68328e-3 - 1.8e-5 = approx 2.66528e-3.

Wait, 2.68328e-3 minus 0.00018 is 2.66528e-3? Let me compute 2.68328e-3 = 0.00268328.

Subtract 0.00018: 0.00268328 - 0.00018 = 0.00250328.

Wait, that's 0.00250328, which is 2.50328e-3.

So x = 2.50328e-3 / 2 = 1.25164e-3 M. So approximately 1.25e-3 M.

Wait, this is different from the earlier approximation. So perhaps the exact solution gives x ≈ 1.25e-3 M.

Hmm, so in part a), the H+ is approximately 1.25e-3 M.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.2e-3.

Option H is 1.3e-3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approximation. Let me think again.

So, in part a, initial approximation was x ≈ sqrt(1.8e-5 * 0.10) = sqrt(1.8e-6) = 1.34e-3. But when I solved the quadratic equation, it came out to 1.25e-3.

Wait, let me check the quadratic calculation again.

Equation: x² + 1.8e-5 x - 1.8e-6 = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -1.8e-5 + sqrt( (1.8e-5)^2 + 4*1.8e-6 ) ] / 2.

Compute the discriminant:

(1.8e-5)^2 = 3.24e-10.

4 * 1.8e-6 = 7.2e-6.

So discriminant is 7.2e-6 + 3.24e-10 = 7.2000324e-6.

Square root is sqrt(7.2000324e-6) = 2.68328e-3.

So x = [ -0.000018 + 0.00268328 ] / 2 = (0.00266528) / 2 = 0.00133264 M.

So x ≈ 1.33e-3 M.

Which is closer to option H (1.3e-3) or option D (1.2e-3).

Wait, but earlier when I used the quadratic formula, I think it was correct. So the solution is approximately 1.3e-3 M.

So in part a), H+ is about 1.3e-3 M, and acetate is 0.

Looking at the options, the first part of option H is 1.3e-3, and the second part is 1.8e-6 M.

But in part a), acetate is 0, so the second part is 0. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I need to reevaluate. Let me get back to part a.

Alternative approach: Assume x is the [H+] from acetic acid, then the [CH3COO^-] is 0.10 M (from the initial acetic acid) + x (from dissociation).

Wait, no, the acetate comes from the dissociation of acetic acid. So for part a), the solution is 0.10 M acetic acid and 0 M acetate, but as the solution is made, the acetate comes from the dissociation, which we've considered.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it differently. Let me assume that part a) is 1.3e-3 M H+.

Looking at the options, option H's first part is 1.3e-3. So let's see if that's correct.

But according to the Henderson equation, part a) gives pH of approximately 5.7447, so H+ is 1.78e-6 M.

But that's not matching any options. So perhaps the correct answer is option H: 1.3e-3 M; 1.8e-6 M. Because using the quadratic approach, the H+ is about 1.3e-3, and the acetate is 1.0 M.

Wait, but according to the quadratic formula, the H+ is about 1.3e-3, but in the acetic acid solution, the acetate doesn't affect the H+ because it's the conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option H: H+ is 1.3e-3, and acetate is 1.0 M.

But in part a), the acetate is 0. So maybe the correct answer is option H. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should just look for the closest option. So part a)'s H+ is approximately 1.3e-3, which is option H's first part. The second part in option H is 1.8e-6 M, which is the H+ calculated using the Henderson equation. So perhaps the answer is option H.

But when I calculated the exact solution using the quadratic, I got x = 1.33e-3 M. So perhaps the correct answer is option H.

Alternatively, another approach: looking for the correct H+ in part a) is 1.3e-3 M, and in part b) is 1.8e-6 M. So option H's first part is 1.3e-3, and the second part is 1.8e-6. So that would match.

But wait, in part a) the acetate is zero, so the H+ is 1.3e-3 M. So the correct answer is option H. Because in that case, the first part is 1.3e-3, and the second part is 1.8e-6.

But according to the quadratic formula, the H+ was 1.33e-3, which is closer to option H's 1.3e-3. So perhaps the answer is option H.

So, putting it all together:

a) H+ is approximately 1.3e-3 M, acetate is 0.

b) H+ is approximately 1.8e-6 M, acetate is 1.0 M.

But in the options, the only option that has a H+ of 1.8e-6 M is option A. But that's the second part, but the first part in option A is 1.4e-3, which is close to our calculated 1.3e-3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approximation. Let me try to compute the exact H+ in part a).

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the quadratic formula, which gives x = 1.33e-3 M.

So, in part a), H+ is approximately 1.33e-3 M, and acetate is 0.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option H, which has first part 1.3e-3 and second part 1.8e-6.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. I think the correct answer would be option H, but let me check if the other options are possible.

Wait, another way: in part a), the H+ is 1.3e-3, acetate is 0. So in the options, the correct H+ is 1.3e-3, which is option H.

But the second part in option H is 1.8e-6, which is the H+ when acetate is 1.0 M.

So perhaps the correct answer is option H, but I'm not sure why the acetate is 0 in part a). Because acetate is a conjugate base, its presence affects the H+ concentration, but in this case, perhaps it's negligible because the solution is mostly acetic acid.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option H.
</think>

The ionization constant for acetic acid is given as \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \). The problem involves calculating the concentration of \( \mathrm{H^+} \) ions in two scenarios: one where the solution is 0.10 M in acetic acid (part a), and another where the solution is 0.10 M in acetic acid and 1.0 M in acetate (part b). Additionally, the second part of the question asks for the \( \mathrm{H^+} \) ion concentration when acetate is 1.0 M.

---

### Part a) \( 0.10 \, \mathrm{M} \, \mathrm{acetic acid} \), \( \mathrm{acetate} = 0 \)

The dissociation of acetic acid is represented by:

\[
\mathrm{CH_3COOH} \leftrightharpoons \mathrm{H^+} + \mathrm{CH_3COO^-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_a = \frac{[\mathrm{H^+}]^2}{[\mathrm{CH_3COOH}]}
\]

Assuming \( [\mathrm{H^+}] = x \), then:

\[
[\mathrm{CH_3COO^-}] = 0.10 \, \mathrm{M}, \quad [\mathrm{CH_3COOH}] = 0.10 \, \mathrm{M}
\]

\[
K_a = \frac{x^2}{0.10}
\]

\[
x^2 = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \times 0.10 = 1.8 \times 10^{-6}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.8 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 1.34 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{M}
\]

Thus, \( [\mathrm{H^+}] \approx 1.34 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{M} \).

---

### Part b) \( 0.10 \, \mathrm{M} \, \mathrm{acetic acid} \), \( \mathrm{acetate} = 1.0 \, \mathrm{M} \)

In this case, the solution contains both acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate). The total concentration of \( \mathrm{HA} \) and \( \mathrm{A^-} \) is \( 0.10 + 1.0 = 1.10 \, \mathrm{M} \). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\mathrm{pH} = \mathrm{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\mathrm{A^-}]}{[\mathrm{HA}]} \right)
\]

\[
\mathrm{p}K_a = -\log(1.8 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.74
\]

\[
\log \left( \frac{1.0}{0.10} \right) = \log(10) = 1
\]

\[
\mathrm{pH} = 4.74 + 1 = 5.74
\]

\[
[\mathrm{H^+}] = 10^{-5.74} \approx 1.8 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{M}
\]

Thus, \( [\mathrm{H^+}] \approx 1.8 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{M} \).

---

### Final Answer

- **Part a)** \( [\mathrm{H^+}] \approx 1.34 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{M} \), \( [\mathrm{acetate}] = 0 \, \mathrm{M} \)
- **Part b)** \( [\mathrm{H^+}] \approx 1.8 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{M} \), \( [\mathrm{acetate}] = 1.0 \, \mathrm{M} \)

---

### Matching with Options

The closest match to the calculated values is:

- **Option H**: \( [\mathrm{H^+}] = 1.3 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{M} \), \( [\mathrm{acetate}] = 1.0 \, \mathrm{M} \)

---

ANSWER: H
