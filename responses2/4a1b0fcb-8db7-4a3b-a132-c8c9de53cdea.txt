Alright, so I've got this question about developmental psychologists and the primary research methods they use. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, first, I need to remember what developmental psychologists do. They study how people develop, growth, and change over time. So their work probably involves looking at how individuals progress from one stage to another, maybe looking at factors that influence that process.

Now, let's look at the options. The question is asking which method is primarily used. The options are A to J, with some being less common or more general.

Option A: Psychoanalysis. That's more about exploring unconscious mind processes, like in psychology, and I don't think that's the main method for developmental studies. They might use it for deeper insights, but I don't recall it being the primary method for developmental psychologists.

Option B: Self-report inventories. These are questionnaires where participants report their own experiences. I'm not sure how relevant that is to developmental research. It could be used in some areas, but I think it's more common in other fields like psychology or education.

Option C: Longitudinal research. That's when you collect data from the same individuals over a period of time. This makes sense for developmental studies because you can track how someone's development changes as they age. It's done over time, right? So longitudinal might be the primary method here.

Option D: Naturalistic observation. That's observing without intervention, which looks more like field research. It's used a lot, but I don't think it's the primary method for developmental psychologists. They probably use more structured approaches.

Option E: Experimental method. This involves manipulating variables to see effects. While experiments are used in many areas, I'm not sure if that's the main approach for developmental psychologists. Maybe they do experiments, but I think the primary method is more about observing rather than actively changing variables.

Option F: Experimentation. Hmm, this seems a bit vague. I think it's a part of the experimental method, but not the primary one.

Option G: Correlational research. That's about finding relationships between variables, but it's not an experimental approach. So probably not the primary method.

Option H: Survey research. Surveys are another form of correlational research, asking people about their experiences, etc. Not primary.

Option I: Cross-sectional research. This is when you collect data from different groups at the same time. It's more about comparing different populations, not tracking changes over time. So I don't think it's the primary method for developmental studies.

Option J: Case study. This involves in-depth analysis of a particular individual or group. It's a qualitative approach and might be used in developmental research, but I don't think it's the primary method. They might use case studies, but it's not the main way they conduct their research.

So going back, the primary method would be longitudinal research because it's all about tracking changes over time. That makes sense. So the answer would be option C.

The primary research method used by developmental psychologists is longitudinal research, as it involves collecting data over time to track changes in development.

Answer: C
