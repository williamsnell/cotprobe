Question:

A man allowed his friend to borrow a debit card to buy a computer. When the friend refused to return the card during a later conversation in a bar, the man pointed a handgun at the friend, held his finger on the trigger, and said, "Give it back!" A bystander screamed and threw a beer bottle at the man. The bottle struck the man's hand and caused the gun to discharge, killing the friend instantly. The man was convicted of murder in a jurisdiction that follows the common law of homicide. On appeal, he argues that the evidence, which essentially set out the facts above, was insufficient to support a verdict of murder. Should the man's conviction be reversed?

Options:

A: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of intentional murder.
B: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of depraved-heart murder.
C: Yes, because the evidence showed that the discharge of the gun was accidental.
D: Yes, because the man was acting in self-defense after being attacked by the bystander.
E: Yes, because the evidence showed that the man was provoked by his friend's refusal to return the debit card.
F: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of premeditated murder.
G: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of felony murder.
H: Yes, because the evidence showed that the man did not intentionally pull the trigger.
I: Yes, because the evidence showed that the man's intent was not to kill the friend, but to take property from him under a claim of right.

Okay, so I have this legal question in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question involves a murder conviction and an appeal. The facts are a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the scenario is that a man allows his friend to borrow a debit card to buy a computer. The friend refuses to return it later in a bar. Then, the man points a gun, points the trigger, and says "Give it back!" The friend dies instantly when the gun discharges after being hit by a beer bottle from a bystander. The man was convicted of murder, and on appeal, he's arguing that the evidence isn't enough to prove murder. The options are from A to H, each suggesting a different verdict, some based on different murder categories.

Wait, let me recall the common law of homicide. Under the common law, murder is usually defined as a killing that is intended to kill and is a cause of death. But the main elements of murder are usually intent to kill, the act of killing, and a reasonable belief that the defendant was in the immediate vicinity of the killing. But there are exceptions. For example, self-defense murder (where the defendant is injured by an attacker with no reasonable alternative to avoid the harm) and certain intentional crimes like murder by force might not fit under the common law.

In this case, the bullet is fired by the man, which could be considered intentional if he intended to kill. But the key point is whether the act was intentional or not. The bystander was throwing a beer bottle at the man, which hit him. So, the friend's death was due to the gun firing upon the man, perhaps because he was in immediate vicinity.

Wait, but the evidence given is that the gun was pointed and the trigger was pulled. So the gun is under the man's immediate vicinity. So the discharge would be accidental, if the trigger was pulled without intending to kill. But in the common law, the murder must be with intent to kill. Oh, unless it's self-defense murder, but that's when the person isn't actually intending to kill.

Wait, let me think again. The facts are that the man pointed a handgun at the friend, held the trigger, and said "Give it back!" So, is that intentional? He was pointing it, but the question is whether he intended to kill. The bystander hit the man with a beer, so that's an accident. So, the gun fired because of the friend's refusal. But was the man acting in self-defense? Because after the friend refused the debit card, the man is now in a position of mutual threat, which would mean self-defense.

Oh! So the defense is probably arguing that the man's action was self-defense. Because he's the one who's in immediate danger from the friend refusing the card. So the act of pointing the gun and saying "give it back" was an attempt to stop the friend, which could be self-defense.

But wait, in the common law, self-defense murder requires the defendant to have acted with the intent to defend against a threat of actual imminent serious bodily harm or to prevent such harm, and that the defendant was reasonably in the immediate vicinity of the act. So, if the bystander is a threat, and the man is the one in immediate danger, then pointing the gun and saying "give it back" is self-defense murder.

Alternatively, there's the concept of provocation. The bystander's act of throwing the bottle provokes the man's immediate attention, leading him to act. So, if the bystander's action caused provocation, then self-defense murder applies.

So, the man's actions were provoking a threat, which would make it self-defense murder. But wait, the options given include F: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of premeditated murder. Wait, but that's if the man was intended to carry out the act with intent to cause a specific type of murder.

Wait, in the scenario, the man's actions are intended to stop the friend, so it's self-defense. So the verdict should be self-defense murder. So the man's actions are self-defense, which is a separate category from the standard murder.

So, the defense is suggesting that the evidence wasn't enough to support murder. But under the common law, when the defendant is in immediate danger from a threat, the killing is self-defense murder, which is a separate category.

Looking at the options, option F is "No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of premeditated murder." Hmm, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, option A says "No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of intentional murder." That doesn't make sense, because the only way to have intentional murder is if he intended to kill. But the options don't make that clear.

Wait, the options: Let me read them again.

Option A: The evidence was sufficient for intentional murder.

Option B: Depraved-heart. Maybe that's self-defense.

Option C: Accidental. If the trigger was pulled without intent, then it's accidental, but that would not be murder.

Option D: So the man was acting in self-defense. So the death is self-defense murder.

Option E: provoked by refusal. That's self-defense.

Option F: Premeditated. That would require a specific intent to cause the act, like a specific intent to kill, which isn't the case here.

Option G: felony. That's when the murder was intentional but not with intent to kill.

Option H: Did he intend to kill? No, because the trigger was pulled without intent.

Option I: He didn't intend to kill, so no intent to kill, so not murder.

So the facts don't support murder in the traditional sense because the intent wasn't there. But if the defendant acted with the intent to stop the friend (self-defense), then it's self-defense murder.

So the man's actions were self-defense, so the killing was self-defense murder. Now, the options that support this would be F (premeditated, but that's not the same as self-defense) or perhaps none.

Wait, option F says "No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of premeditated murder." Wait, premeditated murder is when the defendant intended to cause a specific type of killing. But premeditated murder requires a specific intent, not just any intent.

So the facts don't support premeditated murder. Unless the bystander's action caused the victim to die, so perhaps premeditated murder is about the cause of the killing being a specific intent. In this case, the bystander's action was the cause. So perhaps that's self-defense murder, not premeditated.

Wait, another angle: The man's actions were self-defense murder because he was in immediate danger, thus the killing was self-defense. So the options should reflect that. Looking at the options:

Option F: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of premeditated murder. If the man was intending to carry out the killing with a specific intent, but his intent was not clear.

Wait, but the only way that's possible is if he intended to cause the act of stopping the friend. So, perhaps he had a specific intent to stop the friend, which would make it self-defense murder. So, perhaps the option is F, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. The facts: the man pointed the gun, held trigger, and said "give it back." The friend dies because of that. The bystander throwing a beer bottle hit him. So, the man's actions were intended to stop the friend, which could be self-defense.

So, the killing was self-defense murder. So, the correct verdict would be self-defense murder, which is not covered by the options in the way I think. Let me look at the options:

Options A to H.

Option A: Intentional murder (so, he intended to kill). But the evidence is that he pointed the gun but didn't intend to kill. So, no.

Option B: depraved-heart murder. That's self-defense. So, if that's the case, then the answer would be F: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of premeditated murder. Wait, no. Wait, option F is "premeditated." That doesn't fit with self-defense.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the options. Let me read each option again.

Option F: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of premeditated murder.

Wait, premeditated murder requires a specific intent. The evidence doesn't support that; the man's intent was to stop the friend, which is a different intent. So, the correct verdict should not be premeditated.

Wait, perhaps the issue here is that the killing was accidental. The evidence only shows that the trigger was pulled and the gun was pointed, but the intent was to stop the friend, not to kill. So, the killing was accidental, not intentional, so not murder. But that would make the answer either H: Yes, because the man was not guilty of killing. Or perhaps another option.

Wait, the options don't have an 'accidental' verdict. So, perhaps the correct option is F, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, the fact that the bystander was throwing the beer bottle is a provocation, which could be considered a self-defense scenario. So, the killing was self-defense murder.

Looking again, the options F and I both involve types of self-defense. Option F is premeditated, which doesn't fit. Option I is "Yes, because the man's intent was not to kill." But the intent was to stop the friend, which is self-defense. So, I think option I is correct. But wait, option I says "Because the man's intent was not to kill." That's true, but does that make the death self-defense? Yes, because the intent was to stop a threat.

But I think the correct approach is to determine whether the killing was self-defense. Without the option F, perhaps the answer is I.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of the possible options.

Alternatively, the scenario is that the man's action was self-defense murder. So the correct verdict would be self-defense murder, which isn't offered in the options except for option F. But option F is about premeditated, which is not the same. So, perhaps the correct answer is H, because the man's intent was not to kill the friend.

Wait, but the evidence doesn't support that. The man was pointing the gun, but without intent to kill, so he didn't intend to kill.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to structure this.

Under common law, the killing is considered self-defense murder if the defendant was in immediate danger from the act of the bystander. So, the act of the bystander was the trigger being pulled, which caused the friend to be hit. The man was in immediate danger, so the killing is self-defense. Therefore, the correct verdict is self-defense murder, which is not among the options except perhaps F and I.

Option F says premeditated murder, which wouldn't apply. Option I says the intent was not to kill, which is correct because he was pointing the gun without intent.

Wait, but option H is "Yes, because the man's intent was not to kill." So, if the intent was not to kill, then it's not murder, but self-defense. So, the answer would be H, right? Because the defense is arguing that the evidence was insufficient to prove murder.

Alternatively, perhaps the judge would go with self-defense, so the correct verdict is self-defense murder, which isn't covered by any of the options except perhaps F and I. Wait, looking back at the options, option F says "No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of premeditated murder." So, if the killing was self-defense, the correct answer would be F? No, because premeditated is about specific intent. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the main intent was to stop the friend, which is self-defense. So, the correct verdict is self-defense murder, which is not among the options, but according to the choices, option F is the closest.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate each option.

Option A: Intentional murder. The evidence doesn't show intent to kill, only to stop the friend. So, no.

Option B: Depraved-heart murder. That's self-defense. So, if the killing was self-defense, then the verdict would be B. But none of the options say B. So, perhaps I'm wrong.

Option C: Accidental. The evidence doesn't show that. The trigger was pulled, so it's intentional if he intended to kill. But evidence shows that he intended to stop the friend, so it's not accidental.

Option D: Yes, because he acted in self-defense. That's correct, but the option is F, which is a different verdict.

Wait, the options' labels are confusing. Let me read them again.

Option F: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of premeditated murder.

Option I: Yes, because the man's intent was not to kill the friend, but to take property from him under a claim of right.

Wait, is that the case? If the man was acting in self-defense, then the intent was to take the property (the friend's use of the debit card). So, the intent was not to kill. So, the killing was self-defense. Therefore, the correct verdict is self-defense murder, which isn't an option, but the H option says yes because intent wasn't to kill.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H because the intent was not to kill. So, the correct answer is H: Yes, because the intent was not to kill.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The options don't have "self-defense" as a verdict. The closest is H, which says that the intent was not to kill the friend.

So, the answer would be H, yes, because the intent was not to kill. So the man didn't intend to kill the friend, so he was not guilty of murder. Therefore, the conviction should be reversed.

The case revolves around the legal argument that the evidence insufficiently supports a verdict of murder, particularly under the common law of homicide. The facts are that a man allows his friend to borrow a debit card, which he later refuses to return. The man points a gun, pulls the trigger, and claims to "Give it back!" The friend dies when a bystander throws a beer bottle at him. The man was convicted of murder, and the appeal question is whether the evidence is insufficient to support a verdict of murder.

**Key legal principles and analysis:**

1. **Murder under the common law**: Murder is typically defined as a killing that is intentional to kill and is accompanied by reasonable belief of imminent immediate vicinity. However, there are exceptions, such as self-defense murder, where the defendant is in immediate danger from a threat of actual imminent serious bodily harm or to prevent such harm, and the defendant is reasonably in the immediate vicinity of the act.

2. **Evident intent to stop the friend**: The man's actions involve pointing a gun, pulling the trigger, and claiming to "Give it back!" This indicates that he intended to stop the friend, not to kill him. The bystander's actions (throwing a beer bottle) caused the man's immediate attention, leading him to act. This suggests that the killing was self-defense murder, where the defendant acted with the intent to defend against a threat of harm.

3. **Option analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The evidence does not show intent to kill.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. Self-defense murder is not "depraved-heart" but rather the defendant's intent to prevent harm, not to kill.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The action was intentional only if the trigger was pulled with intent to kill, which the evidence does not support.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The man did not act in self-defense, as his intent was to stop the friend.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. Premeditated murder requires a specific intent to cause the act, which is not applicable here.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. While the evidence does not support premeditated murder, the correct verdict is self-defense murder, not premeditated.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The man was guilty of intentional murder if he intended to kill, but the evidence shows he did not intend to kill.
   - **Option H**: Correct. The man acted in self-defense, intending to stop the friend, not to kill. Therefore, the killing was self-defense murder, and the conviction should be reversed.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The man's intent was not to kill the friend; he intended to stop him.

**Conclusion:**
The evidence supports a verdict of self-defense murder because the defendant acted with the intent to stop the friend, which is a distinct category from the traditional murder. Therefore, the conviction should be reversed.
