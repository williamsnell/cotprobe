Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Tunisia's population's perception of their social mix. Let me try to break it down.

The question is asking about the percentage of people from Tunisia who think that having a larger diversity of races, ethnic groups, and nationalities makes their country better. The options are from A to J, with various percentages. The question gives the year as 2018, so I need to find the relevant data from that time.

I'm not super familiar with this exact statistic, so I'll have to think through what I know. I remember that in some countries, people have different opinions on such topics. For example, in France, I think a lot of people consider diversity as a positive factor. Maybe Tunisia is similar.

Wait, but the question is about the last character of the answer, so whatever I choose, it's the last letter of the answer. But I don't know the options yet, so I'll focus on the percentages.

Looking at the options, they're all percentages except maybe the last letters. The options are A to J, and their percentages. Let's list them:

A:70%
B:64%
C:59%
D:24%
E:39%
F:54%
G:45%
H:85%
I:10%
J:69%

So I need to figure out which percentage is correct for 2018 about this topic.

I think I've heard that in some countries, people often see diversity as beneficial. Like, France's 64% might be a commonly cited statistic. But wait, I'm not sure if that's accurate. Maybe it's a different country's percentage.

Another angle: I remember that in some regions, especially in Europe, people are more concerned about social cohesion and less about diversity. But I also think that in some places, diversity is a positive thing.

Wait, I think in Tunisia, the government's stance might influence this. I'm not sure, but I think a significant percentage of people might view diversity as a positive factor.

Let me think about the options again. Option B is 64%, which is close to 60%, a common number I've heard before. But without more information, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, option J is 10%, which seems too low. Maybe that's not the case.

Another thought: sometimes, in some countries, people might not feel the need to count diversity as a positive thing. Or perhaps it's a mix of personal experience and differing opinions.

Wait, I'm trying to think of a source. Oh, I think I've heard that around 64% of French people believe diversity is a positive factor. But I'm not sure if that's from 2018 or later. Also, I think that number might be for a slightly different country.

Alternatively, I've read that in the UK, 75% of the population thinks diversity is important. But that's not one of the options here.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think of the options again. The correct answer is supposed to be one of these percentages.

Looking for the most plausible number, 64% seems high, but if it's from a country that values diversity, it might make sense. Alternatively, 59% is close to 60, which is a common number I've heard before.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is about the percentage of the population, not just those from Tunisia. But the question specifically asks about people from Tunisia, so the percentages are all from Tunisia.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 59%, which is option C, because in some contexts, lower percentages are common because people are more concerned with issues like stability, wealth, and economic concerns rather than diversity.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the options again. If I have to choose between B (64%), C (59%), or F (54%), perhaps 64% is a common figure, but I'm not sure. Another thought: sometimes, more accurate data might be harder to find, so maybe the closest correct number is 64%.

But I'm not certain. Another approach is to think about the frequency of such questions. I think that in the 2018 report by the National Population Commission, the percentage might be around 64%, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I found a source once that reported 64% of French people believe diversity is a positive factor in a country. Since the question is about Tunisia, perhaps the number is similar. So the correct answer would be B:64%.

The correct answer is B:64%. This percentage aligns with the common stance that diversity is viewed as a positive factor in many countries, including France, which is referenced in the context of Tunisia. The reasoning suggests that 64% of French people consider diversity beneficial, which supports the idea that similar views might be prevalent in Tunisia.

Answer: B
