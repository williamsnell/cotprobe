The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A drama guild is renovating an old theater, hoping to use it for 15 years. The guild can follow one of two plans to finance the work: Plan A is to use $5,000 collected from guild members to pay for a renovation job which would be done immediately and would last 15 years. Plan B is to borrow $2,000 the year before the theater opens, and then in the 5th and 10th years of the theater's life to renovate it; each job will last five years. Interest is 6% for both plans. (a) Which plan should the guild follow? (b) If, in Plan B, the 2nd and 3rd renovation jobs will cost $3,000 each and the guild will not be able to borrow the money for any of the three jobs (i.e., the members will have to contribute), which plan should the guild follow?

Options:

A: Plan A, with the $5,000 invested first to grow at 6% interest before renovating
B: Plan B, with renovations every 7 years and borrowing at a lower interest rate
C: Plan A
D: Plan B, with the guild members contributing an additional $1,000 upfront for future renovations
E: Plan A, but with an additional loan taken out in the 10th year
F: Plan A, with a smaller renovation every 5 years using money from fundraising events
G: Plan B
H: Both plans
I: Plan B, with additional renovations every 3 years financed by ticket sales
J: Neither plans

Okay, so I've got this finance question about a drama guild's remodeling plans. Hmm, let me see what it's asking. 

The question has two parts, (a) and (b), and there are options for selecting between Plan A and Plan B. I remember that both plans involve a $2,000 loan, but the timing and structure are different.

Okay, part (a) says Plan A is immediate payment of $5,000 to cover the renovation, done right away, lasting 15 years. Plan B is borrowing $2,000 upfront, and then renovating every 5th and 10th year. Each renovation costs $3,000. Both have a 6% interest rate, and we need to choose which plan is better.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial Plan A is immediate payment of $5k, while Plan B is borrowing $2k upfront. But then, the 5th and 10th years, Plan B's members will contribute. So for Plan B, the first payment would be $2k, then every 5 and 10 years. But in the question (part b), it says the members have to contribute for the second and third years of Plan B. So part (a) must be about comparing the two plans without the second and third years needing contributions.

So for part (a), I think about the present value of both options. The one with lower present value is better because it means less money needed now.

Plan A: Immediate payment of $5,000. Since it's immediate, the present value is just $5k.

Plan B: $2k borrowed now. But then, every 5th and 10th years, another $3k. So the cash flows are: $2k at time 0, then $3k at 5, 10, 15, etc. But wait, no, wait, the loan is $2k, and then the 5th and 10th years, the members contribute $3k each. So total cash flows are $2k at 0, and then $3k at 5, 10, 15, etc.

Wait, but the problem says that the 5th and 10th years, the members contribute each, so the cash flows are $2k at 0, and then $3k at 5 and 10. But wait, the question is about the present value of each plan. So the present value of Plan B is $2k plus the present value of $3k at year 5 and $3k at year 10.

But wait, since the interest rate is 6%, I can calculate each.

So, for Plan A: PV = $5k.

For Plan B: PV = $2k + (3k / (1.06)^5) + (3k / (1.06)^10).

Let me compute that.

First, compute (1.06)^5: 1.06^5 is approximately 1.3382. So 3k /1.3382 ≈ 2.2418k.

Similarly, (1.06)^10 is about 1.7908. So 3k /1.7908 ≈ 1.6763k.

So total PV for Plan B is 2,000 + 2,241.8 + 1,676.3 = 5,918.1.

So Plan A is 5,000. Plan B is approximately 5,918. So Plan A is better because 5k is less than 5,918.

Therefore, the answer for part (a) is Plan A. Looking at the options, option C is "Plan A, with the $5,000 invested first to grow at 6% interest before renovating." Hmm, wait, but that statement is perhaps not necessary because the actual PV is what's compared.

Wait, the options (A-F) are about which plan the guild should choose. So for (a), the correct plan is Plan A because it has a lower PV.

Wait, but the options are not exactly matching that. Option C says Plan A, but it says "invested first to grow at 6% interest before renovating." Hmm. Wait, perhaps that's a distractor. Because what's important is the total cost at time 0. So comparing the present values, which is 5k for Plan A, and 5,918 for Plan B. So Plan A is better.

So the correct answer for part (a) is Plan A, which is option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says Plan A, but that's about the timing. Wait, but the question is about which plan the guild should follow. The present value is the key here. So the plan with lower present value is better. So yes, A is better. So the correct answer for part (a) is option C: Plan A, with the $5,000 invested now.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, option C is Plan A. So the answer would be C.

Now, part (b): In Plan B, the 2nd and 3rd renovations would cost $3,000 each, and the members have to contribute. So the initial plan is borrowing $2k now, but in the 2nd and 3rd years, instead of paying, the members will contribute. So the cash flows for Plan B would be:

Year 0: borrow $2k.

Year 2: contribute $3k instead of paying.

Year 3: contribute $3k instead of paying.

Then, in years 5 and 10, pay $3k as per the original plan.

Wait, no, in this scenario, the second and third years are when the contributions are made. So the cash flows are:

Year 0: -2k (borrowing).

Year 2: -3k (members contribute instead of paying).

Year 3: -3k.

Year 5: -3k.

Year 10: -3k.

So the total present value (PV) of Plan B in this scenario is the PV of all these cash flows.

So we need to compute PV of each payment:

PV = -2k + (-3k)/(1.06)^2 + (-3k)/(1.06)^3 + (-3k)/(1.06)^5 + (-3k)/(1.06)^10.

Wait, but wait, the initial plan is to borrow $2k, then in years 5 and 10 pay $3k each. But in this (b) part, the 2nd and 3rd years (i.e., year 2 and 3) the members contribute instead of paying. So the cash flows are as I listed above.

So let's compute each term.

Year 0: -2k.

Year 2: -3k / (1.06)^2 = 3k / 1.1236 ≈ 2.673k, so negative so -2.673k.

Year 3: -3k / (1.06)^3 = 3k / 1.1910 ≈ 2.541k, so -2.541k.

Year 5: -3k / (1.06)^5 = 3k /1.3382 ≈ 2.241k, so -2.241k.

Year 10: -3k / (1.06)^10 = 3k / 1.7908 ≈ 1.676k, so -1.676k.

So sum all these:

-2k -2.673k -2.541k -2.241k -1.676k.

Adding up: 

-2 - 2.673 = -4.673.

-2.673 -2.541 = -5.214.

-5.214 -2.241 = -7.455.

-7.455 -1.676 = -9.131k.

So total PV is about -9.131k. That's worse than Plan A's PV of $5k.

Wait, that would mean Plan B in this scenario is worse. So the answer would be (a) plan A, (b) plan B is worse, so the correct plan is Plan A. So looking at the options, option C is Plan A.

Wait, but the options are A-F, each a different plan. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: Plan A, $5k invested now.

B: Plan B, every 7 years, lower interest.

C: Plan A, $5k now.

D: Plan B, more loans with lower interest.

E: Plan B, additional loans in 3rd year.

F: Plan A, smaller renovation every 5 years.

G: Both plans.

H: Plan B, other loans.

I: Plan B, additional loan in 10th.

J: Neither.

Wait, the options don't include what I calculated. So in part (a), the correct answer is Plan A (option C) because its PV is lower.

In part (b), the PV of Plan B is -9.131k, which is worse than Plan A's 5k. So the correct plan is Plan A, option C.

So the options for part (b) would be that Plan A is better.

Wait, but the options for the answer are each A to J for the question. So the question is asking, for part (b), which plan should the guild follow? So the answer is Plan A.

Looking at options, option C is Plan A. So the answer would be option C for both parts? Wait no, the question seems to be two parts, but the answer options are a single choice. Wait, no, the question is (a) and (b), but the options are A to J. Wait, no, the answer options A to J are the options for the question. So the question is: which plan should the guild follow? So for part (a), it's Plan A, and for part (b), it's also Plan A.

Wait, but the user's question is a single question with options A-F, each a plan. So perhaps the answer is Plan A, and option C.

Wait, the question is: (a) and (b) are separate questions, but the options A-F are for each. So probably, the correct choice is Plan A, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the numbers.

Wait, in part (b), the question says that in Plan B, the second and third years will cost $3,000 each and the members have to contribute. So the initial plan is to borrow $2k, but in the 2nd and 3rd years, the members contribute instead of paying. So the cash flows are:

At year 0: borrow $2k.

Year 2: contribute $3k instead of paying, so a cash outflow of $3k.

Year 3: same, contribute.

Year 5: pay $3k.

Year 10: pay $3k.

So the PV of Plan B is:

PV = -2k + (-3k)/(1.06)^2 + (-3k)/(1.06)^3 + (-3k)/(1.06)^5 + (-3k)/(1.06)^10.

Wait, I think I did that correctly. The total PV is approximately -9.131k, which is worse than Plan A's 5k.

So Plan A is better.

Therefore, for both (a) and (b), the correct answer is Plan A, which is option C.

Wait, but in part (b), the members contribute in the 2nd and 3rd years, which would make the total cost higher, leading to a higher PV. So in that scenario, the guild's total cost is worse, so they should stick with Plan A.

So, the correct answer would be option C for both parts.

To determine which plan the drama guild should follow, we need to compare the present values (PV) of both plans using a 6% interest rate.

### Part (a): Plan A vs. Plan B (Original Setup)
- **Plan A**: Borrow $5,000 immediately, with the renovation lasting 15 years. The present value (PV) is simply $5,000.
- **Plan B**: Borrow $2,000 now, and renovate every 5th and 10th years. The cash flows are:
  - $2,000 at year 0.
  - $3,000 at year 5.
  - $3,000 at year 10.
- **PV Calculation**:
  - \( PV = \frac{2,000}{(1.06)^0} + \frac{3,000}{(1.06)^5} + \frac{3,000}{(1.06)^{10}} \)
  - \( PV = 2,000 + \frac{3,000}{1.3382} + \frac{3,000}{1.7908} \)
  - \( PV \approx 2,000 + 2,241.8 + 1,676.3 = 5,918.1 \)
- **Conclusion**: The present value of Plan B ($5,918) is higher than Plan A ($5,000), so the guild should follow **Plan A**.

---

### Part (b): Modified Plan B with Contribution in 2nd and 3rd Years
- **Plan B**: Borrow $2,000 now, but contribute $3,000 in the 2nd and 3rd years instead of paying. The cash flows are:
  - $2,000 at year 0.
  - $3,000 at year 2.
  - $3,000 at year 3.
  - $3,000 at year 5.
  - $3,000 at year 10.
- **PV Calculation**:
  - \( PV = \frac{2,000}{(1.06)^0} + \frac{3,000}{(1.06)^2} + \frac{3,000}{(1.06)^3} + \frac{3,000}{(1.06)^5} + \frac{3,000}{(1.06)^{10}} \)
  - \( PV = 2,000 + \frac{3,000}{1.1236} + \frac{3,000}{1.1910} + \frac{3,000}{1.3382} + \frac{3,000}{1.7908} \)
  - \( PV \approx 2,000 - 2,673 - 2,541 - 2,241 - 1,676 = -9,131 \)
- **Conclusion**: The present value of Plan B (-$9,131) is significantly worse than Plan A ($5,000), so the guild should follow **Plan A**.

---

### Final Answer
For both parts (a) and (b), the correct plan is **Plan A**, which corresponds to **Option C**.
