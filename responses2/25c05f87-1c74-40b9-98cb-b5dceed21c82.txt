Okay, so I have this question about networking and data rates. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that two computers are sending data packets across a Local Area Network (LAN). Each packet is 1,000 bytes. The network can carry 1,000 packets per second. The CPU time for each packet to be sent is 10 milliseconds. The question is asking for the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another in bytes per second.

Hmm, let's break it down. So, each packet is 1,000 bytes. The network can handle 1,000 packets per second. That means the data rate is 1,000 packets/s. But each packet is 1,000 bytes, so the total data per second would be 1,000 * 1,000 bytes. Wait, 1,000 * 1,000 is 1,000,000 bytes per second. So that's 1 MB/s. But wait, that's the data rate the network can handle. But the question is about the maximum sending rate, considering the CPU time.

Oh, right! Because sending a packet takes 10 milliseconds. So, the CPU time per packet is 10,000 milliseconds (10 ms = 0.01 seconds). So, the sending rate is limited by the time it takes to send a packet. Let me think: if it takes 10 ms to send one packet, then the rate is 1,000 bytes / 0.01 seconds. Wait, no. Because the network can send 1,000 packets per second, but each packet takes 10 ms to send. So, is the data rate the bottleneck here?

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the throughput. Throughput is data transfer rate. If the network can send 1,000 packets per second, each packet is 1,000 bytes, so 1,000 * 1,000 = 1,000,000 bytes per second. But the time to send each packet is 10 ms. So, the sending rate is 1,000 bytes / 0.01 seconds = 100,000 bytes per second. But that's if you have a bottleneck of sending each packet. However, the network's throughput is also limited by the network's capacity. So, the maximum rate would be the minimum of the network's throughput and the sending rate.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The network can handle 1,000 packets per second. So, 1,000 * 1,000 bytes = 1,000,000 bytes per second. That's the data rate the network can send. But the CPU time for each packet is 10 ms. So, the sending rate would be 1,000 bytes / 0.01 seconds = 100,000 bytes per second. So, the sending rate is 100,000 bytes/s, but the network can only send 1,000,000 bytes/s. So the actual throughput would be the minimum of these two, but since the network can send 1,000,000, and the sending rate is 100,000, the maximum throughput is 100,000 bytes/s.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think in terms of throughput. The network's capacity is 1,000 packets/s. Each packet is 1k bytes. So, data transfer is 1k * 1k = 1Mbs (1,000,000 bytes per second). But the time per packet is 10 ms, so the time to send a packet is 0.01 sec. So the throughput would be data sent (1,000 bytes) / time (0.01 s) = 100,000 bytes per second. But the network can handle sending 1,000,000 bytes/s. So, the maximum rate is the minimum of 1,000,000 and 100,000, which is 100,000.

Wait, but wait another moment. If the network can send 1,000,000 bytes/s, and each packet takes 10 ms to send, how many packets can it send in a second? Let me calculate the number of packets per second the network can send. Since sending each packet takes 0.01 seconds, the number of packets per second is 1 / 0.01 = 100 packets/s. So the data sent is 100 * 1,000 = 100,000 bytes per second.

So the maximum rate one computer can send data to another is 100,000 bytes/s. Looking at the options, option H is 100,000. So the answer should be H.

To determine the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another, we need to consider both the network's capacity and the CPU time required to send one packet. 

Each packet is 1,000 bytes, and the network can carry 1,000 packets per second. Therefore, the data rate the network can handle is:

\[
1,000 \text{ packets/second} \times 1,000 \text{ bytes/packet} = 1,000,000 \text{ bytes/second}.
\]

However, the CPU time to send one packet is 10 milliseconds (0.01 seconds). The sending rate is limited by this time:

\[
\frac{1,000 \text{ bytes}}{0.01 \text{ seconds}} = 100,000 \text{ bytes/second}.
\]

The network's capacity of 1,000,000 bytes per second is higher than the sending rate of 100,000 bytes per second. Therefore, the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another is determined by the sending rate, which is 100,000 bytes per second.
