Okay, let's see. I've got this question about calculating the dollar markup for a stereo system. Hmm, I remember that markup is the amount added to the cost to arrive at the selling price. So, the formula is usually selling price minus cost. Let me think about it.

The stereo system sells for $200, and the cost to the store is $120. So, to find the markup, I subtract the cost from the selling price. That should give me the dollar amount added. Let me do the math: $200 minus $120 equals $80. Okay, so the dollar markup is $80.

Looking at the options, option A is $80.00. So that's the one I think. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up markup and margin. Oh, right, markup is the amount you add to the cost, whereas margin is the percentage of profit. So yes, I did it right. The markup is $80.
