Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. I remember that FDIC is a government insurance company that protects bank deposits. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I'll have to think it through.

The question is asking how the government stood behind banks by forming the FDIC. The options are A to J. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Increasing taxes on banks. I don't think so. I recall that the FDIC is more about insuring deposits rather than regulating banks through taxes.

Option B: Guaranteeing loans made by banks to businesses and individuals. Hmm, that sounds familiar. FDIC was created to protect the deposits of banks, which meant that if a bank made a loan, the FDIC would cover the deposit up to a certain amount. So this seems like the correct answer.

Option C: Capping the interest rates banks can charge. I think FDIC was established to hold onto deposits, but the actual regulation on interest rates was handled by the FDIC, but I'm not sure if it's about capping rates. Or wait, maybe it's about the FDIC insuring the deposits, not the rates themselves. So perhaps this is incorrect.

Option D: Providing financial grants to banks. I don't think FDIC does that. It's more about covering deposits. Financial grants would be individual actions, not a government's insurance.

Option E: Taking over all private banks. No, that doesn't sound right. The FDIC was formed to protect the deposits of existing banks, not to take over others.

Option F: Insuring only the deposits of commercial accounts. I believe FDIC insures the deposits of all banks, not just commercial ones. They cover both non-profits and public utilities.

Option G: Protection of all bank deposits with government insurance. This aligns with what I know about FDIC. They provide insurance up to a certain amount, typically $250,000 per bank, but they cover a wide range of financial institutions, including banks, credit unions, and others.

Option H: Allowing banks to borrow unlimited funds from the government at zero interest. That doesn't sound right. I think FDIC doesn't allow borrowing beyond their insurable limits. The FDIC is more about covering deposits, not granting loans beyond that.

Option I: Offering a one-time bailout fund. I'm not sure. I think the FDIC has had bailouts, but it's not a one-time fund. There have been other financial regulators, like the Federal Reserve, who have done that.

Option J: Investing government funds into bank stocks. That doesn't fit. FDIC is about protecting deposits, not investing government money into the stock market.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be B: By guaranteeing loans made by banks to businesses and individuals. Wait, no, wait. Wait, option B says "guaranteeing loans," but I thought it was about insuring deposits. Oh wait, no, the FDIC's main function is to insure deposits, but it also helps banks with loans. So if you look, the FDIC is a government insurance company that provides protection against the loss of deposits in banks. So it's not solely about guaranteeing loans, but also serving as a financial safety net.

Ah, but I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, the question is about how the government stood behind the banks through the FDIC's formation. So the role was to ensure that banks could not lose their deposits. So the act of the FDIC providing insurance against banks' deposits is the answer.

Wait, but looking back, option G says "by protecting all bank deposits with government insurance." That seems to be the main purpose of the FDIC. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but I thought the FDIC's main function was to provide insurance against the loss of deposited funds. So the act of setting up the FDIC to cover deposits was part of its role. But the question is about what the government did behind the banks through the formation of FDIC. So the answer would be they provided insurance, which is option G.

But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes FDIC's main function is about insuring deposits, but it also helps banks with loans. So option B says "guaranteeing loans made by banks to businesses and individuals." Wait, but the FDIC's primary role was to cover the deposits of banks, not to guarantee loans.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify. The FDIC is a government entity that insures deposits up to a certain amount. It's not the same as guaranteeing loans. So the act of insuring deposits is the main purpose.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G says "by protecting all bank deposits with government insurance." That seems to fit the FDIC's role. So the correct answer is G.

But I'm a bit confused because some sources say that FDIC was created to protect against banks taking on excessive risk, but the main function was to provide insurance against the loss of deposits. So the answer is G.

The correct answer is G: By protecting all bank deposits with government insurance. 

**Explanation:** The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was established to provide insurance against the loss of deposited funds in banks. This included setting up the FDIC to cover deposits up to a certain amount, which is the primary purpose of the FDIC. The other options either pertain to different regulatory functions or do not align with the FDIC's established role in protecting deposits. Therefore, the correct choice is G.
