Question:

What prevents the stomach from being digested by itsown secretions?

Options:

A: A thick layer of fat surrounds the stomach, providing protection from digestive acids.
B: Special bacteria in the stomach neutralize all digestive enzymes.
C: The stomach lining secretes an alkaline substance that counteracts the acid and prevents digestion.
D: The lining of the stomach secretes only hydrochloric acid and gastric juice.
E: The mucus layer, the permeability of the membranes and the continual replacement of the cells comprising the lining all help protect the underlying tissues from the action of proteolytic enzymes of the stomach and duodenum.
F: The stomach is coated with a layer of strong antibiotics that kill digestive enzymes.
G: The stomach lining is replaced every 10 to 15 days.
H: The stomach has a high permeability to hydrogen ions.
I: The stomach has a unique pH that prevents enzymes from being active.
J: Digestive enzymes in the stomach are only activated by food, so they do not attack the stomach lining.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the digestive system, specifically the stomach. Hmm, let me think through this carefully.

The question is asking what prevents the stomach from being digested by its own secretions. The options are A through J, each describing a different mechanism or condition.

First, I remember that the stomach lining is a thick layer, called the mucosa. It's made up of folded cartilage and fibrous connective tissue. Oh wait, I think there's something about the lining's properties that stop certain substances from reaching the inside.

Option A says the fat layer protects against digestion. I'm not sure about that. I remember that fat is a good insulator, but I'm not certain if it's the main factor here. Maybe the lining's structure makes it a barrier.

Option B suggests special bacteria neutralize enzymes. I don't recall that being a main defense mechanism. The lining is more about protection rather than fighting off harmful substances.

Option C talks about the lining secreting an alkaline substance. I think the stomach lining has hydrochloric acid, which is an acid. If it secreted something alkaline, that might neutralize the acids. But I'm not too clear on that. Alternatively, maybe the lining maintains a certain pH that's safe for digestion.

Option D says it secretes only HCl and gastric juice. That doesn't sound right. The lining is well-known for producing HCl and producing stomach juice (which is a mix of HCl and other acids). So D is probably incorrect.

Option E says the lining has high permeability and mucus helps protect. Well, high permeability would allow substances through, but the lining's structure might slow chemical inclusions. Alternatively, mucus layer could trap harmful substances. But I'm not sure if this is the main factor.

Option F mentions antibiotics coating the lining. That doesn't make sense. Starch and other substances are more common.

Option G says lining is replaced every 10-15 days. I don't think the lining is replaced that often. It's more like every year, I think. So G is probably wrong.

Option H says the lining has high permeability to H+ ions. I think the lining is less permeable to hydrogen ions than other substances, which helps maintain the pH. High H+ levels could otherwise act on the lining.

Option I states the lining has a unique pH that stops enzyme activity. Wait, I remember that the stomach lining has a low pH, around 2-3, which is acidic. Enzymes in the stomach are more active in an acidic environment. If the lining maintains such a pH, enzymes can't function because the acidity isn't right. So I is a possible correct answer.

Option J says enzymes are only activated by food. That doesn't sound right. Enzymes are made by food, but the lining's pH plays a role too. So the enzymes can't work without the pH being right.

Wait, looking back at option C: the lining secretes an alkaline substance. I'm recalling that the stomach lining has a layer of hydrochloric acid. If it secreted an alkaline, it might neutralize the acid. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the lining's composition balances the pH, so the acids can't get into the stomach lining.

Another approach: which options are the most plausible. I remember that the stomach lining's acidification is achieved through the production of HCl and the presence of certain substances. The lining's pH is maintained to prevent enzymes from digesting the inside.

So looking at option H: high permeability to H+ ions. Since the lining is inherently acidic, it may have a high permeability to H+ ions. That would mean that the lining can't absorb or let in too much acid, thus preventing enzymes from being active. This would protect the stomach lining from being damaged by the acidic environment.

Alternatively, option I says the lining has a unique pH. That makes sense because without the right pH, the enzymes wouldn't function. So both I and H could be correct.

Another point: option E says the lining has a high permeability to H+ ions. Well, I think the lining is actually not that permeable to H+ ions, but it can't let in too much. So perhaps H is correct.

Wait, option H says high permeability to H+ ions. If that's the case, then the lining can't absorb H+ ions properly, keeping the pH. So in that situation, the enzymes can't get in. That makes sense because without high enough acidity, the enzymes can't function properly.

So now, the options to think about are I and H. Which is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is asking what prevents digestion. So if the lining has a pH that stops enzymes from working (option I), then that's the correct reason. Alternatively, the lining's alkaline secretion (option C) might help, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the main defense is the pH. The lining's pH is such that it's not acidic enough for the enzymes in the stomach to function. So the correct answer would be I.

The question asks what prevents the stomach from being digested by its own secretions. To determine the correct answer, each option is analyzed:

- **Option A**: The fat layer protects against digestion. While fat is a barrier, it is not the primary defense mechanism here.
- **Option B**: Special bacteria neutralize enzymes. This is incorrect as the lining is more about protection than fighting off harmful substances.
- **Option C**: The lining secretes an alkaline substance. This is plausible but not the main defense mechanism.
- **Option D**: The lining secretes only HCl and gastric juice. Incorrect, as the lining produces more than just these substances.
- **Option E**: The lining has high permeability to H+ ions. While this is true, it is not the primary defense.
- **Option F**: The lining is coated with antibiotics. Incorrect, as antibiotics are not a defense mechanism.
- **Option G**: The lining is replaced every 10-15 days. Incorrect, as the lining is replaced more frequently.
- **Option H**: The lining has high permeability to H+ ions. This is correct, as the high permeability helps maintain the pH, preventing enzymes from functioning.
- **Option I**: The lining has a unique pH that prevents enzymes from being active. This is correct, as the pH is crucial for enzyme activity.
- **Option J**: Enzymes are only activated by food. Incorrect, as enzymes are made by food but the pH plays a role.
- **Option K and L**: Not listed, but they can be discarded as irrelevant.

The correct answer is **I**, as the unique pH of the stomach lining prevents enzymes from functioning. While option H also seems plausible, the primary defense mechanism is the pH. However, since both I and H are plausible, the most accurate answer is **I**.
