Okay, so I have this question about economics, specifically about supply shocks and their effects on the Phillips curve. I'm trying to remember what I learned about this. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says: "A negative or contractionary supply shock will" and then gives four options. A negative supply shock, I think, refers to a situation where the supply of goods and services is too low. That usually leads to higher prices and higher unemployment because businesses can't produce as much, so they have to raise prices and lay off workers.

Now, the question is about how this shock affects the Phillips curve. The Phillips curve shows the inverse relationship between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate. It has two main curves: the short-run and the long-run. The short-run Phillips curve is downward sloping, while the long-run is vertical.

A negative supply shock would cause a short-run increase in prices (inflation) and a decrease in unemployment. That's because the economy is responding quickly to the shock. So, the short-run Phillips curve would shift. But what direction?

In the short run, when inflation rises and unemployment falls, the curve shifts to the right. Wait, no. Wait, think about the Phillips curve. On the Phillips curve, a negative shift would mean that at any given level of unemployment, the inflation rate is lower. Or maybe I'm getting this backward.

Wait, the Phillips curve equation is something like π = πe + u - e, where π is actual inflation, πe is expected inflation, u is unemployment, and e is the expected rate of inflation.

A negative supply shock would cause π to increase and u to decrease. So, at the same expected inflation rate, the actual inflation is higher. Let me see: if e is expected to decrease (since people expect lower prices), but the actual π increases.

So, in the short-run Phillips curve, the curve would shift to the right because at the same expected inflation rate, the actual inflation is higher. Or wait, because the actual inflation is higher but the expected is... Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, when the supply shock is negative, the economy is producing less, so people expect higher future prices (inflation). So, people might adjust their expectations. If they thought inflation would be higher, and the actual inflation is too low, that would cause a problem. But perhaps this isn't the right way to think about it.

Alternatively, when the supply shock is negative, the short-run Phillips curve shifts to the right. Because in the short run, when the economy is facing a negative supply shock, the short-run Phillips curve shifts such that higher unemployment is associated with higher inflation. So, the curve moves to the right.

But wait, the options are about what happens to the Phillips curve. The question is about a negative supply shock. So, what happens to the short-run Phillips curve (SRPC) and the long-run Phillips curve (LRPC)?

Wait, the options are:

A: shift the Phillips curve to the left.
B: shift the investment demand curve to the right.
C: shift the money demand curve to the right.
D: shift the Phillips curve to the right.

The options are about what happens to the curves listed. So, the question is about which curve shifts when the supply shock occurs.

Wait, but the question is about the overall effect on the Phillips curve. So, when the supply curve shifts, the SRAS curve shifts, which affects the short-run equilibrium. But the long-run curve is vertical because it's determined by the natural rate of unemployment.

Wait, but the question's options are about the shift of the entire Phillips curve. So, if the supply shock is negative ( contractionary), the short-run equilibrium will have higher inflation and lower unemployment. So, in the SRAS curve, it's shifting left or right? Let me think about the AS-AD model.

Negative supply shock: AD curve would shift left. Because AD is composed of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. If supply is too low ( contractionary), it reduces AD.

AD curves: when AD shifts left, the short-run equilibrium is at lower price level and lower output. So, in the SRAS-AD model, a leftward shift of AD leads to a new equilibrium with lower P and lower Y.

But how does this affect the Phillips curve? The SRAS is moving left, so the equilibrium point shifts to the left in both curves. But the question is about the shift of the Phillips curve itself, not the movement in the curves.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the entire Phillips curve shifts. So, when the supply curve shifts, the SRAS curve shifts, which affects the short-run equilibrium and hence the Phillips curve. The long-run curve is fixed, but the SRPC shifts.

Wait, but the options are about which curve shifts. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The short-run Phillips curve is affected by the AD and AS curves. When AD shifts left, price level decreases, output decreases.

But the SRAS curve (which is the short-run supply curve) also shifts. So, the SRAS curve shifts to the left. That causes the short-run equilibrium to have lower P and lower Y. So, the short-run Phillips curve (SR) would shift. But the question isn't about the SRAS; it's about the overall shift of the entire Phillips curve.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about whether the SRAS itself shifts, which affects the SRPC. But the long-run Phillips curve remains vertical because it's determined by the natural rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall shift in the SRPC depends on whether the shock is positive or negative. A negative supply shock would cause the SRAS to shift left, which would lead the short-run equilibrium to have lower unemployment (right shift in SRPC)? Or left?

Wait, the SRPC is π = some function of u. If the SRAS shifts left, the short-run equilibrium's u would increase (since at lower P, lower LRAS shifts), so the SRPC would shift to the right.

Wait, let's think of the SRPC: when AS shifts left, the short-run equilibrium's P and u would both be lower. Because AD is going down and AS is going down, leading to lower P and lower Y. So, for the SRPC, which is π = something with u, when P decreases, the intercept (assuming some slope) would move. But perhaps the shift of the entire SRPC depends on the magnitude of the shift.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is: when the AS curve shifts left (contractionary supply shock), the SRAS shifts left. The SRAS determines the current P and u. So the SRPC would shift to the right.

Wait, no, because the SRPC is the relationship between π and u in the short run. If the SRAS shifts left, then the short-run equilibrium u would increase. So, for the SRPC, the intercept (the value of π when u is natural rate) would decrease. Because in the short run, the equilibrium is at a lower u, but the natural rate (LRAS) is determined by the long-run AS. So, the SRPC shifts to the right because the natural rate is still at the same point, but the actual u would be higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options now.

The options are about the shift of the curve—does it shift left or right. The question is, what happens when a negative supply shock occurs.

I remember that a negative supply shock (contractionary) leads to higher inflation and lower unemployment in the short run. So, in the SRAS-AD model, the equilibrium shifts to the left because AD is shifting left, AS is shifting left as well. So, the SRAS curve shifts left, leading to a lower P and lower Y.

Looking at the SRPC, which is π = πe + u - e. After the shock, in the SRAS, e is expected to increase because people expect higher prices (inflation) in the future. Wait, no, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the SRPC is affected by the short-run equilibrium. When the AS curve shifts left, the SRAS also shifts left. The SRPC is the short-run curve. So, the SRPC would shift to the right because at each expected inflation rate, the actual inflation is higher, leading to a higher u.

Wait, no, when AD shifts left, the SRAS shifts left, leading to lower P and lower Y. So, in the SRPC, at a given u, P is lower. So, for all u, the SRPC would shift to the right.

Wait, no, think about the equation π = πe + u - e. When AS shifts left, the SRAS is lower. So, at the same expected πe, the actual π would be higher (since lower AS means lower P). So, for the same πe, the actual π is higher. So, at each u, the π is higher. So, the SRPC shifts to the right because the intercept increases (πe + u - e is higher for the same u).

So, the SRPC would shift to the right.

Wait, but some sources say that a negative supply shock shifts the SRAS left, and hence the SRPC shifts to the right. Because in the SRPC, the intercept (πe + u - e) would be higher, leading to higher π for the same u.

So, in this question, the options are about whether the shift is left or right. The correct answer would be that the SRPC shifts to the right.

Looking back to the options, option D says shift the Phillips curve to the right. So, the correct answer is D.

A negative or contractionary supply shock refers to a situation where the supply of goods and services becomes too low, leading to higher prices (inflation) and lower unemployment in the short run. This type of shock shifts the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve to the left. As a result, the short-run equilibrium shifts to the left, with lower prices and lower unemployment.

The Phillips curve, which shows the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment, also shifts in the short run. The short-run Phillips curve (SRPC) is determined by the interaction of AD and AS. When AD shifts left due to a negative supply shock, the SRAS also shifts left, leading to a new equilibrium where the SRPC shifts to the right. This is because, at any given level of unemployment, the actual inflation rate is higher, causing the intercept of the SRPC to increase.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Shift the Phillips curve to the left.** Incorrect. A contractionary supply shock leads to lower prices and higher unemployment in the short run, causing the SRPC to shift to the right, not the left.
- **B: Shift the investment demand curve to the right.** Incorrect. This is unrelated to the short-run Phillips curve or the investment demand curve.
- **C: Shift the money demand curve to the right.** Incorrect. This is unrelated to the short-run Phillips curve or the money demand curve.
- **D: Shift the Phillips curve to the right.** Correct. A negative supply shock causes the SRPC to shift to the right, reflecting the higher inflation rates associated with lower unemployment.

Thus, the correct answer is that the Phillips curve shifts to the right due to a negative supply shock.
