Okay, so I've got this question here about a student with three puzzles, and each has 1,250 pieces. The question is asking for the total number of pieces across all three puzzles. Let's think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. The student has three puzzles, each with a certain number of pieces. I need to add up all the pieces from each puzzle to find the total. So, it's a simple multiplication problem, right? Because if each puzzle has 1,250 pieces and there are three, I multiply 1,250 by 3.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes when I'm adding or multiplying, I can accidentally add or multiply the wrong numbers. So, let's break it down. Each puzzle has 1,250 pieces. So:

Puzzle 1: 1,250 pieces  
Puzzle 2: 1,250 pieces  
Puzzle 3: 1,250 pieces  

Adding them together: 1,250 + 1,250 = 2,500. Then add another 1,250. So 2,500 + 1,250 = 3,750. Alternatively, I could think of it as 1,250 multiplied by 3. Let me calculate that. 1,250 * 3: 1,000 * 3 is 3,000, 250 *3 is 750. So 3,000 +750 =3,750. That matches what I got earlier.

Looking at the options, option C is 3,750, which is the result I got. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but I should check all the options to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me list them again:

A: 3,250  
B: 5,000  
C: 3,750  
D: 4,000  
E: 4,250  
F: 2,500  
G: 3,650  
H: 4,750  
I: 4,650  
J: 3,500  

So, yes, option C is 3,750, which aligns with my calculation. I don't see any other options that match 3,750. Therefore, the correct answer must be C.

The total number of pieces is 3 times 1,250, which equals 3,750. The correct answer is C.

Answer: C: 3,750
