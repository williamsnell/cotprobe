Question:

Which single statement about fat digestion and absorption is correct?


Options:

A: After absorption, both medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and long chain triglycerides enter the lymphatic system.
B: The products of complete digestion of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this decreases absorption
C: Absorption of fatty acids in the intestine occurs mainly through FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum
D: Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) must be emulsified and digested before the fatty acids can be transported
E: After absorption, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) enter the lymphatic system, whereas long chain triglycerides enter the portal blood system.
F: Absorption of fatty acids in the intestine occurs primarily through the FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins in the proximal duodenum
G: Absorption of fatty acids in the intestine occurs mainly through FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins in the enterocytes of the mid jejunum.
H: The products of partial digestion of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this increases absorption
I: After absorption, long chain triglycerides (LCT) enter the lymphatic system, whereas medium chain triglycerides enter the portal blood system.
J: Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can be directly transported without being emulsified and digested

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about fat digestion and absorption. I'm a bit rusty on my nutrition, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question asks which statement is correct. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A: After absorption, both MCT and LCT enter the lymphatic system. Hmm. I remember that MCT (medium chain) and LCT (long chain) are different. MCT enters the lymphatic system, but I think LCT doesn't. So A is probably wrong because only MCT enters lymphatic.

Option B: Products of complete digestion form micelles with cholesterol and phospholipids, decreasing absorption. Wait, that sounds familiar. I think when triglycerides are digested completely, they form mixed micelles which reduce absorption because they can't be absorbed. But I'm not sure if this statement is correct. Or does B say something else? Let me check again. The statement says the products can form micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids, and this decreases absorption. I'm pretty sure that's correct because complete digestion leads to this effect. So B might be the correct answer, but I'll hold off on that for a moment.

Option C: Absorption occurs via FABP and FAT/CD36 in enterocytes of the distal duodenum. I thought that FABP and CD36 are primarily involved in the proximal duodenum (like in the first part of the duodenum). The distal duodenum uses other transport factors like FOLDA. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: Triglycerides must be emulsified and digested before fatty acids are transported. Wait, I don't think triglycerides are digested. Fats are broken down in the stomach, but triglycerides are stored in the small intestine. So D is incorrect because triglycerides aren't digested here. So D is wrong.

Option E: MCT enters lymph, LCT enters portal. No, LCT doesn't enter portal. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Absorption primarily occurs in the proximal duodenum with FABP and CD36. I remember that in the proximal duodenum, the transport factors are FABP and CD36. So F is correct? But wait, what about other parts? Maybe F is correct because FABP is the main one in that area. Alternatively, could other factors be involved? But F says primarily, so I think F is correct.

Option G: Absorption in the mid jejunum. The mid jejunum is where some factors are active. But wait, I think that's not where most absorption occurs. Mid jejunum is after the duodenum and before the jejunum, but the transport here is also done by FABP. So, G's statement might not be correct.

Option H: Partial digestion products form micelles with cholesterol and decrease absorption. Partial digestion would mean they're not fully digested, so mixed micelles would form. That's correct because partial digestion (like after chewing) actually increases absorption because the molecule is more soluble. So H is correct.

Option I: LCT enters lymph, MCT portal. No, MCT goes into lymph, LCT doesn't. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Triglycerides can be transported directly without emulsifying and digesting. I don't think triglycerides are digested in the small intestine. So J is wrong.

Wait, let me go back. So the options that I'm considering now are B, F, H.

Option B's statement says that after complete digestion, the products form micelles with cholesterol and phospholipids, which decreases absorption. I think that's correct because complete digestion leads to mixed micelles, which reduce the ability to absorb.

Option F says that absorption occurs primarily in the proximal duodenum with FABP and CD36. That's correct as well, because FABP is involved in that area.

Option H says that the products of partial digestion form micelles, which increases absorption. Partial digestion (like after chewing) would have more triglycerides, more breakdown, which could lead to more absorption. So H is correct.

Now I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The question asks which is correct. So I need to find the correct statement.

Wait, all options except J and others might be incorrect. Let's think about each.

Option B: Because when you digest completely, you get mixed micelles, which reduce absorption. I think that's correct because complete digestion leads to increased lipoprotein formation, which reduces absorption.

Option F: The statement says that the absorption occurs primarily in the proximal duodenum. That's correct because FABP is involved there.

Option H: Partial digestion's products form micelles with phospholipids, which increases absorption. That's correct because partial digestion makes the triglycerides more soluble, hence higher absorption. But wait, the question is about which statement is correct, not which is a fact.

Wait, looking back at the options.

Wait, the options are statements that could be correct. So which of these is correct.

Let me read the options again.

Option F: Primary absorption occurs in the proximal duodenum with FABP and CD36. That's correct because those factors are involved there.

Option B: Complete digestion (meaning, all the triglycerides are broken down) leads to mixed micelles which decrease absorption. Yes, that's correct.

Option H: Partial digestion leads to more micelles which increase absorption. So that's correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So all three (B, F, H) might be correct statements. But that's not possible, since only one option can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding each option.

Alternatively, perhaps only one option is correct.

Let me check each option in detail.

Option A: Both MCT and LCT enter the lymph. No, only MCT enters. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Products of complete digestion form micelles with cholesterol and phospholipids. This decreases absorption. That's correct.

Option C: Absorption in distal duodenum uses FABP and FAT/CD36. No, because theyâ€™re used in the proximal. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Must be emulsified and digested. No, triglycerides aren't digested. So D is wrong.

Option E: MCT enters lymph, LCT enters portal. No, that's incorrect.

Option F: Abs primarily in proximal with FABP and CD36. Yes, correct.

Option G: Abs in mid jejunum. Incorrect.

Option H: Partial digestion's products form micelles with phospholipids, increase absorption. Yes, that's correct.

Option I: LCT enters lymph, MCT portal. No.

Option J: Triglycerides can be directly transported. No, because they need to be broken down first.

So which of these is correct? The question is which statement is correct.

Wait, the options are A to J, each a statement. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Looking again, option B: "The products of complete digestion can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this decreases absorption." I think this is correct because complete digestion leads to mixed micelles, which are less lipophilic and thus less absorbed.

Option F says that absorption occurs primarily in the proximal duodenum. That's correct as well.

Option H: The products of partial digestion form micelles, which increase absorption. That's correct.

Now, the question is which of these is correct. So perhaps all three statements are correct? But looking back, perhaps one of these is incorrect.

Wait, maybe looking at H. Partial digestion: Are the triglycerides in solution more easily absorbed? Partial digestion would mean more breakdown, more triglycerides in the small intestine, which are then transported to the duodenum, where they get emulsified (so more lipoprotein). So if the product is in the small intestine, then in the duodenum, they're emulsified, which makes them more lipophilic, so they are better absorbed. So yes, this would increase absorption.

So in that case, the statement in H is correct.

Wait, but wait, the question is which is correct. So H is correct.

Wait, how many correct statements are there? Let me see.

Are any of the options incorrect? Let me go through.

Option B: Correct. So if B is correct, then that's one. Are there other correct options?

Option F: Correct.

Option H: Correct.

Wait, but the question might have only one correct answer.

Looking back, the user's question is asking for which single statement is correct.

So perhaps all three (B, F, H) are correct, but given the options, perhaps not. Or maybe one is incorrect.

Wait, I think that option H is correct because partial digestion would increase absorption. Because the triglycerides are not digested, so when they're in the small intestine, they're emulsified and become more lipophilic, which increases absorption.

So if the question is about which statement is correct, options B, F, H are correct. But the options are single choice, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps only one is correct. Let me go through.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B. Because the statement in B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps H is correct.

Wait, maybe the question is about the primary absorption location. Let me think.

Option F says that it's in the proximal duodenum. That's correct.

Option H says that partial digestion's products form micelles which increase absorption. That's correct.

So perhaps both B and H are correct statements.

Wait, but the question is about which of the options is a correct statement. So perhaps the correct answer is either B, F, or H.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the options. Let me read each option again.

Option B: "Products of complete digestion... decrease absorption" â€” that's correct.

Option F: "Proximal duodenum primarily" â€” correct.

Option H: "Partial digestion's products increase absorption" â€” correct.

So perhaps all three are correct in their statements. But the question asks for which statement is correct, implying only one is correct.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating H. Let me think again.

H states: "The products of partial digestion (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this increases absorption."

Wait, when you partially digest, you're more likely to have more triglycerides. So the products would form more lipoproteins (mixed micelles), which are more lipophilic and thus more easily absorbed. So yes, H is correct.

So that would mean options B, F, and H are correct statements. But the question requires selecting the correct one, implying only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to reevaluate. Let me think about each option again.

Option H says that partial digestion leads to increased absorption. But wait, another thought: in the small intestine, after partial digestion, the triglycerides are emulsified, so the products are more lipophilic, leading to better absorption. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, because it's about complete digestion.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct. So I'm trying to find the correct one.

Let's go through each option again:

A: Both MCT and LCT enter lymph. No, only MCT. So A is wrong.

B: Correct. Complete digestion leads to mixed micelles, which decrease absorption. So B is correct.

C: Incorrect.

D: No.

E: Incorrect.

F: Correct. Proximal duodenum, FABP and CD36.

G: Incorrect.

H: Correct. Partial digestion into more lipoproteins, so absorption increases.

I: Incorrect.

J: No.

So now I'm confused because several options (B, F, H) seem correct. But the question says which statement is correct. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering which of these are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating H. Let's think: Partial digestion of triglycerides would result in more triglycerides, which are emulsified, so more lipoprotein. So their absorption is higher. So statement H is correct.

But then, perhaps all three (B, F, H) are correct, but the question gives four options. But the options are options A to J.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps all three are correct, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider which of the statements is incorrect. But no, the question is about which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on another angle.

Option H: "The products of partial digestion... increase absorption."

Is that correct? I think it's correct because partial digestion leads to more triglycerides, which are emulsified, making them more lipophilic and thus easier to absorb.

So that's correct.

So now I'm really trying to find out which is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option H. Because even though I'm a bit shaky on some details, H is a correct statement.

But then, considering the options, the correct statement is H.

But I'm also thinking that option F is a correct statement.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps all three (B, F, H) are correct, but the question expects one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct. So all three B, F, H are correct statements, but the question allows only one. So perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option again.

Option H: Partial digestion products (triacylglycerols) form mixed micelles with cholesterol and phospholipids, which increase absorption. That's correct.

Option B: Complete digestion products form micelles with cholesterol and decrease absorption. Correct.

Option F: Correct.

So perhaps all three are correct. But the question is about which statement is correct, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that option B is correct.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think about each statement:

Option B: Correct. Complete digestion leads to mixed micelles, which decrease absorption.

Option H: Correct. Partial digestion leads to more lipoproteins, so more absorption.

So both B and H are correct statements.

But the question is which single statement is correct, so perhaps the correct answer is B and H.

But the options don't have that, only one is correct. I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct answer elsewhere.

Wait, I recall that in the small intestine, after partial digestion, triglycerides are emulsified, so they are more lipophilic and better absorbed. So statement H is correct.

So the correct answer would be option H.

Wait, but looking again, I recall that complete digestion leads to mixed micelles, which reduce absorption. So B is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question refers to the primary site of absorption. The duodenum is the first part, so FABP and CD36 are there. So statement F is correct.

So now I'm even more confused because the question allows only one correct option.

Let me think differently. What's the correct answer?

I think the correct answer is option B. Because, after complete digestion, the products form mixed micelles, which decrease absorption. So B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option F is correct because the proximal duodenum is where it happens.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct, not which is a fact. So if all three are correct, but the options don't give me that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option B and H.

Wait, but I can't be sure. For the purpose of this, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

To determine the correct statement about fat digestion and absorption, each option is analyzed as follows:

### Option A:
"After absorption, both medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and long chain triglycerides (LCT) enter the lymphatic system."  
This is incorrect because only MCT enters the lymphatic system, while LCT does not.

### Option B:
"The products of complete digestion of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this decreases absorption."  
This is correct. Complete digestion of triglycerides results in mixed micelles, which reduce absorption due to their lipophilic nature.

### Option C:
"Absorption of fatty acids in the intestine occurs mainly through FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum."  
This is incorrect because FABP and CD36 are primarily involved in the proximal duodenum, not the distal duodenum.

### Option D:
"Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) must be emulsified and digested before the fatty acids can be transported."  
This is incorrect because triglycerides are not digested in the small intestine; they are processed further.

### Option E:
"After absorption, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) enter the lymphatic system, whereas long chain triglycerides (LCT) enter the portal blood system."  
This is incorrect because LCT does not enter the portal blood system; the portal blood system deals with MCT.

### Option F:
"After absorption, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) enter the lymphatic system, whereas long chain triglycerides (LCT) enter the portal blood system."  
This is incorrect because it misrepresents the roles of MCT and LCT.

### Option G:
"Absorption of fatty acids in the intestine occurs mainly through FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins in the enterocytes of the mid jejunum."  
This is incorrect because FABP and CD36 are primarily involved in the proximal duodenum, not the mid jejunum.

### Option H:
"The products of partial digestion of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this increases absorption."  
This is correct. Partial digestion increases triglycerides, which are then emulsified and transported to the duodenum, where they are further processed. This increases absorption by making them lipophilic.

### Option J:
"Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can be directly transported without being emulsified and digested."  
This is incorrect because triglycerides are not digested in the small intestine; they are processed further.

### Conclusion:
The correct statements are **B** and **H**. However, since the question requires selecting only one correct answer, **B** is the most appropriate choice based on its direct and clear description of the correct biological fact.
