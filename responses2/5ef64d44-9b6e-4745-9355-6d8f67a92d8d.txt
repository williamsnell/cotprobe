Okay, let's see. I've got this problem about a plastics company's waste cost. Hmm, I need to find the total waste cost for producing 45 modules and also figure out the number of modules that minimizes the cost. 

So the problem says the cost is fixed at $12 for up to 20 modules. After that, the cost increases according to 4(p - 20)^2 where p is the modules in excess of 20. So, let's break this down.

First, part (i) asks for the total waste cost when producing 45 modules. Let's calculate that.

Wait, 45 modules in total. So, the excess p is 45 - 20 = 25 modules. So, p is 25. Then, the cost beyond 20 is 4*(25)^2. Let me compute that.

25 squared is 625. Multiply by 4: 625 *4 = 2500. Then add the fixed cost of $12. So total cost is 2500 +12 = $2512. So, for part (i), the answer is $2512.

Now part (ii): what number minimizes the waste cost. The cost function is 4(p-20)^2, but only for p ≥0, since p can't be negative. Wait, but the fixed cost is for up to 20 modules, so the total cost is 12 + 4(p-20)^2 where p is the number of modules made beyond 20. So the cost function is 4(p-20)^2 + 12.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The fixed cost is $12 for up to 20 modules. So if you produce 20 modules, cost is 12. If you produce more, you add 4*(p-20)^2, where p is the number of modules beyond 20. So the total cost is 12 + 4(p-20)^2. So yes, the total cost function is C(p) = 4(p-20)^2 +12.

Wait, but p is the number of modules beyond 20, so p can be zero (for 20 modules) or more. So to find the minimum, since the function is a parabola shifted up by 12, the minimum occurs where the squared term is zero. That is, when p=20. Because if p increases, the squared term increases, which adds to the cost. So the minimal cost is when p=0, because that gives 4*(0)^2 +12 = 12 dollars.

Wait, but the question is about the number of modules that minimizes it. If p=0, that's 20 modules. So the minimal cost is achieved at 20 modules. But wait, the options given are different. Let me check.

Wait, in the options, the possible numbers are 17,18,21,22, etc. Wait, but according to this, the minimal point is at p=0, which is 20 modules. But looking at the options, the minimal points are 25,24,26, etc. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-examine the problem. Oh! Wait, perhaps I misread the function. The cost function is 4*(p-20)^2 for p modules in excess. So p is the number beyond 20. So the total cost is 12 (fixed) + 4*(p-20)^2.

Wait, but if p is the number of modules, then for p=20, the cost is 12. For p=21, cost is 12 +4*(1)^2=16. For p=22, cost is 12+4*(2)^2=12+16=28. Hmm, wait that can't be right. Because 4*(p-20)^2 would be increasing as p increases beyond 20. So the minimal cost is 12, at p=0, which is 20 modules.

But in the options, the numbers given are 17,21, etc. So maybe I'm misunderstanding part (ii). Let me read again.

Wait, no, part (ii) is about minimizing the waste cost. If the function is 4*(p-20)^2, that's a parabola that opens upwards, with vertex at p=20. So the minimal value is at p=20. So the number that minimizes the cost is 20. But the options don't have 20, they have 17, 18, etc.

Wait, no, maybe I misread the function. Oh wait, perhaps the function is 4(p - 20)^2, but p is the total number of modules. So for p=20, cost is 12; for p=21, it's 4*(1)^2=4, so 12+4=16. For p=22, it's 4*4=16, 12+16=28. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because as p increases beyond 20, the cost increases, so the minimal is at p=20. So the minimal number is 20.

But looking at the options, the one with 20 is not present. Oh wait, option E is $2,512 and 20 modules. So that would imply that the minimal cost is 2512, which is the answer to part (i). So that would make sense.

Wait, but according to the problem, part (ii) is asking for the number that minimizes the cost. If the minimal is at 20, then the answer is 20. But in the options, option E is 20 modules, and the cost is 2512, which matches part (i). So the correct answer for part (ii) would be 20 modules. So the options that have 20 would be E, but wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 2,510 and 21

B: 2,488 and 24

C: 2,516 and 25

D: 2,532 and 26

E: 2,512 and 20

F: 2,000 and 19

G: 2,515 and 18

H: 3,012 and 23

I: 2,500 and 22

J: 2,524 and 17

So E is 20 modules. So that would be the correct answer for part (ii). But wait, the options are for the number that minimizes the cost. So the minimal occurs at 20, so the answer is 20. So looking for the option that says 20, which is E. But wait, the options for part (ii) are the numbers that minimize the cost. So the number that gives minimal cost is 20, but the options don't have 20. Oh wait, no, option E says 20 modules, but the total cost is 2512, which is the cost at part (i). So the number that minimizes the cost is 20.

Wait, but the options for part (ii) are the numbers that give the minimal cost. Wait, no. The question is: (ii) What number minimizes waste cost? So the number that gives the minimal cost is 20. So the correct answer would be 20, but looking at the options, which option has 20 as the number? Option E. But wait, the options for part (ii) are not given as 20. Oh wait, no. The options for part (ii) are the numbers that would be the minimal. Let me check again.

Wait, the question is in two parts. So part (i) is calculating the cost for 45 modules, which is 2512. Part (ii) is asking for the number that minimizes the cost. The minimal occurs at 20 modules. So the number is 20. Now, looking for an option that gives 20. The options are A to J. Option E is 20, but it's the second part of the option. Wait, no. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options, each option is a pair: first is the cost, second is the number. So for example, option E is 2,512 and 20. So that's the cost (2512) and the number (20). So the correct answer for part (ii) is 20. But in the given options, only option E has 20, but that's the second part. So the number is 20. So the correct answer is option E.

Wait, but wait, the options for part (ii) are not given as the number. Let me read the question again. The question is about two parts: (i) total cost for 45 modules, (ii) the number that minimizes the cost. So the correct options for (i) is E (2512), and for (ii) is 20. So the correct answer is option E for the second part. But looking at the options, the options are for each part. So the correct answer is option E for part (ii), but the question is whether the options list the correct number for part (ii). Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, no. The options are all pairs. So for example, option E is 2512 and 20. So the first number is the cost, the second is the number that gives that cost. So part (i) is 2512, and part (ii) is 20. So the correct answer is option E, because it lists 2512 (the cost) and 20 (the number). So the answer would be option E.

But let me double-check. Because part (i) is about 45 modules, which gives 2512, and part (ii) is about finding the number that gives minimal cost, which is 20. So the correct option is the one where the second number is 20, which is option E: 2,512 and 20.
</think>

The cost function is 4(p - 20)² + 12, where p is the number of modules in excess of 20. The minimal cost occurs at p = 0 (20 modules), giving a total cost of 12. However, the options provided do not include 20 as the minimizing number. Instead, option E correctly lists the total cost for 45 modules (2512) and the minimizing number (20), indicating 20 modules minimize the cost.
