Okay, so I've got this probability question here. Let me read it again. The question is: In a single throw of a single die, find the probability of obtaining either a 2 or a 5. The options are A through I. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with probability, especially with dice, each outcome is equally likely. A standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6, right? So each number has a 1/6 chance of coming up.

The question is asking for the probability of getting either a 2 or a 5. So I think I should find the number of favorable outcomes and divide that by the total number of possible outcomes.

Wait, the total number of possible outcomes when throwing a die is 6, since there are six faces. So the denominator of the probability would be 6.

Now, the favorable outcomes are the ones that are either 2 or 5. So let me count them. The die has 2 and 5, which are two distinct numbers. So that's 2 favorable outcomes.

So the probability should be 2 divided by 6. Let me write that as a fraction: 2/6. Oh, wait, I can simplify that. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2. So 2 รท 2 is 1, and 6 รท 2 is 3. So it simplifies to 1/3.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 1/3. So that seems to be the answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, I can think of the probability as adding the individual probabilities of getting a 2 and getting a 5. The probability of rolling a 2 is 1/6, and the probability of rolling a 5 is also 1/6. So adding them: 1/6 + 1/6 equals 2/6, which again simplifies to 1/3. Yep, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be E: 1/3.

The probability of rolling a 2 or a 5 on a die is calculated by considering the favorable outcomes (2 and 5) over the total possible outcomes (6). This simplifies to 2/6, which reduces to 1/3.

Answer: E: 1/3
