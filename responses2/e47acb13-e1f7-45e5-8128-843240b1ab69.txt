Okay, so I've got this question about Soledad and her schedule of reinforcement. Hmm, let me think. The question says that Soledad answers every email her friend sends. I remember that schedule of reinforcement includes different types of schedules like fixed ratio, fixed interval, variable ratio, variable interval, etc. 

Wait, Soledad is answering every message. So, that probably means every time she gets a reward. But what kind of reinforcement is that? If she gets positive reinforcement every time, that would be a fixed ratio. Because a fixed ratio schedule requires the subject to respond a certain number of times for a reward. So if she's answering every time, she's responding a fixed number of times (which is 1 in this case) for the reward.

Alternatively, if it's a variable ratio, she would have to answer a different number each time. But since she's only responding once for each email, that's a fixed ratio. 

Wait, but sometimes I get confused between fixed ratio and continuous reinforcement. Continuous reinforcement is when every response gets a reinforcement, but that's more about the frequency of reinforcement, not the number of responses. For example, every time she answers, she gets a reward. So that's more like a fixed ratio, because she has to answer a fixed number of times (once) for a reward. 

Oh, but another thing to remember is extinction. Extinction is when a behavior is extinguished, meaning it's no longer happening. So if Soledad stops answering emails, that means extinction happened. But the question doesn't mention anything about extinction, it's just about her schedule of reinforcement. So the type of reinforcement is about how often she gets the reward, not about whether she stops.

So the options are fixed ratio (B), fixed interval (H), etc. Fixed ratio is the correct one because she answers every time, meaning once for the reward. So the answer should be B.

The correct answer is **B: fixed ratio**. Soledad answers every email message, indicating that she receives a reward after a fixed number of responses (once per email). 

Answer: B
