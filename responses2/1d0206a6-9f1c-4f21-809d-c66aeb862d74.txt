Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is asking for the greatest possible quotient of any two distinct members from the set {2/5, 1/2, 5, 10}. They want me to maximize x divided by y, where x and y are from that set. The options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 1 to 50. I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, so to get the largest possible value of x/y, I should look for the largest numerator and the smallest denominator. Because dividing a larger number by a smaller one gives a bigger result.

Let me list the set again: {2/5, 1/2, 5, 10}. Let's convert those to decimals to make it easier, maybe. 2/5 is 0.4, 1/2 is 0.5, 5 is 5, and 10 is 10. So the set is {0.4, 0.5, 5, 10}.

Now, the largest number here is 10, and the smallest is 0.4. So if I take 10 divided by 0.4, that should give me the biggest possible quotient.

Wait, let me calculate that. 10 divided by 0.4. Hmm, 0.4 goes into 10 how many times? Well, 0.4 times 25 is 10, because 0.4 times 10 is 4, times 20 is 8, times 25 is 10. So 10 / 0.4 is 25.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's a bigger value. Let's see. Are there any other combinations where x is larger than 10? No, the largest is 10. How about y being smaller than 0.4? The next smallest is 0.5. So 10 divided by 0.5 is 20, which is less than 25. So 25 is bigger.

What about the other way around? If I take the smallest x and largest y, that would be 0.4 divided by 10, which is 0.04. That's definitely smaller than 25.

Wait, another thought: are there any other numbers in the set that I might have missed? The set is {2/5, 1/2, 5, 10}, which correspond to 0.4, 0.5, 5, 10. So no, those are the only options.

So the largest quotient would be 10 divided by 0.4, which is 25. Looking at the options, B is 2, D is 4, G is 5, H is 30, I is 50, J is 10. So 25 is not listed as an option. Wait, that's a problem. The options don't include 25, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are A:100, B:2, C:20, D:4, E:15, F:25, G:5, H:30, I:50, J:10.

Oh, so option F is 25. So that would be the answer. So the maximum quotient is 25, which is option F.

The greatest quotient is achieved by dividing the largest number in the set by the smallest, which is 10 / 0.4 = 25. This corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
