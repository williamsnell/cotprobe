Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says a company makes 5 blue cars for every 3 white cars. And if they make 15 white cars in one day, how many blue cars will they make? The options are A to J, with numbers ranging from 9 to 40.

Alright, so the ratio is 5 blue to 3 white. That means for every group of 3 white cars, there are 5 blue cars. So I need to find out how many such groups of 3 white cars there are when there are 15 white cars, and then multiply that by 5 to get the number of blue cars.

Let me break it down. If 3 white cars correspond to 5 blue cars, then a group of 3 white cars is one set. So how many sets of 3 white cars are there in 15 white cars? I can calculate that by dividing 15 by 3, which is 5. So there are 5 such groups.

Each group gives 5 blue cars, so 5 groups would be 5 multiplied by 5. Let me do that math: 5 * 5 = 25. So the company should make 25 blue cars.

Looking at the options, option A is 25. So that should be the correct answer.

The company makes 5 blue cars for every 3 white cars. To find the number of blue cars when 15 white cars are made, divide 15 by 3 to get 5 groups. Multiply 5 groups by 5 blue cars per group to get 25 blue cars.
