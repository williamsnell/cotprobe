Okay, so I have this question about an RC low-pass filter and the output noise power. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let me try to think this through.

The transfer function is given as H(f) = 1/(1 + jf/f_c), where f_c is the 3-dB frequency. I remember that in a low-pass filter, the output is attenuated below the cutoff frequency, but here the input is white noise. White noise has a flat power spectral density, right?

Wait, when the input is white noise, the output noise power depends on the noise figure and the input noise spectral density. Oh wait, maybe I should think in terms of the filter's gain and how it affects the noise.

The transfer function H(f) represents the gain at each frequency. The noise figure is related to the gain and the noise temperature, but I'm not sure if I need that here. Alternatively, I think the output noise power is related to the input power multiplied by the square of the transfer function's magnitude at the output frequency.

Wait, no. White noise is a specific kind of input. White noise has a constant power spectral density across all frequencies, so its average power depends on its spectral density. The output noise power would be the integral of the squared magnitude of the transfer function multiplied by the input noise power spectral density over all frequencies.

But wait, for a filter, the output noise power can be found by integrating the noise figure times the input noise power spectral density over all frequencies. Alternatively, considering the filter's effect on white noise, the output noise power is the input noise power multiplied by the square of the transfer function's magnitude at the output frequency. Or wait, maybe I should think about it differently.

Wait, let me recall: for a linear time-invariant system, the output noise power is the integral over all frequencies of the transfer function's magnitude squared multiplied by the input noise spectral density. For white noise, the input spectral density is N_0 (the noise spectral density, which is noise power per unit bandwidth). So the output noise power is the integral from 0 to infinity of |H(f)|² * N_0 df.

But wait, the problem doesn't give me the input noise spectral density, but it's probably a standard value. Alternatively, for white noise, the input spectral density is often considered as N_0 = kT, but I'm not entirely sure about the units. Wait, but maybe the answer options are in terms of f_c and η, so perhaps η is the noise figure.

Wait, no, the noise figure is a dimensionless quantity. Hmmm, I think I might have mixed up the concepts. Let me think again. White noise has a power spectral density of N_0 (same for all frequencies). The output noise power is the integral from 0 to infinity of |H(f)|^2 * N_0 df. But wait, the question says the output noise power is N_0, which is a bit confusing because N_0 is the input noise power spectral density. But perhaps the question is considering the output noise power as the noise figure times the input noise power, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the noise figure of the filter. Because for a filter, the output noise is the input noise multiplied by the noise figure. But wait, the noise figure might be related to f_c. Wait, maybe I need to compute the noise figure of the filter. Because the problem is about the output noise power of the filter when the input is white noise.

Wait, but wait. The noise figure (F) of a filter is defined as the ratio of the output noise power to the input noise power, assuming all noise is white. So F = N_0_out / N_0_in. However, for a filter, the noise figure is the gain of the filter in terms of noise. So if the filter has a transfer function H(f), then the noise figure is |H(f)|^2 at the output frequency. But I think the filter's noise figure is the same at all frequencies, so perhaps f_c is the 3-dB point, and the noise figure is evaluated at f_c.

Wait, but the transfer function is H(f) = 1/(1 + jf/f_c). So at f=0, H=1, so the gain is 1. At f_c, the denominator becomes 2j f_c /f_c = 2j. So H(f_c) = 1/(2j) = -j/2. So the magnitude squared is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the magnitude squared is (1/(1 + (f/f_c)^2)) * (1) [since (1 + jf/f_c) has magnitude sqrt(1 + (f/f_c)^2), so squared is 1 + (f/f_c)^2. So H(f) magnitude squared is 1/(1 + (f/f_c)^2).

Wait, but the noise figure would be the noise figure of the filter. The noise figure is the ratio of the output noise power to the input noise power. For a white noise input, the output noise power is the integral of |H(f)|² * N_0 df. So N_0 is the input noise power spectral density. But I need to find the output noise power N_0. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because N_0 is the input, so the output would be the integral, which would be a function of f_c and the input N_0.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the output in terms of the noise figure. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about what the output noise power would be if the input is white noise.

Wait, the output noise power is the integral of |H(f)|² * N_0 df from 0 to infinity. Since N_0 is the input noise power spectral density, and for white noise, it's constant. So the integral becomes N_0 * ∫ (1/(1 + (f/f_c)^2)) df from 0 to ∞.

The integral of 1/(1 + (f/fc)^2) df is (1/fc) arctan(f/fc) evaluated from 0 to ∞. At infinity, arctan(∞) is π/2. At zero, it's zero. So the integral is (1/fc) * (π/2 - 0) ) = π/(2 f_c).

So the output noise power is N_0 * (π/(2 f_c)).

Wait, but the options don't have N_0 multiplied by π/(2 f_c). They have terms like η f_c π, etc. So perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe the noise figure is involved.

Wait, the noise figure F is equal to the ratio of the output noise power to the input noise power. So F = N_0_out / N_0_in. So N_0_out = F * N_0_in. But wait, in this case, the input is white noise, so N_0_in is the input noise power spectral density. So the output noise power would be F times that.

But what is the noise figure of the filter? The noise figure is given by F = (1 + (f/f_c)) ? Wait, no. The transfer function of the filter is H(f) = 1/(1 + jf/f_c). So the magnitude squared is |H(f)|^2 = 1/(1 + (f/f_c)^2). So the noise figure is the magnitude squared at the 3-dB point, which is at f_c. Because the 3-dB point is where the gain is -3dB, so the magnitude is 1/sqrt(2). So |H(f_c)|²=1/2. So the noise figure F is 1/2. Because F = |H(f)|² at f_c, which is 1/2. So F=0.5.

Wait, but wait. The noise figure is often defined as F = (gain at output frequency) squared * (noise figure at cutoff frequency). Or maybe it's that the noise figure is the gain squared at the output frequency. Alternatively, for a filter, the noise figure is the magnitude squared of the transfer function evaluated at the output frequency.

Wait, considering that, the noise figure F is |H(f)|^2 evaluated at f = f_c. So |H(f_c)|^2 is [1/(1 + (f_c/f_c)^2)] = 1/2. So F = 1/2.

Wait, but if the input is white noise, then the output noise power is F multiplied by the input noise power. But wait, the input is white noise, which has a power spectral density N_0. The output noise power would be F * ∫|H(f)|² N_0 df.

Wait, that's the same as F * (1/(2 f_c)) * N_0 * π/(2 f_c) * 2? Wait, no, earlier I found that the integral is (π/(2 f_c)) * N_0.

Wait, earlier calculation: ∫ |H(f)|^2 N_0 df from 0 to ∞ is N_0 * (π/(2 f_c)).

So if F is 1/2, then N_0_out = (1/2) * N_0 * (π/(2 f_c)) )= N_0 * π/(4 f_c). But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, but the options all have terms like η f_c π. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the integral.

Wait, wait. Let me re-calculate the integral.

H(f) = 1/(1 + jf/f_c )

The magnitude squared |H(f)|² is (1 + (f/f_c)^2 )^-1.

So the integral from 0 to infinity of |H(f)|² df is ∫ [1/(1 + (f/f_c)^2)] df.

Let u = f/f_c → f = u f_c, so df = f_c du.

Then integral becomes ∫ (1/(1 + u²)) f_c du from u=0 to u=∞.

Which is f_c ∫ du/(1 + u²) from 0 to infty → f_c [ (1/2) ln(u² +1 ) ] from 0 to infty → (f_c/2) ( ln(∞) - ln(1) ) → (f_c/2)(∞), which is infinity. Oh wait, that's not possible because the function 1/(1+u²) is integrable, so the integral must be finite. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the integral of 1/(1 + u^2) from 0 to infinity is (pi)/2. So the integral is (f_c/2) * pi → (f_c pi)/2. Oh right, so I missed the 1/2 earlier.

So the integral is (f_c pi)/2.

So the output noise power is N_0 * (f_c pi/2).

But wait, the question is about the output noise power N_0. Hmm, but wait, in this case, the input is white noise, which is a random process with a constant power spectral density N_0. So the output noise power is the integral of |H(f)|² N_0 df, which is N_0 * (f_c pi/2).

Wait, but the options don't have N_0 multiplied by f_c pi. They have terms like η f_c pi, which suggests that η is the noise figure or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. The noise figure F is equal to |H(f)|² at f_c. So F = 1/2. Then the output noise power is F multiplied by the input noise power. But the input noise power is N_0 * (f_c pi/2) (the integral of |H(f)|² N_0 df from 0 to infty is N_0*(f_c pi/2)).

Wait, but then the output noise power would be F * (N_0 * (f_c pi / 2 )) ), which is (1/2) * N_0 * (f_c pi /2 ) ) = N_0 (f_c pi ) /4.

But none of the options match that. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the noise figure is F = |H(f)|^2 at f_c, which is 1/2, so F = 1/2.

But the output noise power is F multiplied by the input noise power. The input noise power is the integral of N_0 df from 0 to inf, which is N_0 (f_c pi/2 ). So the output noise power is F * integral = (1/2) * (N_0 (f_c pi/2 )) = N_0 (f_c pi)/4. But looking at the options, none have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says the input is white noise, so the noise figure F is the ratio of the output noise power to the input noise power. So the output noise power is F times the input noise power.

Wait, but the input noise power is N_0 multiplied by the integral of |H(f)|² df, which is (f_c pi)/2. So output noise power is F * (input noise power) = F * (N_0 (f_c pi/2 )).

But F is 1/2, so output noise power is (1/2) * N_0 (f_c pi/2 ) ) = N_0 (f_c pi ) /4. But this is not among the options. Wait, the answer options don't have that. So perhaps I've made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the output noise power in terms of the filter's characteristics, not the noise figure. Let me think again.

Another approach: The output noise power, when the input is white noise, is given by the integral of |H(f)|² multiplied by the input noise power spectral density N_0, integrated over all frequencies.

So N_0 * ∫ (1/(1 + (f/f_c)^2)) df from 0 to inf.

And the integral of 1/(1 + (f/f_c)^2) df from 0 to inf is (pi/2 f_c) * N_0.

Wait, wait, no, I think I'm confusing units. Let me clarify: The integral of |H(f)|² * N_0 df gives the output noise power.

Wait, the integral is ∫ |H(f)|² * N_0 df from 0 to ∞.

But earlier, I found the integral of |H(f)|² df from 0 to inf is (pi/2 f_c) ). So the integral becomes N_0 * (pi/(2 f_c)).

So the output noise power is N_0 * (pi/(2 f_c)).

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the noise figure.

Wait, wait. The noise figure F is the ratio of the output noise power to the input noise power.

But the input noise power is the integral of |H(f)|² * N_0 df, which is (pi/(2 f_c)) N_0.

The output noise power is F * (input noise power). So if F is 1/2, the output would be (pi/(2 f_c)) N_0 * (1/2) = (pi N_0)/(4 f_c).

But the options don't have this, but option E is (η f_c π) / 2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is using η as the noise temperature, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The output noise power is the input noise power multiplied by the noise figure.

The input is white noise, so the input noise power is N_0 * (f_c pi/ 2 ). The noise figure F is 1/2.

So output power is F * input power = 1/2 * N_0 (f_c pi/2 ) ) = N_0 (f_c pi )/4.

But again, none of the options match this.

Wait, looking at the options, option E is (η f_c π )/2.

Hmm. So I'm making a mistake somewhere. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the noise factor, which is the same as the noise figure. For a RC low-pass filter, the noise factor F is 1/(1 + (f_c / f_c )^2 ) = 1/2.

Wait, but that's the same as the noise figure.

So F = 1/2.

But the output noise power is F * (input noise power), and input noise power is N_0 * (f_c pi/2 ).

So output power is (1/2) * (N_0 (f_c pi/2 )) ) = N_0 (f_c pi ) /4.

But this is the same as before. So none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the noise factor of the filter. So the output noise power is F times the input noise power.

So if F = 1/2, then output power is (1/2) * N_0 * (f_c pi/2) ) = N_0 (f_c pi ) /4.

But this is not in the options. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: (η f_c π) /8

B: 5(η f_c π)/2

C: (ηf_c π)/3

D: η f_c

E: (ηf_c π)/2

F: (ηf_c π)/4

G: 3(ηf_c π)/4

H: 4(ηf_c π)

I: 2(ηf_c π)

J: η f_c / π

Wait, F is (ηf_c π)/4, which matches option F. But according to my calculation, the output noise power is N_0 (f_c pi )/4. But the options don't involve N_0; they all have η f_c π. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the input is white noise, so the input power is N_0 * (f_c pi )/(2), and the output is F times that. So output power would be (1/2) * (N_0 (f_c pi )/2 ) = N_0 f_c pi /4.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, let me recalculate the integral ∫ |H(f)|² df.

H(f) = 1/(1 + jf/fc )

So |H(f)|² = 1/(1 + (f/fc )^2 )

The integral from 0 to infinity of 1/(1 + (f/fc )^2 ) df.

Let’s make substitution u = f/fc → f = u f_c → df = f_c du.

Then the integral becomes ∫ (1/(1 + u² )) f_c du from u=0 to u=∞.

Which is f_c ∫ (1/(1 + u² )) du from 0 to ∞.

The integral of 1/(1+u²) du is (1/2) ln (u² +1) ) evaluated from 0 to ∞, which gives (1/2) (ln (∞) - ln(1)) ) = (1/2) (infty - 0) ) = infinity.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the function 1/(1 + u²) is integrable, so the integral must be finite. Wait, but the integral of 1/(1 + u²) from 0 to infty is (pi/2 ), because tan^{-1}(infty) is pi/2.

So ∫ (1/(1 + u^2 )) du from 0 to infty is pi/2. So the integral becomes f_c * (pi/2 ). So the integral of |H(f)|² df is (f_c pi)/2.

So the output noise power is N_0 multiplied by (f_c pi )/2.

But the options don't have that. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the noise factor F, which is 1/(1 + (f_c/f)^2 ), evaluated at f_c, so F=1/2. So output noise power is F multiplied by the input noise power.

Wait, the input noise power is the integral of |H(f)|² N_0 df. So the input is N_0 multiplied by (f_c pi)/2.

So the output is F times input. So (1/2) * (N_0 (f_c pi)/2 ) ) = N_0 (f_c pi )/4.

Again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the noise factor as F = 1/(1 + (f_c/f)^2 ), so F = 1/2. So output noise power is F multiplied by the input noise power. So F = 1/2.

But the input noise power is N_0 * (f_c pi / 2 ). So output is (1/2) * N_0 * (f_c pi / 2 ) = N_0 f_c pi /4.

But I'm not seeing this in the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the noise figure is the noise factor F = 1/(1 + (f_c/f)^2 ), so F = 1/2. So output noise power is F multiplied by the input noise power, which is F * (N_0 (f_c pi/2 )).

Wait, but that's the same as before. So output is N_0 (f_c pi)/4.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps I've misunderstood the question.

Wait, let me think: If the input is white noise with power spectral density N_0, then the output noise power is the integral of |H(f)|² N_0 df.

Which is N_0 * (f_c pi)/2.

So if the output noise power is N_0 (f_c pi)/2, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is asking for the output noise power in terms of the filter's other parameters, like the 3-dB point.

Wait, another approach: The output noise power is the integral of |H(f)|² N_0 df. H(f) is 1/(1 + jf/fc ), so |H(f)|² is 1/(1 + (f/fc)^2 ) = 1/(1 + u² ), where u = f/fc.

The integral from 0 to infinity is (1/2) ∫ du/(1 +u² ) from 0 to infinity = (1/2)(pi/2) ) = pi/4.

So the integral is (pi/4 ) * N_0.

Wait, but that would be the output noise power, N_0 (pi/4).

But the options have terms like η f_c pi.

Wait, perhaps I should relate it to the noise temperature. The noise temperature T is given by the noise factor F. For a filter, F = |H(f_c)|² = 1/2. So T would be F times some reference temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the noise figure F is related to the noise temperature, and F = (T)/T0, where T0 is some reference.

But I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, another approach: The output noise power is the noise figure times the input noise power.

So, output noise power = F * input noise power.

Input noise power is the integral of |H(f)|² N_0 df, which we found as (f_c pi/2 ) N_0.

So output noise power = F * (f_c pi/ 2 ) N_0.

F is 1/2.

So output noise power = (1/2) * (f_c pi/2 ) N_0 = (f_c pi N_0 ) /4.

But this is not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the options use η as the noise factor, but the question uses F as noise figure. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses η as the noise temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the output noise power in terms of the filter's cutoff frequency.

Wait, perhaps the transfer function is H(f) = 1/(1 + jf/fc ), which is a first-order system. The output noise power for a white noise input is the noise factor F multiplied by the input noise power.

Wait, but I've spent a lot of time on this without reaching a conclusion. Let me look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the output noise power is given by the integral of |H(f)|^2 multiplied by the input noise power, which is the integral of 1/(1 + (f/fc)^2) N_0 df from 0 to infty.

Which is N_0 * (f_c pi/2 ).

But if the input is white noise, the output noise power is N_0 * (f_c pi/2 ), and if the noise figure is F, then output noise power is F * N_0 * (f_c pi/2 ).

But F = 1/2, so it's (1/2) * N_0 * (f_c pi/2 ) = N_0 (f_c pi )/4.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the noise figure F is 1/2, and the output noise power is F multiplied by the input noise power. So if the input noise power is N_0 (f_c pi/2 ), then output is (1/2) * N_0 (f_c pi/2 ) = N_0 (f_c pi/4).

But again, none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the output noise power is the product of the input noise power and the noise factor.

But in that case, N_0 (f_c pi/2 ) * F = (1/2) * N_0 (f_c pi/2 ) = N_0 (f_c pi )/4.

But looking at the options, F is option E: (η f_c π)/2.

Option E is (η f_c π)/2.

Option F is (η f_c π)/4.

Wait, so this would mean that the output noise power is option F.

Wait, but earlier I thought the output noise power was (1/2) * N_0 (f_c pi/2 ) = N_0 (f_c pi )/4, which is option F.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the output noise power in terms of the filter's cutoff frequency and the noise factor.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the options.

Wait, another approach: The output noise power is the integral of |H(f)|^2 N_0 df from 0 to infty.

Which is N_0 multiplied by (f_c pi/2 ) → N_0 (f_c pi/2 ).

If the output noise power is N_0 (f_c pi/2 ), and the noise factor F is 1/2, then N_0 (f_c pi/2 ) * F = (1/2) * N_0 (f_c pi/2 ) = N_0 (f_c pi )/4.

Which is option F.

So the correct answer would be option F.

But earlier I thought the output noise power is (1/2) * (input noise power), which is (1/2) * (N_0 (f_c pi/2 )) → N_0 (f_c pi )/4.

So option F matches this.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the output noise power is N_0 (f_c pi )/4, which is option F.

So the correct answer should be option F.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the output noise power of a white noise input through a low-pass RC filter with a transfer function \( H(f) = \frac{1}{1 + jf/f_c} \). The output noise power is given by the integral of the squared magnitude of the transfer function multiplied by the input noise power spectral density \( N_0 \).

### Step 1: Calculate the Integral of \( |H(f)|^2 \)
The squared magnitude of the transfer function is:
\[
|H(f)|^2 = \frac{1}{1 + (f/f_c)^2}
\]
The integral of this expression over all frequencies is:
\[
\int_0^\infty |H(f)|^2 df = \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1 + (f/f_c)^2} df = \frac{f_c \pi}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Output Noise Power
The output noise power is the product of the integral and the input noise power spectral density \( N_0 \):
\[
\text{Output Noise Power} = N_0 \cdot \frac{f_c \pi}{2}
\]

### Step 3: Compare with Options
The options provided do not directly match this result. However, considering the possibility of a typo in the options, the closest match to the derived expression \( N_0 \cdot \frac{f_c \pi}{2} \) is **Option F: \( \frac{\eta f_c \pi}{4} \)**. This suggests that the noise factor \( F = \frac{\eta}{2} \), leading to the output noise power being half of \( N_0 \cdot \frac{f_c \pi}{2} \), resulting in \( N_0 \cdot \frac{f_c \pi}{4} \).

ANSWER: F
