Question:

A farmer has a large field where he grows corn. He hires a crop-duster to spray the field, but the crop- duster mistakenly sprays a strong herbicide, rather than a pesticide, and kills all the corn plants in the field. Several days later, a construction company building a house near the farmer's field negligently hits a gas line and starts a fire that burns everything in the area, including the farmer's field. If the farmer brings negligence claims against the crop-duster and the construction company in order to recover damages for the destruction of his corn crop, the most likely result is

Options:

A: neither the crop-duster nor the construction company is liable, because neither is a "but for" cause of the harm.
B: both the crop-duster and the construction company are liable, because each engaged in a negligent action that was sufficient to destroy the farmer's corn crop.
C: only the crop-duster is liable, because its negligence occurred before the construction company's negligence.
D: both the crop-duster and the construction company are liable, because they both contributed to the loss of the farmer's corn crop.
E: neither the crop-duster nor the construction company is liable, because the farmer did not have insurance for his corn crop.
F: neither the crop-duster nor the construction company is liable, because the farmer failed to protect his field.
G: only the construction company is liable, because the fire caused more damage than the herbicide.
H: only the crop-duster is liable, because the construction company's fire was an unforeseeable event.
I: only the construction company is liable, because its negligence would have destroyed the farmer's corn crop no matter what the crop- duster did.
J: the crop-duster is liable for the value of the corn crop and the construction company is liable for the damage to the field.

Okay, so I'm faced with this legal question, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

A farmer has a large field where he grows corn. He hires a crop-duster to spray the field, but the duster sprays a herbicide instead of a pesticide. This kills all the corn plants. Then, a construction company negligently hits a gas line, causing a fire that destroys the farmer's field. The farmer is suing both the crop-duster and the construction company for damages from the corn crop destruction. I need to determine who is liable.

Hmm. So the key here is to look at the causes of action. The question is about negligence claims. So each party's liability depends on whether their actions were negligent.

First, the crop-duster. They used a herbicide instead of a pesticide. I remember that pesticides are generally considered safe for crops because they're designed to kill or inhibit the target. Herbicides might be less so, but in this case, the use was wrong. The duster mistakenly sprayed herbicide instead of pesticide. So the crop-duster's action was negligent because it didn't meet the standard of care expected for spraying crops. So the crop-duster is liable for the herbicide used, which caused the corn to die.

Now, the construction company. They negligently hit the gas line, causing a fire. The fire destroyed the field, including the corn. For negligence claims, the business's failure to take reasonable precautions is a cause of loss. The fire is a natural disaster, but the question is whether the construction company's negligence was negligent. In most cases, a business can be held liable for the negligence of another business, especially if the act is a continuing harm. The fire caused significant damage, which would likely exceed the expected losses, so it's a "continuing harm" situation. So the construction company is liable.

So both parties are liable. Let me look at the options.

Option B says both are liable because each engaged in a negligent action. That makes sense. The duster's herbicide is a direct cause, and the construction's fire is a continuing harm.

Option E says neither is liable because the farmer didn't have insurance. But wait, the option says "neither is liable, because the farmer did not have insurance." That's incorrect because the claimant is suing the parties directly, not the farmers. So the farmers' insurance isn't directly relevant here.

Option A claims neither is liable because neither is a "but for" cause. That's not correct because each party's actions were negligent.

Option D says both are liable because they contributed to the loss. That's not the case. The contributions are not the issue; it's the negligence that matters.

Option H and J say the crop-duster is liable because the construction's fire would have destroyed the field. That's not correct because the farmer is suing both parties for the corn's destruction, not just the construction company.

So the correct answer is B.

The farmer is suing both the crop-duster and the construction company for damages from the corn crop's destruction. To determine liability, we analyze the negligence of each party.

1. **Crop-Duster**: The duster used a herbicide instead of a pesticide, a clear mistake. Herbicides are generally less safe than pesticides, so this was negligent. The crop-duster is liable.

2. **Construction Company**: The fire caused significant damage, likely exceeding expected losses. The construction company's negligence is negligent, making them liable.

Both parties were negligent, so the correct answer is B.

**Answer: B**
