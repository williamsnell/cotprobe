Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this question about heterogeneous vs. homogeneous work groups. The question is about what happens when groups are heterogeneous in comparison to homogeneous ones. The options are A to J, each making different claims about creativity, decision-making, productivity, etc.

First, I'll break down what each term means. Heterogeneous groups mix different people, while homogeneous groups are more like a unified unit. In organizational contexts, heterogeneous groups might bring diverse perspectives and skills, which could lead to more creativity. On the other hand, homogeneous groups might work together more efficiently because there's a common identity and approach, possibly leading to better decision-making.

I remember from my studies that heterogeneous groups can contribute to better creativity because mixing different ideas can spark new thoughts. However, I also recall that sometimes a homogeneous group can be more effective in decision-making because it can make more informed decisions when people have a common ground to base them on. So, if a group is homogeneous, they might be better at making decisions.

Now, looking at the options. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Heterogeneous groups are more creative but worse at decision-making. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I was thinking heterogeneous groups are better at decision-making, so A is probably wrong.

Option B: Heterogeneous groups are more creative and better at decision-making. That seems to align with what I was thinking. So B might be the correct answer.

Option C: Make better decisions but are less creative. That's the opposite of what I believe. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Less creative and less productive. I don't think heterogeneous groups are less productive. They might be more creative, so D is likely wrong.

Option E: More productive but worse at decision-making. Again, heterogeneous groups are more creative, not more productive. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Worse decisions but more productive. No, heterogeneous groups are better at decision-making, so F is wrong.

Option G: Less creative and worse at decision-making. That's the opposite. So G is wrong.

Option H: Make better decisions but less productive. No, H is incorrect.

Option I: Less creative but better at decision-making. No, that's the opposite of what I thought. So I is wrong.

Option J: More creative but less productive. No, I think heterogeneous groups are more creative. So J is incorrect.

So, reviewing, the only option that makes sense is B, which says heterogeneous groups are more creative and better at decision-making than homogeneous groups. That seems to fit with the reasoning I had earlier.

The correct answer is B: heterogeneous groups are more creative and better at decision-making than homogeneous groups.
