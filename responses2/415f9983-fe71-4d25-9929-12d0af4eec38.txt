Okay, so I've got this problem about a copper bar expanding when heated. Hmm, I remember that thermal expansion has something to do with how materials change in length when heated. Oh right, the formula is linear expansion. Let me think.

The formula for linear expansion is delta L equals alpha times L times delta T. So delta L is the change in length. The given values are... the initial length is 8.0 ft, right? The initial temperature is 68°F, and they heat it to 110°F. Oh wait, the temperature change is the final minus initial. So 110 - 68, which is 42°F. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think the linear expansion coefficient is given as 9.4 × 10^-6 per degree Fahrenheit. Yeah, right, the problem says that. So alpha is 9.4e-6 /°F.

So putting the numbers in, L is 8.0 ft, delta T is 42°F. So delta L is 9.4e-6 * 8.0 * 42. Let me compute that. Let's see, 9.4e-6 is 0.0000094. Multiply that by 8, that's 0.0000752. Then multiply by 42. 0.0000752 *42... let's see, 0.0000752 *40 is 0.003008, and 0.0000752 *2 is 0.0001504. So adding those together, 0.003008 + 0.0001504 = 0.0031584 ft. Hmm, wait but looking at the options, I see option A is 0.0032 ft, which is close.

Wait wait but hold on, let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I messed up the multiplication.

Alternatively, 9.4e-6 * 8.0 is 75.2e-6. Which is 0.0000752. Then multiplied by 42: 0.0000752 *42.

Let me do 752 *42 = let's see, 750 *42 is 31,500. Plus 2*42=84. So 31,584. So 752 *42 is 31,584. So 75.2e-6 *42 is 31,584e-6. Which is 0.031584. Wait wait no, wait 75.2e-6 is 0.0000752. Oh wait, I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait 9.4e-6 is 0.0000094. 0.0000094 *8 = 0.0000752. Multiply by 42: 0.0000752 *42 = 0.0031584 feet. Oh wait, 0.0031584 is approximately 0.00316, which is about 0.0032 when rounded to four decimal places. So the answer should be 0.0032 ft. Looking back at the options, option A is 0.0032 ft. So the correct answer is A.

But wait, wait a second. Let me make sure about the units. The linear expansion coefficient is given in Fahrenheit, and the temperature change is also in Fahrenheit. So the formula applies directly. So I think that's correct.

Wait, so the options: A is 0.0032, which is very close to 0.0031584. So the answer is A.

To determine the increase in length of the copper bar when heated, we use the formula for linear thermal expansion:

\[
\Delta L = \alpha \cdot L \cdot \Delta T
\]

### Given values:
- Initial length, \( L = 8.0 \, \text{ft} \)
- Initial temperature, \( T_i = 68^\circ \text{F} \)
- Final temperature, \( T_f = 110^\circ \text{F} \)
- Linear expansion coefficient, \( \alpha = 9.4 \times 10^{-6} /^\circ \text{F} \)
- Temperature change, \( \Delta T = T_f - T_i = 110 - 68 = 42^\circ \text{F} \)

### Calculation:
\[
\Delta L = (9.4 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot 8.0 \cdot 42
\]
First, calculate \( 9.4 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 8.0 \):
\[
9.4 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 8.0 = 0.0000752
\]
Then multiply by \( \Delta T = 42 \):
\[
0.0000752 \cdot 42 = 0.0031584 \, \text{ft}
\]

### Final result:
The increase in length is approximately \( 0.00316 \, \text{ft} \), which rounds to \( 0.0032 \, \text{ft} \).

### Correct answer:
The closest option is **A: 0.0032 ft**.
