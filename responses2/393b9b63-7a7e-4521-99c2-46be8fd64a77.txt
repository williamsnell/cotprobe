Okay, so I have this math problem here: If x minus 3 equals 6, what is the value of x? The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Hmm, let me think about how to solve this.

Alright, the equation is x minus 3 equals 6. So, in equation form, that's x - 3 = 6. To find the value of x, I should isolate it. That means I need to get rid of the -3 on the left side. How do I do that? Oh right, I can do the opposite operation. Since it's minus 3, I'll add 3 to both sides of the equation to keep it balanced.

So, if I add 3 to both sides, the left side becomes x because -3 plus 3 is zero. The right side is 6 plus 3, which is 9. So, that simplifies to x equals 9.

Wait, let me double-check. If I plug x = 9 back into the original equation, it should hold true. So, 9 minus 3 is 6. Yep, that's correct. So, the value of x is 9. Looking back at the options, option E is 9. So I should choose E.

The equation x − 3 = 6 can be solved by adding 3 to both sides, giving x = 9. The correct answer is E.

Answer: E
