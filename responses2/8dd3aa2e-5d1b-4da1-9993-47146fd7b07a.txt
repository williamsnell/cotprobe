Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the focal lengths of a glass lens in water and in air. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on optics, but let's think this through.

The question says the refractive indices are 1.5 for the glass and 1.33 for water. I remember that the refractive index relates to how much light slows down when entering a medium. And the focal length of a lens depends on the refractive index and the radii of curvature of the lens.

Wait, the problem is about a glass lens, so it's probably a thin lens. Oh right, thin lens formula. The formula I remember is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 + 1/R2), where n is the refractive index. But wait, that's for a thin lens, right? Or is it another formula? Oh, wait, maybe it's for a spherical lens. Or maybe it's about the lensmaker's equation.

Wait, the lensmaker's formula for a lens in air is 1/f = (n_lens - n_air) * (1/R1 + 1/R2). Since air is n_air = 1, this simplifies to (n - 1)(1/R1 + 1/R2), which is the same as I thought.

But the problem is about when the lens is submerged in water. So the refractive index of the surrounding medium changes. What's the refractive index of water? Oh, 1.33. So when the lens is in water, the new refractive index for the lens is n = 1.5, but the surrounding is n_water = 1.33.

Wait, but the lensmaker's formula needs the refractive index of the lens relative to the surrounding medium. So when the lens is in air, the surrounding is n_air (1), and when in water, the surrounding is n_water (1.33). But wait, this is where I get a bit confused. For the lensmaker's equation, the term is (n_lens - n_surround), where n_lens is the refractive index of the lens material. So when the lens is in air, n_surround is 1 (n_air), so the term is (1.5 - 1) = 0.5. When it's in water, n_surround is 1.33, so the term becomes (1.5 - 1.33) = 0.17.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the focal lengths when the lens is in water to when it's in air. Let's call f_water the focal length in water and f_air the one in air. The ratio is f_water / f_air.

Since f = 1/( (n_lens - n_surround) (1/R1 + 1/R2) ), the ratio would be (1/( (n - 1.33)(1/R1 + 1/R2) )) divided by (1/( (n -1)(1/R1 + 1/R2) )) ). Wait, but wait, the 1/R1 +1/R2 term (the curvature part) would be the same for both cases because the radii are the same. So when you divide, the (1/R1 +1/R2) terms cancel out, leaving (n_air/(n_water - n_air))? Wait, no, let's re-express this.

Wait, the focal length in air is f_air = 1/( (n - 1) * (sum of 1/R terms) )
f_water = 1/( (n - 1.33) * (same sum) )

So the ratio is f_water / f_air = [1/( (n-1.33) * sum ) ] / [1/( (n-1) * sum ) ] = (n-1)/(n-1.33)

Because the sum is in denominator for both, so it cancels out.

So substituting n = 1.5,

(n-1) = 0.5
(n-1.33) = 0.17

So ratio = 0.5 / 0.17 = approximately 2.94. Wait, let me calculate that. 0.5 divided by 0.17. Let's compute:

0.17 * 2 = 0.34 → 0.5 - 0.34 = 0.16 left. 0.17 * 0.94 = 0.16, so 2 + 0.94 ≈ 2.94.

So the ratio is approximately 2.94. Looking at the options, option I is 3.91, option D is 2.75, and option H is 1.5. Hmm, none of them exactly 2.94. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Oh, wait, the lensmaker's equation for a lens in a medium is (n_lens - n_medium) * (1/R1 + 1/R2) in the denominator. So for air, it's (1.5 - 1) = 0.5, and for water, (1.5 - 1.33) = 0.17.

So f_air = 1/(0.5 * (sum))
f_water = 1/(0.17 * (sum))

Ratio f_water / f_air = (1/(0.17 * sum)) / (1/(0.5 * sum)) ) = (0.5)/(0.17) ≈ 2.94.

Wait, but the options given are:

Options: A to J.

Looking back, the options are A:2.50, B:0.89, C:2.23, D:2.75, E:4.5, F:0.75, G:1.11, H:1.5, I:3.91, J:1.33.

Hmm, none of these match 2.94. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the focal lengths of the lens in water to that in air. Let me re-express the ratio:

(f_water)/(f_air) = [1/( (n_water - n_water_medium) * ... ) ] / [1/( (n_air - n_water) * ... ) ]

Wait, wait, no. The lensmaker's formula is 1/f = (n_lens - n_medium) (1/R1 + 1/R2). So when the lens is in air, n_medium is 1. So (n-1) as the coefficient. When it's in water, the surrounding is 1.33, so (n - 1.33) is the coefficient.

So f_water = 1/( (n - 1.33) * (sum) )

f_air = 1/( (n - 1) * (sum) )

So the ratio f_water / f_air = ( (n - 1) * sum ) / ( (n - 1.33) * sum ) )

Which simplifies to (n-1)/(n -1.33) → same as before.

n=1.5, so 0.5 / 0.17 → approximately 2.94.

Hmm. So none of the options exactly match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation or perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of the focal lengths in air to water, which would be 1/2.94, which is about 0.34. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let me think again.

Another way: The focal length of a lens in a medium is f = f0 / (n_medium - n_lens), where f0 is the focal length in vacuum. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to compare the focal lengths when the lens is in air and in water.

The focal length in air, f_air = 1/( (n - 1) * (1/R1 + 1/R2) )

In water, the surrounding medium is n_water = 1.33, so the term is (n - n_water), so f_water = 1/( (n -1.33) * (1/R1 + 1/R2) )

So the ratio f_water / f_air = [1/( (n-1.33) * S ) ] / [1/( (n-1)*S ) ] → (n-1)/(n-1.33)

Which is 0.5/0.17 = 2.942857...

Hmm, none of the options match this exactly. Let's look at the options again:

Options:
A:2.50
B:0.89
C:2.23
D:2.75
E:4.5
F:0.75
G:1.11
H:1.5
I:3.91
J:1.33

Hmm, option I is 3.91, which is about 2.94 + 1, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe I should be using the reciprocal. Like, perhaps the formula is f = (1/( (n - n_medium) ) * (1/R1 + 1/R2) )

Wait, no, the lensmaker's formula is 1/f = (n_lens - n_medium) (1/R1 + 1/R2). 

So when the lens is in air (n_medium=1), 1/f_air = (1.5 -1) * (sum) → 0.5 * sum.

When in water, 1.5 -1.33=0.17 → 1/f_water = 0.17 * sum.

So 1/f_water = (0.17 sum) → 1/f_water = (0.17/0.5) * (1/f_air )

Because 0.17 is (n - n_water) = 1.5-1.33=0.17.

So 1/f_water = (0.17/0.5) * (1/f_air) → this is because 1/f_air = 0.5 * sum, so sum = (1/f_air) / 0.5.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's consider the ratio of the focal lengths f_water / f_air.

1/f_water = (n - n_water) * sum → sum = 1/(f_water (n - n_water) )

1/f_air = (n -n_air) * sum → sum = 1/(f_air (n -n_air) )

Since sum is same, equate:

1/(f_water (n -n_water) ) = 1/(f_air (n -n_air) )

→ f_water / f_air = (n -n_air) / (n -n_water )

Plugging the numbers:

n =1.5, n_air=1, n_water=1.33.

→ (1.5 -1)/(1.5 -1.33) → 0.5 / 0.17 → 2.94285...

So the ratio f_water / f_air ≈2.94.

But none of the options gives this. The closest option is I, which is 3.91. Hmm, but that's not exactly matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait! No, I think the formula is correct. Wait, perhaps I confused the ratio. Let me think: if the ratio is f_water / f_air, then that's ( (n -1.33) )/( (n -1) ), which is 0.5/0.17≈2.94.

Hmm. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't any of them, but let me recheck the problem statement.

Wait, the question says, 'the ratio of the focal lengths of a glass lens in water and in air'. So the glass lens is submerged into water. So the term is (n_glass - n_water) / (n_glass - n_air), which is (1.5 -1.33)/(1.5-1) = (0.17) / (0.5) = 0.34. So the ratio is 0.34? Or is it the reciprocal?

Wait, wait, no. Because the ratio is f_water / f_air. So if 1/f_water = (n_glass -n_water) * sum → f_water = 1 / [ (n_glass -n_water) * sum ]

Similarly, f_air = 1/[ (n_glass -n_air) * sum ]

So ratio f_water / f_air = [1/( (n -n_water) ) ] / [1/( (n -n_air) ) ] → (n -n_air)/(n -n_water) → (1.5-1)/(1.5-1.33) → 0.5 / 0.17 → 2.94.

Yes, that's correct. So none of the options exactly match 2.94. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking back, the options are A to J, including I: 3.91 and H:1.5. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think: perhaps I should have considered the refractive index of the surrounding medium as the other way around?

Wait, no. The formula uses (n_glass - n_medium), where n_medium is 1 for air, 1.33 for water.

Wait, maybe I should try plugging the numbers again.

n_glass =1.5, n_water=1.33.

So f_water = 1/( (1.5 - 1.33) * sum ) = 1/(0.17 sum).

f_air = 1/( (1.5 -1) * sum ) = 1/(0.5 sum).

So f_water/f_air = (1/(0.17 sum )) / (1/(0.5 sum )) → (0.5)/(0.17) ≈ 2.94.

Hmm, but again, this is not an option.

Wait, maybe the question is the reciprocal, like f_air / f_water. That would be (0.5)/(0.17)=2.94, which is same as before.

But none of the options match. So this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the same radii of curvature. Oh wait, but in lensmaker's formula, the sum (1/R1 +1/R2) is the same for both cases (assuming same curvature radii). So when you take the ratio, the sum cancels out, leaving (n_air)/(n_water - n_air). Wait, no, when I think about it, the ratio is (n_air)/(n_water - n_air).

Wait, n_air is 1, so n_air/(n_water - n_air) = 1/(1.33 -1 )=1/0.33≈3.03.

Wait, that could be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n_water)/(n_air - n_water), but that would be 1.33/(1 -1.33)= negative, which doesn't make sense, because focal length is positive in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the ratio (n_water)/(n_air).

Wait, no, n_water is 1.33 and n_air is 1. So 1.33/1=1.33, which is option J.

Wait, but that doesn't fit with the previous approach which gave 2.94. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the formula is (n_water)/(n_air). So 1.33/1=1.33. But option J is 1.33, which would be the reciprocal of the ratio I'm looking for.

Wait, no, wait. Because the ratio f_water/f_air is 2.94, which is approximately 3. So perhaps the intended answer is option I:3.91, but that's 2.94 * 1.33? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the focal length of the lens in water being more than in air, which would make sense because when you're in water, it's less dense than air, so the focal length would be longer (less converging, more diverging, so longer focal length). So in air, the lens is denser than water, so the focal length is shorter. So the ratio f_water/f_air is greater than 1.

Wait, 2.94 is greater than 1, which makes sense.

But the options don't have this number. So am I missing a step somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the refractive indices in the opposite way. Like, using the refractive index of the medium surrounding the lens, which is water when in water and air when in air. So when the lens is in air, n_medium is 1, and when it's in water, n_medium is 1.33.

Then the formula for focal length in air is f0 = (1/( (n_lens - n_air) )) * (1/R1 +1/R2) → f0 = 1/( (1.5 -1) ) * (1/R1 +1/R2) → 1/(0.5) * sum = 2 * sum.

In water, f_water = 1/( (n_lens - n_water) ) * sum → 1/(0.17) * sum ≈5.882 * sum.

So the ratio f_water/f_air = (5.882 sum ) / (2 sum ) = 5.882/2 = 2.94, same as before.

But again, the options don't include this. So perhaps the correct approach is to compare the ratio (n_water)/(n_air - n_water) → which is 1.33/(1-1.33) → 1.33/( -0.33 )= -3.999. But that's negative, and focal lengths are positive, so perhaps absolute value is 3.999, which is approximately option I (3.91). Hmm, that's close.

But wait, the ratio f_water/f_air is 2.94, but the options have I:3.91. So perhaps the intended answer is option I, but that's not matching exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal. So if the ratio of f_water to f_air is 2.94, then the ratio of f_air to f_water would be 1/2.94≈0.34. But none of the options give that.

Wait, the only way I can get 2.94 is when the ratio is (n_water)/(n_air - n_water) = 1.33/(1 -1.33) =1.33/(-0.33)= approx -3.99, which is about -4.00, but the options don't have that.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the focal length in water compared to in air, but using the reciprocal in the formula. Wait, when the lens is in water, it's n_water =1.33, so the term is (n_lens - n_water) =1.5-1.33=0.17. When in air, it's 0.5.

So the ratio f_water/f_air = (n_air - n_water)/(n_lens - n_water) → (1-1.33)/(1.5-1.33) → (-0.33)/(0.17) → approx -1.94. Taking absolute, 1.94.

But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used (n_water)/(n_air - n_water) → 1.33/(1 -1.33) = 1.33/-0.33 = -4.03. Taking absolute, 4.03, which is close to option E (4.5). But that's not exact.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A:2.50

B:0.89

C:2.23

D:2.75

E:4.5

F:0.75

G:1.11

H:1.5

I:3.91

J:1.33

Wait, option I is 3.91. So perhaps the question is about the ratio f_water / f_air, which is approximately 2.94, and the closest option is I (3.91). But why would that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: The focal length of a lens in a medium is given by f = f0 / (n_medium - n_lens), where f0 is the focal length in a vacuum. So f0 is 1/( (n_lens - n_air) ) → when in air, f_air = f0 / (n_lens -n_air) = 1/( (1.5-1) ) = 2.

When the lens is in water, f_water = f0_water/(n_lens -n_water) → f0_water = 1/( (1.5 -1.33) )= 1/(0.17)=5.882.

So f_water=5.882/(1.5-1.33)=5.882/0.17≈34.95.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait. Let me correct this.

Wait, the formula is f = f0 / (n_medium - n_lens), so f_water = f0_water / (n_water - n_lens).

f0_water → when in air, f0_air =1/(n_lens -n_air) → 1/(1.5-1)=1/0.5=2.

So when in water, f_water = f0_water / (n_water -n_lens) → 2/(1.33-1.5) → 2/( -0.17 )= -11.76.

But focal length is a positive quantity, so the magnitude is 11.76. But that's way higher than any of the options.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should just proceed with the initial approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe I confused the formula and should have used (n_water - n_air) instead of (n_lens - n_air). But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (n_lens - n_medium) for the term, so the denominator is (n_lens -n_medium) * (1/R1 +1/R2). So when in air, (n_lens -1) * sum = 0.5 * sum.

When in water, (n_lens -1.33) * sum = 0.17 * sum.

So 1/f_air =0.5 * sum, 1/f_water=0.17 * sum.

So the ratio f_water/f_air = (0.5 sum) / (0.17 sum) ) → 0.5/0.17=2.94.

So the ratio is approximately 2.94, and the closest option is I:3.91.

But that's not exact. So perhaps I should think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the ratio. Hmm.

Wait, 0.5 divided by 0.17 is the same as (5/1) / (17/100) → no, perhaps I should compute it as (5/17) → 0.2941. Wait, no, 0.5 is 5/10, 0.17 is 17/100. So 5/10 divided by 17/100 is (5/10) * (100/17) )= (5 *100)/(10 *17) )=500/(170)=50/17≈2.941.

So the ratio is approximately 2.941, which is not exactly any option, but option I is 3.91.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the ratio is (n_water)/(n_air). Wait, n_water is 1.33, n_air is 1. So 1.33/1=1.33. Which is option J.

But according to the earlier calculation, the ratio is 2.94, which would be the reciprocal of 1.33 (since 1.33 * 2.94 ≈4.1), but that's not an option either.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should move to the conclusion. Given that the ratio is approximately 2.94, and the closest option is I:3.91, perhaps that's the intended answer. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the ratio is (n_water)/(n_air), which is 1.33/1=1.33, so option J.

But according to the calculations, the correct ratio is approximately 2.94, so none of the options match exactly. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is I:3.91. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup of the lensmaker's formula. Maybe the formula is (n_lens - n_medium) * (1/R1 + 1/R2), and the reciprocal is 1/f = (n_lens -n_medium) (1/R1 +1/R2). But perhaps I should have used the formula in reverse.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the focal length in a medium is f = f0/n, where f0 is the focal length in a vacuum. So f0 = 1/(n_lens -n_air). So in air, f_air = f0/(n_lens -n_air). But no, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the correct formula is 1/f = (n_lens - n_medium) (1/R1 +1/R2), so the ratio f_water/f_air is ( (n_lens -n_air) )/( (n_lens -n_water) ), which is 1/(n_water/(n_air -n_water) ) → wait, no.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n_medium_air) / (n_medium_water). No, that doesn't fit.

I think I'm stuck. Given that, I'll proceed to select the closest option, which is I:3.91, even though it doesn't match the exact calculation.
</think>

To determine the ratio of the focal lengths of a glass lens in water and in air, we use the lensmaker's formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = (n_{\text{lens}} - n_{\text{medium}}) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)
\]

Here, \(n_{\text{lens}} = 1.5\), \(n_{\text{air}} = 1\), and \(n_{\text{water}} = 1.33\). The radii of curvature \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) are the same for both cases, so they cancel out in the ratio.

### Step 1: Focal length in air (\(f_{\text{air}}\))
For air (\(n_{\text{medium}} = 1\)):

\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{air}}} = (1.5 - 1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right) = 0.5 \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)
\]

Let \(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} = S\). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{air}}} = 0.5 S \quad \Rightarrow \quad f_{\text{air}} = \frac{1}{0.5 S} = \frac{2}{S}
\]

### Step 2: Focal length in water (\(f_{\text{water}}\))
For water (\(n_{\text{medium}} = 1.33\)):

\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{water}}} = (1.5 - 1.33) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right) = 0.17 S
\]

Thus:

\[
f_{\text{water}} = \frac{1}{0.17 S} \approx 5.882 \cdot \frac{1}{S}
\]

### Step 3: Ratio of focal lengths
The ratio \(f_{\text{water}} / f_{\text{air}}\) is:

\[
\frac{f_{\text{water}}}{f_{\text{air}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{0.17 S}}{\frac{1}{0.5 S}} = \frac{0.5}{0.17} \approx 2.94
\]

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated ratio is approximately \(2.94\), but none of the options exactly match this value. The closest option is **I: 3.91**, which is approximately \(1.33 \times 2.94\). However, this does not directly correspond to the correct ratio.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations, the ratio of the focal lengths is approximately \(2.94\), but since this value is not among the options, the closest match is **I: 3.91**. 

ANSWER: I
