Okay, so I have this problem where I need to round the number 0.1476 to different decimal places and then choose the correct option from A to J. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand the question. They want me to round 0.1476 to three parts: two decimal places, three decimal places, and one decimal place. Then, I have to pick the right options from the given choices A to J. Each option has parts (a), (b), and (c), which correspond to the rounded numbers for each of the three decimal places.

Let me start by rounding to two decimal places. So, 0.1476. The first two decimals are 0.14, the next digit is 7. Wait, no—wait, wait, wait. Wait, when rounding, the rule is to look at the digit after the place you're rounding to. So for two decimal places, we look at the third decimal.

So, the number is 0.1476. The third decimal digit is 7. So when rounding to two decimals, the second decimal is 4. If the third digit is 7, which is 5 or above, we round up. So 0.14 becomes 0.15. Wait, no, wait—no, wait, wait, wait. No, wait, wait, wait. Wait, the third digit is 7. So when you have 0.14 (two decimals), the third is 7, which is more than 5, so you add 1 to the second decimal. The second decimal is 4, so adding 1 gives 5. So 0.15 when rounded to two decimals.

So part (a) is .15. Let me check the options. Looking at options A to J, which option has (a) as .15? Let me see.

Option A: (a) .15 → yes, that's a match. (b) 0.148, that's 0.148, but wait, how does that happen? Wait, when I round to three decimals, I think that's another point.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is for three decimal places and one decimal place as well. So let me proceed.

Part (b) is rounding to three decimal places. So 0.1476 has the fourth decimal digit as 6. So for three decimals, we look at the fourth digit, which is 6. Since 6 is greater than or equal to 5, we round up the third decimal. The third decimal is 7, so adding 1 gives 8. So 0.148 becomes 0.148 when rounded to three decimal places. So part (b) is .148, which is option B's (b) part. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option B has (b) .148. So that seems correct so far.

Part (c) is rounding to one decimal place. So 0.1476. The first decimal is 1, the second is 4, third is 7, fourth is 6. Wait, so when rounding to one decimal, we look at the second decimal (4) and see what the third digit is. The third digit is 7, which is 5 or more, so we round up the 4 to 5. So 0.1476 becomes 0.15 when rounded to one decimal place. So part (c) is .15. Looking at the options, which one has (c) as .15? Let's see:

Option A: (c) .1 → no. Option B: (c) .14 → no. Option C: (c) .2 → no. Option D: (c) .14 → no. Option E: (c) .15 → yes, that's correct. Option F: (c) .2 → no. Option G: (c) .2 → no. Option H: (c) .1 → no. Option I: (c) .1 → no. Option J: (c) .15 → yes.

Wait, so (c) could be either Option A or Option J. But looking at the options, each option's (c) is one option only. So let me check the options again.

Looking at the choices:

A: (c) .1 → no.

B: (c) .14 → no.

C: (c) .2 → no.

D: (c) .14 → no.

E: (c) .15 → yes.

F: (c) .2 → no.

G: (c) .2 → no.

H: (c) .1 → no.

I: (c) .1 → no.

J: (c) .15 → yes.

So both E and J have (c) as .15. Hmm, but each option is a separate choice—each letter corresponds to a single option. So both E and J have (c) .15, but that's unlikely because each option is a single choice. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck. 0.1476: when rounding to one decimal place, the first decimal is 1, the next is 4. So 0.14... so the next digit is 7. Wait, no, wait, the first decimal is 1, the second is 4, the third is 7. So when rounding to one decimal, you look at the second decimal to decide whether to round up the first. The second decimal is 4, and the third digit is 7. Wait, wait, no. Wait, when rounding to one decimal place, you look at the first decimal place, and the next digit (the second decimal) to decide. So the first decimal is 1, the second is 4, the third is 7, and the fourth is 6. Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm confusing the places. Let me write it out.

Number: 0.1476

Rounding to one decimal place: look at the tenths place (1), and the next digit is 4. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, to round to one decimal place, we look at the second decimal place to decide. So the number is 0.1476, the first decimal is 1, the second is 4, the third is 7. So when rounding to one decimal place, we look at the second decimal (4) and the third digit (7). Wait, wait, no, no, wait. When rounding to one decimal place, you look at the first decimal and the next digit (the second decimal) to decide. So the first decimal is 1, the second is 4. The third digit is 7, which is beyond the second decimal for rounding to one decimal? No, that's not right. No, wait, to round to one decimal place, you look at the second decimal place. So if the second decimal is 4, then the third digit (which is 7) is beyond that. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the place value. For one decimal place, you're looking at the tenths place. The rule is to look at the hundredths place to decide whether to round up the tenths place.

So 0.1476 → the tenths place is 1, the hundredths is 4. So since the hundredths digit is 4 (less than 5), we don't round up. So 0.1476 rounded to one decimal place is 0.1. So part (c) is .1. So looking back at the options, which letter has (c) as .1?

Looking at the options:

A: (c) .1 → yes.

B: (c) .14.

C: (c) .2.

D: (c) .14.

E: (c) .15.

F: (c) .2.

G: (c) .2.

H: (c) .1.

I: (c) .1.

J: (c) .15.

So both A and E have (c) as .1. But in the options, each letter corresponds to a single option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to choose all that apply, but I don't think so. Let me check the question again.

No, the question is asking to select the correct option (A to J), each of which is a triplet of (a), (b), (c) parts. So each option is a unique combination. So, for part (c), only E and A have it as .1. But wait, that can't be right because each option is a single answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in the rounding for part (c).

Wait, let me double-check. 0.1476. When rounding to one decimal place, we look at the second decimal digit (4) and the third (7). Wait, no. Wait, the first decimal is 1, the second is 4, the third is 7, the fourth is 6. So, to round to one decimal place, we look at the second decimal digit. The second is 4, and the next digit (third) is 7. So 7 is greater than or equal to 5, so we round up the second decimal digit. The second decimal is 4, so adding 1 makes it 5. So the number becomes 0.15. So part (c) is .15. So the correct options for (c) would be E and J. But how can that be, because each option is a single letter, so each option has a unique (c) value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the options. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (c) .1 → yes.

Option E: (c) .15 → yes.

So both A and E have (c) as .1 or .15. But each option is a single option, so perhaps only one of them is correct. Wait, but the question is, which option is correct when all parts are correct. So perhaps I need to check each part for each option.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: (a) .15 → correct? Because when rounded to two decimals, it should be .15. Yes.

(b) .148 → correct? Rounded to three decimals, 0.1476 → 0.148. Yes.

(c) .1 → correct? Rounded to one decimal, 0.15, so .1 is incorrect. So option A is incorrect because (c) is wrong.

Option B: (a) .15 → correct.

(b) .147 → correct.

(c) .2 → incorrect (should be .15, so (c) is wrong).

Option C: (a) .14 → no.

Option D: (a) .14 → no.

Option E: (a) .15 → correct.

(b) .148 → correct.

(c) .15 → correct.

Option F: (a) .14 → no.

Option G: (a) .15 → correct.

(b) .147 → correct.

(c) .2 → no.

Option H: (a) .15 → correct.

(b) .148 → correct.

(c) .1 → no.

Option I: (a) .14 → no.

Option J: (a) .14 → no.

Option K: Not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should go through each option step by step.

Option A:

(a) 0.1476 rounded to two decimals: 0.15 → yes.

(b) Rounded to three decimals: 0.148 → yes.

(c) Rounded to one decimal: 0.1 → no.

So option A is incorrect because (c) is wrong.

Option B:

(a) .15 → correct.

(b) .147 → correct.

(c) .2 → incorrect.

So option B is wrong.

Option C:

(a) .14 → no.

Option D:

(a) .14 → no.

Option E:

(a) .15 → correct.

(b) 0.1476 → rounded to three decimals. Let's see: 0.1476, the fourth digit is 6. So when rounding to three decimals, we look at the fourth digit. Since it's 6 ≥5, we round up the third decimal. Third is 7 → 8. So 0.148 → correct.

(c) .15 → correct.

So E is correct.

Option F:

(a) .14 → no.

Options G:

(a) .15 → correct.

(b) .147 → correct.

(c) .2 → no.

So G is incorrect.

Option H:

(a) .15 → correct.

(b) 0.148 → correct.

(c) .1 → no.

So H is incorrect.

Option I:

(a) .14 → no.

Option J:

(a) .14 → no.

(b) 0.147 → correct.

(c) .15 → correct.

So J is correct.

Wait, so both E and J have all correct parts except for (c) in E and (c) in J. But each option is a single choice, so perhaps I'm making a mistake. Wait, no, each option is selected as a triplet, and each triplet is a choice. So perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in some of the calculations.

Let me check each option's parts one by one again.

Option E:

(a) 0.1476 to two decimals: 0.15 → correct.

(b) Three decimals: 0.148 → correct.

(c) One decimal: 0.15 → correct.

So E is correct.

Option J:

(a) 0.1476 to two decimals: 0.15 → correct.

(b) 0.1476 to three decimals: 0.148 → correct.

(c) 0.1476 to one decimal: 0.1 → no. So J is incorrect.

Wait, that's a problem because earlier I thought E and J were correct, but perhaps J's (c) is wrong.

Wait, let me re-calculate J's (c) part.

J: (a) .14 → no, because it's 0.1476, so when rounded to two decimals, the third digit is 7 which is ≥5, so we add 1 to the second decimal. So 0.14 becomes 0.15. So (a) is wrong. So J cannot be correct.

So only option E has all correct parts. So the correct answer is E.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, we round the number 0.1476 to the specified decimal places:

1. **Two decimal places**: Look at the third decimal (7). Since it is ≥5, we round up the second decimal (4) to 5. Result: 0.15.
2. **Three decimal places**: Look at the fourth decimal (6). Since it is ≥5, we round up the third decimal (7) to 8. Result: 0.148.
3. **One decimal place**: Look at the second decimal (4). Since the third decimal (7) is ≥5, we round up the second decimal to 5. Result: 0.1.

Now, evaluate each option:

- **Option A**: (a) .15 (correct), (b) .148 (correct), (c) .1 (incorrect). → Incorrect.
- **Option B**: (a) .15 (correct), (b) .147 (correct), (c) .2 (incorrect). → Incorrect.
- **Option C**: (a) .14 (incorrect), (b) .148 (correct), (c) .2 (incorrect). → Incorrect.
- **Option D**: (a) .14 (incorrect), (b) .147 (correct), (c) .14 (incorrect). → Incorrect.
- **Option E**: (a) .15 (correct), (b) .148 (correct), (c) .15 (correct). → Correct.
- **Option F**: (a) .14 (incorrect), (b) .147 (correct), (c) .2 (incorrect). → Incorrect.
- **Option G**: (a) .15 (correct), (b) .147 (correct), (c) .2 (incorrect). → Incorrect.
- **Option H**: (a) .15 (correct), (b) .148 (correct), (c) .1 (incorrect). → Incorrect.
- **Option I**: (a) .14 (incorrect), (b) .148 (correct), (c) .1 (incorrect). → Incorrect.
- **Option J**: (a) .14 (incorrect), (b) .147 (correct), (c) .15 (correct). → Incorrect.

Only **Option E** has all three parts correctly rounded.
