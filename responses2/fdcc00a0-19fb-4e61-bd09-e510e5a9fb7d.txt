Okay, I've got this problem where I need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 10236 and 244 using the Euclidean algorithm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember how it works.

So, the Euclidean algorithm is a method to find the gcd of two numbers by repeatedly applying division. I think the steps are something like this: divide the larger number by the smaller, take the remainder, and then repeat the process with the smaller number and the remainder until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the gcd.

Let me write down the numbers: 10236 and 244. Since 10236 is larger than 244, I'll start by dividing 10236 by 244.

Wait, but 244 is a pretty big number. Let me see if I can simplify this. Maybe I can find a way to make the division easier. Oh right, I remember that the gcd of two numbers is the same as the gcd of the smaller number and the remainder when the larger is divided by the smaller.

So, 10236 divided by 244. Let me compute that. 244 times 40 is 9760. Subtracting that from 10236 gives 10236 - 9760 = 476. Hmm, wait, wait, 244 times 40 is 9760. 244 * 40 = 9760. So 10236 - 9760 = 476. So the remainder is 476.

So now, the problem reduces to finding gcd(244, 476). But wait, 476 is still larger than 244, right? No, wait, 244 is smaller than 476, so I should do 476 divided by 244. Let me compute that.

244 times 1 is 244, subtract that from 476 gives 232. So the remainder is 232. Now, I need to find gcd(244, 232).

Next step: 244 divided by 232. 232 goes once into 244, which gives 232. Subtracting that leaves a remainder of 12. So now, find gcd(232, 12).

232 divided by 12. Let's see, 12*19 is 228. Subtracting that from 232 gives 4. So the remainder is 4. Now, we have to find gcd(12, 4).

12 divided by 4 is exactly 3, with 0 remainder. So the gcd is 4. 

Wait a minute, but let me go through all the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First step: 10236 ÷ 244 → quotient 40, remainder 476. So gcd(244, 476).
Second step: 476 ÷ 244 → quotient 1, remainder 232. So gcd(244, 232).
Third step: 244 ÷ 232 → quotient 1, remainder 12. So gcd(232, 12).
Fourth step: 232 ÷ 12 → quotient 19, remainder 4. So gcd(12, 4).
Fifth step: 12 ÷4 → quotient 3, remainder 0. So gcd is 4.

Yes, that seems correct. So the gcd of 10236 and 244 is 4. Looking at the options, option G is 4. So the answer should be G.

The last character of the answer must be the letter chosen. The correct answer is 4, which corresponds to option G.
