Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me. It's about two mathematical statements regarding group theory, and I need to figure out which ones are true or false. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's read the statements carefully.

Statement 1: Some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10.

Statement 2: A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H.

I remember that in group theory, Lagrange's theorem tells us that the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. So for Statement 1, the group has order 45. Let's factor that: 45 is 9 * 5, which is 3^2 * 5. The order of the subgroup is 10, which factors into 2 * 5. Wait, but 10 doesn't divide 45 because 45 divided by 10 is 4.5, which isn't an integer. So according to Lagrange's theorem, such a subgroup can't exist because the order of H (10) doesn't divide the order of G (45). So Statement 1 is saying that there exists a group of order 45 with a subgroup of order 10, which can't be right. Therefore, Statement 1 must be False.

Now, onto Statement 2. It says that a subgroup H is normal in G if and only if the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets. Hmm. I remember that the number of left cosets of H in G is equal to the index [G:H], which is the same as the number of right cosets. So the number of left cosets is always equal to the number of right cosets, regardless of whether H is normal or not. Because whether H is normal affects whether the left and right cosets are the same, but the counts are always the same. So the statement is asserting that normality is equivalent to the equality of left and right cosets. But that's not correct. The equivalence would only hold if H were a normal subgroup, but the statement says "if and only if." So when H is normal, the left and right cosets are the same, and in that case, the number of left and right cosets would be the same. But the converse isn't true—equality of numbers doesn't imply normality. So Statement 2 is False.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The number of left cosets is equal to the number of right cosets for any subgroup H of G, because the index [G:H] is the same whether you take left or right cosets. So Statement 2 is claiming that H normal ↔ left cosets count equals right cosets count. But actually, H is normal if and only if the left and right cosets coincide (i.e., there's only one coset). But the counts themselves (the number of cosets) are the same in any case. So the implication is that the number of left and right cosets being equal is always true, regardless of normality. So the statement is saying that H is normal exactly when the numbers are equal. But that's not the case. The numbers are equal whether H is normal or not. So the statement is incorrect because the equality of numbers doesn't require H to be normal. The correct condition is that the number of cosets is equal, which is always true regardless of normality. So Statement 2 is False.

Wait, wait again. Wait, no, let me clarify. The standard definition: A subgroup H is normal in G if and only if for every element g in G, gHg^{-1} = H. That's the definition. But when H is normal, all its left and right cosets coincide. So the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets in any case, because the index is the same. So Statement 2 is asserting that H is normal ⇨ number of left = number of right. But that's not correct. Because H is normal implies that the left and right cosets are equal. But the equivalence is that H is normal ⇨ left cosets = right cosets. But that's always true. So the statement is saying that H is normal if and only if the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets. But the latter is always true regardless of normality. So the 'if and only if' is flawed. So Statement 2 is False.

So Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is False. Looking back at the options, that's option F: True, True. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, F says True, True. But according to my analysis, both are False. So which option matches both being false?

Looking at the options:

A: True, False

B: False, False

C: True, False

D: False, True

E: True, True

F: True, True

G: True, False

H: False, True

I think I might have made a mistake in my analysis. Let me double-check.

Wait, no. For Statement 1, the order of the group is 45, the order of the subgroup is 10. 10 doesn't divide 45, so Statement 1 is False.

Statement 2: The statement says that H is normal if and only if the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets. But as I thought, the number of left and right cosets is always the same, regardless of normality. So the equality holds for every subgroup regardless of normality. So the 'if and only if' is incorrect. Because H is not necessarily normal if the number of left and right cosets are equal. So the condition is automatically satisfied, but that doesn't mean that it's equivalent to H being normal. So the statement is false.

So both statements are false. Looking at the options, that's option B: False, False.

Wait, but the options labeled:

Option F is "True, True".

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about Statement 2. The statement is "A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H." Wait, but the number of left cosets is the index [G:H], and same for right cosets. So the number of left and right cosets are always equal. So the statement is saying that H is normal if and only if [G:H] equals [G:H], which is always true. So the 'if and only if' is not correct. The condition is always true, but that doesn't mean H is normal. So H could be normal, but the equality would still hold. So the equivalence is not correct because H can be normal without being normal (which is impossible). Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the 'if and only if' in the statement implies that the equality of left and right cosets is a necessary and sufficient condition for H being normal. Which is incorrect. Because H is normal if and only if H is a normal subgroup, which is the same as H being a subgroup for which left and right cosets coincide, but the numbers of cosets are always the same because [G:H] is the same whether you take left or right. So the number of left and right cosets being equal is always true, regardless of whether H is normal. So the equality is always true, but it doesn't imply normality. So the if and only if is incorrect. Therefore, Statement 2 is False.

So both statements are False. So the answer should be option B: False, False.
</think>

The analysis shows that both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false. Statement 1's order of the group (45) doesn't allow a subgroup of order 10 (which requires 10 to divide 45, which it doesn't). Statement 2 incorrectly claims that the equality of left and right cosets is equivalent to normality, which isn't the case as normality doesn't affect the count of cosets.

Answer: B: False, False
