Alright, so I have this Laplace transform problem to solve. The question is to find the inverse Laplace transform of 1 divided by [s(s² + 4)] using convolution. Hmm, okay, I remember that Laplace transforms and their inverses are all about matching the transforms to known functions. But convolution is a bit tricky for me, so I need to think carefully.

Wait, the function is 1/(s(s² +4)). Maybe I can break this into partial fractions first. Let me try that. So, 1/(s(s² +4)) can be written as A/s + (Bs + C)/(s² +4). Multiplying both sides by s(s² +4) gives 1 = A(s² +4) + (Bs + C)s. Expanding that, 1 = A s² +4A + B s² + C s. Combining like terms: (A + B)s² + C s + 4A = 1.

Since this must hold for all s, each coefficient must match. So A + B = 0 (for s²), C = 0 (for s), and 4A = 1 (constant term). Solving these: 4A=1 → A=1/4. Then, A + B =0 → B = -A = -1/4. And C=0. So the partial fractions are (1/4)/s + ( (-1/4)s + 0 ) / (s² +4). So,

1/(s(s² +4)) = (1/4)[1/s + (-s/4)/(s²+4)].

Wait, but maybe I should re-express that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the partial fractions. Let me double-check. 

Wait, another approach: I recall that the inverse Laplace of 1/s is a step function, which is a unit step. And the inverse Laplace of 1/(s² + a²) is (1/a) sin(at), and similar for other terms. But I'm supposed to use convolution here.

Hmm, so convolution theorem says that L^{-1}[F(s)G(s)] = (f * g)(t), where * is convolution. So maybe I can split the function 1/(s(s² +4)) into two parts and take their convolution.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps each term can be expressed as a product of simpler terms. Let me think. Oh, wait, I remember that 1/(s(s² + 4)) can be expressed as (1/4)(1/s) - (1/4)(s/(s²+4)).

Because, 1/(s(s²+4)) = (1/4)(1/s) - (1/4)(s/(s²+4)). Let me verify: (1/4)(1/s) is 1/(4s), and (1/4)(s/(s²+4)) is (1/4)*s/(s²+4). So when I subtract these, I get [1/(4s) - (1/4)(s/(s²+4)) ] = [ (s²+4) - s^2 ] / [4s(s²+4) ) ] → (4) / [4s(s²+4) )) ] → 1/(s(s²+4)). So that works.

So, L^{-1} of each part would be: L^{-1}(1/(4s)) is (1/4)u(t), where u(t) is the unit step function. And L^{-1}(s/(s²+4)) is cos(2t), right? Because L{cos(2t)} is s/(s² +4). So, the inverse transform of the first part is (1/4)u(t), and the inverse transform of the second part is (1/4)cos(2t).

So, putting them together, the inverse Laplace transform is (1/4)u(t) - (1/4)cos(2t). But wait, that can't be correct because the options do not have u(t) (they have functions without it), or perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should think about convolution more. Because the original function is 1/(s(s² +4)), which I can think of as the product of 1/s and 1/(s² +4). So, applying convolution theorem: L^{-1}[F(s)G(s)] = (f * g)(t), where F(s)=1/s, G(s)=1/(s²+4).

So f(t)= L^{-1}(1/s) = u(t), and g(t)= L^{-1}(1/(s² +4)) = (1/2) sin(2t). So the convolution is u(t) * (1/2 sin(2t)).

The convolution integral is ∫₀^t u(τ)(1/2 sin(2(t - τ))) dτ. But u(τ) is 1 for τ ≥0. So the integral becomes ∫₀^t (1/2) sin(2(t - τ)) dτ.

Let me compute this. Let me make a substitution. Let θ = t - τ. Then when τ=0, θ = t; τ =t, θ=0. So dτ = -dθ. The integral becomes ∫θ=t to θ=0 (1/2) sin(2θ) (-dθ) → ∫₀^t (1/2) sin(2θ) dθ.

So integrating (1/2) sin(2θ) dθ: (1/2)*( -1/(2) cos(2θ) ) evaluated from 0 to t. So that's ( -1/(4) [cos(2t) - cos(0)] ) → ( -1/(4) cos(2t) + 1/4 ).

So the convolution is (1/4)(1 - cos(2t)).

Wait, but wait. The original decomposition of the function into partial fractions gave me a different result. Let me double-check. I think I made a mistake in the partial fraction setup because I'm getting conflicting results.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the function can be expressed as a product of two terms, so the inverse Laplace transform is the convolution of their inverse transforms. Let me try this.

Let me denote F(s) = 1/s and G(s) = 1/(s² +4). Then, the inverse Laplace of F(s) is u(t), and the inverse of G(s) is (1/2) sin(2t). So their convolution is ∫₀^t u(τ) (1/2) sin(2(t-τ)) dτ.

As I did earlier, substitution gives (1/2) ∫₀^t sin(2(t-τ)) dτ. Which becomes (1/2) ∫₀^t sin(2τ) dτ (after substitution θ = t-τ). Wait, no: wait, when I change variables, the integral becomes (1/2) ∫₀^t sin(2(t-τ)) dτ → substitute θ = t - τ, dθ = -dτ → (1/2) ∫₀^t sin(2θ)(-dθ) → (1/2) ∫₀^t sin(2θ) dθ.

Wait, no: the integral is ∫₀^t sin(2θ) dθ (since when θ=0, t-τ=0 → θ=t, wait no: when τ=0, θ= t; when τ=t, θ=0. So the limits are from t to 0, which flips the integral and adds a negative sign. So ∫₀^t ... dτ → ∫t^0 ... (-dθ) → ∫₀^t ... dθ. So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫₀^t sin(2θ) dθ.

So integrating sin(2θ): -(1/2) cos(2θ) evaluated from 0 to t. So (1/2) [ ( -(1/2)(cos(2t) - cos(0)) ) ] → (1/2) [ (-1/2 cos(2t) + 1/2 ) ] → (1/2)( (1 - cos(2t)) / 2 ) → (1 - cos(2t)) /4.

So the convolution is (1 - cos(2t))/4. So that suggests that the inverse Laplace transform is (1/4)(1 - cos(2t)).

Looking at the options, option C is (1/4)(1 - cos2t), which matches.

Wait, but earlier I tried partial fractions and another approach and got different expressions. Oh, I think the mistake was in the partial fraction setup. Because the initial partial fractions approach didn't match the convolution result. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me double-check using the initial partial fractions method. The function is 1/(s(s² +4))= (1/4s) - (s/(4(s²+4))). So the inverse Laplace transform would be (1/4)u(t) - (1/4)cos(2t). But then, the inverse Laplace transform is a function that's (1/4)u(t) minus (1/4)cos(2t). The u(t) is a step function, so (1/4)u(t) is (1/4) for t >=0.

Wait, but the options don't have u(t). So perhaps the correct approach is using the convolution theorem, which gives (1- cos2t)/4. So the Laplace function would be the convolution, which is (1/4)(1 - cos2t), which is option C.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To find the inverse Laplace transform \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left[\frac{1}{s(s^2 + 4)}\right] \) using convolution, we proceed as follows:

1. **Partial Fraction Decomposition**:  
   The function \( \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 4)} \) can be decomposed as:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 4)} = \frac{1}{4s} - \frac{s}{4(s^2 + 4)}.
   \]  
   Taking the inverse Laplace transform of each term, we get:  
   \[
   \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left[\frac{1}{4s}\right] = \frac{1}{4}u(t), \quad \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left[\frac{s}{4(s^2 + 4)}\right] = \frac{1}{4}\cos(2t).
   \]  
   Thus, the inverse transform is:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{4}u(t) - \frac{1}{4}\cos(2t).
   \]  
   However, the options provided do not include the unit step function \( u(t) \), so we discard this result and consider the convolution approach.

2. **Convolution Theorem**:  
   The function \( \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 4)} \) can be expressed as the product of \( \frac{1}{s} \) and \( \frac{1}{s^2 + 4} \). Using the convolution theorem:  
   \[
   \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left[\frac{1}{s(s^2 + 4)}\right] = \left(\frac{1}{s} * \frac{1}{s^2 + 4}\right)(t),
   \]  
   where \( * \) denotes convolution.  
   - The inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s} \) is \( u(t) \).  
   - The inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s^2 + 4} \) is \( \frac{1}{2}\sin(2t) \).  

   Therefore, the convolution is:  
   \[
   \left(u(t) * \frac{1}{2}\sin(2t)\right)(t) = \int_0^t u(\tau) \cdot \frac{1}{2}\sin(2(t - \tau)) \, d\tau.
   \]  
   Since \( u(\tau) = 1 \) for \( \tau \geq 0 \), the integral becomes:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \int_0^t \sin(2(t - \tau)) \, d\tau.
   \]  
   Using the substitution \( \theta = t - \tau \), the integral simplifies to:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \int_0^t \sin(2\theta) \, d\theta = \frac{1}{2} \left[ -\frac{1}{2}\cos(2\theta) \right]_0^t = \frac{1}{4} \left( 1 - \cos(2t) \right).
   \]  

3. **Final Result**:  
   The inverse Laplace transform is:  
   \[
   \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left[\frac{1}{s(s^2 + 4)}\right] = \frac{1}{4}(1 - \cos(2t)).
   \]  
   This matches **option C**.
