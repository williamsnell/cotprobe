Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the primary security principles related to messages. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully.

First, I remember that security in digital communications involves several key concepts. The question is asking about the four Primary Security Principles. Let me try to recall what each of them is.

I think the four main principles are Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Non-repudiation. Wait, does that match any of the options? Let me look at them again.

Option A lists Confidentiality, Integrity, Non repudiation, and Authentication. Hmm, so it's adding Authentication here. That's one more principle.

Option B has Authorization, Authentication, Integrity, and Non repudiation. So they're excluding Confidentiality and including Authorization instead.

Option C is Availability, Authorization, Confidentiality, Integrity. That's four, but I'm not sure if these are the primary ones.

Option D is Authentication, Authorization, Availability, Integrity. Again, four, but different order.

Option E: Confidentiality, Access Control, Integrity, Non repudiation. Wait, Access Control isn't a standard term I've heard before. Maybe that's a typo?

Option F: Authorization, Non repudiation, Confidentiality, Integrity. So again, four principles, but starts with Authorization.

Option G: Authentication, Integrity, Access Control, Non repudiation. Access Control is a bit unclear.

Option H: Availability, Access Control, Authorization, Non repudiation. Again, Access Control is confusing.

Option I: Confidentiality, Integrity, Non repudiation, and Access Control. Wait, so it's adding Access Control, which I'm not sure is correct.

Option J: Availability, Authentication, Confidentiality, Non repudiation. So that's four, including Availability and Authentication.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about which ones are the primary. Let me think about each principle.

Confidentiality: This is about keeping messages secret. So the message sender must ensure the message is not read by others.

Authentication: This is about verifying who is sending or receiving the message. It's about proving that the sender knows who they are.

Non-repudiation: Once a message is sent, the sender can't deny sending it. It's about proving that the message was sent and that the recipient has received it.

So, from what I remember, the four main ones are Confidentiality, Integrity, Non Repudiation, and Authentication. Or is it just the last three?

Wait, another thought: Availability might be about having copies of the message. But I'm not sure if that's a primary principle. Also, Access Control is sometimes used to limit who can access certain resources, but I'm not certain if it's considered a standard security principle.

Looking at the options again, option A includes all four: Confidentiality, Integrity, Non repudiation, and Authentication. Option F starts with Authorization, which I don't think is correct.

Option J includes Availability, which I'm not sure about. Let me think: Availability could refer to the ability to send messages, but not sure if it's a primary principle.

Wait, maybe the four are the last four principles: Non Repudiation, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authentication. That would make option A the correct one. Or perhaps it's confidential, integrity, access control, and non repudiation. But I don't think access control is a standard term.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option A: Confidentiality, Integrity, Non repudiation, and Authentication.

So option A includes all four: Confidentiality, Integrity, Non repudiation, and Authentication.

The correct answer is **A: Confidentiality, Integrity, Non repudiation, and Authentication**. This set of principles covers the essential aspects of security in digital communications, including keeping messages secret, ensuring their integrity, proving their non-repudiation, and verifying their authenticity.
