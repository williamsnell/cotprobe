Okay, so I have to answer this multiple-choice question about the last battle that converted Mecca. Let me try to remember. The options are A through J, with each being a different battle. 

First, I should think about what each battle was about. I know that Mecca was a major city in Islam, and its conversion was a big deal. The conversion was when the Caliphate fell, and the Islamic world was at its peak. So which battle was that?

I remember that the Battle of Khaybar happened in 646 CE, right? That was a major event. It was a battle between the Hittites and the Goths. The Goths were the ones who were the main enemies. The Goths fought hard and won, which probably led to a lot of destruction. But wait, was that the last battle that converted Mecca?

Wait, another battle I'm trying to recall is the Battle of Ta'if. That was in 637 CE. Oh, right, that's the Battle of the Trench. It was against the Hittites. The Hittites were the main enemies. And the outcome was a big destruction, but more importantly, the Goths were defeated. That's when the Caliph al-Mu'tasim was defeated, which allowed the Caliphate to weaken. That might have led to the conversion of Mecca because the Caliphate was weakened, so the Islamic world could expand and convert the Goths and other regions. So the battle that converted Mecca would be the one where the Goths were defeated, which was the Battle of Ta'if.

Looking at the options, that's option I. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not making a mistake.

Option B is the Battle of Yamama, which was in 603 CE. Yamama was a city in the southern region of Persia. But I don't think that's the last battle that converted Mecca. It was more of an event in the region before the broader conversion.

Option C is the Battle of Hunayn in 543 CE, which was in the region of the Hittites. They were a major enemy, but I don't think that's the last battle leading to conversion.

Option D is the Battle of Mut'ah in 577 CE, which was against the Hittites. Not the last one.

Option E is the Battle of Tabuk, which I think happened later, but I'm not sure if it's related to conversion.

Option F is the Battle of Khaybar in 646 CE, which I thought was a key battle for conversion.

Option G is Camel, but I think that's a typo or a different battle. Maybe it's referring to something else.

Option H is the Trench battle, which I believe was the Battle of Ta'if.

Option I, as I thought, is the Battle of Ta'if, which is the last battle that converted Mecca.

Option J is Uhud, which I'm not sure about, but I think that involved the Arab expansion, not the conversion of Mecca.

So the correct answer should be I, the Battle of Ta'if.

The battle that led to the conversion of Mecca was the Battle of Ta'if, which occurred in 637 CE. This battle was against the Hittites and resulted in the defeat of the Goths, allowing the Caliphate to weaken and eventually convert Mecca.
