Question:

A ten-year-old boy, tested with a paper-and-pencil intelligence test, obtained an IQ score of 130. Two years later, he was tested with an alternate form of the same test. Most likely, the obtained score on the second testing would be

Options:

A: 130, but with a significant decrease in subtest scores
B: more than 130
C: 140, indicating significant intellectual growth
D: 130
E: 130, but with a different pare of subtest scores
F: less than 130
G: 130, but with a significant increase in subtest scores
H: 100, showing a significant drop in intelligence quotient
I: 120, indicating a decrease in intellectual capabilities
J: Unpredictable as the test used was different

Okay, so I've got this IQ question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about a 10-year-old boy who took a paper-and-pencil intelligence test and scored an IQ of 130. Two years later, he took the same test again, but an alternate form. The options are about what his second score might be.

Hmm, so I'm a bit rusty on my IQ scores, but I remember that IQ tests are designed to assess various cognitive abilities. The standard ranges are, like, below 100 is an intellectual deficiency, 100-119 is below average, 120-130 is average, and above 130 is above average. So a score of 130 is considered average.

But wait, the question is about alternate forms of the same test. Alternate forms are probably versions of the test that have different questions but still measure the same cognitive abilities. I think that the most common form is the standard form, and alternate forms are separate tests that might have different sections or maybe different question types.

The key here is that the same test is taken twice, but it's an alternate form. So, what happens to the scores? I remember something about test-retest reliability. If you take the same test at two points in time, there might be some improvement or decline in scores if there's a genuine change in the individual's cognitive abilities. But if it's an alternate form, I think the scores might be similar because the test is the same in content and difficulty. 

Wait, but could there be a slight improvement? If the individual's abilities change over time, maybe their performance on the alternate form would be a bit different. But I'm not sure about that. However, since the question states it's an alternate form, perhaps the scores are expected to remain similar. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: 130 with a significant decrease in subtest scores. That doesn't make much sense because if it's the same test, the subtest scores should be similar since the content is the same. So a decrease might not be expected.

Option B: More than 130. Well, that's not possible because the test is the same, so the average should stay around 130.

Option C: 140, indicating significant intellectual growth. That's unlikely because the test is the same. The alternate form is not supposed to be more difficult or have more challenging questions.

Option D: 130. Well, if the test is the same, maybe the scores remain the same. But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe with alternate forms, any improvement is a bit expected due to the test not being the same, but I've heard that alternate forms are supposed to have similar scores.

Option E: 130, but with a different part of the subtest. That doesn't make sense. If it's an alternate form, the subtest scores should be similar to the first.

Option F: Less than 130. That would be a significant decline, but without more information, that's a possibility, but I think alternate forms should be similar.

Option G: 130, with a significant increase in subtest scores. That's less likely, because alternate forms shouldn't have more challenging questions.

Option H: 100, showing a drop in intelligence. That's a big drop, which seems unlikely.

Option I: 120, indicating a drop. Again, without more info, I'm not sure.

Option J: Unpredictable as the test used was different. That could be true, but I think the test is the same, so it's more likely to be similar.

Wait, but I'm a bit torn between D and E. If the alternate form is just a different version, should the scores be the same? Like, if the test is the same, the alternate form would yield similar scores, so I think D (130) is the likely answer.

Alternatively, I remember that when you take the same test again, if it's an alternate form, maybe you can expect some improvement, like a small increase, but that's more about the general population. The test might not have a significant change, so the score remains around 130.

So, the most likely option is D: 130, but with a different part of the subtest scored better.

The question involves a 10-year-old boy who took the same intelligence test twice, using an alternate form. The most likely outcome is that his score remains around 130, indicating no significant change in subtest scores. 

Answer: D
