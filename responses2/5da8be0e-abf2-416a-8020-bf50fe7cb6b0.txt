Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the volume of ammonia produced when steam is passed over calcium cyanamide. The balanced reaction is given: CaCN₂ + 3H₂O → 2NH₃ + CaCO₃. Oh wait, right, I remember that CaCO₃ is a decomposition product here.

The problem states that 4000 grams of calcium cyanamide is used. I need to find out how much ammonia this will produce at STP. Oh, wait, STP is standard temperature and pressure, which is 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atmosphere pressure. At STP, the molar volume of any gas is 22.4 liters per mole. So that's key here.

Let me break this down. First, I should find out how many moles of CaCN₂ are present in 4000 grams. The molecular weight of CaCN₂ is given as 80 g/mol. So, to find moles, I'll divide the mass by the molecular weight. So 4000 grams divided by 80 g/mol. Let's see, 4000 divided by 80 is 50. So there are 50 moles of CaCN₂.

Now, looking at the balanced equation, 1 mole of CaCN₂ produces 2 moles of NH₃. So for each mole of CaCN₂, we get 2 moles of NH₃. So 50 moles CaCN₂ would produce 50 * 2 = 100 moles NH₃.

Wait, but wait a second. The reaction produces NH3 as a gas. So the number of moles of NH3 should be 100. So, using the molar volume at STP (22.4 liters/mol), the volume would be 100 moles * 22.4 liters/mol. Let me calculate that. 100 * 22.4 is 2240 liters. Hmm, looking at the options, option F is 2240 liters. So is that the answer?

But wait, let me double-check. Oh wait, the balanced equation is CaCN2 + 3H2O → 2NH3 + CaCO3. So yes, 1 mole of CaCN2 gives 2 NH3. So 4000g is 50 moles CaCN2. So 50 *2=100 moles NH3. 100 *22.4=2240 liters. So F is the option, but wait what's the option list. Let me check the options again.

Options: A is 6720, B 560, C 4480, D 1120, E 2000, F 2240, G 2800, H 22400, I 11200, J 3360.

So F is 2240, which would be the correct answer. So the correct answer is F.

To determine the volume of ammonia produced when 4000 g of calcium cyanamide (CaCN₂) is reacted with steam, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of CaCN₂**:  
   The molecular weight of CaCN₂ is 80 g/mol.  
   Moles of CaCN₂ = mass (g) / molecular weight (g/mol) = 4000 g / 80 g/mol = 50 mol.

2. **Determine moles of NH₃ produced**:  
   From the balanced reaction, 1 mole of CaCN₂ produces 2 moles of NH₃.  
   Moles of NH₃ = 2 × moles of CaCN₂ = 2 × 50 mol = 100 mol.

3. **Calculate the volume of NH₃ at STP**:  
   At STP, the molar volume of a gas is 22.4 L/mol.  
   Volume of NH₃ = moles of NH₃ × molar volume = 100 mol × 22.4 L/mol = 2240 L.

4. **Match the result to the options**:  
   The calculated volume of NH₃ is 2240 L, which corresponds to option F.
