Okay, so I've got this AdaBoost question to tackle. Hmm, AdaBoost is a machine learning algorithm, right? I remember it's used for boosting weak classifiers into strong ones. The question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false.

Statement 1 says that in AdaBoost, the weights of the misclassified examples go up by the same multiplicative factor. Wait, AdaBoost works by adjusting the weights of the training examples. I think each time a weak classifier makes a mistake, it assigns a higher weight to the next round. Oh right, the weights are updated by a factor, typically greater than 1, each time a new weak classifier is added. So if they're the same multiplicative factor each time, that could be true. But wait, AdaBoost uses a fixed alpha factor, which is 0.9 approximately, so maybe it's the same each time. So maybe Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2: In AdaBoost, the weighted training error e_t of the tth weak classifier on training data with weights D_t tends to increase as a function of t. I recall that AdaBoost minimizes the exponential loss. The weights D_t adjust based on the previous mistakes. Each step, the error is calculated with the current weights. I think the error tends to decrease over time because each new weak classifier corrects the mistakes of the previous ones. So the error could be decreasing, not increasing. So Statement 2 might be False.

So Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. Looking at the options, I need to find which option pairs True and False. Let's look at the choices:

Option H is True, True — that's not what I think.
Wait, no, I thought Statement 2 was False. Let me double-check.

Wait, Statement 1: The weights go up by same multiplicative factor. Since each time a new example is misclassified, the weight increases by a factor. But in AdaBoost, the weights are updated multiplicatively, but each step uses the same factor. So yes, same multiplicative factor each time. So Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2: The error e_t increases with t. Let me think. AdaBoost aims to minimize the exponential loss, so each step the error should decrease. Therefore, Statement 2's claim that it tends to increase is False.

So now, looking for a pair where Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False. Checking the options:

Looking at the options:

Option H: True, True — no, I think Statement 2 is False.

Wait, the options are:

Option F: Partially True, Partially True. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps my analysis is off.

Wait, Statement 1: the weights of the misclassified examples go up by the same multiplicative factor. So each time a new example is misclassified, its weight is multiplied by a factor, say, alpha. Since alpha is positive and less than 1, the weight increases each time. But wait, AdaBoost uses a fixed alpha (like 0.9), so each time, the same factor is applied. So yes, the multiplicative factor is the same each time. So Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2: e_t tends to increase as t increases. But in AdaBoost, the error e_t (weighted by D_t) should decrease over time. Since it's the weighted error, but the sum of the errors might grow, but the individual errors decrease. So Statement 2 is False.

So the two statements are: True, False.

Looking at the options, Option I is True, False. Let me see:

Options:

A: True, Partially True — probably not, since I think both are either True or False.

Wait, the options are combinations of True and False, not partial. So looking for the option where Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False.

Looking again:

Option H: True, True — no.

Option I: True, False — yes.

So the correct answer should be Option I: True, False.

Wait, but I thought Statement 2 was False. Yes, that's correct. So the correct option is I: True, False.
</think>

The analysis of the two statements in the AdaBoost context leads to the following conclusion:

1. **Statement 1**: The weights of misclassified examples increase by the same multiplicative factor each time. This is true because AdaBoost uses a fixed factor (e.g., 0.9) to update weights, causing the same increase each time.

2. **Statement 2**: The weighted training error decreases as a function of time. This is false because AdaBoost's goal is to minimize the exponential loss, so the error tends to decrease over time.

Thus, the correct option is **I: True, False**.
