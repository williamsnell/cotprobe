Consumption Expenditures | $500 billion
Wages and salaries | $400 billion
(Gross Private) Investments Expenditures | $80 billion
Government Expenditures | $100 billion
Taxes | $70 billion
Imports | $50 billion
Exports | $30 billion
What is the GDP (in billions)?

Options:

A: 700
B: 730
C: 710
D: 760
E: 640
F: 680
G: 650
H: 720
I: 750
J: 660

Answer:
    <think>
<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about calculating GDP using the expenditure approach. Hmm, let me think. I remember that GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a specific period. The expenditure approach sums up all the different types of spending.

The formula for the expenditure approach is: GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Expenditures + (Exports - Imports). Wait, is that right? Or is it Consumption + Investment + Government Expenditures plus (Exports minus Imports)?

Wait, let me double-check. The formula is usually written as: GDP = C + I + G + (X - M), where C is consumption, I is gross investment, G is government spending, X is exports, and M is imports. So that's the correct formula.

So the question gives me the following values:

- Consumption Expenditures: $500 billion
- Wages and salaries: $400 billion (but wait, isn't that part of consumption? Or maybe it's also part of consumption, but perhaps the question groups them into C. Wait, the problem statement says "Consumption Expenditures" is $500, and "Wages and salaries" is $400. Hmm, because I think those are probably part of C. So C = 500 + 400 = $900 billion.

Wait no, wait. Let me read the question again. The given values are:

Consumption Expenditures
Wages and salaries
(Gross Private) Investments Expenditures
Government Expenditures
Taxes
Imports
Exports

Wait, no, the question lists each category separately. Oh wait, maybe Wages and salaries are included in consumption. So the total consumption (C) would be 500 (Consumption) + 400 (Wages and salaries) = $900 billion.

Similarly, the other categories are:

Gross Private Investments Expenditures: $80 billion
Government Expenditures: $100 billion
Taxes: $70 billion
Imports: $50 billion
Exports: $30 billion

So putting it all into the GDP formula:

GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)

So C is $900, I is $80, G is $100, X is $30, M is $50.

So let's calculate each part:

C = 900
I = 80
G = 100
X - M = 30 - 50 = -20.

Now adding them all together: 900 + 80 = 980, plus 100 is 1080. Then 1080 minus 20 is 1060.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the formula. Another version I've seen is that GDP = C + I + G + (X - M). So that's correct.

So 900 (C) +80 (I) = 980. 980 +100 (G)=1080. 1080 + (30-50)= -20. So 1080 -20 = 1060. But wait, the options don't go up to 1060. Hmm, the options are all around 600-760. So either I made a mistake, or perhaps I misread the question.

Wait another thing: let's see all the numbers again.

Wait the problem lists:

Consumption Expenditures: 500
Wages and salaries: 400
(Gross Private) Investments Expenditures: 80
Government Expenditures: 100
Taxes: 70
Imports: 50
Exports:30.

Wait, but wait, I'm adding C as 500 + 400 = 900. But perhaps I should think that Wages and salaries are part of consumption. So C is 500 (Consumption) + 400 (Wages and salaries) = 900.

Yes, that's correct. Then I, G, X-M. So the calculation is 900 +80+100 + (30-50) = 900+80=980; 980+100=1080; 1080-20=1060.

Wait, but the options don't have 1060. Hmmm. The options are A:700, B:730, C:710, D:760, E:640, F:680, G:650, H:720, I:750, J:660.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in adding. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, consumption is 500, then Wages and salaries is 400. So C=900.

Investments:80.

G=100.

X=30, M=50. So X-M= -20.

So adding up:

900 (C) + 80 (I) = 980.

980 +100 (G) = 1080.

1080 + (-20) = 1060.

But that doesn't match any answer option. Hmm, I must have made an error elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the 'Gross Private Investment Expenditures' is $80 billion. Wait, but if the investment is taken as capital expenditure, maybe it's a different number. Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should sum all the components correctly.

Wait, let me write each part down:

C = 500 + 400 = 900

I = 80

G = 100

X =30, M=50 → X-M= -20.

So total = 900 +80 +100 -20.

900 + 80 is 980. 980 +100 = 1080. 1080 -20=1060.

Wait, but the options don't have 1060. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I read the question.

Looking back, perhaps I misread the numbers. Let's double-check each category:

Consumption Expenditures: $500 billion.

Wages and salaries: $400 billion.

Investments Expenditures: $80 billion.

Government Expenditures: $100 billion.

Taxes: $70 billion.

Imports: $50 billion.

Exports: $30 billion.

Wait, no mistake here. So perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Let me think again. Another version I've seen is:

GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Expenditures + (Exports - Imports).

Wait, perhaps I should include all the other categories correctly.

Wait, C is 500 +400 =900.

I is 80.

G is 100.

X-M is 30-50 = -20.

So 900 +80 =980.

980 +100=1080.

1080 -20=1060.

Hmm. But no option is 1060. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the question is not using the expenditure approach but another method, like the income approach. But the question explicitly says to use the expenditure approach.

Wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that Wages and salaries are part of G, or not. No, they are probably separate.

Wait, perhaps I should check the numbers again. Let's add all the numbers step by step.

C = 500 + 400 = 900.

I = 80.

G =100.

X-M =30-50= -20.

Now, adding them: 900 +80=980.

980 +100=1080.

1080 -20=1060.

Hmm, 1060 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in how I'm adding these.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is C + I + G + (X - M). So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question lists all the values correctly. So if the total is 1060, but none of the options match, perhaps I'm missing a negative somewhere.

Wait, let me think if the formula is C + I + G + (X - M). Alternatively, some sources write G as GDP government expenditure, but that's the same as G.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another version is: GDP = C + I + G + (X - M). Yes, that's the standard.

Wait, perhaps the question is adding the numbers in a different order. Let me sum each category again.

Wait, if I add all the numbers: C is 500 +400=900.

I is 80.

G is 100.

X is 30.

M is50.

So X-M is -20.

So 900+80=980; +100=1080; -20=1060.

No, that's correct. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, perhaps I misread the numbers. Let me read the question again:

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:
Calculate the Gross Domestic Product using the total expenditure approach:
Consumption Expenditures | $500 billion
Wages and salaries | $400 billion
(Gross Private) Investments Expenditures | $80 billion
Government Expenditures | $100 billion
Taxes | $70 billion
Imports | $50 billion
Exports | $30 billion

Wait, wait! Oh! Wait a minute. I think I made a mistake. The question lists (Gross Private) Investments Expenditures as $80. But that's actually the same as G, the government investment, which is $100. Oh no! Wait no, no. The problem says:

(Gross Private) Investments Expenditures: $80 billion.

Wait, that's a different number. So perhaps the 'Investments Expenditures' in this context is different from G. Wait, no, in the formula, I think 'Investments Expenditures' is the same as G in the formula. Because in the formula, I (capital) is subtracted, but perhaps in this problem, it's called 'Investments Expenditures' separately.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the value of Wages and salaries separately from I. So, perhaps Wages and salaries are part of C, and I is another category.

Wait, the formula I'm using is C + I + G + (X - M). So let me make sure that I'm using the correct numbers.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-add the numbers:

C: 500 (Consumption) + 400 (Wages and salaries) = 900.

I: 80.

G: 100.

X:30, M:50 → X-M= -20.

So 900 +80=980 → +100=1080 → +(-20)=1060.

But the options are all between 600-760, so 1060 isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm adding all the numbers in a different order. Let me sum all the numbers again.

C:500 +400 = 900.

I:80.

G:100.

X:30.

M:50.

So X-M is 30-50= -20.

Adding all together: 900 +80=980; 980+100=1080; 1080 + (-20)= 1060.

But none of the options correspond to 1060. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 'Investments' is not 80, but 100. Or perhaps I'm adding something wrong.

Wait, wait, perhaps the problem statement lists "Gross Private Investments Expenditures" as $80, but that's actually the same as G (government investment), which is $100. That can't be right. Unless I'm misreading the problem.

Wait, the problem says:

(Gross Private) Investments Expenditures: $80 billion.

And then separately, other categories.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a typo? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the labels.

Alternatively, perhaps the Wages and salaries are not part of C, but this is unlikely because that part is part of consumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should sum all the numbers again, but in a different way.

Wait, another approach: let's list all the numbers.

C: 500 +400=900.

I:80.

G:100.

X:30.

M:50.

X-M: -20.

Now, summing all together:

900 (C) + 80 (I) + 100 (G) + (30-50) → 900 +80 is 980, plus 100 is 1080, plus (-20) is 1060.

Wait, but the options don't have 1060. So perhaps the question is using a different formula. Let me consider the income approach.

Wait, another formula is GDP = (C + I) + (GDP Expenditures) + (X - M). No, that's the same as the expenditure formula.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the way the problem lists the numbers. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem lists: 

Consumption Expenditures | 500

Wages and salaries | 400

(Gross Private) Investments Expenditures | 80

Government Expenditures | 100

Taxes |70

Imports |50

Exports |30.

So each category is a separate line. So each of these is part of the formula.

So my calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 'Investments' is 80, and I should not include it as 80 but 100? No, the problem says that. So perhaps I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem adds all the numbers except the G (government) and I (investments) together, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not using the expenditure approach correctly. But all the options are lower than 1060, so I'm not sure.

Wait, let me check the options again. Options are A to J: 700,730,710,760,640,680,650,720,750,660.

Hmm, 1060 is way higher than the highest option of 760. So I must have made a mistake. Let me go through the numbers once more.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of addition. Let me add all the values step by step.

So all the values:

C:500

Wages:400

Investments:80

G:100

Taxes:70

M:50

X:30.

Wait, but the formula is C + I + G + (X - M). So I =80.

So:

C=500 +400 =900.

I=80.

G=100.

X=30, M=50 → X-M= -20.

Adding 500 +400=900.

900 +80=980.

980 +100=1080.

1080 + (-20)=1060.

Hmm, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm adding all the numbers, but the actual formula is different. Let me think: is the formula C + I + G + (X - M)?

Yes, that's how I've been using it. So I think perhaps the answer isn't among the options, but that can't be as the options are given.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the numbers. Let me add each number one by one:

Start with 500 (C).

Add 400 (Wages) → 900.

Add 80 (Investments) → 980.

Add 100 (G) → 1080.

Add 30 (X) → 1110.

Subtract 50 (M) → 1110 -50=1060.

So same result.

Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the problem lists the values incorrectly. Let me double-check the given numbers.

Looking at the problem statement:

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:
Calculate the Gross Domestic Product using the total expenditure approach:
Consumption Expenditures | $500 billion
Wages and salaries | $400 billion
(Gross Private) Investments Expenditures | $80 billion
Government Expenditures | $100 billion
Taxes | $70 billion
Imports | $50 billion
Exports | $30 billion

Wait, the 'Gross Private Investments Expenditures' is 80, which is probably the same as G (government investment). But in the formula, I is different from G.

But in the formula, I is the capital investment, which is separate. So perhaps in this problem, I is 80, same as G's value.

Wait, but that would make G=80, but that's probably not correct. So perhaps the problem is using I=80, which would change the calculation. Let me try that.

Wait, if I=80, then the calculation becomes:

900 (C) +80 (I)=980.

980 +100 (G)=1080.

1080 + (30-50)=1080-20=1060.

Same result.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is adding all the numbers except for the G (GDP Government Expenditures). So let's see.

So the numbers are:

C:500

Wages:400

I:80

G:100

Taxes:70

M:50

X:30.

Now, if I sum all except G: 500+400=900; 900+80=980; 980+100=1080; then add G=100 → 1180.

Wait, but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm not including G.

Wait, perhaps the formula is C + I + G + (X-M). So in that case, if I, G, X-M are the values.

So adding 500 +80 +100 + (30-50) → 500+80=580; 580+100=680; 680 + (-20)=660.

Which is one of the options, option J:660.

Wait, but this would be wrong because G is 100, not 80. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is C + I + G + (X-M). Wait, but in this case, the numbers are:

500 (C) +80 (I) +100 (G) + (30-50)= -20. So 500+80=580; 580+100=680; 680-20=660.

So this would be option J:660.

But wait, in reality, the formula is C + I + G + (X-M). So I is 80, G is 100.

So the calculation is 500 (C) +80 (I) =580; plus G (100) =680; plus (X-M) which is -20 → 660.

So this would be option J.

But wait, in another approach, perhaps the formula is C + G + I + (X-M). So that would be 500 (C) +100 (G) =600; +80 (I) =680; plus (X-M) =-20 → 660.

Same result.

But why would the formula be C + G + I + (X-M)? That doesn't seem right because the formula is typically C + I + G + (X-M).

Wait, perhaps in this problem, the formula is different.

Hmm, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 660, option J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in my earlier calculation, I considered I as 80 and G as 100, leading to 660, which is an option.

So perhaps the correct answer is option J:660.

But I thought earlier that G is 100, but perhaps that's not the case. Let me clarify.

In the formula, G is the GDP government expenditure, which is 100. I is the gross private investment, which is 80.

So the calculation is indeed 500 +80 +100 + (30-50) → 500+80=580; 580+100=680; 680-20=660.

So that's option J:660.

But wait, the problem gives the options, so perhaps the correct answer is J:660.

But earlier, I thought that the formula leads to 1060, which is not an option. So perhaps the problem is correct, and I should proceed accordingly.

So to recap, the correct calculation is:

C =500 +400 =900.

I=80.

G=100.

X=30, M=50 → X-M= -20.

Total:900+80+100-20=1060.

But 1060 is not an option, so perhaps the problem is wrong or I'm misunderstanding it.

But if I proceed with the formula, the correct answer is 660, which is option J.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the formula again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is C + I + (G) + (X-M). So that's 500 +80 +100 + (30-50)= -20.

So 500+80=580; +100=680; -20=660.

So that's correct.

So the correct answer is 660, option J.

But wait, earlier, I thought the formula is C + I + G + (X-M), which would be 500+80+100+(-20)=660.

So yes, that's correct.

So perhaps the problem's options are wrong, but according to the calculation, the correct answer is 660, option J.

Wait, but the problem statement says to calculate using expenditure approach. Let me just confirm with the formula.

So the formula is:

GDP = C + I + G + (X-M).

Yes, that's correct.

So putting the numbers in:

500 +80 +100 + (30-50) =500 +80=580; +100=680; + (30-50)= -20. So 680-20=660.

So that's correct.

So option J:660.

But earlier, I thought that the total was 1060, which is wrong.

Wait, but perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the correct calculation is 660.

So the correct answer is J:660.

But wait, the problem's options are:

A)700, B)730, C)710, D)760, E)640, F)680, G)650, H)720, I)750, J)660.

So option J is 660.

So the correct answer is option J:660.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused because earlier, I thought the formula is leading to 1060, but that's incorrect.

So in conclusion, the correct answer is option J:660.
</think>

After carefully analyzing the problem and recalculating the values using the correct formula for the expenditure approach, the GDP is determined to be 660 billion. This corresponds to option J.

ANSWER: J
