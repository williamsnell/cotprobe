Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about enzymes and inhibitors. Hmm, I remember that enzyme inhibitors can be competitive or non-competitive, but wait, what's the difference between them? 

The question is about a competitive inhibitor. Competitive inhibitors bind to the same site on the enzyme as the substrate does, right? So they compete with the substrate from the enzyme. That makes sense because if the enzyme has an active site where the substrate binds, an inhibitor would block that same site.

Let me think about the options. The options are about how the inhibitor affects the enzyme's activity. So I need to find which option describes the effect of an inhibitor that's competitive.

Option B says the inhibitor is irreversibly forming covalent links, preventing dissociation. That seems like a non-competitive inhibitor because it's binding to the site and keeping the enzyme from doing its job. Competitive inhibitors prevent the active site from binding the substrate, so they are irreversibly modifying the active site.

Option F and G are about competing with the product. Oh wait, wait. No, because the product molecule would bind the enzyme's active site as well. So F and G are about product competition, which is more about non-competitive inhibitors. Competitive inhibitors affect the substrate binding.

Option C says the inhibitor irreversibly modifies residues in the active site. That sounds correct because competitive inhibitors bind to the active site, modifying it so the substrate can't fit.

Option D says it increases available enzyme to bind substrates. No, that's more like a competitive inhibitor being removed, not binding to the site. So D is incorrect.

Option A talks about some amino acids modifying, but it's not clear if it's reversible. I think competitive inhibitors are more about modifying the active site rather than just making some changes.

Option E says it decreases available enzyme. That's the opposite of what a competitive inhibitor does. So E is about non-competitive.

Option I is about decreasing available, which again is non-competitive. So I can rule that out.

So the correct answer must be either B or C. Let me re-read the options.

Option B: Irreversibly forming covalent links with the enzyme, effectively preventing dissociation. That sounds like a non-competitive inhibitor because it's binding the enzyme to the active site (so same site, same enzyme). 

Option C: Irreversibly modifying some amino acids in the active site. Competitive inhibitors do exactly that—modifying the enzyme's active site so the substrate can't bind.

So, an example of a competitive inhibitor is something that binds to the active site. For example, a substrate-binding inhibitor might have a structure that fits the active site, preventing the substrate from attaching. 

Wait, but what about the modifiers—like binding the active site. So the correct answer is C. Because the inhibitor is making the active site modify by binding to the enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding.

Alternatively, some inhibitors are competitive because they form bonds with the enzyme, preventing it from binding the substrate. 

So the correct answer is either C or B. Wait, let me clarify: Competitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme-substrate complex's active site, effectively preventing the enzyme from binding the substrate. So they are modifying the active site, making it non-functional for the substrate. So the effect is that the active site is modified, not the enzyme being irreversibly linked to the enzyme.

So the correct answer is C: irreversibly modifying some of the amino acid residues that help to comprise the enzyme's active site.

Wait, but wait another thought. Another way to look at it is that in competition, the inhibitor binds to the active site, so it's the active site's structure that's modified. So the inhibitor is irreversibly modifying the active site. So option C says that, which fits.

Alternatively, option B says it's irreversibly forming covalent links with the enzyme, which seems more like a type of non-competitive inhibitor. Because these link the inhibitor to the enzyme, preventing it from binding. So, in that case, the inhibitor is binding to the enzyme, not the active site.

So I think the correct answer is option C.

The question asks about the effect of a competitive inhibitor on an enzyme. Competitive inhibitors bind to the same active site on the enzyme as the substrate does, preventing the substrate from binding. This modification occurs irreversibly, as seen in option C. 

Option B describes a non-competitive inhibitor that binds to the enzyme but not the active site, which is incorrect for a competitive inhibitor. Option C accurately states that competitive inhibitors irreversibly modify the active site of the enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding. Options D, E, F, G, H, and I are either unrelated to competitive inhibition or describe different types of inhibitors.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: C**
