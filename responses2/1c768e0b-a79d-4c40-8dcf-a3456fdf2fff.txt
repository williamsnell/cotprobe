Okay, so I have this polynomial: 2x^5 + 8x - 7. And I need to find how many real roots it has. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the number of real roots of a polynomial is related to its degree, but wait, the degree is 5 here, so that would typically suggest up to 5 real roots, right? But not all polynomials of degree n have n real roots. Some can have fewer.

I think I should start by checking the behavior of the polynomial. Maybe I can use the Intermediate Value Theorem or look at its end behavior. Let's see. The leading term is 2x^5, which as x approaches positive infinity, this term goes to positive infinity because the exponent is odd. As x approaches negative infinity, since the exponent is odd, 2x^5 would go to negative infinity. So the polynomial will go from negative infinity to positive infinity as x increases. That means there's at least one real root where the function crosses the x-axis somewhere.

But wait, the question isn't about how many times it crosses the x-axis; it's about the number of distinct real roots. So perhaps I should look for sign changes in the polynomial's values at different points. Let me plug in some values.

At x=0: 2*(0)^5 +8*(0) -7 = -7. So f(0) is -7.

At x=1: 2*1 +8*1 -7 = 2+8-7=3. So f(1) is 3.

So between x=0 and x=1, the function goes from -7 to 3, which means it must cross zero somewhere in between. That's one real root.

What about between x=1 and higher? Let's try x=2: 2*(32) +8*2 -7 =64+16-7=73. So f(2)=73.

Wait, so f(1) is 3, which is positive, and f(2) is 73, still positive. So the function is increasing here, but maybe it's increasing more?

Wait, perhaps I should check the derivative to see if there are any local maxima or minima. If the function has any turning points, that could affect the number of roots. Let's find f'(x).

f'(x) = derivative of 2x^5 is 10x^4, plus derivative of 8x is 8, so f'(x) = 10x^4 +8.

Wait, 10x^4 is always non-negative since x^4 is non-negative. Adding 8, which is positive, so f'(x) is always positive. That means the function is strictly increasing everywhere. So if it's always increasing, it can cross the x-axis only once. So how many real roots does it have? One.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm. Because if the derivative is always positive, the function is monotonically increasing. So yes, only one real root.

But wait, another way to think about it: for a polynomial of odd degree, the number of real roots is at least one. But how many can there be? If it's strictly increasing, then exactly one real root. So the answer should be One, which is option J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes higher-degree polynomials can have more roots. But since the derivative is always positive, that means the function is always increasing, so it can't have any turning points. So yes, only one real root.

The polynomial is of odd degree (5), so it must have at least one real root. By analyzing the derivative, f'(x) = 10x‚Å¥ + 8, which is always positive, indicating the function is strictly increasing everywhere. A strictly increasing function can cross the x-axis only once, so the polynomial has exactly one real root.

Answer: J
