Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about factors that predict which states might end up having nuclear weapons. Hmm, I remember learning a bit about nuclear weapons in history and international relations. Let me think through this.

The question is asking which of the options is NOT a good predictor. The options are A to F. I need to figure out which one is the least likely to influence whether a state ends up with nuclear weapons.

Starting with each option:

A: Geographic location. I think countries that are more isolated might be less likely to build nuclear weapons because they don't have a lot of resources. So, maybe geographic location is a good factor. So A is a good predictor, which means it's not the answer.

B: Age of the state. I'm not sure. Younger states might be more vulnerable because they might not have had enough time to develop nuclear capabilities. But I'm not certain if age is a strong predictor. Maybe it's not the best choice, but I need to check the others.

C: Regime type. Regimes are different in their approach to nuclear issues. For example, some regimes might prefer nuclear arms because of security concerns. So a state's regime could influence whether it gets nuclear weapons. So C is a good predictor, so not the answer.

D: Wealth/GDP. Higher GDP generally means more resources, which could support nuclear power initiatives. So more wealth is likely a good predictor. D is a good one, so not the answer.

E: Receipt of sensitive nuclear assistance. This directly relates to having access to nuclear weapons. If a state receives them, it's more likely. So E is a good predictor, so not the answer.

F: Rivalry with a nuclear state. If a state is in a competition, it might try to get nuclear weapons to outpace the rival. So yes, this is a good factor. So F is a good predictor.

Wait, so all options except maybe B. Let me think again. The question is about which is NOT a good predictor. So I need to find the factor that doesn't influence it much.

B is the age of the state. I don't think age is a big factor. Younger states might have had less time to develop nuclear capabilities, but I'm not sure if their political environment affects it. Also, older states might have more established nuclear capabilities. So maybe age isn't a strong factor. Or perhaps it's more about resource availability and resources, which is more about GDP and wealth. So if there's no other factor, age isn't a strong one. So B might be the correct answer, the one that's not a good predictor.

The question asks which factor is NOT a good predictor of states ending up with nuclear weapons. After analysis:

- **A: Geographic location** is a good predictor because isolated countries may lack resources.
- **B: Age of the state** is less likely to be a significant factor, as it's influenced by resource availability and political stability.
- **C: Regime type** is a strong predictor due to differing approaches to nuclear issues.
- **D: Wealth/GDP** is a good predictor as it reflects resource availability.
- **E: Receipt of sensitive nuclear assistance** directly impacts the likelihood.
- **F: Rivalry with a nuclear state** is a strong factor, as it leads to competition for nuclear weapons.

Thus, **B: Age of the state** is the least likely to be a good predictor.

**Answer: B**
