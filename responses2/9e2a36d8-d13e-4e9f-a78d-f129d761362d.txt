Okay, so I've got this question about a heat pump, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says: A heat pump is extracting heat from the outdoor environment at 7°C and heats the indoor environment to 27°C. For each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors, what's the smallest amount of work needed? The options are A to J.

Hmm, I remember that heat pumps, or refrigerators, work by transferring heat from a colder place to a warmer place. Oh wait, wait, no, in this case, it's extracting heat from the outdoor (colder) and delivering it to the indoor (warmer). So it's like a heat pump, not a refrigerator, because it's heating a warmer place.

The formula I'm trying to recall is the one for the coefficient of performance (COP) for a heat pump. I think the COP for a heat pump is higher than that of a refrigerator. Oh right, COP for a heat pump is Qh over W, where Qh is the heat delivered (the heat being delivered to the inside) and W is the work input.

Wait, let's get that right. COP (COP for heat pump) = Qh / W. So the work W is equal to Qh divided by COP.

What's the COP for a heat pump? I think it's given by COP = Qh / (Qh - Qc), where Qc is the heat extracted from the cold source. Oh wait, but the question only gives us Qh. Because the question says for each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors, what's the work. So perhaps the question is only considering the heat pump's role as a heat pump, not a refrigerator.

Wait, but in that case, the COP for a heat pump is COP = Qh / W, so W = Qh / COP.

Wait, but then what's the COP for this scenario? Because I need to find COP, which is Qh divided by Qh minus Qc. Wait, but the question doesn't give me Qc. So I probably need to make an assumption here.

Wait, maybe the heat pump is operating in an ideal scenario. So for an ideal heat pump, the COP is Qh / W, and the COP can also be expressed as Qh / (Qh - Qc). But since the question is only giving Qh, maybe I can relate it to the temperatures.

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is COP = Tc / (Th - Tc), where Tc is the temperature of the cold reservoir and Th is the temperature of the hot reservoir.

Wait, right, I think that's the formula. Because COP for a heat pump (like an ideal one) is given by COP = Th / (Th - Tc), but wait wait, let me double-check. 

Wait, no, I think I might have it the other way. Wait, for a heat pump, the COP is defined as Qh / W, which equals (Th) / (Th - Tc). So perhaps the formula is COP = Th / (Th - Tc). Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The COP for a heat pump is given by COP = Qh / W. And for an ideal (Carnot) heat pump, the COP is max possible, which is COP = Th / (Th - Tc), where Th is the hot reservoir temperature and Tc is the cold. Alternatively, since Qc = W * (Tc/Th), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is COP = (T_hot) / (T_hot - T_cold). Because in an ideal case, COP would be the ratio of the heat delivered to the work input. So if the heat delivered is Qh, then W = Qh / COP.

Let me try plugging numbers.

Given that, the outdoor temperature is 7°C, which is 7 + 273 = 280 K. The indoor temperature is 27°C, which is 300 K.

So, according to the Carnot heat pump formula, COP = Th / (Th - Tc). Plugging in the numbers: Th = 300 K, Tc = 280 K.

So Th - Tc = 20 K. So COP = 300 / 20 = 15.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would make COP 15. So W = Qh / COP = 15,000 J / 15 = 1,000 J.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are A:1500, B:1000, etc. So option B is 1,000 J. But wait, why would the answer be 1000 J?

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the question is about the work per 15,000 J of heat delivered. So in this scenario, the COP is 15, so W = Qh / COP = 15,000 /15 = 1000 J. So the answer would be B, 1,000 J.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Because another way to think: COP is Qh / W. So W = Qh / COP. If the COP is 15, then W is 1000 J.

Wait, but that's not among the options; wait, option B is 1000 J, which would match.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the formula is COP = (Th) / (Th - Tc). Which is what I used. So that's correct.

Wait, but what if the formula is COP = (Th)/(Th - Tc). So in that case, the answer is 1000 J.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is 1000 J.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps they instead consider the formula COP = Qh / (Qh - Qc). But without knowing Qc, perhaps I can find Qc from the Carnot equation.

Wait, the Carnot efficiency for a heat pump is η = COP -1 = Tc/(Th - Tc). So:

η = COP -1 = (Th - Tc) / (Th - Tc) = [300-280]/20 = 20/20 = 1. So η = 1, which can't be right because that's impossible. So perhaps I used the wrong formula.

Wait, that can't be right. That would suggest that the heat pump is 100% efficient, which isn't possible. So I must have gotten the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is COP = (Th - Tc) / Tc. Let me try that.

Th = 300, Tc = 280.

(Th - Tc) is 20. 20 / 280 ≈ 0.071.

Then COP would be 0.071, which doesn't make sense for a heat pump because COP can't be less than 1. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me think again. The correct formula for COP for a heat pump is COP = Qh / W.

And for an ideal heat pump (Carnot), Qh = W * Th / (Th - Tc). So substituting that into COP equation: COP = (W * Th/(Th-Tc)) / W ) = Th/(Th - Tc). So that's correct.

But wait, that gives Th/(Th - Tc) = 300/(20) = 15. So W = Qh / COP = 15,000 / 15 = 1000 J.

So the answer should be B:1000 J.

But wait, let's make sure I'm not making a mistake in the calculations. Oh wait, 300 divided by 20 is 15. So yes.

So the answer would be option B:1000 J.

To determine the smallest amount of work required for each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors by a heat pump, we use the concept of coefficient of performance (COP) for a heat pump. The COP for a heat pump is defined as:

\[
\text{COP} = \frac{Q_h}{W}
\]

where \( Q_h \) is the heat delivered to the hot reservoir (indoor environment) and \( W \) is the work input. Rearranging this formula gives:

\[
W = \frac{Q_h}{\text{COP}}
\]

For an ideal (Carnot) heat pump, the COP is given by:

\[
\text{COP} = \frac{T_h}{T_h - T_c}
\]

where \( T_h \) is the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir (300 K, corresponding to 27°C) and \( T_c \) is the absolute temperature of the cold reservoir (280 K, corresponding to 7°C). Substituting these values:

\[
\text{COP} = \frac{300}{300 - 280} = \frac{300}{20} = 15
\]

Now, using the formula for work input:

\[
W = \frac{Q_h}{\text{COP}} = \frac{15,000 \, \text{J}}{15} = 1,000 \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the smallest amount of work required for each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors is **1,000 J**. This corresponds to option **B**.
