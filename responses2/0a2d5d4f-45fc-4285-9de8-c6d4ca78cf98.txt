Alright, so I've got this problem here about finding the voltage across a capacitor at time t. Let's see what I remember about circuits and differential equations. 

The problem states that the capacitor has a capacitance C of 1e-6 farads. The initial voltage ν_c(0) is 1 volt. The current through the capacitor is given as i_C(t) = cos(1e6 t). I need to find ν_c(t) for t ≥ 0. The options are A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. I'm a bit confused. Usually, the current through a capacitor is related to the derivative of the voltage. Oh right, the formula is i_C(t) = C * dv/dt. So I should set up an equation using that.

Given i_C(t) is cos(1e6 t), then C * dv/dt = cos(1e6 t). I can rearrange that to dv/dt = (1/C) * cos(1e6 t). Since C is 1e-6 F, 1/C is 1e6 s. So dv/dt = 1e6 * cos(1e6 t).

To find v(t), I need to integrate dv/dt with respect to t. The integral of cos(k t) is (1/k) sin(k t) + constant. So integrating 1e6 cos(1e6 t) dt gives me sin(1e6 t) + constant. 

Now, applying initial conditions. At t=0, v(0)=1 V. So plug t=0 into the integral:

v(0) = sin(0) + constant = 0 + constant = 1. So the constant is 1. Thus, v(t) = sin(1e6 t) + 1.

Wait, but let me double-check the integration step. The integral of cos(kt) dt is (1/k) sin(kt) + C. So yes, with k=1e6, the integral becomes (1/(1e6)) * sin(1e6 t) + C. But wait, earlier I thought C was 1e-6, so 1/C is 1e6. So that's correct.

So v(t) = 1 + (1/(1e6)) sin(1e6 t). Oh wait, wait, no. Let me recast it. 

Wait, dv/dt = 1e6 * cos(1e6 t). So the integral is ∫1e6 cos(1e6 t) dt. Let me make a substitution: Let u = 1e6 t. Then du/dt = 1e6 → du = 1e6 dt → dt = du/(1e6). 

So ∫1e6 cos(u) * (du/(1e6)) ) = ∫ cos(u) du = sin(u) + C = sin(1e6 t) + C.

So v(t) = sin(1e6 t) + C. Applying v(0)=1 → 1 = sin(0) + C → C=1. So v(t) = 1 + sin(1e6 t). 

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 1 + sin(1e6 t). So that would be the answer. 

But wait, wait another thing. Oh, wait! Wait a minute. Wait, the current through a capacitor is i_C(t) = C dv/dt. But in some cases, like for a resistor, current is I=V/R, but for a capacitor, current is I= C dV/dt. So the setup is correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is 1 + sin(1e6 t). So that's what I get. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me think again. The current is given as cos(1e6 t). So the charge across the capacitor is Q(t) = ∫i_C(t) dt. So Q(t) = ∫ cos(1e6 t) dt. Which is (1/(1e6)) sin(1e6 t) + Q0, where Q0 is initial charge. Q0 is C * ν_c(0) = 1e-6 farad * 1 V = 1e-6 C. So Q(t) = (1e-6) sin(1e6 t) + 1e-6.

Then, the voltage is Q(t)/C. So ν_c(t) = [1e-6 sin(1e6 t) + 1e-6 ] / 1e-6 = sin(1e6 t) + 1. Which matches what I had before. So that's correct.

Wait, but what about option E and others? Let me check.

Option E: 1 + cos(1e4 t). Hmm, why 1e4? Oh, because 1e6 is the frequency? Or no, because the current is cos(1e6 t), so the angular frequency is 1e6 rad/s. So the frequency is 1e6/(2π) Hz, but the options don't seem to match that. So probably not E.

Option A: 1 + cos(1e6 t). So that would require that the initial conditions have a cos term. But when I integrate, the solution is a sine function, not a cosine. Because the integral of cos is sin, not cos. So option A would not be correct.

Option B: 1 + sin(1e6 t), which matches.

Option H: 1 - sin(1e6 t). So that's 1 - sin(...), but my solution is 1 + sin(...). So H is not correct.

Option C: 1 - cos(1e6 t). That also seems wrong.

So the correct answer must be option B. But wait, looking back, the options are A to J, and here the correct choice is B. However, let me check the time units. Oh wait, the current is given as cos(1e6 t), which is the same as cos(ω t), where ω=1e6 rad/s. So correct setup.

To solve the problem, we start by using the relationship between current and voltage for a capacitor: 

\[
i_C(t) = C \frac{d\nu_c(t)}{dt}.
\]

Given \(C = 10^{-6} \, \text{F}\) and \(i_C(t) = \cos(10^6 t)\), we substitute into the equation:

\[
\frac{d\nu_c(t)}{dt} = \frac{1}{C} \cos(10^6 t) = 10^6 \cos(10^6 t).
\]

Next, we integrate \( \frac{d\nu_c(t)}{dt} \) to find \(\nu_c(t)\):

\[
\nu_c(t) = \int 10^6 \cos(10^6 t) \, dt.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 10^6 t\), \(du = 10^6 dt\), the integral becomes:

\[
\nu_c(t) = \int \cos(u) \, du = \sin(u) + C = \sin(10^6 t) + C.
\]

Applying the initial condition \(\nu_c(0) = 1\):

\[
\nu_c(0) = \sin(0) + C = 0 + C = 1 \implies C = 1.
\]

Thus, the voltage across the capacitor is:

\[
\nu_c(t) = 1 + \sin(10^6 t).
\]

Now, we compare this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \(1 + \cos(10^6 t)\) — Incorrect, as the solution involves \(\sin(10^6 t)\), not \(\cos(10^6 t)\).
- **Option B**: \(1 + \sin(10^6 t)\) — Correct, matches the derived solution.
- **Option C**: \(1 - \cos(10^6 t)\) — Incorrect, as the solution is \(1 + \sin(10^6 t)\).
- **Option D**: \(t \cos(10^6 t)\) — Incorrect, as the solution is a sum of a constant and a sine function.
- **Option E**: \(1 + \cos(10^4 t)\) — Incorrect, as the angular frequency is \(10^6 \, \text{rad/s}\), not \(10^4 \, \text{rad/s}\).
- **Option F**: \(1 - t \cos(10^6 t)\) — Incorrect, as the solution does not involve a time-dependent term like \(t \cos(10^6 t)\).
- **Option G**: \(\sin(10^6 t) - 1\) — Incorrect, as the solution is \(1 + \sin(10^6 t)\), not \(1 - \sin(10^6 t)\).
- **Option H**: \(1 - \sin(10^6 t)\) — Incorrect, as the solution is \(1 + \sin(10^6 t)\).
- **Option I**: \(1 - t \sin(10^6 t)\) — Incorrect, as the solution does not involve a time-dependent term like \(t \sin(10^6 t)\).
- **Option J**: \(1 - t \cos(10^6 t)\) — Incorrect, as the solution does not involve a time-dependent term like \(t \cos(10^6 t)\).

The correct answer is **Option B**.
