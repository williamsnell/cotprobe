Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see. The question is about calculating the remaining grams of a radioactive material after a certain time. 

The given data is that the half-life is 36 minutes, and the initial amount is 10 grams. The time given is 2 hours. Hmm, half-life problems usually involve using the formula for radioactive decay. I remember the formula is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t1/2), where N is the remaining amount, N0 is the initial amount, t is the time elapsed, and t1/2 is the half-life.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Oh right, because half-life is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. So, I can use this formula. But first, I need to convert the time from hours to minutes because the half-life is given in minutes. So 2 hours is 120 minutes. Right.

So t is 120 minutes, t1/2 is 36 minutes. Plugging into the formula: N = 10 * (1/2)^(120/36). Let's compute the exponent first. 120 divided by 36. Let's see, 36 times 3 is 108, so 36*3.333 is 120. So 120/36 is 3.333... (which is 10/3). Wait, that's about 3 and a third.

So (1/2) raised to the power of 3.333. Hmm. Let me think about that. 2^3 is 8, and 2^3.333 would be like 2^(10/3), but that's not a standard exponent. Alternatively, I can think of it as 2^(10/3) = (2^10)^(1/3) = 1024^(1/3). What's the cube root of 1024? Well, 10^3 is 1000, so cube root of 1000 is 10. 1024 is a bit more than 1000. So cube root of 1024 is about 10.08. So 1/ that is about 0.0992.

Wait, but wait again. Because 1/2^(10/3) is (2^(-10/3)) which is 1/(2^(10/3)) = 1/( (2^3) * (2^(1/3)) ) ) = 1/(8 * cube root of 2). The cube root of 2 is approximately 1.26, so 8*1.26=10.08. So 1/10.08 is about 0.0992.

Wait, but I'm using the formula N = 10 * (0.5)^(120/36) which is 10 * (0.5)^(3.333). So that's 10 multiplied by 0.0992, which is about 0.992 grams.

Wait, but wait, wait. Because 3.333 is actually 10/3. So 1/2^10/3 is the same as 2^(-10/3) which is 1/(2^(10/3)).

Wait, but 2^(10/3) is the same as cube root of 2^10. 2^10 is 1024. So cube root of 1024 is approximately 10.08. So 1024^(1/3) = ~10.08, so 1/10.08 is about 0.0992. So 10 grams times that is about 0.992 grams remaining.

But wait, looking at the options, I don't see an option that's about 0.992 grams. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 1.5e-4 grams — that's like 0.00015 grams. Way too small.

B: 2.50 grams — probably not, since it's more than the initial 10 grams.

C:3.33 grams — that's more than 10, impossible.

D:4 grams — also too high, initial is 10, it can't exceed that.

E:1 gram — possible, but approx 0.99 is about 1, but the options don't have 0.99.

F:0.5 grams — possible, but wait, 0.5 is less than 1.

Wait, our calculation was about 0.992 grams. The closest option is E) 1.00 grams. So why isn't the answer E?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, 2^10 is 1024. So 2^(10/3) is the cube root of 1024, which is approx 10.08. So 1/10.08 is about 0.0992. So 10 * 0.0992 = 0.992 grams. So approximately 0.992 grams. So the closest option is E) 1.00 grams.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach. Let's compute (1/2)^(10/3). Let's compute the exponent: 10/3 is approximately 3.333333.

So, 1/2^3.333333 = 1/(2^3 * 2^(0.333333)) )= 1/(8 * 2^(1/3)).

What's 2^(1/3)? Approximately 1.259921. Because 1.26^3 is (approx) 2.

So 8 *1.259921 is 10.07937.

So 1/(10.07937) is approximately 0.0992.

So 10 * 0.0992 = 0.992 grams.

So approximately 0.992 grams remains. Looking at the options, the only option near that is E)1.00 grams.

But wait—could I have made a mistake in the conversion of time?

Wait, 2 hours is 120 minutes. Half-life is 36 minutes. So 120 divided by 36 is 3.333... Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t₁/₂). So t is the elapsed time, which is correct.

But wait, another approach is to compute the number of half-lives passed. So 2 hours is 120 minutes. 120 /36 is 3.333... So that's 3 and a third half-lives.

Hmm, but wait, when you have a fractional number of half-lives, does that affect the calculation? Because each half-life is a discrete step. So, for example, each half-life reduces the amount by half. So, after 3 half-lives, the amount would be 10 * (1/2)^3 = 1.25 grams. But with 3.333 half-lives, it's more complicated.

Wait, the formula is correct, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 3.333 half-lives is 10*(1/2)^3.333333.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 10*(1/2)^(10/3). Let me compute (1/2)^(10/3) as 2^(-10/3).

Alternatively, using logarithms.

Take natural log: ln( (1/2)^(10/3) ) = (10/3)*ln(1/2) = (10/3)*(-ln2) ≈ (10/3)*(-0.6931) ≈ (-10/3)*0.6931 ≈ (-3.3333)*0.6931 ≈ -2.3104.

Exponentiating, e^-2.3104 ≈ about 0.0995.

So 10 * 0.0995 ≈ 0.995 grams. So about 0.995 grams. So approximately 0.995 grams.

Looking at the options, the closest is E)1.00 grams. So the answer would be E.

But wait, let me think again. The possible answers don't have E as approximating 0.995. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

The formula is correct. N = N0 * (1/2)^(t/t_half). So t is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 120 /36 is 3.333333.

So N =10 * (0.5)^(10/3) =10 * (approx 0.0995) =0.995 grams.

So approximately 1 gram. So the answer is E.

To solve the problem, the formula for radioactive decay is used: 

\[
N = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{t_{\text{1/2}}}}
\]

where:
- \(N_0 = 10.00 \, \text{grams}\) (initial amount),
- \(t = 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{minutes}\),
- \(t_{\text{1/2}} = 36 \, \text{minutes}\).

First, calculate the exponent:

\[
\frac{t}{t_{\text{1/2}}} = \frac{120}{36} = 3.333\ldots
\]

Next, compute \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{3.333}\). Recognizing that \(3.333 = \frac{10}{3}\), we find:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{10/3} = \frac{1}{2^{10/3}} = \frac{1}{2^3 \cdot 2^{1/3}} = \frac{1}{8 \cdot 1.26} \approx \frac{1}{10.08} \approx 0.0992
\]

Now, calculate the remaining amount:

\[
N = 10.00 \cdot 0.0992 \approx 0.992 \, \text{grams}
\]

The closest option to this value is **E: 1.00 grams**. Thus, the correct answer is:
