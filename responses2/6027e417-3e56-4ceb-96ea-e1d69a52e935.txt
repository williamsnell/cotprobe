Alright, so I've got this problem here about coloring edges of a complete graph with two colors—red and blue. The question is asking for the smallest n that guarantees either a red triangle (3-clique) or a blue 6-clique. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

I remember something about Ramsey numbers. Ramsey's theorem deals with conditions under which order must appear. Specifically, R(s, t) is the smallest number such that any graph of that size contains either a red clique of size s or a blue clique of size t when edges are colored with two colors. So in this case, s would be 3 and t would be 6. So we're looking for R(3,6).

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact values of Ramsey numbers. I think for R(3,3), it's 6. That's because any coloring of a complete graph of 6 vertices will have either a red triangle or a blue triangle. Oh right, that's the classic problem. But what about larger numbers like R(3,6)?

Let me try to recall. I think R(3,4) is 9. Because any 2-coloring of K9 will have either a red triangle or a blue 4-clique. But I'm not sure about R(3,6). I think it's higher. Maybe 17 or 18? Or perhaps I should think about the general approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the pigeonhole principle or some combinatorial arguments. Let's think about each vertex's edges. For each vertex, it has n-1 edges. Each edge is either red or blue. So for a vertex v, the number of edges from v to other vertices is n-1. By the pigeonhole principle, at least ceil((n-1)/2) edges must be the same color, say red. So for each vertex, there must be a large number of red edges.

Suppose there's a vertex v connected via red edges to k other vertices. Then, among these k vertices, if any two are connected by a red edge, we have a red triangle. If not, all the edges among these k are blue, which would form a blue clique.

Wait, but the problem is about a 6-clique in blue, so maybe I need to ensure that, among some subset of the graph, there's enough blue edges to form such a clique.

Alternatively, I can model this as a graph where each vertex's red edges form a graph, and if that graph is large enough, it must contain a triangle. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe the approach is to use the concept of Ramsey numbers. The value R(s,t) is the smallest n such that any red-blue edge coloring of K_n contains a red K_s or a blue K_t. So for s=3, t=6, what is R(3,6)? I'm not too sure, but I think it's 17. Or maybe 18?

Wait, another approach is to use the Ramsey number formula for R(s,t). I remember that for R(s,t), it's known that for s=3, R(3,t)=2t-1. Because any two-coloring of K_{2t-1} contains a red triangle or a blue K_t. So for t=6, R(3,6) would be 2*6 -1=11? Wait, no that can't be because I think R(3,6) is higher. Wait, maybe I'm confusing it.

Wait, no, I think the formula R(s,t) ≤ 2*s*t -1. So for R(3,6), it's 2*3*6 -1 =35. But that's an upper bound. Lower bounds are known, like R(3,6) is at least 17. Because I remember R(3,4)=9, R(3,5)=14, maybe R(3,6)=17. So for this problem, n=17 would guarantee a red triangle or a blue 6-clique. So the smallest n is 17, which is option F.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. I'm not entirely confident. Another way to think about it is using induction or Turán's theorem. Turán's theorem gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. But how does that apply here?

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for known Ramsey numbers. From what I recall, R(3,6) is indeed 17. Let me confirm this. Another approach is considering that if n is 17, then by Ramsey's theorem, any 2-coloring of K_17 must contain either a red triangle or a blue K6. So the minimal n is 17, which is option F. So the answer should be F.

The problem asks for the smallest n such that any 2-edge-coloring of a complete graph K_n contains either a red triangle or a blue 6-clique. This is a Ramsey number problem. Specifically, R(3,6) is the smallest n where this holds. The value R(3,6) is known to be 17. Therefore, the smallest n is 17.

Answer: F
