Okay, so I have this question about a worker's productivity on an assembly line. Let me try to break it down. 

The question says a worker takes 7 hours to produce 22 parts. I need to find out how many parts she can make in 35 hours. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm, I think I should find the rate at which she produces parts. So, if she makes 22 parts in 7 hours, what's the rate per hour? Oh right, it's parts per hour. So I'll divide the number of parts by the hours. That gives me 22 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 22 ÷ 7 equals approximately 3.142 parts per hour. Wait, actually, maybe I should keep it as a fraction for accuracy. 22/7, which is about 3.142. 

But wait, I think I don't need to calculate the exact rate, because if I'm scaling it up from 7 hours to 35, I can multiply the rate by 35. Alternatively, I can set up a proportion. The original time is 7 hours for 22 parts. So for 35 hours, how many parts?

So the proportion would be 22 parts /7 hours = x parts /35 hours. Solving for x, I can cross-multiply: 7x = 22 *35. Let me compute that. 22 times 35. 20*35=700, 2*35=70, so 700+70=770. So 7x=770. Then x=770/7=110. So she can produce 110 parts in 35 hours. 

Looking at the options, option A is 110 parts. So that's the answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me double-check. Alternatively, calculating the rate: 22/7 ≈3.142 parts per hour. Multiply by 35: 3.142 *35 ≈110. Yep, that matches. So the correct answer is A:110 parts.

The worker's rate is 22 parts per 7 hours. To find the number of parts in 35 hours, we calculate (22/7) * 35 = 110 parts. 

Answer: A: 110 parts
