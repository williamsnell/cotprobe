Okay, so I've got this problem here about Finch Analysts installing a new computer terminal. The question is about figuring out when they should replace the terminal. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that the average cost of repair is $50 per repair. Oh wait, so each time they have a repair, it costs $50. Then it says that if the terminal is in service for t years, the number of breakdowns is about t^4/3. So the number of times they need to repair it during t years is proportional to t to the power of 4/3.

The replacement cost is $250. So every time they replace the terminal, it costs them $250. The question is asking when they should get a new terminal, which I assume means when the total expected repair cost over the years exceeds the replacement cost, so they have to replace it then.

So I think the approach here is to calculate the total expected repair cost over t years and find the t where this cost equals $250. That would be the break-even point, right?

Let me set up the equation. The total cost (TC) would be the number of breakdowns multiplied by the cost per repair. So TC = number_of_breakdowns * 50.

The number of breakdowns is t^(4/3). So substituting that in:

TC = t^(4/3) * 50

We want to find t when TC equals 250, because that's when the total cost of repairs equals the replacement cost, so it's time to replace.

So: 50 * t^(4/3) = 250

Divide both sides by 50:

t^(4/3) = 5

Now, to solve for t, I'll need to raise both sides to the power of 3/4 to get t by itself.

t = (5)^(3/4)

Hmm, calculating 5^(3/4). Let me think about that. 5^(1/4) is the fourth root of 5. The fourth root of 5 is about 1.495 because 2^4 is 16, which is more than 5, but 1.495^4 is approximately 5. So 1.495^3 is approximately (1.495 * 1.495) = 2.235, then *1.495 ≈ 3.348. So 5^(3/4) ≈ 3.348.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Because 5^(3/4) is the same as the fourth root of 5 cubed. Or perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me use logarithms.

Alternatively, maybe using exponents. 5^(3/4) is e^( (3/4)*ln(5) ). Let's compute ln(5) ≈ 1.6094. Multiply by 3/4: 1.6094 * 0.75 ≈ 1.207. Then e^1.207 ≈ about 3.348.

So t ≈ 3.348 years. But looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are A:8.5, B:7.6, C:11.2, D:4, E:6.4, F:12.5, G:9, H:3.8, I:10, J:5.

Wait, 3.34 years isn't an option. That suggests I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check the setup.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me re-read the problem.

The number of breakdowns is about t^4/3. So t is the number of years? Wait, no, the question says "should the terminal be in service for t years," so t is the time. So t is the number of years since installation.

Wait, but wait, the cost is $50 per repair, and the number of breakdowns is t^4/3. So the total cost is 50 * t^(4/3). We set that equal to 250.

Wait, but if that gives t ≈3.348, which isn't an option. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the equation. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Maybe the cost per repair is $50 per year, not per repair. Wait, the problem says "the average cost of repair will be $50 per repair." So each time they have a repair, it costs $50. So the cost depends on how many times they have to repair it over t years.

But the problem says the number of breakdowns is t^4/3. So for t years, number of breakdowns is t^(4/3).

Thus, total repair cost is 50 * t^(4/3).

Set that equal to 250:

50 * t^(4/3) = 250

t^(4/3) = 5

t = 5^(3/4). Wait, but earlier I thought 5^(3/4) is about 3.348, which isn't an option. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, the closest I have is option J:5 years. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate 5^(3/4) more accurately. Let me compute it step by step.

Compute 5^(1/4) first: the fourth root of 5.

5^(1/4) = e^( (1/4) * ln5 ) ≈ e^(0.4024) ≈ 1.495.

Then 5^(3/4) = (5^(1/4))^3 ≈ (1.495)^3 ≈ approx 3.35.

So t ≈ 3.35 years. But again, that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the formula is t^ (4/3) but I'm supposed to take t as the number of years, but the way the problem is worded is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the cost is $50 per year of operation, not per repair. Let me consider that possibility.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "the average cost of repair will be $50 per repair and should the terminal be in service for t years, the number of breakdowns will be about t^4/3." So each repair costs $50, and the number of repairs needed is t^4/3.

So total cost is 50 * t^(4/3). When does this equal 250? So 50 * t^(4/3) = 250.

Which leads to t^(4/3)=5, so t=5^(3/4)=~3.35. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula. Maybe the number of breakdowns is t^ (4/3), but t is measured in some other units, or perhaps the formula is t^(4/3) per year? Or maybe the formula is t^(4/3) multiplied by 50.

Wait, perhaps the cost per repair is $50, and each repair takes (t) years. So the total cost is 50 * t * t^(4/3) ?

Wait, that would be 50 * t^(7/3). But that doesn't make sense because each repair is for t years, which doesn't align. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of breakdowns during t years is t^(4/3). So the total number of repairs is t^(4/3). So each repair is $50. So the total repair cost is 50 * t^(4/3). And that's set to 250.

Wait, but that's the same as before. So 50 * t^(4/3) = 250 → t^(4/3)=5 → t=5^(3/4)=~3.35. But this isn't an option. So perhaps the formula is t^ (4/3) times 50 equals 250.

Wait, maybe I should set up the equation correctly. So:

50 * (t^(4/3)) = 250.

Divide both sides by 50: t^(4/3) = 5.

Then t =5^(3/4). Which is approximately 3.348 years. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the number of breakdowns is t^ (4/3), but t is in months or another unit? Or perhaps the formula is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is t^(3/4) multiplied by 50, which would make the equation t^(3/4)=5, leading to t=5^(4/3)= approx 8.55, which is option A:8.5.

Wait, that would make sense. Because 5^(4/3) is (5^(1/3))^4. 5^(1/3) is approximately 1.7099. 1.7099^4 is approx (3.259)^2 ≈ 10.61. Wait, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let's think again: if t is the number of years, then the number of breakdowns is t^(4/3). So if t=8.5, t^(4/3) would be (8.5)^(4/3). Let me compute that.

8.5 is about 8.5^1.333. Let's compute 8.5^(1/3) ≈ 2.06, so 2.06^4 ≈ (2.06^2)^2 → (4.2436)^2 ≈ 18.007. So 50 *18.007= 900.35, which is way more than 250. So that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me re-examine the problem. Oh wait, no, the number of breakdowns is t^(4/3), so 50 * t^(4/3) = 250, so t^(4/3)=5. So t is 5^(3/4)=approx 3.348 years. But this doesn't match any option. So perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, perhaps the formula is t^(3/4), not t^(4/3). Let me try that. If it's t^(3/4), then:

50 * t^(3/4) = 250 → t^(3/4)=5 → t =5^(4/3)= about (5^(1/3))^4. 5^(1/3) is ~1.7099, so 1.7099^4 ≈ (3.259)^2 ≈ 10.61. So t≈10.61 years, which is option I:10 years.

But that's not matching the calculation. So perhaps the formula is correct as t^(4/3). So maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the number of breakdowns is t^(4/3) per year, not the total. No, the problem says "the number of breakdowns will be about t^4/3" for t years, so it's t^4/3 total.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the number of breakdowns is t^ (4/3) per year, which would make the total number of breakdowns over t years t^(4/3) * t = t^(7/3). But that would be 50 * t^(7/3) =250 → t^(7/3)=5 → t=5^(3/7).

5^(3/7) is about e^( (3/7)*ln5 ) ≈ e^( (3/7)*1.6094 ) ≈ e^(0.689) ≈ 1.992. So t≈2 years. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the cost is $50 per year of operation, not per repair. Let me consider that scenario. So the total cost would be 50*t, and set that equal to 250.

So 50t =250 → t=5 years. That's option J. But the problem says the cost per repair is $50, and the number of breakdowns is t^(4/3). So each repair is for a year, I think. So each time they have a repair, it's a year, so the total cost would be 50 * t^(4/3), where t is the number of years.

But this brings me back to the same equation. So perhaps t is not the number of years, but the number of operations. Alternatively, maybe I should model it as cost per year, so each repair takes a year, so the total number of repairs is t^(4/3), and each repair costs $50 per year, so the cost is 50 * t^(4/3).

Wait, perhaps the cost per repair is $50 per repair, but each repair takes a year. So the total cost after t years is 50 * t^(4/3) because each year, the number of breakdowns is t^(4/3), so each repair is a year, so the total number of repairs is t^(4/3), and each is $50. So the total cost is 50 * t^(4/3). So when that equals $250, that's when you should replace.

As before, 50 * t^(4/3) =250 → t^(4/3)=5 → t=5^(3/4)≈3.348 years. But this doesn't match any option.

Looking at the options, the closest is H:3.8 years, which is close to 3.348. But the other options are higher: 5, 6.4, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the number of breakdowns is t^(3/4). Let me try that.

So if number of breakdowns is t^(3/4), then the total cost is 50 * t^(3/4). Setting that equal to 250 gives t^(3/4)=5 → t=5^(4/3)= approx 8.55 years, which is option A:8.5.

But wait, that would mean the number of breakdowns is t^(3/4), which is less than t^(4/3) for the same t. So perhaps I had the formula backwards. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the number of breakdowns is t^(4/3), and each repair costs $50. So the total cost is 50 * t^(4/3). Setting that to 250 gives t=5^(3/4) ≈3.348. But none of the options have this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as the number of repairs is t^(4/3) per year, so the total number of repairs after t years is t^(7/3). Wait, no, because each year, they have t^(4/3) repairs. So after t years, the total number would be t^(4/3) * t = t^(7/3). Then the total cost would be 50 * t^(7/3). Setting that equal to 250:

50 *t^(7/3) =250 → t^(7/3)=5 → t=5^(3/7).

5^(3/7) is about 5^0.4286. Let's compute 5^0.4286. Since 5^0.4 is about 2.236, and 5^0.4286 is a bit higher. Let's approximate. 5^0.4 = 2.236, 5^0.4286= ?

Well, 0.4286 is approximately 3/7. So 5^(3/7) = cube root of 5^(1/7). 5^(1/7) is about 1.257, so cube root of that is approximately 1.078. So t≈1.078 years, which isn't an option.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A:8.5

B:7.6

C:11.2

D:4

E:6.4

F:12.5

G:9

H:3.8

I:10

J:5

So among these, the closest to my calculation is H:3.8, which is about 3.8 years. Alternatively, option A is 8.5, which is about 3.348*2.5. But I don't see where the discrepancy is coming from.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the cost per repair is $50 per year, not per repair. So the total cost after t years would be 50 * t repairs. So 50t = 250 → t=5 years (option J).

But that would imply that the number of breakdowns is 5, but according to the formula given, the number of breakdowns is t^(4/3). So at t=5, number of breakdowns is 5^(4/3)= about 8.549. So 8.5 repairs, each costing $50. So 8.5 *50=425, which is way more than 250. So that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct approach is t^(4/3) is the number of breakdowns, each costing $50. So the total cost is 50 * t^(4/3). Set that to 250: 50 * t^(4/3)=250 → t^(4/3)=5 → t=5^(3/4)=approx 3.348.

But again, this is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is t^(3/4), not t^(4/3).

Wait, perhaps the problem says the number of breakdowns is t^(4/3), but in reality, it's t^(4/3) per year. So after t years, the total number of breakdowns is t^(4/3) * t = t^(7/3). Then the total cost is 50 * t^(7/3) =250 → t^(7/3)=5 → t=5^(3/7)=approx 1.078 years, which is not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's compute t^(4/3) for each option and see.

Option H:3.8 years.

(3.8)^(4/3) = (3.8)^(1.333). Let me compute ln(3.8)=1.335, multiply by 1.333: 1.335 *1.333 ≈1.782. Then e^1.782 ≈5.96. So t^(4/3)=~5.96. Thus, 50 *5.96=298, which is more than 250. So that's not correct.

Option J:5 years. (5)^(4/3)= (5)^(1.333)= approx 8.55. 50 *8.55=427.5, which is more than 250.

Option A:8.5 years. (8.5)^(4/3)= (8.5)^(1.333). Compute ln(8.5)=2.14. Multiply by 1.333: 2.14 *1.333≈2.85. e^2.85≈17.5. So 50 *17.5=875>250.

Option B:7.6 years. (7.6)^(4/3)= (7.6)^(1.333). ln(7.6)=2.028. Multiply by 1.333: 2.028*1.333≈2.709. e^2.709≈15. So 50*15=750>250.

Option C:11.2 years. (11.2)^(4/3)= (11.2)^(1.333). ln(11.2)=2.41. 2.41 *1.333≈3.22. e^3.22≈25. So 50 *25=1250>250.

Option D:4 years. (4)^(4/3)= (4)^(1.333)= 4^(1 + 0.333)=4 *4^(0.333). 4^(1/3)=approx 1.5874. 4^0.333≈cube root of 4^(1)= 1.5874. So 4*1.5874=6.3496. So 50 *6.3496≈3174>250.

Option E:6.4 years. (6.4)^(4/3)= (6.4)^(1.333). ln(6.4)=1.826. Multiply by 1.333: 1.826 *1.333≈2.432. e^2.432≈11.48. So 50 *11.48≈574>250.

Option F:12.5 years. (12.5)^(4/3)= (12.5)^(1.333). ln(12.5)=2.525. Multiply by 1.333: 2.525 *1.333≈3.367. e^3.367≈28.8. 50 *28.8=1440>250.

Option G:9 years. (9)^(4/3)= (9)^(1.333)=9^(1 + 0.333)=9 *9^(0.333). 9^(1/3)=2.08. So 9*2.08≈18.72. 50 *18.72≈936>250.

Option I:10 years. (10)^(4/3)= (10)^(1.333)=10^(1 + 0.333)=10 *10^(0.333). 10^(1/3)=2.1544. 10*2.1544≈21.544. 50*21.544≈1077>250.

Option H:3.8 years. (3.8)^(4/3)= (3.8)^(1.333)=3.8^(1 + 0.333)=3.8 *3.8^(0.333). 3.8^(1/3)=approx 1.55. So 3.8 *1.55≈5.93. 50*5.93≈296.5, which is close to 250. But it's still over.

Wait, but the correct answer according to my initial calculation is about 3.35 years. But that's not an option. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should model it differently. Let me think: the number of breakdowns is t^4/3. Each repair takes a year, so the cost is t^(4/3) repairs * $50 per repair = 50 t^(4/3). So when 50 t^(4/3) = 250 → t^(4/3)=5 → t=5^(3/4)= approx 3.35 years.

But the closest option is H:3.8 years. Which is about 0.45 years higher. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is not present, but the closest is H.

Wait, let me check what 3.8 years gives. 3.8^(4/3) = (3.8)^(1.333). Let me compute 3.8^1.333.

First, 3.8^1=3.8.

3.8^0.333≈ cube root of 3.8^(1/3). Wait, 3.8 is 3.8. Let me compute 3.8^(1/3) first. 3.8^(1/3) ≈1.55. So 3.8^0.333≈1.55^(3) → 1.55 *1.55=2.4025, *1.55≈3.73. So 3.8^(1.333)≈3.8 *3.73≈14.2. So 50 *14.2=710>250.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the number of breakdowns as t^(4/3) per year, not the total. So the total number of breakdowns is t^(4/3) * t = t^(7/3). Then the cost is 50 * t^(7/3). Setting that to 250:

50 * t^(7/3) =250 → t^(7/3)=5 → t=5^(3/7).

5^(3/7)= e^( (3/7)*ln5 ) ≈ e^( (3/7)*1.6094 ) ≈ e^(0.689) ≈1.992. So t≈2 years. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, but I can't see it now. Maybe the correct answer is H:3.8 years, which is the closest to the correct calculation of 3.35, even though it's not exact.
</think>

The analysis involves determining the correct formula and solving for the time when the total repair cost equals $250. The correct formula is set up as the cost per repair multiplied by the number of breakdowns, leading to:

50 * t^(4/3) = 250 → t^(4/3) = 5 → t ≈ 3.35 years.

Among the options provided, the closest match is **H:3.8 years**, which is the best approximation.

ANSWER: H
