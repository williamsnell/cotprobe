Alright, so I've got this problem about wetted wall columns and absorption rates, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step.

Okay, the question says that the coefficient K_G for the absorption of SO2 in air by water at 70°F is 0.068 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm. Then it says that the resistance of gas and liquid films are equal when absorbing SO2. The diffusivities of SO2 and NH3 at 49°F are given as 0.115 and 0.168 cm²/sec respectively. I need to find the value of K_G for the absorption of NH3 in water at 49°F, assuming all other conditions are the same.

Hmm, I remember that in wetted wall columns, the mass transfer coefficient (or overall mass transfer coefficient) K is given by K = (D_L / (1 - x_L)) )^(1/2), where D_L is the diffusion coefficient and x_L is the liquid phase concentration. Oh wait, no, wait. Or maybe it's K = (D / (1 - x))^(1/2), where D is the diffusion coefficient of the species, and x is the ratio of the concentration in the gas phase to the liquid phase. 

Wait, another thought: the overall mass transfer coefficient K is related to the diffusion coefficient D by K = sqrt(D / (1 - x)), where x is the amount transferred. So higher D means higher K.

But wait, in a wetted wall column, the resistance (R) is sum of the gas film resistance (R_g) and the liquid film resistance (R_l). And the overall resistance R = R_g + R_l. If R_g = R_l, then R = 2 R_g.

Wait, the problem states that the resistance of gas and liquid films are equal. So R_g = R_l. So each resistance is R/2.

The mass transfer rate is given by m = K * A * C_in, where A is the area, C_in is the concentration in the gas phase. But K depends on the diffusion coefficient and the resistance.

Wait, perhaps the mass transfer coefficient K is given by K = (D / (1 - x))^(1/2) * (1 / sqrt(R)), because R = (1/(k_L A)) (something), but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe K = (D / (1 - x))^(1/2) * (1/(sqrt(R_g) + sqrt(R_l)) )) since R = R_g + R_l and R_g=R_l.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the overall mass transfer coefficient. K is such that m = K * A * (C_in - C_out). And K is given by (D / (1 - x))^(1/2) * (1 / sqrt(R)), where R is the total resistance. But since R_g = R_l, R = 2 R_g, so sqrt(R) = sqrt(2 R_g) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(R_g).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach.

The problem gives K for SO2 absorption in air by water at 70°F as 0.068 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm. Then the question is about NH3 at 49°F. Wait, but the temperatures are different here. Oh, but the question says "all other conditions are the same." Hmm, wait. So perhaps the temperatures are different (70 vs 49), but other conditions are the same, such as the same area, same pressure, same flow rate, etc. So I need to adjust the K values based on temperature.

Wait, but K for a wetted wall is generally temperature-dependent. Oh, but the problem might be using the same setup, so perhaps the diffusivity is given at 49°F, which is a different temperature from where the K was measured (70°F). So I need to find K for NH3 at 49°F, using the same area and conditions.

Wait, but the question is about finding K for NH3 absorption, given that the conditions are the same, but the temperature is different. So perhaps I can use the Arrhenius equation? Because K is temperature-dependent and can be modeled by the Arrhenius equation.

Wait, the Arrhenius equation is K = K0 * exp(-Ea/(R T)) ), where K0 is a constant and Ea is activation energy. But I don't have Ea, so maybe that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, there might be a relationship between the K values at two different temperatures. If the overall mass transfer coefficient is proportional to the square root of the diffusivity and inversely proportional to the square root of temperature (since K is proportional to sqrt(D) / sqrt(T)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the overall mass transfer coefficient is K = (D / (1 - x))^(1/2) * (1 / sqrt(R)), and R is the same for both species, so perhaps K is proportional to sqrt(D) / sqrt(T), assuming (1 - x) is similar or the same.

Wait, but the problem states that the resistance R_g and R_l are equal. So R = 2 R_g. So for each gas and liquid, R = R_g + R_l = 2 R_g, so each R is half the total.

Wait, but K is the overall mass transfer coefficient, which is K = (D/(1-x))^(1/2) * (1/sqrt(R)), since R = R_g + R_l = 2 R_g. So K = (D/(1-x))^(1/2) * (1/(sqrt(2 R_g)) )).

But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe another approach: mass transfer coefficient K for a wetted wall is given by K = (D / (1 - x))^(1/2) * (1 / sqrt(R)), where R is the total resistance. Since R is 2 R_g (since R_g = R_l), so sqrt(R) = sqrt(2 R_g).

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Maybe I should look for the equation that links K, D, and resistance.

Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that for a wetted wall column, the overall mass transfer coefficient K is given by K = sqrt(D / (1 - x)) / sqrt(R), where R is the total resistance. Since R is the sum of the gas and liquid resistances, and they're equal, R = 2 R_g.

So K = sqrt(D / (1 - x)) / sqrt(2 R_g) = (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(D/(1-x R_g)).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the overall mass transfer coefficient. Let me try to write down what's given.

Given:
K_SOS (SO2) = 0.068 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm at 70°F.

We need to find K_NH3 at 49°F.

But how do we relate these two? The question says that the resistance of gas and liquid films are equal when SO2 is being absorbed. So for SO2, R_g = R_l. So each resistance is R = R_g = R_l = R_total / 2.

Wait, but for the absorption of NH3, the resistance may be different. Wait, no, the problem says that in the case of SO2, the resistance of gas and liquid films are equal, implying that the resistance is the same for both when SO2 is being absorbed. So for NH3, are the resistances the same? Or is that condition only for SO2?

Wait, the question states that for the absorption of SO2, the resistances are equal. So when considering the absorption of NH3, perhaps the resistances are different. Hmm, but the problem says all other conditions are the same. So perhaps NH3's resistance is different, but in the same setup, or is it the same as the SO2 case?

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering that for both absorption processes (SO2 and NH3), the resistance of the gas and liquid films are equal. So R_g = R_l for both. So each resistance is R_total / 2.

Wait, but the problem states that the resistance of gas and liquid films are equal in the absorption of SO2, which is given as 0.068 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm. So for the absorption of SO2, the R_g = R_l. So each resistance is (R_total)/2.

But now, when considering absorption of NH3, the setup is the same, so R_g and R_l are equal. Therefore, for NH3, R_g = R_l, so each is R_total/2.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the only difference is that the temperature is different, and so the value of K changes based on temperature.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting me to use the Arrhenius equation, assuming that the overall mass transfer coefficient K is proportional to the square root of the diffusivity divided by the square root of the temperature.

So K ∝ sqrt(D / T), where T is the absolute temperature.

Wait, but D here is the diffusion coefficient. Wait, but in the wetted wall column, the mass transfer coefficient (K) is related to the diffusion coefficient (D) of the species and the temperature.

Let me think: The overall mass transfer coefficient K is given by K = sqrt( (2 D ) / (1 - x) ) * (1 / sqrt(R)). But if R is the total resistance, and for SO2, R is 2 R_g (since R_g = R_l), then K = sqrt(D/(1-x)) / sqrt(R) = sqrt(D/(1-x)) / sqrt(2 R_g).

Wait, but maybe for the same (1-x) and same R_g, K is proportional to sqrt(D) / sqrt(T) because D is temperature-dependent.

Wait, if K is proportional to sqrt(D) / sqrt(T), then K1 / K2 = sqrt( D1 / D2 ) * sqrt( T2 / T1 ).

So K for NH3 (K_NH3) would be K_SOS * sqrt( (D_SOS / D_NH3) ) * sqrt( T_NH3 / T_SOS ).

Wait, but wait: the problem says that the diffusivities are given at 49°F. So perhaps D is given at 49°F, but the K we found is for 70°F. So to find K_NH3 at 49°F, I need to adjust it.

Alternatively, perhaps I have to compute K for NH3 at 49°F, using the same (1-x) and same R, but D is given at 49°F, so I can relate K_NH3 to K_SOS.

Wait, but the K for the same (1 - x) and same R would be the same for both species, but since the conditions are the same, perhaps (1-x) and R are same, but D is different.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to look for a formula that connects K to D and T.

I think the overall mass transfer coefficient K is given by: 

K = (D / (1 - x))^(1/2) * (1 / sqrt(R)), 

where R is the total resistance (R = R_g + R_l).

But since R_g = R_l = R_total / 2, then R = 2 R_g.

So K = (D / (1 - x))^(1/2) * (1 / sqrt(2 R_g)).

But since in the case of SO2, R_g is given as 70°F (but I'm not sure if the temperature here is 70°F or 49°F. Wait, the problem states that the first K is 0.068 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm at 70°F. So the first K is at 70°F. The K we need is at 49°F.

Wait, but in the formula, K depends on D and T. So for the same (1 - x) and R, K is proportional to sqrt(D) / sqrt(T).

So in the case of SO2:

K_SOS = sqrt(D_SOS) / sqrt(T_SOS).

And for NH3:

K_NH3 = sqrt(D_NH3) / sqrt(T_NH3).

But wait, wait. Because R is the same for both species, but R is influenced by (1 - x) and the mass transfer coefficients. Hmm, perhaps the (1 - x) is the same for both.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem states that the resistance of gas and liquid films are equal for the absorption of SO2. So R_g = R_l for SO2.

But for NH3, if the setup is the same, then R_g and R_l would be the same as well. Thus, R_g = R_l = R_total / 2.

Wait, but if that's the case, then for both species, R is the same. So the total resistance is same.

But the K for each species would be functions of D and T.

But how to relate the two Ks.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup is such that for the same (1 - x), the K is proportional to sqrt(D) / sqrt(T), as in K = (D / (1 - x))^(1/2) ) / sqrt(R), and since R is same, K is proportional to sqrt(D)/sqrt(T).

So K is proportional to sqrt(D) / sqrt(T).

So for the two cases:

K1 = sqrt(D1) / sqrt(T1)

K2 = sqrt(D2) / sqrt(T2)

So K2 = K1 * sqrt(D2/D1) * sqrt(T1/T2)

Wait, let me write it correctly.

K2 = (sqrt(D2) / sqrt(T2)) ) = (sqrt(D2) / sqrt(T2)) )

But K1 = (sqrt(D1) / sqrt(T1)) )

So K2 = K1 * (sqrt(D2/D1)) * (sqrt(T1/T2)).

Wait, let me see: K2 = K1 * (sqrt(D2/D1)) * (sqrt(T1 / T2)).

Wait, because:

K2 = sqrt(D2) / sqrt(T2) = [sqrt(D2)/sqrt(T2)] = [sqrt(D2)/sqrt(T2)] * [sqrt(D1)/sqrt(D1)] * [sqrt(T1)/sqrt(T1)].

Wait, perhaps it's better to write K2 = K1 * sqrt(D2/D1) * sqrt(T1 / T2).

Because:

K2 = (sqrt(D2) / sqrt(T2)) )

= (sqrt(D2) / sqrt(T2)) * (sqrt(D1)/sqrt(D1)) * (sqrt(T1)/sqrt(T1)) )

= (sqrt(D2 * D1) / sqrt(T2 * T1)) ) 

= sqrt( (D1 D2)/(T1 T2) ) 

= sqrt( (D1/D2) * (T2/T1) )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, K2 = (sqrt(D2) / sqrt(T2)) ) 

= sqrt( D2 / T2 )

= sqrt( (D2 / D1) * (D1 / T2) ) 

= sqrt( D2/D1 ) * sqrt( D1 / T2 )

= sqrt( D2/D1 ) * sqrt( D1/( T1 T2 / T1) ) )

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let's try an example.

Suppose K1 = 0.068 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm, which is for SO2 at T1=70°F.

We need K2 for NH3 at T2=49°F, where D2 is the diffusivity of NH3 at 49°F.

Assuming that for the same (1 - x) and same R, for the same (1 - x) and same R, the K is proportional to sqrt(D) / sqrt(T).

So K2 = K1 * sqrt( (D2 / D1) ) * sqrt( T1 / T2 )

Wait, but D1 is the diffusivity of SO2 at 70°F, and D2 is the diffusivity of NH3 at 49°F. But wait, in the problem statement, the diffusivities of SO2 and NH3 are given at 49°F. So D1 is the diffusion coefficient of SO2 at 49°F? Or 70°F?

Wait, the problem says: "the diffusivities of SO2 and NH3 at 49°F are 0.115 and 0.168 cm²/sec, respectively."

Ah, so D1 (SO2) is 0.115 cm²/sec at 49°F, and D2 (NH3) is 0.168 cm²/sec at 49°F. So D1 = D2 for 49°F, but that can't be right because their values are different. Wait, no, because the diffusivities are given at 49°F, but in the problem, the K is found for 70°F, so perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no, the problem says that for the absorption of SO2, the diffusivity is 0.115 cm²/sec at 49°F. No, wait, no. The problem says: "the diffusivities of SO2 and NH3 at 49°F are 0.115 and 0.168 cm²/sec, respectively."

Wait, that's confusing. So D1 (SO2) is 0.115 cm²/sec at 49°F, and D2 (NH3) is 0.168 cm²/sec at 49°F. So for the same temperature, D1 and D2 are different.

But the K we're trying to find is at 49°F. Wait, perhaps the K for NH3 is found at 49°F, and the diffusivity given is at 49°F.

But how does that affect the K calculation, which is based on T?

Wait, but the K is given for 70°F, and we're trying to find K for NH3 at 49°F. Hmm, perhaps the setup of the wetted wall column is the same for both cases (same (1-x), same R, same (1-x)), but the diffusivities are different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is trying to say that the K is calculated using the same (1-x) and same R, but D is given at a different temperature. So we need to adjust K using the Arrhenius equation.

Wait, but in this case, the resistance R is the same for both species, because R_g = R_l. So R is the same for both.

But wait, the problem says that the resistance of the gas and liquid films are equal when SO2 is being absorbed. So for SO2, R_g = R_l. So each is R = R_total / 2.

So for NH3 absorption, if the setup is the same, then R_g and R_l are equal, because the problem doesn't mention any difference in R between the two cases.

Wait, but the problem states for the absorption of SO2, the resistance is equal. It doesn't say anything about NH3. So perhaps the setup for NH3 is the same as for SO2, but the conditions are the same. So how does that affect the K for NH3?

Wait, perhaps the setup is same, so R_g and R_l are equal. So R is R_total / 2 for both cases.

So for NH3, the K would be K_NH3 = (D_NH3 / (1 - x))^(1/2) * (1 / sqrt(R)).

Similarly, for SO2, K_SOS = (D_SOS / (1 - x))^(1/2) * (1 / sqrt(R)).

Wait, but since R is the same for both, K is proportional to sqrt(D) / sqrt(T), since (1 - x) is same.

Wait, no, wait. Let's write it again.

K = (D/(1 - x))^(1/2) * (1 / sqrt(R)).

But since R is same, and (1 - x) is same, K is proportional to sqrt(D) / sqrt(T).

So K1 = sqrt(D1) / sqrt(T1), K2 = sqrt(D2) / sqrt(T2).

Wait, but in our problem, K1 (for SO2) is already given at a specific temperature (70°F). So perhaps I should compute K_NH3 at 49°F, using K as a function of T.

But wait, in the problem, K_SOS is given at 70°F. So perhaps the K is calculated using the Arrhenius equation, where K is proportional to exp(-Ea/(R T)).

Wait, but without Ea, it's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the ratio of K based on temperature.

So, K_NH3 = K_SOS * (D_NH3 / D_SOS) * sqrt( T1 / T2 )

Because K is proportional to sqrt(D) / sqrt(T), so K1/K2 = sqrt(D1/D2) * sqrt(T2/T1).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to approach it step by step.

Given:
K_SOS = 0.068 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm (at 70°F)
We need to find K_NH3 at 49°F.

We know that for each species, K is proportional to sqrt(D) / sqrt(T), where D is the diffusivity and T is the absolute temperature.

So K_NH3 = K_SOS * (sqrt(D_NH3 / D_SOS)) * (sqrt(T_SOS / T_NH3)).

Because K is proportional to sqrt(D) / sqrt(T), so:

K_NH3 / K_SOS = sqrt(D_NH3 / D_SOS) * sqrt(T_SOS / T_NH3)

So K_NH3 = K_SOS * sqrt(D_NH3 / D_SOS) * sqrt(T_SOS / T_NH3)

But wait, the D's are at different temperatures. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the same (1 - x) and same R, so the K is given by:

K = (D/(1 - x))^(1/2) * (1/sqrt(R)).

But without knowing (1 - x) or R, I can't find the constants. So perhaps I can find the ratio between K_NH3 and K_SOS.

Let me write the ratio:

K_NH3 / K_SOS = [ (D_NH3/(1 - x_NH3))^(1/2) * (1/sqrt(R_NH3)) ] / [ (D_SOS/(1 - x_SOS))^(1/2) * (1/sqrt(R_SOS)) ]

But if (1 - x) is same for both, which it probably is, and R is same, then the ratio becomes:

= sqrt( D_NH3 / D_SOS ) * sqrt( R_SOS / R_NH3 )

But R is same, so R_SOS = R_NH3.

Thus,

K_NH3 / K_SOS = sqrt( D_NH3 / D_SOS )

So,

K_NH3 = K_SOS * sqrt( D_NH3 / D_SOS )

So the problem gives D_SOS and D_NH3. Wait, but D_SOS is the diffusivity of SO2 at 70°F, and D_NH3 is the diffusivity of NH3 at 49°F.

Wait, but no, because the problem states that the diffusivities of SO2 and NH3 are given at 49°F. So D_SOS is the diffusivity of SO2 at 49°F, and D_NH3 is the diffusivity of NH3 at 49°F.

Wait, that can't be right because the problem states that the diffusivities are given at 49°F, but in the question, the K is calculated using SO2's K and the diffusivity of NH3.

Wait, I'm getting stuck because I don't know if the problem is considering the same (1 - x), same R, or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the same (1 - x), same R, so K is proportional to sqrt(D)/sqrt(T).

Thus, K_NH3 = K_SOS * (sqrt(D_NH3 / D_SOS)) * (sqrt( T_SOS / T_NH3 )).

But in the problem, the diffusivity of SO2 is given at 70°F, and the diffusivity of NH3 is given at 49°F. But I'm not sure if that's the same (1 - x) or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the (1 - x) is same, so the K is proportional to sqrt(D)/sqrt(T).

So, K_NH3 = K_SOS * (sqrt(D_NH3 / D_SOS)) * (sqrt( T_SOS / T_NH3 )).

Wait, but D_SOS is the diffusivity of SO2 at 70°F, and D_NH3 is the diffusivity of NH3 at 49°F. So perhaps the problem is considering that (1 - x) is same, and R is same, so K is proportional to sqrt(D)/sqrt(T).

So, K_NH3 = K_SOS * sqrt( D_NH3 / D_SOS ) * sqrt( T_SOS / T_NH3 )

But wait, the problem states that the K for SO2 is 0.068 at 70°F. So perhaps we can use that to find the K for NH3.

So, let's plug in the values.

K_NH3 = 0.068 * sqrt( D_NH3 / D_SOS ) * sqrt( T_SOS / T_NH3 )

But D_NH3 is the diffusivity of NH3 at 49°F, which is 0.168 cm²/sec.

D_SOS is the diffusivity of SO2 at 70°F, which is 0.115 cm²/sec.

Wait, but if the (1 - x) is same, then the K is proportional to sqrt(D)/sqrt(T). So, the ratio K_NH3 / K_SOS is sqrt( D_NH3 / D_SOS ) * sqrt( T_SOS / T_NH3 )

Wait, no. Because K is proportional to sqrt(D)/sqrt(T), so K_NH3 / K_SOS = sqrt(D_NH3 / D_SOS) * sqrt( T_SOS / T_NH3 )

Wait, but that can't be, because if D is higher, and T is higher, K would increase.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

If D increases, then K increases for the same T. But if T increases, K decreases for the same D.

So, if D increases and T increases, we can't tell whether K increases or decreases.

But in this case, the problem says that K for NH3 is being calculated, and the K for SO2 is 0.068 at 70°F.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the formula again.

The correct formula for K is:

K = (D / (1 - x))^(1/2) * (1 / sqrt(R)).

But R is the total resistance: R = R_g + R_l.

For the wetted wall column, R_g = R_l = R_total / 2.

So R = R_total / 2.

But (1 - x) is the same for both species, as it is the amount transferred.

Thus, (1 - x) is same for both species.

So, K is proportional to sqrt(D) / sqrt(R), as (1 - x) and R are same.

But since R is same, K is proportional to sqrt(D).

So, K is proportional to sqrt(D).

Thus, K1 / K2 = sqrt(D1) / sqrt(D2)

So,

K_NH3 = K_SOS * (sqrt(D_SOS) / sqrt(D_NH3)) ) * (sqrt(T_SOS) / sqrt(T_NH3)) )

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me rephrase:

Since K is proportional to sqrt(D), and (1 - x) and R are the same for both, K is proportional to sqrt(D).

Thus, K_NH3 = K_SOS * (sqrt(D_SOS) / sqrt(D_NH3)) ) * (sqrt(T_SOS)/sqrt(T_NH3)) )

Wait, but that would mean that if D decreases and T increases, K could increase or decrease.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that K is inversely proportional to sqrt(T) and directly proportional to sqrt(D).

Thus, when T increases, K decreases, and when D increases, K increases.

So, combining these, if D increases and T increases, K can go up or down.

But in this problem, D is given at 70°F, and T is given at 49°F. So D increases (since 168 > 115), and T decreases (since 49 < 70). So, K should increase because D increases and T decreases.

Wait, but D is given at 70°F, and the K we're trying to find is at 49°F. So perhaps I can use the ratio.

Wait, let's compute the ratio K_NH3 / K_SOS.

K_NH3 / K_SOS = ( sqrt( D_NH3 ) / sqrt( T_NH3 ) ) / ( sqrt( D_SOS ) / sqrt( T_SOS ) )

= sqrt( D_NH3 / D_SOS ) * sqrt( T_SOS / T_NH3 )

Thus,

K_NH3 = K_SOS * sqrt( D_NH3 / D_SOS ) * sqrt( T_SOS / T_NH3 )

Now, plugging in the numbers.

D_NH3 = 0.168 cm²/sec

D_SOS = 0.115 cm²/sec

T_SOS = 70°F

T_NH3 = 49°F

So,

K_NH3 = 0.068 * sqrt( 0.168 / 0.115 ) * sqrt( 70 / 49 )

Compute each part.

First, sqrt(0.168 / 0.115) = sqrt(1.4516) ≈ 1.2048

Second, sqrt(70 / 49) = sqrt(1.4286) ≈ 1.1952

Multiply them together:

1.2048 * 1.1952 ≈ 1.440

So,

K_NH3 = 0.068 * 1.440 ≈ 0.09792 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm

So, approximately 0.098 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm.

But let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 0.168 / 0.115 = 1.4516

sqrt(1.4516) = 1.2048

70 / 49 = 1.4286

sqrt(1.4286) = 1.1952

1.2048 * 1.1952 = ?

Let me compute it accurately.

1.2048 * 1.1952:

= (1 + 0.2048) * (1 + 0.1952) 

= 1 + 0.1952 + 0.2048 + (0.2048 * 0.1952)

= 1 + 0.4 + (0.04)

= 1.44

Wait, that's an approximate computation.

But, let's compute it more accurately.

0.2048 * 0.1952:

= (0.2 + 0.0048) * (0.1952) 

= 0.2 * 0.1952 + 0.0048 * 0.1952

= 0.03904 + 0.00093696

= 0.03997696

So,

0.1952 + 0.2048 = 0.4

0.4 + 0.03997696 ≈ 0.43997696

So, 1.2048 * 1.1952 ≈ 1.43997696

So, approximately 1.43998.

Thus, K_NH3 = 0.068 * 1.43998 ≈ 0.068 * 1.44 ≈ 0.09792.

So, about 0.098 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm.

Wait, but the options in the problem may expect a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the ratio based on the temperatures and the square roots of the diffusivities.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the ratio of the K's based on T.

So,

K_NH3 / K_SOS = sqrt( D_NH3 / D_SOS ) * sqrt( T_SOS / T_NH3 )

Which is,

= sqrt( 0.168 / 0.115 ) * sqrt( 70 / 49 )

Which, as computed, is approximately 1.2048 * 1.1952 ≈ 1.43998.

So, K_NH3 = 0.068 * 1.43998 ≈ 0.09792.

So, rounded to three decimal places, about 0.098 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm.

But let me think again—did I miss any step?

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the K is given at a certain temperature, and we need to find the K at another temperature, using the Arrhenius equation.

Wait, but without knowing the activation energy, it's impossible. So perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the K is calculated using the formula K = (D/(1-x))^0.5 * 1/sqrt(R), with R being the total resistance.

So, with R = R_g + R_l, and R_g = R_l.

Thus, R = 2 R_l.

But (1 - x) is the same for both.

Thus, K is proportional to sqrt(D).

Thus, K_NH3 = K_SOS * sqrt( D_SOS / D_NH3 ) * sqrt( T_SOS / T_NH3 )

Which is,

= 0.068 * sqrt( 0.115 / 0.168 ) * sqrt(70/49)

Compute sqrt(0.115/0.168) = sqrt(0.6865) ≈ 0.8287

sqrt(70/49) = sqrt(1.4286) ≈ 1.1952

Multiply them:

0.8287 * 1.1952 ≈ 0.983

Thus,

K_NH3 = 0.068 * 0.983 ≈ 0.0669 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm.

Hmm, that's a different answer, approximately 0.067.

Wait, but this is conflicting with the earlier calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach.

Wait, let's compute both approaches again.

First approach: K_NH3 = 0.068 * sqrt(0.168/0.115) * sqrt(70/49)

Compute sqrt(0.168/0.115) = sqrt(1.4516) ≈ 1.2048

Compute sqrt(70/49) = sqrt(1.42857) ≈ 1.1952

Multiply: 1.2048 * 1.1952 ≈ 1.4399

Multiply by 0.068: 0.068 * 1.4399 ≈ 0.0979

Second approach: K_NH3 = 0.068 * sqrt(0.115/0.168) * sqrt(70/49)

Compute sqrt(0.115/0.168) = sqrt(0.6865) ≈ 0.8287

Multiply by sqrt(70/49) = 1.1952: 0.8287 * 1.1952 ≈ 0.983

Multiply by 0.068: 0.0669

So which approach is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the K is given at 70°F, and I need to find the K at 49°F, which is a decrease in temperature.

But in the first approach, using the formula K is proportional to sqrt(D), with D given at 70°F, and T given at 49°F.

So,

K_NH3 = K_SOS * sqrt( D_SOS / D_NH3 ) * sqrt( T_SOS / T_NH3 )

Which is,

= 0.068 * sqrt( 0.115 / 0.168 ) * sqrt( 70 / 49 )

Which is,

= 0.068 * 0.8287 * 1.1952 ≈ 0.0669

Thus, about 0.067 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm.

But in the other approach, I used the formula K is proportional to sqrt(D), but applied it as:

K_NH3 = K_SOS * sqrt( D_NH3 / D_SOS ) * sqrt( T_SOS / T_NH3 )

Which gives,

= 0.068 * (1.4516)^(1/2) * (1.42857)^(1/2) * (70/49)

Wait, no, the first approach was:

K_NH3 = K_SOS * sqrt( D_SOS / D_NH3 ) * sqrt( T_SOS / T_NH3 )

Which is,

= 0.068 * (0.115 / 0.168)^(1/2) * sqrt(70/49)

Which is,

= 0.068 * (0.6865)^(1/2) * (1.42857)^(1/2)

= 0.068 * 0.8287 * 1.1952 ≈ 0.0669

So, about 0.067.

Thus, the correct answer is approximately 0.067 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm.

But let me check if the problem expects the answer in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the Arrhenius equation, but without the activation energy, it's impossible.

So, I think the correct approach is to use the formula K is proportional to sqrt(D), and compute the ratio accordingly.

So, the answer is approximately 0.067 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute the ratio step by step.

First, sqrt( D_SOS / D_NH3 ) = sqrt( 0.115 / 0.168 ) = sqrt( 0.686517 ) ≈ 0.8287.

Second, sqrt( T_SOS / T_NH3 ) = sqrt( 70 / 49 ) = sqrt( 1.428571 ) ≈ 1.1952.

Multiply them: 0.8287 * 1.1952 ≈ 0.983.

Multiply by K_SOS: 0.983 * 0.068 ≈ 0.0669.

So, approximately 0.067 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm.

Thus, the answer is approximately 0.067.

But let me think again—if the formula is K proportional to sqrt(D), then K is proportional to sqrt(D), so K1 = K2 * sqrt(D1 / D2).

Wait, no, that's not correct. If K is proportional to sqrt(D), then K1/K2 = sqrt(D1/D2).

Which is equivalent to K1 = K2 * sqrt(D1/D2).

So, in this case, K_NH3 = K_SOS * sqrt(D_SOS / D_NH3 )

Which is,

= 0.068 * sqrt(0.115 / 0.168 ) ≈ 0.068 * 0.8287 ≈ 0.0562.

Wait, but I'm getting confused now.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of proportionality.

If K is proportional to sqrt(D), then K1 = K2 * sqrt(D1/D2).

So, in this case, K_NH3 = K_SOS * sqrt(D_SOS / D_NH3 )

Which is,

= 0.068 * sqrt(0.115 / 0.168 ) ≈ 0.068 * sqrt(0.6865 ) ≈ 0.068 * 0.8287 ≈ 0.0562.

Wait, that's what I thought earlier.

But then, another approach is to consider that K is proportional to sqrt(D), and R is the same.

So, K is proportional to sqrt(D) / R.

Which, since R is same, K is proportional to sqrt(D).

So, K_NH3 = K_SOS * sqrt(D_SOS / D_NH3 ) * sqrt(T_SOS / T_NH3 )

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the approaches.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that K is proportional to sqrt(D), and the ratio between K and sqrt(D) is constant.

Thus, K1 / sqrt(D1) = K2 / sqrt(D2).

So,

K_NH3 = K_SOS * sqrt(D_SOS / D_NH3 )

Which is,

= 0.068 * sqrt(0.115 / 0.168 ) ≈ 0.068 * 0.8287 ≈ 0.0562.

But then, another approach, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the Arrhenius equation, where K = ( activation energy / ( T * R ) ) * exp( - ( activation energy / R ) / T )

But without knowing activation energy, that's impossible.

So, perhaps the correct answer is 0.067 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of the Arrhenius equation.

Assuming that K is given by the Arrhenius equation:

K = A exp( -Ea / (R T) )

But without knowing Ea or A, it's impossible to find K.

Thus, perhaps I should consider that the problem is expecting to use the Arrhenius equation but without the activation energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the K is given at 70°F, and I need to find the K at 49°F, but with the assumption that the diffusivity is the same.

Wait, but without knowing the activation energy, that's impossible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the problem is expecting to use the formula K is proportional to sqrt(D), and the ratio is the same.

Thus, K_NH3 / K_SOS = sqrt(D_NH3 / D_SOS) * sqrt(T_SOS / T_NH3 )

Which is,

= sqrt(0.168 / 0.115 ) * sqrt(70 / 49 )

= 1.2048 * 1.1952 ≈ 1.4399

Thus, K_NH3 = 0.068 * 1.4399 ≈ 0.0979 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm.

But this approach assumes that the proportionality factor is the same, which may not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the K is given at 70°F, and we need to find the K at 49°F, but with the same diffusivity, which would mean that K is constant. But that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the K is given at 70°F, and we need to find the K at 49°F, but with the same diffusivity, which would mean that K is constant, which is not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as a linear relation.

Assuming that K is proportional to sqrt(D) and also proportional to 1/T.

Thus, K = (some constant) * sqrt(D) * 1/T.

Thus, K is proportional to sqrt(D)/T.

Thus, K1/K2 = (sqrt(D1)/T1) / (sqrt(D2)/T2) ) = sqrt(D1/D2) * (T2/T1 )

In this problem, D1 = 0.168, D2 = 0.115, T1 = 70, T2 =49.

Thus,

K_NH3/K_SOS = sqrt(0.168/0.115) * (49/70)

= sqrt(1.4516) * (0.7)

= 1.2048 * 0.7 ≈ 0.8433

Thus,

K_NH3 = 0.068 * 0.8433 ≈ 0.0576 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm.

But this approach is different.

Wait, now I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the K is given at 70°F, and I need to find the K at 49°F, but with the same diffusivity, which would mean that K is constant, which is not the case.

Thus, perhaps the correct approach is to not assume that the proportionality holds.

Thus, the correct approach is to use the Arrhenius equation, but without knowing Ea, which is impossible.

Thus, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the formula K is proportional to sqrt(D), and compute the ratio accordingly, leading to an answer of approximately 0.067 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm.

Thus, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.067 lbmol/hr·sqft·atm.

To find the coefficient for absorption (K) in wet air, we use the formula:

\[
K \propto \sqrt{D}
\]

where \(D\) is the diffusion coefficient. Since \(D\) is given at 70°F, and we need \(K\) at 49°F, we calculate the ratio of \(K\) values based on the temperature and \(D\).

Given:

- \(D_SOS = 0.115 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{mol}\)
- \(D_NH3 = 0.168 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{mol}\)
- \(T_{SOS} = 70^\circ \text{C}\)
- \(T_{NHH} = 49^\circ \text{C}\)

Compute the ratio:

\[
\frac{K_{NHH}}{K_{SOS}} = \sqrt{\frac{D_SOS}{D_NH3}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{T_{SOS}}{T_{NHH}}}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\frac{K_{NHH}}{K_{SOS}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.115}{0.168}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{70}{49}}
\]

Calculate each part:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{0.115}{0.168}} \approx 0.8287, \quad \sqrt{\frac{70}{49}} \approx 1.1952
\]

Multiply them together:

\[
\frac{K_{NHH}}{K_{SOS}} \approx 0.8287 \cdot 1.1952 \approx 0.983
\]

Thus:

\[
K_{NHH} = 0.068 \cdot 0.983 \approx 0.0669 \, \text{lbmol}/\text{hr}/\text{sqft}/\text{atm}
\]

So, the coefficient for absorption is approximately:
