Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. It's about projectile motion and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question has three parts: (a) finding the initial speed for an upward throw so that it remains in the air for 10 seconds. (b) finding the speed when it hits the ground. (c) the maximum height it reaches. The options are A through J, each giving different speeds and heights.

First, I remember that when an object is thrown straight up, it goes up to a certain height and then comes back down. The time it takes to go up and come back down is 10 seconds. So the total time of flight is 10 seconds.

I think the time to reach the maximum height is half of that, so 5 seconds. Because the time going up equals the time coming down if we ignore air resistance and other factors. So the time to reach the peak is 5 seconds.

Now, using the kinematic equation for vertical motion. I recall that the equation that relates time, initial velocity, and acceleration due to gravity is:

v = u + at

At the peak, the velocity (v) is zero because it's the highest point. So:

0 = u - g*t

Wait, no, wait. If I'm considering the upward direction as positive, then acceleration is -g because gravity acts downward. So the equation is:

0 = u - g*t

Wait, let me get this correct. The acceleration due to gravity is -9.8 m/s² (assuming standard gravity). So rearranging the equation:

u = g * t

So u = 9.8 m/s² * 5 s = 49 m/s approximately. But wait, the options are in feet, so I need to convert.

Wait, the unit here is in feet? Or meters? Because the options are in feet, so probably the problem is using feet as units. Let me double-check.

But wait, the given options are in ft, like option A is 150 ft/s. So I should probably use the exact value without approximating. So the exact calculation would be u = 32 ft/s² * t, since g is 32 ft/s² in imperial units. So, yes, u = 32 ft/s² * t.

So t is 5 seconds, so u = 32 *5=160 ft/s. So that would be the initial speed for part (a). So looking at the options, which one has 160 ft/s for part (a)?

Looking at options, option F is u=190, which is higher than 160. Option B is 160, so that's a candidate for part (a). Alternatively, option H's (a) is 140. Option G: 170.

Wait, no, let me check each option's (a) value. Wait, no, the options are A through J, each (a) is a certain value, and (b) and (c) are other values.

Wait, let's go back. For part (a), the problem says the ball remains in the air for 10 seconds. So, the time of flight is 10 seconds. So, as I thought earlier, the time to reach the peak (up) is 5 seconds.

In the equation, u is the initial velocity upward, and the acceleration is -32 ft/s² (since it's acting downward). So the equation is:

v = u + a*t

At the top, v is 0. So,

0 = u - 32 * t

t is 5 seconds, so:

u = 32 *5 = 160 ft/s.

So part (a) is 160 ft/s. Looking at the options, that's option B, which has (a) 160 ft/s. So option B's (a) is 160, which matches.

Now, part (b) asks for the speed when it hits the ground. Hmm. So the ball goes up, reaches the peak, comes back down, and hits the ground again. So the speed when it comes back down is equal in magnitude to the initial speed but in the opposite direction. So the speed is -160 ft/s. But wait, the options for part (b) are some negative numbers. Looking at the options, option B's (b) is -160 ft/s. So that's correct.

But wait, another approach: if the total time is 10 seconds, and the time to reach the peak is 5 seconds, then when it comes back down, it's 5 seconds after the peak. So the speed when it hits the ground is the same as the initial speed but in the opposite direction. So it's -160 ft/s.

So for part (b), it's -160 ft/s. Looking at the options, option B has (b) as -160 and part (c) is 400 ft.

Now, part (c) is the maximum height. So using the equation:

v² = u² + 2*a*s

At the top, v is zero. So:

0 = u² + 2*(-32)*s

=> 0 = u² -64 s

=> s = u² /64

u is 160 ft/s.

s = (160)^2 /64 = (25600)/64 = 400 ft.

So that's 400 ft, which matches option B's (c) of 400 ft. So option B has all three correct: (a) 160, (b) -160, (c) 400 ft.

Looking back at the options, option B is (a)160, (b) -160, (c)400. So the correct answer is B.

The problem involves calculating the initial speed, speed when the ball hits the ground, and maximum height for a ball thrown straight up with a total time of 10 seconds in the air. Using kinematic equations and considering the acceleration due to gravity as -32 ft/s²:

1. **Time to reach maximum height**: Half of the total time, so 5 seconds.
2. **Initial velocity (u)**: Using \( u = g \cdot t \), where \( g = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \) and \( t = 5 \, \text{s} \), we find \( u = 160 \, \text{ft/s} \).
3. **Speed when hitting the ground (b)**: The speed is the same as the initial speed but opposite in direction, so \( -160 \, \text{ft/s} \).
4. **Maximum height (c)**: Using \( s = \frac{u^2}{2g} \), we calculate \( s = \frac{160^2}{64} = 400 \, \text{ft} \).

Matching these results to the options:
- (a) 160 ft/s corresponds to option B.
- (b) -160 ft/s corresponds to option B.
- (c) 400 ft corresponds to option B.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.
