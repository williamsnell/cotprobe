Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about rising prices and what it causes. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking why rising prices are a problem. The options are A through J, each pointing to a different economic scenario.

First, I'll try to remember what each option means. I think it's related to economics, perhaps the concepts of inflation or the economy's response to rising prices.

Option A: People will stop spending money altogether. That doesn't sound right. Rising prices usually lead to inflation, which increases the cost of goods, making people spend less rather than stopping. So A is probably not the correct answer.

Option B: Businesses will have to pay more taxes. Taxes are usually based on income levels. If prices go up, people's incomes don't change, so taxes might go up too. But is this the main problem? I'm not sure yet.

Option C: It leads to a decrease in the national GDP. Wait, GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country. If prices rise, that means more money is needed to buy the same goods. So the same amount of money buys fewer goods, which would mean GDP is lower. So C could be correct if GDP is affected, but I'm not sure if that's the primary concern here.

Option D: The government will have to print more money. That sounds like an expansionary fiscal policy. But I don't think that's the immediate response to rising prices. In most cases, governments adjust money creation based on inflationary pressures, not necessarily printing more money unless inflation is too high and there's a lack of credit.

Option E: It causes a decrease in stock market values. If prices go up, people are holding onto more of their wealth. So stock prices might decline as people sell their investments. That makes sense, but does it directly cause a decrease? It's a possible outcome, but I think the question is looking for the economic issue, not just the market effect.

Option F: Money in household savings accounts can now buy fewer goods and services. That's about purchasing power. If prices rise, each unit of money buys less. So this would be a problem because people can't buy as much with the same money. That's one of the primary issues in inflation.

Option G: Household incomes generally do not rise with prices. Wait, household income is the money people have, but if prices go up, the purchasing power decreases. So household incomes don't rise in the same way. For example, if you make $100 a month, with prices going up, you can't buy $100 worth of goods anymore. So this is a key point about inflation.

Option H: The economy could run out of money. That's more of a liquidity trap scenario. If prices are going up, people might start saving more, leading to a lack of money for transactions. But this is a long-term issue and might not be the immediate concern when prices are just rising.

Option I: Borrowers have to repay loans with more dollars. That's about interest rates. If inflation is high, central banks might raise interest rates to control borrowing costs. So this is a possible response, but the question is about the problem, not the response.

Option J: It will lead to an increase in unemployment rates. Unemployment could rise if people lose their jobs or if others can't afford to buy their stuff. But is that the primary problem caused by rising prices? I'm not sure, but it's a possible side effect.

Now, thinking about the options again. The question is about rising prices causing a problem. The main issue related to prices is people not being able to buy the same goods with the same money, which is what option F is saying.

Option F: Money in household savings accounts can now buy fewer goods and services. That's the classic inflation effect. So when prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases. So F is probably correct.

Another angle: when prices rise, the economy is facing inflation. Inflation causes people to hold onto more assets, leading to lower stock prices. So E is about stock market values, which would decrease.

But the question is about rising prices as a problem. So the direct issue is about purchasing power, which is F. Alternatively, the problem is that household savings can't buy as much, which is F.

Wait, the options: F is about purchasing power, G is about income not rising with prices. Since household income is the money, if prices rise, their purchasing power decreases. So G is a correct statement, but the question is about the problem caused by rising prices.

Wait, the question is "rising prices are a problem because..." So the problem is the effect of rising prices.

Option F says that money can buy fewer things. That's a problem because it reduces the purchasing power of money.

Option G: Household incomes do not rise with prices. So when prices go up, the same amount of money buys less. So household income (money) is not keeping pace with price increases. So G is another point.

But the options are presented as the reasons, not the reasons.

So, which option is correct? Let me think about each.

The question is about why rising prices are a problem. So the answer would be the issue that is arising because of price increases.

Looking at G: "household incomes generally do not rise with prices." So when prices rise, money (household income) can't buy as much. That's a problem because people can't afford goods. So G is a correct statement, but the question is about the cause.

Option F is about purchasing power reducing, which is a problem.

So, which of these is the primary answer? The question is about the problem caused by rising prices.

So the correct answer is F or G.

Wait, the question is asking which of these is a reason why rising prices are a problem.

G says that household incomes don't rise with prices. So when prices rise, people's income (money) can't keep up, leading to lower purchasing power.

So G is a correct statement, but it's not the cause.

F is about purchasing power, which is a result of the problem. So the question is about the problem.

Wait, the options are about what is the problem. So the problem is the issue that is caused by rising prices.

So, the problem is that people can't buy as much as before, which is because prices are going up. So that's the problem.

So which option is that? Option F: Money can buy fewer goods and services.

Wait, but another angle: when prices go up, the economy is struggling to keep up with rising costs. So the problem is not about the purchasing power, but the inability to maintain current spending, leading to a decrease in GDP, etc.

But F is a correct statement, but the question is the cause.

Wait, the question is about what rising prices are a problem because of. So the issue is that the economy is facing inflation, causing people to hold onto more money, leading to lower purchasing power.

So, the problem is the decrease in purchasing power.

Option F says that money can buy fewer things. That's a problem because it reduces the purchasing power of money.

Therefore, the correct answer is F.

Rising prices are a problem because they reduce the purchasing power of money, leading to a decrease in the ability to buy goods and services. This is captured by the fact that money (household savings) can now buy fewer goods and services (Option F). 

**Answer: F**
