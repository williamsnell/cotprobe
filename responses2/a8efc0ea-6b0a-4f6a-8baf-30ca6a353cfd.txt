Question:

When it comes to STATISTICAL DECISION-MAKING, rejecting a false null is the goal of most researches. From your knowledge about TYPE I ERROR, which statement out of the following ones is about it?

Options:

A: null hypothesis is accepted, but it is false
B: the level of significance is set by the researcher at .01 or .05
C: graphically→ white is retention area and black is rejected area
D: probability of making a Beta Level error
E: null hypothesis is rejected, but it is true
F: null hypothesis is accepted, and it is true
G: null hypothesis is not rejected, but it is false
H: the level of significance is set by the researcher at .10 or .20
I: graphically→ black is retention area and white is rejected area

Okay, so I've got this question about statistical decision-making and Type I errors. Hmm, let me try to work through it.

The question is asking about Type I error and which statement is correct regarding it. Let me think about what I know. Type I error is when we reject a true null hypothesis. So that means we incorrectly conclude that there's a significant effect when in reality there isn't any. The goal of most researches is to minimize Type I errors, I think.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the null is accepted but it's false. Wait, if we accept it when it's false, that's a Type II error, right? Because Type II error is about failing to reject a false null. So A is about Type II. So A is incorrect.

Option B says the level of significance is set at .01 or .05. Yes, I remember that the level of significance, alpha, is set by the researcher. Common choices are .05, which is 5%. So B is correct.

Option C: Graphically, white is retention area and black is rejected. Wait, retention area is where we accept the null, right? Because that's the area where we don't reject. So Type I is rejecting a true null, which would be a black area (rejecting). So if the graph has white as retention (accept null) and black as rejected (Type I), that would be incorrect. So C is wrong.

Option D says probability of making a Beta error. Beta error is Type II, which is the probability of failing to reject a false null. So D is about Type II, which is about Type II error. So D is wrong.

Option E: Reject null but it's true. That's the opposite of Type I. That's Type II. So E is wrong.

Option F: Accept null and it's true. That's correct in terms of not rejecting a true null. But wait, is that correct? Because in hypothesis testing, we usually aim to avoid Type I errors. So accepting when it's true is correct, but that's not a Type I error. So F is correct in terms of not rejecting a true null, but the question is about Type I error. So F is about Type II again.

Option G: Not rejected but it's false. That's the opposite of Type I. So G is about Type II.

Option H: Level set at .10 or .20. No, usual common levels are .05. So H is wrong.

Option I: Black is retention, white is rejected. So that's opposite of C. So I is incorrect.

So the correct statement is B and F? Wait, let me check.

Wait the options are individual statements. So the question is, which statement is about Type I.

Looking back, the statements are about what Type I is. So:

A - Type II
B - Type I level
C - Graph coloring
D - Type II error
E - Type II
F - Type II (accept but true)
G - Type II
H - Type II
I - Type II.

So the only correct statement is B, because it's about the level of significance. Oh wait, and also F is correct because it's about accepting when it's true, but the question is about Type I, which is about rejecting true nulls. So F is about Type II.

Wait, but the question says, "which statement is about it?" So, which options are about Type I? The options are A to I.

Looking again, only B is correct about the level of significance. Because the level is set by the researcher, not about whether you accept or reject. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but the question says, "which statement out of the following ones is about it?" Type I is about rejecting a true null. So which option is about Type I? Let me see.

The options are statements, not options about the level of significance. So the correct statement is B: the level is set by researcher, which is about Type I setting.

Wait, but let me think again. The level of significance (alpha) is set by the researcher (option B). The other options are about Type I error, Type II, etc.

So the question is, which statement is about Type I error. So the correct statement is B. Because it's about the level, not the type of error.

Wait, but Type I is about rejecting when it's true. Type II is about accepting a false null.

So the correct answer is B.
</think>

The correct answer is B. 

**Explanation:** 

Type I error is the goal of most researches, as it involves rejecting a true null hypothesis. This corresponds to setting the level of significance (alpha), which is the probability of making a Type I error. 

- **Option A** refers to Type II error (accepting a false null hypothesis), so it's incorrect.
- **Option B** correctly states that the level of significance is set by the researcher.
- **Option C** incorrectly describes the graph's color scheme, which is about Type I error, so it's incorrect.
- **Option D** is about Type II error, so it's incorrect.
- **Option E** incorrectly states that rejection occurs when the null is true, which is Type II.
- **Option F** correctly describes accepting the null when it's true, but it's not about Type I.
- **Option G** and **Option I** are about Type II error, so they're incorrect.
- **Option H** incorrectly sets the level of significance, so it's incorrect.
- **Option J** is not provided, so it's irrelevant.

Thus, the only correct statement about Type I error is **B**.
