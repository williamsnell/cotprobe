Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the sum of -9 and -8 using a number line. Hmm, I'm a bit nervous because negative numbers can be a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out.

First, I remember that adding two negative numbers should result in a more negative number because you're moving further left on the number line. The number line helps visualize this. Let me draw a small number line in my mind, starting at zero. Negative numbers go to the left, right?

So, if I start at -9 on the number line, and I need to add another -8. Adding a negative is like moving left. How many steps should I take? Well, it's -8, so I need to move left 8 units from -9.

Let me count: if I start at -9, moving left one step is -10, then another step is -11, and so on. Wait, but that's only 8 steps. Let me think. Starting at -9, moving left 8 steps would bring me to -17, right? Because each step is -1, so 8 steps make it -8. So, -9 minus 8 is -17.

Wait, another way: -9 plus -8 is the same as -(9 + 8), which is -17. That makes sense. Yeah, so the sum is -17. Looking at the options, option G is -17. So I think the correct answer is G.

The sum of -9 and -8 is calculated by adding their absolute values and keeping the negative sign. Thus, -9 + (-8) equals -17.

Answer: G: −17
