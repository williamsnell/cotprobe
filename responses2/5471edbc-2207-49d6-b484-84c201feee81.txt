Okay, so I've got this question about Abelian groups of a certain order, and I'm a bit nervous because group theory can be a bit confusing. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking how many structurally distinct Abelian groups there are of order 72. The options are from A to J, with the answer being one of them. I remember that for Abelian groups, the classification is based on the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, which involves the decomposition into cyclic groups of prime power order. So first, I need to factor 72 into its prime components.

72 factors into 2^3 * 3^2. So, 72 = 2³ * 3². Now, to find the number of Abelian groups of this order, I think I need to look at the possible ways to decompose the exponents into cyclic groups.

Abelian groups of order 72 can be thought of as direct products of cyclic groups whose orders multiply to 72. So each group can be written as a direct product of cyclic groups where the orders are powers of 2 and 3, and their exponents add up to the exponents in the prime factorization.

Wait, let me break it down. The exponents for 2 are 3, and for 3 are 2. The number of ways to express each prime power as a product of cyclic groups is determined by the number of integer partitions of the exponents.

So for each prime p^k, the number of ways to write it as a product of cyclic groups is the number of integer partitions of k. For example, for 2³, the exponent is 3, which can be partitioned in several ways.

Let me recall that the number of Abelian groups of order p^k is equal to the number of partitions of k. For each prime power, we find the number of additive partitions of the exponent. So for 2^3, the partitions of 3 are:

- 3
- 2 + 1
- 1 + 1 + 1

So that's three partitions. For 3² (which is 9), the exponent is 2, so the partitions of 2 are:

- 2
- 1 + 1

That's two partitions.

So each prime contributes a certain number of possibilities. The total number of Abelian groups is the product of the number of possibilities for each prime. Wait, but wait, is that the case? So for 72, we have prime factors 2^3 and 3^2. So the number of Abelian groups is (number of ways for 2^3) multiplied by (number of ways for 3^2).

So for 2³, the number of ways is 3 (as above), and for 3², it's 2. So total is 3 * 2 = 6.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I might be missing something. Let me double-check the formula. Oh right, the general formula is that for each prime power p^k, the number of Abelian groups of order p^k is equal to the number of integer partitions of k. So for 2^3, partitions of 3 are 3, so 3 ways; for 3^2, partitions of 2 are 2, so 2 ways. Multiplying gives 3*2=6. So the answer should be 6. Looking at the options, option C is 6, so that's the answer.

To determine the number of structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72, we factorize 72 into its prime components: \(72 = 2^3 \times 3^2\). The number of Abelian groups of order \(p^k\) is given by the number of integer partitions of \(k\). For \(2^3\), the partitions of 3 are:

- 3
- 2 + 1
- 1 + 1 + 1

This gives 3 possibilities. For \(3^2\), the partitions of 2 are:

- 2
- 1 + 1

This gives 2 possibilities. Multiplying these together, \(3 \times 2 = 6\). Therefore, the number of structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72 is 6.

Answer: C
