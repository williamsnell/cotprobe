Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to use the van der Waals equation to find the pressure of nitrogen under specific conditions. Let me try to break this down step by step because I'm a bit rusty on the van der Waals equation.

Okay, the problem says nitrogen is heated to 500 K at a constant volume of 1.000 m³. The gas enters at 300 K and 100 atm. The mass of the gas is 92.4 kg. The van der Waals constants for nitrogen are a=1.39 dm^6·atm/mol² and b=0.0391 dm³/mol. Hmm, I need to find the pressure at 500 K.

Wait, wait. Wait, the van der Waals equation is (P + a(n/V)^2)(V/n - b) = RT. So I think I need to plug in all these values into the equation. But first, I should make sure all the units are consistent.

Let me list the given data again:

- Volume, V = 1.000 m³. Oh wait, I remember that 1 m³ is 1000 liters, but wait, no: 1 m³ is 1000 liters? No, wait, 1 m³ equals 1000 liters because 1 liter is 0.001 m³. Hmm, but wait, wait. The van der Waals constants are given in dm³, right? Because I think the units here are in dm³ for b and a. So, let me make sure I convert all the units properly.

First, let me convert the volume from m³ to dm³. Since 1 m³ is 1000 dm³ (because 1 m = 10 dm, so 1 m³ = (10 dm)^3 = 1000 dm³). So the volume V is 1.000 m³ = 1000 dm³.

Next, the mass of the gas is 92.4 kg. Oh, wait, kg to grams? Because the van der Waals equation uses grams? Wait no, I think the equation just requires the mass in kilograms if we're using the right units. But wait, maybe not. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the molar mass first to convert the mass into moles.

Nitrogen has a molar mass of about 28 g/mol. So, 92.4 kg is 92400 grams. So, moles = mass / molar mass. So 92400 g / 28 g/mol = 3300 mol. Okay, so n is 3300 moles.

Now, the temperature is 500 K. The gas constant R is 0.0821 dm³·atm/(mol·K) when using a=dm^6·atm/mol² and b=dm³/mol. Wait, wait! van der Waals equation uses R in terms of these units. Let me confirm R's value: R ≈ 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but since we're using dm³, perhaps R is 0.0821 dm³·atm/(mol·K). Right, because 1 L is 1 dm³. So R is 0.0821 dm³·atm/(mol·K).

So, the van der Waals equation is (P + a(n/V)^2)(V/n - b) = RT.

Wait, but I need to calculate each part step by step.

Let me compute each part:

First, compute n/V. n is 3300 mol, V is 1000 dm³. So, n/V is 3300/1000 = 3.3 mol/dm³. So (n/V)=3.3.

n/V squared is (3.3)^2 = 10.89.

So a(n/V)^2 = 1.39 dm^6·atm/mol² * 10.89 = Let's calculate that. 1.39 * 10.89 ≈ 15. So approximately 15.0 (wait, 1.39 * 10 is 13.9, 1.39 *0.89 is about 1.24, total about 15.13 atm·dm³/mol.

So the first term in the equation is P + 15.13 atm·dm³/mol.

The second part: (V/n - b). V is 1000 dm³, n is 3300, so V/n is 1000 / 3300 ≈ 0.3030 dm³/mol. Then subtracting b, which is 0.0391 dm³/mol: 0.3030 - 0.0391 = 0.2639 dm³/mol.

So the second factor is 0.2639 dm³/mol.

Putting it all together: (P + 15.13)(0.2639) = R*T. R is 0.0821 dm³·atm/(mol·K), T is 500 K. So RT = 0.0821 * 500 = 41.05 dm³·atm/mol.

Wait, but units: The left side is (P + 15.13) multiplied by 0.2639. So (P + 15.13) has units of (atm·dm³/mol), because 15.13 is in units of (dm³/mol·atm²) * (mol²/ (dm^6·atm)) ? Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of units.

Wait, the van der Waals equation: (P + a(n/V)^2) multiplied by (V/n - b) equals RT. So units for P is atm, V/n is (dm³)/(mol), so the term (V/n) has units of dm³/mol. Then a(n/V)^2 has units of (dm^6·atm/mol²) * (mol²/(dm^6)) )? Let me see: a is in dm^6·atm/mol². n/V is mol/dm³, so (n/V)^2 is mol²/dm^6. So a*(n/V)^2 is (dm^6·atm/mol²) * (mol²/dm^6) ) → atm. So that's correct.

So, the left side is (P + a term) * (V/n - b) → (atm + atm) * (dm³/mol) → (atm dm³/mol) → which should equal RT, which has units of (dm³·atm)/(mol) ). Wait, but RT has units (dm³·atm)/(mol) * K? Wait no, R is in dm³·atm/(mol·K), so RT is (dm³·atm/(mol·K)) * K → dm³·atm/mol. So the left side units are (atm dm³/mol) → which matches right side. So the equation is dimensionally consistent.

So, for calculation: (P + 15.13) * 0.2639 = 41.05.

So, solving for (P + 15.13) = 41.05 / 0.2639 ≈ 155.3 atm.

Wait, 41.05 / 0.2639 ≈ let me compute that.

41.05 / 0.2639 ≈ Let's approximate. 0.2639 is about 0.264. 41.05 / 0.264 ≈ Let's compute:

0.264 * 155 = 41.04. Because 0.264 *150 = 39.6, 0.264*5=1.32 → 39.6+1.32=40.92. So 155 × 0.264 = 40.92. Which is 41.05-40.92=0.13. So 0.13 / 0.264 ≈ 0.49. So 155.49 → approx 155.5 atm.

So, P + 15.13 ≈ 155.5 → P ≈ 155.5 -15.13 = 140.37 atm.

Wait, that's around 140 atm. Looking at the options, option F is 140 atm, option E is 220, etc. So the answer would be option F, 140 atm.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation. Because sometimes, when I'm rushing, I might have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate (V/n - b):

V is 1000 dm³, n is 3300. So V/n = 1000 / 3300 ≈ 0.3030 dm³/mol. Subtracting b (0.0391) gives 0.3030 -0.0391=0.2639 dm³/mol. That's correct.

Next, (n/V)^2: 3.3^2=10.89. Multiply by a (1.39): 10.89 * 1.39 = Let me compute that. 10 *1.39=13.9, 0.89 *1.39= approx 1.2371. So total 15.1371.

So a(n/V)^2 is approximately 15.137 atm·dm³/mol.

So, the left-hand side of the equation is (P + 15.137)(0.2639) = RT.

RT is 0.0821 *500 = 41.05 dm³·atm/mol.

So P + 15.137 = 41.05 /0.2639 → 41.05 / 0.2639.

Let me compute 41.05 ÷ 0.2639.

Well, 0.2639 * 155 = 0.2639*150=39.585; 0.2639*5=1.3195 → 40.9045. Which is just a bit less than 41.05.

The difference is 41.05 - 40.9045 = 0.1455.

So how much more than 155? 0.1455 /0.2639 ≈ 0.551.

So 155 + 0.551 ≈ 155.551.

So P + 15.137 ≈ 155.551 → P ≈ 155.55 -15.137 = 140.41 atm.

Wait, so about 140.4 atm. So the closest option is F: 140 atm.

But wait, wait another thing. The van der Waals equation is (P + a(n/V)^2)(V/n - b) = RT.

Wait, but does this equation give the correct value? Because sometimes, when the gas is at a higher temperature, the correction for volume might be larger. Wait, but I think I did all correct steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that the van der Waals equation is applicable, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (n/V)^2.

Wait, n is 3300, V is 1000 dm³. So n/V is 3.3 mol/dm³. So (n/V)^2 is (3.3)^2=10.89. Correct.

a is 1.39, so 1.39*10.89= 15.137. Correct.

So, P + 15.137 = 41.05 /0.2639 ≈155.55.

Wait, 41.05 /0.2639 ≈ let me do this precisely.

Compute 0.2639 × 155 = 0.2639 *150 = 39.585; 0.2639 *5=1.3195 → total 40.9045. The actual value is 41.05. So 41.05 -40.9045=0.1455.

So 0.1455 / 0.2639 = 0.551. So 155 + 0.551 ≈ 155.551.

So P is 155.551 - 15.137 = 140.414 atm. So approximately 140 atm.

Looking back, the options are:

A:200

B:100

C:80

D:180

E:220

F:140 → option F.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in R. Let me double-check.

R is 0.0821 dm³·atm/(mol·K) when using a and b in dm³ and mol. So that's correct.

Hmm, but wait, sometimes van der Waals equations are represented in terms of R as 0.0821 (L·atm)/(mol·K), but in this case, we’re using dm³ as a unit, which is okay because 1 L=1 dm³. So R is correct.

So, the answer should be F: 140 atm.

To determine the pressure of nitrogen at 500 K using the van der Waals equation, we start by identifying the given parameters:

- **Volume**: \( V = 1.000 \, \mathrm{m^3} = 1000 \, \mathrm{dm^3} \)
- **Mass of gas**: \( m = 92.4 \, \mathrm{kg} = 92400 \, \mathrm{g} \)
- **Molar mass of nitrogen (N₂)**: \( M = 28 \, \mathrm{g/mol} \)
- **Moles of gas**: \( n = \frac{92400}{28} = 3300 \, \mathrm{mol} \)
- **Temperature**: \( T = 500 \, \mathrm{K} \)
- **Gas constant**: \( R = 0.0821 \, \mathrm{dm^3 \cdot atm/(mol \cdot K)} \)
- **Van der Waals constants**: \( a = 1.39 \, \mathrm{dm^6 \cdot atm/mol^2}, \, b = 0.0391 \, \mathrm{dm^3/mol} \)

### Step 1: Calculate \( n/V \)
\[
n/V = \frac{3300}{1000} = 3.3 \, \mathrm{mol/dm^3}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( (n/V)^2 \)
\[
(n/V)^2 = 3.3^2 = 10.89
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( a(n/V)^2 \)
\[
a(n/V)^2 = 1.39 \times 10.89 = 15.137 \, \mathrm{atm \cdot dm^3/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( (V/n - b) \)
\[
V/n = \frac{1000}{3300} \approx 0.3030 \, \mathrm{dm^3/mol}
\]
\[
V/n - b = 0.3030 - 0.0391 = 0.2639 \, \mathrm{dm^3/mol}
\]

### Step 5: Apply the van der Waals equation
The van der Waals equation is:
\[
(P + a(n/V)^2)(V/n - b) = RT
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
(P + 15.137)(0.2639) = 0.0821 \times 500 = 41.05
\]
Solve for \( P + 15.137 \):
\[
P + 15.137 = \frac{41.05}{0.2639} \approx 155.55
\]
Finally, solve for \( P \):
\[
P = 155.55 - 15.137 = 140.41 \, \mathrm{atm}
\]

### Step 6: Match the result to the options
The calculated pressure is approximately \( 140 \, \mathrm{atm} \), which corresponds to **Option F**.
