Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me read through it again. 

So, there's a chamber with 5 lbm of an ideal gas. Initially, the temperature is 100°F. Then, the gas undergoes a reversible isobaric process, which means it's a constant pressure process. And during this process, it absorbs 500 Btu of heat. I need to find the final temperature, and the options are from 200°F up to 500°F.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but I'll try to remember what I know. For a constant pressure process, I think the formula relates heat transfer, pressure, and the change in temperature. Oh right, the first law of thermodynamics says that the change in internal energy is equal to the heat added minus the work done. But since it's isobaric, the work done is pressure times change in volume.

Wait, the formula for work in a constant pressure process is PΔV, which is also equal to mRTΔT, I think. Because for an ideal gas, PV = mRT, so if P is constant, V = (mRT)/P. So the change in volume is (mRΔT)/P. So work done would be P * (mRΔT)/P) = mRΔT. So work done W = m R (T_final - T_initial). 

Wait, the first law is ΔU = Q - W. So Q is the heat added, which is 500 Btu, and W is the work done by the system. Since the process is isobaric, the work is positive (since the system is expanding, right? So work done by the gas is positive).

But wait, I'm trying to find the change in internal energy. The change in internal energy for an ideal gas is (5/2) m R ΔT. Because for monatomic gases, it's 3/2 R, diatomic perhaps 5/2 R, maybe it's m times (5/2 R) times (T2 - T1).

Wait, let me think again. The change in internal energy (ΔU) for an ideal gas is m times (Cv) times ΔT. But since it's isobaric, perhaps I should use the specific heat at constant pressure (Cp) instead of Cv.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me restate: The first law is ΔU = Q - W. In an isobaric process, Q is given as 500 Btu, and W is the work done by the gas.

But wait, for an ideal gas undergoing a constant pressure process, the heat transfer Q is equal to the change in enthalpy, which is m Cp ΔT. Or wait, no, enthalpy change is Q_p = m Cp ΔT. So since Q is given as heat added, that's correct.

Alternatively, the work done W is m R T (ΔT / P ), but since P is constant, that's m R ΔT. So W = m R (T2 - T1). 

So, putting it together. 

ΔU = Q - W 

ΔU = 500 Btu - [m R (T2 - T1)]

But ΔU for an ideal gas is (5/2) m R (T2 - T1). Wait, wait, I think I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think again about the internal energy. For an ideal gas, the internal energy only depends on temperature, and for an ideal gas, ΔU = n Cv ΔT. But when using R (universal gas constant), since R = Cv + Cp, then for a monatomic gas, Cv is (3/2) R, so Cv = (3/2) R. So ΔU = m Cv ΔT = m (3/2 R) ΔT.

Wait, but in some references, the specific heat at constant pressure Cp is (5/2) R for a monatomic gas, and Cv is (3/2) R. So yes, for an ideal gas, ΔU = m Cv ΔT = m (3/2 R) ΔT.

So putting it all together: 

m (3/2 R) (T2 - T1) = Q - m R (T2 - T1)

Wait, because W is m R (T2 - T1) as I thought earlier. So,

Left side: ΔU = m*(3/2 R)*(T2-T1)

Right side: Q - W = 500 Btu - m R (T2-T1)

So,

m*(3/2 R)*(T2-T1) + m R (T2-T1) = 500

Let me compute that. Let's factor out m R (T2 - T1):

m R (3/2 + 1) (T2 - T1) = 500

Wait, 3/2 + 1 is 5/2. So:

m R (5/2) (T2 - T1) = 500 Btu

But wait, the units here are a bit tricky because R is in Btu/(lbm·°R), and T is in °R, so the units should work out.

Wait, but R is given as 0.0641 Btu/(lbm·°R). So,

m R (5/2) (T2 - T1) = 500 Btu

But let me plug in the numbers. The mass m is 5 lbm.

So,

5 * 0.0641 * 5/2 * (T2 - 100) = 500

Compute the left side:

5 * 0.0641 is about 0.3205. Multiply by 5/2: 0.3205 * 2.5 = 0.80125.

So,

0.80125 (T2 - 100) = 500

Then, (T2 - 100) = 500 / 0.80125 ≈ 624.25

So T2 ≈ 100 + 624.25 ≈ 724.25 °R.

Wait, but wait, 724°F? Because 724°F is way higher than the options given. The options are up to 500°F. So that can't be right.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the signs or somewhere?

Wait, let me go back. Because I think I might have made a mistake in the setup.

Ah, wait! In the process, the gas is expanding during the isobaric process. So the work done by the gas is positive, and heat is added, which increases its internal energy. But wait, the formula I used earlier may have the sign wrong.

Wait, in the equation, ΔU = Q - W. So if the gas is expanding and doing work on the surroundings, W is positive. But in this case, Q is positive because heat is added by the system.

So, the system (gas) has ΔU = Q - W. So, for the system, W is work done by the system, so W is positive.

Wait, but in our equation, when I wrote ΔU = Q - W, that's correct because for a closed system, Q is heat added to the system, W is work done by the system. So ΔU = Q + (work done on the system). Wait, no, no. The first law is ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system.

So, the equation I had earlier was correct.

But wait the calculation I did gives me a temperature of 724°F, which is way above the options, so that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me reevaluate.

Let me redo the calculation step by step.

Given:

m = 5 lbm

Q = 500 Btu

R = 0.0641 Btu/(lbm·°R)

k = 1.147 (which is probably the ratio of specific heats, Cp/Cv, but I'm not sure if that's needed here. Wait, but for an ideal gas, Cp is used for the heat capacity at constant pressure. However, in this problem, since it's isobaric, perhaps I don't need to use Cp directly. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: In an isobaric process, the heat transfer is Q = m C_p (T2 - T1). But wait, I'm not sure about the value of C_p.

Wait, here's another way: For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy ΔH = m Cp (T2 - T1). Since Q is the heat added at constant pressure, Q = ΔH. So, Q = m Cp (T2 - T1).

But wait, I don't have the value of Cp. So I need to find Cp in terms of R.

For an ideal gas, Cp = Cv + R. And for an ideal gas, Cv = (3/2) R for a monatomic gas, but wait, is this the case here? Wait, the problem doesn't specify the type of gas, so I can't assume that. Hmm, that complicates things because without knowing if it's monoatomic, diatomic, etc., I can't find Cp.

Wait, but maybe the problem expects me to use Cp as 1.0029 Btu/(lbm·°R) for air, which is roughly what some textbooks use. Or maybe I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll proceed with that assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's specific heat at constant pressure is given, but in the question, it's R. Wait, the problem statement says: 'k = 1.147', which I think is Cp/Cv. Let me think: Cp/Cv is gamma for an ideal gas (gamma = Cp/Cv = 1 + (2/n) for diatomic gases, etc.), but without knowing the gas, it's hard to say. So maybe I should proceed with the given data.

Wait, the problem states that the properties of the gas are known, so perhaps the specific heat Cp is given elsewhere, but in the problem statement, it's not provided. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think about the equation again.

Another way: The change in internal energy is ΔU = (5/2) m R (T2 - T1). The heat Q is 500 Btu, which equals the work done plus the change in internal energy. Wait, no, the equation is Q = ΔU + W. Wait, because Q is added to the system, which increases its internal energy and does work.

Wait, but in a constant pressure process, work done by the system is PΔV. So, W = m R T2 - m R T1 = m R (T2 - T1). So the equation is Q = ΔU + W.

Wait, let's write that: Q = (ΔU) + W.

ΔU = (5/2) m R (T2 - T1)

W = m R (T2 - T1)

So,

500 = (5/2) m R (T2-T1) + m R (T2 - T1)

Factor m R (T2-T1):

500 = m R (5/2 + 1) (T2-T1)

500 = m R (7/2) (T2-T1)

Wait, that's different from before. Earlier I thought I had (5/2 + 1) being 5/2, but 5/2 +1 is 7/2. So that's a mistake there.

Wait, 5/2 is 2.5, so 2.5 +1 is 3.5, which is 7/2. So wait, the equation is 500 = m R (7/2) (T2 - T1)

Wait, that's more accurate now. Let me plug in the numbers.

m is 5 lbm.

R is 0.0641.

(T2 - T1) is the change in temperature in °R.

So,

500 = 5 * 0.0641 * (7/2) * (T2 - 100)

Compute 5 * 0.0641 = 0.3205.

Multiply by 7/2: 0.3205 * 3.5 = approx 1.12175.

So,

500 = 1.12175 * (T2 - 100)

So, (T2 - 100) = 500 / 1.12175 ≈ 446.05

So T2 ≈ 100 + 446.05 = 546.05°F.

Hmm, that's still way higher than the options given (up to 500°F). So this can't be right. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the units are a problem. Because 500 Btu is a lot of energy. Let me check the units again. Because the work done is m R (T2-T1) but R is in Btu/(lbm·°R), and T is in °R, so Btu (which is a form of energy) is correct.

Wait, the calculation ends up with T2 of about 546°F, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Another approach: The formula for the change in internal energy is ΔU = m Cv (T2 - T1). And for an isobaric process, Q = ΔH - W?

Wait, no, I think another way. For a constant pressure process, the heat Q is equal to the change in enthalpy, which is m Cp (T2 - T1). So equation is Q = m Cp (T2 - T1).

But without knowing Cp, that's a problem. So perhaps I need to find Cp in terms of R and another parameter.

Alternatively, using the relation that for an ideal gas, Cp = (gamma) Cv, where gamma is the heat capacity ratio (gamma = Cp/Cv). But without knowing gamma, that's a dead end.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given R correctly. Let me re-examine the equation.

Wait, if the gas is ideal, the work done W = m R (T2 - T1) (since P is constant, yes), and the heat Q is m Cp (T2 - T1). So, using the first law: Q = ΔU + W.

Wait, but ΔU is m Cv (T2-T1). So,

Q = m Cv (T2-T1) + m Cp (T2-T1)

= m [ Cv + Cp ] (T2 - T1 )

But Cv + Cp = gamma Cv, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Cv + Cp = Cp + Cv = (gamma) Cv + Cv = Cv (gamma + 1) = Cv (1 + gamma) = (gamma + 1) Cv. But since gamma = Cp/Cv, so gamma + 1 = (Cv + Cp)/Cv = (gamma + 1) Cv.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express Cv as (R)/(gamma -1). Wait, no, for monoatomic ideal gases, Cv = (3/2) R. But for diatomic, Cv is (5/2) R, and so on.

But without knowing the type of gas, it's impossible to find the exact value of Cp. So perhaps the problem assumes that Cp is given as (5/2) R, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use the fact that in a constant pressure process, Cp is used, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, let me try to think of another way. Maybe the problem gives Cp/Cv as k=1.147. Oh, wait, that's given in the problem. So the problem states that k=1.147, which is Cp/Cv. So maybe I should use that.

So, Cp = k * Cv. But wait, wait, no, wait, that's probably not correct. Because for a gas, k = Cp/Cv. So, if Cp = k * Cv, that can't be right. Wait, no, perhaps the problem states that the ratio of Cp to Cv is given as k, so Cp = k Cv.

Wait, no, the problem says k=1.147. So, perhaps the problem expects me to use k as the ratio of Cp to Cv, but I'm not sure. Let's think again.

Wait, another angle: in an isobaric process, the work done is W = m R (T2 - T1). And the heat Q is equal to the change in enthalpy, which is m Cp (T2 - T1). So,

Q = m Cp (T2 - T1)

But Q is 500 Btu, m is 5 lbm, R is 0.0641.

So,

500 = 5 * Cp (T2 - 100)

But I don't know Cp. But I know that for some gases, Cp/Cv = k. Let's see.

Hmm, but without knowing the gas, I can't find Cp. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem provides Cp as 1.147 * Cv, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of Cp as given as (k for the gas), but again, without that info, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law for the initial state. Since the initial temperature is given, and the initial state is a certain pressure. But I don't have the pressure, so that approach might not help.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula Q = m Cp (T2 - T1), but without Cp, I can't proceed. So perhaps I'm making a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, but what if I use the formula for an ideal gas undergoing a constant pressure process. The heat Q is equal to the change in enthalpy, H = m Cp T.

So,

Q = H = m Cp (T2 - T1) → no, that's wrong. The enthalpy at state 2 is H2 = m Cp T2, and at state 1 is H1 = m Cp T1. So the change in enthalpy is H2 - H1 = m Cp (T2 - T1). So, the heat Q is equal to H2 - H1, which would be correct.

So,

500 = 5 Cp (T2 - 100)

But without knowing Cp, I can't find T2. So perhaps I'm supposed to use Cp = (gamma) * Cv, but without gamma, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that for an ideal gas, Cp = (gamma) Cv, but without knowing gamma, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the problem assumes that the process is isochoric, but that's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the internal energy approach.

Wait, another thought: The change in internal energy is equal to the heat added minus the work done. So,

ΔU = Q - W

ΔU = 500 - (m R (T2 - T1))

But ΔU for an ideal gas is m Cv (T2 - T1). So,

m Cv (T2 - T1) = 500 - m R (T2 - T1)

Factor m (T2 - T1):

m (T2 - T1) (Cv + R) = 500

But Cv + R = Cp. So,

m (T2 - T1) Cp = 500

But without knowing Cp, I can't compute T2.

Wait, but I also know that Cp/Cv = k = 1.147. So, Cv = Cp / k.

So, substitution:

m (T2 - T1) Cp = 500

But Cv = Cp / k, so,

m (T2 - T1) Cp = 500

And,

Delta U = m Cv (T2 - T1) = m (Cp / k) (T2 - T1) = (m Cp (T2 - T1)) ) /k = 500.

So, (m Cp (T2 - T1)) ) /k = 500

So,

m Cp (T2 - T1) ) = 500 k

But,

m Cp (T2 - T1) ) = 500 k

But from above, m Cp (T2 - T1) ) = 500 k

Wait, but the equation is m Cp (T2 - T1) ) = 500 k

But from the earlier equation, m (T2 - T1) Cp = 500.

Which is the same as m Cp (T2 - T1) ) = 500.

So, m Cp (T2 - T1) ) = 500.

Which implies that:

500 = 500 k → which would only be possible if k=1, which isn't the case.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I've made a mistake in using the equations.

Wait, going back to the equation I derived:

m (T2 - T1) Cp = 500

But I also know that:

m Cp (T2 - T1) ) = 500 k

So,

m Cp (T2 - T1) ) = 500 k

Which implies that,

m Cp (T2 - T1) ) = 500 k = 500 * 1.147 ≈ 573.5

But from the earlier equation, m Cp (T2 - T1) ) = 500.

Which would only be consistent if 500 = 573.5, which isn't true. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula Q = m Cp (T2 - T1), and the problem gives the Cp as 1.0029 Btu/(lbm·°R), which is a standard value.

But wait, the problem states that k = Cp/Cv = 1.147. So, if I can find Cv, then Cp = k Cv. But since I don't have the gas, I can't find Cv. So perhaps the problem expects me to make an assumption, perhaps that the gas is diatomic or something else where Cp/Cv is a known value. But without that, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to give Cp as 1.0029, but then that would make k = Cp/Cv = (1.0029)/(Cv) = 1.147 → Cv=1.0029/1.147 ≈ 0.873 Btu/(lbm·°R). Then, Cp = 1.0029 Btu/(lbm·°R), but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem provided k as Cp/Cv, but without knowing what gas it is, I can't proceed. So, perhaps the problem expects me to proceed with an incorrect assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem gives the Cp as (k) * Cv, which is 1.147 * Cv. But without knowing Cv, I can't compute Cp.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for the change in internal energy as ΔU = m (gamma - 1) R T, but that's not correct.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the process in terms of enthalpy. Since it's constant pressure, the enthalpy change is Q. So, ΔH = m Cp (T2 - T1) = 500 Btu.

But I also know that Cp = k Cv. So,

ΔH = m (k Cv) (T2 - T1) = 500

But from the internal energy equation, ΔU = m Cv (T2 - T1) = m (T2 - T1) Cv.

But without knowing Cv, I can't proceed. So, perhaps the problem expects me to make an assumption about Cv, but I'm not aware of it.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended for me to use the formula Q = m Cp (T2 - T1), but without knowing Cp, I can't proceed. So, perhaps the problem expects me to make an assumption about the gas.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the gas is diatomic, so Cv = (5/2) R. So, for diatomic gases, Cv = (5/2) R = 0.262 * 0.0641 ≈ 0.0168 Btu/(lbm·°R).

Wait, no, wait, R is 0.0641 Btu/(lbm·°R). So, (5/2) R = (2.5)(0.0641) ≈ 0.16 Btu/(lbm·°R). So, Cv = 0.16.

Then, Cp = k * Cv = 1.147 * 0.16 ≈ 0.1835 Btu/(lbm·°R).

So, then,

ΔH = m Cp (T2 - T1) = 5 * 0.1835 * (T2 - 100)

= 0.9175 * (T2 - 100)

Set this equal to 500:

0.9175 (T2 - 100) = 500

T2 - 100 = 500 / 0.9175 ≈ 545.3

T2 = 100 + 545.3 ≈ 645.3°F

But that's way above the options given. So, perhaps the assumption about Cv is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use Cp = R, which would be incorrect for diatomic gases. But that might be the intended approach.

If Cp = R = 0.0641 Btu/(lbm·°R), then,

ΔH = m Cp (T2 - T1) =5 * 0.0641 (T2 - 100)=0.3205 (T2 - 100) = 500

So,

T2 -100 =500 /0.3205≈1560.7

T2= 1660.7°F, which is way above any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to give Cp as a different value, but without that, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem made a mistake and the correct answer should be 500°F, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula Q = m Cp (T2 - T1), and the problem provides k=1.147, but without knowing Cv, I can't compute Cp. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula Q = m (gamma - 1) R T, but that's not correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Since the process is isobaric, the heat Q is equal to the change in enthalpy, which is m Cp (T2 - T1).

But without knowing Cp, I can't proceed. So, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the gas is diatomic, so Cp = 1.0029 Btu/(lbm·°R). Then,

500 =5 * 1.0029 * (T2 -100)

500 =5.0145 * (T2 -100)

(T2 -100)=500/5.0145≈99.7

T2≈100+99.7=199.7°F. Which is way below the options given.

Hmm, this isn't working. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to neglect the change in Cp, but that's not a valid assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, let's re-express the equation.

In an isobaric process, Q = ΔH = m Cp (T2 - T1).

So,

500 =5 Cp (T2 - 100)

But without Cp, I can't solve for T2.

Wait, but the problem provides k=1.147, which is Cp/Cv. So, perhaps I can express Cv in terms of Cp, and then use that.

Cv = Cp / k.

So,

500 =5 Cp (T2 -100)

But, since Cv = Cp/k, and Cp = k Cv, but I don't know Cv.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express Cp in terms of Cv.

Wait, perhaps I can express Cv as (R)/(gamma -1), but without knowing gamma, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use Cp = R, but that's incorrect. Because for diatomic gases, Cp is higher than R.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me see the options again.

Options: 200, 300, 400, 500, 600°F.

The correct answer according to the setup I made earlier (where I used Cp = k Cv, and then m Cp (T2 - T1) = 500) gave T2≈546°F, which isn't an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula Q = m Cp (T2 - T1), but perhaps I should use Cp = (gamma) Cv, where gamma is Cp/Cv =1.147. But without knowing gamma, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use Cp = R, but that's incorrect for diatomic gases.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use Cp = (gamma) Cv, but I can't find gamma.

Hmm, I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. Let me try to re-express the equation from scratch.

In an isobaric process, the heat Q is equal to the change in enthalpy, which is Q = ΔH = m Cp (T2 - T1).

So,

500 = m Cp (T2 - 100)

But without Cp, I can't solve for T2. But the problem gives k=1.147, which is Cp/Cv. So,

Cp =k Cv.

But I don't know Cv. Hmm.

Wait, but for an ideal gas, Cv = (R)/(gamma -1). But without gamma, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use Cp = R, which is incorrect for diatomic gases, but perhaps it's intended.

If I proceed with Cp = R = 0.0641 Btu/(lbm·°R), then,

500 =5 * 0.0641 * (T2 - 100)

500 =0.3205 * (T2 - 100)

T2 -100=500 /0.3205≈1560.7

T2≈1660.7°F, which is way higher than any options. So that's not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let's think about the formula.

Another approach: The formula for the change in internal energy for an ideal gas is ΔU = n Cv ΔT.

For the heat transfer in an isobaric process, Q = ΔH = n Cp ΔT.

So, from the first law,

ΔU = Q - W → no, wait, the first law is ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system.

But for an isobaric process, W = n R T.

So, ΔU = Q - W → but ΔU = n Cv ΔT.

So,

n Cv ΔT = Q - n R T.

But, Q is given as 500 Btu.

But without knowing Cv or T, it's challenging.

Wait, but without knowing Cv, I can't proceed.

I'm stuck here. Perhaps I should look for help or move on to another problem.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula that for an ideal gas, (T2 - T1) = Q/(n Cp).

So,

(T2 -100) = 500/(5 Cp) = 100/(Cp)

So,

T2 = 100 + 100/(Cp)

But without Cp, I can't proceed.

Wait, but the problem provides k = Cp/Cv =1.147.

So,

Cp = k Cv.

We can express Cv in terms of Cp.

So,

Cv = Cp /k.

But,

Since,

ΔU = n Cv ΔT = n (Cp/k) ΔT.

But,

ΔU = Q - W → no, wait, the first law is ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system.

So,

n (Cp/k) ΔT = Q - n R ΔT.

Because,

W = n R ΔT.

So,

n (Cp/k) ΔT = Q - n R ΔT.

Bring all terms to one side:

n (Cp/k) ΔT + n R ΔT = Q.

Factor n ΔT:

n ΔT ( Cp/k + R ) = Q.

But,

ΔT = T2 - T1.

So,

n (T2 -100) ( Cp/k + R ) =500.

But without knowing (T2 -100), I can't proceed.

Wait, but maybe I can express (T2 -100) in terms of Cp.

Let me see:

n (T2 -100) ( Cp/k + R ) =500.

Let me solve for (T2 -100):

(T2 -100) =500/(n ( Cp/k + R ))

But without knowing n or Cp, I can't proceed.

Hmm, I'm stuck here. I think I'm missing a key piece of information or perhaps a formula that I'm not recalling correctly. For example, perhaps the formula for Cp in terms of Cv and the degrees of freedom, but without that, I can't proceed. 

At this point, I think I need to look for a different approach or perhaps consider that perhaps the problem expects me to make an incorrect assumption, such as using Cp = R, which is incorrect. But that would give T2 = 1660.7°F, which is higher than any options given and would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try to use the formula for Cp in terms of Cv and the specific heats, but without knowing Cv, I can't compute Cp.

Wait, perhaps the problem provides k as Cp/Cv =1.147, but without knowing Cv, I can't proceed.

I think I'm stuck and can't proceed further without additional information.

The problem involves an ideal gas undergoing a constant-pressure process. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Identify the process**: The process is isobaric, meaning the pressure remains constant throughout the process.

2. **Use the first law of thermodynamics**: For an ideal gas, the first law states:
   \[
   \Delta U = Q - W
   \]
   where \( Q \) is the heat added, \( W \) is the work done by the system, and \( \Delta U \) is the change in internal energy.

3. **Express the work done**: For an ideal gas undergoing a constant-pressure process, the work done is:
   \[
   W = n R \Delta T
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of moles, \( R \) is the specific gas constant, and \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature.

4. **Express the change in internal energy**: For an ideal gas, the change in internal energy is:
   \[
   \Delta U = n C_v \Delta T
   \]
   where \( C_v \) is the molar specific heat at constant volume.

5. **Combine the equations**: Substituting \( W \) and \( \Delta U \) into the first law gives:
   \[
   n C_v \Delta T = Q - n R \Delta T
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   n \Delta T (C_v + R) = Q
   \]

6. **Solve for the change in temperature**: The change in temperature is:
   \[
   \Delta T = \frac{Q}{n (C_v + R)}
   \]

7. **Combine with the ideal gas law**: Using the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \), solve for the temperature change in terms of \( Q \) and \( R \):
   \[
   T2 = T1 + \frac{Q}{n (Cv + R)}
   \]

8. **Substitute the given values**: For the problem, \( Q = 500 \, \text{Btu} \), \( R = 0.0641 \, \text{Btu/(lbm·°R)} \), and assuming \( n = 5 \, \text{mol} \), and using \( Cv = \frac{R}{\gamma - 1} \), but without knowing \( \gamma \), this approach isn't viable.

9. **Conclusion**: Without additional information or assumptions, the problem cannot be solved as is. However, if assuming \( Cv = \frac{R}{\gamma - 1} \) with \( \gamma = 1.147 \), the temperature would still be higher than any given options.
