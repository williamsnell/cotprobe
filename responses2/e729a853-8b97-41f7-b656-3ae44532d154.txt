Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about charging a capacitor. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think. The question is, how much work is required to charge a 10 microfarad capacitor to a potential difference of 100 volts?

Wait, I remember that when you charge a capacitor, the work done is related to the energy stored. Oh right, the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor is U = (1/2) CV². Oh wait, but wait, is that the energy you're storing, or is that the work done? Because when you charge the capacitor, you're adding energy, so the work done would equal the energy stored.

So the capacitor's capacitance here is 10 microfarads. Oh wait, micro is 1e-6. So 10e-6 F. And the voltage is 100 V.

So plugging into the formula: U = 0.5 * C * V². Let's compute that. 

First, C is 10e-6 F, V is 100 V.

So U = 0.5 * 10e-6 * (100)^2.

Wait, (100)^2 is 10,000. So U = 0.5 * 10e-6 * 1e4. Because 100 squared is 1e4.

Wait, 10e-6 is 1e-5? Or wait, 10e-6 is 1e-5? No, wait, 10 microfarads is 10 * 1e-6, which is 1e-5 F. Oh wait no, 1e-6 is one micro, so 10e-6 is 1e-5? No, no, wait. 1 microfarad is 1e-6, so 10 microfarads is 1e-5? Wait, no, 10e-6 is 1e-5? Wait no, 10e-6 is 1e-5? No, wait, 1e-6 is 0.000001. 10e-6 is 0.00001. Oh right, so it's 1e-5 F. Wait, no, 10e-6 is 1e-5, because 10 * 1e-6 is 1e-5. Yeah, right.

So U = 0.5 * 1e-5 * (100)^2. Let me compute that. 100 squared is 10,000. So 1e-5 * 1e4 is 1e-1. Oh wait, 1e-5 times 1e4 is (1e-5 * 1e4) = 1e-1.

So 0.5 * 1e-1 is 0.05 J. Oh wait, but wait, 0.5 * 0.1 is 0.05.

So U is 0.05 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.05 J. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but did I remember the formula correctly? Oh right, the work done (which is the energy stored) is (1/2) CV². Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but another thought: when you charge a capacitor, you're moving a charge from one plate to another, and the work done is the integral of q*dV. But for a capacitor, the charge q is C V. So the work W is the integral from V=0 to V=V of q dV. So W = ∫ (C V) dV from 0 to V. Which equals (1/2) C V². Exactly the formula I used. So yes, that's correct.

To determine the work required to charge a 10 μF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2
\]

Here:
- \( C = 10 \, \mu\text{F} = 10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \)
- \( V = 100 \, \text{V} \)

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times (100)^2
\]

First, calculate \( 100^2 = 10,000 \). Then:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10,000
\]

Simplify \( 10 \times 10^{-6} = 10^{-5} \), so:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10^{-5} \times 10,000
\]

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 = 0.05 \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the work required is \( 0.05 \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option B.
