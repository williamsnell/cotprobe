Okay, so I need to figure out which option this question is referring to. Let me read through the question first.

The question says that the provided text is about the Sugar Act of 1764. It mentions that this act was about raising revenue in America to defend trade with Britain. The example given is the sugar trade and similar.

Looking at the options, each is a different policy or event. I need to pick the one that's most similar to the Sugar Act. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Decreasing federal income tax rates in the 1980s. Well, that's about income taxes, not trade or revenue from sugar. So probably not related.

Option B: The economic stimulus package during the 2008 crisis. That's more about government spending and maybe stimulus measures, but the Sugar Act was about revenue, not stimulus. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Protective tariffs during the Industrial Revolution. tariffs were about trade barriers, like the ones in the Sugar Act. That sounds similar because both were trade-related. So maybe C is a contender.

Option D: Gold Standard of the 19th century. That was about establishing a legal currency, like gold. The Sugar Act was about revenue, so nope.

Option E: Deregulation in the 80s. That's about modern policies, like stricter regulations or free markets. The Sugar Act was a specific tax, so E doesn't fit.

Option F: Federal Reserve in 1913. That was after the Civil War, related to banking and money. Not related to sugar.

Option G: U.S. trade policies in the 70s. That includes things like tariffs, trade agreements, but the Sugar Act was about revenue, not specific tariffs. So maybe G is not the best fit.

Option H: New Deal during the Depression. That was about relief and relief programs. No relation to sugar.

Option I: Antitrust reforms in the Progressive Era. That was about preventing monopolies, which is different from revenue issues.

Option J: Increasing income taxes after WWII. That's about raising taxes, which is the opposite of the Sugar Act's goal of reducing taxes.

So the Sugar Act was about raising revenue. The most similar option is the one that's about revenue—like the establishment of protective tariffs. So option C.

The Sugar Act of 1764 was focused on raising revenue from the U.S. economy, specifically through the sugar trade, to support British trade. The most similar option is the establishment of protective tariffs during the Industrial Revolution, which were also a revenue-focused policy aimed at preventing foreign trade barriers. 

Answer: C
