Question:

Explain why the average fixed cost curve (AFC) slopes down-ward throughout, while the average variable cost curve (AVC) slopes down at first, but then turns upward.

Options:

A: The AFC slopes downward due to a decrease in demand for the product, while the AVC slopes upward from the start due to increasing variable costs.
B: The AFC slopes upward as quantity increases
C: The AFC slopes downward because it represents the spread of fixed costs over an increasing number of units, while the AVC initially decreases due to a fixed proportion of inputs and then increases as variable input prices rise.
D: The AVC turns upward due to an increase in fixed inputs
E: The AFC slopes downward as quantity increases because of increased efficiency in production, while the AVC initially decreases due to underutilization of variable inputs and then increases because of market forces.
F: The AFC slopes downward because as quantity increases, the average fixed cost per unit decreases. The AVC slopes down at first due to fuller utilization of the fixed inputs and the extension of specialization but then turns upward due to the law of diminishing returns.
G: The AFC remains constant throughout because it is independent of output, and the AVC slopes downward indefinitely as economies of scale are realized.
H: The AFC slopes downward because as quantity increases, the total fixed cost is spread over more units. The AVC initially falls due to technological advances, but then rises because of increased labor costs.
I: The AVC always slopes downwards
J: Both the AFC and AVC slope downward as quantity increases due to continuous improvements in production technology and efficiency.

Okay, so I've got this economics question here about average fixed cost (AFC) and average variable cost (AVC) curves. Hmm, I need to figure out why AFC slopes downward while AVC slopes downward initially but then turns upward. Let me think through this.

So, AFC is the total fixed cost divided by the quantity produced. Fixed costs don't change with production, so as output increases, AFC should decrease because each additional unit isn't adding any fixed cost. That makes sense. So AFC would go down as quantity increases. But why does AVC behave differently?

AVC is total variable cost divided by quantity. Variable costs do change with production. At first, when you increase production, the additional variable cost per unit might be low because you're using fixed inputs, like machinery, and just getting more workers. So, initially, as you increase production, the more you can spread the variable costs over more units, so the average cost goes down. But after a certain point, adding more workers might lead to diminishing returns. Diminishing returns mean that each additional worker contributes less to output. So, each additional unit of output requires more variable inputs, which could increase the cost, leading to the AVC curve rising.

So, AFC starts at a high point when you produce a lot of units and decreases. But AVC starts at a low point (maybe the same as AFC's initial point) and then decreases, reaches a minimum, and then increases as you add more units which are too costly to variable inputs in terms of the average.

Looking at the options, let me read each one.

Option B: Says AFC slopes upward because of increased demand. That can't be right because AFC is fixed cost per unit, not related to demand. Also, it's not about demand, so probably wrong.

Option C: Says AFC slopes downward due to spread of fixed costs over more units. That fits. Then says AVC initially decreases due to fixed proportion inputs and then increases because variable inputs' prices go up. That makes sense. So, C is talking about the reason for AFC and then the reason for AVC's behavior.

Option E: Says AFC slopes down because of increased efficiency. That's true for AFC, as fixed costs are spread out. Then says AVC initially decreases due to underutilization of variable inputs. Wait, underutilizing variable inputs—could that cause the variable cost to decrease? Or is it the opposite. Because when you have more variable inputs, they might become more efficient, but in the short run, you can't easily switch them. So underutilizing variable inputs might mean that each additional unit adds more variable cost. Not sure. Then says AVC increases because of market forces. That might be correct. So E could explain both.

Option F says AFC slopes downward because as quantity increases, the average fixed cost per unit decreases. That's correct. AVC slopes down due to full utilization of fixed inputs and extension of specialization. That's correct, but then it says AVC turns upward because of diminishing returns. That makes sense. So F explains both AFC and AVC, but does it correctly frame the reasons? Wait, F says AFC slopes downward because quantity increases because of increased efficiency in production. That's correct. For AVC, it says it initially decreases due to full utilization and extension of specialization, which makes sense. Then says it turns upward due to law of diminishing returns. That's correct. So F's explanation is about why both curves slope downward and then upward. Not sure if it's the correct option.

Wait, what about the options. Let me go through each one.

Option A says AFC slopes downward because demand is decreasing. That's probably wrong. AFC is fixed cost per unit, so it's not about demand. Also, AFC doesn't slope upward; it slopes downward. So A is incorrect.

Option B is incorrect because AFC isn't about increased demand. It's about spreading fixed costs over more units.

Option C: First part is correct, because AFC slopes downward. The second part says AVC initially decreases because of fixed proportions and then increases because variable input prices rise. That makes sense because as more variable inputs are used, their cost per unit increases. So C seems to explain both AFC and AVC.

Option E: Says AFC slopes down because of increased efficiency. That's correct. Then says AVC initially decreases due to underutilization of variable inputs, which I think is incorrect. Because underutilizing variable inputs would mean that you're not using as much of them as possible, which would increase the variable cost per unit. So E's explanation for the initial decrease of AVC is wrong.

Option F: Seems to explain both. It says AFC slopes downward because of increased efficiency. Then, for AVC, it says it initially decreases due to full utilization and extension of specialization. Why? Because when you have more fixed inputs, you can use them more efficiently, and as output increases, you can specialize better. So that's correct. Then, says AVC turns upward because of law of diminishing returns. That's correct. So F is explaining why both curves slope downward and then upward. But the question is, why does the AFC slope downward, and why does AVC do the opposite.

Wait, the question is about why AFC slopes downward and why AVC slopes first down then up. So the question is asking, which options correctly explain why AFC slopes downward and why AVC slopes down initially and up later.

Looking at option F: It says AFC slopes downward because quantity increases due to efficiency. That’s true. Then AVC slopes down due to full utilization of fixed inputs and extension of specialization. That’s correct. Then, it says AVC turns upward because of the law of diminishing returns. That's correct. So F is explaining both the AFC and the AVC's behavior.

Wait, but the question is about the 'average fixed cost curve (AFC) slopes downward throughout, while the average variable cost curve (AVC) slopes down at first, but then turns upward.' So, the question is not just about the explanation, but the correct reason. So, the correct answer would explain that AFC slopes down because fixed costs are spread more, and AVC slopes down and then up because as more units are produced, variable costs increase.

Looking at the options.

Option C: Says AFC slopes down due to spread of fixed costs. Then says AVC initially decreases due to fixed proportion and then increases due to variable input prices. That sounds exactly right. So C explains why AFC slopes downward and why, initially, AVC slopes downward and then upward.

Wait, but let's see each option.

Option C: It says AFC slopes downward because it represents spread of fixed costs over more units. That’s true.

Then, the second part: "AVC initially decreases due to a fixed proportion of inputs and then increases as variable input prices rise." Hmm. Fixed proportion of inputs sounds a bit off. Fixed proportion might mean that inputs are used in fixed ratios, but as production increases, the cost per unit of variable inputs increases. So, yes, variable costs rise per unit as output increases. So C is correct in explaining why both curves behave that way.

Option F: It says AFC slopes downward because efficiency. That's correct. Then, it says AVC slopes down due to full utilization of fixed inputs and extension of specialization. That's correct. Then, it says AVC turns upward due to law of diminishing returns. That's correct.

So both C and F seem to explain the behavior correctly. Wait, but the question is asking which option explains why AFC slopes downward and why AVC slopes down then up.

Wait, the question is asking why AFC slopes downward and why AVC does the opposite. So, both are correct, but which options present this.

Looking at the options again:

Which option correctly explains the reason?

Option F's reasoning is that AFC slopes downward because of increased efficiency (so AFC is correct), and for AVC, it says 'initially decreases because of full utilization of the fixed inputs and the extension of specialization.' That makes sense. Then, the reason for the turning up is 'because of the law of diminishing returns.' So F is correct.

Option C: It says AFC slopes downward because of spread of fixed costs. Then, says 'AVC initially decreases due to a fixed proportion of inputs and then increases as variable input prices rise.' Wait, 'fixed proportion' doesn't make much sense here. It's more about the rate at which variable inputs are used. So 'fixed proportion' might relate to the ratio of fixed to variable inputs, which is another way of saying spread. So perhaps C is correct.

Wait, but the question is about AFC and AVC's behavior.

Option C's second part is: "AVC initially decreases due to a fixed proportion of inputs and then increases as variable input prices rise."

Hmm. Fixed proportion of inputs might mean that the ratio of fixed to variable inputs remains the same as production increases. So, for example, if you have more variable inputs, the ratio is fixed. So as production increases, the total variable cost increases, but in terms of cost per unit (AVC), it may decrease or increase. But I'm not sure if 'fixed proportion' is the right term here.

Option F's explanation is perhaps more accurate. F says AFC slopes down because of increased efficiency—so AFC is correct.

For AVC, it says it slopes down because of full utilization of fixed inputs and extension of specialization. That makes sense. Then, the reason for the increase is the law of diminishing returns. So F is correct.

Wait, but the question is about why the AFC slopes downward and why AVC does the opposite.

So, which option does that correctly?

Option C's explanation for AFC is correct. Then, for AVC, option C says it initially decreases due to fixed proportion inputs (which I'm not sure about, but perhaps it's a correct way to phrase it) and then increases due to variable input prices.

Option F's explanation for AFC is correct, and for AVC, it's correct as well.

Wait, but the question is about why AFC slopes downward and why AVC slopes down then up. So, the correct answer would explain that AFC slopes downward because fixed costs are spread over more units, and that AVC initially slopes downward as variable costs are spread more efficiently, but then the variable costs rise because of increasing input prices, leading to higher AVC. This is what option F explains.

But wait, option F says that AFC slopes downward because of increased efficiency, which is correct. Then, for AVC, it says it initially 'decreases due to full utilization of the fixed inputs.' But I think that's not quite accurate. Because the initial decrease in AVC is due to the fact that with more fixed inputs, you can produce more units more efficiently, thus lowering the average variable cost. The 'extension of specialization' refers to using more variable inputs, but that's more about spreading fixed costs.

Wait, but the initial decrease in AVC is due to fixed proportion—like, increasing the use of fixed inputs (like machinery) gives a more efficient way to produce each unit, so each unit's cost goes down. Then, as you add more variable inputs (like labor), each additional unit requires more variable inputs, which can't be scaled as efficiently, leading to higher average variable costs.

So in that case, option F's explanation for the initial decrease in AVC is correct. Then, the increase in AVC is because of the law of diminishing returns, which comes from using more variable inputs and not getting more output for each additional unit of variable input.

So F's explanation is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the reason why AFC slopes down. So in option C, AFC's explanation is correct. Then, the reason why AVC slopes down and then up is explained as well.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct answer is option C. Because, the explanation given in C is accurate.

Alternatively, option F's explanation is correct as well. Let me think about the options again.

Looking for the option that correctly explains why AFC slopes downward and why AVC does the opposite.

Option C: "The AFC slopes downward because it represents the spread of fixed costs over an increasing number of units, while the AVC initially decreases due to a fixed proportion of inputs and then increases as variable input prices rise."

Hmm, perhaps the first part is correct, and the second part is a bit off. "Fixed proportion of inputs" might not be the right term here. It's more about the ratio of fixed to variable inputs. So maybe the correct option is C.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the definitions.

The AFC curve is AFC = TFC / Q.

The AVC curve is AVC = TVC / Q.

TFC is fixed, so AFC decreases as Q increases.

TVC is variable; as Q increases, TVC increases, but since AFC is TFC/Q, so as Q increases beyond a certain point, AFC keeps decreasing.

For AVC:

Initially, as Q increases, the amount of variable inputs increases proportionally, so the average variable cost might decrease. Then, once the variable input becomes so abundant that its cost cannot be increased proportionally, the average variable cost starts increasing.

So, the initial decrease in AVC is due to variable inputs being used more efficiently, which is a fixed proportion—so when you have more variable inputs, the ratio of variable inputs to fixed inputs is fixed, allowing for a more efficient use of variable inputs, thus lowering the average cost.

But the second part is about the law of diminishing returns. As production increases, the amount of variable inputs (like labor) increases, but each additional unit of variable input requires more variable inputs than before. So, each additional unit of output requires more variable inputs, but the additional variable cost per unit increases, so the average increases.

So, in the explanation of the AVC, the initial decrease is due to more efficient use of variable inputs (so they are in fixed proportion), and the increase is due to the law of diminishing returns (as more variable inputs are used, each additional one is less efficient).

So, looking at option F, it says: "The AFC slopes downward because quantity increases... while the AVC initially decreases due to full utilization of fixed inputs and then increases because of increasing variable input prices."

Wait, but 'full utilization of fixed inputs' isn't the correct term. It's the ratio of fixed to variable inputs that changes.

Alternatively, option C says, in the second part: "initially decreases due to a fixed proportion of inputs and then increases as variable input prices rise." So, the 'fixed proportion' part is correct in the sense that as you add more inputs, the ratio becomes fixed, so each additional unit can be produced more cheaply. But the 'variable input prices rise'—that's correct, because variable costs per unit rise as more inputs are used.

So perhaps option C is correct.

Looking back, the correct answer should explain that AFC slopes downward because of spreading fixed costs, which is correct. Then, for AVC, it's initial decrease due to fixed proportion and variable input costs rising.

So, let's check the options.

Option C says: "The AFC slopes downward because it represents the spread of fixed costs over an increasing number of units, while the AVC initially decreases due to a fixed proportion of inputs and then increases as variable input prices rise."

That seems correct.

Wait, but another option is option F. Option F says:

"The AFC slopes downward because quantity increases due to increased efficiency in production, while the AVC initially decreases due to full utilization of the fixed inputs and the extension of specialization but then turns upward due to the law of diminishing returns."

That explains AFC correctly.

For AVC, the reasoning is: AFC's explanation is correct. For AVC, the initial decrease is because of full utilization of fixed inputs (which is correct) and extension of specialization, which is also correct. Then, the reason for upward is law of diminishing returns. So option F's explanation is correct.

But wait, the question is about why AFC slopes downward and why AVC slopes down then up.

So, which option correctly explains that.

The correct answer is option C or option F.

Let me review.

Option C explanation:

- AFC slopes downward because spread of fixed costs: Correct.

- AVC initially decreases due to fixed proportion (probably correct), and increases due to variable input prices: Correct.

Option F:

- AFC slopes downward because efficiency: Correct.

- AVC initially decreases due to full utilization of fixed inputs: Correct.

- Then, increases due to law of diminishing returns: Correct.

So both options C and F explain why AFC slopes downward and why AVC slopes down, then up.

But wait, the question is phrased, so the correct option should explain both phenomena correctly.

Wait, what's the question again: "Why the average fixed cost curve (AFC) slopes downward-while the average variable cost curve (AVC) slopes down at first, but then turns upward."

So, the correct answer should explain both curves: AFC slopes down, and AVC slopes down then up.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Correct.

Option F: Correct.

Wait, perhaps both C and F are correct, but let's check the options.

Wait, the options are:

Option F: "The AFC slopes downward because as quantity increases, the average fixed cost per unit decreases. The AVC slopes down at first due to fuller utilization of the fixed inputs and the extension of specialization but then turns upward due to the law of diminishing returns."

So, this option correctly explains both AFC and AVC.

But wait, the original question asks why AFC and AVC do this. So perhaps both C and F are correct if both options explain the two behaviors.

Wait, the question is about why AFC slopes downward and why AVC slopes down then up.

Option C explains that AFC slopes downward because fixed costs are spread, and in the same option, explains why AVC slopes down and up.

Similarly, option F explains both.

Wait, but which of the options is correct.

Wait, let's analyze each option again.

Option C: AFC slopes downward because spread of fixed costs. The second part says that AVC initially decreases due to fixed proportion of inputs and then increases because variable input prices rise.

But the term 'fixed proportion' in the second part might not be correct. It should be 'fixed ratio', but perhaps it's a correct explanation.

Option F: The AFC's explanation is correct. The AVC's explanation is correct.

So, both C and F explain the phenomena correctly.

But looking back, the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

The correct answer is option C.

Because:

- The AFC slopes downward because as more units are produced, the fixed costs are spread across more units. Hence, AFC becomes lower.

- For the AVC, the first part is correct. The second part is a bit off, but the explanation still holds.

Wait, another approach: Let's read each option's options.

Question: why AFC slopes down, and why AVC slopes down then up.

Which option correctly explains this.

Option C: It says AFC slopes down because fixed costs are spread over more units. Correct. Then, for AVC, it says 'initially decreases due to fixed proportion of inputs.' Hmm, perhaps I should look for the correct option.

Looking at the other options, the correct answer is option C.

Because, for AFC, the reason is correct, and for AVC, the reason is correct as well. So both C and F explain both curves, but perhaps only C correctly explains the reason for AFC.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option C.

Because:

- AFC slopes downward because fixed costs are spread over more units. Correct.

- AVC slopes down because you're spreading fixed costs, and then up because variable costs rise due to increasing input prices. Correct.

So, option C correctly explains both the AFC and the AVC's behavior.

But wait, why is the AVC's slope first down then up? Because AFC is decreasing, so the marginal cost of each unit is AFC. That is, TVC = AFC * Q. So, as Q increases, AFC decreases, so the marginal cost (MVC) is decreasing.

Wait, no, in reality, the marginal cost curve is the derivative of the total cost curve. So, the first part is correct.

But, for the AVC, as Q increases, the average variable cost may initially decrease (due to spreading fixed costs) and then increase (due to increasing variable costs beyond the fixed cost).

So, the correct option would explain why AFC slopes down (because of spreading fixed costs) and why AVC slopes down then up (because of spreading fixed costs and law of diminishing returns).

So, option C correctly states that AFC slopes down due to spread, and explains why AVC slopes down and up.

Thus, the correct answer is option C.
