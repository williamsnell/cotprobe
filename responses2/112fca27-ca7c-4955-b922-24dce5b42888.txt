Okay, so I've got this question about GDP Deflator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that nominal GDP is $5000 and real GDP is $4000. They're asking for the GDP Deflator. I remember that the GDP Deflator is a measure of price changes, right? It's used to adjust nominal GDP to real GDP.

Wait, what's the formula again? I think the Deflator is calculated as (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) multiplied by 100. Oh right, so it's (5000 / 4000) * 100. Let me calculate that.

5000 divided by 4000 is 1.25. Multiply by 100, that gives 125. So the GDP Deflator should be 125. Looking at the options, option B is 125. That makes sense.

Wait, did I get the formula right? I always get confused sometimes. Let me double-check. Oh yeah,nominal divided by real is the deflator. That gives the price index. So I think I did it right.

The GDP Deflator is calculated as the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP multiplied by 100. Using the given values:

GDP Deflator = (5000 / 4000) * 100 = 125.

The correct answer is **B: 125**.
