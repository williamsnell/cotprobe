Okay, so I've got this question about hypovolaemic shock and the percentage of blood lost before changes in heart rate and blood pressure occur. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my medical terms, but let me think through this.

First, what's hypovolaemic shock? From what I remember, it's when there's a drop in blood pressure below 80 mmHg. It's a type of shock that happens when blood volume decreases quickly. So, it's more about the body losing blood rather than the body losing glucose or something like that.

The question is asking what percentage of the blood can be lost before these changes happen. The options are percentages like 15%, 25%, 70%, 10%, etc. I think the key here is to remember the threshold for when blood volume starts to drop and causes these changes.

I remember that during hypovolaemic shock, the body's blood volume decreases rapidly. I think the critical point is around 25% loss. Wait, but waitâ€”I've heard that sometimes it's more than that. Oh, right! The exact percentage can vary, but I think it's around 25% or maybe even higher. But wait, the question is asking for the percentage before changes are observed. So, maybe it's when the blood volume drops to a point where the body starts to notice the decrease, like when it's below 30% or something. 

Wait, another angle: in the human body, when blood volume drops, the body can detect it and start compensating. I think the point where the body starts to notice the drop is when it's about 25% of the blood. So when the blood drops to 25% of normal, the body begins to respond, causing heart rate and blood pressure changes. So that would make option B (25%) the correct answer.

The correct answer is **B: 25%**. In hypovolaemic shock, the body's blood volume decreases rapidly, and the body begins to respond when blood volume drops to 25% of normal, causing changes in heart rate and blood pressure. 

Answer: B
