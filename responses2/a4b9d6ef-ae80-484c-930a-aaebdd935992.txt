Okay, so I have this question where I need to find the deviations of each value from the mean. The values given are 4, 4, 6, 7, 9. Hmm, I remember that deviation is just the difference between each value and the mean. But wait, what's the mean exactly? Oh right, it's the average of all the numbers.

Let me start by calculating the mean. So I need to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. The numbers are 4, 4, 6, 7, 9. Let's add them up: 4 +4 is 8, plus 6 is 14, plus 7 is 21, plus 9 is 30. Oh wait, no, 4+4 is 8, plus 6 is 14, plus 7 is 21, plus 9 is 30. Wait, no, 4+4 is 8, plus 6 is 14, 14+7 is 21, 21+9 is 30. So total sum is 30. There are 5 numbers, so the mean is 30 divided by 5, which is 6. Got it, mean is 6.

Now for each number, I subtract the mean. Let me list them one by one.

First number is 4. 4 minus 6 is -2. Second number is also 4, same as the first. 4-6 is also -2. Third number is 6. 6 minus 6 is 0. Fourth number is 7. 7-6 is 1. Fifth number is 9. 9-6 is 3. So the deviations are -2, -2, 0, 1, 3.

Wait, let me double-check. Did I do that right? 4-6=-2, yes. 4-6=-2 again. 6 is 0. 7-6=1. 9-6=3. Yeah, that looks right.

Looking at the options, option E is -2, 0, 1, 3, and a 4. Wait, no, E is -2, 0, 1, 1,4. Oh wait, no, I think I have a mistake here. Because the fifth deviation is 3, not 4. So option E must be wrong.

Wait, let me re-examine. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the deviations.

Wait no, no. Wait, I think I did the deviations correctly. 4-6 is -2, 4-6 is -2, 6-6 is 0, 7-6 is 1, 9-6 is 3. So the deviations are -2, -2, 0, 1, 3.

Looking at the options, let me check which one matches. Option D is 0,0,2,3,5. No, that's not right. Option F is -1, -1, 1, 2,3. No. Option G: -3, -3, 0, 1,2. No. Option H: -2,-2,0,1,3. Wait, that's exactly what I got. Oh wait, option H's values are -2, -2, 0, 1, 3. Let me check: the first deviation is 4-6 = -2, correct. Second 4-6=-2. Third 6-6=0. Fourth 7-6=1. Fifth 9-6=3. So yes, the deviations are -2, -2, 0, 1, 3. So that's option H.

Wait, but looking at option E again. Oh, wait, I think I see a mistake in my thought process. Because in option E, the last value is 4, but according to our calculation, it should be 3. So option E is wrong.

Wait, no, wait, no. Let me check option E again. E is: -2, 0, 1, 1, 4. Wait, that's four numbers, but no, the question has five numbers. So perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recheck the deviations.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I made a mistake in the initial mean calculation. Let me recalculate the mean. The numbers are 4,4,6,7,9. So sum is 4+4 is 8, plus 6 is 14, plus 7 is 21, plus 9 is 30. So 30 divided by 5 is 6. Correct.

So each deviation is:

4 -6 = -2.

4 -6 = -2.

6-6=0.

7-6=1.

9-6=3.

So the deviations are -2, -2, 0,1,3. Looking at the options, option H is exactly this. So the answer is H.
</think>

The mean of the values 4, 4, 6, 7, 9 is calculated as follows: sum = 30, divided by 5 values, so mean = 6. The deviations are calculated by subtracting the mean from each value: 4-6=-2, 4-6=-2, 6-6=0, 7-6=1, 9-6=3. The deviations are -2, -2, 0, 1, 3, which matches option H.

Answer: H
