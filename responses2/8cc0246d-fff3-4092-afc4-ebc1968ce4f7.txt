Alright, so I've got this question about Convolutional Neural Networks, specifically about the dimensions of the activation map after a convolutional layer. Hmm, okay, let's think this through step by step.

The problem says that the Convolutional Neural Network D2 takes input images of size 32x32, and they're using 1 color channel. The first layer uses 4 filters of size 5x5, with a stride of 2 and zero-padding of width 1. The question is asking for the dimensions of the activation map for each filter in this first layer.

Wait, I remember that in convolutional layers, each filter applies a kernel (which is the filter size) to the input. The stride determines how much the kernel moves over the input. Zero-padding is when you add some extra elements around the input to maintain the size, especially when the kernel size is larger than the stride or when the padding is needed for certain operations.

Let me try to recall the formula for calculating the output dimensions after convolution. I think the formula is something like:

output_height = floor( (input_height - kernel_height + padding) / stride )

Similarly for output_width. Oh wait, but sometimes people use ceiling if there's a fractional value, but I think in this case, they might just use integer division, so maybe it's exact.

So the input height is 32, kernel height is 5, padding is 1, and stride is 2.

So for the height dimension:

(32 - 5 + 1) = 28. Then divided by 2. 28 / 2 = 14. So the output height would be 14. Wait, but that's without considering whether the division is exact or not. So perhaps the output is 14 in height.

Wait, considering that the formula is (input - filter_size + padding) divided by stride. So (32 -5 + 1)= 28, divided by 2 is 14. So that would give an output height of 14.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Because sometimes the formula uses floor, but in this case, since 28 is divisible by 2, it's 14. So the output height is 14.

Same for the width. The input width is 32, filter width is 5, padding is 1. So (32 -5 +1)=28. Divided by 2 is 14. So output width is 14.

So the activation map dimensions would be 14x14. So each filter's activation map is 14x14. So looking at the options, option B is 14, so that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, sometimes when using zero padding, the formula can be a bit different. Oh wait, wait: the formula is (height - kernel size + padding) / stride, and if that's not an integer, we take the floor. But in this case, 28/2 is 14, exact. So output height is 14.

So each filter's activation map is 14x14, so the correct option is B.

The question involves determining the dimensions of the activation map produced by a convolutional layer in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN processes input images of size 32x32 with 1 color channel. The first layer uses 4 filters of size 5x5, with a stride of 2 and zero-padding of width 1.

To calculate the output dimensions, the formula used is:

\[
\text{output\_height} = \left\lfloor \frac{\text{input\_height} - \text{kernel\_height} + \text{padding}}{\text{stride}} \right\rfloor
\]

Substituting the given values:

- Input height = 32
- Kernel height = 5
- Padding = 1
-Stride = 2

\[
\text{output\_height} = \left\lfloor \frac{32 - 5 + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{28}{2} \right\rfloor = 14
\]

Similarly, for the width:

- Input width = 32
- Kernel width = 5

\[
\text{output\_width} = \left\lfloor \frac{32 - 5 + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{28}{2} \right\rfloor = 14
\]

Thus, the activation map for each filter is 14x14. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:
