Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The question is about the set S, which consists of integers between 1 and 2^40. These numbers must have exactly two '1's when written in base 2, which means they have exactly two bits set to 1. The question is asking for the probability that a randomly selected integer from S is divisible by 9. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, so I need to find the number of integers in S that are divisible by 9 and then divide that by the total number of elements in S. That should give me the probability.

First, let's figure out how many elements are in set S. Since we're dealing with binary numbers up to 2^40, the number of integers with exactly two 1's is the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 40. That's a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!).

So, the total number of elements in S is C(40, 2). Let me calculate that. 40 choose 2 is (40 * 39)/2 = 780. So, |S| = 780.

Now, I need to find the number of integers in S that are divisible by 9. That means I have to find how many of these numbers (which have exactly two 1's in their binary representation) are divisible by 9.

Let me think about what it means for a binary number to be divisible by 9. A binary number is just a sum of powers of 2, right? So, if a number in binary has two 1's, say at positions i and j (where i > j, to avoid counting duplicates), then the number is 2^i + 2^j.

So, the number is 2^i + 2^j. We need this to be divisible by 9. So, 2^i + 2^j ≡ 0 mod 9.

Hmm, I can rewrite 2^i + 2^j as 2^j (1 + 2^{i-j}). Let's let k = i - j, where k is a positive integer. Then, the expression becomes 2^j (1 + 2^k). So, 2^j (1 + 2^k) must be divisible by 9.

Wait, 9 is 3^2. So, for 2^j (1 + 2^k) to be divisible by 9, 1 + 2^k must be divisible by 9. Because 2^j is a power of 2, and 2 and 9 are coprime (they have no common factors besides 1). So, if 2^j is coprime with 9, then the divisibility of the product by 9 depends solely on 1 + 2^k being divisible by 9.

So, the condition simplifies to: 1 + 2^k ≡ 0 mod 9 => 2^k ≡ -1 mod 9. But since we're working with positive integers modulo 9, -1 is equivalent to 8 mod 9. So, we're looking for k such that 2^k ≡ 8 mod 9.

Wait, let's compute the powers of 2 modulo 9 to see which k satisfy this condition.

Let me list out the powers of 2 mod 9:

2^1 = 2 → 2 mod 9
2^2 = 4 →4
2^3 = 8 →8
2^4 = 16 →16 mod9 is 7
2^5 = 32 →32 mod9: 32 /9 is 3*9=27, 32-27=5 →5
2^6 = 64 →64 mod9: 9*7=63, 64-63=1 →1
2^7 = 128 →128 mod9: 128 - 14*9= 128-126=2 →2
Wait, wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 2^6 is 64. 64 divided by 9: 9*7=63, so 64 mod9 is 1. Then 2^7 is 128. 128 divided by 9 is 14*9=126, 128-126=2. So 2^7 mod9 is 2. 

Wait, but 2^1 is 2 mod9, 2^2 is 4, 2^3 is 8, 2^4 is 16 mod9=7, 2^5=32 mod9=5, 2^6=64 mod9=1, 2^7=128 mod9=2, 2^8=256 mod9. Let me compute 256/9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4. So 2^8 mod9 is 4. Hmm, wait, maybe I should look for when 2^k mod9 is 8.

Looking back, 2^3 mod9 is 8. So, when k=3, 2^k mod9 is 8. What about k=3+6n, where n is a positive integer? Because the powers of 2 mod9 cycle every 6 steps, since 2^6 mod9=1, so after that, they repeat.

Wait, let me check that. 2^3 is 8 mod9. 2^6 is (2^3)^2 = 8^2 =64 mod9=1. Then 2^9 is (2^3)^3=8^3=512. Let's compute 512 mod9: 512 divided by 9 is 56*9=504, 512-504=8. So 2^9 mod9=8. So yes, 2^k mod9 is 8 when k is congruent to 3 mod6.

So, k ≡3 mod6. So, the exponents k must be of the form 6m +3, where m is a non-negative integer (since k is a positive integer, m can be 0,1,2,...).

Wait, wait, no. Wait k must be such that 2^k ≡8 mod9, which occurs when k mod6=3. So k can be 3,9,15,21,... etc.

So, for the expression 2^j*(1 +2^k) to be divisible by 9, 1 +2^k must be divisible by 9, meaning k must be 3 mod6. So k=3,9,15, etc.

Now, remembering that k = i-j, which is the difference between the two positions where the 1's are in the binary number. So, i-j must be congruent to 3 mod6.

So, for each possible k that is 3 mod6, we can find the number of pairs (j,i) where i-j=k. Since i and j are positions in a 40-bit number (from 0 to 39 perhaps), j must be such that j +k ≤39. Because j and i are both between 0 and 39, inclusive.

Wait, so in the binary number, positions are from 0 to 39, because 2^40 is the upper limit. So, the two positions (bits) are from 0 up to 39.

So, for each k where k ≡3 mod6, the number of such pairs is (40 -k -1) ? Wait, wait. Wait, let me think about this.

Suppose k is 3. Then i = j +3. For j to be as small as possible, j can be 0, so i=3. The maximum j is such that j +k ≤39. So, j can be up to 39 -k. So, the number of possible j's is (39 -k) +1, because j can be 0,1,..., 39 -k. So, the count is (40 -k).

Wait, for example, if k=3: j can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39 -3=36. So j can be from 0 to 36, which is 37 values? Wait, no, 39 -3 =36, so j can be 0,1,...,36 (37 values). So for k=3, the number of pairs is 37.

Wait, but 40 -k is 37. For k=3, 40-3=37, which matches. So, in general, for each k, the number of pairs is 40 -k, provided that k ≤39 (since j can be 0, so i=k is allowed, but if k>39, then no solutions). But in our case, since k must be ≡3 mod6, and k can be up to 39. So, the maximum k is 3, 9, 15,..., 39? Wait, 39 divided by 6 is 6.5, so the maximum k in 3 mod6 below 40 is 39, if 39 mod6 is 3. Let's check: 6*6=36, 36+3=39. Yes, 39 mod6 is 3. So k can be 3,9,15,21,27,33,39.

So, for each of these k values, the number of pairs is (40 -k). So, let's list all possible k:

k=3: count =40-3=37

k=9: 40-9=31

k=15:40-15=25

k=21:19

k=27:13

k=33:7

k=39:1

Wait, wait, let me recount. For k=3, 40-3=37, yes. For k=9, 40-9=31. k=15:25, yes. k=21:19, k=27:13, k=33:7, k=39:1. So, these are the counts for each k.

So, the total number of valid pairs (i,j) is the sum of these counts.

Wait, let's add them up.

37 + 31 = 68

68 + 25 =93

93 +19=112

112 +13=125

125 +7=132

132+1=133.

So, 133 pairs in total.

Wait, but wait a minute, let me make sure I didn't add wrong. Let me list them:

k=3:37

k=9:31 → sum 68

k=15:25 →93

k=21:19 →112

k=27:13 →125

k=33:7 →132

k=39:1 →133. Yeah, that's 133.

So, 133 pairs where i-j =k, and k=3,9,15,21,27,33,39.

Now, each of these pairs contributes a number of the form 2^j*(1+2^k) which is 2^j*(something divisible by 9), since 1+2^k is a multiple of 9. So, each of these 133 numbers is divisible by 9. Therefore, the number of elements in S divisible by 9 is 133.

So, the probability is 133 divided by the total number of elements in S, which is 780.

So, probability P = 133 / 780.

Let me compute that. Let's see, 133 ÷ 780.

Well, 780 divided by 133 is approximately 5.86, so 133/780 is approximately 0.1705.

Wait, 133 * 5 =665, 665 * 1.2= 798, which is 780 *1.0125. Hmm, maybe better to compute as decimals.

So, 133 ÷780 = 0.1705128205... So, approximately 0.1705.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.1705.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the counts for each k. Because I might have made a mistake in adding them.

Wait, let's recount each term:

k=3:37 → correct.

k=9:40-9=31 → correct.

k=15:40-15=25 → correct.

k=21:40-21=19 → correct.

k=27:40-27=13 → correct.

k=33:40-33=7 → correct.

k=39:40-39=1 → correct.

Adding these:37 +31=68; 68+25=93; 93+19=112; 112+13=125; 125+7=132; 132+1=133. So, yes, 133.

Hmm, 133/780 is 0.17051282..., which is approximately 0.1705.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.1705, which matches.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves finding the probability that a randomly selected integer from the set \( S \) (which contains integers between 1 and \( 2^{40} \) with exactly two 1's in their binary representation) is divisible by 9. 

1. **Total Number of Elements in \( S \):**  
   The number of integers in \( S \) is the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 40, which is given by the combination formula \( \binom{40}{2} = 780 \).

2. **Divisibility by 9:**  
   An integer in \( S \) has the binary form \( 2^i + 2^j \) where \( i > j \). For this to be divisible by 9, \( 1 + 2^k \) must be divisible by 9, where \( k = i - j \). This occurs when \( k \equiv 3 \mod 6 \).

3. **Valid \( k \) Values:**  
   The valid \( k \) values are 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, and 39. For each, the number of pairs \( (j, i) \) is \( 40 - k \):
   - \( k = 3 \): 37 pairs
   - \( k = 9 \): 31 pairs
   - \( k = 15 \): 25 pairs
   - \( k = 21 \): 19 pairs
   - \( k = 27 \): 13 pairs
   - \( k = 33 \): 7 pairs
   - \( k = 39 \): 1 pair
   Total: 133 pairs.

4. **Probability Calculation:**  
   The probability is \( \frac{133}{780} \approx 0.1705 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **B: 0.1705**.
