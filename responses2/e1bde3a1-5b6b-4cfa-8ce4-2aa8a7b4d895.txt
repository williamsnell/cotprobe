Okay, so I have this question about amino acids and carbohydrates, and I need to figure out what's different between them. Let me think about what I know.

Amino acids are organic molecules, right? They're made from an amino group and an amine. So their basic structure is a carboxylic acid (the -COOH group) attached to an amine group. Their structure also includes oxygen atoms because of the carboxylic acid part. So amino acids have oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen.

Carbohydrates are a bit different. They're also organic but made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Wait, but wait—wait, carbohydrates are usually categorized into monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. Monosaccharides are simple sugars, and they have one sugar unit. I remember that monosaccharides have a carbonyl group (like a -CHO) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a CH2 group. Oh, and when they bond, they form a ring structure.

So when you look at the atoms in a carbohydrate, they have one oxygen atom from the carbonyl group and another from the hydroxyl group. But wait, wait—wait a second. Wait, no. Actually, each monosaccharide has a carbonyl group (which is a carbonyl, O=C-OH) and each glucose has a hydroxyl group attached to the carbon. So each monosaccharide has one oxygen (from the carbonyl) and one oxygen from the hydroxyl? Or wait, no—wait, perhaps each monosaccharide has one O from the carbonyl and one O from the hydroxyl group. So each has two O atoms in total. But when they bond to form the ring, the oxygen from the ring oxygen becomes part of the glycosidic bond, but the individual monosaccharide still has the O from the carbonyl and another O from the hydroxyl.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the oxygen atoms in a carbohydrate are two per monosaccharide. Wait, no—that's not correct. Wait, maybe each molecule has two oxygen atoms, but when they bond, one oxygen becomes part of the glycosidic bond, and another is in the ring oxygen. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about each monosaccharide molecule itself. Like, each glucose has a carbonyl group (O) and a hydroxyl group (O). So each glucose has two oxygen atoms. But when they bond, the oxygen from the ring becomes part of the glycosidic bond, so each molecule is still two oxygen atoms. So a carbohydrate molecule has two oxygen atoms, but perhaps only one is considered per molecule in the ring when they bond.

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Let me list the atoms in both molecules.

Amino acids: 
- Carboxylic acid group: -COOH (so one C, two O, and one H)
- Amine group: -NH2 (so one N, two H)
So total in amino acids: C, O, N, H.

Carbohydrates:
- The molecule consists of glucose units connected by glycosidic bonds.
- Each glucose has a carbonyl group (O), a hydroxyl group (O), and a CH2 group (C, H2)
But when they bond, the O from the ring becomes part of the glycosidic bond, so each molecule is two O's. But when considering the entire carbohydrate molecule, it's just made of C, H, O, and N.

Wait, but wait—carbohydrates are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. So if that's the case, then the presence of nitrogen in amino acids is a key difference.

Looking at the options:

A: carbon atoms—both have carbon.
B: oxygen atoms—both have oxygen, but in different numbers? Wait, amino acids have two oxygen atoms, one from COOH and one from NH2. Carbohydrates have two oxygen atoms as well, but perhaps one is from the ring and one from elsewhere. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is one O, and the hydroxyl is another O, so two O per molecule. So both have two O atoms.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question is about what's not found in carbohydrates. So which option is not present in carbohydrates.

Option C: Nitrogen atoms. Amino acids have nitrogen (NH2). Carbohydrates don't have nitrogen. So the presence of nitrogen is a feature of amino acids not present in carbohydrates. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Carbohydrates are made of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen. So nitrogen is absent.

So the question is, the feature NOT found in carbohydrates. So the answer should be C: nitrogen atoms.

Wait, but wait the options: the question says "the presence of" something, so which is not in carbohydrates.

So amino acids have N, carbohydrates don't. So the correct answer is C: nitrogen atoms.

Amino acids are organic molecules composed of an amino group and a carboxylic acid group. Their structure includes a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an amine (-NH2), along with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen atoms. On the other hand, carbohydrates are also organic molecules but are categorized into monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. Monosaccharides, for instance, have a carbonyl group (-COOH) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a CH2 group. Each monosaccharide molecule contains two oxygen atoms: one from the carbonyl group and one from the hydroxyl group. When monosaccharides bond to form carbohydrates, the oxygen atoms are part of the glycosidic bond, but each monosaccharide molecule itself still contains two oxygen atoms.

Carbohydrates, however, are composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms. They do not contain nitrogen atoms, which are absent in amino acids. Therefore, the presence of nitrogen atoms is a key difference between amino acids and carbohydrates.
