Okay, so I've got this question about the binary number system, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the first digit from right to left in a binary number. The options are various terms like First Significant Bit, MSB, LSB, etc. I remember that in binary numbers, the rightmost digit is the least significant bit, and each position to the left is more significant.

Wait, so the rightmost bit is the least significant, which is the first bit from the right. But the question is about the first digit from right to left. Right to left is the same as least significant to most significant bits. So the first digit in that order would be the rightmost bit, which is the LSB. But looking at the options, the terms are MSB and LSB.

Wait, MSB stands for Most Significant Bit. That's the first digit from left to right. But the question is about the first digit from right to left, which would be the LSB. However, the options don't have a term called LSB; instead, there's an option labeled C) LSB, Least Significant Bit.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people get confused between MSB and LSB. Let me think again. In a binary number, the rightmost bit is the least significant, so it's the first digit from the right. So that's the LSB. So the correct term would be LSB, which is option C.

Wait, but another way to look at it: the first digit from right to left is the LSB. So the correct answer is C: LSB, Least Significant Bit.

Alternatively, some might confuse it with MSB being the first from left, which would be the first digit from right to left. So the first digit from right to left is indeed the LSB, so the correct term is LSB.

Looking at the options again, option C is "LSB, Least Significant Bit." Wait, but the question is about the first digit (bit) from right to left. So rightmost is LSB. So the correct term is LSB, so the correct option is C. Or wait, the options are labeled as letters, and the options are:

C: LSB, Least Significant Bit.

So the question is asking what that first digit is called. So the first digit from right to left is LSB, which is correct. So the correct answer should be C.

The first digit from right to left in a binary number is the least significant bit (LSB). 

Answer: C: LSB, Least Significant Bit.
