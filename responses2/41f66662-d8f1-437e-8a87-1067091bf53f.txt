Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about logical fallacies, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is: When someone tries to support a proposition with information that really has nothing to do with the claim being made, what fallacy have they committed? The options are A: straw person, B: genetic fallacy, C: irrelevant conclusion.

Hmm, I remember that fallacies are errors in reasoning that can lead to incorrect conclusions. The question is about a specific type of error where someone uses irrelevant information to support their claim.

Let me think about each option. 

Option A: Straw person. Wait, I think that's when someone ignores the opponent's point and just presents their own argument. Like, they say, "I'm arguing for this proposition, let's ignore the bad idea they presented." So if someone uses irrelevant information to support their claim, they might be using a straw person. But wait, isn't straw person about ignoring the opponent's position, not about using irrelevant information?

Option B: Genetic fallacy. I'm not too sure about this one. I think genetic fallacy is about making a claim based on a genetic fact without considering other factors. But the question is about irrelevant information, not genetics. So I'm not sure this applies here.

Option C: Irrelevant conclusion. Okay, this seems more direct. If someone presents evidence that doesn't relate to the proposition, the conclusion they draw must also be irrelevant. So in that case, the person has committed an irrelevant conclusion fallacy.

Wait, but I thought straw person was about ignoring the opponent's claims. So maybe I was confused earlier. The question is about someone supporting a proposition with irrelevant info, which is different from ignoring the opponent's position. So if someone tries to support their claim using irrelevant info, they might have used a straw person fallacy. But wait, no, wait. Straw person is about ignoring the opponent's position, not trying to use irrelevant info. So the correct fallacy here would be straw person, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me clarify. The straw person fallacy is when someone ignores the opponent's claim and instead presents their own argument. So if someone is trying to support their own position with irrelevant info, they might be using the straw person fallacy. Because they're trying to argue against the opponent without addressing it, maybe.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. The straw person fallacy is when someone attacks a person's argument by bringing up irrelevant details. For example, if someone is arguing about a legal issue, and they bring up a political topic, that's a straw person because they're attacking the wrong person's argument, not the claim they're making.

So in this question, the person is trying to support their proposition with irrelevant information. That would mean they're bringing up facts that don't relate to the main point. So that's not a straw person because straw person is about attacking the opponent's argument, not supporting your own. 

So in that case, the fallacy would be irrelevant conclusion because the person's conclusion is based on irrelevant premises.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline:

Straw person: ignore opponent's claim, attack their argument. So if someone is trying to argue against someone else, they bring up irrelevant info.

Irrelevant conclusion: the conclusion is based on irrelevant premises. So if someone presents evidence that doesn't relate to the proposition, they draw a conclusion that's irrelevant.

So the question is about trying to support the proposition with irrelevant info. So that's not a straw person because straw person is attacking the opponent's point. Instead, it's an irrelevant conclusion because the conclusion is based on irrelevant premises.

So the correct answer should be C: irrelevant conclusion.

Wait, but let me check another angle. Maybe the person is trying to use irrelevant info to attack the claim, which would be a different fallacy, like the straw person. But in this question, the person is trying to support the claim, so the fallacy they're committing is one where they use irrelevant info to support their claim. That would be an irrelevant conclusion because their conclusion is based on irrelevant premises.

So the answer should be C: irrelevant conclusion.
</think>

The correct answer is C: irrelevant conclusion.

When someone attempts to support a proposition with irrelevant information, they are committing an irrelevant conclusion fallacy. This occurs because the conclusion is drawn from premises that have no relevance to the claim being made, leading to an incorrect or unsupported conclusion. 

Answer: C
