Okay, so I've got this question about the regional lymphatic drainage of the left side of the tip of the tongue. Hmm, I remember that lymphatic drainage is related to lymph nodes and lymphatic tissues. The tongue has some lymphatic nodes, and when the question mentions the left side of the tip, I think it's referring to the left side of the tongue's tip.

Wait, I think the left side of the tongue's tip is connected to the left submental lymph nodes. Submental nodes are found in the subtlety region of the tongue. Oh right, the submental nodes are part of the submental space, which includes the left and right submental nodes. They're involved in the drainage of the tongue's tip.

Let me think about the options. Option A is left submental, which I think is correct. Option B is bilateral cervical nodes, which don't seem related. Option C is left cervical, not sure about that. Option D is both left and right submandibular, which might be related to the tongue's side, like the tongue's side can have submandibular nodes. Option E is right submandibular, but the question is about the left side, so maybe not. Option F is left and right cervical, which I don't think are involved. Option G is left submandibular, which I'm not certain about. Option H is left and right submental, but the question is about the tip, so probably only one submental node. Option I is left cervical and right submandibular; I don't think that's right. Option J is right submental, which I don't think is involved here.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be A: left submental lymph node. I'm pretty confident now because I remember the submental nodes are involved in the tongue's drainage. The left side of the tongue's tip connects to these submental nodes, which help in the lymphatic drainage.

The correct answer is:

**A: left submental lymph node.**

The left side of the tip of the tongue is connected to the left submental lymph nodes, which play a role in the lymphatic drainage of the tongue.
