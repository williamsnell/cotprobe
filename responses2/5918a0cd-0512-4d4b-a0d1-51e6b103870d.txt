Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrode potentials. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that the Ksp for AgCl is 1.8 × 10^-10, and we're looking at a silver-silver chloride electrode in 1M KCl. I remember that the electrode potential is related to the concentration of the ions involved and the standard potential.

Wait, the standard oxidation potential for Ag being oxidized to Ag+ is given as -0.799 volts. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the standard potential for the Ag+ + e^- → Ag is positive, right? Because I think the standard reduction potential for Ag+ is about 0.80 V. So the oxidation potential (reverse of that) would be -0.80 V. But wait, the question says the standard oxidation potential is -0.799 volts. Hmm. Maybe the given value is just a rounded version, but I'll note that perhaps it's a typo, but I'll proceed.

The electrode in question is Ag-Cl, so the reaction is probably AgCl(s) + e^- → Ag(s) + Cl^- (aq). Or wait, maybe it's the reverse. Wait, the AgCl is a solid. So the half-reaction would be something like AgCl(s) + e^- → Ag(s) + Cl^- (aq). Or maybe the other way around. Let me think. The standard reduction would be Ag+ + e^- → Ag(s), which has a standard potential of 0.80 V. So the reverse (oxidation) would be -0.80 V. But the question says the standard oxidation is -0.799 V. Close enough, I guess.

So, for the Ag/AgCl electrode, the reaction is AgCl(s) + e^- → Ag(s) + Cl^- (aq). The standard potential E° is -0.799 V.

Now, regarding the solution: it's 1M KCl. So the chloride ion concentration is 1 M. Since AgCl is a solid, its solubility doesn't affect the potential beyond its Ksp. But wait, the chloride comes from KCl, so [Cl^-] = 1 M.

The formula for the electrode potential is E = E° + (RT/nF) ln(Q), but wait, I'm a bit confused about the formula's sign and the actual calculation. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Nernst equation.

The Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q (if using base 10 logs), but wait, sometimes I've seen it in terms of base 10 using log and base e using ln. Alternatively, the equation is E = E° + (0.0592 / n) * log(1/[Cl^-]) or something similar, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me get this right.

The reaction for the electrode is AgCl(s) + e^- → Ag(s) + Cl^- (aq). So the reaction quotient Q for this is [Cl^-]/(1), because the products are Ag(s) and Cl^-; the other reactants are solid, so they don't appear in Q. But wait, no, because Ag(s) and Cl^- are the products. So Q would be 1/(1) because the solids don't affect the Q.

Wait, no. The Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log (Q), where Q is the reaction quotient based on the cell as written. But wait, the reaction is AgCl(s) → Ag(s) + Cl^- (aq). That's a reverse of the standard Ag+ + e^- → Ag(s) reaction. Because the standard reaction is Ag+ + e^- → Ag(s), which is a reduction. The reverse is oxidation: Ag(s) → Ag+ + e^-, E° would be -0.80 V.

So the cell reaction is the reverse of the standard Ag reaction, so the cell E is -0.80 V (the standard for the Ag/AgCl half-cell). But wait, the question gives the oxidation potential as -0.799 V. Hmm, but perhaps E° for the Ag/AgCl half-cell is -0.799 V.

So the cell potential E is determined by the difference between the two electrodes. Since it's a single electrode, perhaps the other is a reference (like SHE, silver). Wait, the standard electrode is the AgCl electrode. So, to find the cell potential, perhaps we compare it to the standard reference.

Wait, wait, no. The problem states that the AgCl is a solid, so the potential is determined relative to the reference (like the standard hydrogen electrode). Alternatively, perhaps it's a concentration cell. Let me think again.

Wait, the given half-reaction is AgCl(s) → Ag(s) + Cl^- (aq). So, the reaction quotient Q is [Cl^-].

Wait, the Nernst equation: E = E° + (0.0592/n) * log(1/Q). Or wait, let me get the signs right. The solid reaction is AgCl(s) + e^- → Ag(s) + Cl^-(aq). So the reaction quotient Q is [Cl^-].

The Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q). Because for the reaction as written, the products are Cl^- (aq), so it's [Cl^-] in the numerator. Wait, no, the general form is Q = (products)/(reactants), but in the reaction as written, the reactants are Cl^- and AgCl(s); the products are Ag(s) and Cl^- (aq). So the Q is [Cl^-]/(1), because the solid AgCl and Ag(s) are in the denominator.

Wait, no, the formula for Q is based on the reaction as written. So the reaction is AgCl(s) + e^- → Ag(s) + Cl^-(aq). The products are Ag and Cl^-, the reactants are AgCl and e^-.

So Q = [Cl^-]/[AgCl][e^-]. Since AgCl(s) and Ag(s) are solids, their activities are 1. So Q = 1/(1 * 1) = 1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because then E would be E°, which is -0.799 V. But wait, that can't be because the Cl^- is involved. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should write the half-reaction as AgCl(s) + e^- → Ag(s) + Cl^- (aq). So the cell reaction is written as such. The standard E° for this half-reaction (AgCl) is the oxidation potential, which is -0.799 V? Or is it the reduction potential?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The standard reduction potential for Ag+ + e^- → Ag(s) is 0.80 V. So the oxidation potential (reverse) is -0.80 V. But the question says the standard oxidation potential is -0.799 V. Hmm, so perhaps the given value is more precise, like -0.7990 V.

So the cell potential E (for the Ag/AgCl electrode) is E° (Ag/AgCl) - E° (SHE). Wait, but the SHE (standard hydrogen electrode) is E°=0 V. So the cell potential is E° (Ag/AgCl), which is -0.799 V.

But wait, the cell is made up of the AgCl electrode and another reference. Since the Ag/AgCl is the only electrode, perhaps it's being compared to the reference (like the SHE) which is 0 V.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because the AgCl electrode has a certain potential, and since it's the only electrode, perhaps the potential is measured as E = E° (AgCl) - E° (SHE). So E would be -0.799 V minus 0 V, which is -0.799 V. But wait, that would make the answer option C, which is -0.799 V.

But the options don't have that. Wait, looking back: the options are:

A:0.576, B:0.344, C:-0.799, D:-0.344, E:0.799, F:-1.223, G:1.022, H:-0.576, I:-0.223, J:0.223.

So option C is -0.799 V, which matches my initial thought. But wait, the solution is 1M KCl, so the concentration of Cl^- is 1 M. So in the Nernst equation, Q = [Cl^-] = 1. So the log of 1 is 0. So E = E° (Ag/AgCl) - E° (SHE).

Wait, wait, no. The Nernst equation when the reaction is AgCl(s) → Ag(s) + Cl^- (aq) would have Q = [Cl^-]/(1) = 1. So log Q = 0. Hence, E = E°, which is -0.799 V.

But wait, that can't be right, because the presence of Cl^- should affect the potential. Because in the solution, the Cl^- is present, so the electrode potential should change.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible answers. Another approach: the standard potential for Ag/AgCl is -0.799 V (as given). The solution has Cl^- at 1 M, so the potential should change.

Wait, but according to the Nernst equation, the potential is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log Q.

But for the reaction AgCl(s) + e^- → Ag(s) + Cl^- (aq), the Q = [Cl^-]/(1) = 1. So log Q = 0. So E = E°, which is -0.799 V. So the answer would be C.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought that perhaps the cell's actual potential would be lower than the standard, but in this case, since E° is negative, and the solution's Cl^- concentration is 1 M, it's not changing the E. So the potential remains the same as the standard.

Wait, but wait, the Cl^- in solution would influence the potential. Because when the solution is 1 M Cl^-, the potential is E = E° + (0.0592/n) * log (1/([Cl^-] )).

Wait, perhaps that's a better approach. Let me think again. The correct way to apply Nernst is to write the reaction as written, and then plug the [Cl^-] into the formula.

So, the cell reaction is AgCl(s) + e^- → Ag(s) + Cl^- (aq). The Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log( [Cl^-]/(1) ), since Q is [Cl^-]/(1). So:

E = E° - (0.0592/1) * log(1) → E = E°.

Because log(1) is 0. So E is -0.799 V.

So according to this, the correct answer would be C: -0.799 V.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought that the presence of Cl^- should lower the potential. Wait, no, because the reaction is AgCl(s) + e^- → Ag(s) + Cl^-(aq). So the potential is determined by the concentration of Cl^-.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me recall the Nernst equation correctly: E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q). Or is it E = E° + (0.0592/n) * log(1/Q)?

Wait, another approach: the standard cell potential is E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode. But in this case, the AgCl is the anode (oxidation) and the SHE is the cathode. So E°cell is -0.799 V, which is the potential.

But the solution has a concentration of Cl^- which affects the E. So the cell potential would be E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log( [Cl^-] ).

Wait, that's another way. Let me get this right. The Nernst equation for the cell is E = E°cell - (0.0592/n) * log(Q). Which comes from the reaction as written.

Wait, but the reaction as written is AgCl(s) + e^- → Ag(s) + Cl^- (aq). So the Q is [Cl^-]/(1) = 1.

So the log is zero, so E = E°cell. So E°cell is -0.799 V. So the electrode potential is -0.799 V. So the correct answer is C.

But wait, the options don't have C as the answer. No, looking at the options, option C is -0.799 V, which is present. So the answer is C.

Wait, but wait. What's the definition of the electrode potential? It's the E when the solution is at a certain concentration. So if the solution is 1M Cl^-, then the E is E° - (0.0592/1) * log(1) → E°. So E = -0.799 V.

So the answer is C.

To calculate the electrode potential \( E \) for the silver-silver chloride electrode immersed in 1M KCl, we use the Nernst equation. The standard oxidation potential for the Ag/AgCl half-reaction is given as \( -0.799 \, \text{V} \). The reaction at the electrode is:

\[
\text{AgCl(s)} + e^- \rightarrow \text{Ag(s)} + \text{Cl}^-(\text{aq})
\]

The Nernst equation is:

\[
E = E^\circ - \frac{0.0592}{n} \log Q
\]

For this reaction, \( Q \) is the reaction quotient, which is:

\[
Q = \frac{[\text{Cl}^-]}{1} = 1
\]

Since \( \log(1) = 0 \), the Nernst equation simplifies to:

\[
E = E^\circ
\]

The standard electrode potential \( E^\circ \) for the Ag/AgCl half-reaction is \( -0.799 \, \text{V} \). Therefore, the electrode potential for the Ag/AgCl electrode in 1M KCl is:

\[
E = -0.799 \, \text{V}
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is \( -0.799 \, \text{V} \), which corresponds to option C.
