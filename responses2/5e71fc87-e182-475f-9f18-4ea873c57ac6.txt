Question:

What is meant by the term ''hypothesis testing''?

Options:

A: Hypothesis testing is the method of confirming the truth of a theory by comparing its predictions with empirical data
B: It involves making predictions about future outcomes based on historical data
C: Hypothesis testing is the process of testing a claim or assertion about a population, based on a sample of data from the population.
D: It is the process of determining the validity of a statistical model
E: It is the process of taking a sample from a population
F: It is the process of making assumptions about a population
G: It is the act of creating a theoretical framework to explain observed phenomena in a population
H: It is the process of calculating the probability of an event occurring within a population
I: It is the process of establishing the cause and effect relationships in a population
J: It is the technique of verifying the consistency of a dataset with another dataset

Okay, so I have to figure out what hypothesis testing means. Hmm, I remember from my statistics class that hypothesis testing is a method used to make decisions about a population based on sample data. Let me think more about it.

So, the term "hypothesis testing" sounds like it's about testing a hypothesis. Hypotheses are statements or claims about a population. For example, something like "the average height of men is 180 cm." But wait, I think hypothesis testing is more than just stating a hypothesis. It's a process where you test whether that hypothesis is supported by the data.

Looking at the options, option C says it's the process of testing a claim or assertion about a population based on a sample. That makes sense because hypothesis testing starts with a claim or a statement, and then you use data (a sample) to evaluate if that claim is likely true.

Option A says it's the method of confirming the truth of a theory by comparing predictions with data. I'm a bit confused because sometimes I think hypothesis testing is more about rejecting the null hypothesis, not confirming the theory. Maybe A is also correct, but I'm not sure.

Option B talks about future outcomes based on historical data. That sounds more like something else, like a confidence interval or prediction, but not hypothesis testing.

Option D is about determining the validity of a statistical model. That's more about whether the model fits the data, not testing a specific hypothesis.

Option E is about taking a sample. That's part of the process, but hypothesis testing isn't just about sampling. It's more about the method of testing.

Option F suggests making assumptions about a population. That's similar to the hypothesis itself. Hypothesis testing is about formulating and testing such assumptions.

Option G says it's the act of creating a theoretical framework. Wait, that's more like the process of developing a model, not necessarily testing it statistically.

Option I is about establishing cause and effect. That's more of an experimental approach, not hypothesis testing, which is more about statistical significance.

Option J is about verifying consistency with another dataset. That seems more like data cleaning or consistency checks, not hypothesis testing.

So, reviewing, option C is about testing a claim using a sample. That seems to fit the definition. Option A is a bit ambiguous, but I think it's more about what you do after the hypothesis is formed. Wait, the way the options are phrased, option C is the process, and option A is a method used after the process.

The question is asking what hypothesis testing is. So, the definition is the process of testing a claim. So, the correct answer must be option C.

The correct answer is **C: Hypothesis testing is the process of testing a claim or assertion about a population, based on a sample of data from the population.**

**Answer: C**
