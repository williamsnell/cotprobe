Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the beginning of the Babylonian captive called "Exile." Hmm, I'm not too familiar with the details, but I remember hearing about it in history class. Let me think through this.

First, the question asks when the Babylonian captive of "Exile" began. The options are from BCE (Before the Common Era) to CE (Common Era) up to 1914 CE. I'm trying to recall the timeline here.

I think the "Exile" refers to a group of Babylonian prisoners. I remember that in some historical contexts, like the Persian Empire, the Persian captive group was called "Exile." They were captured in the 16th century BCE, right? So maybe that's when it started.

Wait, I think the actual capture was in 333 BCE. That's when they were captured. But wait, the question is about when the captive began. So if they were captured and then sent to Babylon, maybe the capture is considered the start. Alternatively, perhaps the captive began during their capture.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the capture dates. Let me think again. The Persian captive group was captured during the Persian Wars, around 333 BCE. Then, they were sent to Babylon for execution. So the start of the captive would be their capture, which was in 333 BCE.

Looking at the options, option B is 1066 CE, which is way after 333 BCE. Option F is 1492 CE, also later. Option G is 586 BCE, which is earlier than 333 BCE. Option H is 722 BCE, which is even earlier. Option I is 70 CE, and J is 70 BCE. Those are way in the future.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The captives were captured in 333 BCE, right? So the start would be 333 BCE, which isn't an option. Looking at the options again, the closest is H (70 BCE) and G (586 BCE), which are earlier. Wait, no, 586 is much earlier than 333. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the captives were captured in 333 BCE, but then they were taken to Babylon. So the start of the captive is 333 BCE. But that's not an option. Let me re-examine the options.

The options are:

A: 333 BCE
B: 1066 CE
C: 535 BCE
D: 515 BCE
E: 1914 CE
F: 1492 CE
G: 586 BCE
H: 722 BCE
I: 70 CE
J: 70 BCE

So the only option close to 333 BCE is H (70 BCE), but that's 263 BCE earlier. That doesn't seem right. Did I get the capture date wrong?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the capture was during a different time. Oh, wait, maybe the captives began their execution around 333 BCE. So the capture is when they were taken to Babylon. So the start is the capture, which is 333 BCE. But that's not an option. So perhaps the answer is the capture, which is 333 BCE. But that's not listed, so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the term "Exile." Maybe it refers to a specific event in their execution. Alternatively, perhaps the captives began their execution in 64 BCE, but that's not one of the options either.

Wait, let me think again. I remember that the Persian captive group was captured in 333 BCE by the Persians. So the capture was 333 BCE. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is about the start of their execution, which was around 333 BCE as well.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are 333 BCE. So perhaps the question is about the start of the captive being their capture, which is 333 BCE, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the execution, which also started in 333 BCE.

Wait, maybe the options are wrong, but I must proceed. Let me check each option.

The options are:

A:333 BCE

B:1066 CE

C:535 BCE

D:515 BCE

E:1914 CE

F:1492 CE

G:586 BCE

H:722 BCE

I:70 CE

J:70 BCE

So the only option close to 333 BCE is A, but that's at 333 BCE. Since none of the options are 333 BCE, maybe the question is referring to the capture, which is 333 BCE, but the option is A. So I think the answer is A: 333 BCE.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the capture was in 333 BCE, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different timeline. Let me think about other sources.

Wait, another angle: The Babylonian captive of "Exile" refers to the Persian captive group. They were captured in 333 BCE by the Persians. Then, they were taken to Babylon for execution. So the start of their execution is 333 BCE.

But if none of the options are that, perhaps the question is referring to when they began their execution, which is 333 BCE. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the capture dates. Let me check. Oh wait, I think the capture was in 333 BCE. So the correct answer would be A: 333 BCE.

Therefore, the answer should be option A.
