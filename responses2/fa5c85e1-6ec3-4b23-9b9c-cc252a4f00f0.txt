Okay, so I have this problem here about a rectangle where the length is twice its width, and the diagonal is 5√5. I need to find the area. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a rectangle, the diagonal forms a right triangle with the length and the width. So, I can use the Pythagorean theorem here. The theorem states that for a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (length and width).

Let me assign variables to make it easier. Let's denote the width as 'w'. Since the length is twice the width, the length would be '2w'. 

So, according to the Pythagorean theorem:
length² + width² = diagonal²
Substituting the known values:
(2w)² + w² = (5√5)²

Calculating each term:
(4w²) + w² = 25 * 5
Because (5√5) squared is 25*5 = 125.

Adding the terms on the left:
4w² + w² = 5w²
So, 5w² = 125

To find w², I divide both sides by 5:
w² = 125 / 5 = 25

Taking the square root of both sides gives w = 5. So, the width is 5 units.

Since the length is twice the width, length = 2 * 5 = 10 units.

Now, the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width. So:
Area = length * width = 10 * 5 = 50.

Looking at the options, option F is 50. So that should be the answer.

The length of the rectangle is twice its width. Let the width be \( w \), so the length is \( 2w \). Using the Pythagorean theorem for the diagonal:

\[
(2w)^2 + w^2 = (5\sqrt{5})^2
\]
\[
4w^2 + w^2 = 125
\]
\[
5w^2 = 125
\]
\[
w^2 = 25 \quad \Rightarrow \quad w = 5
\]
Length \( = 2w = 10 \).

Area \( = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \).

**Answer:** F: 50

B: 20  
C: 75  
D: 10  
E: 100  
F: 50  
G: 125  
H: 2  
I: 500  
J: 25  

The correct option is **F: 50**.

**Answer:** F
