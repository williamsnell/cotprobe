Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the hydrologic cycle and which processes involve absorbing energy. Let me think through each option.

The question is asking during which processes water molecules absorb energy. So, I need to recall what each process entails regarding energy transfer.

Option A: Water seeping into groundwater reservoirs. That's probably a movement of water through the ground, which is part of the water cycle, but I'm not sure if it's absorbing energy. I think this is more about the storage of water and not energy transfer.

Option B: Absorption of rainwater by the soil. Oh wait, that's evaporation, right? No, wait. No, evaporation is when water turns into vapor, which is a process that absorbs energy. But B is about water being absorbed by the soil, which would be the opposite. So maybe B is incorrect.

Option C: Formation of a cloud from water vapor. I think when water vapor condenses into tiny droplets, that's a process that involves energy. But wait, the question is about absorption, not release. So maybe it's the opposite. Cloud formation is part of the evaporation and condensation steps.

Option D: Formation of dew from water vapor. Dew is the phase change from water vapor to water droplets. That process involves absorbing energy, so D could be a candidate.

Option E: Water flow in rivers and streams. That's the movement of water within the body of water, which is part of the hydrograph. Not sure about energy absorption here.

Option F: Formation of snow from water vapor. Snow formation is a condensation process, which would involve absorbing energy, but wait, it's actually the release of energy. So maybe F isn't correct.

Option G: Formation of ice from water. That would involve freezing, which is a phase change that releases energy. So G is about releasing energy, not absorption.

Option H: Evaporation from the ocean surface. Evaporation is a process that absorbs a lot of energy, turning water into vapor. So H is definitely a candidate.

Option I: Evaporation from the ocean surface. Wait, same as H, so I'm thinking maybe both H and I are correct. But no, the options are separate. So they can't both be correct. Let me read the question again. The options are labeled A to J, each a separate process. So the question is which process does this, so each option is a separate choice.

Wait, the question says "during which of the following processes" â€” so it's asking for one correct choice. So I need to see which of the options (A to J) represents a process that absorbs energy.

Wait, the question is about which process involves absorbing energy. So I have to identify each option and see which processes involve energy absorption.

Option B: Absorption of rainwater by the soil. Hmm, that's not correct. When rainwater is absorbed by the soil, it's through interception, evapotranspiration, and percolation, etc. All those are processes that involve taking water from the sky and putting it into the ground. So that's not about energy absorption.

Wait, maybe I need to think about each process and see what kind of energy they involve.

Option D: Formation of dew. So that's when water vapor on the surface turns into tiny water droplets in the air. That process involves absorbing energy from the surrounding air. So D is correct.

Option H: Evaporation from the ocean surface. Because evaporation is a process where water vapor is turned into liquid water, it's a process that absorbs a lot of energy. So H is correct.

Wait, the question is about which process involves absorbing energy. So both D and H are correct processes that involve energy absorption.

But looking at the options, each is a separate choice. So the question is, which of the options (from A to J) represents a process that absorbs energy. So perhaps both D and H are correct?

Wait, but I need to check whether the question is about which process occurs during which of these. The options are A through J, each a separate process.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The question is: which process involves absorbing energy.

So, processes that involve absorbing energy are those where the system gains energy, such as evaporation, cloud formation (some), etc.

Wait, so looking back at the options:

Option D: Formation of dew (absorbing energy).

Option H: Evaporation from the ocean surface (absorbing energy).

So both D and H are processes that involve absorbing energy.

Wait, but looking at the options for the question again, the options are individual processes, not multiple. So the question is asking which of these processes (A to J) is about absorbing energy.

So, for each option, I need to determine if the process involves energy absorption.

Let me go through each:

A: Water seeping into groundwater. Probably part of the water cycle, but no energy transfer. So no.

B: Absorbing rainwater by the soil. No, that's about taking water from the sky and putting it into the ground, so it's part of water movement, not energy.

C: Formation of a cloud from water vapor. That's condensation, which involves releasing energy (as it goes from vapor to droplets). So this is release of energy, not absorption.

D: Absorbing rainwater by the soil. No, this is about taking water from the sky and putting it into the soil, so it's part of the water cycle but not energy absorption.

E: Water flow in rivers and streams. This is about the movement of water, so no energy.

F: Formation of snow from water vapor. That's condensation, which releases energy.

G: Formation of ice from water. Freezing releases energy.

H: Evaporation from the ocean surface. Evaporation is a process that involves absorbing a lot of energy because it's taking water vapor and turning it into liquid. So this is a correct process.

I: Evaporation from the ocean surface. Same as H.

J: Formation of fog from water vapor. That's another phase change, freezing, which releases energy.

So the question is which process involves absorbing energy. So H and I are both correct, but they are the same process and perhaps are listed as separate options. But the options are A to J, each a separate choice.

Wait, the options are A: water seeping into reservoirs. B: rainwater in soil. C: cloud formation. D: dew. E: river flow. F: snow. G: ice. H: ocean evaporation. I: same as H. J: fog.

So, H and I are the same process, but in the options, they are listed as separate. So perhaps only H is correct, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about which of the processes (A to J) involves the absorption of energy. So the correct options are processes that involve energy absorption.

So, looking back:

Only option H (evaporation) and option D (dew) involve energy absorption.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The question is about which of the processes involves absorbing energy.

Wait, when water vapor condenses into water droplets, that's a phase change from gas to liquid. That's condensation, which releases energy. So options F and J (formation of snow and fog) involve release of energy, not absorption.

So the correct processes for absorption are D (dew) and H (evaporation).

Wait, but looking at the options, each is a separate choice. So the question is asking which process (among A to J) involves absorbing energy.

So, which of these options (A-L) represents an energy-absorbing process.

So, the correct options would be H and D, but in the question, each option is a separate choice, so the correct answer should be either D or H.

Wait, but let me check each option:

Option D: Absorption of rainwater by the soil. No, that's about water moving from the sky to the ground, not energy.

Option H: Evaporation from the ocean surface. Yes, this involves absorbing energy.

Option D: Absorption, yes.

Wait, the question is, which process involves absorbing energy. So the correct options would be D and H.

Wait, but looking at the possible answers, the options are provided as A to J, each a single choice. So the question is, which of the following processes does this happen?

So, the correct process is either H or D.

Wait, but in the options, D is about the absorption of rainwater by the soil, which is not about energy. So, only H is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The question is, which process involves absorbing energy.

So, processes that involve absorbing energy are evaporation (H) and the formation of water droplets from vapor (which would be D). Wait, no, D is the absorption of rainwater into the soil.

Wait, no, D is about the absorption of rainwater by the soil. So that's the opposite.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: think which processes require energy to occur.

When water goes into the atmosphere, evaporation (H) requires energy in the form of solar radiation.

When water vapor condenses into droplets, that's release of energy.

When water is absorbed by roots in the soil, that's energy absorption. So that's D.

Wait, so D is about the absorption of rainwater into the soil. So that's right, that's an absorption.

So, the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait, I thought evaporation is about absorbing energy. So, the correct answer would be H and D. But let me check again.

The options are A to J.

Each is a process. So, which process involves absorbing energy.

So, the correct options are H and D.

Wait, but the question is which option (A-J) is correct. So the question is, which of the processes (A to J) involves energy absorption.

So, for example, D is a process that involves absorbing energy. H is a process that involves absorbing energy.

So both D and H are correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, each is a separate option. So in the options, both D and H are present.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice question, so only one option is correct. So which one is it?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H and D. But looking back, the options:

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D and H. But in the question, the options are A to J, each being a single process.

Wait, but the question is asking which process involves absorbing energy. So among the options, which of the following processes (A to J) is about energy absorption.

So, both D and H are correct, but the question only allows one correct answer.

Wait, but looking at the possible options, I think the correct answer is H and D are both correct processes that involve energy absorption. But in the given options, each is a separate choice, so the question is which is among A to J.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit tricky. Let me think again.

The question is which process involves absorbing energy.

So, the correct options would be:

- H: Evaporation from the ocean surface. That's a known process that absorbs a lot of energy.

- D: Absorption of rainwater by the soil. That's a process where water is taken from the sky and held in the soil, which requires energy.

So both H and D are correct. But the options are from A to J, each a separate process. So the question is which one of the options (A to J) is correct.

But the question has to choose one, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in the question, the correct answer is D and H, but only one is in the options. Wait, looking back, the question lists each option as a process, and the answer is to pick one.

Wait, the available options are A) to J), each a single process.

So, the correct processes are H (evaporation) and D (dew). So in the options, both are present. But the question is asking which process (from A to J) involves absorbing energy.

Wait, perhaps only H is correct. Because D is about absorption of rainwater into the soil, which is not about absorbing energy but about taking water from the sky. So D is about water being absorbed by the soil, leading to water in the soil, not energy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about which processes involve energy.

When water vapor condenses into water droplets, this is a phase change from gas to liquid. The energy is released. So that's not absorption.

When water is absorbed into the soil, it's taking energy from the environment. So that's absorption. So D is correct.

When water evaporates, it's taking a lot of energy from the system. So H is correct.

So the correct answers are D and H. But in the options provided, each is a separate choice. So the question is asking which of the options (from A to J) is correct.

Wait, the question is, "during which of the following processes within the hydrologic cycle do water molecules absorb energy?"

So, the correct processes are D and H. But looking at the options, each is a separate choice, so the correct answer would be either D or H.

But the question is a single-answer multiple-choice, so perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both D and H, but the options don't allow that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the processes that involve energy absorption during the hydrological cycle.

So, the correct options are D and H.

But wait, I'm not certain. Let me think of the options.

Another approach: Which of these processes involve absorbing, not releasing, energy.

So, evaporation (H) involves absorbing, condensation (F, J) releases.

So, among the options, H and D are correct.

But the question is asking for which process (from A to J) involves absorbing energy.

So both D and H are correct. But the question only allows one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about each option again.

Option D: Absorption of rainwater by the soil. Wait, that's the process of interception and storage. So water is being stored, not being taken from the sky. So that's not about energy absorption but about water storage.

Thus, D is not about energy.

So, only H is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that evaporation (H) is correct.

So, the correct answer is H.

Because D is about water storage, so no energy transfer.

So, the correct answer is H.

To determine during which processes within the hydrologic cycle water molecules absorb energy, we analyze each option:

- **A: Water seeping into groundwater reservoirs**  
  This is part of the water cycle but does not involve energy transfer.  

- **B: Absorption of rainwater by the soil**  
  This involves water being stored in the soil, not energy transfer.  

- **C: Formation of a cloud from water vapor**  
  This involves condensation, which releases energy, so it is not an absorption process.  

- **D: Formation of dew from water vapor**  
  This is water vapor condensing into water droplets, which releases energy, not absorption.  

- **E: Water flow in rivers and streams**  
  This is part of the water cycle but does not involve energy transfer.  

- **F: Formation of snow from water vapor**  
  This involves condensation, releasing energy, not absorption.  

- **G: Formation of ice from water**  
  Freezing releases energy, not absorption.  

- **H: Evaporation from the ocean surface**  
  Evaporation is a process that absorbs a large amount of energy from the surroundings, converting water vapor into liquid. This is a correct process.  

- **I: Evaporation from the ocean surface**  
  This is the same as option H, so it is also correct.  

- **J: Formation of fog from water vapor**  
  This involves freezing, which releases energy, not absorption.  

The question asks for a single process that involves absorbing energy. While both options H and I are correct, they are the same process and likely listed separately. However, the question specifies a single answer, so the correct choice is **H: Evaporation from the ocean surface**, as it is a well-known process involving energy absorption.

ANSWER: H
