Okay, so I've got this question here about enzyme efficiency in an experiment. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about which protocol would not change the enzyme's efficiency. Let me try to understand each option.

The enzyme's efficiency is about how well it converts substrate into product, right? So factors that affect efficiency would influence how quickly or effectively the enzyme works.

Option A: Bringing the temperature from 20 to 50°C. Temperature affects enzyme activity. I remember that higher temperatures can sometimes denature enzymes, but if the enzyme is already active at 50°C, maybe it's still working. But wait, sometimes higher temps can speed things up, but if the enzyme's activity is already optimal, maybe it doesn't change efficiency. But I'm not sure if temperature change would cause a change. Hmm, I think in this context, the answer is that temperature might affect enzyme activity, but maybe it's a factor. Or perhaps it's a distractor. I'll come back to this.

Option B: Adding an acidic solution. Oh, right! I remember that some enzymes are sensitive to pH changes. Like, for example, some beta-galactosidase is used in the human body and can be affected by pH. So if you add an acidic solution, it might denature the enzyme or change its activity. That would definitely affect efficiency. So this option would change efficiency, so it's not the correct answer.

Option C: Adding substrate but not enzyme. Wait, but the setup has both. Oh, wait, wait. Oh, wait, no. The question says the setup has both. So if you add substrate but not enzyme, that doesn't make sense. Because the enzyme is in the setup. Unless I'm misunderstanding. Oh, perhaps, the setup has both, but in this option, they're adding the substrate but not the enzyme. That doesn't make much sense because the setup already must have the enzyme. Or wait, perhaps the setup is in a container and you add the substrate but not the enzyme. But that would mean the enzyme isn't present in the setup anymore, which probably isn't the case. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps this is a trick. Wait, no, the question says the setup has the enzyme. So if you add substrate but not the enzyme, that would mean the enzyme isn't in the setup anymore. Wait, but then the enzyme wouldn't be acting. So the setup has the substrate but not the enzyme. That seems odd because the enzyme is part of the setup. So this scenario might not be possible. Wait, or perhaps the setup is containing both. So adding the substrate but not the enzyme would mean the enzyme isn't there. So the enzyme isn't in the actual experiment, which would mean it wouldn't work. But that's not a change in the enzyme's efficiency. Because the enzyme's efficiency depends on its presence and activity. So in that case, the protocol wouldn't change efficiency. Wait, but the setup is already the correct setup. So if the enzyme is missing, then efficiency would be zero. But this is about whether the protocol would change the enzyme's efficiency. So if the enzyme isn't present, the enzyme's efficiency is zero. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the setup includes both. So if the setup doesn't have the enzyme, then the efficiency is zero. But in the protocol, you add the substrate but not the enzyme. So in that case, the enzyme isn't there, so the efficiency is zero. But does that change it? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the setup already has the enzyme. So adding the substrate but not the enzyme might mean the enzyme isn't present. But that's a bit contradictory. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let's move on for now.

Option D: Placing in a container with double capacity. Oh, so increasing the volume. I remember that increasing the volume can affect concentration, which affects enzyme activity. So if the setup is made bigger, the substrate concentration might increase. If the enzyme is efficient, more substrate per enzyme might mean more activity. But if the volume is increased, and the setup (including enzyme and substrate) is also doubled, then the concentration of substrate is halved. If the enzyme is efficient, the product would also increase, but the reaction rate (efficiency) would depend on how much substrate is present. Wait, but if the setup is made two times larger, then the enzyme's concentration is doubled. But the substrate is also doubled. So the substrate concentration is also doubled. Wait, no, wait. Let's say the initial setup has V volume, and the enzyme concentration is C. If you double V, the new volume is 2V, and the enzyme concentration becomes 2C. But if the substrate is also doubled, then the substrate concentration is 2S (if original was S). So if the enzyme is active, with higher substrate, the reaction would proceed faster. So the efficiency (enzyme activity) would increase because more enzyme is present relative to substrate. 

Wait, but the question is about the protocol that wouldn't change efficiency. So option D would change efficiency, so it's not the correct answer.

So looking back, the question is about which protocol would not change the enzyme's efficiency. So the options that affect enzyme efficiency are A, B, D. Option C, adding substrate without enzyme—does that mean the enzyme isn't there? Or perhaps, the setup already has the enzyme. So if you add substrate but not enzyme, the setup would have only substrate. So the enzyme would be absent. Then, the efficiency would be zero. So in this case, the enzyme's efficiency is zero. Wait, but if the enzyme isn't present, then no reaction occurs. So the enzyme's efficiency is zero. So the protocol would not change the enzyme's efficiency because the enzyme isn't there. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but in the context of enzyme testing, the setup probably includes both enzyme and substrate. So when you add the substrate but not the enzyme, that's a mistake in the setup. But in the question, the options are about protocols that wouldn't change efficiency. So the setup already has the enzyme. So adding the substrate but not the enzyme would mean the enzyme isn't present. So the enzyme's presence is the only factor, so the efficiency would be zero. So the protocol wouldn't change the efficiency because the enzyme isn't present. But I'm not sure if that's considered a change. Alternatively, maybe the enzyme is present but not functional, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, another approach: the enzyme's efficiency is affected by its structure, substrate availability, temperature, pH, etc. So any of these factors would change the efficiency.

Option C: Adding substrate but not enzyme. If the setup already has the enzyme, and you add substrate but not the enzyme, that's a mistake in the setup but from the protocol's perspective, the enzyme is still present. So the setup would have the enzyme, but no enzyme. So in that case, the answer is that the enzyme isn't present, so the efficiency is zero. But is the setup correctly including the enzyme? Or is this a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup only includes the substrate. But that's not the case here. So the question is, which protocol would not change the enzyme's efficiency. So when you add substrate without the enzyme, that would mean the enzyme isn't present. But the enzyme's efficiency is determined by its activity, which depends on the substrate and, perhaps, the presence of other factors. So in this case, the setup doesn't have the enzyme, efficiency is zero. But the question is about which protocol wouldn't change the enzyme's efficiency. If the enzyme isn't present, the efficiency is zero. So the setup isn't correct, but the question is about protocols. So if the setup is modified to have only substrate, the enzyme's presence is gone. So the enzyme's efficiency is zero. So the protocol doesn't change the enzyme's efficiency because it's absent.

Wait, but the question is about a protocol that wouldn't change efficiency. So the correct answer is option C. Because in that case, the actual enzyme is not present. So the enzyme's efficiency is zero, regardless of other factors. So the result is no change in efficiency.

Wait, but wait. The options are about the protocols. Let me think about the question again. The question is, which protocol would probably not result in a change in the enzyme's efficiency.

If the option is adding substrate but not the enzyme, the enzyme isn't present. So the setup doesn't have the enzyme, so the enzyme's efficiency is zero. So the protocol doesn't change the enzyme's efficiency because it's not present. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is not the case. Let's think about the others.

Option A: Bringing the temperature up. If the enzyme's activity is dependent on temperature, then changing the temperature could affect its efficiency. But in some cases, higher temps can sometimes reduce activity. But if the enzyme is already active at 50°C, increasing to 70°C might slow it down. So this could change the enzyme's efficiency. So option A is a possibility, so it would change efficiency, so it's not the correct answer.

Option B: Adding an acidic solution. This would affect the enzyme's activity, so it would change efficiency. So not the answer.

Option D: Doubling the container size. That would increase the substrate concentration. If the enzyme is efficient, more substrate per enzyme would mean more activity. So efficiency (product formation) would increase. So D changes efficiency.

So the only option that doesn't change the enzyme's efficiency is option C, because the enzyme isn't present. So the setup doesn't have the enzyme. So the answer is C.

Wait, but the setup already has the enzyme. So adding substrate without the enzyme would mean the enzyme isn't present. So the setup is incorrect, but the protocol is to add the substrate. So in this case, the enzyme isn't there, efficiency is zero. So the protocol doesn't change the enzyme's efficiency, because it's absent. So the correct answer is option C.

To determine which protocol would not result in a change in the enzyme’s efficiency, let’s analyze each option:

### Option A: Bringing the temperature of the experimental setup from 20°C to 50°C  
Temperature can affect enzyme activity. Higher temperatures might denature or reduce enzyme activity, especially if the enzyme is already active at 50°C. Therefore, this could change the enzyme’s efficiency. **This is not the correct answer.**

### Option B: Adding an acidic solution to the setup  
Some enzymes are pH-sensitive and can be affected by acidic conditions. For example, beta-galactosidase or other beta-actin-like enzymes are sensitive to pH changes. Adding an acidic solution could alter enzyme activity, thereby changing efficiency. **This is not the correct answer.**

### Option C: Adding substrate but not enzyme  
The setup already contains the enzyme, so adding substrate without the enzyme would mean the enzyme is absent from the experiment. Since enzyme efficiency depends on its presence and activity, the absence of the enzyme would result in zero efficiency. This does not change the enzyme’s efficiency. **This is the correct answer.**

### Option D: Placing the substrate and enzyme in a container with double the capacity  
Increasing the container volume could affect substrate concentration, which might influence enzyme activity. However, if the setup is already designed to include both substrate and enzyme, doubling the volume would likely increase substrate concentration. For efficient enzymes, increased substrate concentration could enhance activity, thereby changing efficiency. **This is not the correct answer.**

### Conclusion  
The only protocol that does not change the enzyme’s efficiency is the addition of substrate without the enzyme, as the enzyme is absent and efficiency is zero.
