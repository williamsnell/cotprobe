Okay, so I have this problem where Sam bought 18 stamps for $8.28, and I need to find out how much 12 stamps would cost at the same rate. Hmm, let's see.

First, I think I should find the cost per stamp. Since 18 stamps cost $8.28, I can divide the total cost by the number of stamps to get the unit cost. So, 8.28 divided by 18. Let me calculate that. 

Wait, 18 times 4 is 72, which is less than 828. Maybe I should write it as 828 divided by 18. Let me do that division. 18 goes into 828 how many times? 18 times 45 is 810, so subtracting that from 828 leaves 18. So that's 45.53? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 18 times 45 is 810, and 828 minus 810 is 18, so that's 45 with a remainder of 18. So 18 divided by 18 is 1. So total is 45 +1 =46. So the cost per stamp is $46? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 18 times 46 is 828, right? Yeah, because 18*40 is 720, 18*6 is 108, so 720+108=828. So yes, each stamp is $46? Wait, that seems high. Wait, wait, wait, no, no. Wait, 18 stamps cost 8.28, so 8.28 divided by 18 is the price per stamp. Let me compute that again. 18 goes into 8.28 how many times? Let's see. 18*0.46 is 8.28. Because 18*0.4 is 7.2, and 18*0.06 is 1.08. Adding them gives 8.28. Oh, right, so each stamp is $0.46. Wait, that's a lot of cents per stamp. But okay, let's proceed.

Now, if each stamp is $0.46, then 12 stamps would cost 12 * 0.46. Let me calculate that. 10*0.46 is 4.60, plus 2*0.46 is 0.92. So 4.60 + 0.92 equals 5.52. So the total cost for 12 stamps would be $5.52. Looking at the options, option C is $5.52. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but why am I getting confused? Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me double-check. 8.28 divided by 18: 18 times 46 is 828 (since 18*40=720, 18*6=108; 720+108=828). So 8.28 รท18 = 0.46. Yes, correct. So 0.46 per stamp. 12 stamps: 12 * 0.46. 12 times 0.4 is 4.8, and 12 times 0.06 is 0.72. 4.8 + 0.72=5.52. So that's correct. So the answer is C.

The correct answer is C: $5.52.

Steps:
1. Calculate cost per stamp: $8.28 รท 18 = $0.46 per stamp.
2. Multiply by 12: 12 ร $0.46 = $5.52.

Answer: C
