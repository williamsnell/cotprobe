Okay, so I've got this problem here where a team of volunteers sold T-shirts for a charity concert, and I need to figure out how many T-shirts they sold in total. Let me break it down step by step.

The problem says they collected a total of $5,144 by selling T-shirts. Each T-shirt was sold for $8. So, I think I need to calculate how many T-shirts were sold by dividing the total amount made by the price per T-shirt.

So, the formula would be: Total T-shirts = Total money made / Price per T-shirt. Plugging in the numbers, that's 5144 divided by 8.

Hmm, let me do the division. 8 goes into 51 how many times? Let's see, 8*6=48, which is less than 51. Then 8*7=56, which is too big. So 6 times. Subtract 48 from 51, that leaves 3. Bring down the 4 to make 34. How many times does 8 go into 34? Well, 8*4=32, which is less than 34. 8*5=40 is too big. So 4 times. Subtract 32 from 34, that leaves 2. Bring down the 4 to make 24. 8 goes into 24 exactly 3 times. So the total is 643.

Wait, let me double-check: 8 times 643 equals 5144? Let me multiply 8 by 600: that's 4800. 8*40 is 320, so 4800+320=5120. Then 8*3=24, so 5120+24=5144. Yep, that adds up.

Looking at the options, option F is 643. So that's the answer.
