Okay, so I have this problem to solve: I need to find the curl of a vector field at the point (1, -2, 1). The vector field is given as a = x²y²i + 2xyzj + z²k. Hmm, curl. I remember curl is a measure of rotation or circulation density in a vector field. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me think.

First, I recall that the curl of a vector field F = P i + Q j + R k is calculated using the cross product of the del operator with F. The formula is curl F = ∇ × F. The curl should be another vector, and its components can be found using the determinant of a matrix with partial derivatives.

Wait, the curl formula in terms of components is something like:

curl F = ( ∂R/∂y - ∂Q/∂z ) i + ( ∂P/∂z - ∂R/∂x ) j + ( ∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y ) k.

Right, so I need to compute each of these partial derivatives.

Let me write down each component:

1. The i-component: ∂R/∂y - ∂Q/∂z
2. The j-component: ∂P/∂z - ∂R/∂x
3. The k-component: ∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y

Given the vector field a = x²y²i + 2xyzj + z²k, let's identify P, Q, R.

P = x²y²
Q = 2xyz
R = z²

Now, compute each partial derivative.

Starting with the i-component:

∂R/∂y = ∂(z²)/∂y. Since z² doesn't depend on y, this is 0.
∂Q/∂z = ∂(2xyz)/∂z = 2xy (because y is treated as a constant when differentiating with respect to z).
So the i-component is 0 - 2xy = -2xy.

Next, the j-component:

∂P/∂z = ∂(x²y²)/∂z. Since P doesn't depend on z, this is 0.
∂R/∂x = ∂(z²)/∂x. Again, z² doesn't depend on x, so this is 0.
So the j-component is 0 - 0 = 0.

Now, the k-component:

∂Q/∂x = ∂(2xyz)/∂x = 2yz (since y and z are constants).
∂P/∂y = ∂(x²y²)/∂y = 2x²y (differentiate y squared gives 2y, multiplied by x²).
So the k-component is 2yz - 2x²y.

Putting it all together, curl a = ( -2xy )i + 0j + ( 2yz - 2x²y )k.

Simplify this expression. Let's factor out 2y where possible.

curl a = (-2xy)i + 0j + 2y(z - x²)k.

Now, the point we're evaluating at is (1, -2, 1). So x=1, y=-2, z=1.

Let me plug these values into each component.

For the i-component: (-2)(1)(-2) = (-2)*(-2) = 4.
For the j-component: 0, as we found.
For the k-component: 2*(-2)(1 - (1)^2 ) = 2*(-2)(1 -1) = 2*(-2)*(0)= 0.

So the curl at (1,-2,1) is (4, 0, 0). Wait, let me double-check the k-component calculation.

Wait, 2y(z - x²) becomes 2*(-2)(1 - 1) = 2*(-2)(0) = 0. So yes, the k-component is 0.

So the resulting vector is (4, 0, 0). Looking at the options:

Looking at the options, option D is (4, 0, 0). So the answer should be D.

To find the curl of the vector field **a** = x²y²i + 2xyzj + z²k at the point (1, -2, 1), we use the curl formula:

\[
\text{curl } \mathbf{a} = \left( \frac{\partial R}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial Q}{\partial z} \right) \mathbf{i} + \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial R}{\partial x} \right) \mathbf{j} + \left( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \right) \mathbf{k}
\]

Given:
- **a** = x²y²i + 2xyzj + z²k, so:
  - \( P = x^2 y^2 \)
  - \( Q = 2xyz \)
  - \( R = z^2 \)

Compute each component:
1. **i-component**:
\[
\frac{\partial R}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial Q}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial (z^2)}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial (2xyz)}{\partial z} = 0 - 2xy = -2xy
\]

2. **j-component**:
\[
\frac{\partial P}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial R}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial (x^2 y^2)}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial (z^2)}{\partial x} = 0 - 0 = 0
\]

3. **k-component**:
\[
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial (2xyz)}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial (x^2 y^2)}{\partial y} = 2yz - 2x^2 y
\]

Simplify the curl:
\[
\text{curl } \mathbf{a} = (-2xy) \mathbf{i} + 0 \mathbf{j} + [2y(z - x^2)] \mathbf{k}
\]

Evaluate at (1, -2, 1):
- \( x = 1 \), \( y = -2 \), \( z = 1 \)
- **i-component**: \( -2(1)(-2) = 4 \)
- **j-component**: 0
- **k-component**: \( 2(-2)(1 - 1) = 0 \)

Thus, **curl a** at (1, -2, 1) is **(4, 0, 0)**, which corresponds to option D.

**Answer: D**
