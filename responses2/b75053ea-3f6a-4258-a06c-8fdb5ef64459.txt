Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine the spacing of the (111) planes in CsBr. The given parameters are a = 7.28 Å. Hmm, wait, I remember that a in this context is the lattice parameter, which is the length of the unit cell edge. But wait, wait, in crystallography, a, b, c are the lattice parameters, right? And in a cubic system, they're all equal. Oh wait, but wait, maybe this is not a cubic crystal. Wait, the question mentions CsBr, which is a metalloid. I think for many metalloids, especially those with metals like Na, K, etc., the structure is often BCC, FCC, or something else. But wait, CsBr is actually not a metal—I think it's a metalloid. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, CsBr is Cs (cesium) and Br (bromine) combining. So Cs is a metal with a metallic structure, Br is a halogen with a molecular structure. So maybe the structure isn't cubic. Wait, but in the problem, they give a as 7.28 Å. Are they assuming this is a cubic structure? Because if it's a cubic structure, then a, b, c are the same. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to a cubic structure, assuming that a, b, c are all equal. So a = 7.28 Å is the lattice constant. 

The question is about the spacing between (111) planes. Oh, okay, that's a Miller index. The formula for the interplanar spacing in a cubic crystal is d_hkl = 1/(sqrt(h² + k² + l²)) * a * (1) — wait, no, more correctly, the formula is d = (a) / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). So for hkl = (111), the denominator is sqrt(1² +1² +1²) = sqrt(3). So d = a / sqrt(3). 

Wait, but wait a second, is this correct? Let me think. Oh right, the formula is d = (a) / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). So for (111), each index is 1, so sum is 3. So d = a / sqrt(3). So a is 7.28. So let's compute that.

So a is 7.28 Å. Let's compute d.

First, square root of 3 is approximately 1.732. So 7.28 divided by 1.732. Let me calculate that. 7.28 / 1.732. Let's see: 1.732 times 4 is about 6.928. 1.732 *4.2 = let's compute 4 *1.732=6.928, plus 0.2 *1.732=0.3464 → total 7.2744. Oh, that's close to 7.28. So 4.2 * 1.732 ≈ 7.2744, which is just a little under 7.28. So 4.2 *1.732 is 7.2744. So the actual value is a bit more than 4.2. Hmm, so 7.28 / 1.732 is approximately 4.20?

Wait, wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 7.28 / 1.732.

Well, 1.732 * 4 = 6.928.

7.28 -6.928 = 0.352.

So 0.352 / 1.732 = approximately 0.203.

So total is 4.203. So about 4.203 angstroms. So the interplanar spacing d is approximately 4.203 Å, which is about 4.20 Å.

Looking at the options, option E is 4.20°A. So that's the answer. But wait, the question says the options are each labeled with letters. So the options are A to J.

Wait, the answer I calculated is around 4.20, which is option E. So the correct answer should be E: 4.20°A.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Oh wait, the lattice parameter a is given as 7.28 Å. Oh wait, in the problem statement, it's a =7.28°A. So a is 7.28 Å. So correct formula applies. So d = a / sqrt(3) → 7.28 / 1.732 → 4.20.

So the correct answer is E:4.20°A.

To determine the spacing of the (111) planes in CsBr, we use the formula for the interplanar spacing in a cubic crystal:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}
\]

Here, \(a = 7.28 \, \text{Å}\) is the lattice parameter, and for the (111) planes, \(h = k = l = 1\). Substituting these values:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{7.28}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{7.28}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

The square root of 3 is approximately 1.732. Thus:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{7.28}{1.732} \approx 4.20 \, \text{Å}
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the closest match is option E: \(4.20 \, \text{Å}\).
