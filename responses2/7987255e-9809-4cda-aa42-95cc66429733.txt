Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Two identical wires are stretched by the same tension of 100 N, and each emits a note of frequency 200 cycles per second. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, the wording says each emits a note of frequency 200 cycles per second. But wait, the question says "the tension in one wire is increased by 1 N." Oh, wait, no, I think I misread that part. Let me read again.

Wait, the question is: Two identical wires are stretched by the same tension of 100 N. Each emits a note of frequency 200 cycles/s. Wait, that can't be right, because if both wires are identical and same tension, they should have the same frequency. But wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, the wording says "each emits a note of frequency 200 cycles/second." So both have 200 Hz. But then the tension in one is increased by 1 N. Oh, so only one of them is under tension, which changes its frequency. The other one remains at 200 Hz because the tension is still 100 N.

Wait, but wait a second, no. Because the problem says the wires are stretched by the same tension, which is 100 N. Then the tension in one wire is increased by 1 N. So that wire's tension becomes 101 N. The other wire remains at 100 N.

So each wire has a different tension. Each is a wire, so I assume the wires are made of the same material, same cross-sectional area. So their frequencies depend on the tension and the mass per unit length, right?

The formula for the frequency of a vibrating wire is f = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ), where T is tension, μ is linear mass density, and L is length. But wait, the question says the wires are identical, so their L and μ are the same for both. So when the tension changes, the frequency changes accordingly.

So for each wire, frequency is proportional to the square root of tension. So, wire 1 (under tension 100 N) has f1 = 200 Hz. Wire 2 (tension 101 N) has f2 = sqrt(101/100) * 200 Hz.

Wait, let me compute that. The ratio of tensions is 101/100, which is 1.01. The square root of 1.01 is approximately 1.00498756. So f2 ≈ 200 * 1.00498756 ≈ 200.9975 Hz. So f2 is about 201 Hz.

So the two notes have frequencies approximately 200 Hz and 201 Hz. When you pluck both wires, you'll get two notes, one slightly higher than the other. The number of beats per second is the difference between the two frequencies.

So the beat frequency is f2 - f1 ≈ 201 - 200 = 1 Hz.

Wait, but wait. The question says each wire is under 100 N tension and emits 200 Hz. But then one is increased by 1 N. Oh, so the frequencies are 200 and 201 Hz. The beat frequency is 1 Hz, so you would hear 1 beat per second. So looking at the options, option B is 1 cycle per second. So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me think again. The formula for frequency is f = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ). Since the wires are identical, L and μ are the same, so f is proportional to sqrt(T). So when T increases by 1 N, the new T is 101 N. So the square root is sqrt(101/100) = sqrt(1.01) ≈ 1.00498756, so the frequency increases by about 0.498756% of 200 Hz. So 200 * 0.498756 is approximately 99.75 Hz increase. So 200 + 99.75 ≈ 299.75 Hz? Wait no, that's not right. Wait, no, because the original frequency is 200 Hz, and the new frequency is 200 * sqrt(1.01) ≈ 200 * 1.00498756 ≈ 200.99756 Hz, which is about 201 Hz. Right. So f1=200, f2=201, so beat freq is 1 Hz.

But wait, the question says both wires are under 100 N tension and emit 200 cycles/s. Oh no, wait, wait. Wait, the question says, "Two identical wires are stretched by the same tension of 100 N, and each emits a note of frequency 200 cycles/s." Oh, wait, that can't be correct because if they are identical and same tension, their frequencies should be the same. So perhaps I've misread the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that each wire is under 100 N, but because of something else, they emit 200 Hz. But wait, the question says: "each emits a note of frequency 200 cycles/s." So that's incorrect because identical wires under same tension would have same frequency. That must mean I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, looking again: "Two identical wires are stretched by the same tension of 100 N, and each emits a note of frequency 200 cycles/second." Oh wait, so maybe each wire is under 100 N tension, but the problem states that each emits 200 cycles/s. But that's impossible. Because with same tension and same length and mass per unit length, same frequency. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm not interpreting it correctly.

Wait, perhaps each wire is under a different tension. Wait, the problem says: Two identical wires are stretched by the same tension of 100 N. Oh, wait no, same tension, which is 100 N. So both have same T, so same f. But the question says each emits 200 Hz. That's impossible. So perhaps the problem is that one of the wires has 100 N, and the other has increased by 1 N. So one is under 100 N, the other under 101 N. So each emits 200 Hz. Wait, that can't be, because if they're under different tensions, their frequencies would be different.

Wait, the problem says each emits a note of frequency 200 cycles/s. So perhaps this is not possible, unless I'm misunderstanding. Hmm. Wait, maybe the original tension is 100 N, and each wire is under 100 N, emitting 200 Hz. Then one of them is increased by 1 N. So one is 101 N, the other remains 100 N. So the two frequencies are 200 Hz and approx 201 Hz, so beat frequency is 1 Hz.

But wait, the problem says they're identical, same tension. So same frequency. But the question says each of them emits a note of 200. That would be a contradiction unless I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps each wire is under a different tension, but somehow their frequencies are the same. That seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial tension is 100 N, and both wires are under that tension, emitting 200 Hz. But then when one is increased by 1 N, the other remains 100 N. So the two frequencies are 200 Hz and 201 Hz, leading to a beat frequency of 1 Hz. So the answer would be 1 Hz, which is option B.

But let me check the options again. The options are A to J, with B being 1 Hz. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose the initial tension is 100 N, both wires have same tension, so same f. If the problem says each emitted a note of 200 cycles/s, that's impossible unless they're not under the same tension. So maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem says: "Two identical wires are stretched by the same tension of 100 N, and each emits a note of frequency 200 cycles per second." So both have same tension (100 N), same length, same mass per unit length, so same frequency. So if both are at 200 Hz, how can one be increased? Unless the problem is that one of the wires is under a different tension. Oh, perhaps the original question says that each is under 100 N, but then one is increased by 1 N. Wait, that's not possible because the problem says they're stretched by same tension. So maybe the problem is that each is under same tension, but one has 100 N, the other 101 N.

Wait, perhaps the problem says each is under 100 N, but both are stretched under the same tension, which would be 100 N. So their frequencies are same. But in that case, the beat would be zero, since same frequency. But since one is increased, their frequencies are different.

Wait, the problem says each emits a note of 200 cycles/s. Oh, wait, perhaps the original tension is 100 N, but when one is increased by 1 N, both are under the same tension (100 N). So both have same frequency, but the problem says each emits 200 Hz. Which is impossible because same tension gives same frequency.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the two wires are stretched under the same tension, which is 100 N. So both have same frequency. But the problem states that each emits 200 Hz. Which can't be. So perhaps the problem is that one of the wires is under a different tension. But the way it's worded, "two identical wires are stretched by the same tension of 100 N." So both have same T, so same f. So if each emits 200, which is not possible, unless they're not under the same T. So I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let's read the question again: "Two identical wires are stretched by the same tension of 100 N, and each emits a note of frequency 200 cycles/second." Oh, wait, perhaps the description is that each wire is under 100 N, but one is then increased by 1 N. So one is 100 N, the other is 101 N. So each is under a different tension.

Ah, that makes more sense. Because if each is under 100 N, same T, same frequency. But if one is increased, then each has a different T, so different frequency.

So the frequencies are 200 Hz (T=100 N) and approximately 201 Hz (T=101 N). So the beat frequency is 1 Hz. So, answer is B.
</think>

The problem involves two identical wires stretched by the same tension of 100 N, with each emitting a note of 200 cycles per second. However, the tension in one wire is increased by 1 N, leading to a change in frequency. The goal is to calculate the number of beats heard per second when the wires are plucked.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Frequency Dependence**: The frequency of a vibrating wire is given by:
   \[
   f = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}
   \]
   where \(T\) is tension, \(\mu\) is linear mass density, and \(L\) is length. Since the wires are identical, \(L\) and \(\mu\) are the same, so frequency is proportional to \(\sqrt{T}\).

2. **Initial Conditions**: Both wires are under 100 N tension, emitting 200 cycles per second. However, this is inconsistent because identical wires under the same tension should have the same frequency. This suggests a misread in the problem statement. Instead, it is likely that one wire is under 100 N, and the other is under 101 N.

3. **Tension Increase**: The tension in one wire is increased by 1 N, becoming 101 N. The other wire remains at 100 N. 

4. **New Frequencies**: Using the frequency formula:
   - For \(T = 100 \, \text{N}\), \(f_1 = 200 \, \text{Hz}\).
   - For \(T = 101 \, \text{N}\), \(f_2 = \sqrt{\frac{101}{100}} \cdot 200 \approx 201 \, \text{Hz}\).

5. **Beat Frequency**: The number of beats heard per second is the difference between the two frequencies:
   \[
   \text{Beat frequency} = |f_2 - f_1| = 201 - 200 = 1 \, \text{Hz}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The number of beats heard per second is **1 cycle per second**, corresponding to option **B**.
