Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the mass of calcium bromide needed to prepare a certain solution. Hmm, I remember that concentration problems often involve molarity, moles, and volumes.

The question says: What mass of calcium bromide CaBr₂ is needed to prepare 150 ml of a 3.5 M solution? The molecular weight is given as 200.618 g/mol. The options are A through J.

Alright, let's break this down. I think the formula for molarity (M) is moles of solute divided by liters of solution. So M = moles / liters. Rearranging that, moles = M * liters.

Wait, wait, the volume given is 150 ml. Oh right, I need to convert that to liters. 150 ml is 0.150 liters. So moles would be 3.5 M * 0.150 L.

Let me calculate that. 3.5 times 0.15. Let's see, 3 times 0.15 is 0.45, and 0.5 times 0.15 is 0.075. So adding them gives 0.525 moles. So, 0.525 moles of CaBr₂.

Now, to find the mass, I need the molar mass. The problem states it's 200.618 g/mol. So mass equals moles multiplied by molar mass.

So, 0.525 moles * 200.618 g/mol. Let me compute that. 0.525 times 200 is 105, and 0.525 times 0.618 is... let me think. 0.525 * 0.6 is 0.315, 0.525 * 0.018 is 0.00945. So total is 0.32445. Adding to 105 gives 105.32445 grams. So approximately 105.32 grams.

Looking at the options, let's see which one is close. Option C is 105.32 g, which matches our calculation.

To determine the mass of calcium bromide (CaBr₂) needed to prepare 150 mL of a 3.5 M solution, we use the formula for molarity:

\[
\text{Molarity (M)} = \frac{\text{Moles of solute}}{\text{Volume of solution in liters}}
\]

Rearranging for moles:

\[
\text{Moles} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume (in liters)}
\]

The volume is 150 mL, which converts to 0.150 L. Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Moles} = 3.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.150 \, \text{L} = 0.525 \, \text{moles of CaBr}_2
\]

Next, we calculate the mass using the molar mass of CaBr₂, which is given as 200.618 g/mol:

\[
\text{Mass} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Molar Mass}
\]

\[
\text{Mass} = 0.525 \, \text{moles} \times 200.618 \, \text{g/mol} = 105.32 \, \text{g}
\]

Comparing this result to the options, the closest match is **105.32 g of CaBr₂**, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
