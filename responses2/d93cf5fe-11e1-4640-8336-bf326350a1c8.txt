Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says: A meteorologist reports that there's a 30% chance of rain and no sun. If there's a 40% chance of no rain, then what's the probability that both rain and sun occur? The options are A through J, with various decimal values.

Hmm, so I need to find P(rain and sun). Let me think about how probabilities work here. I remember that when dealing with multiple events, especially when not mutually exclusive, the probabilities can sometimes be found using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Wait, let me break down the information given. The meteorologist's report gives two probabilities: 30% chance of rain and no sun, and 40% chance of no rain. So, let's clarify what each of these means in terms of probability.

First, the probability of rain and no sun is 30%, which I can write as P(rain and no sun) = 0.3. That implies that when it rains, there's a chance it might not be sunny, or vice versa.

The second piece of information is that the probability of no rain is 40%, so P(no rain) = 0.4. Since rain and no rain are mutually exclusive (they can't both happen), the probability of rain must be the remaining part. Because the total probability has to add up to 1 (or 100%), the probability of rain is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So P(rain) = 0.6.

Wait, but I thought the first statement said 30% chance of rain and no sun. So P(rain) would be 0.6, but the first statement says 30% for rain and no sun. That seems a bit conflicting. Let me check that again.

Wait a minute, perhaps I misunderstood. The first statement is "there is a 30% probability of rain and no sun." Does that mean both rain and no sun occur together, or that it's the case that rain and no sun are two separate possibilities? I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think about the events. Let's define two events: A is "rain," and B is "sun." Then, the problem says that P(A and not B) = 0.3 (30% chance of rain and no sun). Also, P(not A) = 0.4 (40% chance of no rain). So, P(A) = 1 - P(not A) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

Wait, but wait! If P(A and not B) is 0.3, and P(A) is 0.6, how does that fit with the definition of probability?

Because P(A and not B) is part of P(A), right? Because when rain happens, either it's sunny or not. So P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B). So, 0.6 = P(A and B) + 0.3. So, solving for P(A and B), we get 0.6 - 0.3 = 0.3. So the probability of both rain and sun is 0.3, which is option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any terms. So, if P(A and not B) is 0.3, that's the chance it's raining but not sunny. Then, the chance it's sunny is the remaining part of P(A). So P(A) is 0.6, so P(A and B) would be 0.6 - 0.3 = 0.3. Therefore, the probability of both rain and sun is 0.3, which is option C.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of another approach. Let me try to outline all possible scenarios.

When it's raining, the possibility of it also being sunny is another factor. So, when it rains, 30% of the time it's not sunny. That leaves 70% of the time it is sunny. So, the probability of rain and sun is 70% of the time it rains.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it. Because P(rain and sun) is the same as P(A and B), which is 0.3, as per our earlier calculation.

Another approach: Since P(not A) is 0.4, P(A) is 0.6. We know that P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B). So, 0.6 = P(A and B) + 0.3 â†’ P(A and B) = 0.3.

So the correct answer should be 0.3, which is option C.

The probability of rain and sun can be determined using the given information. Let A represent rain and B represent sun. We know:

- P(A and not B) = 0.3 (30% chance of rain and no sun).
- P(not A) = 0.4 (40% chance of no rain), so P(A) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

Using the fact that P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B), we substitute the known values:

0.6 = P(A and B) + 0.3

Solving for P(A and B):

P(A and B) = 0.6 - 0.3 = 0.3

The probability of both rain and sun is 0.3, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
