Okay, let's tackle this genetics question. Hmm, so the question is about the mode of inheritance of a particular trait. The setup is that a certain character in animal species is always transmitted from the mother to the offspring and never from the father. I need to figure out what this implies about the inheritance mode.

So, the options are A to J, each suggesting a different kind of inheritance mechanism. Let me think about each option.

Option A: genomic imprinting favoring maternal alleles. Genomic imprinting is when genes are expressed based on their parent of origin. So if the maternal allele is imprinted, it's expressed. But wait, the question says the trait is always transmitted from mother to offspring, so that might fit here. But does it always mean it's maternal? Or could it be paternal?

Option B: polygenic with maternal bias. Polygenic means multiple genes contribute, but the maternal allele gives it an advantage. That's possible, but I don't remember if this is the direct answer.

Option C: Y-linked. Y-linked traits are usually transmitted only from father to son, right? Because females don't pass Y to sons. So if the trait is Y-linked, the father would pass it on, but the question says it's not. So this option might not fit.

Option D: autosomal dominant. Dominant alleles are expressed when at least one copy is present. But the question says the trait is always from mom, not dad. So if the trait is autosomal dominant, it could be either mom or dad passing it on, depending on who has the dominant allele. So the question says it's always from the mother, so maybe it's not dominant because sometimes the father could pass it. Unless it's something different.

Option E: sex-linked. Like, X-linked. But the question says it's not transmitted from father. So if a trait is sex-linked, it would be passed from father to daughter, but not from father to son or mother to son. So that might not fit.

Option F: autosomal but influenced by maternal environmental factors. Hmm. I'm not sure if maternal environmental factors are a standard part of the theory. I know that environmental factors can influence traits, but is that part of the mode of inheritance? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option G: extrachromosomal trait could only be transmitted by the mother. Wait, extrachromosomal traits could be things like X-inactivation. But is being transmitted only from mother? Like, in some cases, maybe. But I'm not sure how that directly relates.

Option H: paternal mitochondrial DNA. That's more about mitochondrial inheritance. If a trait is influenced by mitochondrial DNA, but I'm not sure how that would affect transmission from mother to offspring. This might not be the right fit.

Option I: autosomal recessive. If a trait is autosomal recessive, both parents must contribute a recessive allele for the trait to be expressed. But in this case, the trait is always from the mother, not the father. So maybe that's not it.

Option J: influenced by paternal epigenetic modifications. I don't know much about this, but I'm not sure how that affects transmission.

Wait, the question says the trait is always from the mother to the offspring. So the mother passes it on. So the trait is maternally inherited. So which mode of inheritance causes that?

Looking back, option A is about genomic imprinting, which involves the parent of origin of the gene. So if the trait is inherited from the mother, maybe she imparts it via genes. But does imprinting always favor the mother? Or is it specific?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: in some cases, like X-linked, the trait is only passed from father to daughter or mother to son. But in Y-linked, it's only from father to sons (but sons don't have Y and can't transmit). So this question is about a trait being transmitted from mother to offspring regardless of the father. So if the mother is passing it on, and the father isn't, that's not X or Y linked. Because in X, father can pass it, but in Y, only father can pass it. So the question is about a trait that is maternally inherited but not paternally.

So options A and E are about paternally or maternally inherited. Option E is sex-linked, which would mean the trait is only passed from father to sons. But the question says it's not from father. So E is not correct.

Option A is about genomic imprinting. So for example, if the mother's allele is imprinted and is maternal, it's expressed. So the mother's allele is passed on but not the father's. So the trait is maternally inherited because the mother is passing the allele, but the father isn't. So that fits the question.

Alternatively, option B is polygenic with maternal bias. Polygenic means multiple genes contribute. But the trait is always from mother. Do polygenic traits have maternal bias? I think polygenic traits are usually influenced by multiple genes, but it's not necessarily that the mother's allele is favored. So I'm not sure if this is the right fit.

Another thought: Option J is influenced by paternal epigenetic modifications. That's a less common aspect. Not sure how this would lead to the trait being maternally inherited.

Wait, looking at the options, the only options that don't involve paternal transmission are A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

Wait, the question is about the mode of inheritance that would prevent the trait from being passed from father to offspring. So the question is about the trait being maternally inherited, so perhaps the mechanism is one that doesn't pass on from father.

So, which of the options relate to that?

Genomic imprinting (A) is when genes are expressed based on parent of origin. So if a maternal allele is imprinted (e.g., only expressed when the mother has it), then the trait would be inherited from the mother. But it's not about whether the father imparts it, but if the maternal allele is imprinted. But the question states the trait is always from the mother, so the father doesn't transmit it. So, perhaps the mechanism is imprinting.

Alternatively, perhaps the trait is not influenced by the father, so the presence of the mother's alleles is sufficient.

Wait, another possibility is that the trait is influenced by the mother's genes but not the father's. But that's not one of the options.

So, option A is about the trait being a result of genomic imprinting favoring maternal alleles. That could mean that the maternal allele is imprinted, so the offspring gets it. But does this mean the trait is transmitted from the mother to the offspring, and not from the father?

Alternatively, option E is sex-link. But the question says the trait is not transmitted from father. So E is not the case.

Wait, what about if the trait is influenced by maternal genes but not paternal. So that would be paternally inherited. But the question says the trait is maternally inherited.

Wait, let me think about each option in terms of whether the trait is transmitted from mother to offspring, not from father.

Option A: Genomic imprinting. The mechanism can lead to the mother's allele being imprinted, so the trait is passed on from mother. And since imprinting is based on parent of origin, the father's allele wouldn't be imprinted, so the trait isn't passed from father. So this fits the scenario.

Option B: Polygenic with maternal bias. This would mean the trait is influenced by multiple genes, but the mother's allele gives it a higher chance. So the trait is maternally inherited because the mother's alleles contribute more. But this seems more about the direction of the effect rather than the transmission mechanism.

Option G: extrachromosomal trait could only be transmitted by the mother. Wait, extrachromosomal traits might be transmitted through other means, like from a partner if it's a sex chromosome, but that's X-linked. But the question says it's not transmitted from father to offspring, so G might not be correct.

So, considering all, the best fit is option A, the trait is a result of genomic imprinting favoring maternal alleles. Because that explains how the trait is inherited from the mother without being transmitted from the father.

The question asks about the mode of inheritance where a trait is always transmitted from the mother to the offspring but never from the father. To determine the correct answer, each option is analyzed based on its implications for the inheritance mechanism:

1. **Option A: Genomic imprinting favoring maternal alleles**  
   Genomic imprinting involves genes being expressed based on their parent of origin. If the trait is maternally inherited, it could be due to the maternal allele being imprinted and expressed. This mechanism explains how the trait is passed from the mother but not from the father, fitting the scenario described.

2. **Option B: Polygenic inheritance with maternal bias**  
   Polygenic traits are influenced by multiple genes, but this does not directly explain the inheritance mechanism. While maternal bias might influence the trait's direction, it does not specifically address the transmission from the mother to the offspring.

3. **Option C: Y-linked trait**  
   Y-linked traits are typically transmitted only from the father to the daughter. Since the question specifies that the trait is not transmitted from the father, this option is incorrect.

4. **Option D: Autosomal dominant inheritance**  
   Autosomal dominant traits require at least one copy of the dominant allele for expression. However, the question states that the trait is always transmitted from the mother, which contradicts the concept of autosomal dominant inheritance.

5. **Option E: Sex-linked trait**  
   Sex-linked traits are usually transmitted from the father to the daughter or son. Since the question specifies that the trait is not transmitted from the father, this option is incorrect.

6. **Option F: Autosomal but influenced by maternal environmental factors**  
   While environmental factors can influence traits, this does not directly explain the inheritance mechanism described.

7. **Option G: Extrachromosomal trait transmitted only by the mother**  
   This option is irrelevant to the scenario, as extrachromosomal traits are typically transmitted through other means, such as partnership or through other mechanisms, not necessarily only by the mother.

8. **Option H: Paternal mitochondrial DNA**  
   This is unrelated to the scenario, as mitochondrial DNA is not involved in the inheritance described.

9. **Option I: Autosomal recessive**  
   Autosomal recessive traits require both parents to contribute the recessive allele for expression. The question specifies that the trait is always transmitted from the mother, which contradicts the concept of autosomal recessive inheritance.

10. **Option J: Inherited by paternal epigenetic modifications**  
    This is a less common and less relevant mechanism for the scenario described.

After evaluating all options, **Option A** is the most appropriate answer because genomic imprinting provides a mechanism where the maternal allele is imprinted and expressed, ensuring the trait is transmitted from the mother to the offspring while not being transmitted from the father.

**ANSWER: A**
