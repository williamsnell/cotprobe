Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the entropy change for this reaction. The reaction is 3 H2(g) + N2(g) → 2 NH3(g). I remember that entropy change (ΔS°) is calculated using the standard molar entropies of the reactants and products. The formula is ΔS° = Σ S°(products) - Σ S°(reactants).

Wait, but what are the standard molar entropies of H2, N2, and NH3? I think I'll need those. Let me recall... I think H2 has a standard molar entropy of about 130.7 J/(mol·K), N2 is 191.6 J/(mol·K), and NH3 is around 192.5 J/(mol·K). I'm not 100% certain, but these are the values I remember.

So, let's plug them into the formula. For the reactants, there are 3 moles of H2 and 1 mole of N2. So, the entropy contribution from the reactants is (3 * 130.7) + (1 * 191.6). Let me calculate that. 3 * 130.7 is 392.1, plus 191.6 gives 583.7 J/(mol·K).

Now the products: 2 moles of NH3. So, that's 2 * 192.5, which is 385 J/(mol·K).

So, ΔS° = (385) - (583.7) = 385 - 583.7 = -198.7 J/(mol·K). Hmm, looking at the options, I see option H says -198.6 J/(mol·K). That's very close. But wait, wait—am I sure about the values I used?

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the standard molar entropies. Let me check again. I think H2 is about 130.7, N2 is 191.6, NH3 is 192.5. Yeah, that's what I thought earlier.

Wait, but another thought: are the standard molar entropies in J/(mol·K)? Yes, so the calculation I did is correct. So, subtracting the reactant entropy (583.7) from product (385) gives a negative value, which makes sense because the reaction produces fewer moles of gas (3 H2 and 1 N2, which is 4 moles, but 2 NH3 is 2, so a decrease in moles. As I remember, entropy decreases when the number of moles decreases, so ΔS is negative.)

So the calculation leads me to about -198.7 J/(mol·K). Looking at the options, option H is exactly that value. But wait, why do I have a doubt? Oh, another thing: the problem says to omit terms in the temperature-dependent heat capacities higher than T²/K². Oh, right, that probably means we're not considering the enthalpy capacity or anything beyond, so we're only using the standard entropy values.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check if the data I used is correct. Another approach is to think about the formula again. For the reaction 3 H2 + N2 → 2 NH3.

The change in moles of gas is (3+1) vs (2), so 4 moles to 2, so a decrease of 2 moles. Usually, when the number of moles decreases, entropy decreases. So the entropy change should be negative, which all options are, except for option H which is exactly that. Wait, no, option H is -198.6, which is very close to my -198.7. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but the options don't have option G, which is -183.9. So why is option H the correct one? Let me think again—did I get the standard entropy values right?

Alternatively, perhaps I switched H2 and N2 in the calculation. No, the calculation uses H2 as the reactant, so I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute:

3 H2's entropy: 3 * 130.7 = 392.1

N2's entropy: 1 * 191.6 = 191.6

Total reactants: 392.1 + 191.6 = 583.7 J/(mol·K)

NH3's entropy: 2 * 192.5 = 385 J/(mol·K)

ΔS = 385 - 583.7 = -198.7.

Yes, that's correct. So the correct answer should be option H: -198.6, which is option H. So the correct choice is option I? Wait, no, the options are labeled from A to J, and the choices are labeled I to H. Let me check.

Wait, the options in the problem are:

A: -130.0

B: -220.1

C: -202.4

D: -191.2

E: -175.8

F: -150.7

G: -183.9

H: -198.6

I: -210.5

J: -162.3

So the correct answer is H, which is -198.6. So the answer should be H, which is option H. So the correct option is H.

To calculate the entropy change (ΔS°) for the reaction:

**3 H₂(g) + N₂(g) → 2 NH₃(g)**

we use the formula:

\[
\Delta S^\circ = \sum S^\circ(\text{products}) - \sum S^\circ(\text{reactants})
\]

The standard molar entropies of the substances are as follows:
- H₂(g): 130.7 J/(mol·K)
- N₂(g): 191.6 J/(mol·K)
- NH₃(g): 192.5 J/(mol·K)

### Step 1: Calculate the entropy contribution of the reactants
The reactants are 3 H₂(g) and 1 N₂(g):
\[
\text{Reactants entropy} = (3 \times 130.7) + (1 \times 191.6) = 392.1 + 191.6 = 583.7 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the entropy contribution of the products
The product is 2 NH₃(g):
\[
\text{Products entropy} = 2 \times 192.5 = 385 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate ΔS°
\[
\Delta S^\circ = \text{Products entropy} - \text{Reactants entropy} = 385 - 583.7 = -198.7 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated value of ΔS° is approximately -198.7 J/(mol·K). Among the provided options, this matches **option H: -198.6 J/(mol·K)**.
