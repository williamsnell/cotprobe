Question:

A circular tree trunk has a diameter of 8 feet. Which equation could be used to find the distance in feet around the tree trunk?

Options:

A: C =16π
B: C = 20π
C: C =8π
D: C = 2π
E: C = 4π
F: C = 64π
G: C = 48π
H: C = 12π
I: C = 32π
J: C = 80π

Okay, so I've got this question here about a circular tree trunk. The diameter is given as 8 feet, and I need to find the right equation to calculate the distance around it, which I think is the circumference. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that the formula for the circumference of a circle is something involving pi. Oh right, it's C equals pi times diameter, or sometimes written as C equals 2 times pi times radius. But wait, the question gives me the diameter, not the radius. So I should make sure I use the correct formula.

The diameter is 8 feet. So if I plug that into the formula C = π * d, that would give me C = 8π. Let me check the options. Looking at the choices, option C is C =8π. That seems right.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up diameter and radius. Sometimes, I get confused between the two. The formula with radius is C = 2πr, but since the diameter is twice the radius, I can substitute d = 2r. So if I have d = 8, then r would be 4. Using the other formula, C = 2πr = 2π*4 = 8π. Yep, same result. So both methods give me 8π.

Looking back at the options, option C is C=8π. So that must be the correct answer.

The correct equation to find the circumference (distance around) of a circle with a diameter of 8 feet is:

C = π * d  
C = π * 8  
C = 8π
