Question:

Ms. Fogg is planning an around-the-world trip on which she plans to spend $10,000. The utility from the trip is a function of how much she actually spends on it (Y), given by U(Y) = ln Y. If there is a 25 percent probability that Ms. Fogg will lose $1,000 of her cash on the trip, what is the trip’s expected utility?

Options:

A: 8.895
B: 9.350
C: 9.210
D: 9.000
E: 8.500
F: 10.000
G: 9.184
H: 8.987
I: 8.750

Okay, so I have this question about expected utility for Ms. Fogg's around-the-world trip. Let me try to break it down. 

The question says she plans to spend $10,000, and the utility function is U(Y) = ln(Y). But there's a 25% chance she'll lose $1,000. So I need to calculate the expected utility.

Hmm, I remember that expected utility is the average utility considering the probabilities of different outcomes. So first, I should figure out the possible amounts she might spend and their probabilities.

If she doesn't lose any money, Y is $10,000. So the utility in that case is ln(10,000). If she loses $1,000, Y becomes $9,000, and the utility there is ln(9,000). But since the probability of losing is 25%, or 0.25, the other 75% chance is when she doesn't lose any money.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The probability of losing is 25%, so 75% chance she doesn't lose anything. So the expected utility E[U] should be 0.75 * ln(10,000) + 0.25 * ln(9,000). 

Let me calculate each part. First, ln(10,000). Since ln(10) is about 2.3026, ln(10,000) is ln(10^4) which is 4 * ln(10) ≈ 4 * 2.3026 ≈ 9.2104. So that's the utility when Y is $10k.

Then, ln(9,000). Let's see, ln(9000) is ln(9 * 1000) = ln(9) + ln(1000). ln(9) is about 2.1972, and ln(1000) is ln(10^3) which is 3 * 2.3026 ≈ 6.9078. So adding them gives 2.1972 + 6.9078 ≈ 9.105. So ln(9000) ≈ 9.105.

So now, the expected utility is 0.75 * 9.2104 + 0.25 * 9.105.

Let me compute those. 0.75 * 9.2104. Let's see, 9 * 0.75 is 6.75, 0.2104 * 0.75 is approximately 0.1578. So together, that's approximately 6.75 + 0.1578 = 6.9078.

For the second part, 0.25 * 9.105. 9 * 0.25 is 2.25, and 0.105 * 0.25 is 0.02625. Adding gives 2.25 + 0.02625 = 2.27625.

Now, adding both parts together: 6.9078 + 2.27625 = 9.18405. So the expected utility is approximately 9.184.

Looking back at the options, option G is 9.184. So the answer should be G.

To determine the expected utility, we calculate the weighted average of the utilities at the two possible spending amounts, considering their respective probabilities. 

- **Utility if she spends $10,000:**  
  \( U(10,000) = \ln(10,000) \approx 9.2104 \)
  
- **Utility if she loses $1,000 and spends $9,000:**  
  \( U(9,000) = \ln(9,000) \approx 9.1050 \)
  
- **Expected utility calculation:**  
  \[ E[U] = 0.75 \times 9.2104 + 0.25 \times 9.1050 = 9.18405 \]

The expected utility is approximately **9.184**, which corresponds to option **G**.
