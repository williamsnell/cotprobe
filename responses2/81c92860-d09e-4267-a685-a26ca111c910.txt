Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the average markup on sales for two departments in a radio department store. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.

Alright, the first thing I remember is that markup is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. It's usually expressed as a percentage of the cost. But the question gives me the markup as a percentage of sales, which I think is similar but not exactly the same. Wait, no, I think markup is calculated as a percentage of cost, but sometimes it's also expressed as a percentage of sales. Hmm, I need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says the markup is 30% in the radio department. So if the sales are $15,000, the markup is 30% of sales. Similarly, the tube department has a markup of 25%, and sales were $40,000. So I think I need to calculate the markup amount first, then find the average, and then express it as a percentage of sales.

Wait, no, wait. No, I think I'm mixing up how markup is calculated. Let me think again. If the markup is 30%, that's the percentage added to the cost to get sales. Or is it the percentage of sales? The question says the markup is 30% of sales. So for the radio department, the markup would be 30% of $15,000. And for the tube department, it's 25% of $40,000.

Wait, but wait, that would be the amount of markup, but the question is about the average markup on sales. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.

So, the markup is 30% of the sales. So for radio department: 30% of $15,000. For tube: 25% of $40,000. Then, to find the average markup on sales, I would average these two amounts and then express that as a percentage of the sales.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the markup percentage for each department relative to their sales, then average those percentages.

Wait, but I think the correct approach here is to find the markup as a percentage of sales. So the formula would be: (Markup %) = (Markup amount) / (Cost) * 100. But I don't know the cost for either department. Wait, but the problem only gives me the sales and the markup percentage, not the cost. So that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the question again. It says, "Find the average markup on sales for the two departments." So, if the markup is 30% of sales, then for radio, it's 0.3 * 15,000 = $4,500 markup. For tube, it's 0.25 * 40,000 = $10,000. Then, the average markup is ($4,500 + $10,000) divided by 2, which is 14,500 / 2 = $7,250. Then, to find the markup percentage on sales for the average, we divide this by the average sales.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the average markup would be the average of the two markup amounts, not the markup on the average sales. Let me think again.

Wait, no, perhaps the question is asking for the average markup percentage, so each department's markup percentage is 30% and 25%, so the average would be (30 + 25)/2 = 27.5%. But that's a percentage, so 27.5% would be the average.

Wait, but the options have 27.5% as option C. But wait, the question says "average markup on sales", which might imply that I should calculate the markup as a percentage of their respective sales, then average those percentages.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the markup percentage is a percentage of the sales. For example, if a department sells for $15k and has a 30% markup, that's $4,500 markup. But the markup percentage is 30% of the sales. So the average markup on sales for the two departments would be the average of the two percentages, which is (30 + 25)/2 = 27.5%. So the answer would be C: 27.5%.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because sometimes "average markup" can refer to the average markup on average sales, but in this case, the problem says "average markup on sales", so I think it's the average of the two percentages. Let me check the options. Option C is 27.5%, so that's one of the choices.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the markup as a percentage of their respective sales and then average those percentages. Wait, the radio department's markup is 30%, which is already a percentage of sales. The tube's is 25%. So the average of those two would be (30 + 25)/2 = 27.5%, which is 27.5% as a percentage of sales. So the correct answer is C: 27.5%.

To determine the average markup on sales for the two departments, we calculate the markup percentage for each department based on their sales and then find the average of these percentages.

1. **Radio Department:**
   - Sales: $15,000
   - Markup percentage: 30%
   - Markup amount: 30% of $15,000 = $4,500

2. **Tube Department:**
   - Sales: $40,000
   - Markup percentage: 25%
   - Markup amount: 25% of $40,000 = $10,000

3. **Average Markup on Sales:**
   - Average of 30% and 25% = (30 + 25) / 2 = 27.5%

The average markup on sales for the two departments is 27.5%.

Answer: C
