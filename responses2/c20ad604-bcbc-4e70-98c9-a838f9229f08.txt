Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question says that 100 J of work is done on a system consisting of 1 mole of an ideal gas. The temperature is constant. And it mentions that the change in internal energy (ΔE) is zero for the expansion of an ideal gas at constant temperature. Wait, no, hold on. No, the problem says ΔE = 0 for the expansion. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the expansion's ΔE is zero? Or wait, no, the system's expansion leads to ΔE being zero? No, the problem states, "At constant temperature, ΔE = 0 for the expansion of an ideal gas." Hmm. I might have that backwards. Let me read that again.

The sentence says, "At constant temperature, ΔE = 0 for the expansion of an ideal gas." Wait, so if a gas is expanding at constant temperature, the change in internal energy is zero. Oh, that's right. For an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. So if the temperature is constant, ΔE is zero. So for the system's expansion, ΔE is zero.

Now, the work done on the system is 100 J. Wait, work done on the system is usually positive in physics conventions. So when work is done on the system, the system's internal energy increases. But wait, in thermodynamics, the first law is ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done by the system. Or is it negative? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think.

In physics, the first law is ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So when work is done on the system, W in the equation would be negative. Because if you do work on the system, the system's internal energy increases.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: The work done on the system is positive, and the work done by the system is negative. So if the system does work on the surroundings, that's negative W.

In this problem, 100 J of work is done on the system. So W (work done on the system) is +100 J. Then, ΔU equals Q plus W? Wait, no, wait. The correct formula is ΔU = Q + W, where W is the work done by the system. So if the system does work (like expansion), W is negative. So if work is done on the system, then W is positive. Let me think again: when the system does work, W is negative. So when work is done on the system, W is positive.

So here, W (work done on the system) is +100 J.

But wait, wait. I think I got that wrong. Let me try another approach. The first law equation can be written as ΔU = Q + W, where W is the work done by the system. So if work is done on the system, W is negative. Because the system loses energy. So that would mean that if W is negative, then the equation becomes ΔU = Q - |W|.

Another way: The first law is ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So if the system does work on the surroundings, W is positive, and it's subtracted. So if work is done on the system (input), W is negative, so the equation becomes ΔU = Q - (-|W|) = Q + |W|.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider an example. If I have a gas expanding, so the system does work. The work done by the system is positive (as per the equation). So the system's internal energy decreases. So for the system's expansion, ΔU is negative. But wait, the problem says that at constant temperature, ΔU is zero. Oh wait wait, that's the part I'm getting wrong. Because the problem states, the expansion of the ideal gas at constant temperature has ΔE = 0. So for the system, when it's expanding at constant temperature, the internal energy doesn't change. So ΔU = 0.

Wait, but that's for the system's expansion, right? So for the system's expansion, ΔU is zero. So Q plus W (if W is work done by the system) equals zero. But wait, the problem is about the work done on the system, not the system doing work.

So the problem says 100 J of work is done on the system. So the work done on the system is +100 J. But in the first law, usually, W is the work done by the system. So if the system is doing work (expansion), W is positive. But if work is done on the system, the work is negative in the first law.

Wait, wait. Let me think of the first law as ΔU = Q + W, where W is the work done by the system. So if the system does work (like expansion), W is positive. If the system is being worked on (work done on the system), W is negative.

So in this problem, W is the work done by the system. But the problem says that 100 J of work is done on the system. So that would be W = -100 J. Because the system is taking in 100 J of work.

So the first law becomes:

ΔU = Q + W.

We know that at constant temperature, ΔU is zero. So 0 = Q + W.

But W is the work done by the system, which is -100 J. So substituting:

0 = Q - 100.

So Q = +100 J.

So the heat transfer is +100 J. But wait, no, wait.

Wait, because the system is doing work on the surroundings, and 100 J is being done on the system. Wait, maybe I got the sign wrong.

Let me clarify:

The first law is ΔU = Q + W.

When the system does work on the surroundings, W is positive. Because the system is losing energy.

So, if the system's expansion at constant temperature causes ΔU to be zero, then 0 = Q + W.

But wait, in the system's expansion, the work is done by the system, so W is positive. So:

0 = Q + (work done by system).

So Q = -work done by system.

Wait, but the problem says that 100 J of work is done on the system. So the system is receiving 100 J of work. So that would mean W (work done by system) is -100 J? Because the system is doing negative work, since work is done on it.

Wait, no, perhaps I should re-examine the signs.

Alternative approach: When the system does work (expansion), W is positive. So if 100 J is done on the system, that's W = +100 J (work done on the system is positive).

So substituting into ΔU = Q + W:

0 = Q + (100 J), so Q = -100 J.

So the system is losing 100 J of energy as heat. So Q is negative.

Wait, that would mean that the system is giving up heat. Because Q is negative in this case. Because the system is doing work, so it loses heat.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: The problem might have the system's internal energy changing. Since the expansion at constant temp has ΔU = 0. So the system's expansion doesn't change internal energy.

Wait, but in the scenario where the system is doing work (expansion), the internal energy would decrease, but since ΔU is zero, the system must be releasing heat.

So, in this case, the system is doing work and ΔU is zero. So, the heat would be negative.

Wait, but let's compute it.

Total work done on the system is 100 J. So W (work done on system) is +100 J.

Then, the first law is ΔU = Q + W. But ΔU is zero.

So 0 = Q + 100.

So Q = -100 J. So the system is releasing 100 J of heat.

But wait, the question is about the heat transferred. So the system is losing heat, so the heat transfer is negative. So the heat is leaving the system, which is why Q is negative.

But wait, another way: If work is done on the system (100 J), and ΔU is zero, then all the heat must go into the work? No, because that's not necessarily the case. Let me think.

Wait, in the expansion, the system's internal energy doesn't change. So the heat must be equal to the work done by the system.

Wait, no, because the work done by the system is W, so ΔU = Q + W.

ΔU is zero, so Q = -W.

But wait, the system is expanding, so W (work done by system) is positive. So Q = - positive, so Q is negative. That is, the system is releasing heat.

So the heat transfer Q is -100 J.

Wait, but the question is about the heat transferred when 100 J of work is done on the system. So the heat is leaving the system, so the system is losing heat. Therefore, the heat transferred is negative.

Wait, but the question is asking for the heat transferred when 100 J of work is done on the system. So the system is giving away 100 J. So the heat transfer is -100 J. So the correct option would be the one with -100 J.

Looking at the options, option A is -100 J. So that's the answer.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use the first law of thermodynamics, which states:

\[
\Delta U = Q + W
\]

Here:
- \( \Delta U \) is the change in internal energy,
- \( Q \) is the heat transfer,
- \( W \) is the work done by the system.

The problem specifies that 100 J of work is done on the system, which means \( W = +100 \, \text{J} \) (since work done on the system is positive in physics conventions). It also states that at constant temperature, \( \Delta U = 0 \) for the expansion of an ideal gas. Therefore, the internal energy of the system does not change during this process.

Substituting these values into the first law:

\[
0 = Q + 100
\]

Solving for \( Q \):

\[
Q = -100 \, \text{J}
\]

This indicates that the system is releasing 100 J of heat. Since the heat transfer is negative, it means the heat is leaving the system.

Now, analyzing the options:
- Option A: \(-100 \, \text{J}\) matches the calculated value of \( Q \).

Thus, the heat transferred when 100 J of work is done on the system is \(-100 \, \text{J}\).
