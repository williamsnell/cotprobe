Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this problem. Let me read it again. Bob's Camera Shop reduced the price of their worst selling camera by 8 and 1/3 percent. The original price was $65. I need to find out what the new price is after the discount. The options are from A to J, each with a different amount. 

Hmm, percentage problems can sometimes be tricky, but I think I remember that to find the discount amount, I need to calculate 8 and 1/3 percent of $65 and subtract that from the original price. 

Wait, 8 and 1/3 percent is a bit of a mouthful. Let me thinkâ€”8 is 8/1, and 1/3 is the fraction. So 8 and 1/3 percent is the same as 8.333... percent. I should convert that percentage to a decimal to make the calculation easier. 

So, 8.333...% is equal to 8.333... divided by 100. Let me do that division. 8.333... divided by 100 is 0.083333... So that's the decimal form. 

Next, I need to find out what 8.333...% of $65 is. To find a percentage of a number, you multiply the decimal by the number. So, 0.083333... multiplied by 65. Let me calculate that. 

Wait, maybe I can do this in a different way because 8.333...% is a repeating decimal. I remember that 1/12 is approximately 0.083333... So 8 and 1/3 percent is 1/12. So, maybe it's easier to calculate 1/12 of 65. 

So, 65 divided by 12. Let me do that. 12 times 5 is 60, so 65 is 5 + (5/12). So, 5/12 is about 0.416666..., so 5.416666... So, 8.333...% of 65 is approximately $5.416666... 

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that. Alternatively, I could calculate 8% of 65 and then add 1/3 of 1% of 65. Because 8 and 1/3% is 8% plus 1/3 of 1%. 

So, 8% of 65 is 0.08 * 65. Let me compute that. 0.08 * 60 is 4.8, and 0.08 * 5 is 0.4, so total 5.2. 

Then, 1% of 65 is 0.65. So 1/3 of that is 0.65 / 3, which is approximately 0.216666... So, adding that to 5.2 gives 5.416666..., which matches what I had before. So the discount is approximately $5.416666... 

But wait, the original price was $65. So to find the new price, subtract the discount from the original price. So 65 minus 5.416666... equals 59.583333... So that's approximately $59.583333... 

Looking at the options, option H is $59.58 and option G is $61.58. Hmm. But wait, I might have made a mistake because 8.333% of 65 is 5.416666, so 65 minus that is 59.583333, which is about $59.58. So, the new price is approximately $59.58. Looking at the options, that's option H. 

Wait, but let me check if I did everything correctly. Let me calculate 8.333% of 65 again. So 0.083333 * 65. Let me compute it step by step. 

0.08 * 65 = 5.2
0.003333... * 65 = approximately 0.216666...
Adding them gives 5.416666..., same as before. So 65 minus 5.416666 is indeed 59.583333..., which is $59.58. So option H is $59.58, which seems correct. 

Wait, but I just realized. The question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So, the answer must end with 'H'. So, the correct answer is option H, which is $59.58. So the correct choice is H.

The camera's price is reduced by 8.333...%, calculated as 8% + 1/3% of $65. The discount is $5.416666..., so the new price is $65 - $5.416666... = $59.583333..., which rounds to $59.58. The correct option is H.

Answer: H
