Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding out how many employees out of 400 have incomes between $13,000 and $28,000. The company's employees have a mean income of $20,500, a standard deviation of $3,750, and the income distribution is normal. I remember that for normal distributions, we can use the empirical rule or Z-scores to find probabilities.

First, I need to figure out what Z-scores correspond to the given income ranges. The Z-score formula is (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.

So, let's calculate the Z-scores for $13,000 and $28,000.

For $13,000: (13,000 - 20,500) = -7,500. Divided by 3,750 gives -2. So, the Z-score is -2.

For $28,000: (28,000 - 20,500) = 7,500. Divided by 3,750 gives +2. So, Z-score is +2.

Now, I know that in a normal distribution, about 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two, and 99.7% within three. But since these are Z-scores of ±2, the area between -2 and +2 is about 95% (since 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations). Wait, but wait, wait. I think it's 95% for one standard deviation, so 95% is from μ-σ to μ+σ. But here it's two standard deviations, which is 95.45% I think. Or wait, actually, the empirical rule says 68% within 1σ, 95% within 2σ, and 99.7% within 3σ.

Wait, let me make sure. The empirical rule says:

- 68% of data within ±1σ
- 95% within ±2σ
- 99.7% within ±3σ

So, for Z-scores of ±2, the area between them is about 95.45%. That would mean that about 95% of the employees have incomes within $18,000 to $23,000 (since 20,500 ± 2*3,750). But wait, our question is from $13,000 to $28,000. Hmm, let me check.

Wait no, wait. No, wait. Let me recalculate the Z-scores. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, no, the Z-scores for 13,000 is (13k - 20.5k) = -7500. So, that's -7500/3750 = -2. So, correct. For 28k, 28k-20.5k=7500, 7500/3750=2. So, correct.

So, the range $13,000 to $28,000 is exactly two standard deviations from the mean on both ends. So, according to the empirical rule, that should cover approximately 95.45% of the data. Wait, but wait: the empirical rule says the area between μ-2σ and μ+2σ is about 95.45%. But wait, the question is asking for income between $13k and $28k, which is exactly that range. So, about 95.45% of the employees have incomes in that range.

Wait, but wait, isn't that 95.45%? Because 2 standard deviations on either side. So, 95.45% of 400 employees would be 400 * 0.9545 ≈ 381.8, which is about 382. So, that's close to option F, which is 385, or maybe another option.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh wait, wait a second. Wait, the mean is 20,500. So, $13,000 is 7500 below mean, and 28,000 is 7500 above. So, that's exactly two standard deviations. So, 95.45% is in that range.

But wait, another approach: calculate the Z-scores, find the area between them. So, the Z-scores are -2 and +2. The area from -2 to +2 is about 0.9545, or 95.45%. So, that's approximately 95.45% of 400 employees.

Wait, but wait another thing. The area from μ - 2σ to μ + 2σ is 95.45%, which is correct. So, 400 * 0.9545 is about 381.8, which is approximately 382. So, the closest option is F: 385.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 400 * 0.9545.

0.9545 * 400 = ?

Well, 0.95 *400 = 380, and 0.0045 *400=1.8. So, 380 +1.8 = 381.8, which is about 382. So, the expected number is approximately 382.

Looking at the options, option F is 385, which is close. Alternatively, maybe the question is more precise. Wait, perhaps the exact calculation using Z-scores and standard normal distribution is needed.

Wait, another approach: use the standard normal distribution table.

The Z-scores are ±2. So, the probability that Z is between -2 and +2 is the area under the normal curve between these two points.

Looking up the Z-scores in the standard normal distribution table: the area to the left of Z=2 is about 0.9772, and the area to the left of Z=-2 is about 0.0228. So, the area between -2 and +2 is 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544, which is exactly what I had earlier.

So, 0.9544 is about 95.44%. So, 400 * 0.9544 is 381.76, approximately 382.

But the options don't have 382, the closest is F: 385, which is 385. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation uses more precise values or different methods.

Wait, perhaps the options are approximate. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:100

B:200

C:390

D:300

E:400

F:385

G:375

H:395

I:350

J:50

So, 382 is closest to F:385, but let's see if it's exactly 385 or 380. Wait, perhaps the rounding is different.

Wait, 382 is closer to 380 than to 385. Wait, no: 382 is 382. So, 382 to 385 is 3 units apart, and 382 is 382, so 380 is two units away. So, 385 is 3 units away, and 382 is 3 units away. So, 382 is actually closer to 385 than to 380. Wait, no. Wait, 382 is 382; it's 382. So, 382 is 3 units from 385 (385-382=3) and 2 units from 380. Wait, 380 is 380, so 382 is 2 more than 380, so 382 is 2 units above 380. So, 382 is 382, which is 382, which is closer to 385 than to 380. Because 382 is 3 units away from 385 and 2 units away from 380. So, maybe the answer is 382, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the closest option is F: 385.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. Wait, 95.45% of 400 is 381.8, which is approximately 382. So, 382 is about 382, but the options are 385, 375, etc. So, the correct answer would be 382, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is F:385.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the exact probability using the Z-scores and then compute the number.

Wait, no, I think the correct approach is to use 95.45% of 400, which is about 382, so the closest option is F:385.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused because the options don't have 382. So, perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, wait, another approach: perhaps it's better to calculate the exact probability using the Z-scores and then get the exact number. So, the probability between -2 and +2 is 0.9544. So, 400 * 0.9544 ≈ 381.76, which is approximately 382.

But the options are:

A:100

B:200

C:390

D:300

E:400

F:385

G:375

H:395

I:350

J:50

So, 382 is closest to 385. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo, but I have to choose the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question is about employees, perhaps not all employees are included in the range. But according to the calculation, it's about 95.45%, which is 382, so the closest option is F:385.

Wait, but wait another thing: maybe there's a mistake in the Z-scores. Let me recheck: 13,000 is 7,500 less than 20,500. 7,500 divided by 3,750 is 2. So, yes, Z of -2.

28,000 is 7,500 more than 20,500, so Z is +2. So that's correct.

So, the answer should be approximately 382. But the options don't provide that. So, perhaps the correct answer is F:385, which is the closest option.

Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise Z-value calculation. Wait, but I think it's correct. So, I think the correct number is approximately 382, but since that's not an option, the closest is F:385.

The problem involves finding how many employees out of 400 have incomes between $13,000 and $28,000, given a mean income of $20,500 and a standard deviation of $3,750, with a normal distribution.

1. **Calculate Z-scores**:
   - For $13,000: \( Z = \frac{13,000 - 20,500}{3,750} = -2 \)
   - For $28,000: \( Z = \frac{28,000 - 20,500}{3,750} = +2 \)

2. **Determine the area under the curve**:
   - The area between \( Z = -2 \) and \( Z = +2 \) is approximately 95.45%.

3. **Calculate the number of employees**:
   - 95.45% of 400 employees: \( 400 \times 0.9545 \approx 381.8 \), which is approximately 382 employees.

4. **Match with the options**:
   - The closest option to 382 is F: 385.
