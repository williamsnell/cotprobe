Okay, I need to figure out which activity the first-grade teacher should choose to introduce students to nonstandard units of measurement. Let me think through each option.

First, the teacher is focusing on nonstandard units, so the activities should use something that's easy for young kids to handle. Options that involve real objects are better because they can be more relatable.

Option A uses pencils, which is fine, but maybe too concrete for a class. They might not have the same tools, and measuring a desk with pencils could be confusing for some kids.

Option B talks about a digital scale for lunchbox weight. That's a real-world application, but I'm not sure if that's a nonstandard unit. It's a tool they might know how to use, but the primary goal is to learn measurement, not measurement tools.

Option C is measuring a door with a measuring tape. That's a good idea because a door is a common, easily accessible object. It's nonstandard but practical for the class.

Option D uses a ruler. Rulers are standard units, but maybe some students are more familiar with it. However, since the teacher's goal is to introduce nonstandard units, maybe they want to start with something else.

Option E asks students to count liter bottles in a gallon container. That's a practical activity but more about capacity and comparison rather than measurement units. They might not grasp the concept of using a unit to measure something else.

Option F is about standing in a line by height, which is about order and height. It doesn't involve measurement, so not relevant here.

So, comparing the options, C and D are about measuring using nonstandard units. C is about a specific object, which is a bit more direct. D uses a ruler, which is standard but perhaps not the best nonstandard option. So option C seems better because it's a concrete, common object that students can measure using a tape. It's also a good way to introduce the concept of using a nonstandard unit.

The best activity to introduce nonstandard units is using a measuring tape to measure the length of a classroom door. This option allows students to apply a nonstandard unit in a practical context.

Answer: C
