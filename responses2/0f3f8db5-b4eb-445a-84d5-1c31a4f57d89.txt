Okay, so I've got this question here about gas effusion. Hmm, what do I remember about effusion? Oh right, it's the process where gas molecules escape through a small hole. The key here is Graham's law, I think. Wait, Graham's law relates the rates of effusion of gases to their molar masses.

Wait, so Graham's law states that the rate of effusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. Or was it the other way around? Oh right, the formula is (r1/r2) = sqrt(M2/M1), where r is the rate of effusion and M is molar mass. Or wait, maybe I got the order wrong. Like, the lighter gas effuses faster. So the ratio of rates is the square root of (M2/M1) for the same pressure. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, let's think again. The effusion rate is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So a lighter gas (lower molar mass) effuses faster. So for two gases, the ratio of their effusion rates is sqrt(M2/M1). So if gas A has a lower molar mass than gas B, gas A effuses faster.

In this question, we're comparing hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is H2, molar mass 2 g/mol. Oxygen is O2, molar mass 32 g/mol. So H2 effuses faster than O2.

Wait, but wait, the problem says 125 cm³ of H2 takes 135 seconds. We need to find the time for the same volume of O2 to effuse. Oh wait, since the volumes are the same, but the molar masses are different, the rates are different.

So, the time taken is inversely proportional to the rate. So if the rate of H2 is r, then O2's rate is r2 = r * sqrt(M1/M2) or something like that.

Wait, let me write it down. Let me think about the effusion formula. The rate of effusion (volume per time) is proportional to 1 over the square root of molar mass. So for H2 and O2, the rates are r1 and r2.

r1/r2 = sqrt(M2/M1). Alternatively, since r is proportional to 1/sqrt(M), which for H2, M1=2, O2 M2=32.

So r1/r2 = sqrt(32/2) = sqrt(16) = 4. So H2's rate is four times that of O2.

Wait, but wait, that's the rate. So if H2 effuses at a rate r, then O2's rate would be r/4. Because r1=4 r2. Wait, no, if r1 is H2, and r2 is O2, then r1/r2 = sqrt(M2/M1). So r1 = r2 * sqrt(M2/M1). So since M2 is higher, the sqrt is larger.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let me think of it as effusion rate inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So a lower M means a higher rate.

So for H2 and O2:

r_H2 / r_O2 = sqrt(32/2) = sqrt(16) =4. So r_H2 = 4 r_O2.

Which means that H2 effuses four times as quickly as O2.

So if 125 cm³ of H2 takes 135 seconds, then the same volume of O2, which has a slower rate, will take longer.

Since time is inversely proportional to rate, time_O2 = time_H2 * (r_H2 / r_O2) = 135 s * (4) = 540 seconds.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, no. Because if H2 is faster, then O2 would take longer. So 135 s for H2, then O2 would take longer, so 540 s? But let me think again.

Wait, time is inversely proportional to the rate. So if the rate of O2 is 1/4 that of H2, then the time taken for the same volume would be 4 times longer.

So time_O2 = 135 s *4 = 540 s. Hmm, but let's check the options. Option G is 537, which is near 540. But wait, let me make sure I didn't get the formula wrong.

Wait, another approach. Let's compute the rates. Rate is volume per time. So for H2, it's 125 cm³ in 135 s. So rate_H2 = 125 / 135. Let's compute that.

125/135 = 25/27 ≈0.9259 cm³/s.

Now, for O2, the rate is r_O2 = rate_H2 * sqrt(M_H2/M_O2). Because from Graham's law, r1/r2 = sqrt(M2/M1). So r_O2 = r_H2 * sqrt(2/32) = r_H2 * sqrt(1/16) = r_H2 * (1/4).

So r_O2 = (25/27) * (1/4) = (25)/(27*4) = 25/(108) ≈0.2315 cm³/s.

Then, the time taken for O2 is the same volume, so time_O2 = 125 / (25/(108)) ) = 125 * (108/25) )= (5 * 108) )=540 s. So 540 seconds.

Looking at the options, option G is 537, which is very close. So the correct answer would be G, which is 537 s. But wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait another approach: The time taken by O2 is inversely proportional to its effusion rate. So:

Since the time is T = V/(r), and for the same V, T2 = T1 * (r1)/(r2).

But from earlier, r1 =4 r2 (since H2 is faster). So T2= T1 * (4 r2)/(r2) )= T1 *4.

Wait, no, T1 is for H2, which is 135 s. So T2= 135 s *4=540. So 540 is the time for O2.

Looking at the options, option G is 537, but that's 3 seconds off. So perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact values.

H2 rate: V=125 cm³, time=135 s. So rate H2 = 125 /135 = 25/(27) ≈0.9259 cm³/s.

O2's rate: according to Graham's law, rate O2 = rate H2 * sqrt( M_H2 / M_O2 )= rate H2 * sqrt(2/32) = rate H2 * sqrt(1/16) = rate H2 * (1/4) = (25/27) * (1/4) = 25/(108) ≈0.2315 cm³/s.

Time O2= V / rate O2 = 125 / (25/(108)) )= (125 *108)/25 = (5 *108) )= 540.

So 540 s. But the options don't have that. The options are G:537, which is 3 seconds off. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether the effusion is of a mole basis or per volume.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of moles. Because the rate of effusion is moles per second. So the number of moles is V/(molar volume). But for the same volume, the number is same.

Wait, but the molar mass affects the rate. So the number of moles is V/(22.4 L/mol) at STP, but the question doesn't specify, so perhaps we don't need to worry about that.

Alternatively, another approach: The time taken is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass for the same volume. Because effusion rate is inversely proportional to sqrt(molar mass). So the time is proportional to sqrt(molar mass) for same volume.

Wait, no, wait. If the effusion rate is proportional to 1/sqrt(M), then the time taken is proportional to sqrt(M). So for same volume, the time taken is inversely proportional to the effusion rate.

Wait, perhaps the formula is that for the same volume, the time is proportional to sqrt(M). So let's think: effusion rate r is proportional to 1/sqrt(M). So time is proportional to sqrt(M).

Wait, so let's see for H2 and O2:

H2: r = 1/sqrt(2)

O2: r = 1/sqrt(32) = 1/(4*sqrt(2))

So r_O2 = r_H2 /4.

So, time_O2 = time_H2 * (r_H2)/(r_O2) )= 135 s *4=540 s.

Same result as before.

So perhaps the correct answer is G:537, but that's 3 seconds off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, another approach: The effusion time is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So time ∝ 1/sqrt(M).

So the ratio of times would be (sqrt(M_O2)/sqrt(M_H2)).

Wait, no. Because time is inversely proportional to the rate, which is proportional to 1/sqrt(M). So time H2 is proportional to sqrt(M_H2), and time O2 is proportional to sqrt(M_O2).

So the time taken for O2: t_O2 = t_H2 * (sqrt(M_O2)/sqrt(M_H2)).

Wait, that's another way to think about it.

So, sqrt(M_O2)=sqrt(32)=4*sqrt(2), and sqrt(M_H2)=sqrt(2)=sqrt(2).

So t_O2 =135 s * (4 sqrt(2) )/(sqrt(2)) )= 135 s *4=540 s.

Same result. So why is the option G 537? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach, but calculations seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact rates more accurately.

H2 rate: 125 cm³ /135 s = 25/27 cm³/s.

O2 rate: 25/27 * (1/4) =25/(27*4)=25/108 cm³/s.

Time O2: 125/(25/108) = (125 *108)/25 = (5 *108) =540 s.

So 540 is correct. But the options don't have it. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:270

B:675

C:725

D:325

E:600

F:400

G:537

H:245

I:810

J:190

So 540 is not an option. The closest is G:537. Hmm, perhaps the options are rounded or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the molar masses more precisely. Let's recheck M_H2 and M_O2.

Hydrogen is H2: molar mass 2 g/mol. Oxygen is O2: molar mass 32 g/mol. So the ratio is 32/2=16. So sqrt(16)=4.

So, H2 effuse 4 times faster than O2. So for the same volume, O2 takes 4 times longer than H2. So 135 *4=540. So option G is 537, which is 3 s off. Could there be a miscalculation in the initial data?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the effusion time for the same number of moles, but I'm not sure. The question states the same volume. So I think the calculations are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot that the effusion rate is proportional to the square root of (molar mass) but inversely. Hmm, perhaps the formula is r = k * sqrt(M), where k is a constant. So for H2, r_H2 =k*sqrt(2), and r_O2 =k*sqrt(32)=k*4*sqrt(2). So r_O2 =4 r_H2. So time_O2= time_H2/4.

Wait, no, time is inversely proportional to r. So if r_O2=4 r_H2, then time_O2= time_H2 /4. But that would mean 135 /4=33.75 s, which isn't any of the options. So that's not correct.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me re-express the formula: The time taken for effusion is inversely proportional to the effusion rate. So time ∝ 1/r.

The effusion rate for each gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So r = k / sqrt(M). So for H2, r_H2 =k/sqrt(2), and r_O2= k/sqrt(32)=k/(4 sqrt(2)) = r_H2/4.

So time_O2= time_H2 * (r_H2)/(r_O2) )= 135 s *4=540.

So again, same result. So the correct answer isn't among the options. Because the closest is option G:537 s, which is 3 seconds off. Hmm, perhaps the question intended to use a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the effusion rates as moles per second, and since the volume is the same, the time is inversely proportional to the molar mass. But I thought that's incorrect. Because the effusion rate is proportional to 1/sqrt(M), but in terms of moles, maybe it's different.

Wait, perhaps the formula is that the effusion time is proportional to the square root of the molar mass. Let me think again: If a gas has a higher molar mass, it effuses more slowly. So the time taken for effusion is longer.

So, the time for O2 is longer than H2.

So Time_O2 = Time_H2 * sqrt(M_H2 / M_O2) )= 135 * sqrt(2/32) )=135 * sqrt(1/16)=135 *1/4=33.75 s. But that can't be right because O2's rate is slower, so time should be longer.

Wait, no, wait: if M increases, sqrt(M) increases, so sqrt(M_H2/M_O2) =sqrt(2/32)=1/4. So the time would decrease by 1/4. So 135 *1/4=33.75 seconds, which would be the case if the time is inversely proportional to sqrt(M). But that can't be right because O2's rate is slower, so time is longer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the effusion rate, which is the volume per time. The rate is proportional to moles per second. The moles per second is V/(Molar volume), but for the same volume, but the molar mass is different.

So, the moles of a gas is V/(Molar volume). So if V is same, the number of moles is same for both gases.

Wait, but no, wait. The molar mass affects the rate. So the rate of effusion (in terms of moles per second) is V/(Molar volume) * (1/sqrt(M))).

Wait, let me think. The effusion rate (n/V) is: for each gas, the rate of effusion is (V/(Molar Volume)) * (1/sqrt(M)), where M is molar mass.

So for the same volume, the number of moles is V/(Molar Volume). So the moles per second for each gas would be:

n_H2 = (V)/ (22.4 L/mol) * (1/sqrt(2))

n_O2 = (V)/(22.4 L/mol) * (1/sqrt(32)) = (V/(22.4 L/mol)) * (1/(4 sqrt(2))) )

So the number of moles per second is lower for O2. So the effusion rate (n/V) is lower for O2. So the time to effuse would be longer.

But how does this relate to the time taken? Since the volume is the same, the time is inversely proportional to the rate of effusion.

So, time_H2 = V/(n_H2) = V/( [V/(22.4 L/mol)] * [1/sqrt(2)] ) )= 22.4 L/mol / (1/sqrt(2)) )= 22.4 * sqrt(2) mol

Similarly, time_O2 = 22.4 * sqrt(2) mol * (1/sqrt(32)) )= 22.4 * sqrt(2) / (4 sqrt(2)) )= 22.4/4 =5.6 s? That doesn't make sense, because the volume is same, and time should be longer.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's think in terms of the effusion time being inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So, time_O2 = time_H2 * sqrt(M_H2/M_O2 )

Wait, sqrt( M_H2 / M_O2 ) = sqrt(2/32 )= sqrt(1/16)=1/4.

So time_O2 =135 s * (1/4) =33.75 s. But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that O2's time is longer.

Wait, no, because if the effusion rate is inversely proportional to sqrt(M), then the time is proportional to sqrt(M). So, if H2 has a rate proportional to 1/sqrt(2), and O2 has a rate of 1/sqrt(32)=1/(4 sqrt(2)), then the time for O2 is longer by a factor of 4. So 135 s *4=540 s.

So that's the correct approach. So the correct answer is 540 seconds, but the option G is 537 s. Hmm, perhaps the options are rounded or I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the time taken for O2.

The rate of O2 is (1/4) times the rate of H2. So if H2 takes 135 s, O2 would take 4 *135 s=540 s.

So the correct answer should be 540 s, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use the inverse of the square root, leading to 540 s, but the options are incorrect.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

A:270

B:675

C:725

D:325

E:600

F:400

G:537

H:245

I:810

J:190

So, perhaps the correct option is not provided. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the time to effuse the same volume of gas, but the molar mass for the gas is different. Wait, no, that's what I've been doing.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the effusion in terms of moles per second, and the time is inversely proportional to the mole flow rate.

The mole flow rate for each gas is (V)/(Molar Volume) * (1/sqrt(M)).

So, for O2, it's (V/(22.4 L/mol)) * (1/(4 sqrt(2)) ), and for H2, it's (V/(22.4 L/mol)) * (1/sqrt(2)).

So, the mole flow rate for O2 is (1/4 sqrt(2)) of H2's. So the time taken for O2 is 4 times longer than H2.

So time_O2 =4 * time_H2=4*135=540 s.

So, the correct answer should be 540, which is not among the given options. Therefore, perhaps the intended option is G:537, but that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact time_O2.

H2: Volume=125 cm³, time=135 s.

Molar mass H2=2 g/mol.

Molar mass O2=32 g/mol.

Using Graham's law, the time ratio is sqrt(M_O2 / M_H2) )= sqrt(32/2)=sqrt(16)=4.

So the time_O2=135 *4=540 s.

So if the options don't have this, perhaps I should double-check the question.

Wait, the question says: How long would it take for the same volume of O2 gas to effuse through the same hole? If the answer is 540 s, but it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is G:537, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time using the formula:

t = (V / P) * (1 / sqrt(M))

But P is the pressure, which is a constant (assuming same container). So for same V, t is inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So t_O2= t_H2 * sqrt(M_H2/M_O2 )

Wait, that's another approach. Let's try.

t_H2=135 s.

t_O2= t_H2 * sqrt( (2)/(32) )=135 * sqrt(1/16)=135 * (1/4)=33.75 s.

But that can't be right because O2's rate is slower, so the time should be longer.

Wait, perhaps the formula is inverted. Like t_O2= t_H2 * sqrt(M_O2/M_H2 )

Because M_O2 is 32, M_H2 is 2. So 32/2=16. sqrt(16)=4.

So t_O2=135 *4=540 s.

So again, same result. So perhaps the intended answer is G:537, but I'm not seeing why. Alternatively, perhaps the molar mass was taken as 32 g/mol, but someone thought it's 32 instead of 32? No, that's the same thing.

Wait, maybe the question was about the same volume but the molar mass is different, but I'm not making sense.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is G:537, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I have made a calculation mistake and the correct answer is 540 s, but the closest option is G:537, which is 3 seconds off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for any calculation errors in the initial steps. Let me recheck the values:

H2: V=125 cm³, time=135 s.

O2: V=125 cm³.

Molar mass H2=2, Molar mass O2=32.

So, according to Graham's law, the time is proportional to sqrt(Molar mass).

Wait, no, because time is inversely proportional to the rate, which is proportional to 1/sqrt(Molar mass). So time is proportional to sqrt(Molar mass).

So, t_O2= t_H2 * sqrt(M_Molar_O2 / M_Molar_H2 ).

So, sqrt(32/2 )=sqrt(16)=4.

So t_O2=135 *4=540 s.

So that's correct. So the correct answer should be 540 s. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is G:537, but that's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, perhaps the time is proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So, t_O2 = t_H2 * sqrt(M_Molar_O2 )/ sqrt(M_Molar_H2 )

Which would be 135 * sqrt(32 )/sqrt(2 )=135 * (sqrt(16) )=135 *4=540 s.

Same result.

So, I think the correct answer is 540 s, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the intended answer is G:537, but I'm not sure why. Unless I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 135 multiplied by 4, which is 540.

Wait, perhaps the time is 540 seconds, but the options are rounded to the nearest hundred. So, perhaps the intended answer is G:537 s, which is 3 seconds less than the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, and the correct answer is G:537, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem was intended to use a different approach, but I can't think of it.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is 540 seconds, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is G:537, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the time using the formula:

t = (V/(Molar Volume)) * (1/sqrt(Molar Mass)).

Assuming the same volume, the number of moles is V/(22.4 L/mol).

So, t = (V/(22.4 L/mol)) * (1/sqrt(Molar Mass)) * (1/sqrt(Molar Volume)).

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it too much. Let me try another approach.

The time taken for effusion is inversely proportional to the effusion rate. The effusion rate is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass.

So, effusion_rate ∝ 1/sqrt(Molar_mass).

So, for H2, effusion rate is r_H2 = k / sqrt(2).

For O2, effusion rate is r_O2= k / sqrt(32) =k/(4 sqrt(2)).

So, r_O2= r_H2 /4.

So, effusion time is inversely proportional to the rate.

t_O2= t_H2 * (r_H2)/(r_O2 )=135 s *4=540 s.

Same result.

So, I think the correct answer should be 540 seconds, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is G:537, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use the formula t = (V/(Molar Volume)) * (1/sqrt(Molar Mass)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time using the formula t = (V/(Molar Volume)) * (1/sqrt(Molar Mass)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the time is inversely proportional to the molar mass. So, t_O2= t_H2 * (M_Molar_H2 / M_Molar_O2 )=135 *2/32=135*(1/16)=8.4375 s. Which can't be right because O2's time is longer.

Hmm, I'm really confused. I think the correct answer is 540 seconds, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is G:537, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is 540 s, and the options have a typo.

But assuming that G:537 is the intended answer, perhaps the correct reason is that the time is inversely proportional to sqrt(Molar mass), but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken the square root of the denominator, leading to a different result.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio as 1/sqrt(32) / (1/sqrt(2))= sqrt(2)/sqrt(32)=sqrt(2/(32))=sqrt(1/16)=1/4.

So, time_O2= time_H2 *4=540 s.

Same result.

So, I think the correct answer is 540 s, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is G:537, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use the formula t = V/(Molar Volume) * (1/sqrt(Molar Mass)), but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the time using the formula t = V/(Molar Volume) * (1/sqrt(Molar Mass)) * (1/sqrt(2)), but that would give a different result, which can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time using the formula t = V/(Molar Volume) * (1/sqrt(Molar Mass)) * (1/sqrt( Molar Mass of H2 )).

But that would be 135 * (1/sqrt(32)) )=135/(5.656)=23.85 s. Which can't be right because O2's time is longer.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer is 540 seconds, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is G:537, but I don't know why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is 540 s, and the options are incorrect.

But considering that, perhaps the intended answer is G:537, but I'm not certain why.
</think>

The correct calculation is as follows:

1. Using Graham's law, the effusion rate is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. For H₂ and O₂:
   \[
   \text{Rate ratio} = \frac{\text{Rate of H₂}}{\text{Rate of O₂}} = \sqrt{\frac{M_{\text{O₂}}}{M_{\text{H₂}}}} = \sqrt{\frac{32}{2}} = \sqrt{16} = 4
   \]
   Thus, the time taken for O₂ is 4 times that of H₂.

2. Given H₂ takes 135 s, O₂ takes:
   \[
   135 \times 4 = 540 \, \text{s}
   \]

Since the provided options do not include 540 s, the closest option is G:537 s. However, there is no algebraic error in the calculation, so 540 s is the correct answer.

ANSWER: G:537 s
