Okay, so I've got this eigenvalue problem to solve. The matrix given is a 3x3 one. Let me write it out to get a clear picture: 

The matrix A is:
[3, -2, 5]
[1, 0, 7]
[0, 0, 2]

Hmm, I remember that eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix of the same size. So I need to compute the determinant of (A - λI).

Let's construct A - λI. Subtracting λ from the diagonal elements gives:

[3-λ, -2,   5    ]
[1,    -λ,   7    ]
[0,    0,    2-λ ]

Now I need to find the determinant of this matrix. Since it's a 3x3 matrix, I can expand along the third row because it has a zero which might simplify calculations.

The determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix when expanding along row i is:

det(A) = a_{i1}*det(minor_i1) - a_{i2}*det(minor_i2) + ... 

In this case, the third row is [0, 0, 2-λ]. So the expansion will be:

0 * minor_31 - 0 * minor_32 + (2 - λ) * minor_33.

Wait, but the minor for the third row and third column is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix that remains after removing row 3 and column 3. So minor_33 is the determinant of the top left 2x2 matrix:

[3-λ, -2]
[1,   -λ]

The determinant of that is (3-λ)(-λ) - (-2)(1) = (-3λ + λ²) + 2 = λ² -3λ +2.

So putting it all together, the determinant of A - λI is (2 - λ) multiplied by (λ² -3λ +2). Let me compute that:

(2 - λ)(λ² -3λ +2) = (2)(λ² -3λ +2) - λ(λ² -3λ +2)
= 2λ² -6λ +4 -λ³ +3λ² -2λ
= -λ³ + (2λ² +3λ²) + (-6λ -2λ) +4
= -λ³ +5λ² -8λ +4.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the signs. Let me double-check. Expanding (2 - λ)(λ² -3λ +2):

It's 2*(λ²) + 2*(-3λ) +2*2 -λ*(λ²) -λ*(-3λ) -λ*2
= 2λ² -6λ +4 -λ³ +3λ² -2λ
Combine like terms:
-λ³ + (2λ² +3λ²) + (-6λ -2λ) +4
= -λ³ +5λ² -8λ +4.

Wait, but wait, the characteristic equation is det(A - λI) = 0, so:

-λ³ +5λ² -8λ +4 = 0.

But I can multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:

λ³ -5λ² +8λ -4 = 0.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this cubic equation. Let's try possible rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are factors of 4 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±4.

Let's test λ=1: 1 -5 +8 -4 = (1-5) = -4, +8 =4, -4=0. So λ=1 is a root.

So (λ -1) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Using synthetic division with root 1:

Coefficients: 1 | -5 | 8 | -4
Bring down 1. Multiply by 1: 1
Add to next coefficient: -5 +1 = -4
Multiply by 1: -4
Add to next: 8 + (-4) =4
Multiply by1:4
Add to last: -4 +4=0.

So the polynomial factors as (λ-1)(λ² -4λ +4). The quadratic factor is λ² -4λ +4. Let's factor that:

λ² -4λ +4 = (λ-2)^2. So the roots are λ=1, λ=2 (double root).

Wait, but the options don't include a quadratic, only linear options. Wait, looking at the options, option E is [1,3], which would imply λ=1 and λ=3. But according to my calculation, the eigenvalues are 1 and 2 (with multiplicity 2).

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the determinant calculation because maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the determinant I found was (2-λ)(λ² -3λ +2) = (2-λ)(λ²-3λ+2). Let me compute this again.

(2 - λ)(λ² -3λ +2) = 2*(λ²) + 2*(-3λ) + 2*2 - λ*(λ²) - λ*(-3λ) - λ*2
= 2λ² -6λ +4 -λ³ +3λ² -2λ
Combine terms:
-λ³ + (2λ² +3λ²) + (-6λ-2λ) +4
= -λ³ +5λ² -8λ +4.

Wait, but this doesn't factor into (λ-1)(λ-2)^2 because when I plug λ=2 into the determinant equation:

det(A - 2I) = (2-2)(...) = 0, so it's a root, but (2-2) is zero, so the equation would be (2 - λ)(λ² -3λ +2) =0 → (λ-2)(λ²-3λ+2) =0.

Wait, but earlier I thought the quadratic was (λ-1)(λ-2), but no, the quadratic is λ²-3λ+2, which factors into (λ-1)(λ-2). So the determinant equation is (2-λ)(λ-1)(λ-2) =0. So the eigenvalues are λ=2, λ=2, λ=1.

Wait, no, because 2-λ is same as -(λ-2), so the equation is -(λ-2)(λ-1)(λ-2)=0 → (λ-1)(λ-2)^2=0. So the eigenvalues are λ=1 (once) and λ=2 (twice).

But looking at the options, none of them include a double root. The options are all single roots. So maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the determinant calculation. Let me compute the determinant again.

Matrix A - λI:
[3-λ, -2, 5]
[1, -λ, 7]
[0, 0, 2-λ]

The determinant is computed as:

(3-λ)*[(-λ)(2-λ) - 7*0] - (-2)*[1*(2-λ) -7*0] +5*[1*0 - (-λ)*0]

Simplify each term:

First term: (3-λ)*[ (-λ)(2-λ) ] = (3-λ)(-λ(2-λ)) = (3-λ)(-2λ + λ²)
Second term: - (-2)*[ (2-λ) -0 ] = +2*(2-λ)
Third term: 5*[0 - 0] = 0.

So the determinant is (3-λ)(-2λ + λ²) + 2*(2-λ).

Let me expand (3-λ)(λ² -2λ) → 3*(λ² -2λ) - λ*(λ² -2λ) → 3λ² -6λ -λ³ +2λ² → -λ³ +5λ² -6λ.

Then add 2*(2-λ) → 4 -2λ.

So overall determinant: -λ³ +5λ² -6λ +4 -2λ = -λ³ +5λ² -8λ +4.

Wait, but earlier I had a different result. Now I'm getting -λ³ +5λ² -8λ +4, same as before. So the equation is correct.

Wait, so the roots are 1 and 2 (twice). So the eigenvalues are 1, 2, 2.

But the options don't include anything with a double root. So perhaps the answer is the distinct eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues are 1 and 2. Looking at the options, which options include 1 and 2?

Looking at the options:

A: [1, 2] → yes.

E: [1,3] → 3 is wrong.

H: [1,7] → 7 is wrong.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

A: [1,2]

B: [3,-2]

C: [2,5]

D: [3,7]

E: [1,3]

F: [3,2]

G: [-2,5]

H: [1,7]

I: [6,2]

J: [1,6]

So option A is [1,2], which includes the eigenvalues 1 and 2. But wait, earlier I thought the eigenvalues are 1 and 2 (twice). So the correct eigenvalues are 1 and 2. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The determinant equation was (2 - λ)(λ² -3λ +2) =0 → (2-λ)(λ-1)(λ-2)=0. So roots are λ=2, λ=1 (twice). So the eigenvalues are 1 and 2, but 2 is a double root, so the algebraic multiplicity is 2.

But the question is asking for real eigenvalues. So the real eigenvalues are 1 and 2. Looking at the options, option A: [1,2] includes both. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but wait again. I thought the determinant equation was (2-λ)(λ²-3λ+2) =0 → (λ-2)(λ-1)(λ-2)=0 → λ=2 (double), λ=1.

So the eigenvalues are 1 and 2, with 2 being a double root. But in this context, the question is about the real eigenvalues, so 1 and 2 are both real. So the correct options are those that contain both 1 and 2. Looking at the options, option A is [1,2], which is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the eigenvalues are 1, 2, and 2. So the eigenvalues are 1 and 2, but 2 is repeated. So the real eigenvalues are 1 and 2. Therefore, option A is correct.
</think>

The eigenvalues of the matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation. The determinant of \( A - \lambda I \) is computed as:

\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = (2 - \lambda)(\lambda^2 - 3\lambda + 2) = (2 - \lambda)(\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 2)
\]

The roots are \( \lambda = 1, 2, 2 \). Thus, the real eigenvalues are 1 and 2. Among the options, the correct choice is:
