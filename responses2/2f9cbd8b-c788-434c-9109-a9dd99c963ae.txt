Okay, so I've got this question about neon tubes and the red glow. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see.

The question is asking about the last character of the answer. So the options are A to J, and I need to pick one. The options are all different types of optical phenomena. Oh wait, the question is about the cause of the red glow in a neon tube's neon tube.

Wait, neon lights emit light, right? And the glow is red. So I'm trying to remember what causes that color. I think neon lights emit light not just red but a range of colors. The white neon inside produces white light when you look at it, but the neon inside the tube emits red. 

So, what's the mechanism here? I remember something about fluorescence. Fluorescence is when energy from the light is re-emitted. I think neon gas inside the tube has electrons that are excited by the UV light from the neon gas. When they get excited, they emit light of a specific color because they drop energy levels, so they emit red. 

Absorption is when a substance absorbs a photon and doesn't let it through. That's more like a glass or a window. Refraction is bending of light, like when you look at water and see the rainbow. De-excitation is when electrons drop higher energy levels to lower ones, emitting light. Oh wait, that's fluorescence. So reflection is when light bounces off a surface. Coherence is about light waves being in phase, which is more about interference, like in a double-slit experiment. 

So the glow is caused by fluorescence, right? Because when the electrons drop from a higher energy level to a lower one (which would be a lower energy level, like from n=3 to n=2 in an atom), they emit light. The color comes from the specific energy difference. Neon has a specific spectrum of colors when it's excited.

Looking at the options, option A is fluorescence. So the answer should be A.

The red glow in the neon tube arises due to fluorescence, where electrons in the neon gas drop from higher energy levels to lower ones, emitting light of specific color. 

Answer: A
