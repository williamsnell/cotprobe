Okay, so I'm trying to solve this sales commission problem. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about a salesman's income based on his sales. He gets a 10% commission on sales above $2,500, and a fixed salary of $300 per month. The total sales for the month are $5,070.20. I need to find his total income and then choose the correct option from A to J.

Alright, let's break it down step by step. First, I need to figure out how much of his sales are above $2,500 because he only gets commission on that part. So, the total sales are $5,070.20. 

I'll subtract $2,500 from that to find out the amount above that threshold. Let me calculate that: 5,070.20 minus 2,500.00. Hmm, 5,070 minus 2,500 is 2,570, and the 0.20 is left, so it's $2,570.20. 

Now, he gets a 10% commission on this amount. I'll calculate 10% of $2,570.20. To find 10%, I can multiply 2,570.20 by 0.10. Let me do that: 2,570.20 * 0.10 equals $257.02. 

Wait, but do I need to add that to his salary? Oh, right, he also has a fixed salary of $300 per month. So, his total income is the commission plus the salary. So, $257.02 (commission) plus $300.00 (salary) equals $557.02. 

Let me double-check that. Total sales are $5,070.20. Subtract base $2,500, get $2,570.20. 10% of that is 0.1 * 2,570.20 = $257.02. Add salary: 300 + 257.02 = 557.02. Yep, that looks right.

Now, looking at the options, option H is $557.02. So that's the one. I don't think I made any mistakes. The key steps were calculating the commission on the amount over $2,500, adding that to his fixed salary. So the answer should be H.

The total commission is 10% of ($5,070.20 - $2,500.00) = $257.02, plus a salary of $300.00. Total income is $257.02 + $300.00 = $557.02.

Answer: H
