Question:

A national distributor of windows selected a retailer to sell its windows in a specified geographic area. The parties negotiated a written distribution agreement, which stated that any order for windows placed by the retailer would be binding on the distributor "only when expressly accepted by the distributor." For the next two years, the retailer forwarded orders to the distributor, and the distributor always filled the orders. In the third year, the distributor accused the retailer of overcharging customers to install the distributor's windows. The retailer responded that the distributor had no control over the retailer's installation prices. When the distributor received the retailer's next order for windows, it refused to fill the order. If the retailer sues the distributor for breach of contract, will it be likely to prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.
B: No, because the agreement gave the distributor the right to expressly accept or reject orders.
C: Yes, because the distributor has always filled the orders in the past, creating an expectation of continued performance.
D: No, because the retailer's practice of overcharging customers excused the distributor's refusal to fill the order.
E: Yes, because the distributor cannot arbitrarily decide not to fill the retailer's orders.
F: Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order.
G: No, because the retailer's forwarding of orders to the distributor did not give rise to an obligation on the distributor's part to fill the orders.
H: No, because the distributor has the right to refuse orders at any time according to the agreement.
I: No, because the distributor has the right to reject orders based on the retailer's pricing practices.
J: Yes, because the distributor did not expressly reject the retailer's orders.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let's break it down step by step.

The situation involves a retailer and a distributor. They had a written agreement where the distributor "only when expressly accepted by the distributor" would fulfill orders. The parties agreed that the distributor would fill orders only if it agreed. Then, for two years, the retailer sent orders, and the distributor fulfilled them. Now, in the third year, the distributor called to sell to the retailer again, and the retailer said the distributor had no control over the prices. The distributor refused to fill the order. The question is whether the retailer can sue the distributor for breach of contract.

The options are A through J, each giving a possible answer. I need to determine which one is correct.

First, let's understand the contract law principles involved here. The main issue is whether the distributor had a duty to fulfill orders, and whether the retailer's action constitutes a breach.

The initial agreement was a written distribution agreement. It says, "any order... is binding on the distributor 'only when expressly accepted by the distributor'." So, the retailer must accept the order before the distributor can fulfill it. If the retailer refuses, the distributor can't fulfill. But wait, the question is about whether the retailer has a right to demand that the distributor accept orders, regardless of their past behavior.

In contract law, the key is whether the contract makes the party obligated to perform. The question is whether the distributor was bound to fill orders unless the retailer explicitly agreed.

In the agreement, the language is: "any order for windows placed by the retailer would be binding on the distributor 'only when expressly accepted by the distributor.'" So, the language implies that the distributor has to accept the order for it to be binding. So, if the retailer refuses, the distributor can't fulfill. So, in this case, the retailer could potentially sue the distributor for breach.

But wait, the question is whether the retailer has a claim because of past behavior or not. The past behavior in this case didn't change the fact that the obligation was to accept orders. Because the agreement was a written contract, the terms would typically apply unless there's some exception.

Moreover, the position is about the language of the contract. If the contract says that the obligation is only when the retailer accepts, then failing to accept would mean the obligation is breached.

So, the retailer's case would be based on the fact that the distributor had a duty to accept orders, and if the retailer refuses, that's a breach.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to accept orders. That would fit because the contract explicitly requires accepting orders for it to be binding. So, the retailer didn't accept, thus breach.

Option B says no because the agreement gave the distributor the right to reject. But that doesn't make sense because the language in the contract says the obligation is only when accepted. So, the right to reject isn't part of the contract. Therefore, the distributor has a duty to accept, not reject.

Option C says yes because the distributor always filled orders, creating an expectation. But the fact that the retailer kept requesting orders doesn't create an expectation unless it's a contract. If the agreement wasn't enforceable, then past behavior doesn't create an expectation. But in this case, the agreement was a written contract, so it's enforceable. So, the expectation is created when the retailer accepted the orders. Since the retailer didn't, that expectation is broken.

Option D says no because of overcharging. But the question is about whether the retailer can claim breach, not just compensation. The overcharging issue is a separate issue, but the question is whether the distributor breached contract.

Option E says yes because the distributor can refuse. But the contract says the obligation is only if accepted. So, the distributor is obligated to accept, not refuse. So, E is wrong.

Option F says yes because the distributor's claim is independent of overcharging. But again, the question is about contract breach, not about compensating the retailer. So, F is irrelevant here.

Option G says no because the retailer didn't accept. That's correct because the contract requires acceptance. The retailer refused, so the obligation is breached.

Option H says no because the distributor has the right to refuse. The language in the contract doesn't say the distributor can refuse; it's only about acceptance. So, H is incorrect.

Option I says no because the distributor can reject based on pricing. The contract doesn't specify that; it's only about acceptance. So, I is incorrect.

Option J says no because the distributor didn't accept. Correct, because the retailer refused.

So, looking at these, options A and J are both correct. But wait, the question is whether the retailer can sue for breach. Let me read the question again.

The question is, will the retailer's suit prevail? So, the retailer's claim would be based on the contract. If the contract says the obligation is only when the retailer accepts, then the retailer doesn't accept, so the obligation is breached.

So, the retailer's claim is valid. So, the answer would be either A or J.

But wait, the options are separate, so for each question, the correct answer is either A or J.

Wait, but looking again at the options, A says yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to accept the orders. J says no, because the distributor did not accept. So, which is correct?

In the contract, the language is that orders are binding only when accepted. So, the retailer didn't accept, so the obligation is breached.

So, the retailer can sue. Hence, the correct answer is A or J.

But the options are separate. So, if the retailer's claim is that the distributor is obligated to accept orders, then the answer would be A or J. Wait, no, because the option J says "No, because the distributor did not accept the orders."

Wait, the retailer's belief is that the distributor doesn't have to accept orders. The retailer is suing for breach, so the retailer's case relies on the contract terms.

From the question, the answer options are A through J. The question is whether the retailer can sue. So, if the contract requires acceptance, then the retailer's failure to accept is a breach. So, the retailer can sue, meaning the answer is A or J.

Wait, but looking again, the options are:

A: Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the orders.

J: No, because the distributor did not accept.

But the question is about whether the distributor is obligated to accept orders. So, if the contract says that orders are only binding if the retailer accepts, then the retailer's refusal is a breach.

So, the correct answer is that the retailer can sue, so the answer is A or J. But looking at the options, each is a possible answer.

Wait, the question is whether the answer is A, J, or another option.

Another point: the language in the contract is "only when expressly accepted by the distributor." So, the obligation is only if the retailer accepts. So, the retailer didn't accept, so the obligation is breached.

So, the retailer is correct in asserting breach.

Looking at the options, option A says yes because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to accept orders. Option J says no because the distributor did not accept.

If the court says the obligation is only when acceptance occurs, then the retailer's claim is valid. So, the correct answer would be A or J.

But looking at the options, the option A is: Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to accept the orders.

Option J: No, because the distributor did not accept.

So, which is correct? Because the agreement says the obligation is only when the retailer accepts, so the retailer's failure to accept means breach.

So, the correct answer is A or J. But the options are separate. Let's read the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Yes because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to accept.

J: No because the distributor did not accept.

Another point: The parties' course of dealing (i.e., the retailer's requests) is not a binding obligation for the distributor, but the contract law says that the obligation is only when the retailer accepts.

So, the answer would be A, because the contract requires the obligation to be accepted. But let me think about the wording. The written distribution agreement states: "any order for windows placed by the retailer would be binding on the distributor 'only when expressly accepted by the distributor'." So, the obligation is only when the retailer accepts.

Therefore, the retailer's failure to accept the orders violates the contract, so the retailer can sue for breach.

So, option A says yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to accept. Option J says no, because the distributor did not accept.

So, if the court says that the obligation is only when acceptance is made, then the retailer's failure to accept is a breach, so the answer is A or J.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct answer from the options is A or J.

Wait, but in the options, the correct answer is A or J.

Wait, the options given are:

A: Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to accept the orders.

J: No, because the distributor did not accept.

So, both A and J are correct in a way. But which one is the right one for the question.

The question is about whether the retailer's claim is valid.

In this case, the retailer's claim is based on the contract. The contract says the obligation is only when the retailer accepts. The retailer didn't accept, so it's a breach.

So, the correct answer is that the retailer can sue, which would be option A or J. But looking at the options, which one is correct.

Wait, the options are A to J, each an independent answer. So, which one is correct.

Wait, another thought: the question is about whether the retailer has a claim. The retailer's claim is that the distributor breached the contract by refusing to accept. So, the retailer's claim is valid.

But the options are about whether the retailer will prevail.

Now, looking at the options, the correct answer is either A or J.

Wait, the correct reasoning is that the retailer had an obligation to accept orders, as per the contract. The retailer failed to accept them, so they can sue.

Thus, the answer is A or J.

Wait, but another angle: does the contract give the distributor the right to refuse, even if the retailer didn't accept? The contract says that the obligation is only when the retailer accepts, so the distributor is obligated to accept.

So, since the retailer didn't accept, the obligation is breached, so the retailer can sue.

So, the answer is A.

Wait, but let's think about this. The language in the contract is "the obligation is only when the retailer accepts." So, the obligation is contingent upon the retailer's acceptance. So, the retailer's refusal is a breach.

So, the answer would be option A, because the obligation is only when the retailer accepts. The retailer didn't accept, so it's a breach. Hence, the retailer can sue.

Alternatively, option J says no because the distributor did not accept. So, J is incorrect.

But wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between breach of contract and duty to accept.

Wait, the question is whether the retailer can sue for breach of contract. So, the answer is yes, because the retailer didn't accept, which is a breach. So, the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, the retailer's claim is that the distributor failed to accept, so the court should find that the obligation is breached. Therefore, the retailer can sue.

So, the correct answer is option A.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the retailer can sue the distributor for breach of contract. The parties had a written distribution agreement that specified the distributor would fulfill orders only if the retailer had accepted them. The retailer's failure to accept orders constitutes a breach of the contract. 

Key points to consider:
1. **Contract Language**: The agreement explicitly states that the obligation is "only when the retailer accepts." This means the distributor is obligated to accept orders unless the retailer explicitly rejects them.
2. **Retailer's Failure to Accept**: The retailer refused to accept the orders, which means the obligation to fulfill the orders was breached.
3. **Correct Answer**: Since the retailer did not accept the orders, the obligation was violated, and the retailer can sue the distributor for breach of contract.

Analysis of options:
- **Option A**: Correct. The parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to accept orders, and the retailer's refusal is a breach.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The distributor is obligated to accept orders, not to reject them.
- Other options either misinterpret the contract (e.g., option B incorrectly claims the distributor has the right to reject) or are irrelevant to the breach claim.

ANSWER: A
