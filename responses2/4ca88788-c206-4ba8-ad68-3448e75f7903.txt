Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down. The question is about the acceleration of a ball when you drop it versus when you throw it downward. 

So, the setup is: when you drop a ball from rest, it accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s². That's the standard acceleration due to gravity, right? But the question is, if you throw the ball downward without considering air resistance, what happens to its acceleration immediately after leaving your hand?

Hmm, I remember that acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. So, initially, when you throw the ball downward, it's moving, but what's the initial velocity? If you throw it down at a certain speed, that initial velocity would affect the acceleration. Or wait, no, wait a second. Oh, right, acceleration is independent of the initial velocity. Because acceleration is due to the forces acting on the object. In this case, the forces are gravity and possibly any other forces like the throw itself.

Wait, but if you're throwing the ball downward, does that influence the acceleration? Let me think. When you throw it, you apply a force, but that force, combined with gravity, would determine the acceleration. So, the force you apply would be in response to the inertia of the ball. So, the acceleration is determined by the net force over mass.

Wait, so the net force would be the gravitational force minus any other forces. Wait, when you throw it downward, your force might be helping to accelerate it more. But since the question says you're throwing it, but doesn't specify whether it's imparted a velocity or not. Let me try to think in terms of Newton's laws.

When you drop it, it's just under the influence of gravity. So the acceleration is 9.8 m/s² downward. Now, if you throw it downward, you apply a force in the same direction as gravity. So the net force on the ball is the gravitational force plus the force you apply (which is the force you use to throw it downward). So, the net force would be greater than the gravitational force. Therefore, the acceleration would be greater than 9.8 m/s².

Wait, but the question says, "immediately after leaving your hand." So at that moment, the ball has an initial velocity (the speed you threw it) downward. But the acceleration is about the net force.

So, the acceleration depends on the net force. If you throw it with a certain speed, that initial velocity is imparted, but acceleration is still governed by the gravitational acceleration. Wait, no, if you throw it, you're applying a force. Let's say you throw it with a speed v. The net force would be (mass)(g + a), where a is the acceleration you apply. But wait, no—that's not right. Let me think again.

The net force is the gravitational force (mg) plus any other forces. So, if you throw it downward with a force, say, F, then the net force is F + mg. But the acceleration a' is F/m + g. Or wait, the equation is F_net = m a'. So if F is the force you exert, then a' = (F + mg)/m = F/m + g. But F is the force you apply.

But the question is, what is the acceleration immediately after you throw it down? If you throw it at speed v, that's the initial velocity, but acceleration is about the net force, not the velocity.

Wait, but the throw would also impart a velocity, but that velocity is in addition to the acceleration from gravity. So, the acceleration after the throw is still g. Because the force of gravity is constant as long as air resistance is negligible. The initial velocity (the speed you threw it) is a separate consideration—like, if you throw it faster, the initial speed will affect its velocity, but not the acceleration.

Wait, but acceleration is about the change in velocity. So, during the throw, the ball is accelerating due to gravity, and if you throw it downward, you're providing another force, which increases the net force, thereby increasing the acceleration. So the acceleration would be greater than 9.8 m/s².

So, looking at the options:

A: more than 9.8 m/s² → possible.

B: less than 9.8 → no, because the force you apply would add to the net force.

C: Greater if the ball is thrown with a force. – Well, if you throw it with a force, then yes, acceleration is greater. But the question says "assuming no air resistance," but doesn't specify the force. However, if you're applying a force to throw it, it's not the initial force that's causing the acceleration, but the net force. So, if you throw it, the acceleration would be higher than 9.8.

Wait, but the question is phrased as, "immediately after leaving your hand." So, the throw is a force you exert, and at that moment, the net force is the sum of the force you apply and gravity. So, acceleration would be (F + mg) / m = F/m + g. So, the acceleration would be greater than g, because F/m is positive (assuming F is positive, which it is as you throw it downward).

But wait, in the question, the throw is downward. So, if you are applying a force in the same direction as gravity, the net force is larger than mg, thus the acceleration is larger than 9.8.

So, the correct answer would be that the acceleration is greater than 9.8 m/s². Looking at the options, option A says more than 9.8, which is correct.

But wait, there's another possibility. Let's think again. Suppose you throw the ball downward, but you don't exert any force. Then the acceleration would still be 9.8 m/s². But the question says you are throwing it, so you must be applying some force. So, the acceleration would be greater.

So the correct answer is A.

When you drop a ball from rest, it accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s² due to gravity. However, if you throw the ball downward without air resistance, the acceleration immediately after leaving your hand depends on the net force acting on the ball. The net force is the sum of the gravitational force (mg) and any additional force you exert to throw it downward. 

If you apply a force to throw the ball, the net force becomes greater than the gravitational force alone, leading to an acceleration greater than 9.8 m/s². This is because the acceleration is determined by the net force divided by the mass of the ball. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: more than 9.8 m/s²** — This is correct because the net force (including the force you apply) results in an acceleration greater than 9.8 m/s².
- **B: less than 9.8 m/s²** — Incorrect, as the additional force you apply increases the net force.
- **C: Greater if the ball is thrown with a force** — While it is true that the acceleration depends on the force you apply, the question does not specify that you are applying a force, so this is not a valid assumption.
- **D: 19.6 m/s²** — Incorrect, as the acceleration is not double 9.8 m/s²; it depends on the net force.
- **E: Cannot say unless the speed of throw is given** — Incorrect, as the acceleration is determined by the net force, which depends on the throw, but the question does not provide specific details about the throw.
- **F: Dependent on the angle of the throw** — Incorrect, as the angle does not affect the acceleration in this scenario.
- **G: Not accelerated, it maintains the speed of the throw** — Incorrect, as acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, and gravity causes the ball to accelerate downward.
- **H: Equal to the speed of the throw** — Incorrect, as acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, not the speed itself.
- **I: Equal to the speed of the throw** — Incorrect, as acceleration and speed are different concepts; acceleration is due to the net force, while speed refers to the magnitude of velocity.
- **J: 9.8 m/s²** — Incorrect, as the acceleration is greater than 9.8 m/s² when a force is applied.

The correct answer is **A: more than 9.8 m/s²**, as the net force (including the force you apply) results in an acceleration greater than the acceleration due to gravity alone.
