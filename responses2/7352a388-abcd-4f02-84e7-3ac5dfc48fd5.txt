Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a ladder sliding down a wall. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The problem says that a 9-meter ladder is leaning against a vertical wall on level ground. The bottom end is moving away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second. I need to find how fast the top end is sliding downward when the top is 3 meters above the ground. The options are given, but I'll walk through my reasoning.

First, I remember that when dealing with related rates problems, we use calculus, specifically the chain rule. So, the ladder, wall, and ground form a right triangle. Let me denote the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall as x, and the height of the top of the ladder on the wall as y. 

So, the ladder's length is the hypotenuse, which is 9 meters. That gives me the equation:

x² + y² = 9²
x² + y² = 81

Now, since both x and y are changing over time, I'll need to differentiate both sides with respect to time t. Let's denote dx/dt as the rate at which the bottom is moving away from the wall. According to the problem, dx/dt is 2 m/s. I need to find dy/dt, the rate at which the top is sliding downward.

Differentiating both sides with respect to t:

2x*(dx/dt) + 2y*(dy/dt) = 0

Wait, because the derivative of x² is 2x dx/dt and the derivative of y² is 2y dy/dt. So the equation becomes:

2x*(2) + 2y*(dy/dt) = 0
Wait, no, wait. The left side is the derivative of x², which is 2x dx/dt, plus the derivative of y², which is 2y dy/dt, and that's equal to zero because the length of the ladder is constant.

So, 2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0

I can simplify this equation a bit. Let's divide both sides by 2:

x dx/dt + y dy/dt = 0

Now, I can solve for dy/dt:

y dy/dt = -x dx/dt
dy/dt = (-x dx/dt) / y

I know dx/dt is 2 m/s. Now I need to find x and y when the top is 3 meters above the ground. Since y is 3, I can find x using the Pythagorean theorem.

So, x² + y² = 81
x² + 3² = 81
x² + 9 = 81
x² = 81 -9 =72
x= sqrt(72) = 6√2 meters.

Now, plugging x, y, and dx/dt into the equation for dy/dt:

dy/dt = (- (6√2) * 2 ) / 3

Let me compute that step by step.

Multiply 6√2 by 2: 6*2=12, so 12√2.

So numerator is -12√2.

Denominator is 3.

So dy/dt = (-12√2)/3 = -4√2 m/s.

The negative sign indicates that y is decreasing, which makes sense because the top is sliding downward. The magnitude is 4√2 m/s. Looking at the options, option C is 4√2. So the answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we use the relationship between the sides of the right triangle formed by the ladder, wall, and ground. Let x be the distance from the bottom to the wall, y the height of the top on the wall, and dx/dt = 2 m/s the rate at which the bottom moves away. Differentiating the Pythagorean equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 81\) gives \(2x \cdot dx/dt + 2y \cdot dy/dt = 0\). Solving for \(dy/dt\), we get \(dy/dt = -\frac{x \cdot dx/dt}{y}\). When \(y = 3\), \(x = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2}\). Substituting, \(dy/dt = -\frac{6\sqrt{2} \cdot 2}{3} = -4\sqrt{2}\). The negative sign indicates downward motion, so the rate is \(4\sqrt{2}\) m/s.

Answer: C
