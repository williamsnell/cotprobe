Okay, so I have this question about the volume of a cube. Let me think about how to approach it. The cube has edges that are 150.0 mm long on each side. Wait, the question asks for the volume in cubic centimeters. Hmm, I remember that the volume of a cube is calculated by side length cubed. But wait, the units here are in millimeters, and I need to convert that to centimeters because the answer needs to be in cc, which is cubic centimeters.

So, first, I should convert 150.0 mm to centimeters. I know that 1 cm is 10 mm, so I divide by 10. Let me do that: 150.0 mm divided by 10 equals 15.0 cm. Got it. Each edge is 15 cm long.

Now, the volume formula is side length cubed, which is (15 cm)^3. Let me calculate that. 15 multiplied by 15 is 225, and then multiplied by 15 again. Let me compute 225 * 15. Breaking it down: 200 * 15 is 3000, and 25 * 15 is 375. Adding those together gives 3375. So, the volume is 3375 cubic centimeters.

Looking at the options, option E is 3375 cc. So the correct answer should be E.

The volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the length of one edge. The edge length is 150.0 mm, which converts to 15.0 cm. Cubing 15.0 cm gives 3375 cubic centimeters. 

Answer: E
