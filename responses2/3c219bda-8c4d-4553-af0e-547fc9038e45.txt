Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem here. Let me read it again and see if I can figure it out step by step.

The question says that the graph of y = f(x) includes the points (1,5), (2,3), and (3,1). So that means when x is 1, f(1) is 5; when x is 2, f(2) is 3; and when x is 3, f(3) is 1.

Now, the question is about finding two points on the graph of y = f(f(x)). Specifically, these two points will be in the form (a, b) and (c, d), and we need to compute ab + cd. 

Hmm, okay. So to find y = f(f(x)), I need to compute f(f(x)) for some x. Since the original function f(x) is given at three points, I need to figure out what happens when I plug f(x) back into f. 

Let me think. For each x, f(x) gives me a value, say y. Then f(f(x)) is f(y). So to find f(f(x)), I first find y = f(x), and then find f(y). But to do that, y must be one of the known values in f. 

Looking at the given points, x can only be 1, 2, or 3 because f(x) is defined at those points. But wait, f(x) could also take other values if f isn't defined only at those points, but since the problem only gives us three points, I can assume f is defined only at x=1,2,3. So, the range of f(x) is limited to 1, 3, and 5, since f(1)=5, f(2)=3, f(3)=1. So, if I plug these into f again, it will evaluate to one of those numbers.

Let me list all possible f(f(x)):

1. When x=1: f(1)=5, so f(f(1))=f(5). But wait, do we know f(5)? The original function is given only at 1, 2, 3, so unless f is defined beyond that, f(5) isn't known. So f(f(1)) is f(5), which isn't given. So this point (1, f(f(1))) isn't on the graph because f(5) isn't known. Hmm, so this might not help.

2. When x=2: f(2)=3, so f(f(2))=f(3)=1. So this gives us (2,1). That's a valid point.

3. When x=3: f(3)=1, so f(f(3))=f(1)=5. So this gives us (3,5). Also a valid point.

Wait, so from x=2 and x=3, we can get valid points on y=f(f(x)). So these two points are (2,1) and (3,5). 

But wait, the problem says there are two points that must be on the graph of y=f(f(x)). So I have to make sure that these points are definitely on the graph based on the given information. Let me confirm.

For x=1: f(1)=5, so f(f(1))=f(5). Since we don't know f(5), we can't say for sure if (1, f(5)) is on the graph. So we can't include that. 

For x=2: f(2)=3, so f(f(2))=f(3)=1. We know f(3)=1, so this is valid. So (2,1) is on the graph.

For x=3: f(3)=1, so f(f(3))=f(1)=5. So (3,5) is on the graph.

Wait, but the question says "there are two points that must be on the graph of y=f(f(x))." So the points (2,1) and (3,5) are definitely on the graph because they can be derived from the given f(x) values. 

Now, the problem asks for ab + cd, where the two points are (a, b) and (c, d). So let's assign a=2, b=1, c=3, d=5. Then ab is 2*1=2, cd is 3*5=15. So 2 + 15 = 17.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The points (2,1) and (3,5) are definitely on the graph because f(2)=3 and f(3)=1, which then map through f again. So yes, these are the only two points that must be on the graph based on the given information.

So adding ab and cd: 2*1=2, 3*5=15, 2+15=17. Looking at the options, option B is 17. So the answer should be B.

The two points on y=f(f(x)) are (2,1) and (3,5). Calculating 2*1 + 3*5 = 2 + 15 = 17.

ANSWER: B
