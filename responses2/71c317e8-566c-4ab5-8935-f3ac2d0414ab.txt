Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it. The question is about a box sliding on a horizontal surface. The box has a mass m and an initial speed v0. It only feels two forces: gravity and the kinetic friction from the surface. I need to find out how far it slides before coming to rest.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when an object slides, friction does work on it, possibly slowing it down. Since it's sliding on a horizontal surface, the normal force is mg, because the weight balances out the normal force. The kinetic friction force is μk times the normal force, right? But wait, sometimes μ is just given as the coefficient, so I think the friction force is μmg here.

Okay, so the box starts with speed v0 and stops when its kinetic energy is zero. The work done by friction will be equal to the change in kinetic energy. Oh wait, because the box is moving, the initial kinetic energy is (1/2)mv0². And the work done by friction is force times distance, but friction is opposite to motion, so it's negative.

Wait, let me think again. Work done by friction is force of friction multiplied by the distance. Since friction is opposing the motion, the work done is negative. So the work done by friction is -f * d, where f is the frictional force, and d is the distance.

So the work done equals the change in kinetic energy. The initial kinetic energy is (1/2 mv0²), and when it stops, it's zero. So the work done by friction is (1/2 mv0²) - 0 = 1/2 mv0². But since it's negative, the equation would be -f*d = -1/2 mv0². Which simplifies to f*d = 1/2 mv0².

So f is the frictional force. That's μmg. So substituting, μmg*d = (1/2 mv0²). Let me write that equation:

μmg * d = (1/2) m v0²

I can solve for d. Let's see, m appears on both sides. I can divide both sides by m:

μg * d = (1/2) v0²

Then, d = (v0²) / (2 μg)

Wait, that looks right. Let me think about the units to make sure. The units of d should be meters. Let's see, v0 squared is m²/s². Divided by μ (unitless), g is m/s². So denominator is (μg) which is m/s². So numerator is m²/s², denominator m/s² → (m²/s²)/(m/s²) = m. Correct.

Looking at the options, option B is μv0²/(2g), which isn't matching. Option A is 2v0²/(μg), which doesn't match. Option C is v0²/(2gμ), which is same as what I have. Wait, my equation is v0²/(2 μ g). So yes, option C says v0²/(2 g μ), same as mine.

Wait, wait, let me check the options again. Oh, the options are A to J, so option C is "v0^2/(2gμ)", which matches.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake. Because the equation I derived is d = (v0²)/(2 μ g). So yes, that's option C.

But wait, I feel like another way to approach this. Oh, another way is using energy. The initial kinetic energy is (1/2) m v0². The frictional force is μmg, and the work done by friction is force times distance, but since friction opposes motion, the work done is negative. So the work done by friction is -f d. So the work done equals the change in kinetic energy. The initial KE is (1/2 mv0²), and the final KE is zero, so the change is -1/2 mv0². Therefore, the equation is:

- f d = - (1/2 mv0²)

Which simplifies to f d = (1/2 mv0²), same as before. So that's correct.

So the correct formula is d = (v0²)/(2 μg). That's option C.

To determine how far the box slides before coming to rest, we analyze the situation using energy and work principles. The box starts with an initial kinetic energy of \( \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 \), and friction opposes its motion, doing negative work until it comes to rest. The work done by friction equals the change in kinetic energy:

\[
-f \cdot d = -\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2
\]

Here, \( f \) is the frictional force, which is given by \( f = \mu mg \), where \( \mu \) is the coefficient of kinetic friction, \( m \) is the mass of the box, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. Substituting \( f = \mu mg \) into the equation and canceling \( m \), we get:

\[
\mu g \cdot d = \frac{1}{2}v_0^2
\]

Solving for \( d \), the distance the box slides:

\[
d = \frac{v_0^2}{2\mu g}
\]

This matches the form of option C. Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: C**
