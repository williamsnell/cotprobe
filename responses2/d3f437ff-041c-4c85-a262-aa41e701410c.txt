Okay, so I've got this problem about an axial-flow fan in a wind tunnel and I need to figure out the new motor speed and power required. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says the current test section is 65 feet per second (fps) when driven by a 3-hp motor at 1200 rpm. The question is, what speed and power are needed to get the velocity up to 100 fps. The options are A through I, each with different speeds and powers.

First, I remember that in axial flow fans, the power and velocity are related somehow. I think it's something about the relationship between power, velocity, and the area of the fan. Oh wait, maybe it's about the velocity equation. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I think it involves the power (which is related to torque) and the velocity.

Wait, the basic equation for the power required by a fan is probably P = (1/2) * ρ * A * v * η, where ρ is air density, A is the area, v is velocity, and η is the efficiency. But wait, I'm not sure if this is the right approach because the power might not directly scale with velocity in that way.

Alternatively, I remember that for compressors, the relationship between speed and flow rate isn't linear because of the changes in density as the gas is compressed. But for fans, since they're compressible, the relationship is a bit more complex. Oh wait, maybe the power is proportional to the velocity times the area, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another approach: the power output of the motor is related to the torque times the angular velocity. The motor's power (in horsepower) is equal to torque multiplied by the angular velocity in radians per second, divided by 5252 (since 1 horsepower equals 550 ft-lb per second, and 2π radians per revolution). But I'm not sure how that ties into the velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the fan's rotational speed and how it relates to the velocity. For an axial-flow fan, the velocity is given by v = k * ω, where ω is the angular velocity in rpm, and k is a constant that depends on the fan's design (like the ratio of fan area to propeller area, etc.). So if the fan's speed increases, the velocity increases proportionally.

Wait, but wait. The relationship between velocity and rotational speed is linear because for a given fan, the velocity is directly proportional to the angular velocity. So if the fan's speed increases, the velocity produced increases by the same factor.

So, if the velocity is 65 fps at 1200 rpm, how much would it be at a higher speed? Let's call the new speed as ω2 and the new velocity v2. Then, the ratio would be v2 / v1 = ω2 / ω1.

So, v1 is 65, v2 is 100. So 100/65 = ω2/1200. Let me calculate that. 100 divided by 65 is approximately 1.5385. So ω2 ≈ 1200 * 1.5385 ≈ 1846.2 rpm. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 1846 rpm, and others don't match. So option D's speed is 1846 rpm, which seems correct for the velocity part.

But wait, that's just the velocity. What about the power? The power required should also scale with the velocity, but I'm not sure exactly how. Let me think about the power required for the fan. The power output of the motor is the same as the power required by the fan. So if the velocity increases, the power would increase as well.

Wait, the power can be found using P = (1/2) * ρ * A * v^3 / η, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the power is proportional to the velocity. Let's try to find the scaling factor.

Assuming the fan's power scales with the velocity. So if the velocity increases from v1 to v2, the power would scale as (v2/v1)^3. Because power is proportional to velocity, so v2/v1 is 100/65 = 20/13 ≈ 1.5385. So new power would be (20/13)^3 times the original power. Wait, but the original power is 3 HP. Let me compute (20/13)^3. 20^3 is 8000, 13^3 is 2197. So 8000/2197 is approximately 3.64. So 3 HP * 3.64 ≈ 10.9 HP. That would be the new power.

Wait, but that would be the case if the power is proportional to velocity. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Another approach: let's think about the relationship between power and velocity for a fan. The power required can be expressed in terms of the fan's torque and its angular velocity.

The power (in HP) is (Torque * Angular velocity) / 5252. Torque is also related to the fan's speed. For a given fan, the torque is proportional to the cube of the angular velocity. Because torque (T) is equal to (1/2) * ρ * A * v^3 * η, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's T = C * ω^3, where C is a constant.

Wait, I think the torque (in lb-ft) for a fan is proportional to ω^3, where ω is in rpm. So, if the motor's power (in HP) is (Torque * ω) / 5252. But Torque is proportional to ω^3, so P (in HP) is proportional to ω^4.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let's see: if P = k * ω^4, where k is a constant that includes factors like density, area, efficiency, etc. So if I have two states, I can set up a ratio.

So for state 1:

P1 = k * (ω1)^4

State 2:

P2 = k * (ω2)^4

So the ratio P2/P1 = (ω2/ω1)^4

We know P1 is 3 HP, P2 is what we're solving for. ω1 is 1200 rpm; ω2 is the new speed.

So P2 = 3 * (ω2/1200)^4

But wait, that's only if the power scales with ω^4. But earlier I thought it scales with ω^3. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the exact relationship.

Alternatively, let's go back. If the velocity is proportional to ω, then the power needed is proportional to the velocity times something else. Wait, another way: the power required for the fan is given by P = (1/2) * ρ * A * v * η. So if I can find the ratio of the new power to the old power, I can find the required power.

So for the first case,

P1 = (1/2) * ρ * A1 * v1 * η

For the second case,

P2 = (1/2) * ρ * A2 * v2 * η

Assuming A2/A1 is the same as A1/A2, because it's a linear fan, or maybe it's different. Wait, no. Actually, the area of the fan is fixed, so A1 = A2. So the ratio simplifies.

So P2/P1 = (v2 / v1)

Because all other terms (ρ, η, A) are same. So P2 = P1 * (v2/v1) = 3 * (100/65) = 3 * 1.5385 ≈ 4.615 HP. But that can't be right because option A and B are in 15-19 HP.

Wait, that can't be correct because earlier I thought the scaling was different. Hmm, maybe my assumption that A is same is wrong. Because in reality, for a fan, as the rotational speed increases, the propeller area is larger, but the actual fan's area is the same. So perhaps the area in the formula is the same? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relationship between the power and the velocity.

Wait, another approach: The power of the motor is the same as the power required by the fan. So P = (1/2) * ρ * A * v^3 / η. Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, the power is equal to the torque multiplied by angular velocity. Torque (τ) is related to the velocity. For a fan, the torque is proportional to the cube of the angular velocity, so τ = k * ω^3. Then, power P = τ * ω = k * ω^4. So P is proportional to ω^4.

So P2 = P1 * (ω2/ω1)^4

So if P1 is 3 HP, and ω1 is 1200 rpm, then ω2 is what we need to find. So let's solve for ω2 in terms of P2.

But we don't know P2 yet. Hmm, but maybe the motor's power is the same when the fan is running at that speed. So, if the motor's power is 3 HP at 1200 rpm, what's the required power when the fan is faster?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the motor's power (which is 3 HP at 1200 rpm) and calculate the new power required when v increases to 100 fps. So the motor's power, which is the same as the power needed by the fan, must scale with the velocity.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to think about the fan's power in terms of the torque and the rotation speed.

The fan's power can be written as P = T * ω, where T is torque and ω is angular velocity in radians per second.

Torque T is related to the velocity. For an axial-flow fan, the torque is proportional to ω^3, so T = k * ω^3. Then, P = k * ω^4.

So P is proportional to ω^4.

We have P1 = 3 HP at ω1 = 1200 rpm.

We need to find P2 at ω2, where v2 = 100 fps.

But since v is proportional to ω, v2 = v1 * (ω2/ω1). So ω2 = (v2 / v1) * ω1.

The ratio v2/v1 is 100/65 ≈ 1.53846.

So ω2 = 1.53846 * 1200 ≈ 1846.15 rpm. So option D's speed is 1846 rpm. That matches.

Now, since P is proportional to ω^4, P2 = P1 * (ω2/ω1)^4.

So P2 = 3 * (1846.15 / 1200)^4.

Wait, 1846.15 / 1200 = 1.53846. So (1.53846)^4.

Let me compute that:

1.53846^2 = approx 2.366.

Then 2.366^2 = about 5.598.

So P2 ≈ 3 * 5.598 ≈ 16.79 HP.

Hmm, but the options don't have 16.79 HP. Let's look at the options again:

Options:

A: 1500 rpm (speed 1500, power ≈ 8.5 → Maybe? 1500/1200 = 1.25. (1.25)^4=2.4414 → 3 *2.44=7.32 HP. No, not matching.

B: 1650 rpm → 1650/1200≈1.375. (1.375)^4≈3.618. 3*3.618≈10.85 HP. Not an option.

C: 2100 rpm → 2100/1200=1.75. (1.75)^4=9.3789. 3*9.3789≈28.13 HP. No.

D: 1846 rpm → 1.5385^4=5.598 → 3 *5.598≈16.79 HP. Hmm, but the options don't have that.

E: 1900 rpm → 1.5833. (1.5833)^4≈ (approx 6.7) → 3 *6.7≈20.1 HP.

Wait, none of these options match exactly. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me re-calculate (1.53846)^4.

1.53846^2 = (1.53846 * 1.53846).

1.5^2 is 2.25.

1.53846 is a bit more than 1.5.

Approximating:

1.53846 * 1.53846 = (1.5 + 0.03846)^2 = 1.5^2 + 2*(1.5)(0.03846) + (0.03846)^2.

= 2.25 + 0.11538 + 0.001478 ≈ 2.366858.

Now, square that:

(2.366858)^2 = let's calculate.

2^2 =4.

0.366858^2 ≈ 0.1345.

Cross term: 2 * 2 * 0.366858 = 1.467432.

So total ≈ 4 + 1.467432 + 0.1345 ≈ 5.6019.

So (1.53846)^4 ≈5.6019. So P2 = 3 *5.6019≈16.806 HP.

But the options don't have that. So which option is closest?

Looking at the options again:

Option D is 1846 rpm and 16.79 HP.

Option A is 1500 rpm and 8.5 hp.

Wait, perhaps I did something wrong in the initial assumption. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: The power of the motor is the same as the power required by the fan. So P = (1/2) * ρ * A * v^3 / η.

If it's a proportional relation, then P is proportional to v^3.

So, P1 = 3 HP, v1=65. P2 = ?

v2=100 → P2 = 3 * (100/65)^3.

100/65 is 20/13≈1.5385.

(20/13)^3 ≈ (8000)/(2197) ≈ 3.643.

So P2 ≈3 *3.643≈10.93 HP.

But wait, earlier when I thought it's proportional to v^4, I got around 16.8 HP, but with v^3, it's 10.9 HP.

So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the scaling between the fans. Let's think about the power required for each.

For the first case, P1 = K * v1^3 (some constant K).

For the second case, P2 = K * v2^3.

So P2 = P1*(v2/v1)^3 = 3 * (100/65)^3 ≈3*( 1.5385 )^3.

Calculate (20/13)^3 = 8000/2197≈3.643.

3 *3.643≈10.93 HP.

So approximately 10.9 HP.

Looking at the options:

Which option has power around 10.9 HP? Let's see:

Looking at option D: 1846 rpm and 10.9 HP. That's exactly what I calculated.

Earlier, I thought it's proportional to ω^4, which gives 16.8 HP, but that's incorrect. The correct approach is to think of it as v^3, because the power is proportional to velocity cubed.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait a moment. Another thought: when you increase the rotational speed, the air density decreases, so the fan's power required would change. But perhaps the correct scaling is with velocity cubed, not the speed.

So based on that, option D is correct.
</think>

To determine the required motor speed and power for the axial-flow fan, we analyze the relationship between velocity and power. The power required by the fan is proportional to the cube of the velocity, as the air density decreases with increasing rotational speed (v). 

### Key Steps:
1. **Velocity Scaling**: The velocity is proportional to the rotational speed (ω). Given the initial velocity \( v_1 = 65 \, \text{fps} \) at \( \omega_1 = 1200 \, \text{rpm} \), the new velocity \( v_2 = 100 \, \text{fps} \) corresponds to:
   \[
   \frac{v_2}{v_1} = \frac{\omega_2}{\omega_1} = \frac{100}{65} \approx 1.5385
   \]
   Thus, the new rotational speed is:
   \[
   \omega_2 = 1.5385 \times 1200 \approx 1846 \, \text{rpm}
   \]

2. **Power Scaling**: The power required is proportional to the cube of the velocity. Using the initial power \( P_1 = 3 \, \text{HP} \), the new power \( P_2 \) is:
   \[
   P_2 = P_1 \times \left(\frac{v_2}{v_1}\right)^3 = 3 \times \left(\frac{100}{65}\right)^3
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   \left(\frac{100}{65}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{20}{13}\right)^3 \approx 3.643
   \]
   \[
   P_2 \approx 3 \times 3.643 \approx 10.93 \, \text{HP}
   \]

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option D**: 1846 rpm and 10.93 HP. This matches the calculated values, with the power being approximately 10.93 HP.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **D**, as it accurately represents the required motor speed and power for the increased velocity.
