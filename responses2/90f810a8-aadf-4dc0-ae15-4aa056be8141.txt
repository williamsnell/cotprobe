Okay, so I've got this economics question here about firms earning a normal profit. Hmm, I remember that normal profit is a type of profit that's considered like a break-even, but it's a little different from the economic profit. Let me think.

Normal profit is the minimum profit necessary to cover all explicit costs and to keep the firm from having an incentive to shut down. Wait, no, wait. Actually, I think normal profit is when the firm is earning just enough to cover all its costs, including both explicit and implicit costs. Economic profits are when profits are above that, but normal profit is a specific case.

So, when a firm is earning a normal profit, their total revenues are equal to their total costs. But what are those costs? Explicit costs are the direct payments, like paying workers or buying materials. Implicit costs are the opportunity costs, like the value of the next best alternative the firm could have used instead.

Wait, in normal profit, the firm is covering all explicit costs and some part of the implicit costs. But I think the total costs in normal profit include both. So, the firm's total revenue equals total costs, which are the sum of explicit and implicit costs. Because normal profit is like the break-even point where revenues equal total costs.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Total revenues from production are equal to the sum of explicit and implicit costs.

That seems right because normal profit is when the firm isn't making an economic profit, so revenues equal total costs. So, option D matches that.

Other options: A says revenues equal implicit costs. That would be the case if the firm wasn't covering explicit costs, which isn't normal profit. B says revenues equal explicit costs, which would be if the firm wasn't covering implicit costs, which isn't the case here. C says explicit costs are higher than implicit. No, because normal profit includes both, so I don't think that's true. E and F are about costs being equal or higher than each other, but the question is about revenues. J says implicit costs are equal to total revenues minus explicit costs. Wait, that's exactly the implicit costs part. Because implicit costs are the opportunity costs, which would be the difference between total costs and explicit costs. So J's statement is about one of the implicit costs, not the total.

So the correct answer must be D.

The correct answer is D: total revenues from production are equal to the sum of explicit and implicit costs. This aligns with the definition of normal profit, where revenues cover all costs, including both direct (explicit) and indirect (implicit) expenses.

Answer: D
