Okay, I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about how purecapitalism works and whether it can express individual wants. Let me break it down.

The question is asking what types of goods might be inadequate for a system where individual preferences are the main driver of production. The options provided range from individual-based goods to things like public goods or non-essential goods. 

First, I need to understand what purecapitalism is. From what I remember, purecapitalism is an economic model where production is driven by the accumulation of capital, like money and physical assets, rather than individual preferences. So it's more about what's available and what's available in the market, not about the individual's desires or wants.

Now, the question is about when individual preferences become inadequate. I think this happens when certain goods can't be produced in an individualized way because they require more extensive resources or can't be easily allocated. 

Looking at the options, option A says goods and services that can be provided on an individual basis. Wait, if a good can be provided individually, why would individual preferences matter? Because if it's individual, then the system can adjust to individual needs. So A might not be the right answer.

Option B is luxury goods. Luxury goods are expensive, so maybe people have preferences for them. But in a purecapitalist system, luxury might still be provided through capital accumulation since it's a resource. So I'm not sure B is the answer.

Option C: Goods and services which cannot be provided on an individual basis. Hmm. If a good can't be provided one by one, like maybe it requires multiple units or is something that can't be split, then individual production wouldn't be possible. For example, something like government services that you can't supply one by one, or maybe a public good that requires a group effort. So in a purecapitalist system, perhaps these goods can't be produced individually because you can't distribute them without capital. So maybe C is the right choice.

Option D: Perishable goods and services with short-term utility. I'm not sure if they can't be provided individually. Perishable items like fruits or medicines might be more manageable, but I don't think the inability to produce them one by one is a main issue in purecapitalism. Plus, individual production might still allow for some allocation.

Option E: Public goods and services that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Public goods are typically provided by the government and can't be individually consumed. So their production isn't based on individual preferences but on collective decision-making. So E might not be the answer.

Option F: Non-essential goods and services that are overproduced. These might be things like food or services that are abundant, so production isn't limited by individual needs. So F might not be the right answer either.

Option G: Goods and services that require significant government regulation. Well, that's about regulation, not individual preferences. So G might not be the issue here.

Option H: Goods and services with high demand. High demand can be met by capital, so individual preferences might still play a role.

Option I: Basic necessities during crises. These are things like food or water needed in crisis. Production can be handled by individual needs, so I think this isn't the issue.

Option J: Goods and services with externalities affecting third parties. Externalities are about the impact on others, but individual preferences aren't about that. So J is probably not the answer.

Putting it all together, the question is about what goods can't be produced in an individual way. So if a good can't be provided one by one, the system can't express individual wants. That would be goods without individual production possibilities, like public goods or those that require group effort. Public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, like a park or a public library, and their production isn't individual. So the correct answer should be C: Goods and services which cannot be provided on an individual basis.

The question asks which goods might be inadequate to express individual preferences in a purecapitalist system. In such a system, production is driven by capital accumulation rather than individual desires. 

- **Option A** refers to goods that can be provided individually. Since individual production is possible in this model, this is unlikely to be the answer.
- **Option B** mentions luxury goods, which might still be produced via capital, making this an incorrect choice.
- **Option C** describes goods that cannot be provided individually. These are likely the goods that require collective action or are non-allocatable, such as public goods, making this the most plausible answer.
- Other options either pertain to specific types of goods or unrelated issues, which do not fit the question.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: Goods and services which cannot be provided on an individual basis**.

Answer: C
