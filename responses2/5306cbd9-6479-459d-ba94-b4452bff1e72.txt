Okay, so I have this differential equation to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The equation is y' equals (t² + 3y²) divided by (2t y). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can rearrange it to see if it fits into a standard form.

First, I'll write the equation again:

y' = (t² + 3y²) / (2t y)

Wait, y' is dy/dt. So, let's multiply both sides by 2t y to get everything on one side. That would give:

2t y dy/dt = t² + 3y²

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange this to separate variables. Let's see. Let's try to get all the y terms on one side and the t terms on the other. So, I'll divide both sides by (2t y) [but wait, no—if I move 2t y dy/dt to the other side, it's better to see:

dy/dt = (t² + 3y²) / (2t y)

I can write this as:

dy/dt = (t²)/(2t y) + (3y²)/(2t y) 

Simplify each term: t²/(2t y) is t/(2y), and 3y²/(2t y) is (3y)/(2t). So,

dy/dt = (t)/(2y) + (3y)/(2t)

Hmm, that's not immediately helpful. Maybe I need to rearrange the original equation differently. Let's go back to 2t y dy/dt = t² + 3y².

Wait, perhaps I can divide both sides by t² y² to make it a function of y²/t² or something. Let me try that.

Divide both sides by t² y²:

(2t y dy/dt) / (t² y²) ) = (t² + 3y²) / (t² y²)

Simplify left side: (2t y dy/dt) / (t² y²) = (2 dy/dt) / (t y) = 2/(t y) dy/dt

Right side: [t² + 3y²] / [t² y²] = [1/t² + 3/(t² y²)] = 1/t² (1 + 3/(y²)).

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe a different approach. Let's see if this is a homogeneous equation. A homogeneous equation is where all terms are of the same degree when variables are scaled. Let me check the degrees.

In the original equation y' = (t² + 3y²)/(2t y), each term in the numerator is degree 2 (t² is 2, y² is 2), denominator is 2t y, which is degree 2. So, the right-hand side is homogeneous of degree 0, meaning it's homogeneous. So, perhaps we can use substitution.

For homogeneous equations, we often set v = y/t or y = vt. Let's try that. Let y = v t, so dy/dt = v + t dv/dt.

Substituting into the equation:

v + t dv/dt = [t² + 3 (v t)^2 ] / [2 t (v t)]

Simplify denominator: 2t * (v t) = 2 t² v.

Numerator: t² + 3 v² t² = t² (1 + 3 v²).

So, the equation becomes:

v + t dv/dt = [ t² (1 + 3 v²) ] / [ 2 t² v ]

Simplify the right side: t² cancels, so (1 + 3v²)/(2v).

So,

v + t dv/dt = (1 + 3v²)/(2v)

Let's subtract v from both sides:

t dv/dt = (1 + 3v²)/(2v) - v

Compute the right side:

(1 + 3v²)/(2v) - v = [1 + 3v² - 2v²]/(2v) = (1 + v²)/(2v)

So,

t dv/dt = (1 + v²)/(2v)

That's a separable equation now. So, we can write:

(2v)/(1 + v²) dv = (1/t) dt

Now, integrate both sides.

Left integral: ∫ (2v)/(1 + v²) dv

Right integral: ∫ (1/t) dt

The left integral: Let me substitute u = 1 + v², du = 2v dv. So, the integral becomes ∫ (1/u) du = ln|u| + C = ln(1 + v²) + C.

The right integral: ln|t| + C.

So putting it together:

ln(1 + v²) = ln t + C

Wait, but we can write it as:

ln(1 + v²) = ln t + C

Exponentiating both sides:

1 + v² = C t

Where C is e^C, so another constant.

Wait, but let me be precise. Let's write it as:

1 + v² = C t

But we can write it as:

v² = C t - 1

Hmm, but let's remember that v = y/t. So, substituting back:

(y/t)^2 = C t - 1

Multiply both sides by t²:

y² = C t^3 - t²

So, y² = C t³ - t².

Now, we can use the initial condition y(1) = 1 to find C.

At t=1, y=1.

So, (1)^2 = C (1)^3 - (1)^2 → 1 = C - 1 → C = 2.

So, the equation becomes:

y² = 2 t³ - t²

So, y = sqrt(2 t³ - t²)

Wait, but let me double-check the integration steps. Because sometimes when you divide, you might miss terms.

Wait, let me go back. I think I got confused earlier. Let me retrace.

We had t dv/dt = (1 + v²)/(2v)

So, t dv/dt = (1 + v²)/(2v) → dv/dt = (1 + v²)/(2 v t)

Separating variables: (2v)/(1 + v²) dv = (1/t) dt

Integrate: ∫ [2v/(1 + v²)] dv = ∫ (1/t) dt

Left integral: Let u = 1 + v² → du = 2v dv → (2v dv)/u = du/u → ∫ (1/u) du = ln |u| + C = ln(1 + v²) + C

Right integral: ln |t| + C

So, ln(1 + v²) = ln t + C → 1 + v² = e^{ln t + C} = e^C * t

But e^C is another constant, say K. So, 1 + v² = K t.

v = y/t → v² = y²/t².

So, 1 + y²/t² = K t → Multiply through by t²: t² + y² = K t³.

Wait, that's the same as before, just K instead of C. So, y² = K t³ - t².

Applying initial condition at t=1, y=1.

So, 1 = K (1) - (1)^2 → K -1 =1 → K=2.

Thus, y² = 2 t³ - t².

So, y = sqrt(2 t³ - t²). But wait, wait, the equation is y' = (t² +3y²)/(2 t y). Hmm, let's make sure this solution satisfies the original DE.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if my solution makes sense.

But the question asks for y(2). So, let's plug t=2 into y².

y² = 2*(8) -4 =16-4=12 → y= sqrt(12) ≈ 3.464.

Looking at the options, option H is 4.321, option G is 7.890, option J is 3.464.

So the correct answer is J, 3.464.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another way. Let me try to integrate factors again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution step. Let me try another approach.

Looking back, I had:

After substitution, the equation became:

1 + v² = C t

Which led to v = sqrt(C t -1). Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration.

Wait, let me go back to the integral step.

We have:

(2v)/(1 + v²) dv = (1/t) dt

Let me compute the integral ∫(2v)/(1 + v²) dv.

Let u = 1 + v² → du = 2v dv → so the integral becomes ∫(du/u) = ln |u| + C = ln(1 + v²) + C.

So that's correct.

So, back to 1 + v² = C t

v = sqrt(C t -1) ?

Wait, but v = y/t. So, y = v t = t sqrt(C t -1).

Wait, but when I squared y, y² = t² (C t -1) = C t³ - t².

Hmm, which is consistent with what I had earlier.

So, with C=2, y²= 2 t³ - t².

So, at t=2, y²= 2*(8) -4=16-4=12→ y= sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3)=approx 3.464.

So, the correct answer is J: 3.464.

The differential equation is analyzed and solved using substitution and separation of variables. The initial condition y(1) = 1 is used to determine the constant of integration. The solution simplifies to y² = 2t³ - t². Substituting t = 2 into this equation gives y(2) = sqrt(12) ≈ 3.464.
