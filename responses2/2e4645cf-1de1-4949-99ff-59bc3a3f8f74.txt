Okay, so I've got this question about the brain and how it detects differences in stimulus intensity. Hmm, I need to think through what I know about neural responses. Let me break it down.

The question is asking which factor varies with the intensity of the stimulus. So, I'm trying to remember what factors affect how a neuron responds to a stimulus. I think it's about the ion channels in the neuron's membraneâ€”like which ions are open and how that affects the action potential.

Right, when a neuron receives a stimulus, it causes ion channels to open. These changes in ion flow create an action potential. The intensity of this signal would depend on how many ions are opened or how easily they're moved. Oh wait, the number of ions that can be moved is related to the number of ion channels available. If there are more channels, the signal can go further, probably leading to a larger amplitude.

Looking at the options, option C is the amplitude of the action potential. Amplitude is the strength or height of the action potential. So a higher amplitude would mean a more intense signal. If the stimulus is stronger, more ion channels are open, leading to a bigger action potential.

Other options: the number of synapses crossed (A) might be about connectivity, not the intensity of the signal. Speed of action potential (B) is more about how quickly it travels, which could depend on the ion channels but I'm not sure how it varies with intensity. Number of neurons activated (D) is about how many get the signal, not the intensity of the current signal. Resting potential (I) is the original state, not how it changes. Threshold potential (J) is the minimal level needed to trigger a response, but the question is about what varies with the intensity, not the threshold.

The refractory period (E) is the time a neuron can't fire again after a stimulus, so it's more about timing rather than the intensity of the signal. Permeability (H) refers to how easily ions can enter, which is related to the channels but not the amplitude.

So the correct answer should be C: The amplitude of the action potential varies with the intensity of the stimulus. Because higher stimulus leads to more ion flow, resulting in a larger action potential, thus higher amplitude.

The ability of the brain to detect differences in stimulus intensity is best explained by the amplitude of the action potential, which varies with the intensity of the stimulus. Amplitude is determined by the ion flow, which is influenced by the number of ion channels, leading to a larger action potential when the stimulus is stronger.

ANSWER: C
