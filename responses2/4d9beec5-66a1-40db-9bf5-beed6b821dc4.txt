Okay, so I have this question about a product liability case. Let me try to think through it. The question is about Bill purchasing a can of Sipep from Ajax and then noticing dead insects on the inside bottom. He needs to prove certain things in a product liability tort action.

The options are A through J, each making a different statement. I need to figure out which statements Bill must prove.

First, the question mentions product liability, so I should think about what the elements of product liability are. Product liability often involves showing that the product was defective and that the person using it had a duty to warn or ensure safety.

In this case, Bill bought the can and noticed the problem. So, he must show that the product was defective. Let me go through each option to see which are relevant.

Option A: Ajax failed to warn Bill about the potential for insects in the Sipep can. That sounds like a defense, but in a strict liability case, the defendant (Ajax) needs to show that the product was defective. So Bill must prove that the product was defective and that it was warned. If they're strict liability, maybe they don't need to prove the warning itself, but the product's defect is proven. Wait, but the question says Bill must prove certain things, so perhaps option A is about showing the product's defect, which is a part of product liability.

Option B: Ajax had prior notice of other similar problems. Not sure if that's relevant. The question is about the specific issue here, which is about the Sipep can having dead insects. So, if Bill is looking for evidence about the specific problem, this might not be directly relevant unless it's a general defense. But I don't think B is correct for this question.

Option C: Ajax actually placed the dead insects into the can. That seems a bit odd because if the can was sealed when he bought it, the insects might not be there. But the problem states it's the bottom, so maybe the can was sealed. Wait, no, because if the can was sealed, the insects wouldn't be inside. So this might not be correct unless the can wasn't sealed, but that's not stated. So C might not be correct either.

Option D: The insects caused physical harm. That's about the actual harm caused, which is part of the plaintiff's negligence. But in strict liability, the defendant must show that the product was defective, not that it's negligent. So D might not be a required element unless it's a negligence defense, but the question is about strict liability, so D is probably not what Bill must prove.

Option E: Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep. That's about the seller, but for product liability, the seller's status (merchant, manufacturer, etc.) isn't necessarily required unless it's a duty to warn. So E might not be relevant here unless there's a duty owed by the seller, but I think that's more about manufacturers.

Option F: Ajax knew or should have known of the defective condition. That sounds like a negligence defense. In a strict liability case, the defendant doesn't need to prove negligence, unless it's used to show the product's defect (like that there was a defect in the seller's knowledge). So F might not be correct.

Option G: The Sipep can was sealed when Bill purchased it. Wait, the question says that the can had dead insects inside. If the can was sealed when he bought it, the insects wouldn't be inside. So that's probably not correct. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Bill had a duty to inspect each can before selling it. That's about the seller's duty. But in a strict liability case, the seller's duty isn't required unless they're a manufacturer. So H is probably not correct unless it's a negligence defense. But I'm not sure.

Option I: Ajax had a duty to inspect each can before selling it. Again, this is about the seller's duty. But since this is a strict liability case, H is not relevant unless it's about the seller's role in the defect. So I is probably not correct.

Option J: Ajax is the manufacturer of the Sipep. But if the can was sealed upon purchase, then J is incorrect. But if the seller (Ajax) hasn't been the manufacturer, but just a merchant, then J is incorrect.

So back to the options. The question is about proving that the can was defective.

Option A is about the product being defective, which is a key point. So Bill must prove that the product was defective, which is option A.

Other options: B is about prior notice, which isn't directly relevant unless it's a defense. C is about the product being defective, which is correct, but the question is about what Bill must prove, which is about the product's fault. So A is correct.

Other options like J ( Ajax is manufacturer) might be incorrect if the seller isn't the manufacturer. But the question is about the product's defect, not the seller's role.

So the correct answer should be A: Ajax failed to warn Bill about the potential for insects in the can. Because for strict liability, the defendant must prove the product was defective, and in this case, it's because of the defective condition, which was due to prior warnings.

The correct answer is:

**A: Ajax failed to warn Bill about the potential for insects in the Sipep can.**

**Explanation:**
In a product liability case where the product is defective, Bill must demonstrate that the product was defective and that it was warned. Option A directly addresses showing the product's defect, which is essential for strict liability liability. Other options either pertain to different aspects (e.g., prior warnings, seller's duties) that are not required for proving the product's defect.
