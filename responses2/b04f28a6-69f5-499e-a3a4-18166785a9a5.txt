Okay, so I need to find the area bounded by the spiral given by r = ln θ between θ = π and θ = 2π. Hmm, right. The formula for the area in polar coordinates is (1/2) ∫ (r)^2 dθ, right? So I'll set up the integral from π to 2π of (ln θ)^2 dθ multiplied by 1/2. But wait, let me think if there's anything tricky here.

Wait, ln θ is a function that's increasing, so from π to 2π, ln θ goes from ln π to ln 2π. I remember that ln π is about 1.144 and ln 2π is about 3.142. So the function is increasing, which is good.

But integrating (ln θ)^2 from π to 2π doesn't look straightforward. I don't think this integral has a simple closed-form expression. So I might need to use numerical integration. But wait, the options are all numerical values, so I might need to calculate it.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to recognize the integral or apply a substitution. Let me try to think about substitution. Let u = ln θ, then du = (1/θ) dθ. Hmm, but that complicates things because dθ is not in terms of u, and the integral becomes u² * θ. Wait, but θ is e^u, so the integral would be ∫ u² e^u du, which I recall can be integrated by parts. But I'm not sure if that's the way to go. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use a series expansion for (ln θ)^2. But that might not be practical without a calculator. I think the correct approach is to compute this integral numerically.

So I'll need to approximate the integral ∫ from π to 2π of (ln θ)^2 dθ. Let me compute this using a numerical method, perhaps Simpson's rule, since I can approximate it.

Wait, another thought: maybe I can use a substitution. Let me set x = θ, so the integral is ∫ (ln x)^2 dx from π to 2π. Hmm, but that doesn't help much. Maybe a substitution u = ln x. Let me try that:

When x = π, u = ln π ≈ 1.1447. When x = 2π, u = ln 2π ≈ 3.1416.

So, x = e^u. Then dx = e^u du.

The integral becomes ∫ (u)^2 * e^u du from u = ln π to u = ln 2π.

Hmm, so ∫ (u² e^u) du. Now, integrating u² e^u is a standard integral. The integral of u² e^u du is e^u (u² - 2u + 2) + C. Let me check that:

d/dx [e^u (u² - 2u + 2)] = e^u (u² - 2u + 2) + e^u (2u - 2) 
= e^u (u² -2u +2 + 2u -2 )
= e^u (u² )

Yes, correct. So the integral from π to 2π is (1/2) * [e^u (u² - 2u + 2)] evaluated from ln π to ln 2π.

So substituting back, the area is (1/2) times [e^{ln 2π} ( (ln 2π)^2 - 2 ln 2π + 2 ) - e^{ln π} ( (ln π)^2 - 2 ln π + 2 ) ].

Simplify e^{ln a} = a. So, it becomes:

(1/2) [ 2π ( (ln 2π)^2 - 2 ln 2π + 2 ) - π ( (ln π)^2 - 2 ln π + 2 ) ]

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (ln 2π)^2: that's (ln 2 + ln π)^2 = (0.6931 + 1.1447)^2 ≈ (1.8378)^2 ≈ 3.3785.

Then (ln 2π)^2 - 2 ln 2π + 2 ≈ 3.3785 - 2*(1.8378) + 2 ≈ 3.3785 - 3.6756 + 2 ≈ (3.3785 +2) -3.6756 ≈ 5.3785 -3.6756 ≈ 1.7029.

Multiply by 2π: 2π * 1.7029 ≈ 6.2832 * 1.7029 ≈ let's compute 6 * 1.7029 = 10.2174, 0.2832 *1.7029 ≈ ~0.4825. Total ≈ 10.70.

Now, the second part: (ln π)^2 is (1.1447)^2 ≈ 1.31 So (ln π)^2 - 2 ln π +2 ≈ 1.31 - 2*(1.1447) +2 ≈ 1.31 - 2.2894 +2 ≈ (1.31 +2) -2.2894 ≈ 3.31 -2.2894 ≈ 1.0206.

Multiply by π: 3.1416 *1.0206 ≈ 3.207.

So the difference is 10.70 - 3.207 ≈ 7.493.

Multiply by 1/2: (1/2)*7.493 ≈ 3.7465.

So approximately 3.7465.

Looking at the options, option E is 3.743, which is very close.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have made an error in the calculation steps.

Wait, in the substitution step, I had:

The integral is (1/2) [e^{ln 2π} (u² - 2u +2) - e^{ln π} (u² - 2u +2) ] evaluated from u = ln π to u = ln 2π.

Wait, u is from ln π to ln 2π, which is roughly 1.1447 to 3.1416. So, substituting back, the expression becomes:

(1/2) [2π ( ( (ln 2π)^2 - 2 ln 2π + 2 )) - π ( ( (ln π)^2 - 2 ln π + 2 )) ]

Which is (1/2) [ 2π (3.3785) - π (1.31 - 2.2894 + 2) ]

Wait, wait, let's compute each term again.

Wait, (ln 2π)^2 ≈ (1.8378)^2 ≈ 3.3785.

(ln 2π)^2 - 2 ln 2π + 2 ≈ 3.3785 - 3.6756 +2 ≈ (3.3785 +2) =5.3785 -3.6756= 1.7029.

Multiply by 2π: 2π * 1.7029 ≈ 6.2832 *1.7029 ≈ Let's compute 6 *1.7029=10.2174, and 0.2832 *1.7029≈0.4825. So total≈10.70.

Now, the other term: (ln π)^2 ≈1.31, 2 ln π≈2.2894.

(ln π)^2 -2 ln π +2 ≈1.31 -2.2894 +2= 1.0206.

Multiply by π: 3.1416 *1.0206≈3.207.

So the difference is 10.70 -3.207=7.493.

Multiply by 1/2: 7.493 /2=3.7465.

So about 3.7465, which is option E: 3.743.

Wait, but why did I get 3.7465, which is close to option E. Option E is 3.743, which is very close. So the correct answer is E.

To find the area bounded by the spiral \( r = \ln \theta \) between \( \theta = \pi \) and \( \theta = 2\pi \), we use the formula for the area in polar coordinates:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\pi}^{2\pi} (\ln \theta)^2 \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \ln \theta \), we find the integral becomes:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\ln \pi}^{\ln 2\pi} u^2 e^u \, du
\]

Evaluating this integral using integration by parts, we get:

\[
\int u^2 e^u \, du = e^u (u^2 - 2u + 2) + C
\]

Substituting back and evaluating from \( u = \ln \pi \) to \( u = \ln 2\pi \), we compute:

- For \( u = \ln 2\pi \): \( e^u (u^2 - 2u + 2) \approx 6.2832 \times 1.7029 \approx 10.70 \)
- For \( u = \ln \pi \): \( e^u (u^2 - 2u + 2) \approx 3.1416 \times 1.0206 \approx 3.207 \)

The difference is \( 10.70 - 3.207 = 7.493 \). Multiplying by \( \frac{1}{2} \) gives:

\[
A \approx 3.7465
\]

The closest option is E: 3.743.
