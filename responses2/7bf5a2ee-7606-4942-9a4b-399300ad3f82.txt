Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the global aging population. Hmm, I remember from my biology classes that older people get more from genetics than from environmental factors, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each option one by one.

The question is asking which statement is correct. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Men outnumber women in older age groups. I think women have more older people than men. Because men have a higher risk of dying from age-related conditions, like heart disease, whereas women have more issues like cancer. So maybe more women are dying early, so older populations have more women. So this might be false. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: The rate of increase in the median age is slower in developing countries than wealthy countries. Wait, I thought developing countries might have lower life expectancy, but I'm not sure about the median age. I remember that developing countries often have lower birth rates and lower life expectancies, which might lead to a slower increase in the median age. Wealthier countries have higher birth rates and better healthcare, so they have a faster increase. So B says developing countries have slower, which would make sense. So B might be correct.

Option C: The global aging population is decreasing due to advancements in healthcare. No, wait, global aging is increasing because the world is getting older, not decreasing. If healthcare is better, perhaps death rates are lower, so the population could age more. So C is incorrect.

Option D: By 2050, majority will be under 40. That sounds unlikely because if the world is aging, most people would be in their 40s or older. So D is probably not correct.

Option E: Men have a lower mortality rate than women over the life course. I don't think that's accurate. Women have higher mortality rates from age-related diseases, especially heart issues. Men, being male, are more likely to die from factors like cancer. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Rate of increase in median age is greater in developing countries than wealthy. No, I think wealthy countries have a higher increase because they have better healthcare. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Majority of elderly is in developed countries. No, because many developing countries have large elderly populations, especially in developing regions. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Men and women numbers are equal in older age groups. No, that's incorrect too. Women have more older people. So H is wrong.

So reviewing all, option B: developing countries have slower median age increase compared to wealthy. That makes sense because wealthier countries have better health and higher birth rates, leading to a faster aging process. So the median age would go up more rapidly. Therefore, the rate is slower in developing than wealthy. So B is correct.

The correct answer is **B**: The rate of increase in the median age of populations is slower in developing countries than wealthy countries. 

**Answer: B**
