Okay, so I have this economics question about automatic stabilizers during an economic expansion. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that automatic stabilizers are built-in programs that the government uses to maintain stable economic growth. They work because when the economy is expanding, people and businesses spend more, and the government also responds by increasing spending or cutting taxes. So during an expansion, these systems automatically try to keep the economy steady by either increasing spending or decreasing taxes.

The question is asking about the effect of these automatic stabilizers on government expenditures as the economy grows. The options are about whether they rise, fall, or stay constant, and whether taxes rise, fall, or remain the same.

Let me break it down: during an expansion, the economy is growing. So, the government increases its spending or reduces taxes to stimulate the economy. Now, I need to see how that affects government expenditure as a result of the automatic stabilizers.

Wait, wait. The question is specifically about the effect on government expenditures. So, if the economy is expanding, what happens to the government's expenditure? Usually, when the economy is expanding, the government might increase its spending to meet rising demand. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, no, the automatic stabilizers are already in place. So, in an expansion, they would automatically increase their spending because the economy is growing. So, perhaps when the economy is expanding, these stabilizers (like government spending) would rise. But wait, the question is about the effect of automatic stabilizers on government expenditures as a result of the expansion. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says, "as a result of automatic stabilizers during economic expansions, what happens to government expenditures." So, during an expansion, the automatic stabilizers would lead to higher government spending because the economy is growing. So, does that mean that government expenditures rise?

Wait, but there's also the possibility that during expansion, the government might try to cut taxes to maintain spending. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, no, when the economy is expanding, the government increases its spending or reduces taxes to stabilize the economy. So, if the economy is expanding, the government might increase both its spending and cut taxes.

But the question is about the effect of the automatic stabilizers on government expenditures. So, if the expansion leads to higher government spending (like increasing AD), then the government's expenditures rise. But I'm not sure if it's because of the automatic response or because the government decides to do this.

Alternatively, perhaps when the economy is in expansion, the government's automatic stabilizers (like increased government spending) would cause their own expenditures to rise. So, the answer would be that government expenditures rise.

Looking at the options: Option A says remain constant and taxes rise. No, that doesn't fit. Option B: fluctuate, taxes rise. No, fluctuation is probably not the case. Option C: fall and taxes remain. No, that's the opposite. Option D: rise and taxes fall. That's possible if the government increases spending to cover the rising demand but then cuts taxes. Wait, but would that be automatic?

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. During an economic expansion, the economy is growing. The government's automatic stabilizers would try to respond by increasing spending to meet the increased demand. So, if the economy is expanding, the government's spending would rise because it's trying to stimulate the economy. So, in this case, the government's expenditures would rise.

But wait, isn't the government spending increasing because of the expansion? Like, when the economy is growing, people's income rises, so the government might increase its spending to match that.

So, if during expansion, the government's expenditures rise, which would mean that the answer is D: rise and taxes fall.

Wait, but why would taxes fall? Because the government is spending more, so perhaps they can reduce their tax burden. Or maybe the government cuts taxes to keep their spending up, so taxes fall.

Alternatively, maybe when the economy is expanding, the government's spending increases, leading to lower taxes so that the government can spend more. So, taxes would fall.

Wait, that makes sense. When the economy is expanding, the government wants to stimulate spending. So, they might increase their own spending (government expenditures) to match the rise in demand. To do that, they can either increase taxes (cutting) or decrease spending. But if they want to increase their own spending, they might cut taxes.

So, if taxes fall, that would reduce the government's budget deficit, allowing them to spend more. So, in this case, the government's expenditures would increase, and taxes would fall.

Looking at the options, option D says 'rise and taxes fall' which would fit if that's the case.

But wait, let's look at the options again.

Option D: rise and taxes fall. That would be the case if the government increases their spending (expenditures) and reduces taxes to pay for it.

So, the correct answer would be D: rise and taxes fall.
</think>

The correct answer is D: rise and taxes fall.

When the economy is expanding, the government's automatic stabilizers would lead to an increase in government expenditures to stimulate the economy. To achieve this, the government might reduce taxes, thereby reducing the budget deficit. This allows the government to spend more, increasing its expenditures and reducing taxes.

Answer: D
