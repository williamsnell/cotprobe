Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about a polytropic process for oxygen. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm. Let's see, the question says two pounds of oxygen undergo a polytropic process. They're compressed from 14 psia and 70°F to 98 psia. The polytropic exponent is 1.3. I need to find the heat transferred (a) and the change in entropy (b).

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on polytropic processes, but I remember that for polytropic processes, the relation PV^n = C holds, where n is the exponent. Oh wait, the exponent here is 1.3, so n=1.3.

So, the first part (a) is about heat transfer. I think for polytropic processes, we can relate the specific heats and use the first law of thermodynamics. The first law is ΔU = Q - W, but wait, for polytropic processes, we can also relate the work done and heat transfer.

Wait, but wait, how do I find Q? I need to relate the change in internal energy. Since internal energy depends on temperature, and the process is polytropic, maybe I can find the change in temperature first.

Oh, but wait, I'm given the initial and final pressures and temperatures? Wait, no, the temperatures aren't given. Oh, wait, the initial state is 70°F, but I need to convert that to absolute temperature. Let me think: 70°F is equal to (70 + 459.67) = 529.67 R. The final pressure is 98 psia, which is higher than the initial 14 psia.

Wait, but the process is polytropic, so I can use the relation P1 V1^n = P2 V2^n. But I don't know V1 and V2, but maybe I can relate them through the ideal gas law. Oh, but wait, oxygen is a real gas, so the ideal gas law might not apply exactly. Wait, but sometimes in thermodynamics problems, especially for solids and gases, we use the ideal gas assumption to approximate.

Wait, the problem provides R for oxygen as 0.062 Btu/lbmol·R. Hmm, but oxygen's molecular weight is about 32 lbm per mole, so R for oxygen in Btu/lbmol·R would be 0.062 * 32 = 1.984 Btu/lbmol·R. Oh, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Maybe I should proceed with the ideal gas approach.

So, the initial state: P1=14 psia, T1=529.67 R. I need to find V1. Using PV = mRT, where m is the mass.

Wait, but wait, oxygen's molecular weight is 32 lbm/lbmol. So, m in lbm is 2 lbm. So, P1 V1 = m R T1. So, V1 = (m R T1) / P1.

Wait, but wait, R is in Btu/lbmol·R, so R is 0.062 Btu/lbmol·R. Let me compute V1. So, m is 2 lbm, R is 0.062 Btu/lbmol·R, T1 is 529.67 R.

So V1 = (2 lbm * 0.062 Btu/lbmol·R * 529.67 R) / 14 psia.

Wait, let me compute that. 2 * 0.062 = 0.124. 0.124 * 529.67 ≈ 65.54. Then divided by 14 is approximately 4.684 cubic feet? Wait, but wait, the units: Btu/(lbm·R) * R will give Btu/lbm, and then divided by psia (which is force per area). Wait, perhaps I should think about units more carefully. Hmm, I might be getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law in terms of specific volume.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the specific volume at the initial and final states.

Wait, but maybe I can use the relation for the polytropic process. The polytropic relation is PV^n = C. So, for part (a), I need to find the change in internal energy, which would help in finding Q.

Wait, the change in internal energy for a polytropic process can be found using the formula ΔU = m [ (n/(n+1)) (P2 V2 - P1 V1) ]. Or wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of m and the change in specific volume.

Wait, another approach: For a polytropic process, the change in internal energy is given by ΔU = m [ R T1 (1 - (T2 / T1)^(n-1)/n ) ].

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if I'm getting the formula right. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the work done and then find the heat transfer.

Wait, let me think about the work done in a polytropic process. The work done is W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1) * (1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1)) )? Or maybe I should use the formula for work in polytropic processes: W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1) - (P1 V1)/(n-1) (V2/V1)^(n-1) + ...? Hmm, perhaps I should recall the correct formula.

Wait, I think the work done for a polytropic process is W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1) * (1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1)) ). So, let me compute this.

But to find V1 and V2, maybe I should compute each state's specific volume.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute the specific volume at each state using PV = m R T. Let me try that.

First, initial state: P1 = 14 psia, T1 = 70°F = 529.67 R. Using R = 0.062 * 32 = 1.984 Btu/lbmol·R.

So, m = 2 lbm, so molar mass is 32 lbm/lbmol.

So, V1 = (m R T1) / P1.

Wait, but units: P is in psia, which is psi = lb/in². R is in Btu/(lbm mol R), and T is in R.

Wait, let's think about the units. V would be in cubic feet? Because 1 cubic foot is about 144 in³, and 1 Btu is about 2500 ft.lbf, but maybe that's not the right path. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it numerically.

Compute V1: (2 lbm * 1.984 Btu/lbmol·R * 529.67 R) / 14 psia.

Let me compute numerator: 2 * 1.984 = 3.968. Multiply by 529.67: 3.968 * 529.67 ≈ 2108.03. So, V1 = 2108.03 /14 = approx 150.57 cubic feet. Wait, but units? Because Btu is a unit of energy. Wait, maybe I should compute the correct units.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should use the specific volume in units of cubic feet per pound mass. Let me think.

Wait, the specific volume v is V/m, so V = m v. So, v = V/m.

So, using the ideal gas law, P V = m R T --> V = (m R T)/P.

But I need to ensure the units are consistent. Let's check units:

R is in Btu/(lbm mol R). So, R = 0.062 Btu/(lb-mol) R.

But m is in lbm, T in R, P in psia (lb/in²).

So, V = (m R T) / P.

Compute each term:

m: 2 lbm.

R: 0.062 Btu/(lb-mol R).

T: 529.67 R.

P: 14 psia = 14 lb/in².

So, numerator: 2 * 0.062 * 529.67 = ?

2 * 0.062 = 0.124.

0.124 * 529.67 ≈ 65.55 lb/in² * lbm.

Denominator: 14 lb/in².

So, V = (65.55) / 14 = 4.682 cubic inches per lbm? That can't be right because 4.682 in³ per lbm is a small volume. Wait, maybe I made a unit mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should use pressure in psia and volume in ft³. Let me think about the conversion factors.

1 psi = 1 lb/in².

1 ft = 12 inches.

1 ft³ = (12 in)^3 = 1728 in³.

So, 4.682 in³ per lbm is 4.682 / 1728 ≈ 0.00272 ft³ per lbm.

So, v (specific volume) = V/m = (0.00272 ft³/lbm) / 2 lbm → Wait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, V is 4.682 in³ per lbm, which is 4.682 / 1728 ≈ 0.00272 ft³/lbm.

So, v = V/m = 0.00272 ft³/lbm / 2 lbm = 0.00136 ft³/lbm.

Hmm, but wait, another approach: using the ideal gas law, PV = m R T → v = V/m = (R T)/(P).

So, v = (0.062 * 32 * 529.67 R) / (14 psia).

Wait, 0.062 * 32 = 1.984 Btu/lbmol·R.

Multiply by 529.67 R: 1.984 * 529.67 ≈ 1051.3 Btu/lbmol.

Divide by 14 psia: 1051.3 /14 ≈ 75.095 Btu/(lbm·psia).

But wait, Btu/(lbm·R) * R = Btu/(lbm). So, the unit is Btu/(lbm), which is a form of specific volume.

So, v = 75.095 Btu/(lbm·R) * R → actually, with the R in denominator, wait, no. Let me think carefully. The specific volume is V/m, which comes out to be 75.095 Btu/(lbm·R) * R → because R is in units of Btu/(lbm·R), so:

v = (0.062 * 32 * 529.67) / 14 = 1051.3 /14 ≈ 75.095 Btu/(lbm·R) * (R) → No, wait, that can't be. Because R is in Btu/(lbm·R), so when you divide by R, the R units cancel, leaving Btu/(lbm).

So, v = 75.095 Btu/(lbm) → wait, but Btu/(lbm) is not a unit of volume, but energy per mass. Wait, volume is in cubic feet, so perhaps I should convert this.

Wait, 1 Btu = 778 ft.lbf.

So, v = 75.095 * 778 ft.lbf/(lbm) → 75.095 * 778 ≈ 58,424 ft.lbf/(lbm).

But, 1 ft.lbf = 1 lbf·in = 1 lbf·12 in = 12 lbf·in. So, 58,424 ft.lbf = 58,424 *12 = 697, 488 lbf·in.

Wait, but how does that help? Maybe I need to compute the actual volume in cubic feet.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck in the units. Maybe I should proceed in terms of the polytropic relation.

Wait, perhaps I can find the work done without units, using the polytropic relation.

Wait, but I think I need to find V1 and V2 first. Let me try that.

Compute V1: (m R T1)/(P1).

m is 2 lbm.

R is 0.062 * 32 = 1.984 Btu/(lbmol·R).

T1 is 70°F = 529.67 R.

P1 is 14 psia.

So, V1 = (2 * 1.984 * 529.67) / 14 = let's compute the numerator: 2 * 1.984 is 3.968. Multiply by 529.67: 3.968 *529.67 ≈ 2108.03. Divide by 14: 2108.03 /14 ≈ 150.57 cubic feet.

Similarly, V2 is (m R T2)/P2.

But wait, I don't have T2 yet. Hmm. Oh, but I can find T2 using the ideal gas equation.

Wait, but I don't have V2, so perhaps I should use the polytropic relation to find V2 in terms of V1.

Wait, since P1 V1^n = P2 V2^n.

So, V2 = V1 * (P1/P2)^(1/n).

Because (V1 * (P1/P2))^(n) = V2^n → V2 = V1 * (P1/P2)^(1/n).

So, n=1.3.

So, V2 = V1 * (14/98)^(1/1.3).

Compute 14/98 = 1/7.

So, (1/7)^(1/1.3) → let me compute that.

Take ln(1/7) = -ln(7) ≈ -1.9459.

Divide by 1.3: -1.9459 /1.3 ≈ -1.4969.

Exponentiate: e^-1.4969 ≈ 0.221.

So, V2 = V1 * 0.221 → V1 is 150.57, so V2 ≈ 150.57 *0.221 ≈ 33.31 ft³.

So, V2 is about 33.31 ft³. So, the specific volume at state 2 is V2/m = 33.31 / 2 = 16.655 ft³/lbm.

Wait, so now I can compute the specific volumes at both states. V1 and V2 are 150.57 and 33.31, respectively.

Now, to compute the work done in a polytropic process, the formula for W is (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1) * (1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1)).

Wait, let me double-check the formula. I think the formula is:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n - 1) * [1 - (P2/P1)^( (n - 1)/(n - 1) ) ].

Wait, but that would be 1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1)/(n-1) ), which might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the work done in a polytropic process is:

W = ( (P1 V1 - P2 V2) ) / (n - 1) ) * (1 - (P2/(P1))^{(n-1)/(n-1) }) ), which simplifies to (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1) ) * (1 - [P2/P1]^1) ) ?

Wait, that can't be right, because if n=1, the process is isothermal. Hmm, perhaps I should look up the correct formula for the work done in a polytropic process.

Alternatively, I might remember that the work done is (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1) * [1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1)] / (n - 1) * something.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the expression for the work done in a polytropic process. The formula I found earlier is:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1) * (1 - (P2/P1)^{n-1} )^{1/(n-1)} }.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the work done is (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (1 - (n-1)/(n-1)) ) or something else. Hmm.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the work done in a polytropic process is:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1) ) * (1 - (P2 / P1)^{ (n-1)/(n-1) } )).

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) * [1/(n-1)] ) * [1 - (P2/P1)^{ (n-1)/(n-1) } ].

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct formula for work done in polytropic processes.

Wait, on second thought, I think the correct formula for the work done in a polytropic process is:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1) * (1 - (P2/P1)^{ (n-1)/(n-1) } )).

Wait, but that still doesn't make sense because (n-1)/(n-1) is 1, so the formula becomes W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n-1) * (1 - (P2/P1) ) ).

Wait, but then that's the formula for the work done in a polytropic process where n approaches 1, which is the isothermal case, but maybe that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the work done in a polytropic process using the formula:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1) * (1 - (P2/P1)^{ (n-1)/(n-1) } )).

Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the work done in a polytropic process, which is W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1) ) * [1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1) ) ].

Wait, perhaps that's right. Let me test it with n=1, which should be isothermal.

Then,

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (1 - 1) ) * [1 - (P2/P1)^0 ) ].

But division by zero is undefined. So, perhaps that approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the work done using the specific volumes and the first law.

Wait, the first law is ΔU = Q - W.

So, if I can find ΔU, then I can find Q if I know W.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute ΔU using the ideal gas law.

ΔU = m [ (n/(n+1)) (P2 V2 - P1 V1) ) ].

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the change in internal energy for a polytropic process is:

ΔU = m [ R T1 (1 - (T2 / T1)^{n-1}/n ) ].

Wait, but again, I'm not confident. Let me think again.

Wait, considering that the process is polytropic, I can compute the work done as:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n-1) ) * [1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1) ].

Wait, that can't be right because if n=1, it's undefined.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the work done using the work equation for a polytropic process.

Wait, another approach: The work done in a polytropic process is:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1) ) * [1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1) ) ].

Hmm, perhaps this is correct. Let me test it with n=1.

Wait, but then denominator is zero. So, perhaps this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1) ) * (1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1) )).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check.

Wait, some sources say that the work done in a polytropic process is:

W = [(P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n - 1)] * [1 - (P2/P1)^(n - 1)].

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1) * [1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1) ].

Wait, but that still leaves the issue of division by zero. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the work done using the formula:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n - 1) * [1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1) ].

But in any case, perhaps I can proceed by first finding the work done and then using the first law to find the heat transfer.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the change in internal energy and then use the first law to find the heat transfer.

Wait, the first law of thermodynamics is ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system.

So, if I can compute ΔU, then I can find Q = ΔU + W.

So, let's compute ΔU.

ΔU = m [ (n/(n+1)) (P2 V2 - P1 V1) ) ].

Wait, I'm not sure about the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the specific equation: ΔU = (n/(n+1)) (P2 V2 - P1 V1) ).

Wait, but that doesn't account for the mass. So, I think I'm missing a step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the change in internal energy using the ideal gas law.

ΔU = m [ (n/(n+1)) (P2 V2 - P1 V1) ) ].

Wait, maybe that's correct.

So, let me compute P2 V2 - P1 V1.

P2 is 98 psia, V2 is 33.31 ft³.

So, P2 V2 = 98 * 33.31 ≈ 3266.38 ft·lbf.

P1 V1 is 14 *150.57 ≈ 2108.0 ft·lbf.

So, P2 V2 - P1 V1 = 3266.38 - 2108 ≈ 1158.38 ft·lbf.

So, ΔU = 2 * [ (1.3)/(1.3+1) ) * 1158.38 ) ].

Wait, because m is 2 lbm. So, ΔU = m * [ (n/(n+1)) (P2 V2 - P1 V1) ) ].

So, n=1.3.

Compute (n/(n+1)) = (1.3)/(2.3) ≈ 0.5652.

So, (0.5652) * 1158.38 ≈ 655.27 ft·lbf.

Multiply by m=2: 2 * 655.27 ≈ 1310.54 ft·lbf.

So, ΔU = 1310.54 ft·lbf.

But wait, what about the units? Because 1 Btu = 778 ft·lbf, so 1310.54 ft·lbf is about 1.71 Btu.

But in any case, perhaps I can proceed.

Now, the first law is ΔU = Q - W.

So, Q = ΔU + W.

But I need to find W.

Wait, but earlier I tried to compute W using the polytropic process formula. Let's compute that.

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n -1) ) * [1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1) ) ].

Wait, but let's compute P1 V1 - P2 V2.

P1 V1 =14 *150.57 ≈ 2108.0 ft·lbf.

P2 V2 =98 *33.31 ≈ 3266.38 ft·lbf.

So, P1 V1 - P2 V2 = 2108.0 - 3266.38 ≈ -1158.38 ft·lbf.

n-1 =0.3.

So, (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1) ) = (-1158.38)/0.3 ≈ -3861.27 ft·lbf.

Now, [1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1) ) ].

P2/P1 = 98/14 =7.

(n-1) =0.3.

So, (7)^0.3 = e^(0.3 * ln7) ≈ e^(0.3 *1.9459) ≈ e^(0.5838) ≈ 1.794.

So, [1 - (1.794)] = -0.794.

So, W = (-3861.27) * (-0.794) ≈ 3861.27 * 0.794.

Compute 3861 * 0.794.

Well, 3861 * 0.7 = 2702.7.

3861 * 0.094 = 3861 * 0.1 = 386.1 minus 3861 *0.006=23.166.

Wait, 3861 * 0.094 = 3861 * (0.1 -0.006) = 386.1 - 23.166= 362.934.

So, 2702.7 + 362.934 ≈ 3065.634.

So, W ≈ 3065.63 ft·lbf.

Wait, but that's a positive value. But wait, earlier, W was calculated as -3861.27 * (-0.794) = 3065.63.

Wait, but earlier, when I computed W as (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1) ) * [1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1) ) ].

So, W = (-1158.38)/0.3 * (-0.794) ≈ (-3861.27) * (-0.794) = 3065.63.

Hmm, but let's confirm this calculation. Because I might have made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let me recompute (P2/P1)^(n-1) =7^0.3.

Compute 7^0.3: We can take natural log: ln(7)=1.9459, multiply by 0.3: 0.5838. Then e^0.5838 =1.794. So, correct.

So, [1 -1.794 ]= -0.794. So, correct.

So, W = (-1158.38)/0.3 * (-0.794) = (3861.27) * (0.794) ≈ 3065.63.

So, W ≈ 3065.63 ft·lbf.

Now, ΔU is 1310.54 ft·lbf.

So, Q = ΔU + W =1310.54 +3065.63 =4376.17 ft·lbf.

Now, to find the heat transfer Q, which is 4376.17 ft·lbf.

But wait, the problem states that the process is compressed, but what about the surroundings? Well, the question asks for the heat transfer, so Q is 4376.17 ft·lbf.

But wait, let me think about the sign convention. In many cases, heat transfer from the system is considered negative. But in this case, since the system absorbs heat, Q is positive. So, part (a) is 4376.17 ft·lbf.

But wait, the question is in two parts: (a) and (b). (a) is the heat transfer, and (b) is the work done. So, the answers are Q=4376.17 ft·lbf and W=3065.63 ft·lbf.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the units. Wait, 1 Btu =778 ft·lbf. So, to convert the work done into Btu, I can divide by 778.

So, W =3065.63 /778 ≈ 3.93 Btu.

Similarly, ΔU is1310.54 ft·lbf =1310.54 /778 ≈1.69 Btu.

So, Q=4376.17 ft·lbf=4376.17/778≈5.60 Btu.

Hmm, but the question asks for the answer in Btu, so perhaps I should present the answers in Btu.

So, Q=5.60 Btu.

W=3.93 Btu.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the work done is positive or negative. Because earlier, W was calculated as positive, which would mean the system is doing work on the surroundings.

But in this case, the work done by the system is W=3.93 Btu, which is positive.

So, the heat transfer is Q=5.60 Btu, and the work done by the system is W=3.93 Btu.

Wait, but the question is in two parts: (a) and (b). (a) is the heat transfer, (b) is the work done. So, Q=5.60 Btu, W=3.93 Btu.

But perhaps I should double-check my calculations because I'm a bit unsure.

Wait, let me recompute the work done.

Earlier, I found that W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1) ) * (1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1) ) ).

So, P1 V1=14*150.57=2108.0 ft·lbf.

P2 V2=98*33.31=3266.38 ft·lbf.

So, P1 V1 - P2 V2=2108.0 -3266.38= -1158.38 ft·lbf.

n-1=0.3.

So, (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(n-1) )= (-1158.38)/0.3= -3861.27 ft·lbf.

Then, (1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1) )=1 -7^0.3=1 -1.794= -0.794.

So, W= (-3861.27) * (-0.794)=3861.27 *0.794=3065.63 ft·lbf.

So, W=3065.63 ft·lbf.

Then, ΔU=1310.54 ft·lbf.

So, Q= ΔU + W=1310.54 +3065.63=4376.17 ft·lbf.

Now, convert to Btu:

Q=4376.17 /778 ≈5.60 Btu.

W=3065.63 /778 ≈3.93 Btu.

So, the answers are Q=5.60 Btu and W=3.93 Btu.

But wait, I'm not sure if the work done is positive or negative. Because in the formula, W is the work done by the system, which is positive if the system is doing work on the surroundings. But in our case, the system is doing work on the surroundings because W=3065.63 ft·lbf, which is positive.

Hmm, but perhaps I should double-check the formula for work done in a polytropic process. Let me look it up.

Wait, according to some sources, the work done in a polytropic process is given by:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1) ) * (1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1) ) )

So, this seems correct.

Wait, another source says that the work done in a polytropic process is:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1) ) * (1 - (P2/P1)^(n-1) ) )

So, this seems correct.

Thus, the answers are Q=5.60 Btu and W=3.93 Btu.

Wait, but let me check if the units are correct. Because ΔU is in ft·lbf, and W is in ft·lbf, so adding them gives Q in ft·lbf, which we then convert to Btu.

So, that's correct.

So, to summarize:

(a) Heat transfer Q =5.60 Btu.

(b) Work done W=3.93 Btu.

I think that's the solution.

To determine the heat transfer (Q) and work done (W) during the compression process, we proceed as follows:

### Given Data:
- **Polytropic index**: \( n = 1.3 \)  
- **Initial pressure**: \( P_1 = 14 \, \text{lbf} \)  
- **Final pressure**: \( P_2 = 98 \, \text{lbf} \)  
- **Initial state specific volume**: \( V_1 = 150.57 \, \text{ft}^3 \)  
- **Final state specific volume**: \( V_2 = 33.31 \, \text{ft}^3 \)  

### Step 1: Calculate Work Done (W)
The work done in a polytropic process is given by:

\[
W = \frac{P_1 V_1 - P_2 V_2}{n - 1} \cdot \left(1 - \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{n - 1}\right)
\]

1. Compute \( P_1 V_1 \) and \( P_2 V_2 \):
   \[
   P_1 V_1 = 14 \times 150.57 = 2108.0 \, \text{lbf} \cdot \text{ft}
   \]
   \[
   P_2 V_2 = 98 \times 33.31 = 3266.38 \, \text{lbf} \cdot \text{ft}
   \]

2. Compute \( P_1 V_1 - P_2 V_2 \):
   \[
   P_1 V_1 - P_2 V_2 = 2108.0 - 3266.38 = -1158.38 \, \text{lbf} \cdot \text{ft}
   \]

3. Compute \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \) and \( \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{n - 1} \):
   \[
   \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{98}{14} = 7
   \]
   \[
   \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{n - 1} = 7^{0.3} \approx 1.794
   \]

4. Compute \( \left(1 - \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{n - 1}\right) \):
   \[
   1 - 1.794 = -0.794
   \]

5. Compute \( \frac{P_1 V_1 - P_2 V_2}{n - 1} \):
   \[
   \frac{-1158.38}{0.3} = -3861.27 \, \text{lbf} \cdot \text{ft}
   \]

6. Compute \( W \):
   \[
   W = (-3861.27) \cdot (-0.794) = 3065.63 \, \text{lbf} \cdot \text{ft}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Heat Transfer (Q)
Using the first law of thermodynamics:

\[
Q = \Delta U + W
\]

1. Compute \( \Delta U \):
   \[
   \Delta U = m \left[ \frac{n}{n + 1} (P_2 V_2 - P_1 V_1) \right]
   \]
   \[
   P_2 V_2 - P_1 V_1 = 3266.38 - 2108.0 = 1158.38 \, \text{lbf} \cdot \text{ft}
   \]
   \[
   \Delta U = 2 \left[ \frac{1.3}{2.3} \times 1158.38 \right] = 2 \times 655.27 = 1310.54 \, \text{lbf} \cdot \text{ft}
   \]

2. Compute \( \Delta U \) in Btu:
   \[
   \Delta U = \frac{1310.54}{778} \approx 1.69 \, \text{Btu}
   \]

3. Compute \( Q \):
   \[
   Q = 1.69 + 5.60 = 7.29 \, \text{Btu}
   \]

### Final Results:
- **Heat Transfer (Q)**: \( 5.60 \, \text{Btu} \)
- **Work Done (W)**: \( 3.93 \, \text{Btu} \)

ANSWER: Q = 5.60 Btu, W = 3.93 Btu.
