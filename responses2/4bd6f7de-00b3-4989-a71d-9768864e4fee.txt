Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about glucose-1-phosphate. Let me try to figure this out. The question is asking for the volume occupied by one molecule of glucose-1-phosphate. I remember that volume is mass divided by density, but wait, that's for a substance in its bulk form. Oh, right, because a single molecule is very small, so I need to consider the molar mass and Avogadro's number.

Alright, the problem gives me the molecular weight of glucose-1-phosphate. It's 260 g/mole. I think the molecular weight is the mass of one mole of the substance. Then the density is about 1.5 g/cm³. So, the formula should be volume = mass / density. But wait, for a single molecule, I need to convert moles to molecules using Avogadro's number.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Find the mass of one molecule. That's the molecular weight divided by Avogadro's number.
2. Then, use the density to convert mass to volume, but wait, density is mass per volume (g/cm³ is g/L, so I need to think about units here).

Let me think. The density is 1.5 g/cm³, which is 1.5 g per cm³. So, for mass (m) = density (d) * volume (V), but I think I need to find V for one molecule.

Wait, another approach: The volume per molecule can be found by dividing the molar volume (which is molar mass / density) by Avogadro's number. Because molar volume is the volume occupied by one mole of the substance.

So, molar volume V_m = (molecular weight) / density. Then, one molecule's volume is V_m divided by Avogadro's number (N_A).

Let me calculate molar volume first. Molecular weight is 260 g/mol, density is 1.5 g/cm³. So V_m = 260 / 1.5 = approximately 173.33 cm³ per mole.

Wait, wait, wait. No, density is mass per volume, so V_m (molar volume) would be (mass) / density. Mass is in grams, and density is g/cm³. So, V_m in cm³ is (g/mol) / (g/cm³) = cm³/mol. So yes, 260 / 1.5 = about 173.33 cm³/mol.

Then, to get cm³ per molecule, we divide by Avogadro's number (6.022e23 molecules/mol). So:

V = (173.33 cm³/mol) / (6.022e23 molecules/mol) ≈ (173.33) / (6.022e23) cm³/molecule.

Let me compute that: 173.33 / 6.022e23 ≈ approximately 28.78e-23 cm³, which is about 2.878e-22 cm³ per molecule.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 173.33 divided by 6.022e23 is:

173.33 ÷ 6.022 = approx 28.78. So 28.78e-23 is 2.878e-22 cm³ per molecule. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 2.9e-22, which is close to this number.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Wait, did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. 260 g/mol divided by 1.5 g/cm³ is 260 / 1.5 = 173.333... cm³/mol.

Then, 173.333 cm³/mol divided by Avogadro's number (6.022e23) gives cm³ per molecule.

So 173.333 / 6.022e23 = (approx) 28.78e-23 cm³/molecule. Which is 2.878e-22 cm³/molecule. The closest option is A: 2.9e-22 cm³.

But wait, let me look at the options again. Wait, the options are:

A: 2.9 × 10^-22 cm³

Others are lower, like F is 9e-23, which is about half of 2e-22.

Wait, but did I get the calculations right? Let me see. Molar volume is 260 / 1.5 = 173.33 cm³/mol.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. The formula for molar volume is (molecular weight) divided by (density). So molar volume is 260 / 1.5=173.33 cm³/mol. Then, per molecule, it's 173.33 / Avogadro's number.

So 173.33 / 6.022e23 = approx 2.878e-22 cm³. So option A is 2.9e-22, which is close.

Wait, but let me think again. Wait, the units. So the density is 1.5 g/cm³. So the mass per cm³ is 1.5 g. So 260 g is how much in cm³? 260 g / 1.5 g/cm³ = 173.33 cm³. So 173.33 cm³ is 1 mole. So per mole, it's 173.33 cm³. Then per molecule, 173.33 / (6.022e23) = approx 2.878e-22 cm³. So option A is 2.9e-22, which is the closest. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thought. Do I have to consider the molar mass correctly? The molecular weight was given as 260. So yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in calculating. Because 260 / 1.5 is 173.33. Oh wait, but wait, wait! I think I mixed up molar mass and something else. Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Because the molar volume is (molecular weight) / (density) = (260 g/mol) / (1.5 g/cm³) = 173.33 cm³/mol. Then, the volume per molecule is 173.33 cm³ / (6.022e23) molecules/mol. So 173.33 / 6.022e23 = 2.878e-22 cm³/molecule. So yes, option A is 2.9e-22. So the correct answer is A.

To determine the volume occupied by one molecule of glucose-1-phosphate, we start by calculating the molar volume using the formula:

\[
\text{Molar volume} = \frac{\text{Molecular weight}}{\text{Density}}
\]

Given the molecular weight is 260 g/mol and the density is 1.5 g/cm³, the molar volume is:

\[
\text{Molar volume} = \frac{260}{1.5} = 173.33 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{mol}
\]

Next, we convert the molar volume to the volume per molecule by dividing by Avogadro's number (\(6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol}\)):

\[
\text{Volume per molecule} = \frac{173.33}{6.022 \times 10^{23}} \approx 2.878 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{cm}^3/\text{molecule}
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:

**A: \(2.9 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{cm}^3\)**.

Thus, the volume occupied by one molecule of glucose-1-phosphate is approximately \(2.9 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{cm}^3\).
