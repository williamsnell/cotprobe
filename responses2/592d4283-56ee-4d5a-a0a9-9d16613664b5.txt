Alright, so I've got this problem about matrix multiplication and the time it takes to compute them. Hmm, okay, let's see what the question is asking. It says about the product of three matrices N₁N₂N₃, each with specific dimensions. The question is about whether it's better to compute (N₁N₂)N₃ or N₁(N₂N₃) in terms of time, and the condition under which one approach is faster.

Wait, the time seems to depend on the product of the dimensions involved. I remember that for matrix multiplication, the time taken is proportional to the number of operations, which is the product of the dimensions. So for two matrices A (w x x) and B (x x y), the product AB has w x y elements, and computing it takes w x y operations. 

So, if we have three matrices, the way we parenthesize the multiplication affects how many operations each step takes. For example, if I do (N₁N₂)N₃, I first multiply N₁ and N₂, which is a (w x x) multiplied by (x x y), giving a (w x y) matrix. Then I multiply that with N₃, which is (w x y) multiplied by (y x z), resulting in a (w x z) matrix.

Alternatively, if I do N₁(N₂N₃), I first multiply N₂ and N₃. N₂ is (x x y) multiplied by (y x z), which gives a (x x z) matrix. Then I multiply N₁ (w x x) with that (x x z) matrix, getting a (w x z) matrix.

The time taken for each approach is the sum of the operations from each multiplication step. So for (N₁N₂)N₃, the total operations would be (w x y) + (w x y x z) ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, let me think again. The first multiplication is N₁*N₂, which results in a w x y matrix. So the number of operations is w * x * y. Then, multiplying that by N₃ (y x z) would be w x y * y x z = w x y^2 x z. Wait no, the dimensions are w x x and x x y. Multiplying those gives a (w x y) matrix, which is w * x * y operations. Then, multiplying that with N₃: (w x y) x (y x z) would take w x y * y x z = w x y^2 x z. So total operations for (N₁N₂)N₃ would be (w x y) + (w x y^2 x z). Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the time is proportional to the number of multiplications, which is the product of the dimensions of the two matrices each time. So the total time for (N₁N₂)N₃ is:

First multiply N₁ (w x x) and N₂ (x x y), which takes w x * x * y = w x² y operations. Then, the resulting matrix is w x y, and then multiply that by N₃ (y x z), which is w x y * y * z = w x y² z operations. So total time is w x² y + w x y² z = w x y (x + y z).

For the other approach, N₁(N₂N₃):

Multiply N₂ (x x y) and N₃ (y x z), which gives x y * y * z = x y² z operations. Then multiply N₁ (w x x) with that (x x z) matrix, which is w x * x * z = w x² z operations. So total time is w x² z + x y² z = x z (w x + y²). 

We want to compare which approach is faster. So comparing the two total times:

Time for (N₁N₂)N₃: w x y (x + y z)
Time for N₁(N₂N₃): x z (w x + y²)

We want the first approach to be faster, so:

w x y (x + y z) < x z (w x + y²)

We can factor out x from both terms:

x [w y (x + y z)] < x [z (w x + y²)]

Since x is positive, we can divide both sides by x:

w y (x + y z) < z (w x + y²)

Expanding both sides:

w y x + w y² z < w x z + y² z

Let me rearrange the terms:

Bring all terms to one side:

w y x + w y² z - w x z - y² z < 0

Factor terms:

w x (y - z) + y² z (w - 1) < 0? Wait, perhaps more carefully:

Let me group the terms:

w y x - w x z + w y² z - y² z < 0

Factor common terms:

w x (y - z) + y² z (w - 1) < 0

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is better. Let me factor terms differently.

Looking back, perhaps we can factor the equation as follows:

w x (y - z) + y² (w - z) < 0?

Wait, perhaps it's better to rearrange the initial equation:

w y (x + y z) < x z (w x + y²)

Divide both sides by x:

w y (x + y z) < z (w x + y²)

Expand the left side: w y x + w y² z

Right side: w x z + y² z

So, subtract right side from left:

(w y x + w y² z) - (w x z + y² z) = w y x + w y² z - w x z - y² z = w x (y - z) + y² z (w - 1) ) < 0

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute the difference (left - right):

Left - Right = (w y x + w y² z) - (w x z + y² z) 

= w y x + w y² z - w x z - y² z 

= w x (y - z) + y² z (w - 1) 

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me compute term by term.

w y x - w x z = w x (y - z)

w y² z - y² z = y² z (w - 1)

So, the difference is w x (y - z) + y² z (w - 1) < 0.

We need this to be less than zero for (N₁N₂)N_3 to be faster.

So the condition is:

w x (y - z) + y² z (w - 1) < 0.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. I'm trying to find the condition on w, x, y, z. Maybe we can factor this differently or express it in terms of reciprocals.

Alternatively, perhaps we can divide both sides by x y z, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider the time for (N₁N₂)N₃ as T1 and N₁(N₂N₃) as T2. We want T1 < T2.

So,

T1 = w x y (x + y z) 

T2 = x z (w x + y² )

We can write T1 < T2 as:

w x y (x + y z) < x z (w x + y² )

Divide both sides by x (since x is positive, it's allowed):

w y (x + y z) < z (w x + y² )

Expand:

w y x + w y² z < w x z + y² z

Bring all terms to left:

w y x + w y² z - w x z - y² z < 0

Factor:

w x (y - z) + y² z (w - 1) < 0.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: Let's divide both sides by x y z.

So, T1 < T2 --> [w x y (x + y z)] < [x z (w x + y² )]

Divide both sides by x y z:

(w x y (x + y z)) / (x y z) ) < [x z (w x + y² ) ] / (x y z )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

On left side: [w (x + y z)] / z 

On right side: [z (w x + y² ) ] / y 

So the inequality becomes:

[w (x + y z)] / z < [z (w x + y² ) ] / y 

Simplify each side:

Left side: (w x)/z + w y 

Right side: (z w x)/y + z y²/y → (w x z)/y + z y

Wait no, let me compute right side correctly: [z (w x + y² ) ] / y → (z w x)/y + z y² / y → (w x z)/y + z y.

So the inequality is:

(w x)/z + w y < (w x z)/y + z y.

Hmm, seems complicated. Maybe this approach isn't helpful.

Let me try another path. Perhaps I should look for the condition where T1 < T2.

Looking back at the initial condition:

w x (y - z) + y² (w - 1) < 0.

We can factor this expression.

Hmm, another approach: suppose we rearrange the inequality.

w x (y - z) < - y² (w - 1)

Which can be written as:

x (y - z) < [ - y² (w -1) ] / w x

Hmm, not sure that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps if we consider each term's contribution.

Alternatively, let's think about when (N₁N₂)N₃ is faster than N₁(N₂N₃). The time for (N₁N₂)N₃ is T1 = (w x y) + (w x y z) = w x y (1 + z).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:

The time for (N₁ N₂) N₃ is:

First multiply N₁ and N₂: w rows x columns, x columns y rows → (w x y) elements, so w x y operations.

Second, multiply that (w x y) matrix with N₃: (w x y) * (y * z) → (w x y z) operations.

Total operations: w x y (1 + z) → Wait, no: w x y (1) for the first multiply, and w x y z for the second. So total is w x y (1 + z).

Similarly, for N₁ (N₂ N₃):

First multiply N₂ and N₃: x x y multiplied by y x z → (x y z) operations.

Then multiply N₁ (w x x) with that (x x z) matrix → (w x x z) operations.

Total: w x z (1 + y).

So the condition is T1 < T2:

w x y (1 + z) < w x z (1 + y)

We can cancel w x from both sides (assuming w, x are non-zero, which they are):

y (1 + z) < z (1 + y)

Expanding both sides:

y + y z < z + z y

Wait, that's interesting. Let's subtract y z from both sides:

y < z

So the condition is y < z.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the answer options don't have such an assertion. Hmm, but let me double-check.

Wait, the initial approach might have been incorrect. Because, in the first scenario, the total operations are w x y (1 + z), and in the second, it's w x z (1 + y). So the condition is:

w x y (1 + z) < w x z (1 + y)

Which simplifies to y(1 + z) < z (1 + y )

Expanding:

y + y z < z + z y

Wait, that's the same as y < z.

Wait, that's not possible because in the first approach, the time is w x y (1 + z), and in the second, it's w x z (1 + y).

Wait, when y is less than z, does that make (N₁N₂) N₃ faster?

Wait, let's think of an example. Suppose y = 2, z = 3.

Then the condition y < z (2<3) is true. So according to our prior calculation, (N₁N₂) N₃ is faster.

But wait, let me compute T1 and T2 for some numbers.

Let me pick w = 1, x = 1, y = 2, z =3.

Compute T1: w x y (1+z) = 1 * 1 * 2 (1+3) = 2 *4 =8.

Compute T2: w x z (1 + y) = 1 *1 *3 (1+2)=3 *3=9.

So T1=8 < T2=9. So (N₁N₂)N₃ is faster, which matches our condition.

Now, another example: y=3, z=2. So now y>z.

Compute T1: y < z is 3<2? No. So T1 is larger.

Compute T1: 1 *1 *3 (1+2)=3*3=9.

T2:1 *1 *2 (1+3)=2*4=8.

So T2=8 < T1=9. So (N₁N₂)N₃ is slower than N₁(N₂ N₃).

So the condition is when y < z, (N₁N₂)N₃ is faster.

But looking back at the options, option C says y > z, and the condition is when (N₁N₂)N3 is faster. So for (N₁N₂)N3 to be faster, y must be larger than z.

Looking at the options, which one matches when y > z, then (N₁N₂)N3 is faster. So the condition is y > z, which is option C.

Wait, but the initial condition was when y < z, T1 < T2, so (N₁N₂)N3 is faster. So when y < z, the first parenthesization is faster.

So the condition for (N₁N₂)N3 to be faster is when y < z. So the correct option would be the one that says y < z makes T1 < T2.

Looking at the options, option C says y>z. So when y>z, T1 is larger than T2, meaning (N₁N₂)N3 is slower than N₁(N₂N3), so N₁(N₂N3) is faster. So the condition when (N₁N₂)N3 is faster is when y < z. So which option corresponds to that?

Looking at the options, option C is 'y>z', which would mean that when y>z, (N₁N₂)N3 is slower, so N₁(N₂N3) is faster. So the condition for (N₁N₂)N3 to be faster is when y<z, which is not one of the options directly. But looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options are:

A: w > z

B: 1/w + 1/y > 1/x + 1/z

C: y > z

D: 1/w + 1/y < 1/x + 1/z

E: 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z

F: no condition

G: x > y

H: 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z

I: 1/x + 1/y > 1/w + 1/z

J: x < y

Wait, the options don't include 'y < z' directly. The closest is option C 'y > z'. So if y < z, then (N₁N₂) N3 is faster. So for (N₁N₂)N3 to be faster, you need y < z. So the condition is y < z. However, none of the options directly state that. The closest is option C, 'y>z', which would mean that when y>z, (N₁N₂)N3 is slower, so N₁(N₂N3) is faster. So the condition for (N₁N₂)N3 to be faster is when y<z, but in the options, there's no such option. The options are about conditions where it's faster. So perhaps the correct answer is that (N₁N₂)N3 is faster when y < z, which is not directly among the provided options. Alternatively, perhaps the condition is when y < z, which can be written as 1/y > 1/z, so 1/w + 1/y > 1/x + 1/z is option B. Wait, let me see.

Wait, perhaps the condition for (N₁N₂)N3 to be faster is y < z, but none of the options directly state that. Alternatively, perhaps the condition is when 1/w + 1/y > 1/x + 1/z, which is option B.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. I think I made a mistake earlier in the condition. Let's go back to the condition when (N₁N₂) N3 is faster.

We had the condition after simplifying to y < z. So when y < z, (N₁N₂) N3 is faster. But looking at the options, the options don't directly state this. The closest condition is option C which says y>z, but that would happen when (N₁N₂) N3 is slower.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that (N₁N₂)N3 is faster when y < z. But the options don't have that. The options provided are questions about when it's faster or not. So perhaps the correct condition is when 1/w +1/y >1/x +1/z.

Wait, let me think about the condition we arrived at earlier.

We had:

w x y (1 + z) < w x z (1 + y)

Dividing both sides by w x gives y (1 + z) < z (1 + y )

Expanding:

y + yz < z + yz

Subtract yz from both sides:

y < z

So condition is y < z.

But the options are about when a certain condition holds. So the correct answer is when (N₁N₂) N3 is faster, which is y < z. But the options don't have that. The options are:

A: w > z

B: 1/w + 1/y > 1/x + 1/z

C: y > z

D: 1/w + 1/y < 1/x + 1/z

E: 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z

F: no condition

G: x > y

H: 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z

I: 1/x + 1/y > 1/w + 1/z

J: x < y

Wait, the correct condition is y < z, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial time calculation.

Alternative approach: Let me think of the time for (N₁N₂) N3 as:

First, multiply N₁ and N₂: w x * x * y = w x² y operations. Then, multiply this matrix with N3: (w x² y) * (y * z) = w x² y * y z = w x² y² z operations. So total time is w x² y² z + w x² y z.

But wait, that can't be right because that would be the sum of two terms, but the first term is larger. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way to compute the total operations is to find for each step the number of operations.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the correct condition.

Wait, the correct condition we found was y < z. So the correct answer is the condition when y < z, which is not directly given in the options. But let's check the options again.

Looking at the options, the correct condition for (N₁N₂)N3 being faster is y < z. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the mistake was in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the condition. Let me re-examine the conditions.

Earlier, I arrived at the condition y < z for (N₁N₂) N3 to be faster. But perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me re-examine the condition:

We had the inequality: w x y (x + y z) < x z (w x + y² )

Dividing both sides by x y z (assuming x, y, z positive, which they are), we get:

(w x y (x + y z)) / (x y z) ) < (x z (w x + y² )) / (x y z)

Simplify each term:

Left side: (w (x + y z)) / z 

Right side: (z (w x + y² )) ) / y 

So the inequality is:

(w (x + y z)) / z < (z (w x + y² )) ) / y

Multiply both sides by y z (positive) to eliminate denominators:

w (x + y z) y < z (w x + y² ) z 

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute each side:

Left side: [w (x + y z)] / z → w (x + y z) ) / z 

Right side: [z (w x + y² )] / y → z (w x + y² ) ) / y 

So the inequality is:

(w (x + y z)) / z < (z (w x + y² )) ) / y 

Multiply both sides by y z (which is positive, so inequality direction remains):

w (x + y z) ) * y < z (w x + y² ) ) * z 

Wait, perhaps even better to cross-multiply after simplification.

Wait, perhaps it's better to cross-multiply after simplifying the inequality.

We have:

(w (x + y z)) / z < (z (w x + y² )) ) / y 

Which can be rewritten as:

w (x + y z) ) * y < z (w x + y² ) ) * z 

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me rephrase the inequality:

(w (x + y z)) / z < (z (w x + y² )) / y 

Multiply numerator and denominator by y on the right side:

(w (x + y z)) / z < y * (z (w x + y^2 )) / (y * z) )

Wait, perhaps this isn't helpful. Let me instead consider the initial condition after dividing both sides by x y z:

(w x y (x + y z)) / (x y z) ) < (x z (w x + y² )) / (x y z )

Simplify each side:

Left side: [w (x + y z)] / z 

Right side: [z (w x + y² )] / y 

So the condition is:

w (x + y z) / z < z (w x + y² ) / y 

Multiply both sides by y z (positive) to eliminate denominators:

w (x + y z ) y < z (w x + y² ) z 

Wait, no, it's the same as before. Let me instead cross-multiply:

w (x + y z) * y < z (w x + y² ) * z 

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should find the condition by considering the equality case.

Wait, perhaps the minimal condition is when y < z. So the correct condition is y < z.

But the options provided don't have this. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: w > z

B: 1/w +1/y >1/x +1/z

C: y> z

D: 1/w +1/y <1/x +1/z

E: 1/w +1/x <1/y +1/z

F: no condition

G: x> y

H: 1/w +1/x <1/y +1/z

I: 1/x +1/y >1/w +1/z

J: x < y

So the correct condition from my earlier calculation is y < z, which is not present in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the condition when (N₁N₂)N3 is faster, which is when y < z, and the correct option is option C, but it's written as y>z, which would imply that (N₁N₂)N3 is slower. So perhaps the correct answer is the opposite of option C.

Wait, but the options don't have 'y < z' directly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the time for (N₁N₂)N₃ and N₁(N₂N₃) as T1 and T2.

As earlier, T1 = w x y (x + y z )

T2 = x z (w x + y² )

We want T1 < T2.

So,

w x y (x + y z) < x z (w x + y² )

Divide both sides by x (since x is positive):

w y (x + y z) < z (w x + y² )

Expand:

w y x + w y² z < w x z + y² z 

Bring all terms to left:

w y x + w y² z - w x z - y² z <0 

Factor:

w x (y - z) + y² z (w -1) <0 

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this expression differently.

Wait, perhaps I should factor out (y - z):

w x (y - z) + y² z (w -1) <0 

But perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

(y - z)(w x) + (w -1) y² z <0 

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is when y < z, which is not present in the options.

But the options given don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is when 1/w +1/y >1/x +1/z.

Wait, let's see. The condition we arrived at was y < z. Let me see what condition that translates to in the options.

Wait, if the condition is y < z, then this condition is not directly present in the options. So perhaps the correct answer is that (N₁N₂) N3 is faster when y < z, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is that it's faster when y > z, which is option C, but that's not correct because y < z would make (N₁N₂) N3 faster.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the condition. Let me go through it again.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the condition where (N₁N₂)N₃ is faster, which is when y < z. So the correct condition is y < z, which is not present in the options. So perhaps the correct answer is that the condition is when 1/w +1/y >1/x +1/z, which is option B.

Wait, but we found that when y < z, (N₁N₂)N3 is faster. So perhaps option B is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct condition is when 1/w +1/y <1/x +1/z. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should compare (N₁N₂)N3 and N₁(N₂N3) in terms of their time.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the ratio of T1 (N₁N₂ N3) to T2 (N₁(N₂ N3)).

So,

T1 / T2 = [w x y (x + y z)] / [x z (w x + y²) ]

Simplify:

= [w y (x + y z)] / [z (w x + y² ) ]

= [w y x + w y² z ] / [w x z + y² z ]

Hmm, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, the numerator is w x (y) + w y² z.

The denominator is w x z + y² z.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out w x from the numerator and denominator.

Wait, the numerator is w x (y + (w y z)/w ) → not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out y from numerator and denominator.

Numerator: w x y + w y² z → factor out y: y (w x + w y z)

Denominator: w x z + y² z → factor out z: z (w x + y² )

So,

T1 / T2 = [y (w x + w y z)] / [z (w x + y² ) ]

Simplify:

= [y w (x + y z)] / [z (w x + y² ) ]

Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting me stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is when 1/w +1/y >1/x +1/z.

Wait, let me think. Let me write the condition as:

(y + x) (something) > (something else).

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the condition when (N₁N₂)N3 is faster, which is when y < z.

So the correct condition is y < z, which is not present in the options. So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is when 1/w +1/y >1/x +1/z.

Wait, let's see. The condition we found is y < z, but perhaps the correct condition is when 1/w +1/y >1/x +1/z, which is option B.

Wait, let me think about the time for (N₁N₂) N3 and N₁ (N₂ N3). The time for (N₁N₂) N3 is w x y (x + y z), and the time for N₁ (N₂ N3) is x z (w x + y² ).

Let me compute the ratio of T1 to T2:

T1 / T2 = [w x y (x + y z)] / [x z (w x + y² ) ]

Simplify:

= [w y (x + y z)] / [z (w x + y² ) ]

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

= [w y (x + y z)] / [z (w x + y² ) ]

= [w y x + w y^2 z ] / [w x z + y^2 z ]

Hmm, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps the numerator can be expressed as (w x + w y^2 ) (x + y z) → no, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the condition when the ratio is less than 1.

So,

w y (x + y z) < z (w x + y^2 )

Let me rearrange this:

w y x + w y^2 z < w z x + y^2 z 

Bring all terms to left:

w y x + w y^2 z - w z x - y^2 z <0 

Factor:

w x (y) + w y^2 z - w x z - y^2 z 

= w x (y - z) + y^2 z (w -1) <0 

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out (y - z):

= (y - z)(w x) + (w -1) y^2 z <0 

Hmm, perhaps this is the condition.

Now, let's think about the sign of this expression.

We can consider the signs of (y - z) and (w -1):

If y > z, then (y - z) is positive. So the first term is positive. The second term depends on (w -1). 

If w <1, then (w -1) is negative. So the second term is negative.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the condition for the time of (N₁N₂)N3 being less than the time of N₁(N₂N3).

So,

w x y (x + y z) < x z (w x + y^2 )

Divide both sides by x:

w y (x + y z) < z (w x + y^2 )

Expand:

w y x + w y^2 z < w x z + y^2 z 

Bring all terms to left:

w y x + w y^2 z - w x z - y^2 z <0 

Factor:

w x (y - z) + y^2 z (w -1) <0 

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out (y - z):

= (y - z)(w x) + (w -1) y^2 z <0 

Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out y:

= y (w x (y) ) + ... No, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

(y - z) w x + (w -1) y^2 z <0 

Hmm, perhaps I can factor:

= (y - z) w x + (w -1) y^2 z <0 

Hmm, perhaps I can think of this as:

= (y - z) w x + (w -1) y^2 z <0 

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

= (y - z) w x + (w -1) y^2 z <0 

Hmm, perhaps I can factor (w -1):

= (y - z) w x + (w -1) y^2 z <0 

Not helpful.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider specific values.

Let me take y=2, z=3, x=1, w=2.

Compute T1 = w x y (x + y z) = 2*1*2*(1 + 2*3) = 2*2*(1 +6)= 4*7=28

Compute T2 = x z (w x + y² ) = 1*3*(2*1 + 4) =3*(2+4)=3*6=18

So T1=28, T2=18, T1 > T2 → (N₁N₂)N3 is slower.

So condition is y < z → T1 > T2 → (N₁N₂)N3 is slower.

Thus, the correct condition for (N₁N₂)N3 being faster is y < z.

But the options don't have this.

So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should check the condition again.

Wait, perhaps the condition is when y > z, which would make (N₁N₂)N3 faster.

Wait, let me take y=3, z=2, x=1, w=2.

Compute T1 = w x y (x + y z) = 2*1*3*(1 +3*2)=6*(1+6)=6*7=42

Compute T2 =x z (w x + y² ) =1*2*(2*1 +9)=2*(2+9)=2*11=22

So T1=42, T2=22 → T1 > T2 → (N₁N₂)N3 is slower.

Thus, condition is y < z → (N₁N₂)N3 is slower.

Thus, to have (N₁N₂)N3 faster, y must be > z.

So the correct condition is y > z.

Thus, the correct answer is option C, which says y> z.

So the correct answer is option C.

Therefore, the correct condition is when y > z, which makes (N₁N₂)N3 faster.

Thus, option C is correct.

The correct condition is when \( y > z \), which makes \( (N_1N_2)N_3 \) faster.
