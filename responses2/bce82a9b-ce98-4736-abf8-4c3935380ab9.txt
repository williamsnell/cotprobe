Question:

Ms. Ling has been living in her home for exactly 4 years. She knows that there are 12 months in each year. She found the total number of months, m, she has been living in her home by using the number sentence below. 4 × 12 = m Which number sentence shows another way to find the total number of months, m, Ms. Ling has been living in her home?

Options:

A: 12 ÷ m = 4
B: m ÷ 4 = 12
C: m × 4 = 12
D: 12 × m = 4
E: m - 12 = 4
F: 4 × m = 12
G: 4 + m = 12
H: 12 – m = 4
I: m - 4 = 12

Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about Ms. Ling living in her home for 4 years and how to find the total number of months, m. She used the number sentence 4 × 12 = m, which makes sense because each year has 12 months. So, 4 years would be 4×12 months.

But the question is asking for another way to find m. Right now, it's given as 4×12, so I need to find an equivalent expression. Let me think about the operations here. Since multiplication is involved, I need to use the commutative or associative properties to rearrange the numbers.

Wait, the commutative property of multiplication says that the order of the numbers doesn't matter. So, 4×12 is the same as 12×4. So, m would be equal to 12×4. That would make sense because 12×4 is the same as 4×12. So, the equation m × 4 = 12 would be another way to express the total number of months.

Let me check the options. Option C is m ×4 =12. So that's what I thought. Are there any other options that could be correct? Let me go through them.

Option A: 12 ÷ m =4. That would mean m is 12 ÷4, which is 3. But wait, we know m is 48 because 4×12=48. So this would be wrong.

Option B: m ÷4=12. That would mean m is 4×12, which is 48. Wait, no, because if you do m ÷4=12, then m would be 4×12, which is 48. Hmm, but that's the same as the original. So does that mean it's correct? Wait, no, because 4×12=48, so m is 48. So, option B is saying m ÷4=12, which would imply m=48, which is correct. Wait, but that's the same as m=48, which is correct. But in the original, 4×12=48, so m is 48. So, if I have m ÷4=12, that's 48 ÷4=12, which is correct. So that seems to be another way to get m.

Wait, but the initial equation is 4×12=m. So, the question is, which number sentence shows another way to find m. So, 4×12 is m, but another way is m ÷4=12 because if you divide m by 4, you get 12. So that's another valid equation.

But wait, looking back at the options, option H is 12 – m =4. That would mean m is 12 –4=8, which is wrong because m is 48. So that's not correct.

Option G is 4 + m =12. That would mean m=8, which is wrong. So, not correct.

Option F: 4×m =12. That would mean m is 12 ÷4=3. But m is 48, so no.

Option D: 12 ×m =4. That would be 12×m=4. But 12 ×m is 4, so m=4/12=1/3. That's wrong.

Option E: m -12=4. That would mean m=4+12=16. Wrong.

Option I: m -4=12. That would mean m=16, which is wrong.

So, the only correct option that's not the original equation is option B. So, m ÷4=12 is another way to express m=4×12=48. But wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. The question says "another way to find m, which is 4×12=48." So, looking for an equation that equals m=48.

Option B is m ÷4=12 → m=48. Correct. So that's a valid way. But the original equation is 4×12=m, which is also 48. So both expressions are true, but the question is asking for another way to find m, not necessarily that the original equation is the same as another. So both equations are correct, but the options include B and C. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 12 ÷ m =4 → m=12/4=3 → wrong.

B: m ÷4=12 → m=48 → correct.

C: m ×4=12 → m=12/4=3 → wrong, since m is 48.

D: 12 ×m =4 → m=4/12= 1/3 → wrong.

E: m -12=4 → m=16 → wrong.

F:4×m=12 → m=3 → wrong.

G:4 +m=12 → m=8 → wrong.

H:12 –m=4 → m=8 → wrong.

I: m-4=12 → m=16 → wrong.

So, the only correct one is option B: m ÷4=12. Because m is 48, so 48 ÷4 is 12. So that's correct.

Wait, but why did I think of option C initially? Because m ×4=12 would mean m=3, which isn't correct. So the correct answer is option B.
</think>

The correct equation is B: m ÷ 4 = 12, because m is 48, and 48 ÷4 equals 12.

Answer: B
