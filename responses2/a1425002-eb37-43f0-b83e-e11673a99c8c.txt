Okay, so I need to figure out the Yiddish word for a covenant. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Yiddish, but I'll try to remember. I know that in many languages, certain terms have specific meanings. Let me think. 

First, the question is about a covenant. In English, a covenant is a promise made to regulate behavior. I remember hearing the term "Haggadah" in the context of Jewish law. Oh wait, the Haggadah is the law passed in a gathering of Jewish people, right? So it's about the rules and regulations, which includes covenants. So in Yiddish, I think "Haggadah" is the word. 

Looking at the options, option A is Haggadah. Then option B is Halakhah. Wait, I'm not sure what that means. I think Halakhah is related to mathematics, maybe something to do with calculations or measurements. So that's probably not the right choice. 

Option C is Brit. That doesn't seem right. I don't think Yiddish uses the British term. Option D is Bris, which I associate with something else, maybe a place or a color, not a term for a covenant. 

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be A: Haggadah. I'm pretty confident now because I've heard that term before in the context of Jewish law.
