Question:

There is an appreciative sigh throughout the audience in the "mad\textquotedblright scene of "LuciadiLammermoor", when the soprano hits high C. On the musical scale, high C has a frequency of 1,024 sec-^1 . Assuming the velocity of sound in air is 3.317 × 10^4 cmsec-^1 , compute the wavelength of the high C sound wave.

Options:

A: 12.14 cm
B: 40.96 cm
C: 24.29 cm
D: 8.59 cm
E: 81.92 cm
F: 32.39 cm
G: 64.78 cm
H: 48.59 cm
I: 97.18 cm
J: 16.19 cm

Okay, so I have this question about calculating the wavelength of a high C note in a musical context. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that wavelength is related to the speed of sound and the frequency of the sound wave. The formula I think is wavelength equals speed divided by frequency. So wavelength (λ) = v / f.

The question gives me the frequency of high C. High C is, I think, the note that's played when the soprano in a opera is hitting high C. I recall that the standard tuning for an octave in music is C4, which is 261.63 Hz. But wait, high C is usually the next note. In some cases, high C is C5, which is 325 Hz. Hmm, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact frequency. Oh wait, the problem says high C has a frequency of 1,024 sec^-1. Oh wait, wait a second, that can't be right because 1,024 is a number, but the units are seconds^-1. Wait, no, the frequency in this context is probably 1024 Hz. Because, in music, the standard A4 is 440 Hz, C4 is 523.26 Hz. So high C would be higher than that. Let me think: C's frequency increases by an octave each time. So A is 440, Bb is 277, then C is 261.63, which is C4. Then C5 is 523.26 Hz. Wait, no, wait, when it's high C, I think it's C5. So C5 is 523.26 Hz. But the problem says high C has 1024 sec^-1. Oh wait, that's 1024 Hz. That's much higher. So that's probably the correct frequency. So f = 1024 Hz.

Then, the speed of sound is given as 3.317 × 10^4 cm sec^-1. Wait, 3.317e4 is 33,170 cm/s. So the speed of sound is 33,170 cm per second.

So applying the formula, λ = v/f = 33170 / 1024.

Let me compute that.

Dividing 33170 by 1024.

Hmm, 1024 is 2^10, which is 1024. So let's see:

33170 / 1024 ≈ ?

Well, 1024 * 32 = 32768, because 1024 * 32 is 32768.

33170 - 32768 = 402.

So that's 32 and 402/1024.

402 divided by 1024 is approximately 0.392578125.

So total is about 32.392578 cm.

Looking at the options, option F is 32.39 cm. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers.

33170 divided by 1024.

Alternatively, I can compute this.

1024 × 32 = 32768.

33170 - 32768 = 402.

So 32.392578 cm.

Looking at the options, F is 32.39 cm. So the correct answer should be F.

The question asks to compute the wavelength of the high C note in the "LuciadiLammermoor" scene, given that the frequency of high C is 1024 Hz and the speed of sound is 3.317 × 10⁴ cm/s (or 33,170 cm/s). The formula for wavelength is:

\[
\text{wavelength} = \frac{\text{speed of sound}}{\text{frequency}}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{wavelength} = \frac{33,170}{1024} \approx 32.39 \, \text{cm}
\]

Among the provided options, the value closest to 32.39 cm is **32.39 cm**, which corresponds to option F.

ANSWER: F
