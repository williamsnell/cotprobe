Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the right answer to this question about older adults and their abilities related to memory and anxiety. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking what older adults do to improve their memory and reduce anxiety about declining memory. The options are A to J. I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll go through each option one by one.

Option A: Engage in social activities and interact with peers. Hmm, social activities might help with social skills and interactions, which can improve memory indirectly through better retention and transfer. But does it directly address memory decline?

Option B: Practice mindfulness and meditation. I remember that mindfulness can reduce stress and anxiety, which might help them feel more confident about their memory. But does this directly improve memory itself, or just reduce anxiety about it?

Option C: Engage in physical activity. Physical activity definitely helps with memory because it keeps the brain active. It might improve cognitive function and memory retention. This seems like a solid option.

Option D: Solve puzzles and engage in brain-stimulating activities. Puzzles and other brain games are known to enhance memory and problem-solving skills. They might help in improving the ability to retain and recall information, which is a key part of memory.

Option E: Learn that memory does not decline and even get better. This sounds like it's addressing the underlying cause of memory decline. If they understand that their memory isn't going to decline, they might be more motivated to improve it. This could be a valid reason for improving memory.

Option F: Learn memory enhancement techniques. This directly involves techniques that can help improve memory, so that's a good option.

Option G: Take memory-enhancing medications. I'm not sure about the benefits of this. Some medications might help with memory issues, but I don't recall older adults having specific memory problems that require medication to improve. Plus, this could be a more advanced approach.

Option H: Learn about memory and aging techniques. This is a bit vague. It might include knowing what's normal and how to maintain good memory skills, but I'm not sure if it directly helps with improving memory.

Option I: Consume a diet rich in antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids. Antioxidants and omega-3s are good for the brain, but do they directly help with memory? Some aspects of the brain, like the brain's structure and function, might improve, but I'm not sure if this is a primary method for older adults to enhance memory.

Option J: Older adults cannot do either. This doesn't make sense because there are definitely ways to improve memory and manage anxiety.

Now, thinking about each option again. The question is asking what older adults do to improve their memory and reduce anxiety. So, the key actions would be things that directly address these issues.

Option C, physical activity, is a common strategy. It's widely accepted that regular exercise can improve cognitive function, including memory.

Option D, brain-stimulating activities, can also be effective. Puzzles and other activities keep the brain active, which might help with memory.

Option E, understanding that memory isn't declining, could motivate them to take steps to improve it, like learning techniques or maybe starting with activity-based approaches.

Wait, but the question is about what they do to improve their memory. So, each option presents a different action. Let's think about which of these are actually effective.

Physical activity (C) is a well-established method. It's linked to better memory and cognitive function. Similarly, brain-stimulating activities (D) can help with memory.

Option E is about understanding the cause, which can motivate them. But does that directly involve improving memory techniques?

Actually, I think the best answer is either C or E. But wait, the question is about what they do to improve their memory. If they engage in physical activity, they directly improve memory. So C is a good answer.

Alternatively, if they learn to deal with anxiety, that's part of E, but the question is specifically about improving memory, not addressing anxiety itself.

Wait, looking back, the question is about improving their memory and reducing anxiety. So both aspects are important.

So, older adults might engage in social activities (A) to improve memory by social interaction, which can help in retaining information better. Or they might practice mindfulness (B) to reduce anxiety, making them more comfortable with memory issues.

Physical activity (C) is a big one because it keeps the brain active. Puzzles (D) and enhancing techniques (F) are also effective.

But the options are separate; the question is for each, so the correct answer is probably one of the options.

Looking back, older adults are more likely to engage in physical activity. Social activities can also help, but physical activity is a broad category. For example, option A is about social activities, which could include social media or socializing with peers. However, physical activity is a more direct and well-known method.

So, the best answer is C: They engage in physical activity regularly.

The correct answer is C: They engage in physical activity regularly. This is a well-established method that directly improves cognitive function, including memory, and is widely recognized as an effective strategy for older adults. 

Answer: C
