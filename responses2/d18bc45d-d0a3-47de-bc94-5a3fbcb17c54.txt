Question:

Loretta Landlord owned a commercial building in a commercial strip surrounded by a residential community. One of her largest spaces was rented on a month-to-month basis at $500 per month by a dance troop which held performances in the facility. The director of the dance troop moved to New York for a starring role Off-Broadway. Unfortunately the troop was unable to find another dance director, so it folded and vacated the space. Sally Sleazy learned of the closure and decided the location would be perfect for a topless strip joint. Sally rented the space from Loretta under a two-year lease at $1,000 per month without disclosing her intended use of the space. One month after the strip joint opened, the County Commissioners passed a new law prohibiting topless strip joints in that neighborhood. Sally told Loretta the new law made it impossible to operate the business, so she was leaving. If Loretta then sued Sally for breach of the lease contract, the likely outcome is a judgment for

Options:

A: Loretta, only if she can prove that Sally knew about the upcoming law change.
B: Loretta, if she can prove that Sally intended to breach the contract from the start.
C: Sally, because the change in law was beyond her control.
D: Sally, because the law change is a valid reason for terminating the lease.
E: Sally, because the law made performance of the lease contract impossible.
F: Sally, because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance.
G: Loretta, only if she did not know of the use Sally intended for the space.
H: Loretta, because the new law was passed after the lease was executed.
I: Sally, because the law change made the purpose of the lease void.

Okay, so I have this law question about lease agreements and a case where Sally and Loretta Landlord are involved. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me read the scenario carefully. Loretta owns a commercial building with a commercial strip surrounded by a residential community. She's renting a large space on a month-to-month basis to a dance troop for $500 per month. The dance troop moved to New York for a starring role Off-Broadway. They couldn't find another dance director, so they folded and vacated the space. Sally Sleazy heard about this closure and decided the location would work for a topless strip joint. She then rented the space from Loretta under a two-year lease at $1,000 per month without mentioning the purpose. 

A month after the joint opened, the County Commissioners passed a new law that prohibited topless strip joints in that area. Sally told Loretta that the law made it impossible to operate the business, so she left. Now, Loretta is suing Sally for breach of the lease contract. The question is about what the outcome would be for Loretta.

I remember that when a lease is breached, the standard is usually that the landlord (Loretta) must prove that she knew about the breach and that it was unreasonable. But there are exceptions, especially if the breach is so egregious that it's beyond her control. 

In this case, Sally rented the space under a lease for $1,000 per month, which is more than the $500 she was getting when the space was vacated. The new law is a recent law, and Sally knew about it when she told Loretta. So, Sally might have taken reasonable steps to realize the problem.

Wait, but Loretta didn't know about the new law. The lease was with her, and Sally got the $1,000 per month from her without any mention of the law. The fact that the law was passed after the lease was signed is important. If the law was passed after the contract was executed, Sally would have had no time to act on it because the lease was already up.

So, for breach by leasure, the landlord must prove that they knew of the breach. Since Sally knew of the law change when she told Loretta, but Loretta didn't know about it, Sally might have acted on it beyond her control. That could be a reason to hold Sally liable.

Looking at the options: 

Option B says Loretta can be sure Sally intended to breach because Sally knew about the law change. But wait, Sally just knew about the law change, but she didn't breach the lease. She used the opportunity to leave, perhaps. So the breach is not about intent, but about knowledge or control.

Option D says Sally is liable because the law was a valid reason. But I'm not sure about that. The law was after the lease, so Sally couldn't have known about it at the time of the lease. So she didn't have the chance to act on it.

Option F says Sally was discharged under impossibility. I think that's not the case. She may have taken the opportunity to leave, but that doesn't necessarily mean she breached the lease. The lease was a contract that she had, and if she used her right to leave to terminate it, that's an implied termination. But the question is about breach, which requires the landlord to have knowledge.

Wait, the question is about breach of lease contract. So Sally's action was to leave because of the law. But the question is whether Sally breached the lease because she knew about the law.

In the case of a lease being used for an activity (like a strip joint), the landlord may have a duty to consider the reasonableness of the use. If the new law is so severe that it's impossible to continue, the landlord should have known about it and acted. But if Sally knew about it when she told Loretta, perhaps she had a duty to act.

But another angle: the lease was for $1,000, which is more than $500. The problem is that she could have used the $500 to rent to the dance troop, but now she's using it for a joint. If the law prohibits topless strip joints, she might have used her right to leave.

But the question is about breach of the lease contract. So whether Sally breached the lease. Breach requires that the landlord knew of the breach and that it was unreasonable. If Sally knew about the new law, she might have acted upon it. But the question is whether Sally breached, not whether she acted.

Wait, but let's think about the law. If the lease was for $1,000, and she had the option to leave, she could have used her right to leave to terminate the lease. That's an implied contract consideration. So maybe she didn't breach the lease contract, but just used her right to leave.

But the question is about the outcome when Sally was sued for breach. So the question is, under what circumstances would she be liable.

Another point: the lease contract was entered into, so Sally's intent to breach is tied to her knowledge. If Sally knew about the law when she told Loretta, perhaps she had the reason to act. But the lease terms don't mention the law, so Sally might have known about it when she told Loretta.

So, is Sally liable? The lease was for $1,000, but she could have used the option to leave. The new law is a reason why she may have had the opportunity to leave, but that doesn't mean she breached the lease contract. Breach is about the landlord knowing of the breach and acting. If Sally knew about the law change, she might have acted, but she didn't breach.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the options again.

Option B: "Loretta, only if she can prove that Sally knew about the upcoming law change." But Sally knew about the law change when she told Loretta, but did she breach the lease?

Option F: "Sally, because the law change is a valid reason for terminating the lease." But the lease was for $1,000, which is more than the $500 she's getting for the space. The new law is a reason why she used the space for a joint, but the lease is still a contract, and she didn't breach it.

Wait, but perhaps the new law is a reason to terminate the lease. But the lease is a two-year contract for $1,000. If she used it for a joint, perhaps she could have terminated the lease, but under the lease terms, she might have been allowed to do that.

But the question is about breach. So if she knew about the law change and used the opportunity to leave, she might have acted but not breached. The breach would require that the landlord knew of the breach and acted. If she knew about the law, she might have acted, but she didn't breach.

So what would the outcome be? The question is what the likely outcome is for Sally, meaning whether she can successfully claim breach.

Another angle: the lease contract is between Loretta and Sally. If Sally used the right to leave to terminate the lease, that's implied. Therefore, she didn't breach the contract. Therefore, the landlord (Loretta) wouldn't be liable because she didn't breach the contract.

But the question is about the outcome of the lawsuit. So Sally may have had the opportunity to terminate the lease, but the lease itself wasn't breached. Therefore, Loretta wouldn't be liable.

Wait, but the answer options are about Loretta's possible outcome.

So if Sally knew about the new law and used it to terminate the lease, she didn't breach the contract. Therefore, Loretta wouldn't be liable.

Looking at the options: 

Option F says that Sally would be discharged under impossibility. I don't think that's correct because she didn't use the law to terminate the lease. She used it to leave, which is implied.

Option D says Sally is liable because the law was a valid reason. But in this case, Sally knew about the law change, so she might have acted, but not breached.

Option B says Sally is liable only if she knew about the breach. But breach requires the landlord to know of the breach, which she did.

Wait, but breach also requires that the breach is unreasonable. The new law being a valid reason for termination is a reason for termination, but under the lease, she had the right to leave. So the landlord shouldn't be liable for breach. But the question is about whether Sally is liable for breach.

Alternatively, if the new law made it impossible to use the space, and she used her right to leave, she may have terminated the lease, but that's implied, not breach.

Wait, but the options say "the likely outcome is a judgment for" something.

Looking back, the possible outcomes in common law are that the landlord (Loretta) has to prove that she knew of the breach and that the breach was unreasonable.

In this case, Sally knew about the law change. Therefore, Loretta would have to prove that she knew about the change at the time of the lease. If she did, then she's liable for breach.

But wait, the new law was passed after the lease was signed. So Sally knew about the law change when she told Loretta, but she didn't have time to act on it because the lease was already up.

But that's about her action, not about breach. Breach is about the landlord knowing and acting.

So, if Sally knew about the new law, she's liable for breach. So the outcome would be a judgment for Sally.

But let me think again. The lease was for $1,000, which is more than the $500 she would get if the space was vacant. So, she used the $500 to rent the space to the dance troop. Now, she used the opportunity to leave because of the law. But the lease was a contract, so she wouldn't breach it. The lease would have been considered valid, but she used the right to leave to terminate it, which is implied.

Alternatively, maybe the new law was a breach because she was using the space for a joint, which is an activity that requires more resources. But the lease itself doesn't state this, so she might not have breached.

Wait, but the question is about breach, so it's about whether the landlord knew of the breach and acted.

Since the new law was a reason for the joint, Sally knew about it when she told Loretta. So, she had knowledge, which could mean breach.

Looking at the options, the correct one would be B: Loretta, if she can prove Sally knew about the upcoming law change.

But wait, could Sally have known about the law change before the lease? The question says she learned of the closure and decided the location would be perfect. She then signed the lease with $1,000 per month. The new law was passed after the lease was executed.

So Sally knew about the law when she told Loretta, but she didn't act because she didn't have time. But that's about her action, not breach.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Loretta, if she can prove that Sally knew about the upcoming law change.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the new law was after the lease, Sally knew of it when she told Loretta, but she didn't act on it, so she didn't breach the lease. But the question is about breach. So if the answer is about whether Sally is liable, then the answer is that she would be liable if she knew about the issue.

Wait, but the new law was a reason for her termination. The lease was for $1,000, which is higher than $500. So she might have used the $500 to take the space, but now she's using it for a strip joint. But the lease itself is a contract, so she wouldn't breach it.

But perhaps the lease was for a commercial space. The new law was about a commercial strip. So perhaps the landlord didn't have the right to use it for a strip joint.

Wait, that's a key point. The new law prohibited topless strip joints in that area, which is a commercial strip. So the space she's using now is a topless strip joint. So she's violating the lease by using it for a joint. Therefore, she's breaching the lease contract.

So the question is whether she knew about the law change. She did know, because she knew about the new law when she told Loretta. Therefore, she breached the lease. So the outcome would be a judgment for Sally.

But in the options, the correct answer would be that Sally is liable, because she knew about the law change. So looking at the options, option F says Sally is because the law was a valid reason for termination. But that's about the termination via the lease, not breach.

Wait, but the lease itself is a contract, so she didn't breach it. But she used it for a joint, which is an activity that might require more resources. But the lease didn't state that, so she didn't breach it.

But if she used the opportunity to leave, she may have terminated the lease, but that's implied, not breach.

Wait, but the question is about breach. Breach requires that the landlord knew of the breach and acted. Since Sally knew about the law, she may have acted. But she didn't breach the lease. The lease was just a contract, and she used the opportunity to leave, not breach.

But wait, the scenario says that Sally was the one who signed the lease. The law was passed after the lease was signed. So Sally knew about the law change when she told Loretta, but she didn't act on it because she didn't have time to use the space.

But in terms of the lease being breached, she might have taken the opportunity, but she didn't breach it. So she didn't breach the lease contract.

But the answer options are looking for what the outcome would be for Loretta, not Sally.

The question is about whether Sally can successfully claim breach.

I think the correct reasoning is that Sally knew about the new law when she told Loretta, and perhaps she had the right to terminate the lease. But the lease itself isn't breached.

In this case, the correct outcome would be that Sally is liable because she knew about the law change, which made it impossible to perform, so she could have terminated the lease, but under the lease, she had the right to leave. So the landlord shouldn't be liable for breach. But the question is about whether Sally can claim breach, not whether Loretta is liable.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to summarize:

The lease was for $1,000, more than the $500 she'd get if the space was vacant. Now, she's using it for a strip joint, which the new law prohibits. She knew about the law when she told Loretta, so she had knowledge. But the question is if she breached the lease.

Under common law, breach requires that the landlord knew of the breach and acted. If Sally knew about the law at the time of the lease, she's liable for breach. But the new law was passed after the lease, so she didn't know about it when the lease was signed.

Wait, no, she knew about the law change when she told Loretta. She didn't act because she didn't have time.

But breach requires that the landlord knew of the breach and acted. So, if Sally knew about the new law, she could have acted, but she didn't because she didn't have the opportunity to act on it.

So, the answer is that Sally would be liable for breach, because she knew about the new law.

Looking at the options, option B says: "Loretta, only if she can prove that Sally knew about the upcoming law change."

But option F says: "Sally, because the law change is a valid reason for terminating the lease."

Wait, but that's about why she could terminate, not about breach.

So perhaps the correct answer is option F, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I think that in this case, the new law made it impossible to use the space for a strip joint, which is an activity requiring more resources. Since she was using it for a joint, which is prohibited, she's breaching the lease. So the landlord (Loretta) didn't breach because she didn't know about the law change when the lease was signed. She knew about it when she told Sally, but she didn't act because she didn't have time.

Wait, but if the landlord didn't act, but Sally knew about the law, then the landlord (Loretta) didn't breach the lease. So Sally would not be liable for breach.

But the options don't mention that. So looking for the question's intent.

The question is about the likely outcome for Sally, so whether she can claim breach.

The correct answer is option B, because Sally knew about the new law, so she could have acted, leading to breach. But wait, the new law was passed after the lease. So Sally didn't know about it when she signed the lease.

Wait, no. The question states that Sally knew about the closure and that the new law was passed after the lease. So she knew about the law change, but she didn't act on it. So she didn't breach the lease.

Wait, but her knowledge might have allowed her to act, but she didn't. So the landlord didn't breach, but Sally used her right to leave.

But the question is about the outcome for Sally in her lawsuit. So the likely outcome would be that Sally can claim breach, because she knew about the new law and at the time of the lease, she could have acted.

Wait, but the lease was for $1,000, which is more than the $500 she would get for the space if the lease was up. So she used the $500 to rent to the dance troop, and now she's using it for a joint, making it impossible.

But the lease itself is a contract. So she would not breach the lease contract. The breach would be the use of the space for a joint, which is an activity that's prohibited.

So why would Sally be liable? Because she knew about the law change, but she didn't act. Therefore, she didn't breach the contract. But the question is about whether she can claim breach.

In that case, the answer would be that Sally can claim breach because she knew about the law change and at the time of the lease, she could have acted.

Wait, but the new law was passed after the lease was signed. So Sally knew about the law change when she told Loretta, but she didn't have time to act on it because the lease was up. So she didn't breach the contract.

Therefore, the outcome for Sally would be that she can't claim breach because she didn't act. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the new law made the space impossible to use, so she used her right to leave. But under the lease's terms, she could have used the right to leave, but the question is about breach.

I think the correct answer is B: Loretta, only if she can prove that Sally knew about the upcoming law change.

But I'm not fully confident. Another angle: in cases where the new law makes the space unleaseable, the landlord is not liable for breach because the landlord didn't breach the contract. However, Sally could have used her right to leave. But the question is about breach.

Wait, but the lease itself is a contract, so Sally didn't breach it. The breach would be her use of the space for a joint. But the question is about whether she can claim breach.

So the likely outcome for Sally would be that she can't be held liable because she didn't breach the contract. But the options don't include that.

Wait, the question is about the likely outcome for Sally, not Loretta. So if she can claim breach, what would that outcome be for Sally?

Alternatively, the correct answer is F: Sally is liable because the law change is a valid reason. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the right answer is F. Because if the law prevented the space from being used, then Sally's use of the space for a joint would be a breach of the lease contract. But the lease itself is a contract, so she wouldn't be liable for that. But under the lease terms, she may have had the right to leave, which she didn't act on because she didn't have time.

But this is getting too complicated. Based on the options, the correct answer is B or F.

I think the answer is B because Sally knew about the law change when she told Loretta. But the new law was passed after the lease, so she didn't know about it when the lease was signed.

Wait, no. The question says Sally learned about the closure and decided the space would be perfect. So she knew about the new law only when she told Loretta, which was after the lease was signed.

So when she told Loretta, the new law was passed. So Sally knew about the law change when she told Loretta, but she didn't have the opportunity to act on it because the lease was signed.

But breach requires that the landlord knew of the breach and acted. If she knew about it, she might have acted, leading to breach.

So the outcome would be that Sally is liable for breach because she knew about the new law change when she told Loretta.

So the answer is B.
</think>

The lease was for $1,000, which is more than the $500 she would get if the space was vacant. Now, she's using it for a topless strip joint, which the new law prohibits. The question is whether Sally knew about the new law when she told Loretta and whether she could claim breach of the lease contract.

 breach requires that the landlord knew of the breach and acted. If Sally knew about the law change when she told Loretta, she might have acted, leading to breach. However, the new law was passed after the lease was signed, so Sally knew about it when she told Loretta but didn't have the opportunity to act on it. Therefore, the likely outcome is that Sally is liable for breach because she knew about the law change when she told Loretta.

ANSWER: B
