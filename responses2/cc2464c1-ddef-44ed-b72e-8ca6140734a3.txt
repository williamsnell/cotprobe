Alright, let's tackle this multiple-choice question. So, the question is about two statements regarding deep learning architectures and their memory costs. The statements are:

Statement 1: Highway networks were introduced after ResNets and eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions.
Statement 2: DenseNets usually cost more memory than ResNets.

We have to evaluate whether each statement is true, partially true, or false, and then match the options (A to J) to the correct combination.

First, I'll break down each statement.

Starting with Statement 1: The idea that highway networks came after ResNets and replaced max pooling with convolutions. I remember that ResNets, or Residual networks, were introduced by He et al. in 2015. They are known for their deep architecture which allows for the training of very deep networks without the vanishing gradient problem. Highway networks, which are a type of residual network that allows for faster convergence by bypassing the need for skip connections, were introduced later, around 2017. So, highway networks were indeed introduced after ResNets. Now, about the pooling: in ResNets, max pooling is used, but they also use other types like average or even spatial max pooling. However, the statement says they eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions. That can't be right because ResNets do use convolutions for feature extraction. So, their highway networks didn't replace max pooling with convolutions. Instead, they used convolutions for the residual blocks. So Statement 1 is false because the highway networks didn't replace max pooling; they used convolutions instead.

Moving on to Statement 2: DenseNets usually cost more memory than ResNets. DenseNets are another type of residual network, which I think are similar to highway networks but have a different structure. They typically have a lot of connections between each layer because each node in a layer is connected to all nodes in the next layer, which is why they are called 'dense'. This structure uses a lot of memory because each layer is connected to the next without any skip connections, which means all the weights are stored. ResNets, on the other hand, use skip connections, so they share weights and don't store all the intermediate layers. So, dense nets usually use more memory. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, maybe I got that mixed up. Let me think again. ResNets have skip connections, so the network doesn't need to memorize the features of each previous layer. That allows for faster training. DenseNets, or Dense Blocks, have all connections, so they don't share weights. So, each layer is connected to every layer that comes after. This means that each layer has to store all the weights from the previous layers, leading to a higher memory footprint. So yes, dense networks usually use more memory. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but the statements: Statement 1 is false because highway networks didn't replace max pooling; ResNets used convolutions and max pooling, but highway networks used convolutions and perhaps different pooling methods. Or was the statement about replacing max with conv? The statement says they eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions. That's incorrect because ResNets do use convolutions. So statement 1 is false.

So, statement 1 is false, statement 2 is true. Looking at the options, option G says "True, False." So the correct answer would be G: The first statement is false, the second is partially true? Wait, no. Let me look back at the options.

Wait, the options are A through J. Let me read the options again.

The options are:

A: True, True
B: Both statements are partially true
C: The first statement is false, the second is partially true
D: The first statement is partially true, the second is false
E: The first statement is true, the second is undetermined
F: False, False
G: True, False
H: Both statements are undetermined
I: The first statement is undetermined, the second is true
J: False, True

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Statement 2 says DenseNets usually cost more memory than ResNets. But wait, is that true? Because when I thought about it, dense networks have more parameters because each layer is connected to all the next layers. That would require more memory. So statement 2 is true.

Wait, wait another moment. Let me make sure about the memory cost of ResNets and DenseNets. ResNets have, in each block, a lot of parameters because each layer is connected to the next, but they use skip connections, so they don't need to store the features from the previous layers. So the memory is lower per layer. DenseNets, however, are designed to have each layer connected to all the layers after, meaning each layer has a lot of parameters, so they use more memory. So yes, statement 2 is true.

So statement 1 is false, statement 2 is true. So looking at the options, option G is "True, False." So the answer is G.

Wait, but looking again, the options are:

Wait, looking at the question again, the options are labeled F to J, but the first part of the option labels is not clear. Let me check.

Wait, the options are:

F: False, False

G: True, False

H: Both statements are undetermined

Wait, no, the options are:

A: True, True

B: Both statements are partially true

C: The first statement is false, the second is partially true

D: The first statement is partially true, the second is false

E: The first statement is true, the second is undetermined

F: False, False

G: True, False

H: Both statements are undetermined

I: The first statement is undetermined, the second is true

J: False, True

So, statement 1 is false, statement 2 is true. Which matches option G: True, False.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought statement 1 is false, statement 2 is true. So the correct option is G.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in evaluating statement 1.

Let me reevaluate statement 1: Highway networks were introduced after ResNets and eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions. So, does it say that highway networks were introduced after ResNets? Yes. And did they replace max pooling with convolutions? No. They used convolutions as part of the highway networks, but didn't replace max pooling. So statement 1 claims that highway networks eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions. That's incorrect, because they use convolutions instead of max pooling. So statement 1 is false.

So yes, statement 1 is false, statement 2 is true. So the correct option is G, which is "True, False." So the answer is G.
</think>

The correct answer is G: True, False.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Statement 1**: The claim is that highway networks were introduced after ResNets and eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions. However, highway networks were introduced after ResNets (introduced in 2015). Additionally, ResNets do use convolutions for feature extraction, not max pooling. Highway networks do use convolutions but do not replace max pooling. Thus, the statement is false.

2. **Statement 2**: DenseNets, as an alternative to highway networks, typically require more memory than ResNets. This is because DenseNets have a dense structure, meaning each layer is connected to all subsequent layers, leading to higher memory usage. Hence, the statement is true.

3. **Options Matching**: Since Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true, the correct option is G: True, False.
