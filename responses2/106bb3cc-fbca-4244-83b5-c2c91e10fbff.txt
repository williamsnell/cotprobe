Question:

Research has shown that people who read a job description written only with male pronouns (e.g., he, his) are more likely to think of an employee as male than people who read a description that uses gender-neutral language (e.g., he or she). This finding is most closely linked to

Options:

A: the linguistic relativity hypothesis.
B: gender schema theory.
C: the social role hypothesis.
D: modeling.

Okay, so I have this question about job descriptions and pronouns. Let me see if I can figure this out. The question says that people who read a job description using only male pronouns are more likely to think of an employee as male. And the options are about different theories. 

I remember from my psychology class that pronouns can influence how people perceive others. Like, if a person hears a description with "he" and thinks of a male, that's the same gender as the pronoun. But if it's neutral, like "she," it might not change the perception as much.

I think the question is about the link between pronouns and how people categorize employees. I've heard about gender roles and stereotypes before. Oh right, there's a term called the social role hypothesis. It's something about how people's roles in society affect their perception of others.

Wait, the social role theory suggests that people believe they fit into certain roles and then react accordingly. So if a job description says "male" or "he," people might think of an employee as male because they associate with that role. That makes sense. So the pronouns aren't just neutral; they're part of the social role they're assigned.

Looking at the options: A is linguistic relativity, which is about whether language affects thought. But this question is about the role of pronouns. B is gender schema theory, which deals with how people categorize others based on stereotypes. C is social role theory, which is exactly what I was thinking about. D is modeling, which is about how others learn behaviors from role models. But this question seems more about the perception tied to the pronouns, not the modeling process.

So the correct answer should be C: the social role hypothesis.

The correct answer is C: the social role hypothesis.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

- The question links gender-neutral job descriptions to employee perception based on pronouns, prompting a consideration of how pronouns influence categorization.
- The social role theory posits that people categorize others based on their assumed roles, influenced by societal roles and stereotypes.
- The pronouns "he" or "she" in job descriptions affect perceptions by associating with male or female roles, aligning with the social role theory.
- Other options like linguistic relativity or gender schema theory are less directly related, while modeling is a different concept.

**Answer:** C: the social role hypothesis.
