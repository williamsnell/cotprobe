Okay, so I need to figure out the original name of the Apple Macintosh XL computer. Hmm, I remember that Apple developed several Macintosh computers back in the 80s and 90s. Let me think about the models.

The Macintosh series started with the 32, 48, 51, 68, and 1080. The XL model was one of them. Wait, I think the original name was something like the Plus model. Oh right, the Apple Macintosh Plus. I think that was introduced in the late 80s or early 90s. The XL probably was a later model, maybe a successor or a later version.

Looking at the options: A is Macintosh Extra Large, not sure. B is Apple Macintosh Plus, which fits. C is Supreme, which I think was a newer model. D is X, which I don't think refers to that. E is Orange XL, not sure. F is Macintosh Senior, maybe that's another model. G, H, I, J are other names I don't recall matching.

So the correct answer should be option B, the Apple Macintosh Plus.
