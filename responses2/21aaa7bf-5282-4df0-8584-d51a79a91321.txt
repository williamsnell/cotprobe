Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"But you, my dear Pangloss," said Candide, "how can it be that I behold you again?"
"It is true," said Pangloss, "that you saw me hanged&….A surgeon purchased my body, carried home, and dissected me. He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&…[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&….
One day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&….She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&….We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us."
"Well, my dear Pangloss," said Candide to him, "when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?"
"I am still of my first opinion," answered Pangloss, "for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis."
Voltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759
Candide's statement that "everything always happens for the best" can be seen as a reflection of the Enlightenment belief that

C: only free markets can lead nations to wealth and happiness
D: the only purpose of a government is to secure the rights of life, liberty, and property
E: individuals are the best judges of their own interests
F: only through suffering can one achieve enlightenment

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Enlightenment beliefs. The question is about Candide's statement that everything happens for the best and how it reflects on the Enlightenment. The options are A through J, each making a different claim about the Enlightenment belief.

First, I'll recall what I know about Enlightenment thought. The Enlightenment was a period in history associated with the French Enlightenment, which emphasized reason, individual freedom, and the scientific method. People believed in natural laws, the idea that everything works for the best, and that government should be based on reason rather than magic or magic-based power. Also, the Enlightenment saw individuals as being in charge of their own destiny, and they didn't believe in magic or divine will.

So, Candide's statement that everything happens for the best is a key point from the Enlightenment. It reflects on how people believed in the best outcomes, but also the inherent nature of the world. The Enlightenment didn't accept magic, so they held that the world has laws and order, and people should seek them out, not resort to magic.

Looking at the options:

A: A people without a strong central authority are doomed to live in a state of nature. This sounds like a more modern or secular view, not necessarily related to the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment focused on individual freedom and reason, not just natural tendencies.

B: Humans are inherently corrupt and need strict laws to maintain order. That's the opposite of Enlightenment beliefs. They believed people were rational and self-serving, not corrupt.

C: Only free markets can lead nations to wealth and happiness. That's more modern, focusing on economic theory rather than Enlightenment ideas about reason and individual responsibility.

D: The only purpose of a government is to secure the rights of life, liberty, and property. The Enlightenment emphasized that governments should be based on reason, not magic. They thought that justice and order come from the inherent rights of people, not from any external force.

E: Individuals are the best judges of their own interests. While true self-interest is a concept, the Enlightenment didn't support this idea. Instead, they believed in the importance of reason and collective action.

F: Only through suffering can one achieve enlightenment. This is a modern view, often associated with religious beliefs. The Enlightenment didn't believe in suffering; they focused on reason and individual progress.

G: Society can be perfected if you apply the scientific method to it. The Enlightenment did emphasize scientific methods and reason, not necessarily the scientific method as a form of government.

H: The world is inherently chaotic and unpredictable. This is the opposite of Enlightenment views. They believed in an ordered, natural world, not one that's chaotic.

J: The universe is a pre-determined and unchangeable system. This is a secular belief, not related to the Enlightenment. It's more about the idea of a fixed, predetermined order, which doesn't fit.

Wait, so the correct answer would be D. Because the Enlightenment thought that governments should act based on reason, not magic. So Candide's statement reflects that.

The Enlightenment belief that everything happens for the best reflects the idea that people should act based on reason, rather than relying on magic or divine power. This aligns with the Enlightenment's emphasis on individual responsibility, collective action, and the belief in the natural order of the world. 

Answer: D
