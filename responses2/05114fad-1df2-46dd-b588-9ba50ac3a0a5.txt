Okay, so I've got this question here about passing an algebra test at Academic Academy. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that to pass, you need to score at least 80%. There are 35 problems on the test. They're asking what's the greatest number you can miss and still pass. So the goal is to find the maximum number of wrong answers allowed without dropping below 80%.

Hmm, so if you miss some problems, you get them wrong. So the number of correct answers is 35 minus the number of missed ones. To pass, you need at least 80% of 35 correct answers.

Let me calculate 80% of 35. 80% is 0.8, so 0.8 * 35. Let me do that math. 35 times 0.8 is 28. So you need at least 28 correct answers to pass.

So the maximum number of problems you can miss is the total problems minus the minimum correct answers. That's 35 - 28 = 7.

Wait, let me double-check that. If you have 28 correct, then 35 - 28 = 7 missed. So yes, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option B is 7. So the answer should be B.

The maximum number of incorrect answers you can have and still pass is 7.

Answer: B
