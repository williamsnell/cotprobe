Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about deception in experiments. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. The question is asking what is essential for deception to be permissible in an experiment. The options are A through F. 

First, I need to remember the principles of research ethics, especially regarding deception. I think the key here is that deception needs to be informed consent. I remember hearing something about this before. Oh right, that's the principle of informed consent. It's a fundamental aspect to ensure that participants are aware and consenting to any changes they might undergo. 

Looking at the options, option A says participants have given informed consent. That sounds correct because without informed consent, participants aren't aware what's going on, so they can't be deceived. If they don't give informed consent, there's no basis for deception because the experiment is against their rights.

Option B says deception shouldn't involve withholding info about the purpose. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. I think the purpose of the experiment is a priority. If someone is withholding info about the purpose, it might be seen as biased or against the research's goals, which could be a problem. So maybe B isn't about deception but about the reason deception is used. Or perhaps B isn't the right condition for deception itself.

Option C talks about including a careful explanation within 3 years. I'm not sure about this. It seems like more about the experiment itself, ensuring it's not too long, but I don't recall that being a condition for deception. Maybe it's more about the experiment's duration, not about the deception itself.

Option D mentions the merits or value of the scientific investigation. That's about the significance of the research. If the investigation is good, maybe the deception isn't a big issue. I think this is more about the importance of the research and not necessarily a condition for deception.

Option E says deception involves providing false info about the purpose. That seems like exactly the kind of deception. If the deception is about changing the purpose, then E is correct. But wait, the question is about what is essential for deception to be permissible, so maybe other factors are involved.

Option F says deception is revealed at the end if they ask. I don't think that's a condition. I remember that sometimes participants can be reminded or told about deception at any time, not just the end. So F might not be a correct condition.

Putting it all together, the main condition for deception is informed consent because without it, participants can't be deceived. So the correct answer should be option A.

The correct answer is **A: the participants have given their informed consent to be deceived**.

**Explanation**: Informed consent is essential for deception in experiments because it ensures participants are fully aware and consenting to any changes, preventing potential ethical issues. Without informed consent, deception is not permissible as it could infringe on participants' rights.
