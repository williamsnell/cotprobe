D: The woman's counter offer terminated her power of acceptance.
E: The man's rejection of the woman's counter offer terminated the woman's power of acceptance.
F: Since the woman's purported acceptance was oral, it constituted a different mode of communication from the written offer.
G: The initial letter from the man was not a formal offer to sell.
H: The contract was unenforceable under the statute of frauds, because the woman's purported acceptance was oral.
I: The woman's initial refusal to pay the full price voided the contract.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The scenario is: A man sends a letter promising to sell a motorcycle for $1,000 to a woman. The letter is returned, and the woman sends an fax saying the price is a bit high at $800. The man responds by faxing he won't accept $800. The next day, the woman calls and says she's changing her mind and will pay $1,000. The man refuses to sell. The question is, what defense would the man use to claim breach of contract against the woman?

The options are A to H. I need to figure out which is the best defense for the man. Let's break down the facts.

First, the initial letter is a promise to sell. The man is offering $1,000. The woman receives a fax saying it's high at $800. The man doesn't accept that, so he faxes saying he won't take $800. Then the woman calls and changes her mind to pay full $1,000. 

The man refuses to sell. So the question is: what can the man do to claim he breached the contract?

Looking at the options:

A: The man had the right to change his mind. I think that's more about whether he can change the offer. But the question is about the defense. So if he can change the offer, then maybe he can say he didn't accept. But the man refused to accept $800, but the woman's new offer is $1k, so that's a new offer.

B: The woman didn't respond in time. Wait, the initial letter was a promise to sell, so it's a unilateral contract. The woman's response was an oral response on the day she changed her mind. But the initial letter was a written offer. So B might not apply because the response wasn't timely. However, in contract law, the time to respond usually applies to offers, but offers can be oral. If the initial offer is oral, then the woman's response would have been a timely oral response. So B may not be a valid defense.

C: The man's refusal was not written. He refused to accept $800. The initial letter was a promise, so it's a written offer. So he did communicate it in writing, but he refused. So C's defense is that he didn't communicate in writing, but that's not correct because the initial letter was written. So the man did communicate by refusing, so C might not be a strong defense.

D: The woman's counter offer terminated acceptance. Counter offers typically are part of a contract. If the woman had accepted the $800 (which she did), then maybe she can terminate acceptance. But wait, in this case, the woman changed her mind and now is offering $1,000, which is a new offer. So the initial offer was $800, and the new one is $1,000. They are two separate offers, but the man is refusing the new offer.

Wait, but in contract law, the initial promise is the offer. If the woman rejects and then offers a new price, that's a new offer. So the man's refusal to accept the new offer is a breach of contract. So D says the woman's counter offer terminated her power of acceptance. But actually, the woman's initial offer was accepted at $800, so she had acceptance. Then she offered $1,000 and refused, which would be a breach because she didn't accept it. So D's statement is incorrect because the counter offer didn't end her power of acceptance. So D is not a valid defense.

E: The man's rejection terminated the woman's acceptance. Hmm. The initial contract is the woman's acceptance at $800. The man's refusal to accept the new offer is a separate breach. So E is saying that the man's refusal ended the woman's acceptance. But in contract law, the woman accepts at $800, and then she offers $1,000. The man's refusal to take $800 is a breach because he didn't accept the new offer. So E's claim about termination is wrong. The man's refusal doesn't end her acceptance. So E isn't a defense.

F: Since the initial was oral, it's a different mode. So the initial offer was oral, the new one is written. Does that matter? Wait, the contract is oral or written? Because if the offer is oral, then the woman's acceptance is oral. But the initial letter is a promise, which is written. Hmm, but the question is about the defense. So option F says the initial was oral, so it's different from the written offer. But the initial offer was written (it's a promise). So the woman's acceptance was oral, but the offer was written. Does that make the acceptance different from the offer? Or does the mode of communication affect the contract's enforceability? I'm a bit fuzzy here. Option F's reasoning is that since the acceptance was oral, it's a different mode than the written offer. But in contract law, the person can accept either. So option F's reasoning is incorrect because the mode doesn't affect the contract enforceability, but whether it's a valid mode of communication. Wait, the question is about the defense. So F's reasoning that the initial was oral (so the woman's acceptance was oral) and thus different from the written offer. But the mode of communication is about whether the offer was in writing or not. So the initial letter was a written offer, but the woman's response (initial) was oral. So F says the initial was oral, so it's a different mode. But the initial was written. So F's reasoning is incorrect. So F is not a correct defense.

G: The initial letter was not formal. The initial letter is a promise to sell, which is a formal contract. So G is incorrect because the initial letter was formal.

H: The contract wasn't enforceable because the woman's acceptance was oral. Wait, the initial offer was a promise, which is a contract. The woman's acceptance in the initial letter was oral, but in a contract, the acceptances must be in writing. So the woman's initial acceptance was oral, which is not a valid acceptance. So the contract can't be enforced because the original offer was formal (written), and the acceptance was oral. So the initial letter was a promise (accepted), but the woman's response was oral. So the contract can't be enforced because the acceptance was oral. So H's reasoning is correct. So the contract is unenforceable because the initial acceptance was oral. So the man can't enforce the contract, so his defense would be that the contract is unenforceable.

I: The woman's refusal voided the contract. Wait, no, because the initial offer was accepted. So the contract is enforceable. So I is incorrect.

So looking back, the options. The question is which is the best defense for the man.

The correct option is H. Because the initial agreement was a promise (formal offer), and the woman's acceptance was oral, so she didn't accept it. So the contract can't be enforced because the acceptance was not in writing. So the initial letter was a promise (formal offer), but the acceptance was oral. So H's reasoning is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The contract law says that either acceptance or rejection must be in writing. In this case, the woman's initial response was oral, so she didn't accept the offer. So the contract can't be enforced because the initial acceptance wasn't in writing. So the man can't enforce the contract, so his defense is that the contract was unenforceable because the acceptance was oral.

So the answer should be H.
</think>

The man's defense hinges on the enforceability of the contract. The woman initially accepted the offer in an oral manner, which violates the requirement for acceptance to be in writing under contract law. Therefore, the contract cannot be enforced, and the man's best defense is that the contract was unenforceable due to the oral acceptance of the initial offer.

Answer: H
