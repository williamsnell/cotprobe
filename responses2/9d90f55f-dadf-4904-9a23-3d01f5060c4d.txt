Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to calculate the net price of a Speedway Racing Set after applying two successive discounts of 10% and 20%. The set is priced at $32. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that discounts reduce the original price. So, applying a 10% discount first would lower the price, and then applying a 20% discount on the new, lower price. I should handle each discount separately.

Let me start with the 10% discount. The original price is $32. A 10% discount means I'm paying 90% of the original price because 100% minus 10% is 90%. So, I'll calculate 90% of $32. 

To find 90% of 32, I can multiply 32 by 0.9. Let me do that: 32 * 0.9 equals... let's see, 32 * 0.9. 30*0.9 is 27, and 2*0.9 is 1.8. Adding those gives 28.8. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, 32 times 0.9 should be 28.8? Hmm, that seems correct. So after the first discount, the price is $28.80.

Now, applying the second discount of 20% to this new price. So I need to find 20% of $28.80 and subtract that from $28.80. Alternatively, I can think of it as paying 80% of the current price because 100% minus 20% is 80%. So, 80% of $28.80 is what? Let me calculate that. 

To find 80% of 28.80, I can multiply 28.80 by 0.8. Let me do that: 28.8 * 0.8. Let's break it down. 28 * 0.8 is 22.4, and 0.8 * 0.8 is 0.64. Wait, no. Wait, 28.8 is 28 plus 0.8. So, 28 *0.8 is 22.4, and 0.8 * 0.8 is 0.64. So adding 22.4 and 0.64 gives 23.04. Oh wait, that can't be right because 28.8 *0.8 is actually 23.04. Wait, I thought 28.8 * 0.8 is 23.04. So, that's the new price after the second discount.

Wait, but let me double-check. 28.80 * 0.8. Let me compute it step by step. 28.80 divided by 10 is 2.88. Multiply by 8: 2.88 * 8. 2*8=16, 0.88*8=7.04. So 16 +7.04=23.04. Yes, that's correct. So the final price after both discounts is $23.04.

Looking at the options, option I is $23.04. So that's the net price.

The net price after applying a 10% discount followed by a 20% discount to a $32 set is $23.04.

Answer: I: $23.04
