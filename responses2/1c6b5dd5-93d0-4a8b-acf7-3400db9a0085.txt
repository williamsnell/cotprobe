Okay, so I have this question about carbon-12 and its atomic weight. The question says the atomic weight of carbon 12 is exactly 12 amu, and I need to find the mass of a single carbon-12 atom. The options are all in the form of grams per atom, varying in the exponent range. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these units, but let's think through this.

First, I remember that the atomic weight is the mass of one mole of atoms. So, carbon-12 has an atomic weight of 12 amu, which means 1 mole of carbon-12 atoms weighs 12 grams. Oh wait, right! So one mole is 6.022e23 atoms (that's Avogadro's number), but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait again. Oh, wait no, Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 per mole. So one mole is 12 grams. So each atom would be 12 grams divided by Avogadro's number.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The atomic weight in grams per mole is 12. So for one mole, that's 12 grams. So each atom is 12 grams / (6.022e23 atoms/mol). Let's compute that.

So 12 grams / (6.022e23) = approximately 1.992e-23 grams per atom. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 1.2e-23, D is 3e-23, so 2e-23 isn't there. Oh wait, wait. Oh no, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Oh! Wait, wait. Wait a second, I think I got confused between atomic mass units (amu) and grams. Oh, because 1 mole of carbon-12 is 12 grams. So 1 mole is 6.022e23 atoms. So 12 g is 6.022e23 atoms. So each atom is 12/(6.022e23) grams.

Let me calculate that. 12 divided by 6.022e23. 6.022e23 is about 6e23. So 12 /6e23 is 2e22, wait no, wait. 12 /6e23 = 2e23? No, wait, wait: 12 divided by 6 is 2, so 12/(6e23) is (2e23) * (1/10) ? No, wait, let's do it properly.

Wait, 6.022e23 is the Avogadro number. So 12 amu (which is 12 g/mol) divided by 6.022e23 atoms/mol gives the mass per atom. So 12 / 6.022e23.

Calculating that: 12 / (6.022e23) = (12 /6.022) * 1e-23.

12 divided by 6.022 is approximately 1.993, so about 2.0e-23. So 2.0 × 10^-23 grams per atom.

Wait, but looking back, the options are from A to J. Option G is 3.5e-23, B is 1.2e-23, etc. So option G is 3.5e-23, which is higher than what I calculated.

Wait, but wait a minute. Oh! Wait, I think I made a mistake in the units. Because I remember that 1 mole is 12 grams. So 12g/mol is the molar mass. So per atom, it's 12g per 6.022e23 atoms. So for one atom, mass is 12/(6.022e23) = approximately 1.992e-23 grams.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, people use a different approach for conversion. Wait, is the atomic mass in grams equal to the mass of one mole? Oh, wait, the atomic mass unit (amu) is approximately 1/16th of a gram (since a carbon-12 atom is roughly 12 times that of a hydrogen atom, which is about 1 amu). So 1 amu ≈ 1.66e-24 grams.

So for carbon-12, 12 amu is 12 * 1.66e-24 g.

Wait, so 12 * 1.66e-24 = 1.992e-23 grams.

Which brings us back to the same calculation. So the mass per atom is approximately 2.0e-23 grams.

Looking at the options again:

A: 1.5e-23

B: 1.2e-23

C: 2.0e-23

D:3e-23

E:2.7e-23

F:2.2e-23

G:3.5e-23

H:1.8e-23

I:2.5e-23

J:1e-23

So option C is 2.0e-23. So the answer should be C.

To determine the mass of a single carbon-12 atom, we start with the given atomic weight of carbon-12, which is 12 atomic mass units (amu). The atomic mass unit (amu) is approximately \( 1.66 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{g} \). Since the atomic weight in grams per mole is 12, this corresponds to 12 moles of carbon-12 atoms. 

Using Avogadro's number, \( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol} \), the mass of a single carbon-12 atom can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Mass per atom} = \frac{\text{Mass per mole}}{\text{Avogadro's number}} = \frac{12 \, \text{g/mol}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol}}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\text{Mass per atom} \approx \frac{12}{6.022 \times 10^{23}} \approx 1.993 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{g/atom}
\]

This value is approximately \( 2.0 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{g/atom} \). Among the given options, the closest match is:

- **C: \( 2.0 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{g/atom} \)**

Thus, the correct answer is:
