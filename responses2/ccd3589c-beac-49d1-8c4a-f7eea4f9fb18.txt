Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is asking about the measure of an angle that's equivalent to 1/360 of a circle. Hmm, I remember that a full circle is 360 degrees. So if I divide that into 360 equal parts, each part would be 1 degree. That makes sense because a full circle is 360 degrees, so each 1/360 of that would be a single degree. 

Wait, let me think again. If I take a full circle, which is 360 degrees, and split it into 360 equal angles, each would measure 1 degree. So each 1/360th of the circle is 1 degree. So the angle we're looking for is 1 degree. Looking at the options, option H is 1. So that should be the answer.

Another way to think about it is that 360 divided by 360 is 1, so 360/360 is 1. So yeah, that's definitely 1 degree. I don't think any of the other options fit. For example, 720 would be a full circle, 360 is another full circle, 30 is much smaller. 180 is half a circle, 90 is a right angle, 60 is a sixth of a circle. 270 is three-quarters, and 45 is a significant part but not 1/360.

The measure of an angle that is 1/360 of a circle is 1 degree. 

Answer: H: 1
