Okay, so I've got this question about thermonuclear explosions and the temperature of the fireball. The question is asking me to find the correct value of lambda_max corresponding to a temperature of 10^7 K. Hmm, I remember that lambda_max is related to the peak wavelength of the emitted radiation, which is described by Wien's law.

Wien's law says that the peak wavelength (lambda_max) is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature (T). The formula I remember is lambda_max = b / T, where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant. Oh wait, right, the value of b is 2.8977719 × 10^-3 m·K. So, I can plug in the numbers here.

The temperature given is 10^7 K. Let's compute lambda_max. So, lambda_max equals 2.8977719e-3 divided by 1e7. Let me do that calculation: 2.8977719e-3 / 1e7 equals approximately 2.8977719e-10 meters. Wait, wait, let me check the exponents. 1e7 is 10^7, so 2.89777e-3 / 1e7 = 2.89777e-3 / 10^7 = 2.89777e-10 meters. 

Looking at the options, let's see what's available. Option A is 2e-10 m, which is 2 x 1e-10. Option B is 1e-10, which is 1e-10. Option C is 7e-10, which is bigger than I calculated. Option D is 6e-10, even bigger. So I don't think any of the larger options match.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake. 10^7 is 10 million. So 2.89777e-3 divided by 1e7. Let me write that as 2.89777719e-3 / 1e7. 2.89777719e-3 is 0.000000289777719 meters. Divided by 10^7 (which is 10 million) is 0.0000000000289777719 meters.

Wait, 1e-7 is 0.0000001 meters. So 2.89777e-3 is about 0.002897777 meters. Divided by 10^7 (which is 10,000,000) would be 0.002897777 / 10,000,000 = 0.0000002897777 meters. Oh wait, that's 2.897777e-7 meters. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, let's see: 1 meter is 1e3 mm, 1e6 micrometers, 1e9 nanometers. So 1e-3 meters is 1 millimeter. So 2.89777e-3 is 0.002897777 meters. Divided by 1e7 (10 million) is 0.002897777 / 10,000,000. Let me compute that as 2.897777e-3 divided by 1e7 is (2.897777e-3)/(1e7) = 2.897777e-3 / 1e7 = (2.897777 / 1e7) * 1e-3. Wait, no, I think I'm complicating it.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 2.89777e-3 / 1e7. So 2.89777e-3 is 0.000000289777 m. Divide that by 1e7 (10,000,000) gives 0.000000289777 / 1e7 = 0.0000000000289777, which is 2.89777e-10 meters. Oh wait, no—wait, 1e7 is 10 million. So, 0.000000289777 divided by 10 million is 0.0000000000289777, which is 2.89777e-10 meters.

Looking at the options, option A is 2e-10 m, which is 0.0000000002 meters. Option B is 1e-10 m, which is 0.0000000001 m. So my calculation gives 2.89777e-10 m, which is approximately 2.9e-10 m. Looking at the options, the closest is A, which is 2e-10 m. But wait, wait—am I making a mistake here? Because 1e7 K is a very high temperature. High temperature objects emit more in the UV or X-rays. So, the peak is in the UV. Let me think about what the options are.

Wait, the options are:

A: 2e-10 m (2 x 1e-10 m)
B: 1e-10 m
C: 7e-10 m
D: 6e-10 m
E: 5e-10 m
F: 0.5e-10 m (same as 5e-11 m)
G: 8e-10 m
H: 3e-10 m
I: 5e-10 m? Wait no, option I is 5e-10 m but in the list, I see that G is 8e-10, H is 3e-10, I is 5e-10. Oh wait, looking back, the options are:

A: 2e-10 m

B: 1e-10 m

C:7e-10 m

D:6e-10 m

E:5e-10 m

F:0.5e-10 m (which is 5e-11 m)

G:8e-10 m

H:3e-10 m

I:5e-10 m

J:2.5e-10 m.

Ah, so option I is 5e-10 m. Wait, but my calculation gives about 2.89777e-10 m, which is about 2.9e-10 m. Looking at the options, option A is 2e-10 m, which is 2.0e-10. So, that's the closest to the calculated value. But wait, 2.9e-10 is closer to 3e-10 than to 2e-10? No, wait, 2.9 is closer to 3.0 than to 2.0. So 2.9e-10 would be 29e-11 m, which is a little over 3e-10. But the options don't have 3e-10. Wait, looking back at the options, option H is 3e-10 m. So, I have 2.9e-10, which is approximately 2.9, so that's about 3e-10. So option H is 3e-10 m. But wait, the calculated value is about 2.9e-10, which is 2.9 x 1e-10. So, which option is the closest? The options are in 1e-10 increments.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 2.89777e-3 divided by 1e7.

Wait, 2.89777e-3 is 0.00289777 m. Divided by 1e7 (10,000,000) gives 0.00289777 / 1e7 = 0.0000000289777 m. Which is 2.89777e-8 meters? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1e7 is 10^7, so 0.00289777 divided by 1e7 is 0.00289777 / 10,000,000. Let's compute:

0.00289777 divided by 10 million. 10 million is 1e7. So 0.00289777 / 10^7 = 2.89777e-3 / 1e7 = 2.89777e-10. Yes, so 2.89777e-10 meters.

Looking at the options again: the options are:

A) 2e-10 m

B) 1e-10 m

C)7e-10 m

D)6e-10 m

E)5e-10 m

F)0.5e-10 m (which is 5e-11 m)

G)8e-10 m

H)3e-10 m

I)5e-10 m

J)2.5e-10 m.

So the correct value is approximately 2.89777e-10 m. Which option is closest? The options are in 1e-10 increments.

Option A is 2e-10, which is 0.0000000002 m.

Option H is 3e-10 m, which is 0.0000000003 m.

So 2.89777e-10 is closer to 3e-10 than to 2e-10. Because 2.89777 is about 2.9, which is 0.1 away from 3.0. 0.1 is a tenth of a unit. The distance from 2.89777 to 2 is 0.89777, which is about 0.9 units. So 3 is closer. So our calculated value is about 2.9e-10 m, which is closer to 3e-10 than 2e-10.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me think again. Let's compute the absolute differences.

The options are in 1e-10 m.

So:

2.89777e-10 m is 2.89777 x 1e-10.

Which is about 2.9 x 1e-10.

So, the options are:

A:2 x 1e-10 → difference is 0.9e-10.

H:3 x 1e-10 → difference is 0.1e-10.

So 3 is closer.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, the correct option is H:3e-10 m, but wait, no, wait, the calculation is 2.89777e-10, which is approximately 3e-10. So the correct option would be H. But wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Because 1e7 is 10^7. So 2.89777e-3 is 0.00289777 m.

Divided by 1e7 is 0.00289777 / 1e7 = 0.0000000289777 meters. Which is 2.89777e-8 meters? Wait, no, 0.00289777 / 1e7 is 2.89777e-3 / 1e7 = 2.89777e-10.

Ah, right, so 2.89777e-10 meters.

So the correct answer should be approximately 3e-10 m, which is option H. But wait, the options list H as 3e-10 m. So the correct option is H.

Wait, but wait a moment. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me reevaluate. Because 10^7 is a high temperature, so the peak should be in the UV. Let me think about typical thermal emission.

The peak wavelength for a blackbody is lambda_max = b / T. For a typical star like a red giant, which is hotter than the Sun, the peak would be in the UV. Let me recall: if the Sun's temperature is about 5800 K, its peak is around 0.01 meters (10 cm) (because T=5800, so lambda_max is ~1.09e-6 m, which is around 100 nm).

A temperature of 1e7 K is 10 million K. Let's compute lambda_max for 1e7 K.

Using Wien's law: lambda_max = 2.8977719e-3 m·K / 1e7 K = 2.8977719e-3 / 1e7 = 2.8977719e-10 m. So, 2.89777e-10 m is approximately 2.9e-10 m. So, looking at the options, the closest is 3e-10, which is option H. So the correct answer should be H.
</think>

To determine the value of \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \) corresponding to a temperature of \( 10^7 \, \mathrm{K} \), we use Wien's displacement law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T},
\]

where \( b = 2.8977719 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{m \cdot K} \) is Wien's displacement constant, and \( T = 10^7 \, \mathrm{K} \) is the temperature of the fireball.

### Calculation:
\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2.8977719 \times 10^{-3}}{10^7} = 2.8977719 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}.
\]

This value is approximately \( 2.9 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \).

### Comparison with Options:
The options provided are:

- **A: \( 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \)**
- **B: \( 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \)**
- **C: \( 7 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \)**
- **D: \( 6 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \)**
- **E: \( 5 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \)**
- **F: \( 0.5 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \)**
- **G: \( 8 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \)**
- **H: \( 3 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \)**
- **I: \( 5 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \)**
- **J: \( 2.5 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \)**

The calculated value of \( 2.9 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \) is closest to \( 3 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \), which corresponds to option **H**.

### Conclusion:
The correct value of \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \) for a temperature of \( 10^7 \, \mathrm{K} \) is approximately \( 3 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \).
