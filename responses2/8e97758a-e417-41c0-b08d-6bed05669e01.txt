Question:

What properties of water make it an essential component of living matter?

Options:

A: Water is abundant, a good solvent, regulates heat, serves as a lubricant, aids in transport of nutrients, and maintains osmotic relationships.
B: Water is detrimental to the regulation of heat in the body.
C: Water is a poor solvent, making it unsuitable for chemical reactions in cells.
D: Water provides no thermal insulation and cannot dissolve gases.
E: Water is not involved in maintaining structural integrity of biological molecules.
F: Water is only involved in the transport of nutrients, but has no role in heat regulation or as a solvent.
G: Water is scarce and difficult to dissolve substances in.
H: Water's high surface tension is detrimental to the movement of substances in living organisms.
I: Water has a low heat capacity, which makes it ineffective in temperature regulation.
J: Water serves no functional purpose in living organisms.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about the properties of water that make it essential for living organisms. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that water is a fundamental component of life. But what exactly makes it so important? The question gives a list of options, so I need to go through each one.

Option A says water is abundant, a good solvent, regulates heat, serves as a lubricant, aids in transport of nutrients, and maintains osmotic relationships. Hmm. I know water is abundant and it's a good solvent because it can dissolve most substances. It does regulate heat as it's the only liquid that can manage temperature changes. It's used as a lubricant because it's slippery, and it transports nutrients because it's absorbed by tissues. Osmotic relationships—yes, because water helps regulate the movement of substances across cell membranes. So A seems like a strong contender.

Option B claims water is detrimental to heat regulation. That doesn't sound right. I thought water's role in regulating temperature is crucial, especially in the body. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C says water is a poor solvent. No, that's the opposite. I remember water is a great solvent because it can dissolve many things.

Option D says water doesn't provide thermal insulation. No, water does insulate well. The body uses it for heat regulation. So D is wrong.

Option E says water isn't part of maintaining structural integrity. No, water helps in holding together biological molecules, especially in cells. So E is incorrect.

Option F states water is only involved in nutrient transport but not heat regulation or as a solvent. I don't think that's accurate. Water does all those things—like regulating heat, transporting nutrients, and acting as a solvent and a transporter. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: Water is scarce and difficult to dissolve. No, the opposite. Water is abundant and good at dissolving things.

Option H: Water has high surface tension, which is bad for movement. Wait, high surface tension can make things move more easily. For example, water's surface tension allows water to move in the blood, aiding in diffusion. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Water has low heat capacity. No, water does have a high heat capacity, which is why it can store a lot of heat. But I'm not sure about the effectiveness in regulating temperature. Wait, the body uses water to regulate temperature. I think I remember that water's high heat capacity makes it effective in this role. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here. Because if it has a high capacity, it can store heat, but can it regulate it? Or maybe it's the opposite—water's high heat capacity makes it good for cooling things down, so it's not detrimental. So option I might be wrong.

Option J: Water serves no functional purpose. No, I know it's essential. So J is wrong.

So looking back, the options that seem correct are A and maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again about option I. If water has low heat capacity, it's hard to regulate temperature. But I'm not sure about that. Wait, water does regulate temperature. For example, the body's temperature is kept within a narrow range by the circulatory system, which uses water. So perhaps option I is incorrect then.

Wait, what about option H: high surface tension is detrimental. No, because high surface tension allows things to move. Like, in the example, water's surface tension allows it to flow through blood vessels, facilitating diffusion. So H is wrong.

So the only correct answer is A. Wait, but let me think again. Let me go through each option one more time.

A: All the points I thought are correct. Water is abundant, a solvent, regulates heat, is a lubricant, transports nutrients, maintains osmotic relationships. So A is correct.

Other options: Let me check. F says water is only for transport of nutrients and no heat. But water does regulate heat. So F is wrong.

I think A is the correct answer.

The correct answer is A: Water is abundant, a good solvent, regulates heat, serves as a lubricant, aids in transport of nutrients, and maintains osmotic relationships. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Question:** The question asks which properties of water make it essential for living organisms. Each option is evaluated for accuracy based on known biological functions of water.

2. **Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A:** This option correctly identifies several key properties of water, including abundance, solubility, role in heat regulation, lubrication, nutrient transport, and osmotic function. These properties are all essential for life.
   - **Option B:** Incorrect, as water is indeed critical for heat regulation.
   - **Option C:** Incorrect, as water is a great solvent.
   - **Option D:** Incorrect, as water insulates well.
   - **Option E:** Incorrect, as water maintains structural integrity.
   - **Option F:** Incorrect, as water is involved in all these functions.
   - **Option G:** Incorrect, as water is abundant and effective.
   - **Option H:** Incorrect, as high surface tension is beneficial, not detrimental.
   - **Option I:** Incorrect, as water's high heat capacity aids in temperature regulation, not hinders it.
