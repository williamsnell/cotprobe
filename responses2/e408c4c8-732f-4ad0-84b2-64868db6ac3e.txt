Question:

Use indirect truth tables to determine whether the following argument is valid. If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample. (There may be other counterexamples as well.)

N ⊃ ~M
N ∨ K / L ⊃ K

Options:

A: Valid
B: Invalid. Counterexample when L, M, and N are true and K is false
C: Invalid. Counterexample when L and M are true and K and N are false
D: Invalid. Counterexample when L and N are true and K and M are false

Okay, so I have this logic problem here. I need to determine whether an argument is valid using an indirect truth table. Hmm, indirect truth tables are a bit tricky for me, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The argument given is:

1. (K · L) ⊃ M
2. N ⊃ ~M
3. N ∨ K
/ Conclusion: L ⊃ K

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure. Let me parse it properly. So the premises are three, and the conclusion is the fourth line. I need to check if the premises logically lead to the conclusion. If they don't, then the argument is invalid, and I need to find a counterexample.

I remember that indirect truth tables involve assuming the negation of the conclusion and seeing if it leads to a contradiction. So, the conclusion is L ⊃ K, which is equivalent to saying ~L ∨ K. So, the negation would be ~ (L ∨ K), which is equivalent to ~L ∧ ~K. But wait, in indirect truth tables, I assume the negation of the conclusion and then see if that leads to a contradiction with the premises. Alternatively, sometimes people use the method of assuming the premises are true and the conclusion is false, then checking for a contradiction.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by trying to assume that the conclusion is false, and then see if the premises can be true at the same time. If I can find a scenario where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid.

Let me structure the indirect truth table. So, I'll assume that the conclusion L ⊃ K is false. That means ~ (L ⊃ K) is true, which is equivalent to ~ (L ⊃ K) which is ~ (L → K) which is equivalent to L ∧ ~K. So in this case, L is true and K is false. But wait, that's only part of the scenario. I also need to make sure that the premises are true in this scenario.

So, the premises are:

1. (K ∧ L) → M → which is equivalent to (K ∧ L) ⊃ M, which in logic means if (K and L) then M. So, in other words, if both K and L are true, then M must be true.

2. N → ~M → If N is true, then M is false.

3. N ∨ K → Either N is true, or K is true.

So, in the scenario I'm considering for the indirect proof, L is true, K is false, and I need to see what M and N are.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. If I'm assuming that the conclusion is false (so L ⊃ K is false), that means L is true and K is false. So in this case, L is true and K is false.

Now, I need to see what the premises say. Let's look at each premise under these assumptions.

1. (K ∧ L) → M. So, since K is false and L is true, (K ∧ L) is false, right? Because K is false. So, the antecedent is false. In logic, a false antecedent makes the implication true, regardless of the consequent. So, this premise is automatically true.

2. N → ~M. So, in this scenario, N is ? Well, I don't know yet. But since the premise says that if N is true, then M is false. But in my current scenario, I'm considering that K is false, which doesn't directly affect this premise, unless N is involved.

3. N ∨ K. Since K is false, for this to be true, N must be true. Because OR requires at least one to be true. So, N must be true.

So, under the assumption that L is true and K is false, we have:

- Premise 1: automatically true.
- Premise 2: N → ~M. So, if N is true, then M must be false.
- Premise 3: N must be true.

So, let's see. Premise 3 requires N to be true. Let's look at premise 2. If N is true, then M must be false. So, in this scenario, M is false.

Now, let's see if this leads to any contradictions. Let's see the other premises.

Wait, but what about the first premise? It's (K ∧ L) → M. Since K is false, (K ∧ L) is false, so the implication is true. So no problem there.

Now, in this scenario, we have L=true, K=false, M=false, N=true.

Wait, but let's check whether this scenario satisfies all premises.

- Premise 1: (K ∧ L) → M. K is false, so (K ∧ L) is false. So, the implication is true. So premise 1 holds.
- Premise 2: N → ~M. N is true, M is false. So, since N is true and M is false, ~M is true, so the implication is true. So premise 2 holds.
- Premise 3: N ∨ K. N is true, so this is true. So premise 3 holds.

So, in this scenario, all three premises are true, and the conclusion (L ⊃ K) is false. Because L is true and K is false, so L ⊃ K is false. So, in this scenario, all premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is invalid.

So, the argument is invalid. Now, looking at the options, I need to find which option presents a counterexample. The options are:

A: Valid
B: Invalid. Counterexample when L, M, and N are true and K is false
C: Invalid. Counterexample when L and M are true and K and N are false
D: Invalid. Counterexample when L and N are true and K and M are false

Wait, let me look again. The scenario I created was L=true, K=false, M=false, N=true.

Wait, wait, in my scenario, L is true, K is false, M is false, and N is true.

So, the counterexample would be when L, N are true, and K is false (since in my scenario K is false). Wait, no. Let me read the options again.

Option B: Counterexample when L, M, and N are true and K is false. So, in this scenario, L=true, M=true, N=true, K=false.

Option D: Counterexample when L and N are true and K and M are false. So L=true, N=true, K=false, M=false.

In my scenario, I have L=true, N=true, K=false, M=false. So that's option D. So the argument is invalid, and a counterexample is when L and N are true, and K and M are false.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in my own scenario, K is false, M is false, N is true, L is true. So that would fit option D. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option D says: counterexample when L and N are true and K and M are false. That's exactly what I have in my scenario. So the argument is invalid because in this scenario, all the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. So the answer should be D: Invalid. Counterexample when L and N are true and K and M are false.

The argument is invalid, as a counterexample exists when L and N are true, and K and M are false.

Answer: D
