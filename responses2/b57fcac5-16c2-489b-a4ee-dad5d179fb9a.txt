Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about logic propositions and their implications. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

The problem gives me some premises and asks which of the options is a direct consequence of them. The premises are:

1. A → (B ∧ C) [Which is written as A ⊃ (B • C)]
2. ~(B ∧ C) [Which is written as ~(B • C)]
3. A ∨ (D ∨ B) [Written as A ∨ (D ∨ B)]

And the options are from A to J, each with a different proposition. The question is asking which of these is an immediate consequence, meaning it's a consequence that can be derived in one step from the premises.

Wait, let's think about the premises. Premise 1 is A implies B and C together. Premise 2 negates that, so it's saying that B and C cannot both be true at the same time. So, from these two, we know that A implies that B and C are not both true. That's a contradiction if A is true, because if A is true, then B and C must both be true, which contradicts premise 2. So, if A is true, then we have a contradiction, meaning that A must be false. Because if A is true, it leads to a contradiction. So, A must be false.

So, from premise 1 and 2, we can conclude that A is false. Because if A were true, then B ∧ C would have to be true, which would make premise 2 false. But premise 2 is given as false, so A must be false. That's a logical implication. So, A ⊢ ~A? Wait, no, the premises lead us to conclude ~A. Because if A is true, it leads to a contradiction, so A must be false.

So, from the premises, we can derive that A is false. So, ~A is a consequence.

Looking at the options, option J is ~(A ∨ D). Let's see if that follows from the premises.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the premises in another way. Let me re-examine the premises.

Another approach: Since A implies (B and C), and also that B and C are not both true. So, A → (B ∧ C) and ~ (B ∧ C). So, A → (B ∧ C) is equivalent to (A → B) ∧ (A → C). And the second premise is that B ∧ C is false.

So, can we derive that A is false? Because if A is true, then both B and C must be true, which would make B ∧ C true, contradicting premise 2. So, A must be false. So, from the premises, A is false. So, ~A is an immediate consequence.

Looking at the options, option J is ~(A ∨ D). Let's see if that's a consequence.

Wait, if A is false, then A ∨ D is equivalent to D, because A is false. So, the disjunction A ∨ D is equivalent to D. So, ~(A ∨ D) is equivalent to ~D. So, if A is false, then A ∨ D is D, so the negation is ~D. So, from the premises, can we derive that?

Wait, no. Because if A is false, then A ∨ D is D, but we don't have any information about D. So, we can't derive ~D. Because D could be true or false. So, maybe option J is not correct.

Wait, let's think again. The premises lead us to conclude A is false. So, from A being false, we can't directly get that A ∨ D is true or false. Because A is false, and D could be anything. So, the only way to get a consequence is to look for something that must be true if A is false.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's think about all the premises together.

Premise 1: A → (B ∧ C)
Premise 2: ~(B ∧ C)
So, from 1 and 2, we can derive that A → (B ∧ C) is true, and (B ∧ C) is false. Therefore, A must be false. So, ~A is a consequence.

So, looking at the options, option J is ~(A ∨ D). Let's see if that's true. If A is false, then A ∨ D is D. So, ~ (A ∨ D) is ~D. So, can we derive ~D from the premises?

The premises don't give us any information about D. So, D could be true or false. So, we can't derive ~D. So, option J is not correct.

Alternatively, looking at option G: B. Wait, are we able to conclude B?

Well, from premise 1, A → (B ∧ C). If A is false, then A → (B ∧ C) is vacuously true. But this doesn't give us any information about B. So, B could be true or false, but we don't have any premises that would force it. So, G is not a consequence.

Similarly, option H: B ∧ C. But premise 2 says ~(B ∧ C), so H can't be true.

Option A is the same as H, so A is not valid.

Option B: D ∨ B. Hmm. We can't derive D ∨ B from the premises. Because if A is false, D ∨ B could be either true or false. So, that's not a consequence.

Option C: ~A. Ah, this is exactly what we derived. Because from premises, A must be false. So, ~A is the immediate consequence. So, the correct answer is option J? Wait, no. Wait, option J is ~(A ∨ D), which is equivalent to ~D. Because A ∨ D is D when A is false. So, ~(A ∨ D) is ~D. So, can we derive ~D from the premises?

No, I don't think so. Because from the premises, we only know that A is false. So, A ∨ D is D, but D could be anything. So, we can't derive ~D. So, option J is not correct.

Wait, but I thought we derived that ~A is a consequence. So, looking at the options, none of the options have ~A, except perhaps option J is about ~D. Wait, no, because J is ~D.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's re-examine the premises.

Alternative approach: Let's look at the premises and use logical equivalences to see what can be concluded.

We have:

1. A → (B ∧ C) [which is equivalent to (A → B) ∧ (A → C)]
2. ~(B ∧ C) [which is equivalent to ~B ∨ ~C]

From 1 and 2, we can derive that A → (B ∧ C) is true, and B ∧ C is false. Therefore, A → (B ∧ C) is a true statement, but since (B ∧ C) is false, what does that say about A?

Wait, if A → (B ∧ C) is true, and (B ∧ C) is false, then A must be false. Because if A were true, then (B ∧ C) must be true, which contradicts premise 2. So, A must be false. So, ~A is a consequence.

Looking at the answer options, option J is ~D. So, can we derive that from the premises?

Hmm. Let's see. If A is false, can we know anything about D?

Well, the premises don't give us any information about D. So, D could be true or false. So, we can't derive D, so we can't derive ~D, which is the same as ~ (A ∨ D) (since A is false, A ∨ D is D). So, option J is not correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because the premises include A ∨ (D ∨ B). So, perhaps from that we can derive something.

Wait, let's consider the premises:

Premise 1: A → (B ∧ C)
Premise 2: ~ (B ∧ C)
Premise 3: A ∨ (D ∨ B)

Let me try to derive something from these.

From 1 and 2, as before, we get A must be false.

Now, looking at premise 3: A ∨ (D ∨ B). Since A is false, this simplifies to D ∨ B. So, premise 3 tells us that either D or B is true.

But wait, that's a different direction. Let me think: Because from the premises, we can derive A is false, and also that in premise 3, since A is false, D ∨ B is true. So, D ∨ B is a consequence of the premises.

But none of the options are D ∨ B, except perhaps option B, which is D ∨ B. So, the consequence is D ∨ B.

Wait, but the options are about the direct consequence. So, if we can derive D ∨ B, then that's a consequence. But looking at the options, option B is D ∨ B. So, is that a consequence?

Wait, but let's see: the premises lead us to A being false. So, the premise 3 is A ∨ (D ∨ B), which becomes (False) ∨ (D ∨ B) → D ∨ B. So, yes, D ∨ B is a consequence. So, option B is D ∨ B.

But wait, the question is about which of the following propositions is an immediate consequence in PL of the given premises. So, the correct answer would be option B, which is D ∨ B.

Wait, but earlier I thought that ~A was a consequence, which isn't in the options except indirectly. So, the correct option would be B, D ∨ B.

Wait, but let me re-examine the options. The options are A: ~(B • C), B: D ∨ B, etc.

So, the correct answer would be B, D ∨ B. Because from the premises, we derived that A is false, and therefore D ∨ B is a consequence.

Alternatively, perhaps another path: what if I don't think in terms of A being false, but instead use the premises directly.

Let me try to derive D ∨ B.

Wait, from premise 3: A ∨ (D ∨ B). But we know A is false, so this simplifies to D ∨ B. So, that's a direct consequence. So, we can derive D ∨ B as a consequence of the premises. So, option B is D ∨ B.

So, the correct answer is option B. So, the immediate consequence is D ∨ B, which is option B.
</think>

The premises lead us to conclude that A must be false because if A were true, B and C would both be true, contradicting the second premise. From this, we can derive that A ∨ (D ∨ B) simplifies to D ∨ B since A is false. Therefore, the immediate consequence is D ∨ B, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
