Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about arthropods and how they move. Let's see... The question is asking about the mechanism of movement using the exoskeleton.

Hmm, first, I remember that arthropods include insects, spiders, crustaceans, etc. They have exoskeletons, which are structures outside the body. But how do they move? I think they don't use legs or wings, which are common in other animals. So looking at the options, A says they use wings, but I don't think arthropods have wings. They might have a flexible structure instead.

Option B says they change the shape of their exoskeleton. That doesn't sound right. Exoskeletons are rigid structures, so changing shape might not be how they move. Also, movement would need some kind of action, not just shape changes.

Option C suggests using cilia on the exoskeleton. Cilia are tiny hair-like structures, so if they're on the exoskeleton, that would add movement. But I'm not sure if that's how it's done in arthropods. I think some insects have cilia, but I'm not certain about all arthropods.

Option D says they move through their muscular system. That's a possibility. Some animals, like insects, have muscles that allow them to move. But I don't think that's the primary way arthropods move. They don't have separate legs or muscles like mammals do.

Option E talks about a soft, pliable inner layer that bends for movement. That rings a bell. I think some arthropods have a soft, flexible structure called a pseudopod on their exoskeleton. These pseudopods can bend, providing movement. So E might be a correct answer.

Option F says movement is through hydraulic pressure changes. That's more like what some animals have, like birds, but I don't think that's the main mechanism for arthropods. They don't use that for movement, so F probably isn't right.

Option G mentions a special fluid lubricating the joints. I'm not sure about that. I think some animals have a fluid, like in insects, but I don't remember if that's the main mechanism for exoskeleton movement.

Option H says exoskeleton contracts and expands. That makes sense because if the exoskeleton can change shape, it can push or pull the body parts apart, allowing movement. So H is a possibility.

Option I suggests exoskeleton splits and reforms. That's similar to option H, but I'm not sure which is more accurate. Splitting might not always happen every time, especially for more complex movements.

Option J says they have a segmented body with flexible chitin. Some insects have segments and chitin, but I'm not certain if that's the primary method for movement. The exoskeleton might not always be segmented that way, though.

So, putting it together: movement in arthropods likely involves their exoskeleton changing shape, which is either by contracting or expanding. So options H and I are both about exoskeleton mechanics. However, option I says 'reforms in new positions', which is more about flexibility, whereas H is about the act of moving (contracting or expanding). Which one is the correct answer?

Wait, the question is about how movement is achieved. So if the exoskeleton itself is flexible, it can bend, allowing parts to move. So H is about the exoskeleton doing the moving. So I think H is correct.

Wait, but some sources say that arthropods use cilia on the exoskeleton to move. So I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Cili are on the exoskeleton, and that's a way to move. But I'm not sure if that's the main method.

Another thought: some insects, like beetles, have a pseudopod-like structure on the exoskeleton that can bend, allowing them to move forward. So that would support option E being correct.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H, because the exoskeleton itself contracts and expands, allowing movement. So H is the mechanism.

Wait, looking at the options, option I says 'exoskeleton contracts and expands', and option H is 'exoskeleton contracts and expands allowing for movement'.

So the question is about how movement is achieved. So if the exoskeleton changes shape, through contracting or expanding, that's movement. So both H and I are correct in describing the mechanism. But the question is asking which option describes movement, so perhaps the correct answer is H or I.

Alternatively, perhaps the exoskeleton can move by the movement of its own parts, which is the same as contracting and expanding, which is what H says.

Wait, another point: some sources say that arthropods have a flexible exoskeleton that can bend, allowing movement. So option E talks about a pliable inner layer bending. But movement is achieved by the exoskeleton's own movement, not just bending.

So perhaps H is the correct answer as it directly describes the mechanism of the exoskeleton moving by contracting and expanding.

Alternatively, some sources say that arthropods use both methods: cilia and exoskeleton movement. But the options don't have a choice combining both. So I need to pick the best option.

Wait, the options are:

A: wings → no.

B: shape change → maybe, but not primary.

C: cilia on exoskeleton → possible, but not sure.

D: muscular system → no.

E: flexible inner layer bending → movement via bending.

H: exoskeleton moving via contraction/expansion.

So if the exoskeleton can bend, that allows movement. So E would be the way movement occurs because it's the structure bending. But movement is achieved via the exoskeleton's own movement, which is H.

Hmm, the question is about the mechanism. So movement is due to the exoskeleton's own movement, not just bending. So H is the correct answer.

Alternatively, if movement is achieved by bending the exoskeleton, then E is correct. I'm a bit torn between E and H.

Wait, let me think about what each option implies. Option H says the exoskeleton contracts and expands. This would enable movement because if it's bending, it can push against the body, allowing parts to move. So that's movement. So H is correct.

But option E says movement is achieved through the flexible inner layer bending. So movement is via bending the exoskeleton. So if the question is about how the movement occurs, both E and H are correct in their approach. But the options are exclusive.

Wait, I'm getting confused because multiple options could be correct, but in reality, the correct answer is one. Let me think again.

Old notes: I think that for arthropods, the exoskeleton is a flexible structure that can bend, providing movement. So E is correct. But I read somewhere that arthropods primarily move via their exoskeleton's own movement, not just bending. So movement is due to the exoskeleton's ability to contract and expand, which is option H.

Alternatively, perhaps both E and H are correct. But in the options, only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the exoskeleton's structure allows movement via both bending and contraction. But the options don't include such a choice. 

Wait, the options are A to J, each being a single option. So perhaps the correct answer is H because it's the mechanism of movement: the exoskeleton contracting and expanding.

I think option H is correct. Because the exoskeleton can change its shape, which allows it to move. So when it contracts, parts move forward.

Another angle: the exoskeleton is made of a flexible outer layer that can bend. So movement is achieved by bending, which is option E. But H says the exoskeleton itself is contracting and expanding, which is a more precise mechanism.

So, perhaps H is correct because it's the mechanism of movement.

Another thought: the exoskeleton's movement is likely through its own structural flexibility, which allows it to bend and push or pull. So option H.

So, after considering all this, I think the correct answer is option H: The exoskeleton contracts and expands allowing for movement.

The question asks how movement is achieved in arthropods using their exoskeleton. Arthropods, such as insects, have exoskeletons that are flexible and move through structural changes. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as arthropods do not use wings for movement.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as arthropods do not change the shape of their exoskeleton to move.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as arthropods do not use cilia on their exoskeleton for movement.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as arthropods do not rely on a muscular system for movement.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as movement is not achieved through bending the exoskeleton but through its structural flexibility.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as hydraulic pressure changes are not the primary mechanism for arthropods' movement.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as a special fluid is not the primary mechanism for movement in arthropods.
- **Option H**: Correct, as the exoskeleton contracts and expands, allowing for movement.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as it describes a less precise mechanism compared to H.
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as arthropods do not have a segmented body with flexible chitin for movement.

The most accurate description is that movement in arthropods is achieved through the exoskeleton's ability to contract and expand, which allows for movement.
