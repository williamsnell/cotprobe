Okay, so I've got this law question about cause of action, specifically regarding a mortgage note and the various parties involved. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The woman mortgaged land to a mortgage company in 1993. The note is $25,000, due December 31, 1993, with a 9'/2% interest per annum. So, the interest rate is 9% per annum and compounded semi-annually? Wait, sometimes that notation can be a bit tricky. Oh right, 9'/2% means 9% annually, which is compounded every six months. So the effective rate would be slightly higher than 9%, but that's a minor detail I might not need immediately.

In 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage. That's important because recording is a step in the mortgage process. Then in 2007, the woman made a promise to convey the land to her daughter by a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed transfers the title without conveying the rights to the land, so the mortgage would still be against the original land but the note would be under the daughter's sole title. But wait, the note was originally mortgaged in 1993, so the original grantor is the woman, and the mortgage company is the conEntering party. 

In 2008, she delivered a quitclaim deed without mentioning the mortgage. So the mortgage remains against the original land, but the note is still under the daughter's title. Now, the woman defaulted on the mortgage. The question is whether the mortgage company can sue either the woman or the daughter, or both, against her.

The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me recall what cause of action applies here. A mortgage note typically falls under the mortgage covenant, which is a fourth-party covenant. If the fourth party breaches this covenant, they may have a claim. But when the mortgage is recorded, it's a step in the process. The mortgage company is the original lender, so they're the fourth party. 

So when the note is recorded in 1996, the mortgage company is legally responsible for the note. But the note is only due in 1993 and is a thirty-year mortgage. So I think the mortgage company would have a cause of action against the woman because she's the original grantor who gave the note to the mortgage company. But wait, the mortgage company is the one who took the land and lent the note, so yes, the mortgage company is the fourth party. But wait, the mortgage company is the third party because it's a third party note.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: The mortgage note is a fourth-party note (the mortgage company). So if the mortgage company breaches it, they can sue the grantor (woman) or the holder of the note (the daughter?), but wait, the daughter is the holder of the note, but the mortgage company is the fourth party.

Wait, no. The mortgage company is the third party, because it's a third-party note. So, the mortgage company's breach would give them a cause of action against either the grantor or the third party. But the note is being held by the daughter, so the mortgage company is only liable if they breached the mortgage covenant, which would be against the third party (the mortgage company) or the grantor (woman). 

Wait, wait. The note is a third-party note because the mortgage company is the lender. So if the mortgage company breaches, they can sue either the woman (the grantor) or the mortgage company itself. But in this case, the woman's action is to default on this note. So if she defaulted, the mortgage company (third party) would have a cause of action against herself because she breached the mortgage covenant. 

But wait, the mortgage company is the third party, so they can sue either the woman (the grantor) or the third party's own holder (the daughter in this case). However, the problem arises because the daughter is a separate entity. So the mortgage company is only liable for the note, not the daughter. So if the note is with the daughter, then the mortgage company's action against the daughter is not valid unless she is the third party as well. 

Wait, but the mortgage company is the third party. So if the note was misused by the daughter, then the third party (the mortgage company) can be sued by the woman (the grantor) because she gave the note to the mortgage company. But the daughter is a different entity. So the mortgage company can only sue the woman for the note, not the daughter. But here, the woman defaulted on the note. So the mortgage company would have a cause of action against the woman, as she was the grantor who gave the note to the mortgage company.

Wait, but she also delivered a quitclaim deed to the daughter in 2008. That's a separate deed. So the mortgage company's note is in the daughter's title. But the note is still under the mortgage company's covenant, so the mortgage company could potentially sue the woman. Because she was the one who gave the note to the mortgage company, the mortgage company is third party, and she's the grantor, so the mortgage company can sue her for the breach.

So, the question is whether the mortgage company can sue the woman or the daughter.

Now, the daughter delivered a quitclaim deed in 2008, which didn't mention the mortgage. That's a different matter. The note is still in the daughter's title, but the mortgage is against the original land, not the daughter's. So the mortgage is a third-party note, and the note is in the daughter's name. So the mortgage company can't sue the daughter because the daughter isn't part of the mortgage note. 

Therefore, the mortgage company can only sue the woman (the grantor) for the breach of the mortgage covenant. But wait, in the question, the woman has defaulted. So the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.

But wait, let me think again. The key is the note's validity. The note was recorded in 1996, so it's still valid. The note is due in 1993, but it's a thirty-year note. So the note is valid, but the mortgage company is the third party who's responsible. So if the mortgage company breached, they can sue the third party (woman) for the note. But the daughter isn't the third party; she's just the holder of the note. So the mortgage company can't sue the daughter.

So, what about the third party's right to action? The third party (mortgage company) can sue the woman for the breach. So the woman is the third party as well because she gave the note to the mortgage company. So yes, the mortgage company can sue the woman.

But wait, the woman has defaulted on the note, so her breach would give the mortgage company a cause of action. So that would make the woman the third party. So the mortgage company can sue her, but not the daughter because she's not the third party.

But wait, the daughter delivered a deed that didn't mention the mortgage. So the note is in the daughter's name, but the mortgage is against the original land. That doesn't affect the mortgage note's validity. So the note is valid, and the mortgage company is the third party.

Therefore, the third party can sue the woman for the breach. So the woman is the third party, and the mortgage company can sue her.

Wait, but the woman also has a quitclaim deed to the daughter in 2008. So she conveyed the land to her daughter. But the note is on the daughter's title. So the note is still under the mortgage company, but the note is with the daughter. So the mortgage company is the third party, but the note is with the daughter. So the mortgage company is liable for the note, but the note is in the daughter's name. So the mortgage company can sue the woman for the breach of the mortgage covenant, but the daughter isn't the third party. So the daughter can't sue the mortgage company.

Wait, but the question is, can the daughter have a cause of action against the mortgage company? No, because she's not the third party. So the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman, but the daughter can't. 

But wait, what about the mortgage company's own action against the daughter? No, the daughter isn't in breach because the note was on her title, not the mortgage company. 

So the mortgage company can sue the woman, and the woman has defaulted, so she is the third party. So the woman is liable. So the mortgage company would have a cause of action against the woman.

Wait, but another possibility: if the mortgage company is the third party, and she can sue the third party (woman) for the note, but the daughter is not the third party; she's the holder of the note. So the woman is the third party, so the mortgage company can sue her. But in this scenario, the woman defaulted, so she's the third party, and the mortgage company can sue her.

So the options are:

A: The mortgage company has a cause of action against both the woman and the daughter.

B: The daughter has a cause of action against the mortgage company.

C: Neither the daughter nor the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.

D: Only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.

E: Both the daughter and the mortgage company have causes of action against the woman.

F: The woman has a cause of action against the mortgage company.

G: The mortgage company and the daughter share a cause of action against the woman.

H: Only the daughter has a cause of action against the woman.

I: Both the woman and the daughter have causes of action against the mortgage company.

J: The woman has a cause of action against the daughter.

Wait, so according to my reasoning, the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman, but not the daughter. So the correct answer would be D: only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman. Or is there another consideration?

Wait, but there's something about a fourth-party note. If the note is a mortgage, the third party is the mortgage company. The third party's claim is against the third party, which includes the woman because she gave the note to them. So the mortgage company can sue the woman. That would make the mortgage company's cause of action against the woman. But the daughter's case is about the mortgage company's action against her, which is not valid because she isn't the third party.

Wait, but another angle: the mortgage note is a third-party note. So the mortgage company's breach is against the third party. If the third party is the woman, then the mortgage company can sue her. So that would be a cause of action against the woman.

But the second issue is whether the note is in the daughter's name. But the note is a third-party note, so the third party is the woman, so the daughter isn't the third party. So the daughter cannot sue the mortgage company for a cause of action against them. 

So the correct answer is D: Only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.

Wait, but wait. The woman delivered in 1993, the mortgage was recorded in 1996, and in 2007 she conveyed to the daughter. So the note was recorded in 1996, so it's a valid note. So the note is due on December 31, 1993. But does that matter? Because the note is a mortgage, so it's a third-party note. So the mortgage company's action against the woman would be valid, but the note is still on the daughter's title. 

So the mortgage company can sue the woman, but not the daughter. So the correct answer is D: Only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.

But wait, wait another perspective. The mortgage note is a third-party note, so the third party is the mortgage company. The woman is the original grantor, so she is the third party. So yes, the mortgage company can sue the woman. 

But the daughter is not part of the mortgage note. So she is not the third party, so she can't sue the mortgage company. 

So the correct answer is D: Only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.

Wait, but I'm looking at option B: daughter has a cause against the mortgage company. That can't be right because the daughter isn't the third party. So the correct answer is D.

The scenario involves a mortgage note recorded in 1996, with the note due on December 31, 1993. The woman mortgaged the land to a mortgage company in 1993 and recorded the mortgage in 1996. She conveyed the land to her daughter in a quitclaim deed in 2007, which did not mention the mortgage. The woman defaulted on the mortgage debt. The question is whether the mortgage company can sue the woman or the daughter for a cause of action.

1. **Understanding the Roles**:  
   - The woman is the grantor who mortgaged the land to the mortgage company.  
   - The mortgage company is the third party who took the land and lent the note.  
   - The note is valid and due, but it is a third-party note, meaning it is against the mortgage company.

2. **Third Party Causation**:  
   - The woman, as the third party, can sue the mortgage company for breach of the mortgage covenant.  
   - The daughter, as the holder of the note, is not the third party, so the mortgage company cannot sue her for breach.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   - The mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman, as she is the third party who breached the mortgage covenant.  
   - The daughter cannot sue the mortgage company because she is not the third party.

Thus, the correct answer is **D: Only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.**
