Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation using the straight-line method. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm. The question says that Amazing Realty bought an office building for $13,000,000. It's estimated to last 20 years and have a salvage value of $1,000,000. I need to find the annual depreciation allowance.

Wait, straight-line depreciation is calculated by taking the depreciable amount and spreading it evenly over the useful life of the asset. The formula I remember is (Cost - Salvage Value) divided by the useful life.

So, first, let's find the depreciable amount. That's the cost minus the salvage value. The cost is $13,000,000 and the salvage is $1,000,000. So subtracting them: 13,000,000 - 1,000,000 equals 12,000,000. That's the total amount of depreciation over the 20 years.

Now, to find the annual depreciation, I divide that amount by the useful life. So 12,000,000 divided by 20. Let me calculate that. 12,000,000 divided by 20 is 600,000. So each year, the building depreciates by $600,000.

Looking at the options, option I is $600,000. So that must be the correct answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Yep, cost is higher than salvage, which makes sense because you lose some value over time. The calculation seems right. So yeah, option I.

The annual depreciation allowance using the straight-line method is calculated as follows:

1. **Depreciable Amount**: 
   \[
   \text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value} = \$13,000,000 - \$1,000,000 = \$12,000,000
   \]

2. **Annual Depreciation**:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Depreciable Amount}}{\text{Useful Life}} = \frac{\$12,000,000}{20} = \$600,000
   \]

The correct annual depreciation allowance is **\$600,000**, which corresponds to option **I**.

Answer: I
