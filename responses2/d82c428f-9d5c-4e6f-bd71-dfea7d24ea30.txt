Okay, so I've got this problem here about figuring out the monthly payment needed to pay off a car in two years. The car costs $5,779, but there are several other costs involved like transportation, factory equipment, dealer equipment, insurance, sales tax, sales discount, dealer deposit, and an allowance. The question is asking for the monthly payment needed to pay it off in two years with a certain interest rate.

First, I need to calculate the total capitalized cost of the car. That includes all the upfront costs, right? So let's list them out:

- Price of car: $5,779
- Transportation charge: $73
- Factory-installed equipment: Radio 95.50, Metallic paint 59.90, Racing stripes 39.50, Power steering 98.00, Wide radial tires 198.10
- Dealer-installed equipment: Mirror $8.50, Mats 10.75, Undercoat 35
- Insurance: Collision is $505.75, but it's a $100 deduction, so that's $505.75 - $100 = $405.75. Also, comprehensive insurance is $231.50 for two years.
- Sales tax: 5%
- Cash deposit: $500
- Cost of financing: 9.5% per year for two years
- Used car allowance: $370

Wait, so the sales tax is 5% on the price of the car, which is $5,779. So sales tax is 5% of 5779, which is 5779 * 0.05 = $288.95. So adding that to the car price.

Then, let's add up all the additional costs first, before sales tax.

Factory equipment: Let's calculate each cost. Radio 95.50, Metallic paint 59.90, Racing stripes 39.50, Power steering 98, Wide radial tires 198.10. Let's add those: 95.50 + 59.90 = 155.40; 155.40 + 39.50 = 194.90; +98 = 292.90; +198.10 = 491. So that's $491.00.

Dealer equipment: Mirror $8.50, mats 10.75, undercoat 35. So 8.5 +10.75=19.25 +35=54.25. So $54.25.

So adding all those: $491 (factory) + $54.25 (dealer) = $545.25.

Now the sales tax is 5% of (5779 + 73 + 491 +54.25 + 500 +505.75). Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, the used car allowance is $370. So the total capitalized cost would be the sum of all these plus the allowance.

Wait, let me clarify. The used car allowance is a deduction from the total. So the total cost before any deductions is the sum of all the other costs plus the used allowance.

Wait, no. The used car allowance is a monthly deduction. But I think the way to calculate it is to first compute the total cost of the car, including all the other items, then subtract the used allowance.

Wait, let's re-approach this step by step.

The car price is $5,779.00.

Then, transportation: $73.00

Factory equipment: sum of radio, metallic paint, racing stripes, power steering, wide radial tires.

Let me calculate those again. Radio 95.50, metallic paint 59.90, racing stripes 39.50, power steering 98.00, wide radial tires 198.10.

Adding those up: 95.50 +59.90=155.40; 155.40+39.50=194.90; 194.90+98=292.90; +198.10=491.00. So $491.00.

Dealer equipment: Mirror 8.50, mats 10.75, undercoat 35.00. 8.5+10.75=19.25; +35=54.25. So $54.25.

Plus sales tax: 5% of the total of the car price and all these items.

Wait, the way the problem is phrased, the other costs (like transportation, factory, dealer) are listed, and then the sales tax is 5%. So perhaps the sales tax is on the sum of all these items, not including the car price. Or is it on the total including the car? Hmm, no, the problem states: "Sales tax: 5% Cash deposit: $500.00 Cost of financing: 9(1/2)% per year for two Years."

Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous on this. Let me read the question again: Find the amount to be paid each month in order to pay off car described below in two years. So the total cost includes the car and all additional costs except for sales tax, perhaps? Or including it?

Wait, the problem says: "Used car allowance: $370.00." So, perhaps the used car allowance is a deduction from the total cost. So the total cost to be financed is (car price + all other costs) - used allowance.

But let's clarify. The problem says: "Price of car: $5,779.00. Transportation charge: $73.00. Factory-installed equipment: Radio 95.50... etc." Then, the dealer-installed items: Mirror, mats, undercoat.

So, all these are separate costs. So the total capitalized cost, before sales tax, would be sum of all these.

Wait, but the problem says "used car allowance: $370.00." So, perhaps the used car allowance is a deduction, so the total cost to be financed is the sum of all these costs minus the allowance.

Alternatively, the used car allowance is an amount you can get back, so you'd subtract that from the total cost.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the total cost as the sum of all the listed items plus the used allowance, but that doesn't make sense because the used allowance is a deduction. So maybe the total cost is:

Car price + all other items (transportation, factory, dealer), plus the used allowance, minus the used allowance? That can't be right. Maybe the used allowance is a separate amount you get, so the total cost to be financed is the sum of all the listed items (including the car) but minus the used allowance.

Wait, maybe I should compute the total cost as follows:

Car price: $5,779.00

Plus transportation: $73.00

Plus factory: $491.00

Plus dealer: $54.25

Plus sales tax: 5% of (5,779 +73 +491 +54.25). Wait, no, perhaps the sales tax is applied to the sum of all these.

Wait, no, perhaps the sales tax is 5% of the total of all the items except the car. Let's get back to the problem statement.

The problem says: "Used car allowance: $370.00." So perhaps the total cost is the sum of all these items, and then you get the used allowance as a deduction.

So, let's compute each part step by step.

Compute all the costs:

Car: $5,779.00

Transportation: $73.00

Factory: Radio 95.50, Metallic paint 59.90, Racing stripes 39.50, Power steering 98.0, Wide radial tires 198.10. Sum is 95.5 +59.9=155.4; +39.5=194.9; +98=292.9; +198.1=491.00.

Dealer: Mirror 8.50, Mats 10.75, Undercoat 35.00. Sum is 8.5 +10.75=19.25; +35=54.25.

Plus sales tax: 5% of (car + factory + dealer + used allowance) ?

Wait, no. The sales tax is 5% of the total cost of the car and all other items, including the used allowance? Or not? I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the used car allowance is just a deduction from the total cost. So the total cost to be financed is the sum of all these items (car, transportation, factory, dealer) minus the used allowance.

Wait, but the used allowance is $370.00. So, perhaps the total cost to be financed is:

Car price + factory + dealer - used allowance.

So, compute:

Car: $5,779.00

Factory: $491.00

Dealer: $54.25

Used allowance: $370.00

So total before tax: 5,779 + 491 = 6,270; 6,270 +54.25= 6,324.25. Then subtract $370: 6,324.25 -370= 5,954.25.

Plus sales tax: 5% on this amount.

So 5% of 5,954.25 is 297.7125. So total with tax: 5,954.25 + 297.7125= 6,251.9625.

Wait, but wait, maybe the used allowance is a separate deduction, so the total cost to be financed is the sum of all these items (car, factory, dealer) minus the used allowance. So that's 5,779 +491 +54.25 -370= 6,254.25 -370= 5,884.25?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the used allowance is a deduction, so the total cost to be financed is (car + factory + dealer) - used allowance.

So, 5,779 +491 +54.25 = 6,279 +54.25= 6,333.25. Then subtract 370: 6,333.25 -370=5,963.25.

Then, add sales tax: 5% of 5,963.25 = 298.1625. So total becomes 5,963.25 +298.1625=6,261.4125.

Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the used allowance is a deduction from the total, so the total cost before tax is 5,779 +491 +54.25 = 6,279 +54.25=6,333.25. Then subtract used allowance: 6,333.25 -370=5,963.25. Then add tax: 5% of 5,963.25 is 298.1625. So 5,963.25 +298.1625=6,261.4125.

Alternatively, perhaps the used allowance is part of the total cost. So the total cost to be financed is the sum of all the other costs plus the used allowance.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the used allowance is a deduction, so the total cost is sum of all the individual items (car, transport, factory, dealer) minus used allowance.

So:

Car: 5,779
Transport: 73
Factory: 491
Dealer:54.25
Used allowance:370

Total before tax: 5,779 +73=5,852; 5,852 +491=6,343; 6,343 +54.25=6,397.25; 6,397.25 -370=5,963.25.

Then, apply sales tax: 5% of 5,963.25 is 298.1625. So total with tax is 5,963.25 +298.1625=6,261.4125.

Alternatively, perhaps the used allowance is a deduction from the sum, so the total cost is (car + factory + dealer) = 5,779 +491 +54.25=6,324.25, then subtract 370: 6,324.25 -370=5,954.25.

Then, add sales tax: 5% of 5,954.25=297.7125. So total becomes 5,954.25 +297.7125=6,251.9625.

Hmm, which is correct? I'm not sure, but perhaps the problem is using the standard way of calculating these. Alternatively, perhaps the used allowance is not a deduction, and the total cost is the sum of all the listed items (including the car, transport, factory, dealer) plus any other costs, but I think I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: perhaps the total cost is the sum of the car and all the other items, plus the sales tax, minus the used allowance.

Wait, but no, the used allowance is a separate deduction. So the total cost to be financed is the sum of all the other items plus the car, minus the used allowance.

So:

Car: 5,779
Transportation:73
Factory:491
Dealer:54.25
Used allowance:370

Total before deduction:5,779 +73 +491 +54.25=5,779 +73=5,852; +491=6,343; +54.25=6,397.25

Then, subtract used allowance:6,397.25 -370=5,963.25

Then, add sales tax:5% of 5,963.25=298.1625. So total becomes 5,963.25 +298.1625=6,261.4125.

Wait, but that's a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the used allowance is not part of the cost. So the total cost to be financed is 5,779 +73 +491 +54.25 =6,327.25, and then plus any other costs, like sales tax? Hmm, not sure.

But let's proceed with this approach for now.

So the total cost to be financed is 6,327.25.

Wait, no, because the used allowance is a deduction, so the total cost is 6,327.25 minus 370, which is 5,957.25.

Then, adding tax: 5,957.25 * 1.05 = 5,957.25 *1.05.

Let me calculate that: 5,957.25 * 1.05.

5,957.25 *1 =5,957.25; 5,957.25 *0.05= 297.8625. So total is 5,957.25 +297.8625=6,255.1125.

So the total amount to pay, including interest, is approximately $6,255.11.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Because the problem also mentions the cost of financing: 9.5% per year for two years. So that's an interest rate, not the tax rate. So perhaps the total amount to be paid is the present value of the loan, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the total cost to be financed is the sum of all items (car, transport, factory, dealer), plus any other costs, minus the used allowance, plus any other fees, plus interest.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is: 

Total amount to be paid = (sum of all item costs) * (1 + (rate * time)) - used allowance.

Wait, but the problem says "cost of financing: 9.5% per year for two years." So that's the interest rate for the loan.

So the formula for the monthly payment would be the present value of an ordinary annuity formula. The formula is:

PMT = (PV * (r / (1 - (1 + r)^n))) )

Wait, where PV is the present value, r is the monthly rate, n is the number of payments.

But wait, the problem here is that the total amount to be financed is (sum of all item costs) minus the used allowance, then applying the interest.

So let's recast:

Total amount = (5,779 +73 +491 +54.25) -370 = (5,779 +73)=5,852 +491=6,343 +54.25=6,397.25. Minus 370=6,027.25.

Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because the problem includes a cost of financing which is 9.5% per year for two years. So the interest is for two years, so the total interest rate is 9.5% *2=19%. So that's 19% for two years.

But the problem says "cost of financing: 9(1/2)% per year for two years." So that's 9.5% per annum for two years, so 19% total.

But the question is about calculating the monthly payment to pay off the car in two years. So if the total amount to be financed is the sum of all the costs (including the used allowance) minus the used allowance, plus the interest.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says:

"Price of car: $5,779.00. Transportation charge: $73.00. Factory-installed equipment: Radio 95.50, Metallic paint 59.90, Racing stripes 39.50, Power steering 98.00, Wide radial tires 198.10. Dealer-installed equipment: Mirror 8.50, Mats 10.75, Undercoat 35.00. Used allowance: $370.00."

So the total cost before any deductions is:

5,779 (car) +73 (transport) + (factory: 95.50 +59.90 +39.50 +98 +198.10) = sum of factory items is 95.5+59.9=155.4, +39.5=194.9, +98=292.9, +198.10=491. So 5,779 +73 +491=6,343 +54.25 =6,397.25 (dealer).

So the total before any deductions is 6,397.25.

Now, the used allowance is a deduction of 370, so the total amount to be financed is 6,397.25 -370=6,027.25.

Now, the interest rate is 9.5% per annum for two years. So the total interest is 9.5% *2=19% for two years.

Wait, but the question is about the monthly payment. So we can model this as a loan with principal amount 6,027.25, interest rate 19% for two years, and the number of monthly payments is 24 (since two years ×12 months).

So the formula for the monthly payment is:

PMT = (PV × r × (1 + r)^n ) / ( (1 + r)^n - 1 )

Where:

PV = principal amount =6,027.25

r = monthly interest rate =19% per annum /12 months =0.19/12≈0.01583333.

n = number of payments=24.

So let's compute this step by step.

First, compute (1 + r)^n.

r = 0.01583333

n=24.

(1 +0.01583333)^24.

Let me compute this:

We can use the approximation that (1 + r)^n ≈ e^(rn). But for accuracy, perhaps compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps using logarithms or a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute it as:

(1.01583333)^24.

But I don't have a calculator here, so perhaps I'll compute it in parts.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the monthly payment, which is:

PMT = [PV * r * (1 + r)^n ] / [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ]

I think I should compute each part step by step.

Compute (1 + r) =1.01583333.

Compute (1.01583333)^24.

Well, 24 is a manageable number. Let me compute it step by step.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the monthly payment.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the present value annuity formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps to compute the monthly payment using the formula:

PMT = PV × [ (i (1 + i)^n ) / ( (1 + i)^n - 1 ) ]

Where:

PV = 6,027.25

i = 9.5% per annum /12 months =0.095/12≈0.007916667.

n=24.

So, let's compute (i (1 + i)^n ) / ( (1 + i)^n -1 )

First, compute (1 + i) =1 +0.007916667=1.007916667.

Compute (1.007916667)^24.

Again, perhaps step by step.

Compute 1.007916667^1=1.007916667

^2=1.007916667^2 ≈1.0159375.

^3≈1.0159375 *1.007916667≈1.024117.

^4≈1.024117 *1.007916667≈1.03239.

Continuing this way, but maybe it's better to compute it using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute (1.007916667)^24 ≈ e^(24*0.007916667) )=e^(0.190000008)=approx 1.20696.

Wait, let's compute e^0.19.

We know that e^0.1≈1.10517.

e^0.2≈1.22140.

So e^0.19 is somewhere between 1.10517 and 1.22140.

Using linear approximation:

0.19 is 0.1 +0.09.

We can compute e^0.09.

We know that e^0.09≈1.09417.

So e^0.19= e^0.1 * e^0.09 ≈1.10517 *1.09417≈1.2107.

But perhaps more accurately, let's calculate e^0.19.

Using Taylor series around x=0.1, but perhaps it's easier to use a calculator method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the monthly payment.

Wait, perhaps I can use the Excel formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write a small table.

But considering time constraints, perhaps I can proceed with an approximate calculation.

Now, back to the formula.

Compute (i (1 + i)^n ) / ( (1 + i)^n -1 ).

We have:

i=0.007916667

(1 +i)^n=1.20696, as computed.

So, numerator:0.007916667 *1.20696≈0.009556.

Denominator: 1.20696 -1=0.20696.

So the fraction is 0.009556 /0.20696≈0.04628.

So now, the monthly payment is:

PMT= PV × [0.04628] =6,027.25 ×0.04628≈?

Compute 6,027.25 ×0.04628.

First, 6,027.25 ×0.04=241.09.

6,027.25 ×0.006=36.1635.

6,027.25 ×0.00028≈1.68763.

Adding these together: 241.09 +36.1635=277.2535; +1.68763≈278.94113.

So approximately $278.94 per month.

Looking at the options, perhaps the closest is option C: $278.91, which is very close to our calculation of $278.94.

So the correct answer should be option C: $278.91.

So putting it all together, the total amount to be financed is 6,027.25, the interest is approximately 19% for two years, and the monthly payment is approximately $278.91.
</think>

To determine the monthly payment required to pay off the car in two years, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the car and related items:**
   - Car: $5,779.00
   - Transportation charge: $73.00
   - Factory-installed equipment: $491.00
   - Dealer-installed equipment: $54.25
   - Total before deduction: $5,779.00 + $73.00 + $491.00 + $54.25 = $6,397.25

2. **Apply the used allowance deduction:**
   - Used allowance: $370.00
   - Total cost after deduction: $6,397.25 - $370.00 = $6,027.25

3. **Calculate the effective interest rate:**
   - The total period is two years, so the effective interest rate is 19% (9.5% per annum for two years).
   - Since the interest is compounded monthly, we'll use the monthly interest rate: 19% / 12 ≈ 0.00791667.

4. **Apply the present value of an ordinary annuity formula:**
   - The formula for the monthly payment (PMT) is:
     \[
     PMT = PV \times \left( \frac{i(1 + i)^n}{(1 + i)^n - 1} \right)
     \]
   - Where:
     - \( PV = \$6,027.25 \)
     - \( i = 0.00791667 \)
     - \( n = 24 \)

   - Compute \( (1 + i)^n \):
     - \( (1.00791667)^{24} \approx 1.20696 \)

   - Compute the numerator:
     - \( i \times (1 + i)^n = 0.00791667 \times 1.20696 \approx 0.009556 \)

   - Compute the denominator:
     - \( (1 + i)^n - 1 = 1.20696 - 1 = 0.20696 \)

   - Compute the fraction:
     - \( \frac{0.009556}{0.20696} \approx 0.04628 \)

   - Compute the monthly payment:
     - \( PMT = 6,027.25 \times 0.04628 \approx 278.94 \)

5. **Round to the nearest cent:**
   - The monthly payment is approximately \$278.94, which is closest to option C: \$278.91.

**ANSWER:** C
