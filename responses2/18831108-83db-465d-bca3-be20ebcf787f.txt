Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the autoprotolysis of water and how temperature affects it. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

The question is about the reaction: 2H2O ↔ H3O+ + OH- and how the pH and the neutrality of water change with temperature. The given data is that the equilibrium constant K changes from 1.0e-14 at 25°C to 9.62e-14 at 60°C.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. At 25°C, pure water has an equilibrium constant K of about 1e-14. That's the Kw value, right? So Kw = [H3O+][OH-]. So at 25°C, water is neutral because [H3O+] = [OH-] = 1e-7 M. But when the temperature increases, the Kw changes. Oh, but wait, the given K is 9.62e-14 at 60°C.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the reaction given is the dissociation of water into H3O+ and OH-. So the equilibrium constant for this reaction would be Kw. But wait, if you have 2H2O → H3O+ + OH-, then the K is Kw. So when K increases, that would mean more H3O+ and OH- ions, so the solution becomes more acidic, I think.

Wait, but wait, I remember that as temperature increases, the pH of water decreases. So in pure water, as you heat it, the solution becomes more acidic. Because the autoprotolysis is favored more, so more H3O+ and OH- are formed.

Wait, but wait. The question is about whether the pH of water or its neutrality changes when the temperature increases. So originally, at 25°C, [H3O+] = 1e-7, so pH is 7. When temperature increases, the solution becomes more acidic, so pH decreases.

So the water becomes more acidic. But wait, the options talk about whether the solution is more basic or less basic. Wait, because as you increase temperature, the water becomes more acidic, which would make the solution more basic if you think of it as [OH-] being higher. Wait, no, wait. Because [H+] and [OH-] are inversely related. So if [H+] decreases, [OH-] increases. So the solution becomes more basic.

Wait, but wait, the K for this reaction (Kw) increases with temperature. Because at higher temps, the equilibrium shifts towards the products, so more H3O+ and OH- are formed.

So, when temperature increases, the solution becomes more acidic, which makes the solution more basic. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, in pure water, higher temperature leads to more H3O+ and OH- because the reaction 2H2O ↔ H3O+ + OH- is favored. So when you add heat, you get more H3O+ and OH-.

So the solution becomes more acidic. Which means that the pH decreases. So the water becomes more acidic.

But the question is about whether the neutrality changes. Wait, when you have water, the only ions are H3O+ and OH-. So if the solution becomes more acidic, H3O+ is higher, OH- is lower. So the solution's pH decreases, but the solution remains neutral in terms of ions. Wait, no. No, because if the water is more acidic, it's not neutral. Wait, the question is about whether the water is more acidic or basic, but the options talk about whether the pH changes, and whether the neutrality changes.

Wait, but wait: the options are about whether the pH changes and whether the water becomes more acidic or more basic, and whether neutrality changes.

Wait, so perhaps the water becomes more acidic, which makes its pH decrease. So the solution is more acidic, but the ions are more H3O+ and less OH-.

But wait, the question is about whether the solution is more basic, more acidic, remains the same, etc.

So, the pH of water will change. Because at 25°C, pH is 7. At 60°C, the K for this reaction is 9.62e-14, which is higher than 1e-14. So the equilibrium shifts to form more H3O+ and OH-.

So, the pH of water will decrease. So the solution becomes more acidic, so the pH is lower than 7.

So the water is less neutral, more acidic. So the answer would be that the pH changes, and the solution becomes more acidic.

But wait, the question also asks whether the water's neutrality changes. Because at higher temps, the solution is more acidic, but the ions are just more H3O+ and less OH-. So the solution is not neutral anymore. So the water is not neutral anymore.

So the solution becomes more acidic, so it's not neutral. So the water's neutrality changes.

So the options: option E is both pH changes and neutrality changes, and the water becomes more acidic. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Both pH and neutrality change, with water becoming more acidic.

Option D: Neither pH nor neutrality change.

No, because when you heat water, the ions change. So the solution isn't neutral anymore. So the water's neutrality changes. So the correct answer is that both pH changes and the water becomes more acidic.

Wait, but wait, the question is about whether the solution becomes more basic or more acidic. Because as temperature increases, the solution becomes more acidic. So the pH decreases.

So the pH of water changes, and the solution is no longer neutral (as water has both ions) — so the answer must be E: Both pH and neutrality change, water becomes more acidic.

Wait, but wait, the options: the question is whether the water's neutrality changes. So when the solution becomes more acidic, the solution is not neutral anymore. So the answer is that the solution is no longer neutral. So the water is no longer neutral, so the answer is that both pH changes and the solution becomes more acidic.

Looking at the options, option E says both pH changes and the water becomes more acidic.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have E? Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Neutrality changes, more basic, pH constant.

B: pH changes, value increases.

C: pH decreases slightly, neutrality same.

D: Neither pH nor neutrality change.

E: Both pH and neutrality change, more acidic.

F: Only neutrality changes, more acidic.

G: pH changes, neutrality not.

H: Both pH and neutrality change, more acidic.

I: Both pH and neutrality change.

J: Both pH and neutrality remain, concentration of H3O+ increases.

Wait, but the question is about whether the solution becomes more basic or more acidic. So the pH decreases, meaning more acidic. So the solution is more acidic. So the water's neutrality changes (as it's no longer neutral), and the pH changes. So the correct option is E or another.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option E: Both pH and neutrality change, water becomes more acidic. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, how about the change in pH: does it change? Yes. Because K increases. So Kw increases, meaning pH changes from 7 to lower.

So the pH decreases, so the solution's pH decreases, becoming more acidic.

So the answer would be that both the pH changes and the water's neutrality changes, and the solution becomes more acidic. So the correct option is E.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question says, does the pH of water change? Yes. And does the neutrality change? Yes, because the solution isn't neutral anymore.

So the correct option is E: Both pH and neutrality change, with water becoming more acidic.

So the answer would be E.

The question involves analyzing the effects of temperature on the autoprotolysis of water, represented by the reaction \( 2H_2O \rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + OH^- \). The equilibrium constant \( K \) for this reaction changes with temperature: at 25°C, \( K = 1.0 \times 10^{-14} \), and at 60°C, \( K = 9.62 \times 10^{-14} \). The task is to determine whether the pH of water changes and whether its neutrality changes when the temperature increases from 25°C to 60°C.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Equilibrium Behavior**:  
   At 25°C, pure water is neutral (\([H_3O^+] = [OH^-] = 1.0 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)), and the pH is 7. As the temperature increases, the equilibrium constant \( K \) increases, favoring the dissociation of water into \( H_3O^+ \) and \( OH^- \). This makes the solution more acidic.

2. **Effect on Ion Concentrations**:  
   Increasing temperature shifts the equilibrium toward the products (\( H_3O^+ \) and \( OH^- \)), leading to higher concentrations of \( H_3O^+ \) and lower concentrations of \( OH^- \). Consequently, the pH decreases, and the solution becomes more acidic.

3. **Neutrality of Water**:  
   The solution is no longer neutral because it contains both \( H_3O^+ \) and \( OH^- \). The presence of both ions indicates that the water is no longer neutral, and the pH changes accordingly.

4. **Options Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The solution is not neutral, and the pH does not remain constant.  
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The pH changes, but the value does not increase.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The pH does change, and the solution is not neutrally neutral.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The pH changes, and the solution is not neutral.  
   - **Option E**: Correct. The pH changes, and the solution becomes more acidic.  
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The solution is not neutral.  
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The pH changes, but the solution is not neutral.  
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The pH changes, and the solution is more acidic.  
   - **Option I**: Correct. Both the pH and the neutrality change, and the solution becomes more acidic.  
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. The pH does not remain constant, and the solution is not neutral.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **E**, as the pH changes, and the solution becomes more acidic.
