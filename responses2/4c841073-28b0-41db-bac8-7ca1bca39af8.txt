Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about authors and their contributions to strategy and competitive advantage. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might need to think carefully.

The question is asking which author emphasized strategy as achieving a competitive advantage for an organization. The options are A to D, each with a different author and year. I remember that strategy is a big part of business management, especially in the context of competitive advantage. 

I think the key here is to recall who was known for their work on this topic. I remember that Thomas Steyn wrote a book called "The Competitive Advantage of Business." I'm pretty sure that's right. So Steyn's work is foundational for understanding how businesses can gain a competitive edge through their strategies.

Looking at the options, option A is Steyn (2003). Wait, but I thought his work was from the 1930s. Maybe I'm mixing up the years. Oh, wait, perhaps the question refers to a more recent work. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing him with someone else. Let me think again. I think he's the one who laid the groundwork for the competitive advantage model, so his book would be the key.

Option C is Cutlip et al (2006). I'm not as sure about Cutlip. I don't remember Cutlip being the main author for the competitive advantage concept. He might have written a book, but I think he's more associated with something else, like the 5 Cs or other business models. Maybe not the one emphasized as the primary model.

Option B is Gregory (2006). I'm not certain about Gregory's work. I think he might have written about business strategies, but I don't remember him being the main author for competitive advantage. Maybe he's more about branding or other areas.

Option D is Henry (2006). Henry is another name I've heard in the context of business strategies. I'm not as sure about his specific contributions, but I don't think he's the one who is famous for emphasizing strategy as a competitive advantage.

Putting it all together, among the options, Steyn's work is the most likely candidate. He's the one who introduced the competitive advantage model, so his book is the key text. The other options are either not as well-known for that work or perhaps for different aspects of business strategy.
