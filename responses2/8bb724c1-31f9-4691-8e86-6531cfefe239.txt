Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find how many integers between 1 and 100 (including both) are divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

I remember something about the inclusion-exclusion principle from math class. It's used to calculate the number of elements in a union of sets without double-counting. So, if I have sets A, B, and C, the number of elements in A ∪ B ∪ C is equal to |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|.

In this case, the sets are numbers divisible by 2, 3, or 5. So, let's define:
- A as the set of numbers divisible by 2,
- B as the set divisible by 3,
- C as the set divisible by 5.

So, I need to find |A ∪ B ∪ C|. 

First, let's calculate each individual set size. 

For set A (divisible by 2): The numbers between 1 and 100 divisible by 2 are 2,4,...,100. That's 100/2 =50 numbers.

Set B (divisible by 3): 100 divided by 3 is approximately 33.333, so 33 numbers.

Set C (divisible by 5): 100/5=20 numbers.

Next, we need the intersections. The intersection of A and B (A∩B) are numbers divisible by both 2 and 3, which is their least common multiple. LCM(2,3)=6. So numbers divisible by 6. 100/6 is about 16.666, so 16 numbers.

Similarly, A∩C is numbers divisible by 2 and 5, which is 10. 100/10=10.

B∩C is numbers divisible by 3 and 5, which is 15. 100/15 is about 6.666, so 6 numbers.

Now, the intersection of all three, A∩B∩C, is numbers divisible by 2,3,5. LCM(2,3,5)=30. 100/30 is ~3.333, so 3 numbers.

Putting it all together: |A| + |B| + |C| =50+33+20=103.

Now subtract the intersections: 103 - (16 +10 +6)=103 -32=71.

Then add back the intersection of all three: 71 +3=74.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm getting 74, but none of the options have 74 as the highest. Let me double-check. Oh wait, the options are A to J, with E being 74. So that would be option E.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount the numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the total numbers as 100. Then subtract the numbers not divisible by 2,3,5. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using inclusion-exclusion correctly.

Wait, let me re-calculate the individual counts. 

Divisible by 2: 50 (2,4,...,100)
Divisible by 3: 33 (3,6,...,99)
Divisible by 5: 20 (5,10,...,100)

A∩B: 16 (6,12,...,96)
A∩C:10 (10,20,...,100)
B∩C:6 (15,30,...,90)
A∩B∩C:3 (30,60,90)

So inclusion-exclusion: 50+33+20 -16-10-6 +3 = 50+33=83, +20=103. Then subtract 16+10+6=32: 103-32=71. Add 3: 74.

So that gives 74 numbers. Looking at the options, E is 74. So the answer is E.

The correct approach uses the inclusion-exclusion principle to count numbers divisible by 2, 3, or 5 up to 100. Calculations yield 74 numbers, which is option E.

Answer: E
