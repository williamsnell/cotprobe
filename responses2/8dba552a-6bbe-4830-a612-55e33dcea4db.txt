Okay, so I've got this question about tariffs and quotas, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about these concepts. 

Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods, usually in order to protect domestic industries. They can have various effects depending on the specific situation. On the other hand, quotas are limits on the amount of a particular good that can be imported. They're often used to control the production or demand of a particular good.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Affects domestic prices. It says the former lowers while the latter raises. I know that when a country imposes a tariff (like a domestic price), it can make domestic prices go up because the cost of imported goods increases. But if a country imposes a quota (a price limit on imports), it might allow domestic prices to go down because they can impose their own prices within the quota. So this seems correct.

Option B: Reduces overall cost for consumers. Tariffs would increase costs because consumers have to pay more for imported goods. Quotas might allow cheaper imports, so consumers' costs could go down. So B is incorrect.

Option C: No impact on trade volume. That's not right. Tariffs and quotas definitely affect trade. For example, tariffs can create distortions in the market, leading to more imports. Quotas can restrict trade as well.

Option D: Higher prices. That's the opposite of A. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Ensure market stability without affecting domestic. Wait, I think I remember that both tariffs and quotas can have indirect effects on domestic markets. For example, higher tariffs can disrupt trading, leading to trade issues. Also, if a country imposes a quota, it can affect the price levels. So E seems incorrect.

Option F: Lower prices due to competition. That doesn't make sense. Quotas can lower prices because they restrict imports, leading to a more competitive market. Tariffs can raise domestic prices as they increase the cost. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Affects prices with the former price going up and latter down. Wait, that's the opposite of A. Which one is correct? If a country imposes a quota, domestic prices would be lower. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Promote trade. No, that's not right. Tariffs and quotas are meant to restrict trade, not promote it.

Option I: Enforce environmental standards. That's about regulations, not tariffs or quotas. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Do not affect prices necessarily. But I think they do have effects, so J is incorrect.

So, the correct answer must be A. Let me see: A says the former (tariff) lowers prices and the latter (quota) raises them. That's correct because tariffs increase prices, and quotas allow lower prices.

Wait, but I'm confused here. Wait, sometimes the terminology can be tricky. Let me think again.tariffs: when a country imposes a tariff on imports, it can make the price of the imported goods higher (so domestic prices go up). Quotas, like a cap on imports, might allow a country to set its own price within that cap, thus domestic prices could be lower. So option A is correct.

So the answer is A.

The correct answer is A: "Affects domestic prices: the former lowers them while the latter raises them." Tariffs increase domestic prices, while quotas allow cheaper imports, leading to lower prices. 

Answer: A
