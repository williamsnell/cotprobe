Okay, so I need to figure out what happens when a healthy person starts to breathe too fast. I remember that when you breathe faster, it's called hyperventilation. But how does that affect blood levels?

Hmm, I think when you breathe faster, your heart is racing. That would increase the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide being exchanged with the blood. Wait, but the body's oxygen-carrying blood is called blood oxygen. So when you breathe faster, your body is trying to get more oxygen from your blood to get rid of more carbon dioxide. Oh right, because in hyperventilation, you're trying to expel more carbon dioxide.

I remember something about how the body uses partial pressure and hydrogen ions. Partial pressure is the concentration of a gas in the blood. So, when you breathe faster, maybe the partial pressure of carbon dioxide decreases because your body is trying to expel it. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. If the person is trying to get rid of more CO2, then the partial pressure should go down. Because CO2 is in your blood, and you're trying to expel it, so the concentration of CO2 in your blood would decrease.

What about hydrogen ions? I remember something about the concentration of H+ ions playing a role in how much oxygen can be exchanged. When you breathe faster, you increase the rate of oxygen consumption. So the body is trying to get more oxygen from the blood. Oxygen is in the blood, and if the concentration of H+ increases, that might affect how much oxygen can be taken up. Wait, maybe the increase in H+ leads to a decrease in the rate of oxygen uptake. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, I think I read that in hyperventilation, the concentration of H+ increases. Because when you breathe faster, the body is trying to expel more CO2, which affects the pH of the blood. So the pH goes down, which makes the H+ concentration higher. Because if the blood's pH is lower, the H+ is more abundant.

So when the blood's pH drops (because the body is trying to expel CO2, which lowers the pH), the body's oxygen uptake decreases. So the partial pressure of oxygen (which is related to how much oxygen is in the blood) would decrease, but wait, maybe the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is also affected.

Wait, partial pressure of CO2. If the body is trying to expel more CO2, the partial pressure would decrease. Because in the blood, the concentration of CO2 is lower. So both partial pressure of CO2 and partial pressure of oxygen would decrease.

But wait, oxygen is O2, and if the body is trying to get more of it from the blood, the partial pressure of O2 would decrease. Because O2 is more likely to bind to hemoglobin, and if the partial pressure of O2 is lower, the body's oxygen consumption would decrease.

Wait, but in the case of hyperventilation, the person's heart is racing, so the body is trying to get more O2 from the blood. So the partial pressure of O2 would decrease, but that's for oxygen.

But the question is about the change in the person's blood: what happens to the partial pressure of CO2 and the concentration of H+?

So, when you breathe faster, you're increasing the rate of CO2 removal, which lowers the pH. So H+ increases. Because lower pH means more H+ (since pH = pKa), so H+ is higher.

So in the blood, the concentration of H+ increases. But what about the partial pressure of CO2? The partial pressure of CO2 in the blood decreases because the body is trying to expel more CO2.

Wait, the options are about the change in the person's blood. So, if the person's blood is normal, what's the effect?

So, in the blood, the partial pressure of CO2 would decrease, and the concentration of H+ would increase.

Looking at the options:

A: No change in both.
B: Decrease in CO2, decrease in H+.
C: No change in CO2, increase in H+.
D: Decrease in CO2, increase in H+.
E: Increase in CO2, decrease in H+.
F: Decrease in CO2, no change in H+.
G: Both change, different rates.
H: Increase in CO2, no change in H+.
I: Decrease in CO2, no change in H+.
J: Increase in CO2, increase in H+.

So option D says a decrease in CO2 partial pressure and an increase in H+ concentration. That would match what I thought.

Wait, but wait. Another point: the body's concentration of H+ in the blood would increase because of hyperventilation. So yes, the pH goes down, meaning more H+.

So the correct answer is D: a decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and an increase in concentration of hydrogen ions.

When a healthy person starts to breathe too fast (hyperventilation), their body undergoes significant changes. This situation involves increased heart rate, which forces the body to expel more carbon dioxide (CO₂) and consume more oxygen (O₂). The body's ability to exchange oxygen with blood is impaired because oxygen binds to hemoglobin, and the body's oxygen uptake decreases. This results in a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood.

Additionally, hyperventilation lowers the pH of the blood because the removal of CO₂ reduces the concentration of CO₂ in the blood. Lower pH corresponds to a higher concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) in the blood, as the pH scale reflects the concentration of H⁺ ions relative to the ionization constant of water (Ka). Therefore, hyperventilation leads to an increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood.

Analyzing the options provided:

- **Option D** states that the partial pressure of carbon dioxide decreases and the concentration of hydrogen ions increases, which aligns with the effects of hyperventilation.
- Other options either describe no change in either parameter, both changes in the opposite direction, or incorrect changes in either parameter.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: D**
