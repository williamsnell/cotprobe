Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it.

The doorman is trying to get three taxicabs for three different couples. The arrival of empty cabs follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 2 minutes. We need to find the probability that all three couples are taken care of within 6 minutes. And there are multiple-choice options given, but I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, exponential distribution. I remember that the exponential distribution is often used to model the time between events in a Poisson process. The key thing about the exponential distribution is that it's memoryless, meaning the wait time doesn't depend on how long you've already been waiting.

The mean here is 2 minutes, so the rate parameter λ is 1/2 per minute. The probability density function (pdf) for an exponential distribution is f(t) = λe^(-λt). 

Now, the problem is about three couples, so three exponential variables. We need the probability that all three are less than or equal to 6 minutes. Since the events are independent, the probability that all three take care of their couples within 6 minutes would be the product of each individual probability.

So for one couple, the probability that their taxi arrives within 6 minutes is P(T ≤ 6), where T is exponential with λ=1/2. 

Calculating that: P(T ≤6) = 1 - e^(-λt) = 1 - e^(- (1/2)*6) = 1 - e^(-3). Let me compute that. 

e^(-3) is approximately 0.0498. So 1 - 0.0498 is about 0.9502. So each couple has approximately a 95% chance of being taken care of within 6 minutes.

But wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, no, wait again. Wait, the mean is 2 minutes, so the probability that T ≤6 is 1 - e^(-3) ≈ 0.9502. So each couple has a ~95% chance.

But wait, wait, no! Because for any exponential distribution, the probability that T ≤ t is 1 - e^(-λt). So in this case, λ is 1/2, t is 6.

So 1 - e^(-3) is approximately 0.9502, correct. So each couple has a ~95% chance. Since the three events are independent, the probability that all three are ≤6 minutes is (0.9502)^3.

Let me calculate that. 0.9502 cubed is approximately 0.9502 * 0.9502 * 0.9502. Let me compute that step by step. 

First, 0.9502 * 0.9502 is about 0.9029 (since 0.95^2 is 0.9025, so 0.9502^2 is slightly higher, maybe around 0.9029).

Then multiply that by 0.9502: 0.9029 * 0.9502 ≈ ?

Let me compute 0.9029 * 0.95.

0.9 * 0.95 is 0.855, and 0.0029 * 0.95 is about 0.002755. Adding these gives approximately 0.857755. So about 0.857755, or about 85.78%.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate e^(-3) as 0.0498, so 1 - e^-3 ≈ 0.9502. So the probability for each is about 0.9502. So three of them, so (0.9502)^3.

But perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let me compute e^(-3) = 1/(e^3) ≈ 1/20.0855 ≈ 0.0498. So 1-0.0498 is 0.9502.

So (0.9502)^3 = ?

Well, let me compute 0.95^3. 0.95^3 is 0.857375. Since 0.9502 is a bit higher than 0.95, so the cube will be a bit higher than 0.857375. Let me compute 0.9502^3.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as:

(0.95 + 0.0002)^3 = 0.95^3 + 3*(0.95)^2*(0.0002) + 3*(0.95)*(0.0002)^2 + (0.0002)^3.

Compute each term:

0.95^3 = 0.857375.

3*(0.95)^2*(0.0002) = 3*(0.9025)*(0.0002) = 3 * 0.0001805 = 0.0005415.

3*(0.95)*(0.0002)^2 = 3*(0.95)*(0.00000004) = 3 * 0.000000038 = 0.000000114.

And the last term is (0.0002)^3 = 0.00000000008. Which is negligible.

Adding up these: 0.857375 + 0.0005415 = 0.8579165, plus 0.000000114 gives 0.857916614, plus 0.00000000008 is still ≈0.857916614.

Wait, but wait, that's (0.9502)^3, but our actual probability is (0.9502)^3, which I just calculated as approximately 0.8579166.

But wait, no, because e^(-3) is 0.049787, so 1-0.049787 is 0.950213. So perhaps I should use more accurate numbers.

Let me recalculate (1 - e^(-3))^3.

First, compute 1 - e^(-3). e^3 is about 20.0855, so e^(-3) is 1/20.0855 ≈ 0.049787. So 1 - 0.049787 = 0.950213.

Now, cube that: (0.950213)^3.

Let me compute it using more precise steps:

0.950213 * 0.950213 = ?

Well, 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025. But perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as:

(0.95 + 0.000213)^2 = 0.95^2 + 2*(0.95)*(0.000213) + (0.000213)^2.

0.95^2 is 0.9025.

2 * 0.95 * 0.000213 = 2 * 0.95 * 0.000213 = 1.9 * 0.000213 = 0.0004047.

(0.000213)^2 ≈ 0.000000045369.

Adding up: 0.9025 + 0.0004047 = 0.9029047, plus 0.000000045369 is approximately 0.902904745369.

Now, multiply this by 0.950213 to get the cube.

So 0.902904745369 * 0.950213.

Hmm, this seems a bit tedious. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to approximate.

But wait, perhaps I should just calculate 0.950213 cubed more accurately. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator approach, but since I don't have one, perhaps I can find an approximate value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for (a + b)^3, where a = 0.95 and b = 0.000213.

So (a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2 b + 3a b^2 + b^3.

Compute each term:

a^3 = 0.95^3 = 0.857375.

3a^2 b = 3*(0.9025)*(0.000213) = 3*(0.000192075) = 0.000576225.

3a b^2 = 3*(0.95)*(0.000000045369) = 3*(0.000000042955) = 0.000000128865.

b^3 = (0.000213)^3 ≈ 0.0000000000964.

Adding them up: 0.857375 + 0.000576225 = 0.857951225. Then add 0.000000128865, which gives 0.857951353865. Then add 0.0000000000964, so approximately 0.85795135.

So, the cube is approximately 0.85795135.

Wait, but wait, is this correct? Because I'm using more precise numbers now. So (0.950213)^3 is approximately 0.857951.

But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, let me think about it in another way.

Alternatively, since each of the three couples has a probability p = 1 - e^(-3) ≈ 0.950213, then the probability that all three are handled in 6 minutes is p^3.

So p^3 ≈ (0.950213)^3 ≈ 0.857951.

But wait, that's not the case. Because for each couple, the probability is p, and since they are independent, the probability that all three are handled within 6 minutes is p multiplied by p multiplied by p, which is p^3.

So that's correct. So p^3 is approximately 0.857951.

Looking at the options provided, the options are A:7, B:3, C:2, D:6, E:9, F:5, G:10, H:8, I:4, J:1.

None of these are 0.857, which is approximately 85.8%. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the problem says the doorman is trying to get three taxicabs for three different couples. So each couple requires one taxi. The arrival times for each are independent exponential variables with mean 2 minutes. We need to find the probability that all three are handled within 6 minutes.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is that the exponential distribution is memoryless, but perhaps we're looking for the probability that all three are less than or equal to 6, which is the same as 1 minus the probability that at least one is greater than 6.

But that approach could be easier. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the probability that all three are less than or equal to 6.

Wait, but I think I'm on the right track. Let me re-express this.

Each couple's taxi arrival time is an exponential variable with λ=1/2, as the mean is 2 minutes.

The probability that a single taxi arrives within 6 minutes is P(T ≤6) = 1 - e^(-3) ≈ 0.950213.

So the probability that all three are within 6 minutes is (0.950213)^3 ≈ 0.857951, which is approximately 85.8%.

But the options are integers, so perhaps the problem expects an approximate answer, like 85.8% which is closest to 86%, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the probability that all three are less than or equal to 6 as 1 - (probability that at least one is greater than 6).

The probability that a single taxi arrives after 6 minutes is e^(-3) ≈ 0.049787.

The probability that at least one of the three taxis arrives after 6 minutes is 1 - (1 - e^(-3))^3.

Wait, but wait, that's the same as:

1 - (probability that all are ≤6) = 1 - (1 - e^(-3))^3.

So the probability that all are ≤6 is (1 - e^(-3))^3, which is approximately 0.950213^3 ≈ 0.857951.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-examine the question.

Wait, the problem says "the doorman will get all three couples taken care of within 6 minutes." So it's the probability that all three are handled within 6 minutes.

But perhaps I should model this as the time until the third arrival, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the minimum of three exponential variables, but no, that's not what's happening here.

Wait, no, wait. Each couple's arrival time is independent and follows an exponential distribution. We're to find the probability that all three are ≤6. So yes, the correct approach is to compute (1 - e^(-3))^3.

But the options are integers, so perhaps the correct answer is 8, which is option H. Because 0.857951 is approximately 85.8%, which is closest to 85.8% or 86%, but the options are all integers. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the probability as a fraction, but I don't think so.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute (1 - e^(-3))^3 more accurately.

e^3 is approximately 20.0855, so e^(-3) is 1/20.0855 ≈ 0.049787.

So 1 - e^(-3) ≈ 0.950213.

Now, 0.950213^3:

Let me compute it using a calculator approach. Let me compute 0.95^3 first. 0.95^3 is 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025, then *0.95 again: 0.9025 *0.95 = 0.857375.

But since 0.950213 is a bit higher than 0.95, the cube will be a bit higher. Let's compute 0.950213^3.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as:

Let x = 0.950213.

x^2 = (0.950213)^2. Let me compute that:

0.950213 * 0.950213:

Multiply 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

Then, 0.000213 * 0.950213 * 2 = 0.000406.

And 0.000213^2 = about 0.000000045.

So total x^2 ≈ 0.9025 + 0.000406 + 0.000000045 ≈ 0.902906.

Now multiply x^2 by x again: 0.902906 * 0.950213.

Compute this as:

0.9 * 0.950213 = 0.8551917.

0.002906 * 0.950213 ≈ 0.002762.

So adding these together: 0.8551917 + 0.002762 ≈ 0.8579537.

So the cube is approximately 0.8579537, which is about 0.858.

So the probability is approximately 0.858, which is approximately 85.8% chance.

Looking at the options:

A:7

B:3

C:2

D:6

E:9

F:5

G:10

H:8

I:4

J:1

The closest integer is 8. So the correct answer is H:8.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The question is about the probability that all three couples are taken care of within 6 minutes. So if I compute the probability correctly, it's approximately 0.858, which is approximately 85.8%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is 8, which is option H.

But wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that Poisson processes are involved, but no, in this case, the exponential variables are memoryless, but not that they model the waiting times.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem as the probability that all three are handled within 6 minutes, which is the cube of (1 - e^(-3)).

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1 - e^(-3))^3 more accurately.

Let me compute it as:

(1 - e^(-3))^3 = (1 - 1/e^3)^3.

Compute e^3 = 20.0855369232.

So 1/e^3 = 0.04978706837.

So 1 - 1/e^3 = 0.95021293163.

Now, cube this:

0.95021293163^3.

Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

Let me compute:

0.95021293163 * 0.95021293163:

Well, that's equal to (0.95 + 0.00021293163)^2.

Which is 0.95^2 + 2 * 0.95 * 0.00021293163 + (0.00021293163)^2.

Compute each term:

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

2 * 0.95 * 0.00021293163 = 1.9 * 0.00021293163 ≈ 0.00040457.

(0.00021293163)^2 ≈ 4.535e-8.

Adding up: 0.9025 + 0.00040457 = 0.90290457 + 0.00000004535 ≈ 0.90290461535.

Now multiply this by 0.95021293163:

0.90290461535 * 0.95021293163.

Let me compute this as:

0.90290461535 = 0.9 * 1.003227.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to approximate using known multiplications.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the binomial expansion or another method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as:

Let me compute 0.90290461535 * 0.95021293163.

Let me consider that 0.90290461535 * 0.95021293163 ≈ (0.9 + 0.00290461535) * (0.95 + 0.00021293163).

But maybe that's complicating it further.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that 0.95021293163 cubed is approximately 0.857953, which is about 0.858.

So the probability is approximately 0.858, which is 85.8%. But the options given are all integers, from 1 to 10, so perhaps the correct answer is 8, which is H.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is 9, which is option E. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1 - e^(-3))^3 more accurately.

e^3 is approximately 20.0855369232.

So 1 - e^(-3) is 1 - 1/20.0855369232 ≈ 1 - 0.04978706837 ≈ 0.95021293163.

Now, let's compute (0.95021293163)^3.

Let me compute it using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as follows:

Let me compute 0.95021293163 * 0.95021293163.

Which is (0.95 + 0.00021293163)^2.

Which is 0.95^2 + 2*0.95*0.00021293163 + (0.00021293163)^2.

Compute each term:

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

2 * 0.95 * 0.00021293163 = 1.9 * 0.00021293163 ≈ 0.00040457.

(0.00021293163)^2 ≈ 4.535e-8.

Adding these: 0.9025 + 0.00040457 = 0.90290457 + 4.535e-8 ≈ 0.9029050235.

Now, multiply this by 0.95021293163.

So 0.9029050235 * 0.95021293163 = ?

Let me compute this as:

0.9029050235 * 0.95021293163 = ?

Well, perhaps I can approximate this by considering that 0.9029050235 * 0.95021293163 ≈ (0.9 + 0.0029050235) * (0.95 + 0.00021293163).

But perhaps it's easier to note that 0.9029050235 * 0.95021293163 is approximately 0.857953.

So the cube is approximately 0.857953, which is 85.7953%.

Wait, but the options given are all integers, so perhaps the closest is 8, which is H. So the correct answer is H:8.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the Poisson approximation, but no, that's not applicable here because the exponential variables are memoryless.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is 8, which is H. So the final answer is H:8.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{H}
</think>

The doorman needs to determine the probability that all three couples (each with an exponential distribution) are taken care of within 6 minutes. Each couple's taxi arrival time follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 2 minutes.

1. **Probability Calculation for a Single Couple**:
   - The probability that a single couple arrives within 6 minutes is given by:
     \[
     P(T \leq 6) = 1 - e^{-3} \approx 0.95021293163
     \]

2. **Probability for All Three Couples**:
   - Since each couple's arrival time is independent, the probability that all three couples arrive within 6 minutes is the cube of the probability for a single couple:
     \[
     (1 - e^{-3})^3 \approx (0.95021293163)^3
     \]

3. **Cube Calculation**:
   - Calculating the cube of 0.95021293163:
     \[
     (0.95021293163)^3 \approx 0.857953
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The probability that all three couples are taken care of within 6 minutes is approximately 85.8%, which is closest to the integer 8.

Thus, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{H}
\]
