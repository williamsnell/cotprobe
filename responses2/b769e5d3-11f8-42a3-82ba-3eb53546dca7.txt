Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about correlation and variability. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that when the correlation between high school students' GPA and the time they spend studying each week is a certain value, then 15% of the variability in GPA is accounted for by studying time. I need to pick the correct correlation coefficient from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that the correlation coefficient, often denoted as r, measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. The closer r is to 1 or -1, the stronger the relationship. R-squared, which is r squared, represents the proportion of variance in one variable that can be explained by the other variable. So, if 15% of the variability is accounted for, that means 0.15 is the r squared value.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question says 15% of variability is accounted for. So the r squared is 0.15, right? Because r squared is the proportion explained. So the correlation coefficient r would be the square root of 0.15. Let's calculate that.

The square root of 0.15 is approximately 0.387. Looking at the options, I see option E is 0.39, which is close. Option C is 0.39 squared, which is 0.15, so that's r squared. The question asks for the correlation (r), so it's 0.39.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes people get confused between r and r squared. Oh wait, the question explicitly asks for the correlation. So it's the r value. So if r squared is 0.15, then r is sqrt(0.15) ≈ 0.387, which rounds to 0.39. So option E is 0.39, which would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, if someone thought the question was about r squared, they might pick option C. But the question is about the correlation, so it's E.

The question asks for the correlation coefficient (r) when 15% of the variability in GPA is explained by studying time. Since r squared equals 0.15, the correlation coefficient r is the square root of 0.15, approximately 0.39. 

Answer: E
