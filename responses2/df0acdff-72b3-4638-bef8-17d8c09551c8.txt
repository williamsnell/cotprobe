Question:

New York State has a criminal statute making it illegal to knowingly interfere with the operation of government with malicious intent. Corry is a computer hacker, who shut down the New York government's website by infecting it with a virus. The virus entered the electronic mail of users and mailed itself to every address listed in each user's e-mail address book every two hours. The website was crippled for the last week of January. The state passed a law in February clarifying that knowingly infecting the state's internet server with a computer virus met the definition of interference in the statute. During the subsequent criminal trial against Corry in March, the state asked for a jury instruction based on the statutory computer virus clarification. The defense objects to the instruction. How should the state court judge rule?

Options:

A: Admit the instruction, as a bill of attainder.
B: Reject the instruction, as it attempts to apply the law retroactively.
C: Admit the instruction, as it provides clarity on the existing law.
D: Reject the instruction, as it is irrelevant to the case.
E: Admit the instruction, as it is a valid interpretation of the law.
F: Reject the instruction, based on ex post facto.
G: Reject the instruction as a violation of due process.
H: Reject the instruction, as it is not a valid interpretation of the law.
I: Admit the instruction, because the law was passed before the prosecution was initiated.
J: Admit the instruction, as it is a necessary update to the law.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this criminal law question. Let me read it again and break it down.

So, the question is about whether the state's court judge should admit a jury instruction based on a clarification of the statutory computer virus law. The defense objects, and the options are A to J. I need to figure out which one is the right answer.

First, I'll try to understand the legal concepts involved here. The main issue is about the application of laws to a case after the law was passed but before the case was tried. This is known as a retroactive application of law or retroactive compliance.

The statute in New York criminalizes knowingly interfering with government operations with malicious intent. Corry was a hacker who infected the New York government's website with a virus. The virus spread to every user's email address every two hours, and the website was shut down for a week. Then, the state passed a law in February clarifying that knowingly infecting the state's internet server with a virus met the statutory definition of interference. So, the state's law was established in February, and the prosecution was in March with the trial.

The state asked for a jury instruction based on this clarification. The defense objects because they think the instruction is invalid. So the question is: can the state use the new law to invalidate any prior legal rules, like the original statute, when the new law was passed?

I remember that the principle of non retroactive application of law states that a law passed in a certain year cannot be retroactively applied to a case that was started before that law was passed. So, if the state's law was passed before the trial, the court shouldn't retroactively apply it to any prior cases, including the original statute.

Now, the defense might argue that the new law clarifies the original statute, so it's trying to apply the new law retroactively. But the state would argue that the law was passed before the trial started, so retroactive application isn't allowed.

Looking at the options:

A: Admit the instruction as a bill of attainder. I'm not sure about the bill of attainder rule. The Bill of attainder applies when a defendant is found guilty in a prior case and the new law changes the intent of the prior law. But here, the question is about the application of the new law, not retroactively applying the old law. So maybe A isn't the right answer.

B: Reject the instruction as retroactive application. That sounds right. The state can't apply the new law retroactively to the original statute because the law was passed before the trial. So the instruction is invalid.

C: Admit the instruction as a clarification. Maybe they're suggesting that the new law clarifies the original, so courts can enforce it. But courts don't apply retroactive laws, so this might not be correct.

D: Reject the instruction because it's irrelevant. Probably not, because the instruction is about the law's clarification, which is a legal point, not irrelevant.

E: Admit instruction because it's a valid interpretation. I'm not sure about this. The state might think the new law is a valid interpretation, but the law was passed before the trial started, so it's not retroactive.

F: Reject because of ex post facto. That's about facts after the law was enacted. But the instruction is about retroactive application, so ex post facto doesn't apply.

G: Reject as a violation of due process. That's more about whether the application of the law affects a person's right. But the issue is about retroactive application, not due process.

H: Reject as a violation of due process. Not sure, but the question isn't about that.

I: Admit because it's a necessary update. Hmm, I don't think that's a standard reasoning.

J: Admit as a necessary update. Maybe, but again, I'm not certain.

So, the correct answer should be B. The state can't apply the retroactive law because it was passed before the trial. The instruction is invalid because it's trying to retroactively apply the new law to the original statute, which isn't allowed.

The state cannot admit the instruction based on retroactive application of the law because it was passed before the prosecution's trial. Retroactive application is prohibited under the non-r retroactive law, so the instruction is invalid.

Answer: B
