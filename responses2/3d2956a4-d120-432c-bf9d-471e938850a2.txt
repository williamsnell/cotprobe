Okay, so I've got this accounting question here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about auditing, specifically account receivables. The question is asking what the auditor should do when a client requests not to confirm a certain account's balance. 

The question gives options A through D. I need to figure out which is the correct answer.

First, let me read the question again. The scenario is that an audit client wants the auditor to confirm a specific account. But the client has a valid reason not to do so. The options are about what the auditor should do in this situation.

So, what's the proper auditing procedure here? I remember that when an auditor has a reason not to confirm an account, they should consider the implications. They can't just confirm the account because that would create an opinion that the account is confirmed, which might raise issues later.

Option A suggests verifying the account via bank statements and cash receipts. That makes sense because the client might want to confirm the account's balance, so the auditor needs to verify it. So, that's a possibility.

Option B says to select a different account of similar size. Maybe the client thinks the account is too small and wants to confirm it, but since they're requesting not to confirm the original, perhaps they don't need to pick another. But I'm not sure. It might be another approach.

Option C is asking for management to document the matter in a management rep letter. I'm less certain about the role of management documents here. Management letters are used for internal communication, but if the auditor wants to request a different account, I'm not sure if the client's management would be asked to do that. Maybe it's more about the auditor communicating the request rather than the management.

Option D says the auditor should explain that the request will most likely cause disqualification. I think that's a key point. If the auditor is confirming an account, they have an opinion. If they're not, they might have doubts, leading to a disqualification. So, the auditor's statement here is correct.

Wait, but the question is about what the auditor should do. So, the options are what the auditor should do. So, if the client doesn't want to confirm, the auditor can't confirm it. So, the auditor's action would be to disqualify that particular account's confirmation.

Looking back at the options, option D says the auditor should explain that the request will most likely cause the disqualification. That makes sense because if the auditor can't confirm, they have no basis for an opinion, leading to disqualification.

Option A could be a response if the client is asking for confirmation, but since the client isn't, the auditor has a reason not to confirm. So, A might be a response step, not an action the auditor should take. So, the correct action is D.

But wait, the question says the client has a valid reason not to confirm. So, the auditor must take an action. Option D is about explaining the reason for disqualification, which is the correct action the auditor should take.

Other options: Option B suggests another account, which might not be necessary if the client's request is for that specific one. Option C is about management, which might not be the immediate action the auditor should take. The immediate action here is to address the lack of confirmation, leading to disqualification.

So, the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D. When an auditor has a valid reason not to confirm a specific account, the appropriate action is to explain that the request will most likely lead to disqualification. This is because the lack of confirmation means the auditor lacks the basis for an opinion, which is a critical factor in disqualifying the account. 

Answer: D
