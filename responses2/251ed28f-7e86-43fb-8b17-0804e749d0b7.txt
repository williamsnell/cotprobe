Question:

Output in country A is 1200 units and its population is 100 persons. Output in country B is 2400 units and its population is 400 persons.

Options:

A: Country A and B have identical living standards.
B: The productivity of both countries is identical.
C: Country A has a lower standard of living than country B.
D: The standard of living in both countries is above average.
E: Country B has a higher standard of living than country A.
F: Country A is less productive than country B.
G: Country A has a higher standard of living than country B.
H: Country B is less productive than country A.
I: The standard of living in both countries is below average.
J: Country A is more productive than country B.

Okay, so I've got this economics question about standard of living and productivity between two countries, A and B. Let's see how I can figure this out.

The question gives me some data: Country A has 1200 units of output and 100 people. Country B has 2400 units and 400 people. I need to compare their standards of living.

Hmm, I remember that standard of living is often measured by per capita income. So, I think I should calculate the per capita output for both countries. That would be output divided by population.

For Country A: 1200 / 100 = 12 units per person.
Country B: 2400 / 400 = 6 units per person.

Wait, so Country A has a higher per capita output. So their living standards seem better. But wait, the options aren't just about per capita. Let me read the options again.

Options: A to J. The options are about standard of living and productivity.

So, looking at the options, D says both have the same standard of living, but that doesn't seem right because A has higher. B says productivity is identical, which I don't think is the case. C says A has lower, which isn't true. E says B has higher, which isn't right either. F says A is less productive than B. Wait, productivity is output per person or total output per country?

Wait, the question is about productivity in general. So, country B's total output is higher, but population is also higher. So maybe productivity (output per person) is lower for B. But the standard of living is per capita.

Wait, the question is about the standard of living. So per capita is the key metric here. Since Country A's per capita is 12 and B's is 6, A is better off in terms of standard of living.

So looking at the options, G says A has a higher standard than B, which would be correct. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but the options also include whether the country is more or less productive. Productivity could be total output or per capita. Since the question is about standard of living, which is per capita, so perhaps the productivity aspect is about how much each person produces. So B has higher output per person, but the overall country's total output is double A's (2400 vs 1200). But per capita, A is higher. So productivity per person is lower in B. So when the question says " productivity of both countries is identical", that's probably not correct because their total outputs are different, so the productivity per person must be different.

So the options: F says A is less productive than B. That would mean A's productivity is lower. But in terms of per capita, A is higher. So productivity per person is lower in B, so F is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the standard of living, which is per capita, so the answer should be G. Because G says A has higher standard than B.

Wait, let me recheck. The options:

G: Country A has a higher standard of living than country B. Yes, because 12 >6.

So the correct answer is G.

The standard of living in Country A is higher than in Country B because Country A's per capita output (12 units) is greater than Country B's (6 units). This makes option G correct.

Answer: G
