Okay, so I've got this question about the binding energy of carbon-12, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see... The question is asking for the total binding energy and the average binding energy per nucleon for Carbon-12, which is written as ^12C. The options are from A to J, each giving two values: the total binding energy in MeV and the average per nucleon in MeV.

Wait, I remember that binding energy has to do with how tightly the nucleons (protons and neutrons) are bound together in a nucleus. The more tightly bound, the higher the binding energy. Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, making 12 nucleons in total. 

I think the standard binding energy for Carbon-12 is around 8-10 MeV per nucleon, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should recall the formula or the typical values. Oh right, the mass defect is a key part here. The mass defect is the difference between the sum of the individual nucleon masses and the actual mass of the nucleus. Once I find that, I can multiply by c² to get the binding energy.

Wait, so the formula for binding energy (BE) is BE = (mass defect) * c². And the average per nucleon would be BE divided by the number of nucleons, which is 12 in this case.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the binding energy per nucleon is approximately 8-10 MeV, but I'm not sure about the exact number. Oh, I think I remember that Carbon-12 has a binding energy per nucleon of approximately 8.17 MeV. Let me think, that's about 8.17 multiplied by 12 would give the total binding energy. So 8.17 *12 = around 98 MeV. So the total binding energy would be around 98 MeV, and the average per nucleon is 8.17 MeV.

Looking at the options, option A is 98 and 8.17. Option B is 100 and 8.33. Hmm. Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact value. Maybe I should double-check. I think the exact binding energy for Carbon-12 is about 98 MeV as a total, and the average per nucleon is around 8.17 MeV. So the options would be A: 98 and 8.17.

Wait, but let me think of another approach. Carbon-12 typically has a binding energy of about 98 MeV. So that would match option A. Oh wait, but what about the per nucleon calculation? 98 divided by 12 is about 8.17, which aligns with option A. So yeah, that should be the correct answer.

The total binding energy of Carbon-12 (^12C) is approximately 98 MeV, and the average binding energy per nucleon is about 8.17 MeV. This is consistent with the known nuclear physics values for Carbon-12. Among the given options, option A (98 MeV and 8.17 MeV) matches these values. 

Answer: A
