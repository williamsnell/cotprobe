Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm a bit new to predicate logic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is: "Kevin is introduced to José by Wilma." They've given me some options, and I need to pick the correct translation into predicate logic. The options are labeled A to I, each with different logical expressions, using Ixyz to denote that x introduced y to z.

First, let me break down the sentence. The main subjects are Kevin and José. The key here is who introduced whom. So, Wilma introduced Kevin to José.

The question is, what predicate logic statement accurately represents this situation. Let's try to map each part.

Ixyz means x introduced y to z. So, in this case, x is Wilma (w), y is Kevin (k), and z is José (j). So putting that into Ixyz, it becomes Iwjk. Because x is Wilma, y is Kevin, and z is José.

Let me check the options. Option C is Iwjk, which matches this. Let me think if any other options make sense.

Option A is Ijkw. That would mean José introduced Kevin to Wilma. But the question says Wilma introduced Kevin to José, so this doesn't fit. So A is wrong.

Option B is Iwjw. That would be Wilma introducing Wilma to Wilma, which doesn't fit the scenario.

Option D is Ijwk. That would be José introducing Kevin to Wilma. Again, not the right order.

Option E is Ikkj. That would mean Kevin introducing Kevin to José. Doesn't make sense.

Option F is Ijjk. Kevin introducing José to himself? That doesn't make sense either; it should be Kevin introduced José, not the other way around.

Option G is Iwwk. That would be Wilma introducing Wilma to José. Doesn't fit.

Option H is Ikjw. That would be José introducing Wilma to Wilma. No, that's not the case.

Option I is Iwkj. That would be Wilma introducing Kevin to José. Wait, but in the sentence, it's Kevin who's being introduced. Oh wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the roles here. Let me think again.

Wait, the sentence is "Kevin is introduced to José by Wilma." So the person (x) is Wilma, who introduced y (Kevin) to z (José). So that's correct as Iwjk.

So the correct option is C: Iwjk.

The correct translation is Iwjk, which directly corresponds to the statement "Wilma introduced Kevin to José." 

Answer: C: Iwjk
