Question:

Sociologists like Bordo (1993) have attributed the 'epidemic' of anorexia in Western cultures to:

Options:

A: the rise in stress and anxiety levels in modern society
B: a generally ascetic, frugal lifestyle that can be taken to extremes

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about why the epidemic of anorexia in Western cultures is attributed to certain factors. The options are from A to G. Let me try to think through this.

Anorexia is this condition where people eat WAY more than they should. It's a serious issue, usually diagnosed in children, but sometimes adults too. The question is asking what sociologists like Bordo (1993) attribute this to. 

I remember from my psychology classes that Bordo's work dealt a lot with social factors affecting mental health. He probably talked about how cultural values and societal pressures contribute to mental health issues.

Looking at the options:

A: Stress and anxiety. Well, some people do eat more because of stress, but it's more about chronic eating than just stress. It's a broader issue.

B: A generally ascetic, frugal lifestyle. Hmm, this could relate to eating less, but anorexia is about eating a lot. Maybe it's more about being too frugal in the way they manage their eating.

C: Fast food and obesity. While fast food is a big part of the problem, the main issue is eating too much, not just eating fast. Obesity is a symptom, not the cause.

D: Lack of awareness about healthy diet and exercise. This seems plausible. Without knowing how to eat healthy, people might eat excessively. Maybe people don't understand the importance of maintaining a balanced diet, leading them to overeat.

E: Social construction of mental illness through normal behaviors being messed with. I'm not sure about this. It might relate to how we view mental health, but I don't think it's the direct cause of eating disorders.

F: Traditional images of women as emotional, domesticated. Not sure how that relates. Maybe it's more about societal stereotypes, but anorexia is more about the body, not gender.

G: New ideal of independence and self-assured femininity with cultural values of achievement and control. This sounds like a positive idealistic approach, whereas anorexia is about eating excess. So, this might be opposite of the cause.

So, Bordo is known for his work on social factors affecting mental health. He probably discussed how societal pressures tie into mental disorders. So, if someone has anorexia, it's because they're not handling their eating habits well, often due to societal pressures about being healthy or fitting.

Alternatively, option D is about lack of awareness, which could be a contributing factor. Maybe people who are aware don't eat enough, but without awareness, it's more likely.

Wait, I think Bordo's study might have found that theism and religious beliefs, perhaps, but that's more about mental health issues. Or maybe he focused on social factors, like cultural expectations.

Another angle: Bordo's work in the 1990s might have linked social and cultural factors to mental health issues. So, factors like poverty, lack of education, or societal norms could contribute.

Option B says a generally ascetic, frugal lifestyle that can be extremes. That makes sense in a way because being frugal in eating might lead to excessive eating. But wait, Bordo's research might have more to do with societal pressures rather than individual frugality.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about what sociologists like Bordo attribute the epidemic to. So, Bordo's work, according to some sources, looked at the link between cultural values and mental health. He might have linked things like social status, materialism, and gender roles to mental health issues.

One of his theories included the idea that being too dependent on others (frugal) leads to excessive eating. But maybe he didn't emphasize that much. Alternatively, he might have focused more on how societal expectations affect mental healthâ€”like how people who are not modeling the healthy way of life tend to develop mental disorders.

Wait, I think I've read that Bordo's main issue was the lack of awareness about healthy eating. So, people not knowing how to eat healthily might overeat, leading to anorexia. That would point towards option D.

Alternatively, maybe he was more about societal pressures rather than individual frugality. So, if someone isn't aware of how to eat, they might eat more, but without the motivation or awareness, it's not the same as just social factors. Hmm.

Another thought: the term 'epidemic' in this context refers to a widespread condition, which is often linked to social desirability. So, people are more likely to eat excessively because they feel that's a sign of a good life, even if it's not true. So, this ties into the idea of psychological pressure to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

But that's more about societal pressures and psychological factors than individual factors. So, which option aligns better with Bordo's findings?

Alternatively, if I think about the options, option B is a general, ascetic style. But the epidemic isn't about being an alcoholic or someone with a particular lifestyle, but about eating excessively.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe looking at the other options.

Option G is about self-assured, independent femininity and achievement. That seems more about physical health aspects, but not directly about eating disorders.

Option D is about lack of awareness about healthy diet. If people don't know how to eat, they may eat more, leading to anorexia. So, maybe that's the main factor.

Alternatively, option B is a general lifestyle, which could include eating poorly, but it's a broader category.

Wait, I'm trying to remember. I think Bordo's work might have suggested that the cultural and social environment plays a big role. So, perhaps the lack of awareness about the importance of a healthy diet is one of the key factors.

So, putting it together, the best answer would be D: the lack of awareness about healthy diet and exercise.

The question asks which factor sociologists like Bordo (1993) attribute to the 'epidemic' of anorexia in Western cultures. The analysis of the options reveals that Bordo's work focused on the interplay between cultural values, societal pressures, and individual behaviors. 

Option B refers to a general, ascetic lifestyle, which could relate to eating habits but doesn't encapsulate the specific issue of excessive eating. Option C discusses fast food and obesity, which are symptoms rather than the cause. Option D highlights the lack of awareness about healthy diet and exercise, a key factor in why individuals might overeat, leading to anorexia. This aligns with Bordo's emphasis on psychological and societal factors influencing mental health, particularly in the context of diet and exercise.
