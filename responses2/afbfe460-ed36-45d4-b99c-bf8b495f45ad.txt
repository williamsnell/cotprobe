Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the coding sequences of genes. Hmm, I remember that genes have different parts, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terms. Let's break it down.

The question is asking what's called when the coding sequences are. The options are A to J, with each being different biological terms. I think the key here is to remember what each part of a gene's sequence is called.

Wait, genes are made up of DNA, and they have a coding region. The coding region is where the protein is made. I remember that in DNA, genes are often transcribed into mRNA. Oh right, the mRNA has a coding region which is the part where the sequence is used to code for proteins. 

So in the DNA, the coding sequence is called an intron, right? Because introns are non-coding regions within the gene. But wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm confusing something here. Oh, wait, the question is about the coding sequences of genes. So the coding sequences would be the part in the mRNA. Because the DNA's coding regions are the exons, I think. Or wait, no. Wait, the mRNA has introns and exons. The exons are the parts that are coding for proteins, and introns are non-coding, like for splicing.

So the coding sequences of genes are the exons in the mRNA. Because the exons are the regions where the mRNA has the actual amino acids that make the protein. So looking at the options, option I says exons, which probably is the correct answer.

Let me check the options again. Option I is exons. So the correct answer should be I.

Wait, another thought: sometimes people get confused between exons and introns. Exons are the parts of the mRNA that code for proteins, while introns are the non-coding parts. So the coding sequences would be the exons. So yes, option I is correct.

The coding sequences of genes are called exons. Exons are the regions of the mRNA where the amino acids of the protein are located, which are derived from the DNA's coding sequences. The correct answer is I: exons.

Answer: I
