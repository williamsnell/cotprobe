Question:

Consider the trial on which a 3 is first observed in successive rolls of a six-sided die. Let $A$ be the event that 3 is observed on the first trial. Let $B$ be the event that at least two trials are required to observe a 3 . Assuming that each side has probability $1 / 6$, find (a) $P(A)$.


Options:

A: $\frac{3}{6}$
B: $\frac{1}{3}$
C: $\frac{1}{12}$
D: $\frac{4}{6}$
E: $\frac{2}{6}$
F: $\frac{1}{6}$
G: $\frac{1}{2}$
H: $\frac{1}{36}$
I: $\frac{5}{36}$
J: $\frac{5}{6}$

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this probability problem. Let me read it again.

The question is about the probability that a 3 is first observed on the first trial when rolling a six-sided die. The events are defined as: event A is that a 3 is observed on the first trial, and event B is that at least two trials are required to observe a 3. Each side has a probability of 1/6.

Wait, but the question specifically asks for P(A), so I don't need to worry about P(B) right now. Let me think about what P(A) means. Event A is the event that the first roll is a 3. So, since each side has an equal probability of 1/6, the probability of rolling a 3 on the first try is just 1/6. That seems straightforward.

But I should make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says it's about successive rolls, but for event A, we're only looking at the first roll. So yeah, it's just the probability of rolling a 3 on the first trial, which is 1/6.

Looking at the options, let me check each one. Option F is 1/6, so that must be the answer. The other options are fractions greater than 1/6, like 4/6 (which simplifies to 2/3), 5/6, etc. But since the first roll only needs to be a 3, the probability can't be higher than 1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. If we're rolling a die, each face is equally likely. So the chance of rolling a 3 is 1 out of 6. So yes, P(A) is 1/6. The other events, like B, are about needing more than one trial, but that's not required for this question. So P(A) is definitely 1/6.

So the correct answer should be option F.

The probability of rolling a 3 on the first trial is 1/6, as there are six equally likely outcomes. 

Answer: F
