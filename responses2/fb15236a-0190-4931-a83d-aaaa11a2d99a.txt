Question:

What are the difficulties in the classification of tissuesof higherplants?

Options:

A: Plant tissues can be fully characterized based on their evolutionary heritage
B: Plant tissues are distinguished only by their cellular composition without considering their function
C: All plant tissues are meristematic and capable of continuous division
D: Plant tissues can be classified with ease as they do not exhibit any plasticity or change in response to environmental conditions
E: Plant tissues are identical in angiosperms and gymnosperms, making classification simple
F: The classification of plant tissues is uncomplicated due to the uniformity of cells within a given tissue type
G: Plant tissues cannot be fully characterized or distinguished on the basis of any one single factor such as location, function, structure or evolutionary heritage. Some permanent tissues may change to meristematic activity under certain conditions.
H: Plant tissues can be classified solely on the basis of the type of cell wall they possess
I: Plant tissues can be easily distinguished based on their location and function
J: All plant tissues remain constant throughout their life cycle

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about the difficulties in classifying plant tissues. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about the challenges in classifying plant tissues. I remember that plant tissues are made up of many types, but they have similarities and differences. Classifying them accurately must be tricky because each tissue type has distinct features. 

Looking at the options, I need to pick the one that correctly identifies these difficulties. Let's go through each option.

Option A says that plant tissues can be fully characterized based on their evolutionary heritage. Wait, I think that's not true. Evolutionary heritage helps with some traits, but distinguishing all tissues is hard because they vary a lot. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B suggests that plant tissues are only distinguished by their cellular composition without considering function. That doesn't sound right either. Function matters because tissues have different roles in the body, like roots for support or photosynthesis. So B is probably wrong too.

Option C claims all plant tissues are meristematic and can continuously divide. Meristematic tissues are those that can grow without a net, like leaves and stems. But not all plant tissues are meristematic. For example, some tissues are multinuclear, like the fruiting bodies of dicots. So C is incorrect.

Option D claims plant tissues can be classified easily because they don't change much. That's the opposite of what I know. Tissues do change, especially under stress. So D is probably not right.

Option E says tissues are identical in angiosperms and gymnosperms, making classification simple. No, that's not true. Different tissues exist in different plant families. Tissue types vary a lot between angiosperms and gymnosperms. So E is incorrect.

Option F says classification is easy because of uniform cell types. That can't be right. Cells vary a lot within tissues, and different tissues have different compositions. So F is wrong.

Option G states that plant tissues can't be characterized on one factor. They depend on multiple factors like location, function, structure, etc. So G is correct because each tissue is a complex entity with multiple attributes.

Option H says they can be classified based on the cell wall. Some do, but not all. For example, the cell wall varies between different tissues, but not all tissues have the same type. So H isn't the best answer.

Option I says tissues can easily be distinguished by location and function. That's true for some cases, but not all. For example, tissues like the skin and the lining of the digestive tract are similar, so their classification might not be easy based solely on function or location. So I isn't the best choice.

Option J says all tissues remain constant. Definitely false; they change a lot, especially under stress. So J is incorrect.

So the only correct option is G. The classification of plant tissues is based on multiple factors, so it can't be done with one factor alone. Some tissues are meristematic, but not all, and classification isn't straightforward.

The correct answer is:

**G: Plant tissues cannot be fully characterized or distinguished on the basis of any one single factor such as location, function, structure, or evolutionary heritage. Some permanent tissues may change to meristematic activity under certain conditions.**

**Explanation:**
The question asks about the difficulties in classifying plant tissues. Out of the options, only option G accurately reflects the reality. Plant tissues vary significantly, often depending on multiple factors like location, function, and structure. While some tissues are meristematic and capable of continuous growth, this does not mean their classification can be solely based on a single factor. The complexity arises from the interplay of various attributes, making it challenging to categorize tissues accurately.
