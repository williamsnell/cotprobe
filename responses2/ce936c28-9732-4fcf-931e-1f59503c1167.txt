Question:

A 44-year-old woman with a 10-year history of arthritis comes to the office because she has had increasing pain and stiffness in her hands, wrists, and knees during the past several months. She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month, along with a weight loss of 1.8 to 2.2 kg (4 to 5 lb). She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, "I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months." She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her "drop attacks?"

Options:

A: Side effect of the copper bracelets
B: Spinal stenosis
C: Reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen
D: Cardiac arrhythmia
E: Anxiety
F: Neurological side effects of rheumatoid arthritis
G: Transient ischemic attack
H: Adrenal insufficiency
I: Hypoglycemia
J: Atlanto-axial instability

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the cause of her drop attacks. Let me go through the information given step by step.

She's a 44-year-old woman with arthritis, and she has a history of pain, stiffness, fatigue, and weight loss. She's seen several doctors before and tried various treatments, including copper bracelets. The initial diagnosis is rheumatoid arthritis, so that part seems solid.

Her attacks are drop attacks, which are episodes of weakness and loss of sensation in her legs, lasting a few minutes. One of these attacks led to her incontinent. She's taking aspirin and ibuprofen. The exam shows swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal joints, bilaterally, and some ulnar deviation. Other exam findings are normal.

So, what could cause a drop attack in someone with arthritis? I remember that sometimes, especially with certain treatments, there can be side effects. She's had bracelets given to her by friends. Copper bracelets are sometimes used for managing rheumatoid arthritis, but do they cause drop attacks? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a side effect, but I'm not sure if it's the most likely here.

Her other symptoms include weight loss, which could be related to the disease. Lower body weight is a common symptom of arthritis. The presence of ulnar deviation—so fingers are bent more than they should be—could be a sign of conditions like osteoarthritis or another joint issue. But how does that connect to drop attacks?

Another possibility is the use of aspirin and ibuprofen. These are common pain medications. They could be causing the attacks because of the side effects. I've heard that aspirin can cause stomach pain, which might contribute to drop attacks. Similarly, ibuprofen can cause side effects like myalgic encephalomyelitis or neurological symptoms, which might include drop attacks.

Looking at the options, option F is neurological side effects of rheumatoid arthritis. That seems to fit because the attacks are described as a neurological issue. Drops attacks could be a result of the joint inflammation and the medications she's taking.

Option B, spinal stenosis, is another possibility. Spinal issues can cause pain, but the question mentions her symptoms are in the lower extremities, so that's less likely here.

Option D, cardiac arrhythmia, doesn't seem to fit. She's not having chest pain or a heart attack, and the exam didn't show any arrhythmia-like symptoms.

Option E, anxiety, is possible but she's had drop attacks, which can be pretty serious, but anxiety alone isn't the main cause.

Option J, transients ischemia, which is a type of attack where there's a brief stroke of ischemia. That's a possibility, but she has ulnar deviation, which could be related to another issue, not necessarily ischemia.

Option A, side effect of copper bracelets, is a possibility but is it the most likely? I'm not entirely certain. She's taking those bracelets, but whether they are causing the attacks, not sure.

Option C is reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen. That's a possibility, as I thought earlier. She's been taking those, so maybe her attacks are due to side effects of the medications.

Option H, adrenal insufficiency, is another possibility. Adrenaline levels can drop, causing muscle weakness, but I don't know if that's related to drop attacks specifically. It's a possible cause but not the most direct.

Option I, hypoglycemia, is not mentioned. She's taking aspirin and ibuprofen, which are blood-boosting, but hypoglycemia isn't directly linked to her symptoms here.

So, putting it together, the most likely cause is either a side effect of the medications or a neurological issue.

Wait, the option F is about neurological side effects. So she's taking pain medications, which can cause side effects. Her attacks are a result of the medication's side effects, like the stomach pain. So F seems correct.

Alternatively, option C is about reaction to the drugs. So which is more likely the answer?

Hmm. Another thought: Drop attacks are sometimes considered a result of a chronic inflammatory response, which could be related to rheumatoid arthritis. So the primary cause might be her own arthritis, but her medications are contributing to the attack.

But the question is which of the listed options is the most likely. So F is neurological side effects, which would explain the attacks. Alternatively, C is reaction to the drugs.

Wait, the question says "the most likely cause of her drop attacks". So, her current medications are the culprit. She's taking aspirin and ibuprofen, which are known to have side effects.

So, the answer could be C or F.

But which is more likely?

I think in this case, the answer would be C: Reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen. Because these are medications that can have side effects which are often considered 'neurological' in nature. They can cause migraines, which are similar to drop attacks, but not exactly the same.

Alternatively, her reaction to the pain medications might lead to her experiencing drop attacks.

Wait, another point: She has a history of pain, so the drop attacks could be a reaction to her current medications. So, she might have had a fall or some trigger that made her take these medications, leading to her attacks.

Alternatively, it's a common reaction to medications, causing mild attacks like this.

So, the answer could be C.

But I'm a bit torn between C and F.

Alternatively, maybe she's experiencing a reaction to the medications, leading to her attacks. So C.

But another point is that her metacarpophalangeal joints are swollen. This might be due to her arthritis, but if this is a reaction to the drugs, perhaps it's a different issue.

Wait, but the question is about the cause of her drop attacks, not the underlying arthritis. So her current medications are causing the attacks, so F would be the answer.

But then why wouldn't it be C?

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of the possible causes again. Drop attacks are often associated with chronic inflammation and pain. The medications she's taking can cause various side effects.

Another thing to consider: she has a history of pain, and the attacks are her own. So the attacks could be due to her own condition, but the question is which option is the most likely.

The options are: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

So, looking at the options, F is about the side effects of her medications, which could include things like stomach pain. Drop attacks could be a result of side effects like that.

But another possibility is that she's reacting to the pain medications. For example, taking painkillers may cause her to feel more sensitive, leading to the attacks.

So which is more likely? I'm not sure. But in the context of the options, F is a possible answer.

Wait, but the question says, "the most likely cause of her drop attacks?" So which of these options fits the scenario.

If she has a history of pain, her attacks could be her body's response, which could be due to her own condition. But the options don't include a 'her own condition' option; they're all specific statements.

So, perhaps the answer is C: Reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen.

Alternatively, F is a possible answer as well.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused. Let me think of other clues.

The patient has a history of pain, so her body has to manage that. Drop attacks are often a result of chronic inflammation, which she's dealing with. So the medications may be contributing to that.

But the question is, which of the options is the cause of the attacks.

So, if she's taking painkillers, their side effects might cause the attacks. So C.

Alternatively, the attacks could be her本身的 condition, but the question is about the cause in relation to her medications.

I think the answer is C: Reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen.

But wait, another point: the attacks are episodes of weakness. Could that be a side effect of her painkillers, like aspirin causing stomach pain?

Alternatively, the reaction to the pain medications could be related to her current state, leading to these attacks.

So, this is a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F because her pain is contributing to her condition, and the attacks are her body's reflexive response.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I'll think about the options again. The question is about the cause of her drop attacks. So, the options are:

A) Copper bracelets: Maybe, but not the main cause.

B) Spinal stenosis: Not likely.

C) Reaction to Aspirin or Ibuprofen: Possible.

D) Cardiac arrhythmia: Doesn't fit.

E) Anxiety: Unlikely.

F) Neurological side effects: Yes, because her attacks are symptoms of her disease.

G) TIA: Could occur, but not directly related.

H) Adrenal. Unlikely.

I) Hypoglycemia: Not part of the scenario.

J) Atlanto-axial instability: Unlikely.

So, between F and C.

The question is, which is the most likely cause. So, if the attacks are due to her taking painkillers, then C makes sense.

But some painkillers can cause side effects. So, the attacks are likely a side effect.

Alternatively, her current pain is contributing to her drop attacks.

Hmm.

In my experience, I've heard that during the use of painkillers, especially NSAIDs, there can be reports of transient mild attacks like drop attacks, possibly due to the medications' side effects. So, maybe C is the answer.

But in this case, the patient's symptoms are due to her own arthritis and her medications, not her own condition. So, perhaps the cause is her reaction to the medications.

Wait, another thought: She's been taking copper bracelets and this is one of her initial treatments. Copper bracelets can cause various side effects, including dizziness, drowsiness, and in some cases, reflexes. But this doesn't directly cause drop attacks.

So, the main side effect is likely from the medications, so C.

Alternatively, she's been told about the copper bracelets, but the attacks are due to her medications. So, the answer would be C.

But wait, another thing: in some cases, the drop attacks are considered a reaction to pain medications, leading to more severe symptoms. So, C could be the answer.

So, given all that, I think the answer is C: Reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen.

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) history, presenting with drop attacks characterized by episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs, which became incontinent. She has been prescribed copper bracelets, and her medical history confirms the diagnosis of RA. The exam findings include swollen metacarpophalangeal joints and bilaterally, with moderate ulnar deviation. The question asks for the most likely cause of her drop attacks.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **A: Side effect of the copper bracelets**  
   Copper bracelets are known to cause side effects, such as dizziness or drowsiness, but they are not directly linked to the cause of drop attacks.

2. **B: Spinal stenosis**  
   Spinal stenosis involves abnormal narrowing of the spinal column, which is unrelated to the described symptoms of drop attacks.

3. **C: Reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen**  
   Aspirin and ibuprofen are commonly used pain medications. Their side effects, such as stomach pain or reflexes, could contribute to the episodes of weakness described. Drop attacks are a known reaction to pain medications, making this a plausible explanation.

4. **D: Cardiac arrhythmia**  
   There is no evidence of chest pain or arrhythmia-like symptoms.

5. **E: Anxiety**  
   While anxiety can cause drop attacks, there is no indication of this in the patient's case.

6. **F: Neurological side effects of rheumatoid arthritis**  
   Drop attacks are a neurological response to RA, but the question seeks the most likely cause in relation to her medications. While this is a valid possibility, it is less direct compared to the reaction to painkillers.

7. **G: Transient ischemic attack**  
   Transient ischemic attacks involve tissue damage and are unrelated to the described symptoms.

8. **H: Adrenal insufficiency**  
   There is no evidence of high blood sugar levels or acute stress response.

9. **I: Hypoglycemia**  
   No evidence of hypoglycemia is mentioned.

10. **J: Atlanto-axial instability**  
    Unlikely, as it does not explain the described clinical presentation.

### Conclusion:
The most likely cause of the drop attacks is the reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen, as these medications can cause side effects leading to symptoms like drop attacks.
