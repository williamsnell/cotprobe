Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the folk saying "opposites attract." The user is asking how current research challenges this idea. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the basic saying is like, if two things are different, they like each other. But I think research shows that this isn't always true. Maybe it's because people have different preferences and preferences often don't complement each other.

Looking at the options, the key point is whether opposites attract applies to certain groups. The options are about which groups it applies to. I'm trying to recall what I've read. Oh right, opposites attract is often cited in relationships, but modern research suggests that real opposites don't usually like each other.

Wait, so the saying is about people who are different in some way. Like, if you're with someone who's different in personality or interests, you might like them. But does that hold true universally? Or does it depend on the context and individual differences?

I think the answer is that opposites attract isn't always true. So, which option reflects that? Let's look at the options again.

Option A: True for heterosexuals but not for homosexuals. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. I remember reading that in some cases, people from different sexual orientations do like each other, but most of the time, opposites attract doesn't apply.

Option B: True for men but not for women. That seems possible but I'm not certain. I think the statement might not hold for both genders.

Option C: True for homosexuals but not for heterosexuals. That sounds familiar. I think homos attract homos, but the saying is more about differing types. So if homos attract, then the statement might be true for homos but not for heterosexuals.

Wait, but the question is about the general applicability. So the saying is "opposites attract," which is a general statement. But current research might suggest that it's not always the case. So perhaps when considering the saying as a general principle, it's not always true, but when it applies, it's to certain groups.

Wait, no, I think the question is about how the saying is perceived in light of current research. So current research may show that opposites don't attract as much as the saying suggests, but the saying is still a common expression. So the question is, does the saying hold true or not when considering research? Because the options are about whether it's true or not.

Wait, the question is asking what seems to be the case when the saying is considered in light of current research. So, the saying as a general rule is being questioned by research, which suggests it's not always true.

So looking for the option that says opposites don't attract as much as the saying suggests. Let me check the options again. 

Option C: True for homosexuals but not for heterosexuals. So if the saying is that opposites attract, but research shows it's not always the case, then for homos, opposites attract, but for heterosexuals, it might not. So C says it's true for homos but not for heterosexuals. That seems to fit because, while the saying holds for homos, it's not universally true for all people.

Alternatively, option B says opposites attract for men but not women. But the saying isn't gender-specific; it's more about differing types. So the saying would apply to any two people who are different in some way. So it's not that men attract each other, but that men who are different from women would attract. So option B might not be correct.

Option C talks about homos. So homos do attract homos, but the saying doesn't say they attract any group. So if opposites attract only applies to certain groups, then C is correct. 

Wait, but looking again, I recall that opposites attract isn't a universal rule. So the saying is true for certain situations, but not all. So, the answer should be that it's not always true. 

Looking at the options, option C suggests it's true for homos but not for heterosexuals. That would make sense if homos attract homos, but heterosexuals don't attract each other in the same way. So the saying would hold for homos (opposites attract homos), but not for heterosexuals (opposites don't attract each other). So option C would indicate that opposites attract for homos, which is a group, but not for heterosexuals (another group). So the saying is applicable to certain groups, not all. 

Alternatively, option G says it doesn't seem to be true. But I think that's not the case because opposites attract is a valid saying. So G is probably incorrect.

Another angle: Research suggests that when people are of different types (like one is introverted, the other is extroverted), they tend to like each other. But when they're the same type, they don't. So the saying is more about differing types. So in groups of same type, opposites don't attract. So opposites attract is true for certain groups but not others. So the answer would be C.

The question explores whether the folk saying "opposites attract" holds true when considering current research. Research suggests that opposites don't always attract, especially when individuals share the same type. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C** states that opposites attract for homos but not for heterosexuals. This aligns with the idea that homos attract homos, while same-type individuals (like heterosexuals) don't attract each other.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as it reflects that opposites attract is true for homos but not for heterosexuals, aligning with current research.

Answer: C
