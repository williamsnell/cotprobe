Alright, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these topics. Let me try to think it through step by step. 

Okay, the question is about a dynamo powered by a steam engine. It uses 1000 kg of coal per day, and it produces a current of 200 Amperes with a voltage of 240 Volts. The calorific value of the coal is given as 6.6 × 10^3 cal/g^-1. I need to find the efficiency of the system. The options are from A to J, each with a different percentage.

Wait, efficiency... So, efficiency is the ratio of useful work output to the total energy input. Right. So I think I need to calculate both the electrical energy produced by the dynamo and the energy from the coal, then find the ratio.

First, let's figure out the energy produced by the dynamo. The dynamo produces a current (I) and voltage (V), so the power (P) is I * V. Oh wait, power is in watts, which is Joules per second. But here, I'm dealing with a daily usage, so I'll need to convert that to energy over a day.

Wait, the dynamo runs, using coal. So the energy from the coal is the calorific value times the mass. Calculating that might give me the energy input.

Let me jot down the important numbers:

- Mass of coal used per day: 1000 kg (which is 10^3 kg)
- Current (I) = 200 A
- Voltage (V) = 240 V
- Calorific value (Cv) = 6.6 × 10^3 cal/g → I need to convert that to J per kg because the energy from the dynamo will be in joules.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure I'm using the right units. The calorific value is given in cal per gram, so I should convert it to joules per kilogram because the mass is in kilograms.

First, convert the calorific value from cal/g to J/kg. Let's see, 1 cal is approximately 4.184 J. So 6.6e3 cal/g would be 6.6e3 * 4.184 J/g. Wait, 6.6 × 10^3 cal/g → 6.6e3 cal/g. Multiply by 4.184 J/cal to get J/g, then multiply by 1000 g/kg → J/kg.

So 6.6e3 cal/g * 4.184 J/cal = (6.6e3 * 4.184) J/g. Let me calculate that:

6.6e3 * 4.184 = 6600 *4.184. Let me compute 6600 *4 = 26400, 6600 *0.184= 6600 *0.1=660, 6600*0.084=554.4 → so 660 +554.4=1214.4. So total is 26400 +1214.4= 27614.4 J/g. Then multiply by 1000 (kg) → 27,614,400 J/kg.

Wait, that's a lot. So per kilogram of coal, the energy is 27,614,400 J. So 1000 kg would be 1000 * 27,614,400 = 27,614,400,000 J? Wait, that's 2.76e10 J per day? That seems really high. Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, no, wait a second. The dynamo is producing current and voltage, so it's generating electrical energy, which goes into the calorific value? Hmm, maybe that's the wrong approach. Alternatively, perhaps the system is a dynamo that converts the chemical energy of the coal into electrical energy, which then powers the current, and the efficiency is the energy from the dynamo (electrical) divided by the energy from the coal (chemical).

So the process is: coal → electrical energy (from the dynamo) → current. So the energy from the dynamo is the electrical energy, which is the energy from the coal (chemical) minus the work done by the dynamo.

Wait, perhaps the more accurate approach is to compute the energy from the dynamo and compare it to the energy from the coal.

Wait, the dynamo produces electrical current, so the energy goes into work. The energy from the coal is the chemical energy, which is the calorific value times the mass. So the efficiency is the electrical energy (output) divided by the chemical energy (input).

So first, calculate the electrical energy output.

Electrical energy (E_electrical) = I * V * t.

But wait, I have the current and voltage, but the time is one day. So I need to compute for a day.

Wait, t is 24 hours, which is 24 * 3600 seconds.

So t = 24 * 3600 = 86400 seconds.

So E_electrical = I * V * t = 200 A * 240 V * 86400 s.

Let me compute that step by step.

200 * 240 is 48,000. 48,000 * 86400 s.

Wait, 48,000 * 86400 = 48,000 * 8.64e4 = let's compute that:

48,000 *8.64e4 = (4.8e4) * (8.64e4) = 4.8 *8.64 = 41.472 → 41.472e8 J → that's 4.1472e9 J, or approximately 4.147e9 joules per day.

So the dynamo produces about 4.147e9 joules per day.

Now, the energy from the coal is the calorific value multiplied by the mass.

Wait, the mass is 1000 kg. Wait, the calorific value is given as 6.6e3 cal/g. So per kg, that's 6.6e3 cal/g * 1000 g/kg = 6.6e6 cal/kg.

Wait, no, wait: 6.6e3 cal/g * 1000 g/kg = 6.6e6 cal/kg? Wait, no, wait, 6.6e3 cal/g is (6.6e3 cal)/(1g). So for 1 kg, which is 1000 g, the energy is 6.6e3 * 1000 cal → 6.6e6 cal/kg.

So energy from coal is 6.6e6 cal/kg * mass in kg.

Mass is 1000 kg. So 6.6e6 cal/kg * 1000 kg = 6.6e9 cal.

Wait, because 1000 kg is 1e3 kg, so 6.6e6 * 1e3 = 6.6e9 cal.

Wait, but wait, the system produces current I = 200 A and emf V=240V. So the power is 200 *240 =48000 W or 48 kW.

But, the question is about efficiency, so the energy from the dynamo (electrical) divided by the energy from the coal (chemical).

Wait, no, wait. The dynamo converts the chemical energy of the coal into electrical energy, which is then used to produce the current. So the energy from the dynamo is the electrical energy, which is 4.147e9 J. The energy from the coal is 6.6e9 cal. So efficiency is (electrical energy) / (chemical energy) × 100%.

Wait, but wait, the dynamo's electrical energy is the work done. So the energy from the dynamo is 4.147e9 J, and the energy from the coal is 6.6e9 cal. But what's the correct units for the efficiency?

Wait, no: the efficiency is (electrical energy produced) / (chemical energy used as input). So the formula is η = (E_electrical) / (E_chemical) × 100%.

So E_electrical is 4.147e9 J, E_chemical is 6.6e9 cal.

Wait, but cal and J are different units. So I need to convert them into the same unit. Let's convert both to joules.

1 cal = 4.184 J. So E_chemical in J is 6.6e9 *4.184 J.

Wait, 6.6e9 cal * 4.184 J/cal = (6.6 *4.184) * 1e9 J.

6.6 * 4.184 → let's calculate that.

4.184 *6 = 25.104, 4.184 *0.6= 2.5104 → total 27.6144.

So E_chemical is 27.6144e9 J → 2.76144e10 J.

So E_electrical is 4.147e9 J.

So efficiency η = (4.147e9 / 2.76144e10) × 100%.

Let me compute that.

4.147e9 / 2.76144e10 = 4.147 / 27.6144 ≈ Let's compute 4.147 / 27.6144.

Hmm, 27.6144 is about 27.6144.

Divide 4.147 by 27.6144: 4.147 / 27.6144 ≈ 0.150.

Wait, 27.6144 * 0.15 → 4.14216. Which is close to 4.147. So, 0.150 approximately. So about 15%.

Wait, wait, let me compute more accurately.

Let me compute 4.147 ÷ 27.6144.

Let me do 4.147 ÷ 27.6144.

Well, 27.6144 × 0.15 = 4.14216 → which is about 4.14216, which is very close to 4.147.

The difference is 4.147 - 4.14216 = 0.00484.

So, how much more is needed? 0.00484 / 27.6144 ≈ 0.000176.

So the total is 0.15 + 0.000176 → 0.150176, approximately 0.1502, which is about 15.02%.

Looking at the options, option A is 15%, so that's the answer.

To determine the efficiency of the dynamo system, we calculate the ratio of the electrical energy output to the energy input from the coal. The efficiency formula is:

\[
\eta = \frac{E_{\text{electrical}}}{E_{\text{chemical}}} \times 100\%
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the electrical energy output
The dynamo produces a current \( I = 200 \, \text{A} \) and a voltage \( V = 240 \, \text{V} \). The power \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = I \cdot V = 200 \cdot 240 = 48,000 \, \text{W} = 48 \, \text{kW}.
\]

The energy output over one day (\( t = 24 \, \text{hours} = 86,400 \, \text{seconds} \)) is:

\[
E_{\text{electrical}} = P \cdot t = 48,000 \cdot 86,400 = 4.147 \times 10^9 \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the energy input from the coal
The calorific value of coal is \( 6.6 \times 10^3 \, \text{cal/g} \). Converting this to joules:

\[
1 \, \text{cal} = 4.184 \, \text{J}, \quad 6.6 \times 10^3 \, \text{cal/g} = 6.6 \times 10^3 \cdot 4.184 = 27,614,400 \, \text{J/kg}.
\]

The mass of coal used per day is \( 1000 \, \text{kg} \). Thus, the energy input from the coal is:

\[
E_{\text{chemical}} = 27,614,400 \cdot 1000 = 2.76144 \times 10^{10} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate efficiency
Substitute the values into the efficiency formula:

\[
\eta = \frac{4.147 \times 10^9}{2.76144 \times 10^{10}} \times 100\% = 0.1502 \times 100\% = 15.02\%.
\]

### Final Answer
The efficiency of the system is approximately **15%**, which corresponds to option **A**.
