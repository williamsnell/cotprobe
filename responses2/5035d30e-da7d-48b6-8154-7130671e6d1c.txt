Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem about calculating the change in enthalpy when two copper blocks are placed in contact. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that two blocks of copper, each 10 kg, are at 100°C and 0°C, respectively. They're in an isolated container, so no heat is lost to the surroundings. I need to find the change in enthalpy, ΔH.

Wait, wait. Oh wait, wait. Enthalpy change for a reaction? Or for the transfer of heat? Because when two substances exchange heat, the total enthalpy changes. So I'm probably dealing with a heat transfer scenario here.

So the setup is: one block is hot (100°C), the other is cooler (0°C). Since they're both copper, their specific heat capacities are the same. Heat will flow from the hotter to the cooler, right? So the copper at higher temperature will lose heat, and the cooler one will gain it.

But wait, the problem is about ΔH. Oh, wait, wait. Wait, enthalpy change for the system or the surroundings? Because when you have a heat transfer process, the system's enthalpy change is equal to the heat gained by the surroundings (or vice versa). But I'm a bit confused here because I recall that for enthalpy, ΔH is the heat change at constant pressure. But in this case, it's a heat transfer between two substances, so perhaps the overall change is the heat lost by the hotter block equals the heat gained by the cooler.

But wait, the question is about ΔH. Let me re-read the question: calculate ΔH. So probably, it's referring to the heat transfer for one of the blocks. Or maybe the change in enthalpy for the entire process. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "the change in enthalpy". So, when two blocks are placed in contact, heat is transferred until they reach equilibrium. The total heat lost by the hotter block is equal to the heat gained by the cooler. But the question is about the change in enthalpy for each block. Or perhaps the total change in the system as a whole.

Wait, but the system here is the two blocks. So the total ΔH would be the sum of their individual changes. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the heat transfer for each block, but in this case, the problem is asking for the change in the system (the two blocks), which is the total heat transfer.

Wait, but the problem specifically says "calculate ΔH when two copper blocks... are placed in contact...". So perhaps it's the total heat change. Because each block's ΔH would be the heat they lose or gain.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the enthalpy change of the entire process, which is the same as the heat exchange.

But let's think: for each block, the heat lost or gained is the heat transfer. So the total change in system's enthalpy is the sum of the two individual changes.

Wait, but wait. For a substance, the change in enthalpy is ΔH = m * c * ΔT. Since both have the same c, I can compute each's ΔH.

Wait, but in this case, each block's ΔH would be the heat they lose or gain. So, the total heat lost by the hot block equals the heat gained by the cold block. But the problem is asking for ΔH, which is the change in enthalpy. So perhaps it's the total change for the system as a whole. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the heat transfer between the two blocks, which is the same as the total enthalpy change of the system.

Wait, but each block's change is in the opposite direction. Let me calculate the heat each block transfers.

So, first, let me get the mass of each block. They are both 10 kg. So m for each is 10 kg.

The specific heat capacity (c) is given as 0.385 J/(K·g). Wait, but units! Because for specific heat capacity, it's usually given as J/(g·K). Oh wait, no, the problem says 0.385 J K⁻¹ g⁻¹. So that's 0.385 J/(g·K). So for each block, the heat change is m * c * ΔT, but the sign changes depending on the temperature change.

Wait, for the hot block (100°C), it's losing heat. So ΔT = T_hot_final - T_hot_initial. But since the final temperature is the same for both, let's call it T_final.

So for the hot block: ΔH (heat lost) = m * c * (T_hot_initial - T_final). Similarly, for the cold block: ΔH (heat gained) = m * c * (T_final - T_cold_initial).

But the problem is, without knowing the final temperature, I can't compute the exact heat. Wait, but wait, since the container is isolated, the heat lost by the hot block equals the heat gained by the cold. So:

m_hot * c * (T_hot_initial - T_final) = m_cold * c * (T_final - T_cold_initial)

But m_hot and m_cold are both 10 kg. So (10 kg) * c * (100 - T) = (10 kg) * c * (T - 0)

The c and 10 kg terms cancel out on both sides, so:

100 - T = T - 0 → 100 = 2T → T = 50°C.

Ah, so the final temperature is 50°C.

Now, the heat lost by the hot block is:

Q = m * c * (T_initial - T_final) → 10 kg * 0.385 J/(g·K) * (100 - 50) °C.

Wait, but J/(g·K) is the same as J/(kg·K) because 1 kg is 1000 g. So 0.385 J/(g·K) is 0.385 * 1000 J/(kg·K) → 385 J/(kg·K).

So Q for hot block is 10 kg * 385 J/(kg·K) * (50 K) → 10 * 385 * 50 = 192500 J? Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 10 kg is 10000 grams. So specific heat is 0.385 J/(g·K). So m*c would be 10 kg * 0.385 J/(g·K) = 10 * 1000 g * 0.385 J/(g·K) → 10,000 g * 0.385 J/(g·K) = 3850 J/K.

So, m*c = 3850 J/K.

Q = m*c*(ΔT) → m is 10 kg, ΔT is 50 K (since 100 →50, ΔT is 50 K).

So Q = 10 * 3850 J/K * 50 K? Wait, 10 * 3850 is 38500, then *50 is 1,925,000 J. That's 1.925e6 J. Which is 1925 kJ. That's a lot, but possible.

But wait, wait. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, the specific heat is given as 0.385 J/K·g. So, 0.385 J/(g·K). So for 10 kg, which is 10,000 g, the m*c would be 10,000 g * 0.385 J/(g·K) = 3850 J/K. So that's correct.

So the heat lost is m*c*(T_initial - T_final) = 3850 J/K * (100 - 50) = 3850 * 50 = 192500 J → 192.5 kJ.

That's a lot, but perhaps that's correct.

But the question is about ΔH. Wait, what is ΔH? Enthalpy change is the heat at constant pressure. So when the system is at constant pressure, the heat change is ΔH. But in this case, the process is a heat transfer, but is the process at constant pressure? Well, the problem doesn't state that the process is at constant pressure, so I'm not sure. Wait, but the question says the data refer to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated. So perhaps the process occurs at constant pressure, as in a bomb calorimeter.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The problem is about the change in enthalpy (ΔH) when the two blocks are placed in contact. So each block undergoes a change in temperature. The total change in enthalpy would be the sum of each block's ΔH.

So for each block, the heat lost or gained is the ΔH. Since the container is isolated, the total heat lost by the hot block is equal to the heat gained by the cold block. So each block's ΔH is the heat they lose or gain.

Wait, but wait. For the hot block, it's losing heat, so its ΔH would be negative. For the cold block, it's gaining heat, so ΔH is positive.

So ΔH for the hot block is -q, and for the cold block is +q.

But the question is about ΔH when the two blocks are placed in contact. So the total ΔH would be q for the cold block (since it's gaining heat) minus q for the hot block (since it's losing heat). So ΔH_total = q_cold - q_hot.

But wait, no. Because q is the heat change for each block. The problem is asking for the change in enthalpy, which is the heat transfer for each block.

So each block's ΔH is the heat they lose or gain. So in this case, the hot block loses 192.5 kJ, so ΔH for it is -192.5 kJ. The cold block gains 192.5 kJ, so ΔH is +192.5 kJ. The total ΔH for the system would be the sum, which is 0.

Wait, but that's because the heat lost by the hot is gained by the cold. So the system (the two blocks) undergoes no net change in enthalpy. The total ΔH for the system is zero.

Wait, but the question is "calculate ΔH when two copper blocks [...] are placed in contact in an isolated container."

Hmm. So perhaps the question is referring to the total enthalpy change of the system, which is zero because the heat lost by one is gained by the other. So the net change is zero.

But wait, another approach: each block's ΔH is the heat they lose/gain.

So the hot block loses 192.5 kJ → ΔH is -192500 J.

The cold block gains 192.5 kJ → ΔH is +192500 J.

So the total ΔH for the system (the two blocks) is 0. So the answer would be zero. Which corresponds to option J: 0.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option J is 0. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the heat between the two blocks, which is the same as the total heat transfer, which would be 192500 J. But that's the heat that would be in the surroundings, which is not the question's subject.

Wait, the question says "calculate ΔH when two copper blocks [...] are placed in contact in an isolated container." So perhaps it's the heat transfer for each block, but the problem is about the overall enthalpy change. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the heat lost by the hotter block, which is 192.5 kJ, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking again at the options, option J is 0. So perhaps the correct answer is J.

To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) when two copper blocks, each of mass 10.0 kg, are placed in contact in an isolated container, we analyze the heat transfer between the blocks. The specific heat capacity of copper is given as 0.385 J/(g·K), and the system is isolated, meaning no heat is lost to the surroundings.

### Key Steps:
1. **Temperature Change**:  
   Since the blocks are at different temperatures (100°C and 0°C), they will exchange heat until they reach thermal equilibrium. The final temperature is determined by equating the heat lost by the hotter block to the heat gained by the cooler block. Solving, the final temperature is found to be 50°C.

2. **Heat Transfer**:  
   The heat lost by the hotter block is equal in magnitude to the heat gained by the cooler block. The heat transfer (Q) for each block is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T
   \]  
   where \( m = 10 \, \text{kg} = 10,000 \, \text{g} \), \( c = 0.385 \, \text{J/(g·K)} \), and \( \Delta T = 50 \, \text{K} \). Substituting these values:  
   \[
   Q = 10,000 \, \text{g} \cdot 0.385 \, \text{J/(g·K)} \cdot 50 \, \text{K} = 192,500 \, \text{J} = 192.5 \, \text{kJ}.
   \]  
   This is the heat lost by the hotter block and gained by the cooler block.

3. **Enthalpy Change**:  
   The problem asks for the change in enthalpy (ΔH). Enthalpy change is the heat transfer at constant pressure. Since the heat lost by the hotter block is equal to the heat gained by the cooler block, the total enthalpy change for the system is zero. This is because the heat lost by one block is exactly balanced by the heat gained by the other block.

4. **Answer Selection**:  
   Among the given options, the correct answer is **0 J**, which corresponds to option **J**.
