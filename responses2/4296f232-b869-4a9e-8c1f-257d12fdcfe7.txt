Alright, so I've got this math problem here: simplify (x multiplied by the square root of x cubed) to the fourth power. Hmm, okay. Let me break it down step by step. 

First, I need to simplify the expression inside the parentheses. The expression is x times the square root of x³. Wait, the square root of x³ can be rewritten using exponents, right? So, square root is the same as raising to the power of 1/2. So, sqrt(x³) is x^(3*(1/2)) which is x^(3/2). 

So, the expression becomes x multiplied by x^(3/2). When you multiply exponents with the same base, you add the exponents. So, x is x^1. So, adding 1 and 3/2 gives me 5/2. So, x multiplied by x^(3/2) is x^(5/2). 

Now, the whole thing is raised to the fourth power. So, (x^(5/2))^4. When you raise a power to a power, you multiply the exponents. So, 5/2 times 4 is (5*4)/2 = 20/2 = 10. So, the exponent is 10. 

Looking at the options, option I is 10. So, I think the correct answer is I.

To simplify \((x\sqrt{x^3})^4\), we first express the square root as an exponent: \(\sqrt{x^3} = x^{3/2}\). Then, multiply by \(x\): \(x \cdot x^{3/2} = x^{5/2}\). Raising this to the fourth power: \((x^{5/2})^4 = x^{(5/2) \cdot 4} = x^{10}\). 

The exponent of \(x\) is **10**, which corresponds to option I.

Answer: I
