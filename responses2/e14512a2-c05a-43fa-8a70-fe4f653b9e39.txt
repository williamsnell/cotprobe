Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Redding Department Store and their administrative expenses. Hmm, I need to find the share of administrative expenses based on the sales ratio method. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, so the total sales during June were $408,000. The store allocates its administrative expenses using the sales ratio method. That means the expenses are divided based on the sales of each department.

The question gives me the total sales and the administrative expense. The lingerie department had $10,200 in sales. I need to find how much of the $22,600 administrative expense goes to them.

Wait, so I think the formula would be something like allocating the expense proportionally to each department's sales. So the share would be (Lingerie Sales / Total Sales) * Total Administrative Expenses.

Let me write that down. So the share would be (10,200 / 408,000) multiplied by 22,600.

Let me calculate that. First, 10,200 divided by 408,000. Let me compute that. 408,000 divided by 10,200 is... wait, maybe it's easier to divide 10,200 by 408,000. Let me see, 10,200 ÷ 408,000. Hmm, 10,200 divided by 408,000 is equal to 0.025. Wait, no, wait: 408,000 divided by 10,200 is 40 (because 10,200 * 40 = 408,000). So 10,200 is 1/40 of 408,000. So 10,200 is 1/40 of the total sales. So the proportion is 1/40.

Wait, no, wait. Because if I have 10,200 /408,000, that's the same as 10,200 / (10,200 * 40) )= 1/40. Oh wait, that's correct. So 10,200 is 1/40 of the total sales.

So the share would be (1/40) * 22,600. Let me calculate that. 22,600 divided by 40. 40 goes into 2260 how many times? 40 * 565 = 22,600. Because 40 * 500 is 20,000, and 40*65 is 2600, totaling 22,600. So 22,600 /40 is 565. So the lingerie department's share would be $565.

Looking at the options, option A is $565. So that's the answer.

The share of administrative expenses based on sales is calculated by taking the proportion of the lingerie department's sales relative to the total and applying it to the total expense. 

The calculation is as follows:

Share = (Lingering Department Sales / Total Sales) × Total Administrative Expense  
Share = (10,200 / 408,000) × 22,600  
10,200 is 1/40 of 408,000, so:  
Share = (1/40) × 22,600 = 565.

The correct answer is **A: $565**.
