Late one night while the defendant was working alone, he got the urge to have a drink. He opened a bottle of rum that the store sold and soon began drinking. A short time later, the defendant became inebriated and passed out. Not long thereafter, a 15-year-old girl entered the store to purchase a package of cigarettes. She took a box off the shelf and went to the cashier's counter to pay for them. Seeing the defendant lying on the floor, unconscious, the girl left the exact price for the cigarettes on the countertop and left the store. If the defendant is prosecuted for violating the state statute, he should be found

Okay, so I've got this question about a state's statute regarding the sale of cigarettes to minors. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the statute prohibits the sale of cigarettes to anyone under 17. Violation is a misdemeanor, with a fine ranging from $500 to $5,000. The state says that this is a public welfare offense, so it doesn't require a mental state like criminal intent. That means the defendant's recklessness or negligence could still be considered. 

The defendant is a recovering alcoholic who works as a cashier at a drug store. Then, late one night, he got the urge to drink and opened a bottle of rum. He started drinking, and then he passed out. A few minutes later, a 15-year-old girl entered the store to buy cigarettes. She took a box off the shelf and left the exact price on the counter. When she came out, the girl left the cigarettes in an accessible place, and the store owner left her.

Now, the question is whether the defendant is guilty for violating the statute. The options suggest that either he's guilty or not guilty, and why.

So, the statute is about the sale of cigarettes to minors. The defendant was selling them. But what's the rule here? The statute says it's a public welfare offense, so it's a misdemeanor. That usually means it's not criminal, but it's a violation. So the defendant can be held liable for the act regardless of his criminal history because it's a public concern.

But wait, the state is interpreting it as a public welfare offense with no mental state requirement. So, does that change the charge? Hmm. Public welfare crimes are often criminal, but sometimes the courts have a discretion, especially if the offense is a matter of public policy. So, maybe the defendant can be found guilty for the proscribed act regardless of his criminal history.

Wait, but public welfare crimes don't have to be criminal. They're just not criminal. So, perhaps the defendant is guilty because he was negligent in selling the cigarettes to the girl. But what's the standard for such negligence?

Necesaridad ( necessity) is a common defense in these cases. If the defendant was in a position of trust or necessity, maybe he can be held liable. But in this case, the girl was a minor, and the store owner was selling to a minor. The defendant was selling to the girl, so perhaps he was in a position of trust. But wait, when a minor buys cigarettes from a store, the store is acting as a seller. So, the store's action is the violation.

Wait, but the statute is about the sale to minors. So the defendant was selling to a minor, so the store is selling to a minor, which is the violation. So the store is the seller, and the defendant is the seller. So the violation is that the store, as a seller, is selling to a minor.

But the statute says the store is prohibited from selling to minors, so that's the violation. The statute is a public welfare offense, so no criminal charge. But for purpose of the fine, it's a misdemeanor, which is a public concern. So the defendant can be found guilty because he was negligent enough to commit the act.

Wait, but the question is whether he's guilty or not. The statute says it's a public welfare offense, so it's not criminal. So the defendant can be found guilty for the act regardless of his criminal history because it's a criminal offense, but the charge isn't criminal. Wait, no, the statute is a criminal law, but it's a public welfare offense. So that doesn't necessarily make it criminal, but it does make it a matter for the state to handle.

Wait, the statute itself is a public welfare offense. So when the store sells to a minor, that's a public act. So the defendant could be found guilty for the act, regardless of his prior criminal history.

Now, the question is about the defendant's guilt. He's a recovering alcoholic, a cashier, and he was selling to the girl. The girl took the cigarettes. But the girl didn't get any money for them because the store owner left the price. The defendant was in a position of trust, acting as a seller.

Wait, but the girl didn't get the price, so she took a box without knowing the price. That's a breach of contract because the girl didn't receive the price, which is required for the goods. But the statute is about the sale, not about the price. So, the statute doesn't require the price to be given. So, whether the girl is liable for the sale is another matter.

Wait, but the statute is about the sale, not the price. So, even if the girl didn't receive the price, the sale was to a minor, which is a violation. So the defendant can be found guilty for the act regardless of whether the girl received the price.

But wait, in criminal law, public welfare crimes are not criminal. So, the defendant's guilt is based on negligence, not criminal intent. So, if he was negligent enough, he can be found guilty.

Wait, but the statute says the store is prohibited from selling to minors. So, the store is selling to a minor, which is a public matter. So, the store's action is a criminal offense. But the statute is about that, so the store is violating the statute. So, the defendant could be found guilty for the act, because the store is the seller, and selling to a minor is a public welfare offense requiring no mental state.

So, the defense of necessity applies here. The store owner was in a position of trust, acting as a seller. So, the defendant is in a position of necessity, so he can be held liable despite having a criminal history. So, the defendant is guilty, and the correct answer is G: guilty, because the 15-year-old girl should have been denied service.

Wait, but wait, no. The statute is about the sale, not the price. So, the girl didn't get the price. But the statute doesn't require the price to be given, it's about the sale. So, if the girl took the cigarettes without the price, that's a breach of contract, but the statute doesn't require the price to be given, so the girl isn't automatically liable.

Wait, but in this case, the girl took the cigarettes without the price. But she didn't get the price, so that's a breach of contract. But the statute doesn't require the price to be given, so the girl isn't automatically liable. So, the girl's negligence in not receiving the price is separate. But the store's act of selling to a minor is a public welfare offense. So, the defendant could be found guilty for the store's act, even if the girl didn't get the price.

Therefore, the defendant's action is negligent, so he's guilty.

Looking at the answer options, option G says guilty because the girl should have been denied service. But wait, the statute is about the sale, not the price. The girl didn't receive the price, but the statute doesn't require a price, so the girl isn't necessarily liable. So, the reason the girl should have been denied service is a different matter. The girl's negligence in not getting the price is separate. So, the store owner's action is the public welfare offense, making him guilty regardless of her state of mind or the price.

Wait, but the store's sale was to a minor, which is a public act. So the store's act is a criminal offense, but the statute is about it. So the store's officer is in a position of necessity, so the defendant can be found guilty.

So, the correct answer is G: guilty, because the 15-year-old girl should have been denied service.

Wait, but wait, the girl took the cigarettes without knowing the price. So, she didn't get the price. So, that's a breach of contract, but the statute doesn't require the price to be given. So, the girl's lack of payment is not a defense. So, the store's action is the one that's criminal, so the defendant is guilty.

So, the answer is G.

The statute in question prohibits the sale of cigarettes to anyone under the age of 17, and its violation is considered a public welfare offense. The state's interpretation of this statute as a strict liability offense, requiring no mental state, means the defendant could be found guilty for the proscribed act regardless of his criminal history. 

The defendant, a recovering alcoholic who worked as a cashier, sold cigarettes to a 15-year-old girl. The girl took the cigarettes without the defendant's knowledge, and the store owner left the price on the countertop. The store owner was in a position of trust, acting as a seller, and the defendant was negligent in selling to a minor. 

The statute requires the store to sell to a minor, which is a public act, making the defendant's action a criminal offense. The girl's lack of payment is irrelevant to the statute's requirements. The defendant's negligence in selling to a minor, especially in a position of trust, qualifies him for a fine or sentence. 

The correct answer is G: guilty, because the 15-year-old girl should have been denied service.
