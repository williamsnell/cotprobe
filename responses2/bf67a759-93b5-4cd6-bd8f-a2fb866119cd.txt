Question:

A landlord owned a three-story home in fee simple and leased it to his friend for a term of 10 years. By the terms of the lease, the friend expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the friend, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The friend and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the friend, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a professor, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the professor would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. After residing in the house for a year, the professor subleased the third floor to a student for a term of two years; the agreement provided that the professor would receive a monthly rental payment of $100. After the student had made regular rental payments to the professor for the first six months of the sublease, he defaulted. The following month, the professor sent the new owner $200 as payment for rent and notified him that he should collect the remaining $100 from the student, who refused to vacate the premises. In an action by the new owner against the student to recover the additional $100 for rent due, he will most probably

Options:

A: recover, even though he never objected to the sublease.
B: not recover, because the professor remains liable.
C: recover, because the new owner inherited all rights and responsibilities from the original landlord.
D: recover, because the landlord and sublessee are in privity of estate.
E: not recover, because the student is not directly responsible to the new owner.
F: not recover, because the student was not in privity of contract with the new owner.
G: not recover, because the professor would only be held liable.
H: not recover, because the professor is the one who subleased to the student.
I: recover, because the student is in direct violation of his sublease agreement.
J: recover, because the student defaulted on his rental payment.

Okay, so I have this legal question here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the situation is about property leasing and assignments. Let me try to outline the key points.

So, the landlord owns a three-story home and leases it to his friend for 10 years. The lease says the friend must pay $300 a month in rental and pay taxes during the term. Also, the friend can't assign or sublease the premises. That's important because it affects what can happen after the lease ends.

The friend lived in the house for two years. But then, he gave his leasehold interest to a professor. The professor didn't know about the assignment prohibition. The professor's assignment said he'd pay $300 monthly, but nothing about taxes. The landlord didn't object to this, so the professor took the interest.

After a few months, the landlord conveyed the property to a new owner. The professor then subleased the third floor to a student for two years. The agreement said the professor would get $100 a month, but the student didn't pay the rental, so the new owner paid $200, and the student defaulted.

Now, the new owner is suing the student for $100 in rent. The question is, can the student recover this money?

Hmm, I think this is about leasehold subassignment and ownership issues. Let me remember the rules about sublease agreements and assignments.

First, the assignment by the professor to the student. The professor's assignment didn't mention taxes, but the original lease required paying taxes. So, the assignment didn't clearly state what the landlord would pay. Wait, no, the assignment didn't mention the landlord paying either; it just said the professor would pay $300 a month. So, if the assignment was based on the original lease terms, then the landlord would have to pay taxes as per the original lease. But the student didn't pay, so perhaps the landlord is liable for taxes.

Wait, but let me think again. The original lease required the friend (and thus the professor) to pay $300 a month and pay taxes. The professor didn't pay taxes in the assignment, which was a sublease. So, perhaps the assignment was based on the original lease terms, but the student didn't pay, so the landlord is liable for taxes.

But wait, the question is about recovery for the student's rent. The student defaulted on $100, but the landlord didn't object to the assignment. So, the student is a subtenant. Now, in some states, sub tenants may have rights to recover from the original tenant if the original tenant is still in possession.

But the problem here is that the assignment was made in a way that the professor (friend) didn't object, but he's in a position of trust. Also, the assignment didn't mention the landlord paying taxes, which would have made the assignment more contentious.

Wait, but I also remember that when a tenant assigns their interest, the new tenant (subtenant) is entitled to recover the rent if the original tenant is still in possession. But in this case, the sublease agreement didn't specify the landlord's responsibility. So, if the student didn't pay the rent, the original landlord would be liable because he's still responsible for the rent, and the student was a subtenant.

But wait, the question is about the student's recovery. The student's agreement didn't specify the landlord's responsibility, but under the law, when a subtenant assigns to a landlord, the landlord may have a duty to pay the rent if the subtenant is still in possession.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, the landlord may have a right to collect rent from the subtenant even if the subtenant's assignment isn't detailed. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the assignment itself may have created a situation where the landlord is liable because the subtenant was assigned a lease that requires payment, and the subtenant didn't pay.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's think about the facts.

The landlord leased the house to the professor for 10 years. The professor didn't object to the assignment, so he gave the student the assignment. The assignment said the professor would pay $300 a month, but nothing about taxes. The student then assigned to the professor for two years, where the professor gets $100 a month. So, the student's agreement didn't mention taxes.

In the subsequent case, the student defaulted on the rent. So the landlord paid $200, but the student paid $100 (the default) that month, and the student refused to vacate. So, the new owner is suing the student for $100.

Now, under the law, when a subtenant assigns a lease, the new tenant (subtenant) is entitled to recover the rent if the original tenant is still in possession. But in this case, the subtenant's assignment never specified that the landlord would pay. So, does the assignment automatically make the landlord responsible for the rent?

Wait, another angle: the assignment was made by the professor, who didn't object. But the professor's assignment was to the student. The assignment didn't mention the landlord's part, so the landlord is still responsible for paying the $300 each month. So, the student was in possession for a year, and the landlord paid $200, but the student didn't pay the full $300 that month. So, the landlord would have a duty to pay the student $300, but he only paid $200. So, the landlord would have to pay $100 more.

But the student then defaulted on his rental payment. So, the student should be able to recover from the landlord.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility. So, the answer hinges on whether the assignment automatically creates the landlord's obligation to pay.

Alternatively, the assignment might have created an obligation for the subtenant to pay the landlord. But if the assignment didn't say so, then the landlord is still responsible.

Wait, but the student is the subtenant. So, when the student assigned the lease, the landlord had a duty to pay the subtenant (since the student was a tenant). So, the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility, but the assignment was based on the original lease terms. So, the landlord would have to pay the subtenant $300 a month, but the student didn't pay that amount in the first month of the sublease.

So, the landlord is still responsible, and the student is a subtenant who was assigned a lease that requires payment. Therefore, the landlord would have a duty to pay $300, but only paid $200. So, the landlord would have to pay the student $100 more.

But the question is, can the student recover from the professor or the landlord?

Wait, the student's action is against the professor, who is the subtenant. So, the student's case is against the professor, who is the subtenant.

But the original assignment (to the student) didn't mention the landlord's responsibility. So, the landlord is still responsible. That means the landlord could be held liable for the $100 default the student made. But wait, the assignment only said the professor would pay $300, not the landlord. So, the assignment didn't state that the landlord would pay the subtenant, which might mean that the landlord is still responsible.

Alternatively, the assignment might have created a duty for the subtenant to pay the landlord. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Usually, when a tenant assigns their lease, the new tenant is responsible for the rent if the original tenant is still in possession. But if the assignment doesn't specify the landlord's responsibility, the landlord is still liable.

Wait, but in this case, the assignment didn't mention the landlord paying. So, the landlord is still responsible for paying the rent. Therefore, the student, as a subtenant, is liable for the rent. But in the student's case, he defaulted on two payments, but only paid $200, not the full $300 that month. So, he's not sure if he can recover because he might not know the landlord is responsible.

Wait, but the question is about the student's recovery. The landlord and subtenant are in a contract? Or is the assignment a separate action?

Also, another consideration: the assignment by the professor to the student didn't mention the landlord. So, the assignment might have left the landlord in a position of trust, but the assignment itself didn't specify the landlord's responsibility.

In some cases, when a subtenant assigns a lease, the landlord is still responsible for paying the rent if the subtenant is in possession. So, the landlord is still responsible, and the student, as the subtenant, is liable. So, the landlord could be held liable for the rent.

But wait, the assignment didn't specify that the landlord would pay. So, the assignment is silent on the landlord's responsibility, meaning the landlord must still pay the subtenant.

But in the problem, the student defaulted on his rent, and the landlord paid part of it. So, the landlord is still responsible, and the student is a rent collector. But in many cases, the landlord is a tenant, so the student is the landlord. So, the student is the landlord, right?

Wait, no. The student is the subtenant. The landlord is the original tenant. So, the student is a subtenant, and the landlord is the original tenant. So, the landlord is still responsible for the rent, but the student is a subtenant who was assigned the lease.

So, the student is a subtenant and is entitled to collect rent from the original tenant, the landlord.

But the assignment by the professor didn't mention the landlord paying, so the landlord is still responsible for paying the subtenant (student) $300 a month. So, the student's rent is due from the landlord.

But wait, the student had to pay $100 in the first month of the sublease. He paid $200, which is more than the $100 he was supposed to pay. So, he's the one who's in breach. But the student can sue the landlord for the amount he was supposed to pay.

But the question is about the student's action against the professor (the subtenant), not the landlord. So, the student is suing the professor, not the landlord.

Wait, in the problem, the student is suing the professor, not the landlord. Because the professor is subleasing to the student. So, the student is suing the professor for $100. But the professor's assignment didn't mention the landlord's responsibility, so the professor is liable for the $300, but he didn't object to the assignment.

Wait, no, the professor is the subtenant. So, the student is the professor. The student is suing the professor (subtenant) for $100. But the professor's assignment didn't mention the landlord's responsibility, meaning the professor is still liable for the $300, and the subtenant (student) is responsible for collecting rent from the original tenant (landlord) if the subtenant is still in possession.

Wait, but in this case, the student was in possession for a year, so the landlord is still responsible for the rent. So, the student is a subtenant and is entitled to collect rent from the original tenant (landlord) if the subtenant is still in possession.

But the student didn't pay the full $300 in the first month, so he's in breach. But can he recover the $100 he was supposed to pay?

Wait, no, because the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility. So, the student is a subtenant, and the landlord is the original tenant. The student is a subtenant and thus is responsible for paying rent from the original tenant (landlord). So, the student is a rent collector and is entitled to collect rent from the landlord.

But the student's rent is $100 a month, and he paid $200 that month, which is more than he was supposed to pay. So, he's in breach. But in my previous analysis, if the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility, the landlord is still responsible. So, the student can sue the landlord for the $100.

Wait, but in some states, the landlord is not liable for the subtenant. Oh wait no, that's not right. The landlord is a tenant, so the subtenant (student) is a tenant. So, the subtenant is responsible for collecting rent from the original tenant (landlord) if the subtenant is still in possession.

So, the student is the subtenant, so he's responsible for the rent. The assignment didn't say the landlord would pay, so the landlord is still responsible. So, the student is a rent collector. He was supposed to collect $100 a month. He paid $200, which is more than he was supposed to. But he's a rent collector, and he could sue the landlord for the amount he was supposed to collect.

Wait, but the problem states that the assignment didn't mention the landlord's responsibility. So, the assignment is silent on that. So, the landlord is still responsible for paying the subtenant.

So, the student is the subtenant, and the landlord is responsible for paying. The professor's assignment didn't specify. So, the assignment left the landlord in a position of trust, but the assignment itself didn't state that the landlord would pay the subtenant.

So, the student is the subtenant, and the assignment created no obligation for the landlord. Thus, the landlord is still responsible. So, the student can sue the landlord for the amount he was supposed to pay.

But wait, the student is the professor, right? Because the professor gave the student the assignment. The assignment is a sublease agreement. So, the student is the professor. So, the student is a subtenant, and the landlord is the original tenant.

So, the student is a rent collector. The assignment didn't mention the landlord's responsibility, so the landlord is still responsible. Thus, the student can collect rent from the landlord.

But the assignment was silent on the landlord's responsibility. So, the landlord is still responsible for the $300 rent, but perhaps the student can recover from the landlord.

Wait, but let's think about the options given. The options are about whether the student can recover.

Option G says the student would be held liable because the professor would only be held liable. But the professor is the subtenant, not the landlord. So, that's not relevant.

Option D says the student is in direct violation. But the assignment didn't specify the landlord's obligation, so the student is not directly liable.

Wait, but the assignment was made by the professor, who didn't object. So, the professor is in a position of trust. But the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility, so the landlord is still responsible.

So, the professor (student) is a subtenant, and the assignment didn't mention the landlord's responsibility, so the student is a rent collector. The student can sue the landlord for the $100 he was supposed to pay.

But the question is whether the student can recover the $100 for rent. Since the assignment didn't specify that the landlord would pay, the student is a rent collector. So, the student is in breach, and can sue the landlord for that amount.

But the options don't have an option that says the student is liable. Wait, but looking back at the options:

Options:

G: not recover because the professor would only be held liable.

Wait, no. Because the student is the professor, and the assignment didn't mention the landlord's responsibility.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about the law.

When a subtenant assigns a lease, the new tenant is responsible for paying the rent if the original tenant is still in possession. The original tenant is still responsible for the rent. The assignment itself doesn't specify the original tenant's responsibility.

So, in this case, the assignment didn't say the landlord would pay. So, the assignment left the landlord in a position of trust but didn't involve the landlord's responsibility. Therefore, the landlord is still responsible for the subtenant (student) and must pay the $300 per month.

The student, as the subtenant, is responsible for collecting rent from the original tenant (landlord). Since the assignment didn't state the landlord's obligation, the student is not directly liable, but the landlord is still responsible.

So, the student can sue the landlord for the $100 he was supposed to pay. But the options don't have that. Let me look at the options.

Wait, the options are about the student's case. The question is: the student will most probably [what?].

Looking at the options:

A: recover, even though he never objected to the sublease.

But the professor didn't object to the assignment. The assignment was silent about the landlord's responsibility. So, the assignment didn't make the student's sublease agreement a contract in the traditional sense. So, the student is a rent collector, and the landlord is responsible.

But the student is suing the professor. The professor is the subtenant. So, the student is suing the original landlord, not the professor. So, the options don't directly address that.

Wait, but the options are about the student's action. Let's check.

Looking at the options, option D says the student is in direct violation, but the assignment didn't mention the landlord's responsibility. So, the student is not directly liable. So, the student can't be held liable directly.

Option G: not recover because the professor would only be held liable. But the professor is the subtenant, not the landlord.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about what the options are:

Options G: not recover because the professor would only be held liable.

But the professor is the subtenant, not the landlord. So, the student is the professor. So, G is not relevant.

Wait, another thought: the assignment was made by the professor, who didn't object. The assignment didn't mention the landlord's responsibility, so the assignment left the landlord in a position of trust, but the assignment itself didn't create an obligation for the landlord to pay. So, the landlord is still responsible for the subtenant (student). So, the student is a rent collector and is in breach.

But the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility, so the student is not directly liable. But the landlord is still responsible.

But the question is whether the student can recover the $100. Since the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility, the student is not directly liable for the $300, but the landlord is still responsible.

Wait, but the student is suing the professor (subtenant), not the landlord. So, the assignment was silent on the landlord's responsibility, but the student is the professor. So, the student is a subtenant and is the professor.

So, the student is the subtenant, and the professor is the subtenant. The professor gave the student an assignment. The student is the professor.

Wait, that can't be right. The assignment was given by the professor to the student. So, the student is the professor. So, the student is the one suing the professor (subtenant). So, the student is the professor, and the professor is the subtenant.

So, the student is the professor, and he's suing the professor (subtenant) for $100. But the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility for the professor. So, the assignment didn't say that the professor would pay the landlord. So, the professor (student) is still responsible for paying the $300 each month.

So, the student is in breach because he didn't pay the full $300 that month. But he was supposed to pay $100. So, he's in direct breach. But wait, the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility, so the student is not directly liable.

Wait, but the assignment didn't specify that the landlord would pay the subtenant, so the student's obligation is only for the rent, but the assignment itself didn't specify the landlord's responsibility. So, the landlord is still responsible for the $300, but the student can't claim that because the assignment didn't make it clear.

So, the student is the professor, the subtenant, and the professor is the student. So, the student is suing the professor (subtenant) for $100.

But the assignment didn't state that the professor would pay the landlord. Therefore, the professor is still responsible for paying the $300 rent.

So, the student is in breach because he didn't pay the full $300. He's not in direct breach, but he's in direct breach of the $100 he was supposed to pay.

But the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility, so the student is not liable for the $300. So, the student is a rent collector, and the professor is the original tenant.

So, the student can sue the professor (landlord) for the $100 he was supposed to pay.

So, looking at the options, which one says that the student is not directly liable for the $300, but the professor is. So, the student is a rent collector, and the professor is responsible.

But the options don't have an option that says the student is not liable. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: recover, even though he never objected to the sublease.

But the assignment was silent on the landlord's responsibility, so the student can't be held liable for the $300.

B: never objected to the assignment, so no liability.

But the assignment was silent on the landlord's responsibility, so the student can't be held liable for the $300.

C: never object, no liability.

Same as B.

D: student is in direct violation.

But the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility, so the student isn't directly liable for the $300.

E: student is not liable.

I think the correct answer is E: student is not liable.

But let me double-check.

No, because the assignment was silent on the landlord's responsibility. So, the student is not liable for the $300. So, he can't claim that he's in direct violation.

Wait, but the assignment didn't make him responsible for the $300. So, he's not liable for that. But he's in breach of the $100 he was supposed to pay.

But the option E says the student is not liable. So, the correct answer is E.

Wait, but another angle: the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility. So, the student is a rent collector, and he's in breach of the $100 he was supposed to pay. But he's not directly liable for the $300 he was supposed to pay.

Wait, but the assignment was made by the professor, who didn't object. The assignment didn't mention the landlord's responsibility, so the student is not directly liable for the $300.

Therefore, the student is a rent collector, and he can sue the original tenant (landlord) for the amount he was supposed to pay.

But the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility, so the student is not directly liable. Therefore, the correct answer is E: student is not liable.

Wait, but the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility, so the student is not directly liable for the $300. So, the student is a rent collector, and he can sue the original tenant (landlord) for the amount he was supposed to pay.

So, the options don't have an option that says the student is not liable for the $300. But the options are about the student's action.

Wait, the options are about the student's claim against the professor. So, the student is suing the professor (subtenant), not the landlord. So, the assignment was silent on the landlord's responsibility, so the student is not liable for the $300. But the student is in a breach because he didn't pay the $100. But he's not in a direct violation of the $300.

Wait, the assignment didn't mention the landlord's responsibility, so the student is not directly liable for the $300. So, the student can sue the original tenant (landlord) for the $300, but he's not directly liable for the $100 he paid.

But the options don't have an option that says the student is not liable for the $300. So, the correct answer is E: student is not liable.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Another approach: in the assignment, the professor (student) didn't object. The assignment was silent on the landlord's responsibility. So, the student is not liable for the $300. So, he can't claim that he's in direct violation of the $300. But he's in a breach of the $100.

But the question is whether the student can recover the $100. Since the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility, the student is not liable for the $300, but he can sue the original tenant (landlord) for the $100 he was supposed to pay.

But the options don't have an option that says the student is not liable for the $300. So, the correct answer is E: the student is not liable.

Wait, but the assignment was silent on the landlord's responsibility, so the student is not liable for the $300. So, the student can't claim that he's directly violating the $300. But he can claim that he's in breach of the $100. But the options don't have an option that says the student is not liable for the $100.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: the student is not liable.

Alternatively, the correct answer is G: the student would be liable because the professor would only be held liable.

Wait, the student is the professor, right? No, the student is the professor. The assignment is a sublease agreement. The student is the subtenant, and the professor is the subtenant. So, the student is the professor, and the professor is the subtenant.

So, the student is a subtenant, and the professor is the subtenant. The assignment was silent on the landlord's responsibility. So, the professor is still responsible for paying the $300. The student is a rent collector, and he is in breach of the $100 he was supposed to pay.

But the assignment didn't specify the landlord's responsibility, so the student is not directly liable for the $300.

So, the student can't claim that he's in direct violation of the $300. So, the correct answer is E: the student is not liable.

Wait, but another thought: the assignment was silent on the landlord's responsibility, so the student is not liable for the $300, but he's in a breach of the $100. So, the student can't claim that he's in direct violation of the $300. So, the correct answer is E: the student is not liable.

But looking at the options, E is about the student not being liable. So, that's the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is E: the student is not liable.

**Explanation:**

When a student assigns a lease to another tenant, the new tenant is generally not liable for the rent unless the assignment explicitly states that the landlord would be responsible for the subtenant. In this case, the assignment was silent on the landlord's responsibility, leaving the student in a position of trust. As a result, the student is not directly liable for the $300 rent. However, the student is in breach of the $100 he was supposed to pay, which makes the student a rent collector and subject to the landlord for that amount. Since the assignment did not specify the landlord's obligation, the student is not directly liable for the $300. Therefore, the student is not liable for the breach of the $100.

Answer: E
