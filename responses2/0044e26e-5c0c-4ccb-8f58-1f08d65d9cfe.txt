Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Alright, the question is about a boy bailing a boat and lifting some water. There are two parts: part (a) asks for the work he performs, and part (b) asks for the work done by gravity. The options are labeled from A to J, each with two numbers. 

Hmm, I remember that work is calculated using the formula W = F * d * cos(theta), where F is the force applied, d is the distance, and theta is the angle between the force and the displacement. But wait, this is about lifting water, so the force here is the weight of the water, right? Because the boy is exerting force to lift the water against gravity.

Wait, but let me think. The boy is lifting the water against the force of gravity. So the force he applies is equal to the weight of the water he's lifting. The weight is mass times gravity. Oh right, F = m * g. 

The mass here is 2.0 kg, and the height lifted is 1.2 m. So the force would be 2.0 kg times 9.8 m/s². Let me calculate that. 2.0 * 9.8 is 19.6 N. Wait, that's 19.6 Newtons. So the force is 19.6 N.

Now, the displacement is 1.2 m upwards. Since the force is in the same direction as the displacement, the angle theta is 0 degrees and cos(0) is 1. So the work done by the boy would be 19.6 N * 1.2 m. Let me compute that: 19.6 * 1.2. Hmm, 20 * 1.2 is 24, but since it's 19.6, it's 23.52 J. Wait, but the options probably round to whole numbers. So maybe it's 24 J?

Wait, but wait. The boy is exerting force and lifting the water, so the work done by the boy is positive. But the question is part (a): how much work does he perform? So that would be positive 23.52, which I think rounds to 24 J. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 24 as part of any option. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, for example, option D is 21 J and -19 J. Option G is 23.5, but none of the options have 23.5. So perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, 2 kg * 9.8 m/s² is 19.6 N. 19.6 N * 1.2 m is 23.52 J. So the work done by the boy is positive, 23.52 J, which is approximately 24 J. But the options don't show 24. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I should recalculate. 19.6 * 1.2: 19.6*1 is 19.6, 19.6*0.2 is 3.92. So 19.6 + 3.92 is 23.52. So that's about 23.5 J. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is 24 J, but in the options, the closest is option G, which is 23.5. But let me look again.

Wait, the options: option G is 23.5 and -23.5. So 23.5. Hmm, but that's approximate. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact value. Let me see, 2.0 kg * 9.8 = 19.6. 19.6 *1.2=23.52 J. So the work done by the boy is +23.52 J, which is 23.5 J approximately.

But looking at the options, let's see what's available. Option G is (23.5, -23.5). Hmm, but there's no option with that exact value. The closest would be 23.5, but none of the options have that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the mass is 2.0 kg, the height is 1.2 m. The work done by the boy is F*d. F is 2 kg * 9.8 = 19.6 N. So 19.6 *1.2=23.52. So the work done is 23.52 J. So the correct answer would be 23.5 J. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is G, but that's 23.5. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the work done by the boy and the work done by gravity. Because the problem also asks part (b), which is the work done by gravity. So let's clarify. 

The work done by the boy is positive, because he's lifting the water upwards against gravity. So the work done by the boy is W = F * d = 19.6 N * 1.2 m = 23.52 J. So (a) is 24 J (or 23.5 J, but the options don't have that). 

Then, part (b): the work done by gravity. Since gravity is acting downward, and the displacement is upward, the angle between force and displacement is 180 degrees. So the cosine of 180 is -1. So the work done by gravity would be F_gravity * d * cos(180). 

F_gravity is 19.6 N, d is 1.2 m. So 19.6 *1.2 is 23.52, times -1. So that's -23.52 J. So the work done by gravity is approximately -23.5 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 23.5 or -23.5. The options provided don't have that. Let me look again. 

Looking at the options:

A: 18, -18

B: 20, -20

C:27, -25

D:21, -19

E:26, -26

F:22, -22

G:23.5, -23.5

H:24, -24

I:19, -21

J:25, -25.

So the work done by the boy is approximately 23.5 J, but none of the options have that. The closest is option G:23.5 and -23.5. But wait, the problem is the units. The options probably have two decimal places, but perhaps they are using exact fractions or more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate without rounding. Let me compute 2.0 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 19.6 N. 19.6 *1.2 = 23.52 J. So (a) is 23.52, which is 23.5 J approximately.

But the options don't have 23.5. The closest is option G: 23.5 J and -23.5 J.

Wait, but in the problem, perhaps the height is 1.2 meters or maybe I'm getting the numbers wrong. Wait, the question says 2.0 kg of water is lifted to 1.2 m. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was wrong. Let me think: could the work done by the boy be positive? Because he's lifting the water, so yes. The work done by gravity is negative because gravity is opposing the direction of displacement.

So, the boy does positive work, gravity does negative.

So for part (a): 23.52 J, which would be approximately 24 J. But the options don't have 24 J, only 23.5 in G. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to take the formula correctly. Another approach: the formula for gravitational potential energy is mgh, which is 2 *9.8 *1.2 = 23.52 J. That's the energy the boy has to lift the water, which matches the work done by him.

But the question is about the work done by the boy and by gravity. So the work done by the boy is +23.52 J, and the work done by gravity is -23.52 J, which is what I found.

Looking at the options, the only option that matches this is option G: 23.5 and -23.5.

Wait, but wait. The options in the problem are labeled A: 18, -18; B:20, -20; C:27, -25; D:21, -19; E:26, -26; F:22, -22; G:23.5, -23.5; H:24, -24; etc.

So, in the options, G is 23.5 and -23.5. So the correct answer would be option G.

But wait, why do the options have 23.5? Let me think if the calculation is correct. Oh, right! Wait, wait, 2.0 kg of water. 2 kg * 9.8 m/s² is 19.6 N. 19.6 N * 1.2 m is 23.52 J. So that's correct.

So the work done by the boy is positive 23.52 J, and the work done by gravity is negative 23.52 J. So the correct answer is option G.

To solve the problem, we calculate the work done by the boy and by gravity using the formula \( W = F \cdot d \cdot \cos(\theta) \), where \( F \) is the force, \( d \) is the displacement, and \( \theta \) is the angle between the force and displacement. 

### Part (a): Work done by the boy
The force exerted by the boy is equal to the weight of the water, \( F = m \cdot g = 2.0 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 19.6 \, \text{N} \). The displacement is \( d = 1.2 \, \text{m} \), and the angle \( \theta \) is \( 0^\circ \) since the force is in the same direction as the displacement. Thus, \( \cos(0^\circ) = 1 \). 

The work done by the boy is:
\[
W_{\text{boy}} = F \cdot d = 19.6 \cdot 1.2 = 23.52 \, \text{J}.
\]

### Part (b): Work done by gravity
The force of gravity is \( F_{\text{gravity}} = 19.6 \, \text{N} \). The displacement is still \( d = 1.2 \, \text{m} \), but the angle \( \theta \) is \( 180^\circ \) because gravity acts downward, opposing the upward displacement. Thus, \( \cos(180^\circ) = -1 \). 

The work done by gravity is:
\[
W_{\text{gravity}} = F_{\text{gravity}} \cdot d \cdot \cos(180^\circ) = 19.6 \cdot 1.2 \cdot (-1) = -23.52 \, \text{J}.
\]

### Matching with the options
The calculated values are \( W_{\text{boy}} = +23.52 \, \text{J} \) and \( W_{\text{gravity}} = -23.52 \, \text{J} \). The closest option is **G: 23.5 J, -23.5 J**.
