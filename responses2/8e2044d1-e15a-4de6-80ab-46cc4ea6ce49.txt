Question:

What is the major difference between naturalism and positivism?

Options:

A: Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such
B: Naturalism is a contemporary theory, while positivism is a traditional theory
C: On the one hand, naturalism is based on a set of rules that are of universal and objective scope and on the other hand, positivism is based on a structured and coherent legal system that is created by States in light of their interests and desires

F: Naturalism is a theory of law that is subjective and varies from person to person, while positivism is a theory of law that is objective and the same for everyone.
G: Naturalism is a school of thought advocated outside of Europe, while positivism is Euro-centric theory
H: Naturalism is a theory of law that relies on the inherent morality of a society, while positivism relies on the codification of laws by a governing body
I: While naturalism serves only the theory human rights law, positivism has a wider and more general scope
J: Naturalism is concerned with the moral aspects of law, while positivism is concerned with the legal aspects of law

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about naturalism and positivism. Let me try to figure this out. I remember from my studies that these are different philosophical approaches to understanding the world, especially in the context of law. I think the key difference lies in their methods and views on what's real or what's objective.

So, the question asks, what's the major difference between them? The options are A through J. I need to pick the correct one.

Let me start by recalling what each term means. Naturalism, if I remember correctly, is more about the moral and ethical aspects of law. It's often associated with human rights and the idea that laws should be just and based on the inherent morality of society. Positivism, on the other hand, is more about the objective reality. It posits that laws are codified through legal systems, like the international system, and that they're objective and universal.

Looking at the options:

Option A says naturalism deals with the underpinning values of international society, and positivism with international rules. That sounds right. Naturalism would focus on the reasons why laws are as they are, while positivism would be more about the rules themselves.

Option B says naturalism is contemporary, positivism traditional. I'm not sure about that. I think both approaches have been around for a long time, so maybe B isn't the main difference.

Option C mentions universal and objective vs structured legal system. Hmm, that's about the scope of each approach. Naturalism might be more about the underlying principles, while positivism is about the legal structures. So C seems to capture some points but maybe not the main difference.

Option D suggests naturalism views laws as subjective and influenced by personal beliefs, and positivism as objective and universal. That makes sense. Naturalism is about why laws are formed, considering the moral and ethical bases. Positivism is about the actual, objective laws.

Option E talks about interpretation vs enforcement. I'm not sure about this. Both might involve how laws are interpreted or enforced, but the options are a bit different.

Option F is about subjectivity vs objectivity. Naturalism is subjective, as it's about the moral reasons behind laws, while positivism is objective. That's a point, but does it cover the main difference?

Option G says naturalism is outside Europe, positivism Euro-centric. I don't think that's correct. Both approaches are considered part of the international system, so their theories are often Western in origin but can be applied across different regions.

Option H states naturalism relies on inherent morality, positivism on codification. Oh, that's similar to option F and D. H is trying to say that naturalism is based on moral principles, while positivism is based on legal codification. That's a good point. It's a bit about the foundation of each theory.

Option I says naturalism focuses on human rights and theory of law, positivism has a more general scope. That sounds correct too. Naturalism is about the rights and justice aspects, while positivism is broader, including human rights.

Option J says naturalism is moral, positivism legal. That's similar to H and D.

So, the options D, H, and I are suggesting different points about the nature of naturalism and positivism.

The question is asking for the major difference. Let me think about what distinguishes them.

Naturalism seems to focus on the moral and ethical reasons behind laws, whereas positivism is about the rules themselves, which are established through legal systems.

Looking at the options, D says naturalism argues laws are subjective and influenced by personal beliefs, while positivism argues they're objective. H says naturalism is about inherent morality, and positivism about codification.

So, D is more about the subjectivity of naturalism, while H is about the nature of the laws. But which is the major difference? The question is about the major difference, so perhaps D is more about the nature of the theory's foundation.

Wait, another approach: naturalism is more about the underlying moral principles, while positivism is about the legal frameworks. So, the major difference is that naturalism looks for objective moral reasons, while positivism is objective and relies on legal codification.

So, looking at the options, option H is similar to that, but option D says naturalism is subjective, while positivism is objective.

Wait, the question is asking for the major difference. Let me think of the key points. Naturalism's primary focus is on the moral and ethical aspects, while positivism is about the structured and objective legal systems.

So, the major difference is that naturalism is about the moral and ethical reasons for laws, while positivism is about the structured legal systems. So, the correct answer would be either D or H.

Wait, the options are:

H: Naturalism is a theory of law that relies on the inherent morality of a society, while positivism relies on the codification of laws by a governing body.

Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking. So H is a good option.

Alternatively, D says naturalism is subjective, while positivism is objective.

Hmm. Let me think again. The main point is whether the theories are about the rational or the objective aspects. Naturalism is about the moral reasons, so it's subjective in the sense that it's based on what's right or wrong. Positivism is about the objective, rule-based systems.

Wait, but option D says naturalism is subjective, while positivism is objective. So that's a correct point. Option H says naturalism is about inherent morality, and positivism about codification. So both are correct points, but perhaps D is a broader point about the nature of the theories.

Wait, the question is asking for the major difference, so the key point is the theory's focus. Let me think about what each theory is known for.

Naturalism, as I recall, is more about the moral and ethical principles that justify laws. Positivism is more about the legal systems and their codification. So the major difference is that naturalism is concerned with the moral reasons for laws, while positivism is about the structured legal systems.

Therefore, the correct answer is H, which states that naturalism is based on the inherent morality of a society, while positivism is based on codification of laws.

Wait, but another thought: the options are A through J. So I have to pick the only correct one.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: naturalism is subjective, positivism is objective.

Option H: naturalism is moral, positivism is codified.

Both D and H capture different aspects, but the question is about the major difference.

The major difference is that naturalism is about the moral or ethical reasons, while positivism is about the objective legal systems. So the correct answer would be about the nature of the theories.

So, H is about the theories' foundations. Naturalism is about the moral principles, while positivism is about the legal codification.

Therefore, the correct answer is H.
</think>

The major difference between naturalism and positivism lies in their focus and approach to understanding the law. Naturalism emphasizes the moral and ethical reasons behind laws, seeking to ground them in societal values. Positivism, on the other hand, is centered on the structured and objective legal systems, codified by governments. Naturalism is concerned with the rational and subjective justification of laws, while positivism is about the objective and rule-based systems. This difference is best captured by option **H**, which highlights naturalism's focus on inherent morality and positivism's reliance on legal codification.

ANSWER: H
