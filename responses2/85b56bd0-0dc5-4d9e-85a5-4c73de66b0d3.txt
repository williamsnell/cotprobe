Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: 2.3 grams of ethanol is added to 500 grams of water. We need to find the molality of the resulting solution. The options are from A to J, with various decimal values.

Hmm, molality. Right, molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. Oh wait, I remember that's different from molarity, which is moles per liter. So here, since it's molality, we need to focus on the solvent's mass.

Wait, the solute is ethanol, and the solvent is water. So the solute is what's being dissolved, and the mass of the solvent is 500 grams. But wait, the question is about molality, so we should use the mass of the solvent in kilograms.

But wait, wait a second. The question gives the mass of ethanol and water. But since molality is based on the solvent, which is water, I'll use the mass of water (500 grams) to find the denominator.

So first, I need to find out how many moles of ethanol are present in 2.3 grams. Because the molecular weight of ethanol is given as 46 g/mol. So moles = mass / molecular weight.

Let me calculate that. 2.3 grams divided by 46 g/mol. Let me do 2.3 / 46. Let's see, 46 goes into 2.3 0.05 times because 46 * 0.05 is 2.3. Exactly, so 0.05 moles of ethanol.

So now, since molality is moles of solute per kg of solvent, and the solvent is 500 grams, which is 0.5 kg. So moles are 0.05, kg is 0.5.

So 0.05 mol / 0.5 kg = 0.1 mol/kg. Oh wait, that would be 0.1 m.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.35, E is 0.1, so option E is 0.1.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations. Because 2.3g /46g/mol is 0.05 moles. Yes, that's correct. 500g is 0.5 kg. So 0.05 / 0.5 is 0.1 mol/kg, which is 0.1 molal. So the answer should be E.

To determine the molality of the solution, we use the formula:

\[
\text{molality} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kilograms of solvent}}
\]

The solute is ethanol (C₂₃OH₅), and the solvent is water. The mass of ethanol is 2.3 g, and the molecular weight of ethanol is 46 g/mol. First, calculate the moles of ethanol:

\[
\text{moles of ethanol} = \frac{\text{mass of ethanol}}{\text{molecular weight of ethanol}} = \frac{2.3}{46} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}
\]

Next, convert the mass of water from grams to kilograms. The mass of water is 500 g, which is:

\[
0.5 \, \text{kg}
\]

Now, calculate the molality:

\[
\text{molality} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{0.5 \, \text{kg}} = 0.1 \, \text{molal}
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is **E: 0.1 molal**.

Answer: E
