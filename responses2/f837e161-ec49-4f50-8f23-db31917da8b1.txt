Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrostatic force. Hmm, let me try to understand what it's asking. The problem says that a tiny sphere has a charge Q, and a fraction alpha (α) of that charge is transferred to a nearby, but I guess different sphere. Wait, but the spheres can be treated as particles, so maybe they're point charges or something. 

The question is asking what value of α maximizes the magnitude of the electrostatic force F between them. The options are from 0.25 to 1, so I think it's a multiple-choice with options A to J, each being a specific decimal. 

I remember that Coulomb's law says F = k*(|q1*q2|)/(r²). Since the spheres are nearby, I can probably ignore the distance part because it's given as a constant or not part of the calculation. So F is proportional to the product of the charges on each sphere.

So, the initial charge is Q on each sphere? Or wait, maybe only one sphere has the charge Q, and the other is neutral initially. Because the problem says a fraction α is transferred. Oh, right, I think initially, one sphere has charge Q, and the other is neutral. Or wait, the problem says "the spheres can be treated as particles" but doesn't specify. Hmm. Wait, let me re-read the question. 

The question is: "Of the charge Q on a tiny sphere, a fraction α is to be transferred to a second, nearby sphere." So that suggests that one sphere has charge Q, and the other is neutral. Then, a fraction α is transferred from the first sphere to the second. So the first sphere will lose α fraction of its charge, and the second will gain that fraction.

Wait, so the first sphere, which had Q, will have charge (1-α)Q left. The second sphere, which starts at 0, will have α Q. So, the charges after transfer are q1 = (1-α)Q, q2 = α Q.

The force F would then be k * (q1 * q2) / r². Since r is the distance between them, and assuming it's fixed or same for both, the force is proportional to (q1 q2). So to maximize F, we need to maximize (q1 q2).

So, F ∝ (1-α) Q * α Q = α (1-α) Q². The Q² terms are constants, so the product is proportional to α(1-α). So, we need to maximize α(1-α).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check—because in the question, it says the spheres are "nearby," so perhaps the distance isn't fixed, but the problem probably simplifies it as a fixed distance since the force's magnitude is being considered. So the distance doesn't affect the ratio, so maximizing the product of charges gives the maximum force.

So, the product α (1−α) is a quadratic in α. It's a parabola opening downward, with maximum at α = 0.5. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have 0.5. Oh, the options are A:0.25, B:0.1, C:0.9, D:0.75, E:0.5, F:0.8, G:0.33, H:0.6, I:0.67, J:1. So E is 0.5, which is the maximum for the parabola. But wait, that's not an option, because the product is maximum at α=0.5. Let me see the options. Oh wait, option E is 0.5, so that's the maximum. But wait, the question is about maximizing F, which depends on the product. So the maximum product is achieved at α=0.5, which is option E. So why is the question even asking this? Because it's straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because the problem says "a fraction α is to be transferred to a second, nearby sphere." So perhaps more accurately, one sphere gives alpha fraction of its charge to the other. So, the initial charges are Q and 0. So, the first sphere's charge becomes (1-α)Q, and the second becomes αQ. So then, the product is (1-α) * α.

The product of (1-α) and alpha is a quadratic function which peaks at α=0.5, as I thought. So the maximum force occurs at alpha=0.5, which is option E. So why would the options not include 0.5? Wait, no, the options do include E:0.5. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options in the problem go up to 1, but the correct maximum is at 0.5. So the answer should be E, 0.5. But wait, looking at the options, option E is 0.5, which is the correct maximum. So why is option E the correct answer? So that's the choice.

To determine the value of α that maximizes the electrostatic force \( F \) between the two spheres, we use Coulomb's law, which states:

\[
F \propto \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}
\]

Here, the distance \( r \) is fixed, so \( F \propto q_1 q_2 \). Initially, one sphere has charge \( Q \), and the other is neutral. After transferring a fraction \( \alpha \) of the charge \( Q \) from the first sphere to the second, the charges on the spheres become:

\[
q_1 = (1 - \alpha)Q, \quad q_2 = \alpha Q
\]

The product of the charges is:

\[
q_1 q_2 = \alpha (1 - \alpha) Q^2
\]

To maximize \( F \), we need to maximize \( \alpha (1 - \alpha) \). This is a quadratic function in \( \alpha \) that opens downward, with its maximum at \( \alpha = 0.5 \). This corresponds to the value of \( \alpha \) where the product \( \alpha (1 - \alpha) \) is maximized.

Examining the options provided:
- \( \alpha = 0.5 \) (option E) is the value where the force is maximized.

Thus, the answer is:

**ANSWER: E**
