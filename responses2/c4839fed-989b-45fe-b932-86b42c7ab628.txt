Okay, so I have this problem here where I'm given two functions, f(x) and g(x), and I need to find the inverse of h(x), which is f(g(x)). Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that h(x) is the composition of f and g. So h(x) = f(g(x)). Let me write out both functions:

f(x) = 3x + 4
g(x) = 2x - 3

So substituting g(x) into f, I get h(x) = 3*(2x - 3) + 4. Let me compute that.

3*(2x -3) is 6x -9. Adding 4 gives 6x -5. So h(x) simplifies to 6x -5. 

Now, I need to find the inverse function of h(x). The inverse function, h⁻¹(x), is a function that, when composed with h(x), gives the identity function. That is, h(h⁻¹(x)) = x and h⁻¹(h(x)) = x. 

To find the inverse, I'll follow standard procedure. Let me set y = h(x), so y = 6x -5. Then I need to solve for x in terms of y.

So, starting with y = 6x -5. I'll add 5 to both sides: y +5 = 6x. Then divide both sides by 6: x = (y +5)/6.

Therefore, the inverse function h⁻¹(y) is (y +5)/6. But since we usually write functions in terms of x, we can replace y with x. So h⁻¹(x) = (x +5)/6.

Now, looking at the options, let me check what I have. Option F is (x +3)/6, which doesn't match. Option G is (x+5)/3. Option H is (x+5)/6. Option I is (x+7)/6. Option J is (x-3)/6. Option A is (x-5)/6, B is (x-7)/6, C is (x-5)/3, D is (x-3)/3, E is (x+3)/3, and F is (x+3)/6.

Wait, I have (x +5)/6, which is option H. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with h(x) = 6x -5. Swap x and y: x = 6y -5. Then solve for y:

x +5 = 6y → y = (x +5)/6. Yes, that's correct.

So the inverse is (x +5)/6, which is option H. So in the options, that's H.

The inverse of \( h(x) \) is found by solving \( y = 6x - 5 \) for \( x \), resulting in \( x = \frac{y + 5}{6} \). Thus, the inverse function is \( \frac{x + 5}{6} \), which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
