Answer:

Okay, so I need to figure out what the fifth person would say if they liked the movie despite what others said. Let's break this down.

First, there are five people watching a movie. Four of them say the movie was terrible. That's a big negative statement. The fifth person said they liked the movie. Now, the question is what would the fifth person probably say.

I think about the context here. If four people are critical, the fifth person is likely someone who felt the movie was better than the others thought. But how would they phrase it? The options are A to J.

Option C says, "I liked the movie, despite what others think." That sounds like a direct response, acknowledging their own feelings. Option I says, "The movie had its moments but wasn't great overall." That also implies that they liked some parts but not the whole thing.

Option E is, "The movie was not as bad as you're saying." That's a bit more general. Option A is a strong negative, which doesn't fit because the fifth person is likely positive.

Option J is, "Everyone has their own taste in movies." That's a positive statement about their own opinion, which fits because the fifth person is expressing their own preference despite others' opinions.

Wait, but the question is about what the fifth person probably says. So, if the fifth person liked the movie despite others thinking it was bad, which option fits best.

Option C is a direct statement of their liking. Option I is more about their overall impression, but they said they liked it despite what others thought. So, C seems to directly convey their own opinion.

The fifth person would likely express their own positive sentiment, like option C: "I liked the movie, despite what others think." This directly reflects their own preference despite the negative remarks.

Answer: C
