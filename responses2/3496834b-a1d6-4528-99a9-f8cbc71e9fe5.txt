Okay, so I've got this gas problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about the volume of gaseous krypton when its temperature changes. I remember that gas laws have to do with pressure, volume, and temperature. Oh right, Charles's Law comes into play when pressure is constant.

Wait, so Charles's Law says that volume is directly proportional to temperature when pressure is constant. The formula is V1/T1 = V2/T2, where V is volume and T is temperature in Kelvin. Oh, right, because the volume and temperature change but pressure stays the same.

The question says the sample is kept at constant pressure, which matches Charles's Law scenario. So, I can apply the law here. 

The initial conditions are V1 = 10.5 liters, temperature T1 is 25°C. Wait, but in gas laws, temperature must be in Kelvin. So I need to convert 25°C to Kelvin. Kelvin is Celsius plus 273.15. So 25 +273.15 is 298.15 K. Got that.

The final temperature is 250°C. Let me convert that to Kelvin as well. 250 + 273.15 is 523.15 K.

So plugging into the equation: V2 = V1 * (T2 / T1). That's because V1/T1 = V2/T2, so V2 = V1 * (T2/T1).

Let me calculate that. V1 is 10.5 L, T2 is 523.15 K, T1 is 298.15 K.

So V2 equals 10.5 * (523.15 / 298.15). Let me compute 523.15 divided by 298.15. Hmm, roughly, 298 is about a third of 900. Wait, 298 times 1.75 is 521.5, because 298 * 1.75 = (300-2)*1.75 = 525 - 3.5 = 521.5, which is close to 523.15. So the division is approximately 1.75.

Wait, wait, let me calculate more accurately. Let me divide 523.15 by 298.15. Let me do 523.15 ÷ 298.15.

Divide 523.15 by 298.15:

298.15 * 1.75 = 521.5, as I said. So 1.75 gives 521.5. The difference between 523.15 and 521.5 is 1.65. So how much more than 1.75 do I need? Since 298.15 * x = 1.75 + (1.65 / 298.15), which is about 1.75 + 0.00553 ≈ 1.7555.

Wait, maybe I should use actual division.

Let me think: 298.15 * 1.75 = 521.575.

But 523.15 is 1.575 more than 521.575. So, 1.75 + (1.575 / 298.15).

What's 1.575 divided by 298.15? Let me compute that.

1.575 / 298.15 ≈ 0.005288.

So approximately 1.755288.

So T2 / T1 is approximately 1.7553.

So V2 = 10.5 L * 1.7553.

10.5 * 1.7553. Let's compute 10 * 1.7553 = 17.553, and 0.5 *1.7553= 0.87765. Adding them together: 17.553 + 0.87765 = 18.43065 L.

So approximately 18.43 liters. Now looking at the options, option D is 18.41 l, which is very close. So the answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because sometimes when using approximate numbers, the result may not match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the division is more precise.

Alternatively, I can compute 523.15 / 298.15 using a calculator method, but without one, perhaps I can make a better approximation.

Wait, 298.15 * 1.75 = 521.575 L, as before.

So 523.15 is 1.575 more. So 1.575 ÷ 298.15 = (1.575 / 298.15) ≈ 0.00529.

So the ratio is approximately 1.75529.

So V2 = 10.5 * 1.75529.

Let me compute 10.5 * 1.75529.

10 * 1.75529 = 17.5529.

0.5 *1.75529= 0.877645.

Adding them gives 18.4305 L. So about 18.43 L.

Looking at the options, D is 18.41, so that's the closest. But wait, maybe I did a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should use exact decimal points.

Wait, another way is to use the exact temperatures in Kelvin.

Temperature initial: 25°C = 298.15 K.

Final temp: 250°C = 523.15 K.

So the ratio is 523.15 / 298.15 ≈ 1.7553.

Multiply by 10.5 L:

10.5 * 1.7553 = ? Let's compute:

10 * 1.7553 = 17.553.

0.5 *1.7553 = 0.87765.

Adding: 17.553 + 0.87765 = 18.43065 L.

So about 18.43 L. The options have D as 18.41, which is very close. So the correct answer is D.

To solve the problem, we use Charles's Law, which states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature when pressure is constant. The formula is:

\[
\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}
\]

where \(V_1\) and \(T_1\) are the initial volume and temperature, and \(V_2\) and \(T_2\) are the final volume and temperature. The temperatures must be in Kelvin, so:

- Initial temperature: \(T_1 = 25^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 298.15 \, \text{K}\)
- Final temperature: \(T_2 = 250^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 523.15 \, \text{K}\)

Rearranging the formula to solve for \(V_2\):

\[
V_2 = V_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
V_2 = 10.5 \, \text{L} \cdot \frac{523.15 \, \text{K}}{298.15 \, \text{K}} \approx 10.5 \cdot 1.7553 \approx 18.43 \, \text{L}
\]

The closest option to \(18.43 \, \text{L}\) is \(18.41 \, \text{L}\), which corresponds to option D.
