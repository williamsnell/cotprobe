Okay, so I've got this question about diffusion coefficients and how long it takes molecules to move a certain distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through.

The question says the diffusion coefficient D is 1.0e-11 m²/s. The distance is 1.0 micrometers, which is 1e-6 meters. I remember the formula for diffusion is Fick's second law, which for a simple one-dimensional case, the mean square displacement is D multiplied by t. Oh wait, the mean square distance is given by ⟨x²⟩ = 4 D t. So to find the time t, I can rearrange that equation.

So the formula I need is t = ⟨x²⟩ / (4 D). Oh wait, right, because 4 is a factor from the end of the integral in the solution of the diffusion equation.

Let me plug in the numbers. ⟨x²⟩ is (1 micrometer)^2, which is (1e-6 m)^2 = 1e-12 m². D is 1e-11 m²/s. So t = (1e-12) / (4 * 1e-11). Let's calculate that.

Wait, 1e-12 divided by 4e-11. Let me compute that. 1e-12 is 0.1e-11. So 0.1e-11 divided by 4e-11 is 0.1/4 = 0.025 seconds. Oh wait, 0.025 seconds is 2.5e-2 seconds. Looking at the options, option H is 2.5e-2 s. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Oh, wait a second, no. Oh no, wait, wait. Because I thought the mean square distance is ⟨x²⟩, which is 4 D t. So the time is ⟨x²⟩/(4 D). So yeah, that's right.

Another way to think about it: if I have D=1e-11, and x=1e-6, then x squared is 1e-12. So (1e-12) / (4 * 1e-11) = (1e-12)/(4e-11) = (1/4) * 1e-12/1e-11 = (1/4) * 0.1 = 0.025 seconds, which is 2.5e-2 s. So option H is correct.

To determine the time it takes for molecules to diffuse from the cell nucleus to the cell wall, we use the formula for the mean square distance:

\[
\langle x^2 \rangle = 4 D t
\]

Rearranging for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{\langle x^2 \rangle}{4 D}
\]

Given:
- \( D = 1.0 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{m}^2/\mathrm{s} \)
- \( \langle x^2 \rangle = (1.0 \, \mu\mathrm{m})^2 = (1.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m})^2 = 1.0 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{m}^2 \)

Substituting the values:

\[
t = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-12}}{4 \times 1.0 \times 10^{-11}} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-12}}{4.0 \times 10^{-11}} = \frac{1.0}{4.0} \times 10^{-1} = 0.25 \times 10^{-1} = 2.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}
\]

Thus, the time is \( 2.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \mathrm{s} \), which corresponds to option **H**.

ANSWER: H
