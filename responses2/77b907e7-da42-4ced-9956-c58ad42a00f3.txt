Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about group theory, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down.

The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2. Then there are options A through J, each giving a possible answer about the truth values of these statements under certain conditions. My job is to determine which option is correct.

First, let's understand Statement 1: If a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b, then a² is not equal to b². Hmm. Does this hold true in all groups?

I remember that in some groups, like abelian groups, if a ≠ b, then a² might still equal b². For example, in the group Z_2, which is cyclic of order 2, the elements are 0 and 1. 0² is 0, and 1² is 1, which are different. But wait, maybe another example. Let's consider the Klein four-group, which is non-abelian. The elements are {e, a, b, c}, where a² = e, b² = e, etc. So if a ≠ b, then a² and b² are both e. So in this case, a² = b², but a ≠ b. So Statement 1 is false in this case. Therefore, Statement 1 is not always true. So Statement 1 is false.

Now, Statement 2: The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup. Wait, what's a dihedral group? Oh right, the dihedral group D_n has 2n elements: n rotations and n reflections. The rotations form a cyclic subgroup of order n. Because rotations can be thought of as adding a fixed angle each time, so it's cyclic. So Statement 2 is true. So in dihedral groups, the rotations form a cyclic subgroup. So Statement 2 is true.

Now, the options are about the truth values of the two statements. Let's look at the options.

Looking at the options, each option gives a pair: (True, True), (True, False), etc.

We need to evaluate whether Statement 1 is true or false, and Statement 2 is true or false.

From earlier, Statement 1 is false because I found a counterexample in the Klein four-group. So Statement 1 is false.

Statement 2 is true because in dihedral groups, the rotations form a cyclic subgroup. So, now, the options must evaluate these statements.

Looking at the options:

Option F: True, True. So if both statements are true, it would be F. But wait, no. Wait, no—wait, let me recheck.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no. Wait, the options are about the truth of the statements. So if Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true, then which option matches that?

Let me look again.

Option F says: True, True. Wait, no, that's impossible because Statement 1 is false. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait no—Wait, I thought Statement 1 was false. So the options would be:

Looking at each option:

Option A: False, True only for Abelian groups. No, because if the group is non-abelian, Statement 1 can be false. So A is incorrect.

Option B: True, True only if a and b are inverses. But Statement 2 is true regardless, so B is incorrect.

Option C: False, False only if a and b are not inverses. Wait, Statement 1 is False, so the first part is correct. But when does Statement 1 become False? Well, when a² = b² even when a≠b. So Statement 1's truth depends on the group. So C says that Statement 1 is False only if a and b are not inverses. But that's not necessarily the case. For example, in the Klein four-group, a and b can be two different elements, their squares are equal, but a and b are not inverses. So C is incorrect because Statement 1 can be false even when a and b are inverses.

Option D: True, False. Wait, Statement 2 is True, so D's second part is False, which can't be. So D is incorrect.

Option E: True, False only for non-cyclic groups. No, because Statement 2 is always true, so E is wrong.

Option F: True, True. No, because Statement 1 is false.

Wait, this doesn't add up because all options except F would have at least one false. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating Statement 1.

Wait, let me re-examine Statement 1. Statement 1 says that if a and b are elements of a group and a ≠ b, then a² ≠ b². I thought of the Klein four-group, where a and b are different but their squares are equal. So in that group, a² equals b² when a ≠ b. So the statement is false. So Statement 1 is false.

Statement 2 is true. So the options must have both statements as true. But looking back at the options:

Option F is (True, True). So if both statements are true, then option F is correct. But wait, in the options, option F says: True, True only if a and b are inverses. Wait, no, option F says both statements are true, regardless.

Wait, no—Wait, no, I think I mixed up the options. Let me re-examine the options.

Wait, the options are:

A: False, True only for Abelian groups.

B: True, True only if a and b are inverses.

C: False, False only if a and b are not inverses.

D: True, False.

E: True, False only for non-cyclic groups.

F: True, True.

G: False, True.

H: True, True only for non-Abelian groups.

I: False, False.

J: False, True only for groups of even order.

Wait, no, option F is (True, True). So both statements are true. So if that's the case, let me check again.

Wait, but in the dihedral group, the rotations form a cyclic subgroup. So Statement 2 is true. So the overall answer would be that both statements are true, so option F.

But wait, earlier I thought that Option D's second part is False. Let me double-check.

Option D is: True, False. That would mean Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false. But that's incorrect because Statement 2 is true, so D is wrong.

Similarly, option F says, "True, True only if...", but the 'only if' is perhaps a way to phrase whether the statement's truth depends on certain conditions. But since both are true, the condition is irrelevant. So option F is correct.

Wait, but wait—no, wait. Let me make sure. Because in the dihedral group, the rotations form a cyclic subgroup. So Statement 2 is correct. So, if both statements are correct, then the option is F.

But earlier I thought that the options might have different meanings. So what's the correct option?

Wait, but looking back, the options are about the truth of the two statements. So if both are true, the correct option is F.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement: the options are about the truth of the two statements. So if both statements are true, then which option is correct.

Now, the options are:

F: True, True.

So, the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me check each option again.

Option F says: True, True. So the first part is true, the second part is true. So the pair is (True, True), which is F.

So the correct answer would be F.

But wait, wait a second. Let me re-examine Statement 1. Oh! Wait a minute. The statement says: "If a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b, then a² is not equal to b²."

But in abelian groups, this holds because if a² = b², then a = b since in abelian groups, you can subtract a from both sides. But in non-abelian groups, this might not hold. For example, in the Klein four-group, as I thought earlier, a ≠ b but a² = b².

So Statement 1 is not universally true. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.

So both statements are: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. So in the options, option F is (True, True), which would mean both statements are true. But according to what I just thought, Statement 1 is false, so option F is incorrect.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The options are about whether each statement is true or false. So if both statements are true, then the correct option is F. Since I think Statement 2 is true and Statement 1 is false, then this would be correct if both are true, which would be F. But that's a contradiction because I thought Statement 1 is false.

Wait, no. No, wait. I think I made a mistake in the beginning. Let me reevaluate Statement 1.

Wait, I thought Statement 1 is false because in the Klein four-group, a and b are different elements, but a² = b², which would mean a² = e and b² = e. So a² and b² are equal even though a and b are different. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.

So, since Statement 1 is false, the pair is (False, True). Looking back at the options:

Option F: (True, True) → this would be correct if both statements are true, but in reality, Statement 1 is false.

Wait, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating Statement 1.

Wait, let me think again. Statement 1 says: If a and b are elements of a group and a ≠ b, then a² ≠ b².

In the Klein four-group, a and b are elements where a ≠ b but a² = e and b² = e. So a² equals b² even though a and b are different. Therefore, in this case, the premise (a ≠ b) is true, but the conclusion (a² ≠ b²) is false. So the implication is false because the premise is true, the conclusion is false. So the implication is false. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.

So, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. Therefore, the pair is (False, True). But looking at the options, where is this pair? Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

F: True, True → (True, True) → no.

Wait, no, I think I got confused. Let me list the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: False, True only for Abelian groups → false, true.

B: True, True only if a and b are inverses → both true when a and b are inverses.

C: False, False only if a and b are not inverses → both false when a and b are not inverses.

D: True, False → (True, False)

E: True, False only for non-cyclic groups → both true only when the group is cyclic.

F: True, True → (True, True)

G: False, True → (False, True)

H: True, True only for non-Abelian → both true when group is non-Abelian.

I: False, False → (False, False)

J: False, True only for groups of even order → (False, True)

Wait, so I'm looking for a pair where the first part is false and the second part is true. So which option is that?

Looking at the options:

Option F: True, True → no, both are true.

Option G: False, True → (False, True). So this is a possible correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true. So (False, True) → which is option G.

But earlier, I thought that the correct option would be F, which is (True, True). But that's incorrect because Statement 1 is false.

Wait, no, now I'm getting confused. Let me recheck.

So, now I'm getting that Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. So the correct option is G: (False, True). But wait, looking at the options again, the options are as listed.

Wait, the options are:

A: False, True only for Abelian groups.

B: True, True only if a and b are inverses.

C: False, False only if a and b are not inverses.

D: True, False.

E: True, False only for non-cyclic groups.

F: True, True.

G: False, True.

H: True, True only for non-Abelian.

I: False, False.

J: False, True only for groups of even order.

Wait, no. The way the options are presented is: each option is a pair (x, y), where x is the truth value of Statement 1, y is the truth value of Statement 2.

So, if Statement 1 is False, and Statement 2 is True, the correct option is G: False, True.

But earlier, I thought that the correct answer is F, but that's because I thought Statement 2 is true. But wait, that can't be. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, let me look again.

Wait, in the dihedral group, the rotations form a cyclic subgroup. So Statement 2 is true. So, if Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true, the correct option would be G: (False, True).

But wait, looking back, the options are:

Looking for the correct pair.

Wait, the options are:

F: (True, True) → both statements are true.

G: (False, True) → Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true.

So, if the statements are:

Statement 1: False.

Statement 2: True.

Thus, the correct option is G.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the correct answer is F, which is (True, True). So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me look for the correct option again.

So Option F: (True, True) → both statements are true. But that can't be, because Statement 1 is false.

Wait, no, no. Because in the dihedral group, Statement 2 is true, but Statement 1 is false. So the correct option is G: (False, True).

But wait, I'm getting conflicting information. Let me check each option.

Looking at the options:

Option F: True, True. → Both statements true.

Option G: False, True. → Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is True.

So, in the problem, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. So the correct option is G.

But wait, looking back, I thought that in the group of even order, some things happen. But that's about Statement 2. Oh, wait, no. Statement 2 is about the rotations in a dihedral group. So if the dihedral group is of order 2n, and the rotations are of order n, so the rotations form a cyclic subgroup of order n. So Statement 2 is correct.

Therefore, the correct option is G: False, True.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the correct answer would be F, but that was incorrect.

So the correct answer is option G.

The question evaluates two statements about group theory. 

1. **Statement 1**: If \( a \) and \( b \) are elements of a group and \( a \neq b \), then \( a^2 \neq b^2 \).  
   - This is false. A counterexample can be found in the Klein four-group, where \( a \neq b \) but \( a^2 = b^2 = e \), the identity element.

2. **Statement 2**: The set of rotations in a dihedral group forms a cyclic subgroup.  
   - This is true. The rotations form a cyclic subgroup of order \( n \), where \( n \) is the order of the dihedral group.

Given these evaluations, Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true. Thus, the correct option is **G: False, True**.
