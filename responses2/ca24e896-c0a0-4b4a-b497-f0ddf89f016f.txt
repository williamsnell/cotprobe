Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question says: Suppose the economy is operating beyond full employment. Which of the following is true at this point?

The options are A through J, each giving different scenarios or statements.

I remember that beyond full employment means the economy is in a situation where it's producing more than the natural level of output. The natural rate of unemployment is the rate at which the economy is producing at full employment without any cyclical fluctuations.

So when the economy is beyond full employment, it's probably in a situation of overheating, which means there's excess capacity. Excess capacity implies that potential GDP is higher than actual output. So, potential GDP is the level of output that society can produce when all resources are fully utilized, regardless of the price level.

Now, looking at the options one by one.

Option A: The government should implement policies to increase aggregate demand. Hmm. If the economy is over full employment, maybe the government could stimulate it by increasing expenditure or reducing taxes. But I'm not sure if this is the best approach. Alternatively, maybe the economy is already at a point where they can increase demand to move towards full employment. Or perhaps the government's role might be limited, and it's the private sector that can take over. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think this is a possibility.

Option B: The short-run aggregate supply curve is horizontal. Wait, that's not right. The short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve is typically upward sloping. It shows that as the price level increases, more goods and services can be produced. So if the economy is beyond full employment, SRAS is probably not horizontal. So option B is incorrect.

Option C: Further increases in aggregate demand will decrease inflation. Hmm. If the economy is past full employment, increasing AD might help. But when the economy is over the natural level, perhaps increasing AD can lead to lower unemployment but what about inflation? I think that when the economy is overheating, increasing AD could cause inflationary pressures. Wait, but if the economy is beyond full employment, maybe the AS curve is horizontal. So if AD increases, in the short run, the output could rise, but prices might not rise much because AS is horizontal. Wait, but if the economy is already past full employment, maybe the SRAS is flat, so increasing AD would just raise output without much price increase. So in that case, C says that further AD increases would lower inflation. Wait, no, if AS is horizontal, then higher AD would lead to higher prices, not lower. So C might be wrong.

Option D: Further increases in AD will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation. Hmm, if the economy is beyond full employment, the natural rate of unemployment is below actual. So increasing AD would bring in more goods, but if the economy is already over full employment, perhaps the AD increases lead to higher prices without lower unemployment. But wait, in the short run, after full employment is already achieved, increasing AD would lead to higher output, but what about the unemployment rate? Since it's past full employment, the unemployment rate might not drop because the economy is producing more but not necessarily less. So perhaps D is correct. Or wait, maybe in the short run, increasing AD leads to higher prices but same unemployment since it's beyond full employment. So the unemployment rate might not lower—so if the economy is already at full employment, increasing AD would just push more into production but not create more jobs. So in that case, option D says further AD increases will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation. That would mean higher prices. So D is correct.

Option E: The economy will naturally return to full employment without any intervention. No, that's the natural long-run equilibrium. But the question is about the current state (beyond full), so this is not correct. So E is incorrect.

Option F: A decrease in aggregate demand will result in a lower price level if prices are sticky. I think that if prices are sticky, a decrease in AD would lead to lower output, and if prices are sticky, it would cause a lower price level. So F is correct.

Option G: The short-run aggregate supply is vertical. No, that's incorrect. SRAS is upward sloping in the short run because as the price level increases, more goods can be produced. So G is wrong.

Option H: The economy is at risk of entering a recession. No, because the economy is past full employment. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Further increases in AD will result in a lower price level. Wait, if the economy is past full employment, the SRAS is horizontal, and increasing AD would cause higher output without affecting the price level. So prices would stay same, not lower. So I is incorrect.

Option J: A decrease in AD will lead to an increase in price level. Hmm, if AD decreases, and prices are sticky, then without price adjustment, the decrease in AD would cause output to fall. But if prices are sticky, the fall in price level might occur. So J is correct.

Wait, so let me reevaluate.

The question is, when the economy is beyond full employment, what is true.

So beyond full employment means that the economy is producing at a level higher than natural output.

In the short run, the economy's potential GDP is higher than current output. So the SRAS is horizontal, and it's not the long run.

So, options that are true.

Option B: SRAS is horizontal? No, because if the economy is past full employment, the SRAS is horizontal. Wait, no, SRAS is horizontal when the economy is at potential, which is beyond full employment. So option B is incorrect.

Options:

A: Increase AD? Maybe, but beyond full employment, maybe they want to get to full employment, not necessarily increase AD. So A is a possible statement, but not necessarily true.

Option D: Further increases in AD will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation. Let me think. If the economy is already past full employment, increasing AD would lead to higher output but same or lower unemployment. Because in the initial phase, decreasing AD would lower output, but when past full employment is achieved, increasing AD would just push more into production without reducing the number of jobs. So the unemployment rate might not lower. So D says further AD increases won't lower unemployment but would create inflation. That seems correct. So D is correct.

Option F: If prices are sticky, a decrease in AD would lower output, and lower prices. So F is correct.

Option J: If AD decreases and prices are sticky, output falls, prices fall. So J is correct.

Wait, so what's the question again: the question is, which of the following is true when the economy is beyond full employment.

So, which options are correct.

Looking again at each option.

So, beyond full employment implies that potential GDP is higher than current output. So the SRAS is horizontal.

Thus:

Option B: SRAS is horizontal. No, that's incorrect because the SRAS is horizontal in the short run when the economy is beyond full employment, but the natural rate is the point where SRAS is horizontal. So beyond full employment, the SRAS is horizontal, so B is incorrect.

Option D: Further AD increases won't lower unemployment, but create inflation. Yes, correct.

Option F: A decrease in AD will lead to lower price level if prices are sticky. Yes, correct.

Option J: A decrease in AD will lead to higher price level. No, if AD decreases and prices are sticky, but if prices are sticky, then when output decreases, prices don't adjust, so price level would go down. Wait, but according to the option J, a decrease in AD leads to higher price level. So that's incorrect.

Wait, no. Let me think: If prices are sticky, a decrease in AD would cause output to decrease. If prices are sticky, the decrease in output would lead to lower price level. So if AD decreases and prices are sticky, then the price level would drop. So option J says a decrease in AD would lead to a higher price level, which is incorrect.

So in that case, J is incorrect.

So which options are correct? Let's see.

Option D: Correct.

Option F: Correct.

Option J: Incorrect.

Hmm. Wait, so the options are each a statement that is either correct or incorrect. So which of the options are correct statements.

Now, looking again at the options:

The question is, which of the following is true at the current point.

So the correct statements are D, F, and J? No, because J is incorrect.

Wait, no. Let me recheck each option.

Option D: Further increases in AD will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation.

Since the economy is beyond full employment, if AD increases further, the output would rise, but the unemployment rate (the natural rate) would not change. But the question says 'will not lower the unemployment rate'—that's correct. But about inflation, when AD increases and the economy is past full employment, prices might not rise much. So option D's second part is incorrect, because it says 'will create inflation' which is not correct. So D is incorrect.

Wait, so my earlier analysis was wrong because D's second part is wrong.

Hmm. So which options are correct?

Option F: A decrease in AD will result in a lower price level if prices are sticky. Correct.

Option J: A decrease in AD will lead to an increase in the price level. No, because if prices are sticky, a decrease in AD would cause output to fall, but output will not adjust immediately, so the price level goes down. So J is incorrect.

So, which options are true?

Looking back:

Option D: Incorrect because it says AD increases will create inflation, which is wrong.

Option F: Correct.

Option J: Incorrect.

So the correct options are F and which others?

Wait, let's reevaluate each option.

Option I: Further increases in AD will result in a lower price level. No, because if the economy is past full employment, increasing AD would lead to higher output but same or lower prices. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Decrease in AD leads to higher price level. Incorrect.

Option B: SRAS is horizontal. No, because beyond full employment means the SRAS is horizontal (as the economy is producing at potential). So B is incorrect.

Option A: Increase AD to increase AD. But the economy is already beyond full employment, so maybe they should lower AD, not increase. So A is incorrect.

Option C: Further increases in AD will decrease inflation. No, because the SRAS is horizontal, so increasing AD would cause higher prices, so C is incorrect.

So the correct options are F and perhaps J? No, J is incorrect.

Wait, so is there any other correct option? Let me think.

Wait, another angle: The natural rate of unemployment is the rate at which the economy is producing at full employment without any cyclical fluctuations. So when the economy is beyond full employment, the natural rate is lower than the actual unemployment rate.

Wait, the natural rate is the rate of unemployment at full potential. So, when the economy is past full employment, potential is higher.

So, in the short run, if you increase AD, you get higher output. Suppose the economy is already past full employment, so increasing AD would just push output further up, but at the same time, the SRAS is horizontal. So in the short run, increasing AD would increase output but not change prices.

So, option D: "Further increases in AD will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation" — but wait, if AD increases, in the short run, the output would increase but unemployment will remain the same (assuming the natural rate is lower). So the unemployment rate would stay at the natural rate, not lower. So D's first part is correct (unemployment doesn't lower), but the second part is incorrect (it doesn't create inflation). So D is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the short-run and long-run effects.

In the short run, beyond full employment, the SRAS is horizontal. If AD increases, in the short run, output increases, but prices don't rise much because SRAS is flat. So, in the short run, the economy's output increases, but prices remain same (or maybe not rise at all). So the short-run equilibrium has higher output but same price level.

But in the long run, the SRAS shifts upward to meet AD. Or wait, no, if the economy is beyond full employment, the SRAS is horizontal. So in the long run, increasing AD would cause higher prices, but the output would adjust to full potential.

Wait, perhaps my initial analysis is wrong. Let me think again.

In the short run, if the economy is past full employment, the SRAS is horizontal. So, when AD increases, output increases, but prices remain the same. So in the short run, the economy can increase output without affecting the price level.

But in the long run, the SRAS shifts upward if potential is higher than current. So, the economy can get to higher potential output by increasing the SRAS.

So, going back to the options.

Option D: "Further increases in AD will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation." If the economy is past full employment, increasing AD in the short run would not lower unemployment. But in the long run, AD increases would push prices up. So in the short run, after increasing AD beyond full employment, output increases, so unemployment remains the same (if the economy is already above natural output). So in the short run, D's second part (creating inflation) is incorrect.

So D is incorrect.

Option F: "A decrease in aggregate demand will result in a lower price level if prices are sticky." Yes, that's correct. Because if prices are sticky, and AD decreases, output falls, leading to lower prices.

Option J: "A decrease in AD will lead to an increase in the price level." No, because if prices are sticky, a decrease in AD would lead to output falling, but prices don't adjust immediately. So the price level would decrease. So J is incorrect.

So, besides F, are there any other correct options?

Looking back, another option: Option E is incorrect because the economy is already past full employment.

So, among the options, the correct ones are E? But E says the economy will naturally return to full employment, which is not the case.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is which statements are true in the current situation (e.g., beyond full employment).

So, if the economy is beyond full employment, the correct options are F and perhaps J? No, J is incorrect.

Wait, what about option D: it says further increases in AD will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation. Since the economy is past full employment, in the short run, higher AD would cause higher output but not lower unemployment. So the unemployment rate would stay the same, not lower. So D's second part is incorrect. So D is not correct.

Looking at option F: A decrease in AD will lead to lower price level if prices are sticky. Correct. So F is correct.

Wait, but the question is, which of the following is true. So I have to choose the correct option(s).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me recheck the options.

Another approach: Think about the possible outcomes in each scenario.

At beyond full employment (current state):

1. Potential GDP is higher than current output.

2. SRAS is horizontal.

3. LRAS is higher than short-run SRAS.

A: Increase AD to increase output. But if AD is already beyond full employment, maybe they should lower AD, not increase. So A is incorrect.

B: SRAS is horizontal. Correct.

C: Further increases in AD will decrease inflation. No, because SRAS is horizontal, so prices would not decrease. So C is incorrect.

D: Further increases in AD will not lower unemployment but create inflation. Unemployment remains same, so D's second part is wrong. So D is incorrect.

E: The economy will naturally return to full employment. No.

F: A decrease in AD leads to lower price level if prices are sticky. Correct.

G: Short-run AS is vertical. No.

H: Economic recession. No.

I: Further AD increases lead to lower price level. No, because SRAS is horizontal, so prices don't change.

J: Decrease in AD leads to higher prices. No, because prices are sticky, so output falls, prices don't rise.

So, correct options are F and none else. Wait, but F is correct.

So the correct statements are F and possibly another. Wait, are there any others?

Wait, another point: The natural rate of unemployment is the rate at which potential GDP is produced. So, if the economy is past full employment, the natural rate is lower than the current unemployment rate.

So, further increases in AD, in the short run, would increase output without affecting prices. So in the short run, the economy would have higher output, but same price level.

In the long run, AD increases would shift the SRAS upward, leading to higher prices and output at potential.

Wait, but the question is about the current situation (beyond full employment). So the next question is what happens in the short run or long run.

But the options are general statements, not about future changes.

So, considering all that, the correct options are:

Option F: Correct.

Option D: Incorrect.

Option J: Incorrect.

So, the correct answer is F.
</think>

The economy is operating beyond full employment, meaning potential GDP exceeds current output. This situation implies the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve is horizontal, and the potential unemployment rate is lower than the current unemployment rate. Let’s analyze each option:

**A: The government should implement policies to increase aggregate demand.**  
This is incorrect because increasing aggregate demand further may not be the optimal approach, especially if the economy is already past full employment.

**B: The short-run aggregate supply curve is horizontal.**  
This is correct. Beyond full employment, the SRAS is horizontal, reflecting that output can increase without affecting the price level in the short run.

**C: Further increases in aggregate demand will decrease inflation.**  
This is incorrect. With potential GDP higher than current output, increasing AD in the short run does not lead to lower prices because the SRAS is horizontal.

**D: Further increases in aggregate demand will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation.**  
This is incorrect. In the short run, increasing AD increases output without lowering unemployment. However, the second part of the statement (creating inflation) is incorrect because prices remain unchanged in the short run.

**E: The economy will naturally return to full employment without any intervention.**  
This is incorrect because the economy already exceeds full employment, and there is no natural rate of unemployment in this context.

**F: A decrease in aggregate demand will result in a lower price level if prices are sticky.**  
This is correct. If prices are sticky, a decrease in AD leads to lower output, which in turn lowers the price level.

**G: The short-run aggregate supply curve is vertical.**  
This is incorrect. The short-run SRAS is horizontal when the economy is past full employment.

**H: The economy is at risk of entering a recession.**  
This is incorrect. The economy is not at risk of entering a recession; it is already past full employment.

**I: Further increases in aggregate demand will result in a lower price level.**  
This is incorrect. With potential GDP higher than current output, increasing AD in the short run does not lead to lower prices because the SRAS is horizontal.

**J: A decrease in aggregate demand will lead to an increase in the price level.**  
This is incorrect. If prices are sticky, a decrease in AD leads to lower output, which does not result in an increase in the price level.

**Conclusion:**  
The correct statement is **F**: A decrease in aggregate demand will result in a lower price level if prices are sticky.
