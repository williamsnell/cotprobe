Okay, so I've got this question about Drosophila and mutation of homeotic cluster genes leading to developmental defects. Hmm, let me think. I remember that homeotic cluster genes are involved in regulating the segmentation of the fruit fly embryo. Segmentation is the process where the body develops into distinct segments, like the body parts.

The question is asking about what happens when these genes are mutated. The options include various developmental defects. I think the key here is to remember what each defect implies.

Option A: Complete absence of segmentation. I don't recall that. Mutations in homeotic clusters might affect segmentation, but I don't think they eliminate it entirely. Like, maybe they cause defects but not complete lack.

Option B: Hindrance in the development of the nervous system. I'm not sure. I think these genes are important for proper segmentation and development, including the nervous system. If the clusters are messed up, maybe the nervous system can't develop properly. But I'm not certain.

Option C: Inability to undergo metamorphosis. Metamorphosis is when a segment changes into another, like in the fruit fly's metamorphosis from one body part to another. If the clusters are messed up, maybe this can't happen. I think this is a possibility.

Option D: Absence of a group of contiguous segments. If the clusters are mutated, maybe the embryo can't form the proper segments. So if they're in clusters, perhaps the normal arrangement of segments is disrupted, leading to a group being missing. This could mean the segments aren't contiguous.

Option E: Tumor formation in imaginal discs. That sounds more like a cancer issue. I don't think mutations in these genes would cause tumors. Maybe this is a different cause, like a genetic mutation leading to cancer.

Option F: Formation of extra segments. Oh, wait, that's more about errors in segmentation. Like, if the clusters can't form the right segments, maybe extra ones are formed. So this would imply the embryo has more segments than it should, leading to extra pieces.

Option G: Polarity defects in every segment. Polarity is about direction in each segment, like left and right. If the clusters are messed up, each segment might have issues with polarity, leading to that defect.

Option H: Transformation of one segment into another. That would mean a segment changes into another, leading to problems. So like, the embryo's not undergoing proper metamorphosis.

Option I: Transformation of the posterior segment into the anterior. Similar to H, but specifically about posterior to anterior.

Option J: Inability to form imaginal discs. I'm not too sure about this. I think the homeotic clusters are involved in the segmentation and normal development, including the formation of the imaginal discs. So mutation here might prevent that, but I'm not certain.

Wait, thinking again. The question is about the 'mutation of homeotic cluster genes often results in which developmental defects.' These mutations can lead to various abnormalities. For example, mutations in the homeotic genes might cause defects in the formation of the body plan, leading to issues in segmentation.

I remember that when clusters are defective, the embryo might have improper segments, leading to defects like inability to undergo metamorphosis. Also, if the clusters are messed up, the proper formation of body segments is disrupted, so the embryo might not form the correct number or arrangement of segments. For example, if you have too many segments or too few, that causes issues.

In terms of segmentation defects, one possibility is that the clusters prevent the proper formation of the body plan, leading to segments not being contiguous or the body not properly divided into segments. So option D says the absence of a group of contiguous segments. That could be a result.

Wait, another thought: if the homeotic clusters are mutated, the embryo might not properly form the body segments. So, for example, maybe each segment can't form correctly, leading to either fewer or more segments, or their arrangement is disrupted.

Another possibility is that the clusters prevent proper segmentation, leading to defects like inability to undergo metamorphosis. Metamorphosis is the ability for a part to change into another, like the process of development in fruit flies. So if the clusters are not working, this process can't happen, leading to option C.

Alternatively, if the clusters are not working, the embryo might not form the correct body plan, leading to defects in every segment, which could be option G for each segment having polarity issues.

Wait, let me think about each option.

Option C is inability to undergo metamorphosis. Metamorphosis is when segments change into each other. If clusters are messed up, the segments can't undergo this process. So this would be a defect that prevents that transformation.

Option D is absence of contiguous segments. If the clusters prevent proper segmentation, maybe you don't get all the necessary segments, so if you have a group that's missing, that's option D.

I think I remember that mutations in the homeotic cluster genes can lead to defects in the formation of the body plan, which includes issues in segmentation. These defects can lead to things like no proper group of segments, or inability to undergo metamorphosis, which is option C.

Wait, another angle: the question is about which defects are often caused by mutations. I think that the primary defect is the inability to undergo metamorphosis, which is option C.

So, the correct answer would be C: Inability to undergo metamorphosis.

The question asks about the developmental defects in Drosophila caused by mutations in homeotic cluster genes. Homeotic cluster genes are crucial for proper segmentation and development, including the proper formation of body segments and the normal development of the nervous system. Mutations in these genes can disrupt the proper formation of the body plan, leading to various abnormalities.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Complete absence of segmentation** is unlikely, as mutations in homeotic clusters do not eliminate segmentation entirely.
- **B: Hindrance in the development of the nervous system** seems less likely, as the cluster genes are essential for proper segmentation and development.
- **C: Inability to undergo metamorphosis** is a strong possibility, as this defect involves the transformation of one segment into another, which can result from improper cluster mutations.
- **D: Absence of a group of contiguous segments** could occur if the clusters prevent proper segmentation, leading to missing segments.
- **E: Tumor formation in imaginal discs** is not related to cluster mutations and is more likely associated with cancer.
- **F: Formation of extra segments** suggests errors in segmentation, which could happen due to cluster mutations.
- **G: Polarity defects in every segment** could arise if the clusters disrupt each segment's ability to form polarity.
- **H: Transformation of one segment into another** is a specific defect related to cluster mutations.
- **I: Transformation of the posterior segment into the anterior** is another specific defect.
- **J: Inability to form imaginal discs** is less likely, as the cluster genes are involved in proper disc formation.
- **C: Inability to undergo metamorphosis** is the most likely outcome of cluster mutations, as it directly relates to the inability of segments to change into each other.

The most accurate answer is **C: Inability to undergo metamorphosis**, as it directly aligns with the potential effects of mutations in these genes.
