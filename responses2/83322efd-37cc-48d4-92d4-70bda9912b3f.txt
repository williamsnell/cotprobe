D: observing a person or object closely to identify details
E: visually inspecting a construction site for safety hazards
F: looking at a problem and guessing the solution based on experience

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is about what "eyeballing" is. I'm not super familiar with the term, but I think it's a technique people use. Let me go through each option.

Option A says estimating measurements by sight without tools. Hmm, I've heard of this before. It's like when you're rough with numbers but don't have a calculator. So maybe that's correct.

Option B is about keeping eyes on participants. That sounds more like active observation, not just a quick technique. I don't think that's what 'eyeballing' refers to.

Option C is reading quickly to understand a gist. That's more like skimming or reading comprehension, not specifically a technique. I don't think that's what it's referring to.

Option D is observing closely to identify details. That sounds familiar. I've heard that people often use this to quickly get a gist of a document or report without reading the whole thing.

Option E is about inspecting a site for safety hazards. That seems more like a specialized technique, maybe for someone in construction or safety.

Option F: guessing the solution based on experience. That's more about problem-solving and past knowledge, not exactly a technique for measurement or observation.

Option G is gathering a sample from public places. That sounds like a sampling technique, not specifically about what you can see.

Option H is quickly reading a paper to identify main arguments. That's similar to option D, but focused on reading for arguments. It's not the same as just observing quickly.

Option I is looking for potential risks. That's a bit broader, but maybe related to risk assessment. I'm not sure if it's a specific technique.

Option J is scanning a table for patterns. That seems more like data analysis or pattern recognition, not a specific technique I'm familiar with.

So, putting it together. 'Eyeballing' is about estimating quickly without tools, which is option A. The other options are more about active observations or specific tasks.

The correct answer is A: estimating measurements by sight without using tools.
