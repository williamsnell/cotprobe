Okay, so I've got this problem here about Kate's coin collection. Let me try to figure it out. The question says she keeps 7 coins in a box, and that 7 is 5% of her entire collection. I need to find out the total number of coins she has.

Hmm, percentages can sometimes be tricky, but I think I remember that "percent" means "per hundred." So if 7 coins are 5%, then 1% of the collection would be 7 divided by 5. Let me write that down. So, 1% = 7 / 5. Let me calculate that: 7 divided by 5 is 1.4. So, 1% equals 1.4 coins. 

Wait, that seems a bit odd because you can't have a fraction of a coin in this context. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think about it as an equation. If 5% is 7 coins, then 100% (the total) is what we need to find. So, 5% is 7, so 1% is 1.4, so 100% is 1.4 multiplied by 100, which is 140. Oh, that makes sense. So the total number of coins would be 140.

Looking at the options, option F is 140. So I think that's the answer. Let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Alternatively, I can set up the equation: 5% of total coins = 7. So, 0.05 * total = 7. Solving for total gives total = 7 / 0.05. 7 divided by 0.05 is the same as 7 * 20, which is 140. Yep, that matches what I did earlier. So I'm confident the answer is 140, which is option F.

The total number of coins in Kate’s collection is calculated by determining what 100% corresponds to if 7 coins represent 5%. 

Using the equation:
5% = 7 coins  
100% = (7 coins) / 5% * 100% = 140 coins.

**Answer: F: 140**
