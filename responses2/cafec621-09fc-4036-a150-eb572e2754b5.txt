Okay, so I've got this question about parallel computing. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when you have a program that runs on multiple processors, the speedup depends on how much of the workload is inherently sequential and how much can be parallelized.

The question says that the computation takes 100 seconds on a single processor. But 40% of it is inherently sequential, meaning only 60% can be parallelized. Wait, so the part that's not 40% can be split among the processors.

Wait, so the total time when using multiple processors is calculated by the formula: Speedup = (Time taken by one processor) / (Time taken by n processors). But the formula is actually based on the speedup being the time with one processor divided by the time with n processors. Oh wait, no, the speedup is usually the time when using more processors, which is the time taken divided by the single processor time.

Wait, let me get this right. The time taken by a program running on multiple processors is T = (1 / S) * T_single, where S is the speedup factor, which is the time taken divided by the time on one processor. Or wait, maybe I have it wrong. Let me think: the time when using n processors is T_n = T_single / S, where S is the speedup. But wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, no, the speedup is calculated as T_1 / T_n, where T_1 is the single processor time, and T_n is the time with n processors. And the speedup S is T_1 / T_n. So the time for n processors is T_n = T_single / S = T_single * (T_single / T_n). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of parallel efficiency.

Oh right, the speedup S is the ratio of the single processor time to the parallel time. So S = T_single / T_parallel. So T_parallel = T_single / S.

Wait, but that's when S is the speedup. So, for example, if S is 2, the time is halved. So with S, the time becomes T_single / S.

So in this problem, the single processor time is 100 seconds. The part that's inherently sequential is 40%, so 60% is parallelizable. So the parallelizable part can be split among the processors. Wait, but the 60% is the fraction that can be parallelized, so the actual time for the parallel part depends on the number of processors.

Wait, let's think about it: for the parallelizable part, the time it takes is (1 - p) * (T_single / S), where p is the fraction that's not sequential. Oh, perhaps not. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The parallelizable part can be split among the n processors. So the time for the parallel part when using n processors is (1 - p) * (T_single / n). Because each processor can handle (1-p) fraction of the work, and the total time is the maximum time across all processors. Wait, maybe I should model it as such.

Alternatively, think of it as the parallelizable time. The time for the parallelizable part is (1-p)*T_single, and this time is divided among the n processors. So each processor does (1-p)*T_single / n. So the time taken for each processor is (1-p)* T_single / n. So the time taken for the program with n processors is T_parallel = (1-p) * T_single / n.

Wait, but when you have n processors, the total time is the time taken by the slowest processor, right? Or is it the maximum time among all? Hmm, perhaps the formula is different. I think that when you have a program that's divided into parts that can be run in parallel, the time taken is the time it takes for the part that takes the most time. So if 60% of the work can be done in parallel, the time for the parallel part would be (60% * 100) / n. Wait, no. Wait, actually, each processor can handle a portion of the work. So for example, with n=2, the parallelizable part would take (60% * 100) / 2 = 30 seconds.

Wait, but let's think of it as the total time. The total time when using n processors is the time it takes for the slowest part to complete. So the parallelizable part is (1-p) fraction of T_single, which is 0.6 * 100 = 60 seconds. So for n=2, the time taken is 60 / 2 = 30 seconds. So the total time is 30 seconds for the parallel part, but the sequential part takes 40 seconds. So the total time is 40 + 30 = 70 seconds? Or wait, no, because the sequential part is 40% of the work, which would take 40 seconds when run on a single processor. So the total time when using 2 processors would be (40) + (30) = 70 seconds. Similarly, for 4 processors, the parallelizable time is 60 /4 =15 seconds, so the total time is 40 +15 =55 seconds. So for 2 processors, it's 70 seconds, and for 4, it's 55 seconds.

Wait, but the options don't have 70 for T_parallel. Looking at the options, option E is 80 and 40, option F is 70 and 55, which is what I just got.

Wait, but let me double-check. The time for the parallel part is (1-p)*T_single / n. So (0.6 * 100) / n. So 60 /n.

So for n=2, 60/2=30. So the total time is 40+30=70 seconds.

For n=4, 60/4=15. So 40+15=55 seconds.

So the answer would be 70 and 55 seconds. Which is option F.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 100 and 50

B:40 and 20

C:60 and 30

D:20 and 10

E:80 and 40

F:70 and 55

G:30 and 15

H:50 and 25

I:110 and 55

J:90 and 45

So yes, option F is 70 and 55.

So the correct answer should be F.

To determine the theoretically best possible elapsed times for the program running on 2 and 4 processors, we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Single Processor Time**: The program takes 100 seconds on a single processor.

2. **Inherent Sequentiality**: 40% of the computation is inherently sequential, meaning 60% of the computation can be parallelized.

3. **Parallelizable Time**: The parallelizable portion of the computation is 60% of 100 seconds, which equals 60 seconds.

4. **Time for Parallelizable Part on n Processors**: The time taken for the parallelizable portion when using \( n \) processors is given by \( \frac{\text{Parallelizable Time}}{n} \). For \( n=2 \), this is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) seconds. For \( n=4 \), this is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) seconds.

5. **Total Time Calculation**:
   - For \( n=2 \): The sequential part takes 40 seconds, and the parallelizable part takes 30 seconds. Thus, the total time is \( 40 + 30 = 70 \) seconds.
   - For \( n=4 \): The sequential part takes 40 seconds, and the parallelizable part takes 15 seconds. Thus, the total time is \( 40 + 15 = 55 \) seconds.

6. **Matching Options**: Among the given options, the pair \( 70 \) and \( 55 \) corresponds to option **F**.
