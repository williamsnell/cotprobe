Okay, so I've got this question about Engel's law relating to food economics. Hmm, I remember Engel's law has something to do with how people spend their income on various goods and services, especially food. Let me think.

 Engel's law states that as a household's income increases, the proportion of income spent on food and other goods decreases. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. Maybe I should recall the exact wording.

Oh right, Engel's law, also known as the Engel curve, suggests that the proportion of income spent on a particular category of goods decreases as income increases. So, for food, as a person's income goes up, they spend less on food and more on other things like clothes, entertainment, etc. That makes sense because when you earn more, you can afford more things, so you have less money left for basic needs like food.

So the question is about which statement is correct regarding Engel's law. The options involve how the proportion of income spent on food changes as income rises or falls.

Looking at the options:

Option B: As income remains the same, the proportion of income spent on food increases. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If income doesn't change, why would the proportion increase? That would imply more spending on food, which doesn't align with Engel's law. Because when income is the same, the proportion should stay the same, not increase. So B might not be correct.

Option C: As income rises, the proportion of income spent on food remains similar. That sounds right because according to Engel's law, as income increases, the proportion should decrease. So the statement says it remains similarâ€”this would be incorrect if the law is correct.

Option E: As income declines, the proportion of income spent on non-food items increases. Hmm, not sure about this. Let me think. If income is lower, maybe people would spend more on non-food items like clothes, entertainment, etc. So when income declines, non-food spending increases. But the question is about food, so this option is about non-food items. So if the question is about whether food proportion increases or decreases, E is talking about non-food items, which isn't directly what the question is asking.

Option G: As income declines, the proportion of income spent on food remains similar. That would mean that when people's income goes down, their food spending doesn't change, which is opposite of what Engel's law says. So G is incorrect.

Option J: As income rises, the proportion of income spent on food declines. That aligns with Engel's law. So J seems correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option H: As income rises, proportion of food increases. That's the opposite of what we know. So H is incorrect.

Option I: As income rises, non-food items decline. Again, that's about non-food items, not food.

So the correct statements are J and possibly others. Let me re-examine option B again. Option B says income remains the same, proportion increases. That's not correct because Engel's law says the proportion stays the same when income is the same. So B is wrong.

So the correct answer should be option J: As income rises, the proportion of income spent on food declines. That's exactly what Engel's law states.

The correct answer is J: As income rises, the proportion of income spent on food declines. This aligns with Engel's law, which states that as income increases, the proportion of income spent on food decreases.

Answer: J
