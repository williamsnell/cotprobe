Okay, so I've got this communication model question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking which communication model describes information flowing through various media channels to specific people, who then refer others for guidance. Hmm, the options are A through J, with each having a different model name.

First, I need to remember what each of these models refers to. I think communication models are about how information is transmitted. There's the linear model, for example, which is one-way. Then there's the circular model, where information flows back and forth, like in a conversation.

Wait, the options given are A: Three-step, B: One-step, C: Multi-step, D: Two-step, E: Direct communication, F: Interactive communication, and so on up to J: Indirect communication. The question mentions a model that shows information flowing via various media channels to specific people who refer others. So it's about who the information is directed to, and who they refer to.

I remember that the multi-step model is a type of communication model. It's used in group settings where information is shared among a group, and each member can pass it on to others. So each step involves a member passing the information on. That might fit because it's about multiple steps of communication.

Alternatively, the circular model involves people sending and receiving information, creating a loop. The linear model is one-way, and the two-step might be like a two-stage process, perhaps where someone is the initial sender and the receiver, but that doesn't seem to fit the description.

Wait, the question is about information flowing via various media. So maybe it's the multi-step model. That model allows information to spread through different channels, like emails, videos, etc. Each step could represent the different media.

Looking at the options, option C is multi-step. So that might be the answer. It describes information flowing through various channels to different people, who then refer others for guidance.

Wait, another thought: the multi-step model could also refer to the number of steps in the communication process. Like, the three-step model is someone sends information, then receives it, then decides. But the question is about a model that shows how information is transmitted via multiple media to specific people who refer others.

Alternatively, the two-step model might involve sending info to one person and then that person refers to another. But that's probably the one-step model, which is a different one. Wait, no: one-step would mean direct communication, but I think the one-step might be a different model.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about information flowing via various channels to specific people, who then refer others. So it's about the pathway of communication, possibly involving multiple steps. So the multi-step model (option C) would fit because it's a way where information is passed through multiple channels, each step being a different medium.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be option C: Multi-step.

The correct answer is **C: Multi-step**. This model describes information flowing through various media channels, reaching specific individuals who then refer others for guidance, representing a communication pathway with multiple steps. 

Answer: C
