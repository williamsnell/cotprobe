Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about recursion and termination. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about a recursive procedure P that is guaranteed to terminate. They're asking which statements must be true from a list of options. The options are A to J, each with different statements about P.

First, I need to recall what makes a recursive procedure terminate. I remember that for a recursive function to terminate, each recursive call must eventually reach a base case, and the changes made to the parameters from each call must eventually lead to termination.

Looking at the options:

I. P has a local variable. Hmm, I'm not sure. A local variable in a function is a variable declared inside the function, right? But if P is recursive, does it need a local variable? Like, each call would have its own local variables, but if the function is designed to terminate, maybe it doesn't need a local variable. Or maybe it's okay without it. I'm not certain, so I'll come back to this.

II. P has an execution path where it doesn't call itself. So, is there a way that a recursive function could not call itself at any point? Wait, recursion inherently requires the function to call itself. Unless it's a tail recursion, which I think is optimized. Oh wait, but the question says P is guaranteed to terminate. So if it's a tail recursion, it might not call itself, but in that case, it's a special kind. But regular recursion without tail optimization would require each call to P to call itself. So, can we have a case where the function doesn't call itself? I don't think so. Unless, for some reason, the function doesn't make a recursive call, but that's not possible with standard recursion. So maybe statement II is false. Wait, but wait, some functions can have branches that don't make a recursive call, but that's not the typical definition of recursion. So I think statement II is false because in standard recursion, each step must call the function again.

Wait, but wait. There's a possibility of a function that doesn't call itself. For example, if it's a function that just does something and returns, without making any recursive calls. But that's not recursion. So for a recursive function that is guaranteed to terminate, it must call itself at least once. So statement II is false because it's not possible for a recursive function that terminates to not call itself. So II is false.

III. P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter. Hmm. Well, if a function is recursive, it must have parameters. So it can't have at least one parameter unless it's a function with parameters (like a base case). But wait, maybe the function is designed to have parameters that are passed down recursively. So the function itself isn't a parameter, but the parameters are passed each time. So statement III says that P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter. Could it not have a parameter? Like, if the function is a base case without parameters, then it doesn't call itself. But wait, that's not a recursive function. So for a recursive function, it must call itself, which requires parameters. So if the function doesn't have parameters, it can't be recursive. So, in a recursive function, the function must have parameters. So statement III's part about having at least one parameter is true. But statement III says 'either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.' So, if the function doesn't refer to any global variables but has parameters, then it's true. But what if it doesn't have parameters? Then that part is false. So, does this statement hold? The function must have parameters because it's recursive. So the function must have at least one parameter, so statement III's part is true. Also, it refers to a parameter, so it can't be a global variable because then it wouldn't have parameters (unless it's a base case, but that's not recursive). Wait, so if the function is recursive, it must have parameters. So statement III says 'has at least one parameter' is true, and it refers to a parameter, which is the case. So statement III is true.

Wait, but III says 'either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.' So, if the function doesn't refer to a global variable, it must still have at least one parameter. But since it's recursive, does it have a parameter? Or can it have a parameter that's local to the function, like a default value? Wait, in the function definition, parameters are passed each time. So, the function always has parameters. So statement III's 'has at least one parameter' is true, and it refers to a parameter, so the 'either' part is correct. So statement III is true.

Wait, but what about the initial function? Suppose the function has a recursive call without parameters. Wait, that's not recursion. So for a recursive function, it must have parameters. So statement III is correct in stating that it has at least one parameter, but also that it refers to a parameter. So statement III is correct.

Wait, but I need to reevaluate the other options. Let me restate the options:

I. P has a local variable. I'm not sure. But a local variable is declared inside a function. So for example, inside a function, you can have variables that are only visible within that function. But if the function is called recursively, can it have a local variable? Yes, for example, functions that use a closure or have variables that are passed along in the recursion. But does the termination guarantee for P require a local variable? Or can it avoid that? I'm not certain, but I don't think it's a must. So statement I is not necessarily true.

II. P has an execution path where it doesn't call itself. Well, for a recursive function, each call must call another, except perhaps if it's an infinite loop. But the question states that it's guaranteed to terminate, so it must eventually reach a base case and not call itself. So II is false because it's impossible to have a recursive function (without tail calls) that doesn't call itself. So II is false.

III. Either refers to a global variable or has parameters. Since the function must have parameters (because it's recursive), and it refers to a parameter (because it's part of the function's parameters), statement III is true.

Now, let's check the options again.

The options are A to J, each with different statements. The correct statements must be true.

So, which statements are true?

III is true. I'm not sure about I and II.

Wait, back to statement I: does P have a local variable? Well, if the function is recursive but doesn't use a local variable, then it's not a local variable. But in the context of the problem, the function P is recursive and called (i.e., is recursive). So, for a function to be recursive, it needs to call itself, which implies it must have parameters and call itself. So, if it's a recursive function, it must have parameters and call itself. So, the function may have a local variable. For example, in a function like function f(n) { ... f(n-1); }, the function f uses a local variable. But is that a must for the termination? Because even without a local variable, the function can call itself. So I think statement I is not necessarily true. It's possible for a function to be recursive without having a local variable, but that's not a must.

So, statement I is not necessarily true. So, only statement III is true. But wait, earlier I thought III is true. So, let's see.

So the options are:

A: II only → No, because II is false.

B: I and II only → No, because II is false.

C: II and III only → No, II is false.

D: I, II and III → II is false, so D is incorrect.

E: I and III only → I is not necessarily true, III is correct. So E is incorrect.

F: None of the above → So if only III is correct, then E is incorrect, but E says I and III. Since I is not necessarily true, E is incorrect.

Wait, but earlier I thought III is correct. So, which options are correct? Let's see:

Only III is correct.

So looking at the options, F is 'None of the above.' So, option F says none of the above. So the correct answer would be F.

Wait, but wait, let me think again about statement I. If P has a local variable, is that a must? Like, could there be a recursive function that doesn't use a local variable? For example, what about a function that uses a default parameter, or uses the same local variable but doesn't pass it along? Or perhaps it's using a closure that's accessible in the outer scope. But I'm not sure. But the question is about whether the function must have a local variable.

Wait, the question is which statements must be true. So, does the fact that P is recursive and guaranteed to terminate imply that it must have a local variable?

I think that it's not necessarily the case. A function that's recursive doesn't have to have a local variable. It could be a function that uses default parameters or uses a variable from the outer scope that's passed along in each recursive call. So, statement I is not necessarily true.

So, only statement III is correct. Therefore, none of the options A to E (since E says I and III, but I is not necessarily true) include III as correct alone. So, the correct answer would be F: None of the above.

Wait, but wait, looking back. The answer options are A through J. The options are statements I, II, III. The correct statements are III only. So, which option is that? Let me look at the options:

A: II only → No

B: I and II only → No

C: II and III only → No

D: I, II and III → No

E: I and III only → Only III is correct, but E includes I (which is incorrect)

F: None of the above → So, the correct answer is option F.

Wait, but earlier, I thought statement III is correct. So, the correct answer is F because none of the options A-F states that only III is correct. The options are that each option includes some statements. So, F is the correct option because only III is correct, and none of the other options include only III.

Wait, but I thought earlier that option E includes I and III, but I is incorrect. So, only III is correct, which is not in any of the options except F.

So, the correct choice is F.

The question asks which statements must be true for a recursive procedure P that is guaranteed to terminate. Let's analyze each statement:

1. **Statement I: P has a local variable.**  
   A local variable is declared within a function. While recursion inherently requires the function to call itself, it doesn't necessarily imply the use of a local variable. A function could be recursive without a local variable, such as using default parameters or variables from the outer scope. Thus, statement I is not necessarily true.

2. **Statement II: P has an execution path where it does not call itself.**  
   For a recursive function to terminate, it must eventually reach a base case and stop calling itself. Therefore, it's impossible for a recursive function to have an execution path where it does not call itself. Hence, statement II is false.

3. **Statement III: P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.**  
   In a recursive function, it must have parameters to be called. Since it's guaranteed to terminate, it must refer to a parameter. Thus, statement III is true.

Since only statement III is correct, none of the options A to E include only III. Therefore, the correct answer is F: None of the above.
