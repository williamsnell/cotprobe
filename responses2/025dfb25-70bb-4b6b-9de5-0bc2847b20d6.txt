Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question to tackle. Let me read it again. So, the question has two statements, and I need to determine their truth values and then choose the correct option from A to J. 

Statement 1: If A is connected, the closure of A must be connected. Hmm. I remember something about connected sets and closure. Let me think. A connected set is one that can't be divided into two disjoint non-empty open sets. The closure of a set is the smallest closed set containing it. 

Wait, if A is connected, is its closure necessarily connected? I think yes. Because connectedness is a topological property, and closure doesn't introduce new points that would disconnect the set. So the closure should remain connected. I've probably seen this in topology before. So Statement 1 should be True.

Statement 2: Every continuous function f: (0,1) → (0,1) has a fixed point. Oh, that's the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem, right? Or maybe it's another theorem. Wait, I think Brouwer's theorem says that every continuous function from a convex compact subset of Euclidean space to itself has a fixed point. But here, the domain and codomain are both (0,1), which is the open interval. Is that enough? Or does it require something else?

Wait, actually, the theorem applies to compact spaces. But (0,1) is not compact because it's not closed. So the theorem doesn't apply directly here. So can we have a continuous function f: (0,1) → (0,1) without a fixed point? Hmm. I think there are examples. Like f(x) = x/2. Wait no, that has a fixed point at x=0, but 0 isn't in (0,1). Wait wait, if f(x) is, say, x/2, then for x in (0,1), f(x) is in (0,0.5), which is still in (0,1). So does f(x)=x/2 have a fixed point? Let's see: x/2 =x → x=0. But 0 is not in (0,1), so no fixed point. But wait, f(x)=x/2 is continuous, (0,1) is the domain, and the codomain is (0,1). So this would be a counterexample where there's no fixed point. Therefore, Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but wait. Another example: maybe f(x) = 1 -x. Let's see, then f(0.5)=0.5. So that's a fixed point. So that's not a counterexample. Hmm. So maybe f(x) = (x+1)/2. Let's see: f(0) approaches 0.5, but 0 isn't in the domain. So in (0,1), can we find a function without a fixed point? Or is the Brouwer theorem applicable here?

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. The Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem requires the space to be compact. So (0,1) isn't compact. So the theorem doesn't apply. Therefore, there might be functions without fixed points in (0,1). So Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: For connected spaces, the image must also be connected. But (0,1) is connected, and the image of a connected space under a continuous function is connected. But the image could be a subset of (0,1) that is connected. For example, f(x)=x/2 maps (0,1) to (0,0.5), which is connected. But does that help? Hmm, maybe not. Let's try to find a function without fixed points.

Alternatively, take f(x) = (x+1)/2. Wait, let me compute f(x)= (x+1)/2. Let's see if there's a fixed point: x = (x+1)/2 → 2x = x+1 → x=1. But 1 is not in (0,1), so no fixed point. So yes, such a function exists without a fixed point. So Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but wait another example. Suppose f(x) = x. Then the fixed point is x=0 and x=1, but those are not in (0,1). So wait, in (0,1), perhaps f(x)=x doesn't have any fixed points. So that would be another counterexample. So Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. For example, f(x) = x. So if x is in (0,1), then f(x)=x. So the fixed points are all x in (0,1), but the fixed point is any point in (0,1). So wait, wait no. Wait, in this case, every x is a fixed point. So that's not a counterexample.

Wait, perhaps I should think of a function that doesn't have any fixed points. Let's say f(x) = 1 -x for x in (0,1). Then f(0.5)=0.5. So that's a fixed point. So that's not a counterexample. Hmm.

Wait, maybe f(x) = x/2. So f(x) is in (0,0.5). So for any x in (0,1), f(x) = x/2 is in (0,0.5). So if we set x/2 = x → x=0, which is not in (0,1), so no fixed points. So yes, this function has no fixed points. So Statement 2 is False.

So Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False.

Looking at the options:

Option F is True, True.

Wait a minute, no. Wait, from my analysis, Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. So the correct answer is F: True, False.

Wait, but let me double-check. Statement 1: if A is connected, is closure connected? I think yes. The closure of a connected set is connected. So Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2: every continuous function f: (0,1) → (0,1) has a fixed point. No, because as I thought, f(x) = x/2 is continuous, and (0,1) is not compact, so the Brouwer theorem doesn't apply. So Statement 2 is False.

So the options are:

A: False, False → No.

F: True, False → Yes.

So the correct answer is F.

The analysis determines that Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False.
