Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about equity and bonds, and I need to figure out which statement is true for equity but not for bonds. Let's break it down.

The options are A through I, and I have to pick the correct one. So I'll go through each option step by step.

First, let me recall what I know about equity and bonds. Bonds are typically issued by companies and are traded on a stock exchange, which is the secondary market. Equity, on the other hand, is issued by individuals or through companies themselves, like in the case of stocks. They're traded on the stock market, which is also secondary.

Looking at the options:

A: They can be issued by firms. Bonds are issued by companies, so this is true for bonds but not for equity, which can be issued by individuals or through other entities. So A is correct for bonds but not equity.

B: They can be traded on the secondary market. Both bonds and equity can be traded on the secondary market. So B is true for both, meaning it's not the answer.

C: They have a fixed interest rate. Bonds do have fixed interest rates, but equity doesn't have that. Instead, equity's returns are based on the company's performance, which can vary. So C is true for bonds but not equity.

D: They cannot be traded on the secondary market. No, bonds and equity can both be traded on the secondary market. So D is false.

E: Their payouts are exempt from corporation tax. This is only true for bonds. Equity distributions (dividends) are paid after corporation tax has been deducted. So E is true for bonds but not for equity.

F: They are considered a form of debt. Bonds are considered debt instruments, so F is true for both. Not the answer.

G: Their payouts (dividends or coupons) are made after corporation tax has already been deducted. Yes, for bonds, the interest and coupons are paid out after the company has paid its taxes. For equity, the distributions are made after the corporation tax has been deducted, meaning the company has already paid its taxes. So G is true for both. Not the answer.

H: They are issued by government entities. Equities are issued by individuals or companies, not necessarily government entities. So H is not correct for equity.

I: Their payouts (dividends or coupons) are made before corporation tax has been deducted. For bonds, this is true. For equity, the distributions happen after the corporation tax has been deducted. So I is true for bonds but not for equity.

Now, the question is asking which is true for equity but not for bonds. Looking at the options:

Looking at option I: "Their payouts (i.e. dividends or coupons) are made before corporation tax has been deducted." This is correct for bonds but not for equity. Because for bonds, the interest is paid after the company has paid its taxes. For equity, the company must first pay its taxes, then the dividends are paid.

So the correct answer is I.

The correct answer is **I: Their payouts (i.e. dividends or coupons) are made before corporation tax has been deducted.**

**Explanation:**
- **I** is true for bonds (they pay interest before taxes) but not for equity (equity distributions come after taxes are deducted by the company).
