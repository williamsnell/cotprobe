Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Pat bounces a basketball 25 times in 30 seconds. I need to find out how many times she'll bounce it in 150 seconds. Hmm, sounds like a rate problem. 

First, I should probably find out how many times she bounces in one second. If she does 25 in 30, then in one second, it's 25 divided by 30. Let me calculate that. 25 divided by 30 is the same as 5/6, right? Or approximately 0.8333 bounces per second.

Now, to find out how many in 150 seconds, I multiply the rate by 150. So 0.8333 times 150. Let me do that math. 0.8333 * 150. Wait, 0.8333 is like 5/6, so 5/6 * 150. 150 divided by 6 is 25, so 5 times 25 is 125. So that's 125 bounces in 150 seconds.

Looking at the options, option I is 125. So that's the answer. But wait, maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, I can think in terms of ratios. 30 seconds is to 25 bounces as 150 seconds is to x bounces.

So the ratio is 30/25 = 150/x. Solving for x: 30x = 25*150. 25*150 is 3750, so 30x = 3750. Divide both sides by 30: x = 3750/30 = 125. Yep, same result. So definitely 125, which is option I.

The rate of bounces is calculated by dividing the number of bounces by time. Pat bounces 25 times in 30 seconds, so the rate is \( \frac{25}{30} = \frac{5}{6} \) bounces per second. Over 150 seconds, this becomes \( \frac{5}{6} \times 150 = 125 \) bounces. Thus, the answer is **I: 125**.

Answer: I
