Okay, so I've got this limit problem to solve using Taylor's Approximation Theorem. The question is to find the limit as x approaches 0 of [e^(x^4/2) - cos(x^2)] divided by x^4. The options are given from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, let me think. Taylor series expansions are good for approximating functions near a point, right? Since we're taking the limit as x approaches 0, I can expand both e^(x^4/2) and cos(x^2) around x=0 and then subtract them. 

First, let's expand e^(x^4/2). The Taylor series for e^y around y=0 is 1 + y + y²/2! + y³/3! + ... So, substituting y with x^4/2, we get:

e^(x^4/2) = 1 + (x^4/2) + (x^8)/(2*2!) + (x^12)/(6*3!) + ... 

Since we're taking the limit as x approaches 0, higher powers of x beyond x^4 will become negligible. So, up to x^4, e^(x^4/2) ≈ 1 + x^4/2. 

Next, let's expand cos(x^2). The Taylor series for cos(y) around y=0 is 1 - y²/2! + y^4/4! - y^6/6! + ... Substituting y with x^2, we have:

cos(x^2) = 1 - (x^4)/(2!) + (x^8)/(4!) - (x^{12})/(6!) + ...

Again, when x is near 0, higher powers beyond x^4 are small. So, up to x^4, cos(x^2) ≈ 1 - x^4/2.

Now, subtract the two expansions:

e^(x^4/2) - cos(x^2) ≈ [1 + x^4/2] - [1 - x^4/2] = 1 + (x^4/2) -1 + (x^4/2) = (x^4/2 + x^4/2) = x^4.

So the numerator simplifies to x^4, and the denominator is x^4. Therefore, the expression simplifies to x^4 / x^4 = 1. But wait, I think I made a mistake here because both expansions start with 1, so when subtracting, the 1s cancel. Let me double-check the expansion.

Wait, no, let me re-calculate. Wait, e^(x^4/2) is 1 + x^4/2 + higher terms, and cos(x^2) is 1 - x^4/2 + higher terms. So when you subtract, the 1s cancel, and you have (x^4/2 + x^4/2) = x^4. So the numerator is x^4, denominator x^4: x^4 / x^4 = 1. But wait, the limit is as x approaches 0, so that would be 1. But looking at the options, option I is 0 and option E is 0.5. Wait, but wait—am I missing something? Because the answer options don't include 1, but the options are A: -1, B:0.25, etc., up to J:1.0. So option J is 1.0, which is 1.

Wait, but let me make sure I did the expansion correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can try a different approach. Let me compute the limit directly by substituting to see.

Alternatively, let me compute e^(x^4/2) - cos(x^2) as x approaches 0. Let me denote t = x^2, so as x approaches 0, t approaches 0. Then the expression becomes e^(t^2/2) - cos(t).

Wait, but that substitution might not help directly. Alternatively, perhaps using the expansion as I did earlier is the correct approach. So, the numerator is x^4, denominator x^4, so the limit is 1.

But wait, looking back at the options, option J is 1.0. So that would be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes Taylor series might have higher-order terms that influence the limit.

Wait, perhaps I missed a term. Let me expand again:

e^(x^4/2) = 1 + (x^4/2) + (x^8)/(8) + (x^{12})/(48) + ... 

cos(x^2) = 1 - (x^4)/2 + (x^8)/(24) - (x^{12})/(720) + ...

So when subtracting, the 1s cancel, and the x^4 terms are x^4/2 and -x^4/2, which add to zero. The next term is x^8 terms: e^... gives x^8/8, cos... gives x^8/24. So x^8 terms: (1/8 - 1/24) x^8. Which is (3/24 - 1/24)= 2/24 = 1/12 x^8. So the numerator is x^8 (1/12) + higher order terms. The denominator is x^4, so the expression becomes (1/12 x^8 + ...) / x^4 = (1/12)x^4 + ... So as x approaches 0, the limit is zero.

Wait, that can't be right. Because earlier I thought to have the numerator as x^4, but now I'm getting x^8. So I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.

Wait, I think I see. Earlier, I considered only the first two terms of each expansion. The correct expansion should include more terms to see the behavior.

So, for e^(x^4/2), the expansion up to x^4 is correct, but beyond that, it's x^8 terms. Similarly, cos(x^2) has terms up to x^4.

Wait, but when you subtract e^(x^4/2) - cos(x^2), the x^4 terms cancel, leaving x^8 terms. So the numerator is (1/8 - 1/24) x^8 = (3/24 - 1/24) x^8 = (2/24) x^8 = (1/12) x^8. So the numerator is (1/12)x^8, and denominator is x^4. So the expression becomes (1/12)x^4. Therefore, as x approaches 0, this tends to 0. So the limit is 0.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my initial thought. So which is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me check again.

Wait, the e^(x^4/2) expansion is 1 + (x^4/2) + (x^8)/(2^2 * 2!) ) + (x^{12})/(2^3 * 3!) ) + ... up to x^4, it's 1 + (x^4/2).

Similarly, cos(x^2) expansion is 1 - (x^4)/(2!) + (x^8)/(4!) - ... up to x^4, it's 1 - x^4/2.

So subtracting, e^(x^4/2) - cos(x^2) = [1 + x^4/2] - [1 - x^4/2] = x^4. So the numerator is x^4, denominator x^4, so limit is 1. But wait, that can't be right because in the expansion I considered higher terms, and the numerator becomes (1/8 - 1/24) x^8 = (1/12)x^8.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me compute e^(x^4/2) correctly.

The Taylor series for e^y is 1 + y + y²/2! + y³/3! + ... where y = x^4/2.

So for e^(x^4/2), substituting y:

1 + (x^4/2) + (x^8/2^2 * 2!) + (x^{12}/2^3 * 3!) + ... So 1 + x^4/2 + (x^8)/(8 * 2) ) + (x^{12})/(48 * 6) ) + ... 

Wait, 2! is 2, so (x^4/2) is the first term. Then y squared is (x^4/2)^2 = x^8/4, so y²/2! is (x^8/4)/2 = x^8/(8).

Similarly, y³ is (x^4/2)^3 = x^{12}/8, y³/3! is (x^{12}/8)/6 = x^{12}/(48).

So e^(x^4/2) = 1 + x^4/2 + x^8/8 + x^{12}/(48) + ...

Similarly, cos(x^2) is 1 - (x^4)/2! + (x^8)/(4!) - (x^{12})/(6!) + ... 

Which is 1 - x^4/2 + x^8/24 - x^{12}/720 + ... 

Now, subtracting cos(x^2) from e^(x^4/2):

e^(x^4/2) - cos(x^2) = [1 + x^4/2 + x^8/8 + ...] - [1 - x^4/2 + x^8/24 - ...] 

= (1-1) + (x^4/2 + x^4/2) + (x^8/8 - x^8/24) + higher terms.

= 0 + x^4 (1/2 + 1/2) + x^8 (1/8 -1/24) + ...

= x^4 (1) + x^8 ( (3/24 -1/24 ) ) + ... 

= x^4 + (2/24)x^8 + ... 

= x^4 + (1/12)x^8 + ... 

So the numerator is x^4 + (1/12)x^8, and the denominator is x^4.

So, the expression becomes [x^4 + (1/12)x^8 ] / x^4 = 1 + (1/12)x^4 + ... 

As x approaches 0, the higher terms vanish, so the limit is 1 + 0 = 1.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the x^8 term, I thought the numerator was x^8, but actually, it's x^4 plus x^8 terms. So the leading term is x^4, so the limit is 1.

But wait, but I thought I had to go to the x^8 term and see if it's zero. So perhaps the initial approach was wrong because I stopped at x^4 without considering higher-order terms.

So, the correct expansion shows that the numerator is x^4 + (1/12)x^8 + ... , and the denominator is x^4. So when you divide, you get 1 + (1/12)x^4 + ... which approaches 1 as x approaches 0.

But wait, the options don't have 1 as a correct option. Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are A: -1, B:0.25, C:1.5, D:3, E:0.5, F:Undefined, G:2.0, H:4.0, I:0.0, J:1.0.

Oh, option J is 1.0. So the limit is 1, which is option J.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the numerator was x^4 + (1/12)x^8. So the expression is (x^4 + (1/12)x^8)/x^4 = 1 + (1/12)x^4, which tends to 1 as x approaches 0.

So the correct answer is J: 1.0.

Wait, but let me confirm my earlier conclusion. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the expansions. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using L’Hospital’s Rule. Since both numerator and denominator approach 0 as x approaches 0.

Numerator: e^{x^4/2} - cos(x^2)

Denominator: x^4

So as x→0, e^{x^4/2} approaches 1, and cos(x^2) approaches 1, so numerator is 0. Denominator is 0, so 0/0 form, which allows L’Hospital’s Rule.

Compute derivatives:

First derivative of numerator: d/dx [e^{x^4/2} - cos(x^2)] = (x^3)e^{x^4/2} + 2x sin(x^2)

Derivative of denominator: 4x^3

So applying L’Hospital once:

Limit becomes [ (x^3)e^{x^4/2} + 2x sin(x^2) ] / 4x^3 

Factor out x^3 in numerator:

[ x^3 (e^{x^4/2} + 2 sin(x^2)/x ) ] /4x^3 = [ e^{x^4/2} + (2/x) sin(x^2) ] /4

As x→0, e^{x^4/2} approaches 1. sin(x^2) ≈x^2 (since sin z ≈z for small z). So sin(x^2) ≈x^2.

Thus, the expression becomes [1 + (2/x)(x^2) ] /4 = [1 + 2x ] /4.

As x approaches 0, this becomes (1 +0)/4 = 1/4 = 0.25.

Wait, wait, that's conflicting with the Taylor expansion approach. So now, I'm getting 0.25.

Hmm, that's a problem. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying L’Hospital's Rule. Let me double-check.

The function is f(x) = [e^{x^4/2} - cos(x^2)] / x^4.

As x approaches 0, both numerator and denominator approach zero.

Thus, applying L’Hospital's Rule once: take derivatives.

f'(x) = [ e^{x^4/2} * (4x^3/2) + 2x sin(x^2) ] / (4x^3 )

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, f(x) = numerator/denominator = [e^{x^4/2} - cos(x^2)] / x^4.

So f'(x) = [d/dx (numerator) * denominator - numerator * d/dx (denominator)] / (denominator)^2.

But since it's 0/0, perhaps it's easier to compute the derivatives.

Wait, let me instead use the Leibniz formula for the derivatives.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the first derivative correctly.

Wait, the first derivative of the numerator is d/dx [ e^{x^4/2} - cos(x^2) ] = e^{x^4/2}*(4x^3/2) + 2x sin(x^2) = 2x^3 e^{x^4/2} + 2x sin(x^2) 

The derivative of denominator, x^4, is 4x^3.

So applying L’Hospital’s Rule, the limit becomes [2x^3 e^{x^4/2} + 2x sin(x^2)] / 4x^3.

Simplify this by dividing numerator and denominator by x^3:

[2 e^{x^4/2} + (2 sin(x^2))/x ] /4.

As x approaches 0, e^{x^4/2} approaches 1. For the term (2 sin(x^2))/x, as x→0, sin(x^2) ≈x^2, so (2 x^2)/x = 2x →0.

Thus, the limit becomes (2*1 + 0)/4 = 2/4= 1/2=0.5.

Wait, so that's 0.5, which is option E.

But earlier, the Taylor expansion suggested 1. So which is correct?

Hmm, now I'm confused because two methods gave conflicting results.

Let me double-check both approaches.

In the Taylor expansion, the numerator is x^4 + (1/12)x^8, so when divided by x^4, we get 1 + (1/12)x^4 →1 as x→0.

In the L’Hospital's approach, the limit was 0.5.

So which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the expansion.

Wait, let me recompute the expansion.

e^(x^4/2) = 1 + (x^4/2) + (x^8)/(2^2*2!) + (x^{12})/(2^3*3!) + ... 

= 1 + x^4/2 + x^8/(8) + x^{12}/(48) + ...

Similarly, cos(x^2) = 1 - x^4/2! + x^8/4! - x^{12}/6! + ...

= 1 - x^4/2 + x^8/(24) - x^{12}/720 + ...

Subtracting:

[e^{x^4/2} - cos(x^2)] = [1 + x^4/2 + x^8/8 + x^{12}/(48) + ...] - [1 - x^4/2 + x^8/24 - x^{12}/720 + ...]

= (1-1) + (x^4/2 + x^4/2) + (x^8/8 - x^8/24) + (x^{12}/48 + x^{12}/720) + ... 

= 0 + x^4 (1/2 + 1/2) + x^8 (1/8 - 1/24) + x^{12} (1/48 + 1/720) + ... 

= x^4 * 1 + x^8 ( (3/24 - 1/24) ) + x^{12} ( (15/720 + 1/720) ) + ... 

= x^4 + x^8 (2/24) + x^{12} (16/720) + ... 

Which is x^4 + x^8*(1/12) + x^{12}*(1/45) + ... 

So the numerator is x^4 + (x^8)/12 + ... 

Denominator is x^4.

So, [x^4 + (x^8)/12 ] / x^4 = 1 + (1/12) x^4 + ... 

As x approaches 0, this tends to 1.

So the limit is 1.

But in the L’Hospital's approach, I got 0.5. That's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first derivative.

Wait, let me compute the derivative of e^{x^4/2} again.

d/dx [e^{x^4/2}] = e^{x^4/2} * (4x^3)/(2) )= e^{x^4/2} * (2x^3) = 2x^3 e^{x^4/2}.

Similarly, the derivative of cos(x^2) is -sin(x^2) * 2x = -2x sin(x^2).

Wait, so f'(x) = [2x^3 e^{x^4/2} - (-2x sin(x^2)) ] / (4x^3) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the application of L’Hospital's Rule.

Wait, f(x) = N/D, where N = e^{x^4/2} - cos(x^2), D = x^4.

The derivative of f(x) is (N’ D - N D’ ) / D^2.

But if it's 0/0, then f’(x) = N’ / D’ (using the limit as x→0).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express the limit as the ratio of derivatives.

So f’(x) = [N’(x) D(x) - N(x) D’(x)] / D(x)^2.

But when N/D →0/0, then f’(x) = N’(x)/D’(x).

So in this case, f’(x) = [d/dx (e^{x^4/2} - cos(x^2)] / [d/dx (x^4) ]

= [2x^3 e^{x^4/2} + 2x sin(x^2) ] / (4x^3 )

Simplify:

Factor numerator: 2x^3 e^{x^4/2} + 2x sin(x^2) = 2x [x^2 e^{x^4/2} + sin(x^2) ]

Denominator: 4x^3 = 4x^3.

So f’(x) = [2x (x^2 e^{x^4/2} + sin(x^2) ) ] / (4x^3 ) = [2x (x^2 e^{x^4/2} + sin(x^2) ) ] / (4x^3 )

Simplify:

= [2x (x^2 e^{x^4/2} + sin(x^2) ) ] / (4x^3 ) = [ (x^2 e^{x^4/2} + sin(x^2) ) * 2x ] / (4x^3 )

= [ (x^2 e^{x^4/2} + sin(x^2) ) * 2 ] / (4x^2 )

= [ (x^2 e^{x^4/2} + sin(x^2) ) ] / (2x^2 )

As x approaches 0, e^{x^4/2} approaches 1, and sin(x^2) approaches x^2.

So numerator becomes x^2 *1 + x^2 = 2x^2.

Denominator is 2x^2.

So f’(x) = (2x^2) / (2x^2 ) =1.

Thus, the limit is 1, so the answer is option J.

Hmm, but earlier when I applied L’Hospital's Rule once, I got 0.5, but that was incorrect because I didn't take the correct derivatives.

Yes, so in the initial L’Hospital approach, I must have made a mistake. So the correct answer is 1, so option J.
</think>

To solve the limit problem:

$$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} - \cos(x^2)}{x^4}$$

We can use the Taylor series expansion around \(x = 0\) to approximate each term in the numerator and denominator.

1. **Expand \(e^{\frac{x^4}{2}}\):**

   $$e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} = 1 + \frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{x^8}{8} + \frac{x^{12}}{48} + \dots$$

2. **Expand \(\cos(x^2)\):**

   $$\cos(x^2) = 1 - \frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{x^8}{24} - \frac{x^{12}}{720} + \dots$$

3. **Subtract the expansions:**

   $$e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} - \cos(x^2) = \left(1 + \frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{x^8}{8} + \dots\right) - \left(1 - \frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{x^8}{24} - \dots\right)$$

   $$= \frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{x^8}{8} - \frac{x^8}{24} + \dots$$

   $$= x^4 + \frac{x^8}{12} + \dots$$

4. **Divide by \(x^4\):**

   $$\frac{e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} - \cos(x^2)}{x^4} = \frac{x^4 + \frac{x^8}{12} + \dots}{x^4} = 1 + \frac{x^4}{12} + \dots$$

5. **Take the limit as \(x \to 0\):**

   $$\lim_{x \to 0} \left(1 + \frac{x^4}{12} + \dots\right) = 1$$

Thus, the limit is **1.0**, which corresponds to option **J**.

ANSWER: J
