Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the primary objective of management in managerial economics. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that managerial economics is all about applying economic principles to business decisions. The question is asking about the main goal here. The options are a bunch of different objectives, so I need to recall what each one means.

Option A is about maximizing firm value. That sounds a bit abstract, but I think it relates to efficiency and maximizing returns for the company's shareholders.

Option B is about minimizing costs. This makes sense because businesses always want to save money wherever possible. Whether it's production, marketing, or buying, reducing costs is a key goal.

Option C talks about maximizing market share. That's more about increasing the number of customers or the amount of business you have, which might involve strategic decisions like entering new markets or improving products.

Option D is about minimizing environmental impact. This is a growing concern these days, especially with regulations and sustainability. Businesses might aim to reduce their carbon footprint or use eco-friendly methods to cut environmental harm.

Option E is about maximizing social welfare. I'm not sure about this one. Social welfare could involve things like reducing inequality, improving public services, or ensuring that resources are used for the greatest good. But I'm not certain if that's the primary objective in managerial economics.

Option F is about maximizing production output. This is straightforward; businesses want to produce as much as possible to meet demand and generate profit.

Option G is about maximizing customer satisfaction. That's about making products or services as good as possible so customers are happy, which can lead to repeat business and positive brand perception.

Option H is about minimizing risk exposure. This might involve strategies to reduce potential losses or uncertainties in business decisions.

Option I is about maximizing employee satisfaction. That's more about the human element, how people feel and perform at their jobs.

Option J is about maximizing profits. That seems like a common goal. Businesses aim to make the most money possible, which ties into cost minimization and efficiency.

Now, thinking about managerial economics, the primary objective is generally about maximizing profits. Because it's an applied economics field, the goal is to use economic principles to make decisions that lead to the highest possible return for the company. This includes things like cost control, investment in technology, and improving efficiency.

Let me cross-check each option. Option J says "maximization of profits," which seems correct. The others are more specific but not the primary goal. For example, minimizing costs is important, but it's a part of maximizing profits. Similarly, social welfare or environmental impact are more about the broader societal goals rather than the immediate business profit.

So, the primary objective is to maximize profits, so the correct answer should be option J.

The primary objective of management in managerial economics is to maximize profits, as this is the most immediate and fundamental goal in applying economic principles to business decisions.

Answer: J
