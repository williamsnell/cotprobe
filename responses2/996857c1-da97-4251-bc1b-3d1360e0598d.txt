Okay, so I'm trying to solve this logic problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about determining the immediate consequence in propositional logic (PL) from the given premises. The premises are:

1. U ⊃ W
2. W ⊃ (X ≡ ~Y)
3. (X ≡ ~Y) ⊃ Z
4. ~Z

And the options are A through J, each with a proposition. I need to find which one is an immediate consequence of these premises.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to figure out what each premise implies and how they connect. Maybe I can use some rules of inference or logical equivalences to derive the conclusion.

Let me list out the premises again:

Premise 1: U → W
Premise 2: W → (X ≡ ¬Y)
Premise 3: (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z
Premise 4: ¬Z

Wait, so Premise 4 is ~Z. That looks a lot like an implication here. Because if (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z, and we have ~Z, which is ¬Z. So, this seems like a case where we can apply modus tollens. Modus tollens says that if A → B and ¬B, then ¬A. So applying that here, if (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z and we have ¬Z, then we can conclude that ¬(X ≡ ¬Y). 

Wait, but (X ≡ ¬Y) is equivalent to (X → ¬Y) ∧ (¬Y → X). So if we have ¬(X ≡ ¬Y), that means either X is true and ¬Y is false, or X is false and ¬Y is true. Let me think. Wait, no, (X ≡ ¬Y) is true only when X is true and ¬Y is true, and false otherwise. So ¬(X ≡ ¬Y) would mean that either X is false and ¬Y is true, or X is true and ¬Y is false.

Wait, actually, that's not correct. Because (X ≡ Y) is equivalent to (X → Y) ∧ (Y → X). So (X ≡ ¬Y) is equivalent to (X → ¬Y) ∧ (¬Y → X). So the negation of that would be ∃ cases where either X is true but ¬Y is false, or X is false but ¬Y is true.

But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's proceed step by step.

Premise 4 is ¬Z. From Premise 3, which is (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z, and knowing that Z is false (since Premise 4 is ~Z), we can apply modus tollens. So, from (A → B) and ¬B, we get ¬A. So here, A is (X ≡ ¬Y), and B is Z. So, Premise 3 is (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z, and Premise 4 is ¬Z. Therefore, by modus tollens, we can conclude that ¬(X ≡ ¬Y). 

So ¬(X ≡ ¬Y) means that either X is false or ¬Y is false. But wait, let's think about the logical equivalence of (X ≡ ¬Y). So, X ≡ ¬Y is equivalent to (X → ¬Y) ∧ (¬Y → X). So ¬(X ≡ ¬Y) would be the negation of that, which is ¬(X → ¬Y) ∨ ¬(¬Y → X). 

But let's think of it another way. If X is true and ¬Y is true, then X ≡ ¬Y is true. If X is false and ¬Y is false, then X ≡ ¬Y is also true because both are false. Wait, no, wait. If both are false, then X is false, and ¬Y is false. So X ≡ ¬Y would be true because both are the same. Oh, right, because ≡ is equivalent to 'biconditional'. So, if X is false and ¬Y is false, then X ≡ ¬Y is true. Similarly, if X is true and ¬Y is true, then X ≡ ¬Y is true. The only way (X ≡ ¬Y) is false is when X and ¬Y have different truth values.

So, ¬(X ≡ ¬Y) is equivalent to X being true and ¬Y being false, OR X being false and ¬Y being true.

But maybe I should instead think about the implications. Since (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z, and Z is false, so (X ≡ ¬Y) must be false. So, I can conclude that (X ≡ ¬Y) is false.

Now, I need to find which of the options is a consequence of this conclusion.

Looking at the options:

Option B is U → Z. Hmm, but I don't see any connection between U and Z. Premise 1 is U → W, but Premise 2 is W → (X ≡ ¬Y), and Premise 3 is (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z. So, U → W → (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z. But without any link from U to Z, I don't think U → Z is a consequence.

Option E is U ∨ W. Hmm, maybe. Since U → W, if U is true, then W is true. So U ∨ W is always true, because if U is true, W is true. If U is false, then W can be anything, but U ∨ W is true. So E is always true. But does that follow from the premises? Let me check.

Wait, from the premises, can I derive U ∨ W?

We have U → W, which is a conditional. The contrapositive of U → W is ¬W → ¬U. So, if W is false, then U is false. But can I derive U ∨ W? Well, if U is true, W is true, so OR is true. If U is false, then W can be anything, but OR is still true because U is false. So, U ∨ W is a tautology, so it's always true. But does this follow from the premises? Let's see.

Wait, do the premises imply that U ∨ W is a tautology? Because U → W is given, and W → (X ≡ ¬Y), and (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z, and Z is false. So, from U → W, can we derive U ∨ W?

Wait, U ∨ W is equivalent to ¬U → W. Because if U is false, then W must be true for U ∨ W to be true. Let's see if we can derive that. So, from U → W, the contrapositive is ¬W → ¬U. But that's the same as saying if W is false, then U is false. So, if W is false, then U is false. But if W is true, then U could be true or false, but in either case, U ∨ W is true.

Wait, not sure if that's the right path. Alternatively, perhaps I can use modus tollens on the earlier conclusion. Since we have ¬(X ≡ ¬Y), which is equivalent to (X is true and Y is false) or (X is false and Y is true). So, ¬(X ≡ ¬Y) is (X ∧ ¬(¬Y)) ∨ (¬X ∧ Y).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's think again. (X ≡ ¬Y) is equivalent to (X → ¬Y) ∧ (¬Y → X). So, the negation is ¬(X → ¬Y) ∨ ¬(¬Y → X). Which is equivalent to (X ∧ Y) ∨ (¬X ∧ ¬¬Y). Because for X → A to be false, X must be true and A must be false. Similarly, ¬Y → X is equivalent to (Y ∨ X), so its negation is (¬Y ∧ ¬X). So, the negation of (X → ¬Y) ∧ (¬Y → X) is (X ∧ ¬(¬Y)) ∨ (¬X ∧ ¬(¬Y)).

Wait, maybe I should just not get stuck here. Let me think. So, from ¬(X ≡ ¬Y), I can derive either X is true and Y is false, or X is false and Y is true. But I'm not sure how that helps me connect to the options.

Let me look at the options again. The question is asking which proposition is an immediate consequence of the premises. So, the correct answer must be a statement that logically follows from the premises.

Earlier, I concluded that from Premise 3 and 4, we can conclude ¬(X ≡ ¬Y). Now, I need to see which option is a logical consequence of that conclusion.

Option B: U → Z. Wait, from U → W, and W → (X ≡ ¬Y), and (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z, and we have ¬(X ≡ ¬Y). So, Z cannot be derived directly from this because if ¬(X ≡ ¬Y), then Z could be either true or false, depending on the premises. So, I don't think U → Z is a consequence.

Option F: ~(U → W). But wait, the first premise says U → W, which is a given. Also, we have U → W as a premise. So F is the negation of a premise, which doesn't help. So F can't be a consequence.

Wait, no: the premises are U → W, which is given. So F is ~(U → W), which is not something we can derive. So F can't be the answer.

Option E: U ∨ W. As I thought earlier, U → W is a premise, but does that imply U ∨ W? Let's think. If U is true, then W is true, so U ∨ W is true. If U is false, then W can be anything, so U ∨ W is still true. So yes, U ∨ W is a tautology. But does it follow from the premises? Because the premises only include U → W. So, given U → W, can we derive U ∨ W? Let me think. Yes, because if U is true, then W is true, so U ∨ W is true. If U is false, W can be true or false, but in either case, U ∨ W is true. So, yes, U ∨ W is a consequence. So E is a possible answer.

Wait, but I thought earlier that U → W would make U ∨ W always true, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of it another way. If U is false, then W can be anything, but U ∨ W would still be true because one of them is true. So, regardless of U's truth value, U ∨ W is always true. So, yes, it must be a consequence.

Wait, but I have to make sure that this conclusion doesn't contradict any of the premises. Let's think: can U ∨ W be used to derive something else? But the question is about what is a consequence of the premises, not about whether it's consistent with them.

So E is a possible answer. Let me check the other options.

Option G: Z ∨ W. Well, since from Premise 3, (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z, and we have ¬(X ≡ ¬Y), which we derived earlier, so that would mean that (X ≡ ¬Y) is false. Therefore, (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is equivalent to ¬(X ≡ ¬Y) ∨ Z. Since ¬(X ≡ ¬Y) is true, the entire implication is true regardless of Z. So Z can be true or false. So, Z ∨ W would be true because if Z is true, it's true. If Z is false, then W must be true for Z ∨ W to be true. But from Premise 2, W is related to (X ≡ ¬Y). Hmm, but perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me see: if (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, then Premise 2 is (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z, which is a false → Z. But a false premise in an implication makes the implication true regardless of Z. So, Z can be anything, but the implication itself is true. So, for Z ∨ W, since Z can be false, W can be anything. But how does that connect? I'm not sure if Z ∨ W is a consequence. Alternatively, perhaps Z ∨ W is not a direct consequence.

Option A: ~W ∨ Z. Hmm. From Premise 2, W → (X ≡ ¬Y). And from Premise 3, (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z. So combining these, W → Z. So, if W is true, then Z must be true. So, W → Z is a consequence. Also, we have from the earlier conclusion that ¬(X ≡ ¬Y), which we can write as (X ∧ ¬(¬Y)) ∨ (¬X ∧ ¬(¬Y)) → which is (X ∧ Y) ∨ (¬X ∧ Y). Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, since (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z, and we have ¬(X ≡ ¬Y), then Z must be false. So Z is false. So, from W → Z, and Z is false, then W must be false. So, W is a consequence.

Wait, because if W is true, then Z must be true. But since Z is false, W must be false. So, W → Z, and Z is false → W is false. So W must be false. So, W is false.

Now, since W is false, what about W → Z? Well, any implication where the premise is false is automatically true. So, W → Z is automatically true because W is false. So, that's a consequence.

So, from W → Z, and Z is false, which implies W is false.

So, W is false.

Now, what about Z? Since Z is false, is there a way to connect that to the options? Option A is ~W ∨ Z. Since W is false, ~W is true. So, regardless of Z, A would be true. But that's because W is false, but that's a separate conclusion.

Wait, but in the options, we're looking for a consequence of the premises. So, what's the conclusion that must follow.

Let me think again. So, from the premises, I have:

1. U → W
2. W → (X ≡ ¬Y)
3. (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z
4. Z is false.

From 3 and 4: (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is false. But since (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is false, that means (X ≡ ¬Y) is true and Z is false. Because (A → B) is false only when A is true and B is false.

So, (X ≡ ¬Y) is true, and Z is false. Therefore, (X ≡ ¬Y) must be true. Which implies that X is true and ¬Y is true, because (X → ¬Y) and (¬Y → X) are both true. So, X is true, Y is false.

So, from this, X is true, Y is false.

Now, with X true and Y false, let's see what else we can derive.

From Premise 2: W → (X ≡ ¬Y). Since X is true and Y is false, ¬Y is true. So, X ≡ ¬Y is true. So, W → (true). So, W can be anything: if W is true, it doesn't matter, but if W is false, then W → true is true.

But from Premise 1: U → W. So, if U is true, then W is true. If U is false, W can be anything. But from our earlier conclusion, W is false? Wait, no. Wait, because from (X ≡ ¬Y) is true, and W → (X ≡ ¬Y), which is true. So W can be either true or false; it doesn't impose any restriction on W.

Wait, but earlier we concluded that W is false. No, wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me retrace.

Wait, from Premise 3 and 4, we have (X ≡ ¬Y) is true, and from that, since (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is false, because Z is false, and (X ≡ ¬Y) is true. So, from that, we can conclude that (X ≡ ¬Y) is true, which means X is true and Y is false.

So, now, with X true and Y false, let's look at Premise 2: W → (X ≡ ¬Y). Since X is true and Y is false, X ≡ ¬Y is true. So, W → true. So, W can be anything. So, W is a free variable here.

Wait, but earlier I thought W must be false because of the conclusion from Modus Tollens. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in that reasoning.

Wait, let's go back. From the premises, we have:

From Premise 3 and 4: (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, so (X is true and Y is false) is the case. Then, (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is false, so the antecedent (X ≡ ¬Y) is true, and the consequent Z is false. So, (X ≡ ¬Y) is true, and Z is false. So, (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is false.

Now, from Premise 2: W → (X ≡ ¬Y). So, since (X ≡ ¬Y) is true, W can be anything. So, W can be true or false.

Now, what about the conclusion from Modus Tollens earlier? We had from Premises 3 and 4 that (X ≡ ¬Y) is false. So, (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, which implies that either X is true and Y is false, or X is false and Y is true. Wait, no. Because (A ≡ B) is false only when A and B are different: one is true, the other is false.

So, (X ≡ ¬Y) is false implies that X and ¬Y are different. So, X is true and ¬Y is false, or X is false and ¬Y is true. So, two cases: Case 1: X is true, Y is false. Case 2: X is false, Y is true.

Wait, but in our earlier reasoning, we concluded that (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, which is because (X is true and Y is false) or (X is false and Y is true). So, that's correct.

Now, with that, let's see what else we can derive. From Premise 1: U → W. So, if U is true, then W must be true. But if U is false, W can be anything. But from another part, perhaps we can connect this to another conclusion.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the options again. The options are:

A: ~W ∨ Z → which is W ∨ Z. But since Z is false, W can be anything. So, W ∨ Z is always true. But does that follow from the premises? Not directly, but perhaps.

Wait, earlier, I thought that W must be false. No, wait, from the premises, W is not necessarily false. So, perhaps W can be either true or false. So, W ∨ Z is always true because Z is false, but W could be anything. So, A is always true, but does it have to follow from the premises? I'm not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed differently. Let me think about the logical implications.

We have:

1. U → W
2. W → (X ≡ ¬Y)
3. (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z
4. Z is false.

So, from 3 and 4, (X ≡ ¬Y) is false → which implies that X is true and Y is false, or X is false and Y is true.

Now, from 2, since W → (X ≡ ¬Y), and (X ≡ ¬Y) is false in the case where X is true and Y is false, or X is false and Y is true. So, W → (something that is false). So, W can be anything, because W is only leading to something that is false. So, W can be true or false.

Wait, but that's not correct. Let me think: if (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, then W can be anything. So, W can be true or false, but it doesn't impose a constraint on W beyond that. So, in this case, W can be true or false.

Wait, but the question is about the logical consequence of the premises. So, the correct answer should be something that is always true because it's a logical consequence of the premises.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: U → Z. But we don't have any information that U implies Z. So, perhaps B is not a consequence.

Option C: (U ∧ ~W). Well, from Premise 1, U → W. So, if U is true, then W must be true. So, U → W → (U → W → Z). So, U → W implies that if U is true, then W is true, and if W is true, then Z is true. So, U → Z is a consequence. So, U → Z is an immediate consequence.

Wait, but that's not an option. Let's see.

Wait, no, looking at the options, option B is U → Z. So, if U → Z is a consequence, then it's an answer. But from the premises, we don't have any information that U → Z. So, perhaps option B is not a consequence.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

We have:

1. U → W
2. W → (X ≡ ¬Y)
3. (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z
4. Z is false.

From 3 and 4, (X ≡ ¬Y) is false → which implies that X is true and Y is false, or X is false and Y is true.

Now, from 2: W → (X ≡ ¬Y). Since (X ≡ ¬Y) is false in the two cases (X true, Y false; X false, Y true), then W → false. So, this implies that if W is true, then (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, which is only possible if X is true and Y is false, or X is false and Y is true.

So, if W is true, then (X ≡ ¬Y) is false. So, that's possible. But how does that help us?

Wait, perhaps we can derive that W must be false. Because if W is true, then (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, which is possible. But if W is true, and (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, then that doesn't impose any further constraints on X and Y.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options. Option B is U → Z. How do we know that U → Z is a consequence of the premises?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that if U is true, then W must be true. And since (X ≡ ¬Y) must be false, because W → (X ≡ ¬Y), and if W is true, then (X ≡ ¬Y) must be false. So, (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, which implies that X is true and Y is false, or X is false and Y is true. But regardless of that, how does that affect Z? Well, Z can be anything because (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is false, but that's only when (X ≡ ¬Y) is true. So, (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, so (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is automatically true, regardless of Z.

So, Z can be anything, but in terms of the implications, (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is a false statement. So, that doesn't impose any constraints on Z.

So, perhaps I'm wrong in the earlier conclusion that U → Z is a consequence. Let me think again.

Wait, earlier, from Premise 3 and 4, we have (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, which implies that X is true and Y is false, or X is false and Y is true. Now, from Premise 2: W → (X ≡ ¬Y). Since (X ≡ ¬Y) is false in both cases where X is true and Y is false, or X is false and Y is true, then W → false. So, W → (X ≡ ¬Y) is equivalent to W → false, which is equivalent to W → false. So, W must be false.

So, W is false. Now, from Premise 1: U → W. Since W is false, U → false is equivalent to U → W. So, U → false is equivalent to U → false. So, U must be false. So, U is false.

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because from Premise 3 and 4, we have that (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, which implies that W must be false. So, W is false. So, from Premise 1: U → W. Since W is false, U → false is equivalent to U → W. So, if U is true, then W is true, but since W is false, U must be false. So, U is false.

So, U is false, and W is false. Now, what about Z? We don't have any information that Z must be anything, only that (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is false. But since (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, then (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is always true, regardless of Z. So, Z can be anything.

So, in this scenario, U is false, W is false, and Z can be anything. So, looking at the options:

Option B: U → Z. Since U is false, U → Z is always true, which is correct. But I'm not sure if that's a consequence of the premises.

Wait, but considering the premises, we have U → W, which is false → false, which is okay. Then, W → (X ≡ ¬Y), which is false → (X ≡ ¬Y). So, if W is false, then (X ≡ ¬Y) can be anything, because a false premise leads to any conclusion. Then, (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is false, which implies that whenever (X ≡ ¬Y) is true, Z must be false. But if (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, then (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is automatically true, regardless of Z. So, Z can be anything. So, the conclusion is that Z can be anything, but it's not a consequence that must be true.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think again.

The question is: which of the options is a consequence of the premises.

So, the answer must be something that logically follows from the premises.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: U → Z. Well, from the premises, we have U → W, and W → (X ≡ ¬Y), and (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z, and Z is false. So, U → W, and W → (X ≡ ¬Y), and (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is false, so (X ≡ ¬Y) is false. So, (X ≡ ¬Y) is false implies that Z is false. So, Z is false. So, Z is false, which means that Z is false. So, U → Z is equivalent to U → false, which is equivalent to U → W. So, U → Z is equivalent to U → false, which is equivalent to U → W. But since W is false, U → W is equivalent to U → false, which is equivalent to U → (U → W). Hmm, perhaps that's not leading me anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as: Since we have U → W, and W → (X ≡ ¬Y), and (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z, and Z is false, then (X ≡ ¬Y) must be false, which implies that Z is false. So, from Z being false, we have that (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, which implies that W must be false. So, U → W is true, and W is false. So, U → W is equivalent to U → false, which is equivalent to U → (U → W). Hmm, perhaps that's not the way.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as follows: Since Z is false, and (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is false, it means that (X ≡ ¬Y) must be false, because if (X ≡ ¬Y) were true, then (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z would be true (since the antecedent is true and the consequent is false). But since (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is false, (X ≡ ¬Y) must be false, which implies that Z is false. So, Z is false.

Now, from W → (X ≡ ¬Y), and (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, then W → false. So, W must be false. So, W is false.

Now, from U → W, since W is false, U can be anything. Because if U is true, then W must be true, but since W is false, U must be false. So, U is false.

So, U is false, W is false, and Z is false.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B: U → Z. Since U is false, and Z is false, U → Z is always true. So, it's a consequence.

Option C: (U ∧ ~W). Since U is false and W is false, U ∧ ~W is false ∧ true, which is false. So, it's not a consequence.

Option D: (~U ∧ Z). Since U is false, ~U is true, and Z is false, so (~U ∧ Z) is true ∧ false, which is false. So, it's not a consequence.

Option E: (~W ∧ Z). Since W is false, ~W is true, and Z is false, so (~W ∧ Z) is true ∧ false, which is false. So, it's not a consequence.

Wait, so according to this, option B is a consequence.

But earlier, I thought that U → Z is a consequence, because U → W is a consequence, and W → (X ≡ ¬Y) is a consequence, and (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is a consequence, and Z is false, which implies that U → Z is a consequence. So, U → Z is a consequence.

But in this analysis, we have that U → Z is a consequence, but in the options, option B is U → Z. So, perhaps option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that U → Z is a consequence, but in the options, B is U → Z. So, perhaps option B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial reasoning. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as: Since Z is false, and (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is false, it implies that (X ≡ ¬Y) is false. So, (X ≡ ¬Y) is false. So, X is true and Y is false, or X is false and Y is true.

Now, from W → (X ≡ ¬Y), and (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, then W must be false. So, W is false.

From U → W, and W is false, U can be anything. Because U is true, then W must be true, but since W is false, U must be false. So, U is false.

Now, from U → Z, U is false, so the implication is always true. So, U → Z is a consequence.

So, according to this analysis, option B is correct.

But earlier, I thought that U → Z is a consequence, but the options don't have U → Z as an option. Wait, no, looking back, the options are:

A: ~W ∨ Z

B: U → Z

C: (U ∧ ~W)

D: (~U ∧ Z)

E: (~W ∧ Z)

So, option B is U → Z.

Wait, but in our analysis, option B is correct.

But earlier, I thought that option B is correct, but in some analysis, I thought that option B is correct.

Wait, no, in the initial analysis, after modus tollens, I thought that U → Z is a consequence, but in the options, B is U → Z, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of it in terms of truth values.

We have:

U: can be true or false.

W: can be true or false.

Z: can be true or false.

But from the premises, we have:

Premise 1: U → W. So, if U is true, then W is true. If U is false, then W can be anything.

Premise 2: W → (X ≡ ¬Y). So, if W is true, then X is true and Y is false, or X is false and Y is true.

But we also have that from Premise 3 and 4, that (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, which implies that X is true and Y is false, or X is false and Y is true.

Wait, now, since (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, then from Premise 2: W → (X ≡ ¬Y) is equivalent to W → false. So, W must be false.

So, W is false.

From Premise 1: U → W. Since W is false, U can be anything. Because if U is true, then W must be true, but since W is false, U must be false.

So, U is false.

Now, from U → Z. U is false, so the implication is always true, regardless of Z. So, U → Z is true.

So, U → Z is a consequence.

So, option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that U → Z is a consequence, but in the options, B is U → Z. So, option B is correct.

But wait, I think I'm getting mixed up here. Let me go back and make sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as follows: Since (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, then (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is false → Z must be false. So, Z is false.

Now, from U → W, since W is false, U must be false.

Now, from Z being false, and (X ≡ ¬Y) being false, which leads to Z being false.

Now, looking at the options, option B is U → Z. Since U is false, U → Z is always true, so it's a consequence.

Option A is ~W ∨ Z. Since W is false and Z is false, ~W is true and Z is false, so A is true.

Option C is (U ∧ ~W). Since U is false and ~W is true, this is false.

Option D is (~U ∧ Z). Since ~U is true and Z is false, this is false.

Option E is (~W ∧ Z). Since ~W is true and Z is false, this is false.

So, the consequences are options A, B, and E.

Wait, no, because in the options, A is ~W ∨ Z, which is true because W is false and Z is false.

B is U → Z, which is true because U is false.

E is (~W ∧ Z), which is false because Z is false.

So, the consequences are A and B.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's a single question, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as follows: Since Z is false, then (~W ∨ Z) is equivalent to (~W ∨ false), which is ~W. So, since W is false, ~W is true, so (~W ∨ Z) is true.

So, A is true.

B is U → Z. U is false, Z is false. So, U → Z is equivalent to false → false, which is true.

E is (~W ∧ Z). ~W is true, Z is false → false.

So, the consequences are options A and B.

But then, the options don't include both A and B. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the answer as option B.

Wait, but based on the analysis, option B is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of it as follows: Since Z is false, and (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, then (X ≡ ¬Y) → Z is false, which implies that (X ≡ ¬Y) is false. So, (X ≡ ¬Y) is false, which implies that W must be false. So, W is false.

Now, since W is false, U can be anything. But since U is true, W must be true, but since W is false, U must be false. So, U is false.

Now, from U → Z, since U is false, the implication is always true, regardless of Z. So, U → Z is a consequence.

So, option B is correct.

So, the answer is option B.
</think>

The correct answer is **B: U → Z**.

**Explanation:**

From the premises, we derived that Z is false. Since U → Z is always true when U is false, it is a consequence of the premises.

ANSWER: B
