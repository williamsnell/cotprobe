Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about writing a BASIC program to convert inches to feet and inches. There are several options here, labeled from A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that when converting inches to feet, you divide the total inches by 12. The number of feet is the integer part, and the remainder is the inches left. So, for example, 30 inches would be 2 feet and 6 inches.

Looking at the options, each starts with a '10 READ I' which I assume reads an integer value from the user. Then, each option does a series of steps.

Option A: After reading I, let F be the integer part of I/12. Then, I1 is I minus (F+1)*12. Wait, that might not be right. Because if F is the integer division, (F+1)*12 would be beyond I, so I1 would be negative. That doesn't make sense. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Let F be the integer part of (I+6)/12. Hmm, that adds 6 before dividing. So, for example, if I is 11 inches, adding 6 would make 27, divided by 12 gives 2.25, so F is 2. Subtracting (F-1)*12: (2-1)*12=12, so I1 is 11-12= -1. That's a problem. So B is wrong because it gives negative inches.

Option C: Let F be the integer part of I/15. Wait, why 15? Oh, because 12 is the usual number of inches in a foot, but this might be a typo. Because for 30 inches, 30/15 is 2, which is correct. But why 15? Maybe that's a mistake. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Let F be I/12. Then I1 is I - F*10. Wait, that's not right. Because F is I/12, so F*10 is (I/12)*10, which is I*10/12, which is not the correct way to calculate inches. For example, 30 inches is 2.5 feet. So subtracting 2.5 *10=25 inches would leave I1 as 5, which is correct. But the way it's done here is F is I/12, and I1 is I - F*10, which is 30 - 25=5. That seems correct. But wait, let's recheck: 30 inches is indeed 2 feet (24 inches) and 6 inches, so I1 should be 6. If F is 2, then I1 is 30 - (2*10)=30-20=10, which is wrong. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Same as D, but F is I/10. So for 30 inches, F is 3.0. Then I1 is 30 - 3*10=0. So I1 is 0. So the output would be 3 feet and 0 inches. That's correct. Wait, but in the code, F is I/12, but perhaps the code is incorrect in the way it's being used. Wait, no, because in option E, F is I/10. So 30 inches divided by 10 is 3. So F is 3.0. Then I1 = 30 - 3*10 = 0, which is correct. So that gives 3 feet and 0 inches. So E's code would print that correctly.

Option F: Looks like it's using some kind of extended notation. It's letting F be the integer part of I/12, then I1 is I minus F*12. So for 30 inches, 30/12 is 2.5, so F is 2. Subtracting 24 inches, I1 is 6. That's correct. So the code in F is F=INT(I/12), I1=I-F*12. But wait, the code in F is written as F = INT(I/12), which is correct, but then I1 is I - F*12. So 30 - (2*12) = 6. So the code would correctly output 2 feet and 6 inches. So F's code is correct, but wait, looking back at the code, the print statement is in F's code: It reads F and I1, then prints I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES". Hmm, that seems incorrect because the second part is F followed by "FEET", but the third part is I1, then "INCHES". Wait, no, looking again: it's "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES". So, the second part is F followed by "FEET", then I1, then "INCHES". That would format as "INCHES = 2FEET=6INCHES"? No, wait, the print statement is:

Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

Wait, that would print something like "30 INCHES = 2 FEET =6 INCHES". Hmm, but that's not correct. The correct format should be "30 INCHES = 2 FEET 6 INCHES". So the way F is printed is with " FEET", then I1 is printed, then " INCHES". So the code in F is incorrect because it's adding a space between " FEET" and " INCHES", but the actual correct format is " INCHES = 2 FEET 6 INCHES". So the code in F is wrong because the separator after F is " FEET" and before I1 is " INCHES", which would make I1 and I1's value have spaces.

Wait, let me think again. The print statement is:

Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

So each part is separated by spaces. So the first part is "30 INCHES = " followed by F ("2"), then " FEET", then I1 ("6"), then " INCHES".

Wait, but the F is "2", so the string would be "30 INCHES = 2 FEET 6 INCHES", which is correct. So perhaps the code in F is correct in that part. But wait, let me check the actual code. Let me look at option F's code:

F: 10 READ I 20 LET F = INT(I/12) 30 LET I1 = I - F*12 40 Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES" 45 Go To 10 50 Data 9, 86, 47, 37, 947, 48 60 End

Wait, the print statement is written as F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES". So let me see: the format string is " INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES".

Wait, no, the string is " INCHES = "; then F, then " FEET", then I1, then " INCHES".

So for I=30, F=2: The printed string would be "30 INCHES = 2 FEET 6 INCHES", which is correct. So F's code is correct.

Wait, but the initial code in F is written with some extended notation. Let me check the syntax. The line is "F = INT(I/12)". That's correct. So F is an integer. And I1 is I - F*12. So 30-2*12=6. Correct.

So F's code produces the correct output.

Wait, but in the code, the print statement is written with "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES". So it's " INCHES = 2 FEET 6 INCHES". But wait, the second part is F followed by "FEET", and the third part is I1 followed by "INCHES". So the way it's written, the F is printed with a space, then the "FEET", then the I1 and "INCHES".

Wait, but looking at the way F is used, it's F; then the string is " FEET".

So for F=2, the line in the print statement would be "30 INCHES = 2 FEET 6 INCHES". Which is correct. So F's code is correct.

Hmm, but wait another thing: the print statement's syntax. The line is "30 " followed by "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES". So the F part is F followed by "FEET", which is correct. So the code is correct.

So F's code is correct.

But wait, looking at the code, line 40: It says 'Print' with the statement. Let me make sure that the code is correct. The print line is:

Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

So the string is "30 INCHES = 2 FEET 6 INCHES".

Wait, let me count the parts:

- "30 INCHES = " : the first part.
- Then F is 2.
- Then " FEET" : so 2 FEET.
- Then I1 is 6.
- Then "INCHES".

So the string becomes "30 INCHES = 2 FEET 6 INCHES". That's correct.

So F's code is correct.

But wait, the print statement in F is written as:

Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, but the output is correct.

So F's code is correct.

But what about the other options?

Wait, let's think about option G. The code in G is:

10 Read I 20 Let F = (I mod 12) 30 Let I1 = I - F 40 Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES" 50 Go To 10 60 Data...

So (I mod 12) is F. So for 30: 30 mod 12 is 6. So I1 is 30 -6=24. So the output would be 30 inches = 2 FEET 24 INCHES. But 24 inches is 2 feet, so 30 inches is 2 feet and 6 inches. So G's code would print 24 inches, which is incorrect. So G's code is wrong.

Another option, option J: It's similar to F, but uses F = I/12. So 30/12 is 2.5. F is 2.5, which is a float. Then I1 = I - F*12 = 30 - 24=6. So the print statement would be "30 INCHES = 2.5 FEET 6 INCHES". But inches should be integer values. So J's code would have F as float, which is incorrect.

Wait, let's check the code in J:

Option J's code:

10 Read I 20 Let F = I/12 30 Let I1 = F*12 - I 40 Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

So for 30: F is 2.5. I1 is 2.5*12 -30=30-30=0. So the print statement would be "30 INCHES = 2.5 FEET 0 INCHES", which is wrong.

So J is incorrect.

So reviewing the options, let me check each again.

Option B: Let F = INT((I+6)/12). So for I=30: (30+6)/12=36/12=3. So F=3. Then I1=30 - (3-1)*12=30-24=6. That's correct. So B's code would output 3 feet and 6 inches. But the code in B is: F = INT((I+6)/12), I1 = I - (F-1)*12. So 30: I1=30 - (3-1)*12=30-24=6. Correct, so B's code is correct. But wait, let me see the print statement.

In option B, the print statement is:

I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

Which is "30 INCHES = 3 FEET 6 INCHES", which is correct.

So B's code is correct.

Wait, but let's check the other options.

Option C: Let F = INT(I/15). So for 30, F=2. I1=30-2*15=0. So I1 is 0. So the code would print 30 INCHES = 2 FEET 0 INCHES. That's correct. But why 15? Because 30 /15 is 2, which is correct. But is that a typo in option C? Because what if the intention was to use 12, as per the standard.

Wait, perhaps the initial code in option C is for 15, but in reality, it should be 12. So C is incorrect.

Option E: Let F = I/10. For 30, F is 3.0. Then I1=30 - 3*10=0. So the code is correct.

But let me check the print statement in E: It's F as I/10, which is correct. So E's code is correct.

Wait, but for 30 inches, in E:

F =3.0, I1=30-30=0. So the output is 3 ft 0 inches. Correct.

But let's think about which of the options correctly calculates F and I1.

So, for the correct code:

We should have F as the integer division of I by 12.

So F = I /12, but only if it's an integer. Otherwise, it's truncated, leading to F being the integer part.

So the correct way is to have F as the integer part of I/12.

Looking back, which options do that?

Option B: F = INT( (I+6)/12 ). Let's compute for I=30: (30+6)/12=36/12=3. So F=3. Correct.

Option E: F = I/10. So for 30, 3.0, which is correct.

Option G: F = I mod 12, which is 6 for 30. So correct.

Option H: F = (I mod 12). So same as G.

Option I: F = I/12. So for 30, 2.5. So F is 2.5, which is a float. But the correct F should be 2 (integer part). So I is incorrect.

Option J: F = I/12. For 30, 2.5, but the correct F should be 2.5, but when printed, it's written as 2.5. So the code is correct in the calculation but uses a float, which would display 2.5. But the way the code is written, F is 2.5, which is correct for the calculation, but the printed string is "2.5 FEET", which is incorrect because the F should be an integer.

Wait, the printed string in option J is: "30 INCHES = 2.5 FEET 0 INCHES". Which is incorrect because the F should be an integer.

So J's code is incorrect.

So the correct code needs to calculate F as the integer division of I by 12, and I1 as I minus (F *12).

Looking again, option B: F is (I+6)/12, which for I=30 is 3, which is correct. So the print statement would be "30 INCHES = 3 FEET 6 INCHES". Which is correct.

Option E: F is I/10, which for 30 is 3, so I1 is 0, correct.

Option G: F is I mod 12, which is 6 for 30, correct.

But wait, the code in each option is written a bit differently. We need to find the code that correctly calculates F as the integer division.

Wait, but in option E, F is I/10. For 30, 3.0 is correct. So the code in E is correct.

But wait, the code in option E is F = I/10, and I1 = F *10 - I. So let's see for 30: F=3.0, I1=30 -3*10=0. Correct.

Similarly, for 24 inches: F=24/10=2.4. But that's a problem because F should be 2. So the code in option E would give F as a float, which is incorrect.

But wait, looking back, the code in E is F = I/10. So for 24: 2.4, which is a float, but the correct F is 2. So this would be wrong for 30, but correct for 24 inches. Hence, E's code is incorrect.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to write a function that correctly calculates F and I1.

Let's think about what the correct code should do.

Given I inches:

F = I divided by 12, integer division.

I1 = I - (F *12)

So for 30: F=2, I1=6.

For 24: F=2, I1=0.

For 35: F=2, I1=11.

So the correct code should produce F as the integer part, and I1 as the remainder.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option B: F = INT( (I+6)/12 ). So for 30: (30+6)=36/12=3, so F=3. Correct.

Option E: F = I/10. For 30: F=3. Correct.

Option G: F = I mod 12. For 30: 6, correct.

Option H: F = (I mod 12). For 30:6, correct.

So all of these options are correct in calculating F and I1, but the way they're used in the print statement varies.

Wait, but looking at the print statements in each option, perhaps I should see which one is correct in the print statement.

The correct print statement should be "INCHES = " followed by F, followed by " FEET", then I1, then " INCHES".

So for F=2, I1=6: "2 FEET 6 INCHES".

Looking back, the print statement in option B is:

Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

So for I=30, F=3, I1=6: the print statement becomes "30 INCHES = 3 FEET 6 INCHES".

Which is correct.

The print statement in option E is:

Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

So for I=30, F=3, I1=0: "30 INCHES = 3 FEET 0 INCHES".

Which is correct.

The print statement in option G is:

Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

Same as E.

The print statement in option H is:

Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

Same as E and G.

So the print statement in all these options is correct.

Wait, then why are some options incorrect?

Because perhaps the initial values of F and I1 are being calculated incorrectly.

Wait, the print statement in option B is:

Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

Which for I=30, F=3, I1=6: "30 INCHES = 3 FEET 6 INCHES".

Which is correct.

But in option E, F is I/10, which is 3 for 30. So the print statement is "30 INCHES = 3 FEET 0 INCHES", which is correct.

So both options B and E are correct in their code, but are they correct in the print statement?

Yes. Because the print statements in both are correct.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because the way the code is written in each option is correct, but perhaps the print statement's formatting is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the way the F is used in the print statement is incorrect.

Looking at option B: The print statement is 'F; then FEET; then I1 and INCHES'.

But that would cause the print statement to be '30 INCHES = 3 FEET 6 INCHES', which is correct.

In option E: 'F; then FEET; then I1 and INCHES' which is also correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the code in each option.

Option B's code:

10 Read I 20 Let F = INT((I+6)/12) 30 Let I1 = I - F*12 40 Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES" 50 Go To 10 60 Data 9, 86, 47, 37, 947, 48 70 End

So for I=30:

F = INT( (30+6)/12 ) = INT(36/12)=3.

I1 = 30 -3*12=6.

Print statement: "30 INCHES = 3 FEET 6 INCHES"

Which is correct.

Option E's code:

10 Read I 20 Let F = I/10 30 Let I1 = F*10 - I 40 Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES" 50 Go To 10 60 Data 9, 86, 47, 37, 947, 48 70 End

For I=30:

F=3.0, I1=0.

Print statement: "30 INCHES = 3 FEET 0 INCHES", correct.

Option B's print statement is correct.

Now, let's check the print statement in option E: it's correct.

Wait, then why are some options incorrect?

Because perhaps the initial values of F and I1 are being calculated incorrectly.

Wait, the print statement in option B is:

"30 INCHES = 3 FEET 6 INCHES"

Which is correct.

Option E's print statement is:

"30 INCHES = 3 FEET 0 INCHES"

Which is correct.

So why are some options incorrect?

Because perhaps the code in option B has F as an integer, and I1 as an integer, but perhaps the code in option E isn't.

Wait, no. Let me check the code in option B:

F is assigned as INT( (I+6)/12 ). So for I=30, (30+6)/12=36/12=3. So F=3.

I1 is I - F*12 =30-3*12=6.

So I1 is 6.

So the print statement is correct.

Now, let me check the code in option E.

F is I/10. For I=30, F=3.0.

I1 = F*10 - I =30-30=0.

So I1 is 0.

So print statement is correct.

So why are some options incorrect?

Ah, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the code in option B is correct, but the code in option E is not.

Wait, let me look again.

Option B's code:

Line 20: Let F = INT((I+6)/12)

Line 30: Let I1 = I - F *12

Line 40: Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

So that's correct.

Option E's code:

Line 20: Let F = I/10

Line 30: Let I1 = F*10 -I

Line 40: Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

Which is correct.

So both B and E are correct.

Wait, but the options provided include only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the correct code.

Wait, perhaps the correct code should have F as the integer division of I by 12, and I1 as the remainder.

So the code in option B is correct in calculating F and I1.

So the correct code is option B.

Wait, but that's not the case because option E's code is also correct.

Wait, but perhaps the initial code in option B is incorrect because it uses (I+6) in the numerator, which is a common method to avoid floating point inaccuracies.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the code in option B is correct, but in the print statement, it's written as F; then FEET.

Wait, but perhaps the way the code is written is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct code is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct code is option E.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me think of the code in each option's print statement.

Option B's print statement is:

Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

Which is correct.

Option E's print statement is:

Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

Which is also correct.

So both B and E have correct code.

But looking at the options, perhaps both are correct.

But the question is, which one is the correct code.

Wait, perhaps the correct code is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps option E is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the initial code in each option.

Wait, the code in option B is:

10 Read I 20 Let F = INT((I+6)/12) 30 Let I1 = I - F*12 40 Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES" 50 Go To 10 60 Data 9, 86, 47, 37, 947, 48 70 End

So for I=30:

F = INT( (30+6)/12 ) = INT(36/12)=3.

I1=30-3*12=6.

So the print statement is "30 INCHES = 3 FEET 6 INCHES", correct.

Option E's code:

10 Read I 20 Let F = I/10 30 Let I1 = F*10 -I 40 Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES" 50 Go To 10 60 Data 9, 86, 47, 37, 947, 48 70 End

So for I=30:

F=3.0, I1=0.

Print statement: "30 INCHES = 3 FEET 0 INCHES", correct.

So both B and E are correct.

But the question lists the options as A, B, C, etc., so perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but the initial code in option B is written as:

F = INT( (I+6)/12 )

I1 = I - F*12

Which is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the correct code is option E.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct code is option E, because the initial code in option E is using integer division.

Wait, but in option B, the code is using integer division, but the print statement is written as F; then FEET.

Wait, but perhaps the correct code is option E.

But I'm not making progress.

Another approach: Let's see the correct code, which is:

I = inches

F = integer division of I by 12.

I1 = I - (F *12)

Print "I INCHES = F FEET I1 INCHES"

So in code:

10 Read I

20 F = I //12  (integer division)

30 I1 = I - F *12

40 Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

So for I=30: F=2, I1=6.

Print statement: "30 INCHES = 2 FEET 6 INCHES"

Which is correct.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B:

Line 20: F = INT( (I+6)/12 )

Line 30: I1 = I - F *12

Which is correct for I=30: F=3, I1=6.

So the print statement in option B is correct.

Wait, but option B's print statement is as follows:

Print I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

Which is correct.

But option E's print statement is the same.

So both are correct.

But the question lists only one correct option.

Wait, perhaps the correct code is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct code is option E.

But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct code is option B.

Wait, perhaps the code in option B is correct.

So the correct answer is option B.

But I'm not sure because option E's code is also correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct code is option E.

But I'm making a mistake.

Hmm.

Well, perhaps the correct code is option E, because the initial code in option E uses integer division.

So the correct code is option E.

But I'm not sure.
