Hmm, okay, so I've got this question about an inductor and voltage. Alright, let me think this through. I remember that inductors store energy in a magnetic field when current flows through them. And there's a relationship between the inductor's voltage and the rate of change of current. Oh right, the formula is V = L * di/dt. Yeah, that sounds right.

So the question gives the current as i_L(t) = 0.1 sin(10^6 t). They're asking for the voltage V_L(t) across the inductor. Alright, so I need to find the derivative of i_L with respect to time.

Let me write that down: V_L = L * d(i_L)/dt. L is given as 1e-3 henrys, which is 0.001 H. So plugging in, V_L = 0.001 * d(0.1 sin(10^6 t))/dt.

Now, the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), and then the chain rule comes in. The derivative of sin(10^6 t) with respect to t is 10^6 cos(10^6 t). So putting it into the equation: d(i_L)/dt = 0.1 * 10^6 cos(10^6 t). Wait, 0.1 is the same as 1e-1. So 1e-1 * 1e6 is 1e5? Wait, 0.1 * 1e6 is 1e5. Oh yeah, 1e6 is a million. So that makes d(i_L)/dt = 1e5 * cos(1e6 t). 

Then, multiply by L which is 0.001 H: V_L = 0.001 * 1e5 * cos(1e6 t). Let's compute 0.001 * 1e5. 0.001 is 1e-3. So 1e-3 * 1e5 is 1e2, which is 100. So V_L = 100 cos(1e6 t). 

Looking at the options, that's option C. Let me check the options again. Option C is 1cos(1e6 t), but wait, my calculation says 100. Hmm, did I make a mistake? Let me recount.

Wait, i_L(t) is 0.1 sin(1e6 t). So the derivative is 0.1 * 1e6 cos(1e6 t). Multiply by L = 1e-3. So (0.1 *1e6) is 1e5. 1e5 * 1e-3 is 1e2, which is 100. Oh, I see. So V_L is 100 * cos(1e6 t). So option C is 1*cos. Hmm, wait no, option C is 1*cos, but I have 100. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the setup again. Oh wait, the current is 0.1 sin(1e6 t). So when you take the derivative, it's 0.1 * 1e6 cos(1e6 t) = 1e5 cos(1e6 t). Then multiply by L = 0.001 H. So 0.001 * 1e5 = 1e2. So yes, 100 cos(1e6 t). So the correct option is C, but wait option C is 1 cos, which is 1 times cos, but I have 100. Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake. Oh wait, another possibility: perhaps the current is 0.1 sin, but in the question the current is i_L(t) = 0.1 sin(1e6 t), so the derivative is 0.1 *1e6 cos(...), which is 1e5 cos(...). Multiply by 0.001, gives 1e2 cos, which is 100 cos. So the correct answer should be V_L(t) = 100 cos(1e6 t). So looking at the options, option C is 1cos, which is 1. So that can't be right. Did I make an error in the calculation?

Wait, let me recheck.

Current: i_L(t) = 0.1 sin(1e6 t)
di_L/dt = 0.1 * 1e6 * cos(1e6 t) = 1e5 * cos(1e6 t)
V_L = L * di/dt = 0.001 * 1e5 * cos(1e6 t) = 100 * cos(1e6 t)
So V_L(t) = 100 cos(1e6 t). So the correct option is C: 100 cos(1e6 t). Wait, option C is written as 1cos, which would be 1, but I have 100. So that suggests I made a mistake. Hmm. So perhaps I should double-check the formula.

Wait, wait a second. The formula is V = L di/dt. So yes, correct. And the derivative of sin is cos, correct. So perhaps the answer is option C which is 100 cos. Oh, but none of the other options match that. Let me look again.

At the options:

A: 0.1 cos(1e6 t)
B: 100 cos(1e6 t)
C: 1 cos(1e6 t)
D: 1e-3 cos(1e6 t)
E: 0.01 sin(1e6 t)
F: 1e4 sin(1e6 t)
G: 1e6 cos(1e6 t)
H: 10 sin(1e6 t)
I: 0.1 sin(1e6 t)
J: 1e4 sin(1e6 t)

So yeah, option B is 100 cos. So that's the correct one. So why am I in doubt? Oh wait, perhaps I missed a decimal. Wait, 0.1 * 1e6 is 1e5, multiply by 0.001 is 1e2. So 100 is correct. So the correct answer is option B. But wait, the options say B is 100 cos(1e6 t), which matches.

Wait, another way to think: perhaps I messed up the formula. Because sometimes, I get confused between inductors and capacitors. But for inductors, V is L * di/dt, which is correct. So my calculation seems right.

So the correct answer is option B. But wait, looking at the initial problem, the current is 0.1 sin(1e6 t). So the voltage across it, according to the formula, would be V_L = 100 cos(1e6 t), so option B is correct. But wait, the options listed in the problem have option C as 1 cos and option B as 100 cos. So the correct option is B.

To determine the voltage \( V_L(t) \) across the inductor, we use the relationship for inductors:

\[
V_L(t) = L \frac{dI_L(t)}{dt}
\]

Given:
- Inductance \( L = 10^{-3} \, \text{H} \)
- Current \( I_L(t) = 0.1 \sin(10^6 t) \)

First, compute the derivative of \( I_L(t) \) with respect to time \( t \):
\[
\frac{dI_L(t)}{dt} = 0.1 \cdot 10^6 \cos(10^6 t) = 10^5 \cos(10^6 t)
\]

Next, multiply by the inductance \( L \) to find \( V_L(t) \):
\[
V_L(t) = L \cdot \frac{dI_L(t)}{dt} = 10^{-3} \cdot 10^5 \cos(10^6 t) = 100 \cos(10^6 t)
\]

Thus, the voltage across the inductor is \( V_L(t) = 100 \cos(10^6 t) \).

Now, compare this result with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( 0.1 \cos(10^6 t) \) — Incorrect.
- **Option B**: \( 100 \cos(10^6 t) \) — Correct.
- **Option C**: \( 1 \cos(10^6 t) \) — Incorrect.
- **Option D**: \( 10^{-3} \cos(10^6 t) \) — Incorrect.
- **Option E**: \( 0.01 \sin(10^6 t) \) — Incorrect.
- **Option F**: \( 10^4 \sin(10^6 t) \) — Incorrect.
- **Option G**: \( 10^6 \cos(10^6 t) \) — Incorrect.
- **Option H**: \( 10 \sin(10^6 t) \) — Incorrect.
- **Option I**: \( 0.1 \sin(10^6 t) \) — Incorrect.
- **Option J**: \( 10^4 \sin(10^6 t) \) — Incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**.
