Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. It says that four packages are delivered to four houses, one each. The deliveries are random, and we need to find the probability that exactly two of them end up at the correct houses. The answer needs to be a common fraction, and I have to choose from the options provided.

Hmm, okay, so this is a permutation problem, right? Because we're dealing with arranging packages. Since the deliveries are random, each permutation of the packages is equally likely. 

I remember that in permutation problems, the number of possible arrangements is n factorial, where n is the number of items. So here, n is 4, meaning there are 4! = 24 possible ways to deliver the packages.

Now, the question is about exactly two being delivered correctly. So I need to count how many permutations result in exactly two correct deliveries and then divide that by the total number of permutations to get the probability.

Wait, but how do I count the number of permutations with exactly two correct? Hmm, I think this relates to derangements. A derangement is a permutation where none of the items are in their correct position. But here we want exactly two correct, not none. So maybe I can approach it another way.

Let me think. If I choose two packages to be correctly delivered, the remaining two must not be correct. So first, I choose which two are correct. The number of ways to choose two packages out of four is given by the combination formula C(4,2). Calculating that: C(4,2) = 6. So there are 6 ways to choose the two correct packages.

Now, the remaining two packages must not go to their correct houses. So we need to count the number of derangements for two items. Wait, for two items, the derangements would be zero because derangements involve permutations with no fixed points. Wait, for two items, there's only one possible permutation, which swaps them, so that's one derangement. Wait, no—wait, derangements for n items is n! multiplied by the sum from k=0 to n of (-1)^k /k! So for n=2, it's 2!*(1 - 1 + 1/2) = 2*(0.5) = 1. So there's one derangement for two items. So that means the remaining two packages can't be delivered correctly, so they must be a derangement, which is just one way.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, derangements for two items: if you have two items, say A and B, the derangements are the permutations where neither A nor B is in their original position. So the original arrangement is AB. The only derangement is BA, which is indeed one. So for two items, there's exactly one derangement.

So putting it all together, the number of favorable permutations is the number of ways to choose two correct ones (which is 6) multiplied by the number of derangements for the remaining two (which is 1). So total favorable is 6 * 1 = 6.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because the derangements for the remaining two would actually be 1, so yes. So the total number of favorable permutations is 6.

So the probability is the number of favorable permutations divided by total permutations, which is 6/24, which simplifies to 1/4. So the probability is 1/4. Looking at the options, that's option D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me think again. Another way to approach this is to consider the inclusion-exclusion principle or using the formula for the number of permutations with exactly k fixed points.

The formula for the number of permutations of n elements with exactly k fixed points is C(n,k) multiplied by the subfactorial of (n-k), which is ! (n−k). So in our case, n=4 and k=2. So it's C(4,2) * !2.

We know C(4,2) is 6. And !2 is the number of derangements for 2 elements, which is 1. So yes, 6 * 1 = 6. So the number of favorable permutations is 6, and total permutations is 24. So 6/24 = 1/4. So yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, but is there another way to think about this problem? Maybe by considering all possibilities. Let's try enumerating all possible permutations of 4 items to see if that helps. But that might take too long, but for n=4, the number of permutations is 24, which isn't too bad.

Alternatively, think about the inclusion-exclusion principle. The number of permutations with exactly two fixed points is:

C(4,2) * (number of derangements for the remaining 2 elements) = 6 * 1 = 6.

So that's the same as before.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it using the formula for derangements. The number of derangements D(n) is n! * (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^n /n!). So for n=2, D(2) is 2!*(1 - 1 + 1/2) = 1. Which is correct.

So, yes, the number of derangements for 2 is 1. So the total number of favorable permutations is 6*1=6.

Thus, the probability is 6/24=1/4.

So the answer should be D: 1/4.

The probability that exactly two packages are delivered correctly out of four is calculated by considering the number of ways to choose two correct packages (C(4,2) = 6) and the derangements of the remaining two (D(2) = 1). Thus, the number of favorable permutations is 6. Dividing this by the total permutations (4! = 24) gives 6/24 = 1/4.
