Okay, so I've got this hydrodynamics problem to solve. Let me read it again. The question is about determining the power needed to drive a pump. Hmm, let's break it down.

The given data: 600 gallons per hour (gal/hr) of water is pumped to a height of 25 ft through a pipe. The pipe has an inside diameter of 2 inches, a surface roughness of 0.0007 ft, and a total length of 625 ft. There are valves and other fittings equivalent to 300 pipe diameters. Additionally, there's an extra pressure loss of 8 ft of water. The pump is 65% efficient. We need to find the power required.

Wait, first, I remember that power can be calculated using the formula: Power (in horsepower) equals the head multiplied by the flow rate divided by the efficiency, then multiplied by some conversion factors.

But wait, let me think about the correct formula. Oh right, the formula for the required power is Power = (Head * Flow Rate) / Efficiency * (1 / efficiency), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact factors. Alternatively, I remember that the head is in feet, flow in gallons per hour, and the power is in horsepower.

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gal/hr) ) * ( conversion factor ) / Efficiency.

Wait, I think the formula is Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * 0.0226 / (efficiency). Or is it something else? No, wait, probably the head is in feet and the flow is in gallons per minute. Hmm, wait, no, this problem uses gal/hr. Oh, right, so I'll have to adjust.

Let me make a plan. First, find the head required to pump 600 gal/hr to 25 ft head. Then, account for the pressure loss and the efficiency of the pump.

Wait, I think the head (H) is the pressure head plus the friction loss head. So H = head due to pump + head due to friction.

Wait, the problem states that there is an additional pressure loss of 8 ft of water. So perhaps the friction loss is 8 ft, and the pump must supply the head to overcome that plus the head needed to lift the water to 25 ft.

Wait, no, the problem says 25 ft is the height to pump the water. So the pump must provide head of 25 ft plus the friction head, right? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the pump is driving the flow, so the head that the pump provides is the head that must overcome the friction plus the head needed to lift the water by 25 ft. Because the pump is taking water from a lower elevation and pumping it to 25 ft higher.

Wait, no, wait. No, the pump is taking water from the lower point and is pushing it to a higher point. So the head required is the sum of the head needed to do the elevation gain and the head to overcome friction. So H_total = H_elevation + H_friction.

Wait, but the problem says the pressure loss is 8 ft of water. So maybe the friction head is 8 ft. So H_total is 25 ft (elevation change) plus 8 ft (friction head) = 33 ft.

Wait, but wait: the pump must not only provide the head to overcome the elevation change (25 ft) but also the head to overcome the friction losses. So the total head (H) is 25 ft (for the elevation) plus the head due to friction, which is 8 ft. So H = 33 ft.

But wait, let me think again. The head provided by the pump is the head that the water has to overcome. So if the pump is moving water from a lower elevation to higher, it's like a pump. So the head H is the total the pump has to supply, which includes the head to pump it up (25 ft) and the head to overcome friction (friction head).

So H = 25 ft (elevation) + 8 ft (friction) = 33 ft.

Now, I can compute the head in feet, which is correct.

Next, I need to convert the flow rate into gallons per second (since the head is in feet and flow in gpm). Because the formula I remember is:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * (0.02285) / (efficiency)

Wait, or perhaps I should use the formula with head in feet and flow in gpm.

Wait, another approach: The formula for head (H) in terms of flow rate (Q) is H = (Q * g) / (A * η), but that might not be right. Wait, perhaps the formula is H = (Q * g) / (A * η), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the head in terms of head per second, which is head (in feet) = (flow rate in gpm) * 4.858/ (7.4805) ) / (pipe's length * friction factor), but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) / ( 377 ) * (1 / efficiency )

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

The formula for the head in terms of flow rate and pressure is H = (Q * g) / (A * η), where g is acceleration due to gravity, but I think this is for a unit system that's not SI. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula: Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * 0.0226 / (efficiency)

Wait, I've heard before that the head in feet can be multiplied by the flow in gpm, divided by an efficiency factor, then multiplied by 0.022 hp per (gpm·ft). Let me check.

Wait, I found an online formula once that said:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * 0.022 / (efficiency) / 1000.

Wait, no, not sure. Alternatively, I'll try the dimensional analysis.

The units:

Power is in horsepower.

Head is in feet.

Flow rate is in gpm.

So, the formula should be something like:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * (1) / (efficiency) * (conversion factor)

But I'm not getting the unit right. Let me think of the formula in terms of units.

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * (gpm/ft) * (hp/(gpm·ft)) ) * efficiency.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, the correct formula for the head (H) in terms of flow rate (Q) is H = ( Q * g ) / ( A * η ), but Q is in gpm, g is in ft/s², A is in square feet, η is unitless.

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert all the units to SI and then compute.

Wait, maybe I can find a formula that directly uses the given units.

Let me recall: The head (in feet) is equal to (Flow rate (gpm) * 0.408 ) / (Head loss in feet) ) * (1 / efficiency). No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * 0.022 / (efficiency) * 0.55

Wait, no, that's not correct. Maybe I should use the general formula for power in terms of head and flow.

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * 0.022 / (efficiency) * ( 1 / (1 - efficiency) )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * 0.022 / (efficiency)

Wait, that's a plausible formula. Let me check the units:

Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) → (ft * gpm). 

But to get horsepower, I might need to multiply by some conversion factor. Let me think: 1 hp = 550 ft·lbf per second. But I'm not sure how to directly relate gpm and ft.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * (Q (gpm) ) ) / ( (A * η) ) ) * (1/efficiency) ?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Darcy-Weisbach equation, which gives the head loss due to friction. The head loss (Hf) is equal to (f * L * V² ) / ( 2 g D ), where f is the friction factor, L is the length of the pipe, V is the velocity, D is the diameter, and g is acceleration due to gravity.

Wait, but I don't know the friction factor, which depends on the pipe's material, length, and other factors. Alternatively, perhaps I can estimate it using the given data.

Wait, the problem states that the pipeline has a total length of 625 ft, with additional pressure loss of 8 ft. So the total pressure loss is 8 ft plus the friction loss, which we might need to calculate.

Wait, but first, let me find the head of the pump. The pump must supply the head needed to overcome both the elevation (25 ft) and the friction loss (8 ft). So H_total = 25 + 8 = 33 ft.

So the head is 33 ft.

Next, I need to find the flow rate (Q), which is given as 600 gal/hr. Wait, but I need to convert that to gallons per second (gpm) because the formula I'm thinking about uses gpm.

600 gal/hr is 600 / 3600 = 0.1667 gpm.

Wait, no, because 1 hour is 3600 seconds, so 600 gal/hr is 600 / 3600 = 0.1667 gpm. So Q = 0.1667 gpm.

Wait, but I need to compute the head in terms of Q. Oh, but I'm getting stuck because I need the friction factor, which depends on the pipe's length, diameter, roughness, and maybe the type of pipe. But the problem doesn't provide that information.

Wait, but the problem says that the additional pressure loss is 8 ft. So perhaps that 8 ft is the friction head. So the friction head is 8 ft, and the elevation head is 25 ft. So the total head is 33 ft.

But wait, the formula for power is:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Q (gpm) ) * ( conversion factor ) / ( efficiency )

Wait, I'm not recalling the exact conversion factor. Another approach: perhaps I should use the formula:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * (Q (gpm) ) * 0.022 ) / ( efficiency )

But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Q (gpm) ) * ( 1 ) / ( efficiency ) * ( 0.022 ) / 1000

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait another idea: the formula for the power required is ( head * flow rate ) / ( efficiency ) * ( 0.022 hp per gpm·ft ). Alternatively, the formula is:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Q (gpm) ) * ( 0.022 ) / ( efficiency )

Let me plug in the numbers.

Head is 33 ft.

Q is 600 gal/hr → 0.1667 gpm.

Efficiency is 65% → 0.65.

So, H =33 ft.

Power (hp) = (33 * 0.1667 ) * 0.022 / 0.65

Compute that:

33 * 0.1667 = 5.5

5.5 * 0.022 = 0.121

0.121 / 0.65 ≈ 0.186 hp.

Wait, that's approximately 0.186 hp. Looking at the options, option H is 0.14 hp, option G is 0.10, etc. Hmm, 0.186 is close to 0.18, which is option H? Wait, option H is 0.14? No, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A:0.16, B:0.25, C:0.20, D:0.18, E:0.12, F:0.08, G:0.10, H:0.14, I:0.22, J:0.15.

Wait, option D is 0.18. Hmm, but I got 0.186. So approximately 0.19, but the options don't have that. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a unit conversion mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the head is actually 25 ft plus the pressure loss of 8 ft, but the pressure loss is not the same as head loss. Hmm, but in the formula, the head loss is part of the head required.

Wait, another approach: the total head required is head for elevation (25 ft) plus head for pressure loss (8 ft) → 33 ft.

So, H =33 ft.

Q is 600 gal/hr → 0.1667 gpm.

Now, the formula is:

Power (hp) = ( H * Q ) * ( conversion factor ) / (efficiency )

What's the conversion factor? I think it's 0.022 hp per (gpm·ft). So:

Power = (33 ft * 0.1667 gpm ) * 0.022 / 0.65.

Compute step by step.

33 * 0.1667 = 5.5.

5.5 * 0.022 = 0.121.

0.121 / 0.65 ≈ 0.186 hp.

Which is approximately 0.19 hp. But the options don't have 0.19.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 0.18.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion factor. Let me double-check the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Power (hp) = ( H * Q ) * 0.022 / (efficiency)

So 33 * 0.1667 = 5.5; 5.5 * 0.022 = 0.121; 0.121 / 0.65 ≈ 0.186. Still about 0.19 hp.

But the closest option is D (0.18) and H (0.14). Wait, maybe I should consider the efficiency. The problem states the pump is 65% efficient, so need to divide by 0.65.

Wait, let me recalculate:

33 * 0.1667 =5.5.

5.5 * 0.022 =0.121.

0.121 / 0.65 = 0.186.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D, 0.18 hp. But wait, the options don't have 0.19. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, let me think about the units again. Maybe I should use the head in terms of head per foot and multiply by the flow rate in gpm.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the required power, neglecting head loss, is:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * ( 0.022 ) / ( efficiency )

So, 33 * 0.1667 =5.5.

5.5 *0.022 =0.121.

Divide by 0.65: 0.121 /0.65 ≈0.186 hp.

So, approximately 0.19 hp, which is closest to option D (0.18) or H (0.14). Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another formula I remember is:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * ( 1 ) / ( 377 ) * (1 / efficiency )

Wait, 377 is a constant when using certain units, perhaps. Let me compute that.

33 * 0.1667 =5.5.

5.5 / 377 ≈0.01457.

0.01457 /0.65≈0.0224 hp. That can't be right. Because 0.0224 hp would be 0.022 hp, but the options don't have that. So perhaps that's not the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the equation that includes the friction factor. So, friction head (Hf) is given by f * (L / D) * (V^2), where V is the velocity.

But we don't know the friction factor 'f'. Alternatively, perhaps I can estimate 'f' using the Moody diagram, but without knowing the pipe's length and roughness, it's tricky. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the head required is 25 ft plus 8 ft, which is 33 ft, and that the pump provides that head plus any pressure losses. But I think that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * 0.022 / ( efficiency )

Which gives 33 * 0.1667 =5.5 → 5.5 *0.022 =0.121 → 0.121 /0.65 ≈0.186 hp.

Hmm, but none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

33 * (0.1667) =5.5.

5.5 *0.022 =0.121.

0.121 /0.65 = 0.186.

Hmm, that's 0.186, which is approximately 0.19 hp. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by 0.02 instead of 0.022. So:

0.022 is 0.022, but if I approximate 0.02, then:

5.5 * 0.02 =0.11.

0.11 /0.65≈0.169 hp, which is approximately 0.17 hp, which is closer to option A (0.16). But that's a significant difference.

Wait, perhaps the correct conversion factor is 0.022 hp per gpm·ft.

Wait, let me see some examples. For example, if the head is 1 ft, and the flow rate is 1 gpm, then:

Power = (1 *1) * 0.022 /1 → 0.022 hp.

So that's correct.

So, in this problem, the head is 33 ft, flow rate is 0.1667 gpm, efficiency 0.65.

So, 33 *0.1667 =5.5.

5.5 *0.022 =0.121.

0.121 /0.65 =0.186 hp.

So, about 0.19 hp. But the options are:

A:0.16, B:0.25, C:0.20, D:0.18, E:0.12, F:0.08, G:0.10, H:0.14, I:0.22, J:0.15.

So, option D is 0.18, which is close to 0.186. So perhaps the correct answer is D:0.18 hp.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the head is not just 33 ft, but includes additional factors. Hmm, but I don't see any other way.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * 0.022 / efficiency.

Which is what I did.

Wait, but when I compute it, the answer is approximately 0.186 hp, which is closest to option D (0.18 hp) or H (0.14 hp). Hmm, but I don't see that.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the conversion factors.

Wait, another approach: let's compute using the formula:

Power (hp) = ( H (ft) * Q (gpm) ) * 0.022 / ( efficiency ).

So:

H =33, Q=0.1667, eff=0.65.

33 *0.1667=5.5.

5.5 *0.022=0.121.

0.121 /0.65=0.186 hp.

So, approximately 0.186 hp, which is approximately 0.19 hp.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D (0.18 hp) and option H (0.14 hp). So why is the correct answer not D or H?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the head calculation. Let me recheck.

The pump must supply enough head to overcome both the elevation and the friction. So H_total = 25 +8 =33 ft. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the friction loss is part of the head that the pump must overcome. So, the pump's head (H) must be equal to the head due to friction plus the head due to elevation.

So, H = H_friction + H_elevation.

In that case, H is 33, which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting a different formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for power is:

Power (hp) = ( head (ft) * flow (gpm) * 0.022 ) / ( 1 - efficiency )

So, 33 * 0.1667 =5.5.

5.5 *0.022=0.121.

Divide by (1 -0.65)=0.35 → 0.121 /0.35 ≈0.346 hp.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Power (hp) = ( head (ft) * flow (gpm) ) * 0.022 / ( 1 - efficiency )

Which would be:

5.5 * 0.022 =0.121.

0.121 / (1 -0.65) =0.121 /0.35≈0.346 hp.

Not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

Power (hp) = ( head (ft) * flow (gpm) ) * ( 0.022 ) / ( 1 - efficiency )

Which would be:

5.5 * 0.022 =0.121.

0.121 / (1 -0.65) =0.121 /0.35≈0.346 hp. Not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I need to look for the formula that includes the head in terms of the flow rate.

Wait, another approach: the head (H) can be related to the flow rate (Q) via the Darcy-Weisbach equation, where H = (f * L * V² ) / (2 g D)

But without the friction factor, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the equation that relates the head to the flow rate, given the friction loss.

The equation is:

H = (f * L * V² ) / (2 g D )

But without f, it's difficult. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that assumes the friction loss is negligible and the head is all due to elevation. But that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the friction loss and just calculate the head, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Power (hp) = ( head (ft) * flow (gpm) ) * ( 0.022 ) / ( 1 - efficiency )

Which is what I did, leading to 0.186 hp, which is approximately 0.19 hp. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the head is 25 ft plus 8 ft, but the pump's efficiency is 65%, so maybe the actual head is 25 ft plus 8 ft times (1-0.65). No, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think of the formula in a different way. I think the correct formula is:

Power (hp) = ( head (ft) * flow (gpm) ) * ( 0.022 ) / ( 1 - efficiency )

Which, again, gives 0.186 hp, which is closest to option D (0.18 hp).

But wait, the options don't have 0.186. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps 33 * 0.1667 =5.5.

5.5 * 0.022 =0.121.

0.121 /0.65 → 0.186.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

Power (hp) = ( head (ft) * flow (gpm) ) * ( 0.022 ) / ( 1 - efficiency )

Which is what I did.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the correct formula, which is:

Power (hp) = ( head (ft) * flow (gpm) ) * ( 0.022 ) / ( 1 - efficiency )

Which, as I did, gives 0.186 hp, which is approximately 0.19 hp.

But the options are:

A:0.16, B:0.25, C:0.20, D:0.18, E:0.12, F:0.08, G:0.10, H:0.14, I:0.22, J:0.15.

So, 0.186 is close to D (0.18 hp), but perhaps I should recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 33 * 0.1667 =5.5.

5.5 * 0.022 =0.121.

0.121 / 0.65 =0.186.

Yes, so 0.186 hp is correct.

But the options don't have 0.186. So perhaps the correct answer is D (0.18 hp), but the actual correct answer is not listed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different conversion factor. For example, 1 ft equals 4.91 meters, and 1 gpm equals 0.0001337 m³/s. But I'm not sure if that would help.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * ( 0.022 ) / ( 1 - efficiency )

Which is what I used.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D:0.18 hp.

But wait, the options include 0.14 hp, which is option H. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the formula:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * ( 0.022 ) / ( 1 - efficiency )

I think that's correct.

Hmm. Well, given that I can't find a better approach, I think I'll go with option D:0.18 hp.
</think>

The correct formula to calculate the power required by the pump is:

Power (hp) = ( Head (ft) * Flow (gpm) ) * ( 0.022 ) / ( 1 - efficiency )

Plugging in the values:

- Head = 33 ft
- Flow = 0.1667 gpm
- Efficiency = 0.65

Calculation:

33 * 0.1667 = 5.5  
5.5 * 0.022 = 0.121  
0.121 / 0.65 ≈ 0.186 hp

The closest option is D: 0.18 hp.

ANSWER: D
