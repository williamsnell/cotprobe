Question:

A state labor code provided that no employer in the state shall knowingly employ an alien who is not lawfully residing in the United States if such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful residents' right to work. A group of immigrant farm workers were continually refused employment contracts by the labor contractors in the state. Instead, the labor contractors had employed many alien workers since they would toil longer hours for less wages. The immigrant farm workers now bring suit in state court pursuant to the above-mentioned statutory provision. Which of the following determinations would most likely result as a consequence of the immigrant farm workers' lawsuit?

Options:

A: The court would declare the statute unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
B: The court would declare the statute unconstitutional as it violates the rights of the alien workers.
C: The court would declare the statute constitutional since it is within the state's power to regulate employment.
D: The court would declare the statute constitutional as within the realm of rights reserved to the states by the Eleventh Amendment.
E: The court would declare the statute unconstitutional as it discriminates against non-residents.
F: The court would declare the statute unconstitutional as it conflicts with federal labor laws.
G: The court would declare the statute constitutional as it does not infringe on the rights of the immigrant workers.
H: The court would declare the statute constitutional as it promotes the welfare of the state's residents.
I: The court would declare the statute constitutional since the states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the state labor code and whether it's constitutional or not. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that a state's labor code prohibits employers from employing an alien who isn't lawfully residing in the U.S. if such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful residents' right to work. So, if a farm worker from there is being denied employment and instead is working for contractors who pay less, longer hours, and that's not desirable for the farm workers, they can sue. The question is, what would the court decide?

The options are A to I, each making a different determination. I need to evaluate the options and see which is correct.

First, the law here is a state-level labor code. The key issue is whether the state's employment regulation is constitutional. I think this relates to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact application.

The constitutional question is whether the state can regulate employment based on the alien's status. I remember that the Fifth Amendment allows states to regulate employment, but it's not unlimited. So, the state can't regulate based on whether the person is a resident or not without due process and protection.

In this case, the state's law says that if an alien is employed and it's not in the farm workers' best interest, then there's no employment contract. But the question is about the constitutionality of that law.

The state's power to regulate employment should be limited, as per the Fourteenth Amendment, to such a degree that it doesn't infringe on the rights of any individual. So, the state can't discriminate against non-residents based on their status, even if it affects other residents.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Court decides the statute is unconstitutional due to Equal Protection. That seems off because the state can't do that without due process. But wait, the state's power is limited, so maybe this isn't the case.

Option B: Court says the statute is unconstitutional because it violates alien workers' rights. That's a problem because the law is about the state's regulation. If it's targeting alien workers, it could infringe on their rights. But the state's power is limited, so maybe it's constitutional.

Option C: Court says it's constitutional because it's within state's power. But there's a doubt about whether the state's power to regulate falls into the realm of protection. The state's power is limited by the Fourteenth Amendment, so the law should be considered within that scope.

Option D: Court decides it's constitutional as a rights reserved by the Thirteenth Amendment. That's confusing because the law is about the state's power to regulate, not about what it's regulating.

Option E: Court says it's unconstitutional due to discrimination against non-residents. But the law doesn't discriminate; it's about adverse effects on lawful residents. So the discrimination argument doesn't hold.

Option F: Court says the statute conflicts with federal labor laws. But the question is within the state's jurisdiction. Unless the state's law is being compared to federal laws, which I don't think is the case.

Option G: Court decides the statute is constitutional as it doesn't infringe on the workers' rights. That seems correct because the state can regulate employment based on the worker's status if it doesn't violate other state laws.

Option H: Court says the state promotes the welfare of residents. I don't see the connection here. Promoting welfare is more about public policy, not state regulation.

Option I: Court says it's constitutional because states aren't preempted. Preemption refers to the state's obligation not to interfere with federal laws. But this state's regulation is about regulating illegal aliens, not about the state's obligation not to regulate. So I'm not sure about this one.

Wait, the state can't regulate based on the alien's status without due process and protection. So, the state's determination is whether the law is constitutional. The state's power is limited, so if it's trying to regulate based on an alien's non-residency, it's probably unconstitutional because it would infringe on their rights.

So option G says the court would declare the statute constitutional as it doesn't infringe on the workers' rights. That should be right.

Another angle: the law applies to the farm workers, who are not residents, but their employment isn't restricted. So the state's regulation doesn't apply to them, but that doesn't make it unconstitutional. The state can't regulate based on the alien's status without due process.

So the correct answer is G.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of a state's labor code that prohibits employers from employing aliens not lawfully residing in the U.S., provided such employment would have adverse effects on lawful residents' rights to work. The state's law applies to alien workers whose employment is not in the farm workers' best interest but does not discriminate against them. The analysis focuses on whether the state's regulation is constitutional.

Key considerations include the Fourteenth Amendment's limitations on state power to regulate employment and the need for due process. The state cannot regulate based on an alien's status without violating their rights. The law does not discriminate against alien workers, so the argument against discrimination is flawed. The state's power is limited, and the regulation is within the scope of its authority.

Option G correctly states that the court would determine the statute constitutional as it does not infringe on the workers' rights. This is because the state's regulation is within its constitutional limits and does not violate their rights.

ANSWER: G
