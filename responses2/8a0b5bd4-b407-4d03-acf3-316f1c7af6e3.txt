Okay, so I've got this limit problem here: the limit as x approaches 0 of csc(x) minus cot(x). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these trigonometric identities, but let's see if I can work through it step by step.

First, I remember that csc(x) is the reciprocal of sin(x), right? And cot(x) is cos(x)/sin(x). So, maybe I can rewrite the expression using these definitions. Let me write that down:

csc(x) - cot(x) = 1/sin(x) - cos(x)/sin(x)

Since both terms have the same denominator, I can combine them over a single fraction. So, adding those together:

= (1 - cos(x)) / sin(x)

Alright, that's a bit simpler. Now, I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of this expression. Let me write that out:

lim(x→0) [ (1 - cos(x)) / sin(x) ]

Hmm, I think I remember that near 0, cos(x) is approximately 1 minus x squared over 2. Let me confirm that. Oh wait, the Taylor series expansion for cos(x) around 0 is 1 - x²/2 + x⁴/24 - ... So, cos(x) ≈ 1 - x²/2 when x is near 0. Similarly, sin(x) is approximately x - x³/6 + ... So, sin(x) ≈ x when x is near 0.

But wait, maybe I can use some trigonometric identities to simplify (1 - cos(x))/sin(x). Let me think. I recall that 1 - cos(x) can be rewritten using a double-angle identity. Let me recall: 1 - cos(x) = 2 sin²(x/2). That seems right because the identity for cos(2θ) is 1 - 2 sin²θ, so if I let θ = x/2, then 1 - cos(x) = 2 sin²(x/2).

So substituting that into the numerator:

(1 - cos(x)) = 2 sin²(x/2)

So the expression becomes:

[2 sin²(x/2)] / sin(x)

Now, the denominator is sin(x). Let me see if I can express sin(x) in terms of sin(x/2). Oh, right! The double-angle identity for sine is sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. So, sin(x) = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2).

Substituting that into the denominator:

= 2 sin²(x/2) / [2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)]

The 2's cancel out, and one sin(x/2) cancels in numerator and denominator:

= sin(x/2) / cos(x/2)

Which is equal to tan(x/2).

So now, the limit simplifies to:

lim(x→0) tan(x/2)

When x approaches 0, x/2 approaches 0, and tan(0) is 0. So the limit is 0.

Wait, but I should double-check if I did all the steps correctly. Let me recap.

Starting with csc(x) - cot(x):

= 1/sin(x) - cos(x)/sin(x)
= (1 - cos(x))/sin(x)

Then, using 1 - cos(x) = 2 sin²(x/2):

= [2 sin²(x/2)] / sin(x)

And sin(x) = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2):

= [2 sin²(x/2)] / [2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)] 
= [ sin(x/2) ] / [ cos(x/2) ] 
= tan(x/2)

As x approaches 0, tan(x/2) approaches 0.

So the limit is 0. That would correspond to option E.

Wait, but another approach: using the small-angle approximations. Let's see:

As x approaches 0, sin(x) ≈ x and cos(x) ≈ 1 - x²/2.

So 1 - cos(x) ≈ x²/2.

So (1 - cos(x))/sin(x) ≈ (x²/2)/x = x/2, which approaches 0 as x approaches 0. So that also leads to the same conclusion.

Alternatively, another method: Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cos(x)). Let's try that.

Starting with (1 - cos(x))/sin(x). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cos(x)):

= [ (1 - cos(x))(1 + cos(x)) ] / [ sin(x)(1 + cos(x)) ]

The numerator becomes 1 - cos²(x) = sin²(x). So:

= sin²(x) / [ sin(x)(1 + cos(x)) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= sin(x) / [ 1 + cos(x) ]

Because sin²(x)/sin(x) is sin(x), and the denominator remains (1 + cos(x)).

So now, the expression is sin(x)/(1 + cos(x)).

As x approaches 0, sin(x) approaches 0 and 1 + cos(x) approaches 2. So the limit is 0/2 = 0.

Another way leads to the same result. So I'm pretty confident that the limit is 0, which is option E.

The limit simplifies using trigonometric identities to tan(x/2), which approaches 0 as x approaches 0. Thus, the limit is 0.
