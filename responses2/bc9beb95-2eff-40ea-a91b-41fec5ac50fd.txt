Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about thermal expansion. Let me see what the question says. So, there's a glass bulb that's weighed in water at two different temperatures, T and T1. The weights of the displaced water are W and W1, respectively. I need to find the volumetric expansion coefficient β_W of the water in the temperature interval from T to T1.

Hmm, wait, but wait. Wait a second. Wait, the glass bulb's expansion? Or is the water expanding? Wait, the question says the water's expansion coefficient. Hmm, but wait, the glass bulb itself is a material, so its expansion would affect the measurement. But the question is about the water's coefficient. Wait, that's confusing. Because if the water is expanding, then it would displace more water, but wait, the glass bulb is weighed in water, but I think the setup is that the glass bulb is floating or submerged, and when it's weighed at two temperatures, the displaced water's weight changes.

Wait, maybe I should think about the buoyancy. The buoyant force is related to the displaced water. The weight of the displaced water would be the mass times gravity. So at temperature T, the mass of water displaced is W divided by the density of water at T. Similarly, at T1, it's W1 divided by density at T1.

But wait, the glass bulb itself is made of glass. If the glass is expanding with temperature, that would affect the displacement. Because the glass would expand, taking up more or less space. So the actual volume of the glass changes with temperature, which affects how much water it displaces.

Wait, so when the glass is weighed in water at T, the weight of the bulb plus its own displacement is what's measured? Or is it that the weight of the displaced water is just W? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the setup is that you have a glass bulb, which is weighed in water at two temperatures, T and T1. So, the weight of the bulb plus its volume at temperature T times the density of water at T would give the mass of the water displaced. But wait, no. Wait, buoyancy is about how much the object displaces water. So if the glass is at temperature T, its volume would be V(T), and when placed in water at T, the displacement is V(T) times the density of water at T.

Wait, but if the glass expands with temperature, then V(T) would be higher than V(T1). So when the temperature changes, the volume change affects the displacement.

So the displacement of water is equal to the volume of the glass at the temperature T, but that volume is the glass's volume at T. But when the glass is placed in water at T, the water displaced is V(T) * rho_water(T), where rho_water(T) is the density of water at T. Wait, but when the temperature changes, the density of water changes as well, right? Because water expands with temperature.

So the displaced water's weight would be rho_water(T) * V(T) * g. But wait, the weight of the displaced water is the buoyant force, which is equal to the weight of the water displaced. So that's equal to the mass of water displaced times g.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the weights of the displaced water are W and W1, at temperatures T and T1. So W is the weight at T, and W1 at T1. So, the mass of displaced water at T is W/(g), and at T1 is W1/(g).

So, the mass displaced at T is m1 = W/(g), and at T1, m2 = W1/(g).

But the mass of the displaced water depends on the volume of the object. Wait, but the object's volume at each temperature. So, the glass bulb's volume changes with temperature. So, the volume of the glass at T is V_B(T), and at T1 is V_B(T1). But since the glass is the same material, the expansion would be according to the coefficient beta.

Wait, the volumetric expansion coefficient beta_B is given. So, the volume at T is V_B(T) = V0 (1 + beta_B (T - T0)), assuming T0 is a reference temperature. Similarly, V_B(T1) = V0 (1 + beta_B (T1 - T0)).

But when the glass is submerged in water, the volume it occupies would change with temperature. So, the mass of water displaced depends on V_B(T) multiplied by the density of water at T. Similarly, at T1, it's V_B(T1) multiplied by the density of water at T1.

So, the mass of water displaced at T is m1 = V_B(T) * rho_water(T) * g. But wait, no—because the displaced mass is just the weight of the water it's displacing. So m1 = (V_B(T) * rho_water(T)) * g.

Similarly, m2 = (V_B(T1) * rho_water(T1)) * g.

But the weights are W and W1, so m1 = W/g, m2 = W1/g.

So:

m1 = [V_B(T)] * [rho_water(T)] * g = W/(g)

m2 = [V_B(T1)] * [rho_water(T1)] * g = W1/(g)

Wait, but solving for V_B(T) and V_B(T1):

V_B(T) = (W/(g^2)) * rho_water(T)

Similarly, V_B(T1) = (W1/(g^2)) * rho_water(T1)

Wait, but since the glass is the same material, its volume at T and T1 should be related by the expansion coefficient. So, V_B(T1) = V_B(T) * [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)].

Because, the expansion is given by V = V0 (1 + beta (T - T0)), but if T0 is the initial temperature, perhaps T is the current temperature. Hmm, but the problem statement doesn't specify the reference temperature, so perhaps I should assume that the change is from T to T1, and the expansion is beta_B per degree.

Alternatively, perhaps the expansion coefficient beta_B is the change per degree Celsius. So, the change in volume is V_B(T1) = V_B(T) (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)).

So, V_B(T) = V_B(T1) / [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)].

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the relationship between the two mass measurements. I have W and W1, which are the weights of the displaced water at T and T1, respectively.

So, m1 = W/(g), m2 = W1/(g).

But m1 = V_b(T) * rho_water(T) * g = W/(g)

Rearranged: V_b(T) = (W/(g^2)) * rho_water(T)

Similarly, V_b(T1) = (W1/(g^2)) * rho_water(T1)

But the glass's volume expansion: V_b(T1) = V_b(T) * [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)].

So substituting,

V_b(T) * [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)] = (W1/(g^2)) * rho_water(T1)

But from m1, V_b(T) is (W/(g^2)) * rho_water(T).

So,

(W/(g^2)) * rho_water(T) * [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)] = (W1/(g^2)) * rho_water(T1)

We can multiply both sides by g^2 to cancel out:

W rho_water(T) [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)] = W1 rho_water(T1)

We can rearrange this equation:

W rho_water(T) [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)] = W1 rho_water(T1)

We can solve for W1 in terms of W and other quantities.

Wait, but the question is about the expansion coefficient of water, beta_W. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The question says, "the last character of your response must be the letter you've chosen." So, perhaps I need to find beta_W, which is the volumetric expansion coefficient of water, based on the given data.

Wait, but wait. The glass is expanding, so when you weigh it at T and T1, the displaced water's weight changes. But the question is about the water's expansion. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. No, the question is about the water's expansion coefficient, so it's possible that the glass is floating, and when it's submerged in water at T and T1, the mass of displaced water reflects the change in volume of water. But perhaps the problem is more about the relationship between the two measurements.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

We have W and W1. The displaced water's mass is W/(g) and W1/(g) respectively.

So, the mass of displaced water is proportional to the density of water at the temperature. So, the mass m = rho_water(T) * V_displaced(T) * g.

Wait, but the displaced volume is the same as the volume of the glass at each temperature. Because when you place an object in water, the volume displaced is equal to the volume of the object.

Wait, but the glass's volume depends on the temperature. So, the volume of the glass at T is V_b(T) = V_b0 (1 + beta_B (T - T0)), where V_b0 is the volume at T0. If T0 is the reference temperature, perhaps 0°C or something. But the problem doesn't specify, but perhaps it's a general case.

But the glass's volume at T and T1 is V_b(T) and V_b(T1). So, the mass of displaced water would be m1 = rho_water(T) * V_b(T) * g, and m2 = rho_water(T1) * V_b(T1) * g.

But from the problem, m1 = W/(g), and m2 = W1/(g).

So, m1 = rho_water(T) * V_b(T) * g = W/g → m1 = W/(g^2) * rho_water(T).

Similarly, m2 = W1/(g^2) * rho_water(T1).

But the glass's volume changes with temperature. So, V_b(T1) = V_b(T) [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)].

So,

V_b(T) = (W/(g^2) rho_water(T)).

V_b(T1) = (W1/(g^2) rho_water(T1)).

But also, V_b(T1) = V_b(T) [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)].

So,

[W/(g^2) rho_water(T)] [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)] = [W1/(g^2) rho_water(T1)].

We can cancel g^2 from both sides,

W rho_water(T) [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)] = W1 rho_water(T1).

Now, the question is to find beta_W, the volumetric expansion coefficient of water in the temperature interval from T to T1.

Wait, but the water's expansion coefficient is probably the same as its own, which is roughly 207e-6 per °C. But perhaps the question is using a different approach. Let me think about the relation between the two measurements.

So, from the equation:

W rho_water(T) [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)] = W1 rho_water(T1).

I can rearrange this to express W1 in terms of W:

W1 = [W rho_water(T) / rho_water(T1)] [1 + beta_B (T1 - T) ].

But the question is about finding the expansion coefficient of water, beta_W. Hmm, perhaps the equation can be manipulated to express beta_W in terms of the given variables.

Wait, the problem asks for beta_W, which is the expansion coefficient of the water itself. But in the equation, we have rho_water(T) and rho_water(T1), which are the densities at different temperatures. So, perhaps we can write the ratio of densities as a function of temperature.

The volumetric expansion coefficient beta is (1/ρ) (dρ/dT). But in this case, the problem gives beta_B, the thermal expansion coefficient of the glass. But I'm not sure how beta_B relates to beta_W.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the two measurements W and W1, and how they relate to the density of water.

Wait, but the equation I have is:

W1 = [W rho_water(T) / rho_water(T1)] [1 + beta_B (T1 - T) ].

But I need to relate this to the expansion coefficient of water, which is beta_W. Hmm, but the equation involves rho_water at different temperatures, which is different from beta_W.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the change in the displaced mass is due to the expansion of the glass. So, the mass of displaced water reflects the change in volume of the glass. So, the volume expansion of the glass affects the mass, which in turn affects the measured weight.

Wait, but that's perhaps a different way to think about it. Let me consider the displacement: the mass of displaced water is m = rho_water(T) * V_displaced(T) * g.

But V_displaced(T) is equal to V_b(T), the volume of the glass at temperature T. Similarly, V_displaced(T1) = V_b(T1).

So, the mass displaced at T is m1 = rho_water(T) * V_b(T) * g = W/(g^2) rho_water(T).

Similarly, m2 = rho_water(T1) * V_b(T1) * g = W1/(g^2) rho_water(T1).

But the glass's volume at T1 is V_b(T1) = V_b(T) (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)).

So, substituting, we get:

m2 = rho_water(T1) * V_b(T) [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)] * g = W1/(g^2) rho_water(T1).

Wait, but m1 is rho_water(T) * V_b(T) * g = W/(g^2) rho_water(T).

Then, from m1, V_b(T) = W/(g^3 rho_water(T)).

Substituting into m2:

m2 = rho_water(T1) * [W/(g^3 rho_water(T))] * [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)] * g = W1/(g^2) rho_water(T1).

Simplify:

m2 = [W rho_water(T1) / (g^2 rho_water(T))] * [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)].

But m2 is given as W1/(g^2) rho_water(T1). So,

[W rho_water(T1) / (g^2 rho_water(T))] * [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)] = W1/(g^2) rho_water(T1).

Multiply both sides by g^2 rho_water(T) to eliminate denominators:

W rho_water(T1) [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)] = W1 rho_water(T).

Now, let me rearrange this equation to solve for [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)]:

[1 + beta_B (T1 - T)] = [W1 / W] [ rho_water(T) / rho_water(T1) ].

Hmm, so that's where the W1/W comes in. Now, the question is finding the expansion coefficient of the water, beta_W.

Wait, perhaps the equation I have can lead me to the beta_W.

The expansion coefficient beta_W is (1/ rho_water) (d rho_water/d T). But in this problem, perhaps the relation between the two measurements can help express beta_W in terms of the other variables.

Alternatively, perhaps the expansion coefficient of the glass (beta_B) is related to the expansion of the water, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for an expression that relates W and W1 to the expansion coefficients.

Let me try to express all the terms in terms of the given variables.

We have:

[W / W1] = [rho_water(T) / rho_water(T1)] * [1 + beta_B (T1 - T)].

Wait, no, from earlier equation:

[1 + beta_B (T1 - T)] = (W1 / W) [ rho_water(T) / rho_water(T1) ].

Wait, let me write that again:

1 + beta_B (T1 - T) = (W1 / W) [ rho_water(T) / rho_water(T1) ].

So, now, the question is to find beta_W, which is the expansion coefficient of water. But in the problem statement, the question is about the water's expansion coefficient, which is a given value, but the problem gives us the equation and we have to find beta_W in terms of the given variables.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The problem says, find beta_W of the water in the temperature interval from T to T1. So, beta_W is the coefficient of expansion of water, which is (1/ rho_water) (d rho_water / d T). But in the problem, we're given a way to relate W and W1, which are the measured displacements, to the densities of water at different temperatures. So, the equation I derived is:

1 + beta_B (T1 - T) = (W1 / W) [ rho_water(T) / rho_water(T1) ].

Wait, but the question is to find beta_W. Hmm. Perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, the question gives us the relationship between W and W1, and we need to find the expansion coefficient of the water, beta_W, based on that. So, perhaps the equation I have can be rearranged to express beta_W.

Wait, let me think again. The volumetric expansion coefficient of water, beta_W, is (1/ rho_water) (d rho_water/d T). But if we're looking at the displacement, which is related to the expansion of the glass, perhaps the equation can be connected to beta_W.

Wait, another approach: the measured weight is the mass of the displaced water, which depends on the density of water at the temperature. So, W is proportional to rho_water(T) * V_b(T) * g.

But V_b(T) is the glass's volume at temperature T, which is V_b0 (1 + beta_B (T - T0)).

But wait, V_b0 is the glass's volume at the reference temperature (probably 0°C). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I should proceed with the given equation.

Wait, from earlier, the equation I have is:

1 + beta_B (T1 - T) = (W1/W) ( rho_water(T)/rho_water(T1) )

So, solving for beta_B:

beta_B = [ (W1/W) ( rho_water(T)/rho_water(T1) ) - 1 ] / (T1 - T)

But the question is about beta_W, the water's expansion coefficient. Hmm, perhaps the only way to relate this is through the densities.

Wait, another approach: the expansion of the water can be expressed in terms of the displacement. Let me think about the mass of the glass.

Wait, no, perhaps I should use the equation I have and find an expression that gives me beta_W.

Wait, perhaps the equation I have can be manipulated to express (rho_water(T) - rho_water(T1)) in terms of beta_B and the other variables.

Wait, but the problem is asking for beta_W, which is (1/ rho_water) (d rho_water/d T). So, perhaps I can find beta_W by considering the change in density of water with temperature, but I'm not sure how that relates to the measured displacements.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of it differently. The glass's expansion affects the volume, which in turn affects the mass of displaced water. So, the measured mass W is influenced by both the expansion of the glass and the expansion of the water.

Wait, but perhaps the equation I have is the key to finding beta_W. Let me go back to the equation I derived:

1 + beta_B (T1 - T) = (W1/W) [ rho_water(T) / rho_water(T1) ]

Let me express the left-hand side as 1 + beta_B (T1 - T) = 1 + beta_B ΔT, where ΔT = T1 - T.

And the right-hand side is (W1/W) [ rho_water(T) / rho_water(T1) ].

Wait, so I have:

1 + beta_B (ΔT) = (W1/W) [ rho_water(T) / rho_water(T1) ]

Rearranging for ( rho_water(T) / rho_water(T1) ):

rho_water(T)/rho_water(T1) = [ 1 + beta_B (ΔT) ] * [ W/(W1) ]

So, the ratio of the densities is [ (1 + beta_B ΔT) * (W/W1) ].

Now, the question is to find beta_W, the expansion coefficient of the water. But the problem statement doesn't give any options to choose from, except for the options given in the user's message.

Wait, the options are:

A) (W1 - W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)) / (W1 + W) ]

B) (W1 - W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)) / (W1 + W) ]

Wait, no, the user wrote:

Options:

A) (W1 - W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)) / (W1 + W) ]

B) (W1 - W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)) / (W1 + W) ]

Wait, no, the options are:

A) (W1 - W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)) / (W1 + W) ]

B) (W1 - W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)) / (W1 + W) ]

Hmm, no, perhaps the options are:

A) (W1 - W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)) / (W1 + W) ]

B) (W1 - W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)) / (W1 + W) ]

Wait, no, perhaps the user made a typo in the options. But regardless, I'm supposed to find beta_W based on the equation I have.

Wait, from the equation:

rho_water(T)/rho_water(T1) = [ (1 + beta_B (ΔT)) * (W/W1) ]

So, taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(rho_water(T)/rho_water(T1)) = ln( (1 + beta_B (ΔT)) (W/W1) )

= ln(1 + beta_B (ΔT)) + ln(W/W1)

But beta_W is (1/rho_water) (d rho_water/d T). So, the expansion coefficient of water is beta_W = (1/ rho_water(T)) ) (d rho_water/d T) from water's perspective.

Wait, perhaps I can express (d rho_water/d T) in terms of the densities at different temperatures.

Wait, but from the equation:

rho_water(T) = rho_water(T1) * (1 + beta_B (ΔT)) * (W/W1 )

So,

rho_water(T) = rho_water(T1) * (1 + beta_B (ΔT)) * (W/W1 )

But solving for rho_water(T) / rho_water(T1):

rho_water(T) / rho_water(T1) = (1 + beta_B (ΔT)) * (W/W1 )

So, taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(rho_water(T)/rho_water(T1)) = ln( (1 + beta_B (ΔT)) (W/W1) )

= ln(1 + beta_B (ΔT)) + ln(W/W1 )

Now, I can approximate ln(1 + x) ≈ x for small x. So, if beta_B (ΔT) is small, then:

ln(rho_water(T)/rho_water(T1)) ≈ beta_B (ΔT) + ln(W/W1 )

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the equation in terms of the expansion coefficients.

Wait, another approach: since the glass's expansion is given by beta_B, perhaps the displacement of water is related to the expansion of the glass. So, the measured mass of displaced water is affected by the glass's expansion.

So, the equation I have is:

1 + beta_B (ΔT) = (W1 / W) [ rho_water(T)/rho_water(T1) ]

Wait, but I'm not sure how this connects to beta_W. Maybe I should express the equation in terms of the expansion coefficient of water.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the expansion of the water. Let's think about the change in density of water with temperature. The expansion coefficient beta_W is positive, as I mentioned before.

So, the density of water at temperature T1 is rho_water(T1) = rho_water(T) [1 + beta_W (ΔT) ].

Wait, but if that's the case, then substituting into the equation:

rho_water(T)/rho_water(T1) = 1 / [1 + beta_W (ΔT)].

So, plugging that into the equation I have:

1 + beta_B (ΔT) = (W1 / W) [ 1 / (1 + beta_W (ΔT)) ) ]

So,

1 + beta_B (ΔT) = (W1)/(W) [ 1 / (1 + beta_W (ΔT)) ) ]

Then,

(W1)/W [ 1/(1 + beta_W (ΔT)) ] = 1 + beta_B (ΔT )

Multiply both sides by (1 + beta_W (ΔT)):

(W1)/W = [1 + beta_B (ΔT)] [1 + beta_W (ΔT) ]

Expanding the right-hand side:

(W1)/W = 1 + beta_B (ΔT) + beta_W (ΔT) + beta_B beta_W (ΔT)^2.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. I'm not sure if this is the right path.

Wait, perhaps the equation I have can be manipulated to express beta_W in terms of beta_B and the other variables.

Let me go back to the equation:

1 + beta_B (ΔT) = (W1/W) [ rho_water(T)/rho_water(T1) ]

But if I can write rho_water(T) in terms of rho_water(T1) and beta_W, perhaps I can substitute.

Wait, but rho_water(T) = rho_water(T1) [1 + beta_W (ΔT) ].

So,

rho_water(T)/rho_water(T1) = 1 + beta_W (ΔT).

Substituting into the equation:

1 + beta_B (ΔT) = (W1/W) [1 + beta_W (ΔT) ]

Now, let me solve for beta_W.

1 + beta_B (ΔT) = (W1/W) (1 + beta_W (ΔT) )

Multiply both sides by W:

W (1 + beta_B (ΔT) ) = W1 (1 + beta_W (ΔT) )

Expand both sides:

W + W beta_B (ΔT) = W1 + W1 beta_W (ΔT)

Now, bring all terms to one side:

W + W beta_B (ΔT) - W1 - W1 beta_W (ΔT) = 0

Factor:

(W - W1) + beta_B (ΔT) (W) - beta_W (ΔT) (W1) = 0

Factor out (ΔT):

(W - W1) + (ΔT) [ beta_B W - beta_W W1 ] = 0

Now, solve for beta_W:

beta_W W1 = beta_B W (ΔT) + (W1 - W) + (W - W1)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to collect terms with beta_W.

Wait, let's rearrange the previous equation:

(W - W1) + beta_B (ΔT) W - beta_W (ΔT) W1 = 0.

We can rearrange this as:

beta_W (ΔT) W1 = (W - W1) + beta_B (ΔT) W.

Divide both sides by (ΔT) W1:

beta_W = [ (W - W1) + beta_B (ΔT) W ] / (ΔT W1 )

Hmm, but this seems messy. Maybe I made an error in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the equation I have is:

1 + beta_B (ΔT) = (W1/W) [1 + beta_W (ΔT) ]

Wait, perhaps I should express [1 + beta_W (ΔT) ] in terms of [1 + beta_B (ΔT) ] and the other variables.

Wait, let me take the equation:

1 + beta_B (ΔT) = (W1/W) [1 + beta_W (ΔT) ]

Multiply both sides by W:

W (1 + beta_B (ΔT) ) = W1 (1 + beta_W (ΔT) )

Expand both sides:

W + W beta_B (ΔT) = W1 + W1 beta_W (ΔT)

Bring all terms to left side:

W + W beta_B (ΔT) - W1 - W1 beta_W (ΔT) = 0.

Factor:

(W - W1) + (W beta_B (ΔT) - W1 beta_W (ΔT)) = 0.

Factor (ΔT):

(W - W1) + (ΔT)(W beta_B - W1 beta_W) = 0.

Now, solve for beta_W.

(W - W1) + (ΔT)(W beta_B - W1 beta_W) = 0

Rearranged:

(W - W1) = - (ΔT)(W beta_B - W1 beta_W )

Multiply both sides by -1:

(W1 - W) = (ΔT)(W beta_B - W1 beta_W )

Now, divide both sides by (ΔT):

(W1 - W) / (ΔT) = W beta_B - W1 beta_W.

Now, solve for beta_W:

W1 beta_W = W beta_B - ( (W1 - W) / (ΔT) ) W.

Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to rearrange the equation to solve for beta_W.

From:

(W1 - W) = (ΔT)(W beta_B - W1 beta_W )

Let me factor beta_W:

(W1 - W) = (ΔT)( W beta_B - W1 beta_W )

= (ΔT)( beta_W ( - W1 ) + W beta_B )

= (ΔT)( beta_W ( - W1 ) + W beta_B )

Bring all terms to one side:

(W1 - W) + (ΔT)( beta_W W1 - W beta_B ) = 0.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe I should try to find an expression that matches one of the given options.

Looking back, the options are:

A) (W1 - W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)) / (W1 + W) ]

B) (W1 - W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)) / (W1 + W) ]

Wait, but in the options, both A and B are the same, which suggests a typo. But regardless, I'm supposed to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps I can find the correct option by comparing the equation I have with the options.

From earlier steps, I have:

beta_W = [ (W1 - W) ] / (W beta_B (T1 - T) - W1 (T1 - T) ) * (T1 - T) ... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation I have can be rearranged to give option A or B.

Wait, let me think again. The correct equation I have is:

1 + beta_B (T1 - T) = (W1 / W) [ rho_water(T) / rho_water(T1) ]

Wait, but rho_water(T)/rho_water(T1) = [1 + beta_W (T1 - T)].

So,

1 + beta_B (T1 - T) = (W1 / W) [1 + beta_W (T1 - T) ]

Multiply both sides by W:

W [1 + beta_B (T1 - T) ] = W1 [1 + beta_W (T1 - T) ]

Expand both sides:

W + W beta_B (T1 - T) = W1 + W1 beta_W (T1 - T)

Bring all terms to left side:

W + W beta_B (T1 - T) - W1 - W1 beta_W (T1 - T) = 0

Factor:

(W - W1) + (T1 - T) ( W beta_B - W1 beta_W ) = 0

Now, solving for beta_W:

(W - W1) + (T1 - T) ( W beta_B - W1 beta_W ) = 0

=> (T1 - T) ( W beta_B - W1 beta_W ) = (W1 - W )

Divide both sides by (T1 - T):

W beta_B - W1 beta_W = (W1 - W ) / (T1 - T )

Rearranging:

W beta_B - (W1 - W ) / (T1 - T ) = W1 beta_W

So,

beta_W = [ W beta_B - (W1 - W ) / (T1 - T ) ] / W1

Hmm, that's a bit involved, but perhaps this is the correct expression.

Now, looking at the options, option A and B are:

Option A) (W1 - W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)) / (W1 + W) ]

Option B) (W1 - W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)) / (W1 + W) ]

Wait, but this is the same as [ (W1 - W) / (W1 + W) ] multiplied by (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)), which is what I have.

Wait, but in my derived equation, I have:

beta_W = [ W beta_B - (W1 - W ) / (T1 - T ) ] / W1

Hmm, but this doesn't directly match any of the options given. So, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me re-express the equation I have.

Starting from:

1 + beta_B (ΔT) = (W1/W) [1 + beta_W (ΔT) ]

Multiply both sides by W:

W (1 + beta_B ΔT) = W1 (1 + beta_W ΔT )

Expand both sides:

W + W beta_B ΔT = W1 + W1 beta_W ΔT

Bring all terms to the left:

W + W beta_B ΔT - W1 - W1 beta_W ΔT = 0

Factor:

(W - W1) + (ΔT)( W beta_B - W1 beta_W ) = 0

Now, solving for beta_W:

(W - W1) = - (ΔT)( W beta_B - W1 beta_W )

Multiply both sides by -1:

W1 - W = (ΔT)( W beta_B - W1 beta_W )

Now, divide both sides by (ΔT):

(W1 - W)/(ΔT) = W beta_B - W1 beta_W

Rearranged:

W beta_B - W1 beta_W = (W1 - W)/(ΔT)

So,

W1 beta_W = W beta_B - (W1 - W)/(ΔT)

So,

beta_W = [ W beta_B - (W1 - W)/(ΔT) ] / W1

Hmm, but I don't see this in the options provided. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the equation I have can be rewritten in terms of the expansion coefficient of water.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the problem differently. Maybe the correct approach is to express the equation in terms of the expansion coefficient of water.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. So, perhaps I should try to match the equation I have with the options given.

Looking again, the options are:

Option A) (W1-W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1-T)) / (W1 + W) ]

Option B) (W1-W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1-T)) / (W1 + W) ]

Wait, but this is the same as Option A and B being the same, which is incorrect. So, perhaps the user made a typo in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A or B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with another approach and see if I can get to the options.

Wait, I think I need to find the correct equation, and perhaps it's not among the options given. But since the options are provided, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation.

Wait, let me think again. Perhaps the equation I have can be rewritten as:

beta_W = [ (W1 - W) ] / [ W beta_B (T1 - T) - W1 (T1 - T) ) ]

But this doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the equation in terms of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is option B, which is:

(W1 - W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1-T)) / (W1 + W) ]

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the equation differently.

Wait, another approach: Let's denote x = W1 - W and y = W1 + W.

Then,

x = (W1 - W)

y = (W1 + W)

So, the equation I have:

(W1 - W) = (ΔT)( W beta_B - W1 beta_W )

So,

x = (ΔT)( W beta_B - W1 beta_W )

But W1 = (W1 + W) - W = y - W

Similarly, W = (W1 + W) - W1 = y - W1.

Wait, perhaps this is not the right path.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I'll have to proceed to the conclusion that the correct option is option A or B, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: (W1 - W) * [ (1 + beta_B (T1 - T)) / (W1 + W) ]

But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it in terms of the expansion of water.

Wait, perhaps the expansion coefficient of water is related to the equation I have.

But I'm not making progress, so I'll have to give up.

To solve the problem, we start with the given equation:

1 + β_B (ΔT) = (W1 / W) [1 + β_W (ΔT)]

where ΔT = T1 - T.

Rearranging and solving for β_W, we find that the correct expression does not match the provided options. However, based on the structure of the problem, the closest option is:

β_W = (W1 - W) * [ (1 + β_B (ΔT)) / (W1 + W) ]

Thus, the answer is:

ANSWER: B
