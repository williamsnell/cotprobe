Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about a concentration cell. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the problem says the measured voltage is 0.0650 V at 25°C. The setup is Ag|AgNO3 (0.0100 m) || AgNO3 (y) | Ag. We have to find the molality (y) of the right-hand half-cell. The options are given, and gamma_± is 1, which I think just means we don't have to worry about activity coefficients. 

Wait, concentration cells often involve two solutions of the same metal ion. But here, the right-hand half-cell is AgNO3 (y), and the left is 0.0100 m. Oh, wait, but wait, the left has Ag with 0.0100 m, and the right is AgNO3 (y) m.

Wait, in a concentration cell, the two electrodes are the same metal, but different concentrations of their ions. So, for this cell, Ag is on both sides. The left is 0.0100 m AgNO3, and the right is AgNO3 (y) m, so the right cell's concentration is y m.

I remember that in a concentration cell, the cell potential is given by the Nernst equation, but because it's a cell potential, the formula is V = (RT/nF) * ln(Q), but wait, wait, the exact form varies based on the setup.

Wait, more accurately, the cell potential is calculated as E = E° - (RT/(nF)) ln(Q). But for concentration cells, I think E° is zero because it's a galvanic cell where the two electrodes are the same metal, so there's no tendency for a spontaneous reaction. So E = (RT/(nF)) * ln(Q), but wait, no—it depends on which way the cell is set up.

Wait, another approach: in a concentration cell, the cell potential depends on the ratio of the concentrations of the ions. Since the cell is designed to have a spontaneous reaction, the higher concentration side will have a higher potential. The Nernst equation for a concentration cell is E = ( (0.05916 V) / n ) * log ( [C_right] / [C_left] ), right? But wait, I'm a little confused because sometimes it's written with exact numbers.

Wait, wait. Let me get the exact formula. The Nernst equation for a concentration cell is E = ( (0.05916 V) / n ) * log ( [Ag+]_right / [Ag+]_left )

But wait, in this case, both electrodes are Ag, so the activity of Ag is 1, so the Nernst equation would apply. But this is a concentration cell, so the cell reaction is driven by the difference in concentrations of the metal ions. So the cell potential is E = ( (0.05916 V) / 1 ) * log ( [Ag+]_right / [Ag+]_left )

Wait, but the problem states that the concentrations are AgNO3 on both sides. So for the left side, the concentration is 0.0100 m AgNO3, which I think means the [Ag+] is 0.0100 M. The right side's [Ag+] is y m, but wait, wait, the problem states AgNO3 (y) is the right-hand side, so y is the molarity of AgNO3 solution, so [Ag+] would be y M, yes.

Wait, but wait, in a concentration cell, the right cell's concentration would be compared to the left. So in the Nernst equation, the cell potential is E = (0.05916/n) * log ( [Ag+]_right / [Ag+]_left )

But n is the number of electrons transferred. For Ag → Ag+, each Ag atom loses electrons. So n=1.

So substituting the values, E = (0.05916) * log(y / 0.0100)

We are given E = 0.0650 V.

So:

0.0650 = 0.05916 * log(y / 0.0100)

Let me solve for y.

Divide both sides by 0.05916:

0.0650 / 0.05916 ≈ 1.1003

So log(y/0.0100) = 1.1003

Taking 10^1.1003 = y / 0.0100

10^1 is 10, 10^0.1003 is approximately 1.258 (since log(1.258)=0.1003). So 10 * 1.258 = 12.58.

So y/0.0100 = 12.58 → y = 0.0100 * 12.58 = 0.1258 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.1255 m. Close enough, considering possible rounding. So the answer should be B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the concentration cell setup: 

- The left side is Ag|AgNO₃ (0.0100 m) || AgNO₃ (y) | Ag.
- The right side has AgNO₃ (y) with molarity y, and the left side has AgNO₃ (0.0100 m).
- The cell potential is given as \( E = 0.0650 \, \text{V} \) at 25°C.
- The number of electrons transferred, \( n \), is 1 because Ag → Ag⁺ involves a 1:1 electron transfer.
- The Nernst equation for a concentration cell is:

\[
E = \frac{0.05916}{n} \log \left( \frac{[\text{Ag}^+]_{\text{right}}}{[\text{Ag}^+]_{\text{left}}} \right)
\]

Since \( n = 1 \), the equation simplifies to:

\[
E = 0.05916 \log \left( \frac{y}{0.0100} \right)
\]

Substituting \( E = 0.0650 \, \text{V} \):

\[
0.0650 = 0.05916 \log \left( \frac{y}{0.0100} \right)
\]

Divide both sides by 0.05916:

\[
\frac{0.0650}{0.05916} \approx 1.1003
\]

Thus:

\[
\log \left( \frac{y}{0.0100} \right) = 1.1003
\]

Taking the antilog:

\[
\frac{y}{0.0100} = 10^{1.1003} \approx 12.58
\]

Solving for \( y \):

\[
y = 0.0100 \times 12.58 = 0.1258 \, \text{m}
\]

Comparing this result to the given options, the closest match is **0.1255 m**, which corresponds to option B.
