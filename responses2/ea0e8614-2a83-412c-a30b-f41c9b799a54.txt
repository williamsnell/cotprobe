Question:

Two alternatives for interconnecting a set of processors with bidirectional links are (1) the fully interconnected network, in which each processor is directly connected to every other processor, and (2) the ring network, in which each processor is connected to two other processors. The worst-case path length for a network is the maximum, over all pairs of nodes in the network, of the minimum length paths (measured in number of links) between the nodes. For each type of interconnection of n processors, a figure of merit can be formed as the product of the number of links required for the network times the worst-case path length connecting any two processors. The ratio of this figure of merit for the fully interconnected network compared to that of the ring network, for even n > 2, is

Okay, so I've got this question about interconnect networks for processors. Hmm, the question is about comparing two types of networks: a fully interconnected one and a ring network. The worst-case path length is what's considered here, and then we calculate a figure of merit for each. The figure of merit is the number of links times the worst-case path length for each network. Then, we have to find the ratio of the fully interconnected network's figure of merit to the ring network's.

Alright, let's break this down. First, let me understand the setup. There are n processors. For each network type, we need to find the number of links and the worst-case path length between any two nodes, then multiply them to get the figure of merit.

Starting with the fully interconnected network. In this case, each processor is connected to every other processor. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when it's fully connected, each processor is connected to every other. So each processor has n-1 links. But wait, in a fully interconnected network, for n nodes, each node has degree n-1. The total number of links is n*(n-1)/2, because each link is shared by two nodes. So the total links are L1 = n(n-1)/2.

Now, the worst-case path length. Since it's fully connected, any two nodes can be directly connected with just one link. So the worst-case path length is 1 for any pair. So the figure of merit for the fully connected network would be L1 multiplied by the worst-case path length. So that's (n(n-1)/2) * 1 = n(n-1)/2.

Next, the ring network. Each processor is connected to two others—so it's a circular arrangement. Each node has a degree of 2. The total number of links is n, since it's a ring. Now, the worst-case path length between any two nodes in a ring. For a ring, the worst-case path is the shortest path in either direction. Since it's a ring, the maximum distance between two nodes is ceiling(n/2). Wait, no, wait. Wait, for a ring with n nodes, the maximum distance between two nodes is floor(n/2). Because if you have a ring, the maximum distance is when the two nodes are as far apart as possible. For example, in a ring of 4 nodes, the maximum distance is 2. So for even n, the maximum path is n/2. For odd n, it's (n-1)/2. Wait, the question says n is even, so n is even. So the maximum distance is n/2.

So the worst-case path length for the ring is n/2.

So the figure of merit for the ring network is L2 * worst-case path length. L2 is the number of links, which is n (since it's a ring). So the figure of merit is n * (n/2) )= n²/2.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, let me recheck. The number of links for the ring is n. So, L2 is n. The worst-case path length is n/2, as per even n. So the figure of merit for the ring is n * (n/2) = n²/2.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. The figure of merit is the product of links multiplied by the worst-case path length. So for the fully connected network, it's (n(n-1)/2) * 1 = (n² -n)/2.

For the ring network, it's n (number of links) multiplied by (n/2) (worst-case path length). So that's (n) * (n/2) )= n²/2.

So now, the ratio of the fully connected to the ring network is (n^2 -n)/2 divided by (n²/2). Let's compute that.

Ratio = [ (n² - n)/2 ] / (n²/2) ) = (n² -n)/2 * 2/(n²) ) = (n² -n)/(n²) ) = (n(n-1))/n² )= (n-1)/n.

Wait, but wait! Let me make sure. The ratio is the FIC's figure of merit divided by the RIN's figure of merit.

FIC = (n(n-1)/2) * 1 = n(n-1)/2.

RIN = (n) * (n/2) )= n²/2.

So ratio FIC/RIN = [n(n-1)/2 ] / (n²/2 ) )= [n(n-1)/2 ] * [2/(n²) ] = (n-1)/n.

Hmm. So the ratio is (n-1)/n.

Looking at the options, option A is (n-1)/n. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, did I make any mistakes here? Let me double-check.

Fully connected network: L1 = n(n-1)/2. Since each pair is directly connected, worst-case path length is 1. So FIC = L1 * 1 = n(n-1)/2.

Ring network: L2 = n. The maximum distance between any two nodes is n/2. So RIN = L2 * (n/2) = (n)(n/2) = n²/2.

So FIC/RIN = [n(n-1)/2 ] / [n²/2 ] = (n-1)/n.

Yes, that's correct. So the correct option is A.

To determine the ratio of the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network to the ring network, we analyze each network type separately.

### Fully Interconnected Network:
1. **Number of Links (L1):**  
   For a fully interconnected network with \( n \) processors, each processor is directly connected to every other processor. The total number of links is given by:  
   \[
   L1 = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
   \]

2. **Worst-Case Path Length:**  
   In a fully interconnected network, any two processors are directly connected with a single link. Thus, the worst-case path length is 1.

3. **Figure of Merit (FIC):**  
   The figure of merit is the product of the number of links and the worst-case path length:  
   \[
   \text{FIC}_{\text{fully interconnected}} = L1 \times 1 = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
   \]

### Ring Network:
1. **Number of Links (L2):**  
   In a ring network, each processor is connected to exactly two others, forming a circular structure. The total number of links is:  
   \[
   L2 = n
   \]

2. **Worst-Case Path Length:**  
   For a ring network with \( n \) processors, the worst-case path length between any two processors is the shortest path in either direction. Since \( n \) is even, the maximum distance between two processors is \( \frac{n}{2} \).

3. **Figure of Merit (RIN):**  
   The figure of merit is the product of the number of links and the worst-case path length:  
   \[
   \text{RIN} = L2 \times \frac{n}{2} = n \times \frac{n}{2} = \frac{n^2}{2}
   \]

### Ratio of FIC to RIN:
The ratio is calculated as:  
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{FIC}_{\text{fully interconnected}}}{\text{RIN}} = \frac{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}{\frac{n^2}{2}} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \times \frac{2}{n^2} = \frac{n-1}{n}
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network to the ring network is \( \frac{n-1}{n} \), which corresponds to option **A**.
