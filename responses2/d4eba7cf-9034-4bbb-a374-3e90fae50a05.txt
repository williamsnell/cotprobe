The wife testified that she and her husband had a close relationship and that they were happily married for over 15 years. Then on cross-examination, defendant's counsel asked her if she "was aware of the affair that her husband was having with his passenger?"The wife's attorney immediately objected to this question.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this legal question. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario: A husband and his passenger were killed in a car accident. The husband's wife is suing for damages because she lost society and companionship. The wife testified that she and her husband had been close for over 15 years. Then, the defendant's counsel asks her if she was aware of a relationship her husband was having with his passenger. Her attorney objects, and the judge is supposed to decide whether the question is relevant, objectionable, etc.

First, I need to understand the legal issue here. The question is about whether the defendant's cross-examination should be made. The issue revolves around whether the question is relevant to the case. So, the key is whether the question affects the outcome of the case.

The wife's attorney is objecting because she's asking if she was aware of the relationship with the passenger. So, what's the purpose of this question? The defendant is trying to determine whether the wife's claim about the husband's past relationship is relevant.

In criminal law, specifically negligence, the question of whether a past relationship affects the outcome is crucial. If the defendant's question is whether the wife's claim is a material issue, it could influence the jury's conclusion.

Looking at the options, option E says the question is unobjectionable because it was relevant on the issue of negligence. That makes sense because if the question was irrelevant, there would be no point in it. And in this case, the question is about whether the husband's relationship affects the wife's claim. If the defendant's interest is whether the wife's claim is material, then the question is relevant.

Option A says it's irrelevant because it's about something not directly related to the case. But that's not true because the issue is about the husband's past relationship, which is directly relevant to the negligence question.

Option B suggests it could influence the jury's perception. That's a bit vague, but it's related. If someone's claim is relevant, they can affect how the jury views the case.

Option C mentions reputation. But the question is about the wife's knowledge, not the reputation. reputation is more about the impact on the deceased's image, which isn't directly the issue here.

Option D says it's prejudicial. That's a strong word. If the question is about a past relationship, it's probably not prejudicial because the issue isn't about the harm caused by the accident.

Option E, as I thought earlier, is about relevance. If the question is relevant, the answer should be given. If it's not, the question is irrelevant.

Option G is about beyond the scope of direct examination. But since the question is about awareness, it's within the scope of a cross-examination.

Option H is about privacy. But the question is about knowing the relationship, not about the privacy of the deceased.

Option I says it provides a potential motive. But this is about the wife's knowledge; it's not about the accident's consequences.

So, putting it together: the question is about whether the wife's claim is relevant. The purpose is to determine if the husband's past relationship with his passenger affects the negligence claim. If the question is relevant, the answer is necessary. If it's not relevant, the question is irrelevant.

The question is about the husband's awareness, not about the accident. So, it's a legitimate question in the context of the case at hand. Therefore, the correct answer is E: the question is unobjectionable because it's relevant to the issue of negligence.
