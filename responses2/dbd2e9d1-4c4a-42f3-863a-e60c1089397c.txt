Question:

Mouse sperm contain receptor proteins that bind to a glycoprotein (ZP3) in the zona pellucida of mouse eggs. Binding of ZP3 receptors to ZP3 initiates the sperm’s acrosomal reaction. All of the following experimental observations would be expected EXCEPT:

Options:

A: Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.
B: Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs blocks in vitro fertilization.
C: Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.
D: Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about mouse sperm and the zona pellucida. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

The question is asking which experimental observation would NOT be expected if the last character of the answer is the letter chosen. The options are A to D.

First, let me read the question again. It says that mouse sperm have receptors that bind to a glycoprotein called ZP3 in the zona pellucida (ZP). When ZP3 receptors bind to ZP, it initiates the acrosomal reaction, which is involved in in vitro fertilization.

The options are all statements about experiments that would block in vitro fertilization. I need to figure out which one is the exception.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.

Wait, so if you have antibodies that target ZP3, the antibodies would bind to the ZP3 in the egg. Since the egg's ZP3 is being targeted, the ZP3 receptors in the sperm wouldn't be able to bind. So in the acrosomal reaction, which is the process where the sperm's surface receptors attach to the ZP3 to fertilize, the receptors won't function. So in vitro fertilization would fail because the receptors can't bind. So this would not be expected. Wait, but the question is which is the exception, meaning which would NOT be expected. So if this is the case, option A would be a correct answer if the statement is that it blocks in vitro fertilization.

Option B: Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing prevents in vitro fertilization.

Wait, why? Because the receptors are meant to bind to ZP3. So if you have the ZP3 (like the same as in option A) in the sperm, then when you mix with the eggs, the receptors would bind. But if you have purified ZP3, maybe the ZP3 is outside the sperm. Or wait, if you're adding ZP3 to the sperm. Oh, perhaps the idea is that if you have the ZP3 in the sperm with the eggs, then the receptors would bind. But if you have the ZP3 in the sperm and you don't have the ZP3 in the eggs (i.e., you have purified ZP3), then the ZP3 can't enter the sperm. So in that case, the receptors can't bind. So this prevents in vitro fertilization.

Wait, but option A is about the antibodies; option B is about having ZP3 in the sperm along with possible ZP3 from the eggs.

Wait, no, option B says "prepurated ZP3 prior to mixing." Wait, but the question says that the receptors bind to the ZP3 in the zona pellucida. So in the sperm, the receptors are present. So if you have the ZP3 in the sperm (from the egg's ZP3) and you don't have ZP3 in the sperm to begin with, then the receptors can't bind. So that would prevent the reaction.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me rephrase.

The acrosomal reaction involves the sperm's receptors binding to the ZP3 in the egg. So if you have the ZP3 in the sperm and you have the same ZP3 in the egg, then the receptors can bind. But if you have the ZP3 in the sperm but no ZP3 in the egg, the receptors can't bind. So adding ZP3 to the sperm (without it being present in the egg) would prevent the reaction.

Wait, but the option says "prepurated ZP3 prior to mixing." So if you have the ZP3 in the sperm already, and you add a purified ZP3 from the egg (which hasn't been taken in), then the ZP3 can't enter the sperm. So the receptors can't bind, so the reaction is blocked. So option B is a correct expectation. But wait, the question is which of the options is the exception. So if option B is a correct expectation, then the question is which one is the one that would not occur.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think about each option.

Option C: Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.

If you have antibodies that bind to ZP3, then the antibodies would be present in the eggs. Since the antibodies would inhibit the binding of ZP3 to the receptors in the sperm, the receptors can't bind. So the acrosomal reaction is blocked. So option C would be a correct expectation. It's a statement that would block in vitro fertilization. So this is a correct expected observation.

Option D: Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads.

Wait, ZP2 is another glycoprotein. So if you coat beads with ZP2, would that prevent sperm from aggregating? Or maybe it would allow ZP2 to aggregate with the sperm. Or perhaps ZP2 is a different glycoprotein that doesn't bind to the receptors.

Wait, no. The initial setup is that ZP3 is the one that binds. If you use ZP2, which is a different glycoprotein, maybe it doesn't bind to the receptors. So if the beads are coated with ZP2, then the receptors in the sperm won't be able to bind to ZP2. So during the acrosomal reaction, the receptors can't attach. That would block the reaction. So if the beads are coated with ZP2, you wouldn't get any binding, so the reaction is blocked.

Wait, but the option says that when you coat with ZP2, the reaction doesn't go. So that would be a correct expectation. Which would imply that it's a blocked outcome.

Wait, but the question is which one would be the exception. So the option that is a correct expected outcome is D. So if you coat with ZP2, you don't get aggregation, so the reaction is blocked, so this is a correct expectation. So it's not the exception.

Wait, but the question is which one is the exception. So the correct answer would be the option that would not happen if something is done.

Let me re-examine the options.

The question is: Which observation is NOT expected.

So, the correct answer is the one that would fail in an experiment.

Option A: The statement says that injecting antibodies that target ZP3 blocks in vitro. So this is correct because the antibodies would prevent the receptors from binding, which is a correct expectation.

Option B: Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing. Wait, but if the sperm is already containing ZP3 (as it's the egg's), then adding ZP3 from the egg (which is likely not present) would block the receptors. So this would block the reaction. Therefore, this is a correct expectation.

Option C: Incubating with antibodies that bind to ZP3. This is correct, as mentioned before.

Option D: Coating beads with ZP2. If the beads are coated with ZP2, then the receptors in the sperm cannot bind to ZP2. So the reaction is blocked, which is a correct expectation.

Wait, so all options except one are correct. So which is the exception.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-express each option.

Option A: Antibodies bind to ZP3, so no receptors can bind. So in vitro fertilization (which requires the receptors to bind) would be blocked. So this is correct.

Option B: Pre-purified ZP3. Hmm. If you have the ZP3 in the sperm, and you have it in the egg (so you have it in the sperm), then it's all good. But if you have the ZP3 in the sperm and don't have it in the egg (so you have a pure form), then the receptors can't bind. So the reaction is blocked. So this is correct.

Option C: Antibodies prevent binding. Correct.

Option D: Using ZP2 as a coating doesn't let the receptors bind. Correct.

Wait, so all the options except one are correct. But that's impossible because the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So all options except one are correct, and the correct answer is the one that is incorrect. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me think again. Are any of these observations impossible?

Wait, another approach: What would prevent the acrosomal reaction?

The acrosomal reaction requires the receptors in the sperm to bind to ZP3 in the egg. So if either the receptors can't bind (like option A with antibodies that bind to ZP3) or the ZP3 can't enter the sperm (like option B, where ZP3 is in the egg but not in the sperm, so can't bind), then the reaction is blocked.

So, which of the options is something that doesn't happen.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to think about each option.

Option B says: Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing.

Wait, if the sperm is already containing ZP3 (as in, the egg's ZP3), then the presence of ZP3 in the sperm allows the receptors to bind. Unless the ZP3 is not available in the egg for the reaction. So perhaps option B is incorrect because it's mixing the same ZP3 (which is in the sperm) with another ZP3 (prepurated). Wait, but that would cause the receptors to be unable to bind. So option B would be a correct expectation.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is whether ZP3 is in the egg and the sperm.

In the experiment, the ZP3 is in the egg, and the sperm has its own receptors. So when you mix, the receptors in the sperm bind to the ZP3 in the egg. So if the ZP3 is available in the egg, the reaction proceeds.

But if you have the ZP3 in the sperm, and no ZP3 in the egg, the reaction doesn't proceed.

So option B is a statement where the experiment would block in vitro fertilization.

Wait, but the option says: Incubating with ZP3 prior to mixing. So perhaps you have the ZP3 in the egg and the sperm already has that ZP3. So if you mix, the receptors can bind. So option B is correct.

Wait, but if you have the ZP3 in the sperm and no ZP3 in the egg, then the reaction would be blocked. So the option B is about having ZP3 in the sperm along with a pure form, which would block.

Wait, but in option B, the description says "prepurated ZP3 prior to mixing." So perhaps the ZP3 is already in the sperm, and you introduce the pure form from the egg into the same cell. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the option is that you incubate the sperm (with their own receptors) with the ZP3 from the egg. If you have ZP3 in the sperm and not in the egg, the reaction would be blocked.

Wait, but the option says to incubate with the ZP3 from the egg. So perhaps in option B, you're adding ZP3 from the egg into the sperm, which would block the reaction.

Wait, but in that case, the option is that mixing would block in vitro. So option B is correct.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think of each option.

The question is, which is the answer that would not occur.

Alternative approach: Each option describes a scenario that would block in vitro fertilization, except one.

Which one does not?

Option A: Antibodies that bind to ZP3 → no receptors → reaction blocked. Correct expectation.

Option B: Incubating sperm with ZP3 prior to mixing. Wait, if the ZP3 is in the sperm and the egg's ZP3 is not present, the reaction wouldn't proceed. But if you have pure ZP3 from the egg, then the reaction would proceed. So the statement in option B says that when you mix, including a pure ZP3, the reaction is blocked. So that's correct.

Option C: Incubating with ZP3 antibodies → same as A, correct expectation.

Option D: Coating beads with ZP2 → which doesn't bind to the receptors, so reaction fails. So correct expectation.

Wait, but all options describe correct expectations except one. So which is the exception.

I think I must have made a mistake in my initial analysis. Let me re-examine each option:

Looking back, the correct answer is the one that would not occur.

So the question is, which of the options is not expected?

Option D: Coating with ZP2. If the ZP2 is a different glycoprotein, and the receptors in the sperm can't bind to it, then the reaction can't happen. So the beads would prevent any aggregation, meaning the reaction can't occur. So this is a correct expectation. Thus, option D is a correct expectation, so it's not the exception.

Wait, perhaps the exception is option B. Let me think again.

Option B says that when you incubate the sperm with the purified ZP3, it blocks in vitro. But in reality, if the ZP3 is in the sperm, then it should be available. Unless the ZP3 is taken from the egg and mixed into the sperm, which would prevent it. So option B would not happen, but it's a scenario where the reaction is blocked.

Wait, perhaps option B is incorrect because it's mixing the same ZP3 (which is in the sperm) with a separate ZP3 (from the egg), which would prevent binding.

Wait, perhaps option B is correct. Then none of the options are correct, which can't be because the question implies that one is not expected.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the initial setup wrong.

Wait, the question says, the receptors bind to the ZP3 in the zona pellucida. So the ZP3 is inside the egg. When you mix the sperm and the egg, the receptors in the sperm (which are in the sperm) bind to the ZP3 in the egg. So if the ZP3 is in the sperm, but not in the egg, the reaction can't happen.

So all the options except one would have the reaction blocked.

Wait, perhaps the exception is option A. But option A's statement is that the antibodies would block. So if the antibodies are present, the receptors can't bind. So that's correct.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again.

The question is which experiment would not be expected.

If, according to the options, all are correct except one, which one?

Looking for the one that doesn't happen.

Wait, another thought: Option B says that you have the ZP3 in the egg and the sperm already has it. So during mixing, the ZP3 is in the same cell (the sperm) and the egg (so the ZP3 is available). So the receptors would bind. Thus, in that case, the reaction is not blocked. So the option B would not occur. So the statement in option B is incorrect, because it says that the reaction is blocked. So the option B is incorrect, which would be the exception.

Wait, no. If the ZP3 is already in the sperm, and the egg has it, then the reaction proceeds. So option B is a scenario that would not block, so the statement is that it blocks would be incorrect. So option B is not expected, and thus the answer would be option B.

Wait, but the question asks which would be the exception, meaning which is not expected. So if option B says that incubating with ZP3 prior to mixing blocks, but in reality, if the ZP3 is in the sperm, it would not block. So the statement in B is that it blocks, which is not the case. So the correct answer is B.
</think>

To determine which experimental observation would not be expected, let us analyze each option based on the given context:

The acrosomal reaction in in vitro fertilization involves the binding of the acrosomal receptors in the sperm to the Zone of Pellucida (ZP3) in the egg. Binding of ZP3 receptors to ZP3 is essential for the reaction to proceed. If any step in the process is inhibited, the acrosomal reaction will fail, leading to a failed fertilization.

### Analysis of Each Option:

**Option A:**  
Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.  
- If antibodies bind to ZP3, they would prevent the ZP3 receptors in the sperm from binding to ZP3. This would block the acrosomal reaction, making this observation expected.  
- **Conclusion:** This is a correct expectation.

**Option B:**  
Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing blocks in vitro fertilization.  
- If the ZP3 is already in the sperm (as it is in the egg), the ZP3 receptors in the sperm would naturally bind to ZP3, allowing the reaction to proceed.  
- If the ZP3 is introduced separately from the egg, it would block the reaction.  
- The statement in this option implies that ZP3 is in the egg and the reaction is blocked, which is incorrect because the reaction would proceed if ZP3 is already in the sperm.  
- **Conclusion:** This is an incorrect expectation.

**Option C:**  
Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.  
- Antibodies that bind to ZP3 would prevent the receptors in the sperm from binding to ZP3, blocking the acrosomal reaction.  
- This is a correct expectation.  
- **Conclusion:** This is a correct expectation.

**Option D:**  
Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads.  
- If ZP2 is a different glycoprotein that does not bind to the ZP3 receptors in the sperm, the receptors would not bind to ZP2, blocking the acrosomal reaction.  
- This is a correct expectation.  
- **Conclusion:** This is a correct expectation.

### Final Answer:
The only observation that would not be expected is **Option B**, as it incorrectly suggests that incubating with purified ZP3 would block the reaction. The correct answer is:

**ANSWER: B**
