Okay, so I have this problem here about golf balls and their cost. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that a bucket of 40 golf balls costs $4.00. And they're asking how much a bucket of 100 would cost at the same rate. Hmm, right, so I need to find the cost per ball and then scale it up to 100.

First, let me calculate the cost per golf ball. If 40 balls cost $4, then each ball would cost 4 divided by 40. Let me do that calculation: 4/40 equals 0.10 dollars per ball. So each ball is 10 cents.

Now, for 100 balls, I multiply the cost per ball by 100. So 100 times 0.10 is $10.00. Wait, but let me double-check. 100 divided by 40 is 2.5, so 2.5 sets of $4.00. 2.5 times 4 is 10. Yes, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option E is $10.00. So that should be the correct answer.

The cost per golf ball is calculated by dividing the total cost by the number of balls: $4.00 / 40 = $0.10 per ball. For 100 balls, the cost is 100 * $0.10 = $10.00. 

Answer: E
