Question:

A physician is conducting a retrospective review of a trial involving the use of Drug X in patients with a specific disease. It is known that Drug X is associated with an increased probability of cancer in patients who use the drug. A total of 600 individuals with a specific disease were included in the trial. Of the participants, 200 individuals received Drug X and 400 individuals did not receive it. One hundred individuals who received Drug X died of a particular type of cancer and 100 individuals who did not receive the drug died of the same type of cancer. Based on these data, which of the following is the relative risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X as compared with individuals who do not take Drug X?

Options:

A: Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
B: Individuals who take Drug X have four times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
C: Individuals who take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
D: Individuals who take Drug X have six times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
E: Individuals who do not take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
F: Individuals who take Drug X have half the risk of dying from this type of cancer
G: Individuals who take Drug X have an equal risk of dying from this type of cancer
H: Individuals who do not take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
I: Individuals who take Drug X have five times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
J: Individuals who take Drug X have zero risk of dying from this type of cancer

Okay, so I've got this question about relative risk in a medical trial. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that a physician is looking at a trial where Drug X is used in patients with a specific disease. Drug X is associated with an increased risk of cancer in users. There were 600 participants in total. 200 took the drug, and 400 didn't. Of those, 100 who took the drug died, and 100 who didn't take it died. They're asking about the relative risk of death for those who take the drug compared to those who don't.

Relative risk is the ratio of the probability of an event occurring in the exposed group versus the unexposed group. So, in this case, the event is dying from the cancer. The exposed group is the ones who took the drug, and the unexposed are those who didn't.

So, the exposed group: 200 people, 100 died. That's 100/200 = 0.5 or 50%.

The unexposed group: 400 people, 100 died. That's 100/400 = 0.25 or 25%.

Wait, no. Wait, relative risk is (died in exposed)/(died in unexposed). So (100/200) / (100/400) = (0.5)/(0.25) = 2. So the relative risk is 2 times. So the exposed group has twice the risk. So the answer would be A: Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check. Wait, relative risk is (a/b)/(c/d), where a is number exposed and died, b is number exposed and alive, c is number not exposed and died, d is not exposed and alive.

So a = 100, b = 200-100=100? Wait no: No, a is 100 (exposed died), b is 200 (exposed alive, since 200-100=100 alive. Similarly, c=100, d=300 (400-100=300 alive). So relative risk is (100/200) / (100/400) → (0.5)/(0.25) → 2. So yes, the risk is twice as high for those who took the drug. So the answer is A.

But wait, wait another thing. Let me think. The question is about relative risk, which is risk in the exposed compared to the unexposed. So relative risk (RR) is RR = (Risk exposed) / (Risk unexposed).
Risk exposed = 100/200 = 0.5
Risk unexposed = 100/400 = 0.25
RR = 0.5 / 0.25 = 2.

So the relative risk is 2, meaning individuals who take the drug have twice the risk. So the answer is A.

The question involves calculating the relative risk of death for individuals who take Drug X compared to those who do not. Relative risk is defined as the ratio of the probability of an event occurring in the exposed group versus the unexposed group.

- **Exposed group (took Drug X):** 200 individuals, 100 died.  
  - Probability of death (risk) = 100/200 = 0.5 or 50%.
- **Unexposed group (did not take Drug X):** 400 individuals, 100 died.  
  - Probability of death (risk) = 100/400 = 0.25 or 25%.

The relative risk is calculated as:
  
  \[
  \text{Relative Risk (RR)} = \frac{\text{Risk in exposed}}{\text{Risk in unexposed}} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
  \]

This means individuals who take Drug X have twice the risk of dying compared to those who do not take it. 

**Correct Answer:** A: Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer.
