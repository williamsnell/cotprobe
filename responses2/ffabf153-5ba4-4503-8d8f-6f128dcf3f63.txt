Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about countries X and Y. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question states that the population of country X is exactly the same as country Y. So, pop(X) = pop(Y). But country X's output is twice as much as Y. So, output(X) = 2 * output(Y).

The question is asking what we can conclude from this. Let's think about what standard of living means. Standard of living is usually related to how much a person earns, the quality of life, and access to resources. So, perhaps factors like output, population, resource availability, education, etc., play a role.

Let me look at each option:

Option A: The people of X are smarter. Hmm, that's not directly given. We don't have any info about intelligence or education levels. The question doesn't mention anything about that.

Option B: The people of Y work twice as hard. Again, no info on work hours or productivity. We know output is double, but that doesn't necessarily mean effort is double.

Option C: Country X has twice as much land. Not given. The question doesn't mention any land allocation.

Option D: The people of X enjoy twice the standard of living. So, standard of living could relate to output per person. Let's compute that. Output(X) is 2 * output(Y), and population is the same. So, output per person in X is 2 * Y's output per person. So, yes, D says X's people have twice as much standard of living as Y's.

Option E: X people work half as much. That's the opposite of D. If X's output is higher, perhaps they work more, but it's not stated. So E is probably not correct.

Option F: Y has twice the population density. Population density is population over area. If X's output is higher but population is same, that doesn't directly translate to density. Unless X has more area, but the question doesn't specify. So F is not necessarily true.

Option G: Y has twice the standard of living. Wait, if X's output is double, then per person, it's double. So G is the opposite of D. So unless the population is same, their standard of living would be higher. So G is saying Y has higher, but we don't have info on that.

Option H: X has twice the natural resources. Natural resources aren't mentioned. So H is out.

Option I: X work half as much. That would mean output would be half. But X's output is double, so I is incorrect.

So the correct conclusion is option D: the people of X enjoy a standard of living twice as much as Y's.

The correct answer is D: the people of country X enjoy a standard of living twice as much as country Y.
