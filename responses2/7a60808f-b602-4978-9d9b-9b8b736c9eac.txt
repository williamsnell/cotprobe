Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon. Hmm, I've learned that gravity is an inverse square law force, which means the force depends on the masses and the distance between the centers of the two objects. Oh wait, Newton's law of universal gravitation, right?

The question gives me the masses: Earth is 5.97 × 10²⁴ kg and the Moon is 7.35 × 10²² kg. The distance is 3.84 × 10⁵ km. Oh wait, I should probably convert that into meters because the SI units for gravity are in meters. So, 1 km is 1000 meters, so 3.84e5 km is 3.84e5 * 1e3 = 3.84e8 meters. Let me double-check that: 3.84e5 km is 3.84 x 10^5 km, and each km is 1e3 meters, so 3.84e5 * 1e3 = 3.84e8 meters. Yeah, that's right.

Now, Newton's law is F = G * (m1 * m2) / r². What's G? Oh, the gravitational constant is 6.674×10^-11 N·m²/kg². So I need to plug all these numbers into the equation.

Let me write down the formula again to make sure I don't make a mistake:

F = G * (M_earth * M_moon) / (r^2)

Wait, but wait, sometimes I see it written with G as the gravitational constant, yes. So M_earth is 5.97e24 kg, M_moon is 7.35e22 kg, and r is 3.84e8 meters.

Let me compute the numerator first: 5.97e24 * 7.35e22. Hmm, multiplying those together. Let's see, 5.97 *7.35 is approximately... 5.97 *7 is about 41.79, and 5.97 *0.35 is about 2.09. So adding together, 41.79 + 2.09 = 43.88. Now, the exponents: e24 * e22 = e46. So the numerator is approximately 43.88 ×10^46.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 5.97e24 *7.35e22:

5.97 *7.35 = let's compute that more accurately. 5 *7 is 35. 5*0.35=1.75. 0.97 *7=6.79. 0.97 *0.35=0.3395. So adding up:

35 + 1.75 = 36.75; 6.79 + 0.3395 = 7.1295. Total is 36.75 +7.1295 =43.8795. So approximately 43.88, so 43.88e46 kg².

Wait, but wait, 5.97e24 kg and 7.35e22 kg. So 5.97e24 *7.35e22 = (5.97 *7.35) ×1e(24+22) = 43.8795 ×1e46 → 4.38795e47? Wait, no, wait: 5.97e24 is 5.97 * 10^24, and 7.35e22 is 7.35 *1e22. So when multiplied, it's (5.97 *7.35) × 1e(24+22) → 43.8795 ×1e46 → 4.38795e47. Wait, no, 1e24 *1e22 is 1e46, so it's 4.38795e47 kg².

Wait, no, I think maybe I'm making a mistake in the exponent. Because 5.97e24 is 5.97 *1e24, and 7.35e22 is 7.35*1e22. So when multiplied, the exponents add. 1e24 *1e22 = 1e46. So 5.97 *7.35 =43.8795, so 43.8795e46 → 4.38795e47 kg².

Now, the denominator is r squared. r is 3.84e8 meters. So r squared is (3.84e8)^2. Let's compute that. 3.84 squared is about 14.7456. So (3.84e8)^2 = 14.7456e16 (since (1e8)^2 is 1e16). So the denominator is 1.47456e17 m² (because 14.7456e16 is 1.47456e17? Wait, wait, 14.7456e16 is 1.47456e17, because 14.7456 is 1.47456e1. So 14.7456e16 = 1.47456e17.

Now, F = (6.674e-11) * (4.38795e47) / (1.47456e17)

Let me compute the numerator first: 6.674e-11 *4.38795e47 = ?

Multiplying the coefficients: 6.674 *4.38795 ≈ let's compute that. 6 *4.38795 is 26.3277; 0.674 *4.38795 ≈ around 2.95. So total approx 26.3277 + 2.95 = 29.2777.

Wait, but let me be more precise. 6.674 *4.38795.

Let me compute 6.674 *4.38795.

Hmm, 6 *4=24. 6 *0.38795=2.3277.

0.674 *4=2.696.

0.674 *0.38795 ≈ 0.2617.

So adding all parts:

24 + 2.3277 = 26.3277

+ 2.696 → 29.0237

+0.2617 → 29.2854.

So the product is about 29.2854.

So 29.2854e( -11 +47 ) → 29.2854e36.

Wait, because 1e-11 *1e47 =1e36.

So the numerator is 29.2854e36.

Denominator is 1.47456e17.

So F = (29.2854e36) / (1.47456e17) = ?

Divide the coefficients: 29.2854 /1.47456 ≈ approximately 19.84.

Wait, let me compute 29.2854 /1.47456.

Well, 1.47456 *19 ≈ 28.01664 (because 1.47456 *20=29.4912; 1.47456*(20-1) =29.4912-1.47456=28.01664) So 19 gives 28.01664. We have 29.2854. So 29.2854 -28.01664=1.26876 left. So 1.26876 /1.47456 ≈ 0.863.

So 19.863 → approximately 19.86.

So F ≈ 19.86e(36-17) → 19.86e19 → 1.986e20 N.

Wait, wait, 19.86e19 is 1.986e20 N.

The question says the magnitude is X *10^20 N, so X is 19.86 approximately. But the options are in whole numbers. The closest options are 19.86, which is about 20. But let's check the options again.

Options are:

A:1.92

B:2.00

C:2.10

D:1.85

E:1.80

F:2.15

G:1.99

H:1.75

I:2.08

J:2.05

Wait, none of them is exactly 20. Hmm, but perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the exponent in the denominator. Let me check that.

Wait, r is 3.84e8 meters. So r squared is (3.84e8)^2 = (3.84)^2 * (1e8)^2 = 14.7456 * 1e16 → 1.47456e17 m². So denominator is correct.

So recalculating:

F = (6.674e-11) * (5.97e24 *7.35e22) / (3.84e8)^2.

Let me recompute the exponents:

Wait, 5.97e24 *7.35e22 = (5.97 *7.35) *1e(24+22) → 43.8795e46 → 4.38795e47 kg².

Denominator: (3.84e8)^2 = (3.84)^2 * 1e16 = 14.7456e16 → 1.47456e17 m².

So F = (6.674e-11) * 4.38795e47 /1.47456e17.

Multiply 6.674e-11 by 4.38795e47: 

6.674e-11 *4.38795e47 = (6.674 *4.38795) * 1e( -11 +47 ) → (29.2854) *1e36 =2.92854e37.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the exponent earlier. Oh! Because 6.674e-11 *4.38795e47 is (6.674 *4.38795 ) *1e(-11 +47) → 29.2854 *1e36 = 2.92854e37.

Ah, here's where I went wrong. So the numerator is 2.92854e37, denominator is 1.47456e17.

So F = (2.92854e37) / (1.47456e17) → (2.92854 / 1.47456) * e^(37-17) → 2.92854 /1.47456 ≈ 1.985e20.

Wait, 2.92854 divided by 1.47456 is approximately 1.985, so 1.985e20 N. So X is 1.985, which is approximately 2.0. The options are B:2.00, and J:2.05. Hmm, but 1.985 is closer to 2.00 than 2.05. But wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me recheck the division.

Wait, 1.47456 × 1.985: Let me compute 1.47456 × 2 =2.94912. Subtract 1.47456 × 0.015. 0.015 *1.47456 = 0.0221184. So 2.94912 - 0.0221184= 2.927. Hmm, which is close to 2.92854. So yes, 1.985 is correct.

So, F ≈ 1.985e20 N. So X is about 1.985, which is approximately 1.99 (option G) or 2.00 (option B). Since 1.985 is closer to 1.99 than 2.00, but looking at the options, G is 1.99 and B is 2.00. Wait, but wait: 1.985 is 1.99 when rounded to two decimal places, but perhaps I should be considering one decimal place. Hmm, the question says "the magnitude of the gravitational force is X *10^20 N". So, when I got 1.985e20, that's 1.985 *1e20 N. So X is 1.985, but the options don't include that. So the possible options are B:2.00 and G:1.99. Hmm. Since 1.985 is closer to 2.00 than to 1.99, but perhaps the question expects rounding to the nearest tenth. 1.985 is 2.0 when rounded to one decimal place. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value more accurately. Let me calculate the numerator and denominator more precisely.

Numerator: 6.674e-11 * (5.97e24 *7.35e22) = 6.674e-11 * (4.38795e47) = Let me compute 4.38795e47.

Wait, 5.97e24 =5.97 *1e24, 7.35e22=7.35 *1e22. 5.97 *7.35 = 43.8795. 1e24 *1e22=1e46. So 43.8795e46 →4.38795e47.

So 6.674e-11 *4.38795e47 = 6.674 *4.38795 *1e( -11 +47 ) → 6.674 *4.38795 = 29.2854, so 29.2854e36 → 2.92854e37.

Denominator: (3.84e8)^2 = (3.84)^2 * (1e8)^2 =14.7456 *1e16 →1.47456e17.

So F = (2.92854e37) / (1.47456e17) = (2.92854/1.47456) *1e(37-17) → 2.92854/1.47456 = let me compute this accurately.

So 1.47456 ×1.985 → 2.927 as before. So 2.92854 /1.47456 is approximately 1.985.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2.92854 ÷1.47456 more precisely.

Let me compute 1.47456 ×1.985.

1.47456 *1.985 = ?

Let me compute 1.47456 *1.985.

Break it down:

1.47456 *1 = 1.47456.

1.47456 *0.985 = ?

Compute 0.985 = 1 -0.015.

So 1.47456 *1 =1.47456.

1.47456 *0.015 →0.0221184.

So 0.985 *1.47456 =1.47456 -0.0221184 =1.4524416.

Now, add to get 1.47456 (from 1) plus 1.4524416 (from 0.985) → 1.47456 +1.4524416 =2.9270016.

Wait, so 1.985 *1.47456≈2.9270016.

But our numerator is 2.92854e37, denominator is 1.47456e17.

Wait, to find (2.92854e37)/(1.47456e17) = (2.92854/1.47456) *1e20 →1.985, correct.

So F≈1.985e20 N. So X is 1.985, which is approximately 1.99 (option G) or 2.00 (option B). Since 1.985 is closer to 1.99 than 2.00, but looking at the options, G is 1.99 and B is 2.00. So which option is correct? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gravitational constant. Oh, wait, no, G is correct. Wait, perhaps the calculation of 5.97e24*7.35e22 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

5.97 *7.35:

5 *7 is 35.

5 *0.35=1.75.

0.97 *7=6.79.

0.97 *0.35=0.3395.

So 35 +1.75 =36.75; 6.79 +0.3395=7.1295.

So 5.97 *7.35 =43.8795.

Yes, that's correct.

So the calculation seems correct. So F = approximately 1.985e20 N, which is approximately 1.99e20 N. So the correct answer is G:1.99. But wait, let me check the calculation once again.

Wait, let's compute F via the formula again, perhaps using a different approach.

Compute F = G * M1 * M2 / r².

Where G is 6.67430e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

Wait, no, but I think perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of M1*M2. Let me compute M1 * M2 again.

M1 = 5.97e24 kg.

M2 =7.35e22 kg.

M1 * M2 =5.97e24 *7.35e22 = (5.97 *7.35) *1e(24+22) =43.8795 *1e46 →4.38795e47 kg².

Denominator: (3.84e8 m)^2 = (3.84)^2 * (1e8)^2 =14.7456 *1e16 →1.47456e17 m².

So F = G * (4.38795e47) / (1.47456e17) → (6.6743e-11) * (4.38795e47) / (1.47456e17).

Compute numerator:6.6743e-11 *4.38795e47.

Multiply 6.6743 and4.38795 →6.6743 *4.38795 = let's compute accurately.

6 *4 =24.

6 *0.38795=2.3277.

0.6743 *4=2.6972.

0.6743 *0.38795≈0.2618.

So summing 24 +2.3277=26.3277.

+2.6972=29.0249.

+0.2618=29.2867.

So approximately 29.2867.

So 6.6743e-11 *4.38795e47 =29.2867e(-11+47) =29.2867e36.

Divide by denominator 1.47456e17:

29.2867e36 /1.47456e17 = (29.2867 /1.47456 ) *e^(36-17)= (29.2867 /1.47456 ) *e19.

Compute 29.2867 /1.47456.

Let me compute 1.47456 *19.85 = let's see.

19.85 *1.47456.

Compute 19 *1.47456 =28.0164.

0.85 *1.47456 =1.253376.

So 28.0164 +1.253376 =29.269776.

But our numerator is 29.2867, which is a little higher.

So 19.85 gives 29.269776, which is slightly less than 29.2867.

The difference is 29.2867 -29.269776 =0.016924.

So how many more? 0.016924 /1.47456 → approximately 0.01144.

So 19.85 +0.01144=19.86144.

So 29.2867 /1.47456 ≈19.8614.

So F ≈19.8614e19 N.

Wait, but that's 1.98614e20 N. So X is 1.986, which is approximately 1.99 (option G) or 2.00 (option B).

But wait, perhaps I should use a calculator for the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the value using a calculator function.

But given that I can't do that here, perhaps I should proceed with the initial calculation.

So F ≈1.985e20 N. So X is 1.985, which is approximately 1.99 (option G) or 2.00 (option B). The correct answer is G:1.99.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute F using the exact formula.

Compute:

F = G * (M1 * M2) / r².

G =6.67430e-11

M1 =5.97e24 kg

M2=7.35e22 kg

r=3.84e8 m

So F =6.67430e-11 * (5.97e24 *7.35e22) / (3.84e8)^2.

Compute M1*M2:5.97e24 *7.35e22 =5.97 *7.35 *1e46 =43.8795e46 =4.38795e47 kg².

Denominator: (3.84e8)^2 =3.84^2 *1e16 =14.7456e16 →1.47456e17 m².

So F =6.67430e-11 *4.38795e47 /1.47456e17.

Compute numerator:6.67430e-11 *4.38795e47 =6.67430 *4.38795e-11+47 →6.67430 *4.38795e36.

6.67430 *4.38795 = compute more accurately.

Let me compute 4.38795 *6.67430.

Multiply 6 *4.38795 =26.3277.

Multiply 0.6743 *4.38795.

Compute 0.6 *4.38795 =2.63277.

0.07 *4.38795 =0.307156.

0.0043 *4.38795 =0.018814.

Add them up:2.63277 +0.307156=2.939926 +0.018814=2.95874.

So total is 26.3277 +2.95874 =29.28644.

So 6.67430 *4.38795 =29.28644.

So numerator becomes 29.28644e36.

Denominator is 1.47456e17.

So F =29.28644e36 /1.47456e17 = (29.28644 /1.47456 )e20.

Compute 29.28644 /1.47456.

Let me compute 1.47456 *19.85 =29.2599.

Wait, let me compute 1.47456 *19.85:

19 *1.47456 =28.0164.

0.85 *1.47456 =1.253376.

Adding:28.0164 +1.253376 =29.269776.

Which is less than 29.28644.

Difference:29.28644 -29.269776=0.016664.

So 0.016664 /1.47456 =0.01134.

So 19.85 +0.01134=19.86134.

So 29.28644 /1.47456 ≈19.86134.

So F ≈19.86134e20 N →1.986134e21 N?

Wait, no, wait: 29.28644e36 /1.47456e17 = (29.28644 /1.47456 )e(36-17)= (29.28644 /1.47456 )e19.

Wait, wait, 36-17=19, so F = (29.28644/1.47456)e19.

Wait, 29.28644/1.47456≈19.86134.

So F≈19.86134e19 N →1.986134e20 N.

So approximately 1.986e20 N.

So X is approximately 1.986, which is closer to 1.99 (option G) than to 2.00 (option B). But wait, 1.986 is 1.99 when rounded to two decimal places. So the correct answer is G:1.99.

But wait, looking back at the options, the options are:

A:1.75

B:2.00

C:2.15

D:2.30

E:2.45

F:2.60

G:1.99

H:2.10

I:2.25

J:2.40

So, the correct answer is G:1.99.

But wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because 1.986e20 N is approximately 2.00e20 N, which would be 2.00, option B. But 1.986 is 1.99, so perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, no, perhaps I should check once more.

Wait, let me compute 6.6743e-11 * 4.38795e47.

That's 6.6743 *4.38795 =29.28644.

Exponent: -11 +47 =36.

So 29.28644e36.

Divide by 1.47456e17 →29.28644/1.47456=19.86134.

Multiply by e^(36-17)=e^19.

Wait, no, that's exponents: e^36 / e^17 =e^(36-17)=e^19.

So F =19.86134e19 N.

Wait, but 19.86134e19 is 1.986134e20 N.

Ah, okay, so that's correct.

So F≈1.986e20 N.

Which is approximately 1.99e20 N, so X is approximately 1.99, option G.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused because I thought the value was 1.986e20 N. So the correct answer would be G:1.99.

But wait, I think perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me try to compute F using a calculator approach.

Compute F = G * M1 * M2 / r².

G =6.6743e-11

M1 =5.97e24

M2=7.35e22

r=3.84e8

Compute M1*M2 =5.97e24 *7.35e22 = (5.97 *7.35) *1e46 =43.8795 *1e46 =4.38795e47.

Compute r² = (3.84e8)^2 =3.84^2 *1e16 →14.7456 *1e16 =1.47456e17.

Compute numerator: G * M1 * M2 =6.6743e-11 *4.38795e47 =6.6743 *4.38795e36 =29.28644e36.

Compute F = numerator / r² =29.28644e36 /1.47456e17 =29.28644 /1.47456 *e20.

Wait, 29.28644 /1.47456 =19.86134.

So F=19.86134e20 N →1.986134e21 N.

Wait, no, no. Wait, 29.28644e36 /1.47456e17 = (29.28644 /1.47456 ) *e^(36-17) = (29.28644 /1.47456 ) *e^19.

Wait, no, wait: 36-17=19, so exponent is 19, so F= (29.28644 /1.47456 ) *e^19 N.

Wait, that's incorrect. Wait, because when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract the exponents.

Wait, for example, (a^m / a^n ) = a^(m-n).

So, 29.28644e36 /1.47456e17 = (29.28644 /1.47456 ) * (e36 / e17 ) = (29.28644 /1.47456 ) * e^(36-17) = (29.28644 /1.47456 ) * e^19.

Wait, but that can't be right because when you divide two exponentials with different exponents, you subtract the exponents. So if it's (a^m)/(a^n) = a^(m-n).

So, 29.28644e36 /1.47456e17 = (29.28644 /1.47456) * (e36 / e17) = (29.28644 /1.47456) * e^(36-17) = (29.28644 /1.47456) * e^19.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because 36-17=19, so (e36)/(e17) =e^(36-17)=e^19.

So, the final exponent is e^19, so F = (29.28644 /1.47456 ) *e^19.

Wait, but that's not correct because when you divide two exponentials with the same base, you subtract the exponents, not the other way around.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the operations. Let me think again: (a^m)/(a^n) = a^(m-n). So if m=36 and n=17, then (a^36)/(a^17) =a^(36-17)=a^19.

Yes, correct. So F = (29.28644 /1.47456 ) * e^19.

Wait, but that's not possible. Because when you divide two exponentials with the same base, you subtract the exponents. So (a^m)/(a^n) = a^(m-n).

So, F = (29.28644 /1.47456 ) * e^(36-17) = (29.28644 /1.47456 ) * e^19.

Wait, but that's not correct, because e^36 / e^17 =e^(36-17)=e^19.

So F = (29.28644 /1.47456 ) * e^19.

Wait, but that's incorrect because 29.28644e36 /1.47456e17 = (29.28644 /1.47456 ) * (e36 / e17 ) = (29.28644 /1.47456 ) * e^(36-17)= (29.28644 /1.47456 ) * e^19.

Wait, but that's incorrect because e^36 /e^17 =e^19.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me compute F using exponents correctly.

So, F = (G * M1 * M2) / r².

G =6.6743e-11

M1 =5.97e24

M2=7.35e22

r=3.84e8

Compute numerator: G * M1 * M2 =6.6743e-11 *5.97e24 *7.35e22.

Compute 5.97 *7.35 =43.8795.

Compute exponents: 1e-11 *1e24 *1e22 =1e(-11+24+22) =1e35.

So numerator:43.8795e35.

Denominator: r² = (3.84e8)^2 = (3.84)^2 *1e16 =14.7456e16 =1.47456e17.

So F =43.8795e35 /1.47456e17.

Compute 43.8795 /1.47456 ≈29.86.

Then, 29.86e(35-17) =29.86e18.

Wait, but that's 2.986e20 N.

Wait, but according to this calculation, F ≈2.986e20 N.

But earlier calculation gave F≈1.986e20 N.

So which one is correct? I must have made a mistake in one of the calculations.

Wait, let me recompute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: G * M1 * M2.

G =6.6743e-11.

M1 =5.97e24.

M2 =7.35e22.

So M1*M2 =5.97e24 *7.35e22.

Multiply the coefficients:5.97 *7.35 =43.8795.

Multiply the exponents:1e24 *1e22 =1e46.

So M1*M2 =43.8795e46 =4.38795e47.

Now, multiply by G:

G * M1*M2 =6.6743e-11 *4.38795e47.

Multiply the coefficients:6.6743 *4.38795 ≈29.2864.

Multiply the exponents:1e-11 *1e47 =1e36.

So numerator =29.2864e36.

Denominator: r² = (3.84e8)^2.

3.84e8 squared: (3.84)^2 =14.736, 1e8 squared is 1e16.

So denominator =14.736e16 =1.4736e17.

Now, F = numerator / denominator =29.2864e36 /1.4736e17.

Divide the coefficients:29.2864 /1.4736 ≈19.86.

Divide the exponents: e(36-17)=e19.

So F =19.86e19.

Wait, that's 1.986e20 N.

Ah, so the correct calculation gives F≈1.986e20 N.

So X is approximately 1.986, which rounds to 1.99, option G.

But earlier I thought I made a mistake, but perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, but according to these calculations, the correct answer is G:1.99.

To determine the magnitude of the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon, we use the formula:

\[
F = G \cdot \frac{M_1 \cdot M_2}{r^2}
\]

Where:
- \( G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg} \cdot \text{s}^2 \),
- \( M_1 = 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \),
- \( M_2 = 7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg} \),
- \( r = 3.84 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( M_1 \cdot M_2 \)
\[
M_1 \cdot M_2 = (5.97 \times 10^{24}) \cdot (7.35 \times 10^{22}) = 43.8795 \times 10^{46} = 4.38795 \times 10^{47} \, \text{kg}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( G \cdot M_1 \cdot M_2 \)
\[
G \cdot M_1 \cdot M_2 = (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (4.38795 \times 10^{47}) = 29.2864 \times 10^{36} = 2.92864 \times 10^{37} \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg}/\text{s}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( r^2 \)
\[
r^2 = (3.84 \times 10^8)^2 = 14.736 \times 10^{16} = 1.4736 \times 10^{17} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 4: Divide to find \( F \)
\[
F = \frac{2.92864 \times 10^{37}}{1.4736 \times 10^{17}} = (2.92864 / 1.4736) \times 10^{20} \, \text{N}
\]
\[
F \approx 1.986 \times 10^{20} \, \text{N}
\]

Thus, the magnitude of the gravitational force is approximately \( 1.986 \times 10^{20} \, \text{N} \), which corresponds to option **G: 1.99**.

ANSWER: G: 1.99
