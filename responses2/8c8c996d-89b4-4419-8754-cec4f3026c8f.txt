Okay, so I've got this problem about polynomials and derivatives. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about the set P of polynomials with coefficients in Z_5 (which is the integers mod 5) and degree less than or equal to 7. So each polynomial in P has coefficients 0-4, and the highest degree term is x^7 or lower. 

The operator D is taking a polynomial p(x) in P and sending it to its derivative p'(x). The question is asking about the dimensions of the null space (n) and the range (r) of D.

Hmm, I remember that the null space of a linear operator consists of all vectors (in this case, polynomials) that map to zero. So the null space would be all polynomials p(x) such that Dp(x) = 0. The range would be all possible derivatives of such polynomials.

First, let's think about the null space. For a polynomial p(x) of degree less than or equal to 7, its derivative p'(x) will have a degree one less. So if p(x) is of degree 7, p'(x) is degree 6. But for the derivative to be zero, p(x) must be a constant polynomial. Because the derivative of a constant is zero. Wait, but in Z_5, the constant could be any element from 0 to 4. So the only way p'(x) is zero is if p(x) is a constant. So the null space consists of all constant polynomials in P.

What's the dimension of the null space? Well, a constant polynomial is of the form a*1, where a is in Z_5. So there are 5 such constants: 0,1,2,3,4. So the null space has dimension 5? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the null space is all polynomials that map to zero under D. So each element of the null space is a constant polynomial. So the null space is isomorphic to Z_5, which has dimension 1. Because it's one-dimensional. Wait, wait. Let me think again. The space P has dimension 8, because the coefficients are 8 parameters (from x^0 to x^7). But the null space is the set of constant polynomials, which has 5 elements, so it's a one-dimensional subspace. So the nullity (dimension of null space) is 1.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me correct that. Wait, the null space is the set of polynomials p(x) where Dp(x)=0. So p(x) must be a constant, like a*1. Each such p(x) is determined by the constant a, and there are 5 possible a's (0,1,2,3,4 in Z_5). So the null space is a one-dimensional vector space over Z_5, so the dimension is 1. So n=1.

Now, the range r is the set of possible derivatives. So when we apply D to any p(x) in P, we get p'(x), which is a polynomial of degree at most 6. So the range is all polynomials of degree at most 6. What's the dimension of that space?

The space of polynomials of degree ≤6 has dimension 7+1=8, because you have coefficients for x^0 to x^6. So the range of D is all degree ≤6 polynomials, which have dimension 8. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the operator D in this case is a linear transformation from P (dimension 8) to the space of degree ≤6 polynomials (dimension 7, because x^0 to x^6 is 7 terms). Wait, no: wait, the dimension of the space of degree ≤6 is 7 coefficients. Wait, no: the number of coefficients is 7 (from x^0 to x^6, which is 7 terms). So the space of such polynomials is 7-dimensional. So the range of D would be 7-dimensional. 

Wait, but wait, the range is the image under D. So, for example, if I take all polynomials in P, their derivatives will have degree 7-1=6, but some derivatives could be zero. So the image of D is all polynomials of degree ≤6, which is a 7-dimensional space. So the rank is 7. 

Wait, but the options don't have an option with r=7 and n=1. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: 

A: n=0, r=8 → no, because n is 1.

B: n=3, r=5 → no, n is 1.

C: n=1, r=8 → r=8 would mean the image is the entire space of degree ≤7, but D can't go beyond degree 6. So r can't be 8, because the maximum degree would be 6. So C is incorrect.

D: n=2, r=7 → n=1, r=7. So no, because n should be 1.

E: n=1, r=7 → That fits. The nullity is 1, and the rank is 7.

F: n=0, r=7 → No, because n is 1.

G: n=2, r=5 → No, n is 1, r is 7.

H: n=3, r=4 → No, n is 1.

I: n=2, r=6 → No.

J: n=1, r=6 → No.

Wait, so the correct option is E: n=1 and r=7.

Wait, but another way to think: the operator D is a linear transformation from P to P', where P' is the space of polynomials of degree ≤6. The dimension of P is 8 (coefficients x^0 to x^7). The image of D is P' (since any derivative of a degree 7 polynomial is degree 6). So the rank is 7, and the nullity is 8 - 7 = 1. So n=1, r=7. So the correct answer is E.

The problem involves the linear operator \( D \) that maps a polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree ≤7 to its derivative \( p'(x) \). The null space \( n \) consists of all constant polynomials, which forms a one-dimensional subspace. The range \( r \) is the set of all polynomials of degree ≤6, which has dimension 7. Thus, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: E
