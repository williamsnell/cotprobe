B: The state has the highest unemployment rate in the country.
C: The statute was overwhelmingly adopted by the voters of the state.
D: The statute will increase the state's overall economic productivity.
E: The statute was enacted in response to a major construction company hiring out-of-state workers for a large project.
F: The statute will encourage more citizens to gain skills in the construction industry.
G: The statute will help racial minorities living in the state obtain gainful employment.

Okay, so I've got this question about a state's statute and its impact on unemployment. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that the state has a new statute that prohibits awarding state construction contracts unless the recipient company or person agrees to hire only state citizens. The main argument is that this helps alleviate unemployment. The question is asking which argument is strongest if the statute is attacked as violating the commerce clause.

Hmm, I remember that the commerce clause in the U.S. Constitution protects states from clear and distinguishing distinctions in their laws. It's about ensuring that state laws don't interfere with private enterprise. So if this statute is seen as potentially interfering with that, it's a violation.

Looking at the options, which argument supports the statute? The argument that the state would help reduce unemployment would be one that's in line with creating demand for labor, which would make companies hire fewer people. Wait, but the statute requires hiring only citizens, so maybe it's about reducing the number of companies willing to hire, thus lowering unemployment.

Wait, but if the state is banning out-of-state hires, that would actually reduce the demand for state workers. But the statute is supposed to prevent them from doing so. So if someone argues that this reduces the number of people looking for jobs, it might be an argument against the statute. But wait, the question is which argument supports the statute if attacked as a commerce clause violation.

Wait, but let's think about the options again. The options are all possible claims someone might make to support the statute. If the statute is a violation, which argument would it strengthen? Let me think about each.

Option I: The statute will ensure that benefits stay within the state. Wait, I'm not sure how that ties in. The statute's purpose is about labor, not about benefits. So maybe not directly about commerce unless there's a way to argue that benefits are affected, but that doesn't sound right.

Option G: The statute will help racial minorities gain skills. If the state is restricting out-of-state hiring, it might make it harder for minority companies to hire state workers, which could reduce their demand for local workers. That would help minority workers find jobs, which would support the statute. But does that tie into commerce? Because it's about reducing demand for labor, but I'm not sure if that's a direct commerce clause issue.

Option H: The statute will ensure benefits stay within the state. Wait, that's about benefits, not labor. So probably not relevant.

Option J: The statute will discourage out-of-state companies. If the state requires out-of-state hiring, then companies can't bring in more workers from outside, which would reduce demand for local workers. That would help local businesses, which aligns with the idea of helping mitigate unemployment. But if the statute is a violation, why would this be a strong argument? It seems more like a negative argument against the statute.

Alternatively, looking for the strongest argument, the primary purpose is to reduce unemployment. If the statute is a violation, the argument against it would be that it's interfering with private enterprise, thus violating the commerce clause. So, which of the options directly addresses that concern?

Option I: The statute will ensure benefits stay within the state. No, that's about benefits, not the main issue.

Wait, another angle. The statute is about hiring only citizens. So if someone is arguing that it reduces demand for state workers, which in turn reduces demand for local workers, that could help with unemployment. But how does that tie into the commerce clause? The commerce clause is about whether the state's actions interfere with private economic activities. If the statute effectively restricts private contractors, that could be seen as a violation. 

Now, looking at each option, which one directly supports the statute's purpose. Option G says it will help racial minorities gain jobs. If the state is restricting out-of-state hiring, that might make it harder for minority companies to hire state workers, thus reducing demand for local labor. This could create a shortage of jobs in the state, especially for minorities. That supports the statute's purpose of helping reduce unemployment. But is that a direct argument against the commerce clause?

Wait, perhaps the argument is about the statute's impact on demand. If the state can't hire out-of-state workers, that reduces demand for state workers, which lowers unemployment. But does that violate the commerce clause? Because the state is blocking private contractors from hiring local workers, which could be seen as a restriction on private enterprise. 

So the strongest argument would be that the statute reduces the demand for state workers, thereby reducing unemployment. So which option supports that?

Looking at the options, the argument would be that this statute reduces demand for state workers, which in turn reduces unemployment. Which of the options directly supports that. Alternatively, option G: The statute will help racial minorities gain skills. That's about reducing demand for local workers, which could lead to lower unemployment, but does that tie back to the commerce clause?

Alternatively, perhaps the strongest argument is that the statute would increase state economic activity by reducing out-of-state hiring. That would help stimulate local businesses, but I'm not sure how that directly ties into commerce.

Wait, another approach: The purpose of the statute is to help reduce unemployment. So when someone argues that the statute is a violation, they'd likely point to how it's interfering with private enterprise. The options that point to that would be the ones that highlight that.

Looking for an argument that the statute violates the commerce clause, which is about whether state laws can interfere with private activity. The statute's purpose is to ensure that companies hire only citizens, which would restrict private contractors from hiring state workers. So that's a violation, because it's limiting private businesses' ability to hire, thus interfering with their ability to compete.

So the strongest argument would be that the statute violates the commerce clause because it restricts private contractors from hiring state workers, thus interfering with their ability to conduct business.

Which option is that? Let me look again.

Option I: The statute will ensure benefits stay within the state. No, that's about benefits.

Option G: The statute will help racial minorities gain skills. That's about reducing demand for local workers.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is which argument supports the statute if it's attacked as a commerce clause violation. So the argument should show that this statute is violating the commerce clause because it's limiting private activity.

Looking at the options, perhaps option I is about benefits, which isn't directly relevant to the commerce clause.

Wait, maybe option E: The statute was enacted in response to a major construction company hiring out-of-state workers. No, that's about the reason it was enacted, not about its effect.

Alternatively, option J: The statute will discourage out-of-state companies. If the state requires only state workers, then out-of-state companies are discouraged, which would lead to less demand for state workers. That would help reduce unemployment. But how does that tie into commerce clause violation?

Wait, think again. The statute is banned because it violates the commerce clause. So if the state's statute is a violation, it's because it's restricting private contractors from hiring local workers. So the stronger argument would be that this statute is a violation of the commerce clause because it's restricting private contractors from engaging in business activities, thereby hindering their ability to compete.

So the strongest argument would be that the statute violates the commerce clause because it restricts private contractors from hiring state workers, which would block private businesses from competing, thus interfering with their ability to perform their economic activities. Which of the options supports that?

Looking at the options, perhaps none directly state that. But the question is about which argument, if established, supports the statute if it's attacked as a violation. So which of the given options is a strong point against the statute.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to realize that the statute's purpose is to help reduce unemployment. If the state's law is seen as a violation, the argument would be that it's harmful to the economy by restricting private contractors.

So looking for an option that argues that out-of-state hiring is harmful.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps option I is about benefits staying within the state. It doesn't directly tie into the commerce clause.

Alternatively, perhaps the strongest argument is that the statute reduces demand for local workers, which supports the statute's purpose.

Wait, but in terms of commerce clause, the statute could be seen as restricting private contractors, thus hindering their ability to perform their economic activities. So the argument would be that this is a commerce clause violation.

But none of the options directly state that. So perhaps the best answer is that the statute will increase state economic productivity.

Wait, option H says the statute will promote local businesses and stimulate economic growth. That aligns with the purpose of reducing unemployment. But how does that tie into the commerce clause? Because promoting local businesses would likely be seen as supporting private enterprise.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of each option and see which one best supports the statute's purpose.

The primary purpose is to help alleviate unemployment. So if the state's law is a violation, which argument would support that?

If the law restricts out-of-state hiring, it would reduce demand for local workers, which in turn reduces unemployment. So that would support the statute's purpose. So which option states that? Let's look.

Option G: The statute will help racial minorities gain gainful employment. That's about reducing demand for local workers, which might help minorities. But is that a direct support for the statute's main purpose? So perhaps that's an argument against the statute.

Alternatively, option H: The statute will promote local businesses. That would support reducing unemployment because local businesses would be more likely to hire local workers, leading to higher demand and higher employment. But that's more about local businesses' benefits, not necessarily about reducing unemployment.

Wait, the primary purpose is to help alleviate unemployment. If the state is a violation, the argument against it would be that this law is interfering with private contractors, which are private businesses. So the strongest argument would be that this statute is a violation of the commerce clause because it restricts private contractors from hiring local workers.

But looking at the options, perhaps the argument that it discourages out-of-state companies is stronger, as it directly impacts the state's ability to attract jobs.

Wait, another approach: The statute's purpose is to help reduce unemployment. So if the state is a violation, the argument would be that this law is harmful to the economy. So which option directly supports that?

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is that the state will have less demand for its own workers, leading to lower unemployment. So among the options, which one supports this?

Looking at the options, none of them directly state this. But perhaps option I isn't relevant.

Wait, perhaps option G is the best. The statute will help racial minorities gain skills. If the state can't hire out-of-state workers, then the demand for local workers would drop, particularly for minorities. That would support the statute's purpose of helping reduce unemployment.

But again, is that a direct argument against the commerce clause? Because it's about reducing demand for local workers, which is a form of reducing demand for local businesses, which could be seen as a restriction on private enterprise.

Wait, perhaps the strongest argument is that the statute will increase state economic productivity by reducing out-of-state hiring, thereby stimulating local businesses and economic growth. But how does that tie into the commerce clause?

Alternatively, perhaps the best answer is option G. Because if the state can't hire out-of-state workers, then the demand for local workers would decrease, which would help people gain jobs, especially for minorities.

Wait, but the question is about the purpose of the statute. The statute aims to help reduce unemployment. So if the state's law is a violation, the argument would be that it's harmful to the economy, thus violating the commerce clause. Which option supports that?

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is that the statute will increase state economic activity by reducing out-of-state hiring. That would support the statute's purpose. So among the options, which one is that.

Option I is about benefits. Option E is about discouraging out-of-state companies. Option J is about discouraging local businesses.

Wait, perhaps the strongest argument is that the statute will help local businesses and stimulate economic growth. That would support the statute's purpose. But how does that tie into the commerce clause.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option I. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the statute's purpose is to help reduce unemployment. If the state is a violation, then the argument would be that this is harmful to the economy, thus violating the commerce clause.

Looking for that, perhaps the strongest argument would be that this statute would reduce demand for local workers, which in turn reduces unemployment. But I'm not seeing an option that directly states that.

Wait, perhaps the strongest argument is option G. Because it supports the statute's purpose of reducing unemployment.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps none of the options directly address the commerce clause, but the argument would be that this law is a violation because it's restricting private contractors, thus hindering their ability to compete in the economy.

But the question is which argument supports the statute if it's attacked as a violation. So among the options, which one is the strongest.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think about each option again.

The statute requires that companies hire only citizens. So if someone is saying that this law is a violation, they might argue that it's a restriction on private contractors, thus hindering private enterprise. That's a commerce clause violation.

Now, which option supports that? None of the options directly state that, but perhaps option I is about benefits. Option E is about out-of-state hiring. Option J is about local businesses.

Wait, perhaps the strongest argument is that this statute will help racial minorities gain skills. That would support the statute's purpose of reducing unemployment because it would reduce the demand for local workers, especially for minorities.

Alternatively, the best answer might be option G, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option G. Because the statute will help racial minorities gain skills. If the state can't hire out-of-state workers, that would mean that local businesses can't hire as many people from other regions, especially minorities. So this reduces the demand for local workers, helping people gain jobs, which supports the statute's purpose.

But again, I'm not sure if that's a direct argument against the commerce clause. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, promoting local businesses and economic growth. But that doesn't directly tie into the commerce clause.

Hmm, I'm not sure. But I think the best fit is option G.
</think>

The question revolves around a state's statute that restricts out-of-state contractors from hiring local employees, with the primary purpose of alleviating unemployment. The issue at hand is identifying which argument supports the statute if it is attacked as violating the commerce clause. The commerce clause prohibits states from discriminating against private businesses, and if the statute is seen as imposing such a restriction, it would be a violation.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A**: Talks about taxpayer funds for construction materials, but this doesn't directly address the statute's purpose or its impact on unemployment.
2. **Option B**: States the highest unemployment rate in the country, unrelated to the statute's purpose or its economic impact.
3. **Option C**: The statute's success depends on its adoption, not directly on the commerce clause issue.
4. **Option D**: Encourages economic growth, but this doesn't directly tie into the impact on unemployment.
5. **Option E**: Encourages out-of-state companies to hire local workers, which would reduce demand for local employment, supporting the statute's purpose.
6. **Option F**: Promotes skill development for minorities, which could reduce the demand for local labor, supporting the statute's purpose.
7. **Option G**: Reduces demand for local workers, particularly for minorities, which directly supports alleviating unemployment.
8. **Option H**: Promotes local businesses, which could stimulate economic growth but doesn't directly address the commerce clause.
9. **Option I**: Ensures benefits stay within the state, unrelated to the statute's impact on unemployment.
10. **Option J**: Encourages out-of-state companies to hire local workers, which would reduce demand for local employment, supporting the statute's purpose.

### Key Reasoning:
The statute's purpose is to reduce unemployment by limiting out-of-state hiring. If it's attacked as a commerce clause violation, the strongest argument would be that it restricts private contractors from engaging in business activities, hindering private enterprise. Among the options, **Option G** directly supports the statute's purpose by reducing demand for local workers, especially for minorities, thereby helping alleviate unemployment.
