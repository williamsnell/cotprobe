Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to these concepts. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about calculating the entropy of vaporization for chloroform. I remember that entropy has to do with the disorder of the system, so when a substance vaporizes, it goes from a more ordered liquid to a less ordered gas state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, the problem gives me the enthalpy of vaporization, which is 29.4 kJ/mol. Oh, right, enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH_vap) is the energy required to turn a liquid into vapor. And I need to find the entropy of vaporization (ΔS_vap), which is the entropy change when the phase change occurs.

I think the formula connecting enthalpy and entropy for a phase change is the Gibbs equation: ΔS = ΔH / T, but wait, only when the process occurs at constant temperature. Oh right, and since we're dealing with vaporization at the boiling point, T is the boiling point temperature.

But wait, the units. The given ΔH is in kJ/mol, and the entropy is expected in J/(mol·K). So I need to convert the units properly.

The normal boiling point of chloroform is 334.88 K. Okay.

So, the plan is: take the given ΔH_vap (29.4 kJ/mol), convert it to J by multiplying by 1000, then divide by T (334.88 K) to get the entropy in J/(mol·K).

Let me do the calculation.

29.4 kJ/mol is 29400 J/mol. Divide by 334.88 K.

Hmm, 29400 / 334.88. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 334.88 is approximately 335 K. So 29400 / 335 ≈ let's see, 335 × 87 is 29245, because 300×87=26100, 35×87=3045 → 26100+3045=29145. Wait, 335 × 87 is 335 * 80 = 26800, plus 335*7=2345, total 29145. So 29400 - 29145 is 255. So 87 and 255/335. 255/335 is about 0.76. So approximately 87.76 J/(mol·K).

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let's do 29400 ÷ 334.88.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 29400 / 334.88.

334.88 goes into 29400 how many times?

Hmm, 334.88 * 87 = let's compute 334.88 *80 = 26790.4, 334.88*7=2344.16. So 26790.4 +2344.16=29134.56.

Subtracting from 29400: 29400 -29134.56=265.44. So 87 times with a remainder of 265.44.

Now, 265.44 /334.88 = 0.793 approximately.

So total is 87.793 J/(mol·K), which is about 87.8 J/(mol·K).

Looking at the options:

Option C is +87.8 J/(mol·K). That's the one.

To calculate the entropy of vaporization (ΔS_vap) for chloroform, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{\Delta H}{T}
\]

where:
- \( \Delta H \) is the enthalpy of vaporization, given as \( 29.4 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol} \), which converts to \( 29400 \, \mathrm{J/mol} \).
- \( T \) is the boiling point temperature, \( 334.88 \, \mathrm{K} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{29400 \, \mathrm{J/mol}}{334.88 \, \mathrm{K}} \approx 87.8 \, \mathrm{J/(mol·K)}
\]

Thus, the entropy of vaporization of chloroform is approximately \( +87.8 \, \mathrm{J/(mol·K)} \).

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C: +87.8 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹**
