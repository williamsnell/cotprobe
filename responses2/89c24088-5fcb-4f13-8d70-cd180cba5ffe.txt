Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons emitted from a material when light hits it. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let's see if I can figure it out step by step.

The question says that ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 300 nm strikes a material with a work function of 2.0 eV. I need to find the velocity of the electrons emitted. The options are all in the order of 0.4 to 1.8 million meters per second, so I'm thinking this is a problem involving the photoelectric effect.

Wait, right, the photoelectric effect involves photons providing enough energy to eject electrons from a material. The key equation here is Einstein's photoelectric equation, which states that the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is equal to the photon energy minus the work function of the material.

So the equation is: 

KE_max = (hc/λ) - φ

Where:
- h is Planck's constant,
- c is the speed of light,
- λ is the wavelength of light,
- φ (phi) is the work function.

Once I calculate the kinetic energy, I can find the velocity of the electrons using the equation for kinetic energy, KE = (1/2)mv². Solving for v would give me the velocity.

Let me jot down the given numbers:

λ = 300 nm = 300e-9 m. 
φ = 2.0 eV. 
h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3.0e8 m/s
m of an electron is 9.11e-31 kg.

First, I need to compute the photon energy from the wavelength. The energy E is given by E = hc/λ.

But wait, since the work function is given in electron volts (eV), and the energy of the photon is in joules, I need to convert everything to compatible units. Alternatively, I can use eV directly since 1 eV is the energy gained by an electron moving through a potential of 1 volt. Hmm, but maybe using joules is more straightforward.

Let me compute hc/λ first. 

hc = 6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide that by λ (300e-9 m):

E_photon = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (300e-9 m) = (1.9878e-25) / (3e-7) = approximately 6.626e-19 J.

Wait, 300e-9 is 3e-7 meters? Oh, no, wait, 300 nm is 300e-9 m. So 3e-7 m is correct.

Now, E_photon = 6.626e-19 J.

But since the work function is in eV, I should convert that to joules. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So φ = 2.0 eV = 2 * 1.602e-19 J = 3.204e-19 J.

Now, KE_max = E_photon - φ

= 6.626e-19 J - 3.204e-19 J = 3.422e-19 J.

Hmm, that's the maximum kinetic energy. Now I need to find the velocity v.

Kinetic energy is also (1/2)mv². So,

v = sqrt(2 KE_max / m)

Plugging in the numbers:

KE_max = 3.422e-19 J
m = 9.11e-31 kg

So,

v = sqrt( (2 * 3.422e-19 ) / (9.11e-31) )

First compute 2 * 3.422e-19 = 6.844e-19.

Divide by 9.11e-31:

6.844e-19 / 9.11e-31 = approx (6.844 / 9.11) * 1e12 ≈ 0.75 * 1e12 = 7.5e11.

Wait, more precisely: 6.844 divided by 9.11 is:

Well, 9.11 goes into 6.844 about 0.75 times since 9.11 * 0.75 is 6.8325. So approximately 0.75.

So 0.75e12 = 7.5e11.

Wait, actually, 6.844e-19 / 9.11e-31 = (6.844 / 9.11 ) * 1e12. 

6.844 / 9.11 ≈ 0.75. So 0.75e12 m²/s².

Wait, that's the result of 2 KE_max / m. So the velocity would be sqrt(0.75e12) = sqrt(7.5e11) m²/s².

Wait, no: 0.75e12 is 7.5e11. So sqrt(7.5e11) = sqrt(7.5) * 1e5.5. Wait, 1e5.5 is 3.16e5, but wait, 1e12 is (1e6)^2, so sqrt(1e12) is 1e6.

Wait, wait, 7.5e11 is 7.5 * 1e11 = 7.5 * 1e11. So sqrt(7.5) is about 2.7386. So sqrt(7.5e11) = 2.7386e5.5, wait but that's not right. Wait, no, 7.5e11 is 7.5 * 1e11. So sqrt(7.5) is about 2.7386, and sqrt(1e11) is 1e5.5 = 3.16e5 (since sqrt(1e10) is 1e5, so sqrt(1e11) is 3.16e5). So altogether, sqrt(7.5e11) = 2.7386 * 3.16e5 ≈ 8.64e5 m/s? Wait, but 8.6e5 m/s is 860,000 m/s. But when looking at the options, the highest is 1.8e6 m/s, which is option J. But that doesn't make sense because the velocity can't be that high. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, E_photon = (hc)/λ. So for λ = 300 nm (300e-9 m),

hc = 6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ:

E_photon = 1.9878e-25 / 3e-7 = (1.9878 / 3) * 1e-18 = 0.6626e-18 J → 6.626e-19 J.

Work function φ is 2eV, which is 3.204e-19 J.

So KE_max is 6.626e-19 - 3.204e-19 = 3.422e-19 J.

Then, KE_max = (1/2)mv² → v² = (2 KE_max)/m.

So 2 * 3.422e-19 = 6.844e-19.

Divide by m=9.11e-31 kg:

v² = (6.844e-19) / (9.11e-31) → let's compute that.

6.844e-19 / 9.11e-31 = (6.844 / 9.11) * 1e12.

6.844 /9.11 ≈ 0.75.

So 0.75e12 → 7.5e11.

So v = sqrt(7.5e11) → sqrt(7.5) is approx 2.7386, sqrt(1e11) is 3.16e5.

So 2.7386 * 3.16e5 = approximately 8.64e5 m/s.

Wait, but 8.6e5 is 860,000 m/s, which is 0.86e6 m/s. Looking at the options, option A is 0.87e6, which is close.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because 0.86e6 is option A: 0.87e6 m/s. But wait, another thought: did I compute the velocity correctly? Because when I did the calculation, I have 8.6e5 m/s, which is 0.86e6 m/s. Option A is 0.87e6, which is very close. So perhaps that's the answer.

But let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I get confused with exponents.

Wait, 7.5e11 is 7.5 x 1e11 = 750,000,000,000. Taking the square root:

Approximate sqrt(750e9) → 27.386e4.5 → wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 7.5e11 m²/s² → v = sqrt(7.5e11) m/s.

Wait, 7.5e11 is 750,000,000,000.

Let me compute the square root.

I know that (27386)^2 = approx (2.7386e4)^2 = approx 7.5e8. Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, wait, let me think differently. Let's compute sqrt(7.5e11):

Well, 7.5e11 = 750,000,000,000.

The square root of 750,000,000,000 is sqrt(7.5e11) = sqrt(7.5) * sqrt(1e11) → sqrt(7.5)≈2.7386, sqrt(1e11)=1e5.5 = 3.1623e5.

Multiply them: 2.7386 * 3.1623e5 → approximately 8.642e5 m/s → 864,200 m/s.

Which is about 0.8642e6 m/s. So that's about 0.86e6 m/s.

The options are A: 0.87e6, which is about 0.87 million. So option A matches.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the initial calculation, I got 8.64e5, but option A is 0.87e6, which is 8.7e5. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, another thought: Did I calculate the velocity correctly? Let me think again.

Wait, the formula is v = sqrt(2 KE_max / m). KE_max is 3.422e-19 J.

So 2 * 3.422e-19 = 6.844e-19.

Divide by m =9.11e-31 kg: 6.844e-19 /9.11e-31 = ?

6.844e-19 / 9.11e-31 = (6.844 /9.11) * 1e12 = approximately 0.75e12.

So 0.75e12 = 7.5e11.

Square root of 7.5e11 is about 8.64e5 m/s. That's 0.864e6 m/s. So option A is 0.87e6, which is the closest.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To determine the velocity of the electrons emitted from the material, we use the photoelectric effect equation and the kinetic energy formula. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate the energy of the incident photon**:  
   The energy of a photon is given by  
   \[
   E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]  
   where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 300 \, \text{nm} = 300 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \).  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{300 \times 10^{-9}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Convert the work function to joules**:  
   The work function \( \phi \) is given as \( 2.0 \, \text{eV} \). Since \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \),  
   \[
   \phi = 2.0 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} = 3.204 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Calculate the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons**:  
   The maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is given by:  
   \[
   K_{\text{max}} = E_{\text{photon}} - \phi
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   K_{\text{max}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-19} - 3.204 \times 10^{-19} = 3.422 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]

4. **Relate kinetic energy to velocity**:  
   The kinetic energy is also expressed as:  
   \[
   K_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( v \):  
   \[
   v = \sqrt{\frac{2 K_{\text{max}}}{m}}
   \]  
   Here, \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of an electron. Substituting the values:  
   \[
   v = \sqrt{\frac{2 (3.422 \times 10^{-19})}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}}}
   \]  
   Simplify the numerator:  
   \[
   2 (3.422 \times 10^{-19}) = 6.844 \times 10^{-19}
   \]  
   Divide by \( 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \):  
   \[
   \frac{6.844 \times 10^{-19}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}} = 7.5 \times 10^{11}
   \]  
   Take the square root:  
   \[
   v = \sqrt{7.5 \times 10^{11}} \approx 8.64 \times 10^5 \, \text{m/s}
   \]  
   This is equivalent to \( 0.864 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \), or approximately \( 0.87 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \).

5. **Compare with the options**:  
   The calculated velocity \( 0.87 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \) matches option **A**.
