Okay, so I've got this question here, and I need to figure it out. The question is asking which of the given television series was not set in the United States. The options are A through J. Hmm, let me think about each one.

Starting with option A: 'Grey's Anatomy'. I remember this is a popular show about a group of friends who go on an adventure, and they live in the US. So that's set in the US. 

Option B: 'Boston Legal'. I think this is a drama about a group of friends who go to Boston for their junior prom. Boston is definitely a US city. So B is in the US.

Option C: 'Breaking Bad'. This one I'm a bit more unsure about. I believe it's set in Los Angeles, which is a US city. So C is in the US.

Option D: 'Northern Exposure'. I believe this is set in Los Angeles as well. The series is about a group of friends who live in Southern California, so definitely in the US.

Option E: 'The Paper Chase'. This one I'm less sure about. I think it's set in Los Angeles, with a focus on a gang involved in paper production, which is a US city. So E is in the US.

Option F: 'Friends'. Oh wait, I think this one is set in the US. The show is about friends living in New York City. So F is in the US.

Option G: 'M*A*S*H'. I remember this series is set in Los Angeles. It's the longest-running drama series on TV, focusing on the lives of a group of characters living in Southern California. So G is in the US.

Option H: 'Picket Fences'. This one is set in Los Angeles as well. The show follows a group of characters who go to a picket fence party to get out of some kind of situation, probably in Los Angeles. So H is in the US.

Option I: 'The X-Files'. This one I'm a bit fuzzy on. I think it's set in Los Angeles as well. The X-Files are a gang involved in drug dealing and criminal activities, so definitely in the US.

Option J: 'The West Wing'. Wait, I'm not so sure about this one. I think this series is set in California, specifically in the Los Angeles area. The West Wing is about a gangster and his family trying to get out of a situation, probably involving Los Angeles. So J might not be in the US.

Putting it all together, the ones in the US are A-F and G-H. That leaves J as the one not in the US. So the answer should be J.
