Okay, so I've got this question about treating Zoe's anorexia nervosa. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

First, I remember that anorexia nervosa is a type of eating disorder where people eat excessively and often interfere with daily life. The question says that the doctors are using an approach that includes putting her on IVs, changing her irrational beliefs about being too fat, and discussing her early family relationships. 

I need to figure out which theoretical approach this method fits into. The options are Behaviorist, Cognitive Behavioral, Humanistic, Psychoanalytic, Socio-cultural, Psychodynamic, Eclectic, Biological, Gestalt, or Existential.

Behaviorism focuses on observable behaviors and rewards or punishments to change behavior. So if they're using IVs and changing irrational beliefs, that's more about manipulative or psychological manipulation rather than behaviorally conditioned. So likely not Behaviorist.

Cognitive Behavioral is about changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. The doctors are changing irrational beliefs, so this fits. They're using techniques to reframe her negative thoughts, which is part of CB.

Humanistic theory emphasizes the individual's uniqueness and how they're connected to their environment. It's more about accepting and integrating the person, promoting self-actualization, and helping them find their true self. This approach would involve changing irrational beliefs and addressing family issues, which seems like the humanistic approach.

Sociocultural theory looks at how cultural factors influence behavior. The doctors are discussing family relationships, which is part of a broader cultural context. So this might fall under Sociocultural, but I'm not entirely sure.

Psychodynamic theory deals with unconscious thoughts and feelings. Changing irrational beliefs without addressing the root cause might be more psychological than dynamic. So probably not.

Gestalt theory is about combining elements into a unified whole. Here, they're addressing family and changing irrationality, which doesn't seem to fit Gestalt.

Existential theory is about free will and the search for meaning. There's no indication of seeking meaning here, so probably not.

So the options that fit are Cognitive Behavioral and Humanistic. But the question says "best classified as." Since the doctors are addressing irrational beliefs and family relationships, which are more in line with Humanistic theory, which focuses on personal connection and healing through understanding and change, the best fit is Humanistic.

The approach described aligns with the Humanistic theory, which emphasizes personal connection and healing through understanding and change. 

**Answer: C: Humanistic.**
