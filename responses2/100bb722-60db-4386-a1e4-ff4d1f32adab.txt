Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about pricing strategies. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question is asking: "Where the price is set low relative to the competition to gain market share, this strategy is known as..." with options from A to J. I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll recall what each pricing strategy means. Market share gain is achieved by setting the price low to attract customers. Let me think about each option:

Option A: Captive product pricing. That sounds like when a product is exclusive and you can't easily sell it elsewhere. Probably not related to setting a low price to get market share.

Option B: High-low pricing. This is when prices vary widely. Sometimes used in pricing strategies to test market response, but I think this is more about price ranges rather than a specific method for gaining market share quickly.

Option C: Price skimming. I remember this is a technique used by companies to test the market by setting a very low price to see how customers react. But it's more about initial sales, not necessarily gaining immediate market share by lowering prices.

Option D: Value added pricing. This involves covering the cost of production and then adding on profit. It's more about profitability than price strategy.

Option E: Penetration pricing. This is when a company sets a low price to gain market share by reducing competition. I think this fits the description because it's about undercutting competitors to get into the market.

Option F: Premium pricing. This is when the product is priced above cost, often to create urgency or exclusivity. Not related to lowering prices to gain market share.

Option G: Cost-plus pricing. This is when you set a price higher than cost, just to cover expenses. Not about lowering prices.

Option H: Economy pricing. This is when the price is set very low, often to attract buying people who might be price-sensitive. I think this is exactly what the question is asking about. It's when a company lowers the price relative to competitors to gain market share.

Option I: Psychological pricing. I'm a bit fuzzy on this one. I think this is when prices are set in a way that creates a perception of value or urgency, like in discount items. But I'm not sure if it's a strategy for market share gain by lowering prices.

Option J: Competitive pricing. This is about matching or undercutting competitors' prices, which is similar to E but phrased another way. It's about lowering prices, so it's a form of competitive pricing.

So the options that seem to fit the description are E and J. But in the context of the question, the correct term for setting a low price to gain market share is "Competitive pricing" or maybe "Economy pricing." Wait, I think "Economy pricing" refers to setting a price below cost, which is not the same as lower than competitors. Penetration pricing is about taking a market share away. So "Competitive pricing" refers to undercutting competitors, which is the scenario described in the question. Alternatively, "Economy pricing" doesn't fit because it's about covering costs, not lowering prices to gain market share.

Wait, another point: "Economy pricing" is sometimes used to mean setting a low price to attract customers, but that's not exactly the same as the strategy of undercutting competitors. Penetration pricing is when you lower prices to enter a new market, which also reduces competition. Competitive pricing, while similar, is a broad term that might encompass different strategies, including setting a low price.

So perhaps the best answer is E: Penetration pricing, but I'm a bit confused because E is about setting a low price to capture market share, which is the same as what F is, but F is about premium pricing. Wait, no, F is about premium pricing, which is a different strategy.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify:

- Penetration pricing is when you lower prices to get into the market, which is exactly what the question is describing. So the correct answer should be E: Penetration pricing.

But I'm also considering option F. Wait, F is premium pricing, which is setting a high price to create urgency or exclusivity. So F is not about lowering prices to gain market share.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The question is about a strategy where the price is set low relative to competition to gain market share. That's exactly what Penetration Pricing does. So the answer should be E. Alternatively, option J is Competitive Pricing, which is a broader term that includes Penetration Pricing.

Wait, but the options are: E is Penetration pricing, J is Competitive pricing.

So the question is looking for the strategy where the price is set low relative to competitors, which is Penetration Pricing.

So the correct answer should be E: Penetration pricing. Because Penetration Pricing is when you lower prices to capture market share, which is the same as the question's description.

The strategy where the price is set low relative to competitors to gain market share is known as Penetration Pricing, which involves lowering prices to capture market share. 

Answer: E: Penetration pricing.
