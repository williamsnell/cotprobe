Okay, so I've got this question about amino acids and their breakdown in muscle. Hmm, I remember a bit about biochemistry from my studies. Let's think this through.

The question is about deaminating branched chain amino acids. I think branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) have a side chain with a carboxylic acid group. When they're deaminated, that acid gets converted into an amino acid, right? So for example, arginine is a BCAA because it's a branched chain with an -NH2 group attached to a carboxylic acid. Wait, no, arginine's structure is a carboxylated lysine. Oh right, arginine's side chain is longer than aspartic acid's.

Wait, deaminating BCAA would break down the carboxylic acid into an amine. So for example, arginine (which is a branched-chain amino acid) would lose the carboxylic acid group to become alanine (or lysine, but deaminated would give the amine part). So arginine becomes alanine? Or wait, when BCAA is deaminated, the amino acids released are typically the non-terminal amine groups. So for arginine, which is R-NH-CH2-CO- (I think), when deaminated, it's converted into alanine, which is R-NH2. Because the R group remains.

But wait, the question says "the ammonia produced." Oh wait, no. Wait, when you deamine a BCAA, the carboxylic acid becomes an amine. So the product is the amino group.

So for arginine, which is a branched-chain amino acid, its structure is: R-NH-CH2-COOH. When deaminated, the COOH is converted to NH2, releasing CO2 or something? Or perhaps the amino group is released as an amine. So the product would be the R group attached to an amine.

Wait, but in the context of muscle, I think the breakdown involves the conversion of branched chain amino acids into their respective amino acids, releasing the amino acids as the non-ammonia parts.

So for example, arginine would become alanine. Lysine, another BCAA, would become aspartate. But wait, in muscle breakdown, I think branched chain amino acids are deaminated to their amino counterparts. So arginine and lysine would break down into alanine and aspartate, respectively.

But the options given are a bit different. Let me read the options again.

Option D says converted into alanine and glutamine. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because glutamine has an amino group as well. If the BCAA is deaminated, the R group is retained, so it would become R-amino acid. So for arginine, which is R-NH-CH2-COOH, deaminated would give R-NH2, which is alanine, and release the COOH as CO2 or something. So I think the release is the amino acid.

But wait, another point: muscle breakdown. I remember that muscle is more efficient in deaminating certain amino acids, like arginine. But in the breakdown of BCAA, the deaminated form is the amino acid with the R group and the NH2. So for muscle, the branched chain amino acids are converted into their respective amino acids. So arginine becomes alanine, lysine becomes aspartate, and so on.

Looking at the options:

Option D: converted into alanine and glutamine. Wait, that would be if the R group was lost. But I think the amino acids released are the non-ammonia parts. So for arginine, the amino group is released as alanine, and the COOH as CO2? But CO2 isn't listed as an option. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, the question is about the ammonia. Oh, wait! Ammonia is from deaminating. Wait, no. When you deaminate a BCAA, the -COOH becomes -NH2, which is an amine. So the side chain becomes an amine, but the question is about the ammonia produced, perhaps in the context of the breakdown of the amino acids in muscle.

Wait, maybe the confusion is elsewhere. Let me think again. When the BCAA is deaminated, the -COOH becomes -NH2, releasing CO2 (as a byproduct). So the non-ammonia part is the amino acid. So for arginine, R-NH-CH2-COOH → R-NH2 + CO2. So the amino group is released as an amine, and CO2 is released. So the amino acid (R-amino acid) is released.

But the question is about the ammonia. Oh wait, maybe the question is about the amino acids being converted into something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the side chain but the amino acids themselves. But the question says "the ammonia produced is mostly...", so I think that's the side chain.

Wait, but the question is which amino acid is produced when BCAA is deaminated. So the R group is attached to an amine (NH2). So for arginine, R is the same as the R in alanine. So arginine would become alanine, releasing CO2 and possibly other byproducts. Similarly, lysine becomes aspartate.

But looking at the options:

Option D: converted into alanine and glutamine. Wait, that's interesting. Because if the BCAA is deaminated, the amino group is released, but what about the R group and the C-O bonds? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the non-ammonia components. Because the amino acids themselves (like alanine) are not deaminated; their amino groups are removed. So when arginine is deaminated, the amino group is released as alanine, and the COOH is released as CO2.

But the options don't have any mention of CO2. So perhaps the question is about the amino acids that are released as products. So which amino acid is formed when a BCAA is deaminated.

Wait, another angle: muscle uses branched-chain amino acids to make amino acids. So for each BCAA, you deaminate it to get the amino acid with the R group. So arginine (R-NH-CH2-COOH) → R-NH2 + CO2. So the amino acid is the one with the R group.

So the amino acids produced are the same as the branched chain amino acids, except without the COOH group. So arginine becomes alanine, lysine becomes aspartate, etc.

Looking at the options, D says converted into alanine and glutamine. Wait, why would it be glutamine? Because if the R group is gone, then it's the same as the amino acid. So unless I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is about the breakdown of the amino acids in muscle. So for muscle, arginine is converted into alanine, which is then released. But in the options, the correct product would be alanine.

Looking at the options:

Option D says converted into alanine and glutamine. So why would both be the products? Because if the R group is gone, it's just alanine.

Option A: converted into citrulline and released. Wait, citrulline is a nitrogen-containing compound. I'm not sure about that.

Option B: urea. Yep, I think that's more about breakdown of amino acids, like when amino acids are deaminated to ammonia and other byproducts, leading to urea. But that's a bit different.

Option C: synthesise purines and pyrimidines. That's for DNA synthesis, not muscle. So probably not.

Option D: converted into alanine and glutamine. Wait, but if BCAA is deaminated into alanine, then why would glutamine be formed? Unless perhaps another step is involved. Or perhaps the question is about the non-ammonia components.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. When BCAA is deaminated, the amino group is released as an amine, but the R group is retained. So the amino acid is R-amino acid. So for arginine, the R is the same as alanine. So the product is alanine.

So the option that says "converted into alanine and glutamine" would not be correct, since the R group is retained, not the amine. Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is about the breakdown of the amino acids themselves. For example, if a BCAA is deaminated, the amino group is released, so the amino acid is the same as the BCAA without the COOH. So arginine becomes alanine. But the question is about the byproduct. So maybe the options are about the products, and the correct answer is D, which says converted into alanine and glutamine. Alternatively, maybe the correct product is alanine, not glutamine.

Wait, so option D mentions both alanine and glutamine. What's the point of that? Because if you deaminate BCAA to get the amino acid, the result should be the same as the BCAA without the COOH, so arginine becomes alanine. So the amino acid is just alanine, so only that product is formed. So option D is not correct because it's saying two products.

Wait, maybe the question is about the side chain. So if BCAA is deaminated, the -COOH becomes -NH2. So the product is R-amino acid (like alanine) and CO2 or H2O (if it's a ketone). But the question is about the ammonia. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the amino acids that are produced, which would be the amino acids with the R group, so option D, but why are two products mentioned?

Wait, another approach: think about the options. The correct answer is that the amino group is released as an amine. So the body releases the amino acid. So for arginine, it would be alanine. So the amino acid is converted into alanine. But looking at the options, which option corresponds.

Looking at the options:

Option D says converted into alanine and glutamine. Well, that can't be right because if the BCAA is deaminated, the R group is retained. So the amino acid is just the R group attached to NH2. So the product is the amino acid, which is alanine in this case.

Option D mentions both alanine and glutamine. What's glutamine? Glutamine has a -NH2 group attached to an amine. So if the BCAA is deaminated, the amino group is released as an amine (like alanine), but the R group is retained as part of the amino acid. So maybe the correct product is the amino acid (R-amino acid), not glutamine.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the process again. When a BCAA is deaminated, the COOH group is converted to NH2, releasing CO2 or H2O. So the amino group is lost as NH2, and the R group remains attached to the amino acid's NH2. So the product is the amino acid with the R group, which is the same as the BCAA without the COOH. So arginine becomes alanine, lysine becomes aspartate, etc.

So the correct products would be the amino acid (R-amino acid) and the CO2 or H2O. But the question is about the ammonia produced. Ammonia is NH3, which isn't formed in that step. So perhaps the question is about the R group.

Wait, but the question is about the ammonia, which is a byproduct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the correct answer is D: converted into alanine and glutamine.

Wait, why would glutamine be formed? Because when you deaminate a BCAA, you get the amino acid, which is the same as the BCAA without the COOH. So arginine would become alanine. So the correct option wouldn't include glutamine. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but that's a conflicting thought.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the amino acid being converted into something else, such as glutamine. Or maybe I'm missing the structure.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is D because the amino acids (R-amino acids) are generally found in the form of various amino acids, including arginine. But in muscle, perhaps arginine is converted into alanine. So the correct answer would be D, but that's confusing because the amino acid is R-amino acid, which isn't exactly alanine if the R changes.

Wait, maybe I should look for the correct breakdown. So when a branched chain amino acid is deaminated, the -COOH becomes -NH2, releasing CO2. For example, arginine becomes alanine, which is one of the amino acids in muscle. So the product is alanine. So which option matches that?

Option D: converted into alanine and glutamine. Wait, but arginine becomes alanine, so the product is only alanine, not glutamine. So option D is not correct. But perhaps the question is mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the conversion of the amino acids into their respective amino acids, which are then released. So the correct answer is D, but perhaps the reasoning is that the amino acids are converted into the amino acid without the COOH, which is the same as the BCAA without the COOH.

Wait, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I'm wrong, and the correct option is D.

Alternatively, another approach: muscle uses branched chain amino acids to make amino acids. So the breakdown of BCAA would produce the amino acid. So the amino acid formed is the R-amino acid.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes R-amino acids is D, which includes both alanine and glutamine. But if the main product is the amino acid (R-amino acid), then maybe D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the amino acids are converted into their respective amino acid (like alanine) and the remaining R group is another amino acid. Wait, no, the R group is part of the amino acid. So perhaps the correct answer is D because arginine becomes alanine, and the side chain is CO2, which is released as CO2. So the products are alanine and CO2.

But looking at the options, option D says "converted into alanine and glutamine." So that would be incorrect.

Wait, but maybe the question is different. Oh! Wait, if the BCAA is deaminated, the R group is retained as an amino acid. So for example, arginine is R-NH-CH2-COOH. After deamination, R-NH2 (which is alanine) and the COOH is released as CO2. So the amino acid (R-amino acid) is alanine.

So the correct product would be alanine. But looking at the options:

Option D says converted into alanine and glutamine. So that's not correct. Option A: converted into citrulline, which is a nitrogen-containing compound. I don't think that's correct.

Option B: urea. Urea is a byproduct of amino acid breakdown, especially when amino acids are deaminate to ammonia.

Wait, but if the amino acids are converted into their respective amino acids, which are the same as the BCAA's without COOH, then the correct answer is D, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the amino acid's R group. For example, the arginine would become alanine, which is option A and D, but wait, option D says both. So perhaps the correct answer is D because the R group is converted into alanine and the COOH is converted into CO2.

But the question is about the ammonia produced. Ammonia isn't produced in that step. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is D because the amino acids (R-amino acids) are generally found in the form of various amino acids, including arginine. But in muscle, perhaps arginine is converted into alanine. So the correct answer would be D, but that's confusing because the amino acid is R-amino acid, which isn't exactly alanine if the R changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the conversion of the amino acids into their respective amino acids. So if BCAA is deaminated, the R group is retained, and the COOH is released as CO2. So the amino acid is R-amino acid, which is alanine in the case of arginine.

So the correct answer would be D, but perhaps that's a trick. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because the amino acids are converted into their respective amino acids and the rest is released as CO2. So the amino acid is the amino acid without the COOH group.

Wait, but the options don't list that. So I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is D because the amino acid is converted into alanine and the R group is converted into aspartate or similar, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because the amino acid is converted into the amino acid and the rest is released as CO2. So the correct option is D. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: muscle deaminates branched chain amino acids to their respective amino acids. So arginine → alanine, lysine → aspartate, etc. So the correct answer would be D if it includes alanine and something else, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the side chain is converted into a different amino acid.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D because the amino acid is converted into alanine and the R group is converted into another amino acid. But I don't think that's how it works.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because the amino acids are converted into their respective amino acids, which are the amino acids without the COOH group. So the correct product is the amino acid, whether it's alanine, aspartate, etc.

But given the options, I think the correct answer is D. Because the question is about the amino acids being converted, and the only option that includes the R group as a product is D. Wait, but how? Because the R group is part of the amino acid, not the amino acid itself.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is D. Because when a BCAA is deaminated, the R group is retained, so the amino acid is the same as the BCAA without the COOH group. For example, arginine becomes alanine, lysine becomes aspartate, etc. So the amino acid is the same as the BCAA without the COOH group.

Looking at the options again, option D says converted into alanine and glutamine. Wait, that can't be right because if the R group is gone, the amino acid is just the R group without the COOH. So perhaps I'm missing the point.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because the amino acids are converted into the amino acids without the COOH group, which are the amino acids that are available for muscle. So the right answer is D.

When branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are deaminated, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into an amine (-NH2), releasing CO2 or H2O as byproducts. The R group remains attached to the amine, forming the respective amino acid. For example, arginine (R-NH-CH2-COOH) becomes alanine (R-NH2), and lysine (R-NH-CH2-COOH) becomes aspartate (R-NH2). 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Converted into citrulline and released CO2. This is incorrect because citrulline is a nitrogen-containing compound, not relevant to the deamination of BCAAs.
- **Option B**: Converted into urea. This is incorrect because urea is formed during the deamination of amino acids, not relevant to BCAAs.
- **Option C**: Synthesis of purines and pyrimidine. This is incorrect because purines and pyrimidines are involved in DNA synthesis, not relevant to muscle deamination.
- **Option D**: Converted into alanine and glutamine. This is problematic because alanine is the product of arginine's deamination, not glutamine. However, if the question is interpreted as the deamination of BCAAs producing the amino acid with the R group (e.g., arginine → alanine), then this option could be considered correct. Glutamine is the product of glutamic acid deamination, not relevant to BCAAs.

Given the confusion surrounding the R group and the options, the most plausible interpretation is that the question refers to the deamination of BCAAs producing the amino acid with the R group. Thus, **Option D** aligns with this interpretation, even though it incorrectly attributes glutamine as the product.
