Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about the stability of oxidation states for group 13 elements. It asks which element has a +1 oxidation state that's more stable than the +3 state. The options are from A to J, each a different element.

Hmm, group 13 elements include things like Boron (B), Aluminum (Al), Gallium (Ga), Indium (In), and Tin (Sn, which isn't in the options). Wait, actually, looking at the options, I see Ga, In, As, etc. So I need to consider these.

I remember that in group 13, the elements are typically less reactive than group 14, but their reactivity varies. The oxidation states can vary a lot. For example, boron can have +3, +5, etc. Aluminum has a common +3 oxidation state, but I think it can also have +1. Gallium, I think, can have +3, +4, and +5. Indium can have +3, +4, +5, +6. Tin has +4 and +2.

Wait, but the question is about +1 being more stable than +3. So for each element, which is more stable to have a higher oxidation state. Stability usually refers to the tendency to gain or lose electrons to form more stable structures.

I remember that for group 13 elements, the +1 oxidation state is more common because they are less noble. For example, boron has a +3 oxidation state, but also +1. Aluminum tends to lose two electrons, so it might prefer a lower oxidation state. Gallium can have a +1, +3, and +5. Indium can have +3, +4, etc.

Wait, I think that in terms of stability, the +1 state is more common and more stable because they need to gain electrons to reach a noble gas configuration. Let me think about the periodic table. The higher the positive oxidation state, the more likely it is to be unstable because they tend to lose electrons (gain more positive charge). For group 13, the +3 state is more common but not as stable. The +1 state is more stable because they gain electrons (lose a negative charge) more readily.

So which of these options has a +1 oxidation state more stable than +3? Let's look at the options:

A: Al â†’ I think Al can have +3, but maybe not +1 as much. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, Ga and In have +1 states.

Wait, for group 13 elements, Al tends to have a +3 oxidation state. Gallium (Ga) commonly has +3, +4, and +5. Indium (In) has +3, +4, +5, +6. Tin (Sn) has +4 and +2.

Wait, but for the question, which element's +1 state is more stable than +3. So for each element, the stability of +1 is higher than +3.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: Al. Aluminum has a +3 common oxidation state, but does it have a +1? I think it's more common to have +3 than +1. Also, I think Al tends to lose electrons, so a +1 state is less stable than +3.

Option B: Tl. Tl is tellurium, group 16. It's a post-transition metal. I don't think it has +1 or +3 oxidation states as much because it's less common. Or wait, I'm pretty sure it's more common in +4 and +6 oxidation states. So +1 is not a common state, so maybe not the case here. So option B is probably not the answer.

Option C: C. Carbon is group 14, but group 13 elements are on the left. So C is group 14. So we're focusing on group 13 elements among the options. So C is not in the options we're considering.

Option D: B. Boron. Boron has +3 as a common state. Also, I think it can have +1. So is +1 more stable than +3 for boron? I'm not sure. Let me think. Boron's valency is typically +3, but sometimes oxidation states like +1 are possible. But does it prefer +1 over +3? Well, in some compounds, boron can have +1, but maybe +3 is more common and more stable.

Option E: Si. Silicon is group 14. It can have +4, +3, +2. So Si's common oxidation states are +4 and +2. It doesn't have a +1 as a common state. So this option isn't relevant.

Option F: P. Phosphorus, group 15. It can have +5, +3, +2. So +1 isn't a common oxidation state. So this can't be the answer.

Option G: N. Nitrogen group 15. Its oxidation states include +3, +5. So N doesn't have a +1 as a common state.

Option H: Ga. Gallium. Gallium is group 13. I think Ga can have +1, +3, and +5. But is +1 more stable than +3? Because Ga tends to lose electrons, it's more stable in lower oxidation states. So Ga's +1 state is more stable than +3.

Option I: In. Indium. I think In can have multiple oxidation states. It has +3, +4, +5, +6. So I'm not sure. But if it's more stable in +3, then this wouldn't be the answer.

Option J: As. Arsenic. Group 15. Can have +3, +4. So no +1 as a common state.

Wait, so the options are A to J, and only Al, Ga, In have +1 as a possibility. But wait, the options are only from A to J, and the question is about group 13 elements as per the options.

Wait, the question lists options A through J, each a different element, but I've only considered group 13 elements. So the elements in the options are A: Al (group 13), H: Ga (group 13), I: In (group 13). Others are from other groups.

So the question is, which of these group 13 elements has a +1 oxidation state more stable than +3.

So for each group 13 element in the options, which one has a +1 more stable than +3?

Let me think about the stability of these oxidation states.

Aluminum (Al) can have +3 as a common state. For example, Al3+ is a stable ion. But I think Al tends to lose electrons, so a +1 state is less stable than +3.

Gallium (Ga) can have +1, +3, +5. I think that Ga tends to lose electrons, so Ga in +1 is more stable. Because Ga tends to have lower oxidation states.

Indium (In) can have +3, +4, +5, +6. So In's +3 is more common, but I'm not certain about the stability of +1. Wait, but Ga and In both can have +1.

Wait, but the question is about which element's +1 is more stable than +3. So, which of these elements has +1 more stable than +3?

I think Ga's +1 is more stable than +3. Because Ga tends to lose electrons, so a lower oxidation state is more stable.

So, looking at the options, the group 13 elements are A (Al), H (Ga), I (In). So the right answer should be Ga (option H).

Wait, but let me think about each element's behavior.

Aluminum: Usually forms Al^3+ which is stable. But Al can also form Al^- if it loses electrons, but that's less common. So +1 is less stable than +3.

Gallium: Can have a +1 state, but it's more stable in that state because it tends to lose electrons. So Ga's +1 is more stable than Ga's +3.

Indium: Can have +3 and others, but I'm not sure if +1 is more stable than +3.

So the correct answer would be Ga (option H).

To determine which group 13 element has a +1 oxidation state more stable than a +3 oxidation state, we analyze the stability of these oxidation states across the options provided. Group 13 elements include boron (B), aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), indium (In), and others. 

- **Aluminum (Al)**: Typically forms a +3 oxidation state, which is common and stable. However, aluminum also has a +1 oxidation state, but this is less stable than +3 due to aluminum's tendency to lose electrons.
- **Gallium (Ga)**: Gallium can have oxidation states of +1, +3, and +5. It is known to prefer lower oxidation states, making the +1 oxidation state more stable than the +3 oxidation state.
- **Indium (In)**: Indium can have oxidation states of +3, +4, +5, and +6. While it can have a +1 oxidation state, it is less stable than +3, as it tends to lose electrons.
- **Other options (e.g., silicon, phosphorus, nitrogen, arsenic)**: These elements do not have a common +1 oxidation state or do not exhibit a clear dominance of +1 over +3.

Given this analysis, **gallium (Ga)** is the only group 13 element among the options where the +1 oxidation state is more stable than the +3 oxidation state due to its tendency to lose electrons.
