Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Nathanson's retributive theories. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which option is NOT required by Nathanson's retributive proposal that he favors. The options are A to D. Let me recall what I know about retributivism.

From what I remember, Nathanson's approach is a type of retributive philosophy. Reputative theories often focus on the criminal justice system, whereas retributive theories try to impose the criminal penalties upon the guilty party. Nathanson's specific form is known as 'pro secution' retribution, which emphasizes the role of the prosecution in the trial process.

So, according to retributive theories, the prosecution is supposed to be the one responsible for determining the punishment. Nathanson's theory suggests that the prosecution's actions should be protected and that the punishment should be commuted or recast based on the evidence presented during the trial. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact requirements.

Looking at the options:

A: a list of crimes ranked according to their seriousness. I think Nathanson would require a hierarchy of crimes, where each level is a crime that can be punished. So, higher severity crimes would require higher punishment. That makes sense because if the crimes are ordered by severity, the punishment should reflect that.

B: a scale of punishments that correspond to the seriousness of certain crimes. This sounds similar to option A. If the punishment scale is determined by the severity of the crime, then this would likely be a requirement. So, B is probably a correct requirement.

C: treating criminals humanely. Hmm. I'm not sure about this. Does Nathanson require humanely treating criminals? I think that in some retributive theories, the focus is on the criminal justice system, not human treatment. So, if this is Nathanson's specific approach, perhaps the treatment is more about the trial process rather than humanizing criminals. So, C might not be a requirement.

D: the death penalty for the most serious crimes. I'm not certain about this one. I think Nathanson's approach might involve commutation or recasting the punishment beyond the death penalty, but I don't know if the death penalty is required for the most serious crimes. Or maybe the death penalty is not part of his model.

Wait, the question says which is NOT required. So, let's think again.

Nathanson's approach emphasizes the role of the prosecution. He argues that the trial process should be protected, and that punishment should be based on the evidence presented. So, what are the main points?

In his theory, the requirement would be that the severity of the crime determines the level of punishment. So, higher severity crimes require more severe punishments. That would suggest A and B are required.

But does the theory require treating criminals humanely? I think humanely refers to the treatment of the criminal, like in the criminal justice system. If Nathanson's approach doesn't require humanely treating the criminals, then C might not be a requirement.

Also, about the death penalty for the most serious crimes. If Nathanson's theory doesn't require that, then D might not be a requirement. Alternatively, maybe he does require it.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall. I think Nathanson's approach might not require the death penalty for all crimes. Or perhaps it does require it for the most severe. Hmm.

Wait, in his theory, the idea is to treat the guilty person and the system according to the evidence. So, perhaps the death penalty is not a requirement because it's the punishment that's based on the evidence, not the crime's severity. So, if D says the death penalty is for the most serious crimes, maybe D is not required.

Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. The options are about what is NOT required.

Option C: treating criminals humanely. From what I remember, retributive theories often focus on the criminal justice system, not human treatment. So, perhaps C is not a requirement in Nathanson's approach. Alternatively, perhaps he does require human treatment, but I'm not sure.

Option D: the death penalty for the most serious crimes. I think Nathanson's theory does not require the death penalty for all crimes. He might require commutations beyond death penalty. But does he require it for the most serious? Or is that just a matter of punishment beyond the death penalty? I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps he does not require it for the most serious.

Wait, another approach: Nathanson's retributive philosophy is about the idea that the system (the prosecution) should be protected, and that the punishment should be based on the evidence. So, the level of punishment is determined by the level of crime and the evidence presented.

In this context, does he require treating criminals humanely? I think he does, because the criminal is treated according to the evidence, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps he doesn't require it because human treatment is the focus of the criminal justice system, and retributive theories might not touch on that. Or maybe he does require it because the treatment of the criminal is part of the system.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the other options. Option C is about treating criminals humanely. So, if the theory doesn't require human treatment, then C is correct because it's not a requirement.

Option D says the death penalty for the most serious crimes. If Nathanson's approach doesn't require it, then D is not a requirement. Or, maybe he does require it for the most serious.

Wait, I think I need to recall specific points. From my notes, I remember that Nathanson's approach requires a hierarchy of crimes, so A and B are correct. He requires a list of crimes ranked by severity, and a scale of punishment corresponding to each. So, C might not be required because human treatment is part of the system, not a retributive requirement.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT a requirement. So, the incorrect option is the one that's not required.

If C is not required, then the answer is C.

Alternatively, if C is required, then the answer is not C.

But I'm not sure. The key is whether the treatment of criminals by the system is a requirement of Nathanson's theory.

Alternatively, perhaps Nathanson's theory does not require human treatment because human treatment is part of the criminal justice system, and the retributive approach is more about the system's protection.

So, the question is which is NOT a requirement. The options are:

A: a list of crimes sorted by severity.

B: a scale of punishment according to severity.

C: treating criminals humanely.

D: death penalty for the most serious.

If C is not a requirement, then the answer would be C.

Alternatively, perhaps Nathanson's theory does require human treatment, so C is a requirement and the answer is not C.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach: what do I know about the other options.

Option C: treating criminals humanely. I think in some retributive theories, human treatment is not required. So, perhaps in Nathanson's approach, human treatment is not a requirement.

So, the answer would be C.

To determine which option is NOT required by Nathanson's retributive theory, we analyze each choice:

- **Option A**: A list of crimes ranked according to their seriousness is a requirement because Nathanson emphasizes a hierarchy of crimes, determining the severity of punishment. This aligns with his approach.

- **Option B**: A scale of punishments corresponding to the seriousness of certain crimes is also required, as it reflects the severity of the crime and the corresponding punishment level.

- **Option C**: Treating criminals humanely is not a requirement. Nathanson's theory focuses on the criminal justice system and the protection of the system itself, not on human treatment.

- **Option D**: The death penalty for the most serious crimes is not necessarily required. Nathanson's approach may go beyond the death penalty, focusing on more severe punishments based on evidence.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is **C**, as treating criminals humanely is not a requirement of Nathanson's retributive theory.
