Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the objectives of a technology education program. The goal is to enable students to develop creative technical solutions to present and future societal problems. Hmm, I need to figure out which of these options fits best.

Let me read through the options again.

Option A: List different types of machinery used in construction. That seems more about practical tools than creativity. It's more about mechanics than problem-solving.

Option B: Categorize the components of a technical system. This sounds like it's about understanding systems, maybe how they work. It's more about structure than creativity.

Option C: Create a poster detailing building a bridge. Oh, this sounds like a creative project. They're creating something visually, which could involve technical aspects. But is it the most appropriate?

Option D: Design and construct a 3D model of a low-income dwelling unit. Designing a model would involve technical aspects, and constructing it would involve building skills. This seems like a good mix of creativity and technical skills.

Option E: Explain architectural design principles. That's about theory, not creating solutions. Not the most creative.

Option F: Identify tools for highway construction. Again, practical tools, not creative problem-solving.

Option G: Memorize software names. Doesn't relate to problem-solving or creativity.

Option H: Write an essay on technology history. More about the history, not solving societal problems.

Option I: Describe construction careers. More about job roles, not creative technical solutions.

Option J: Discuss environmental impact of deforestation. Again, environmental issue, not directly related to problem-solving.

So looking at the options, C and D seem relevant. Option C is about creating a poster, which is a project that involves design and technical aspects, but it's more of an application than a creative solution-making. Option D is about designing and building, which directly ties into solving societal problems by creating a model that represents a solution.

Wait, but the question is about developing creative technical solutions. So a program that focuses on creating something, like a model or a poster, could be part of a broader education that includes both design and building. However, the most direct approach would be for students to design and build something, which would meet the objective of creating a solution.

Option D is about designing and constructing, which is exactly what the question is asking about. It's about developing a technical solution through design and construction. So I think D is the best answer.

The most appropriate objective for a technology education program aimed at developing creative technical solutions is to design and construct a 3D model. This option directly involves both creativity and technical skills, aligning with the goal of solving societal problems.

Answer: D
