Question:

Why do the Treasury and the FED usually attempt to lower the long-term rates of interest, and simultaneously to raise the short-term rates?

Options:

A: Lowering both long-term and short-term rates promotes borrowing and reduces savings
B: Raising both long-term and short-term rates controls inflation and reduces public spending
C: Raising short-term rates encourages domestic investment, while lowering long-term rates leads to economic overheating
D: Interest rates have no effect on economy or foreign investment
E: Lowering long-term rates increases the money supply, while raising short-term rates prevents economic bubbles
F: Raising long-term rates discourages domestic economy
G: Lowering short-term rates stimulates exports, while raising long-term rates stabilizes the currency
H: Lowering long-term interest rates stimulates domestic economy and raising short-term rates encourages foreign investment
I: Lowering long-term rates discourages savings, while raising short-term rates increases inflation
J: Lowering short-term rates discourages foreign investment

Okay, so I've got this question about the Federal Reserve and the Treasury trying to adjust interest rates, and I'm supposed to choose the correct reason why they do that. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that both the Treasury and the Fed usually lower long-term rates and raise short-term rates. The options are A to J, each giving a different explanation. I remember that interest rates affect borrowing and investment, and how that impacts the economy.

So, I think about the process of monetary policy. Lowering long-term rates usually means the Fed is making long-term bonds cheaper, which should encourage more investment in long-term projects, like infrastructure or government projects. This would stimulate the economy, right? Because businesses and consumers might invest more, leading to higher demand and possibly lower prices, promoting growth.

On the flip side, short-term rates being higher could discourage saving, because people might prefer to hold onto their money longer. If they save longer, they have more time to earn interest, which would make savings less attractive. So, lower short-term rates encourage saving because it's more attractive for people to hold onto their money.

Wait, let me connect this with the options. Option H says lowering long-term rates stimulate the economy, raising short-term raises inflation. So that makes sense. When you lower long-term rates, the economy gets more active, leading to higher demand. But if short-term rates are high, people save more, which can cause inflation because extra money in the hands of store-bought goods and services leads to more prices.

So looking at the options, I'm looking for something that ties these two actions together. Option H seems to state both effects, which aligns with what I was thinking. The other options don't seem to tie the two actions together as effectively. For example, option E talks about money supply increases and economic bubbles, but that's more about the overall money supply and perhaps why the economy might overheast. But the question is about the rate changes trying to do both things.

Option H's explanation is that lowering long-term stimulate the economy, raising short-term raises inflation. So I think that's correct.

To determine why the Treasury and the FED lower long-term rates and raise short-term rates, let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Lowering rates usually stimulates borrowing, not reduces savings.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Raising rates doesn't control inflation or public spending; it affects spending patterns.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Raising short-term rates might encourage investment, not necessarily encourage domestic investment.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Interest rates do affect the economy and foreign investment.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. While the money supply can increase, it's not specifically why short-term rates are raised.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Raising long-term rates typically discourages domestic economies.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Lowering short-term rates can stimulate exports, not necessarily stabilize the currency.
- **Option H**: Correct. Lowering long-term rates stimulate the economy, while raising short-term rates raise inflation.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Lowering rates doesn't discourage savings; it may lead to higher savings.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Lowering short-term rates usually discourages saving, not foreign investment.

The correct explanation is provided by **Option H**, which states that lowering long-term rates stimulate the economy, and raising short-term rates raise inflation.

**Answer: H**
