Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about autosomal recessive disorders and the probability of children being affected. Hmm, let me think through this. 

So the question says, if both parents are affected with the same autosomal recessive disorder, what's the probability that each of their children will be affected? The options are A to J. I remember that autosomal recessive means the disease is on an autosome, not on the sex chromosomes, which are different. 

Wait, right, when both parents are carriers, they can pass on the recessive allele to their children. Oh, wait, but if both parents are affected, that's a different case. In that case, they must both have at least one recessive allele, I think. Because an affected person has the recessive genotype.

So let's break it down. If a parent has an autosomal recessive disorder, they must have two copies of the recessive allele, right? Like, they must be homozygous recessive, because if they had one recessive and one dominant, they'd show the dominant trait. So if both parents are affected, they must be homozygous for the recessive allele. So their genotype is aa, where 'a' is the dominant normal allele.

Now, each parent can only pass on the 'a' allele to their children because they can't pass on the 'A' allele. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, the parents are both aa, right? Because they're affected. Oh, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the parents themselves are affected, so their genotype must be aa. Because aa is the only genotype that would display the recessive disease.

So, each of them can only pass on the 'a' allele. Because if a parent is aa, they can't pass on an 'A' allele. So when they have a child, the child has a 50% chance of getting the 'a' from each parent. So the child's genotype is 'aa' (which is affected) or 'Aa' (which is not). Wait, but wait, no. Wait, each parent passes one allele. Both parents are aa, so they each give 'a' to their children. Oh wait, no. Wait, each parent can only pass 'a' to their children because they are aa. Because the parents are aa, their gametes will all be 'a'. So when they have a child, the child will receive one allele from each parent. So the only possible genotype is 'aa'. Because each parent gives 'a', so child is aa.

Wait, but wait a second. If both parents are aa, then all their children will be aa, right? Because each parent only gives 'a' to their kids. So all the children will have aa, which is the recessive phenotype. So that's a 100% chance of being affected. But wait, that can't be right because in the options, F is 1, which would be 100% chance. But let me think again.

Wait, no, wait. Oh no, wait. Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me re-examine. If both parents are affected (aa), then each parent can only pass the 'a' allele to their children. So the child must get 'a' from each parent, making their genotype 'aa'. So all children are affected. So the probability is 1, which is option F.

But wait, the options include F: 1, which suggests that the probability is 100%. But that doesn't make sense because in reality, if both parents are carriers, the chance is 25% each child would be affected. But in this question, both parents are affected, which is a certainty. So the probability is 100% that the child is affected. So the answer should be F: 1 in 1, or 1.

Wait, but wait, another perspective. Let me think about the possible scenarios. If both parents are aa, the children have only one possibility: aa. So, all children are aa, so all affected. So the probability is 1, which is option F.

Hmm. So the correct answer is F: 1.
</think>

If both parents are affected with an autosomal recessive disorder, their genotype is homozygous recessive (aa). Since they can only pass on the recessive allele ('a') to their children, all children will inherit two 'a' alleles and thus be affected. This results in a 100% probability that each child will be affected. 

Answer: F: 1 in 1.
