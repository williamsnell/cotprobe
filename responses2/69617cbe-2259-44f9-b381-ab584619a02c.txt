Okay, I've got this calculus problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about finding the value of c such that the limit as x approaches 1 of (1/(x - 1) - c/(x³ - 1)) exists. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one. 

First, I remember that when dealing with limits, especially when there's a potential for a discontinuity or an indeterminate form like 0/0, it's often useful to factor and simplify the expression. Maybe I can combine the two fractions into one and see what happens as x approaches 1.

Let me write out the expression again: 1/(x - 1) minus c/(x³ - 1). I notice that the denominators are x - 1 and x³ - 1. Hmm, x³ - 1 looks like a difference of cubes, so maybe I can factor that. The formula for a difference of cubes is a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²). So applying that here, x³ - 1 is (x - 1)(x² + x + 1). Oh, so the denominator x³ - 1 factors into (x - 1)(x² + x + 1).

So, the expression becomes 1/(x - 1) - c/[(x - 1)(x² + x + 1)]. To combine these two fractions, I'll need a common denominator. The denominators are (x - 1) and (x - 1)(x² + x + 1), so the common denominator would be (x - 1)(x² + x + 1). 

Let me adjust the first term to have this common denominator. The first term is 1/(x - 1), which can be rewritten as (x² + x + 1)/[(x - 1)(x² + x + 1)]. Because I'm multiplying numerator and denominator by (x² + x + 1), which is the other factor needed to get the common denominator.

So now, the expression is [ (x² + x + 1) - c ] / [(x - 1)(x² + x + 1) ].

So, the numerator is (x² + x + 1 - c), and the denominator is (x - 1)(x² + x + 1). Now, I need to evaluate the limit as x approaches 1.

Let me substitute x = 1 into the numerator and denominator. If x approaches 1, the denominator becomes (1 - 1)(something), which is 0. The numerator becomes (1² + 1 + 1 - c) which is (1 + 1 + 1 - c) = 3 - c. So the expression becomes (3 - c)/0 as x approaches 1.

Wait, but for the limit to exist, the numerator and denominator must both approach 0 or both approach infinity, but in this case, the denominator approaches 0, and the numerator approaches 3 - c. For the limit to exist, we must have the numerator also approaching 0 so that the overall fraction doesn't blow up to infinity. Otherwise, the limit would be either infinity or negative infinity, which doesn't exist as a finite value.

So, to have the numerator approach 0 as x approaches 1, we set 3 - c = 0. Solving for c gives c = 3. 

Let me double-check that. If c is 3, then the numerator becomes 3 - 3 = 0, so the expression is 0/0 when x approaches 1. But that's an indeterminate form, which means I can apply L’Hôpital’s Rule. Or perhaps factor further.

Wait, another approach: maybe I can factor the numerator x² + x + 1 - c. If c is 3, the numerator becomes x² + x + 1 - 3 = x² + x - 2. Let me factor that: x² + x - 2. The discriminant is 1 + 8 = 9, so the roots are (-1 ± 3)/2. So (2)/2 = 1 and (-4)/2 = -2. Therefore, x² + x - 2 factors as (x - 1)(x + 2). 

So the numerator becomes (x - 1)(x + 2). The denominator is (x - 1)(x² + x + 1). So when x approaches 1, the (x -1) terms cancel out, leaving (x + 2)/(x² + x + 1). Now, substituting x = 1 gives (1 + 2)/(1 + 1 + 1) = 3/3 = 1. So the limit is 1, which exists. 

So yes, c = 3 makes the limit exist and equal to 1. Therefore, the correct answer is J (which is option J: 3).

The problem requires finding the value of c such that the limit as x approaches 1 of (1/(x - 1) - c/(x³ - 1)) exists. 

1. Factor the denominator x³ - 1 as (x - 1)(x² + x + 1).
2. Combine the fractions: [1/(x - 1) - c/((x - 1)(x² + x + 1))] = [(x² + x + 1 - c)] / [(x - 1)(x² + x + 1)].
3. For the limit to exist, the numerator must approach 0 as x approaches 1, implying 3 - c = 0 → c = 3.
