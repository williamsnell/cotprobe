Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the limit of g(x)/x as x approaches infinity. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, the function g(x) is defined as the limit as r approaches 0 of [(x + 1)^{r + 1} - x^{r + 1}]^{1/r}. I need to figure out what this limit is for every positive real number x, and then take the limit of g(x)/x as x goes to infinity.

Alright, let's focus on g(x) first. Since r is approaching 0, maybe I can use some approximations or expansions for small r. For small r, (x + 1)^{r + 1} can be expanded using the binomial theorem or a Taylor series. Similarly, x^{r + 1} can be expanded.

Let me write out the expansions:

(x + 1)^{r + 1} = (x + 1) * (x + 1)^r
Similarly, x^{r + 1} = x * x^r

So, the expression inside the limit becomes:
[(x + 1)(x + 1)^r - x x^r]^{1/r}

Hmm. Maybe I can factor out x terms. Let's see:

= [(x + 1)(x^r + r x^{r - 1} + ...) - x x^r]^{1/r}
Wait, maybe I should consider the expansion for (x + 1)^r and x^r. Since r is small, (x + 1)^r ≈ x^r + r x^{r - 1} + (r(r - 1)/2) x^{r - 2} + ... Similarly, x^r is just x^r. So,

(x + 1)^r ≈ x^r + r x^{r - 1}
x^r is just x^r.

Wait, but since r is approaching 0, maybe I can write these exponentials in terms of e^r. Because for small r, (1 + 1/x)^r ≈ e^{r/x} ≈ 1 + r/x + (r^2)/(2x^2) + ..., but here the exponent is (x + 1), so perhaps it's different.

Wait, perhaps I should write (x + 1)^{r + 1} as (x + 1) * (x + 1)^r. So, it's (x + 1) multiplied by (x + 1)^r.

Similarly, x^{r + 1} = x * x^r.

So the expression inside the limit is:

[(x + 1)(x + 1)^r - x x^r]^{1/r}

Let me factor out x^r from both terms in the numerator:

= [(x + 1) (x^r (1 + 1/x)^r) - x x^r]^{1/r}
= [ (x + 1) x^r (1 + 1/x)^r - x x^r ]^{1/r}
= [ x^r ( (x + 1)(1 + 1/x)^r - x ) ]^{1/r}

Factor out x^r inside the brackets:

= [ x^r ( (x + 1)(1 + 1/x)^r - x ) ]^{1/r}
= (x^r)^{1/r} * [ (x + 1)(1 + 1/x)^r - x ]^{1/r}
= x * [ (x + 1)(1 + 1/x)^r - x ]^{1/r}

So now, g(x) is the limit as r approaches 0 of x times [ (x + 1)(1 + 1/x)^r - x ]^{1/r}.

Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:

Let’s denote A = (x + 1)(1 + 1/x)^r - x

We can write this as:

A = (x + 1) * (1 + 1/x)^r - x

Let me factor x from the first term:

= x(1 + 1/x) * (1 + 1/x)^r - x
= x(1 + 1/x) * (1 + 1/x)^r - x
= x(1 + 1/x) * (1 + 1/x)^r - x

Wait, let me compute (1 + 1/x)^r first. For small r, (1 + 1/x)^r ≈ e^{r/x} ≈ 1 + r/x + (r^2)/(2x^2) + ... So, (1 + 1/x)^r ≈ 1 + r/x.

Wait, but maybe it's more precise to consider the expansion more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write (1 + 1/x)^r = e^{r ln(1 + 1/x)} ≈ 1 + r ln(1 + 1/x) + [r^2 (ln(1 + 1/x))^2]/2 + ...

But for small r, this might be manageable.

But wait, perhaps an alternative approach. Let's note that as r approaches 0, the term (1 + 1/x)^r can be approximated as 1 + (ln(1 + 1/x)) r + higher-order terms.

So let's approximate (1 + 1/x)^r ≈ 1 + r ln(1 + 1/x) + r^2 (ln(1 + 1/x))^2 / 2 + ...

But since r is approaching 0, maybe we can approximate (1 + 1/x)^r ≈ 1 + r ln(1 + 1/x).

So, let's plug that into the expression for A:

A = (x + 1) [1 + r ln(1 + 1/x)] - x

Expanding:

= (x + 1) + (x + 1) r ln(1 + 1/x) - x
= 1 + (x + 1) r ln(1 + 1/x)

Hmm, so A ≈ 1 + (x + 1) r ln(1 + 1/x)

Wait, but perhaps a better approximation. Let me compute ln(1 + 1/x). For large x, 1/x is small, so ln(1 + 1/x) ≈ 1/x - 1/(2x^2) + ... 

But maybe I can use the first two terms for approximation.

So, ln(1 + 1/x) ≈ 1/x - 1/(2x^2)

So, (x + 1) r ln(1 + 1/x) ≈ (x + 1) r (1/x - 1/(2x^2)) )

= (x + 1) [ r/x - r/(2x^2) ]

= (x r)/x + (1 * r)/x - (x r)/(2x^2) - (1 * r)/(2x^2)
= r + r/x - r/(2x) - r/(2x^2)
= r + (r/x)(1 - 1/2) - r/(2x^2)
= r + (r/(2x)) - r/(2x^2)

So, putting that back into A:

A ≈ 1 + r + (r/(2x)) - r/(2x^2)

Hmm, so A ≈ 1 + r + (r/(2x)) - r/(2x^2)

But wait, another approach: maybe instead of expanding in terms of r, I can make a substitution to simplify the expression inside the limit.

Wait, let me consider the expression inside the [ ] in g(x):

[ (x + 1)(1 + 1/x)^r - x ]^{1/r}

Let me denote this expression as B:

B = [(x + 1)(1 + 1/x)^r - x]^{1/r}

We can take the natural logarithm of B to make it easier to handle:

ln B = (1/r) ln[ (x + 1)(1 + 1/x)^r - x ]

Hmm, but perhaps this isn't immediately helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can let t = r, and consider the behavior as t approaches 0.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the expansion of ln(1 + y) for small y, where y = (1 + 1/x)^r - 1. Let's write y = (1 + 1/x)^r - 1.

So, y = e^{r ln(1 + 1/x)} - 1 ≈ r ln(1 + 1/x) + (r ln(1 + 1/x))^2 / 2 + ... 

But perhaps for small r, y ≈ r ln(1 + 1/x). So, then, (x + 1)(1 + 1/x)^r ≈ (x + 1)(1 + r ln(1 + 1/x)).

So, (x + 1)(1 + r ln(1 + 1/x)) = (x + 1) + (x + 1) r ln(1 + 1/x)

So, subtracting x, we get:

A = (x + 1) + (x + 1) r ln(1 + 1/x) - x
= 1 + (x + 1) r ln(1 + 1/x)

So, B = [1 + (x + 1) r ln(1 + 1/x)]^{1/r}

Hmm, but we can factor out (x + 1) as:

= [1 + (x + 1) r ln(1 + 1/x)]^{1/r}

Wait, but perhaps I can express this as:

= [1 + r ln(1 + 1/x) ]^{1/r} * (x + 1)

Because (x + 1) [1 + r ln(1 + 1/x)] = (x + 1) + (x + 1) r ln(1 + 1/x)

So, then B = (x + 1) * [1 + (r ln(1 + 1/x)) ]^{1/r}

Now, note that as r approaches 0, [1 + (r ln(1 + 1/x)) ]^{1/r} approaches e^{ln(1 + 1/x)} because the limit as h approaches 0 of (1 + h)^{1/h} is e^h when h is small, but here h is scaled by r.

Wait, more accurately, the limit as r approaches 0 of [1 + a r]^{1/r} = e^a.

So, in this case, a is ln(1 + 1/x). So, [1 + r ln(1 + 1/x)]^{1/r} approaches e^{ln(1 + 1/x)} = 1 + 1/x.

So, putting it all together:

B = (x + 1) * (1 + 1/x) = (x + 1)(x + 1)/x = (x + 1)^2 / x.

Wait, let me compute that again:

(x + 1) * (1 + 1/x) = (x + 1) * ( (x + 1)/x ) = (x + 1)^2 / x.

So, B = (x + 1)^2 / x.

Therefore, g(x) = x * B = x * (x + 1)^2 / x = (x + 1)^2.

So, g(x) = (x + 1)^2.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me recap:

We had:

g(x) = lim_{r→0} [ (x + 1)^{r + 1} - x^{r + 1} ]^{1/r}

We expanded (x + 1)^{r + 1} and x^{r + 1}, factored out x^r, and then used approximations for small r.

After simplifying, we found that g(x) = (x + 1)^2.

That's a neat result. So, now, the next step is to find the limit of g(x)/x as x approaches infinity.

So, g(x) is (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1.

Thus, g(x)/x = (x^2 + 2x + 1)/x = x + 2 + 1/x.

So, we need to compute the limit as x approaches infinity of (x + 2 + 1/x).

As x → ∞, the terms x and 2 dominate, and 1/x approaches 0. So, the limit is infinity.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is 'Infinity', so that would be the answer.

Let me double-check my steps to be sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Expanded (x + 1)^{r + 1} and x^{r + 1} correctly.
2. Factored out x^r to separate the terms.
3. Factored x^r from both terms to simplify.
4. Then, I noticed that (x + 1)(1 + 1/x)^r - x can be expressed as 1 + (x + 1) r ln(1 + 1/x), using the approximation for small r.
5. Then, taking the logarithm and exponentiating, I considered the limit as r → 0 of [1 + r ln(...)]^{1/r} which tends to e^{ln(...)} = 1 + 1/x.
6. So, B becomes (x + 1) * (1 + 1/x) = (x + 1)^2 / x.
7. Thus, g(x) = x * B = (x + 1)^2.

This seems correct. Then, g(x)/x simplifies to x + 2 + 1/x, which tends to infinity as x grows.

Therefore, the limit is infinity, which is option B.
</think>

The problem requires evaluating the limit of \( g(x)/x \) as \( x \) approaches infinity, where \( g(x) \) is defined as the limit of \( [(x+1)^{r+1} - x^{r+1}]^{1/r} \) as \( r \to 0 \).

1. **Simplifying \( g(x) \):**
   - Expand \( (x+1)^{r+1} \) and \( x^{r+1} \) using the binomial theorem.
   - Factor out \( x^r \) from both terms.
   - Simplify to find \( g(x) = (x + 1)^2 \).

2. **Evaluating \( \lim_{x \to \infty} g(x)/x \):**
   - Substitute \( g(x) = (x + 1)^2 \) into the expression.
   - Simplify \( g(x)/x = x + 2 + 1/x \).
   - As \( x \to \infty \), the dominant term is \( x \), so the limit is infinity.

The final answer is **B: Infinity**.
