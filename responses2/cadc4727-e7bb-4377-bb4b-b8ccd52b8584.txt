Alright, so I've got this question about the Cauchy distribution. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to remember.

Part (a) asks for the value of K such that f(x) is a probability density function. I remember that for a function to be a PDF, it has to satisfy two main conditions: it must be non-negative everywhere, and the integral of the function over the entire real line must equal 1.

The given function is f(x) = K / (1 + x²). Hmm, okay, so K is a constant that we need to find.

First, let's check if it's non-negative. Since K is a constant, if it's positive, then f(x) would be positive everywhere (because 1 + x² is always positive). If K were negative, f(x) would be negative everywhere, which can't be a PDF. So K must be positive.

Now, the integral part. The integral of f(x) from -infinity to infinity should equal 1. So,

∫_{-∞}^∞ [K/(1 + x²)] dx = 1.

I remember that the integral of 1/(1 + x²) dx from -infty to infty is π. Let me confirm that. Oh wait, wait. I think the integral of 1/(1 + x²) is arctan(x) evaluated from -infinity to infinity. Arctan(inf) is π/2 and arctan(-inf) is -π/2. So the integral is π/2 - (-π/2) = π. Got it.

So, substituting that into our equation:

K * π = 1 → K = 1/π.

So part (a) gives K = 1/π.

Moving on to part (b), which is the expected value E(X). The expected value for a continuous random variable is given by the integral of x times f(x) dx over all x.

So,

E(X) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ x * [1/π] * (1/(1 + x²)) dx.

Let me write that down: (1/π) ∫_{-∞}^∞ x/(1 + x²) dx.

Hmm, what's the integral of x/(1 + x²) dx? Let's think. The function x/(1 + x²) is an odd function because if you replace x with -x, you get (-x)/(1 + x²) which is -x/(1 + x²). Integrating an odd function over symmetric limits (-a to a) gives zero. So the entire integral is zero. Therefore, E(X) is zero.

Wait, let me make sure that's correct. Because when you integrate an odd function over symmetric limits, it indeed cancels out, giving zero. So yes, E(X) is zero.

Part (c) is the variance of X. Variance is Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]². Since E(X) is zero, Var(X) is just E(X²).

So, we need to compute E(X²) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ x²/(1 + x²) * (1/π) dx.

Again, x²/(1 + x²) can be simplified. Let me see: x²/(1 + x²) = 1 - 1/(1 + x²). So,

E(X²) = (1/π) ∫_{-∞}^∞ [1 - 1/(1 + x²)] dx.

Breaking this into two integrals:

(1/π) [∫_{-∞}^∞ 1 dx - ∫_{-∞}^∞ 1/(1 + x²) dx ].

Wait, but the first integral ∫_{-∞}^∞ 1 dx diverges to infinity. That can't be right because variance can't be infinite. But wait, I must have made a mistake in simplifying. Let's redo that.

Wait, x²/(1 + x²) is equal to 1 - 1/(1 + x²), right? Because x² = (1 + x²) - 1. So,

x²/(1 + x²) = (1 + x² - 1)/(1 + x²) ) = 1 - 1/(1 + x²). Yes, that's correct.

So E(X²) = (1/π) [∫_{-∞}^∞ 1 dx - ∫_{-∞}^∞ 1/(1 + x²) dx ]. The first integral is divergent, which would imply that E(X²) is infinite. But wait, that can't be, because the Cauchy distribution does have a finite variance. Hmm, maybe I messed up the approach.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The variance for Cauchy distribution is known to be π²/2, but wait, wait. No, wait, the variance of the standard Cauchy distribution is actually infinite. Because the moments beyond the first are undefined.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check the standard Cauchy distribution. The standard Cauchy distribution has a probability density function f(x) = 1/(π(1 + x²)). So here, K is 1/π.

In this case, the variance is known to be infinite. Because the integral for Var(X) is E(X²) which is infinite. So Var(X) is infinite.

Wait, but when I computed E(X²), I got (1/π) [∫1 dx - ∫1/(1+x²) dx], which is (1/π) [infinite - π]. So that would be (1/π) * infinite, which is infinite. Hence, the variance is infinite.

Alternatively, I remember that for the standard Cauchy distribution, the mean is zero and the variance is infinite. So for our case, since f(x) is K/(1 +x²) where K=1/π, the variance is indeed infinite.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option E says K=1/π, E(X)=0, Variance=∞. So that's E.

Option F is K=0 which can't be because K must be positive. Option G says K=2/π, which is incorrect. Option J has K=π/2, which is too big. Option A, B, C, D, etc., have K=1/π but their variances differ.

Wait, but the variance is infinite, so the correct answer should have an infinite variance. Looking at the options, E is the one with K=1/π, E(X)=0, and Variance=∞.

So, the correct choice is E.

The Cauchy distribution has a probability density function (PDF) given by \( f(x) = \frac{K}{1 + x^2} \). To determine the value of \( K \) such that \( f(x) \) is a PDF, we ensure that the integral of \( f(x) \) over all \( x \) equals 1. The integral of \( \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \) from \( -\infty \) to \( \infty \) is \( \pi \). Therefore, \( K = \frac{1}{\pi} \).

For part (a), the value of \( K \) is \( K = \frac{1}{\pi} \).

For part (b), the expected value \( E(X) \) is calculated as:
\[
E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x \cdot \frac{1}{\pi(1 + x^2)} dx.
\]
Since the integrand is an odd function, the integral is zero. Thus, \( E(X) = 0 \).

For part (c), the variance \( \text{Var}(X) \) is:
\[
\text{Var}(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2 = E(X^2) - 0 = E(X^2).
\]
Calculating \( E(X^2) \):
\[
E(X^2) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{x^2}{1 + x^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\pi} dx = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left(1 - \frac{1}{1 + x^2}\right) dx.
\]
The first integral diverges, implying \( E(X^2) \) is infinite. Hence, \( \text{Var}(X) = \infty \).

The correct option is \( K = \frac{1}{\pi}, E(X) = 0, \) Variance \( = \infty \), which is option E.
