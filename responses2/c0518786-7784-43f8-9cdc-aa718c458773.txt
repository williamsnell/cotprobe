The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A student was a practical joker who liked to perform zany antics. Late at night after studying, he would often walk around the campus dressed only in a raincoat and boxers. As he approached young women, he would flash them by opening his raincoat and exposing himself in his shorts. The student believed that he was committing a crime by flashing himself in front of the co-eds. In this jurisdiction, it is a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude, so, unknown to the student, what he was doing was not a crime. One night, the student broke into a sorority house intending to flash the sorority sisters. Clad only in his raincoat and shorts, he entered the bedroom of one of the sisters who was lying in her bed studying for an exam. The sister, who knew the student, said, "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be studying for finals?" The student then took off his raincoat and responded, "Study this, baby!" He then began to run through the sorority house in his shorts. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and placed the student under arrest. If the student is prosecuted, he should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?

Options:

A: Neither burglary nor attempted violation of the statute.
B: Attempted violation of the statute.
C: Both indecent exposure and attempted violation of the statute.
D: Both trespassing and attempted violation of the statute.
E: Both burglary and indecent exposure.
F: Trespassing only.
G: Both burglary and attempted violation of the statute.
H: Indecent exposure only.
I: Both burglary and trespassing.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let me read it carefully. The student is a practical joker who often performs zany acts, like walking around campus in a raincoat and boxers. He does this late at night after studying. When he approaches young women, he flashes them by opening his raincoat and showing himself in his shorts. He believes this is a crime, so he felt he was committing a crime by doing this. However, in this jurisdiction, it's a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude. So, the student didn't actually commit a crime because he thought it was a crime. 

Then, on a particular night, he broke into a sorority house intending to flash the sisters. He was dressed only in a raincoat and shorts. He entered the sister's room, who was studying. The sister said, "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be studying?" The student then took off his raincoat and began running through the sorority house in his shorts. The police arrived and arrest him. The question is, if the student is prosecuted, which crime would he be found guilty of, if any?

The options are from A to I, with F being trespassing only, etc.

So, first, I need to identify what kind of crimes the student committed. Let me think about the elements involved.

He was in the sorority house, so maybe trespassing. Trespassing typically involves entering someone's property without the owner's consent. The student was entering the sister's room, which was part of the sorority house. So, trespassing applies here.

Now, the crime in question is attempting an act that's a felony. So, he was attempting something that's a felony, which would make him guilty of that crime. But the question is about what he was found guilty of, if any.

Wait, but the options suggest that maybe there are multiple crimes. Let's map this out.

First, the act of flashing or exposing himself in the nude. The law requires that the act be completely naked and in a position that exposes the body. So, the student didn't expose himself in the nude. He was wearing a raincoat and shorts, so it's not a complete nude act. So, he didn't commit the crime of incitement or anything like that. But the question is about whether he attempted a felony.

Wait, no, in this case, the crime is about being a performer, not about the act of the act. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the student is attempting a crime ( flash, which is a felony) by entering the room. So, he's committing an act (attempting to perform) which is a felony. So, he would be guilty of the crime of attempting a felony.

But what about the other elements? He was in the property, so trespassing applies. So, he's guilty of both trespassing and attempted violation of a felony. So, he's guilty of both.

Looking at the options, option E is both burglary and trespassing. But wait, does the act of attempting a felony count as a crime? Because burglary requires a felony, which this is, but the crime of attempting a felony is a separate category.

Wait, no, perhaps the crime here is about the act of attempting to perform a crime. So, when someone commits the crime (like flash) and attempts to do it, they're guilty of the felony. But in this case, they're not committing the crime in the actual act but are attempting it. So, the charges would be trespassing (entering property) and attempted criminal act (attempting to commit a felony).

So, the possible options are E (burglary and trespassing). But wait, burglary requires the unlawful entry into someone's property, which is the case here. So, E would be correct.

Wait, but the other option is whether the attempt is of a felony. So, the law in New York would require that the act is a felony and the person is attempting to commit it. So, the student is committing a crime (attempting to do a felony) and the act is a felony. So, he's guilty of both the felony attempt and the trespassing.

Wait, but the options:

E is both burglary and trespassing. So, if both are separate, that would make sense. Alternatively, maybe the act is a felony attempt, which counts as a separate offense, but the trespassing is another.

Hmm, but the options are presented as options of what he would be guilty of. So, let's think about possible charges.

The options:

E: Both burglary and trespassing.

But wait, is this a case of entering into the property without consent (trespassing) and attempting a felony (attempting to commit a felony). So, he's both guilty of both.

Wait, but the question is whether he's found guilty of any of the listed crimes. So, the answer is E: Both burglary and trespassing.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because "attempting a felony" is a specific category. So, maybe it's not separate, but perhaps the attempt is part of the criminal attempt. But in any case, the options don't have a combination of both criminal and separate acts. So, the two crimes would be trespassing and the attempted felony. So, the answer is E: Both burglary and trespassing.

Alternatively, perhaps the act of attempting a felony is a separate charge, but I don't think so. Because the crime of attempting a felony is a separate charge.

Wait, but the actual crime being attempted is a felony, so he's guilty of that, and the act is a felony, so he's guilty of both the felony attempt and the trespassing.

So, the correct answer would be E: Both burglary and trespassing.

Wait, but looking back, the options are multiple choices, so the correct answer is E.

The student, attempting to flash or expose himself in the nude, is guilty of both the crime of attempting a felony and the act of trespassing. The act of entering the sorority house without the owner's consent (trespassing) is a separate offense, and the attempt to perform a felony ( flash) is also a separate charge. Therefore, the student is found guilty of both burglary and trespassing.

ANSWER: E
