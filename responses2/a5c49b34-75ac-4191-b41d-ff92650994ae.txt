Okay, so I need to find out how much of Mr. Stevens's property tax was passed along to the county government. Hmm, let's break this down. 

The problem says that 28% of the property tax is passed to the county. So, first, I should find out the total property tax Mr. Stevens owes. The home was assessed for $17,400. But wait, I think the tax rate is given per $1,000, not per the assessed value. So I need to calculate the total tax first.

The town's tax rate is $24.90 per $1,000. Since the home is assessed for $17,400, I should determine how many thousands that is. Let me see, $17,400 divided by $1,000 is 17.4. So, the tax would be 17.4 times $24.90.

Calculating that: 17 * $24.90 is 17 * 24.9. Let me compute 17 * 24 = 408, and 17 * 0.9 = 15.3. So 408 +15.3=423.3. Then 0.4 of $24.90 is 9.96. So adding that to 423.3 gives 433.26. So the total tax is $433.26.

Now, 28% of this is passed to the county. So I need to calculate 28% of $433.26. Let's compute that. 28% is 0.28. So 433.26 * 0.28.

Let me break this down: 400 * 0.28 is 112, and 33.26 * 0.28. 33 *0.28 is 9.24, and 0.26*0.28 is 0.0728. So 9.24 +0.0728=9.3128. Adding that to 112 gives 121.3128. So approximately $121.31.

Looking at the options, option F is $121.31. So that should be the answer.

The total property tax is calculated by dividing the assessed value by $1,000 and multiplying by the tax rate. For $17,400, this gives 17.4 * $24.90 = $433.26. The county passes along 28%, which is 0.28 * $433.26 = $121.31.

Answer: F
