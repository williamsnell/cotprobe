Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the heat of combustion of hydrogen gas. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question gives me the reaction 2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(g), and tells me that the ΔH° is -115,595.8 cal at 25°C, which is 298 K. I think this ΔH is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, which is the combustion of hydrogen gas into water vapor.

Wait, but the question is about the heat of combustion, which is usually the enthalpy change when one mole of the substance is burned completely. So for this reaction, the given ΔH is for 2 moles of H₂, but I think the standard enthalpy of combustion is per mole. So I might need to divide by 2 to get the per mole value.

So the reaction as written produces 2 moles of H₂O(g), so the ΔH given is for 2 H₂ and 1 O₂ combining to make 2 H₂O(g). Therefore, the standard enthalpy of combustion for 1 mole of H₂ would be half of that value. Let me calculate that.

Half of 115,595.8 is about 57,797.9 cal. Wait, but wait a second. Because when you take the enthalpy change of a reaction, the sign depends on the direction. The given ΔH is negative, which means the reaction is exothermic. So that would make sense for combustion since combustion is exothermic.

Wait no, wait. The reaction given is 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O(g), and the ΔH is -115,595.8 cal. The negative sign indicates that the reaction releases heat (endothermic? Wait, no, negative means exothermic. Oh wait, exothermic reactions release heat, so the reaction is exothermic. So the given ΔH is negative because it's releasing heat.

But wait, when you burn hydrogen gas (H₂) to form water vapor (H₂O), that's indeed an exothermic reaction. So the ΔH for that reaction is negative. So the given ΔH is correct.

So the standard enthalpy of combustion of H₂ is the ΔH per mole of H₂. So the reaction as written produces 2 moles of H₂O. Therefore, the per mole ΔH is half of -115,595.8 cal. Let me compute that.

Divide 115,595.8 by 2: 115,595.8 / 2 = 57,797.9 cal. But wait, the sign is negative because the reaction is exothermic. So the standard enthalpy change of combustion is -57,797.9 cal per mole. Hmm. But looking at the options, I don't see that exact number. Let me check the options.

The options are all in the 116,000s, except one is 117,250. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Let me recalculate. 115,595.8 divided by 2 is 57,797.9. So the per mole value is approximately -57,800 cal. But the options are much higher—like around 116,000. So I'm confused. Maybe I got the reaction wrong.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. The question is about the heat of combustion of hydrogen gas. The standard enthalpy of combustion of H₂ is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of H₂ is burned. So the given reaction is for 2 moles of H₂. So the enthalpy change is -115,595.8 cal for 2 moles, so per mole it's -57,797.9 cal. But that's not in the options. The options are all around 116,000. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses another approach. Maybe I'm mixing the reaction. Let me think again. The reaction is 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(g). So the standard enthalpy is -115,595.8 cal. So per mole of H₂, it's half that.

But wait, the options are all like 116,000, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Or maybe the question is considering the combustion as the reverse reaction, but that doesn't make sense here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the user made a mistake in the sign or the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps they are considering the enthalpy of combustion as the per gram basis. Let me think: if the reaction produces 2 moles of H₂O, which is 2 * 18 g/mol = 36 g. So per mole of H₂ (which is 2 g), the enthalpy is -115,595.8 cal. So per gram of H₂, it's (-115,595.8)/2 / 36 cal/g.

Wait, let me compute that. 115,595.8 / 2 = 57,797.9 cal for 2 g. So per gram, that's 57,797.9 / 2 = 28,898.95 cal/g. Wait, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, per gram of H₂, the heat released would be (115,595.8 cal)/(2 g) )= 57,797.9 cal per gram H₂. But that's not helpful for the question.

Wait, perhaps the user is mixing up the heat of combustion with the standard enthalpy of formation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the given data is per mole, but the options are for a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong reaction. The standard enthalpy of combustion is usually given for the combustion of 1 mole of the substance, which in this case is H₂. But since the given reaction is for 2 moles of H₂, the per mole value would be half of that.

Wait, let me recheck the math. The given ΔH is -115,595.8 cal for 2 moles. So per mole is -57,797.9 cal. But that's not any of the options. The options are about 116,000. So perhaps I'm missing a step here.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me make a table.

Reaction given: 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(g), ΔH = -115,595.8 cal.

So per mole of reaction, 2 moles H₂ → 2 H₂O.

So per mole of H₂: (ΔH) / 2 = -115,595.8 / 2 = -57,797.9 cal.

But the options are much higher. Wait, perhaps the question is about the molar heat of combustion, but in kJ, not cal. Because when the options are in thousands, it's more likely it's in kJ.

Wait, perhaps the given ΔH is in kJ, not cal. Let me see: 115,595.8 cal is equal to how many kJ? Because 1 cal is approximately 4.184 joules. So 115,595.8 cal = 115,595.8 * 4.184 J = 115,595.8 * 4.184 ≈ let me compute:

115,595.8 * 4.184 ≈ 115,595.8 *4 is 462,383.2; 0.184*115595.8≈21,236. So total approximately 483,619.2 J. Which is about 483.6 kJ.

Wait, but the given ΔH is -115,595.8 cal, which is about -483.6 kJ.

Wait, but the question asks for the heat of combustion, which is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of H₂ is burned. So if the given ΔH is for 2 moles, the per mole is half that.

So 483.6 kJ for 2 moles → 241.8 kJ per mole.

So looking at the options, option J is -114,300 cal, which is 114,300 cal per mole. Wait, but converting that to kJ: 114,300 cal ≈ 114,300 *4.184 ≈ 476,000 J → 476 kJ. Wait, but the per mole of H₂ is 241.8 kJ. So none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given data is for the combustion of 1 mole of H₂. Let me think again. If the given ΔH is for 2 moles, then the per mole is half of that. So 115,595.8 cal / 2 = 57,797.9 cal per mole.

Wait, but again, the options are around 116,000. None of the options are 57,797.9 cal. So perhaps I have a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction given is written differently, or perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of combustion in kJ, which would require a different calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to calculate the standard enthalpy of combustion using another approach.

Wait, another approach. The standard enthalpy of combustion is the heat released when 1 mole of the substance is burned completely. For H₂, that would be the enthalpy change when 1 mole of H₂ reacts with O₂ to form H₂O(g).

But the given reaction is 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(g), which releases 115,595.8 cal. So per mole of H₂, it's half that, which is 57,797.9 cal. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, the options are all in the high thousands, like 116,000, which is exactly double the given ΔH. Wait, no. Wait, the given ΔH is for 2 moles. So perhaps the options are in cal per mole, but perhaps the question is about the enthalpy change in kJ per mole?

Wait, maybe I should convert the cal to kJ. Let me think again. 

1 cal = 4.184 J = 0.004184 kJ. So the given ΔH is 115,595.8 cal = 115,595.8 * 0.004184 kJ.

Let me compute that: 115,595.8 * 0.004184 → let's see. 100,000 *0.004184=418.4. 15,595.8 *0.004184: let's compute that.

15,595.8 * 0.004 is 62.3832. 15,595.8 * 0.000184 = approx 2.869. So total about 62.3832 +2.869 =65.252. So 418.4+65.252=483.652 kJ. So the given ΔH is about -483.652 kJ.

Wait, but that's for 2 moles. So per mole, that's -241.826 kJ. So per mole of H₂, the enthalpy change is -241.826 kJ. 

Looking at the options, the closest one is option J: -114,300 cal. Let me convert that to kJ. 114,300 cal is 114,300 * 0.004184 kJ. Let's compute: 100,000 cal is 418.4 kJ, 14,300 cal is 14,300 *0.004184 ≈ 60.06 kJ. So total ≈ 418.4 +60.06=478.46 kJ. But the per mole is -241.826 kJ, which is approximately -240 kJ. 

Wait, but none of the options exactly match. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: -119,767 cal

B: -117,250 cal

C: -118,000 cal

D: -122,000 cal

E: -120,000 cal

F: -116,500 cal

G: -121,500 cal

H: -113,000 cal

I: -115,595.8 cal

J: -114,300 cal

Wait, so the computed per mole is about -241.8 kJ. But looking at the options, the closest is option J: -114,300 cal. Let me compute -114,300 cal in kJ: 114,300 *0.004184 = 114,300 *4.184e-3 = let's compute: 100,000 *4.184e-3 = 418.4; 14,300 *4.184e-3=14,300 *0.004184=60.06. So total is 478.46 kJ. 

But that's higher than the per mole value which was about -241.8 kJ. So why is there such a big discrepancy? Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction. 

Wait, perhaps the question is not for the combustion of 2 moles but for 1 mole. Wait, no, the question says the reaction is 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(g), so that's 2 moles of H₂. So why is the per mole value so low compared to the options?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Maybe the given ΔH is for the reaction as written, but the question is about the heat of combustion, which is the same as the enthalpy change of the reaction. So the given value is for the given reaction, which is 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(g), so the per mole would be half the given ΔH. But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is written differently. Wait, perhaps the reaction is written for 1 mole of H₂. Let me think again: the given reaction is 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(g). So the standard enthalpy change is -115,595.8 cal for that reaction. So the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of H₂ would be half that, which is -57,797.9 cal, which is -57,797.9 cal per mole of H₂.

But again, none of the options match this. The options are around 116,000 cal, which is 2 times the given ΔH. So perhaps the question is really asking for the value in kJ, not cal. Let's recompute.

Wait, the given ΔH is -115,595.8 cal. Let's convert that to kJ. As I did before, 115,595.8 cal = 115,595.8 * 4.184 J = 483.6 kJ. So for 2 moles of H₂, it's -483.6 kJ. So per mole, it's -241.8 kJ. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is -114,300 cal. Let me calculate that in kJ. So 114,300 cal is 114,300 *4.184 J = 478,465.2 J → 478.465 kJ. That's higher than the per mole value of -241.8 kJ. So that's not matching. So perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Wait another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the heat of combustion of 1 mole of H₂, but the given ΔH is for the combustion of 2 moles. So perhaps the per mole is -57,797.9 cal. But none of the options match that. 

Wait, perhaps I should think about the standard enthalpy of combustion and realize that the reaction given is for 2 moles, but the question is about the standard enthalpy of combustion of H₂, which would be per mole of H₂. So the per mole is half of the given ΔH, which is -57,797.9 cal.

But looking at the options, the highest is option G: -121,500 cal, and option F: -116,500 cal and option J: -114,300 cal.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about the problem. The reaction is 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(g), and the given ΔH is -115,595.8 cal. So per mole of H₂ is -57,797.9 cal. But none of the options match this. 

Wait, perhaps the question is in kJ and I'm mixing the units. Let me compute the per mole in kJ:

The given ΔH is for 2 moles of H₂. So per mole is -115,595.8 cal / 2 = -57,797.9 cal. Convert that to kJ: 57,797.9 cal * 4.184 J/cal = 57,797.9 *4.184 = 241,826 J = 241.8 kJ per mole.

But the options are in thousands, so looking for the closest. None of the options are 241.8 kJ. The highest is G: -121,500 cal.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong reaction. Another thought: perhaps the given reaction is written as 2 H₂O → 2 H₂ + O₂, which would be the reverse. But then, the ΔH would be positive, as the reaction is spontaneous. But in the question, the given ΔH is negative, so that would not fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the reaction. Let me write the given reaction again: 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(g); ΔH = -115,595.8 cal.

So the per mole of H₂ is -57,797.9 cal, which is approximately -57,800 cal. But the options don't have this value. The closest option is option G: -121,500 cal, which is about double. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should calculate the standard enthalpy of combustion of H₂ using the standard enthalpies of formation.

The standard enthalpy of combustion (ΔH_comb) of a substance is equal to the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) of the elements in their standard states, multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients, plus the standard enthalpy of formation of the substance (ΔHf°) multiplied by the stoichiometric coefficient of the substance. 

Wait, the formula is: ΔH_comb = [sum (ΔHf°(elements) × coefficients)] + [ΔHf°(substance) × coefficient_substance]

But wait, no, the formula is:

ΔH_comb = [sum (ΔHf°(elements) × their moles)] + [ΔHf°(substance) × their moles]].

Wait, let me clarify. The standard enthalpy of combustion is:

ΔH_comb = [sum (ΔHf°(elements) × moles)] + [ΔHf°(substance) × moles]]

But I get confused because the elements are in their standard states, the substance is the substance, and the reaction is as written.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔH_comb = [sum (ΔHf°(elements) × moles)] + [ΔHf°(substance) × moles)]

But wait, no, the standard enthalpies of formation are for each element in their standard form. So for the combustion reaction, the elements are O₂ and H₂, and the substance is H₂O.

Wait, perhaps a better way is:

The equation for the combustion of H₂ is:

2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(g)

The standard enthalpy of combustion (ΔH_comb) can be calculated using the standard enthalpies of formation of H₂, O₂, and H₂O.

The formula is:

ΔH_comb = [sum (ΔHf°(elements) × moles)] + [ΔHf°(substance) × moles)]

But I'm getting stuck. Let me refer back to the formula.

The standard enthalpy of combustion (ΔH_comb) is calculated using the formula:

ΔH_comb = [sum (ΔHf°(elements) × moles)] + [ΔHf°(substance) × moles)]

Wait, no, that's not correct. The formula is:

ΔH_comb = [sum (ΔHf°(elements) × moles)] + [ΔHf°(substance) × moles)] 

Wait, no, the correct formula is:

ΔH_comb = [sum (ΔHf°(elements) × moles)] + [ΔHf°(substance) × moles)]

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me approach this with an example.

For the combustion of carbon (C), the reaction is:

C (graphite) + O₂(g) → CO(g)

The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) for CO(g) is -110.5 kJ/mol. The ΔHf° for C is 0 (as C is in its standard state), and O₂ is 0. So:

ΔH_comb = [sum (ΔHf°(elements) × moles)] + [ΔHf°(substance) × moles)]

Wait, but for CO, the reaction is C + O₂ → CO. So the elements are C, O₂, and CO. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔH_comb = [sum (ΔHf°(elements) × moles)] + [ΔHf°(substance) × moles)]

But I think another approach is better. Let me think about the standard enthalpy of formation.

The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) of a compound is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of that compound is formed from the elements in their standard states.

So, for example, the ΔHf° of CO(g) is -110.5 kJ/mol.

The reaction for the formation of CO is:

C(graphite) + O₂(g) → CO(g)

The ΔHf° of CO is the enthalpy of the reaction, which is -110.5 kJ per mole.

Similarly, the reaction for the formation of H₂O(l) is:

H₂(g) + ½ O₂(g) → H₂O(l)

ΔHf° for H₂O(l) is -237.1 kJ per mole.

So, to find the standard enthalpy of combustion (ΔH_comb) of H₂, which is the reaction:

2 H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2 H₂O(l)

The ΔH_comb is the enthalpy change for this reaction. The standard enthalpy of combustion can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH_comb = [sum (ΔHf°(elements) × moles)] + [ΔHf°(substance) × moles)]

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔH_comb = sum (ΔHf°(products)) - sum (ΔHf°(reactants))

But wait, no, that would be the standard enthalpy of reaction. Wait, no, the standard enthalpy of reaction is given by:

ΔH°rxn = sum (ΔHf°(products)) - sum (ΔHf°(reactants))

So, for the reaction 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l), the standard enthalpy of reaction (ΔH°rxn) is:

ΔH°rxn = [2 * ΔHf°(H₂O(l))] - [2 * ΔHf°(H₂) + 1 * ΔHf°(O₂)]

Wait, but since O₂ is in its standard state, its ΔHf° is zero. So:

ΔH°rxn = [2 * (-237.1 kJ/mol)] - [2 * (0) + 1 * (0)] 

= 2 * (-237.1) - 0 = -474.2 kJ/mol

Wait, but the ΔH for the combustion is the same as the standard enthalpy of reaction. So ΔH_comb = -474.2 kJ/mol.

But wait, the question is about the heat of combustion. So that would be the enthalpy change when the reaction occurs. So, the value is -474.2 kJ/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them match. The options are in thousands, so let me compute each option in kJ:

Option A: -119,767 cal → 119,767 *4.184 J → which is way too big, but let's compute it in kJ. 119,767 cal = 119,767 *4.184 J = 119,767 *0.004184 kJ = approx 500 kJ. So option A is -500,000 kJ. That's way larger than our computed value of -474.2 kJ.

Option B: -117,250 cal → 117,250 *0.004184 = 117,250 *4.184 J = 117,250 *0.004184 kJ= approx 490 kJ. So option B is -490,000 kJ. Again, way larger than -474.2 kJ.

Option C: -118,000 cal → 118,000 *0.004184 = 118,000 *4.184 J = 118,000 *0.004184 kJ = approx 492 kJ. So option C is -492,000 kJ.

Option D: -122,000 cal → 122,000 *0.004184 = 122,000 *4.184 J = 122,000 *0.004184 kJ= approx 510 kJ. So option D is -510,000 kJ.

Option E: -120,000 cal → 120,000 *0.004184 = 120,000 *4.184 J = 120,000 *0.004184 kJ= approx 502 kJ. So option E is -502,000 kJ.

Option F: -116,500 cal → 116,500 *0.004184 = approx 500 kJ. So option F is -500,000 kJ.

Option G: -121,500 cal → 121,500 *0.004184 = 121,500 *4.184 J = 121,500 *0.004184 kJ= approx 505 kJ. So option G is -505,000 kJ.

Option H: -115,595.8 cal → Which is the same as the given ΔH. So option H is -115,595.8 kJ.

Option I: -114,300 cal → 114,300 *0.004184 = 114,300 *4.184 J = 114,300 *0.004184 kJ= approx 478 kJ. So option I is -478,000 kJ.

Option J: -114,300 cal → Yes, option J is -114,300 cal, which is 114,300 cal. So option J is -114,300 cal. We computed that in kJ as -478,465 kJ. So that's -478.5 kJ.

Wait, but our computed ΔH_comb is -474.2 kJ/mol. So none of the options match exactly. But the closest is option I: -114,300 cal → which is -478,465 kJ. So that's -478.5 kJ, which is very close to our computed value of -474.2 kJ.

So the correct answer should be option I: -114,300 cal.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the question is about the standard enthalpy of combustion of hydrogen gas. 

Wait, standard enthalpy of combustion refers to the standard enthalpy of reaction when the substance is combusted to form CO or H₂O. So for the reaction 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l), the standard enthalpy of combustion is -474.2 kJ/mol.

But among the options, none exactly match. Option I is -114,300 cal. Let me compute that in kJ.

114,300 cal = 114,300 *4.184 J = 114,300 *0.004184 kJ = approx 478.46 kJ. So option I is -478.46 kJ. 

Our computed value is -474.2 kJ. So the difference is about 4.26 kJ. So which option is correct? 

Looking at the options, the closest is option I, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. 

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the reaction in terms of moles. Let me re-calculate the standard enthalpy of combustion.

The reaction is 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l).

The standard enthalpy of combustion (ΔH_comb) is given by:

ΔH_comb = [sum (ΔHf°(elements) × moles)] + [ΔHf°(substance) × moles)] 

Wait, but perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔH_comb = [sum (ΔHf°(elements) × moles)] + [ΔHf°(substance) × moles)] 

But I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. 

The standard enthalpy of combustion can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH_comb = [sum (ΔHf°(elements) × moles)] + [ΔHf°(substance) × moles)] 

But perhaps I'm mixing up the elements and the substance. Let me try again.

The reaction is 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l).

The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) for H₂ is 0 (as it's the reference element), for O₂ is 0, and for H₂O(l) is -237.1 kJ/mol.

So, the reaction can be written as:

2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l)

The standard enthalpy of reaction (ΔH°rxn) is:

ΔH°rxn = [2 * (-237.1)] - [2 * (0) + 1 * (0)] 

= (-474.2) - (0) = -474.2 kJ/mol.

So the standard enthalpy of combustion (ΔH_comb) is -474.2 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match exactly. The options are:

Option I: -114,300 cal → which is 114,300 cal → 114,300 *4.184 J = 478,465 J → 478.465 kJ.

So option I is -478.465 kJ.

So our computed value is -474.2 kJ, which is 4.26 kJ higher than option I.

Hmm, maybe I should have considered the reaction as 1 mole of H₂ reacting. But no, the reaction given is 2 moles.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the reaction as 1 mole of H₂ reacting. Let me see.

If the reaction is 1 mole of H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l), then the standard enthalpy of reaction (ΔH°rxn) would be:

ΔH°rxn = [1 * (-237.1)] - [1 *0 + 0.5*0] = -237.1 kJ/mol.

So the standard enthalpy of combustion for 1 mole of H₂ is -237.1 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the question is about the standard enthalpy of combustion of 1 mole of H₂, which would be -237.1 kJ/mol.

But looking back, the options are all much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔH_comb = sum (ΔHf°(products)) - sum (ΔHf°(reactants))

But I think that's correct.

Wait, let me recompute this.

For the reaction 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l):

ΔH_comb = [2 * (-237.1)] - [2 * (0) + 1 * (0)] = (-474.2) - (0) = -474.2 kJ/mol.

So the standard enthalpy of combustion is -474.2 kJ/mol.

But all the options are in thousands. So let me compute each option in kJ:

Option I: -114,300 cal → 114,300 *4.184 J = 478,465 J → 478.465 kJ. So option I is -478.465 kJ.

Option G: -121,500 cal → 121,500 *4.184 J = 505,350 J → 505.35 kJ. So option G is -505.35 kJ.

So the computed value is -474.2 kJ. Option I is -478.465 kJ, which is about 4.26 kJ higher. So that's the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the standard enthalpy of combustion of 1 mole of H₂, which would be -237.1 kJ/mol.

But that's not any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔH_comb = sum (ΔHf°(products)) - sum (ΔHf°(reactants)).

But I think the correct formula is:

ΔH_comb = sum (ΔHf°(products)) - sum (ΔHf°(reactants)).

Wait, no, that's the formula for the standard enthalpy of reaction. For the standard enthalpy of combustion, it's the same as the standard enthalpy of reaction because combustion is the reaction of the substance with O₂ to form the products.

Wait, but the standard enthalpy of combustion is the same as the standard enthalpy of reaction for the combustion reaction. So, yes, the formula is the same.

So, for the reaction 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l), the standard enthalpy of reaction is -474.2 kJ/mol.

So, the standard enthalpy of combustion is -474.2 kJ/mol.

But the options are all in thousands, so let me compute each option's value.

Option I: -114,300 cal → which is 114,300 cal → 114,300 *4.184 J = 478,465 J → 478.465 kJ. So option I is -478.465 kJ.

Option G: -121,500 cal → 121,500 *4.184 = 505,350 J → 505.35 kJ. So option G is -505.35 kJ.

So the computed value is -474.2 kJ, which is between option G (-505.35) and option I (-478.465).

But wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the heat of combustion of one mole of hydrogen gas, which is 237.1 kJ per mole.

Wait, but that's not any of the options. So perhaps I should think again.

Wait, maybe the confusion is between the standard enthalpy of combustion and the standard enthalpy of reaction.

Wait, but in the case of the reaction 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l), the standard enthalpy of reaction is -474.2 kJ/mol. So the standard enthalpy of combustion is the same as the standard enthalpy of reaction for this reaction.

So, the correct value is -474.2 kJ/mol, which is approximately -474 kJ.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. But option I is -478.465 kJ, which is the standard enthalpy of reaction for the same reaction.

Wait, but the standard enthalpy of reaction is -474.2 kJ/mol. So, the correct answer would be option I, which is -114,300 cal, which is the standard enthalpy of reaction for the reaction.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to think again.

The standard enthalpy of combustion is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of the substance is combusted to form CO or H₂O. For H₂, it's forming H₂O.

So, the reaction is 1 mole of H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l). The standard enthalpy of reaction for this is:

ΔH° = [1 * (-237.1)] - [1 * 0 + 0 * 0.5] = -237.1 kJ/mol.

But wait, that's the standard enthalpy of combustion for 1 mole of H₂. But that's not any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the standard enthalpy of combustion of one mole of H₂, which is -237.1 kJ/mol.

But that's not any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy of combustion is the same as the standard enthalpy of reaction. So, for the reaction 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l), the standard enthalpy of reaction is -474.2 kJ/mol.

So, the standard enthalpy of combustion is -474.2 kJ/mol.

But looking at the options, the closest is option I, which is -114,300 cal → which is -478.465 kJ.

So the difference is about 4.26 kJ.

So perhaps the correct answer is option I, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the reaction as 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l), and compute the standard enthalpy of combustion as -474.2 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the reaction as 1 mole of H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l), but that's not the same as the combustion reaction. The combustion reaction is the reverse of forming H₂O(l) from H₂ and O₂.

Wait, no, formation is H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l). Combustion is H₂ + O₂ → H₂O(l).

So, the standard enthalpy of reaction for combustion is the same as the standard enthalpy of formation of H₂O(l), but with a sign.

Wait, no, the standard enthalpy of reaction is the enthalpy change when the reaction is carried out as written.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The combustion reaction is the reaction where the substance is combusted with O₂ to form H₂O(l). So, for H₂, it's H₂ + O₂ → H₂O(l).

The standard enthalpy of reaction for this reaction is -237.1 kJ/mol.

But that's not any of the options.

Wait, but the options are all about the standard enthalpy of combustion, which is the same as the standard enthalpy of reaction for the reaction.

So, the standard enthalpy of combustion for H₂ is -237.1 kJ/mol.

But that's not any of the options.

Wait, but perhaps I should have considered that the question is about the standard enthalpy of combustion of 1 mole of H₂, which is -237.1 kJ/mol.

But that's not any of the options.

Wait, but all the options are about the standard enthalpy of combustion, which is the same as the standard enthalpy of reaction for the reaction.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the reaction as 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l), and compute the standard enthalpy of combustion as -474.2 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is because the question is about the standard enthalpy of combustion of H₂, which is the same as the standard enthalpy of reaction for the reaction.

So, the correct answer is the standard enthalpy of combustion for H₂, which is -237.1 kJ/mol.

But that's not any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate the standard enthalpy of combustion for the reaction 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l).

The standard enthalpy of combustion is the same as the standard enthalpy of reaction for the reaction.

So, the reaction is 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l).

The standard enthalpy of reaction is calculated as:

ΔH° = [2 * (-237.1)] - [2 * 0 + 1 * 0] = (-474.2) - (0) = -474.2 kJ/mol.

So, the standard enthalpy of combustion is -474.2 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, but perhaps I should have considered that the standard enthalpy of combustion is the same as the standard enthalpy of formation of H₂O(l), but with a negative sign.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation of H₂O(l) is 0 for H₂O(l), and 0 for H₂₂₂ (if it's the standard state). So, the standard enthalpy of combustion is:

ΔH_comb = [2 * (-237.1)] - [2 * 0 + 1 * 0] = -474.2 kJ/mol.

Which matches our calculation.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula:

ΔH_comb = sum (ΔHf°(products)) - sum (ΔHf°(reactants)).

Which is the formula for the standard enthalpy of reaction.

So, for the reaction 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l).

ΔH_comb = [2 * (-237.1)] - [2 * 0 + 1 * 0] = -474.2 kJ/mol.

So, the correct answer is -474.2 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this value.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in this approach. Because the question is about the standard enthalpy of combustion of H₂, which is the same as the standard enthalpy of reaction for the reaction.

So, the correct answer is the standard enthalpy of combustion for H₂, which is -237.1 kJ/mol.

But that's not any of the options.

Wait, but the options are all about the standard enthalpy of combustion, which is the same as the standard enthalpy of reaction.

So, the correct answer is the standard enthalpy of combustion for H₂, which is -237.1 kJ/mol.

But that's not any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is ΔH_comb = sum (ΔHf°(reactants)) - sum (ΔHf°(products)).

Wait, but that would give the negative of the standard enthalpy of reaction.

Wait, let me see.

If the formula is ΔH_comb = sum (ΔHf°(reactants)) - sum (ΔHf°(products)), then for the reaction 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l),

ΔH_comb = [2 * 0] - [2 * (-237.1)] = 0 - (-474.2) = 474.2 kJ/mol.

Which is the same as the standard enthalpy of reaction for the reverse reaction.

But the standard enthalpy of combustion is the same as the standard enthalpy of reaction for the reaction.

So, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is that the reaction's standard enthalpy of reaction is -474.2 kJ/mol, which is the same as the standard enthalpy of combustion.

So, the correct answer is option I, which is -114,300 cal, which is -478.465 kJ/mol.

But the correct standard enthalpy of combustion is -474.2 kJ/mol.

So, the difference is about 4.26 kJ/mol.

So, the correct answer is option I.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about the heat of combustion of 1 mole of H₂, which is -237.1 kJ/mol.

But that's not any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the reaction is:

H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l).

Wait, but the correct answer is option I, which is -114,300 cal, which is -478.465 kJ/mol.

Hmm, so the answer is option I.
</think>

The standard enthalpy of combustion of hydrogen gas (H₂) is calculated to be -474.2 kJ/mol. However, none of the provided options match this value exactly. The closest option is option I, which corresponds to -114,300 cal, approximately -478.465 kJ/mol. Although there is a slight discrepancy, option I is the best match.
