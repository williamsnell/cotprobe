Okay, so I have this question about Little's views on abortion and creation norms. I remember from my biology class that the concept of creation is a big topic. So, the question is asking what Little thinks about the signs when it comes to terminating a pregnancy.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, or D. I think Little is a proponent of abortion, right? I remember he was an philosopher or philosopher. Oh, right, he was a philosopher associated with the school of Thomas Aquinas. He believed that the act of creation is a creation of human design, so terminating it might have religious or moral implications.

Looking at the options: option A says it's a sign of respect when certain conditions aren't met because of a loving family. Hmm, I'm not sure. I thought Little would argue against the idea that it's a sign, rather than a sign. Maybe he sees it as a moral decision, not something to be respected. 

Option B says it's never a sign because we should value creation. That sounds more in line with my understanding. If Little is a proponent, he probably wouldn't say it's never a sign. He might argue that it's a matter of personal choice, not something inherently sacred.

Option C states it's a matter of personal preference. That makes sense because Little would probably argue that it's up to the individual's beliefs and circumstances, not something a family would dictate. So he might say it's not a sign, but a choice.

Wait, but the question asks which option Little argues about. So if Little doesn't think it's a sign, then which option would that be?

Wait, the options are about what Little argues. So the question is: when thinking about the norms of creation, Little argues that which of these is true.

If Little thinks it's a sign, then A would be correct. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if he thinks it's not a sign, then B or C would be correct.

Wait, I think Little's views are against the idea that abortion is a moral obligation. He might think that it's a matter of personal choice, not a universal rule. So if the question is about Little's stance, then it's more likely that the correct answer is C, because he doesn't see it as a sign but as a choice.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The question is, which option does Little argue about?

Looking at the options:

A: It can be a sign of respect to terminate a pregnancy under certain background conditions.

B: It is never a sign, because we should value creation.

C: We see abortion as a matter of personal preferences of the mother.

Hmm, so Little is a proponent of abortion, so he would not agree with B, because he would say it's a matter of personal choice. So B might be incorrect.

Option C says it's a matter of personal preferences. So Little would agree with C, but not B.

So the question is, which option is Little's argument? The options are about what he thinks.

So if the question is, "What does Little argue about the norms of creation regarding abortion?" Then, if Little is a proponent, he would not see it as a sign, so option B is incorrect, and C would be correct.

Wait, but option C says it's a matter of personal preferences, which is what Little would accept. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy. Let me think about Little's stance. From what I remember, he argues against the idea that abortion is a moral obligation. He believes it's something a person can choose based on their circumstances. So, option C is correct because Little would believe that it's not a sign but a matter of preference.

So the correct answer is C: we see the abortion issue as a matter of the personal preferences of the mother.
