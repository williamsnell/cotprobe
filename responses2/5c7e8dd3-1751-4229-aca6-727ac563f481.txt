Okay, so I've got this question here about correlations and the percentage of variation explained. Hmm, I need to figure out how the correlation of 0.6 relates to the correlation of 0.3 in terms of how much variation in y is explained by x.

Wait, I remember that the coefficient of determination, which is r squared, gives the proportion of variance explained. So for r = 0.6, the R² would be (0.6)^2, which is 0.36. And for r = 0.3, R² is (0.3)^2, which is 0.09.

The question is asking how many times the percentage explained by 0.3 is explained by 0.6. So I need to find out what factor you multiply 0.09 by to get 0.36. Let me calculate that: 0.36 / 0.09 equals 4. So that means the 0.6 correlation explains 4 times the percentage explained by 0.3. So the answer should be B: 4.

The coefficient of determination, R², is the square of the correlation coefficient. For r = 0.6, R² = 0.36 (36% of y's variation is explained by x). For r = 0.3, R² = 0.09 (9% of y's variation is explained by x). To find how many times larger 0.36 is compared to 0.09, divide 0.36 by 0.09, which equals 4. Thus, the 0.6 correlation explains 4 times as much variation as the 0.3 correlation.

Answer: B
