Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, Jack Conlon works on a salary-plus-commission basis. He gets a weekly salary of $200, and his commission is 3% of his sales. His sales for two weeks were $3,550. I need to calculate his total earnings.

Hmm, okay, first, let's break it down. His salary is fixed per week. So over two weeks, that would be 2 times $200. Let me calculate that: 2 * $200 = $400. Got that part.

Next, the commission. He makes 3% on his sales. His total sales for two weeks were $3,550. So, I need to find 3% of $3,550. To do that, I can convert 3% to a decimal, which is 0.03. Then multiply 0.03 by 3,550. Let me compute that: 3,550 * 0.03. 

Wait, 3,000 * 0.03 is 90, and 550 * 0.03 is 16.5. So adding those together, 90 + 16.5 = 106.5. So the commission is $106.50.

Now, add the salary and the commission together. So $400 (salary) + $106.50 (commission) equals $506.50. Let me check the options. Option J is $506.50. So that should be the answer. 

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to be sure. 

Calculating the commission again: 3% of 3550. 3550 * 0.03. Oh right, 3500 * 0.03 is 105, and 50 *0.03 is 1.5. So 105 + 1.5 = 106.5. Yep, that's correct. 

Adding the salary: 200 *2 = 400. 400 + 106.5 = 506.5. So option J is the answer. That makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

The correct answer is J: $506.50.
