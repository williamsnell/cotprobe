Question:

Consider a profit-maximizing firm in a perfectly competitive market with several sellers and several buyers (i.e., the firm is a "price taker" of the goods it sells and a "price taker" of the hourly wages it pays its workers). If a technological innovation made by someone in this firm were to significantly raise the firm's marginal physical product (but not that of any other firm's), then this innovation would

Options:

A: lead the firm to reduce workers' wages as they now contribute less marginal revenue
B: lead the firm to hire more workers but not to raise their wages
C: reduce the firm's employment level but raise workers' wages
D: lead the firm to hire more workers and to pay them higher wages
E: raise the workers’ hourly wage as they now contribute more marginal revenue
F: reduce the firm's employment level and lower workers' wages
G: cause the firm to hire fewer workers but pay them higher wages
H: lead the firm to hire the same number of workers but pay them higher wages
I: reduce the firm’s employment level, because fewer workers are now needed
J: have no effect on the firm's employment level or workers' wages

Okay, so I have this question about a firm in a perfectly competitive market. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

Alright, the question says the firm is a price taker, which means it's a price setter but not perfectly competitive because there are multiple sellers and buyers. So they have some influence but not the most. 

The scenario is that a technological innovation in the firm significantly raises its marginal physical product (MPP). Hmm, MPP is the additional output produced by each additional worker. So if MPP goes up, that means each worker contributes more output now.

The question is, what happens to the firm's employment level and wages? The options are about whether they hire more or fewer workers, and whether wages go up or down.

I remember that in perfectly competitive markets, firms are price takers, so the price of the product doesn't change. That means the firm's revenue per worker is based on the market price. But the firm's marginal revenue (MR) should equal its marginal cost (MC) for profit maximization. So MR is the additional revenue from hiring another worker, which is the price times the marginal product. So if MPP increases, MR increases because each additional worker brings in more revenue.

Wait, but the firm's costs depend on their wage. So the firm's marginal cost is the wage rate, because each additional worker costs the firm the same amount. 

So the firm's profit maximization condition is MR = MC. Since MR is rising (because MPP is higher), the firm wants to hire more workers until MR equals the wage.

But wait, I'm mixing up a few things. The firm's MR is equal to the price. Because in a perfectly competitive market, the firm is a price taker, so MR = P. So when the firm's MPP increases, MR increases, meaning the firm wants to hire more workers since each additional worker adds more to revenue than the cost.

But the cost is determined by the wage. If the MPP increases, then the MR (which is P*MPP) increases. So when the firm hires more workers, the additional revenue from each worker is higher than the wage. So the firm would keep hiring until the added revenue (MR) equals the wage (MC). So the firm should increase the number of workers they hire.

But what about the wage? If the MPP increases, the firm's profit per worker increases, so maybe they are willing to pay a higher wage. Wait, but wait: the firm's marginal cost is the wage. So if the MR is higher than the wage, they will hire more workers. But what's the impact on the wage? Hmm, perhaps the wage doesn't change because the firm can hire more workers as long as the MPP is higher than the wage.

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the firm's decision. The firm's goal is to maximize profit. Profit is total revenue minus total cost. Total revenue is price times quantity (which is price times number of workers times their MP). So if MPP increases, each worker's contribution to revenue increases, so for the same number of workers, revenue is higher. But the cost is the wage per worker.

So profit from each additional worker is (P*MP) - W.

So when MPP increases, (P*MP) increases, so the profit from adding each worker increases, so the firm will keep hiring until (P*MP) = W. So the profit per worker is higher when MPP is higher, so the firm can hire more workers because the additional revenue covers the wage.

Wait, but the firm is a price taker, so the price is fixed. So if MPP increases, each worker's marginal revenue is higher. So the firm will hire more workers.

But what about the wage? If the MPP increases, the firm wants to make sure that the next worker's MP still makes sense. I guess if the MPP increases, the firm may choose to hire more workers, and perhaps the wage won't change because it's based on the firm's profit structure.

Wait, but the question is about what happens in terms of the firm's decision. So the firm's choice is to increase the number of workers because the MR (which is price times MP) is higher. But the wage is determined by the point where MR equals MC. So when MR increases, the firm's MC (wage) can be lower than before because the marginal cost is the wage. Wait, no: if the MPP increases, the MR increases. So the condition is that MR (which is MR = price * MP) must equal MC (wage). So when MPP increases, MR increases, so the firm will hire more workers until MR (which is higher) equals the wage. 

Wait, but the wage is the MC, which is the cost per worker. So if the MR increases, the firm can hire more workers because the additional revenue from each worker is higher than the cost (wage). So the firm will increase the number of workers. So they would hire more workers than before. 

But the question is about whether the wage increases. If the MPP has increased, the MR is higher. The MC is the wage. So the firm will hire workers until MR equals wage. So if MPP increases, the MR at each additional worker increases. Therefore, the marginal cost would have to decrease to equal the higher MR.

Wait, wait: the firm's marginal cost is the wage, which is the cost per worker. So the firm will continue to hire workers until the MR equals the wage. So if the MPP increases, MR increases, so the firm will hire more workers because each worker now brings in more revenue, achieving higher profit. 

But what about the wage? The firm could potentially pay a higher wage if the MPP increases beyond what is necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the wage doesn't change because the firm's choice is to hire more workers regardless of the wage.

Alternatively, think of it this way: the firm's profit function is profit = (P * MP) - W * n, where n is the number of workers. So the derivative of profit with respect to n is P*MP - W. Setting this to zero: W = P*MP. So the optimal wage is the price times MP. 

If MP increases, then the optimal wage increases. So if the firm hires more workers, the wage would have to be higher because each extra worker brings in more revenue.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when MPP increases, the MR (price * MPP) increases, so the firm will keep hiring workers until MR (which is the same as the price times MPP) equals the wage. So if MPP increases, the MR is higher, so the optimal wage (W) must be higher.

So, when MPP increases, the optimal wage increases. So the firm would hire more workers, but the wage would rise.

Looking at the options, option D says: lead the firm to hire more workers and pay them higher wages. So that would be the case.

Wait, but another way to look at it: if the MPP increases, the MR increases, so the firm is willing to hire more workers. Since the wage is determined by the MR = W, any increase in MPP would require that the wage increases as well. Because, for each additional worker, the MR increases beyond what was needed before. So the firm can't get away with paying the same wage as before; it would have to pay a higher wage to keep up with the higher MR.

So the firm will hire more workers and pay them higher wages.

Looking back at the options, option D says: lead the firm to hire more workers and to pay them higher wages. So that's the correct choice.

The options are:

A: reduce workers, lower wages.

B: hire more, not raise.

C: reduce, raise.

D: hire more, raise.

E: raise, more revenue.

F: reduce, lower.

G: hire fewer, raise.

H: same, raise.

I: reduce, fewer.

J: no effect.

So the correct answer must be D.

The question involves a profit-maximizing firm in a perfectly competitive market with several sellers and buyers, operating as a price taker. A technological innovation significantly raises the firm's marginal physical product (MPP), which implies that each additional worker now contributes more output. The firm's goal is to hire more workers and pay a higher wage to maximize profit.

Key analysis:

1. **Marginal Revenue (MR):** In a perfectly competitive market, MR equals the market price (P) multiplied by the marginal product (MP). With MPP increasing, MR increases because each additional worker contributes more output, leading to higher revenue.

2. **Profit Maximization:** The firm maximizes profit when MR = MC. Here, MC is the wage rate (W). As MR increases due to the higher MPP, the firm will hire more workers until the wage rate equals the new MR.

3. **Wage Adjustment:** Since the firm's MR increases, the optimal wage rate (W) must also increase to match the higher MR. This means the firm will hire more workers and pay them higher wages to remain profitable.

4. **Eliminating Incorrect Options:** Other options are incorrect because they either suggest the opposite of what happens (e.g., hiring fewer workers or paying lower wages) or misstate the relationship between MPP, MR, and wage rates.

The correct answer is that the firm will hire more workers and pay them higher wages.
