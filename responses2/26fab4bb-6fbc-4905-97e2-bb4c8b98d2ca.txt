Okay, so I've got this problem about the decay of Uranium-238 into Thorium-234 and Helium-4. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that this is a nuclear reaction, and to find the energy released, I need to look at the mass difference between the reactants and the products. The idea is that when atoms undergo decay, some mass is converted into energy, right? So the mass defect (the difference in mass between the initial and final states) will give me the energy released via E=mc².

The given masses are:
- Uranium-238: 238.0508 amu
- Thorium-234: 234.0437 amu
- Helium-4: 4.0026 amu

Wait, but wait, when the Uranium decays, it's going from U to Th and He. So the reactants are U and probably something else, but the problem says only U and He are given. Oh, but wait, maybe the decay is written as U → Th + He. But I think in real decay, it might also involve a neutron, but the problem doesn't give that. Hmm. Wait, the problem says the equation is written as ^238_92U = ^234_90Th + ^4_2He. So maybe it's a beta decay? Because Uranium-238 typically undergoes beta decay, producing Thorium and an electron (beta particle) and an antineutrino, but in this case, perhaps it's a simpler scenario where the neutron is converted into a beta particle and an anti-nucleon? Or maybe the decay is written as U → Th + He + something else, but the problem only gives that two products are given. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed.

The problem states that the reaction is U → Th + He. So the reactant is U (U-238), and the products are Th-234 and He-4.

So the mass difference (Δm) is the mass of the reactants (U) minus the mass of the products (Th + He). Wait, wait, no. Because in nuclear reactions, the mass of the products is less than the reactants when energy is released. So the mass defect is (mass of U) - (mass of Th + He).

So let me compute that. The mass of U is 238.0508 amu. The sum of the masses of Th and He is 234.0437 + 4.0026. Let's calculate that: 234.0437 + 4.0026 = 238.0463 amu.

Wait, the mass of U is 238.0508, and the sum is 238.0463. So the mass difference is 238.0508 - 238.0463 = 0.0045 amu. Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because in beta decay, when a neutron turns into a proton and an electron (beta particle), the mass of the products (proton and electron) is less than the mass of the neutron. So the mass defect is (mass of neutron) - (mass of proton + mass of electron). And this mass difference is converted into energy.

Wait, but in this problem, the product is He-4, which is a helium nucleus, but it's not a beta particle. So maybe the decay is more like U → Th + He + something. Wait, but the problem says the reaction is U → Th + He. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed as the question gives it, and ignore the neutron, assuming that the reaction is U → Th + He. Or perhaps it's a typo and the actual decay is U → Th + He + n, but the problem doesn't specify.

But regardless, let's proceed. The mass of the products (Th + He) is 234.0437 + 4.0026 = 238.0463 amu. The reactant (U) is 238.0508 amu. So the mass difference is 238.0508 - 238.0463 = 0.0045 amu. Wait, that's a small number. But that can't be right because in reality, the energy released in beta decay is in the order of 10^-10 to 10^-6 ergs per decay.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait a second. I think I messed up the calculation. The mass of the reactant (U) is 238.0508 amu, and the products are Th (234.0437) and He (4.0026). Let me compute that:

234.0437 + 4.0026 = 238.0463. So the mass of products is 238.0463 amu. The mass of U is 238.0508 amu. So the mass difference is 238.0508 - 238.0463 = 0.0045 amu. That's 0.0045 amu. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, I remember that the energy released in nuclear reactions is calculated using the mass defect multiplied by the conversion factor. The conversion factor is E=mc². But m is in kg, and c is in m/s, but when using atomic mass units, there's a specific conversion.

The exact conversion is that 1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660 × 10^-24 grams. And because 1 gram is 10^-3 kg, so 1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

But since the energy is in ergs, and 1 erg is 1 g cm²/s². Alternatively, the conversion from amu to ergs can be calculated.

Wait, the conversion factor is 1 amu = 1.673e-24 grams (as given in the problem). And since 1 gram is 10^-3 kg, but the conversion for mass energy is mc² where c is in m/s.

Wait, the formula for energy (in ergs) is E = (delta m) * c² * (conversion factor). Wait, let me think about it. The energy released is (delta m) * c², where delta m is in grams, but since 1 gram is 1e-3 kg, and c is 3e10 cm/s.

Alternatively, to convert amu to grams and then to kilograms, and then to joules. Let me think:

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-24 grams.

Then, 1 gram is 1e-3 kg. So 1 amu is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

The speed of light, c, is 3e8 m/s. So c² is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So the energy in joules is (mass in kg) * (c² in m²/s²) → so E = m * c².

So for each amu:

E = (1.66053906660e-27 kg) * (9e16 m²/s²) = 1.66053906660e-27 * 9e16 = 1.49448516e-10 J.

To convert joules to ergs, since 1 J is 1e7 ergs, so 1.494e-10 J is 1.494e-3 ergs.

Wait, because 1e-7 erg per joule. So 1 J = 1e7 erg.

So 1.494485e-10 J * 1e7 erg/J = 1.494e-3 erg.

Wait, but this is per amu. But wait, in the problem, the mass difference is 0.0045 amu. So the energy would be 0.0045 * 1.494e-3 erg/amu ≈ 6.723e-6 erg.

Wait, wait, but let me check the exact steps again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass difference.

Wait, let me re-calculate the mass difference. The reactants: U (238.0508 amu) → products: Th (234.0437) + He (4.0026).

So sum of products: 234.0437 +4.0026 = 238.0463 amu.

U's mass: 238.0508 amu.

So mass difference (delta m) is 238.0508 - 238.0463 = 0.0045 amu.

So the mass defect is 0.0045 amu.

Each amu gives (1.673e-24 g) * (c^2) → 1.673e-24 g * (9e16 (m²/s²)) → 1.5057e-7 erg per amu.

Wait, wait, let's compute 1.673e-24 g * 9e16 m²/s² → 1.673e-24 *9e16 = 1.5057e-7 g·m²/s². Since 1 erg is 1e-7 g·cm²/s², so 1 g·m²/s² is 100 g·cm²/s² = 100 erg. So 1.5057e-7 g·m²/s² = 1.5057e-7 *100 erg = 1.5057e-5 erg. No, wait that's not correct. Let me think: 1 g·m²/s² is 100 g·cm²/s². So 1 g·m²/s² = 1e2 erg.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of 1 g·m²/s² = 1e7 erg. Because 1 erg = 1 g cm²/s² → 1 cm² = 1e-2 m². So 1 g m²/s² = (1e-2 m²) * (1 g) / s² → which is 1e-2 erg. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, let me redo the unit conversions.

Wait, 1 joule is 1 kg·m²/s². 1 kg is 1e3 g, so 1 joule = 1e3 g·m²/s². 1 erg is 1e-7 joules, so 1 erg = 1e-7 * 1e3 g·m²/s² = 1e-4 g·m²/s². So 1 g·m²/s² = 1e4 erg.

So, 1 amu is 1.6605e-24 g. Multiply by c² (9e16 m²/s²): 1.6605e-24 g * 9e16 m²/s² = 1.49445e-7 g·m²/s². 

Since 1 g·m²/s² = 1e4 erg, this is 1.49445e-7 * 1e4 erg → 1.49445e-3 erg per amu. 

So each amu gives 0.00149445 erg.

Wait, so our mass difference is 0.0045 amu. So the energy is 0.0045 * 0.00149445 erg.

Wait, no, wait, 0.0045 amu gives 0.0045 * 1.494e-3 erg. Let me compute that.

0.0045 * 0.00149445 = ?

0.0045 is 4.5e-3.

4.5e-3 * 1.49445e-3 = ?

= 4.5 * 1.49445 * 1e-6

Approximately 6.725e-6 erg.

Wait, but wait, 4.5e-3 is 0.0045. 0.0045 * 1.49445e-3 = 0.0045 * 0.00149445 = 6.724e-6 erg.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.72e-6 erg. So that would be the answer.

But let me double-check the calculation.

Mass of U: 238.0508 amu.

Th: 234.0437 amu.

He: 4.0026 amu.

Mass of products: 234.0437 +4.0026 = 238.0463 amu.

Mass difference: 238.0508 -238.0463 = 0.0045 amu.

Each amu gives (1.6605e-24 g) * (9e16 m²/s²) = 1.49445e-7 g·m²/s².

Which is 1.49445e-7 * 1e4 erg/g·m²/s² = 1.49445e-3 erg/amu.

So 0.0045 amu * 1.49445e-3 erg/amu = 0.0045 * 0.00149445 = 6.724e-6 erg.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.72 ×10^-6 erg.

So the correct answer should be option C.
</think>

To calculate the energy released in the given nuclear reaction, we start by determining the mass defect, which is the difference between the mass of the reactants (U-238) and the products (Th-234 and He-4). The masses are provided in atomic mass units (amu):

- Mass of U-238: 238.0508 amu  
- Mass of Th-234: 234.0437 amu  
- Mass of He-4: 4.0026 amu  

The total mass of the products is:

\[
\text{Mass of products} = \text{Mass of Th-234} + \text{Mass of He-4} = 234.0437 + 4.0026 = 238.0463 \, \text{amu}.
\]

The mass defect is then:

\[
\Delta m = \text{Mass of reactants} - \text{Mass of products} = 238.0508 - 238.0463 = 0.0045 \, \text{amu}.
\]

Next, we convert the mass defect to energy using the relationship \( E = \Delta m \cdot c^2 \). The conversion factor from amu to energy is:

\[
1 \, \text{amu} = 1.66053906660 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{g}.
\]

The speed of light squared (\( c^2 \)) is:

\[
c^2 = (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})^2 = 9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2.
\]

Thus, the energy per amu is:

\[
E_{\text{per amu}} = (1.66053906660 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{g}) \cdot (9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2) = 1.49448516 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{g} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2.
\]

Since \( 1 \, \text{g} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 = 10^7 \, \text{erg} \), we convert the energy per amu to erg:

\[
E_{\text{per amu}} = 1.49448516 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{g} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \cdot 10^7 \, \text{erg}/(\text{g} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2) = 1.49448516 \, \text{erg}.
\]

Finally, the energy released in the reaction is:

\[
E = \Delta m \cdot E_{\text{per amu}} = 0.0045 \, \text{amu} \cdot 1.49448516 \, \text{erg/amu} = 6.724 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{erg}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: \( 6.72 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{erg} \).**
