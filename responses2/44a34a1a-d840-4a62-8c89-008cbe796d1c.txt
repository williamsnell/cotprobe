Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about the OKS design and how it would break if file descriptors weren't passed between processes. Let's break it down.

So, the question is about what would happen if the OS didn't support file descriptor passing. The scenario is that when a process forks, the child gets a parent's file descriptor, and the parent is allowed to pass that descriptor to the child. But without that, how would the services and applications behave?

Looking at the options:

1. It would be impossible for services to get a TCP connection to the client web browser.
2. It would be impossible for okd to run as a non-root user.

The question is asking which aspects of the OKS design would break, and the options are about which statements (1 or 2) are true or false.

I remember that the OKS (OK-based Shared Address Space) is designed to allow multiple processes to share the same physical memory. But for that, it needs to know how to handle file descriptors.

In the standard OKS model, each process has a unique descriptor. If a fork creates a child process, the parent's descriptor is passed to the child. But without this, each process would have to manage its own descriptor, which might cause issues.

Let me think about service connections. For example, services on the local machine, like the web browser, would need to establish TCP connections. If the parent doesn't pass a file descriptor to the child, then the child might not be able to access the network properly. So, services might not connect correctly because they don't know how to handle incoming connections. That would mean that services can't get a TCP connection, so statement 1 would be true.

As for the second statement, if okd can't run as a non-root user, because maybe each process has to have a unique descriptor, then non-root users can't access services that require a specific socket. So, statement 2 would also be true.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think I might have mixed up something here. Oh wait, no. Without file descriptor passing, each process would have to manage its own file descriptors, which could mess up things like socket creation. For example, if a process is a child of another and doesn't have the parent's descriptor, it might not be able to bind to a socket that the parent has. But wait, in the OKS model, the parent's descriptor is used for the child. So if the child gets the parent's descriptor, then in a fork scenario, the child can use that to create a socket and bind to it. So perhaps statement 2 is not true because each process would have a descriptor, allowing non-root users to bind.

Wait, but let's think about the services. If the parent doesn't pass a file descriptor, then the child process's socket creation would rely on its own descriptor. But perhaps without a parent's descriptor, the child can't bind to a socket that's supposed to be on the network. So perhaps without the parent's descriptor, services can't connect because the child doesn't know how to handle incoming connections.

So, statement 1 would be correct because services can't establish TCP connections because the parent's descriptor isn't passed, and the child can't get the necessary socket information.

As for statement 2, non-root users can't run okd because each process needs a unique descriptor. So each process would have its own socket, and a non-root user can't bind to a parent's socket. But wait, in the scenario described, each process gets a parent's descriptor. So perhaps each process has its own socket, and a non-root user would be able to bind to any parent's socket. Or no, wait, each process would have a descriptor, but perhaps the parent's descriptor is used only for child processes. So maybe each process only has a descriptor, but the parent's descriptor is given to the child. So non-root users can bind to any parent's socket because each process has its own descriptor.

Wait, this part is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of the tasks each process can do. For example, the web browser (a service) would need to establish a TCP connection on the local machine's port. If the parent doesn't pass a file descriptor, the child (the child process) can't bind to the correct socket, because it doesn't know how to read or write data. So the services can't connect, so statement 1 is correct.

As for statement 2, non-root users can run okd. Because each process has a descriptor, they can bind to the parent's socket, allowing non-root users to run their own applications, like the browser.

Wait, but without the parent's descriptor, each process would have their own. So non-root users could run their own okd. So statement 2 would be false because a non-root user can run okd.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Hmm. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the question says that the parent allows inheritance of file descriptors. So when a child process executes a command, it gets the parent's descriptor as a by-reference. So for services, like web browsers, the child would have to bind to the parent's socket. But if the parent's descriptor isn't passed, the child wouldn't have it, so it can't bind to the required socket. So services can't establish TCP connections because the child's socket isn't configured correctly. So statement 1 is correct.

As for statement 2, non-root users can run okd because each process has its own descriptor, allowing them to bind to the parent's socket. So statement 2 would be false because a non-root user can run okd.

Wait, but what about the services? For example, a web browser needs to connect to a particular port, say 80. If the parent doesn't pass a descriptor, the child can't bind to that port. So services can't get the connection. So statement 1 is correct.

For statement 2, non-root users can run okd. Because each process has a descriptor, and the parent's descriptor is passed, the child can bind to any parent's socket. So statement 2 is incorrect because non-root users can't run okd, maybe because their own files might not have the parent's descriptor set?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option says.

Option 1 says it's impossible for services to get a TCP connection to the client. So services can't connect to the client, which is a web browser. So services would be unable to establish a connection because the parent's descriptor isn't passed, and the child can't get the necessary socket information.

Option 2 says it's impossible for okd to run as a non-root user. So non-root users can't access services that require a specific socket, like the web browser.

But in the scenario, each process has its own descriptor. So non-root users can bind to any parent's socket. So statement 2 is false because non-root users can run okd.

Alternatively, perhaps each process gets a descriptor, but the parent's descriptor is only used by the child to bind to the child's socket. So each process has a descriptor, allowing non-root users to bind to any parent's socket. So statement 2 is false.

So statements 1 is true, and 2 is false.

Looking back at the question, the options are A to J, each with a pair of 'True' or 'False' for statements 1 and 2.

So the answer would be A: True, False.

Wait, but let me think again. If each process has a unique descriptor, then non-root users can bind to any parent's socket. So statement 2 is false because non-root users can run okd as expected.

Wait, but statement 2 says it's impossible for okd to run as a non-root user. So if non-root users can run okd, then statement 2 is false.

So the correct options would have statement 1 as true and statement 2 as false.

Looking back at the options:

Which options have statement 1 true and 2 false?

Looking at the answer options:

Option A: True, False â†’ matches our analysis.

So the correct answer is option A.

The question examines how the OKS design would break if file descriptors were not passed between processes. In this scenario, each child process inherits a parent's file descriptor, allowing it to create a socket and bind to it. However, the absence of file descriptor passing would lead to several consequences.

1. **Services cannot establish TCP connections**: Without file descriptors, the child processes would lack the necessary information to bind to the correct socket on the network. Services like a web browser would fail to connect to the client because the child processes do not know how to read or write data on the network. Thus, statement 1 is **true**.

2. **Non-root users cannot run okd**: Each process has its own descriptor, allowing non-root users to bind to any parent's socket. Therefore, non-root users can run applications like the web browser as intended. Statement 2 is **false**.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A: True, False**
