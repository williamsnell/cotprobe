Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the value of 1/m + 1/n where m and n are roots of the quadratic equation 2x² +15x +16=0. Hmm, I remember that for quadratic equations, there are some formulas related to sum and product of roots. Let me think.

First, the equation is 2x² +15x +16=0. The standard form is ax² +bx +c=0. So here, a=2, b=15, c=16.

I recall that for any quadratic equation, the sum of roots m + n is equal to -b/a. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Yes, sum of roots is -b/a. And the product of the roots is c/a. So, m + n = -15/2, which is -7.5, and mn = 16/2 =8.

But the question asks for 1/m +1/n. Let's write that as (m +n)/(mn). Because 1/m +1/n = (n + m)/(mn). Oh right, that's a formula I learned. So substituting the values I have, m + n is -7.5 and mn is 8. So 1/m +1/n = (-7.5)/8.

Let me compute that. 7.5 divided by 8 is 0.9375. But since it's negative, it's -0.9375. Let me check if that's one of the options. Looking at the options, option G is -0.9375. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, did I do that right? Let me go through it again. Sum is m +n = -b/a = -15/2 = -7.5. Product mn= c/a=16/2=8. Then, 1/m +1/n = (m +n)/(mn) = (-7.5)/8. So yeah, that's -7.5/8. Let me compute that division. 7.5 divided by 8 is 0.9375. So negative that gives -0.9375. Yep, that's option G.

The correct answer is G: -0.9375.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Quadratic Equation:** The given equation is 2x² + 15x + 16 = 0, where a = 2, b = 15, and c = 16.

2. **Sum of Roots (m + n):** Using the formula for quadratic equations, the sum of the roots is -b/a. Thus, m + n = -15/2 = -7.5.

3. **Product of Roots (mn):** The product of the roots is c/a, which is 16/2 = 8.

4. **Compute 1/m + 1/n:** This can be expressed as (m + n)/(mn). Substituting the values:
   1/m + 1/n = (-7.5)/8 = -0.9375.

5. **Match to Options:** The value -0.9375 corresponds to option G.

**Answer:** G: -0.9375
