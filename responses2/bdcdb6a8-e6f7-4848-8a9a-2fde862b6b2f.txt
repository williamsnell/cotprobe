Okay, so I've got this question about group theory. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down step by step. The question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false. Then, I'll have to pick the correct option from A to J based on whether both are true, both false, or one true and the other false.

Let me start with Statement 1. It says: If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G, then aH is a subgroup of G if and only if a is in H. Hmm. So, I remember that for a subset aH to be a subgroup of G, certain conditions must be met. One of the key properties is that aH must be closed under the group operation and taking inverses. 

Wait, actually, the condition for aH being a subgroup is that H is a subgroup, and a is an element of H. Because if a is in H, then aH = H, which is obviously a subgroup. But the other way around—if aH is a subgroup, then a must be in H. Because if a isn't in H, then aH would have a different structure. 

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Suppose H is a subgroup, and a is an element of G. Then, aH is a left coset of H. For aH to be a subgroup, aH must satisfy the subgroup criteria. Let's check: if a is in H, then aH = H, which is a subgroup. Now, if a is not in H, then aH is a different coset. However, for aH to be a subgroup, it must contain the identity element of G. But aH contains aH * identity = aH. So, unless a is the identity, aH would not contain the identity, which is necessary for being a subgroup. So, if a isn't in H, aH won't be a subgroup. Therefore, the statement is correct. So Statement 1 is true.

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me think again. Suppose a is in H, then aH is H, which is a subgroup. But if a is not in H, then aH is a different coset. For aH to be a subgroup, it must be closed under the group operation. Let’s take two elements from aH, say a h1 and a h2. Their product is a h1 * a h2 = a (h1 a) h2. But since a is not in H, this might not be in aH. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the identity element. The identity is in H, so aH must contain the identity. So, a * h = e for some h in H. That would imply h = a^{-1}, so a must be in H. Because h is in H, so a is in H. So yes, only when a is in H, aH is a subgroup. So Statement 1 is true.

Okay, moving to Statement 2: If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then aH = bH if and only if ab is in H. Hmm. Let me think about this. 

First, let me recall that aH = bH means that every element of aH is in bH and vice versa. So, aH = bH implies that a is in bH and b is in aH.

Wait, another approach: aH equals bH if and only if a^{-1}b is in H. Because aH = bH implies aH b^{-1} = H, which is equivalent to a^{-1}b being in H. So, a^{-1}b ∈ H. That would imply that ab^{-1} ∈ H^{-1} = H, so ab^{-1} ∈ H. Or, multiplying both sides by b, a b^{-1} b = a ∈ b H. Wait, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, aH = bH. So, for any h in H, there exists some k in H such that a h = b k. Rearranging, a b^{-1} = k h^{-1}. Since k and h are in H, and H is a subgroup, then k h^{-1} is in H. So, a b^{-1} is in H. So, a b^{-1} ∈ H implies that a ∈ H b. But aH equals bH implies that a^{-1}b ∈ H. Because aH = bH implies that b = a (a^{-1}b) → maybe that's not right. Alternatively, since aH = bH, then aH = bH implies that a^{-1}b ∈ H. Because a^{-1}b = h where h ∈ H, so a^{-1}b is in H.

Wait, no, let's think about it. If aH = bH, then for any h in H, h is in aH, so h = a k for some k in H. So, h = a k → a k = h. Similarly, since bH = aH, every element of bH is in aH. So, b k' = a k'' for some k', k'' in H. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should consider the equivalence.

If aH = bH, then aH = bH implies that a^{-1}b is in H. Because aH = bH → a^{-1}b ∈ H. Because taking the inverse of both sides: (aH)^{-1} = (bH)^{-1} → H a^{-1} = H b^{-1}, which implies a^{-1}b is in H. So, a^{-1}b ∈ H → ab^{-1} ∈ H^{-1} = H since H is a subgroup. So, ab^{-1} ∈ H. But the condition is that aH = bH if and only if ab is in H. Wait, wait. Let me check the original statement: "aH = bH if and only if ab is in H."

Wait, if a^{-1}b is in H, then multiplying both sides by b on the right: a^{-1}b b = a^{-1} b^2. Hmm, that doesn’t directly give anything. Alternatively, since a^{-1}b ∈ H, then ab ∈ H^{-1} = H because H is a subgroup. So, ab ∈ H. So, aH = bH implies that ab ∈ H. So, the "if" part is correct.

But the "only if" part: if ab ∈ H, then aH = bH. Let me see. If ab is in H, then a = b h for some h in H. Then, aH = (b h) H = b (h H) = b H. Because multiplying a subgroup by a fixed element b stays within the same coset. So, aH = b H. So, the "only if" part is also correct. Therefore, the equivalence holds. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait a second, let me test with an example. Let G be S3, and H be A3. Let a be a transposition, say (1 2), and b be the identity. Then aH would be the set { (1 2), (1 2)(1 2 3) } = { (1 2), (1 3 2) }. Similarly, bH is just H, so aH and bH are different. But ab is a * e = a, which is not in H (since H is A3, which has only even permutations). Wait, but in this case, ab is not in H. So, this example doesn't fit Statement 2's condition. So, perhaps I should choose a different a and b.

Wait, let me think of a and b such that ab is in H. Suppose H is A3, and a is an even permutation, and b is an even permutation. Then ab is even, so ab is in H. Let a = identity (even), b = identity. Then aH = H, bH = H. So aH = bH. That's correct.

Another example: Let H be the group {e, a, a^2} where a^3=e. Let a be an element of order 3. Let H = {e, a, a^2}, and let b = a. Then ab = a * a = a^2. Since a^2 is in H (as H is closed under multiplication), ab is in H.

Then, aH = {a e, a a, a a^2} = {a, a^2, a^3} = {a, a^2, e} = H. Similarly, bH = aH = H. So aH = bH.

So, that works. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another thought comes to mind. Suppose H is a subgroup, and a and b are elements such that ab is in H. Does aH = bH?

Wait, if ab is in H, then a = b h for some h in H. Then, aH = (b h) H = b (h H) = b H. So, aH = b H, which is correct. So, yes, the condition holds.

So, both statements are true. Therefore, the answer is A: True, True.
</think>

The analysis of both statements leads to the conclusion that each statement is true.

**Statement 1:** If \( H \) is a subgroup of \( G \) and \( a \in G \), then \( aH \) is a subgroup of \( G \) if and only if \( a \in H \). This is true because for \( aH \) to be a subgroup, it must contain the identity and be closed under the group operation. If \( a \) is in \( H \), then \( aH = H \), which is a subgroup. Conversely, if \( aH \) is a subgroup, then \( a \) must be in \( H \) to ensure the subgroup condition.

**Statement 2:** If \( H \) is a subgroup of \( G \) and \( a, b \in G \), then \( aH = bH \) if and only if \( ab \in H \). This is true because if \( aH = bH \), then \( a^{-1}b \in H \), which implies \( ab^{-1} \in H \). Additionally, if \( ab \in H \), then \( aH = bH \) since multiplying by \( b \) (a fixed element in \( H \)) preserves the coset.

**Conclusion:** Both statements are true.
