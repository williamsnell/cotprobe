Question:

A mechanic agreed in writing to make repairs to a landscaper's truck for $12,000. The mechanic properly made the repairs, but when the landscaper tendered payment, the mechanic refused to deliver the truck unless the landscaper promised to pay an additional $2,000. The customary charge for such work was $14,000. Because the landscaper needed the truck immediately to fulfill existing contractual obligations, and because no rental trucks of the same type were available, the landscaper promised in writing to pay the mechanic an additional $2,000. The mechanic then delivered the truck. Will the mechanic be able to enforce the landscaper's promise to pay the additional $2,000?

Options:

A: No, because the mechanic breached the original contract by demanding extra payment.
B: Yes, because the landscaper could have obtained possession of the truck through legal action rather than by agreeing to the increased payment.
C: No, because the mechanic exploited the landscaper's immediate need for the truck.
D: No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.
E: Yes, because the final price is equivalent to the customary charge for such work.
F: No, because the original contract did not include the additional $2,000 payment.
G: Yes, because the landscaper agreed in writing to pay the additional cost.
H: Yes, because the mechanic completed the repairs as agreed.
I: Yes, because the modified contract price did not exceed a reasonable price.
J: No, because the mechanic exerted undue influence over the landscaper with respect to the modification.

Okay, so I've got a contract law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the question again.

So, a mechanic agreed to repair a truck for $12,000. He did the repairs properly. But when the landscaper paid, the mechanic didn't deliver unless the landscaper promised another $2,000. The usual charge was $14,000. But because the landscaper needed the truck immediately, they promised to pay extra. The mechanic then delivered it. The question is whether the mechanic can enforce the extra $2k.

Hmm, so I remember that contracts can be modified under certain conditions. Let me think about the different rules. So the original contract was $12k. But the mechanic asked for an extra payment of $2k, totaling $14k, which is the usual charge. So he's essentially agreeing to a higher price.

The key here is whether the mechanic breached the original contract by demanding more. If he did, then the extra $2k could be a breach, leading to the contract being modified.

Wait, but under the contract law, if the contract is modified by either party breaching, sometimes the modification is enforceable. But in this case, the mechanic agreed to a higher price because of the reason provided: the need for immediate payment.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the original contract is $12k, and the revised contract is $14k. But the mechanic agreed to $14k because the landscaper needed the truck right away. So the revised contract is higher than the original.

But the situation is that the mechanic agreed to the higher price because of the reason given. So the modification is based on the reason of breach, not the terms. Wait, but this is a bit tricky.

Wait, no, because the contract is being modified, but the reason is a breach, not the modification. But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think.

In contract law, a contract can be modified if either party breaches the original contract. But here, the mechanic didn't breach the original contract; he agreed to a higher price because of the reason. So the modification is not a breach but an offer to increase the price. But under some rules, an offer to increase the price may be considered a breach if it's not in the original contract's terms.

Wait, but the original contract's terms were $12k. The mechanic agreed to $14k, which is higher. So, the mechanic didn't breach the original contract by demanding more, because he didn't violate the original terms. Instead, he agreed to a higher price because the reason for that was his own breach of the contract.

Wait, no. The original contract was $12k. The mechanic agreed to $14k because he thought it was necessary for the immediate payment. So the mechanic didn't breach the original contractâ€”because he didn't violate the terms. He just agreed to a higher price because of the reason.

Wait, but the reasoning goes that a contract modification is only valid if the modification is made because of a breach. If the modification is just to increase the price, then it's not based on a breach but on the parties' mutual agreement.

But wait, the original contract was $12k. The mechanic agreed to $14k because the reason was the need for payment. So maybe this is a modification that is enforceable.

Alternatively, under some rules, parties may agree to modify a contract based on mutual agreement or the necessity of the contract, which can make the modification enforceable. So in this case, the mechanic agreed to a higher price based on the need for payment, which is a necessary condition. So the modification is valid, and the mechanic can enforce the increased price.

But wait, another point is whether the modification is a contract subsequent. Because the contract is being modified, but it's not clear if it's a contract subsequent or a contract modification. Oh wait, the question says the mechanic agreed to a higher payment, which is a modification. So the mechanic can enforce the modification.

Alternatively, another case is the consideration rule. The parties must have mutual consideration for the modification. Since the mechanic agreed to pay extra, that's his consideration. But I think in this case, the mechanic's agreement is a valid consideration for the modification, so the modification is enforceable.

Wait, but what about the original contract's terms? If the contract had a higher price, and the mechanic agreed to pay more, maybe this is a contract modification. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, maybe the contract is modified because the mechanic agreed to pay more, which is a new price. So the modification is valid because it's a new consideration. So the mechanic can enforce the increased price.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about the possible answers.

Looking at the options:

A: No, because the mechanic breached the original contract by demanding extra payment. So here, A says the mechanic breached the original contract, which would mean he must have breached the terms, but the mechanic didn't; he agreed. So if the mechanic breached the original contract, the answer would be A. But in this case, the mechanic didn't breach the original contract; he only agreed to a higher price because of the reason.

B: Yes, because the landscaper could have obtained possession through legal action rather than by agreeing. So the mechanic didn't breach the original contract, so that's not applicable.

C: No because he exploited the need for the truck. Exploitation is a different issue; this is about breach of contract.

D: No because the landscaper had no alternative. But the reason was the mechanic's request, so that's not a valid reason.

E: Yes because the modified price was equivalent. But the original contract had a higher price. So the modified price is different, so E isn't correct.

F: No because the contract didn't include the increase. No, the contract did have a higher price, so F is incorrect.

G: Yes because the landscaper agreed to pay extra. That's a yes, but I'm not sure if that's the correct reason.

H: Yes because he completed repairs as agreed. But that's about the completion, not breach.

I: Yes because he exerted influence. Influence doesn't directly affect the contract unless it's a breach.

J: No because he influenced the landscaper. Influence doesn't typically make the contract invalid.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again. The mechanic agreed to pay more because the reason was the need for payment. So that's a modification, not a breach. So the mechanic didn't breach the original contract. So the answer isn't J (if the mechanic influenced), because influence isn't a breach unless it's a contract modification.

Wait, but under the contract modification rule, if you have a mutual agreement to change terms, and that change is based on mutual consideration, then it's valid. So in this case, the mechanic agreed to a higher price, which is a consideration. So the modification is valid, and the mechanic can enforce it.

So the correct answer would be that the mechanic can enforce the increased price. Looking at the options, option H says "Yes, because the mechanic completed the repairs as agreed." That's about the completion, not the breach.

But another thought: the mechanic didn't breach the original contract, so no. So the mechanic can enforce the extra charge.

Wait, but there's a rule about whether the modification is a contract subsequent. So the original contract is for $12k. The mechanic agreed to a higher price because of the need for payment. So that's a contract modification, which is valid. So yes, the mechanic can enforce the extra.

So which option says that? Let me look again.

Option H says "Yes, because the mechanic completed the repairs as agreed." That's about completion, not about the contract modification.

Option F says "No because the original didn't include the increase." No, that's incorrect because the contract did include the increased price.

Option E says "Yes because the modified price was equivalent." No, because 14k is higher than 12k.

Option D says "No because the landscaper had no alternative." No, because the mechanic's request was the reason.

Option G says "Yes because the landscaper agreed to pay an extra." That's correct in that the mechanic agreed to pay extra. But does that alone suffice? Or does the fact that the contract was modified by agreement to a higher price make it enforceable?

Wait, the modification is based on mutual agreement. So the modification is a valid contract modification, and the mechanic can enforce it.

So the correct answer is that the mechanic can enforce the extra payment. Looking at the options, option H says the mechanic completed repairs as agreed, which is true, but that's not the reason. There's another option, perhaps.

Wait, the options are presented as possible answers, so the question is whether the mechanic can enforce the extra payment.

Wait, let me look again at the options.

The options are A to J. The correct answer is whether the mechanic can enforce the extra $2k.

So, the mechanic agreed to pay a higher price because of the need for the truck. So the contract is modified by agreement to a higher price. Since this is a contract modification, the modification is enforceable. So the answer should be that the mechanic can enforce.

Looking at the options:

Option G says "Yes, because the landscaper agreed in writing to pay the additional cost." That's correct because the mechanic agreed to pay extra, which is a valid consideration for the modification. So the mechanic can enforce the modified price.

Alternatively, option H says "Yes because he completed repairs as agreed." Well, that's about the completion, not the modification. So the damage is that the mechanic delivered the truck, but is that a breach or a modification?

Wait, in this scenario, the mechanic didn't breach the original contract. He agreed to a higher price because of the need for payment. So the modification is valid, so the answer is yes.

So which option is correct?

Looking again, the options:

A: No, because he breached the original contract. Incorrect, because he didn't breach.

B: Yes, because the landscaper could have gotten possession otherwise. No, the reason was the breach.

C: No because he exploited the need. No, it's about breach, not exploit.

D: No because the landscaper had no alternative. No.

E: Yes, because the modified price was equivalent. No.

F: No because the original didn't include the extra. No.

G: Yes, because the landscaping agreed in writing to pay extra. Yes, that's correct.

H: Yes because he completed repairs as agreed. Partially correct, but the reason was a modification, not a breach.

So the mechanic can enforce the modified price because of the mutual agreement. So the correct answer is G, because the mechanic agreed to pay the extra, which is a valid consideration for the modification.

Wait, but the mechanic's agreement is a contract modification, which is enforceable. So the answer is G.

Wait, but another factor: did the mechanic breach the original contract? He didn't; he agreed to a higher price because of the need. So the mechanic didn't breach the original contract. So the answer is G.

Wait, but there's another angle. The contract modification is a contract subsequent. So the new agreement is enforceable. So the answer is G.
</think>

The mechanic agreed to pay an additional $2,000, making the total contract price $14,000, which is the customary charge. However, the mechanic did not breach the original contract, as he merely agreed to a higher price based on the need for the truck. The modification to the contract is enforceable under contract law, as it is based on mutual agreement and consideration. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The mechanic did not breach the original contract by demanding extra payment.
- **B**: Incorrect. The mechanic did not seek possession through legal action; the reason was the modification.
- **C**: Incorrect. The mechanic did not exploit the need for payment.
- **D**: Incorrect. The mechanic did not yield to the mechanic's request; they agreed to pay extra.
- **E**: Incorrect. The modified price was higher than the original contract, so it is not equivalent.
- **F**: Incorrect. The original contract included the increased price.
- **G**: Correct. The mechanic agreed to pay an additional $2,000, which is a valid consideration for the modification.
- **H**: Partially correct but not the best answer. While the mechanic completed repairs, the modification is based on agreement, not breach.
- **J**: Incorrect. Influence does not typically render a contract invalid.

The correct answer is **G**, as the mechanic's agreement to pay an additional $2,000 constitutes a valid contract modification based on mutual consideration.

ANSWER: G
