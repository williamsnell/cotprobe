Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Source 1:
"Moreover, Sir, in our Kingdoms there is another great inconvenience which is of little service to God, and this is that many of our people, keenly desirous as they are of the wares and things of your Kingdoms, which are brought here by your people, and in order to satisfy their voracious appetite, seize many of our people, freed and exempt men, and very often it happens that they kidnap even noblemen and our relatives, and take them to be sold to the white men who are in our kingdoms."
Letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal, 1526
Source 2:
"This expedition has cost us much: it would be unreasonable to send it home with empty hands. Although our [principal] wish is to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo, none the less you will make him understand—as though speaking in our name—what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, or copper, or ivory."

Okay, let's see. I have this multiple-choice question about diplomatic relations between Portugal and Kongo. I remember the question refers to two letters from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal, written in 1526, and another from King Manuel of Portugal to his Kongo envoy in 1512. Hmm.

So, the first letter is from Kongo. It says that a lot of Portuguese noblemen and relatives kidnap them, making them sold to white men in Portugal. That sounds like a serious problem, maybe leading to more conflicts or protests.

The second letter is from Portugal. It's saying that sending the expedition would be unreasonable because they want God and the Kongo king. So, perhaps they wanted to serve the Portuguese king, but the instructions are to send it home without empty hands. So maybe the Portuguese wanted to have the Kongo side help, but the Kongo side was complaining about the lack of supplies and the kidsnap.

Now, the question is which conclusion these letters support. The options are about diplomatic relations, trade, etc.

Option A: Diplomatic relations were cordial. Hmm, but the second letter suggests Kongo was complaining about something, implying that perhaps the Portuguese wanted to have Kongo involved, but the Kongo side was upset. So, maybe diplomatic relations were not as good as they thought, but it doesn't necessarily mean they were cordial. It could mean that the Portuguese wanted to have a lot of conflict, but Kongo was resistant.

Option B: Kongo noblemen were frequently taken as slaves. Well, the first letter says that many Kongo noblemen are taken by Portuguese freed men, even noblemen. So the Portuguese are taking them as slaves. That seems to support B.

Option C: Trade between Portugal and Kongo was highly regulated. Wait, the first letter mentions that the Portuguese are being taken to be sold, which might not directly indicate regulation. Perhaps it's more about the lack of resources. The second letter says that the Portuguese wanted God and the king to be served, perhaps implying that Kongo is giving up something, but the first letter talks more about the kidnaping. So maybe regulation isn't the main point here.

Option D: Trade was brisk with both parties. The first letter says the Portuguese are being taken by noblemen, which could mean that their demand is high. However, the second letter suggests that the Portuguese wanted to send the expedition but might not have succeeded. The trade's speed isn't directly supported by the letters, but perhaps the first letter indicates that Kongo is being taken, which might imply that the Portuguese are trying to take their own people, indicating a competitive situation.

Wait, when the second letter comes, it says that the Portuguese had an envoy from Kongo, so perhaps the Portuguese wanted to send an envoy, but the Kongo side is complaining about the kidnaping. So maybe they wanted the Kongo side to supply resources, but Kongo is complaining. That could mean that there was some conflict, so perhaps the trade wasn't as smooth as they hoped. Or maybe the trade wasn't as brisk because both sides are opposing each other.

But the main point is about what the letters support. The first letter says that Kongo's noblemen are being taken by Portuguese freed men, which supports that the Portuguese are taking the Kongo noblemen. So that's a direct support for B.

The second letter says that because they wanted to serve God and the Portuguese king, but the Portuguese were not complying with sending the expedition. Wait, but the second letter is from the Portuguese, so he's sending the envoy, but the Kongo side is complaining about the kidnaping. So perhaps the Portuguese wanted to send the envoy, but Kongo's side is upset because they're being taken.

Wait, but the second letter is from the Portuguese. So perhaps the Portuguese wanted to send the envoy, but Kongo's side was protesting because they were taken. So that might indicate that the Portuguese wanted the Kongo to help, but it's not clear if that's about trade or just a diplomatic conflict.

So, with the letters given, the direct point is that Kongo's noblemen are being taken by Portuguese freed men. That's a direct support for B.

So the correct answer is B.

The two letters address diplomatic tensions between Portugal and Kongo. The first letter from Kongo indicates that Portuguese noblemen are being taken by Kongo noblemen, highlighting Kongo's resistance. The second letter from Portugal suggests that Kongo's side is upset and may have demanded resources or assistance, possibly indicating a conflict of interest. While the letters do not explicitly state that the trade between the two nations was highly regulated or brisk, the direct evidence that Portuguese noblemen are being taken by Kongo noblemen strongly supports the idea that Kongo noblemen are frequently taken as slaves by Portuguese freed men.
