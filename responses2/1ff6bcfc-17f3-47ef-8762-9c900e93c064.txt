Okay, so I've got this question here where I need to find which number among the options is a multiple of 7. The options are A through J, each with a different number. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a multiple of 7 is any number that can be divided by 7 without leaving a remainder. So, for each number, I can check if dividing it by 7 gives an integer result.

Let me list out the options again to make it easier: A is 27, B is 74, C is 56, D is 83, E is 111, F is 61, G is 48, H is 102, I is 94, and J is 75.

I think the best way is to go through each one and see if it's divisible by 7. Alternatively, maybe there's a trick to quickly check if a number is a multiple of 7 without doing long division each time.

Wait, another idea: sometimes, for checking divisibility by 7, you can take the last digit, double it, subtract it from the rest of the number, and see if the result is divisible by 7. But I'm not sure if I should try that for all the options or just pick the quickest one.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate each number divided by 7 to see if it's an integer. Let's try that.

Starting with option A: 27 divided by 7. 7 times 3 is 21, and 7 times 4 is 28. So 27 is between 21 and 28. 27-21=6, so 27/7 is 3 and 6/7, which is not an integer. So A is not a multiple.

Option B: 74. Let's see, 7 times 10 is 70. 74-70=4. So 74/7 is 10 and 4/7, which is not an integer. So B isn't a multiple.

Option C: 56. Hmm, 7 times 8 is 56. Oh wait, that's exactly 7 multiplied by 8, so 56 is definitely a multiple of 7. So is this the answer?

Wait, but let me check the other options just to be sure. I shouldn't jump to conclusions without checking.

Option D: 83. Let's divide 83 by 7. 7*11=77, 83-77=6. So 83 is 11 and 6/7, which is not an integer. So D isn't a multiple.

Option E: 111. 7*15=105, 111-105=6. So 111/7 is 15 and 6/7. Not an integer. E is out.

Option F: 61. 7*8=56, 61-56=5. So 61/7=8 and 5/7. Not integer. F is not a multiple.

Option G: 48. Let's see, 7*6=42, 48-42=6. So 48 is 6 and 6/7. Not a multiple. G is out.

Option H: 102. 7*14=98. 102-98=4. So 102=14 and 4/7. Not a multiple. H is not.

Option I: 94. 7*13=91. 94-91=3. So 94=13 and 3/7. Not a multiple. I is not.

Option J: 75. Let's see, 7*10=70, 75-70=5. So 75=10 and 5/7. Not a multiple. J isn't either.

So the only number that is a multiple of 7 is option C, which is 56. That makes sense because 7 times 8 is 56. So the correct answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: 56, as it is a multiple of 7.

Answer: C
