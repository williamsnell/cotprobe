Question:

Jacob and Sons Plumbing bought a forklift for $10,000. The forklift is expected to last 5 years, and to have a residual value of $3,000. Jacob wishes to use the straight line depreciation method, while his sons wish to use the sum-of-the-years'-digits method. What will the difference in the depreciation allowances be for the third year?

Options:

A: $600
B: zero
C: $500
D: $150
E: $400
F: $200
G: $250
H: $300
I: $350
J: $100

Alright, so I've got this question about forklift depreciation methods. Hmm, Jacob and Sons and their sons are using different methods. Let me think through this step by step.

The forklift was bought for $10,000 and it's expected to last 5 years with a residual value of $3,000. We need to find the difference in depreciation allowances for the third year between the straight-line and sum-of-the-years'-digits methods.

First, I'll recall what each method entails.

Straight-line depreciation is when the asset's cost minus residual value is spread evenly over its useful life. So the annual depreciation is (Cost - Residual) / Life.

Sum-of-years'-digits is a method where the depreciation isn't even. Instead, it's based on the sum of the years remaining. For example, in 5 years, the sum is 1+2+3+4+5=15. Each year's depreciation is based on (Year number / sum) * (Cost - Residual).

So, for each method, I'll calculate the third year's depreciation.

Let's do the straight-line first. Cost is $10k, residual $3k, life 5 years.

Straight-line annual depreciation = (10,000 - 3,000)/5 = 7,000 /5 = $1,400 per year. So year 3 would be $1,400.

Now the sum-of-years'-digits. The sum for 5 years is 15. So for each year, the fraction is year number / 15.

Year 1: 1/15. Year 2: 2/15. Year 3: 3/15. Let's compute the third year's depreciation.

Depreciation for year 3 = (3/15) * (10,000 -3,000) = (3/15)*7,000.

Simplify 3/15 is 1/5. So 7,000 * (1/5) = 1,400 again. Oh wait, same as straight line. Oh, but wait, that's not right. Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake because I thought each method might give different third year amounts, but here they're the same. But wait, the options don't have zero as the difference.

Wait, let's double-check. Oh wait, no, that's because in this case, the residual value is the same, so the calculations align. Because both methods are using the same cost, residual, and life. So, for year 3, both methods give 1,400.

Wait, but wait, no, that can't be right because I remember that the sum-of-years' method gives a higher depreciation in early years. So maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no, wait again. Let me recalculate the sum-of-years' digits for the third year.

Sum is 15. So:

Year 1: 1/15 *7k= 466.6667

Year 2: 2/15 *7k= 933.3333

Year 3: 3/15 *7k= 1,400

Same as straight line. So the difference would be zero. But wait, that's the same as straight line. So the difference is $0.

Wait the options include B: zero. So the answer would be B?

But wait, the question says Jacob and Sons use straight line, his sons sum of the years digits. So their depreciation in third year is same, so difference is zero.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm missing something because the residual value and life might be different. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, for the sum-of-years' digits, the total is 1+2+3+4+5=15. So each year's fraction is year number over 15.

So year 3 is 3/15 = 1/5. 7k *1/5 = 1,400. Same as straight line. So the difference is zero.

So the correct answer would be B: zero.

The question involves calculating the depreciation allowances for the third year using the straight-line and sum-of-years'-digits methods, respectively, and determining the difference between the two. 

For the **straight-line method**, the annual depreciation is calculated as:
\[
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Residual Value}}{\text{Useful Life}} = \frac{10,000 - 3,000}{5} = 1,400 \, \text{per year}.
\]
Thus, the depreciation for the third year is **$1,400**.

For the **sum-of-years'-digits method**, the depreciation is based on the sum of the years remaining, which is \(1+2+3+4+5=15\). The depreciation for the third year is:
\[
\text{Depreciation} = \left(\frac{3}{15}\right) \times (10,000 - 3,000) = \frac{3}{15} \times 7,000 = 1,400 \, \text{per year}.
\]
Therefore, the depreciation for the third year is also **$1,400**.

Since both methods yield the same depreciation allowance for the third year, the difference between the two methods is **$0**.
