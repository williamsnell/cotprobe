Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the normal respiratory rate for an adult male. I remember that respiratory rate is how many breaths a person takes in a minute. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers, so I'll have to think carefully.

First, I recall that the average respiratory rate for a healthy adult male is around 15-20 breaths per minute. That seems right because when you're at rest, you take about that many breaths. But I'm not entirely sure if it's 15-20 or maybe a lower or higher range.

Looking at the options provided:

A: 20-22
B: 24-26
C: 26-28
D: 14-16
E: 12-14
F: 10-12
G: 22-24
H: 8-10
I: 16-18
J: 18-20

So, the options are A to J with various ranges. I think the average is around 15-20, so the middle range would be B (24-26) or J (18-20). But wait, no, the average is probably closer to 15-20. Let me think about typical cases. At rest, a normal male is breathing at about 12-16 breaths per minute. But that's when resting. While resting, the rate can vary, but the average is around 15-20.

Wait, no, actually, when someone is resting, the respiratory rate is in the 12-16 range, but the maximum is around 25-30. So the average is around 15-20. So the correct average would fall into the higher range of 15-20. Looking at the options, D is 14-16 and E is 12-14. Those are lower.

Option J is 18-20, which is in the upper part of the average range. So the normal rate would be in the 18-20 range. Alternatively, option B is 24-26, which is higher. Hmm, but I thought the average is around 15-20. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up resting and active rates. Active male rates can go up to 25-30, but the average is probably 15-20.

But wait, the question is asking for the normal respiratory rate, which is the average, right? So 15-20. But looking at the options, the closest is B (24-26) or J (18-20). Since the average is in the lower end of 15-20, but J is 18-20, which is higher than the average.

Wait another thought: actually, I've heard that the resting respiratory rate for a healthy adult male is approximately 12-16 breaths per minute, and during active periods, it goes up to 25-30. So the average would be around 15-20. But the options don't include that. The options are from 10-12 (F), up to 28-24 (G). So between D (14-16) and J (18-20), which is the correct average.

Wait, but the question is about the normal respiratory rate, which is the average. So 15-20 is the average, but the options don't have that. So looking at the options, the closest is J (18-20) or B (24-26). Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the resting and active rates. Let me think again: the average for a healthy adult male is around 15-20. So the range that includes that is J (18-20). Because 15 is included in J, but the average is closer to 18, which is the lower end of J.

Wait no, 15-20 includes 18-20, so J would be the correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps the average is around 16-20. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Another approach: I've read that the normal resting respiratory rate is approximately 12-16 breaths per minute, and the peak during exercise is around 20-25. So the average is around 16-20. So the correct option would be J (18-20) or B (24-26). Wait, no, because the average is around 16-20. The options include J (18-20), which is in the higher end of the average.

Alternatively, perhaps the average is 16-20, so J is the correct answer. Alternatively, D is 14-16, which is lower.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think of it this way: the options are:

D: 14-16
J: 18-20

Which is closer to the average. But the average is around 15-20, so both are in that range. J is 18-20, which is higher than the average. So perhaps the question is about the average. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J. Alternatively, another approach: I've heard that the normal resting rate is about 12-16, but the average is higher. So perhaps the average is 24-26? No, that can't be right. I think the average is 15-20, so the correct option is J, 18-20.

But wait, in that case, the average of the options is 18-20, which is option J. Alternatively, another thought: perhaps the correct answer is J, as it's the only option that lies in the higher 15-20 range.

Wait, but another source I remember says that the average is about 15-20, so the correct answer would be J (18-20) because that is in the higher end of the average. Alternatively, perhaps it's option B (24-26) if the average is 24-26, but I thought that was higher than the average.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the normal resting and active rates. Let me think again. The normal resting respiratory rate is typically about 12-16, but when you're at rest, it's lower. But during active periods, it's higher. The average for a healthy adult male is about 15-20, which falls into the range of J (18-20). So the correct answer is J.
</think>

The normal respiratory rate for an adult male is typically around 15-20 breaths per minute, which falls into the range of 18-20 breaths per minute (J). This aligns with the average respiratory rate, considering that during active periods it can reach up to 25-30 breaths per minute. 

Answer: J
