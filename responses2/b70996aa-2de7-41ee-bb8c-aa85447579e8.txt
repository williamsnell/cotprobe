Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the listed short-run costs always increases as output increases. The options are from A to I, each representing a different type of cost. I remember that in economics, costs can vary in behavior based on the level of output. So I need to recall the characteristics of each cost type.

First, let me list out the options again to make sure I don't miss any:
A: Average variable cost
B: Marginal revenue
C: Average total cost
D: Marginal cost
E: Total variable cost
F: Total overhead cost
G: Average revenue cost
H: Total fixed cost
I: Average fixed cost

I think I should go through each option one by one.

Option A: Average variable cost (AVC). I remember that as output increases, the average variable cost can initially decrease due to spreading fixed costs over more units. But sometimes, if there are economies of scale, it might start increasing. However, I'm not sure if it always increases. Maybe sometimes it decreases, so it's not always increasing.

Option B: Marginal revenue (MR). This is the additional revenue from selling one more unit. In the short run, if the market price is constant and there are no constraints, MR could be the same as the market price because each additional unit is sold at that price. So it doesn't always increase.

Option C: Average total cost (ATC). ATC is total cost divided by the number of units. As output increases, fixed costs are spread over more units, so ATC should decrease. Therefore, ATC doesn't always increase. It actually decreases with increased output.

Option D: Marginal cost (MC). MC is the change in total cost when output increases by one unit. In the short run, when a firm is operating at a point where it's producing at a cost-efficient level, MC is positive. But in the long run, MC can be zero or even negative if a firm can adjust all inputs. However, in the short run, as output increases, MC initially decreases and then increases. So it doesn't always increase; it can decrease at first.

Option E: Total variable cost (TVC). TVC is the cost of all variable inputs. As output increases, TVC increases because each additional unit requires using more variable inputs. So TVC should increase as output increases. That seems correct.

Option F: Total overhead cost (TOC). Overhead costs include fixed and variable overheads. Wait, so if the total overhead includes fixed costs, then as output increases, the fixed overheads are spread over more units, so the average fixed overhead decreases. But the total overhead itself is fixed plus variable. So if I'm adding variable overheads as output increases, the total overhead might not always increase. Wait, but if there are no other fixed overheads, then as output increases, the average overhead decreases, but the total overhead (if fixed) remains the same. However, if the total overhead includes fixed costs, then as output increases, the fixed overheads per unit decrease, but the total overhead (fixed + variable) increases only if variable costs are increasing. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, I'm supposed to consider the total overhead cost as a category. So if the total overhead includes fixed and variable parts, then as output increases, the fixed part's average cost decreases. But the total overhead (fixed plus variable) would depend on the variable costs. If the variable costs are rising, then total overhead would increase. But if the variable costs are decreasing, the total overhead could stay the same or even decrease if fixed costs remain the same. So, the total overhead itself might not always increase with output. It depends on the situation.

Option G: Average revenue cost (ARC). This is similar to marginal revenue but per unit. Like MC, ARC can decrease, stay the same, or increase depending on the situation. It doesn't always increase.

Option H: Total fixed cost (TFC). TFC is cost that doesn't change with output. So as output increases, TFC remains the same. So it doesn't increase. It stays constant.

Option I: Average fixed cost (AFC). AFC is TFC divided by output. As output increases, AFC decreases because the same fixed costs are spread over more units. So AFC always decreases as output increases.

So, looking back at the options, the only one that always increases as output increases is E: Total variable cost. Because as output increases, the firm has to produce more units, each requiring more variable inputs, so TVC increases.

Wait, but earlier I thought that TFC is fixed and doesn't change, but TVC does. So yes, TVC should increase as output increases.

Wait, but option E is TVC, so that's the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is E: Total variable cost. As output increases, the total variable cost (TVC) increases because each additional unit requires using more variable inputs, which are necessary for production. Fixed costs, on the other hand, remain constant regardless of output levels. Therefore, TVC always increases as output increases.
