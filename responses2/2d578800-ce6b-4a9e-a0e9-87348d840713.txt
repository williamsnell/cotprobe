Question:

A species of small rodent eats seeds from only one species of pine. In normal years, a pair of these rodents will have a litter of two or three. It is unusual for small rodents to have such small litter sizes. The rodents are most likely to exhibit which other characteristic?

Options:

A: Precocial young
B: Nocturnal behavior
C: Herbivorous diet
D: High birth rate
E: Solitary behavior
F: High parental investment
G: Large body size

I: Moderate sexual size dimorphism
J: Low survival rate

Okay, so I've got this biology question in front of me. Let me try to break it down and think it through. 

The question is about rodents that have a small rodent species that eats only one type of pine, right? In normal years, they have litters with two or three rodents. That's unusual because usually, rodents have bigger litters, like four or more. So this is a small litter size.

The question is asking what other characteristic the rodents are most likely to exhibit. The options are A through J, each representing a different behavior or trait.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A: Precocial young. Precocial means the young are not yet adults and are in a primitive stage. I'm not sure how this directly relates to the litter size. Litter size is more about reproductive success and gene flow, not necessarily about the age of the young. So maybe this isn't the answer.

Option B: Nocturnal behavior. This is related to their feeding habits, like when they eat. If they have a strict schedule, that might influence how many they have, but again, the question is about a different characteristic besides litter size. So probably not B.

Option C: Herbivorous diet. This is about what they eat, not their reproductive strategy. So this doesn't seem to be the key factor here.

Option D: High birth rate. Oh, wait! The question says their litters are usually two or three, which is a low birth rate in normal years. So if the litter sizes are small, maybe their birth rate is low. So D could be the correct answer.

Option E: Solitary behavior. That's about how they act when alone. I'm not sure how this relates to their reproductive success. Maybe more solitary individuals could lead to more reproductive success if they can find partners, but I'm not certain if that directly ties into the given information.

Option F: High parental investment. Parental investment refers to the amount of time and resources a parent invests into their offspring. High investment would mean parents invest a lot, which might affect how many offspring they can have. But the question is about the other characteristics, not the parental investment aspect of the parent's life. So perhaps F isn't the answer here.

Option G: Large body size. If the rodents have a small litter size, maybe they are small because they're efficient in their reproduction. So large body size might not be a characteristic they exhibit. Maybe they are more mobile or have a smaller body, but I'm not sure.

Option H: Frequent extrapair matings. Extrapair mating is when a rodent has more than one mate. High extrapairing might lead to more offspring, but the question says small litters. So perhaps more matings don't directly correlate with small litters, unless they're a sign of a different strategy. Not sure, but I don't think this is the main factor here.

Option I: Moderate sexual size dimorphism. This refers to differences in size between males and females of the same species. Maybe this is a factor, but the question is about their reproductive behavior, not their size. So I'm not sure if this is the answer.

Option J: Low survival rate. Low survival could affect the reproductive success, but the question is about the other characteristics. So not J.

So, going back, the key point is the small litter size. Since their litters are small, their birth rate is probably low. So D is the answer.

The rodents in question have a small litter size of two or three in normal years, indicating a low birth rate. This suggests that their reproductive success is influenced by factors like social behavior or parental investment, but the question asks for an unrelated characteristic. Among the options, the one most relevant is **D: High birth rate**, as it directly correlates with the observed small litter sizes. Other options, such as precocial young, nocturnal behavior, herbivorous diet, solitary behavior, high parental investment, large body size, frequent extrapair matings, moderate sexual size dimorphism, and low survival rate, do not directly tie into the small litter size or the reproductive strategy of the rodents. 

Answer: D
