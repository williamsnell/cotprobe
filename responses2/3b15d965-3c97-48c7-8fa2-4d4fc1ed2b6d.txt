Okay, let's try to figure out this multiple-choice question. So, the scenario is about a plaintiff suing a defendant for injuries after an accident. The plaintiff's claim was that her legs became permanently paralyzed. The jury awarded her $5 million, and then two months after the verdict was entered, the defendant gave a videotape showing the plaintiff jogging with her doctor. Now, the question is asking what the defendant should do next to seek relief from the judgment.

Hmm, I remember in court law, especially in civil cases, the rule is that evidence can be introduced only if it's admissible. Admissibility depends on several factors, including whether it's related to the issue at hand, hasn't been used in a prior case, and whether it's not confrontational.

The plaintiff presented evidence that her legs are paralyzed, but the defendant gave a new video showing her jogging. That video was two months after the verdict. I think the key here is whether the plaintiff presented evidence contradicting the jury's findings.

Wait, the plaintiff's claim was that her injuries were permanent. So if the video shows she was jogging, which is walking, not stopped, that's a different situation. But the question says the plaintiff's evidence led to permanent paralysis. The video might show her walking, which is different. So the new evidence is about her walking, not about permanent paralysis.

But does that mean it's contradicting the plaintiff's claim? The plaintiff's claim was that her condition was permanent. The video shows her jogging, which is a short walk, not stopping. So maybe the plaintiff's evidence was incorrect. But wait, the plaintiff's evidence might not have been the only evidence presented. They presented it before the verdict, and the defendant presented this new evidence. So the new evidence could contradict the plaintiff's case.

But wait, no. The plaintiff presented evidence before the verdict, but the defendant presented a new evidence after the verdict was entered. So the new evidence is a separate piece of evidence. So if the plaintiff's evidence included that she was paralyzed, and the defendant's evidence shows she was walking, that might mean that the plaintiff's claim was incorrect. But the question is about whether the defendant should seek relief from the judgment.

I think the defendant can introduce evidence that contradicts the plaintiff's evidence. So the new evidence (the video) could be used to show that her condition was not permanent. But wait, the question is about the best way for the defendant to seek relief. So the options are various types of motions.

Looking at the options, option A is moving to set aside the verdict based on new evidence. But I'm not sure if the new evidence is admissible. Or is the new evidence showing her walking, which is different, so that would be new evidence and admissible.

Alternatively, option E says to request a retrial on the basis of newly discovered evidence that the plaintiff's injuries were not permanent. But the plaintiff's evidence was presented before the verdict. Retrial is generally for when the evidence doesn't go to trial. But maybe the new evidence (the video) can be used to introduce evidence at trial, but since the trial hasn't happened yet, the defendant can file a motion to set aside the verdict.

Wait, the defendant presented the video after the verdict. So the evidence is new and not yet used in the trial. So the defendant could bring a motion to set aside the verdict because the new evidence contradicts the claim. Or perhaps they could bring a motion to reduce the award, but that's more about the jury's decision.

Looking at the options again: 

Option A: Move to set aside the verdict based on new evidence. That would involve the defendant using the new evidence (video) to challenge the jury's finding that her legs are permanently paralyzed.

Option E: Request a retrial on the basis of newly discovered evidence that injuries were not permanent. A retrial would be used if the evidence isn't admissible, but I think the video is admissible as new evidence, not contradictory. So the defendant can use it to counter the jury's finding.

But the options are about what the defendant should do to seek relief. So the best option would be to bring a motion to set aside the verdict based on the new evidence. Because the court has entered a judgment and the evidence presented later could contradict the claim. However, the plaintiff's evidence was presented before, so I'm not sure if the defendant can rely on it as new evidence at the time of judgment.

Wait, but the defendant can present evidence after the verdict. Since the new evidence (video) is not yet used in the trial, it can be used to set aside the verdict. So option A is a possible answer.

Alternatively, if the plaintiff's evidence is considered new and contradicts the jury's findings, then the defendant can move for relief based on that. So the best option is moving to set aside the verdict (A) or perhaps E, which is a retrial.

Wait, another thought: The plaintiff might have presented evidence that is admissible, and the defendant presented new evidence that contradicts it. So the defendant can use that to challenge the jury. So the defendant should consider moving to set aside the verdict (A) or to reduce the award (other options). But the options are about what to do after the judgment is entered.

Looking at the options again, option E is a request for a retrial based on new evidence. But that would require the evidence to be admissible. The video is admissible as new evidence. So the defendant can present that to the court. Therefore, the correct answer would be A or E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the rule is that evidence presented after the verdict can be used to meet the burden of proof. So the evidence (the video) can be used to show that the plaintiff's case was incorrect. So if the plaintiff's evidence is presented before the verdict and the defendant presents new evidence after, the defendant can use the new evidence to show that the plaintiff's case is invalid.

So the defendant's best move is to present the video to show that the plaintiff's claim was incorrect. That would be moving to set aside the verdict (Option A) based on the new evidence. Alternatively, if the plaintiff's evidence is considered unadmissible, but in this case, the video is new and admissible.

So the options are:

A: Move to set aside the verdict based on new evidence.

E: Request a retrial on the basis of newly discovered evidence that the injuries were not permanent.

Wait, a retrial is used when the evidence is not admissible. In this case, the evidence is admissible. So a retrial is not the right option. Therefore, option E is incorrect.

So the correct answer would be A: Move to set aside the verdict based on the new evidence that contradicts the plaintiff's claims.
</think>

The plaintiff presented evidence before the verdict, claiming her legs were permanently paralyzed. The defendant later provided a video showing her jogging, contradicting the plaintiff's claim. Since the defendant's evidence is new and admissible, the best course of action is to move to set aside the verdict based on the new evidence. This motion challenges the jury's findings that her injuries were permanent, which are now contradicted by the video.
