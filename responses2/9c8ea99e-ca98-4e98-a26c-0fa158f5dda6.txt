Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why Venus doesn't have a strong magnetic field. I remember that planets like Earth have strong magnetic fields, but Venus is one of the exceptions. Let me think about what factors affect a planet's magnetic field.

First, I recall that magnetic fields are generated by liquid metal core. So, if Venus's core is molten, it would create a strong magnetic field. But wait, I think Venus's core is actually surrounded by a layer of rock. I remember something about the core being hot, which means it's molten, but perhaps without a liquid core? Or maybe the composition is different.

Hmm, Venus has an atmosphere, which is the gas layer around it. I'm not sure how that plays into the magnetic field. Oh wait, the Earth's magnetic field is mostly due to the liquid outer core, which is molten. Venus's core isn't liquid but solid, I think. So maybe that's the issue. If the core is solid, maybe it doesn't generate a strong enough magnetic field.

Looking at the options: Option I says it lacks a molten outer core. Wait, Venus's outer core is actually a layer of solid rock surrounding a liquid inner core. So if it lacks a liquid core, the magnetic field wouldn't form as strong. But the question is about the outer core's condition. So, option I states that it lacks a molten outer core. Wait, but the inner core is liquid, right? So the outer core is solid. So if the outer core isn't molten, the magnetic field wouldn't be strong. So option I is a possible answer.

Alternatively, another thought: The Earth's strong magnetic field comes from the liquid outer core. Venus doesn't have a liquid outer core because it's solid. So without a liquid core, the magnetic field can't form, so it's weaker. So the lack of a molten outer core (option I) would explain why Venus doesn't have a strong field.

Another angle: The sun's magnetic field comes from the Sun's active regions, like the Sun's magnetic poles. Venus is too far from the Sun, but that's not directly related to the magnetic field strength as much as the Sun's magnetic field. So that's probably not the main reason.

Another thought: The Sun's magnetic field is due to the Sun's active regions, which are hot and molten. Venus, being a planet, has a weaker field because it's too far from the Sun, but that's not the cause for the field strength, just its strength. So that's not relevant here.

Back to the options. Which options relate to the core being liquid or not? Option I says it lacks a molten outer core. The Earth does have a liquid outer core, so Venus is different. If the core isn't liquid, then the magnetic field can't form. So option I seems to explain it.

Other options: Option C is about metallic core. Venus's core is solid, so it doesn't have a metallic core. That would mean no liquid to generate the field. But wait, the question is about a strong magnetic field, so maybe the presence of a metallic core would make it stronger, but if it's solid, maybe it's weaker. Wait, Venus's core is actually a liquid inner core surrounded by a solid outer core. So maybe the lack of a liquid core (i.e., the outer core being solid) is the main reason.

Wait, but another point: The Earth's magnetic field is mostly from the liquid outer core. Venus's outer core is solid, so it's a different situation. So if the outer core is solid, then no magnetic field. So option I would explain why Venus's field is weaker.

Wait, but option G says the axis tilt is too extreme. No, Venus has a more moderate tilt, so that's probably not it. Option E is about distance from the Sun. Venus is closer, but that's more about why it has an average temperature and not a strong magnetic field.

So the key factor is the composition of the core. So the answer should be option I: It lacks a molten outer core. Because without a liquid core, the magnetic field can't form. So the magnetic field is weaker.

The strength of a planet's magnetic field is primarily determined by the composition of its core. A liquid core, such as in Earth's outer core, produces a strong magnetic field. However, Venus's core is solid, meaning it lacks a liquid core. This lack of a molten outer core prevents the formation of a strong magnetic field. Therefore, the correct answer is:
