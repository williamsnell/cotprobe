Okay, so I've got this question about Pavlov's conditioning, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about the point where dogs salivated in response to the sound of a tone without food being present. The options are all terms from different conditioning theories. Hmm, let's break it down.

I remember that Pavlov's behaviorist conditioning involves three main components: the unconditioned stimulus (US), the unconditioned response (UR), the conditioned stimulus (CS), and the conditioned response (CR). The process leads to an acquired response, which is called acquisition.

In this scenario, the sound of the tone is probably the unconditioned stimulus, because without food, the dog hasn't learned to respond to that sound. When the tone is present with food, that's the unconditioned response, because the dog can immediately respond to the presence of food without any additional training.

The point where the dog salivates in the absence of food is called the conditioned stimulus. Wait, but wait—no, actually, I think I might be mixing things up. The conditioned stimulus is the one that, once paired with the unconditioned stimulus, causes the conditioned response. So in this case, the sound of the tone is the CS, the food is the US, and the response without food is the UR. But when the CS is given without food, the dog salivates, which is the CR.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The unconditioned response is what the dog naturally does without any training. The unconditioned stimulus is the original stimulus that triggers that response. The conditioned stimulus is the one paired with the unconditioned stimulus to create the conditioned response.

So in this case, the sound of the tone is the unconditioned stimulus because without food, the dog doesn't respond. When it is paired with the unconditioned response (salinating without food, so the response is salivation), that pairs the tone (CS) with the food (US) to produce the salivation (CR). So the point where the dog salivates in the absence of food is the conditioned response. Wait, no—because the CS is the tone, but when paired with US (food), it leads to CR (salivation). So if the tone is given without food, the dog salivates—so that's the conditioned response. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. The process goes like this: The dog knows when the tone is there with food. Without food, the tone doesn't produce salivation. So the unconditioned stimulus is the tone (CS is actually the tone, but the unconditioned stimulus is the tone itself). Wait, I'm getting tangled here.

Let me recall: The unconditioned stimulus is the original stimulus that naturally triggers the unconditioned response. The unconditioned response is the natural response to that stimulus. When you pair the unconditioned stimulus with a new stimulus, the new stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus, and the associated response becomes a conditioned response.

So in this case, the unconditioned stimulus is the tone of the dog. The unconditioned response is salivation without food. The conditioned stimulus would be the tone when given without food, and the conditioned response would be salivation. So the point where the dog salivates in the absence of food is the conditioned response.

Wait, but the options given are A to J, and the question is asking what that point is referred to as. So the options include discrimination, which is the difference between an conditioned response and an unconditioned response. Discrimination refers to the ability to tell the difference between a conditioned and an unconditioned response. So when the dog salivates without food, that's discrimination because it's the difference from the normal response (salivating with food).

Wait, but the question is asking for the term that refers to the point where the dog salivates without food. So the correct answer would be discrimination, which is option F. Because discrimination is the ability to distinguish between a conditioned and an unconditioned response.

Alternatively, another approach: The point where the dog salivates without food is a conditioned response because it's the result of pairing the unconditioned stimulus (the tone) with the unconditioned response (salivation). But wait, no. The process is that the unconditioned stimulus (CS) is the tone, and the unconditioned response (UR) is salivation. When the CS is paired with a new stimulus (no food), the new response (salivation) is formed. So the new response, which is salivation without food, is the conditioned response. So the point where the dog salivates without food is the conditioned response, but that's not one of the options directly.

Wait, no. Let me look at the options again. Option F is discrimination. Discrimination is when the dog can tell the difference between a response that comes from a conditioned stimulus and one that comes from an unconditioned stimulus. So, when the tone is present with food, the dog responds (salivates). Without food, the same tone produces no response. So the dog is able to recognize that the same tone without food (the unconditioned stimulus) doesn't produce a salivation (the unconditioned response). So the ability to do this is discrimination.

Therefore, the correct answer is discrimination, which is option F.

The point where the dog salivates in the absence of food is referred to as the ability to distinguish between a conditioned response and an unconditioned response. This is known as **discrimination**. 

- **Answer**: F: discrimination
