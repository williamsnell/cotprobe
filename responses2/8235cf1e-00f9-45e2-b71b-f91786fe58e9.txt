Okay, so I've got this question about Rami turning a machine's dial. Let me try to figure this out. The question says that each time he turns the dial, it moves 1 degree. He turned it 10 times. I need to find the total degrees the dial moved. 

Hmm, each turn is 1 degree, and he did it 10 times. So, it's like 10 multiplied by 1. Let me write that down. 10 times 1 equals 10. So, the dial moved 10 degrees in total. 

Looking at the options, I see option E is 10. That must be the right answer. Let me make sure I didn't mix anything up. Each turn is 1 degree, so 10 turns would be 10 degrees. Yeah, that makes sense. So I'm confident the answer is E.

The dial moves 1 degree each turn. After 10 turns, the total degrees are 10 * 1 = 10. 

Answer: E: 10
