Question:

A company with offices in five different countries is interested in estimating the proportion of its employees in favor of banning smoking on the office premises. It is known that the views of people from different countries on issues like smoking tend to vary due to the influence of different local social structures. Which of the following is an appropriate sampling technique to use in this situation, and why?

Options:

A: Convenience sample, because it's the easiest method to execute
B: Cluster sample, because it's cheaper and easier to conduct than a stratified sample
C: Multi-stage sample, because it allows the company to randomly select offices, then employees within those offices
D: Non-probability sample, because it doesn't require the company to know the overall population size.
E: Simple random sample, because this is the simplest sampling method
F: Stratified sample, because the population is divided into five strata—namely, five offices in five different countries
G: Cluster sample, because the population is divided into five clusters—namely, five offices in five different countries
H: Systematic sample, because the company can select every nth employee from each country
I: Quota sample, because the company wants to ensure that the sample accurately represents the population in terms of the proportion of employees from each country
J: Simple random sample, because this is the only method that gives unbiased results

Okay, so I've got this question here about sampling techniques for a company that wants to estimate the proportion of its employees who support banning smoking on their offices. The company has offices in five different countries, and people from these different countries might have varying opinions because of local social structures. I need to figure out which sampling method is appropriate here.

Let me start by recalling what each sampling method entails. 

Convenience sampling is the easiest, where you just pick people who are easy to reach. It's not random, so it's not the most reliable but might be quick. I don't think this is the best choice because the company wants a representative sample, and convenience might not capture diversity properly.

Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into groups (clusters), randomly selecting some of them, and then taking a sample from each selected cluster. It's more efficient when clusters are homogeneous within and heterogeneous between. But in this case, the company is in five different countries, which are separate clusters. So maybe cluster sampling could work if the company can randomly select offices, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach here.

Stratified sampling divides the population into subgroups (strata) based on certain characteristics, like the five countries. The idea is that each subgroup is homogeneous, so you sample within each stratum. This would ensure that each country's opinions are represented. I remember stratified is often used when you have specific subgroups that need to be considered separately. So stratified sounds like a good option here.

Systematic sampling is when you select individuals at regular intervals. For example, every 10th person in a list. It's simple but might not be as effective as stratified or cluster because it doesn't account for variations within the population. The company's situation might require a more nuanced approach.

Quota sampling involves selecting individuals to meet certain quotas, often based on characteristics like age or gender. It's good for qualitative research but doesn't provide representative samples. The question is about proportion estimation, so a quota sample might not be the best fit since it's more about categorizing than getting actual proportions.

Simple random sample is the most basic method, using random selection. It's unbiased but might require a larger sample size, which could be time-consuming or costly, especially since the company has five different offices.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which ones fit.

Option F says it's a stratified sample because they divide into five strata (the five countries). That makes sense because each stratum represents a different social structure, so their opinions are relevant and the sample should balance across countries.

Option G also mentions cluster sampling because they divide into five clusters (countries) and then select offices. But wait, the company has five different countries, so if they choose offices within each country, that would be cluster sampling. But I'm a bit confused between F and G. Stratified and cluster are both methods, but they approach the population differently.

Wait, the main issue here is that the company has offices spread across different countries. If they randomly select offices (like a cluster sample), they might end up with a mix of countries' opinions. But if they divide into strata (countries) and sample each one, they ensure that each country's influence is represented. That sounds more appropriate because each stratum is a subgroup that should be considered separately.

So, which method is better? Stratified (F) or cluster (G)? Let's think about the purpose. Stratified might be more precise because it ensures each stratum is represented. Cluster sampling might select offices from different countries, which could be a mix, but if each stratum is a country, then stratified ensures each is sampled.

Another thought: the company is interested in the proportion of employees from each country. So, if they want each country's opinion to be equally represented, stratified sampling would ensure that each country is included in the sample, which is what they need. So, F is stratified, which seems appropriate.

Wait, but the options are F and G. So which is better?

Hmm. Option F says it's a stratified sample because the population is divided into five strata, each being a country. That seems correct because this ensures each country is represented in the sample.

Option G mentions cluster sampling because they divide into five clusters (countries), and then select offices within those clusters. So, cluster sampling would mean selecting, say, 1 office from each country's cluster. But perhaps the company wants to select more than one office from each country to get a bigger sample, but that's not clear. Alternatively, does the question imply that they need to sample from each country?

Wait, the question says the company wants to estimate the proportion of employees in favor of banning smoking. So, the approach should ensure that each country's employee's opinion is represented. So, stratified sampling (F) would ensure that each country is represented, which is better than cluster sampling (G) if cluster sampling only samples one office per country, but the company might need more than that if they want a larger sample size.

Alternatively, maybe the company is looking for a more efficient method. Wait, no, the efficiency is more about how easy it is, but here the main point is about representation.

So, I think F is better. So the appropriate technique is a stratified sample, which is option F.

The appropriate sampling technique to use in this situation is **stratified sampling**, as it ensures that each of the five different countries (strata) is represented in the sample. This approach allows the company to capture the diverse opinions from each country, which is crucial given the varying social structures and opinions among the employees in different regions.

Answer: F
