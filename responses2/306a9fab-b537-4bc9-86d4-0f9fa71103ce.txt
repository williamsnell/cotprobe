Okay, so I have this question about LSD and why an old explanation about it being called a "psychomimetic" drug was refuted. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that LSD is often described as causing mental health issues, similar to how mental illnesses affect people. But the question is why this explanation was wrong. The options are A to J, each making a different point.

I think the key is to recall what LSD actually does. I know LSD causes hallucinations, which is a physical effect. So option J says that LSD's effects are only physical, not psychological. That makes sense because hallucinations are definitely physical. But wait, what about the other options?

Option A says LSD improves mental health. I'm not sure about this. I think LSD does cause some hallucinations, but does it actually improve mental health? Maybe in some cases, but I'm not certain. It's possible that the initial description was wrong because LSD doesn't always cause mental issues, or maybe it's not universally positive.

Option B claims the effects are different. Well, if LSD causes hallucinations, that's different from the mental effects. So B might be correct, but the question is about why the explanation was refuted, not whether it's true.

Option C suggests identical symptoms. That doesn't seem right because LSD causes hallucinations, while the schizophrenic state is something else. So C would be false.

Option D says LSD doesn't cause hallucinations. That directly contradicts what I know about LSD. So D is probably incorrect because LSD does cause hallucinations, which is option J's point.

Option E claims schizophrenia is caused by LSD. But that doesn't make sense because I don't think that's the case. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder, and LSD isn't the cause; it's used for treatment. So E is incorrect.

Option F says the effects are universal. I don't think everyone experiences hallucinations. Some might have them, others not. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G says LSD affects only the visual cortex. Well, I know LSD causes hallucinations, but not sure if it's only the visual part. Maybe it affects various areas, so G isn't correct.

Option I says effects last for the duration of the drug. I'm not sure about the duration. Some people might get hallucinations after taking it for a long time, but others might stop after a few hours. Not sure, but I think the duration is debatable.

So, going back, the original explanation was that LSD caused mental health issues because of its effects being similar to mental illness. But the question is why this was refuted.

The correct explanation is that LSD causes hallucinations, making option J correct. So the old explanation was wrong because it said it caused mental health, but LSD actually causes physical hallucinations. Therefore, the answer is J.

The correct answer is J: LSD's effects are only physical, not psychological. This is because LSD causes hallucinations, which are physical, contradicting the initial explanation that it caused mental health effects. 

Answer: J
