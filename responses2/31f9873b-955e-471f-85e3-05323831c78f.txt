Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Traditional approaches seek to explain why and how states have sought security. Which answer best describes the approach of traditional Security Studies?

Options:

A: Traditional theories explain international politics as the distribution of power among members of an international system, and specifically as the balance of power amongst major states. The relative power and the constraints of a state are reflective of the security strategy of that state.
B: The traditional approaches emerged in response to the Cold War, and to the accumulation of tension and competition between the two Superpowers. Traditional theories seek to explain behaviour in terms of arms accumulation.
C: Traditional conceptions emerged to explain the clusters of norms and patterns of behaviour that result in management of conflict and cooperation in the international system, in specific spheres of activities.
D: Traditional approaches are concerned with sovereignty. Sovereignty is a legal status; it gives the state control over a specified territory, means it is free from arbitrary intervention, and is responsible to no higher authority. Traditional theories examine the patterns of behaviour and relative cooperation of sovereign states in the international system.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about traditional approaches to Security Studies. I'm a bit rusty on my international relations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question asks which option best describes traditional Security Studies. The options are A, B, C, D, and the last letter has to match the chosen answer.

First, I need to understand what Security Studies generally focus on. I remember that traditional Security Studies are often concerned with the allocation of power and security resources among states. They look at how states gain and maintain control over territories, especially in international contexts.

Looking at the options:

Option A says: Traditional theories explain international politics as the distribution of power among states, focusing on power balance and major states' relative power. It also mentions how state power reflects their security strategy.

Option B talks about the Cold War context and the accumulation of tensions. It says traditional theories explain behavior in terms of arms accumulation. I'm not sure if traditional Security Studies were focused on Cold War tensions, and the emphasis on arms is more of a modern or contemporary approach, not traditional.

Option C states that traditional conceptions focus on explaining clusters of norms and behaviour patterns leading to conflict and cooperation in the international system. It specifically mentions spheres of activities, like defense, peacekeeping, etc.

Option D: Traditional approaches are about sovereignty. It defines sovereignty as a legal status, control over territory, freedom from intervention, and responsible to no higher authority. It also discusses examining the patterns of behaviour and cooperation among sovereign states.

Wait, traditional approaches versus modern ones. Traditional Security Studies are historical and focused on the past, in the way states were managed in their time. So they might look at how sovereignty was established, how states gained power, and how they maintained control.

Looking again at Option D: It says traditional approaches focus on sovereignty, which is about the legal status and control. So it's about the legal and political aspects, not just the current powers or arms accumulation. That makes sense because traditional approaches would be historical in nature.

Option A is more about the current distribution of power, but traditional approaches would be more about historical power dynamics. Option C seems to be more about the behaviour patterns and norms leading to cooperation, which is more about the current state of international relations, perhaps more of a post-war perspective.

So traditional Security Studies focus on the historical allocation of power among states, including their sovereignty. They'd look at how states gained their security through means like arms, etc., but more on the historical methods of power distribution. Option D seems to capture that, as it's about sovereignty, the legal status, and how it's maintained, which aligns with traditional approaches.

The correct answer is:

**D: Traditional approaches are concerned with sovereignty. Sovereignty is a legal status; it gives the state control over a specified territory, means it is free from arbitrary intervention, and is responsible to no higher authority. Traditional theories examine the patterns of behaviour and relative cooperation of sovereign states in the international system.**

Traditional Security Studies focus on the historical allocation of power among states, particularly sovereignty and the legal status of states, examining how these elements are maintained over time.
