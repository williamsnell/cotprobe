Okay, so I've got this physics problem about gravitational force. Hmm, I remember that Newton's law of universal gravitation is involved here. Let me think. The formula is F = G*(m1*m2)/(r²), right? G is the gravitational constant.

The question says that both masses are doubled and the distance between them is doubled. So each mass becomes 2m, and the separation becomes 2r. Let me plug these into the formula.

Original force: F = G*(m1*m2)/r².
After changes: F' = G*(2m1 * 2m2)/( (2r)² )

Calculate numerator: 2m1 * 2m2 = 4 m1 m2.
Denominator: (2r)^2 is 4r².

So F' = G*4 m1 m2 /4 r². Oh wait, the 4s cancel out. So F' = G m1 m2 / r², which is the same as F. So the force remains the same.

Wait, but wait. Did I do that right? Let me check again. Because sometimes when you double each mass, you're multiplying by 4, but the distance squared would make it 4 as well. So 4 divided by 4 is 1, so yes, the force remains the same. So the answer should be B, "It remains the same."

Wait a second, but let's think about it another way. If both masses are doubled, the product m1*m2 becomes four times bigger. But when you square the distance, the denominator becomes four times bigger. So (4) / (4) = 1. So yes, the denominator and numerator's change cancel each other out. So the gravitational force stays the same.

The gravitational force between two objects is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation: 

\[
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
\]

When both masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are doubled (\( 2m_1 \) and \( 2m_2 \)), and the distance \( r \) is doubled (\( 2r \)), the new force \( F' \) becomes:

\[
F' = G \frac{(2m_1)(2m_2)}{(2r)^2}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
F' = G \frac{4m_1 m_2}{4r^2} = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} = F
\]

Thus, the gravitational force remains the same.
