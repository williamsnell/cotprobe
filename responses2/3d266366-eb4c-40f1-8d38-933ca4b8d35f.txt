Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a mass on a wire oscillating. Let me see if I can figure it out. Alright, the mass is 10 kg on a steel wire. The wire is 5 meters long and hanging from the ceiling. Then, when the table is removed, the wire is stretched and the mass starts oscillating. I need to find the frequency of this oscillation.

Hmm, wait. The question mentions the cross-sectional area of the wire is 1 square millimeter and Young's Modulus is 19 × 10^11 dynes/cm². Oh, right, Young's Modulus relates stress and strain. So I think I need to find the tension in the wire when it's stretched, and then use that to find the spring constant. Once I have the spring constant, I can use the formula for the frequency of a mass-spring system.

Wait, but the wire is a steel wire. Oh right, for a wire, the formula for the frequency is f = (1/(2π√(m/L))) ) * sqrt(Y*A/(m)) )? Or wait, maybe I should think about the wire as a spring. The wire's natural length is 5m, and when the mass is attached, it stretches. So the effective spring constant would be Y*A/(L), where Y is Young's modulus, A is the cross-sectional area, and L is the length.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The spring constant k is Y*A/(L), because Young's Modulus (Y) is stress over strain. Stress is F/A (force per area), strain is ΔL/L. So Y = F/A / (ΔL/L) → F/A = Y * (ΔL/L) → F = Y (ΔL/L) * A → F = Y A (ΔL/L). So F = Y A ΔL/(L). So the force (which is the tension in the wire) is T = Y*A*ΔL/(L).

But wait, in the problem, the wire is 5m long. When the mass is attached, it stretches by some ΔL. But in the problem, when the table is removed, the wire is stretched and the mass oscillates. So the question might be assuming that the change in length is negligible or that the mass is just moving under its own weight, but wait, that doesn't make sense. No, wait, the mass is attached to the wire, which is hung from a table. Without the table, the wire stretches because the mass is pulling it. So the wire is under tension, stretching, and then the mass oscillates. But how much does it stretch? Probably, the problem is considering the wire's stretching as the restoring force, and the mass is oscillating due to that.

Wait, but the key point is that when the mass is attached, the wire stretches. Then, when the table is removed, the wire is stretched, and the mass is then oscillating. So perhaps the frequency is determined by the wire's spring constant and the mass.

So, to find the frequency f, I'll need the spring constant k, which for a wire under tension is given by k = (Y*A)/(L), where L is the length of the wire. Because when the mass is attached, the wire stretches by ΔL, and the tension T is Y A (ΔL/L). But for small oscillations, the restoring force is approximately F = -k x, where k = Y*A/(L). So the mass's oscillation is like a spring with spring constant k.

So, the frequency f is given by (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m). Since k is Y*A/(L), f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( Y*A/(m L) ). Alternatively, f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (Y*A)/(m L) )

Wait, wait, let me make sure. Young's modulus is Y = (F/A) / (ΔL/L) → F = (Y A ΔL)/(L). So the force is T = Y A ΔL / L. So the tension is the effective spring force. So k = Y A ΔL / L. But when the system is oscillating, we can treat the wire as a spring with k = Y A (ΔL)/(L). But wait, but ΔL is the extension, but for small oscillations, the extension is approximately the same as the displacement x. So in the equation of motion, F = -k x, so k = Y A (x)/(L). So yes, k = Y A x / L.

But wait, in this case, when the mass is attached, the tension in the wire is T = Y A x / L, where x is the extension. So the effective spring constant is Y*A/(L), because for a small x, T ≈ k x → k = Y A / L.

So yes, the spring constant k is Y A / L.

Wait, but I need to be careful with the units because Y is given in dynes/cm². Let me note the units:

Young's modulus Y is dynes/cm². 1 dyne is 10^-5 Newtons. 1 cm is 0.01 meters.

So Y (dynes/cm²) = Y (N/(cm²)) → N/(cm²) = (N/(0.01 m))² → N/(m²) * (0.01 m)^2 → N/(m²) * (1e-4 m²) → Y (N/m²) * 1e-4.

Wait, maybe it's easier to convert Y into N/m² (since SI units are often easier to work with for formulas).

Wait, 1 dyne/cm² = 1 N/(100 cm * 100 cm) → because 1 cm = 0.01 m, so 1 cm² = (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 1 dyne/cm² = 1 N/(m²) * 1e-4 → 1e-4 N/m².

So Y = 19e11 dyne/cm² = 19e11 * 1e-4 N/m² = 19e7 N/m².

But wait, let me compute that correctly. Let me compute 19e11 dyne/cm² → 19e11 * (1 N / (100 cm * 100 cm)) → because 1 dyne = 1e-5 N, and 1 cm² = 1e-4 m².

Wait, 1 dyne/cm² = 1e-5 N / (1e-2 m * 1e-2 m) → 1e-5 N / 1e-4 m² = 1e-1 N/m².

So 19e11 dyne/cm² = 19e11 * 1e-1 N/m² = 19e10 N/m².

So Y = 19e10 N/m².

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the unit conversion because 1 dyne = 1e-5 N, and 1 cm² = (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m².

So Y (N/m²) = Y (dynes/cm²) * (1e-5 N/dyne) * (1e-4 m²/cm²) ) → Y (N/m²) = Y (dynes/cm²) * (1e-5 * 1e-4) ) → Y (N/m²) = Y (dynes/cm²) * 1e-9.

So 19e11 dyne/cm² * 1e-9 = 19e2 = 1900 N/m².

Wait, let me compute that again. Y = 19e11 dyne/cm².

Because 1 dyne = 1e-5 N, so 19e11 dyne = 19e11 * 1e-5 N = 19e6 N.

1 cm² = 1e-4 m².

So Y = 19e6 N / (1e-4 m²) → 19e6 / 1e-4 → 19e10 N/m².

Wait, because 1 dyne/cm² = (1e-5 N) / (1e-4 m²) ) → 1e-1 N/m².

So 19e11 dyne/cm² → 19e11 * 1e-1 N/m² → 19e10 N/m².

So Y is 19e10 N/m².

Now, the wire's length is L =5m.

So the spring constant k is Y*A/(L).

A is 1 sq mm. Let's convert that to m². 1 mm = 0.001 m → 1 mm² = 1e-6 m².

So A =1e-6 m².

Thus, k = (19e10 N/m²) * (1e-6 m²) / (5 m) → (19e10 * 1e-6) /5 N/m.

Compute numerator: 19e10 * 1e-6 =19e4.

So k = 19e4 /5 → 38,000 N/m.

Wait, wait, 19e4 is 190,000 → 190,000 /5 = 38,000.

So k=38e3 N/m.

Now, the mass is 10 kg. The frequency of oscillation is f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m).

Wait, but let's plug that in.

f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(38000 / 10) → because k is 38000 N/m, m is 10 kg.

So 38000/10 is 3800. So sqrt(3800) is sqrt(38 * 100) = 10 * sqrt(38). 

What's sqrt(38)? Approximately 6.164.

So sqrt(3800) ≈ 61.64.

Then, f = (1/(2π)) * 61.64.

Calculate that: 61.64 / (2 * 3.1416) → 61.64 /6.2832≈ 9.83 Hz.

Wait, but wait, the options don't include 9.83. The closest option is E:10 vib/s.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, Y was 19e10 N/m². Correct? Because 19e11 dyne/cm² → 19e11 * 1e-1 N/m² → 19e10 N/m².

Yes. A is 1e-6 m².

So Y*A = 19e10 * 1e-6 =19e4.

Divide by L (5) → 19e4 /5 = 3.8e4 N/m.

Wait, wait a second, 19e4 is 190000. 190,000 /5 =38,000 N/m. That's correct.

So k=38,000 N/m.

So f=(1/(2π)) * sqrt(38,000 /10) → sqrt(3800)≈61.64.

61.64/(2π)= approx 61.64/6.283≈9.83 Hz.

Hmm, but the options don't have 9.83. The closest is E:10 vib/s.

Wait, but perhaps I made an error in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f= (1/(2π)) * sqrt(Y*A/(m L)).

Wait, let's re-calculate the numbers.

Y =19e10 N/m².

A=1e-6 m².

m=10 kg.

L=5 m.

So (Y*A) = 19e10 *1e-6 =19e4.

Divide by (m * L) →10*5=50.

So (Y*A)/(m L) =19e4 /50 = 3800.

So k = Y A/(m L) =3800 N/m.

So correct.

So f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(3800 /10) ?

Wait, no, k=3800 N/m, so sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(3800/10) = sqrt(380) ≈19.493.

Wait, wait, this is conflicting. Did I mix up the formula?

Wait, the formula for frequency is f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m).

So k is 3800 N/m, m is 10 kg.

So k/m = 3800 /10 = 380.

So sqrt(380)≈19.493.

Then f = (1/(2π)) *19.493≈ (19.493)/(6.283)≈3.105 Hz. Wait, that would be about 3.1 Hz, which isn't one of the options either.

Hmm, this contradicts the earlier calculation. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think. The spring constant k is Y*A/(L), because for a wire, the force is T = Y A x/L. So when you stretch it by x, the force is k x, so k = Y A / L.

But in the formula for frequency, f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/(m)).

So substituting, f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (Y A / L) / m )

Wait, which is same as (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (Y A )/(L m) )

Wait, let me plug in the numbers again.

Y = 19e10 N/m².

A=1e-6 m².

L=5 m.

m=10 kg.

So (Y A)/(L m) = (19e10 *1e-6) / (5 *10) → (19e4) /50 → 19e4 =190,000 → 190,000/50=3800.

So f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(3800) → sqrt(3800)≈61.64.

So f≈61.64/(6.283)≈9.83 Hz.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the spring constant. Maybe the correct formula for the wire's spring constant is k = Y*A/(L^3) or something else? No, that doesn't seem right. No, the stretching is T = Y*A x/L → k = Y*A/L.

Wait, perhaps the frequency formula should be f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (Y*A)/(m L) ). Let me try that.

So Y*A=19e10 *1e-6=19e4.

m L=10*5=50.

So (Y*A)/(m L) =19e4 /50=3800.

f=(1/(2pi)) * sqrt(3800) ≈ (1/(6.283)) * 61.64 ≈9.83 Hz.

Hmm, same as before.

But the options are up to 30, so perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated Y. Let me re-calculate Y.

1 dyne is 1e-5 N.

1 cm is 0.01 m. So 1 cm squared is 1e-4 m².

So 1 dyne/cm² = (1e-5 N) / (1e-4 m²) ) → 1e-1 N/m².

So 19e11 dyne/cm² = 19e11 *1e-1 N/m²=19e10 N/m².

Yes, that's correct.

Another approach: Maybe the formula for the wire's spring constant is k= (Y*A)/(L^3). No, that doesn't make sense. Because stretching a wire by dL would produce a force F= Y*A*dL/L. So F is proportional to dL. So the spring constant is k=Y*A/L.

So I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, but the options don't include 9.8. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe the mass is 10 kg, but I should consider the mass in the formula. Let me re-examine the formula.

f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( k/m )

So f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (Y*A)/(L m) )

Wait, but Y*A/(L) is k, so k= Y*A/(L).

Thus, f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (Y A/(L) ) / m )

= (1/(2π)) * sqrt( Y A / (L m) )

Yes, same as before.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I have a mistake in the unit calculation of Y.

Wait, 1 dyne/cm² = 1 dyne/( (0.01 m)^2 ) → 1 dyne/(0.0001 m²) )= 10,000 dyne/m².

Wait, no, because 1 cm²=0.0001 m².

So 1 dyne/cm² = 1 dyne / (0.0001 m²) ) → 1e4 dyne/m².

But 1 dyne = 1e-5 N.

So 1e4 *1e-5 N/m² = 1e-1 N/m².

Ah! So 19e11 dyne/cm² = 19e11 *1e-1 N/m² = 19e10 N/m².

Yes, so Y=19e10 N/m².

So k= Y*A/L = (19e10) * (1e-6) /5 → let's compute.

(19e10) * (1e-6) =19e4.

Divide by 5:38e3.

So k=38e3 N/m.

So f = (1/(2pi)) * sqrt(38e3 /10) → sqrt(38e2) → sqrt(3800)≈61.64.

So f=61.64/(6.283)≈9.83 Hz.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: The frequency for a wire is f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (Y*A)/(L*m) )

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the mass in the formula as (m/(L^3)), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, an alternative way: The formula for the frequency of a wire is f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (Y*A)/(m L) )

Another way: f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (Y A)/(m L) )

So with Y=19e10 N/m², A=1e-6 m², m=10 kg, L=5 m.

So (Y*A)=19e10 *1e-6 →19e4.

Divide by (m*L)=10*5=50 →3800.

So f = sqrt(3800)/(2pi)

sqrt(3800)=about 61.64.

So f=61.64/(6.283)=approximately 9.83 Hz.

Hmm, so according to this, the frequency is about 9.83 Hz, which is approximately 10 Hz, option E.

Wait, but the options are:

A)7.33

B)8.17

C)9.27

D)10.22

E)11.28.

So E is 10, which is the closest.

But wait, perhaps I made an error in the formula for the wire's spring constant. Let me see.

Wait, another formula I found online is that the frequency of a wire under tension is f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (Y*A)/(m L) ) .

So that's the same as I have, so that's correct.

So I think the correct answer is E:10 vib/s.

Wait, but why is the frequency 9.83 and the options have 10.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 3800/ (10*5) =3800/50=76.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Y*A/(m L) →19e10 *1e-6 / (10 *5 )= (19e4)/50= 3800/50=76.

So sqrt(76)≈8.72.

So f=8.72/(2pi)=approx 8.72/6.283≈1.39 Hz. No, that's not right.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check the formula.

The formula for the frequency of a wire is f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (Y*A)/(m L) )

Yes, that's correct.

So let's plug in the numbers.

Y=19e10 N/m².

A=1e-6 m².

m=10 kg.

L=5 m.

So (Y*A)/(m*L) = (19e10 *1e-6) / (10 *5) → (19e4)/50 → 3800/50=76.

So sqrt(76)=≈8.72.

f=8.72/(2pi) →8.72/6.283≈1.39 Hz.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (Y*A)/(m L) )

Wait, perhaps I should compute k = Y*A/(L) →19e10 *1e-6 /5= (19e4)/5=38e3 N/m.

So k=38e3 N/m.

So f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(38e3 /10 ) → sqrt(38e2)=sqrt(3800)=61.64.

So f=61.64/(2pi)=approx 9.83 Hz.

So according to this, the correct answer is E:10 vib/s.

Ah, so I think the correct answer is E.
</think>

To calculate the frequency of oscillation for the wire, we use the formula:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

where \(k\) is the spring constant of the wire, \(m\) is the mass, and \(f\) is the frequency. The spring constant \(k\) for a wire is given by:

\[
k = \frac{Y \cdot A}{L}
\]

### Step 1: Convert Units
- **Young's Modulus (\(Y\))**: \(19 \times 10^{11} \, \text{dynes/cm}^2\)
  - \(1 \, \text{dyne} = 10^{-5} \, \text{N}\)
  - \(1 \, \text{cm}^2 = 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2\)
  - \(1 \, \text{dynes/cm}^2 = \frac{10^{-5} \, \text{N}}{10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2} = 0.1 \, \text{N/m}^2\)
  - \(19 \times 10^{11} \, \text{dynes/cm}^2 = 19 \times 10^{11} \times 0.1 = 1.9 \times 10^{11} \, \text{N/m}^2\)

- **Cross-Sectional Area (\(A\))**: \(1 \, \text{mm}^2 = 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2\)
- **Length (\(L\))**: \(5 \, \text{m}\)
- **Mass (\(m\))**: \(10 \, \text{kg}\)

### Step 2: Calculate Spring Constant (\(k\))
\[
k = \frac{Y \cdot A}{L} = \frac{(1.9 \times 10^{11}) \cdot (10^{-6})}{5} = \frac{1.9 \times 10^{5}}{5} = 3.8 \times 10^{4} \, \text{N/m}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Frequency (\(f\))
\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{3.8 \times 10^{4}}{10}} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{3.8 \times 10^{3}} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{3800}
\]

- \(\sqrt{3800} \approx 61.64\)
- \(f = \frac{61.64}{2\pi} \approx \frac{61.64}{6.283} \approx 9.83 \, \text{Hz}\)

### Step 4: Match with Options
The closest option to \(9.83 \, \text{Hz}\) is **E) 10 vib/s**.
