Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: |x - 4| - 10 = 2. Hmm, absolute value equations can sometimes be tricky, but I think I remember that they involve two cases because of the absolute value. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably isolate the absolute value term. So I'll start by adding 10 to both sides of the equation. That would give me |x - 4| = 2 + 10, which is |x - 4| = 12. Okay, so now I have an absolute value equal to 12.

I remember that when you have |A| = B, it means that A can be either B or -B. So in this case, x - 4 can be 12 or -12. Let's write those two equations down.

Case 1: x - 4 = 12. Solving for x, I add 4 to both sides. That gives x = 12 + 4, so x = 16.

Case 2: x - 4 = -12. Similarly, I'll add 4 to both sides here. So x = -12 + 4, which is x = -8.

Wait, so the two possible solutions are x = 16 and x = -8. The question asks for the product of all possible values of x. So I need to multiply these two solutions together.

16 multiplied by -8. Let's compute that: 16 * (-8) = -128.

Looking at the options, I need to see which one matches. Let me check the options again. Option J is -128. So the product is -128, which is option J.

Wait, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check. 

Starting equation: |x - 4| -10 = 2.

Add 10: |x -4| =12.

Two cases: x-4=12 →x=16; x-4=-12 →x=-8. Product is 16*(-8)= -128. Yep, that's right. So the answer should be J.

The equation is solved by considering the absolute value case in two ways. After isolating the absolute value, we find the two possible values of x, which are 16 and -8. Multiplying these gives the product -128.

Answer: J
