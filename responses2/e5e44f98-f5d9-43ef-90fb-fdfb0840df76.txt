Question:

A producer of widgets contacted a manufacturer of boxes about the possibility of purcIiasing specially designed boxes for shipping the widgets to customers. The producer sent the manufacturer a sheet containing the dimensions of the boxes' needs, as well as the logo to be placed on each box. After negotiations, the parties entered into a written contract whereby the manufacturer agreed to supply the producer with as many of the boxes as the producer may require up to a maximum of 10,000 per month. Later that day, the producer telephoned the manufacturer and said that they were running a one-time promotion and expected to sell an unusually large number of widgets. Therefore, for the first month only, they would need 15,000 boxes. The manufacturer agreed to this request. The manufacturer's oral agreement to supply the producer with the 15,000 boxes for the first month would most likely be held

Options:

A: unenforceable, because their written contract on the same date was the final integration of the terms of their agreement.
B: unenforceable, because the manufacturer was under a pre-existing duty.
C: unenforceable, due to the Statute of Frauds.
D: enforceable, as the parties' intentions were clear and unambiguous.
E: unenforceable, because there was inadequate consideration to support the manufacturer's unilateral promise.
F: enforceable, due to the oral agreement being a modification of the written contract.
G: enforceable, because the manufacturer was motivated by a business advantage.
H: enforceable.
I: unenforceable, as the agreement to supply more boxes was not in writing.
J: unenforceable, because the agreement was violative of the parol evidence rule.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about contracts and whether an oral agreement would be enforceable. Let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let's read the question again. A widget producer called in for a contract with a box manufacturer. They agreed to supply specially designed boxes, and the manufacturer sent a sheet with dimensions and a logo. They agreed to supply up to 10,000 per month, but later, the producer asked for 15,000 boxes for the first month. The question is about whether the manufacturer's oral agreement is enforceable.

The options are A to J, with each having a different reason. I remember that contracts can be enforceable if they're in writing and clear. But sometimes, even if written, if the parties are in a relationship, the contract might be enforceable through other means.

So, looking at the options, option I says it's unenforceable because the agreement wasn't in writing. But wait, the question says the parties entered into a written contract. Then the producer called in for a contract and then the manufacturer promised more boxes. So the initial contract was written. But then the producer called for a contract again, perhaps because of the promotion.

Wait, but the parties already entered into a contract. So the new oral agreement is a modification of that existing contract. I think that's the key here. If the initial contract was written and they were in a contract, then any subsequent agreements are considered modifications. Modifications can be enforceable as long as they're in writing.

Another point is whether there's consideration. Consideration is an ability to transfer value or a promise to transfer something of value. In this case, the producer is offering boxes, which have value. So if the parties can show that there was consideration, the agreement is enforceable.

So the first thing to check is whether the new agreement was in writing. Since the initial contract was written, and the new one is oral, but the parties are in a contract, the modification might be enforceable. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that part. Modifications of contracts can be enforceable as long as they're in writing. But the problem is whether the parties intended that it's enforceable.

Wait, but the question is about whether the manufacturer's oral agreement would be held unenforceable. So what's the issue here? Is there a lack of consideration? Let's think. The producer is offering boxes, which has value. But in the new agreement, the manufacturer is supplying more boxes than agreed. Wait, no, the initial is up to 10k, new is 15k. The producer is demanding more. So does that count as consideration?

Alternatively, maybe the parties can accept the new contract as a modification, but perhaps there's a problem with the quantity. But the question states that the initial contract was up to 10k. The new is 15k. But the initial was a contract for 10k, but the new is more. So perhaps the parties agreed to a higher quantity, which is a modification.

Wait, but contracts by law require consideration for a modification to be enforceable. So if there's no consideration, the modification isn't enforceable. Or does a modification of a contract be enforceable if it's in writing and meets the conditions?

Wait, the question says that the parties entered into a written contract. So the new agreement is an oral one, but a modification. Modifications can be enforceable as long as they are in writing. But in this case, the parties were in a contract, so any new agreement is considered a modification, which is enforceable as long as there's consideration.

So, if the parties can show that they intended to enter into a contract requiring the exchange of boxes, then the oral modification is enforceable. But if there's no consideration, it's not enforceable.

What constitutes consideration here? The producer is offering boxes for sale, which is a product, so the producer gives up something of value. The manufacturer is giving up a promise to supply more than agreed. So perhaps the consideration exists in the form of the contract being in writing and the parties having a contract in place.

Wait, but the question states that the parties entered into a written contract. So that part is already in place. The new agreement is a modification. Modifications under the contract law can be enforceable if the original contract was written and the modification is in writing. But in this case, the new agreement is a modification, but is it in writing? The question says "the manufacturer agreed to supply the producer with as many of the boxes as the producer may require up to a maximum of 10,000 per month." It says that the parties entered into a written contract. Then the producer called for a contract again. So perhaps the new agreement is a modification, which is enforceable.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. I think that modifications to contracts are enforceable if the original contract was in writing and the modification is in writing. But here, the new agreement is an oral modification. So unless it's in writing, it might not be enforceable.

Alternatively, perhaps the parties intended that the new contract was enforceable. So if the parties had a contract that allowed for the exchange of boxes, then the modification is enforceable.

Another angle is the parol evidence rule, which I'm not sure about. That's when a party can use evidence from a previous parol conversation to strengthen their case, so it's not enforceable. But in this case, the parties have already entered into a contract, so that might not apply.

Looking at the options, option I says that the agreement was not in writing, so it's unenforceable. But the contract was written. So I don't think I is correct.

Option B says it's unenforceable because the manufacturer was under a pre-existing duty. A pre-existing duty is when a party is bound to perform a duty because of a prior contract. The initial contract was up to 10k per month, and then the new is 15k. So the manufacturer was under the duty to supply up to 10k, but the new contract is for more. So if the manufacturer can't fulfill the new request, that's a breach of duty. But in this case, the producer is demanding the extra boxes, so perhaps the duty applies, but the contract was written, so the initial duty is there.

Wait, but that's more about whether the contract covers the quantity. But the question is about the enforceability of the new agreement. So perhaps the pre-existing duty isn't directly relevant here.

Option E says the agreement is unenforceable because it wasn't in writing. But the initial contract was written, so the new one is an oral modification. But perhaps the parties intended that it's enforceable, so the oral agreement wouldn't affect enforceability.

Wait, but the problem is whether the new agreement is enforceable. So if the parties intended it to be enforceable, it's enforceable, but if the modification is unenforceable, then the new agreement can't be held.

So the question is, would the oral modification be enforceable. If the original contract was in writing, then the modification is enforceable as a modification. But is the modification in writing? If the parties have a contract, then I think the modification is enforceable, but perhaps as long as consideration exists.

Wait, but if the parties' intentions were clear and unambiguous, then the modification is enforceable. So the question is whether the parties intended that the modification is enforceable.

Alternatively, perhaps the parties intended that the new contract is enforceable, so the agreement would be enforceable. If the parties intended that, then the answer would be that the agreement is enforceable, which would be option H.

Looking at the options again, option I is about the agreement not being in writing. Option H is about enforceability based on intentions.

Wait, option H says "enforceable, as the parties' intentions were clear and unambiguous." So if the parties intended that the new contract is enforceable, then the agreement is enforceable. How can we know that?

Well, the initial contract was in writing, and it's clear. The new agreement is an oral modification, but the parties intended that it's enforceable. So the modification is enforceable as long as the parties intended it. So the answer would be H.

Wait, but option E is about the agreement being unenforceable because it wasn't in writing. But I think the key is whether the parties had a clear intent to enforce the contract.

So, considering all that, the correct answer is probably H.

The question revolves around whether the manufacturer's oral modification of the written contract would be enforceable. The parties initially entered into a written contract, which was in effect. The new agreement is an oral modification. The key considerations are whether the modification is enforceable under the contract law, particularly whether it was in writing and whether there was consideration.

1. **Enforceability of Modifications**: Modifications to contracts are enforceable if the original contract was in writing and the modification is in writing. However, if the parties intended the modification to be enforceable, it may be enforceable even if the agreement is oral. The question hinges on whether the parties intended the modification to be enforceable.

2. **Consideration**: Consideration is an ability to transfer value. The producer offers boxes, which have value, and the manufacturer agrees to supply additional boxes. This indicates that consideration exists, supporting the idea that the modification is enforceable.

3. **Initial Contract**: The initial contract was written, providing clarity and foundation for the modification. The parties were in a contract, so any new agreement is considered a modification, which is enforceable as long as the parties intended it.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The contract was in writing, so it is not unenforceable because the final agreement was the same date.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The pre-existing duty is relevant, but the question focuses on enforceability, not duty.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The Statute of Frauds does not prevent modification as long as the contract was in writing.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The parties' intentions were clear and unambiguous, which supports enforceability.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The contract was in writing, so it is not unenforceable due to non-written terms.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The agreement is a modification, not a new contract.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The parties' intent was clear, supporting enforceability.
   - **Option H**: Correct. The parties' intentions were clear and unambiguous, making the modification enforceable.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The contract was in writing, so it is not unenforceable.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. There is no issue with parol evidence.

The most likely correct answer is **H**, as the parties' clear and unambiguous intentions make the oral modification enforceable.

ANSWER: H
