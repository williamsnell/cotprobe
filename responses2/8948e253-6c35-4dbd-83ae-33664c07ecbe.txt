Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about philosophy, specifically about the works of Anscombe and Kant. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking about what Anscombe criticizes as absurdly similar to Kant's idea. The options are A to J, each with a different concept. I remember that Anscombe was a philosopher who discussed various ideas, especially in the areas of ethics and the philosophy of mind.

Let me start by recalling what each of these options refers to. 

Option A: Postulate of immortality. I think this is related to Descartes' Meditations, where he argues that one's soul is immortal. But Anscombe's work is more about ethical philosophy, so maybe this is not the right choice.

Option B: Autonomous will. Wait, the Autonomous will is a concept from Immanuel Kant's works. He argued that the will is autonomous, meaning that it's not under the control of the brain. So if Anscombe criticizes something akin to this, this might be a contender. But I'm not sure yet.

Option C: Categorical imperative. That's another Kantian term. The categorical imperative says that one must act according to the rules that would benefit the greatest number of people, regardless of individual consequences. So this is a key idea from Kant and a central part of his ethical philosophy.

Option D:legislate for oneself. Hmm, that sounds like Anscombe's critique of utilitarianism. I think Anscombe argued against the idea that reason can dictate what an individual should do because it's not their own interests. So this might be a comparison point.

Option E: Unity of consciousness. I'm not too sure about this. It's possible that Anscombe discussed this, but I'm not certain.

Option F: Transcendental unity of appearance. That sounds like Kant's transcendental philosophy, where the mind and body are connected, but I'm not sure if Anscombe would compare this to something else.

Option G: Phenomenal self. This is about the subjective self, like how we experience ourselves. Maybe similar to Kant's view on the subjective self.

Option H: The thing in itself. That could be similar to the noumenal self, which is something that exists independently of the physical world.

Option I: The noumenal self. Oh, that's the thing in itself, like the self that exists beyond the physical. I remember Anscombe was critical of this idea. He argued that the noumenal self is not accessible to reason because it's beyond the physical.

Option J: The kingdom of ends. That's a concept from John Locke, but I'm not sure if Anscombe would pick this one.

Let me try to piece this together. The question is about what Anscombe criticizes as "absurdly similar" to Kant’s ideas. So I need to find two concepts that are both about self or the self, since that's a big topic in both.

Kant's autonomous will (B) and the noumenal self (I) are both about the self and its autonomy. Wait, actually, Anscombe's critique often centers around the autonomy of reason, the categorical imperative, and the noumenal self. 

Wait, but the question is about what he criticizes as absurdly similar. So if Kant's Autonomous will is about the autonomy of the will, is there an Anscombe similar concept?

Alternatively, the noumenal self is a key point where Anscombe disagrees. He argues that the noumenal self is beyond the realm of reason and cannot be accessed directly. That's a big point in his work.

So, looking at the options, C is categorical imperative, H is the thing in itself. Option I is the noumenal self.

Wait, the question is which one is similar to Kant. So the answer is likely either C, H, or I.

Wait, the question says, "critics as absurd Kant’s idea of." So the answer is either Kant's Autonomous will (B) or the noumenal self (I), or perhaps the categorical imperative (C)?

Wait, the categorical imperative is a central principle in Kant's ethics. I'm not sure about Anscombe's stance on that. She was more focused on the autonomy of reason and the noumenal self.

So, if the question is about comparing concepts, the answer is probably either H or I.

Wait, another thought: the "thing in itself" is a concept that's more about the noumenal self, which is a part of philosophy. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, the autonomous will (B) and the noumenal self (I) both deal with the self's independence. So, I'm a bit stuck between these two.

Wait, the question is about what Anscombe criticizes as similar to Kant. So perhaps the answer is the noumenal self (I), because it's a central point in both.

Alternatively, the categorical imperative is a key point in both. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: I remember that Anscombe's work includes a lot about the autonomy of reason and the noumenal self. The categorical imperative is a point in her philosophy too, but perhaps she didn't have a direct counterpart to it.

So, putting it together, the answer is likely either C or I. But wait, another point: The question is about what is similar to Kant's idea, which is autonomous will (B), so perhaps the noumenal self (I) is more of a direct comparison.

Wait, no, the question is about which one is being criticized as absurdly similar. So which of these is a concept that's similar in nature to Kant's.

So, the autonomous will (B) is about the self's autonomy. The noumenal self (I) is about the self beyond the physical. So both are about the self's independence or self-awareness.

Wait, but the question is about what Anscombe criticizes as absurdly similar. So perhaps the answer is the noumenal self (I), as it's a key point where Anscombe differs from Kant.

Alternatively, both B and I are similar, but the options are separate.

Wait, the answer is likely I. Because the noumenal self (I) is a key concept, and Anscombe was critical of it. So, the answer would be I.

The question asks which concept is being criticized by Anscombe as being "absurdly similar" to Kant's ideas. The correct answer is the noumenal self (I), as it is a central point in both Kant and Anscombe. 

Answer: I
