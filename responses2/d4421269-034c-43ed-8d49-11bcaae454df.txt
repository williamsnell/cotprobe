Okay, so I'm looking at this multiple-choice question about the percentage of children aged 13-15 in the United States who reported being in a physical fight at school. The options are A through J, each with different percentages. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that data on school incidents is often reported by the CDC or other health organizations. But wait, I think recent data might have changed. I'm trying to recall if I've heard any statistics before.

I remember hearing that in 2015, the percentage was around 50-60%. Let me think: 65% was a higher number, but maybe that was for a different time. 45% seems lower than I'd expect for kids in that age group. 50% is a common number I've heard before, especially when discussing school safety.

Wait, I'm trying to remember if the CDC has data. I think the CDC's National School safety and Health Promotion Program reports on this. But I'm not sure about the exact percentage. Alternatively, maybe the CDC has a report on physical fights.

Another angle: I've heard in some sources that in 2015, the percentage was 65%, but maybe that's for all ages, not just 13-15. Or perhaps it's a different year.

Wait, I think the CDC's data might have shown that in 2015, the rate was around 65% for kids under 18. But the question is specifically about 13-15-year-olds. So if the overall rate was 65%, maybe the subgroup is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the CDC's data for 13-15-year-olds in 2015 was 50%. I'm trying to remember. Oh, I think the CDC did report that the rate was 50% for children under 18, but I'm not certain. Or perhaps for the 13-15 age group, it's a bit different.

Wait, another thought: I've heard that in the U.S., physical fights among school-aged children are quite common. I think around 30-40% of students might have reported fights, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I'm mixing that with other incidents.

Wait, no, perhaps the CDC's data for 13-15-year-olds in 2015 was 65%. Or maybe I'm conflating it with another year's data. Alternatively, maybe the CDC's data for 13-15-year-olds was 50% in 2015.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so I need to think differently. Let's look at the options again:

A:65%, B:45%, C:50%, D:5%, E:55%, F:15%, G:35%, H:25%, I:75%, J:85%.

I think that the CDC's data for physical fights among school children in the U.S. was around 50% for 13-15-year-olds in 2015. So the answer might be 50%, which is option C.

Alternatively, maybe the CDC's data for 13-15-year-olds was higher. Wait, I'm not sure. Another approach: I've heard that in some areas, it's higher, but perhaps the overall rate is about 50-60% for the age group.

Wait, another possibility: I think the CDC reported that the percentage was 50% for 13-15-year-olds in 2015. So option C would be the answer.

But wait, I'm also recalling that in 2015, the overall rate might have been around 50%, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the CDC's data for physical fights among school children in the U.S. might have been 50% for 13-15-year-olds in 2015. So that's option C.
