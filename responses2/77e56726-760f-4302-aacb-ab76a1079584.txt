Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about the formation of a solution and the energy involved in the three-step process. Hmm, I remember that when you form a solution, the process involves solvation of ions and the movement of solvent molecules. Let me think through each step.

Step 1 says solvent molecules are separated. I think when the solvent is more polar or something, the solvent molecules don't mix. So perhaps in this step, the solvent molecules are moving apart. If they're moving apart, that would require energy. Like, breaking some bonds. So step 1 is endothermic because it's absorbing energy to separate the solvent.

Step 2 is about solute molecules fitting into the solvent's spaces. The solute is smaller, so it needs to enter the solvent. I'm guessing that would involve some work against the solvent's forces. Like, making space. So maybe this step is also endothermic because it's putting energy into the system to make way for the solute.

Step 3 is bringing the separated solute and solvent together. The solvent molecules are in their original state, and the solute is now in the solution. I'm not sure about the energy here. Some energy might be released when the solute enters the solvent, like the solute molecules start interacting with the solvent. But is that exothermic or endothermic? Or maybe some work is done. I'm a bit confused. Wait, when the solute and solvent interact, perhaps the process is exothermic because the energy is released as the solute absorbs energy from the solvent. Or maybe it's endothermic because the solute is taking energy from the solvent. Hmm, I might need to think about the overall enthalpy change.

Wait, the overall process of making a solution. The first step involves breaking solvent-solvent bonds. That's endothermic. The second step involves solute-solvent interactions, perhaps releasing some energy. So step 2 might be exothermic. Or maybe not. I'm a bit stuck on step 3.

The question is about the energy involved in each step. Let me recall: when you have a solution, the process involves solvation. The solute dissolves, which releases energy (exothermic), but wait, isn't that when you do something that causes the system to lose energy? Or is it the reverse?

Wait, no. Let me think about it. When you dissolve something, the process is typically exothermic because the energy required to break the solute-solute and solvent-solvent bonds is less than the energy released during solute-solvent interactions. So the net is exothermic.

But I'm not sure if each step is exothermic or endothermic. Let's go back to the steps.

Step 1: Separating solvent molecules. To separate them, you have to break their bonds. So that's endothermic.

Step 2: Solute molecules entering the solvent. Solute is smaller, so they have to get into the solvent, which might involve some work. Or perhaps the solute molecules are more tightly held, so they need energy. Wait, but in the context of dissolving, the process is endothermic. So perhaps step 2 is endothermic. Because the solute is being added, and that requires energy.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think about the process. When a solute dissolves, the solute molecules are attracted to the solvent's ions, releasing energy. So the dissolution process is exothermic. But the steps involved in dissolving—the breaking of solvent molecules and the solute's presence—are part of that process.

So, step 1 is breaking solvent solvent bonds → endothermic.

Step 2: solute entering → perhaps the solute is getting into the solvent. But in terms of energy, when you bring the solute into the solvent, you have to overcome the solute's own attraction to the solvent. So that's exothermic. Or wait, if the solute is getting in, maybe it's absorbing energy because it's going to interact with the solvent, which releases energy. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Step 3: Bringing the solute and solvent together. The solute is in the solution, the solvent is in the same state as before. So perhaps the solute and solvent are interacting, which releases energy. Or maybe the solvent is bringing the solute back, so maybe the solvent is absorbing energy.

Wait, perhaps each step involves a change in the arrangement. So step 1 is solvent separation, which is endothermic. Step 2 is solute entering, which is endothermic as well. Step 3 is bringing them together, which might involve releasing energy.

But wait, the overall process is endothermic because you're forming a solution, which requires absorbing energy. So the steps must have a net endothermic process.

Wait, but the question is about whether each step is exothermic or endothermic.

So, Step 1: Separating solvent molecules → endothermic.

Step 2: Solute entering → endothermic. Because the solute is getting into the solvent, which may require energy.

But wait, if you think about the dissolution, the overall process is exothermic. So perhaps step 2 is exothermic. Because the solute is getting into the solution, but that might release energy. But I'm not so sure.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is endothermic because the solute is absorbing energy to fit into the solvent.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the overall process. When you dissolve a solute, you're breaking the solute-solute bonds (endothermic) and the solvent-solvent bonds (endothermic), but when the solute enters, it's perhaps releasing energy (exothermic). So overall, the dissolution is endothermic.

But the question is about each step. Let's think about each step's nature.

Step 1: Separating solvent molecules. To separate, you have to break their bonds. That's endothermic.

Step 2: Solute molecules are separated into the solvent. Wait, no, step 2 is more about solute molecules entering the solvent. So the solvent is already in a state where the solvent molecules are in their original form. The solute is small, so perhaps it's now taking space in the solvent. So to do that, the solute must bind to the solvent, which releases energy. So step 2 is exothermic.

Step 3: Bringing the solute and solvent together. The solvent is in its original state, the solute is in solution. So when they are brought together, perhaps the solvent is absorbing the solute's energy. Or perhaps the solute is pulling the solvent molecules into its structure. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the solute and solvent are now in a more ordered state, which releases energy. So step 3 is exothermic.

Wait, but if step 1 is endothermic, step 2 exothermic, step 3 exothermic, then the total steps would be endothermic plus two exothermic. So overall, it's net endothermic. But that can't be right because the dissolution of a solid in water is endothermic. Because you have to break the bonds in the solute and solvent, and the process releases energy as the solute and solvent interact.

Wait, but the steps are about the process of dissolution. So the steps are:

1: Solvent breaks bonds → endothermic.

2: Solvent and solute interact → exothermic.

3: Solvent and solute interact again → exothermic.

So overall, the first step is endothermic, the next two are exothermic. So the total would be endothermic + exothermic + exothermic → net exothermic. But that's not right because the dissolution is endothermic.

Wait, no. Because when you form a solution, the process is endothermic. So the net should be endothermic. So if step 1 is endothermic, but steps 2 and 3 are exothermic, then the overall process would be endothermic (step1) plus two exothermic steps (steps 2 and 3), which would be net endothermic. But that can't be, because the dissolution is endothermic. So that suggests that perhaps my earlier understanding is incorrect.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the overall process. The formation of a solution is an endothermic process because the system absorbs energy. So the three steps must have a net endothermic change.

So, for the steps:

Step 1: Solvent separation → endothermic.

Step 2: Solute entering → endothermic.

Step 3: Bringing together → exothermic.

So the net would be endothermic + endothermic - exothermic = endothermic + (endothermic - exothermic). But wait, endothermic plus exothermic would be... Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the total enthalpy change.

The overall process is endothermic, so the sum of the steps' enthalpy changes should be positive.

If step 1 is endothermic (ΔH positive), step 2 is endothermic (ΔH positive), step 3 is exothermic (ΔH negative), then the total would be positive only if the sum is positive.

But if the first two steps are endothermic and the third is exothermic, perhaps step 3 is exo. So let's say:

ΔH_total = (step1) + (step2) + (step3) = + (endothermic) + (+) (endothermic) + (-) (exo) = total could be positive or not.

Wait, but the total for the dissolution is positive. So if steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and step 3 is exothermic, then the net would be positive.

But let me think about each step's enthalpy.

Alternatively, each step could be as follows:

Step 1: Solvent separation → breaking solvent-solvent bonds → endothermic.
Step 2: Solute entering → solute is smaller, so it must fit into solvent. For the solute to fit, it has to attract the solvent, which might release energy. So step 2 is exothermic.
Step 3: Bringing solute and solvent together → bringing them together can release energy. So step 3 is exothermic.

Wait, but if the overall process is endothermic, then steps 1 (endothermic) plus steps 2 (exothermic) plus steps 3 (exothermic) would imply that the net is endothermic + (exothermic - exothermic) → net endothermic. So the overall process would be endothermic, which matches.

So that would make overall steps: endothermic (step1) + exothermic (step2) + exothermic (step3) → which would sum to endothermic because exothermic (steps 2 and 3) could be considered as negative. For example, if step 2 is -100 and step 3 is -100, then step 1 is +200. So 200 - 100 - 100 = 0? No, that would sum to zero. Hmm, not matching the dissolution.

Wait, when you form a solution, the process is endothermic, so the sum of the steps' enthalpy should be positive. So let's think of each step's enthalpy change.

Step 1: Solvent separation → breaking solvent-solvent bonds → endothermic. So ΔH1 is positive.

Step 2: Solute enters → solute is small, so it's now in the solvent. The solute gains energy to fit in the solvent, perhaps. So ΔH2 is positive (endothermic). Wait, but when you bring in the solute, it has to interact with the solvent. If the solute starts in its solid state, perhaps it's more tightly bound, so when it comes in, it might require energy. So step 2 is endothermic.

Step 3: Bringing the solute and solvent together. The solvent is already in a certain state, and the solute is now dissolved. The interaction between them would release energy. So step 3 is exothermic (ΔH3 is negative).

So putting it all together:

ΔH_total = ΔH1 + ΔH2 + ΔH3 = (+) + (+) + (-) = ?

We need the total to be positive (endothermic).

If step 3 is exothermic, then the sum of the first two steps must be greater than the step 3's exothermic.

So if ΔH1 + ΔH2 = 500 J, and ΔH3 = -300 J, then the total is 200 J, which is positive.

But how about step 2? Is it endothermic or exothermic?

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is exothermic. Let's reevaluate.

If step 1 is endothermic, step 2 is exothermic, and step 3 is endothermic. Then:

ΔH_total = (+) + (-) + (+) → what's the sum?

If step 1 is +100, step 2 is -100, step 3 is +100. Total is +100. So that's endothermic. So the overall process is endothermic, which matches.

But I'm not sure about step 2's enthalpy. Let's think.

When you dissolve a solid, the solute is small, so it needs to enter the solvent. The process is endothermic because the solute has to absorb energy to fit. So step 2 is endothermic.

Wait, but if step 2 is exothermic, then the overall would be endo (step 1) + exo (step 2) + endo (step 3) → net could be endo or exo? Let's say step 1 is +100, step 2 is -100, step 3 is +100. So total is +100. So endothermic. That's correct.

So in that case, step 1 is endo, step 2 is exo, step 3 is endo.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the overall process. Solubility. When you dissolve a solid, you have to break solvent-solvent bonds (endothermic). Then, when the solute is in the solution, the solute-solvent interactions release energy (exothermic). The same happens when the solvent is formed again. So the overall process is endothermic.

So the three steps would be:

Step 1: Solvent breaks bonds → endothermic.

Step 2: Solvent and solute interact → exothermic.

Step 3: Solvent and solute interact again → exothermic.

So the total is (endothermic) + (exo) + (exo) → which is endothermic? Because exothermic steps are negative in enthalpy.

So let's consider the enthalpy change.

Assume each step's enthalpy:

Step 1: +100 (endothermic)
Step 2: -100 (exo)
Step 3: -100 (exo)
Total: 100 + (-100) + (-100) = -100. That's an exothermic process, which doesn't match.

Wait, that can't be right because the dissolution is endothermic.

I must have made a mistake in the assignment of exo and endo.

Let me correct: perhaps step 2 is endothermic, step 3 is exothermic.

In that case, step 1: +100, step2: +100, step3: -100. Total: 100 + 100 -100 = 100 → positive. So the overall process is endothermic, which matches the dissolution.

So, the three steps would be:

Step 1: endothermic (separate solvent)
Step 2: endothermic (solvent and solute interact)
Step 3: exothermic (solvent and solute interact again)

So, step 1 and 2 are endothermic, step 3 is exothermic.

Now, looking at the options, which one says that.

Looking at the options:

Option B says all three are endothermic. No, because step 3 is exothermic.

Option C: Steps 1 and 3 are exothermic, step 2 is endothermic. No, step 1 and 2 are endo.

Option D: All three steps are exothermic. No, step 1 and 2 are endo.

Option E: Steps 1 and 2 are endo, step 3 exo. That fits.

So the correct option is E.

The formation of a solution involves three distinct steps, and the question asks about the energy changes associated with each step. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Solvent molecules are separated from each other to make space for the solute.**  
   Breaking solvent-solvent bonds requires energy, so this step is **endothermic**.

2. **Step 2: Solute molecules are separated so they fit into spaces in the solvent.**  
   The solute is smaller and must fit into the solvent's available spaces. This process releases energy as the solute interacts with the solvent, making it **exothermic**.

3. **Step 3: Separated solute and solvent are brought together, filling in the spaces.**  
   Bringing the solute and solvent together involves interactions that release energy, so this step is **exothermic**.

The overall process of forming a solution is endothermic because it requires the absorption of energy to break solvent-solvent bonds and for the solute to interact with the solvent. The three steps are consistent with this outcome. 

- Step 1: Endothermic  
- Step 2: Exothermic  
- Step 3: Exothermic  

This matches the description in **Option E**, which states: *Steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and step 3 is exothermic.*
