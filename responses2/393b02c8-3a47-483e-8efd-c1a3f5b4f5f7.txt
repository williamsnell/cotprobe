Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. It's about Hermitian operators. Hmm, okay, I remember that Hermitian operators are important because they have real eigenvalues, right? Like, when you measure an observable, you get a real number. So which of the given operators are Hermitian?

The question is asking about d/dx, id/dx (which I think is also the same as d/dx), and d²/dx². Wait, no, wait. Wait, the operators are d/dx and d²/dx². Or wait, the question says the last character is the operator, so the options are about which are Hermitian. Let me read the question again.

Oh wait, the question says: Which of the following operators is Hermitian; d/dx, id/dx, d²/dx²? So the three operators are d/dx, d²/dx².

Wait, no, wait. The wording says the operators are d/dx, id/dx, d^2/dx^2. Oh wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me parse the question again.

The question is: Which of the following operators is Hermitian; d/dx, id/dx, d²/dx²? So the options are A: none are Hermitian, B: b and c are Hermitian, C: only a is Hermitian, D: all are Hermitian. But wait, the options are A,B,C,D, and I think the question is about which of the three (d/dx, id/dx, d²/dx²) are Hermitian. So the possible answers are which of these three are Hermitian. So the operators are A) d/dx, B) id/dx, C) d²/dx².

Wait, but the question says " operators" which are each of these. So the possible correct options are about these three.

Wait, I think I need to recall what Hermitian operators are. An operator is Hermitian if it satisfies H = H†, where H† is the adjoint of H. For a differential operator, the adjoint can be found using integration by parts.

Take the first operator, d/dx. Let's see. For a function f(x), the action of d/dx on f is (df/dx). The adjoint of this operator would be the operator whose effect is to integrate by parts. So, the adjoint operator would be d/dx. Because for any functions f and g, the integral of f*(d g/dx) dx would be equal to the integral of (df/dx) g* dx, perhaps with an integration by parts. Let me write it out:

∫ f* d(g)/dx dx = ∫ f* (dg/dx) dx = -∫ (df/dx) g dx + f g evaluated at the boundaries.

Wait, the integration by parts formula is ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du. So, if I take u = f* and dv = dg/dx dx, then du = df*/dx dx and v = g. So the integral becomes f* g - ∫ g (df*/dx) dx.

Comparing this to the integral of (d/dx)(f) * g dx. Wait, the original operator is d/dx, so the operator acting on f is df/dx. So the adjoint would be the operator (d/dx), because when you take the adjoint, you get the same operator. Because the integral of f* (d g/dx) dx equals the integral of (d f*/dx) g dx, but that would mean that (d/dx)† = d/dx, because the integration by parts shows that.

Wait, no. Because the adjoint operator would change the sign of the integral. Let me think about this again.

Wait, the Hermitian condition is that H† = H. So for the operator H = d/dx, H† would be the operator that satisfies <f|H† g> = <H f|g> for all f and g. Let's compute <f|H† g>:

It's ∫ f* (H† g) dx = ∫ f* [d/dx g] dx = ∫ f* dg/dx dx.

Now, integrating by parts, ∫ f* dg/dx dx = [f* g] (from -inf to inf) - ∫ (f*)' g dx.

So, for this to be equal to ∫ (d f*/dx) g dx, the boundary terms must vanish. So [f* g] must be zero at the boundaries. If the functions are square-integrable and we're considering operators on L² functions, then if f and g are such that f and g vanish at infinity, the boundary terms would be zero. So the integral becomes -∫ (f*)' g dx. But this must equal ∫ (d f*/dx) g dx. So -∫ (f*)' g dx = ∫ (d f*/dx) g dx. Which would require that (d f*/dx) is equal to - (f*)' because of the negative sign.

Wait, actually, the integration by parts gives:

∫ f* dg/dx dx = [f* g] - ∫ (f*)' g dx.

So, for [f* g] to be zero, we need f* and g to vanish at the boundaries. So, if the functions are in the domain where that's true, then:

∫ f* dg/dx dx = - ∫ (f*)' g dx.

But according to the Hermitian condition, this must also be equal to ∫ (d f*/dx) g dx.

So, for equality to hold, we have:

- ∫ (f*)' g dx = ∫ (d f*/dx) g dx.

Which implies that (d f*/dx) = - (f*)' ?

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think. Let's take H = d/dx, so H† would be the operator that satisfies:

∫ f* (H† g) dx = ∫ (H f) * g dx.

So, ∫ f* d g/dx dx = ∫ d f * g dx.

Which is the same as ∫ f* dg/dx dx = ∫ (d f*)/dx g dx.

So, for the equality to hold for all f and g, we require that d g/dx dx = (d f*)/dx g dx. So, the differential operators must satisfy this for any f and g. The only way this can hold is if d/dx is Hermitian.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think of the adjoint as a differential operator.

The adjoint of d/dx is d/dx, because when you integrate by parts, you get the same form.

Alternatively, perhaps the integration by parts leads to the adjoint operator being the same as the original operator. So, for d/dx, its adjoint is d/dx. So d/dx is Hermitian.

Similarly, what about d^2/dx^2? Let's think about the operator H = d²/dx². What's its adjoint?

Again, using integration by parts:

∫ f* H g dx = ∫ f* (d² g/dx²) dx.

Let me integrate by parts once. Let u = f*; dv = d² g/dx² dx.

Then du = (df*/dx) dx, and v = dg/dx.

So ∫ u dv = u v - ∫ v du.

So, ∫ f* d² g/dx² dx = f* (dg/dx) | - ∫ (dg/dx) (df*/dx) dx.

Now, integrate the second term by parts again. Let u = g/dx; dv = df*/dx dx.

Then du = (d² g/dx²) dx, v = f*.

So, ∫ (dg/dx) (df*/dx) dx = (dg/dx) f* | - ∫ f* (d² g/dx²) dx.

Putting it all together:

∫ f* d² g/dx² dx = [f* dg/dx] - ∫ (dg/dx) (df*/dx) dx

= [f* dg/dx] - [ (dg/dx) f* + ∫ f* d² g/dx² dx ]

Wait, the second term is -( [f* dg/dx] - ∫ f* d² g/dx² dx )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it step by step.

Wait, let me do it correctly:

First integration by parts:

∫ f* d² g/dx² dx = f* (dg/dx) | from -infty to infinity - ∫ (df*/dx) (dg/dx) dx.

Integrate the second term by parts again.

∫ (df*/dx) (dg/dx) dx = (df*/dx) g | from -infty to infinity - ∫ g (d² f*/dx²) dx.

Putting it all together:

∫ f* d² g/dx² dx = [f* (dg/dx) - (df*/dx) g ] from boundaries + ∫ g (d² f*/dx²) dx.

So,

LHS = ∫ f* d² g/dx² dx.

RHS = [f* dg/dx - df*/dx g ] + ∫ g d² f*/dx² dx.

But for the operator H = d²/dx² to be Hermitian, we need:

∫ f* H g dx = ∫ H f* g dx.

So, the LHS is ∫ f* d² g/dx² dx, and the RHS after integrating by parts is [f* dg/dx - df*/dx g ] + ∫ g d² f*/dx² dx.

Wait, but for Hermitian, LHS must equal RHS. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can make it Hermitian by considering whether the boundary terms are zero.

Wait, perhaps the operator H is Hermitian if the boundary terms vanish, which happens when f and g are such that f* g and its derivatives vanish at the boundaries. So, if the functions vanish at infinity, then the boundary terms are zero.

So, ∫ f* d² g/dx² dx = 0 + ∫ g d² f*/dx² dx.

But that would imply that ∫ f* d² g/dx² dx = ∫ g d² f*/dx² dx.

Which would mean that d²/dx² is Hermitian, because H† would be H, so H is Hermitian.

Wait, but is that correct? Because when you take the adjoint, it's not necessarily the same operator. Maybe I should think about the inner product.

Wait, the Hermitian condition is H† = H. So for d²/dx², is it equal to d²/dx²? Let's think about the integral.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to treat H as an operator and compute its adjoint. So, H = d²/dx².

Then the adjoint operator H† must satisfy <f|H† g> = <H f |g > for all f and g.

Compute <f|H† g>:

∫ f* H† g dx = ∫ f* (H† g) dx.

We need this to equal ∫ (H f)* g dx = ∫ (d² (f*)/dx²) g dx.

So, we need ∫ f* H† g dx = ∫ (d² (f*)/dx²) g dx.

But H = d²/dx², so H† must be such that applying it to g gives d² g/dx², because then ∫ f* H† g dx = ∫ f* d² g/dx² dx, which equals the integral of (d² f*/dx²) g dx, which is the same as the integral of (H f)* g dx.

Wait, that's correct! Because ∫ f* d² g/dx² dx = ∫ (d² f*/dx²) g dx.

Which is the same as ∫ (H f)* g dx. So, that means H† = H. So, H = H†, so H is Hermitian.

Wait, so that suggests all three operators are Hermitian. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake here because I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. Wait, H = d²/dx². So, when we take the adjoint, we have H†. But when we computed it, it turned out that H† = H. So, H is Hermitian.

So, all three operators: d/dx, d²/dx², and is the id/dx (same operator?) Wait, the question says d/dx, id/dx, d²/dx². Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me read the question again.

The question says: which of the following operators is Hermitian; d/dx, id/dx, d^2/dx^2?

Wait, 'id' is identity operator. So, the options are three operators: d/dx, id/dx, and d²/dx².

Wait, wait, the question says: "d/dx, id/dx, d^2/dx^2". So, each one is an operator.

Wait, no. The question says: the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen. So perhaps the options are A through J, each letter corresponding to one of the four options.

Wait, the options are A: none are Hermitian, B: b and c are Hermitian, C: only a is Hermitian, D: all are Hermitian.

Wait, the question asks, which of the following operators (d/dx, id/dx, d²/dx²) are Hermitian.

So, the first operator is d/dx. The second is id/dx, which is same as d/dx. The third is d²/dx².

Wait, no, because the options don't list three operators. Oh, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again: "Which of the following operators isHermitian; d/dx, id/dx, d^2/dx^2?" So, the options are A: none are Hermitian, B: b and c are Hermitian, C: only a is Hermitian, D: all are Hermitian.

Wait, so the operators are d/dx, id/dx, and d²/dx². But in the options, B says 'b and c are Hermitian'—so perhaps the options are referring to the three as a, b, c. Wait, perhaps the first operator is d/dx as option A, id/dx as option B, and d^2/dx^2 as option C.

Alternatively, maybe the options are each the three operators. But the given options are A: none, B: two, C: one, D: all.

Wait, but the question is: which of the following operators (d/dx, id/dx, d²/dx²) are Hermitian.

So, the three are:

a) d/dx,

b) id/dx,

c) d²/dx².

But the options only have A to D, each corresponding to one of the three. Wait, perhaps the options are for each individual operator.

Wait, but the options don't seem to list three options. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says: which of the following operators isHermitian; d/dx, id/dx, d^2/dx^2? So, it's asking about each of these three operators. So, for each option, the operator is either a, b, c.

Wait, perhaps the way the options are written is a bit confusing. Let me think as the user. The user gives the possible answers as A: none are Hermitian, B: b and c are Hermitian, C: only a is Hermitian, D: all are Hermitian.

But the question is about three operators, so perhaps the options are about each of the three. Alternatively, perhaps the options are not for the three operators, but for each of the three. Maybe I should instead think about each operator individually.

So, considering each operator:

1. d/dx: as I thought before, its adjoint is d/dx, so it's Hermitian.

2. id/dx: same as d/dx, so it's also Hermitian.

3. d²/dx²: as I calculated earlier, it's Hermitian.

So all three are Hermitian. So option D says all are Hermitian.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure. Because for the operator d²/dx², in some cases, you might need to consider boundary terms. Wait, earlier when I integrated by parts, I found that H = d²/dx², and H† = H, so it's Hermitian.

But wait, the integration by parts process I did earlier didn't require any boundary terms unless f and g vanish at infinity. So, if functions are in L², and we're considering operators on square-integrable functions, then ∫ f* H g dx = ∫ g H f* dx, because the boundary terms cancel (assuming they vanish, which they do if the function and its derivatives go to zero at infinity). So, yes, H is Hermitian.

So, all three operators are Hermitian.

Wait, but wait again. Another thought: The operator d/dx, when considering operators on functions, is Hermitian. But, wait, is it?

Wait, let me think about the general self-adjoint condition. For a differential operator like a d²/dx² + b d/dx + c, it's Hermitian if a is real and the coefficients are real. But here, a is 1 (for d²), which is real, b is 0, and c is 0. So, the operator is Hermitian.

Wait, but wait, in the case of d²/dx², is it Hermitian? Because the integration by parts led us to the conclusion yes.

So, given that, all three operators are Hermitian. So the correct answer is D: all are Hermitian.
</think>

To determine which of the given operators are Hermitian, we analyze the operators \( \frac{d}{dx} \), \( \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \), and \( \frac{id}{dx} \) (assuming \( \frac{d}{dx} \) is intended to be the same operator).

### 1. Operator \( \frac{d}{dx} \)
- The adjoint of \( \frac{d}{dx} \) is \( \frac{d}{dx} \) because integration by parts shows that the boundary terms vanish (assuming the functions vanish at infinity).
- Therefore, \( \frac{d}{dx} \) is Hermitian.

### 2. Operator \( \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \)
- The adjoint of \( \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \) is \( \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \) because integration by parts confirms that the boundary terms vanish under the same assumptions.
- Therefore, \( \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \) is Hermitian.

### 3. Operator \( \frac{d}{dx} \) (same as \( \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \))
- As shown above, \( \frac{d}{dx} \) is Hermitian.

### Conclusion
All three operators \( \frac{d}{dx} \), \( \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \), and \( \frac{d}{dx} \) (same as \( \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \)) are Hermitian.
