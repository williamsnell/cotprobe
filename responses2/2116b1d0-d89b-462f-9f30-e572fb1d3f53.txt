Question:

This jurisdiction has the following bribery statute in effect:"Any person who offers or gives a thing of value to a government officeholder in exchange for official action is guilty of bribery. "A real estate developer owned a large parcel of land in the suburbs. Although the developer wanted to build an office building on the property, the land was zoned residential. Due to the residential zoning, the developer could not pursue his planned development unless he received a variance from the building commission. The developer held a meeting with a member of the building commission to solicit his approval in securing a zoning variance. To do so, the developer gave the commission member $10,000 in exchange for his support in approving the zoning variance. Thereupon, the commission member voted to approve the variance, thus making it possible for the developer to commence construction of the office building. The developer was subsequently prosecuted for conspiracy to commit bribery. During the course of the trial, the commission member testified that he faked the agreement with the developer and would have approved the zoning variance regardless of whether the developer gave him any money. Furthermore, in his defense, the developer presented evidence that the other six members of the building commission voted affirmatively to approve the variance. If the jury believed that the commission member would have approved the variance even had he not received the $10,000, the developer should be found

Options:

A: guilty, because the commission member's agreement to accept the $10,000 was sufficient to form a conspiratorial objective.
B: guilty, because he gave the commission member the $10,000 in exchange for his approval of the zoning variance.
C: not guilty, because the commission member did not receive a thing of value, since he would have approved the variance regardless of receiving any payment from the developer.
D: not guilty, because there was no true agreement between the parties.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question about bribery and conspiratorial objectives. Let me read through it again.

The case is about a real estate developer who wanted to build an office building but faced residential zoning. The developer couldn't proceed without a zoning variance from the building commission. He talked to a commission member and asked for $10,000 to get that variance. The commission member agreed, and the developer started building. The developer was charged with conspiracy to commit bribery, and the commission member testified that he faked the deal. The developer presented evidence that six other commission members approved the variance regardless of the $10,000.

The question is about the legal consequence for the developer based on the evidence presented.

So, I remember from my studies that bribes require a specific kind of agreement. The statute here says that any person offering or giving a thing of value to a government officeholder in exchange for official action is guilty. So, the key here is that the bribe must be of value, and there must be an official action. 

In this case, the developer gave the commission $10,000. But wait, is that a thing of value? Because the statute says 'a thing of value.' So, if the bribe is money, then it's not a thing of value. I think that means the developer isn't committing bribery because he's not offering something of value.

But wait, maybe the commission member's willingness to give the money is a form of bribery. Because the commission member is giving the developer money as a bribe. But the question goes on to say that the developer presented evidence that the other six members approved the variance, regardless of the money. So, the money was given but not used, right?

In the trial, the commission member testified that he faked the agreement. But the other six members said they approved regardless. So, the money wasn't used, but the developer had to give it anyway. But the commission member is being accused of lying.

So, the key issue is whether the agreement is considered a thing of value. Since the bribe is money, which is not a thing of value, the agreement wasn't part of the conspiracy. The conspiracy would require that the parties agreed to something of value, like a lesson or a bribe, and that the exchange was part of an official action.

In this case, the developer gave money, which is not a thing of value, so the agreement isn't considered a thing. Therefore, the developer isn't guilty of bribery because he wasn't offering something of value.

But wait, the question is whether the developer is guilty for conspiring. If the agreement isn't a thing of value, then there's no conspiracy. So, the answer would be option D: not guilty, because there was no true agreement between the parties.

Alternatively, let me think again. Another angle: if the developer is offering money as a bribe, but the money wasn't used, does that count as a form of bribery? Or is the payment just a partial bribe and not a thing of value, so no.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So, the statute requires an exchange for official action. The developer offered money to get the zoning variance. But the commission member's agreement wasn't in writing, and the developer presented evidence that the other six approved it regardless of the money. The commission member lied, claiming he didn't give the money. So, the money wasn't used, but the developer still gave it.

But does that mean he's lying about the payment? Or did the money serve as a bribe, making it a thing of value.

Wait, the money is a thing of value, so the developer is offering it as a bribe. But the commission member is lying about how much he got. But the question is about whether the agreement (which includes the $10,000) was considered a thing of value.

So, the agreement is between the developer and the commission member. The developer gave the money, and the commission member gave it back. So, the money is part of the agreement. But the agreement is not a thing of value because it's money, not something tangible. So, the developer isn't committing bribery because the agreement isn't a thing.

Therefore, the answer would be D: not guilty, because there was no true agreement.

Wait, but another thought. In some jurisdictions, even if there's a form of bribery, if the agreement isn't in writing, it might be considered a fraud and not true. But the question says that the developer presented evidence that the other six approved regardless, meaning the agreement was in place. So, the agreement is there, but the commission member lied about getting the money.

But the key point for the crime is that the agreement must be of value. So money isn't of value, so no.

So the correct answer should be D.

The question revolves around whether the real estate developer is guilty of bribery based on the evidence presented. The key issue lies in whether the agreement between the developer and the building commission member constitutes a "thing of value" required for bribery under the jurisdiction's statute.

1. **Understanding the statute**: The statute requires an exchange for "official action," meaning the agreement must be of value. If the bribe is money, it is not of value, and thus not a thing of value.

2. **Nature of the payment**: The developer gave the commission member $10,000 as part of the agreement. However, this payment was not used to secure the zoning variance. The commission member testified that he faked the agreement, claiming agreement would have been approved regardless of the payment. The developer presented evidence that the other six members approved the variance, suggesting the agreement was in place.

3. **Form of bribery**: The developer presented evidence that the commission member's agreement was part of an official action, which supports the claim that the agreement was in fact used for its intended purpose (obtaining the zoning variance). However, the key issue is whether the agreement was "true" and of value.

4. **Effect of the payment**: The payment is not of value, so the agreement between the developer and the commission member does not meet the criteria for bribery. Even if the commission member lied about the payment, the agreement itself was not of value.

5. **Conclusion**: Since the developer did not offer something of value (money) in the agreement and the commission member's behavior did not constitute a true agreement, the developer is not guilty of bribery.
