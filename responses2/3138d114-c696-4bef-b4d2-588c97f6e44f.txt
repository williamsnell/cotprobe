Okay, so I've got this question here about Mr. Carson's note and its maturity date. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says he signed a note as payment for a debt on March 15, and the note has a term of two months. I'm supposed to find out what the maturity date was. The options are from A to J, each with different dates.

First, I need to clarify what "two months" means in terms of time. I think it's a period of time, so two months from March 15. But wait, sometimes "month" can be a bit ambiguous. Is it referring to a calendar month (like April, May, etc.) or a business month (which is 30 days)? I'm not entirely sure, but I think in financial terms, "month" usually means the calendar month, not the business day. So two calendar months from March 15 would be May 15, right? Because March has 31 days, so adding two months would be May.

Wait, no. Let's think again. March is month 3. Two months from March 15 would be March + 2 months = May 15. So the maturity date would be May 15. Looking at the options, that's option B.

But wait, wait. Another possibility is that the term is exactly two months, meaning the period is exactly two months from the date of issue. So starting from March 15, adding two months would be May 15, because March 15 plus March is April 15, plus another month is May 15. So that's correct.

So the answer should be option B: May 15.
