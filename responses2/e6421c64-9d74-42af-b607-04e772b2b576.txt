Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contracts and their assignments. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which of the options is NOT an exception to the assignment of contractual rights. I remember that in contracts, an assignment is when one party transfers their rights to another. But there are certain situations where this isn't allowed. 

Let me go through each option:

Option A: An assignment that substantially changes obligor's duty or risk. I think this is an exception. When the obligor's duty or risk changes, they can assign the rights to the new party. So A is an exception.

Option B: An assignment that changes the nature of the contract. Oh, right, the nature of the contract can change, like making it more or less binding. So B is another exception.

Option C: An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk. Wait, if you're assigning and continuing your duty or risk, isn't that the same as assigning normally? Or is there a scenario where you can't do that? I'm a bit confused here. Oh, wait, I think if the original assignment already involved continuing, then you can't assign further because it's already a part of the contract. So maybe C is NOT an exception. Or wait, no, perhaps the exception is when the assignment doesn't continue, or perhaps it's allowed. Hmm, I'm not too sure. Let's think again. 

Option D: An assignment that transfers rights to an incapable party. That rings a bell. I remember something about the Limitation of Liability clause. If the obligor can't perform, they can't assign the rights to another party. So D is an exception.

Option E: An assignment that causes undue hardship or loss to the obligor. Oh, yes, that's a standard exception. If the obligor is undue affected, they can't assign, which is E.

Option F: An assignment that reduces the value of the contract to the obligor. I think this is allowed. The contract can be reduced in value, so F is an exception.

Option G: An assignment of future rights from future contracts. Hmm, I'm not sure. Assigning rights from future contracts sounds complicated. If the obligor wants to assign a right that will come from a future contract, perhaps this isn't allowed. Or maybe it is possible if it's a present assignment. I'm a bit stuck on this one.

Option H: An assignment that is made without the consent of the other party. Oh, that's definitely not allowed. Without consent, the assignment can't happen. So H is definitely an exception.

Option I: An assignment not allowed by law. Well, that's a broad statement. If all other exceptions are covered, then I would think this is correct if someone can think of other exceptions.

Wait, let me get back to option C. The question is, can an assignment continue the obligor's duty or risk? If the obligor is already continuing, then they can't assign further because the contract is already in a state where they can't assign. So in that case, C would be an exception. But wait, no, if the assignment does continue, then it's not allowed. So the exception would be when the assignment does not continue. Oh, so if the obligor is assigned but doesn't continue, then that's an exception. But option C says "continues" – which would not be an exception. So if someone assigns and it continues, that's not an exception. So the exception would be when the assignment does not continue. So C is not an exception – it's a rule. So the question is which is not an exception. So if someone assigns but continues, that's allowed, so C is not an exception. Wait, but the way the question is phrased, which is not an exception. So the question is which is not an exception. So if an assignment continues, that's allowed, so it's not an exception, making C not an exception. But wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's try to think again.

Wait, the question is asking which is NOT an exception. So the exception is when the assignment does not allow the transfer. So the non-exception is when it's allowed. So the exception would be when the assignment is not allowed. So option C is the exception because if the obligor is assigned and continues their obligations, that's allowed. So option C is an exception, so the question is which is not an exception. Therefore, the correct answer would be the one that's not allowed, which would be either E or another.

Wait, let's go back. The options are:

Which is NOT an exception? So I need to find the one that is allowed.

So let me list the exceptions again:

A: Yes, change in duty or risk.

B: Yes, change in contract type.

C: Not an exception because if the assignment continues, it's allowed. So if the assignment continues, it's allowed. So C is not an exception.

Wait, no. Because the question is which is not an exception. So if the assignment continues, that's allowed, so C would not be an exception because it's allowed. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the exception is when the assignment doesn't continue. So option C is the exception because if the assignment continues, it's allowed. So the option that's not an exception would be when the assignment doesn't continue. Or perhaps I should think of it as the exception is when the assignment doesn't continue. So if the obligor is assigned but continues, that's allowed, so that's the exception. So the exception is when the assignment doesn't continue. So the question is which is not an exception, meaning which is allowed.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option as either an exception or not.

Let me think of the general exceptions:

1. Assignment that substantially changes obligor's duty or risk: Yes.

2. Assignment that changes the nature: Yes.

3. Assignment that continues: No, because if the obligor is assigned and continues, that's allowed. So this is an exception. So if someone assigns and continues, it's allowed, so it's an exception. Thus, the option that is not an exception would be when the assignment doesn't continue. Or, perhaps the exception is when the obligor is assigned and continues, so the exception is when the assignment does not continue. So the question is asking which is not an exception. So the correct answer is the one that is not allowed. So which option is allowed? Which is not allowed.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.

The question is asking which of the following is NOT an exception. So the correct answer is the one that is allowed.

Let me go through each:

A: Yes, change in duty or risk. So not an exception.

B: Yes, change in contract type. Not an exception.

C: If the assignment continues, it's allowed. So C is not an exception because if the assignment doesn't continue, it's an exception. So the question is which is NOT an exception, so C is not an exception.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the options are all possible exceptions. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk. No, that's the exception because the assignment continues. So if the assignment continues, it's allowed, so it's an exception.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of it as which is not allowed.

The question is which is NOT an exception. So options that are allowed are exceptions. So the exception is when the assignment doesn't allow it. So the correct answer is the one that is allowed.

So let me re-examine each option whether it's an exception or not.

Option C says the assignment continues the obligor's duty or risk. If that's allowed, then C is not an exception. Wait, no. The exception is when the assignment does not continue. So if the obligor is assigned but doesn't continue, that's an exception. So C is when the obligor continues, which is allowed, so it is an exception.

Therefore, the correct answer is the option that is allowed, i.e., not an exception.

Hmm, but the question is asking which is not an exception. So that would be the option that is allowed. So which options are allowed?

Looking again:

A: Yes, allowed.

B: Yes, allowed.

C: Allowed.

D: Yes, allowed.

E: Yes, allowed.

F: Yes, allowed.

G: Allowed.

H: Yes, allowed.

I: Not allowed.

Wait, so option I is an assignment not allowed by law. If that's the case, then it's the correct answer because it's not an exception. So the answer is I.
</think>

The question asks which of the options is NOT an exception to contractual rights assignment. Exceptions include situations where the assignment is allowed, such as changing the obligor's duty, altering the contract's nature, continuing the obligor's obligations, transferring rights to an incapable party, creating undue hardship, reducing contract value, and transferring rights from future contracts. The assignment not allowed by law is when consent is not given, making it the correct answer.

**Answer: I**
