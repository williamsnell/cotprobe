Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about polynomial rings and some statements. Hmm, let me think. The question has two statements, 1 and 2, and I need to determine if each is true or false. Then, match the correct answer from options A to J.

Statement 1: If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then the degree of f(x) + g(x) is equal to the maximum of the degrees of f(x) and g(x). Wait, I remember that the degree of a polynomial is the highest power of x with a non-zero coefficient. But when you add two polynomials, the degree of the sum might be less than the maximum degree if the leading coefficients cancel each other.

For example, take f(x) = x^2 + 1 and g(x) = -x^2 + 2. Then f + g = (x^2 - x^2) + (1 + 2) = 0 + 3 = 3. So the sum is a constant polynomial, which has degree 0. But the maximum of deg f and deg g was 2. So statement 1 is false because the degree of the sum can be less than the maximum degree. It only holds if the leading coefficients don't cancel.

Statement 2: If F is a field, then every ideal of F[x] is principal. I remember that in ring theory, a principal ideal is an ideal that can be generated by a single element. For polynomial rings over fields, like F[x], I think every ideal is indeed principal. F[x] is a principal ideal domain (PID), which means every ideal is generated by a single polynomial. So statement 2 is true.

Now, looking at the options. The options are about whether each statement is true (T), false (F), not determinable (ND), or not applicable (NA). The correct answer would be two Ts, because statement 2 is definitely true, and statement 1 is false.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is True, True. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: False, Not Determined
B: Not Determined, Not Determined
C: Not Determined, True
D: True, Not Determined
E: True, True
F: True, False
G: False, True
H: Not Determined, False
I: True, Not Applicable
J: False, False

So E is the one with True and True. That fits: statement 1 is false, statement 2 is true. So the correct answer should be E.

The analysis shows that statement 1 is false because the degree of the sum can be less than the maximum degree, and statement 2 is true as F[x] is a PID. Therefore, the correct option is E: True, True.

**Answer: E**
