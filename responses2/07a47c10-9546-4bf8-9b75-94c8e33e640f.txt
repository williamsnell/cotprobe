Question:

A seller listed real property for $500,000, which was set to expire on Aug.1. The current lessee of the premises, who had made substantial improvements to the property, wanted to buy at the full list price but needed extra time. He paid $10,000 for an option to be added to the lease, giving him an option to buy on or before Sept. 1. The option stated that all notices required under it "shall be deemed given if given in writing and delivered personally, delivered by commercial delivery service, or by certified mail return receipt requested, to the party to receive the Notice" That notice was required by Sept. 1. Buyer called Seller on Aug. 25 and told her that he was exercising the option, but Seller did not remember the words used. The Buyer sent written intent to exercise it by first class mail on Aug. 29 but the Seller later testified that she did not receive it until September 3. On September 10 she notified Buyer that the option expired and the deal was off. Buyer filed a specific performance action to compel the transaction. Is it likely that the Equity Court will grant the request for specific performance?

Options:

A: No, because the option explicitly required that notices be delivered by one of the stated forms, and first class mail was not one of them.
B: Yes, the delay was minimal, the lessee would suffer hardship, and the wording of the notice requirement did not absolutely require one of the stated forms of notice.
C: Yes, because the Buyer made a good faith effort to notify the Seller within the required time.
D: No, because option contracts are strictly enforced and even a one-day delay cannot be allowed due to the need to have commercial predictability in such transactions.
E: Yes, because the Seller was informed of the Buyer's intent to exercise the option, regardless of the method of delivery.
F: No, because the Buyer did not fulfill the terms of the option within the allotted time.
G: No, because the Seller did not recall the phone conversation, and there's no proof of the same.
H: No, because the Seller would be prejudiced by having to sell after the option date.
I: Yes, the Seller was informed by phone call, which can be considered as personal delivery.

Okay, so I'm looking at this real property question here. It's about whether an equity court would grant a specific performance action after a seller and buyer have a notice requirement issue. Let's break it down.

First, the seller listed real property for $500k expiring on Aug 1. The lessee had made improvements and wanted to buy at the full price but needed extra time. He paid $10k for an option. The option gives the buyer to be added, so the lessee can buy by Sept 1. The option's wording required notices to be delivered under certain conditions. The buyer called on Aug 25 and said he was exercising the option, but the seller didn't remember the words. The buyer sent first-class mail on Aug 29 but the seller only delivered on Sept 3. Then, on Sept 10, the seller notified the buyer that the option expired, leading to a default.

The question is whether the equity court would grant a specific performance action (asking for a new transaction). The options are A to I, each with a different reason.

Let me think about the legal aspects here. The key points are:

1. The option requires certain kinds of notices, specifically that they must be delivered by one of the specified forms. The option's wording says that "notices required under it shall be deemed given if given in writing and delivered personally, delivered by commercial delivery service, or by certified mail return receipt requested to the party to receive the Notice."

2. The buyer called on Aug 25 and said he was exercising the option, but the seller didn't remember the message. The buyer sent first-class mail on Aug 29. The seller delivered it on Sept 3, which is a day later.

3. The seller later testified that she didn't receive it until September 3.

4. On Sept 10, the seller notified the buyer that the option expired and the deal was off.

The buyer's intention was to exercise the option, but the seller didn't remember, and the seller's notice wasn't delivered on time.

So, the main question is whether the seller can be reasonably assured that the buyer intended to exercise the option, or if the notice requirement will cause the seller to be prejudiced.

Let me look at the options.

Option A: "No, because the option explicitly required that notices be delivered by one of the stated forms, and first class mail was not one of them."

Wait, the option says that the notice requirement is "shall be deemed given if given in writing and delivered personally, delivered by commercial delivery service, or by certified mail return receipt requested to the party to receive the Notice." So, the delivery method is important. The buyer tried to send first class, which isn't one of the required forms. But the delivery was only received on time, Sept 3. So the seller delivered the notice on time, but the buyer sent it as first class. So, the delivery was on time, but the method was not one of the required forms.

In the option, the seller was required to deliver the notice in one of those specific ways. So, if the buyer sent the notice in first-class mail, which wasn't specified, the seller couldn't be sure that the buyer intended to exercise the option because the notice wasn't in the required form. So, the seller might be in breach because she didn't deliver in a way that the buyer intended.

Wait, but the option says that if the notice was delivered in any of those forms, the buyer's intent is satisfied. So, the seller's failure to deliver in a way that the buyer intended would cause her to be in breach. If the buyer intended to exercise the option, but the notice wasn't delivered in the required form, then maybe the seller has breached.

But in this case, the buyer called on Aug 25 and said he was exercising the option. The seller didn't remember, and the buyer tried to send the notice on Aug 29 using first class. The seller delivered it on Sept 3. So, the seller delivered it on time, but via first-class, which wasn't one of the required forms. 

So, the issue is whether the seller can be assured that the buyer intended to exercise the option. If the buyer intended to exercise, then he must have intended to deliver the notice in a way that satisfies the condition. But the buyer sent it via first-class, which doesn't fall under the required forms.

So, the seller might be in breach because the notice wasn't delivered in the required form, but the buyer did exercise the option. Alternatively, the seller might not be able to be sure that the buyer intended to do so, because the seller could have delivered it in a way that was required.

Wait, but the buyer called on Aug 25 and said he was exercising the option. So the buyer's intention was to exercise the option. The seller didn't remember the message, which is concerning. But maybe the buyer's intent was to exercise, and the seller didn't notice the required form. So the seller might not have had any reason not to deliver in a way that would satisfy the condition.

Alternatively, the seller could have delivered the notice in a way that's not required, which might cause the buyer to be in breach.

Wait, the option's wording is that if the buyer delivers the notice in writing and by one of the delivery methods, it's deemed given. So, the buyer's intent is to exercise the option, and he must have intended to send the notice in a way that meets the condition. But the buyer sent it via first class, which is not one of the required forms. So if the buyer intended to exercise the option, he must have intended to send the notice in a way that is allowed by the condition. But if he sent it via first class, which isn't required, then the seller might not have been notified of the intent to exercise the option.

But the seller didn't remember, so perhaps she can't assume that she didn't have the intention to exercise. Alternatively, the seller might have delivered the notice in a way that she wasn't aware of, which could be a breach.

Wait, but the buyer called on day 25. The seller only delivered the notice on day 3. So, the seller could not have known about the buyer's intention until the buyer called. So, perhaps the seller didn't have the opportunity to know about the buyer's intention because the buyer only called on day 25. But the buyer called on day 25 and said he was exercising the option. So, he didn't call until then. So, the seller didn't know that the buyer intended to exercise the option. So, the seller's lack of knowledge is a problem.

But in the option, the buyer called on day 25 and said he was exercising. The seller knows nothing of that. So, the seller's failure to know about the buyer's intent could be a problem because the seller may have to assume that the buyer intended to exercise the option. But since the seller didn't know, she might be in breach.

Wait, but in the options, option A says that because the option required certain delivery forms, and the buyer used first-class, the seller didn't have to deliver in one of those forms. So, perhaps the seller's notice wasn't delivered in the required form, but the buyer still exercised the option. So, the seller might have breached the contract.

Alternatively, the buyer intended to exercise the option, so the seller must have delivered the notice in a way that satisfies the condition. If the buyer sent it in a way that doesn't satisfy, the seller violates the contract because she didn't deliver in the required form.

So, the seller may have breached the contract because she didn't deliver in the required form, even though the buyer intended to exercise the option. Or, she might have been in breach because the notice wasn't delivered in the required form, regardless of the buyer's intention.

Wait, the seller's notice was delivered on Sept 3, but that was after the buyer called on day 25. So, if the buyer intended to exercise the option, he must have intended to send the notice in a way that is allowed by the condition. But he sent it via first-class, which is not allowed. So the seller may have been in breach.

But the buyer called on day 25 and said he was exercising, so perhaps the buyer intended to exercise, but didn't know about the delivery method. So, the seller, not knowing about the buyer's intent, might have delivered the notice in a way that wasn't required, which could be a breach.

Alternatively, the seller might have been in breach because she didn't deliver in the required form, regardless of the buyer's intention.

Wait, the option's wording says that the delivery must be in writing and delivered personally, etc. So, if the buyer sent the notice via first-class, which is not allowed, then the seller is in breach because she delivered it in a way that doesn't satisfy the condition.

But the buyer didn't call and tell the seller that he intended to exercise the option. He just called on day 25 and said he was exercising. So, the seller didn't know about the buyer's intention. Therefore, she may have been in breach because she didn't know that the buyer intended to exercise the option, and she delivered the notice in a way that doesn't satisfy the condition.

But perhaps the seller could have delivered the notice in a way that is considered as delivering in the required form. Wait, no. The condition requires that the notice be delivered in one of the required forms, but the buyer sent it via first-class, which is not allowed. So, the seller's delivery wasn't in the required form, leading to a breach.

Alternatively, the seller might have been in breach because she didn't deliver in the required form, regardless of the buyer's intent.

So, Option A says that the seller's failure to deliver in the required form would cause her to be in breach because the buyer intended to exercise the option, but the seller didn't know.

Wait, the buyer called on day 25 and said he was exercising. The seller didn't know about it. So, she may have assumed that he intended to exercise, but if he didn't know, she might have delivered the notice in a way that's not required, which could be a breach.

So, the seller may have breached the contract, so the equity court would likely grant the specific performance action, meaning the answer is A.

Looking at the options, option A is the reason given. So, A would be the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether a seller can be reasonably assured that a buyer intended to exercise an option contract, given a notice requirement. The seller failed to deliver the notice in a required form, and the buyer called on day 25 to exercise the option. The seller delivered the notice on day 3, which is more than a day later. The key legal issue is whether the seller's failure to deliver in a required form constitutes a breach of contract.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Option Contract Requirements**: The option's notice requirement specifies that the notice must be delivered in writing and in one of the specified forms (writing and delivery personally, by commercial delivery service, or certified mail return receipt). The buyer attempted to send the notice via first-class mail, which is not one of the required forms.

2. **Buyer's Call**: The buyer called on day 25 to exercise the option, despite not remembering the message. The seller did not know about the buyer's intent, leading to a potential breach of contract.

3. **Legal Breach**: Since the buyer intended to exercise the option, the seller must have delivered the notice in a way that satisfies the condition. The buyer sent the notice in first-class mail, which is not allowed, leading to a breach.

4. ** seller's Delivered Notice**: The seller delivered the notice on day 3, which was after the buyer's call. However, the buyer intended to exercise the option, and the seller's failure to deliver in the required form constitutes a breach.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Correct. The seller's failure to deliver in one of the required forms, despite the buyer's intent, would constitute a breach. The buyer's call on day 25 and his intent to exercise the option indicate that the seller may be in breach.
