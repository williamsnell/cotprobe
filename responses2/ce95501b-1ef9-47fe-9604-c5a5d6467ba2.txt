Okay, so I have this question where I need to order the numbers 6, −1, 8, −3, −4 from least to greatest. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when ordering numbers from least to greatest, you start with the smallest and go up to the largest. So, I need to figure out which of these numbers is the smallest and then the next smallest, and so on.

The numbers given are 6, -1, 8, -3, and -4. Let me list them out: 6, -1, 8, -3, -4. Wait, I should probably write them in order, but I'm a bit confused about the negatives. Negative numbers are smaller than positive ones, right? So the negative numbers are less than the positive ones.

Looking at the negatives: -4, -3, and -1. Which is the smallest? Well, -4 is the most negative, so it's the smallest. Then comes -3, and the largest negative is -1. So the order of the negatives is -4, -3, -1.

Now the positive numbers are 6 and 8. Since 6 is less than 8, the positives come after the negatives. So putting it all together, the order should start with the negatives in increasing order, then the positives. So it would be -4, -3, -1, then 6, and then 8.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Let's check each option.

Option A: -4, 8, -1, -3, 6. That starts with the smallest, but then 8 comes before -1, which is wrong because 8 is positive and should be after the negatives. So this option is out.

Option B: -4, -3, -1, 6, 8. That fits what I thought. Starts with the negatives, then the positives in order.

Option C: 6, -1, 8, -3, -4. That's all positives first, which is the opposite of what we need. So no.

Option D: -4, -1, -3, 6, 8. Wait, but after -4, why is -1 before -3? Because -1 is actually larger than -3. Oh right, wait, no. Because when you have negatives, the number with the higher value is actually smaller. So -3 is smaller than -1. So D's sequence after -4 is -1, which is incorrect. So D is wrong.

Option E: -1, 6, -3, -4, 8. Hmm, here the starting number is -1, which is positive, so wrong. Also, after -1 comes 6, which is positive, but negatives should come first. So incorrect.

Option F: -3, -4, -1, 8, 6. Starts with -3 and -4, which are correct negatives, but then -1 is next. But wait, after -4 comes -3, which is correct because -3 is bigger than -4. Then comes -1. But after that, it goes to 8 and 6. Wait, why is 8 after 6? Because 8 is bigger than 6, so in increasing order, 6 should come before 8. So F has 8 before 6, which is incorrect. So F is wrong.

Option G: -1, -3, -4, 6, 8. Let me break this down. Starting from the first number: -1 is correct. Then -3, which is smaller than -1. Then -4, which is even smaller. Then 6 and 8. But wait, after -4, the next is -3, which is correct. But then 6 and 8 are after. Wait, no, the order here is -1, -3, -4 (but that's not in increasing order). Wait, no, because -4 is smaller than -3, which is smaller than -1. So the negatives should be ordered from -4, -3, -1. So the correct order for the negatives is -4, -3, -1. But in option G, the first three are -1, -3, -4. So that's wrong. So G is incorrect.

Option H: -3, -4, 6, -1, 8. Let's see. -3 is correct, but -4 comes before -3, which is correct. Then 6 is next, which is wrong because 6 is positive. So after negatives, positives come. So H starts with the negatives in order, but then 6 and 8 are after. So 6 and 8 are correct after the positives, but wait, the options are ordered all together. So H lists the numbers as: -3, -4, 6, -1, 8. So let's break it down: -3 is correct, -4 is correct, then 6 is positive, which is wrong because it's after the negatives. So option H is incorrect.

Option I: 6, 8, -1, -3, -4. All positives first, then negatives, which is the opposite of correct order. So I is wrong.

Option J: 8, 6, -1, -3, -4. Positives first, then negatives. Which is opposite of what we need.

So looking back, the only option that starts with the smallest (which is -4) and then goes up is option B. So the correct order is -4, -3, -1, 6, 8.

The correct order from least to greatest is -4, -3, -1, 6, 8. Comparing all options, only option B matches this sequence.

Answer: B
