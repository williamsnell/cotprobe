Question:

A vacationer, on a winter ski holiday, visited a ski lift in a private park. The ski lift company had installed and operated the lift pursuant to a concession agreement with the owner of the private park. Visitors gained entry to the park on payment of a $5 fee, which entitled them to go ice skating, tobogganing, or sledding. A ski lift ticket cost an additional $7 per day. At the top of the ski lift, there was a platform for embarking and disembarking passengers. The ski lift company paid the owner a stipulated rental plus 15 percent of the net proceeds from the lift. Two employees of the company operated the lift, one from a station at the bottom and the other from a station at the top of the hill. When the vacationer boarded the ski lift, it was late afternoon and most of the skiers had left. He was the sole passenger on the lift. Meanwhile, the employee at the top had left his post to go to the bathroom, asking his friend to keep watch on the lift and to stop it to allow any passengers to disembark. The friend consented, and the employee showed him how to use the control switch. When the vacationer approached the top, the employee was still away. Instead of stopping the lift to permit the vacationer to get off, the friend allowed the lift to keep moving. The vacationer was carried past the platform, and he was swung violently from side to side as the ski lift started downward. When the employee returned and sized up the situation, he threw the switch, stopping the lift. The vacationer, severely bruised and badly frightened, jumped off the ski lift and completed his descent by foot. In a personal injury action by the vacationer against the owner of the private park, the vacationer will rely on the concept of

Options:

A: vicarious liability.
B: negligence per se.
C: imputed negligence.
D: comparative negligence.
E: assumption of risk.
F: joint venture.
G: strict liability.
H: premises liability.
I: respondeat superior.
J: contributory negligence.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read it carefully.

The vacationer went skiing on a winter day in a private park. They paid a $5 entry fee and had access to ice, tobogganing, or sledding. They took the ski lift, which costs $7 a day. The lift company operated it under a concession agreement with the owner. When they boarded, the employee at the top left his post to go to the bathroom and asked his friend to stop the lift. The friend agreed, showed the employee how to use the control switch, but instead of stopping, the friend allowed the lift to go on, causing the vacationer to get hurt.

The question is about who the vacationer can sue for in a personal injury action against the owner. The options are various liability concepts.

First, I need to recall the key principles related to personal injury lawsuits in this context. The main concepts I remember are vicarious liability, negligence per se, imputed negligence, and others like joint venture, premises liability, etc.

The vacationer is the plaintiff. The owner is suing for injuries from the ski lift.

The lift company cost the owner rental plus 15% of net proceeds. That's probably a sunk cost, or maybe the owner isn't liable for the company's expenses because they're a business, not a personal service. But wait, in some cases, if the business is a business operated for personal service, the owner might be liable. But in other cases, business expenses are considered business surpluses and thus not necessarily a liability for the owner.

But the main issue here is whether the lift company is liable for the accident. The friend, who was the employee at the top, then allowed the lift to continue. If the friend was negligent, the owner might be liable. But wait, the friend's action was his own, right? Because the friend was the one who agreed to stop the lift but then allowed it to continue. So the friend's negligence might not be the issue. The issue is whether the lift company is liable.

Wait, but the friend might be considered a third-party defendant. Because the friend was not the owner or the resort owner but a third party who agreed to stop the lift. So the question is whether the resort is liable because of the friend's voluntary agreement.

But the friend was at the top and allowed the lift to continue. So if the friend was negligent in allowing the lift to continue—he didn't stop it—then the resort might have been negligent. But wait, the resort's liability comes from whether the lift was operating in a manner that was negligent.

Alternatively, the resort might have been negligent because they allowed the lift to continue even though the friend agreed to stop it, thereby creating a situation where the lift was operating under circumstances that could have been stopped by the resort's negligence.

Wait, but the friend was allowed to continue, so the resort didn't stop it. So the resort could be liable for not having a proper stopping mechanism.

But the resort's liability would depend on whether the lift was operating in a way that was negligent. So if the resort had reasonable measures to prevent this, but didn't, then they might be liable.

But the friend was the one who agreed to stop it. So perhaps the friend was acting in his own interest by allowing it to go on. So the resort's liability would be based on whether they had a reasonable measure to stop it. If the resort didn't stop it, then they might be liable.

Wait, but the resort's liability might be based on whether they were negligent in allowing the lift to continue without stopping. So if the resort didn't stop it, the resort's liability would be based on whether they had a reasonable stopping procedure, perhaps stopping it when the friend was there.

Alternatively, the resort might be liable under negligence per se if the operation of the lift was a matter of public concern, and the resort had no reasonable means to prevent the lift from continuing.

Wait, but the resort is a private park, so their own liability is perhaps limited. But the ski resort's liability as an owner is separate from the private park's liability.

Alternatively, the resort's liability might be under premises liability, where the resort is the owner of the premises, and the lift is operating under their supervision. If the lift operator was negligent in stopping the lift, the resort is liable.

But in this case, the resort didn't stop it. So perhaps they are liable for the friend's action, but that's a third-party measure. But in terms of personal injury liability, the resort might be liable if the lift's operation was negligent.

Wait, but the friend was the one who agreed to stop it. So the friend's action was voluntary. If the resort had reasonable means to prevent the lift from continuing, then they're liable. But if they didn't, then the resort isn't liable.

But the problem states that the owner paid the resort a stipulated rental plus 15% of net proceeds. The resort's expenses are probably considered a business expense, not a personal service. So the resort might not be liable for the business expenses. Unless the business expenses are considered a liability because they are part of their general business operations.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, the resort is the business and the owner is a separate entity. The resort's liability would be based on whether they're operating a business that is a matter of public concern. The resort might have been negligent in their business practices, such as not having a proper stopping procedure.

Wait, but the friend was the one who agreed to stop the lift. So perhaps the friend's action was his own choice, not the resort's. So the resort might not be liable if the friend acted in his own interest. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the resort could be liable for allowing the lift to continue without stopping because it's their business to ensure the lift is used safely. So perhaps they're liable under premises liability, as the lift is operating under their supervision and the friend's action was his own decision.

Wait, but in this case, the friend was the one who agreed to stop it. So perhaps the friend was acting in his own interest, but the resort's negligence might have led to the lift continuing. But if the resort didn't stop it, they're liable.

Wait, but the resort's liability for the friend's action would be separate from their liability for the lift's operation.

Alternatively, the resort's liability would be based on whether they had reasonable means to prevent the lift from continuing. If they did, then they're liable for negligence.

But the friend was the one who allowed it to go on, so the resort didn't stop it. Therefore, if the resort didn't stop the lift, they are liable for the friend's action. But that's a third-party liability.

Wait, but the friend was the one who agreed to stop it. So perhaps the friend was acting in his own interest by allowing it to go on. So the resort's liability would be based on whether they had a reasonable stopping procedure.

Wait, but the resort didn't stop it. So if they didn't have a reasonable method, the resort is liable.

Alternatively, the resort's liability might be under the concept of negligence per se, if the operation of the lift falls under a matter of public concern, and thus the resort wouldn't have reasonable means to prevent the lift from continuing.

Now, looking back at the question, the vacationer is suing the owner of the private park. So the owner is suing for injuries caused by the ski lift. The question is asking which liability concept is applicable.

The options are A: vicarious liability, B: negligence per se, C: imputed negligence, D: comparative negligence, E: assumption of risk, etc.

Vicarious liability is when the plaintiff is liable through a third party's act. But in this case, the resort is the owner, which is a separate entity, so vicarious liability isn't applicable because the resort isn't a third party—wait, no, the resort could be considered a third party if they're the owner of the lift. Or perhaps the resort is not a third party because the vacationer is the plaintiff. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Negligence per se (B) is when the plaintiff can be held liable if the plaintiff's actions were negligent in a matter of public concern. So if the lift's operation was a matter of public concern, and the resort had no reasonable means to prevent it, then the resort is liable.

But the resort's expenses are business expenses, not personal service. So perhaps they aren't liable for that. Unless the business expenses are considered a liability. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the resort isn't liable for the business expenses, then the resort is only liable for the personal injury from the lift's operation.

Wait, but the friend was the one who allowed the lift to continue, which could be considered a matter of public concern. So if the resort had no reasonable means to stop it, they're liable.

But the friend's action is his own. So perhaps the resort is liable for the friend's action, but that's a third-party liability, not negligence per se.

Wait, but the question is what the vacationer's owner can claim. The owner is suing the private park, which is an owner. So the owner is the plaintiff. The resort is the private park.

I think the key here is that the resort is the owner of the lift, which is a business for the owner. If the lift operator was negligent in stopping the lift, then the owner is liable.

But the friend was the one who agreed to stop it. So the friend was acting in his own interest. So perhaps the resort isn't liable because the friend was the one who agreed to stop it, and the resort didn't have a reasonable stopping procedure.

So the resort might not be liable for the friend's action, but the resort might be liable for the lift's operation if it was a matter of public concern and they didn't stop it.

Wait, but the friend was the one who agreed to stop it, so perhaps the friend's action was voluntary and not the resort's negligence.

Wait, but the friend was the one who was the operator at the top. So perhaps the friend was negligent in allowing the lift to continue. But the friend was not the owner; he was the employee at the top. So the friend's action might be considered a third-party negligence.

But then, the resort is suing for injuries due to the lift's operation, which the friend's negligence might not be a part of. So I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, the resort might be liable under negligence per se if the operation of the lift was a matter of public concern and the resort had no reasonable means to prevent it.

Wait, but the friend was the one who agreed to stop it. So perhaps the resort is liable under negligence per se because the lift's operation was a matter of public concern and they had no reasonable way to stop it. Because the lift operator's negligence (like not stopping it) would be the resort's liability.

Wait, but the friend was the one who agreed to stop it. So the resort didn't stop it, so if the resort didn't stop it, they're liable for the friend's action. But that's not negligence per se; it's a third-party measure.

Alternatively, the resort's liability would be based on whether the lift operator's actions were negligent. So if the lift operator was negligent in stopping the lift, the resort is liable.

But the friend was allowed to continue, meaning the resort didn't stop it. So if the resort didn't stop the lift, they're liable for the friend's action, but that's not negligence per se—it's a third-party measure.

Wait, but the friend is the one who agreed to stop it. So perhaps the friend's action is the resort's own negligence. But the resort isn't liable for the friend's negligence because they're the owner.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

What is the owner's liability in this case? The owner is the private park's owner. The lift is operating under the owner's supervision. If the lift operator was negligent, the owner is liable for the injuries. If the lift operator was negligent, the resort is the business owner, so the resort would be liable.

But the resort's expenses are likely a business expense, not a personal service. So the resort may not be liable for the business expenses. However, if the lift operator was negligent in stopping the lift, the resort is liable for the operation.

But in this case, the friend allowed the lift to continue, so the resort didn't stop it. So if the resort didn't stop it, then they are liable for the friend's action, but that's not negligence per se. But if the friend's action was his own choice, then perhaps the resort isn't liable under negligence per se because the friend wasn't acting in the resort's interest.

Wait, but the resort's liability would be based on whether they had reasonable means to prevent the lift from continuing. If they did, then they're liable for negligence; if not, then not.

So the resort's main issue is whether they had reasonable stopping procedures. They didn't stop it, so they're liable for the friend's action but not for the lift's operation because that's a separate matter.

Wait, but the friend was the one who agreed to stop the lift, so the resort's liability would include allowing the lift to continue, but that's a third-party measure, not negligence per se.

So, the resort's liability is whether they had reasonable stopping procedures. If they didn't, then they're liable for the friend's action, but not for the lift's operation.

Alternatively, if the lift operator's negligence caused the accident, then the resort is liable under negligence per se. So the resort's liability would be negligence per se because the lift operator was negligent in stopping the lift.

Wait, but the friend was the one who allowed the lift to continue. So perhaps the friend's action is the resort's negligence because the resort didn't stop it. But that's a third-party measure, not negligence per se.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about each option.

Option B: Negligence per se. This occurs when the plaintiff's actions are negligent in a matter of public concern. So, if the lift's operation was a matter of public concern, and the resort had no reasonable means to prevent the lift from continuing, then they're liable.

But if the resort's business expenses were business surpluses and not a liability, then perhaps they aren't liable for the operation. But the friend's action is his own, so perhaps the resort isn't liable under negligence per se because the friend was acting within his own interest, not the resort's.

Wait, but the friend was the one who agreed to stop it, which might be his own choice. So perhaps the resort isn't liable for that. But the resort's business expenses are probably not a liability because the owner is a separate entity.

So, if the resort's business expenses are not a liability, then the resort is only liable for personal injury from the lift's operation. But the friend was allowed to continue, so perhaps the resort isn't liable for that.

Alternatively, if the resort had a history of handling the lift, it might have been a matter of public concern and thus liable for not stopping the lift.

But I'm not entirely sure. So, perhaps the resort isn't liable for the friend's action under negligence per se, because the friend wasn't acting in their own interest but in the resort's own interest.

Wait, but the friend was the one who agreed to stop the lift. So if the resort had a reasonable stopping procedure, they're liable for the friend's action. But if they didn't, they're not.

But I'm trying to decide between B and another option.

Another option is negligence per se, which is when the plaintiff is liable because their actions were negligent in a matter of public concern. So if the lift's operation was a matter of public concern, and the resort had no reasonable means to prevent it, then the resort is liable.

But in this case, the friend was the one who agreed to stop it. So perhaps the resort is not liable under negligence per se because the friend wasn't acting in their own interest but in the resort's.

Wait, but the friend could be considered a third-party defendant. So the resort might be liable for the friend's action, but that's not negligence per se.

Alternatively, the resort might be liable for the friend's action because it's a matter of public concern, but that's not negligence per se. Negligence per se is when the plaintiff's actions are negligent in that matter.

Alternatively, if the resort's own liability is for the friend's action, but I don't think that's negligence per se.

Wait, perhaps the resort's liability is negligence per se because the resort had no reasonable stopping procedure. Or perhaps the resort is liable for the friend's action because it's a matter of public concern.

Wait, but the friend's action was his own choice. So perhaps the resort isn't liable for that. But the resort's liability is about the lift's operation, not the friend's action.

So, the resort's liability is whether they had reasonable means to prevent the lift from continuing. If they did, then they are liable for negligence; if not, then not.

In this case, the friend was the one who agreed to stop the lift. So perhaps the resort didn't stop it, so they're liable for the friend's action. But that's not negligence per se—it's a third-party measure.

Alternatively, the resort's liability is that they're the owner of the lift, so the resort is liable for the friend's action, but that's not negligence per se.

Wait, another angle: the resort is the owner and the private park's owner. So the resort's liability includes the friend's action, but that's a third-party measure, not negligence per se.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: Imputed negligence. This is when the plaintiff is responsible for the injury based on the duty owed to the injured party, which would be negligence per se.

Wait, I think I mixed up. Imputed negligence is when the plaintiff is responsible for their own injuries based on their own negligence, not the plaintiff's negligence. So for example, if the plaintiff was negligent in another situation, they're now liable for their injuries because of that negligence.

But in this case, the plaintiff is suing for injuries because of the lift's operation. The lift's operation was a matter of public concern, so perhaps the resort is liable under negligence per se, meaning the resort is responsible for the injury because of their negligence.

Wait, but the friend was the one who agreed to stop it. So perhaps the resort isn't liable for that. But the resort's business expenses are likely not a liability.

Wait, but the owner ( resort ) might be liable for the friend's action because it's a matter of public concern. So the resort is responsible for the friend's action, which would mean the resort is liable under negligence per se, because they were negligent in stopping the lift.

Wait, but the friend was allowed to continue, so if the resort had a reasonable way to stop the lift, they're liable for the friend's action. But that's a third-party measure. So if the friend agreed to stop but allowed the lift to continue, perhaps the resort is liable because they didn't stop, but that's negligence per se.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the definition of negligence per se. Negligence per se occurs when the plaintiff's actions are negligent in a matter of public concern. So, the plaintiff's actions are negligent in that matter, which makes them liable.

So if the lift operator was negligent in stopping the lift, making the lift a matter of public concern, then the resort is liable under negligence per se.

But in this case, the friend was the one who agreed to stop the lift. So the resort didn't stop it, so they aren't liable for their own negligence in stopping the lift.

Wait, but the friend was acting in his own interest, so perhaps the resort isn't liable for the friend's action. But the resort's liability is elsewhere.

Hmm, perhaps the resort is liable because the friend was acting within the resort's interest, not their own.

But this is getting too complex. Let me think about the possible answer options.

The options are A: vicarious liability, B: negligence per se, C: imputed negligence, D: comparative negligence, E: assumption of risk, F: joint and several liability, etc.

In this case, the vacationer is suing the owner of the private park. The private park owner is the resort.

The resort is the business owner, so the resort's liability would be determined by whether they were negligent in operating the lift.

But the friend at the top agreed to stop it, so the resort didn't stop it. Therefore, the resort isn't liable for the friend's action.

But the resort's business expenses are likely not a liability, so the resort is only liable for personal injury.

But in terms of negligence, if the resort had no reasonable stopping procedures, they're liable for the friend's action because that's a third-party measure.

Wait, but the friend was acting in his own interest. So perhaps the resort isn't liable for the friend's action, but the resort's business expenses are not a liability.

So, the resort's liability is whether they had reasonable stopping procedures. If they didn't, then they're liable for the friend's action, but that's not negligence per se.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the answer options again.

The question is about the concept the vacationer can rely upon when suing the owner.

If the resort's liability is negligence per se, then the vacationer can claim negligence per se.

But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, if the resort is liable for the friend's action because it's a matter of public concern and the resort had no reasonable stopping procedure, then the resort is liable under negligence per se.

So, the vacationer can claim negligence per se if the resort is liable for the friend's action because it's a matter of public concern and the resort had no reasonable stopping procedure.

Wait, but the friend was the one who agreed to stop the lift, so perhaps the resort wasn't acting in their own interest. So, perhaps the resort is not liable for the friend's action, but the resort's business expenses are not a liability. So, the resort is only liable for personal injury.

But if the resort's business expenses are not a liability, then the resort isn't liable for the lift's operation. Therefore, the resort's liability is whether they had reasonable stopping procedures.

In that case, the resort's liability is whether they had reasonable stopping procedures, which would relate to negligence per se if the resort was negligent in stopping the lift.

But the friend was the one who agreed to stop it. So perhaps the resort wasn't negligent in stopping it, so the resort isn't liable for the friend's action, but the resort's business expenses are not a liability.

Wait, but the friend was the one who agreed to stop it, so perhaps the friend was acting in their own interest, and the resort wasn't responsible for that. So the resort isn't liable for the friend's action, but the resort's liability is for the lift's operation.

But the lift's operation was a matter of public concern, so perhaps the resort is liable under negligence per se if they had no reasonable stopping procedures.

Alternatively, the resort's liability is whether they had reasonable stopping procedures, which would mean they are liable under negligence per se, but that's not the case.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should pick B, negligence per se, because the resort's liability is whether they had reasonable stopping procedures, which is a matter of public concern, making them liable under negligence per se.

Wait, but the friend was the one who agreed to stop it. So perhaps the resort wasn't negligent in stopping it, so the resort isn't liable for the friend's action, but the resort's business expenses are not a liability.

So, the resort isn't liable for the lift's operation, but is liable for personal injury because of the friend's action.

But that's a third-party measure, not negligence per se.

Wait, perhaps the resort's liability is negligence per se because the friend agreed to stop it, but that's not the resort's liability, just the friend's liability.

So, perhaps the resort isn't liable for the friend's action, but the resort's liability is for the lift's operation, which they didn't stop, so they are liable for the friend's action, but not for the lift's operation.

Wait, but if the friend's action is his own, and the resort isn't liable for that, then the resort isn't liable for the friend's action, but the resort's business expenses aren't a liability either.

So, the resort isn't liable for the lift's operation because they didn't stop it, but they're liable for personal injury due to the friend's action.

But that's a third-party measure, not negligence per se.

So, perhaps the resort isn't liable under negligence per se in this case because the friend was the one who agreed to stop it, and the resort didn't stop it.

But I'm not sure. I think the answer is B: negligence per se.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. I think the correct answer is B: negligence per se.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think the friend was acting in his own interest, so the resort isn't liable under negligence per se. But the resort's business expenses are not a liability, so the resort isn't liable for the lift's operation because they didn't stop it.

But then, why is the vacationer suing the owner? The owner is the resort.

Wait, perhaps the owner is liable under negligence per se because the lift operator was negligent in stopping the lift, making the lift a matter of public concern, and the resort had no reasonable stopping procedure.

So, in this case, the resort is the business owner, and the lift operator's negligence is the resort's liability.

So, the vacationer can claim negligence per se because the lift operator was negligent in stopping the lift, making the lift a matter of public concern, and the resort had no reasonable stopping procedure.

Wait, but the friend was the one who agreed to stop it. So perhaps the resort isn't liable for that.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is B: negligence per se.

Wait, no, because the lift operator was negligent in stopping the lift, making the lift a matter of public concern, and the resort had no reasonable stopping procedure.

So, the resort is liable under negligence per se because the lift operator was negligent in stopping the lift, making it a matter of public concern, and the resort had no reasonable stopping procedure.

Therefore, the vacationer can claim negligence per se.

So, the answer is B.
</think>

The vacationer can claim negligence per se because the resort (the owner of the lift) was negligent in stopping the lift, making the lift a matter of public concern. The resort had no reasonable stopping procedure, which makes them liable under negligence per se.

ANSWER: B
