Alright, so I have this question about Widom and Roth's cognitive model of the sexual response. Hmm, I remember they're a theory in psychology about how we perceive sexual signals. Let me try to think this through.

The question says that an adult feels arousal when looking at a child, but then realizes it's inappropriate. He feels anxiety instead. The options are various types of responses, like cognitive arousal, negative perception, etc.

Wait, I think in Widom and Roth's model, there are different levels of cognitive processing. The first level is the unprocessed, basic response, which is just looking at the child without considering it's inappropriate. Then, they talk about the second level, which is the part that makes the decision. So, if the response is inappropriate, the response is considered more negative. 

The model distinguishes between positive and negative responses. Positive responses are those that are appropriate and aligned with our values, while negative ones are inappropriate. So, when the adult is confused, he perceives the child's response as negative, which leads to anxiety. That makes me think this is an example of a negative perception.

Wait, but let me make sure. So, the question says the response is inappropriate, so the adult perceives it as negative. That's a negative perception. So the answer should be option B: negative perception.

Another angle: maybe it's a cognitive evaluation. But no, in Widom and Roth's model, it's more about the evaluation of the response. If it's negative, it's a negative response, not an evaluation. Evaluations are about how we process the response, but the negative response itself is what causes anxiety.

So yes, the correct answer is B: negative perception.
