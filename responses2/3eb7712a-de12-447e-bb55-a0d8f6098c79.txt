Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a motorcycle purchase on an installment plan. Hmm, let me read it again.

The motorcycle has a cash price of $275. If I take the installment plan, I pay 10% down and $18.20 each month for 18 months. I need to find two things: the finance charge and the percentage by which the installment price exceeds the cash price.

Wait, what's a finance charge? I think it's the interest charged on the borrowed amount. So the cash price is the amount you pay immediately, but the installment plan involves some interest.

First, let me calculate the total amount paid under the installment plan. Oh right, 18 months times $18.20 per month. Let me do the math. 18 times 18.20. Let me break that down: 10*18.20 is 182, 8*18.20 is 145.6. So 182+145.6 is 327.6. So total paid is $327.60.

Now, the cash price is $275. The total installment is $327.60. So the finance charge is the difference between the installment cost and the cash price. So 327.60 minus 275 equals 52.60. But wait, the options don't have 52.60 as the finance charge. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The cash price is the amount I can pay right now, but the installment plan requires paying 10% down plus monthly payments. So let me recalculate. 10% of $275 is $27.50 down. So the amount financed is $275 - $27.50 = $247.50. Then, the total installment is 18 months * $18.20. Let me calculate that again.

18 * 18.20: 10*18.20 = 182, 8*18.20=145.6, so total 327.60. So the total is 327.60 for the installment. But wait, that's the total amount paid, including the down payment. So the amount financed is $275 - $27.50 = $247.50, but the installment gives me 18*18.2 = 327.60. So the extra amount I pay is 327.60 - 275 = 52.60. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, the options for finance charge are A to J. The first one is $85.10, which is higher than 52.60. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the down payment is part of the installment plan. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the problem says 10% down and $18.20 per month for 18 months. So total payment is 10% down plus 18*18.20. So 27.50 + 327.60 = 355.10. Wait, wait, that can't be. Because the cash price is 275. So the installment total is 355.10, which is more than the cash price. So the finance charge is 355.10 - 275 = 80.10. Oh, that's option J.

But wait, let me check the options. The options go up to $100.10 as the first choice. So in this case, the finance charge is 355.10 (total paid) minus 275 (cash price) = 80.10. So that would be option J: $80.10.

Now, the second part of the question is the percent by which the installment price exceeds the cash price. So we're looking for the percentage increase from the cash price to the installment price. So the cash price is 275, the installment is 355.10. The difference is 80.10. So (80.10 / 275) *100. Let me calculate that.

80.10 / 275 = approximately 0.29145... Multiply by 100 gives about 29.145%. Rounded to the nearest tenth, that's 29.1%, which is option J. Wait, but looking at the options, J is $80.10, 29.1%.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes finance charges are calculated differently. Oh wait, no, in this case, the question is about the finance charge which is the interest paid, and the percentage is the finance charge relative to the cash price.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the cash price is 275. The total is 355.10. So the finance charge is 355.10 - 275 = 80.10. So that's the first part right. So the finance charge is $80.10, which is option J.

Then, the percentage is (80.10 / 275) *100. Let's compute that. 80.10 divided by 275: 275 goes into 80.10... Let's see, 275 * 0.3 is 82.5, which is more than 80.1. So it's a little less than 0.3. Let's compute 80.10 divided by 275.

Well, 275 × 0.29 is 79.75. Because 0.29 * 275 = (0.2*275)+(0.09*275) = 55 + 24.75 = 79.75. Then 80.10 -79.75 is 0.35. So 0.35 / 275 is 0.00127. So total is 0.29 + 0.00127 ≈ 0.29127. So about 29.127%, which is 29.1% when rounded to the nearest tenth. So the percentage is 29.1%.

Looking at the options, option J is $80.10, 29.1%. So the answer should be J.

The finance charge is the extra amount paid beyond the cash price. The total installment cost is calculated as $27.50 (10% of $275) plus $327.60 (18 months of $18.20), totaling $355.10. Subtracting the cash price of $275 gives a finance charge of $80.10. The percentage increase is ((80.10 / 275) × 100) ≈ 29.1%, matching option J.

Answer: J: $80.10, 29.1%
