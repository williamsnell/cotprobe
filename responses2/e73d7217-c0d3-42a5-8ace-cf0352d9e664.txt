Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the development of a complex society in Caral, South America. I'm a bit rusty on my history, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to understand what each option is suggesting. Let me read each option carefully.

Option A: Construction of canals for irrigation. Canals are important for water management, but I'm not sure if that's what led to a complex society. I know some communities in South America built canals for agriculture, but was that the main reason for a complex society?

Option B: Creation of a trade network for llamas. I remember llamas were used in caravans, so a trade network would facilitate trade. This could lead to economic expansion, which might have contributed to a complex society with trade connections and possibly a centralized system.

Option C: Need to collect large quantities of shellfish. Shellfish were important in trade, so this could lead to a trade network, similar to option B.

Option D: Building of the Piramide Mayor. I think the Piramide was a city in South America, maybe part of the Andean region. Not sure how this ties into a complex society.

Option E: Centralized defense against invaders. Centralized defense could mean a centralized government or military, which could contribute to a complex society, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason.

Option F: Interest in an astronomical observatory. Creating an observatory would require a lot of resources and knowledge, which might have been a driving force for complex societies. Like, maybe they needed to track celestial events for navigation or agriculture.

Option G: Excavating work to produce sunken plazas. I think sunken plazas were used for trade, as they allowed for easier access from distant areas. This would support a trade network.

Option H: Development of a hierarchical religious system. Hierarchical religions might have formal structures that facilitate governance, which could lead to a complex society.

Option I: Large-scale stone quarries. This would support agriculture, but perhaps in a way that's efficient, but it's more about resource extraction than a complex society.

Option J: Invention of a complex writing system. This seems less likely unless it's a neolithic period, but I'm not sure about the timeline.

Now, trying to think about what led to the development of a complex society. Complex societies often have strong social structures, trade networks, and organized systems. Let me consider each option.

B and C are both about trade. The llamas and shellfish are both products that could be traded, leading to a network. But I think llamas were more common than shellfish in the Andean region, so B might be more accurate.

E is about defense. Centralized defense could mean a strong, unified government, which could lead to a complex society. But I'm not sure if that's the main reason without more context.

Looking at H, a hierarchical religious system might have formal structures and governance, which is important for a complex society. But religious systems can be driven by moral or religious needs, not necessarily just about society.

Option F, the observatory, ties into astronomy, which could support trade and navigation, similar to B and C. So that's a possibility too.

But I think B is more directly tied to trade. Llamas were used in camel caravans, and their trade would have been essential for the economy, leading to a complex society with a trade network.

So, between B and F. Both are about trade. Llamas were more prevalent in trade, so F might be the better choice.

Alternatively, F is about astronomy, but that's more of a technological advancement. Maybe it's a side effect of trade. So I'm leaning towards F.

The development of a complex society in Caral, South America, likely arose from a strong trade network. The use of llamas in camel caravans facilitated a trade network, which would have supported economic activities and perhaps laid the groundwork for a complex society. This trade network would have driven the need for infrastructure, resources, and a hierarchical governance structure. 

ANSWER: F
