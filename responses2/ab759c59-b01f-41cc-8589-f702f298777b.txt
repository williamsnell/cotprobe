Question:

How does the filter-amplitude theory account for selective attention in hearing?

Options:

A: The filter-amplitude theory proposes that attention functions as a spotlight that enhances the clarity of selected sounds without affecting their intensity.
B: The filter-amplitude theory implies that attention selectively focuses on sensory inputs based on their intensity.
C: The filter-amplitude theory states that attention is only given to the loudest sound in the environment, ignoring all other stimuli.
D: The filter-amplitude theory implies that attention completely blocks out unattended information.
E: The filter-amplitude theory suggests that attention can selectively focus on multiple sounds simultaneously, without the need for filtering by intensity.
F: The filter-amplitude theory suggests that attention amplifies all incoming information equally.
G: The filter-amplitude theory asserts that attention is distributed equally across all frequencies of sound, without any selective focus.
H: The filter-amplitude theory implies that attention operates on a first-come, first-served basis, prioritizing the earliest heard sound.
I: The filter-amplitude theory suggests that attention works like a filter that attenuates rather than rejects information, allowing certain types of unattended information into the processing system.
J: The filter-amplitude theory claims that selective attention in hearing is determined by the emotional content of the sound, rather than its amplitude.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about the filter-amplitude theory and how it relates to selective attention in hearing. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll have to think it through carefully.

First, I need to understand what the filter-amplitude theory is about. From what I remember, this theory deals with how our brains process and filter sounds. I think it's related to how our ears filter different frequencies, but I'm not entirely sure. The theory in question here is specifically about attention.

The question is asking about selective attention in hearing. Selective attention refers to the brain focusing on specific sounds or information while ignoring others. So, the filter-amplitude theory must explain how this selective attention occurs, especially in the context of hearing.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one step by step.

Option A: "The filter-amplitude theory proposes that attention functions as a spotlight that enhances the clarity of selected sounds without affecting their intensity." Hmm, sounds like it's talking about the spotlight aspect, which might relate to how attention focuses on certain sounds. But I'm not sure if it's about selective attention or just enhancing clarity.

Option B: "The filter-amplitude theory implies that attention selectively focuses on sensory inputs based on their intensity." This seems promising. I remember that in the filter-amplitude model, the brain filters out certain frequencies and emphasizes others. So, if a sound has a certain amplitude (like loudness), it might be more prominent. So, when we focus on one sound, we're selecting based on its intensity, which contributes to selective attention.

Option C: "The filter-amplitude theory states that attention is only given to the loudest sound in the environment, ignoring all other stimuli." That sounds more like a filter, like a spotlight, but it's too restrictive. It's implying that only the loudest are attended, which might be part of the theory, but the option says "only given," which doesn't quite fit. Also, I don't think this option accurately describes how selective attention works in terms of intensity.

Option D: "The filter-amplitude theory implies that attention completely blocks out unattended information." This doesn't sound right. Blocking out information might refer to rejecting or filtering, but selective attention is about focusing, not blocking.

Option E: "The filter-amplitude theory suggests that attention can selectively focus on multiple sounds simultaneously, without the need for filtering by intensity." Wait, multiple sounds being filtered by their intensity? But if you're selecting sounds, you might still need to filter to include only certain ones. So this seems conflicting. Also, selective attention is about focusing on one sound, so maybe this is wrong.

Option F: "The filter-amplitude theory suggests that attention amplifies all incoming information equally." That doesn't make sense. Amplifying would mean increasing the intensity, which isn't selective attention; it's about enhancing the presence of certain sounds.

Option G: "The filter-amplitude theory asserts that attention is distributed equally across all frequencies of sound, without any selective focus." No, that contradicts the idea of selective attention. It's more about filtering, not allowing selective focus.

Option H: "The filter-amplitude theory implies that attention operates on a first-come, first-served basis, prioritizing the earliest heard sound." I'm not sure about this. I don't think the theory suggests a first-come, first-served basis. It's more about how the brain processes incoming sounds, possibly based on their amplitude or frequency.

Option I: "The filter-amplitude theory suggests that attention works like a filter that attenuates rather than rejects information, allowing certain types of unattended information into the processing system." Wait, I'm getting confused. If attention is a filter that attenuates, that might mean it's blocking out certain sounds. But in our case, selective attention is about focusing, not blocking. So I'm not sure about this.

Option J: "The filter-amplitude theory claims that selective attention in hearing is determined by the emotional content of the sound, rather than its amplitude." I don't think it's emotional content; that's more related to emotional processing. The filter-amplitude theory is about physical properties, like amplitude and frequency.

Wait, so I'm trying to remember. The filter-amplitude theory, if I recall correctly, states that the brain selectively processes sounds based on their amplitude and frequency. It's part of the auditory filter system. The theory suggests that when we're selecting sounds, like in selective attention, we're focusing on the ones with the most amplitude (or intensity) while ignoring others. 

So looking back at the options, option B says that attention selectively focuses on sensory inputs based on their intensity. That aligns with the idea that the filter adjusts based on amplitude, which affects which sounds are selected. 

So the correct answer should be option B.

The correct answer is **B: The filter-amplitude theory implies that attention selectively focuses on sensory inputs based on their intensity.**

**Explanation:**
The filter-amplitude theory explains how the brain processes sounds by filtering them based on their amplitude and frequency. This theory, particularly in the context of selective attention, suggests that attention is directed toward sounds with higher intensities (amplitude), allowing selective focus without affecting their intensity. This aligns with option B, which accurately captures the idea that attention processes sounds based on their intensity.
