Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with stoichiometry yet. Let's take it step by step.

The problem is about the reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen forming ammonia. The question gives the weight percent of nitrogen in NH3 as 82.25 and asks me to find the atomic weight of nitrogen. They also told me that the atomic weight of hydrogen is 1.008. The options are A to J, various numbers like 14, 12, etc.

Hmm, I remember that the formula for ammonia is NH3. So each molecule has one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms. So the molecular weight would be the sum of atomic weights of all atoms.

Wait, the weight percent of nitrogen is 82.25%. That means that in the ammonia molecule, 82.25% of the mass is from nitrogen, and the rest is from hydrogen.

So, let's think about the steps. I think I'll set up an equation where I can relate the masses using the given percentage.

Let me denote the atomic weight of nitrogen as N. Then, the atomic weight of hydrogen is given as 1.008. So the total mass of ammonia per molecule would be N (for N) plus 3 times 1.008 (for the three H atoms).

So the molecular weight (MW) of NH3 is N + 3*(1.008). 

The weight percent of nitrogen would be (N / (N + 3*1.008)) * 100% = 82.25%.

So I can set up the equation:

(N) / (N + 3.024) = 0.8225

Wait, because 3 * 1.008 is 3.024. So substituting that in, the equation is N/(N + 3.024) = 0.8225.

I can solve for N here. Let me rearrange the equation.

Multiply both sides by (N + 3.024):

N = 0.8225 * (N + 3.024)

Expanding the right side:

N = 0.8225N + 0.8225 * 3.024

Calculating 0.8225 * 3.024. Let's see, 3 * 0.8225 is 2.4675, and 0.024 * 0.8225 is 0.01974. So adding them gives 2.4675 + 0.01974 = 2.48724.

So the equation becomes:

N = 0.8225N + 2.48724

Subtract 0.8225N from both sides:

N - 0.8225N = 2.48724

Factor out N on the left:

0.1775 N = 2.48724

Now, divide both sides by 0.1775:

N = 2.48724 / 0.1775 ≈ ?

Let me calculate this division. 2.48724 ÷ 0.1775.

Hmm, 0.1775 is approximately 0.1775. Let's think about 2.48724 / 0.1775. Maybe multiplying numerator and denominator by 10000 to eliminate decimals.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate this. Let's see, 0.1775 * 14 = 2.485 (because 0.1775 *10=1.775, 0.1775 *4=0.71, 1.775+0.71=2.485). Oh, that's close to 2.48724.

So 0.1775 *14 = 2.485. The numerator is 2.48724. So 14 * 0.1775 = 2.485, which is about 0.00224 less than 2.48724.

So 2.48724-2.485=0.00224. So 14 gives 2.485, 14.01 would give:

0.1775 *14.01 = 14 *0.1775 + 0.1775 *0.01 = 2.485 + 0.001775= 2.486775.

Wait, but 2.486775 is still less than 2.48724. So 14.01 gives 2.486775, which is 0.000465 less than 2.48724.

Wait, that's 2.48724 - 2.486775 = 0.000465.

So how much more do I need to add? Let's see:

Each 0.0001 added to 14 gives an increase of 0.0001775 in the product.

So 0.000465 / 0.0001775 ≈ 2.607.

So approximately, 14.026 would give about 2.48724.

Wait, let me check:

14.026 *0.1775 = ?

14 *0.1775 is 2.485.

0.026 *0.1775 = 0.004615.

So total is 2.485 + 0.004615 = 2.489615, which is higher than 2.48724. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 2.48724 divided by 0.1775.

Let me set it up as long division.

Divide 2.48724 by 0.1775.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to multiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to eliminate decimals.

So 2.48724 *10000 = 24872.4

0.1775 *10000 = 1775.

So now, the division is 24872.4 / 1775.

Let's see how many times 1775 fits into 24872.

1775 x 14 is 24850. Because 1775 *10=17750; 1775*4=7100. 17750 +7100=24850.

So 14 times 1775 is 24850.

Subtract that from 24872.4:

24872.4 - 24850 = 22.4

So now, bring down the .0... but wait, it's 24872.4.

Now, 22.4 divided by 1775 is 0.0127 (since 1775*0.01=17.75; 1775*0.012 is 21.3, 1775*0.0127= 22.4225, which is close to 22.4).

So adding, 14.0127. So approximately 14.0127.

So N ≈14.0127.

Wait, but let's double-check. If N is 14.01, then the molecular weight would be 14.01 + 3*(1.008) =14.01 +3.024=17.034 g/mol.

The weight percent of N is (14.01 / 17.034) *100.

Let me calculate that:

14.01 /17.034 ≈ 0.8226, so 82.26%.

The given value is 82.25, which is very close. So our calculation gives approximately 14.01 as the atomic weight.

Looking at the options, option A is 14.01. So that's the answer.

To determine the atomic weight of nitrogen (N), we start by noting that the molecular weight of NH₃ is the sum of the atomic weights of nitrogen and three hydrogen atoms. Given that the weight percent of nitrogen in NH₃ is 82.25% and the atomic weight of hydrogen is 1.008, we set up the equation:

\[
\frac{N}{N + 3 \cdot 1.008} = 0.8225
\]

Calculating \(3 \cdot 1.008 = 3.024\), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{N}{N + 3.024} = 0.8225
\]

Rearranging and solving for \(N\):

\[
N = 0.8225 \cdot (N + 3.024)
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
N = 0.8225N + 2.48724
\]

\[
N - 0.8225N = 2.48724
\]

\[
0.1775N = 2.48724
\]

\[
N = \frac{2.48724}{0.1775} \approx 14.01
\]

Thus, the atomic weight of nitrogen is approximately 14.01. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A: 14.01**
