Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of process this AR(2) process is. The equation given is yt = 1.5 yt-1 - 0.5 yt-2 + ut. Hmm, I remember that AR processes can be categorized as stationary, non-stationary, or explosive based on their characteristic equations.

First, let's write down the AR(2) process. The general form is yt = φ1 yt-1 + φ2 yt-2 + ut. Comparing that to the given equation, φ1 is 1.5 and φ2 is -0.5. So the characteristic equation would be derived from that. The characteristic equation for an AR(p) process is 1 - φ1 z + φ2 z² = 0. Wait, actually, wait: the standard form for AR(p) is yt = φ1 yt-1 + ... + φp yt-p + ut, and the characteristic equation is 1 - φ1 z + φ2 z² - ... - φp z^p = 0. So for this AR(2) process, it's 1 - 1.5 z + 0.5 z² = 0. Or wait, is it 1 - (1.5) z + (-0.5) z²? Let me see: yt = 1.5 yt-1 -0.5 yt-2 + ut. So the equation is yt = 1.5 yt-1 - 0.5 yt-2 + ut. So the coefficients are φ1=1.5, φ2=-0.5. So the characteristic equation is 1 - φ1 z + φ2 z² = 0. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the standard form is yt = φ1 yt-1 + φ2 yt-2 + ... So the characteristic equation is obtained by replacing yt with z^t, so the equation becomes 1 = φ1 z^{-1} + φ2 z^{-2} + ... So the characteristic equation is obtained by multiplying both sides by z^2: z^2 = φ1 z + φ2. So for this case, φ1 is 1.5 and φ2 is -0.5. So the characteristic equation is z^2 = 1.5 z + (-0.5). Wait, that's z² - 1.5 z + 0.5 = 0? Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The AR(2) process is yt = φ1 yt-1 + φ2 yt-2 + ut. So the characteristic equation is found by substituting yt = z^t, so z^t = φ1 z^{t-1} + φ2 z^{t-2}. Dividing both sides by z^2: z² = φ1 z + φ2. So the characteristic equation is z² - φ1 z - φ2 = 0. Wait, no, wait: let me re-derive it. Let me write the recurrence again. yt = 1.5 yt-1 -0.5 yt-2 + ut. So the homogeneous equation is yt = 1.5 yt-1 -0.5 yt-2. To find the characteristic equation, we replace yt with z^t, so z^t = 1.5 z^{t-1} - 0.5 z^{t-2}. Dividing both sides by z^2 (assuming z ≠0), we get z² = 1.5 z -0.5. Rearranging, z² -1.5 z + 0.5 = 0. So the characteristic equation is z² - 1.5 z + 0.5 = 0.

Now, to determine if the process is stationary, non-stationary, or explosive, we look at the roots of the characteristic equation. If the roots are inside the unit circle, the process is stationary and invertible. If they lie on or outside the unit circle, it's non-stationary or explosive.

Let's compute the roots. The equation is z² -1.5 z + 0.5 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, z = [1.5 ± sqrt( (1.5)^2 - 4*1*0.5 ) ] / 2. So, (1.5)^2 is 2.25. 4*1*0.5 is 2. So sqrt(2.25 - 2) = sqrt(0.25) = 0.5. So z = [1.5 ±0.5 ] / 2.

So, the roots are (1.5 + 0.5)/2 = 2/2 =1. And (1.5 -0.5)/2 = 1/2 =0.5.

So the roots are z=1 and z=0.5. So one root is on the unit circle (z=1) and the other is inside (z=0.5 <1). 

Hmm, when a root is exactly on the unit circle, it's a unit root, which makes the process non-stationary. But wait, if another root is inside the unit circle, then the process is stationary, right? Because the presence of a root on the unit circle indicates a unit root (a permanent effect), and any roots inside indicate that the process can be expressed as a converging series, making it stationary.

Wait, but if one root is exactly on the unit circle and the other inside, what does that imply? Let me think. The presence of a root on the unit circle (z=1) means the process has a unit root. The other root being inside (z=0.5) suggests that the process is invertible and the system is stable. So, this process is non-stationary because of the unit root but is stationary overall.

Alternatively, another way to look at it: if the roots are inside the unit circle, the process is stationary. If any root is outside (i.e., |z|>1), it's explosive. But here, one root is exactly on the unit circle, which is a boundary case. So, in AR(2) terms, if one root is on the unit circle and the other is inside, the process is non-stationary because the presence of a unit root (even if the other root is inside) leads to non-stationarity. But I'm a bit confused about whether the presence of a root on the unit circle alone makes the process non-stationary. 

Wait, another approach: The process is non-stationary if any root is outside the unit circle, but if a root is on the unit circle and others are inside, it's non-stationary because the unit root causes the process to have a deterministic component that doesn't return to zero at infinity, leading to non-stationarity.

So, in this case, the roots are 1 and 0.5. So one root is on the unit circle. So the process is non-stationary. But wait, if one root is exactly 1, then the process has a unit root, which could mean it's a persistent process. But does that make it explosive or just non-stationary?

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the magnitude of the roots. A root on the unit circle is exactly at the boundary, so if any root is on the unit circle, the process is non-stationary, regardless of other roots. So in this case, the process is non-stationary.

Wait, but the process is AR(2) with one root on the unit circle, but the other inside. So it's non-stationary because of the unit root, but it's also invertible because all roots are inside or on the circle. Wait, no, invertibility is determined by the roots of the characteristic equation of the moving average part. But in our case, we're dealing with an AR process, so invertibility is about stationarity. Wait, no, for AR processes, invertibility is not about the roots of the moving average equation, but the characteristic equation of the AR part.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. The process is AR(2), so it's only about the AR part. The invertibility of the AR process (whether it's invertible) is determined by the roots of the AR characteristic equation. So, if any root is outside the unit circle, the process is non-stationary. If any root is on the unit circle, the process is non-stationary (but note that for invertibility, all roots should be outside, but that may not be the case here).

Wait, in our case, one root is exactly on the unit circle, and the other is inside. So that would make the AR process non-stationary because of the root on the unit circle. But if one root is on the unit circle and the other is inside, then the process is non-stationary because the presence of a unit root (even if the other root is inside) causes the process to be non-stationary.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me refer to the general rule. In an AR(p) process, if any root is on or outside the unit circle, the process is non-stationary. So in this case, since one root is exactly on the unit circle, the process is non-stationary. However, the other root is inside, so it doesn't cause a problem of being explosive.

But wait, another point: if any root is outside, the process is explosive. If any root is on the unit circle, the process is non-stationary and not explosive. Because the presence of a unit root just makes it non-stationary but does not cause the process to explode.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of an example. If you have an AR(1) process with φ = 1, it's a unit root, so it's non-stationary but not explosive. So, in that case, the process is non-stationary because of the unit root, but it's not explosive.

So applying that to AR(2): if there's any root outside the unit circle, the process is explosive. If at least one root is on the unit circle, the process is non-stationary. So in this case, because there's a root on the unit circle, the process is non-stationary. But the other root is inside, so it's not explosive. So the process is non-stationary but not explosive.

Looking back at the answer options:

Options:

A: Non-stationary and unit root process

B: Unit root process

C: Explosive process

D: Unit root and explosive process.

E: Stationary and unit root process.

F: Non-stationary and explosive.

G: Both stationary and explosive.

H: Non-stationary.

I: Neither stationary, unit root, nor explosive.

J: Stationary.

So, the correct description would be non-stationary and not explosive. So the process is non-stationary because of the root on the unit circle, but since all other roots are inside, it's not explosive. So the process is non-stationary but not explosive.

So, looking at the options, F says "Non-stationary and explosive process." G is "Both stationary and explosive." H is "Non-stationary." But wait, the process is non-stationary, but is it explosive?

Wait, no. An explosive process is one where the roots lie outside the unit circle. So if any root is outside, it's explosive. If a root is on the unit circle, it's non-stationary but not explosive. So, in this case, the process is non-stationary but not explosive. So the correct category would be 'non-stationary but not explosive', which isn't any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait, no. Let me read the options again.

The options are:

A: Non-stationary and unit root process.

B: Unit root.

C: Explosive.

D: Unit root and explosive.

E: Stationary and unit root.

F: Non-stationary and explosive.

G: Both stationary and explosive.

H: Non-stationary.

I: Neither.

J: Stationary.

So, does this process have a unit root and is it explosive? Let's see.

Since one root is exactly on the unit circle, the process is non-stationary. But the other root is inside, so it's not explosive. So the process is non-stationary, but not explosive. So which option says that?

Looking at F: Non-stationary and explosive. No, because it's non-stationary, not explosive. So F is incorrect.

So, which option fits non-stationary but not explosive? The options don't have that. Let me look again.

Wait, option F is "Non-stationary and explosive." That would apply if both were true, but in our case, the process is non-stationary (due to the unit root) but not explosive (because none of the roots are outside). So the process is non-stationary but not explosive.

But none of the options F, G, etc., have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the roots. The roots are 1 and 0.5. So, the process is non-stationary because of the root at 1. But the other root is inside the unit circle. So, the process is non-stationary but not explosive.

But the options don't have a category that says "Non-stationary but not explosive." So perhaps I made a mistake in how I'm interpreting the roots.

Wait, another approach: the AR(2) process is given by yt = 1.5 yt-1 -0.5 yt-2 + ut. The characteristic equation is z² - 1.5 z + 0.5 = 0. The roots are 1 and 0.5. So, one root is on the unit circle; the other inside.

So, in AR processes, if any root is on or outside the unit circle, the process is non-stationary. If any root is outside, it's explosive. So if any root is on the unit circle, it's non-stationary but not explosive. So, the process is non-stationary, but not explosive. So, the category should be 'Non-stationary' (option H) and 'Non-explosive' (but in the options, there's no such option).

Wait, looking back at the options, the only options that fit are:

H: Non-stationary.

But the process is non-stationary, but not explosive. So in the options, which one is correct?

Wait, the question says, 'this is a' category. The options are:

A: Non-stationary and unit root.

B: Unit root.

C: Explosive.

D: Unit root and explosive.

E: Stationary and unit root.

F: Non-stationary and explosive.

G: Both stationary and explosive.

H: Non-stationary.

I: Neither.

J: Stationary.

So the correct description is that the process is non-stationary (because of the root on the unit circle) but not explosive (because all other roots are inside). So the correct answer is non-stationary. But the options don't have a category that says 'Non-stationary and non-explosive.' So the options are only option H (non-stationary), but the process is also non-explosive, so it's non-stationary and non-explosive. But that's not listed.

Wait, the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is H: Non-stationary and unit root process. But that's not correct because the process is non-stationary due to the unit root, not that it's a unit root process.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the roots again.

Wait, the roots are 1 and 0.5. So, the process is non-stationary because of the root at 1, but it's invertible because all roots are inside. That's correct. So, the process is non-stationary but not explosive. So, the correct category is non-stationary.

But in the options, the only category that includes non-stationarity is option H. So, the correct answer would be H: Non-stationary.

Wait, but in the options, option F is 'Non-stationary and explosive.' That's incorrect because the process is not explosive.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the question again. The question is, "This is a" category. The options are what the process is.

Another way to approach: perhaps the presence of a unit root (a root at 1) and a root inside (so not on the unit circle) leads to a non-stationary but invertible process. So, the process is non-stationary, but not explosive.

Looking at the options, the only option that directly describes non-stationary is option H. So the correct answer is H: Non-stationary.

Wait, but another point: if a root is on the unit circle, does that imply that the process is non-stationary? Yes, because the unit root causes the process to have a unit root, which makes it non-stationary. However, the presence of a unit root does not make it explosive. So the process is non-stationary, but not explosive.

So the correct option is H: Non-stationary.

But wait, the options don't have an option that says 'Non-stationary and non-explosive.' So perhaps the correct answer is H: Non-stationary.

Wait, but the process is not explosive. So the correct answer is that it's non-stationary (so option H) and not explosive.

But the options don't include that. The closest is option F: Non-stationary and explosive. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. Let me re-calculate the roots.

The characteristic equation is z² - 1.5 z + 0.5 =0.

Using quadratic formula: z = [1.5 ± sqrt( (1.5)^2 -4*1*0.5 ) ]/(2*1)

Compute the discriminant: (1.5)^2 = 2.25, 4*1*0.5=2. So 2.25-2=0.25. Square root is 0.5.

So, z = [1.5 ±0.5 ] /2.

So, (1.5+0.5)=2 → 2/2=1.

(1.5-0.5)=1 → 1/2=0.5.

So roots are 1 and 0.5. So, one is on the unit circle, the other inside.

So, the process is non-stationary because of the unit root, but since the other root is inside, it's invertible. So, the process is non-stationary, but not explosive.

Looking at the options, the correct one would be H: Non-stationary. But the process is not explosive, so it's non-stationary and not explosive. But option F says 'Non-stationary and explosive,' which is incorrect. Option G says 'Both stationary and explosive,' which is incorrect. Option F is incorrect, H is correct.

Wait, but I'm confused because AR processes with a unit root are non-stationary, but not explosive. So, the correct category is non-stationary, so option H.

So, the correct answer is H: Non-stationary.

But wait, another point: the process has a unit root and is non-stationary, but since the other root is inside, it's invertible. So, the process is non-stationary. So, the correct answer is option H: Non-stationary.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says 'Non-stationary and non-explosive.' So perhaps the correct answer is H: Non-stationary.

Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Non-stationary and unit root

B: Unit root

C: Explosive

D: Unit root and explosive

E: Stationary and unit root

F: Non-stationary and explosive

G: Both stationary and explosive

H: Non-stationary

I: Neither

J: Stationary

So, the correct answer is H: Non-stationary.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way to think: The presence of a unit root in an AR process means that it's non-stationary, but it's not explosive. So, the correct category is non-stationary. So option H is correct.

But wait, another angle: if a root is on the unit circle, the process is non-stationary. So, the correct answer is H: Non-stationary.

Wait, but the options don't have any option that says 'Non-stationary and non-explosive.'

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. So, the correct answer is H: Non-stationary.

But wait, another thought: the process is non-stationary because of the unit root, but the other root is inside. So, the process is non-stationary, but not explosive.

But in the options, the only option that says 'Non-stationary' is option H. So, the correct answer is option H.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought one root is on the unit circle and the other is inside, making the process non-stationary. So, the correct answer is H: Non-stationary.

Wait, but another point: if a root is on the unit circle, the process is non-stationary, but not explosive. So, the process is non-stationary, but not explosive.

In the options, the correct category would be H: Non-stationary.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the process is explosive because the roots are outside the unit circle. But no, because one root is on the unit circle, so the process isn't explosive.

So, the process is non-stationary, but not explosive. So, the correct answer is H: Non-stationary.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says 'Non-stationary and non-explosive.' So perhaps the correct answer is H: Non-stationary.

So, the conclusion is that the process is non-stationary, so the correct answer is H.

Wait, but another point: let's think about the process's behavior. The AR(2) process with one root on the unit circle and the other inside would mean that the process has a deterministic component, but it doesn't return to zero. So, it's non-stationary. But for explosiveness, if all the roots were outside, the process would be explosive. But in our case, one root is on the unit circle, so the process is non-stationary, but not explosive.

So, the correct answer is H: Non-stationary.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says 'Non-stationary and non-explosive.' So perhaps the correct answer is H: Non-stationary.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting results. Let me think differently.

The process is AR(2), so it's AR(2) with roots 1 and 0.5. So, in this case, the process is non-stationary because of the unit root, but the other root is inside, so it's invertible. So, the process is non-stationary, but not explosive.

Looking at the options:

A: Non-stationary and unit root process.

B: Unit root.

C: Explosive.

D: Unit root and explosive.

E: Stationary and unit root.

F: Non-stationary and explosive.

G: Both stationary and explosive.

H: Non-stationary.

I: Neither.

J: Stationary.

So, the correct answer is H: Non-stationary.

Wait, but another point: I think I might have made a mistake in how I'm analyzing the roots. Let me re-calculate.

The characteristic equation for the AR(2) process is z² - φ1 z - φ2 =0. So in our case, the equation is z² -1.5 z +0.5=0. Wait, no, because the AR(2) equation is yt = φ1 yt-1 + φ2 yt-2 + ut. So, the characteristic equation is 1 - φ1 z - φ2 z² =0. So, for our case, 1 -1.5 z -0.5 z² =0. Which rearranges to 0.5 z² +1.5 z -1 =0. Multiply through by 2 to eliminate decimals: z² +3 z -2 =0.

Wait, wait a second. I think I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me do this again.

The given equation is yt = 1.5 yt-1 -0.5 yt-2 + ut.

So, moving all terms to the left side: yt -1.5 yt-1 +0.5 yt-2 - ut =0.

So, the characteristic equation is obtained by replacing yt with 1, yt-1 with z, yt-2 with z², etc. But the standard approach is to write the equation as yt = φ1 yt-1 + φ2 yt-2 + ut. Then, the characteristic equation is 1 - φ1 z - φ2 z² =0. So, for our case: 1 -1.5 z - (-0.5) z² =0 → 1 -1.5 z +0.5 z² =0 → 0.5 z² -1.5 z +1 =0.

Multiply through by 2 to eliminate decimals: z² -3 z +2 =0.

So, solving for z: z² -3 z +2 =0 → (z-1)(z-2)=0 → z=1 and z=2.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my initial calculation. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the correct characteristic equation for the AR(2) process is obtained by:

yt - φ1 yt-1 - φ2 yt-2 = ut.

So, the characteristic equation is 1 - φ1 z - φ2 z² =0.

For our equation: yt =1.5 yt-1 -0.5 yt-2 + ut.

So, moving terms: yt -1.5 yt-1 +0.5 yt-2 - ut =0.

So, the coefficients for yt-1 is 1.5, for yt-2 is 0.5.

So, the characteristic equation is: 1 -1.5 z -0.5 z² =0 → rearranged: 0.5 z² +1.5 z -1 =0.

Multiply through by 2: z² +3 z -2 =0.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, the correct characteristic equation is z² +3 z -2 =0.

So, solving for z: z = [-3 ± sqrt(9 +8)]/2 → [-3 ± sqrt(17)]/2.

So, the roots are (-3 + sqrt(17))/2 and (-3 - sqrt(17))/2.

Compute sqrt(17): approximately 4.123.

So, first root: (-3 +4.123)/2 = (1.123)/2 ≈0.5615.

Second root: (-3 -4.123)/2 = (-7.123)/2 ≈-3.5615.

So, the roots are approximately 0.5615 and -3.5615.

So, the roots are in the left half-plane (negative real part) and in the right half-plane (positive real part).

So, the process is non-stationary because of the root in the right half-plane. Wait, but that's a root outside the unit circle.

Wait, but the process is non-stationary because of a root outside the unit circle. So, the process is non-stationary.

But the other root is inside the unit circle. So, the process is non-stationary, but invertible.

But wait, in this scenario, the process is non-stationary because of a root outside the unit circle, so it's non-stationary.

Wait, but in this case, the roots are 0.5615 and -3.5615. So, 0.5615 is inside the unit circle (|z|=0.5615 <1), but -3.5615 is outside (|z|=3.5615>1).

So, the roots are 0.5615 and -3.5615. So, one root is inside the unit circle, the other is outside.

So, in AR processes, when a root is outside the unit circle, the process is explosive. When a root is inside, the process is not explosive.

In this case, the process is non-stationary because of a root outside the unit circle, so it's explosive.

Wait, but that's a contradiction because the other root is inside.

But no, wait, the presence of a root outside the unit circle makes the process explosive, regardless of the other roots.

Wait, but that can't be. Because if a root is outside, the process is explosive, but the other roots being inside, then the process is still explosive.

Wait, but according to the standard theory, if a root is outside the unit circle, the process is explosive, regardless of other roots. So, in this case, the process is explosive.

But earlier, I thought the presence of a unit root makes it non-stationary but not explosive.

But according to the standard theory, the presence of a root outside the unit circle makes the process explosive. So, in this case, the process is explosive.

Wait, but the presence of a unit root doesn't make the process explosive. It just makes the process non-stationary.

So, in this case, the process is non-stationary because of the unit root, and it's explosive because of the root outside the unit circle.

So, the process is non-stationary and explosive.

So, the correct answer is F: Non-stationary and explosive.

Wait, but this contradicts my earlier analysis.

Wait, let me re-express this.

The process is non-stationary because of the unit root (z=1). But, the other root is at z≈-3.56, which is outside the unit circle, so the process is explosive.

Therefore, the process is non-stationary and explosive.

So, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the process is non-stationary because of the unit root, but not explosive. So, that was a mistake.

So, the correct answer is F: Non-stationary and explosive.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting results. Let me clarify.

The presence of a unit root (z=1) makes the process non-stationary. But for the process to be explosive, it also requires a root outside the unit circle (|z|>1). So, in this case, the process is non-stationary and explosive.

So, the correct answer is F.

But wait, but the other root is inside the unit circle. So, the process is non-stationary because of the unit root, and it's explosive because of the root outside the unit circle.

So, the process is non-stationary and explosive.

Therefore, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in AR processes, a root outside the unit circle makes the process explosive, regardless of other roots.

So, in this case, the process is non-stationary and explosive.

Therefore, the correct answer is F: Non-stationary and explosive.

But earlier, I thought that the presence of a unit root makes the process non-stationary but not explosive. That was a mistake.

So, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Non-stationary and unit root.

B: Unit root.

C: Explosive.

D: Unit root and explosive.

E: Stationary and unit root.

F: Non-stationary and explosive.

G: Both stationary and explosive.

H: Non-stationary.

I: Neither.

J: Stationary.

So, the correct answer is F: Non-stationary and explosive.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the process is non-stationary because of the unit root, but since the other root is outside the unit circle, the process is explosive.

So, the process is non-stationary and explosive.

Therefore, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the process is non-stationary and not explosive, which was incorrect.

So, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but the options don't have F as the correct answer.

Wait, no, option F is "Non-stationary and explosive."

So, that's the correct answer.

Therefore, the answer is F.

Wait, but the initial analysis was wrong.

So, the correct answer is F: Non-stationary and explosive.

Wait, but according to the options, which is correct?

I'm getting confused.

Ok, final conclusion:

The process is non-stationary because of the unit root. However, because there's a root outside the unit circle, the process is explosive.

Thus, the correct answer is F: Non-stationary and explosive.

Wait, but option F is "Non-stationary and explosive."

Yes.

So, the correct answer is F.

The correct answer is F: Non-stationary and explosive.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the AR(2) Process:**
   The given process is:
   \[
   y_t = 1.5 y_{t-1} - 0.5 y_{t-2} + u_t
   \]
   This is an AR(2) (autoregressive of order 2) process.

2. **Formulate the Characteristic Equation:**
   To analyze the stationarity, we form the characteristic equation:
   \[
   1 - 1.5 z + 0.5 z^2 = 0
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   0.5 z^2 - 1.5 z + 1 = 0
   \]
   Multiply through by 2 to eliminate decimals:
   \[
   z^2 - 3 z + 2 = 0
   \]

3. **Solve the Characteristic Equation:**
   Factor the quadratic equation:
   \[
   (z - 1)(z - 2) = 0
   \]
   The roots are:
   \[
   z = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad z = 2
   \]

4. **Analyze the Roots for Stationarity:**
   - A root inside the unit circle (|z| < 1) does not affect stationarity.
   - A root outside the unit circle (|z| > 1) makes the process **explosive**.

5. **Determine the Nature of the Process:**
   - The root at \( z = 1 \) makes the process **non-stationary**.
   - The root at \( z = 2 \) (outside the unit circle) makes the process **explosive**.

6. **Conclusion:**
   The process is **non-stationary** and **explosive**.

**Answer:** F: Non-stationary and explosive.
