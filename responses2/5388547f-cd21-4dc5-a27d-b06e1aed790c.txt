Question:

A mail clerk domiciled in State A slipped and fell on ice that had formed near the loading dock of the building in State B where the clerk's State B employer leased space for its headquarters. The building was owned and operated by a State C corporation. As a result of the fall, the clerk was injured and the employer's expensive computer he was carrying was badly damaged. The clerk sued the building owner for negligence in a federal district court in State B, seeking $100,000 in personal-injury damages. The employer has filed a timely motion to intervene, asserting an $80,000 negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer. Is the court likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene?

Options:

A: No, because the employer cannot intervene in a personal injury case.
B: No, because the employer's claim is not directly related to the clerk's personal injury claim.
C: Yes, because the employer also has a direct negligence claim against the building owner.
D: No, because although the employer has an interest in the clerk's action, that interest is not likely to be impaired in the employer's absence.
E: No, because the employer's claim exceeds the amount the clerk is seeking in damages.
F: Yes, because the employer is an indispensable party.
G: Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.
H: No, because the clerk chose not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff in his action.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the employer can successfully interject in this case. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

The clerk is a mail clerk from State A who slipped and fell on ice near the loading dock in State B where the employer's office is located. The building in State C owns and operates this building. The employer leased space where the computer was, which caused the injury and damage. The employer is suing the building owner for negligence, and the court is in State B. The clerk is seeking $100,000 in personal injury damages. The employer is moving to intervene with an $80,000 claim against the building owner for the computer damage.

So, the question is whether the employer can bring this interposition. The options are A through H, each making a different argument.

I remember that interposition in contracts for injury claims usually depends on a few factors: the facts, the jurisdiction, and the burden of proof.

First, the main issue here is whether the employer's claim is a valid direct or indirect negligence claim. The employer is asserting a $80k claim against the building owner for the damage to their computer. The employee is suing the owner for $100k in damages. The employer is bringing a motion saying that the injury and the damage are directly related, and their claim is valid.

Wait, but are the two claims (employee's injury and damage) directly related? I think in some jurisdictions, if the employer's claim is a direct claim of damages to the computer, and the employee is claiming personal injury, does that mean they're directly related? Or is it the other way around?

I think under common law, a direct claim of damages is a direct claim of damages, and a personal injury claim might be separate. But when it comes to interposition, if the employer's claim is a direct claim of damages, it might be considered a separate matter. Wait, but the employer is bringing it against the building owner, and the employee is bringing it against the same owner.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Another approach: the employer is bringing a claim against the owner, and the employee is bringing a claim against the owner. If the employer's claim is a direct negligence claim (to the owner for the computer damage) and the employee's claim is a personal injury claim, then the employer is bringing a separate claim. But interposition is about whether the employer's claim can stand as a separate claim, which it can if it's a valid negligence claim.

But wait, the employer is bringing a new claim against the owner, so if the owner has already been sued for something else, does that affect the new claim? I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe it's about whether the employer's claim is a direct claim of damages. If the employer is bringing a claim for the damage to the computer, and the employee is seeking personal injury, then the employer's claim is a separate claim. But in some cases, if the employer is bringing a claim against the same party (the owner), then that's a separate matter. But the question is whether the employer can successfully interpose.

Wait, another point: the employer's claim is for damages to the computer, which is a separate matter. So, if the employer's claim is a valid negligence claim, and the employee's claim is a direct injury claim, then the employer can interpose.

But wait, the employer is using the computer as part of their premises. So, if the employer is suing the owner, then the injury could be related to the computer's damage. So, the employer's claim is that the owner's negligence caused the computer damage, which is directly related to the employee's injury.

So, under the common law, a plaintiff can bring a separate claim against the same defendant if the defendant is liable for the plaintiff's claim. But in this case, the employer is bringing a separate claim (against the owner), and the employee is bringing a separate claim (against the owner). The employer's claim is a separate matter from the employee's, so maybe they can interpose.

Wait, but could the employer's claim be considered a separate matter? I think so. If the employer is bringing a claim for damages to the computer, it's a separate cause of action because it's not the same as the employee's claim of personal injury. So, the employer can bring the interposition.

Another consideration: the fact that the employer is bringing the claim against the owner. But the owner is the same as the clerk's employer. So, if the owner is the same entity, the employer can bring a separate claim. But wait, the employer is now bringing a claim against the same owner. So, the question is whether the employer can successfully assert a negligence claim against the owner.

Wait, but if the employer is suing the owner, is that a separate matter? I think yes. Because the owner can be sued for damages, and the employer can bring a separate claim against them for the same injury.

Alternatively, perhaps the fact that the employer is bringing the claim against the owner is irrelevant, but that could be a red herring. The important thing is whether the employer's claim is valid.

Wait, but another angle: the employer is bringing a claim against the owner, and the owner is the same as the clerk's employer. So, the employer is a defendant in the same suit. But the employer is bringing a separate claim against the owner. So, if the owner is liable for both the employee's claim and the employer's claim, that would complicate things. But I think each claim is separate, so the employer can bring their own claim.

Wait, but the question is whether the employer can successfully interpose. So, in this scenario, the employer's claim is a separate claim of damages to the computer (as a negligence claim against the owner), and the employee is seeking personal injury. The employer can bring interposition because the claims are separate. But wait, maybe the employer's claim is a separate matter from the employee's claim of personal injury.

Alternatively, maybe the employer's claim is a direct claim of damages, and the employee's claim is a separate injury claim. So, the employer can interpose.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: Yes, because the employer has a direct negligence claim against the building owner.

Option G: Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.

Wait, the common law approach is that a direct claim of damages can be brought against the same defendant as a plaintiff's claim of personal injury. So, the employer's claim is a valid negligence claim against the owner, and the employee's claim is a separate claim. So, the employer can bring interposition.

But wait, could the employer's claim be considered as a separate matter? Or is it a matter of common law, where a plaintiff can bring a separate claim against the same defendant if the defendant is liable for that claim.

So, the court would likely grant the interposition because the employer is bringing a valid negligence claim against the owner, which is the same as the employer's suit. But I'm not entirely sure.

Another point: the employer is asserting an $80k claim against the owner. The employee is seeking $100k in damages. The employer is considering moving to interject. So, if the employer can bring a valid claim, it's an interposition.

But looking at the options, option C says yes because the employer has a direct negligence claim against the owner. Option G says yes because the claims share common law issues.

Wait, but the employer's claim is being brought against the owner, and the employee is seeking damages against the owner. So, the employer is bringing a separate claim against the owner. So, the employer can interpose.

But let me think about the jurisdiction. The problem states the court is in State B. So in State B, a plaintiff can bring a separate claim against the same defendant if the defendant is liable. So, the employer can bring a separate claim against the owner.

Alternatively, if the employer is suing the owner for the damages to the computer, the court could grant interposition.

Wait, but the options are about whether the court will grant interposition. So, the options are about whether the interposition is granted.

In some jurisdictions, a plaintiff can bring a separate claim against the defendant if the defendant is liable for that claim. So, the employer can bring a separate claim against the owner for the computer damage, and the court can grant interposition.

But another point: I think that a plaintiff can bring a separate claim against the defendant if the defendant is liable for that claim. So, the employer can bring a claim against the owner for the $80k, and the court can grant interposition.

So, the court would likely grant the interposition.

Looking at the options, option C says yes because the employer has a direct negligence claim against the owner. Option G says yes because the claims share common questions and facts.

Wait, but what about the fact that the employer is bringing the claim against the owner for a separate cause of action? Maybe the court won't grant interposition if the employer is not the same person as the plaintiff, but in this case, the employer is the plaintiff's employer, so they are the same.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider each option.

Option A: No, because the employer cannot interpose in a personal injury case. That doesn't make sense because the employer is a plaintiff suing the owner, so they could interpose.

Option B: No, because the employer's claim isn't directly related. But if the employer's claim is a separate matter, that doesn't necessarily make it not directly related. So, B might not be the reason.

Option C: Yes, because the employer has a direct negligence claim against the owner. That's a valid argument because the employer is bringing a claim against the owner for damages.

Option D: No, because the employer's claim exceeds the $100k sought by the employee. But the employer is bringing a $80k claim, which is less than the $100k sought by the employee. So, D is incorrect.

Option E: No because the employer's claim exceeds the employee's request. As I thought, the employer's claim is $80k, which is less than $100k. So, E is incorrect.

Option F: Yes, because the employer is indispensable. But what does "indispensable" mean? The employer is the plaintiff's employer, so they are always involved in any suit. So, the employer would be indispensable. So, F might be an argument.

Option G: Yes, because the claims share common questions. So, for example, both the employer and the employee are seeking damages for the same injury (slip and fall), and the employer is seeking a separate claim of damages to the owner for the same injury. So, the questions are similar.

Option H: No because the clerk chose not to join the employer. But the employer is bringing the interposition, so that's not the issue.

So, the key arguments are about whether the employer can bring a valid claim.

From common law, a plaintiff can bring a separate claim against the defendant if the defendant is liable for that claim. So, as the employer, they can seek a separate claim against the owner for the $80k damages.

So, the court would grant interposition.

So, looking at the options, both C and G are possible. But the options are exclusive, so which is correct?

Wait, let's think about the jurisdiction. If the jurisdiction has a common law approach, then the court can grant interposition.

So, the correct answer would include whether the employer can bring a separate claim against the owner for the damages.

So, the options are C and G.

But which is correct? Let me think about the construction of the options.

Option C says the employer has a direct claim against the owner. That's a valid argument.

Option G says the employer's claim shares common questions with the employee's. That's also a valid argument.

So, both C and G are correct reasons.

But in the options, only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the employer is not an independent party, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the employer is the plaintiff's employer, so the same person is both the plaintiff and the defendant. So, when the employer is bringing the claim against the owner, is that a separate matter?

Wait, I think that a plaintiff can bring a separate claim against the defendant. So, the court can grant interposition. So, the correct answer is either C or G.

But looking at the options, both C and G are valid.

But in the options, only one is an option, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another angle: the employer is bringing a claim against the owner for the damages to the computer, which is a separate cause of action. So, the employer can bring interposition.

Now, looking at the options, option C and G are both correct.

But perhaps the employer's claim is not directly related. Wait, no, the employer is the plaintiff and the owner is the defendant. So, the employer can bring a separate claim.

Wait, but the issue is whether the employer can bring the interposition. So, the court would grant interposition.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option C says yes because the employer has a direct claim against the owner.

Option G says yes because the claims share common questions.

So, both are valid reasons.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But why? Because the employer is bringing a separate claim against the owner for the $80k. So, the court can grant interposition.

Alternatively, G is about the questions being the same.

But perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but let me think about what the court would do. If the employer is suing the owner for $80k damages, the court would likely grant interposition because the claims are valid. So, the court will affirm the interposition.

So, looking at the options, C and G are correct. But since the options are exclusive, perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Another approach: in some states, a defendant can be sued for damages to a claimant, even if the claimant is suing the same defendant. So, if the employer is suing the owner for the damages to the computer, and the employee is suing the owner for personal injury, then the employer can interpose.

So, the correct answer is that the court will grant the interposition.

Looking back at the options, which of the options are correct. So, C and G are both possible reasons.

Wait, option C is correct because the employer can bring a direct negligence claim against the owner. Option G is also correct because the claims share common questions.

But in the given options, both C and G would be correct, but since each option is a separate choice, I have to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the employer can bring a direct claim against the owner for the damages. So, the court can grant interposition.

Alternatively, G is correct because the claims share common questions.

Wait, but both options are correct. But in the answer choices, they are presented as options, so I have to pick the best answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the employer is a plaintiff and the owner is the defendant. So, they can bring a separate claim.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the employer is not an independent party, so the claim is not valid.

Wait, but the employer is the plaintiff's employer, so they are always involved. So, they can bring interposition.

So, the court will grant the interposition, and the correct answer is C or G.

But looking at the options, the correct answer is C and G, but each is a separate option.

Wait, but the options are presented as the answer, not as multiple correct options. So, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the common law approach. In common law, a plaintiff can bring a separate cause of action against the defendant.

So, the employer can bring a claim against the owner for the $80k damages.

So, the court would grant interposition.

So, the correct answer is C.

Wait, but another thought: wait, the employer is suing the owner for the damages to the computer. So, the employer is bringing a claim against the owner for damages to an item (the computer) that was left by the employer. So, the employer can bring that as a separate claim.

So, the correct answer would be C or G.

But looking back at the options, option C says yes because the employer has a direct claim against the owner.

Option G says yes because the claims share common questions and facts.

Both are valid reasons, but perhaps the correct answer is C because it's a direct claim.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G because the claims are about the same injury, but the employer is bringing a separate claim.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit tangled here. Another approach: the correct answer is C because the employer can bring a direct claim against the owner for the $80k damages.

But looking at the options, option C is about a direct claim against the owner. So, the court would grant interposition.

So, I think the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around whether the employer can successfully interpose in a case where the employer is seeking $80,000 damages for damages to a computer, while the employee is seeking $100,000 in damages for a personal injury claim. The employer is suing the owner of the building for negligence, and the employee is seeking interposition. The analysis focuses on whether the employer can bring interposition under common law principles.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Employer's Claim as a Separate Cause of Action**:  
   Under common law, a plaintiff can bring a separate claim against the defendant if the defendant is liable for that claim. The employer, as the plaintiff, can seek damages for damages to the computer as a separate cause of action. This means the employer can bring interposition.

2. **Direct Negligence Claim**:  
   The employer is bringing a claim against the owner for damages to the computer. This is a direct claim of damages against the owner, which is valid under common law.

3. **Common Questions and Facts**:  
   The issues in both claims are similar: the employer is seeking damages for damages to the computer, and the employee is seeking damages for a personal injury claim. The questions of law and fact are shared between the two parties.

4. **Interposition in Common Law**:  
   In common law, a plaintiff can bring a separate claim against the defendant if the defendant is liable for that claim. Since the employer is bringing a claim against the owner for damages to the computer, the court can grant interposition.

5. **Inability to Introduce New Questions**:  
   The issue of whether the employer can introduce new questions is not relevant here. The focus is on the validity of the employer's claim.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The employer can bring interposition as a separate claim against the owner for damages to the computer.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The employer's claim is not directly related to the injured employee's claim of personal injury.
- **Option C**: Correct. The employer can bring a direct claim against the owner for damages to the computer, and the court can grant interposition.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The employer's claim is less than the employee's sought damages.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The employer's claim does not exceed the employee's sought damages.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The employer is indispensable to the suit.
- **Option G**: Correct. The employer's claim shares common questions with the employee's claim of damages for personal injury.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The clerk is not the same as the employer, but the employer is bringing interposition.

### Conclusion:

The correct answer is **C**, as the employer can bring a valid direct claim against the owner for damages to the computer, and the court can grant interposition. While **G** is also a valid reason, **C** is the most direct and concise explanation.

ANSWER: C
