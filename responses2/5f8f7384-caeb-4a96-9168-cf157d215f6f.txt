Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the weight of the water and its volume in cubic feet. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I'll read the question again to make sure I understand what's given and what's being asked. The container weighs 3.22 lb force when empty. When filled with water at 60°F, the mass of the container and its contents is 1.95 slugs. I need to find the weight of the water and the volume in cubic feet.

Wait, I remember that slugs are a unit of mass, not pounds. So, the container's mass plus water equals 1.95 slugs. Hmm, but when the container is filled, the mass is given, which includes the water. So the mass of the water would be the total mass minus the empty mass.

Let me jot this down. The empty container is 3.22 lb force, which is its weight. So the mass of the empty container would be weight divided by gravity, but wait, I'm not sure about the units here. Oh wait, the density is given as 62.4 lb force per cubic foot. Oh right, density is mass per volume, so when using the units I remember, density (ρ) is mass (m) divided by volume (V), and the units would be lb/ft³ for water.

Wait, but wait. The mass of the container plus water is 1.95 slugs. Oh wait, slugs are a unit of mass. So if the container is 1.95 slugs full, then the mass of the water is (1.95 - m_empty) where m_empty is the empty mass.

Wait no, the container's empty mass would be the weight divided by gravity. But wait, the container's weight is 3.22 lb force, which is a force. Force is mass times acceleration due to gravity. Since the problem states to assume standard gravity, perhaps? Let me think. Oh, but in imperial units, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 32.2 ft/s². So the mass of the empty container would be weight divided by g.

But wait, the mass of the water would be the total mass (1.95 slugs) minus the mass of the empty container. Let me proceed.

So, weight of the container when empty is 3.22 lb. So its mass is 3.22 / g. But wait, g is 32.2 ft/s². So mass of empty container is 3.22 / 32.2 = approximately 0.10 lb mass? Wait no, that can't be right. Wait no, wait, the mass is weight divided by g. So, 3.22 lb force / 32.2 ft/s² would give mass in slugs. Because in imperial units, force equals mass times acceleration, and mass is in slugs.

So yes, the mass of the empty container is 3.22 / 32.2 = 0.10 lb mass. Wait, 32.2 is approximately 32.2 ft/s². So 3.22 / 32.2 = 0.10 lb. So m_empty = 0.10 lb mass.

Wait, but the mass of the container plus water is 1.95 slugs. So the mass of the water is 1.95 - 0.10 = 1.85 slugs.

Wait, but slugs are a unit of mass, so 1 slug is equal to 32.174 lb mass. So the mass of the water in lb mass would be 1.85 * 32.174 ≈ 1.85 *32.174 = let me calculate: 1.85 *32 is 59.2, 1.85 *0.174 is about 0.322 → total approx 59.52 lb mass.

But wait, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The container's weight is 3.22 lb force. So, according to Newton's third law, force equals mass times g. So, m_empty = weight / g = 3.22 / 32.2 = 0.10 lb mass. That's correct.

The total mass when filled is 1.95 slugs. So the water mass is 1.95 - 0.10 = 1.85 slugs. So, the mass of the water is 1.85 slugs.

Wait, but the question is to find the weight of the water and the volume of the water. So, first, the weight of the water. Since weight is mass times g, the mass is 1.85 slugs, so weight_water = 1.85 * 32.2 ft/s². Let me compute that.

1.85 *32.2 = let's compute:

1.85 *30 = 55.5

1.85 *2.2 = approx 4.07 -> total is 59.57 lb force. Hmm, that's option C's first value. So, the weight of the water is about 59.57 lb force. That's option C's first value.

Now, for the volume of the water. The problem states that the density of water is 62.4 lb force/ft³. Wait, that's interesting because I thought density is mass/volume, but here it's given as weight/volume. So, perhaps in this context, density is expressed in pounds per cubic foot. Hmm.

Wait, density formula is ρ = mass/volume. So, if density is given as density = mass/volume, then in this problem, you can use it directly. So, if the density is 62.4 lb/ft³, and the mass of the water is 1.85 slugs, then the volume would be mass / density. But wait, mass is in slugs, and density is in lb/ft³. Are these compatible? Because mass is in lb·s²/ft, and density is mass/volume. Hmm, perhaps not directly. Alternatively, perhaps since the density is given as 62.4 lb/ft³, which is the same as 62.4 slugs/ft³, since 1 slug = 32.174 lb. Wait, no. Wait, 1 slug = 32.174 lb. So, if density is 62.4 lb/ft³, then to get density in slugs/ft³, we'd divide by 32.174, which would make it approximately 62.4 /32.174 ≈ 1.937 slugs/ft³.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think again. Since density is mass per volume, and in this problem, the density is given as 62.4 lb force per ft³. So, density in this case is the same as mass density because the units are in lb force. Or wait, perhaps not, since lb force is a unit of force, and slugs are mass. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, the question says density is 62.4 lb force/ft³. So, density (ρ) = mass / volume. So, mass = density * volume. But the units here are in lb force, which is force. So, wait, because density is in lb/ft³, which is a force per volume. Oh wait, no, that can't be, because density is mass/volume. So perhaps in this problem, the density is expressed as mass density because the unit is in force per cubic feet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the density is given as specific weight, which is mass per volume. Oh, wait, the problem states "density of water=62.4 lb force/ft³." Hmm, but density is mass/volume. So, maybe it's a specific weight, which is mass per volume multiplied by gravity. So, specific weight (γ) is mass density (ρ) * g. So, in this case, specific weight is 62.4 lb/ft³. So, if specific weight is 62.4, then mass density (ρ) would be 62.4 / g, where g is 32.2 ft/s². So, let's compute ρ = 62.4 /32.2 ≈ 1.937 slugs/ft³.

So, the mass of water is 1.85 slugs. So, the volume V = mass / density = 1.85 slugs / (1.937 slugs/ft³) ≈ 0.955 ft³. That's the volume of the water.

So, weight of water is 59.57 lb force, volume is 0.955 ft³. Looking at the options, option C is 59.57 lb force, 0.955 ft³. So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. The container weighs 3.22 lb force when empty.
2. When filled with water at 60°F, the total mass of the container and its contents is 1.95 slugs.
3. The density of water is given as 62.4 lb force per cubic foot.

### Step 1: Calculate the mass of the container and its contents
The mass of the container when empty is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Mass}_{\text{empty}} = \frac{\text{Weight}_{\text{empty}}}{g}
\]
where \( g = 32.2 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \). Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Mass}_{\text{empty}} = \frac{3.22}{32.2} \approx 0.10 \, \text{lb mass}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the mass of the water
The total mass of the container and its contents when filled is 1.95 slugs. Subtracting the mass of the empty container:
\[
\text{Mass}_{\text{water}} = 1.95 - 0.10 = 1.85 \, \text{slugs}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the weight of the water
The weight of the water is given by:
\[
\text{Weight}_{\text{water}} = \text{Mass}_{\text{water}} \times g = 1.85 \times 32.2 \approx 59.57 \, \text{lb force}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the volume of the water
The density of water is provided as 62.4 lb force per cubic foot. Since density is mass/volume, we can rearrange this to find volume:
\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{\text{Mass}_{\text{water}}}{\text{Density}} = \frac{1.85}{62.4/32.2} = \frac{1.85 \times 32.2}{62.4} \approx 0.955 \, \text{ft}^3.
\]

### Step 5: Match the results with the options
The calculated weight of the water is approximately 59.57 lb force, and the volume is approximately 0.955 ft³. This matches option C.
