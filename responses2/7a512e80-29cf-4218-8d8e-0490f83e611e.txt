Question:

On May 2, a woman mailed the following letter to a man:"May 1I have two tickets to the concert on July 1 at the auditorium in town. I'll sell them to you for $60 per ticket, which is $10 above face value. Since the concert has been sold out for months, I think that is a good deal. You have 15 days from the above date to decide whether to accept this offer. "The man received the letter on May 4, but did not read it until May 6. On May 18, the man went to the woman's home and attempted to accept the offer. The woman replied:"Too late! I sold the tickets last week for $75 each. "Assume that the woman's letter created in the man a valid power of acceptance. Was that power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17?

Options:

A: Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.
B: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.
C: No, because the man received the letter on May 4.
D: No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the woman's power of acceptance was terminated due to the man not reading the letter until May 6. Let me think through this step by step.

The scenario is about a letter being sent. The woman sent the letter on May 2. The man received it on May 4 but didn't read it until May 6. He tried to accept the offer on May 18 but the woman said it's too late. The woman responded with the timing of her sales: she sold each ticket for $75, which is $10 above face value — so that's a $25 profit per ticket, I guess. So she made a profit, which is good for her.

The question is about the power of acceptance. The power of acceptance is the legal right of a recipient to accept a letter sent by a solicitor or agent for the payment of a fee. It typically requires that the recipient has not yet had the opportunity to accept the offer, or that the offer is not accepted because the solicitor has already made a profit, which is a valid right.

So the key points here are: the letter was sent, the man didn't read it until a certain date, and then the woman replied that the offer was too late because she made a profit. 

I remember that the power of acceptance has a time element. It's generally considered that the solicitor has a one-year (or more) window to act. If the solicitor is in a business of making money, then the power of acceptance might be terminated early. But also, the solicitor must act promptly and within the right time frame.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact time. I think the time is generally more than a year, but if the solicitor is making money, it's supposed to be not more than a year. So if the solicitor is in a position where they can make a profit, the time to accept might be limited.

So, in this case, the woman made a profit. So the solicitor didn't act promptly. So, in May 2, she sent the letter. The man didn't read it until May 6. Then he tried to accept on May 17. When he tried, the woman replied too late because she had already made a profit.

So the question is, was the power of acceptance terminated because the man didn't read the letter until May 6, but the woman's reply was that it was too late — but the man didn't read it. But the question is about whether the power of acceptance was terminated by the lapse of time before the man went home on May 17.

Wait, the question is phrased as: The woman's letter created a valid power of acceptance. Was that power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17?

So the man didn't read the letter until May 6, but then on May 18, he tried to accept. The woman replied it was too late, but the man didn't read until May 6. So the timing of the reading matters.

Wait, but the power of acceptance is a time-sensitive thing. The rule is that the solicitor must act within a reasonable time after the letter is sent. But if the solicitor is in a position of making profit, the time may be limited.

So, when did the solicitor have the power of acceptance? She sent it on May 2. The man didn't read until May 6. Then he tried May 17.

But the woman's reply was that it was too late, so the solicitor had to act within a reasonable time. But without knowing the exact time limit, it's tricky.

Wait, but the man didn't read the letter until May 6, but the woman's reply was that it was too late. So the man didn't read it until a certain time after the letter was sent. But is that relevant to the power of acceptance?

Ah, I think the key point is that the power of acceptance is created upon sending the letter. The timing of when the recipient reads it (how long after the letter is received) affects whether the solicitor can act within a reasonable time.

So the woman's power of acceptance was created on May 2. The man didn't read the letter until May 6. So, the time between May 2 and May 6 is 4 days. Is that considered a time that's too long for the solicitor to act?

Wait, not exactly. The time for the solicitor to act is usually more than a year, unless they are in a position of making profit. If the solicitor made a profit, she would have a reasonable time limit, perhaps a month or two.

But the man didn't read until May 6, which is 4 days after the letter was sent. That's not long enough, perhaps. But the woman made a profit as a result. So the time the solicitor had to act was reduced.

So, the man didn't read the letter until May 6. The woman's reply was that it was too late. But the question is about the power of acceptance being terminated because of the time lapse before he went home.

Wait, the question is whether the power of acceptance was terminated due to the man not reading the letter until May 6. But the woman's reply was that it was too late. So, the man didn't read the letter until a certain time after the letter was sent.

But the power of acceptance is based on the time between the letter being sent and the solicitor acting. If the solicitor can act within a reasonable time after the letter is sent, then the power is valid. Otherwise, it's terminated.

In this case, the man didn't read the letter until May 6. So, from May 2 (the letter's sending date) to May 6 (when he read it), that's 4 days. So, the time between sending and reading was 4 days. But is that time sufficient? Because the solicitor can act within a time frame, perhaps more than a day.

But the woman's reply was that the offer was too late. So the solicitor had to act after May 6? Or would the solicitor still have a reasonable time to act?

Wait, the law says that the solicitor must act within a reasonable time after the letter is delivered. So, if the letter is sent on May 2, the solicitor must act by May 13 (if a reasonable time is, say, 13 days). But if the solicitor made a profit, she might have a more limited time, perhaps 10 days.

But the man didn't read until May 6. So, within a reasonable time, the solicitor would have had time to act. So, the power of acceptance was not terminated because the man read it before the solicitor could act within the time limit.

But wait, the woman's reply was that it was too late. So, the solicitor didn't act before May 17. But the man didn't read until May 6. So, the time between the letter being sent and the solicitor acting could have been less than the required time, but the man didn't read the letter until May 6.

But the question is if the power of acceptance was terminated because of the time lapse before the man went home on May 17. So, the key point is: was the power of acceptance terminated because the man didn't read the letter until May 6?

Alternatively, the woman's reply was that it was too late, but the man didn't read until a later date. So, the power was not terminated — because the man didn't read it until a later date, but the solicitor had time to act.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about this again.

The woman created the power of acceptance when she sent the letter on May 2. The man didn't read until May 6. So the time between May 6 and the solicitor acting (May 17) is 11 days. Wait, but the solicitor's right is to act within a reasonable time, say 13 days after the letter was delivered. So, if the man didn't read until May 6, then the solicitor could act by May 19 or so. But the man didn't read until May 6, then he tried to accept on May 17, which is within the time frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the power of acceptance was not terminated because the man read it before the solicitor could act. So, the power was not terminated until the solicitor acted.

Wait, but the question is whether the power was terminated by the lapse of time before the man went home on May 17. The man didn't read the letter until May 6, but the woman's reply was that it was too late. So, the man didn't read until May 6, but the solicitor still acted after that. So, the power wasn't terminated because the man didn't read until a later time. He didn't actually read until May 6, which is earlier than May 17. So, the time lapse (from May 2 to May 6) is 4 days. That's less than the required time. But the solicitor's time was more than a day.

Wait, but the man didn't read until May 6, but the woman's reply was that it was too late on May 17. So, the man didn't read until a day later.

But the power of acceptance was created when the letter was sent. The time between the letter and the solicitor acting could be limited if the solicitor made a profit.

So, perhaps the power was not terminated because the man didn't read until May 6, but the solicitor had time to act as the letter was sent on May 2.

Wait, but the key point about the power of acceptance is that it's created when the letter is delivered, and it's valid as long as the recipient reads it before the solicitor can act within a reasonable time. So, if the solicitor makes a profit, the time is limited — say, 13 days after the letter is delivered.

So, the letter was sent on May 2. The man didn't read until May 6. So, 4 days. If the solicitor can act within 13 days, then 4 days is well within the 13-day limit. So, the man didn't read the letter until May 6, and the solicitor could have acted by then. So, the power wasn't terminated.

But the man tried to accept on May 17, which is well beyond the 13-day limit if the solicitor makes a profit.

Wait, but the woman replied that it was too late. So, the solicitor had to act after May 6. So, the power wasn't terminated because the man didn't read the letter until a later date (May 6) but the solicitor could act after that.

Wait, but the question is about whether the power was terminated because of the time lapse before the man went home on May 17. So, the man didn't read the letter until May 6. So, the time from when he read it to when he tried to accept was May 6 to May 17, which is 11 days. Is that a time lapse that terminated the power?

Wait, the power of acceptance is based on the time between the letter being delivered and the solicitor acting. If the solicitor can act within a reasonable time after the letter is delivered, then the power is valid. Otherwise, it's terminated.

In this case, the man didn't read the letter until May 6. So, from May 2 (the letter's delivery date) to May 6 (when he read it), that's 4 days. So, the time lapse is 4 days — which is less than the 13-day time limit if the solicitor is in a position to make a profit.

But the man didn't read until May 6, but the woman's reply was that it's too late. So, the solicitor didn't act until after May 6. So, the time lapse from May 6 to May 17 is 11 days. But the solicitor's time was limited. So, the power wasn't terminated because the man read the letter before the solicitor could act.

Wait, but the man didn't read the letter until May 6. So, the time between May 2 (letter delivery) and May 6 (when he read it) is 4 days. So, if the solicitor's time limit is 13 days, then 4 days is within the time.

But the woman said it was too late, so the solicitor had to act after May 6. So, the man didn't read until after the time lapse had passed. So, he didn't read until a later time, meaning that the solicitor could act after that.

So, the power wasn't terminated because the man didn't read until a later date than the time limit. So, the correct answer would be that the power wasn't terminated because the man didn't read until a later date but the solicitor still had time.

Wait, but the question is whether the power was terminated due to the time lapse before he went home on May 17. So, the man didn't read until May 6. That's a 4-day lapse. So, the time until the solicitor would act is May 13 (if 13-day time allowed) or May 19 (if the 13-day time was reduced to 10 days because she made a profit).

The man didn't read until May 6, but the woman replied it was too late on May 17, so the solicitor had to act after May 6. So, if the solicitor only had a 10-day time, then May 6 plus 10 days is May 16. So, the man tried to accept on May 17, which is beyond the time. So, the power wasn't terminated because the man didn't read until a later time.

Wait, but the woman's reply was that it was too late, so the solicitor couldn't act before May 17. So, the man didn't read until a later time, but the solicitor still had time. So, the power wasn't terminated because the man didn't read until a later date, but the solicitor could act.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.

B: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.

C: No, because the man received the letter on May 4.

D: No, because the man didn't read the letter until May 6.

I think the correct answer is D: No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6. Because he didn't read until a later date, but the time lapse is 4 days, which is within the 13-day limit if the solicitor made a profit.

So, the power wasn't terminated because the man read the letter after the time lapse.

Wait, no, the power is not terminated until the solicitor acts. So, if the man didn't read until May 6, but the solicitor still acted after that, then the power wasn't terminated because the man didn't read until a later date.

Wait, but the power is created when the letter is sent. The time lapse is the time from when the letter is delivered to when the solicitor acts. If the solicitor made a profit, the time is limited. So, if the man read until May 6, then the solicitor could act on May 13 or so. But the man didn't read until May 6, so the solicitor still could act after that. So, the power wasn't terminated because he didn't read until a later date.

So, the answer would be D: No, because he didn't read the letter until May 6.

Wait, but the man read it on May 4 or 6? The question says he tried to accept on May 17, but he didn't read until May 6. So, the time between May 2 and May 6 is 4 days. If the solicitor's time is 13 days, then he can act by May 15. So, the man didn't read until May 6, which is before the time lapse of 13 days. So, the man didn't read until a time when the solicitor could act, so the power wasn't terminated.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the power is created when the letter is delivered. The time lapse is from the letter's delivery to the time when the solicitor acts. So, if the solicitor made a profit, the time is limited.

In this case, the letter was delivered on May 2. The man read it on May 6. So, 4 days between delivery and reading. If the solicitor's time is limited (e.g., 13 days), then 4 days is within that. So, the power is still valid.

The woman's reply about it being too late (on May 17) indicates that the solicitor can't act before that. So, the time between May 6 and May 17 is 11 days. If the solicitor's time was 13 days, he could act by May 15.

So, the man didn't read until May 6, then tried to accept on May 17. Since the solicitor didn't act until May 17, but the man didn't read until then, the power wasn't terminated as the man didn't read until the time lapse had passed.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the man didn't read the letter until May 6, but the woman's reply was that it's too late. So, the solicitor had to act after May 6. So, the time lapse of 11 days was beyond the 13-day limit for a profit.

But the question is whether the power was terminated because of the time lapse before the man went home on May 17.

So, the man didn't read until May 6. The time between May 2 and May 6 is 4 days. If the solicitor's time was 13 days, then 4 days is within the time. So, the man didn't read until a time when the solicitor could act, but as the man didn't read until the time lapse had passed, the power wasn't terminated.

Wait, but the woman's reply was that it's too late, so the solicitor couldn't act before May 17. So, the man read the letter on May 6, which is before the time lapse of 11 days. So, the power wasn't terminated because the man read the letter before the solicitor could act.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option B says Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.

But the letter was delivered on May 2, so the date of the letter doesn't matter beyond that. So, the correct answer is D: No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6.

Because if he read it earlier, the time lapse would have been less, possibly within the time limit.

Wait, no, the letter was delivered on May 2. The man read it on May 6, which is a 4-day lapse. If the solicitor's time is 13 days, then 4 days is within that. So, the power wasn't terminated because the man didn't read until a time when the solicitor could act.

But the option D says: No, because the man did not read until May 6.

Wait, that's correct. So, the correct answer is D.
</think>

The letter was delivered on May 2, and the man read it on May 6. If the solicitor made a profit, the time limit for acting would be reduced (e.g., 13 days). The 4-day lapse within this limit means the power of acceptance was not terminated. The man's delay in reading did not extend the time lapse beyond the time limit, so the power of acceptance was not terminated. The correct answer is:

D: No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6.
