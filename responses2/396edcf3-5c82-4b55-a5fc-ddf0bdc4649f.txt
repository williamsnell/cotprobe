Question:

Self-efficacy (the belief that one has control over one's situation) as it related to job satisfaction was studied. When a group of teachers rated their ability to control their situation and their satisfaction with their job, the two variables had a correlation of 0.30. Which statement follows from this correlation?

Options:

A: Teachers in the study who were more satisfied with their job were less confident in their ability to control their situation.
B: There is a negative correlation between job satisfaction and self-efficacy.
C: The correlation implies that job satisfaction causes increased self-efficacy.
D: The correlation of 0.30 indicates that there is no relationship between self-efficacy and job satisfaction.
E: If you want teachers to be happy with their job, give them more control over their situation.
F: Teachers who were less satisfied with their job had more confidence in their ability to control their situation.
G: The correlation implies that self-efficacy causes increased job satisfaction.
H: If you want teachers to take more control over their situation, make them happier at their jobs.
I: 30% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.
J: 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.

Okay, so I have this correlation question here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about self-efficacy and job satisfaction among teachers. They found a correlation of 0.30. Hmm. Correlation ranges from -1 to 1, right? So a positive value is positive correlation, and a negative value is negative. A correlation of 0.30 is a moderate positive correlation. So that means as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well, but not perfectly.

The question is asking which statement follows from this correlation. There are a bunch of options from A to J. Let me go through each one step by step.

Option A: Teachers who were more satisfied with their job were less confident in their ability to control their situation. So if job satisfaction is higher, self-efficacy would be lower? Wait, no, because the correlation is positive. So if job satisfaction increases, self-efficacy (the ability to control) increases too. So if job satisfaction is higher, self-efficacy would be higher. So A says the opposite. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Negative correlation. Well, 0.30 is positive, not negative. So B is wrong.

Option C: The correlation implies that job satisfaction causes increased self-efficacy. Correlation doesn't imply causation. Just because two variables are correlated doesn't mean one causes the other. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: The correlation of 0.30 indicates no relationship. Well, a correlation doesn't mean zero. A low correlation (like 0.3) doesn't necessarily mean no relationship; it just means the relationship is weak. So D is incorrect.

Option E: If you want teachers to be happy with their job, give them more control over their situation. Wait, the statement says more control. So in this scenario, more control would mean higher self-efficacy. But the correlation is positive. So more control leads to higher self-efficacy. So giving more control is linked to higher self-efficacy. So E is talking about the effect of more control on job satisfaction. Hmm. Wait, but the question says that the two variables (self-efficacy and job satisfaction) have a correlation of 0.30. So maybe E is making a statement about one being a cause of the other. But the question doesn't state that control causes job satisfaction. It's just a correlation. So the statement E is making a cause-effect claim based on correlation, which isn't valid. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Teachers who were less satisfied with their job had more confidence in their ability to control their situation. Wait, if they are less satisfied, their self-efficacy (ability to control) would be lower. So if job satisfaction is lower, self-efficacy would be lower too. So this F is saying that lower job satisfaction leads to higher self-efficacy, which is the opposite of the positive correlation. So F is incorrect.

Option G: The correlation implies that self-efficacy causes increased job satisfaction. Again, correlation doesn't mean causation. So G is incorrect.

Option H: If you want teachers to take more control over their situation, make them happier at their jobs. Wait, but the correlation is positive between self-efficacy and job satisfaction. So more self-efficacy (more control) would lead to higher job satisfaction. So making them more self-efficacious (i.e., taking more control) would result in being happier. So H is saying that more control causes higher job satisfaction, which is what the correlation suggests. So H is correct.

Option I: 30% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model. That's about the coefficient of determination, R squared. Since the correlation is 0.30, R squared is 0.09. So that would mean only 9% of the variability is explained. So I is incorrect because it says 30% is explained, which is wrong.

Option J: 9% of the variability explained. That's the same as option I, so J is wrong.

Now, looking back at the options, the correct statement is option H. Because the correlation of 0.30 suggests that more self-efficacy (which is more control) is associated with higher job satisfaction. So giving H is a cause-effect statement based on correlation, which isn't a valid inference. Oh wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait a minute, option H says "If you want teachers to take more control over their situation, make them happier at their jobs." That's the opposite of what the correlation suggests. Because higher self-efficacy (more control) leads to higher job satisfaction. So making them more self-efficacious (more control) would make them happier. So the statement in H says "make them happier at their jobs," which is what you'd expect if they have more control.

Wait, but let me check the wording of option H again: "If you want teachers to take more control over their situation, make them happier at their jobs." So yes, if they have more control, they are happier. So H is a correct statement.

So the correct answer is H.
</think>

The correct answer is H. The correlation of 0.30 indicates a moderate positive relationship between self-efficacy and job satisfaction. This means that as self-efficacy increases, job satisfaction also tends to increase, and vice versa. 

Option H states that if teachers want to take more control over their situations, they would be happier at their jobs. This aligns with the correlation, as increased self-efficacy (more control) is associated with higher job satisfaction.

ANSWER: H
