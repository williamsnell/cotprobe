Okay, I'm trying to figure out how many states in the international system have nuclear weapons. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I know the United States has a nuclear weapons capacity, right? They have a nuclear arsenal, so the US would probably be included. I've heard that the US is a major nuclear power. 

Now, looking at the other states, I'm trying to remember if any others are known to have nuclear capabilities. I remember that China has a nuclear power plant, but I'm not sure if it's considered as having a nuclear weapon. Some sources say China has a nuclear reactor, but I think in international discussions, it's more about having a capability than having a weapon. So maybe China isn't counted as having a nuclear weapon here.

What about the Russian Federation? They have a nuclear battery, but again, that's a question of whether they're considered as having a nuclear weapon. I think in international terms, Russia is counted as having a nuclear capability, but not as a nuclear weapon.

Looking at China, I recall that the crosstabs in the UN classify Chinese nuclear capabilities, but they might not have actual nuclear weapons. So probably not included.

Now, the other states: Are there any other countries known for having nuclear capabilities? I'm trying to think. I don't think any other states besides the US and China are known to have nuclear weapons. Wait, but I'm not certain about Russia. Some sources might say Russia has a nuclear capability, but others might not. Hmm, I need to get this right.

Wait, the question is about nuclear weapons rights, not actual nuclear weapons. So if a country has a nuclear capability, it's included. So for Russia, if they have a nuclear battery, that's a capability, so they should be included. But I think in some contexts, like UN classification, it's not clear if they're considered as having a nuclear weapon. So perhaps the answer is US and Russia.

Wait, but I'm not sure about China. Do they have a nuclear weapon? I think the Chinese government has a research facility, but I'm not certain if that qualifies as a nuclear weapon. So maybe China is not counted.

So, US and Russia are the only two countries I can think of that have nuclear capabilities. That would be 2 out of 50, which is between 16 and 25. So option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other countries? I think not. The US and China are the only ones I can think of. So the answer is between 16 and 25, which is option B.

The correct answer is B: Between 16 and 25. This is because the US and China are the only countries known for having nuclear capabilities, totaling 2 states, which falls within the range of 16 to 25.

Answer: B
