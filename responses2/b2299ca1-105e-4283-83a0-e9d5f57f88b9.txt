The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A person who has had an opportunity to contribute to the establishmentof objectives regarding his or her performance willhave a greater degree of commitment and motivation in attemptingto achieve those objectives. State and discuss thetheory underlying this statement. How is itimplemented practicallyto motivate employees ?

Options:

A: The theory is the Hierarchy of Needs by Maslow, and it is implemented by providing employees with a path for career progression and fulfilling higher-level needs.
B: The theory is implemented through punishments and rewards
C: The theory is known as the Two-Factor Theory by Herzberg, which is applied by addressing hygiene factors and providing intrinsic motivators such as recognition and achievement.
D: The theory is implemented through increasing employee's workload
E: The theory is implemented through strict supervision
F: The theory is known as the Equity Theory, which is put into practice by ensuring fair treatment of employees and balancing input and output ratios among workers.
G: The theory is the Self-Determination Theory, which is implemented by promoting autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the workplace.
H: The theory is the Social Learning Theory, and it is put into practice by using role models and mentors to demonstrate desirable behaviors and outcomes.
I: The theory underlying this statement is Management by Objectives (MBO), which involves mutual goal-setting between employees and management. It is practically implemented through programs such as job simplification, job enrichment, suggestion plans, and job redesign.
J: The theory is based on the Expectancy Theory of motivation, implemented through clear communication of performance criteria and linking outcomes directly to performance.

Okay, so I have to answer this multiple-choice question about motivation theories. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about why someone who has contributed to setting performance objectives will have a greater commitment and motivation to achieve those objectives. The options are A to J, each giving a different theory and its practical implementation.

First, I need to recall the theories mentioned. The theories related to motivation often include Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory, Self-Determination Theory, Equity Theory, and Expectancy Theory.

The question states that a person who contributes to setting performance objectives will have greater commitment. So the underlying theory must be one that explains how setting objectives leads to higher motivation.

Looking at the options:

Option I says the theory is Management by Objectives (MBO) and it's implemented through setting goals, simplifying jobs, enriching, suggesting plans, and redesigning. MBO is a management philosophy where managers set clear goals and distribute them, with employees contributing to achieving them. That seems relevant because if someone contributes to objectives, it's part of the management system that fosters commitment.

Option J says it's based on Expectancy Theory and implemented through clear performance criteria and linking outcomes directly to performance. Expectancy Theory focuses on the expectation that one can influence the outcome. If someone sets objectives, they are setting the expectations of the outcomes, which is part of the theory.

Option C mentions Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory. He has two factors: hygiene factors (like salary and work environment) and motivators (like recognition and work-life balance). But the question is about commitment and motivation to achieve objectives, which might be more about intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation.

Option A is about Maslow's hierarchy. He's more about needing hierarchy, like basic needs first. If you set objectives, you're addressing higher needs, which might be part of the theory, but I'm not sure if this directly explains commitment.

Option D is Equity Theory, which focuses on fairness and sharing of gains, but I'm not sure how that ties to motivation for setting objectives.

Option F is about equity theory, but the option says the theory is Equity Theory, which is implemented through fair treatment and balancing input and output. I think Equity Theory is about fairness, but maybe not directly the motivation aspect.

Option G is Self-Determination Theory, which emphasizes autonomy, competence, and relatedness. That's about the employee's sense of self, but the question is about setting objectives, so maybe more about intrinsic motivation.

Option E is Social Learning Theory, focusing on models of behavior being observed through observation and modeling. Not sure how that ties into setting objectives.

Option B is about rewards and punishments, but that's more about psychological aspects, but the question is about how the theory is implemented to motivate employees.

Option C: Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory. The theory says that motivation comes from two factors: hygiene factors that make the job easy (like good working conditions, safe environment) and motivators that make it interesting or rewarding (like recognition, progress, etc.). Herzberg's theory is about why people choose to work and their satisfaction. If a person contributes to setting objectives, maybe through providing a good work environment, they might be motivated. But the question is about the underlying theory. So perhaps the theory is that when you contribute to setting objectives, you're aligning with the company's goals, which are driven by factors from the theory.

Wait, the question states that the person's contribution leads to greater commitment and motivation. So the underlying theory is the one that explains why this happens. So which theory explains that contributing to objectives leads to higher motivation and commitment.

Looking again, the main theories that explain motivation are Hierarchy of Needs, Two-Factor Theory, Self-Determination Theory, Expectancy Theory, etc.

The statement says that the person, who has contributed to setting objectives, will have greater commitment and motivation. So what theory would explain this?

Option I: Management by Objectives (MBO) is a management model where managers set goals and employees contribute toward achieving them. This aligns with the idea that contributing to objectives leads to more commitment.

Option J: Expectancy Theory talks about people's expectations influencing their behavior. If objectives are set, the person's expectation (performance) is tied to the outcome, so they might be more motivated.

Option E: Social Learning Theory isn't directly about setting objectives but about observing and imitating others.

Option C: Two-Factor Theory, which Herzberg's is, doesn't explain commitment directly, more about the factors.

Option I and J both relate to theories that explain motivation in different ways.

The question is asking which theory explains why contributing to objectives leads to higher commitment and motivation.

From what I remember, the Hierarchy of Needs (Maslow) says that to reach higher needs, you must satisfy lower ones. Setting goals aligns with the goal-setting theory, which is part of management systems. But the question is about the theory underlying the statement.

Wait, the question is about the theory that explains why commitment and motivation increase when objectives are set. The options are about the theory and how it's implemented.

So which theory is it?

The theory that explains how setting objectives leads to higher motivation is the Higher Order Motives theory, but the options don't include that.

Wait, the options are:

A: Hierarchy of Needs, job progression.

I: MBO, job simplification, etc.

J: Expectancy, performance criteria.

Now, I think the correct theory is the MBO theory. Because when you set objectives, you are creating a commitment system. So the underlying theory is MBO, and it's implemented by creating a system where employees contribute to achieving those objectives.

So the answer would be I, which says the theory is MBO and it's implemented through setting goals, simplifying, etc.

Alternatively, if the theory is Expectancy Theory (option J), it's about the expectation of success leading to performance. But the question is about commitment and motivation to achieve objectives, which is more about the employee setting the goal, which is under management by objectives.

So the correct answer is I: the theory is MBO, implemented by setting goals, job simplification, etc.
</think>

The question asks about the theory underlying the statement that contributing to performance objectives increases commitment and motivation, and how it is implemented. The correct answer is determined by analyzing the theories and their implementations.

The theory that explains how setting objectives leads to higher motivation is the Management by Objectives (MBO) theory. MBO involves creating a system where managers set clear goals, and employees contribute toward achieving them. This aligns with the idea that setting objectives fosters commitment and motivation.
