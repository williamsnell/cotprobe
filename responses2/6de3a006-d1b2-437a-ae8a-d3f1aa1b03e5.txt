Okay, so I have this problem here: 888x + 889y = 890 and 891x + 892y = 893. I need to find x - y. Hmm, let's see. I think I should solve for x and y first and then subtract them. But maybe there's a smarter way without having to solve the entire system.

Wait, maybe I can subtract the two equations to simplify. Let me write them down:

Equation 1: 888x + 889y = 890  
Equation 2: 891x + 892y = 893  

If I subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2, I get:

(891x - 888x) + (892y - 889y) = 893 - 890  
Which simplifies to:  
3x + 3y = 3  

Oh, that's a good step. So 3x + 3y = 3. I can factor out a 3: 3(x + y) = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives x + y = 1. Okay, that's a simpler equation.

Now, I have two equations:
1. 888x + 889y = 890  
2. x + y = 1  

Maybe I can use substitution. From equation 2, x = 1 - y. Let me plug that into equation 1.

So, 888(1 - y) + 889y = 890  
Expanding that: 888 - 888y + 889y = 890  
Combine like terms: (-888y + 889y) is y, so 888 + y = 890  
Subtract 888 from both sides: y = 2.

Wait, if y is 2, then from x + y =1, x = 1 - 2 = -1.

So x is -1, y is 2. Therefore, x - y is (-1) - 2 = -3. That's option E.

Alternatively, maybe I could have added the equations instead. Let me check:

Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2:
(888x + 891x) + (889y + 892y) = 890 + 893  
Which gives: 1779x + 1781y = 1783.

Hmm, but that seems more complicated. Maybe my initial approach was better.

Wait, another way: Let me see if I can express the two equations in terms of (x + y) and (x - y). Let me define S = x + y and D = x - y. Then, we can write x = (S + D)/2 and y = (S - D)/2.

Substituting into the first equation:  
888*( (S + D)/2 ) + 889*( (S - D)/2 ) = 890  
Simplify: [888(S + D) + 889(S - D)] / 2 = 890  
Multiply both sides by 2: 888(S + D) + 889(S - D) = 1780  
Expanding: (888S + 888D) + (889S - 889D) = 1780  
Combine like terms: (888S + 889S) + (888D - 889D) = 1780  
So, 1777S - D = 1780.

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Let's see the second equation:

891x + 892y = 893  
Substitute x and y:  
891*( (S + D)/2 ) + 892*( (S - D)/2 ) = 893  
Multiply by 2: [891(S + D) + 892(S - D)] = 1786  
Expanding: 891S + 891D + 892S - 892D = 1786  
Combine terms: (891S + 892S) + (891D - 892D) = 1786  
So, 1783S - D = 1786.

Now I have two equations:
1777S - D = 1780  
1783S - D = 1786  

Subtracting the first from the second equation: (1783S - D) - (1777S - D) = 1786 - 1780  
Which is: 6S = 6 → S = 1.

So S = x + y = 1, which matches what I found earlier. Now plug back into one of the equations to find D.

From 1777S - D = 1780: 1777*1 - D =1780 → 1777 - D = 1780 → -D = 3 → D = -3.

So D = x - y = -3, which would be option E. That matches my initial calculation. So the answer is E.

The solution involves subtracting the two given equations to find a simpler relationship between x and y, then using substitution to solve for x and y. The difference x - y is found to be -3.
