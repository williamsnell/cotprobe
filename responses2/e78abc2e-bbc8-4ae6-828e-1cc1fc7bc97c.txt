Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem here. Let me read it again and think through it step by step. The question is asking for the value of N that satisfies the equation (4^(3^3)) divided by ((4^3)^3) equals 2^N. The options are A through J, with various numbers.

First, I need to simplify the left side of the equation to express it as a power of 2, because the right side is 2^N. That should help me find the value of N.

Let's break it down. The numerator is 4 raised to the power of 3^3. Wait, 3^3 is 27 because 3 multiplied by itself three times is 27. So the numerator is 4^27.

The denominator is (4^3)^3. I remember that when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So (4^3)^3 is 4^(3*3) which is 4^9.

So now the equation becomes (4^27) / (4^9) = 2^N. 

I know that when you divide like bases with exponents, you subtract the exponents. So 4^27 divided by 4^9 is 4^(27-9) = 4^18. 

So now I have 4^18 = 2^N. But 4 is 2 squared. So I can rewrite 4^18 as (2^2)^18. 

When you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents again. (2^2)^18 is 2^(2*18) = 2^36.

So now I have 2^36 = 2^N. Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. So N must be 36.

Looking at the options, option C is 36. So that's the answer.

The equation simplifies as follows:

- Numerator: \(4^{3^3} = 4^{27}\)
- Denominator: \((4^3)^3 = 4^9\)
- Simplify the division: \(4^{27} / 4^9 = 4^{18}\)
- Express in base 2: \(4^{18} = (2^2)^{18} = 2^{36}\)
- Therefore, \(2^{36} = 2^N\) implies \(N = 36\).

Answer: C
