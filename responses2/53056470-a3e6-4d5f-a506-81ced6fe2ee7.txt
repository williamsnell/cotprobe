Okay, so I've got this problem here about sets and their subsets. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that X is a finite set, and the number of subsets with exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets with exactly 2 elements. I need to find how many subsets contain exactly 4 elements, and the options are given from A to J.

Hmm, subsets of a set X. I remember that the number of subsets of a set with n elements is 2^n. But wait, that's all subsets, including the empty set and the set itself. But here, we're only dealing with subsets of size 2 and 3.

So, the number of subsets with exactly k elements is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). So for k=2, it's C(n, 2), and for k=3, it's C(n, 3).

The problem says that C(n, 3) is 14 more than C(n, 2). So, mathematically, that's:

C(n, 3) = C(n, 2) + 14.

Let me write that out:

n! / (3! (n - 3)!) = n! / (2! (n - 2)!) + 14.

Hmm, maybe I can simplify this equation. Let me compute the left and right sides.

First, let's compute C(n,3) and C(n,2):

C(n,3) = n(n-1)(n-2)/6.

C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2.

So, substituting into the equation:

n(n-1)(n-2)/6 = n(n-1)/2 + 14.

Let me multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the denominators:

n(n-1)(n-2) = 3 * n(n-1) + 84.

Expanding the left side:

n(n-1)(n-2) = n^3 - 3n^2 + 2n.

The right side is:

3n(n - 1) = 3n^2 - 3n.

So, the equation becomes:

n^3 - 3n^2 + 2n = 3n^2 - 3n + 84.

Now, let's bring all terms to one side:

n^3 - 3n^2 + 2n - 3n^2 +3n -84 = 0.

Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Let me subtract the right side from both sides:

n^3 -3n^2 +2n - (3n^2 -3n) -84 = 0.

Which is:

n^3 -3n^2 +2n -3n^2 +3n -84 = 0.

Combine like terms:

n^3 -6n^2 +5n -84 = 0.

So, the equation is:

n^3 -6n^2 +5n -84 = 0.

Hmm, I need to solve this cubic equation. Maybe I can try to factor it or find integer roots.

Let me try possible integer factors. The possible rational roots are factors of 84 divided by factors of 1 (since leading coefficient is 1). So possible roots: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±7, ±12, ±14, etc.

Let me test n=3:

3^3 -6*3^2 +5*3 -84 = 27 -54 +15 -84 = (27+15) -54 -84 = 42 -54 -84 = -96. Not zero.

n=4:

64 - 6*16 +20 -84 = 64 -96 +20 -84. Let's compute step by step:

64-96= -32; -32 +20= -12; -12 -84= -96. Not zero.

n=6:

216 -6*36 +30 -84 = 216 -216 +30 -84 = 0 +30 -84= -54. Not zero.

n=7:

343 -6*49 +35 -84 = 343 -294 +35 -84.

Compute 343-294=49; 49 +35=84; 84 -84=0. Oh! n=7 is a root.

So, (n -7) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Divide n^3 -6n^2 +5n -84 by (n -7).

Using synthetic division:

7 | 1  -6  5  -84

Bring down 1.

1

Multiply by 7: 7. Add to -6: 1.

Multiply by 7: 7. Add to 5:12.

Multiply by7:84. Add to -84: 0.

So, the polynomial factors as (n-7)(n^2 +n +12) = 0.

Now, set each factor to zero:

n-7=0 =>n=7.

n^2 +n +12=0. The discriminant is 1 -48= -47 <0, so no real roots.

Thus, the only real solution is n=7.

So, the set X has 7 elements.

Now, the question is, how many subsets contain exactly 4 elements.

That's C(7,4). Let me compute that.

C(7,4)= 7!/(4!3!) = (7×6×5)/(3×2×1)= 35.

Wait, but checking the options, E is 25, D is 40, etc. Wait, 35 is not in the options. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.

Wait, let me check my steps again.

The equation is C(n,3) = C(n,2) +14.

Which is (n^3 -3n^2 +2n)/6 = (n^2 -n)/2 +14.

Multiply both sides by 6:

n^3 -3n^2 +2n = 3(n^2 -n) +84.

Wait, that's 3n^2 -3n +84.

So, n^3 -3n^2 +2n -3n^2 +3n -84 =0: that's n^3 -6n^2 +5n -84=0.

Which factors as (n-7)(n^2 +n +12)=0.

So n=7 is correct.

But then C(7,4) is 35, which isn't among the options. Hmm.

Wait the options are:

A:36, B:24, C:28, D:40, E:25, F:42, G:33, H:30, I:32, J:35.

35 is option J. So unless I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated n^3 -6n^2 +5n -84 at n=7.

Wait, let me compute it again:

7^3 is 343, 6*7^2 is 6*49=294, 5*7=35.

So 343 -294 is 49, plus 35 is 84. 84 -84=0. Correct.

So n=7 is correct. Then C(7,4)=35, which is option J. But the options don't have 35 as the correct answer because the options are A through J, and looking back, yes: J is 35.

Wait, but wait, the problem says subsets that contain exactly 4 elements. So C(7,4)=35, so the answer should be J:35.

But wait, the options are given, but in the problem statement, the options are A to J, and J is 35, which is correct. So the answer should be J.

But wait, looking back at the options, I see J is 35. So I think I should select J.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 35 is the correct answer, which is option J. So that must be the case.

The problem requires finding the number of 4-element subsets of a finite set X, given that the number of 3-element subsets exceeds the number of 2-element subsets by 14. By solving the cubic equation derived from the given condition, we find that the set X has 7 elements. The number of 4-element subsets of a 7-element set is calculated as C(7,4) = 35, which corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
