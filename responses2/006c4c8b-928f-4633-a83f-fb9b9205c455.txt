Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the percentage that the selling price of a piano is of its cost. Let me think through this step by step.

The cost of the piano is $18,000, and the selling price is $22,950. I remember that to find what percentage one number is of another, you use the formula: (part / whole) * 100%. In this case, the "part" is the selling price, and the "whole" is the cost.

So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (22,950 / 18,000) * 100%. Let me calculate that. First, I'll do the division: 22,950 divided by 18,000. Hmm, let me see. 18,000 goes into 22,950 about once because 18,000 times 1 is 18,000, and subtracting that from 22,950 leaves 4,950. Then, 18,000 goes into 4,950 about 0.275 times because 18,000 times 0.275 is 4,950. So adding those together, that's approximately 1.275.

Now, multiplying by 100% gives me 127.5%. Looking at the options, option B is 127.5%, so that must be the answer. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. Alternatively, I could have converted the fraction to a decimal first, but the way I did it seems right.

The selling price is $22,950 and the cost is $18,000. To find the percentage, we calculate (22,950 / 18,000) * 100% = 127.5%. 

Answer: B
