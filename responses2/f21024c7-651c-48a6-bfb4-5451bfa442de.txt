Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try my best. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about finding a sequence y[n] that satisfies the recursion equation y[n] - (5/6)y[n-1] + (1/6)y[n-2] = 2. The initial conditions given are y[-1] = 1 and y[-2] = -7. The options are all different expressions involving exponential terms and constants. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that for linear recursions like this, we can use the method of finding the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution. Then add them together. The general approach is to first solve the homogeneous equation, find the characteristic equation, find its roots, and then write the homogeneous solution. Then find a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous part, and combine them to get the general solution. Then apply the initial conditions to solve for the constants.

Let me outline the steps:

1. **Find the homogeneous solution:**
   The homogeneous equation is y[n] - (5/6)y[n-1] + (1/6)y[n-2] = 0.
   So, the characteristic equation would be r^2 - (5/6) r + (1/6) = 0.

   Let me write that equation: r² - (5/6) r + 1/6 = 0.

   To solve this quadratic equation, I can use the quadratic formula. The roots are:

   r = [ (5/6) ± sqrt( (5/6)^2 - 4 * 1 * (1/6) ) ] / 2

   Let me compute the discriminant first: (5/6)^2 is 25/36. Then 4 * 1 * (1/6) is 4/6 = 2/3 = 24/36.

   So the discriminant is 25/36 - 24/36 = 1/36. That's positive, so two real roots.

   So sqrt(1/36) is 1/6.

   Therefore, the roots are:

   r = [5/6 ± 1/6 ] / 2. Wait, no, wait. The quadratic formula is [ (-b) ± sqrt(D) ]/(2a). So here, a=1, b= -5/6.

   So r = [ (5/6) ± (1/6) ] / 2 * because a is 1, so denominator is 2.

   Let me compute both roots.

   First root: (5/6 + 1/6)/2 = (6/6)/2 = (1)/2 = 1/2.

   Second root: (5/6 - 1/6)/2 = (4/6)/2 = (2/3)/2 = 1/3.

   So the two roots are r1 = 1/2 and r2 = 1/3.

   Therefore, the homogeneous solution is y_h[n] = A*(1/2)^n + B*(1/3)^n.

2. **Find the particular solution:**
   The nonhomogeneous term is 2, a constant. For such cases, the particular solution is usually a constant, say y_p[n] = C.

   Let me substitute y_p into the equation.

   y_p[n] = C. Then,

   y_p[n] - (5/6) y_p[n-1] + (1/6) y_p[n-2] = 2.

   Since y_p is a constant, each term is C. So,

   C - (5/6) C + (1/6) C = 2.

   Let me compute that: [1 -5/6 + 1/6] C = 2.

   Compute the coefficients:

   1 is 6/6. So 6/6 -5/6 = 1/6. Then +1/6 is 2/6 = 1/3.

   So (1/3) C = 2 → C=6.

   So y_p[n] = 6.

3. **General solution:**
   y[n] = y_h[n] + y_p[n] = A*(1/2)^n + B*(1/3)^n +6.

4. **Apply initial conditions:**
   Wait, the initial conditions here are given for n=-1 and n=-2. So I'll need to plug in those values into the general solution to find A and B.

   Let me write the general solution again:

   y[n] = A*(1/2)^n + B*(1/3)^n +6.

   So for n=-1:

   y[-1] = A*(1/2)^{-1} + B*(1/3)^{-1} +6 = A*2 + B*3 +6 =1.

   So equation 1: 2A + 3B +6 =1 → 2A +3B = -5.

   For n=-2:

   y[-2]= A*(1/2)^{-2} + B*(1/3)^{-2} +6 = A*4 + B*9 +6 = -7.

   So equation 2: 4A +9B +6 = -7 → 4A +9B = -13.

   Now I have a system of equations:

   2A +3B = -5 → equation (1)
   4A +9B = -13 → equation (2)

   Let me solve this system.

   Multiply equation (1) by 2: 4A +6B = -10 → equation (1a)
   Subtract equation (2): (4A +6B) - (4A +9B) = -10 - (-13) → 0A -3B = 3 → -3B=3 → B= -1.

   Now, substitute B= -1 into equation (1):

   2A +3*(-1) = -5 → 2A -3= -5 → 2A = -2 → A= -1.

   So A= -1, B= -1.

   Therefore, the general solution becomes:

   y[n] = (-1)(1/2)^n + (-1)(1/3)^n +6.

   Let me factor the negative signs:

   y[n] = 6 - (1/2)^n - (1/3)^n.

   Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options.

   Looking at the options:

   Option B is 6 - (1/2)^n - (1/3)^n. So that's the expression I got. So the answer should be option B.

   Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations.

   Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in solving for A and B. The equations were:

   2A +3B = -5

   4A +9B = -13

   Let me solve equation (1) for A: 2A = -5 -3B → A= (-5-3B)/2.

   Substitute into equation (2):

   4*(-5-3B)/2 +9B = -13 → ( -10 -6B ) +9B = -13 → -10 +3B =-13 → 3B= -3 → B= -1. Correct.

   Then A= (-5 -3*(-1))/2 → (-5 +3)/2 → (-2)/2 → -1. Correct.

   So the solution is y[n] =6 - (1/2)^n - (1/3)^n, which is option B.

   So the correct option is B.

The problem requires finding the sequence \( y[n] \) that satisfies the recursion equation \( y[n] - \frac{5}{6}y[n-1] + \frac{1}{6}y[n-2] = 2 \) with initial conditions \( y[-1] = 1 \) and \( y[-2] = -7 \). 

1. **Homogeneous Solution:**  
   The homogeneous equation is \( y[n] - \frac{5}{6}y[n-1] + \frac{1}{6}y[n-2] = 0 \). The characteristic equation is \( r^2 - \frac{5}{6}r + \frac{1}{6} = 0 \), with roots \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( r_2 = \frac{1}{3} \). Thus, the homogeneous solution is \( y_h[n] = A\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n + B\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n \).

2. **Particular Solution:**  
   For the nonhomogeneous term \( 2 \), assume a constant particular solution \( y_p[n] = C \). Substituting into the equation gives \( C - \frac{5}{6}C + \frac{1}{6}C = 2 \), leading to \( C = 6 \). Thus, the particular solution is \( y_p[n] = 6 \).

3. **General Solution:**  
   The general solution is \( y[n] = A\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n + B\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n + 6 \).

4. **Applying Initial Conditions:**  
   Using \( y[-1] = 1 \) and \( y[-2] = -7 \):
   - For \( n = -1 \): \( 2A + 3B + 6 = 1 \) leads to \( 2A + 3B = -5 \).
   - For \( n = -2 \): \( 4A + 9B + 6 = -7 \) leads to \( 4A + 9B = -13 \).

   Solving these equations:
   - Multiply the first equation by 2: \( 4A + 6B = -10 \).
   - Subtract the second equation: \( -3B = 3 \) → \( B = -1 \).
   - Substitute \( B = -1 \) into the first equation: \( 2A - 3 = -5 \) → \( A = -1 \).

   Thus, \( y[n] = 6 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n - \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n \).

5. **Matching with Options:**  
   The derived solution matches **Option B: \( 6 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n - \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n \)**.
