Okay, so I've got this question here about the gases on primitive Earth and which one was the exception. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that during the period when life was believed to have started, the atmosphere was rich in certain gases. We're to pick the one that wasn't there. The options are A to J, with each being a different gas.

I remember that early Earth's atmosphere was quite different from our modern one. The question mentions that life on Earth was believed to have started around 540 million years ago. So, the atmosphere at that time must have been from ancient, possibly pre-industrial times.

Let me list out the options and think about each gas's presence then. 

Option A: Hydrogen. I think hydrogen was definitely there. In fact, the early atmosphere probably contained hydrogen, especially since life forms like water and ammonia require hydrogen. So A is not the exception.

Option B: Methane. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. I think early Earth's atmosphere was more like that of Mars. Mars had methane in its atmosphere, so that's probably correct. B is present.

Option C: Nitrogen. That's definitely present. Nitrogen is about 78% of the atmosphere, which aligns with early Earth's composition. So C is there.

Option D: Sulfur dioxide. Wait, sulfur dioxide is a potent greenhouse gas. But early Earth's atmosphere didn't have sulfur dioxide. I think that's more like the atmosphere of Venus. So D is not present.

Option E: Neon. Neon is a noble gas and it's not part of the early Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere was mostly nitrogen and oxygen. So E is not present.

Option F: Oxygen. Oxygen is about 26% of the atmosphere, so it's definitely present.

Option G: Helium. Helium is a noble gas and it's not part of the early atmosphere. The atmosphere was mostly nitrogen and oxygen. So G isn't present.

Option H: Argon. Also a noble gas, so not present.

Option I: Ammonia. Ammonia is a liquid, but in the atmosphere, it's present as water vapor. So I is present.

Option J: Carbon dioxide. I know CO2 is a big part of the atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere does have a lot of CO2, so J is present.

So the gases present are C (nitrogen), F (oxygen), E (neon), G (helium), I (ammonia), J (CO2). The exceptions are D (sulfer dioxide) and the other noble gases E, G, and possibly others.

Wait, let me think again. The question asks which was the exception, meaning which one wasn't there. So the gases present are C, F, E, G, I, J. The remaining options are D, A, B, H, and what else? Let me see the other options.

Wait, option E is neon. So the exception would be the one not in the early atmosphere. So the gases that were present are C, F, E, G, I, J. So the exception would be the ones not in this list. Which one? Let's list all the options:

A: H2 (present)
B: CH4 (present)
C: N2 (present)
D: SO2 (not present)
E: Ne (not present)
F: O2 (present)
G: He (not present)
H: Ar (not present)
I: NH3 (present)
J: CO2 (present)

So the gases NOT present are D, E, G, H. Wait, but the question is which option was the exception—meaning which one was NOT present. So the gases that were present are C, F, E, G, I, J. So which of the options is not present?

Looking back, the options from A to J include A: H2, B: CH4, C: N2, D: SO2, E: Ne, F: O2, G: He, H: Ar, I: NH3, J: CO2.

Wait, the question states that the atmosphere was believed to have started around 540 million years ago. So the early Earth's atmosphere, which included life, was rich in what? I think it was mostly nitrogen, oxygen, and possibly argon. So the gases not present would be the ones not in that mix.

So the gases present are N2 (C), O2 (F), Ne (E), Ar (H), NH3 (I), CO2 (J). So the gases not present are CH4 (B), H2 (A), SO2 (D), He (G), and Ar (H).

Wait, but the question is which one was the exception—meaning which one was NOT present. So all the options except C, F, E, G, I, J are not present. So the question is which of the options was not present.

Wait, but the options are from A to J. So the gases present are C, F, E, G, I, J. Which of the options (A to J) are not present?

Looking again:

A: H2 (present)
B: CH4 (present)
C: N2 (present)
D: SO2 (not present)
E: Ne (not present)
F: O2 (present)
G: He (not present)
H: Ar (not present)
I: NH3 (present)
J: CO2 (present)

So the gases that are present are C, F, E, G, I, J. So which of the options (A to J) are not present? The question asks which was the exception, i.e., which one is not present.

So the gases that are not present are D, B, H, and G. But wait, the question is which of the options A to J was the exception, meaning which one was not present.

Wait, no. Let me approach this correctly. The question says which one was the exception, i.e., which one was NOT present.

So among the options, the gases that are not present are the answer.

Looking at the options:

A: H2 (present)
B: CH4 (present)
C: N2 (present)
D: SO2 (not present)
E: Ne (not present)
F: O2 (present)
G: He (not present)
H: Ar (not present)
I: NH3 (present)
J: CO2 (present)

So the gases present are C, F, E, G, I, J. The others (A, B, D, H) are not present.

So the question is which one was the exception, meaning which of these is not present.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the atmosphere on primitive Earth contained abundant amounts of all the following gases EXCEPT".

So the exception is the one not present. The options are A-J. So which one of these is not present.

The options that are not present are D (Sulphur Dioxide), E (Neon), G (Helium), H (Argon).

Wait, but the question is which one was not present. The options are individual gases, so which of the options is not present.

Wait, the question says the atmosphere had all these gases except one. So the correct answer is the one that's not present.

So the gases present are C, F, E, G, I, J. So the options not present are A (H2), B (CH4), D (SO2), H (Ar), G (He).

So which of the options is the exception? The question is which one was the exception.

Wait, but the options are each a gas. So the correct answer is the one that is not present among the options. So the gases not present are D, B, H, G.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the atmosphere on primitive Earth contained abundant amounts of all the following gases EXCEPT".

So the exception is the one not present. So the correct answer would be the option that is not present.

So the options are:

A: H2 (present)
B: CH4 (present)
C: N2 (present)
D: SO2 (not present)
E: Ne (not present)
F: O2 (present)
G: He (not present)
H: Ar (not present)
I: NH3 (present)
J: CO2 (present)

So the gases not present are D, E, G, H.

Wait, but the question is which of the options (A-J) was the exception, meaning which one was not present.

So the correct answer is the one that's not present. So the options that are not present are D, E, G, H.

Wait, but how does that fit into the options given? Because the question is which one was the exception. So the correct answer is the option that is not present. So the four options not present are D, E, G, H.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice, so only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in my previous understanding. Maybe I should think about what gases were actually on Earth.

Another approach: Remember that the early Earth's atmosphere was rich in oxygen, nitrogen, and argon. It's not very rich in sulfur dioxide. So the exception is sulfur dioxide.

Wait, but wait, I thought that sulfur dioxide was present on Venus but not on Earth. So yes, option D is sulfur dioxide, which is not present.

So the answer would be option D (sulfur dioxide) is the exception.

Alternatively, perhaps the ammonia is present in the atmosphere. Ammonia is a liquid form, but in the atmosphere, it's present as water vapor. So option I is ammonia and is present.

Wait, but the question includes all the options, so let's re-examine.

Wait, the options are A to J. The correct answer is D (Sulfur Dioxide) because it's the only one not present. Let me verify each option.

So putting it all together, the gases present on primitive Earth are N2, O2, Ar, H2, NH3, CO2. The exception is SO2.

So the correct answer is D.

The question asks which gas was the exception to the gases present on primitive Earth. Primitive Earth's atmosphere, believed to have existed around 540 million years ago, was rich in certain gases. Among the options, hydrogen (A), methane (B), nitrogen (C), sulfur dioxide (D), oxygen (F), and carbon dioxide (J) were present. However, sulfur dioxide (D) was not part of the early Earth's atmosphere. 

To summarize:

- **A: Hydrogen (H₂)** was present.
- **B: Methane (CH₄)** was present.
- **C: Nitrogen (N₂)** was present.
- **D: Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)** was not present.
- **E: Neon (Ne)** was not present.
- **F: Oxygen (O₂)** was present.
- **G: Helium (He)** was not present.
- **H: Argon (Ar)** was not present.
- **I: Ammonia (NH₃)** was present.
- **J: Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)** was present.

The exception is sulfur dioxide (D), as it was not abundant in primitive Earth's atmosphere. 

ANSWER: D
