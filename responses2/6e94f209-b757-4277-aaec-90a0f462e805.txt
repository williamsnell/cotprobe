Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about calculating the weight percent of helium and argon in a mixture. The mixture is made up of 5.00 grams of helium and argon. The volume is 10.0 liters at a temperature of 25°C and a pressure of 1.00 atm. The options given are from A to J, each with different percentages.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with gases under certain conditions, the ideal gas law is useful. The ideal gas equation is PV = nRT. Since we're dealing with two gases here, helium and argon, maybe I should calculate their moles first.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives the total mass, which is 5.00 grams. So, the sum of the moles of He and Ar would equal the total moles, and their masses would add up to 5.00 grams.

Let me write down the variables:

Mass of He + Mass of Ar = 5.00 g.

I think I should find the moles of each gas. But to do that, I need to know the volume, temperature, and pressure. The problem gives V=10.0 L, T=25°C (which is 298.15 K if I'm not mistaken, but maybe I can approximate it as 298 K), and P=1.00 atm.

So, using PV = nRT for each gas.

But wait, since both He and Ar are diatomic gases (He is monoatomic, Ar is diatomic?), but wait no, for the ideal gas law, the specific gas constant R depends on the gas. So for He, R is (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) per mole of He, but for Ar, it's different. Actually, no, the ideal gas law uses the same R for each gas when we're considering them as separate. So the total number of moles is n_total = (PV)/(RT).

Wait, but hold on. Let me think: for each gas, we can write:

n1 = (P * V) / (R * T) for He,
n2 = (P * V) / (R * T) for Ar.

Because both He and Ar are ideal gases and occupy the same volume, pressure, and temperature. So their moles would be the same. Is that correct?

Wait, no. Because the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. If both are at the same P, V, T, then yes, n is the same for both. Oh wait, but wait, that would mean both He and Ar contribute the same moles, which doesn't seem right. Because their molar masses are different: He is about 4 g/mol, Ar about 40 g/mol. So if the pressure and volume are the same, the moles would be the same. But that's not possible because the same amount of gas under same conditions would have the same number of moles, but different masses.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For He, n = m / (M), where M is the molar mass. So, m = n*M. Similarly for Ar. So if both He and Ar are in the same volume, same temperature, same pressure, then their moles would be the same. But that can't be right because their molar masses are different. So the total mass would be n*(M_He + M_Ar) = 5.00 g. If moles are the same (nHe = nAr), then the total mass would be n*(4 + 40) = n*44. But in reality, the mass is 5.00 g. So n would be 5.00 / 44 ≈ 0.1136 moles.

Wait, but is that correct? Because if both He and Ar are in the same amount, their masses would add up. Let me think: If nHe = nAr, then the mass He is n * 4.000 g/mol, and mass Ar is n * 39.948 g/mol (since Ar's molar mass is about 39.948 g/mol). So adding them together: n*(4.000 + 39.948) = n * 43.948. So the total mass is about 43.948 * n. If that's equal to 5.00 g, then n is about 5 /43.948 ≈ 0.114 moles. So each contributes about 0.057 moles.

But wait, wait a second. The problem says the mixture is 5.00 grams of He and Ar. So the total mass is 5.00 grams. So the sum of the moles times their respective molar masses is 5.00 grams.

So, nHe * 4.000 + nAr * 39.948 = 5.00 g.

But if both He and Ar are present in the same amount, then nHe = nAr, so:

nHe * (4.000 + 39.948) = 5.00 → nHe = 5.00 / 43.948 ≈ 0.114 mol.

So, each gas contributes about 0.057 mol.

Wait, but wait, the ideal gas law says that each gas individually follows PV = nRT.

But wait, if both gases are in the same volume, same temperature, same pressure, then the moles should be the same. So nHe = nAr.

So that's correct. So each contributes approximately 0.057 moles.

Wait, but that's only if nHe = nAr. So, the molar masses are different.

So the mass of He would be 0.057 *4.000 ≈0.228 g.

The mass of Ar would be 0.057 *39.948 ≈2.276 g.

So total mass would be about 0.228 + 2.276 = 2.504 g. But the problem states the total mass is 5.00 grams.

Wait, that doesn't add up. So this approach might be flawed. Maybe the problem isn't that both gases have the same moles, but instead that the two gases are in the same volume, same pressure, same temperature. So their moles are determined by that. Let me think again.

Wait, the volume is 10.0 L, T=25 C (298 K), P=1.00 atm.

Using the ideal gas law:

PV = nRT → n = PV/(RT)

So n = (1.00 atm * 10.0 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 298 K)

Calculating that:

10.0 / (0.0821 * 298) → 10.0 / (24.4658) ≈ 0.4086 mol.

So the total moles of the mixture is about 0.4086 mol.

Now, the mixture is 5.00 g of He and Ar. So the sum of their masses is 5.00 g. The total mass is 5.00 g, so the sum of (mHe and mAr) is 5.00 g.

But the moles of He and Ar would be: nHe = mHe /4.000, and nAr = mAr /39.948.

But since the total moles are 0.4086, we have:

nHe + nAr = 0.4086 → (mHe /4.000) + (mAr /39.948) = 0.4086.

And mHe + mAr =5.00.

So, substituting mAr =5.00 - mHe into the equation:

(mHe /4) + (5.00 - mHe)/39.948 = 0.4086.

Let me compute this:

Let me compute each term.

(mHe/4) is (mHe * 0.25). (5.00 - mHe)/39.948 is approximately (5 - mHe)/40.

So:

0.25 mHe + (5 - mHe)/40 = 0.4086

Multiply both sides by 40 to eliminate denominator:

40 * 0.25 mHe + 5 - mHe = 0.4086 *40.

Compute each term:

40 * 0.25 is 10 → 10 mHe +5 - mHe = 16.344.

Combine like terms:

(10mHe - mHe) is 9 mHe → 9 mHe +5 =16.344.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 9 mHe = 11.344 → mHe = 11.344/9 ≈1.2604 g.

So mHe ≈1.2604 grams.

Then mAr is 5.00 -1.2604 ≈3.7396 grams.

So, the mass of He is about 1.26 grams, and Ar is about 3.74 grams.

Now, I need to find the weight percent of each.

Weight percent of He is (mass He / total mass) *100.

So (1.2604 g /5.00 g) *100 ≈25.2%.

Weight percent of Ar is (3.7396 /5.00) *100≈74.8%.

Wait, that matches option F, which says He is 25.2%, Ar 74.8%.

So the correct answer should be F.
</think>

To determine the weight percent of helium (He) and argon (Ar) in the mixture, we use the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \) and the given conditions. The total mass of the mixture is 5.00 g, and the total volume is 10.0 L at 25°C (298 K) and 1.00 atm. The molar masses of He and Ar are approximately 4.000 g/mol and 39.948 g/mol, respectively.

1. **Calculate the total moles of the gas mixture:**
   \[
   n_{\text{total}} = \frac{PV}{RT} = \frac{(1.00 \, \text{atm})(10.0 \, \text{L})}{(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/mol·K})(298 \, \text{K})} \approx 0.4086 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Set up the equations for the masses of He and Ar:**
   Let \( m_{\text{He}} \) be the mass of helium and \( m_{\text{Ar}} \) be the mass of argon. The total mass is:
   \[
   m_{\text{He}} + m_{\text{Ar}} = 5.00 \, \text{g}.
   \]
   The number of moles of each gas is given by:
   \[
   n_{\text{He}} = \frac{m_{\text{He}}}{4.000}, \quad n_{\text{Ar}} = \frac{m_{\text{Ar}}}{39.948}.
   \]
   Since the total number of moles is 0.4086, we have:
   \[
   \frac{m_{\text{He}}}{4.000} + \frac{m_{\text{Ar}}}{39.948} = 0.4086.
   \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**
   Substitute \( m_{\text{Ar}} = 5.00 - m_{\text{He}} \) into the second equation:
   \[
   \frac{m_{\text{He}}}{4.000} + \frac{5.00 - m_{\text{He}}}{39.948} = 0.4086.
   \]
   Multiply through by 39.948 to eliminate the denominator:
   \[
   9.987 \, m_{\text{He}} + 5.00 - m_{\text{He}} = 16.344.
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   8.987 \, m_{\text{He}} = 11.344 \quad \Rightarrow \quad m_{\text{He}} \approx 1.260 \, \text{g}.
   \]
   Then:
   \[
   m_{\text{Ar}} = 5.00 - 1.260 = 3.740 \, \text{g}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the weight percent of each gas:**
   - Weight percent of He:
     \[
     \text{Weight percent He} = \frac{m_{\text{He}}}{m_{\text{total}}} \times 100 = \frac{1.260}{5.00} \times 100 \approx 25.2\%.
     \]
   - Weight percent of Ar:
     \[
     \text{Weight percent Ar} = \frac{m_{\text{Ar}}}{m_{\text{total}}} \times 100 = \frac{3.740}{5.00} \times 100 \approx 74.8\%.
     \]

5. **Verify the options:**
   The calculated weight percentages match option **F**, which states that the weight percent of He is 25.2% and the weight percent of Ar is 74.8%.
