Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the Truman Doctrine. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.

The Truman Doctrine is a key policy document in the Cold War era, right? It was proposed by US President Dwight D. Eisenhower. So, I'm thinking the options that relate to US foreign policy during that time would be relevant.

Looking at the options: 

Option A says it outlined Truman's plan for economic recovery after WWII. That sounds familiar. I remember that the Truman administration had a plan to stimulate the economy, which aimed to boost the US's recovery from the war's effects. So A might be correct.

Option B suggests it led to the establishment of the UN. Wait, the UN was established later, in 1949 after the Cold War. The Truman Doctrine was during the Cold War, so it probably didn't lead to the creation of the UN. B is probably not correct.

Option C claims it indicated the US views local revolts through a geopolitical lens. I think that's part of the Truman Doctrine, specifically about recognizing that local conflicts can be viewed as challenges to global stability, not just internal matters. So C is correct.

Option D says it was a declaration of war against the Soviet Union. No, that's part of the Cold War. The Truman Doctrine was about ending the Cold War rather than declaring war. D is likely incorrect.

Option E: US withdrawal from international affairs. Well, the US was a major actor, but the doctrine also included the idea that the US would not engage in other areas outside its sphere. So E might be correct, but I'm not so sure. Let me think: the Truman Doctrine didn't explicitly say the US withdrew, but it did outline certain areas where it would not go into. So perhaps E is correct, but I need to check other options.

Option F: US's withdrawal from international affairs. I think the doctrine was more about maintaining US influence but not necessarily a full withdrawal. So F might not be the best answer.

Option G: Space race beginning. The Truman Doctrine was more about economic and security matters, not space. G is probably incorrect.

Option H: Cold War end. That's exactly what the Truman Doctrine was about. It was a significant step towards ending the Cold War. So H is correct.

Option I: Truman's first statement on European affairs. The Truman Doctrine was a significant policy document, but I'm not sure if it was the first. Maybe it was, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it was part of a series of policies, so I'm not sure if it's the first statement. So I'm a bit uncertain about I.

Option J: US reluctance to get involved elsewhere. The doctrine does talk about not going into other areas, but it's not exactly about reluctance to get involved elsewhere. So J might not be correct.

Wait, let me think again about the options. The question is about the significance of the Truman Doctrine. The key points are that it ended the Cold War, it focused on economic and security matters, and it outlined certain areas the US would not go into.

Looking back at the options:

H: It marked the end of the Cold War. That seems correct because the US was trying to end the Cold War with the doctrine, which included stopping the Soviet influence.

A: Economic recovery plan. That's correct too, but the question is about the significance, which is about ending the Cold War, not the specifics of the plan.

E: US withdrawal from international matters. The doctrine stated that the US would not get involved in other areas outside its sphere, but it didn't say that the US would withdraw. So E might not be correct.

Wait, the options are asking for the significance. So the significance is about the end of the Cold War, as that was the main purpose of the Truman Doctrine.

So the correct answer would be H: It marked the end of the Cold War.

The Truman Doctrine was a pivotal policy document during the Cold War, aimed at ending the Cold War. It outlined economic and security measures to prevent the Soviet Union from influencing international affairs. Among the options, the correct answer is:

**H: It marked the end of the Cold War.**

This is because the Truman Doctrine was a key step in the US's effort to end the Cold War, focusing on non-interference in other areas beyond its sphere of influence. 

ANSWER: H
