He was walking along the sidewalk in front of the store when he slipped on a piece of eel. He brought suit against the owner of the market claiming that he suffered leg and back injuries. The owner, although admitting that the customer was injured by slipping on the eel, denied negligence and claimed that the customer was contributorily negligent. At trial, the owner calls a witness to testify that before the fall he heard someone call out to the customer, "Watch it, buddy, you're going to step on that piece of fish. "The witness's testimony is

Options:

D: inadmissible, as hearsay not within any exception.
E: admissible, because it is relevant as to the customer's contributory negligence.
F: admissible, because it provides context to the event.
G: inadmissible, because the witness was not directly involved in the incident.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about hearsay evidence. Let me read through the details again.

The scenario is that a customer slipped on eel and brought suit. The owner admitted the customer was injured, but denied negligence. The owner called a witness who testified that before the fall, the customer heard someone call out, "Watch it, buddy, you're going to step on that piece of fish." The question is about whether this statement is admissible.

Hmm, so the issue here is whether the statement made by the customer is hearsay. Hearsay is anything stated by a third party that is not directly connected to the fact asserted in the statement. But in this case, the statement is by the customer, so it's their own statement. So if someone else hears it and can link it to the claim, it might not be hearsay. But if the customer's statement is being used as evidence, then it's hearsay.

Wait, but the statement is made before the fall. So the customer was walking when the slip happened. The witness hears them say that before the fall, the customer heard someone call out that they were going to step on the eel. So the customer's statement is before the fall, which is before the slip. So does that affect whether the statement is hearsay?

Wait, the key issue is whether the statement is hearsay. Since it's a statement by the customer, it's not hearsay unless it's a statement made by a third party that relates to the content of the statement. But in this case, the statement is from the customer, so it's their own statement. So it's admissible as hearsay because it's a statement of a third party. But wait, another angle: if the statement is made in a situation that could be considered a defense, like the fall, how does that affect it?

Wait, the statement is made before the fall. So if the customer is in a position of recklessness, maybe they should have known that they could slip and stepped on something. But since the owner is charging contributory negligence, the customer's statement is trying to show that the owner's fault was not entirely on their part. So the customer's statement is being used as evidence to show that the customer was at fault.

But wait, the customer is the one who's using their own statement as evidence. So if the statement is made before the fall, then the customer might be considered to have been at fault because they didn't know what they were slipping on. But in this case, the witness's testimony is that the customer heard the warning before the slip. So the statement is made before the slip, so the customer's knowledge of the situation (slipping on eel) is relevant.

Wait, but if the statement is made before the slip, does that mean it's before the fall? Or is it about the moment before the slip? Anyway, the point is that the statement is made by the customer, so it's hearsay. Unless it's a statement that can be used with the declaration of the declarant's present state of mind (I), which is option I.

Alternatively, if the statement is made before the slip, then the customer might have known the fall was coming, so their statement could be considered a warning. But if the statement is made before the slip, that's a problem because the customer was about to slip, so their statement could be used as a warning.

Wait, but the question is about whether the statement is admissible. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The statement is by the customer, so it's hearsay unless it's admissible under an exception. If the statement is made before the slip, then the customer's statement could be used as a warning, which is hearsay. But the issue is whether the statement is hearsay.

Wait, the customer's statement is part of the case. The owner is claiming contributory negligence, so the customer's statement is being used to show that the owner's fault was not entirely on their part. So the statement is being used as evidence of the customer's fault.

But the statement is an out-of-court statement by the customer, so if the statement is hearsay, it's admissible. But in this case, the statement is made before the fall, and the customer was about to slip. Does that make it not hearsay? Or is the issue that it's a statement made before the event, so it's not hearsay.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me recall the hearsay rules. Hearsay is any statement made by a third party that isn't directly connected to the content of the statement asserted. So if the statement is made by the customer, it's not hearsay unless it's offered to prove the content of the statement. But the customer's statement is being offered as evidence to show that the customer's fault was a contributing factor. So the statement itself is being used as evidence, but if it's a statement by the customer, it's not hearsay.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the statement is made while the customer was in a position of recklessness, then it's not hearsay because it's a statement of the declarant's present state of mind. That's option I. So if the statement is made by the customer, it's not hearsay because it's the declarant's own statement.

Wait, but the options include whether the statement is admissible. So if the statement is made by the customer, it's not hearsay. But wait, the statement is made before the slip. So the customer was at risk of slipping, so their statement could be a warning. But in this case, the owner is claiming contributory negligence, so the customer's statement is being used to show that the owner's fault was not entirely on their part.

But the question is about the admissibility of the statement. If the statement is hearsay, it's inadmissible unless it's admissible under an exception. So the statement is made by the customer, so it's not hearsay unless it's being used to prove the content of the statement. But since the owner is charging contributory negligence, the customer's statement is being offered as evidence to prove that the customer was at fault. So if the statement is hearsay, it's inadmissible.

Wait, but the problem is the statement was made before the slip. So if the customer was about to slip, their statement could be considered a warning. But in that case, the statement would be hearsay because it's a statement of the customer. But if the statement was made before the slip, perhaps the customer's knowledge of the fall (which is a duty of care) could be inferred, making their statement not hearsay.

Alternatively, the statement being made before the slip might not be hearsay if the customer knew the fall was coming. But if the customer didn't know, their statement could be hearsay. Wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the customer knew. But the problem states they were walking along the sidewalk when the slip happened. The customer was in a position of recklessness because they were walking on a sidewalk, which is not a safe surface. So they were at risk, but they didn't realize they were slipping on eel. So their statement could be hearsay.

Wait, but the first thing is that the statement is made by the customer, so it's not hearsay. Unless it's used to prove the content of the statement. Wait, but the owner is using the statement to show the customer's contributory negligence. So the statement is being offered as evidence that the customer's fault was a contributing factor to the slip. So the statement is hearsay unless it's admissible under an exception.

So, let's look at the options. Option I says it's admissible as a statement of the declarant's present state of mind. So if the statement is made by the customer, is it admissible as the declarant's present state of mind? Or is it admissible as a warning (if the customer knew the fall was coming)?

Wait, the customer was walking along the sidewalk, which is not a safe surface. So the customer might have known that they were about to slip. But the problem doesn't state that they knew. So if the customer didn't know, their statement is hearsay. But if they did know, their statement could be considered a warning, which is hearsay if it's offered to prove the content. But the issue is whether the statement is hearsay to be admitted.

Wait, but the statement is made by the customer and offered to prove that they were at fault. So the statement is hearsay unless it's admissible. So if it's hearsay, it's inadmissible. But the options are about whether it's admissible. So the options are about whether the statement is admissible as hearsay.

Alternatively, if the statement is made before the slip, the customer might have known or not, but the slip happened while they were walking. So if the customer was in a position of recklessness, their statement could be considered a warning, making it admissible under the "present state of mind" exception.

Wait, but if the statement was made before the fall, and the customer was about to slip, their statement could be considered as a warning, which is hearsay. So unless it's admissible under an exception, it's inadmissible.

Wait, but the statement is made by the customer, so it's not hearsay unless it's being offered to prove the content of the statement. But the owner is using the statement to show the customer's fault, so it's hearsay.

Wait, but the options are about whether the statement is admissible. So if it's hearsay, the correct answer would be inadmissible, unless it's admissible under an exception.

Looking back, the options. I is admissible as a statement of the declarant's present state of mind. So if the statement was made by the customer, and it's offered to show the customer's present state of mind, then it's admissible under this exception. So the statement would be admissible.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me consider each option:

A: admissible as a statement made in heat of the moment. I think that's a hearsay exception, but only if the statement was made in a time of stress or danger. So if the customer's statement was made when the slip was imminent, perhaps it's admissible. But the question doesn't give any info on the time of the slip.

B: Inadmissible because the customer did not acknowledge the warning. So the witness would need to have acknowledged the warning. But the statement says the customer heard someone call before the fall, so the customer was aware of the warning. So B is incorrect.

C: Inadmissible because it wasn't a spontaneous utterance. Spontaneous utterances are when someone speaks without a reason, like in a dangerous situation. But the customer was walking, so perhaps the statement is spontaneous. So C is incorrect.

D: Inadmissible because it's hearsay not within any exception. If the statement is hearsay and doesn't fit any exception, then it's inadmissible. I don't think so. The present state of mind is an exception, so I think D is wrong.

E: Admissible as a statement of the declarant's present state of mind. So if the statement was made by the customer and offered to show their present state, then it's admissible under I. So E would be correct.

F: Inadmissible because it provides context. I don't think that's the case. The statement is about the customer's state of mind.

G: Inadmissible because the witness wasn't directly involved. But the witness is involved because he testified about the statement. The issue is about the statement's admissibility, not the witness's involvement.

H: Admissible because it indicates no control. But the statement is about the customer making a statement, so it's about who made the statement, not about control.

J: Inadmissible as second-hand info. Second-hand info is when the statement is repeated by someone else, but the statement is made by the same person, so J is incorrect.

So, the correct answer would be E: admissible as a statement of the declarant's present state of mind, if the statement was made under the exception of present state of mind.
</think>

The customer's statement is being offered to prove that they were at fault for slipping on eel, making it hearsay. However, the statement is admissible under the "present state of mind" exception, which allows a statement by the declarant to be admitted if it reflects the declarant's actual state of mind at the time of the statement. Since the customer was walking along the sidewalk, which is not a safe surface, they may have known they were about to slip. Therefore, the statement could be considered a warning, qualifying it for the present state of mind exception.

The other options are incorrect because:
- A: The statement could be admissible if made in a dangerous situation, which is not specified.
- B: Incorrect because the customer acknowledged the warning.
- C: Incorrect because the statement was made during a period of recklessness.
- D: Incorrect because the statement is hearsay and falls under the present state of mind exception.
- E: Correct, as the statement fits the present state of mind exception.
- F: Incorrect because context does not preclude its admissibility.
- G: Incorrect because the statement is not second-hand.
- H: Incorrect because the statement does not relate to control.
- J: Incorrect because the statement is not second-hand information.
