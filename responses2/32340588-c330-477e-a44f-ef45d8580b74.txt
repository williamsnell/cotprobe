Alright, so I've got this question about monopolists and consumer surplus. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Okay, the question says the monopolist's average and marginal costs are both 5. So AC=MC=5. The demand curve is Q=53 - P. And we're looking at perfect competition where price equals marginal cost, which is 5. We need to find the consumer surplus under that scenario.

Wait, consumer surplus is the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay. In perfect competition, the price is determined by MC, which is 5. So the firm will produce until MC equals the price, which is 5.

So first, I should find the quantity produced under perfect competition. The demand is Q=53-P. At P=5, substituting, Q=53-5=48. So the firm produces 48 units.

Now, to find the consumer surplus. Under perfect competition, the demand curve is the same as the market demand. The consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve but above the equilibrium price.

The demand curve is linear, so the triangle of surplus would have a base at P=5, and the height would be at the quantity where demand is zero. Wait, demand is Q=53-P, so when P=0, Q=53. So the demand curve starts at (0,53) and ends at (53,0).

So the consumer surplus is the area of a triangle with base 53 and height 5. The area is (base * height)/2.

Wait, but wait. The base is the quantity, 48, or is it the height? No, wait, no, the base in the triangle is the quantity, because the base is along the quantity axis. Wait, I think I might have confused myself.

Actually, the base of the triangle is the quantity under consideration, and the height is the price. Because the demand curve is P = 53 - Q. At equilibrium, P=5, so Q=48.

So the triangle's base is Q=48, and the height is P=5. So the area is (48 * 5)/2. Let's compute that.

48 *5=240; 240/2=120. So consumer surplus is 120.

Wait, but looking at the options, there's an option I: 1200. Hmm, that's way bigger. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait. Maybe I got the units wrong. Because the demand is in terms of units, but the numbers here—53 and 5—might not be in thousands. Wait, but the question doesn't specify. So perhaps I calculated correctly, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: in perfect competition, the consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve but above the price. So the demand equation is P = 53 - Q. At price P = 5, Q is 48. So the demand curve starts at (0,53), goes to (53,0). The surplus is the area of the triangle from (0,53) to (0,5) to (48,5) to (48,0).

That area can be calculated as the integral of P from Q=0 to Q=48. Since P=53-Q, the integral is ∫(53 - Q) dQ from 0 to48.

The integral of 53 is 53Q, the integral of Q is Q²/2. Evaluated from 0 to48: (53*48 - (48²)/2) -0.

Compute 53*48: 50*48=2400, 3*48=144, so 2544.

48²=2304; 2304/2=1152.

So 2544-1152=1392. Wait, wait, but wait the area is 1392, but that's the integral, which is the total area under the curve from 0 to48. But the consumer surplus is the area above the price line (P=5) up to Q=48.

So the total area under demand is 1392, and the total area up to price 5 is a rectangle of 5*48=240. So the surplus is 1392-240=1152.

Ah, so 1152, which is option H.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 120. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, why am I getting two different answers? Let's go back.

Wait, in perfect competition, the demand curve is the same as the market demand, which is Q=53-P. So the demand function is P=53-Q.

The equilibrium price is 5, so Q=48.

The consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve from Q=0 to Q=48, minus the area of the rectangle formed by P=5 and Q=48.

Wait, no. Wait, the total area under the demand curve from 0 to 48 is the integral, which is 1392. The area of the rectangle is 5*48=240. So the difference is 1392-240=1152.

So that would be the consumer surplus.

But let me double-check. Alternatively, think of it as the area between P=5 and P=53-Q.

Wait, the demand curve is P=53-Q.

At any Q, the price is 53-Q. The consumer surplus is the integral from 0 to Q of (53 - Q) dQ minus the area of the rectangle (P=5)*Q.

So for Q=48, it's 1392 - (5*48)=1152.

So why was the first approach giving me 120?

Ah, because I forgot to realize that the area under the demand curve from 0 to48 is 1392, and subtracting the rectangle gives the surplus.

So the correct answer should be 1152, which is option H.

The question involves calculating the consumer surplus under perfect competition where the price equals marginal cost (MC = 5). The monopolist's average and marginal costs are both 5, and the demand curve is Q = 53 - P.

1. **Determine the equilibrium quantity under perfect competition:**
   - At equilibrium, price equals marginal cost, so \( P = 5 \).
   - Substituting \( P = 5 \) into the demand equation:  
     \[
     Q = 53 - 5 = 48.
     \]

2. **Calculate the consumer surplus:**
   - The demand curve is \( P = 53 - Q \). The consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve but above the equilibrium price.
   - The total area under the demand curve from \( Q = 0 \) to \( Q = 48 \) is given by the integral:
     \[
     \int_0^{48} (53 - Q) \, dQ = \left[ 53Q - \frac{Q^2}{2} \right]_0^{48}.
     \]
     Substituting \( Q = 48 \):  
     \[
     53 \cdot 48 - \frac{48^2}{2} = 2544 - 1152 = 1392.
     \]
   - The area of the rectangle formed by \( P = 5 \) and \( Q = 48 \) is:
     \[
     5 \cdot 48 = 240.
     \]
   - The consumer surplus is the difference between these two areas:
     \[
     \text{Consumer Surplus} = 1392 - 240 = 1152.
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The consumer surplus under perfect competition is \( 1152 \), which corresponds to option **H**.
