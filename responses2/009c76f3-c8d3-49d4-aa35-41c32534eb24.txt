Okay, so I need to find out who was the WNBA Most Valuable Player of 1999. Let me think about how to approach this. I know that the WNBA is the women's professional basketball league in the United States, and each year has a Most Valuable Player award. I think the 1999 version was particularly significant, and I remember hearing some names associated with it.

The options given are A to J. Let me list them out: A is Yolanda Griffith, B is Cynthia Cooper, C is Dawn Staley, D is Rebecca Lobo, E is Tamika Catchings, F is Sue Bird, G is Tina Thompson, H is Sheryl Swoopes, I is Lauren Jackson, and J is Lisa Leslie.

I'm trying to recall which of these were key players. Yolanda Griffith comes to mind; I think she was a standout player. She was the team captain and played in the 1999 WNBA season. I believe she was the MVP that year because of her leadership and scoring. But wait, I should double-check.

Another player I remember is Rebecca Lobo. She was also a key figure, but I'm not sure if she was MVP. Maybe she was a closer or a team captain as well. Then there's Tina Thompson, who was a star player. But I'm not sure about her being the MVP.

Wait, I think the MVP in 1999 was Yolanda Griffith. She's known for her leadership, scoring, and being a captain. She's also part of the original team, and she's been mentioned a lot in discussions about the 1999 MVP. I'm pretty confident about that.

Looking at the options, Yolanda Griffith is option A. So I think the correct answer is A.
