Alright, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says that a point (x, y) is chosen uniformly at random within the region where 0 < |x| + |y| < 1. I need to find the probability that 2(x + y) > 1. The options are given, but I should try to work it out myself first.

First, I need to understand the region where the point is chosen. The inequality 0 < |x| + |y| < 1 defines a diamond shape, also known as a square rotated by 45 degrees. This diamond has its vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1). So the region is like a square with its corners at those points but without including the boundaries since it's strictly less than 1.

Since the distribution is uniform, the probability is proportional to the area of the region where the condition holds. So I need to find the area within this diamond where 2(x + y) > 1, and then divide that by the total area of the diamond to get the probability.

Wait, let me think again. The condition 2(x + y) > 1 can be rewritten as x + y > 1/2. So I'm looking for the area where x + y is greater than 1/2 within the diamond.

Hmm, the diamond is symmetric in all four quadrants, so I can maybe compute the area in one quadrant and multiply by four, but perhaps it's easier to visualize it.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to sketch the lines x + y = 1/2 and see where it intersects the diamond. Let's find the points of intersection between x + y = 1/2 and the diamond's edges.

The diamond's edges are the lines x + y = 1, x - y = 1, -x + y = 1, and -x - y = 1. So for each of these, let's find where x + y = 1/2 meets them.

Let's take x + y = 1 and x + y = 1/2. Solving these together:

x + y = 1
x + y = 1/2

Wait, that's impossible because the two equations can't both be true. So, the line x + y = 1/2 doesn't intersect the diamond's edge x + y = 1. Instead, it must intersect other edges.

Let's try each edge:

1. Edge x - y = 1: substitute into x + y = 1/2.

x + y = 1/2
x - y = 1

Adding the two equations: 2x = 3/2 → x = 3/4.
Then, y = (1/2 - x) = (1/2 - 3/4) = -1/4.

So one point is (3/4, -1/4).

2. Edge -x + y = 1: x + y = 1/2.

-x + y = 1
x + y = 1/2

Adding: 2y = 3/2 → y = 3/4.

Then, x = (1/2 - y) = (1/2 - 3/4) = -1/4.

So another point is (-1/4, 3/4).

Wait, that's interesting. So the line x + y = 1/2 intersects the diamond at (3/4, -1/4) and (-1/4, 3/4).

Are there any other points? Let's check the other edges. Oh wait, I think I've considered all four edges, but maybe the line intersects the diamond in two points only. So the region where x + y > 1/2 is a polygon bounded by these two points and parts of the diamond.

Wait, but given the diamond's symmetry, perhaps the area where x + y > 1/2 is formed by two triangles or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the area using geometry. So let's think:

The diamond has four sides, each of length sqrt(2), because each side is from (1,0) to (0,1), which is a distance of sqrt( (1)^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2). But no, actually, each edge is a straight line between two points, so each edge is of length sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 ) = sqrt(2), but in the diamond, each edge is actually the line x + y = 1, but the edges are actually along the lines x + y = 1, x - y = 1, etc.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the area of the diamond first. The diamond is a square rotated by 45 degrees, with its vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1). So the diamond's area can be calculated as 2. Because the area of a square with side length sqrt(2) is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. Alternatively, the diamond can be considered as two congruent triangles in the first and second quadrants. Each triangle has a base and height of 1, so area is (1*1)/2 = 0.5. Multiply by 2, gives 1. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe the area is 2? Because the diamond is formed by four triangles each with area 0.5. So 4*(0.5) = 2. Yes, that makes sense.

Wait, but I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me think again. The diamond is a square with diagonals of length 2 along both axes. The area of a square is (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. So here, d1 = 2 (from -1 to 1 along x-axis), d2 = 2 (from -1 to 1 along y-axis). So area is (2*2)/2 = 2. So the total area of the diamond is 2.

So the total area is 2, so the probability will be the area where 2(x + y) >1 (which is x + y > 1/2) divided by 2.

Now, I need to find the area within the diamond where x + y > 1/2.

Looking back, the line x + y = 1/2 intersects the diamond at two points: (3/4, -1/4) and (-1/4, 3/4). So the region where x + y > 1/2 is a polygon bounded by these two points and parts of the diamond.

Wait, perhaps it's a quadrilateral, but given the points, it's a line cutting through the diamond, creating a smaller shape.

Alternatively, perhaps the area can be found by integrating or by calculating the area of a polygon.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the area using symmetry. Since the diamond is symmetric across both the x and y axes, as well as the lines y = x and y = -x, the line x + y = 1/2 will have symmetrical points relative to these axes.

Let me try to find the shape. The line x + y = 1/2 intersects the diamond at (3/4, -1/4) and (-1/4, 3/4). So, in the first and second quadrants, the line cuts the diamond, creating a region.

Wait, maybe the area where x + y > 1/2 is a polygon with vertices at (3/4, -1/4), (-1/4, 3/4), and some other points? Or perhaps it's a triangle.

Wait, no, because the line x + y = 1/2 cuts through two edges of the diamond. So the region x + y > 1/2 is a polygon with four vertices: the two points where the line meets the diamond, and two other points where the line meets the diamond on the other edges.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The diamond's edges are:

1. x + y = 1 (top edge)
2. x - y = 1 (right edge)
3. -x + y = 1 (bottom edge)
4. -x - y =1 (left edge)

The line x + y = 1/2.

Let's see where this line intersects each edge:

- Intersecting x + y =1: Only if x + y = 1/2 and x + y =1 can't happen. So no intersection here.
- Intersecting x - y =1:
Solving x + y =1/2 and x - y =1:
Add them: 2x = 3/2 → x=3/4. Then y= (1/2 -3/4) = -1/4. So point (3/4, -1/4).
- Intersecting -x + y =1:
Solving x + y =1/2 and -x + y=1:
Adding: 2y= 3/2 → y=3/4. Then x= (1/2 - 3/4)= -1/4. So point (-1/4, 3/4).
- Intersecting -x - y=1:
Solving x + y =1/2 and -x - y=1:
Adding: 0= 3/2, which is impossible. So no intersection here.

So the line x + y =1/2 intersects the diamond at (3/4, -1/4) and (-1/4, 3/4).

Thus, the region x + y > 1/2 is bounded by these two points and the parts of the diamond where x + y >1/2.

So the shape is a quadrilateral with four points: (3/4, -1/4), (1,0), (0,1), (-1/4, 3/4), and back to (3/4, -1/4). Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the region is a polygon with vertices at (3/4, -1/4), (1,0), (0,1), (-1/4,3/4), and back to (3/4, -1/4). No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps the region is a polygon with vertices at (3/4, -1/4), (1,0), (0,1), and (-1/4, 3/4). Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to split the area into two triangles.

Wait, another approach: the line x + y =1/2 divides the diamond into two regions. One region where x + y >1/2 and the other where x + y <1/2. Because the line passes through two edges, the area where x + y >1/2 is a polygon that includes parts of the diamond in the top and left regions.

Wait, perhaps the area can be found by subtracting the area where x + y <=1/2 from the total area. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the area using integration.

Let me set up the integral. The diamond can be described in four regions where x ranges from -1 to 1, but perhaps it's easier to use symmetry and compute in the first quadrant and multiply by 4.

Wait, let me think about the diamond in the first quadrant. In the first quadrant, the diamond is bounded by x + y =1 and x >=0, y >=0. So the region x + y <=1 in the first quadrant is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1).

Wait, but the line x + y =1/2 in the first quadrant intersects this triangle at (1/2, 0) and (0, 1/2). So the area where x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant is a smaller triangle with vertices at (1/2,1/2), (1,0), and (0,1). Wait, no, because x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant would be the area above the line x + y =1/2.

Wait, no, in the first quadrant, x + y =1/2 cuts the square [0,1]x[0,1] (the first quadrant portion of the diamond) into two regions: one where x + y <=1/2 and x + y >=1/2.

So the area where x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant is the area above x + y =1/2, which is a triangle with vertices at (1/2, 0), (0, 1/2), and (1,1) but wait, wait, no. Wait, in the first quadrant, the diamond's portion is the triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1) is not part of the diamond. Wait, no, the diamond's first quadrant portion is actually a triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), as the diamond's boundary in the first quadrant is x + y =1.

Wait, in the first quadrant, the diamond's portion is the line from (1,0) to (0,1). So the line x + y =1/2 cuts this into two regions. The area where x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant would be a triangle with vertices at (1/2,0), (0,1/2), and (1,0) or (0,1)?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The line x + y =1/2 intersects the x-axis at (1/2,0) and the y-axis at (0,1/2). So the region x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant is the area above this line, which is a triangle with points (1/2, 0), (0, 1/2), and (1,0) or (0,1)? No, wait, in the first quadrant, the diamond's part is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), (0,1). The line x + y =1/2 cuts this into two parts. So the area where x + y >1/2 is a smaller triangle with vertices at (1/2, 0), (0, 1/2), and (0,0)? No, wait, that doesn't make sense because (0,0) is on the line x + y =1/2. Wait, no, (0,0) is not on x + y =1/2.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the line x + y =1/2 in the first quadrant. It starts at (1/2,0) on the x-axis and ends at (0,1/2) on the y-axis. The area where x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant is the area of the diamond's first quadrant portion (which is a triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (0,0)) minus the area under x + y =1/2. So the area where x + y >1/2 is the area of the big triangle minus the area under the line.

Wait, the area of the big triangle (first quadrant diamond) is 0.5 (base * height /2 = 1*1/2=0.5). The area under x + y <=1/2 in the first quadrant is a right triangle with legs of length 1/2. So area is (1/2 *1/2)/2=1/8.

So the area where x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant is 0.5 - 1/8 = 3/8.

Since the diamond is symmetric, each quadrant contributes 3/8, but wait, there are four quadrants, but the diamond is in all four, so the total area where x + y >1/2 is 4*(3/8) = 12/8 = 3/2. But the total area of the diamond is 2, so the probability would be (3/2) / 2= 3/4. But wait, that can't be because that would give 3/4, which is option E. But let me think if that's correct.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here because the area calculated is in the first quadrant, but the diamond is in all four. However, in each quadrant, the area where x + y >1/2 is 3/8, so four quadrants would give 4*(3/8) = 3/2. But the total area is 2, so 3/2 / 2 = 3/4. So the probability is 3/4, which is option E.

But wait, earlier I thought the area might be different, but perhaps this is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me cross-verify. The line x + y =1/2 passes through (3/4, -1/4) and (-1/4, 3/4) in the diamond. So the region x + y >1/2 is a polygon that includes parts of the diamond in the top-left and bottom-right areas.

Wait, but according to the calculation, it's a larger area than I expected. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area where x + y >1/2. Let me try another approach.

Instead of calculating in each quadrant, maybe I can find the area where x + y >1/2 in the entire diamond.

The diamond can be represented by the four inequalities: x + y <1, x - y <1, -x + y <1, and -x - y <1. But for the region x + y >1/2, we can use those inequalities.

But perhaps another approach: the diamond is a square with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1). The line x + y =1/2 cuts through the diamond, creating a polygonal region where x + y >1/2.

Let me think of the diamond as a square in the plane and find the area where x + y >1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the area where x + y <=1/2 and subtract it from the total area.

Wait, the line x + y =1/2 intersects the diamond's edges at (3/4, -1/4) and (-1/4, 3/4). So the region x + y <=1/2 is a polygon with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (0,0), and the line cuts through (3/4, -1/4) and (-1/4, 3/4).

Wait, perhaps the region x + y <=1/2 is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,1), (3/4, -1/4), (-1/4, 3/4), and (0,0). No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the area where x + y <=1/2 is a polygon bounded by (0,1), the line x + y =1/2 up to (3/4, -1/4), then along the diamond edge to (0,0), and then back along the other edge to (-1/4, 3/4). Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Maybe a better approach is to compute the area where x + y >1/2 within the diamond using integration.

Let me consider the diamond in the first quadrant, which is bounded by x + y <=1. The line x + y =1/2 intersects this in the first quadrant at (1/2, 0) and (0,1/2). So in the first quadrant, the area where x + y >1/2 is a triangle with vertices at (1/2, 0), (0,1/2), and (1,0), but wait, no. Wait, in the first quadrant, the diamond is a triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), and the line x + y =1/2 cuts this into two regions: one below and one above. The area above is a triangle with vertices (1/2,0), (0,1/2), and (1,0), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the area where x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant is a triangle with vertices at (1/2,0), (0,1/2), and (0,1)? No, that's not correct. Wait, no. Because in the first quadrant, the line x + y =1/2 is a straight line from (1/2,0) to (0,1/2). So the area where x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant is a triangle bounded by (0,1), (1/2,0), and (0,1/2), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area where x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant using integration. Let's set up the integral in the first quadrant.

In the first quadrant, the diamond's boundary is x + y =1. The line x + y =1/2 intersects this at (1/2, 0) and (0,1/2). So the area where x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant is the area above x + y =1/2, which is a region bounded by (1/2,0), (0,1/2), and (1,1) but (1,1) is not part of the diamond. Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute this area using geometry.

Wait, in the first quadrant, the region x + y >1/2 is a trapezoid. The trapezoid has two parallel sides: one from (1/2,0) to (0,1/2), and another from (1,0) to (0,1). Wait, no, that's not correct because (1,0) is part of the diamond's boundary, but x + y =1/2 doesn't reach there. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is a triangle with vertices at (1/2,0), (0,1/2), and (1,1), but (1,1) is not part of the diamond. So perhaps the area is a smaller triangle. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the area where x + y >1/2 is the union of two triangles in the diamond. Let me try to compute the area using integration.

In the first quadrant, the diamond is bounded by y = 1 - x. The line x + y =1/2 is y = 1/2 - x.

The area where x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant is the area between y = 1/2 - x and y =1 -x, but only in the region where y >=1/2 -x and y <=1 -x.

Wait, but in the first quadrant, x ranges from 0 to1, and y from0 to1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the area in the first quadrant where x + y >1/2, then multiply by four.

Wait, let's compute the area where x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant. The region is a polygon with vertices at (0,1), (1/2, 0), and (0,1/2). No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the area where x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant is a triangle with vertices at (0,1/2), (1/2,0), and (1,1), but again, (1,1) is not part of the diamond.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The line x + y =1/2 in the first quadrant is from (1/2,0) to (0,1/2). The region x + y >1/2 is the area above this line, which is a triangle with vertices at (1/2,0), (0,1/2), and (1,1), but (1,1) is not part of the diamond. So this approach seems incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the area in the first quadrant where x + y >1/2 by integrating.

The line x + y =1/2 in the first quadrant is y =1/2 - x. The region where x + y >1/2 is where y >1/2 -x.

So for x from 0 to1/2, y ranges from 1/2 -x to1. For x from1/2 to1, y ranges from1/2 -x to1. But wait, no, because when x exceeds1/2, 1/2 -x becomes negative, and y can't be negative in the first quadrant. So for x from1/2 to1, y ranges from0 to1, but y >1/2 -x is automatically satisfied since 1/2 -x is negative.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the area in the first quadrant where x + y >1/2 by integrating the area above y =1/2 -x.

The integral would be from x =0 to x=1/2, y from y=1/2 -x to y=1.

And from x =1/2 to x=1, y from y=0 to y=1.

Wait, but in reality, for x from0 to1/2, y goes from1/2 -x to1, which is valid. But for x from1/2 to1, since y can't be negative, but y >1/2 -x is automatically true because 1/2 -x is negative, so y >=0 is already satisfied. So the area where x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant is the sum of these two integrals.

Let's compute the first integral: x from0 to1/2, y from1/2 -x to1.

The integral of (1 - (1/2 -x)) dx from0 to1/2.

Which is integral of (1 -1/2 +x) dx = integral of (x +1/2) dx.

Integrating from0 to1/2 gives:

[x²/2 + (1/2)x] from0 to1/2.

At 1/2:

( (1/2)^2 )/2 + (1/2)(1/2) = (1/4)/2 + (1/4) = 1/8 + 1/4 = 3/8.

At 0, it's 0 +0.

So the integral is 3/8.

Now the second integral: x from1/2 to1, y from0 to1.

The integral is 1 * (1 -1/2) =1*(1/2)=1/2.

So the total area in the first quadrant where x + y >1/2 is 3/8 +1/2 =3/8 +4/8=7/8.

But wait, the total area of the diamond in the first quadrant is 0.5 (since the diamond is a square of area 1, but in the first quadrant, it's 0.5). Wait, no. Wait, the diamond's first quadrant portion is a triangle with area 0.5. So if the area where x + y >1/2 in the first quadrant is7/8, which is larger than the total area of the first quadrant part (0.5), that can't be possible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no. The area in the first quadrant where x + y >1/2 is 3/8, as calculated earlier. So the probability in the first quadrant is3/8 divided by the area of the first quadrant part of the diamond, which is0.5. So (3/8)/0.5= (3/8)/(1/2)= (3/8)*(2/1)=6/8=3/4.

Ah, so the probability in the first quadrant is3/4. Since the diamond is symmetric, the same applies to the other three quadrants. So the total area where x + y >1/2 is4*(3/4 *0.5) ? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, in the first quadrant, the area where x + y >1/2 is3/8. The total area of the diamond is2. So the probability in the first quadrant is3/8 / (0.5) = (3/8)/(1/2) = (3/8)*(2/1) )=6/8=3/4.

So the probability that a point in the diamond satisfies x + y >1/2 is3/4. Therefore, the probability that 2(x + y) >1 is the same as the probability that x + y >1/2, which is3/4. So the answer is E.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the area where x + y >1/2 in the entire diamond is3/2, but that's incorrect because the total area of the diamond is2, so 3/2 can't be the probability. So that must have been a mistake.

So, after correcting my approach, I now believe that the correct answer is E, 3/4.
</think>

The region described by the inequality \(0 < x < 1\), \(0 < y < 1\), and \(x + y < 1\) is a diamond with vertices at \((0,0)\), \((1,0)\), \((0,1)\), and \((1,1)\), but the inequality \(x + y < 1\) describes a triangle within this diamond. The area of this triangle is \(\frac{1}{2}\).

The problem asks for the probability that \(2(x + y) > 1\), which simplifies to \(x + y > \frac{1}{2}\). This inequality describes the region within the diamond where the sum of \(x\) and \(y\) exceeds \(\frac{1}{2}\).

To find the area where \(x + y > \frac{1}{2}\) within the diamond, we analyze the diamond's structure:
1. The diamond is symmetric across both the line \(y = x\) and the line \(y = -x\).
2. The line \(x + y = \frac{1}{2}\) intersects the diamond at points \((\frac{1}{2}, 0)\) and \((0, \frac{1}{2})\).
3. The area where \(x + y > \frac{1}{2}\) within the diamond is a quadrilateral bounded by the lines \(x + y = 1\), \(x + y = \frac{1}{2}\), and the diamond's edges.

By symmetry, the area where \(x + y > \frac{1}{2}\) within the diamond is three-fourths of the total area of the diamond. Therefore, the probability that \(2(x + y) > 1\) is \(\frac{3}{4}\).

ANSWER: E
