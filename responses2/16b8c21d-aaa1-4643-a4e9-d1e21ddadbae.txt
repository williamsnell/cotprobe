Okay, so I've got this question asking for the median of a set of data. The numbers given are $79.88, $21.88, $29.88, $19.88, and $17.88. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers. So, I need to arrange these numbers in order from smallest to largest. Let me list them out: 17.88, 19.88, 21.88, 29.88, 79.88. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 17.88 is the smallest, then 19.88, then 21.88, then 29.88, and the largest is 79.88. So the list is already in ascending order. 

Since there are five numbers, the median will be the third one. Let's count them: first is 17.88 (1), second is 19.88 (2), third is 21.88 (3), then 29.88 and 79.88. So the third number is 21.88. Looking at the options provided, option H is $21.88. So the median should be option H.

The median is the middle value when data is ordered. Here, the numbers in order are 17.88, 19.88, 21.88, 29.88, 79.88. The middle value (third number) is **21.88**, which corresponds to **H: $21.88**.

Answer: H
