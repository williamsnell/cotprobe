Alright, I need to figure out the answer to this question: "What is the oldest permanent European settlement in the United States?" The options are from A to J.

First, I'll go through each option one by one. Let's start by recalling some of the oldest European settlements in the U.S.

I remember that Jamestown, Virginia, was one of the earliest permanent European settlements. It was established in 1607. I think it's the oldest in the U.S., though I'm not entirely sure if it's the oldest overall or just the oldest in this list.

Looking at the options:
- Option E is Jamestown, Virginia. That sounds familiar as the oldest.
- Option A is Charlotte, North Carolina. Charlotte is another oldest settlement, but I think it's a bit later than Jamestown.
- Option I is Plymouth, Massachusetts. Plymouth comes after Jamestown, so it's older.
- Option B is San Juan, Puerto Rico. That's actually in the Caribbean, not the U.S.
- Option C is Savannah, Georgia. Savannah is a more recent settlement, not the oldest.
- Option D is Santa Fe, New Mexico. Santa Fe is from Mexico, so it's not in the U.S. context.
- Option F is St Augustine, Florida. St. Augustine is a later settlement, not the oldest.
- Option G is Newport News, Virginia. Newport News is a bit older than Jamestown, but it's later than some other options.
- Option H is New York, New York. New York City isn't a settlement; it's a city. Also, it's much newer than the others.
- Option J is Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia is an older settlement, but it's in the 1600s, so probably after Jamestown.

So, Jamestown, Virginia, is the oldest permanent European settlement in the U.S. Therefore, the correct answer should be option E.
