Okay, so I'm trying to solve this related rates problem. Let me see. The question is about Julian jogging around a circular track. The track has a radius of 50 meters. We're given his coordinates (40,30) at a certain moment. His x-coordinate is changing at a rate of -1.25 m/s, and we need to find dy/dt at that moment.

Hmm, right, this is a related rates problem involving circular motion. So, the path is a circle, so the equation is x² + y² = r². Since the radius is 50, the equation is x² + y² = 2500.

Now, we can take derivatives of both sides with respect to time t. So, d/dt (x² + y²) = d/dt (2500). That means 2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0, because the derivative of a constant is zero.

So, simplifying that equation, we can write x dx/dt + y dy/dt = 0. Then, solving for dy/dt gives dy/dt = (-x dx/dt) / y.

Wait, let me make sure. From 2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0, divide both sides by 2: x dx/dt + y dy/dt = 0. So, moving x dx/dt to the other side: y dy/dt = -x dx/dt. Therefore, dy/dt = (-x dx/dt) / y.

Now, we have the values at the moment we're considering. His x-coordinate is 40 and the rate dx/dt is -1.25 m/s. We need to find y. Oh wait, since the point is (40,30), y is 30. So, substituting into the equation:

dy/dt = (-40 * (-1.25)) / 30.

Wait, let me compute that. Let's see: -40 multiplied by -1.25 is 50, because 40 * 1.25 is 50. So, 50 divided by 30 is 5/3, which is approximately 1.666... But wait, let me check.

Wait no, wait, because dx/dt is negative, so I think I made a mistake in the signs. Let me re-express the equation.

Wait, from earlier steps, we have:

x dx/dt + y dy/dt = 0 → y dy/dt = -x dx/dt → dy/dt = (-x dx/dt) / y.

So, substituting x =40, dx/dt = -1.25, y=30.

So, dy/dt = ( -40 * (-1.25) ) / 30 → (50) /30 → 5/3 ≈ 1.666... m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 1.667, which is 5/3. But wait, let me make sure the signs are correct.

Wait, the point is (40,30). So, x=40, y=30. So, when we plug into the equation:

dy/dt = (-40 * (-1.25)) / 30 → positive. So, 50/30 = 5/3 ≈1.666. So, that's about 1.667.

Looking at the options, option I is 1.667. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes with circular motion, the signs can be tricky. Let me think: when moving around a circle, the direction of motion affects the sign of dy/dt.

Wait, but in this problem, I think the setup is that the track is circular, and the point (40,30) is somewhere on the circle. Since the radius is 50, and 40² + 30² is 1600 +900=2500, which matches the radius squared.

So, now, when a point is on the circle, the velocity vector is tangential. So, the direction of velocity depends on the position and the angle. The x and y components of velocity would be related to each other.

But in the problem, dx/dt is given as -1.25 m/s. So, that's the rate of change of x with respect to time. So, if dx/dt is negative, that means x is decreasing over time. So, the point is moving in a direction where x is decreasing.

Wait, but let's think about the direction of motion. When x is positive, and the track is a circle, the point (40,30) is in the first quadrant. So, if the motion is such that x is decreasing, the point is moving clockwise around the circle. Because if you're moving clockwise, the x-coordinate decreases as time increases.

Wait, but the sign of dx/dt is negative, which matches that. So, the point is moving clockwise, and thus, the y-coordinate is increasing. Because as you move clockwise, the y-coordinate goes from 30 to 40, right? Wait, no, wait, actually, moving clockwise would cause the y-coordinate to decrease, but wait, let me think.

Wait, another way: if you're moving clockwise, then at a given moment, moving further clockwise would cause the x to decrease and the y to decrease as well, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation, because in the problem, we are just given rates, not the direction of motion, but the setup is that the point is moving around the circle, so the derivatives are calculated accordingly.

But regardless of the direction, the calculation gives dy/dt as 5/3, which is about 1.666..., which is 1.667. Looking at the options, option I is 1.667, option G is 2.0, option F is 1.25, I think.

Wait, but the problem is whether the y-coordinate is increasing or decreasing. Since the point is at (40,30), and the radius is 50, moving around the circle. Let's find the angle θ where x=40, y=30. So, tan θ = y/x = 30/40 = 3/4. So, θ is arctangent of 3/4, which is about 36.87 degrees. So, the point is in the first quadrant.

Now, moving around the circle clockwise, the next point would have a smaller x and a larger y? Or not. Wait, actually, when moving clockwise, the x decreases, and the y increases. Wait, no, let me think. Suppose you are moving from (50,0) to (0,50) in a clockwise direction. Wait, no, perhaps I should use the parametrization.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of the formula. Let's compute the signs.

Wait, let me be precise. The equation is x² + y² = 2500. The point is at (40,30). So, the velocity components are based on the parametrization of the circle. Wait, but perhaps another approach: since we have x=40, y=30, and the equation is x² + y² = 2500.

So, dy/dt = (-x dx/dt)/y → plugging in the numbers:

dy/dt = (-40 * (-1.25)) / 30 → (50)/30 = 5/3 ≈1.6667.

Wait, but the options are all positive or negative. So, 5/3 is about 1.6667, which is option I (1.667). But wait, looking at the options:

Options:

A: -2.5

B: 0.833

C:2.5

D:0.625

E:3.0

F:1.25

G:2.0

H:-1.667

I:1.667

J:-0.833

So, 1.667 is option I. So, the answer must be option I:1.667.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the question is to find dy/dt. So, based on the calculation, dy/dt is positive 1.667. So, the answer is I.

The problem involves a circular track with Julian jogging, and we're tasked with finding the rate at which his y-coordinate (dy/dt) is changing. Using the equation of the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 2500\), we differentiate both sides with respect to time to get \(2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \frac{dy}{dt} = 0\). Solving for \(\frac{dy}{dt}\) gives \(\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{-x \frac{dx}{dt}}{y}\). Substituting \(x = 40\), \(\frac{dx}{dt} = -1.25\), and \(y = 30\) into this equation yields \(\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{50}{30} \approx 1.667\). Among the options, the correct value is 1.667, which corresponds to option I.
