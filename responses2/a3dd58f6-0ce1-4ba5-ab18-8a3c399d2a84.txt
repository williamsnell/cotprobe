Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about the home runs hit by the Boston Red Sox in eight consecutive games. The numbers given are 2, 3, 0, 3, 4, 1, 3, 0. I need to find the mean, median, and mode, and then choose the correct option from A to J.

Starting with part (a), the mean. The mean is calculated by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by how many numbers there are. So first, let me add them up. The numbers are 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0.

Adding them: 2 +3 =5, plus 0 is 5, plus 3 is 8, plus 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13, plus 3 is 16, plus 0 is 16. So the total is 16. There are 8 games, so the mean is 16 divided by 8. 16/8 is 2. So the mean is 2. 

Wait, but let me check the options again. Looking at the options, option I says mean is 2, median is 1.5, mode is 2. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check the mean.

Wait, the sum: 2+3 is 5, +0 is 5, +3 is 8, +4 is 12, +1 is 13, +3 is 16, +0 is 16. Yes, that's correct. 16 divided by 8 is 2. So mean is 2.

But looking at the options, option I's mean is 2, median 1.5, mode 2. Hmm. Let me check the median first.

For the median, I need to arrange the numbers in order. The numbers are 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0. Let me sort them: 0,0,1,2,3,3,3,4. Now, since there are 8 numbers, the median will be the average of the 4th and 5th terms. The 4th term is 2, the 5th is 3. So (2+3)/2 is 2.5. So median is 2.5.

Wait, but wait. The options don't have all the examples. Option F says mean is 2.5, median 2, mode 3. Wait, why? Because in my calculation, the median is 2.5. So perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me recheck the median calculation. The data after sorting is 0,0,1,2,3,3,3,4. The 4th term is 2, the 5th is 3. So (2+3)/2 is 2.5. So median is indeed 2.5.

So the correct median would be 2.5. Looking back at the options, option F says median 2, which is incorrect. So perhaps none of the options have 2.5 as median. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: Mean:3, Median:3, Mode:3.

B: Mean:2.5, Median:3, Mode:0.

C: Mean:3, Median:2, Mode:1.

D: Mean:1, Median:2, Mode:4.

E: Mean:2.16, Median:2, Mode:3.

F: Mean:2.5, Median:2, Mode:3.

Wait, option F says median 2. But according to my calculation, the median is 2.5. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the median. Let me recount. The sorted data is 0,0,1,2,3,3,3,4. That's 8 numbers. The two middle numbers are the 4th and 5th. 4th is 2, 5th is 3. So average is 2.5. So the median is 2.5.

So none of the options have median 2.5. So perhaps I made a mistake in the data arrangement.

Wait, let me recheck the initial data. The numbers are 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0. So that's 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0. Let me count them again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should arrange them in order again.

Numbers: 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0.

Sorted: 0,0,1,2,3,3,3,4.

So yes, 8 numbers. So the two middle numbers are 4th and 5th. 4th is 2, 5th is 3. So average is 2.5.

Hmm, so none of the options have median 2.5. Wait, looking at the options again, option F has median 2. That's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial data. Let me check again. The data is 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0.

Wait, perhaps I missed a number. Let me count: 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0. That's 8 numbers. So I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the median is calculated as the middle of the sorted list. Since 8 is even, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th. So 2 and 3, average 2.5.

So the median is 2.5. Now looking at the options, none of them have 2.5 as median. Wait, but option F says median 2, which can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the mean and median again.

Mean: sum is 2+3=5 +0=5 +3=8 +4=12 +1=13 +3=16 +0=16. So 16. 16 divided by 8 is 2. So mean is 2.

Median: as earlier, 2.5.

Looking at the options, perhaps I should check which option has mean 2, median 2.5, and mode 3. But looking at the options, none do that. Let me look again.

Option F: Mean 2.5, median 2, mode 3. So not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the median calculation. Wait, perhaps I have 8 numbers, so the middle is between 4th and 5th. So 4th is 2, 5th is 3. So 2.5.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the data in the wrong order. Let me list them again sorted:

0, 0, 1, 2, 3,3,3,4.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the median as the middle value, but in a sorted list of 8, the median is average of 4th and 5th. So perhaps the correct median is 2.5.

But the options do not have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, the numbers are 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0. So that's 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0. So total of 8 games, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recount the numbers again. Let me write them: 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0.

So that's 8 numbers. So the sorted list is 0,0,1,2,3,3,3,4. So 4th and 5th numbers are 2 and 3. So (2+3)/2 = 2.5.

So the median is 2.5.

Now, looking for an option with mean 2, median 2.5, and mode 3. But none of the options have that. Wait, looking at options, perhaps option F is the closest. It says mean 2.5, median 2, mode 3. But that would be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem says eight consecutive games. The numbers are 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0. So I think the data is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is option F's mean and median, but that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the median calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the median. Oh wait! Wait, perhaps the median is the middle of the two middle numbers when the data is ordered. So with 8 numbers, it's the average of the 4th and 5th. So 4th is 2, 5th is 3. So average is 2.5.

So the median is 2.5. Now, looking for an option where mean is 2, median is 2.5, and mode is 3. But none of the options have this. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: Mean 3, Median 3, Mode 3.

B: Mean 2.5, Median 3, Mode 0.

C: Mean 3, Median 2, Mode 1.

D: Mean 1, Median 2, Mode 4.

E: Mean 2.16, Median 2, Mode 3.

F: Mean 2.5, Median 2, Mode 3.

G: Mean 2, Median 3, Mode 0.

H: Mean 1.5, Median 2, Mode 3.

I: Mean 2, Median 1.5, Mode 2.

J: Mean 2, Median 2.5, Mode 3.

Wait, option J says median 2.5, mode 3, mean 2. Which matches my calculations. So option J has mean 2, median 2.5, mode 3.

But let me check the options again. Oh wait, the options are from A to J, and each option is a single choice. So if the correct answer is option J, then the correct answer is option J.

But I thought the mean is 2, median 2.5, mode 3. So option J matches this.

Wait, let's recheck the mode. The mode is the number that appears most frequently. Looking at the data: 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0. So 0 appears twice, 3 appears three times. So mode is 3.

Yes, that's correct. So the mode is 3.

So for option J, the mean is 2, median 2.5, mode 3. Which matches our calculations.

Wait, but looking back to the options, option F has mean 2.5, which is not correct. So option J is the correct one.

But wait, let's see the options again:

Option F: Mean:2.5, Median:2, Mode:3.

Option J: Mean:2, Median:2.5, Mode:3.

So the correct answer is option J.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the median was 2.5. Option J's median is 2.5, so that's correct.

But wait, the user's options list option F as mean 2.5, median 2, mode 3. So perhaps I made a mistake in the median calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the data again. Let me list the numbers again: 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0. So when sorted: 0,0,1,2,3,3,3,4.

So 4th term is 2, 5th term is 3. So the median is (2+3)/2=2.5.

So option J is correct.

But looking back, the initial question has option J: mean 2, median 2.5, mode 3.

So the correct answer is option J.

The correct answer is option J: Mean: 2, Median: 2.5, Mode: 3.
