Question:

What was the primary reason the Green Revolution did NOT help Africa much?

Options:

A: African farmers were not trained to use the new agricultural methods.
B: It required sophisticated machinery.
C: The Green Revolution was not implemented in Africa due to political instability.
D: It targeted crops Africans don't grow and eat.
E: The technologies used in the Green Revolution were not compatible with African soil.
F: The Green Revolution did help Africa, but its impact was not significant.
G: African agricultural production went up without its help.
H: It only targeted arid regions, which are not common in Africa.
I: Population growth has fallen so drastically that Africans don't need the increased food production.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about the Green Revolution's impact on Africa. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what was the primary reason the Green Revolution did NOT help Africa much. The options are A to I, with F being an option. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says African farmers weren't trained. I remember reading that the Green Revolution did involve training, especially through crop rotation and pest control, which helped farmers. So this probably isn't the correct answer.

Option B: It required sophisticated machinery. The Green Revolution definitely used machinery, like tractors and machinery like the plow. But I'm not sure if that's the main reason it didn't help. Maybe it's more about the training aspect than the machinery itself.

Option C: Political instability. I don't think Africa was politically unstable when the Green Revolution started. Factories and large operations were possible, so C is probably not it.

Option D: It targeted crops that Africans don't grow. I'm not sure about this. The Green Revolution included crops like wheat and rye, which are more common in many African countries. So D might not be right.

Option E: Technologies incompatible with African soil. I remember reading that the technologies used, like chemical treatments and fertilizers, were actually better suited for other crops like rice. So this might be the main reason the Green Revolution didn't help Africa much.

Option F: Impact was not significant. I think the Green Revolution did have a huge impact on Africa. It increased food production, reduced hunger, and led to a significant improvement in the quality of life. So F seems unlikely.

Option G: Production went up. I'm pretty sure the Green Revolution did lead to increased agricultural output. So G is probably not the right answer.

Option H: Targeted arid regions. The Green Revolution included dry seasons too, like the drying up of the Nile, so it's not limited to arid regions.

Option I: Population growth. The population growth in Africa was declining, which is why food production increased. So I might be thinking that this was a factor, but I'm not sure if it's the primary reason the Green Revolution didn't help.

Wait, going back. The primary reason the Green Revolution didn't help Africa much is probably because the technology wasn't compatible with the existing soil. The techniques didn't work as well in the soil that African farmers were growing. For example, soil fertility was low, and the chemicals used in the Green Revolution (like urea) might not have been effective. So the answer should be E.

The primary reason the Green Revolution did not help Africa much was because the technologies were not compatible with the African soil. The techniques used, such as certain chemicals, were less effective in the soil that African farmers were growing.

Answer: E
