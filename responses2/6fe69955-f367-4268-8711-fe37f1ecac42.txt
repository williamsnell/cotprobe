Okay, so I have this economics question here about the impact of a change in government spending on real output. Hmm, I remember that government spending is a component of aggregate demand, so an increase in it should tend to stimulate the economy. But wait, this is about the short run impact, so things like prices and wages might come into play.

The question is asking when a change in government spending will have a greater short run impact on real output. The options are A through G, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me think about the factors that influence the short-run impact. I remember that the spending multiplier is a key concept here. The spending multiplier formula is 1/(1 - MPC), where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume. So if the MPC is higher (meaning people spend more of their income), the multiplier is larger, making the impact on output greater when government spending changes.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the MPC is lower. That would mean a smaller multiplier, so the impact on real output would be less. So this is the opposite of what we want.

Option D says the MPC is larger. That would make the multiplier bigger, so the impact on output is greater. That seems right.

Option B says the velocity of money is lower. Velocity of money affects how quickly money circulates. Lower velocity means people spend less, so maybe that reduces overall spending. But how does that affect the short-run impact on output? I'm a bit fuzzy here. I think velocity affects the money supply, but the spending multiplier is more directly related to MPC. Unless velocity affects the velocity of income, but I'm not sure. Maybe this is an indirect factor, but the direct impact on the multiplier is through MPC.

Option A says the fiscal policy is expansionary. Well, expansionary policy increases aggregate demand, which should lead to higher output. But the question is about the magnitude of the impact, not whether it's expansionary. So if the policy is expansionary, it would have a positive impact, but again, the question is about when it's a greater impact. So this might not be the right factor.

Option E says the exchange rate is higher. Higher exchange rates could make exports cheaper, increasing them, but imports would become more expensive. So it might affect net exports. But how does that impact the multiplier? Maybe it's a minor effect compared to other factors like MPC. Not directly related to the multiplier the same way as MPC.

Option F says the trade balance is negative. A negative trade balance means imports exceed exports, so net exports are negative. That would reduce aggregate demand because net exports are subtracted from aggregate expenditure. So that would reduce the impact on output. So not the right option.

Option G says the inflation rate is higher. Higher inflation affects the purchasing power of money and could lead to higher interest rates, but I'm not sure how that directly affects the spending multiplier. It might indirectly influence spending by reducing the real interest rate, but that's more of a long-term effect. The question is about the short run impact, so I'm not sure G is the answer.

Putting it all together, the correct factor should be the MPC. So if the MPC is higher (option D), the spending multiplier is larger, leading to a greater short-run impact on real output. 

Wait, but I thought the MPC is the proportion of income that's spent. So if people spend more (higher MPC), the multiplier is bigger. So yes, D is correct.

To determine when a change in government spending will have a greater short-run impact on real output, we consider the role of the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). The spending multiplier, which indicates how much output changes in response to changes in spending, is calculated as \( \frac{1}{1 - \text{MPC}} \). A higher MPC leads to a larger multiplier, thereby increasing the short-run impact on real output.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C (MPC is lower):** A lower MPC results in a smaller multiplier, reducing the impact on output.
- **Option D (MPC is larger):** A larger MPC leads to a greater multiplier, increasing the impact on output.
- **Option B (Velocity of money is lower):** While lower velocity might reduce overall spending, it is less directly tied to the spending multiplier than MPC.
- **Option A (Fiscal policy is expansionary):** Expansionary policy increases aggregate demand, but this question asks about the magnitude of the impact, not the type of policy.
- **Option E (Exchange rate is higher):** Higher exchange rates can affect net exports but are less directly related to the spending multiplier.
- **Option F (Trade balance is negative):** A negative trade balance reduces net exports, which decreases overall spending.
- **Option G (Inflation rate is higher):** Higher inflation might influence interest rates but is not directly tied to the spending multiplier in the short run.

The correct factor is **Option D**, as a higher MPC leads to a larger multiplier, resulting in a greater short-run impact on real output.
