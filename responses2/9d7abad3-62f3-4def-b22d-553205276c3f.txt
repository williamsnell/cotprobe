Okay, so I've got this question about population genetics, and I'm a bit new to this topic. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking how to determine if a population is in genetic equilibrium. I remember that genetic equilibrium means that the frequencies of alleles in the population don't change from generation to generation. So the key point is that there's no change in allele frequencies because factors like mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, selection, etc., are not acting on the population.

Looking at the options, I need to find the method that checks for these factors. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Measure physical characteristics. That doesn't quite ring a bell. I think measuring traits helps in evolution, maybe in natural selection or heritable traits, but I'm not sure if that's how genetic equilibrium is determined. It doesn't directly relate to allele frequencies.

Option B: Compare to a different species. That's more about speciation or classification. Not directly about genetic equilibrium.

Option C: Disease resistance comparison. Hmm, that's interesting. If a population has a disease that's more prevalent in certain areas, maybe it's more likely to adapt to those environments. But does that relate to genetic equilibrium? I don't think so. It's more about adaptation and possibly selection against the disease.

Option D: Check for natural selection. Wait, natural selection affects allele frequencies because it changes which individuals survive and reproduce. So if natural selection is acting, allele frequencies would change. But genetic equilibrium is when there's no change, so if we see natural selection, that would mean the population isn't in equilibrium. So this option seems related but maybe it's the opposite scenario.

Option E: Compare gene frequencies over two generations. Oh, that makes sense. If the frequencies are the same between generations, that suggests no change. Because if selection, mutation, drift, etc., are acting, the frequencies would shift. So measuring the same frequencies after a generation change would indicate equilibrium.

Option F: Analyze fossil record. Fossils might show evolutionary relationships, but they don't directly tell us about genetic equilibrium. Plus, they can date evolutionary events but not necessarily tell us about allele frequencies.

Option G: Observe mating patterns. Mating can affect allele frequencies, especially in sexual populations. But again, it's not the direct method to check for equilibrium.

Option H: Age distribution and life expectancies. That's more about population health and survival rates, not directly about allele frequencies. So probably not relevant here.

Option I: Monitor climate changes. That's an environmental factor, but it's not about genetic equilibrium itself. Unless climate affects allele frequencies, but that's a broader issue.

Option J: Study migration. Migration can change allele frequencies because it brings in new alleles or changes the population structure. So, not directly related.

Putting it all together, the best option seems to be E. Because if the gene frequencies remain the same after a generation, it suggests that the forces that change them (like natural selection, mutation, etc.) aren't acting anymore, meaning the population is in genetic equilibrium.

To determine whether a population is in genetic equilibrium, we need a method that assesses whether allele frequencies remain stable. Genetic equilibrium occurs when factors like mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and selection do not alter allele frequencies. 

Analyzing the options, the most relevant method is **Option E: Compare gene frequencies and genotype frequencies over two generations**. If the frequencies remain unchanged, it indicates that no active evolutionary forces are acting on the population, confirming genetic equilibrium.

Answer: E
