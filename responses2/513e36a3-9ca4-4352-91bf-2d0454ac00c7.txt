Alright, so I've got this question about a bank's reserve ratio and excess reserves. Let me break it down step by step. 

Okay, the question says the bank has $500 in checking deposits and is required to hold $50 in reserves. I need to find two things: the reserve ratio and the excess reserves. 

Wait, I think the reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that the bank must keep as reserves. So, the formula for reserve ratio is (Reserves / Deposits) * 100. 

In this case, Reserves are $50 and Deposits are $500. Let me calculate that: 50 divided by 500 equals 0.1. Multiply by 100 gives me 10%. So the reserve ratio is 10%. That's answer option B or another one? Looking at the options, B is 10% and $50 in excess reserves. But wait, I need to find the excess reserves as well.

Excess reserves are the amount the bank has more than it's required to hold in reserves. So if the bank's deposits are $500 and it has to hold $50, the excess is $500 minus $50, which is $450. So the excess reserves would be $450.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E says $100 in excess reserves. That doesn't match what I'm calculating. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again. The question is asking for the reserve ratio, which is 10%, and the excess reserves, which is $450. But none of the options have $450 in excess. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the options again. 

The options are A-F, and the question will have an answer choice that includes the correct numbers. Let me look again.

Wait, in the options, option E says $100 in excess, but according to my calculation, it should be $450. But looking at the options, option E is 10% and $100? No, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Reserves = $50, deposits = $500.

Reserve ratio = 50 / 500 = 0.1 â†’ 10%. So the reserve ratio is 10%, which is option B's first part.

For excess reserves, it's deposits minus reserves. So 500 - 50 = 450. So the excess is $450. But looking at the options, none have $450 in excess. Let me check the options again.

Option E: 10% and $100? No, that's not right. Option I: 10% and $450? Wait, I don't see option I. Let me check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A: 5% $475

B: 10% $50

C: 30% $350

D: 60% $200

E: 80% $100

F: 50% $250

G: 90% $450

H: 20% $400

I:10% $450

J:90% $50

Wait, option I is 10% and $450 in excess? So according to that, the correct answer would be option I, but wait, am I mixing up anything?

Wait, the question is presented as: "What is the reserve ratio? How much does the bank have in excess reserves?"

Options are given as A to J, each with a percentage and an amount. The correct answer should match both the reserve ratio and the excess reserves.

So if the reserve ratio is 10%, then looking for the option where the first part is 10%. Options B and I are both 10% (B is $50, I is $450). 

Now, the excess reserves, according to my calculation, is $450. So which option has 10% and $450? Looking at the options, option I says 10% and $450. So that's option I.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the question is about the reserve ratio and the excess. So the correct answer is the option where the first part is 10% and the second part is $450.

Looking at the options, option I is 10% and $450. So that's the correct answer. So the answer is option I, which will have the correct two values.

The question requires calculating the reserve ratio and the excess reserves for a bank with $500 in checking deposits and $50 in required reserves. 

1. **Reserve Ratio**: The formula is (Reserves / Deposits) * 100. 
   - Reserves = $50, Deposits = $500.
   - Reserve Ratio = (50 / 500) * 100 = 10%.

2. **Excess Reserves**: This is calculated as (Deposits - Reserves).
   - Excess Reserves = $500 - $50 = $450.

Now, checking the options:
- **Option I** states 10% for the reserve ratio and $450 for excess reserves.

Thus, the correct answer is **I**.

ANSWER: I
