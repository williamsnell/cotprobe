Okay, so I have this probability problem here where I need to find the probability that 5 different integers chosen from between 20 and 69 have each a different tens digit. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should figure out the range of numbers we're dealing with. The integers are from 20 to 69, inclusive. Let me calculate how many numbers that is. From 20 to 69, that's 69 - 20 + 1 = 50 numbers. So, there are 50 integers to choose from.

Now, the problem is about choosing 5 different integers. The total number of ways to choose these 5 numbers is the combination of 50 taken 5 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), so the total number of possible outcomes is C(50, 5). I'll need to calculate that later, but for now, I can note it down.

Next, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the selections where all 5 numbers have different tens digits. The tens digits in this range are from 2 (for 20-29) up to 6 (for 60-69). So, the possible tens digits are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 — that's 5 different tens digits.

Wait, but we're choosing 5 numbers, each from a different tens group. So, each number must come from a unique tens group. Since there are exactly 5 tens groups (2,3,4,5,6) and we're choosing 5 numbers, each must come from a different group.

So, the first step is to choose one number from each of these 5 tens groups. Let me break it down:

- For the tens digit 2: numbers are 20-29, which is 10 numbers.
- For 3: 30-39, 10 numbers.
- Similarly, 4,5,6 each have 10 numbers.

But wait, the question is about choosing 5 numbers, each from a different tens group. So, we have to pick one number from each of the five groups. Since each group has 10 numbers, the number of ways to choose one from each is 10^5, because each group contributes 10 choices.

Wait, but the problem says 5 different integers, each with a different tens digit. So, each of the five selected numbers must have a unique tens digit. Since there are 5 tens digits (2,3,4,5,6), each selected number must come from a distinct group. So, the number of favorable outcomes is indeed 10^5, because for each tens digit, we choose one number from that group. Since each group has 10 numbers, that's 10 choices per group, and 5 groups, so 10^5 = 100,000.

But wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because when you choose 5 numbers, each from a different group, the order in which you choose them doesn't matter. So, the total number of favorable outcomes is the product of the number of choices for each group. Since each group has 10 numbers, and we have 5 groups, the total number is 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 = 10^5 = 100,000. But wait, no—because the numbers are being chosen, and the order doesn't matter, so perhaps I should think of it as a permutation. Hmm, maybe not. Because each selection is independent, so the total number is indeed 10^5.

Wait, but I think I need to clarify this. Let me try another approach. Since each selection must have one number from each of the five tens groups, the number of ways to do this is:

We have to pick one number from each of the 5 groups. The number of ways to do that is 10 (for group 2) × 10 (group 3) × 10 (group 4) × 10 (group 5) × 10 (group6) = 10^5 = 100,000.

But wait, when selecting, the order doesn't matter. So, wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you select 5 numbers, each from a different group, each group contributes exactly one number, so the total number of favorable outcomes is indeed 10^5. Because for each of the 5 groups, you choose one number, and the choices are independent.

So, the number of favorable outcomes is 10^5 = 100,000.

Now, the total number of possible ways to choose 5 numbers from 50 is C(50,5). Let me calculate that. The formula for combinations is:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)! )

So, C(50,5) = 50! / (5! * 45!) 

Calculating that:

50 × 49 × 48 × 47 × 46 / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) 

Let me compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 50 ×49=2450; 2450×48=117600; 117600×47=5527200; 5527200×46=254,251,200.

Denominator: 5×4=20; 20×3=60; 60×2=120; 120×1=120.

So, C(50,5) = 254,251,200 / 120 = let me compute that.

Divide 254,251,200 by 120:

254,251,200 ÷ 120 = 2,118,760.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check that division.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step:

50C5 = (50 ×49 ×48 ×47 ×46)/(5×4×3×2×1)

Calculating numerator:

50×49=2450

2450×48=117,600

117,600×47=5,527,200

5,527,200×46=254,251,200

Denominator is 5×4×3×2×1 = 120.

254,251,200 ÷ 120: Let's divide step by step.

254,251,200 ÷ 10 = 25,425,120

25,425,120 ÷ 12 = 2,118,760.

Wait, no, 12 × 2,118,760 = 25,425,120. So yes, 254,251,200 ÷ 120 = 2,118,760.

So, C(50,5) is 2,118,760.

Thus, the probability is (10^5) / C(50,5) = 100,000 / 2,118,760.

Wait, but let me simplify that fraction.

Let me compute 100,000 divided by 2,118,760.

First, note that both numerator and denominator are divisible by 40.

Wait, 100,000 ÷ 40 = 2,500.

2,118,760 ÷40 = 52,969.

So, the fraction becomes 2,500 / 52,969.

Wait, that's 2500/52969.

Looking at the options, option I is 2500/52969. So, that's one of the options.

So, the probability is 2500/52969.

Wait, but let me cross-verify. Because sometimes when I use combinations, perhaps I made a mistake in the numerator.

Wait, another approach: the first step is to choose one number from each of the five tens groups. Each group has 10 numbers, so the number of ways is 10^5 = 100,000.

Total number of ways is C(50,5) = 2,118,760.

So, the probability is 100,000 / 2,118,760.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 40: 100,000 ÷40=2500, 2,118,760 ÷40=52,969.

So, 2500/52969 is the probability.

Looking at the options, option I is 2500/52969. So the answer should be option I.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the order, but in combinations, order doesn't matter, so our approach is correct.

Wait, another way: the total number of ways to choose 5 numbers where each is from a different tens group.

Each group is 2,3,4,5,6. So, for each group, pick one number. So, the number of ways is 10^5.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, another approach: For each of the 5 numbers, assign a tens digit, ensuring each is unique. So, the first number can be any from 20-29, the next from 30-39, etc., but since we are choosing without replacement, the count is 10^5.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the probability is 10^5 / C(50,5) = 2500/52969.

Which is option I.
</think>

The probability is calculated as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes. Favorable outcomes are selecting one number from each of the five tens groups (20-29, 30-39, etc.), giving 10^5 = 100,000 ways. The total number of ways to choose 5 numbers from 50 is C(50,5) = 2,118,760. Thus, the probability is 100,000 / 2,118,760 = 2500/52969, which is option I.
