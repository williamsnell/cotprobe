Okay, so I have this question about group theory, and I'm a bit new to the subject, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking about the order of the group Z₁₈. The options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from 2 to 36. 

Wait, Z₁₈ is the notation for the integers modulo 18, right? So that's the cyclic group of order 18. I remember that in group theory, the order of a group is the number of elements it has. For a cyclic group like Z_n, the order is indeed n. So Z₁₈ should have 18 elements. 

But wait, sometimes people get confused between the additive and multiplicative groups. Oh, right, Z₁₈ is the additive group, so it's an abelian group of order 18. So the order is 18, which is option G. 

Let me double-check. The elements of Z₁₈ are {0, 1, 2, ..., 17}, making 18 elements in total. Each element has an additive inverse, and the group operation is addition modulo 18. So yeah, the order is 18. 

Another thing, sometimes confusion arises between the additive group and the multiplicative group. For example, the multiplicative group modulo 18, written as (Z/18Z)^×, has φ(18) elements, where φ is Euler's totient function. φ(18) is φ(2*3²) = 18*(1-1/2)*(1-1/3) = 18*1/2*2/3 = 6. So that's 6 elements, which would be option D. But the question is about Z₁₈, which is the additive group, not the multiplicative one. 

So the correct answer should be G:18.

The group Z₁₈ is the additive group of integers modulo 18, which has 18 elements. Therefore, the order of Z₁₈ is 18.

Answer: G
