A: {6, 7, 8}
B: {10, 15, 20}
C: {5, 7, 9}
D: {2, 3, 4}
E: {2, 4, 6}
F: {4, 6, 8}

Okay, so I've got this inequality problem to solve. The question is about which set of numbers makes the inequality 2x - 1 < 10 true. The options are A to F, each with different numbers. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to solve the inequality 2x - 1 < 10. I'll do that by isolating x. So adding 1 to both sides gives me 2x < 11. Then, dividing both sides by 2, I get x < 11/2, which is 5.5. So x has to be less than 5.5 for the inequality to hold.

Now, I need to check each option to see if all the numbers in each set are less than 5.5. Let me go through each option:

Option A: {6,7,8}. The numbers here are all greater than 5.5. So 6 is more than 5.5, which doesn't satisfy x <5.5. So this set doesn't work.

Option B: {10,15,20}. All numbers are way above 5.5. Definitely doesn't fit.

Option C: {5,7,9}. 5 is exactly equal to 5.5? No, 5 is less than 5.5. Wait, wait, wait. 5 is less than 5.5? Oh, wait, 5 is less than 5.5. So 5 is included. 7 is more than 5.5, so this set includes a number that doesn't satisfy the inequality. So C is out.

Option D: {2,3,4}. All of these are less than 5.5. So 2 is good, 3 is good, 4 is good. So this set fits.

Option E: {2,4,6}. 2 is good, 4 is good, 6 is more than 5.5. So 6 doesn't satisfy the inequality. So E is out.

Option F: {4,6,8}. 4 is good, 6 and 8 are both above 5.5. So the set doesn't satisfy the inequality for all values.

So the only option that works is D: {2,3,4}.

The correct answer is D: {2,3,4}.
