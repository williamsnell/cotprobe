Okay, so I've got this problem here: find all zeros in the finite field Z_2 for the polynomial x² + 1. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

First, I know that Z_2 is the integers modulo 2. So the elements are 0 and 1. The polynomial is x squared plus 1. I need to find the roots of this polynomial in Z_2. That means I need to plug in each element of Z_2 into the polynomial and see if it equals zero.

Let's start with x = 0. Plugging in 0: (0)² + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Oh, that's 1, which isn't zero. So 0 isn't a root.

Now, x = 1. Plugging that in: (1)² + 1 = 1 + 1. But wait, in Z_2, adding 1 is the same as subtracting 1, so 1 + 1 = 0. So 1 is a root.

What about the other elements? Well, Z_2 only has two elements, 0 and 1, so I've checked both. 

So the only root is x = 1. Looking at the options, option H says 1, which is correct. Option G says 0, but 0 isn't a root. So the answer should be H.

The zeros of the polynomial \( x^2 + 1 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) are found by testing each element of \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \). Only \( x = 1 \) satisfies the equation. Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: 1**

Answer: H
