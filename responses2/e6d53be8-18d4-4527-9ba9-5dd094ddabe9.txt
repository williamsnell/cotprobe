Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what it says. The question is about the length contraction in special relativity. Hmm, right, length contraction happens when an object is moving at a high speed relative to the observer. 

So the problem states that a meter stick (L0) is moving at a speed of 2.7 × 10^8 m/s. I remember that the formula for length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where v is the velocity of the object and c is the speed of light. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, I think that's the formula when the object is moving at velocity v. But I should check if the given speed is a fraction of c.

Let me calculate v/c. The speed given is 2.7e8 m/s. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v/c would be 2.7e8 / 3e8 = 0.9. Oh, that's 0.9 times the speed of light. So v is 0.9c.

Now, the length L is the contracted length, so it should be less than L0. So L = L0 * sqrt(1 - (0.9)^2). Let me compute 0.9 squared: 0.81. So 1 - 0.81 is 0.19. The square root of 0.19 is approximately 0.4359. So L = 1 m * 0.4359 ≈ 0.436 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 0.44m, which is close. Option G is 0.74, which is much larger. So I think the correct answer should be around 0.44 m.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. 2.7e8 divided by 3e8 is 0.9? Yeah, 3e8 is 300 million, 2.7e8 is 270 million. So yes, 0.9c. So the Lorentz factor is sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = sqrt(1 - 0.81) = sqrt(0.19) ≈ 0.4359. So L = 1 * 0.4359 ≈ 0.436 m. So about 0.44 m. So looking at the options, F is 0.44m. So the answer should be option F.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for length contraction in special relativity:

\[
L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

where:
- \( L_0 = 1 \, \text{m} \) is the proper length of the meter stick,
- \( v = 2.7 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the velocity of the moving stick,
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light.

First, calculate \( v/c \):
\[
\frac{v}{c} = \frac{2.7 \times 10^8}{3 \times 10^8} = 0.9
\]

Next, compute \( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):
\[
1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2 = 1 - 0.81 = 0.19
\]

Then, find the square root:
\[
\sqrt{0.19} \approx 0.4359
\]

Finally, calculate the contracted length:
\[
L = 1 \, \text{m} \times 0.4359 \approx 0.436 \, \text{m}
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.44 \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option **F**.
