B: 35 ft by 66 ft
C: 25 ft by 47 ft
D: 30 ft by 53 ft
E: 30 in. by 57 in.
F: 45 in. by 85 in.
G: 27 in. by 57 in.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct ratio for the American flag's width and length. The question says the ratio is usually 10 to 19. I remember that the original flag of the United States had a specific size, so I need to compare the given options against that standard.

First, let me write down the ratio given: 10:19. That means for every 10 units of width, the length is 19 units. Alternatively, it could be 10:19 or 10/19. So I'll need to check each option's ratio to see which one matches 10:19.

Looking at the options:

A: 27 ft by 53 ft. Let's calculate the ratio. 27/53. Hmm, 27 divided by 53 is approximately 0.509, which isn't 10/19 (which is about 0.526). So A doesn't match.

B: 35 ft by 66 ft. That's 35/66. Let me compute that. 35 divided by 66 is approximately 0.530. 10/19 is about 0.526; so B's ratio is a bit higher than the standard. Not exactly the same.

C: 25 ft by 47 ft. 25/47 is about 0.5319. That's also a bit higher. Still doesn't match.

D: 30 ft by 53 ft. 30/53 is approximately 0.566. That's higher than 10/19. So D is not the right ratio.

E: 30 inches by 57 inches. 30/57 simplifies. Let me calculate that. Both are divisible by 3, so 10/19. Oh wait, 30 divided by 57 is (30/3)/(57/3) = 10/19. Exactly the ratio. So E is correct.

F: 45 inches by 85 inches. 45/85. Let me see. Both can be divided by 5: 9/17. 10/19 is about 0.526, and 9/17 is approximately 0.529. That's very close but not exactly 10/19. So F is not the right ratio.

G: 27 inches by 57 inches. 27/57. Both can be divided by 3: 9/19. Wait, 9/19 is approximately 0.473. But the flag's ratio is 10:19, so this is the inverse. So G is incorrect.

So the only option that matches the 10:19 ratio is E: 30 ft by 57 ft.

The correct ratio for the American flag is 10:19. Option E (30 ft by 57 ft) matches this ratio exactly.

Answer: E
