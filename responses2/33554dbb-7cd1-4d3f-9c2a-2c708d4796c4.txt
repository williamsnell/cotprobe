Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about autocorrelation functions (ACF) and partial autocorrelation functions (PACF). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks which statements are true. The options are from (i) to (iv) and the possible answers are A to J, each combining some of these. Let me go through each part.

First, let's list the statements:

i) The acf and pacf will always be identical at lag one whatever the model.

Hmm, does that mean they are the same for any model at lag 1? I think that's not correct. For example, in an MA(1) model, the acf at lag 1 is zero because the MA component has coefficients that die off. The PACF at lag 1 would be the same as the acf if the model is such that it's invertible. Wait, but for an MA model, the PACF usually starts being non-zero only after a certain lag, depending on the order. Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, for an AR model, the PACF can be non-zero beyond a certain lag. But for MA processes, the PACF tends to be zero beyond a certain lag, maybe? Wait, let me think. For an MA(q) model, the PACF is zero up to lag q. Because the partial autocorrelation at any lag beyond q is zero. But the acf at lag 1 is zero in MA(1) because the MA can be written as a sum of past errors, so there's no direct correlation. So for any model, the acf and pacf may not be identical at lag 1. For example, in an AR(1) model, the acf and pacf would be different at lag 1. So statement i is false.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. For any model, the acf and pacf might not be identical. So statement i is not always true. So i is false. So if statement i is false, then any option that includes i (A, B, F, J, etc.) might be wrong.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Maybe in some models, they are identical. For instance, if a model is such that the acf and pacf are the same, but I don't think that's the case. I think the acf and pacf are measures of a different concept. So at least for statement i, I think it's incorrect. So i is false.

ii) The pacf for an MA(q) model will in general be non-zero beyond lag q.

Wait, partial autocorrelation functions are related to the AR part. For an MA(q) model, the PACF beyond lag q is zero. Because in the MA model, there's no direct correlation at lag 1, 2, etc., but if you have a pure MA(q), the partial autocorrelation at lag 1 is zero, lag 2 is zero, up to lag q, and then from q+1 onwards, it's zero. So statement ii says that the PACF is non-zero beyond q, which would mean it's zero only up to q. So if the model is an MA(q), then the PACF for lags beyond q is zero. So statement ii says it's non-zero beyond q, which is the opposite. So statement ii is false. So ii is incorrect.

Wait, no, wait. I might have the definition wrong. Let me think. PACF measures the partial correlation between variable t and variable t-k, given that variables t-1,...,t-k-1 are controlled for. So for an MA(q) model, the PACF is zero for lags 1 to q, and then it's zero beyond that. So the PACF is zero beyond lag q. So statement ii says the PACF is non-zero beyond lag q. That's the opposite. Therefore, statement ii is false.

iii) The pacf for an AR(p) model will be zero beyond lag p.

Wait, AR(p) models have the property that their partial autocorrelation functions are zero beyond lag p. Because the AR model has a finite order and the partial autocorrelation at lags beyond p are zero. So statement iii is correct. So iii is true.

iv) The acf and pacf will be the same at lag two for an MA(1) model.

Let me think. For an MA(1) model, the acf at lag 1 is zero, and the acf at lag 2 is also zero (since the model is MA(1), the correlation between t and t+2 is zero). What about the PACF for lag 2? Let's see. For an MA(1) model, the PACF at lag 2 is zero as well. Wait, no: The partial autocorrelation at lag 2 in an MA(1) model would be zero. Because the model doesnâ€™t have any direct effect beyond lag 1. So the acf and pacf at lag two are both zero. So statement iv says they are the same, which is true. So statement iv is correct.

So let me recap:

i) False. Because the acf and pacf are not necessarily identical at lag 1, depending on the model.

ii) False. PACF for MA(q) is zero beyond lag q, not non-zero.

iii) True. PACF for AR(p) is zero beyond lag p.

iv) True. For MA(1) model, acf and pacf are same at lag 2 (both zero).

So statements iii and iv are true.

Looking at the options, which ones include only iii and iv.

Looking at the options, option D is (ii) and (iii) only. Option F includes (i), (iii), and (iv). Option J is (i) and (iii). Wait, no. Let me see:

Wait, the options are:

A: (i), (ii), (iii) only

B: (i), (ii) only

C: (ii), (iii), (iv) only

D: (ii) and (iii) only

E: (iii) and (iv) only

F: (i), (iii), (iv) only

G: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)

H: (ii) and (iv) only

I: (i) and (iv) only

J: (i) and (iii) only

Wait, our conclusion is that iii and iv are correct. So which options have only iii and iv?

Looking at the options, option E is (iii) and (iv) only. So the correct statements are iii and iv.

Wait, but let me make sure that iv is correct. For an MA(1) model, the acf at lag 2 is zero. But what about the pacf at lag 2? The partial autocorrelation at lag 2 is zero as well. Because in an MA(q) model, the PACF is zero beyond lag q. So yes, at lag 2, both the acf and pacf are zero. So statement iv is correct.

So the correct statements are iii and iv, so the answer is option E.

To determine which statements are true, let's analyze each one:

1. **Statement (i):**  
   The acf and pacf will always be identical at lag one regardless of the model.  
   This is false. For example, in an AR(1) model, the acf and pacf differ at lag one because the acf is zero, while the pacf captures the direct correlation. Thus, this statement is incorrect.

2. **Statement (ii):**  
   The pacf for an MA(q) model will in general be non-zero beyond lag q.  
   This is false. For an MA(q) model, the partial autocorrelation (PACF) is zero for lags 1 to q, and zero beyond that. Therefore, the PACF is non-zero only up to lag q, not beyond.

3. **Statement (iii):**  
   The pacf for an AR(p) model will be zero beyond lag p.  
   This is true. The partial autocorrelation function (PACF) for an autoregressive (AR) model of order p (AR(p)) is zero for lags beyond p. This is a defining property of AR models.

4. **Statement (iv):**  
   The acf and pacf will be the same at lag two for an MA(1) model.  
   This is true. For an MA(1) model, the acf at lag 2 is zero, and the PACF at lag 2 is also zero. Thus, the acf and PACF are identical at lag two.

From the analysis, the true statements are (iii) and (iv).
