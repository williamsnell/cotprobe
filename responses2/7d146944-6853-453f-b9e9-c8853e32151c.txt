Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the reduced mass of a nitrogen molecule. Hmm, I remember from my notes that reduced mass is involved in molecular formulas and stuff. Let me think about the steps I need to take.

Alright, the question states that both nitrogen atoms have an atomic mass of 14.00. So, the molecule is N2, right? Each nitrogen atom contributes to the reduced mass of the molecule. Wait, what's reduced mass exactly? Oh right, the reduced mass is used in the calculation of bond strength and other molecular properties. It's calculated using the masses of the two atoms involved.

I think the formula for reduced mass is (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2). So, m1 and m2 are the individual masses of the two atoms. Since both N atoms have the same atomic mass, m1 = m2 = 14.00. Let me plug that into the formula.

So, m1 * m2 is 14 * 14 = 196. Then m1 + m2 is 14 + 14 = 28. So, reduced mass is 196 / 28. Let me calculate that. 196 divided by 28 is... 7? Wait, 28 times 7 is 196. Oh yeah, so 196/28 is 7. So the reduced mass is 7.00.

Wait, but wait a second. The options include 7.00 as option J. So the correct answer should be J. Hmm, but am I sure I used the right formula? Because sometimes I mix up mass and reduced mass in these calculations. Let me double-check. Oh, right, the reduced mass is used in the denominator of the formula for the reduced mass of the molecule. But wait, what's the reduced mass in the context of the molecule's vibrational frequency?

Yes, because the reduced mass is part of the equation for the vibrational frequency of molecules. So the calculation seems correct. So the reduced mass for each N2 molecule would be 7.00. Looking at the options, J is 7.00, so that's the correct choice.

To calculate the reduced mass of a nitrogen molecule (Nâ‚‚) where both nitrogen atoms have an atomic mass of 14.00, we use the formula for reduced mass:

\[
\mu = \frac{m_1 \cdot m_2}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

Here, \( m_1 = m_2 = 14.00 \). Plugging in the values:

\[
\mu = \frac{14.00 \cdot 14.00}{14.00 + 14.00} = \frac{196.00}{28.00} = 7.00
\]

Thus, the reduced mass of the nitrogen molecule is **7.00**. Among the provided options, this corresponds to **J**.
