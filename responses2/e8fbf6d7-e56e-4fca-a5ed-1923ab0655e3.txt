Question:

 Use indirect truth tables to determine whether each set of propositions is consistent. If the set is consistent, choose an option with a consistent valuation. (There may be other consistent valuations.)
D ≡ E
F ∨ D
~E · ~F

Options:

A: Consistent. Consistent valuation when D and E are true and F is true
B: Inconsistent
C: Consistent. Consistent valuation when D is true, E and F are false
D: Consistent. Consistent valuation when E is true, D and F are false
E: Consistent. Consistent valuation when D and E are true and F is false
F: Consistent. Consistent valuation when D, E are false and F is true
G: Consistent. Consistent valuation when D and F are true and E is false
H: Consistent. Consistent valuation when D, E, and F are true
I: Consistent. Consistent valuation when F is true, D and E are false
J: Consistent. Consistent valuation when D, E and F are false

Okay, so I've got this logic problem about truth tables and consistency. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about determining if a set of propositions is consistent using indirect truth tables. Consistent means there's at least one way to assign truth values that makes all the propositions true at the same time. If the set is inconsistent, then no such assignment exists.

The propositions given are:
1. D ≡ E
2. F ∨ D
3. ~E · ~F

The options are A to J, each suggesting a possible consistent valuation. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let's understand each proposition.

1. D ≡ E: This means D and E have the same truth value. So, if D is true, E is true, and vice versa.
2. F ∨ D: This is either F is true or D is true. So, as long as F is true or D is true, this proposition is true.
3. ~E · ~F: This is the conjunction of ~E and ~F. So both E and F must be false for this to be true.

Now, to find a consistent valuation, I need to find truth values for D, E, F that satisfy all three.

Let's break down each proposition.

From proposition 3: ~E · ~F. So both E and F must be false. That means E is false and F is false.

But wait, proposition 1 says D ≡ E. Since E is false, D must also be false.

Now, substitute E and F as false, and D as false into proposition 2: F ∨ D. Since both F and D are false, F ∨ D evaluates to false. But proposition 2 requires that F ∨ D is true. So that would be a problem.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if E and F are both false, then D is false (from D ≡ E), so F ∨ D is false. So proposition 2 would not be satisfied. That's a problem. So, this suggests that the set is inconsistent because we can't have all three propositions true at the same time.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

If E is false, then D is false (from D ≡ E). And F is false (from ~E · ~F). So F ∨ D is F ∨ D, which is F or D. If both are false, then F ∨ D is false. So this makes proposition 2 false. That can't happen if all three must be true.

Wait, but the question is to determine if the set is consistent. So if I can find a way to have all three propositions true, then it's consistent.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the assignment. Let me try a different approach. Let's suppose that all three propositions are true. Then, from proposition 3, ~E and ~F must be true, so E and F are both false.

Then, from proposition 1, D ≡ E. Since E is false, D must also be false.

Now, plugging into proposition 2: F ∨ D. Since F is false and D is false, F ∨ D is false. So proposition 2 is false. That's a problem. So, with E=F=D being false, proposition 2 fails.

Therefore, there is no way to assign truth values where all three propositions are true. So the set is inconsistent. That means the answer should be B: Inconsistent.

Wait, but let me double-check. Perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to create a truth table step by step.

Variables to consider: D, E, F.

Proposition 3: ~E ∧ ~F. So E must be F must be false.

So, E is F is false.

Then, from D ≡ E (proposition 1), D must be false.

Now, proposition 2: F ∨ D. Since F is false and D is false, F ∨ D is false. So proposition 2 is false. Therefore, the set of propositions can't all be true at the same time. So the set is inconsistent.

Looking at the options, option B says the set is inconsistent. So the answer should be B.
</think>

To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, we analyze each proposition and derive possible truth values.

1. **Proposition 3**: ~E · ~F implies E and F are false.
2. **Proposition 1**: D ≡ E means D is false since E is false.
3. **Proposition 2**: F ∨ D requires F or D to be true. With F and D both false, this proposition is false.

Thus, all three propositions cannot be true simultaneously, making the set inconsistent.

Answer: B: Inconsistent
