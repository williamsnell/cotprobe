Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about polynomial irreducibility over different rings. Let me see if I can figure this out.

The question has two statements about the polynomial 4x - 2. The statements are:

1. 4x - 2 is irreducible over Z.
2. 4x - 2 is irreducible over Q.

I need to determine if each statement is true or false and then match the correct option from A to J. The options are combinations of true/false for each statement.

First, I should recall what irreducible means. A polynomial is irreducible over a ring if it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with coefficients in that ring.

Let's start with Statement 1: 4x - 2 is irreducible over Z.

The polynomial 4x - 2. To check irreducibility over Z, I can try to factor it. In Z[x], a polynomial of degree 1 can't be factored further because you can't have a product of two degree 1 polynomials that equals it unless they are the same. So, 4x - 2 can be written as 2*(2x -1). But wait, 2 is in Z, and 2x -1 is also in Z[x]. So 4x -2 factors into 2*(2x -1) over Z. That means it's reducible over Z. So Statement 1 is false.

Now Statement 2: 4x - 2 is irreducible over Q.

Here, Q is the field of rational numbers. Again, 4x -2 is a linear polynomial. In Q[x], a linear polynomial is irreducible because it can't be factored further. So Statement 2 is true.

So Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true.

Looking at the options:

A: True, Not enough info. → No, both are known.
B: Not enough, False → No, because 1 is known as false.
C: False, False → That's what I think.
D: Not enough, Not enough → No, because of known facts.
E: Not enough, True → No, because 1 is false.
F: False, True → That matches what I found.
G: True, True → No.
H: False, Not enough → No, because 2 is known as true.
I: Both irreducible → No, because 1 is false.
J: True, False → That's correct.

The analysis shows that Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true.
