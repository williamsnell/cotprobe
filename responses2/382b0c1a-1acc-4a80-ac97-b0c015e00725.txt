Question:

Given that the sample has a standard deviation of zero, which of the following is a true statement?

Options:

Okay, so I've got this question about statistics. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question says that the sample has a standard deviation of zero, and I need to figure out which of the given statements are true.

First, I remember that standard deviation measures the spread of data points from the mean. If the standard deviation is zero, that implies that all the data points are exactly the same. Because if even one data point is different, the standard deviation would be greater than zero.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: The population mean is also zero. Hmm, not necessarily. The sample's standard deviation being zero tells me all data points are equal, but the population's mean could still be different. For example, if the sample is all 5s, the population could have a different mean. So A might not be true.

Option B: The sample mean and sample mode are not equal. Wait, if all data points are the same, like 5s, then the mean, median, and mode would all be 5. So they would be equal. So B is saying they are not equal, which can't be true because in this case they are equal. So B is false.

Option C: The sample size must be very small. That doesn't make sense. The sample size isn't related to whether data points are same or not. Whether the sample is small or large, if all data points are the same, that's possible for any size. So C is definitely false.

Option D: All data points in the sample are outliers. Wait, outliers are data points that are much larger or smaller than others. If all data points are the same, they can't be outliers. So D is false.

Option E: The sample may have outliers. Well, if all data points are the same, there can't be any outliers. So E is false because having outliers is impossible in this case.

Option F: The sample has a skewed distribution. Again, if all data points are the same, the distribution is not skewed. So F is false.

Option G: The standard deviation of the population is also zero. No, because the sample standard deviation being zero doesn't tell us anything about the population's standard deviation. The population could have a standard deviation of any number, including non-zero. So G is false.

Option H: The population has a symmetric distribution. The sample being all same data points doesn't give any info on the population's symmetry. It could be symmetric, anti-symmetric, or any other way. So H is false.

Option I: The sample mean and sample median are equal. Since in a sample all data points are the same, the mean, median, and mode are all the same. So I is true.

So the only true statement is option I.

The only true statement is I: The sample mean and sample median are equal.

Answer: I
