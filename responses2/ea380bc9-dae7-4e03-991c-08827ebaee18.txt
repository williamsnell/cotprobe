Alright, let me try to work through this question. So, the question is about comparing Kant's view of sexual objectification with what Papadaki argues. I remember that Kant was a philosopher, probably in the Enlightenment era, and he had some views on human nature and objectification. I also recall that Kant's concept of objectification is often associated with the idea of subjectification, where humans are reduced to their forms, like in the Categorical Imperative.

Papadaki is a contemporary philosopher, I think, so his arguments might be more recent and critical. I'm trying to remember what each of these options says.

Option A: Papadaki agrees with Kant. I don't think so. I've read that Papadaki and Kant have different stances on this. Maybe Papadaki is more critical or different.

Option B: Papadaki suggests Kant's view is too subjective. Hmm, I'm not sure. It depends on what's considered subjective. I think people might have different opinions about objectification, but maybe Papadaki points out that it's too much of a moral judgment.

Option C: Papadaki argues sexual objectification is outdated. I don't think this is correct because objectification has evolved in history, so maybe it's not outdated in the same way.

Option D: Enhances humanity. Well, objectification can be both a source of pleasure and a source of suffering. So, I don't think it's necessarily enhancing humanity.

Option E: Papadaki believes objectification is part of human relationships. That makes sense because relationships often involve objectification, like in marriage or family dynamics.

Option F: Papadaki thinks Kant's view is too moralistic. This could be true because Kant's Objectivistic theory is more about the form of being rather than the moral implications of objectification.

Option G: Papadaki says Kant's views are too black and white. I'm not sure about this. The subjectivity of objectification is a point of contention, so maybe it's not too black and white.

Option H: Papadaki believes objectification is justified in certain contexts. That aligns with how objectification is used in modern society, like in technology or education.

Option I: Kant's view is wrong in terms of humanity. I don't think that's the case because Kant's moral theory is still relevant in discussing objectification's impact on humanity.

Option J: It's not clear how objectification sacrifices humanity. I think this is correct because there's no clear way to justify or justify objectification without moral frameworks.

So, looking at the options, the question is about what Papadaki argues. Let's think about each option.

Option E says that objectification is part of human relationships. That's probably correct because objectification is a common part of how people interact and form relationships.

Option H suggests that it's justified in certain contexts. That's also true, as objectification is widely used in various aspects of human life.

Option J is a direct statement about objectification sacrificing humanity, which I think is accurate.

Wait, but the question is about what Papadaki argues. So, let's think about each option's content.

Option E is a statement of a belief, but perhaps it's a strong statement. Option H is another strong statement. Option J is a fact.

So the question is about what Papadaki suggests, so which one is the argument she makes. Let's see: option E is a belief that objectification is part of human relationships. I think that's a correct statement.

Wait, another approach: the options are about what Papadaki thinks. So, which of these is her point.

Option H: Papadaki believes objectification is justified in certain contexts. That's a possibility.

Option J: It's not clear how sexual use sacrifices humanity. That's a strong statement and probably correct.

Wait, but the question is about what Papadaki argues, not what he claims. So, the options are what he suggests.

So, looking for which of these options is what he's stating.

Option E: "Papadaki believes that sexual objectification is a necessary part of human relationships." That sounds like a direct statement he makes. So, if he believes it's necessary, that would be E.

Option H is a possible assertion, but I'm not sure if that's what he's saying.

Option J is a statement that's a fact, but the question is about what he argues, not what he claims. So, if he argues that it's necessary, that's E.

Alternatively, option H is an argument, but it's not a direct statement of what he suggests.

I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to think of each option's content.

Option E: " sexual objectification is a necessary part of human relationships." This would be a statement that he makes. So, he's arguing it's necessary.

Option H: "Papadaki believes that objectification is justified in certain contexts." This is another possible assertion, but I'm not sure if that's what he's saying.

So, the question is asking what Papadaki argues. So, the options are the possible statements she makes.

Looking at the options again, I think option E is the direct statement, so the answer is E.

Wait, but let me think about the options again.

The question is, against Kant, Papadaki argues which of these.

So, option E says that objectification is a necessary part of human relationships.

Yes, that's a strong statement. So, that must be the correct answer.

The correct answer is E: Papadaki argues that sexual objectification is a necessary part of human relationships.
