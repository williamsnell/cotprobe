Okay, so I've got this question here about how long it'll take Tara to develop 8 rolls of film. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says she can develop 2 rolls in 18 minutes. And they want to know how long it'll take for 8 rolls. Hmm, so first, maybe I should figure out how long it takes per roll and then multiply by 8.

Wait, 2 rolls take 18 minutes. So 1 roll would take half of that, right? So 18 divided by 2 is 9 minutes per roll. That makes sense because if 2 rolls take 18, each is 9.

Now, for 8 rolls, that's 8 times 9 minutes. Let me do that math: 8 * 9 is 72 minutes. Now I need to convert 72 minutes into hours and minutes. Since 60 minutes make an hour, 72 minus 60 is 12. So that's 1 hour and 12 minutes. Looking at the options, option D is 1 hour 12 minutes. So that should be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. 2 rolls take 18, so 8 is four times as many rolls. 18 * 4 is 72, which is 1 hour 12. Yep, that's right. So I think option D is correct.

The correct answer is D: 1 hour 12 minutes.

Answer: D: 1 hour 12 minutes
