Okay, so I have this economics question about disposable income and how it affects saving and consumption. Hmm, let me think.

The question is asking what happens to saving when disposable income increases by X. The options are A to J, each making a different statement about consumption and saving. I remember that disposable income is the income after taxes, so when that's higher, people have more money to spend or save.

Wait, the question is about the change in saving when disposable income increases by X. So, from what I recall, in the theory of consumption and saving, when disposable income increases, people generally save more because they have more money to invest or keep. Also, the marginal propensity to save is the proportion of additional income that people save. So if disposable income goes up by X, and the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is, say, 0.2, then saving would increase by 0.2X. But wait, the options don't mention marginal propensity; they just talk about changes in saving and consumption.

Wait, the options are about how consumption and saving change. So if disposable income increases, what's the impact on both. Let's break it down.

First, what happens to consumption. There are two factors: the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and the marginal propensity to save (MPS). MPC is the fraction of additional income that people spend, and MPS is the fraction that they save. So MPC + MPS = 1. When disposable income increases by X, the MPC tells us how much of that increase is saved. So if MPC is 0.8, then 0.8X is saved, and the remaining 0.2X is spent on consumption. So both consumption and saving increase, but the amounts depend on MPC.

But the options don't specify MPC. So the question must be assuming that the MPC is positive and less than 1. So with an increase in disposable income, both consumption and savings increase. But the exact amount depends on MPC.

Looking at the options, the options are about how much saving and consumption change. So if disposable income increases by X, what can we say about the change in saving?

Option C: saving increases by exactly X. That would only be true if MPC is 1, which means everyone saves every extra dollar. But that's not the case in reality because people have marginal propensity to consume. So C is probably incorrect.

Option A: saving remains constant. That can't be right because if disposable income increases and people have an MPC > 0, they will increase their saving.

Option B: consumption decreases by more than X. No, because with an MPC, more of the increase in income is spent, so consumption should increase, not decrease.

Option D: saving increases by less than X. That depends on MPC. If MPC is 0.5, then saving increases by 0.5X, which is less than X. So if MPC is less than 1, then saving increases by (1 - MPC)*X, which is less than X. So D is correct in that case.

Wait, but the options are about what happens when disposable income increases by X. So the question is about the magnitude of the change in saving. If MPC is 0.5, saving increases by 0.5X (so less than X). So if the disposable income increases by X, saving increases by (1 - MPC) * X. So if MPC is less than 1, then the saving increase is (some value less than X).

So the correct statement is that saving increases by less than X. So option D says that. Are there any other options?

Option E: consumption decreases by less than X. No, because the increase in income leads to more consumption.

Option F: saving decreases by more than X. No, because with MPC, it's less.

Option G: consumption increases by exactly X. No, because 1 - MPC is less than 1.

Option I: consumption remains constant. No, because when disposable income increases, consumption increases.

Option J: consumption increases by more than X. No, because with MPC, it's less.

So the only correct option is D: saving increases by less than X.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The question is about when disposable income increases by X, what happens to saving. So the increase in disposable income leads to more income, which is spent and saved. The amount saved depends on MPC.

If MPC is 0.8, then saving increases by 0.8X, which is less than X. So the change in saving is (1 - MPC) * X. So saving increases by (1 - MPC) * X, which is less than X. Therefore, option D is correct.
</think>

The question asks what happens to saving when disposable income increases by \( X \). 

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Saving increases because disposable income is higher, and people can save more.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Consumption increases because more of the additional income is spent.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Saving increases by \( (1 - MPC) \times X \), which is less than \( X \) if \( MPC < 1 \).
- **Option D**: Correct. Saving increases by less than \( X \) because \( (1 - MPC) \times X \) is the amount saved, which is less than \( X \).
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Consumption increases, not decreases.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Saving does not decrease.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Consumption increases, not remains constant.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Saving does not decrease.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Consumption increases, not remains constant.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Consumption increases, not increases by more than \( X \).

The correct answer is **D: saving increases by less than \( X \)**.
