Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about what grandparents feel especially when their grandchildren are in college. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question is asking about the last character of the answer, which is the letter I should choose. So I need to figure out the correct answer and then pick the last letter of that option.

The question is: Grandparents with grandchildren in college report feeling especially loved when such grandchildren... 

The options are A to F. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Buy them college merchandise as a token of love and appreciation. That sounds pretty positive. People might appreciate getting gifts, but does that really make them feel "loved"? It might be more about appreciation, but maybe not the strongest feeling of love.

Option B: Pay a surprise visit and ask for advice. This seems more personal and maybe a bit of a gesture. It's a bit more about interaction and maybe a bit more heartfelt, but I'm not sure if it's what they would feel most about.

Option C: Dedicate a social media post to them. Social media can be a way to express feelings, but I'm not sure if grandparents would specifically do that. It might show they're thoughtful, but is it the most emotional response?

Option D: Ask them to attend college events and introduce them to friends. Attending events and talking to friends sounds like a direct and heartfelt way to show love. It's more about the person themselves feeling loved because of their grandparent's influence.

Option E: Visit during the holidays and bring gifts. Visiting someone during the holidays and bringing gifts is about the grandparent giving a present, which could be a form of love. It's a more romantic gesture, but maybe not the most direct feeling of love.

Option F: Send a text message every day. Sending text messages is a form of personal interaction, but it's not as direct as visiting or exchanging gifts. It might be a way to express feelings, but I'm not sure if it's the strongest feeling.

Now, considering that grandparents are usually the ones who spend a lot of time with their grandchildren, the most direct and heartfelt way to show love is by visiting and giving gifts. So option E seems like it would be the best choice.

Wait, but option D also mentions attending events and talking to friends. That's a more personal and direct approach, which might be more intense in terms of feeling loved. So between D and E, which one is more common or intense?

I think grandparents would definitely feel loved by visiting the grandchildren, giving gifts, and maybe even attending events. It's about the directness and the personal interaction. So option D might be the answer.

Alternatively, option E is also a good choice, but since it's a more frequent and less specific visit, maybe D is a more direct way to express love as a grandparent would.

So I'm leaning towards option D because it's about directly asking for help and showing affection through personal interaction.

The best answer is D: Ask them to attend college events and introduce them to friends. This directly expresses a form of love through personal interaction.

Answer: D
