Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about fluid dynamics, specifically about the volume flux Q through a small-boretube at low velocities, which is laminar flow. The question uses the power-product method to rewrite the suggested relationship Q as a function of the pipe radius r, fluid viscosity μ, and the pressure drop per unit pipe length (dp/dx).

Hmm, I remember that the power-product method involves looking at the dimensions of each variable and combining them to form a dimensionless parameter. The basic idea is to express each variable's dimension in terms of the base dimensions and then see how they can be combined to form a dimensionless quantity.

So, the formula given is Q = f(r, μ, dp/dx). I need to find what the correct combination is. Let me list out the dimensions of each variable.

From the table provided, I'll need the dimensions of each quantity involved.

Let's start with each variable:

- Q: volume flux. The dimension is L^3 T^{-1}.
- r: radius, so L^2 T^0? Wait, no, radius is a length, so L^1.
- μ: viscosity. From the table, μ has dimensions ML^{-1}T^{-1}.
- dp/dx: pressure drop per unit length. Pressure is ML^{-1}T^{-2}, so dp/dx is (ML^{-1}T^{-2}) / (L T^{-1}) )= M L^{-2} T^{-1}.

Wait, let me double-check that. Pressure drop per unit length, dp/dx, is the change in pressure over distance. So, if pressure is ML^{-1}T^{-2}, then dp has ML^{-1}T^{-2}, and dividing by dx (which is length L) gives M L^{-3} T^{-2} ?

Wait no, actually, if dp is a pressure drop, then the units are ML^{-1}T^{-2} divided by a length L, so dp/x has units (ML^{-1}T^{-2}) / L = M L^{-2} T^{-2}.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think again. dp is a pressure drop, so it's force per unit area. Force is MLT^{-2}, area is L^2. So pressure is ML^{-1}T^{-2}. So, dp is ML^{-1}T^{-2}, and dp/dx is (ML^{-1}T^{-2})/(L) )= M L^{-2} T^{-2}.

So, dp/dx has dimensions M L^{-2} T^{-2}.

So, let's list the dimensions:

Q: L^3 T^{-1}
r: L
μ: M L^{-1} T^{-1}
dp/dx: M L^{-2} T^{-2}

Now, the power-product method says to take each variable and write its dimension in terms of the base dimensions (M, L, T). Then, find combinations that multiply to give a dimensionless term.

Let me denote each variable's exponent in terms of M, L, T for the exponent in a hypothetical function Q = f(r, μ, dp/dx) would be Q = r^a * μ^b * (dp/dx)^c.

The exponents a, b, c should be such that when you multiply the dimensions of each variable, the result is dimensionless.

So, for each variable:

r^a has dimension L^a.

μ^b has dimension (M L^{-1} T^{-1})^b = M^b L^{-b} T^{-b}.

(dp/dx)^c has dimension (M L^{-2} T^{-2})^c = M^c L^{-2c} T^{-2c}.

Multiply all together: L^{a} * M^{b} L^{-b} T^{-b} * M^c L^{-2c} T^{-2c}.

Combine the exponents:

For M: b + c.

For L: a - b - 2c.

For T: -b -2c.

We want this product to be dimensionless, so all exponents must be zero.

So, set up the equations:

1. For M: b + c = 0 → c = -b.
2. For L: a - b - 2c = 0. Substitute c from equation 1: a - b - 2*(-b) = a - b + 2b = a + b = 0 → a = -b.
3. For T: -b -2c = 0. Again, substitute c = -b → -b -2*(-b) = -b + 2b = b = 0 → b = 0.

Wait, if b = 0, then from equation 1: c = -b = 0, and equation 2: a = -b = 0.

But this would mean that Q = r^0 * μ^0 * (dp/dx)^0 = 1, which is not correct because Q is not a dimensionless quantity. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, perhaps I should include the possibility that Q is dimensionless, so the combination r^a μ^b (dp/dx)^c must result in a dimensionless quantity. So, the exponents for M, L, T must all cancel.

So, let's write the exponents again:

M: b + c = 0 → b = -c.

L: a - b - 2c = 0.

T: -b -2c = 0.

So, from T: -b -2c = 0 → b = -2c.

Substituting into M: b = -c → from T, b = -2c. So, -2c = -c → 2c = c → c=0.

But if c=0, from M: b = -c → b=0.

So, a= -b=0.

Hmm, so the only solution is a=0, b=0, c=0, which gives Q=1, which isn't correct. That's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recheck the exponents.

Wait, more accurately, the exponents for each variable in the function are a, b, c. The exponents in the product must all be zero to give a dimensionless quantity.

So, the product is:

(M)^b (L)^a (T)^-b (L)^-2c (T)^-2c (M)^c (L)^-2c.

Wait, perhaps I should structure it correctly.

Wait, let me recompute:

r has dimension L → r^a → L^a.

μ has dimension M L^{-1} T^{-1} → (M L^{-1} T^{-1})^b = M^b L^{-b} T^{-b}.

dp/dx has dimension M L^{-2} T^{-2} → (M L^{-2} T^{-2})^c = M^c L^{-2c} T^{-2c}.

Multiply all together:

(M^b * M^c) → M^{b + c}.

(L^a * L^{-b} * L^{-2c}) → L^{a - b - 2c}.

(T^{-b} * T^{-2c}) → T^{-b - 2c}.

Set each exponent to zero:

1. M: b + c = 0 → c = -b.

2. L: a - b - 2c =0.

3. T: -b -2c=0.

Now, substitute c from equation 1 into equation 3.

Equation 3: -b - 2*(-b) = -b + 2b = b =0 → b=0.

Then, c = -b → c=0.

Equation 2: a - 0 - 0= a =0 → a=0.

So, the only solution is a=0, b=0, c=0.

But that gives Q=1, which isn't possible because Q has units L^3 T^{-1}, not a dimensionless quantity.

Wait, this suggests that the function Q is not dimensionless, but the question says to rewrite Q as a function of these variables in a dimensionless form. So, perhaps I should manipulate the exponents differently.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake because the function Q is supposed to be dimensionless. So, maybe I should have considered the exponents such that the entire product is dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps a different approach: Express each variable's exponent in terms of the base dimensions, then find a combination of exponents that sum to zero in each dimension.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take each variable and express it in terms of the base dimensions, then find which combination of these variables (multiples of them) gives a dimensionless quantity.

Let me try that approach.

Express each variable:

- Q: L^3 T^{-1}.

- r: L.

- μ: M L^{-1} T^{-1}.

- dp/dx: M L^{-2} T^{-2}.

We need to find exponents a, b, c such that Q^a * r^b * μ^c * (dp/dx)^d is dimensionless.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to consider the product (Q)^a (r)^b (μ)^c (dp/dx)^d = dimensionless.

So, Q^a * r^b * μ^c * (dp/dx)^d = ?

Expressing each variable's exponents:

Q: L^3 T^{-1} → (L)^3 (T)^-1.

r: L → L^1.

μ: M L^{-1} T^{-1} → M^1 L^{-1} T^{-1}.

dp/dx: M L^{-2} T^{-2} → M^1 L^{-2} T^{-2}.

So, the product is:

(L^3 T^{-1})^a * (L)^b * (M L^{-1} T^{-1})^c * (M L^{-2} T^{-2})^d.

Multiply these together:

= M^c M^d * L^{3a + b - c - 2d} * T^{-a - c - 2d}.

We need the overall exponents to be zero in M, L, T.

So,

For M: c + d = 0 → equation 1.

For L: 3a + b - c - 2d =0 → equation 2.

For T: -a - c - 2d =0 → equation 3.

Now, we have three equations:

1. c + d = 0 → d = -c.

2. 3a + b - c -2d = 0.

3. -a -c -2d =0.

From equation 1, d = -c.

Substitute d into equations 2 and 3.

Equation 2: 3a + b - c -2*(-c) = 3a + b - c + 2c = 3a + b + c = 0.

Equation 3: -a -c -2*(-c) = -a -c + 2c = -a + c = 0 → a = c.

Now, from equation 2: 3a + b + c =0 → but since a = c → 3a + b + a = 4a + b =0 → b = -4a.

So, substituting a into the product:

So, a is a free variable, let's set a =k. Then,

c = a =k.

d = -c = -k.

b = -4a → b= -4k.

So, the exponents are:

a=k,

b= -4k,

c=k,

d= -k.

We can factor out k (since k is a non-zero exponent scaling):

Then the product becomes:

Q^k * r^{-4k} * μ^k * (dp/dx)^{-k} = dimensionless.

Factor out k: k*(Q^k * r^{-4} * μ^k * (dp/dx)^{-k} ) = dimensionless.

Which is the same as (Q r^{-4} μ (dp/dx)^{-1})^k → which is dimensionless.

So, the dimensionless quantity is ( μ r^4 dp/dx )^{-1} Q.

Wait, let me write that:

Q = [ μ r^4 (dp/dx) ]^{-1} → Q = 1/(μ r^4 (dp/dx)).

Alternatively, the dimensionless parameter would be μ r^4 (dp/dx)^{-1} }, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The dimensionless parameter should be a combination such that all the exponents cancel. So, from the above, the exponents are a=k, b=-4k, c=k, d=-k.

So, the exponents in the dimensionless parameter would be: a=1, b=-4, c=1, d=-1.

Wait, perhaps that's not the correct way. Let me think: The exponents for the dimensionless term would be a=1, b=-4, c=1, d=-1. Or perhaps another combination.

Wait, no. The exponents for the dimensionless parameter is a=1, b=-4, c=1, d=-1? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should write the dimensionless term as (Q^a r^b μ^c (dp/dx)^d ) where the exponents a, b, c, d are such that each variable's exponent sum to zero.

But perhaps I'm complicating myself. Let me think of the exponents in the dimensionless term. 

Wait, from earlier, we have:

The exponents for each variable in the dimensionless term would be a=1, b=-4, c=1, d=-1.

Wait, perhaps no, because the exponents are based on the variables in the function. Alternatively, perhaps the dimensionless term is μ r^4 (dp/dx)^{-1}, and Q is proportional to 1/(μ r^4 (dp/dx)).

Wait, but let me think again. The dimensionless parameter, let's call it Ψ, would be a function of the variables such that:

Ψ = Q^a r^b μ^c (dp/dx)^d.

And the exponents a, b, c, d are found from the power product method such that their sum for each base dimension is zero.

From above, we found that a=k, b=-4k, c=k, d=-k. Let's factor out k, which can be taken as 1 (since any scaling doesn't affect dimensionless terms). So, a=1, b=-4, c=1, d=-1.

So, Ψ = Q^1 r^{-4} μ^1 (dp/dx)^{-1}.

So, Ψ = Q / (r^4 μ (dp/dx)).

So, that means that Q = Ψ r^4 μ (dp/dx).

But the question is to express Q as a function in dimensionless form, so perhaps the dimensionless parameter is Ψ = Q / (r^4 μ (dp/dx)).

Wait, but the question is about rewriting Q in terms of a dimensionless quantity. So, perhaps the correct form is to have Q expressed as [something], which is dimensionless.

Wait, let me think: The power-product method is used to find a dimensionless parameter. So, the dimensionless parameter Ψ is found, and Q is expressed as Ψ multiplied by some other terms.

Wait, no. The function Q is expressed in terms of the variables, but as a dimensionless function. So, perhaps Q is proportional to Ψ, but to get the correct form, I need to write Q in terms of Ψ.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to express the function as Q = k * Ψ, where k is a proportionality constant. But since the question is about rewriting the relationship in dimensionless form, perhaps it's about finding Ψ as a dimensionless parameter.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the dimensionless parameter Ψ, which is a combination of the variables.

So, from earlier, the exponents a=1, b=-4, c=1, d=-1. So, Ψ = Q r^{-4} μ (dp/dx)^{-1}.

Which can be written as Ψ = Q / (r^4 μ (dp/dx)).

Thus, Q = Ψ r^4 μ (dp/dx).

But the question is to choose the correct option, which is in the form of Q = (const) (r^something)(μ^something)(dp/dx^something).

Looking at the answer options:

Option A: Q = (const) (μ/r^4) (dp/dx)

Which would be Q = const * μ r^{-4} (dp/dx).

Which is Q = const * (μ r^4 (dp/dx))^{-1}, which is the same as Ψ = Q * r^4 μ (dp/dx), and Ψ is dimensionless.

So, if Ψ is dimensionless, then Q = Ψ r^4 μ (dp/dx). So, the correct option would have Q proportional to r^4 μ (dp/dx) times a constant.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Q = const * μ/r^4 * dp/dx

Which can be rewritten as Q = const * (μ * (dp/dx) ) / r^4.

But wait, the question is about expressing Q in terms of a dimensionless parameter.

So, the correct relationship is Q = Ψ r^4 μ (dp/dx), where Ψ is dimensionless.

But looking at the options, all of them are in terms of various variables multiplied by a constant.

So, perhaps the correct option is A, because it has (μ/r^4)(dp/dx), which when multiplied by r^4, gives μ (dp/dx), and the other variables are present.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the dimensionless parameter Ψ is Q divided by (r^4 μ (dp/dx)), so Ψ = Q/(r^4 μ (dp/dx)).

So, Q = Ψ r^4 μ (dp/dx).

So, Q is proportional to the dimensionless parameter multiplied by r^4 μ (dp/dx).

But the options don't include Ψ, they have expressions in terms of variables and a constant.

So, perhaps the correct option is the one that shows Q as a multiple of r^4 μ (dp/dx) times a constant.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Q = const * (μ/r^4) * (dp/dx)

Which is Q = const * μ (dp/dx) / r^4.

But that would be Q = const * (μ (dp/dx)) / r^4.

So, the dimension of this would be (M L^{-1} T^{-1}) (ML^{-1}T^{-1}) / (L^4)) → (M² L^{-2} T^{-2}) / L^4 → M² L^{-6} T^{-2}.

That's not dimensionless. So, perhaps option A is incorrect.

Wait, other options:

Option B: Q = const * (r^3 / (μ (dp/dx)))

So, Q = const * r^3 / (μ (dp/dx)) → dimension is ( L^3 ) / ( ( ML^{-1} T^{-1} ) ( M L^{-2} T^{-2} ) )) → L^3 / ( M^2 L^{-3} T^{-3} ) → L^3 * L^3 M^{-2} T^3 = L^6 M^{-2} T^3. Not dimensionless.

Option C: Q = const * (r^5 / (μ^2 (dp/dx)))

Q's dimension: (L^5 ) / ( (M L^{-1} T^{-1})^2 ( M L^{-2} T^{-2} ) ) ) → L^5 / ( M^2 L^{-2} T^{-2} * M L^{-2} T^{-2} ) → L^5 / ( M^3 L^{-4} T^{-4} ) → L^5 * M^{-3} L^{4} T^{4} = L^{9} M^{-3} T^{4} → not dimensionless.

Option D: Q = const * (r^3 μ^2 (dp/dx)^{-1})

So, the dimension would be (L^3) * (M^2 L^{-2} T^{-2}) ) * ( M^{-1} L^{2} T^{2} )^{-1} → Wait, let me calculate each variable:

μ^2: (M L^{-1} T^{-1})^2 = M² L^{-2} T^{-2}.

(dp/dx)^{-1}: (M L^{-2} T^{-2})^{-1} = M^{-1} L^{2} T^{2}.

So, putting it together:

L^3 * M^2 L^{-2} T^{-2} * M^{-1} L^2 T^2 → L^{3-2+2} = L^3.

M: 2 -1 = 1.

T: -2 +2 = 0.

So, the dimension is L^3 M^1 → which is not dimensionless. So, option D is not a dimensionless parameter.

Wait, another approach: The correct dimensionless quantity should have all exponents zero.

From earlier, the exponents for Q in the function are a=1, b=-4, c=1, d=-1. So, the dimensionless parameter is (Q)^1 (r)^{-4} (μ)^1 (dp/dx)^{-1}.

So, the dimensionless parameter is Q / (r^4 μ (dp/dx)).

Which can be written as Q = Ψ r^4 μ (dp/dx).

So, the correct option should have Q expressed as a constant times μ r^4 (dp/dx).

Looking at the options, option A is Q = const * (μ/r^4) * (dp/dx) → which is Q = const * μ (dp/dx) / r^4.

But that's not dimensionless because when multiplied by r^4, it's μ (dp/dx), which is dimensionless. So, Q would be proportional to μ (dp/dx), which is dimensionless, but the option is A.

Wait, but the question is about rewriting Q as a function in dimensionless form. So, perhaps option A is the correct one because it has μ, r^4, and (dp/dx) as part of the dimensionless parameter.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because the correct dimensionless parameter is Q/(r^4 μ (dp/dx)).

So, Q = [something dimensionless] * r^4 μ (dp/dx).

Looking at the answer options, the only one that includes all three variables multiplied by a dimensionless parameter is option A.

Wait, no, because option A is Q = const * (μ/r^4) * (dp/dx).

Which is Q = const * μ (dp/dx) / r^4.

So, that would be Q = const * (μ (dp/dx)) / r^4.

Which, when multiplied by r^4, gives μ (dp/dx), which is dimensionless.

So, Q = const * (μ (dp/dx)).

But that's not dimensionless, because when you have a constant multiplied by a dimensionless quantity, it's still dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A, because it includes the necessary variables in the correct combination.

Alternatively, perhaps option A is correct, and the others are not.

So, let's see. The correct relationship is Q = Ψ r^4 μ (dp/dx), where Ψ is dimensionless.

Looking at the options, option A is Q = const * (μ/r^4) * (dp/dx).

Which can be rewritten as Q = const * (μ (dp/dx)) / r^4.

So, that's Q = const * (μ (dp/dx)) / r^4.

Which implies that Q is proportional to (μ (dp/dx)) / r^4.

But how does that relate to the dimensionless parameter Ψ?

Wait, the dimensionless parameter Ψ is Q / (r^4 μ (dp/dx)).

So, Ψ = Q / (r^4 μ (dp/dx)).

So, Q = Ψ * r^4 μ (dp/dx).

But the question is about expressing Q as a function in dimensionless form. So, perhaps the correct option is A, because it includes the necessary variables multiplied by a constant.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the units of each option.

Take option A: Q = const * (μ r^-4) * (dp/dx).

Each of these has units:

μ: ML^-1 T^-1.

r^-4: L^-4.

dp/dx: MT^-2.

So, (μ r^-4) has units: M L^{-1} T^{-1} * L^{-4} = M L^{-5} T^{-1}.

Then, (dp/dx) has units M L^{-1} T^{-1}.

Multiplying these together: (M L^{-5} T^{-1}) * (M L^{-1} T^{-1}) ) → M² L^{-6} T^{-2}.

So, option A has Q with units M² L^{-6} T^{-2}, which isn't dimensionless.

Hmm, that's not correct.

Wait, let me compute each option:

Option A: Q = const * (μ) * (r^{-4}) * (dp/dx).

Units:

μ: M L^{-1} T^{-1}.

r^{-4}: L^{-4}.

dp/dx: M L^{-1} T^{-1}.

Multiply all together: M L^{-1} T^{-1} * L^{-4} * M L^{-1} T^{-1} = M^2 L^{-7} T^{-3}.

Not dimensionless.

Option B: Q = const * (r^3) / (μ (dp/dx)).

Units:

r^3: L^3.

μ (dp/dx): (M L^{-1} T^{-1}) * (M L^{-1} T^{-1}) ) → M² L^{-2} T^{-2}.

So, (r^3) / (μ (dp/dx)) → L^3 / (M² L^{-2} T^{-2}) ) → M^{-2} L^5 T^2.

Not dimensionless.

Option C: Q = const * (r^5) / (μ^2 (dp/dx)).

Units:

r^5: L^5.

μ^2 (dp/dx): (M² L^{-2} T^{-2}) ) * (M L^{-1} T^{-1}) ) → M^3 L^{-3} T^{-3}.

So, (r^5) / (μ^2 (dp/dx)) → L^5 / (M^3 L^{-3} T^{-3}) ) → M^{-3} L^8 T^{-3}.

Not dimensionless.

Option D: Q = const * (r^3 μ^2 (dp/dx)^{-1}).

Units:

r^3: L^3.

μ^2: M^2 L^{-2} T^{-2}.

(dp/dx)^{-1}: M L^2 T^{-2}.

Multiply all together: L^3 * M^2 L^{-2} T^{-2} * M L^2 T^{-2} → M^3 L^3 L^{-2} L^2 T^{-2} T^{-2} → M^3 L^3 * L^{0} T^{-4} → M^3 L^3 T^{-4}.

Not dimensionless.

Wait, but this can't be, because all the options are not dimensionless. But the question must have one correct option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the correct dimensionless parameter is Ψ = Q/(r^4 μ (dp/dx)).

So, Ψ = Q/(r^4 μ (dp/dx)).

Thus, Q = Ψ r^4 μ (dp/dx).

So, the correct expression is Q = Ψ r^4 μ (dp/dx), where Ψ is dimensionless.

Looking at the options, perhaps option A can be rewritten as Q = (μ/r^4) * (dp/dx) * const.

Which is Q = const * (μ (dp/dx)) / r^4.

Which is the same as Ψ = const * (μ (dp/dx)) / r^4.

So, the correct option is A because it represents the correct dimensionless combination.

Wait, no. Because Ψ is the dimensionless parameter. So, option A represents Ψ, but multiplied by a constant. So, perhaps the correct option is A, because it's the correct form.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A because it correctly represents the dimensionless combination.

Wait, but I'm getting confused, and perhaps I should think of the answer options again.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Q = const * (μ / r^4) * (dp/dx)

Option B: Q = const * (r^3 / (μ (dp/dx)))

Option C: Q = const * (r^5 / (μ^2 (dp/dx)))

Option D: Q = const * (r^3 μ^2 (dp/dx)^{-1})

We established that the correct dimensionless parameter is Q/(r^4 μ (dp/dx))= Ψ.

So, the correct option is the one that includes Ψ as a function, but since none of the options have Ψ, the correct option is the one that correctly represents Ψ.

So, option A represents Ψ, but multiplied by a constant, which would make Ψ dimensionless. Because if you have a constant times a dimensionless quantity, the result is dimensionless.

Wait, but Ψ is dimensionless. So, option A is correct, because it represents Ψ.

But wait, the question is to express Q as a function in dimensionless form. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because it represents the dimensionless combination.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. 

The correct dimensionless parameter is Ψ = Q/(r^4 μ (dp/dx)).

Therefore, Q = Ψ r^4 μ (dp/dx).

So, the correct option is the one that represents Q as a function of Ψ, but since none of the options have Ψ, perhaps the correct option is option A, because it represents Ψ, and Q is proportional to Ψ.

So, the correct answer is option A.
</think>

The question involves rewriting the volume flux \( Q \) through laminar flow in a pipe as a dimensionless parameter. Using the power-product method, we determine that the dimensionless parameter is given by:

\[
\Psi = \frac{Q}{r^4 \mu \frac{d p}{d x}}
\]

This implies that:

\[
Q = \Psi r^4 \mu \frac{d p}{d x}
\]

The correct option must represent this relationship. Among the given options, **A** correctly represents the dimensionless parameter \(\Psi\), which is a key component in the expression for \(Q\). 

ANSWER: A
