Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the time it takes for an electromagnetic wave to reach a point 60 kilometers away. The wave's frequency is 40 kHz. Hmm, let's break this down.

Wait, electromagnetic waves, right. They travel at the speed of light, isn't it? Oh yeah, the speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second. So the speed (c) is 3e8 m/s.

The distance is 60 km. But wait, I should convert that into meters because the speed is in meters per second. So 60 km is 60,000 meters. So d = 6e4 meters.

Now, the time taken is distance divided by speed. So t = d / c. Plugging in the numbers: t = 6e4 m / 3e8 m/s. Let's compute that.

6e4 divided by 3e8 is the same as (6/3) * (1e4 / 1e8) = 2 * 1e-4 = 2e-4 seconds. Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, so 2e-4 is 0.0002 seconds. To convert that into milliseconds, since 1 millisecond is 1e-3 seconds, multiply by 1e3: 0.0002 * 1e3 = 0.2 milliseconds.

Wait, but let me double-check the units. Oh, I think I made a mistake in converting km to meters. Oh wait, wait. 60 km is 60,000 meters, right. So 60,000 / 300,000,000 = 0.0002 seconds. Which is 0.2 milliseconds. So the time is 0.2 milliseconds.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.2 msec. So the answer should be option I.

To calculate the time taken for the electromagnetic wave to reach a point 60 km away, we use the formula:

\[
t = \frac{d}{c}
\]

where \( d = 60 \, \text{km} = 60,000 \, \text{m} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting the values:

\[
t = \frac{60,000}{3 \times 10^8} = 2 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{s}
\]

Converting seconds to milliseconds (\( 1 \, \text{ms} = 10^{-3} \, \text{s} \)):

\[
t = 2 \times 10^{-4} \times 10^3 = 0.2 \, \text{ms}
\]

The correct answer is **0.2 milliseconds**, which corresponds to option **I**.

Answer: I
