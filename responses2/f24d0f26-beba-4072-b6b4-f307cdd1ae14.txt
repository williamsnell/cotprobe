Question:

A telephone survey of 400 registered voters showed that 256 had not yet made up their minds 1 month before the election. How sure can we be that between 60% and 68% of the electorate were still undecided at that time?

A: 75.5%
B: 90.4%
C: 48.5%
D: 50.2%
E: 64.0%
F: 2.4%

H: 86.7%
I: 8.0%
J: 30.0%

Answer:
    <think>
<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about a telephone survey and figuring out the confidence interval for the percentage of undecided voters. Hmm, I remember something about statistics from my studies, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me try to work through this.

So the question says a survey of 400 registered voters found 256 undecided. We need to find out how sure we can be that between 60% and 68% of the electorate were undecided. Oh wait, wait. No, actually, the question is phrased a bit differently. It's not exactly a confidence interval for the percentage of undecided voters in the whole population, but perhaps for the proportion of undecided voters in the entire electorate. Or maybe it's the margin of error? Wait, the wording says, "how sure can we be that between 60% and 68% of the electorate were still undecided." So it's a confidence interval for the population proportion, between 60% and 68%.

Wait, but 256 out of 400. Let me calculate that first. 256 divided by 400 is 0.64. So 64% of the surveyed voters were undecided. But the question is about the confidence interval for the entire population. So the point estimate is 64%, but the question is about the range of 60% to 68%. So the question is likely asking for the confidence level that the true proportion is between 60% and 68%, which is a 95% confidence interval, I think. Or maybe another confidence level.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about confidence intervals. The formula for a confidence interval for a proportion is usually (p ± z*(sqrt(p*(1-p)/n))), where p is the sample proportion, n is the sample size, and z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level.

But wait, the problem doesn't give us a confidence level, so perhaps it's asking what confidence level gives a confidence interval from 60% to 68%. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the margin of error, but the question is about the confidence interval.

Let me re-read the question: "how sure can we be that between 60% and 68% of the electorate were still undecided at that time?" So it's the confidence interval that covers the true proportion, from 60% to 68%. So I need to find the confidence level for which this interval is correct.

Wait, but the sample proportion is 64%, and the interval is 60% to 68%. So the interval is 60% to 68%, which is a 8% range. If the point estimate is 64%, then the interval is 4% below and 4% above (since 64-60=4, 68-64=4). So the margin of error is 4 percentage points. But wait, the margin of error is usually calculated as z*(sqrt(p(1-p)/n)). Let's compute that.

p = 0.64, n=400.

sqrt(0.64 * 0.36 / 400) = sqrt(0.2304 / 400) = sqrt(0.000576) = 0.024.

So z = margin of error / sqrt(p(1-p)/n) → 4% / 0.024 = approximately 16.666... So z is around 16.666, which is way beyond typical confidence levels. That doesn't make sense because confidence levels don't go that high. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the question is asking what confidence level corresponds to a 95% confidence interval, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's using a different method.

Wait another thought: maybe the question is about the margin of error, but the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the confidence interval but about the sampling error. But the wording is about "how sure can we be that between 60% and 68%...". So the idea is that the true proportion is between 60 and 68%, and we want the confidence level that this is true.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a question about the confidence interval around the point estimate of 64%, and the interval being between 60% and 68%, which is a 8% interval. But the standard margin of error for p=64% in n=400 is as I calculated, about 4.8%, but that's about ±4.8% from the point estimate. So the confidence interval would be 64 ± 4.8% → 59.2% to 68.8%. So that's a 95% confidence interval, because for 95% confidence, z is about 1.96.

Wait, let me check: 1.96 * sqrt(0.64*0.36/400) = 1.96 * 0.024 = approx 0.047, so 4.7% margin of error. So 64 ±4.7% is 59.3% to 68.7%. So that would be a 95% confidence interval.

But the question is asking for the confidence that the true is between 60% and 68%. So if the lower limit is 59.3% and the upper is 68.7%, then 60% is just above 59.3, and 68% is below 68.7. So the 95% confidence interval would include the 60% and 68% endpoints. So that would make sense.

Wait, but the point is, the question is about the confidence interval in terms of the population. So if the sample proportion is 64%, and the confidence interval is 95% with a margin of error of about 4.8%, then the interval is 59.2% to 68.8%. So the question is whether the true proportion is between 60% and 68%. Since 59.2% is just below 60% and 68.8% is just above 68%, the 95% confidence interval would include all values between 59.2% and 68.8%. So the 60% to 68% range is entirely within that interval. So we can be 95% confident that the true proportion is between 60% and 68%.

Wait, but wait, that's not exactly correct because the point is whether the true proportion is between 60% and 68%. The confidence interval is that the true proportion lies within 60% and 68% with 95% confidence. Or, is it that we can be 95% confident that the true proportion is within that interval? Either way, the way the question is phrased might imply that.

So the answer would be 95% confidence. Looking at the options, let's see. The options are A to J.

Options: A:75.5% B:90.4% C:48.5% D:50.2% E:64.0% F:2.4% G:98.2% H:86.7% I:8.0% J:30.0%

Wait, 95% isn't one of the options. Oh, wait, no. Wait the options don't have 95%. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options given:

A:75.5%
B:90.4%
C:48.5%
D:50.2%
E:64.0%
F:2.4%
G:98.2%
H:86.7%
I:8.0%
J:30.0%

Hmm. Wait, I'm confused. None of these options is 95%. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the question is: "How sure can we be that between 60% and 68% of the electorate were still undecided?"

So the point is, the true proportion is between 60% and 68%, and we need to find the confidence level that this is accurate.

Wait, but the calculation I did earlier: the point estimate is 64%, with a 95% confidence interval of 59.2% to 68.8%. So the interval 60% to 68% is entirely within the 95% confidence interval. So the confidence that the true proportion is between 60% and 68% is 95%. But the options don't have 95%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the question. Maybe it's not about the 95% confidence interval. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the confidence level such that the true proportion is between 60% and 68%, which is a 8% range. So, the question is, what confidence level corresponds to a confidence interval that is 8% wide, centered at 64%, with a sample size of 400.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mistaken, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is in reference to the standard error. Let me think about the standard error: sqrt(p*(1-p)/n) = sqrt(0.64*0.36/400) = sqrt(0.2304/400) = sqrt(0.000576) = 0.024. So the standard error is 2.4%.

The confidence interval is usually expressed as point estimate ± z * SE. If the question is saying that the interval is 60% to 68%, which is 4% on either side, then z = 4% / 2.4% ≈ 1.666... So z is approximately 1.666. What is that in terms of confidence level? For z=1.645, it's about 90%; for 1.96, it's 95%. So 1.666 is between 1.645 and 1.96. So the confidence level would be between 90% and 95%.

But the options don't have 90% or 95%. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is about the confidence interval in terms of the proportion, not the margin. So for the proportion to be between 60% and 68% with a sample proportion of 64%, what confidence level gives this interval.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the confidence interval for the population proportion, given a sample proportion of 64% and a sample size of 400. Then using the normal approximation, the confidence interval is 64 ± z * sqrt(0.64*0.36/400).

So, for the interval to be 60% to 68%, the lower bound is 64 - 4 = 60, and upper is 64 + 4 = 68.

So, 4 = z * 0.024.

So z = 4 / 0.024 ≈ 166.666.

But wait, that's impossible because z can't be that high. So that suggests that the confidence interval would be way outside of the given range, implying that the confidence level is way higher than any provided. But again, the options don't have such a high value.

So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the question is about the confidence interval for the proportion, using the Wald method, and the question is trying to find the confidence level such that the interval captures 60% to 68%. But in the calculation, the z value is way beyond standard confidence levels, so perhaps the answer isn't among the options. But that's not possible because the options are provided.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is about the margin of error, and the given interval is 60% to 68%, so the margin of error is 4%, and the sample size is 400. Then the confidence interval is 64 ±4%, which would imply a margin of error of 4% and a confidence level that corresponds to a z-score of 4 / (sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)).

Wait, let's recalculate. The margin of error (E) is 4%. So E = z * sqrt(0.64 * 0.36 / 400) = z * 0.024.

So 4% = z * 0.024 → z = 4 / 0.024 = 166.666, which is impossible. So that indicates that the confidence level is way higher than any possible option given. However, the options don't have 95% or 98.2% perhaps. Wait, option G is 98.2%. Let me compute what that z-score would be.

For 98.2% confidence, z is approximately 2.35. Let's see what the margin of error would be at z=2.35.

E = 2.35 * 0.024 ≈ 0.0564 → 5.64%.

But the question's interval is 4% (from 60 to 64, and 64 to 68 is 4% as well). So 5.64% margin would capture 60% to 68% interval. But that's a higher confidence level than any provided option. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but since the options don't have such a high value, I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the confidence interval in a different way. Maybe it's a hypothesis test, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: the question is about the confidence interval. Let me think again about the formula.

The confidence interval is: p ± z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n).

We want the interval to be 60% to 68%, which is 4% on either side of the point estimate of 64%. So:

60 = 64 - z * sqrt(0.64*0.36/400)
68 = 64 + z * sqrt(0.64*0.36/400)

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives 8 = 2*z*sqrt(0.2304/400). Let me compute sqrt(0.2304 / 400) = sqrt(0.000576) = 0.024.

So 8 = 2*z*0.024 → 8 = 0.048 z → z = 8 / 0.048 ≈ 166.666. Again, impossible. So this suggests that the confidence interval can't be that wide unless the confidence level is way higher than any given. So perhaps the question is wrong, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the question is instead about the standard error and the confidence interval. Let me think about how many standard errors the interval spans.

The point is 64%, and the interval is 60% to 68%, which is 4% on either side. So that's 4% / 0.024 (the standard error) ≈ 166.666 standard errors. So the confidence level is about 100% - (1 - 1.666) * 2? Wait, no, standard normal distribution:

For a two-tailed test, the confidence level is 1 - α, where α is the probability in both tails. So if z=1.666, the area beyond that is about 5% (since z=1.645 is 90%, z=1.96 is 95%). But 1.666 is between 1.645 and 1.96. So the confidence level would be between 90% and 95%. Looking at the options, none of them are in that range.

Wait, the options are A:75.5%, B:90.4%, C:48.5%, D:50.2%, E:64.0%, F:2.4%, G:98.2%, H:86.7%, I:8.0%, J:30.0%.

Hmm. So the only options in the 90-95% range are perhaps none. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the confidence interval in the sense of the standard error being 4% (as in, the interval is 4% wide), which would be a z-score of 1. So 0.024 * z = 0.04 → z= (0.04)/0.024 ≈ 1.666. So z≈1.666. Looking at the options, the closest is 1.96 (for 95%) which is a higher z. But that would correspond to a confidence level of about 90.4% (since for z=1.645, it's 90%, and for z=1.96, it's 95%). Wait, 1.666 is about 95.2% confidence level. Because for z=1.96, it's 95%.

Wait, but none of the options are 95%. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options don't have 95%. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate the standard error. p=0.64, n=400.

p(1-p) = 0.64 * 0.36 = 0.2304.

Divide by n: 0.2304 / 400 = 0.000576.

Square root: sqrt(0.000576) = 0.024.

So the standard error is 0.024. The interval is 60% to 68%, which is 4% from the point estimate.

So 4% = z * 0.024 → z = 4 / 0.024 ≈ 166.666. But that can't be, because that's way beyond any standard confidence level.

Wait, maybe the question is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the confidence interval in terms of the standard error being 4%, not the sample proportion.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the confidence interval for the population proportion, given a sample proportion of 0.64 and a sample size of 400, and the interval is 60% to 68%, which is 4% wide. So the z-score is 4% / SE = 4% / 2.4% = 1.666.

Looking for a z-score of about 1.666, which would correspond to a confidence level of about 95.2%. But again, that's not one of the options.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is using the formula for the confidence interval but with a different standard error. Or perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the confidence level based on the interval being 60% to 68%, which is 8% wide, so the margin of error is 4%, so z=4 / SE.

Wait, perhaps the question is correct, but the options are wrong. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the confidence interval using the normal approximation without considering the z-score. For example, perhaps using the confidence interval formula and plugging in the numbers to find the confidence level.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking what confidence level would result in the interval being 60% to 68%, which is 4% on each side. So the margin of error is 4%, which requires a z-score of 4/SE.

But then, perhaps it's not possible, so the correct answer isn't among the options. But the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculations. Let me try a different approach.

The confidence interval is given by p ± z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n).

We are told that the interval is 60% to 68%, which is a 8% range. The point estimate is 64%, so the interval extends 4% below and above.

So the margin of error is 4%, which equals z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n).

So 4 = z * (0.024).

So z = 4 / 0.024 ≈ 166.666.

That's impossible because z can't be that high. So perhaps the question is incorrect, but let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps the options are for the confidence level in terms of the interval. For example, perhaps the interval is 60% to 68%, which is 8% wide, and the confidence level is 95.2%, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the confidence interval of the standard error. Let me think: perhaps the question is asking for the confidence interval around the standard error, but that's not standard practice.

Hmm. I'm stuck because my calculations don't match any of the options provided. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps the question is asking for the confidence interval of the sample proportion, and the given interval is 60% to 68%, which is 4% on each side. So the standard error is 4% / z.

Assuming a z-score of 1.96 (for 95% confidence), the standard error would be 4% / 1.96 ≈ 2.04%. Let's compute the sample proportion: sqrt(p(1-p)/n) = 2.04% → p(1-p) = (0.0204)^2 * n = 0.000416 * 400 = 0.1664 → p^2 - 0.1664 p + 0.1664 = 0. So solving for p, but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the confidence interval in terms of the confidence level. For example, perhaps the question is asking for the confidence level that the interval is 60% to 68%, which would be 95.2%, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest would be G:98.2%. Because 98.2% would correspond to a z-score of approximately 2.35 (since z=2.35 gives a confidence level of 98.2%). So if the margin of error is 4%, then z=4/0.024≈166.666, which is way above 2.35.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question again. Another way to approach this is to compute the confidence interval and see which of the options fits.

So, given p=0.64, n=400.

Compute the confidence interval using a 95% confidence level (z=1.96).

SE = sqrt(0.64 * 0.36 / 400) = sqrt(0.2304 / 400) = sqrt(0.000576) = 0.024.

Margin of error (ME) = z * SE = 1.96 * 0.024 = 0.04704.

So the confidence interval is 0.64 ± 0.04704 → 0.64 - 0.04704 = 0.59296 → 59.3%, and 0.64 + 0.04704 = 0.68704 → 68.7%.

So the confidence interval is 59.3% to 68.7%. The question is about whether the true proportion is between 60% and 68% with a confidence level. If we choose 95%, the confidence interval is 59.3% to 68.7%, which covers the true proportion (say, 64%) within that interval. So with 95% confidence, we can say that the true proportion is between 59.3% and 68.7%.

But the question is about the interval 60% to 68%. So, 60% is within the 59.3% to 68.7% interval. So, with 95% confidence, the true proportion is less than 68.7%, which is higher than 60%. But the question is about whether the true proportion is between 60% and 68%, which is a narrower range.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the confidence interval for the mean, and the given interval is 60% to 68%, so the confidence level is 95%.

Wait, but the options don't have 95%. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the confidence interval for the population proportion, and the given interval is 60% to 68%, which is 8% wide. So, the confidence level is 95.2%, as calculated earlier.

Wait, but the options don't include 95.2%, so perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But the question is presented as if one of the options is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check again.

The point is 64%, which is the point estimate. The interval is 60% to 68%, which is 4% on either side. So, the margin of error is 4%.

The margin of error is calculated as z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n).

So, 4 = z * sqrt(0.64 * 0.36 / 400).

Compute sqrt(0.2304 / 400) = sqrt(0.000576) = 0.024.

So, 4 = z * 0.024 → z = 4 / 0.024 = 166.666.

So z≈166.666. That's impossible because the maximum z is about 3.496 for 99.9% confidence.

So, this suggests that the confidence level is not possible with any of the given options. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not provided, but since the options are given, perhaps I should choose the closest one.

Wait, looking at the options, the only higher confidence level than the given options is G:98.2%. But 98.2% corresponds to a z-score of approximately 2.35, which would result in a margin of error of 2.35 * 0.024 ≈ 0.0564 → 5.64%.

So, the confidence interval would be 64 ±4% → 60% to 68%. So, with a confidence level of 98.2%, the interval is 60% to 68%.

So, perhaps the correct answer is G:98.2%. Because with a confidence level of 98.2%, the interval is 60% to 68%.

But wait, in this case, the confidence level is higher than any given option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but if I have to choose the closest one, G:98.2% is the best choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the confidence interval in terms of the sample proportion, and the given interval is 60% to 68%, which is 4% wide. So the margin of error is 4%, which would correspond to a z-score of 4 / (sqrt(p(1-p)/n)).

Wait, but that's the same as before.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the question is about the confidence interval for the population proportion, and the given interval is 60% to 68%, which is 8% wide. So the confidence level is 95.2%, as before.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is not listed. However, since the question is provided, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me try one more time.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the confidence interval for the population proportion, using the given point estimate and sample size. The formula is:

p ± z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n)

We can plug in p=0.64, n=400, and the interval being 60% to 68%.

So, the point is 64%, and the interval is 60% to 68%, which is a margin of error of 4%.

So, 4 = z * sqrt(0.64 * 0.36 / 400) → 4 = z * 0.024 → z = 4 / 0.024 = 166.666.

Again, same result.

So, given that, the confidence level is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but the closest option would be G:98.2%.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the confidence interval for the mean, and the given interval is 60% to 68%, which is 4% on either side. So, the confidence level would be 95%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: the options are all percentages, except for option D:50.2%, which is a percentage. So perhaps the correct answer is G:98.2%, as that's the only one that makes sense in the context of the margin of error.

So, after going through all the calculations and thinking, I think the correct answer is G:98.2%.
</think>

The correct answer is **G:98.2%**.

**Explanation:**

The question involves calculating the confidence interval for the population proportion. Given a point estimate of 64% and a sample size of 400, the confidence interval is determined to be 60% to 68%. This corresponds to a margin of error of 4%. Using the formula for the confidence interval, we calculate the z-score as 166.666, which is impossible. However, the closest option to a plausible confidence level is **98.2%**, which corresponds to a z-score of approximately 2.35. Despite the mismatch, this is the best choice provided. 

ANSWER: G
