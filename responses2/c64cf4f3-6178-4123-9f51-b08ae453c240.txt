Okay, so I've got this question about chemical kinetics, specifically about the order of a rate equation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me the rate equation for the formation of water: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O. The rate expression is given as rate = k[H₂]^2 [H₂O]. I need to find the overall order of this reaction.

Wait, what's the overall order again? Oh right, the overall order is the sum of the exponents of the concentrations in the rate law. So each [ ] represents the concentration, and the exponent is the order with respect to that reactant.

Looking at the equation, the rate is proportional to [H₂]^2 and [H₂O]^1. So the exponents are 2 and 1. Adding them together: 2 +1 =3. So the overall order should be 3.

Now, looking at the options. Option B is third order overall. So the answer should be B.

The overall order of the reaction is determined by summing the exponents of the concentrations in the rate equation. For the given rate law:

\[
\text{rate} = k[H_2]^2[H_2O]
\]

The exponents are 2 for \([H_2]\) and 1 for \([H_2O]\). Adding these gives:

\[
2 + 1 = 3
\]

Thus, the overall order of the reaction is third order. 

Answer: B
