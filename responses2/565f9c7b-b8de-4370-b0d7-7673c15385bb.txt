Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating Albert Morgan's commission from selling C.B. radios. Let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question states that Albert sells radios and earns a 5% commission. His sales this week were $3,500. The question is asking how much he earned in commission.

Hmm, right. So, commission is a percentage of the sales amount. I remember that percentage calculations involve multiplying the percentage by the total amount. So here, I need to calculate 5% of $3,500.

Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. The formula for commission is (Commission Rate) × (Total Sales). So, 5% as a decimal is 0.05. Multiply that by 3,500.

Let me do the math. 5% of 3,500 is the same as 0.05 multiplied by 3500. Let me calculate that. 0.05 times 3500. Hmm, 0.01 times 3500 is 35, so 0.05 is five times that. 35 times 5 is 175. So, 0.05 × 3500 = 175.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I make mistakes. 3500 divided by 100 is 35, so 5% is five times that. 35 times 5 is indeed 175. So, he earns $175.

Looking at the options, I see that option D is $175. So, the correct answer should be D.

I don't see any other options that make sense here. The commission is based on the total sales, and it's a straightforward percentage calculation. So, I'm pretty confident the answer is D.

The commission earned is calculated by multiplying the sales amount by the commission rate. 

Commission = $3,500 × 5% = $3,500 × 0.05 = $175.

ANSWER: D
