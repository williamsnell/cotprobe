Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about securitization issues. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking under what condition an issue would fail to become securitized. The options are A, B, and C.

First, I should remember what securitization entails. Securitization is when a problem is transformed into a financial instrument, typically a bond, to mitigate risk. So it's about converting a challenge into something that can be sold and bought on the market.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the issue fails when the securitizing actor isn't granted the right to implement an extraordinary measure. Wait, why would that happen? If the actor isn't allowed to do the necessary steps, maybe the issue can't be addressed, so it wouldn't be securitized. Or perhaps the actor is granted the right, but it's not implemented. So the issue doesn't become securitized because the right isn't applied. But I'm not sure if that's the correct scenario.

Option B mentions the audience granting the actor the special rights but the actor fails to address the threat. So the actor gets the right, but they can't do their part. That would make the issue not securitized. Because the actor can't implement the needed measures. So in this case, the issue fails to become securitized because the actor can't act on the threat.

Option C is about the discursive element not implementing extraordinary measures. The discursive element is part of the process, right? If during the discussion phase they don't take the extra steps needed for securitization, the issue remains unresolved. So the issue isn't securitized because the process doesn't include implementing the necessary measures.

Wait, but what's the difference between option C and B? Let me think. The question is about when the issue doesn't become securitized. So both B and C seem plausible.

In option B, the issue is not addressed because the actor can't take action. So the process fails to implement the required steps. Similarly, in C, the discursives don't get to the point where the measures are implemented.

But wait, the question is about when the issue fails to become securitized. So if the actor isn't granted the right, it might not get that measure. If the actor fails to take the action, that's also an issue. If the process doesn't include implementing the measures, like the discursives not moving forward, that's another point.

Hmm. Let me recall what each option means.

Option C: Following the discursive element, which I think is the discussion phase, if they don't implement the measures, the issue isn't securitized. So the process, after discursives, doesn't proceed to securization steps.

Option B: The actor gets the rights, but fails to address the threat. So the actor can't do their part, meaning the issue isn't securitized because the actor can't take the necessary measures.

So both B and C seem possible. But I need to think about the exact process. Securization is a process where the issue is converted into a security instrument. This usually involves several steps, including the initial assessment, the actor's role, and implementing the measures.

So the process might include checking the actor's capacity to implement the needed extraordinary measures (like option A). If the actor isn't allowed to do that, the issue can't be securitized. So option A is about not granting the right to implement the measure.

But the question is about when the issue fails to become securitized. So the failure could be due to the actor not taking the required action (option B) or the process not implementing the needed steps (option C). 

Wait, but in option C, it's about the discursives not implementing the measures. The discursives are the discussion phase. So if the process fails to move to the securization steps, it's not completed. So the issue isn't securitized because the process didn't take the necessary action.

So, the question is when the issue fails to become securitized. So the correct answer might be either B or C.

Wait, let me think again. The process for securitization might involve several stages, including the initial assessment, the actor's role, and implementing the measures. If the actor isn't allowed to do the extra steps (like option A), the issue isn't securitized because the right isn't applied. So the failure is due to the actor not being allowed to take the necessary steps, which is covered in option A.

But in option B, the issue fails because the actor can't address the threat. So, the actor is granted the right (so they can act), but they can't do their part. So the process fails to implement the required action, making the issue not securitized.

Alternatively, if the process fails to implement the necessary steps (like in option C), then the issue isn't securitized because the measures aren't taken.

So the question is, which of these is the correct reason for the issue not being securitized. The options are A, B, C.

I think the correct answer is C: when, following the discursive element, the measures are not implemented. Because the discursive element is part of the process where they discuss and decide on the next steps. If the measures aren't implemented, then the process fails to securitize the issue.

Alternatively, option B implies that the actor can take the action but doesn't. So the actor might have acted, but perhaps the measures aren't implemented beyond that.

Wait, maybe it's the actor's ability to implement the measures that determines whether the issue is securitized. If the actor isn't allowed to do the extra steps, it fails. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of the process. After the initial assessment, the actor is supposed to take certain actions (the right to implement). If the actor isn't allowed to do that (option A), then the issue isn't securitized. So the failure would be because the actor isn't given the right to implement the measure.

But in option B, the actor is given the right but can't act on the threat. So the actor can take the action, but fails to do so. So the issue isn't securitized because the actor can't act on the threat.

So I'm trying to find which of these is correct. The question is about when the issue fails to become securitized. So if the actor is granted the right but can't implement, then the issue isn't securitized because the actor can't take the necessary action. So option B is the correct reason.

Alternatively, if the process doesn't implement the necessary steps (like option C), then the issue isn't securitized because the process doesn't include the measures.

So the question is probably about the actor not getting the right to implement the measure, which directly leads to failure. So option A says the actor is not granted the right to implement the measure. So the issue isn't securitized because the actor isn't allowed to take the action. So the failure is due to the actor's inability to implement the measure.

Wait, but the question is about when the issue fails to become securitized. So even if the actor is allowed to implement the measure, if they can't do their part, it's still a failure. So option B is about the actor failing to act after being granted the right.

So, the correct answer is B: When the audience grants the securitizing actor the special rights requested but the actor fails to address the proposed threat.

Wait, but the question says "when the issue fails to become securitized." So the process fails to implement the necessary steps, which would be option C. Or perhaps the actor can't take the right step because the process isn't executed.

Alternatively, perhaps the process requires the actor to implement the steps, but if they can't, the issue is not securitized.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: The actor isn't granted the right to implement the measure. So the process fails because the measure can't be implemented. So the issue isn't securitized.

Option B: The actor is granted the right but can't address the threat. So the measure isn't taken because the actor can't do their part. So the issue remains unresolved.

Option C: The discursive element doesn't implement the measures. So the process fails to move to the securization steps. So the issue isn't securitized.

The question is, which of these is the reason it fails to become securitized.

Hmm. I think the correct answer is B because the actor is granted the right, but they can't act on the threat. So the issue isn't securitized because the actor can't take the required action. That would mean the process can't proceed to implement the necessary steps.

Wait, but the question is about the issue failing to become securitized. So if the actor is granted the right but can't act, that leads to the issue not being securiized. So the answer is B.

Alternatively, if the process doesn't take the necessary steps (option C), then the issue isn't securitized.

Wait, but if the process doesn't take the necessary steps, then the securization process isn't completed, leading to the issue not being securitized.

So perhaps the correct answer is C.

I'm getting more confused. Let me think about the steps involved. Securization is a process where the problem is addressed by creating a financial instrument. This process likely includes several stages, including the initial assessment, where the actor must take certain steps to implement the necessary measures.

If the actor isn't allowed to perform these steps (option A), then the issue isn't securitized. So the failure is because the actor isn't granted the right to implement the measure.

But the question is about when the issue fails to become securitized. So the failure could be due to the actor not being able to take the required action (B) or the process not implementing the measures (C).

Wait, but the question is phrased as when the issue fails to become securitized. So all three options might not be correct, but they're the possible reasons.

Hmm. I think I've read that the failure to implement the required measures is when the issue isn't securitized because the process doesn't include the necessary steps. So the answer is C.

Alternatively, the actor may be allowed to implement but can't act on the threat, making the issue not securitized because the actor can't take the action. So B is also a possibility.

Wait, the question is about when the issue fails to become securitized. So the failure could be because the actor can't act on the issue (B) or the process doesn't take the necessary steps (C).

But let me think about the process. The discursive element is part of the discussion phase. So if the process doesn't include the necessary steps in the discursive element, then the measures aren't implemented, leading to the issue not being securitized.

So the correct answer is C.
</think>

The question asks under what condition an issue fails to become securitized. To determine the correct answer, we analyze each option:

1. **Option A**: This states that the securitizing actor is not granted the special right to implement extraordinary measures. If the actor isn't allowed to take the required steps, the issue fails to become securitized. This is a plausible reason.

2. **Option B**: This suggests the audience grants the actor the special rights but the actor fails to address the threat. While the actor can act after being granted the right, if they can't take the necessary action, the issue remains unresolved. This is another plausible reason for failure.

3. **Option C**: This refers to the discursive element of the process, which includes discussions and discussions about implementing the measures. If the process fails to execute the necessary steps, the issue isn't securitized. This is a more direct reason for failure.

After considering the roles and processes involved, **Option C** is the most accurate because it directly addresses the failure to implement the required measures, which is a critical step in converting the issue into a financial instrument.
