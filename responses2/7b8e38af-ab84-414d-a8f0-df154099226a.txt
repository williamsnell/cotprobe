Okay, so I've got this problem here about radioactive decay, and I need to figure out how many half-lives it takes to reduce 10.0 kg to 1.0 microgram. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that radioactive substances decay exponentially. So the formula for radioactive decay is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t_1/2), where N is the remaining amount, N0 is the initial amount, t is time, and t_1/2 is the half-life. But wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of half-lives directly.

The initial amount is 10,000 grams because 10 kg is 10,000 grams. The target is 1 microgram, which is 0.001 grams. Wait, no, microgram is 1e-6 grams. Oh wait, 1 gram is 1000 mg, so 1 microgram is 0.001 mg, which is 0.000001 grams. Let me confirm that: 1 gram = 1e3 mg → 1e6 micrograms. So 1 microgram is 1e-6 grams. Got it.

So the initial N0 is 10,000 grams, and the target N is 1e-6 grams. Let me set up the equation. But wait, I'm not sure if I can use the natural logarithm or if I can use the common logarithm. Oh right, because the equation involves exponents, so taking logs might help.

The formula I can use is: N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t_1/2). But solving for the number of half-lives, let's say n, where n = t / t_1/2. So then the equation becomes N = N0 * (1/2)^n. I can rearrange that to (1/2)^n = N / N0.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: ln( (1/2)^n ) = ln(N/N0). Using the logarithm power rule, that's n * ln(1/2) = ln(N/N0). So n = ln(N/N0) / ln(1/2). Since ln(1/2) is negative, n will be negative if N is less than N0. So we take the absolute value.

Wait, but maybe I should use base 10 logs. Let me think. Because in some textbooks, for half-life problems, people might use base 10, which might make calculations easier since 1/2 is 10^(-0.3010), because log10(1/2) is about -0.3010. So maybe using base 10 is better for easier calculation.

So let's try that. So (1/2)^n = (1e-6 g) / (10,000 g) = 1e-10. So (1/2)^n = 1e-10. Taking log10 of both sides: log10( (1/2)^n ) = log10(1e-10 ). The left side becomes n * log10(1/2). We know that log10(1/2) is approximately -0.3010. So:

n * (-0.3010) = -10.

Multiply both sides by -1: 0.3010 * n = 10. Then n = 10 / 0.3010 ≈ 33.222.

Wait, that's about 33.22 half-lives. Looking at the options, option G is 34, which is the closest. But wait, the options include 38, 34, etc. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation. So N0 is 10,000 grams, N is 1 microgram, which is 1e-6 grams. So N/N0 is (1e-6) / (1e4) = 1e-10. So yes, that's 1e-10. So (1/2)^n = 1e-10.

Taking log10: log10( (1/2)^n ) = log10(1e-10) → n * log10(1/2) = -10.

log10(1/2) is approximately -0.3010, so n * (-0.3010) = -10 → n = (-10)/(-0.3010) ≈ 33.222.

So that's about 33.22 half-lives. The options are G:34, which is the closest. So the correct answer should be G:34. Wait, but the options also include 38, 21, etc. Let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using natural logs as well to double-check.

Using ln: (1/2)^n = 1e-10 → ln(1/2^n) = ln(1e-10) → n ln(1/2) = ln(1e-10). So n = ln(1e-10)/ln(1/2).

Compute each part: ln(1e-10) = ln(1e-10) ≈ -23.02585093. ln(1/2) ≈ -0.6931471806.

So n ≈ (-23.02585093) / (-0.6931471806) ≈ 33.222. Same result as before. So about 33.22, which rounds to 33.22, so 33.22 is approximately 33.22. So the closest option is G (34), but wait, wait, the options are A-E and F, etc. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A:15

B:40

C:38

D:13

E:21

F:27

G:34

H:8

I:50

J:29

So 33.22 is approximately 33.2, so the closest option is 34 (G), but wait, looking again, option F is 27, which is too low. Oh wait, no, the correct approximate is around 33, so maybe the answer is 34? But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait another thing: sometimes problems can be a bit tricky about the direction of decay. Like, half-life is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. So the amount decreases by half each half-life. So for each half-life, the remaining amount is multiplied by 0.5.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of each half-life, what's the remaining amount. But no, I think the earlier approach is correct.

Let me think about how many half-lives are needed to go from 10,000 to 1 microgram. So each half-life, it's multiplied by 0.5.

So after n half-lives, the amount is 10,000 * (0.5)^n.

Set that equal to 1e-6 grams.

So 10,000 * (0.5)^n = 1e-6.

Divide both sides by 10,000: (0.5)^n = 1e-10.

Which is the same equation as before. So same result.

So n ≈ 33.22, which is approximately 33.22 half-lives. So the options go up to 50, but the correct is around 33. The options are A through J. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A:15

B:40

C:38

D:13

E:21

F:27

G:34

H:8

I:50

J:29

So the closest is 34, option G. So the answer should be G:34.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think if I made a mistake. Because 1 microgram is 1e-6 grams, but wait, the initial amount is 10.0 kg, which is 10,000 grams. So the ratio is 1e-6 / 1e4 = 1e-10, which is correct.

Wait another thing: perhaps the problem is considering the number of half-lives as the exact value, but none of the options are around 33.22. But the closest is 34, which is option G.

But wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, another way: 1e-10 is how much? It's 1e-10, so (1/2)^n = 1e-10.

Taking the logarithm base 10: log10( (1/2)^n ) = log10(1e-10) → n * log10(1/2) = -10.

log10(1/2) is approximately -0.3010, so n = 10 / 0.3010 ≈ 33.22.

So, 33.22 half-lives.

Looking at the options, the only option near 33 is 34. So the answer is G:34.

Wait, but wait, the options also include 38. Why is that? Let me think if I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of moles or something else.

Wait wait, maybe I forgot to count the initial state, but no, the formula should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use natural logs and see.

Using natural logs: (1/2)^n = 1e-10 → ln( (1/2)^n ) = ln(1e-10) → n * ln(1/2) = ln(1e-10).

Compute ln(1e-10) ≈ -23.02585.

ln(1/2) ≈ -0.693147.

n = (-23.02585) / (-0.693147) ≈ 33.222.

So again, the same result.

So the correct number of half-lives is approximately 33.22, which is about 33.2. So the closest option is 34 (G).

So the answer is G:34.

To determine how many half-lives are required to reduce 10.0 kg (10,000 g) of a radioactive substance to 1.0 microgram (1e-6 g), we use the exponential decay formula:

\[
N = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n
\]

where \(N_0 = 10,000 \, \text{g}\) is the initial amount, \(N = 1 \, \mu\text{g} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{g}\) is the target amount, and \(n\) is the number of half-lives. Rearranging for \(n\):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \frac{N}{N_0} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-6}}{10,000} = 1 \times 10^{-10}
\]

Taking the base-10 logarithm:

\[
\log_{10}\left(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\right) = \log_{10}(1 \times 10^{-10})
\]

Using the logarithm power rule:

\[
n \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -10
\]

Since \(\log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \approx -0.3010\):

\[
n \cdot (-0.3010) = -10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = \frac{-10}{-0.3010} \approx 33.22
\]

Thus, approximately 33.22 half-lives are required. Among the provided options, the closest value is **34** (option G). Therefore, the correct answer is:
