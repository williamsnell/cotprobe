Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says to find the value of this infinite product: the product from n equals 0 to infinity of (1 plus (1/2) raised to the power of 2^n). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but maybe I can figure it out step by step.

First, I remember that infinite products can sometimes be tricky, but maybe there's a pattern or a known formula for products like this. Each term in the product is of the form (1 + x^{2^n}), which makes me think about binary representations or something related to exponents. Oh wait, I think I've heard something about products related to (1 + 1/2) and (1 + 1/4), etc., which multiply up to something.

Let me write out the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern. The first term is when n=0: (1 + 1/2) = 3/2. Next, n=1: (1 + 1/4) = 5/4. Then n=2: (1 + 1/8) = 9/8. n=3: (1 + 1/16) = 17/16. Hmm, each time, the numerator is one more than the denominator. Wait, that seems like each term is just (2^{n+1} + 1)/2^{n+1}.

Wait, but when I multiply them together, maybe there's a telescoping effect. Like, each term might be (something) that cancels with the next term. I remember that for certain products, especially geometric ones, the terms can simplify when multiplied. Let me test this idea.

Suppose I take the product up to n=k, and see what it looks like. Let's compute the product S_k = product from n=0 to k of (1 + (1/2)^{2^n}).

Let me compute S_0: 3/2 = 1.5.

S_1: 3/2 * 5/4 = (3*5)/(2*4) = 15/8 = 1.875.

S_2: 15/8 * 9/8 = (15*9)/(8*8) = 135/64 ≈ 2.109375.

S_3: 135/64 * 17/16 = (135*17)/(64*16) = (2295)/(1024) ≈ 2.2373046875.

Wait, but wait a minute. I'm noticing that each term is getting closer to 2.2 or something. Let me calculate a few more terms to see the trend.

S_4 would be S_3 multiplied by (1 + (1/2)^{16}) = 1 + 1/65536 ≈ 65537/65536.

So S_4 ≈ 2.2373046875 * (65537/65536) ≈ (2.2373046875 *65537)/65536.

Wait, that's getting a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this product. I think I've heard that the infinite product equals 2. But let me think why.

Another approach is to consider the binary expansion of the product. Alternatively, considering that each term is (1 + x^{2^n}), and when you multiply such terms, it's like building up a binary number. Wait, perhaps there's a telescoping product here because each step adds another binary digit or something. 

Wait, perhaps the infinite product is equal to 2. Because each step adds a term that contributes to a binary expansion, and the product builds up to 2. Let me check with S_3 which was approximately 2.2373. Hmm, that's more than 2, but as we go to infinity, does it approach 2?

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of binary fractions. Wait, no, because each term is a fraction. Alternatively, considering that each term in the product is (1 + (1/2)^{2^n}), which is (1 + 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + ... ), but that's not exactly the same. Wait, no, each term is 1 + 1/(2^{2^n}).

Wait, but I think that the product can be expressed as 2 because each step doubles the previous product. Let me see: 

Wait, let's test the product up to n=0: 3/2 = 1.5.

Then, product up to n=1: 3/2 *5/4 = (3*5)/(2*4) = 15/8 = 1.875.

Product up to n=2: 15/8 *9/8 = 135/64 ≈2.109375.

Product up to n=3: 135/64 * 17/16 = (135*17)/(64*16) = 2295/1024 ≈ 2.2373046875.

Product up to n=4: Approximately 2.2373046875 * (65537/65536) = approx 2.2373046875 * 1.000015258789 ≈ 2.2373046875 + 2.2373046875 * 0.000015258789 ≈ 2.2373046875 + approx 0.0000343 ≈ 2.2373389875.

Hmm, so each term adds a very small value, but the product is approaching 2.2373... as n increases. So the actual infinite product must be larger than 2, but wait, isn't 2.2373 larger than 2? But wait, earlier I thought it might be 2. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me try to find a general formula for the product.

I've heard that the infinite product of (1 + x^{2^n}) for n from 0 to infinity equals 1/(1 - x) when |x| < 1. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Or is it a different formula?

Wait, no, the product from n=0 to infinity of (1 + x^{2^n}) is known to be equal to 1/(1 - x) for |x| < 1. Let me test this with x=1/2.

So, product would be (1 + 1/2) * (1 + 1/4) * (1 + 1/8) * ... = 1/(1 - 1/2) = 2. Oh wait, yes! So that would mean that the product equals 2. So the correct answer is 2.0, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated up to n=3, I got approximately 2.2373, which is higher than 2. But according to this formula, the infinite product is exactly 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the partial product calculation.

Let me re-calculate S_3 correctly.

S_0: 3/2 = 1.5.

S_1: 1.5 * (1 + 1/4) = 1.5 * 5/4 = (1.5 *5)/4 = 7.5/4 = 1.875.

S_2: 1.875 * (1 + 1/8) = 1.875 * 9/8 = (1.875 *9)/8. 1.875 is 15/8. So 15/8 *9/8 = (15*9)/(8*8) = 135/64 ≈2.109375.

S_3: 135/64 * (1 + 1/16) = 135/64 * 17/16 = (135 *17)/(64*16) = 2295/1024 ≈2.2373046875.

Wait, but according to the formula, it should be 2. So maybe my partial product calculation is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, and I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 135/64 *17/16.

Let me compute 135 *17: 135 *10 = 1350, 135*7=945. So 1350 +945 = 2295.

Denominator: 64 *16 = 1024.

So 2295/1024 is indeed the product up to n=3, which is approximately 2.2373.

But then, according to the formula, the product should be 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the formula is not directly applicable here because each term is (1 + x^{2^n}), but the product formula I remember is for (1 + x)(1 + x^2)(1 + x^4)... which equals 1/(1 - x) when |x|<1. So in our case, x is 1/2, so that product would be 1/(1 -1/2)=2.

So, substituting x=1/2, the product from n=0 to infinity of (1 + (1/2)^{2^n}) equals 2. So the correct answer is option B, 2.0.

Wait, but earlier my partial product up to n=3 was 2.2373, which is bigger than 2. How is that possible? Because the product should approach 2 as n increases. Wait, but maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, let's compute S_3 correctly. S_3 = 2295/1024. Let me compute that: 1024*2=2048. 2295-2048=247. So 247/1024 ≈ 0.241015625. So the total product is 2.2373046875, which is indeed approximately 2.2373.

But as we take more terms, each term is (1 + 1/2^{2^n}), which is (1 + 1/4, 1/16, etc.). So each term is getting smaller and smaller, but each term is (1 + something small). So for example, the next term after n=3 is (1 + 1/65536) = 65537/65536 ≈1.000015258789.

So, when multiplied, each term adds a small fraction, but the total product approaches 2. Let me compute a few more terms to see the trend.

S_4 would be S_3 * (1 + 1/65536) = 2295/1024 * 65537/65536.

Let me compute that. 2295 * 65537 and 1024 *65536.

Wait, 2295 *65537 = let's compute that. First, 2295 * 65536 = 2295 *65536. But 65536 is 2^16, which is 65536. So 2295*65536 is 2295*65536, then multiply by 1/65536 and 1/1024. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the product as (2295 *65537)/(1024 *65536).

Wait, 1024 *65536 = 1024 *65536 = 65536 *1024 = 67108864.

2295 *65537: Let's compute this. 2295 *65537 = ?

Wait, 2295 *65536 = (2295 * 2^16) = 2295 * 65536.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me compute 2295 *65537 as follows:

2295 *65537 = 2295*(60000 + 5537) = 2295*60000 + 2295*5537.

2295 *60000 = 2295 *6 * 10^4 = (13770) *10^4 = 137700000.

2295 *5537: Let's compute 2295*5000=11,475,000; 2295*500=1,147,500; 2295*37=84, 615. So adding those: 11,475,000 + 1,147,500 = 12,622,500; plus 84,615 is 12,707,115.

So total 2295*65537 =13,770,0000 + 12,707,115=26,477,115.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the multiplication order. Let's do it step by step.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to note that 65537 is 2^16 +1, but perhaps it's easier to compute 2295 *65537 as follows: 2295 is 2000 + 295.

So, 2000 *65537 = 131,074,000.

295 *65537: Let's compute 300 *65537 = 19,661,100; minus 5 *65537 (327,685) gives 19,661,100 - 327,685 = 19,333,415.

So total 295*65537=19,333,415.

So 2295 *65537 = 131,074,000 +19,333,415 = 150,407,415.

Then, the numerator is 150,407,415 and the denominator is 67,108,864.

So, 150,407,415 /67,108,864 ≈ 2.2373046875 * (1 + 1/65536) = 2.2373046875 * 1.000015258789.

Wait, but that's the same as before. So S_4 is 2295/1024 * 65537/65536 = (2295 *65537)/(1024 *65536) = 150,407,415 / 67,108,864.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1: 150,407,415 ÷67,108,864 ≈2.2373046875 *1.000015258789 ≈2.2373046875 + 2.2373046875 *0.000015258789.

Compute the second term: 2.2373046875 * 0.000015258789 ≈ approx 0.0000343.

So total is approximately 2.2373389875.

So S_4 ≈2.2373389875.

Continuing to S_5: multiply by (1 +1/2^{32})=1 +1/4294967296 ≈1.00000000023283.

So S_5 = 2.2373389875 * 1.000000000023283 ≈2.2373389875 + 0.000000000525 ≈2.237338988.

Wait, but all the terms are getting multiplied, but the product is approaching 2. But according to the formula, the product should be 2. So perhaps my earlier assumption was wrong, and the product actually equals 2. So the correct answer is B:2.0.

Wait, but then when I calculated S_3, it was 2.2373... and S_4 is even closer to 2.237. That would mean that the product is approaching 2 from above, but according to the formula, the product equals 2. So I must have made a mistake in the formula application. Maybe the formula is when each term is (1 + x^{2^k}) for k from 1 to infinity, or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should check a source. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 2, but each term contributes to the product in such a way that the product approaches 2. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 2, so the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a step in the formula. Another thought: perhaps the product is 2, but each term in the product is (1 + x^{2^k}), and the product equals 1/(1 -x). Wait, for x=1/2, that would give 2. So the product should be 2. So the correct answer is B, 2.0.

Wait, but then why did my partial product up to n=3 give a value higher than 2? That must mean I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the product up to n=3.

n=0: 3/2 =1.5.

n=1:1.5 * (1 +1/4)=1.5*(5/4)=7.5/4=1.875.

n=2:1.875 * (1 +1/16)=1.875 *17/16.

17/16=1.0625.

1.875 *1.0625 = let's compute 1.875 *1 =1.875, 1.875 *0.0625=0.1171875. So total is 2. (1.875 +0.1171875=2.0). Wait, no, wait, 1.875 *1.0625 is 1.875 * (1 + 0.0625) =1.875 + (1.875 *0.0625)=1.875 +0.1171875=2. So that's the product up to n=2.

Wait, but that's a mistake. Because 1.875 *17/16 is equal to 1.875 * (1 + 1/16) =1.875 + (1.875 *1/16) =1.875 + 0.1171875=2.0. So the product up to n=2 is exactly 2.0. Wait, that's a problem because earlier partial product was 2.2373 for n=3, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps my initial approach was wrong, and the product actually equals 2.0.

Wait, let me think again. The product from n=0 to infinity of (1 + x^{2^n}) equals 1/(1 -x), for |x| <1. So if x=1/2, then 1/(1 -1/2)=2. So the product should be 2.0. So the correct answer is B:2.0.

Wait, but earlier when I thought each term contributes to the product, I thought the product would approach 2. So perhaps the correct answer is B:2.0.

So, the answer is option B:2.0.

Wait, but then why when I calculated up to n=3, I got 2.2373...? Because according to the formula, the product is 2. So perhaps my earlier calculation was wrong. Let me re-calculate the product up to n=3.

n=0:3/2=1.5.

n=1:1.5*(1+1/4)=1.5*(5/4)= (1.5*5)/4=7.5/4=1.875.

n=2:1.875*(1 +1/16) =1.875*(17/16) = (1.875 *17)/16.

Let me compute 1.875 *17: 1.875 *10=18.75; 1.875*7=13.125. So 18.75 +13.125=31.875. So 31.875 /16=1.9921875.

Wait, that's 1.9921875. So product up to n=2 is 1.9921875, which is very close to 2.

Wait, but wait, 1.9921875 is 1 and 0.9921875, which is 1.9921875. So that's approaching 2.

Wait, but if I multiply by (1 +1/65536) for n=3, then the product becomes 1.9921875 * (65537/65536) =1.9921875 * (1 + 1/65536) =1.9921875 +1.9921875 *0.000015258789 ≈1.9921875 + 0.00003033 ≈1.99221783.

Wait, that's not approaching 2; it's approaching 2 from below. Wait, but according to the formula, the product is 2. So perhaps the formula is applicable when each term is (1 + x^{2^k}) for k from 0 to infinity, and x is between -1 and 1. But wait, if I'm multiplying all those terms, each term is (1 + x^{2^k}) for k=0,1,2,..., then the product is 1/(1 -x).

Wait, but according to that formula, the product is 1/(1 -x). So for x=1/2, that would be 2.

But when I multiply terms step by step, each step seems to approach 2, but my earlier calculation for n=3 was 1.99221783, which is less than 2. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the product as the sum of 1/(1 -x) =1/(1 -1/2)=2. So the product of the terms (1 +x^{2^k}) for k from 0 to infinity is equal to 1/(1 -x). So for x=1/2, the product is 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B:2.0.

So, after all that, the correct answer is B:2.0.

The problem requires evaluating the infinite product:

$$
\prod_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{2^n}}\right)
$$

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   Each term in the product is of the form \(1 + \frac{1}{2^{2^n}}\), where \(n\) starts from 0 and increases to infinity.

2. **Recognize the Formula:**
   The infinite product \(\prod_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(1 + x^{2^n}\right)\) is known to equal \(\frac{1}{1 - x}\) for \(|x| < 1\).

3. **Apply the Formula:**
   Here, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). Substituting into the formula:

   $$
   \prod_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(1 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2^n}\right) = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2
   $$

4. **Conclusion:**
   Therefore, the value of the infinite product is 2.0.

**Answer:**

B) 2.0
