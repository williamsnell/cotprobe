Question:

 A typical roulette wheel used in a casino has 38 slots that are numbered $1,2,3, \ldots, 36,0,00$, respectively. The 0 and 00 slots are colored green. Half of the remaining slots are red and half are black. Also, half of the integers between 1 and 36 inclusive are odd, half are even, and 0 and 00 are defined to be neither odd nor even. A ball is rolled around the wheel and ends up in one of the slots; we assume that each slot has equal probability of $1 / 38$, and we are interested in the number of the slot into which the ball falls. Let $A=\{0,00\}$. Give the value of $P(A)$.

Options:

A: $\frac{1}{19}$
B: $\frac{1}{76}$
C: $\frac{20}{38}$
D: $\frac{2}{38}$
E: $\frac{3}{38}$
F: $\frac{4}{38}$
G: $\frac{36}{38}$
H: $\frac{1}{38}$
I: $\frac{1}{2}$
J: $\frac{18}{38}$

Okay, so I've got this probability question about a roulette wheel. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the probability that the ball lands in either the 0 or 00 slot, which is set as set A. The wheel has 38 slots numbered from 1 to 36, plus 0 and 00. Each slot is equally likely, so each has a probability of 1/38.

Wait, let me think. So the total number of slots is 38. The set A includes two slots: 0 and 00. So how many favorable outcomes are there? It's two: 0 and 00. So the probability should be the number of favorable divided by total. That's 2 divided by 38, which simplifies to 1/19. Wait, no, wait. Because 38 divided by 2 is 19. So 2/38 is the same as 1/19. So the probability is 1/19, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So each slot has an equal chance, so 1/38 each. So for set A, which has two slots, the probability is 2*(1/38), which is 2/38, which reduces to 1/19. So yes, that's correct. So the answer should be A: 1/19.

The roulette wheel has 38 slots, each with equal probability of 1/38. The set A includes the slots 0 and 00, totaling 2 favorable outcomes. Thus, the probability is 2/38, which simplifies to 1/19.

**Answer: A: \(\frac{1}{19}\)**
