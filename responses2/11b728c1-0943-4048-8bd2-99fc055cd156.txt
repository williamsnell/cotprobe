Okay, so I've got this finance problem here about compound interest. Hmm, let's see what it says. Mr. Smith wants to find out how much interest he'll get on $300 with a 3% annual compound interest rate over three years. The options are labeled from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, I remember that compound interest is calculated using the formula: A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after time t, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. But wait, since it's compounded annually, n would be 1. So the formula simplifies to A = P(1 + r)^t.

In this case, P is $300, r is 3% or 0.03, and t is 3 years. Let me plug these numbers in. So A = 300*(1 + 0.03)^3. Calculating the inside first, 1 + 0.03 is 1.03. Raising that to the 3rd power: 1.03^3. Let me think about that. 1.03 squared is 1.0609, multiply by 1.03 again: 1.0609 *1.03. Let's compute that. 1.0609 *1 is 1.0609, 1.0609 *0.03 is 0.031827. Adding them gives 1.092727. So 1.03^3 is approximately 1.092727.

Now, multiply that by 300: 300 * 1.092727. Hmm, 300*1 is 300, 300*0.09 is 27, 300*0.002727 is approximately 0.8181. So adding those up: 300 + 27 is 327, plus 0.8181 is about 327.8181. So A is approximately $327.82.

But wait, the question asks for the interest, not the total amount. So the interest earned would be A minus P. So that's 327.82 - 300 = 27.82 dollars. So looking at the options, option C is $27.82, which should be the correct answer.

Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 1.03^3 is indeed 1.092727. Multiply by 300: 300 *1.092727 = 327.8181, which is about $327.82. Subtracting the principal gives $27.82. That makes sense.

Alternatively, I could calculate it step by step for each year, using compound interest. Year 1: 300 *1.03 = 309. Year 2: 309 *1.03 = 309 + 9.27 = 318.27. Year 3: 318.27 *1.03. Let me calculate that. 318.27 *1.03: 318.27 *1 is 318.27, times 0.03 is 9.5481. Adding them gives 318.27 +9.5481= 327.8181, same as before. So that's $327.82 total, so interest is $27.82. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is C.

The correct answer is C: $27.82.
