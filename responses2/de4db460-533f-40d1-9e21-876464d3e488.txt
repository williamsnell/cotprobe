Okay, so I've got this question about the inheritance pattern of malignant hyperthermia, also known as hyperpyrexia. I'm a bit rusty on genetics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that hyperthermia is when a person gets too hot, which can lead to various issues, including cancer. I think the cause is related to a specific kind of mutation. But wait, what exactly causes it?

I recall that autosomal recessive diseases are common, like cystic fibrosis. But that's recessive, so the affected person must have two copies of a defective gene. Malignant hyperthermia is different. I think it's not an autosomal recessive but maybe another type of inheritance.

Wait, what else could lead to it? Oh, right, it's a sex-linked trait. Oh, because the mutation is on a sex chromosome. So it must be either X-linked recessive or X-linked dominant or something else.

Now, X-linked recessive. Because the person is male, he has one X and one Y. If the mutation is on the X, and it's recessive, then both parents must pass the defective X to the child. So the child would have the disease, which can be cancerous.

Alternatively, if it's X-linked dominant, then the child would have the disease if he gets at least one defective X. But I think hyperthermia is more about recessive than dominant. Also, I remember that autosomal recessive is for females, but that's usually linked to genes like Huntington's or cystic fibrosis.

Wait, another thought: autosomal dominant is when only one copy of the gene is needed. But isn't hyperthermia more about recessive? Because with dominant, you'd show the trait in at least one parent if one has it, not necessarily both. But in cases where it's autosomal recessive, both parents must have the defective gene for the child to have the disorder.

So, putting it together, hyperthermia is caused by X-linked recessive inheritance. So the pattern is X-linked recessive.

Looking at the options, option E is X-linked recessive. So the correct answer should be E.

The pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia, or hyperpyrexia, is best described as X-linked recessive. This is because the mutation causing the disorder is located on the X chromosome, and the recessive nature means both parents must pass the defective allele to the child for the disorder to manifest. 

Answer: E
