Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the pressure of nitrogen gas using the van der Waals equation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the question says that nitrogen is heated to 500 K at constant volume. The volume is 1.000 m³. The gas enters at 300 K and 100 atm. The mass is 92.4 kg. They're giving me the van der Waals constants for nitrogen: a is 1.352 dm⁶ atm mol⁻² and b is 0.0387 dm³ mol⁻¹.

Wait, okay, so I need to find the pressure at 500 K. The van der Waals equation is (P + a(n/V)²)(V/n - b) = RT. Right, because it's a real gas, not ideal.

So, the variables I have are:

- V = 1.000 m³. Oh wait, but the units don't match SI units. I think I'll need to convert that to dm³, since the a value is in dm⁶ atm mol⁻² and b is in dm³ mol⁻¹. Because 1 m³ is 1000 dm³. So 1.000 m³ is 1000 dm³.

Mass m is 92.4 kg. Wait, I need to convert that to moles. Molar mass of nitrogen is 28 g/mol, which is 0.028 kg/mol. So 92.4 kg divided by 0.028 kg/mol equals... let me calculate. 92.4 / 0.028 = 3300 mol. Wait, 0.028 is 28e-3, so 92.4 / 0.028 = 92.4 / 28 *1000 → wait wait, 92.4 kg is 92400 grams. Wait 1 mole is 28 grams, so 92400 / 28 = 3300 mol. Yes, that's right.

R is the gas constant. I'll need to decide the units. Since a is in dm³·atm/(mol²), and R is usually 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but let's think about the units to make sure.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Find the number of moles, n. I did that, n = 3300 mol.

2. Calculate n/V, because in the van der Waals equation, there's a term a*(n/V)^2. So that's 3300/(1000) = 3.3 per dm³.

Wait, n/V is 3300 mol/(1.000 m³) → since 1 m³ is 1000 dm³, 3300 mol / 1000 dm³ = 3.3 mol/dm³. Yes.

3. Compute a*(n/V)^2. So a is 1.352 dm⁶·atm/mol². So 1.352 * (3.3)^2 = 1.352 * 10.89 ≈ 14.73 dm⁶·atm/mol².

Wait, wait, wait. The van der Waals equation is (P + a (n/V)^2) (V/n - b) = RT.

Wait, so I have to compute (V/n - b). V is 1.000 m³ = 1000 dm³. So V/n = 1000 / 3300 ≈ 0.303 dm³/mol.

Subtracting b (0.0387 dm³/mol) gives 0.303 - 0.0387 = 0.2643 dm³/mol.

Hmm, but wait, maybe better to keep some decimals.

So, V/n = 1000 / 3300 = 0.30303 dm³/mol.

So, V/n - b = 0.30303 -0.0387 = 0.26433 dm³/mol.

Then, RT: R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). But wait, volume is in dm³, which is liters (since 1 L = 0.001 m³, but wait, no, 1 m³ is 1000 L. So 1000 dm³ is 1000 L. Oh right, so R in L·atm/(mol·K) is 0.0821.

So, RT = 0.0821 * 500 K (since T is 500 K) = 41.05 L·atm/mol.

So, RT is 41.05, and V/n -b is 0.26433 dm³/mol = 0.26433 L/mol.

Wait, because 1 dm³ = 1 L. Oh, okay, so the term V/n -b is 0.26433 L/mol.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, V is in m³, which is 1000 dm³, so V is 1000 dm³. So V/n (dm³/mol) is 1000 / 3300 ≈ 0.30303 dm³/mol. So that term is ~0.30303 L/mol because each dm³ is 1 L. So in the second term, V/n -b is 0.30303 - 0.0387 = 0.26433 L/mol.

So, the van der Waals equation becomes:

(P + a[(n/V)^2]) * [V/n - b] = RT.

Wait, wait, no, the van der Waals equation is (P + a(n/V)^2) (V/n - b) = RT.

Wait no, let me check:

The van der Waals equation is (P + a(n/V)^2) (V/n - b) = RT. So, in this expression, each term is multiplied.

So, let me rearrange:

P = [RT / (V/n - b)] - a (n/V)^2.

Wait, no, wait, wait. Let me write the equation properly.

The equation is (P + a (n/V)^2 ) * (V/n - b) = RT.

So, to solve for P, I can write:

P = [RT / (V/n - b)] - a (n/V)^2.

Yes, that's how you isolate P.

So, first compute [RT/(V/n -b)] and then subtract a*(n/V)^2.

Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, RT is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 500 K = 41.05 L·atm/mol.

Next term: V/n = (1.000 m³) / (3300 mol) = 0.00030303 m³/mol → in dm³, it's 0.30303 dm³/mol. So V/n is 0.30303 dm³/mol. But wait, since 1 dm³ is 1 L, that's 0.30303 L/mol.

So, V/n -b = 0.30303 - 0.0387 = 0.26433 L/mol.

So [RT/(V/n -b)] = 41.05 L·atm/mol / 0.26433 L/mol = 41.05 / 0.26433 ≈ let's compute that.

Wait, 41.05 divided by 0.26433. Let me compute that.

0.26433 * 155 ≈ 41.05. Because 0.26433 * 155 = 0.26433 * 150 = 39.6495, plus 0.26433 *5=1.32165. 39.6495 +1.32165=40.971, which is close to 41.05. So 155 would give 40.971, which is a bit less than 41.05. So 155.01.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

41.05 / 0.26433 = ?

Let me compute 0.26433 * 155 = 40.97115.

Difference between 41.05 and 40.97115 is 0.07885.

How much more? 0.07885 / 0.26433 = approx 0.296.

So approximately 155.296 atm.

So [RT/(V/n -b)] ≈ 155.3 atm.

Now, the second term: a*(n/V)^2.

We already have n/V = 3.3 mol/dm³.

So, (3.3)^2 = 10.89 (mol²/dm⁶).

Multiply by a: 1.352 dm⁶·atm/mol² * 10.89 mol²/dm⁶ = let's compute.

1.352 *10.89 ≈ 14.728.

So a*(n/V)^2 ≈14.728 dm⁶·atm/mol² * (mol²/dm⁶) ) → units would cancel, leaving atm.

So now, P = [155.3 atm] - 14.728 atm ≈ 155.3 -14.728= 140.57 atm.

Hmm, so the pressure would be approximately 140.57 atm. Looking at the options, option A is 140 atm, which is very close. But wait, let me check if I made any calculation errors.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the numbers.

n = 92.4 kg / 0.028 kg/mol = 3300 mol. Correct.

n/V =3300 /1000 =3.3 mol/dm³. Correct.

a (n/V)^2 =1.352 * (3.3)^2 = 1.352 * 10.89= 14.728. Correct.

RT =0.0821 *500=41.05 L·atm/mol. Correct.

V/n -b = (1000 dm³)/3300 mol -0.0387 dm³/mol = 0.30303 -0.0387=0.26433 dm³/mol. Correct.

RT/(V/n -b) =41.05 /0.26433 ≈155.3. Correct.

So P=155.3 -14.728 =140.57 atm.

Looking at the options, option A is 140 atm. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but wait, I'm a little confused because sometimes van der Waals can give higher pressures? Or maybe because in the equation, the term (V/n -b) is positive, and the pressure is higher than the ideal gas pressure. Let's think: for nitrogen, ideal gas pressure would be P_ideal= (nRT)/V.

So, for ideal gas, P_ideal= (3300 mol * 0.0821 *500) /1000 = (3300 *41.05)/1000 = (135465)/1000=135.465 atm.

So in the van der Waals equation, the correction is subtracting a term (n/V)^2*a. Wait, but wait, in this case, the correction term is positive, so P is less than the ideal pressure. So the van der Waals pressure is less than 135 atm. But wait, wait, in our calculation, we got 140 atm, which is higher than the ideal gas value. That doesn't make sense. Because that's only when a is positive. Wait, wait, but in the van der Waals equation, the correction term is (P + a (n/V)^2)(V/n -b) = RT. So, if the correction term is making P higher, but in our calculation, the first term was RT/(V/n -b) which was around 155 atm, and then subtracting 14.7 atm, resulting in 140.5 atm.

Wait, but the ideal gas pressure is 135.465 atm. So this is higher, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, that can't be right. So I must have miscalculated.

Wait, let me reevaluate the calculation. Let me check all steps again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the order of the equation. Let's re-express the van der Waals equation.

The equation is (P + a (n/V)^2) (V/n - b) = RT.

So P + a (n/V)^2 = RT/(V/n -b)

So P = RT/(V/n -b) - a (n/V)^2.

So, yes, correct.

So, RT is 41.05 L·atm/mol.

V/n is 1000/3300 =0.30303 L/mol.

V/n -b is 0.30303 -0.0387=0.26433 L/mol.

RT/(V/n -b) =41.05 /0.26433 ≈155.3 atm.

a*(n/V)^2=1.352*(3.3)^2=1.352*10.89=14.728 atm.

So P=155.3 -14.728=140.57 atm.

But wait, the ideal gas pressure without considering a and b would be lower. Because the van der Waals equation corrects for the repulsive forces and the volume occupied by the molecules.

Wait, wait a minute, the value I got is higher than the ideal gas. That doesn't make sense. Because in reality, the real gas pressure would be lower than the ideal. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I inverted a and (n/V)^2. Let me double-check.

Wait, the van der Waals equation is (P + a(n/V)^2)(V/n - b) = RT.

So, solving for P gives: P = RT/(V/n -b) - a (n/V)^2.

So, correct. So the calculation seems right. So why is the pressure higher than the ideal gas? Because in real gases, the molecules have repulsive forces, so at higher pressures, the molecules don't pack as tightly as they would in an ideal gas. So maybe the correction is making the pressure higher. Wait, no, in the equation, the correction is adding a term which contributes to increasing the pressure. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the van der Waals equation, a is positive, so when you add a term, the pressure is higher. So if a is positive, the term a (n/V)^2 is positive, so P would be higher than the ideal case. But that can't be right because real gases have higher pressure than ideal?

Wait, no, wait. For example, in the case of CO2, the real gas pressure is higher than the ideal when the molecules have strong repulsion. Similarly, for nitrogen, which is a diatomic molecule, but with weaker van der Waals forces, perhaps the correction is less. Alternatively, perhaps I have the formula wrong.

Wait, let me think again. Let me recall: at high pressures, the van der Waals equation becomes less accurate because the volume is so large that the molecules' volumes and intermolecular forces are negligible. So, if the pressure is high enough, the correction term (which includes a and b) becomes less accurate.

But in this case, the pressure I calculated (140 atm) is higher than the ideal gas (135.465 atm). So why is that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (n/V)^2. Let me recompute that.

n is 3300 mol, V is 1000 dm³. So n/V =3.3 mol/dm³. So (n/V)^2 = 3.3^2 =10.89.

Then, a is 1.352 (dm⁶·atm/mol²), so a*(n/V)^2 is 1.352 *10.89 = 14.728. So that part is correct.

So then, RT/(V/n -b) is 41.05 /0.26433 ≈155.3.

So P =155.3 -14.728=140.57 atm.

But wait, this is higher than the ideal gas. That's impossible, because ideal gas is when the molecules don't have these forces. So the real gas pressure should be lower. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I confused the van der Waals equation. Let me look up the correct form. Oh wait, I can't do that now, but I'll think. Maybe I should recheck the unit conversion.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I forgot that a is in dm⁶·atm/mol², and the equation uses that. So the calculation is correct.

Hmm, so perhaps the initial assumption that the correction makes the pressure higher is correct. But then why is the ideal gas lower than the pressure? Because the real gas has a higher pressure. That's correct. So the answer is 140.57 atm, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, perhaps when the pressure is high enough, the van der Waals equation's terms start to overestimate the pressure. So perhaps in this case, the correction is making the pressure a bit too high. But that's not the case here. Because the pressure calculated is higher than the ideal value. So I think the calculation is correct.

Hmm. So I think I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back and recheck.

Wait, no. Let me think: perhaps when a is positive, the equation's first term is P + a (n/V)^2. So in the equation, that term is positive, so the pressure is higher. But in our calculation, that's correct. So perhaps the correct answer is P=140 atm, which is option A.

So in the options, A is 140 atm, which would be the correct answer.

\]

---

### **Step 2: Compute \(a \left(\frac{n}{V}\right)^2\):**
\[
\left(\frac{n}{V}\right)^2 = (3.3)^2 = 10.89 \, \text{mol}^2 / \text{dm}^6
\]
\[
a \left(\frac{n}{V}\right)^2 = 1.352 \, \text{dm}^6 \cdot \text{atm} / \text{mol}^2 \cdot 10.89 \, \text{mol}^2 / \text{dm}^6 = 14.728 \, \text{atm}
\]

---

### **Step 3: Compute \(\frac{V}{n} - b\):**
\[
\frac{V}{n} = \frac{1000 \, \text{dm}^3}{3300 \, \text{mol}} \approx 0.30303 \, \text{mol}^{-1}
\]
\[
\frac{V}{n} - b = 0.30303 \, \text{mol}^{-1} - 0.0387 \, \text{mol}^{-1} = 0.26433 \, \text{mol}^{-1}

\]
\[
\frac{RT}{\left(\frac{V}{n} - b\right)} = \frac{41.05 \, \text{L} \cdot \text{atm} / \text{mol}}{0.26433 \, \text{mol}^{-1}} \approx 155.3 \, \text{atm}
\]

---

### **Step 5: Compute \(P\):**
\[
P = 155.3 \, \text{atm} - 14.728 \, \text{atm} \approx 140.57 \, \text{atm}
\]

---

### **Final Answer:**
The pressure of the gas is approximately **140 atm**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
