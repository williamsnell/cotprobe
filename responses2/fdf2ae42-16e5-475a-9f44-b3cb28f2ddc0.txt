Okay, let's see. I have this multiple-choice question about the production possibilities frontier (PPF) when opportunity cost is constant. Hmm. I remember that the PPF is a curve that shows the maximum possible production levels of two goods an economy can achieve when deciding how to allocate its resources.

The question is about what happens when opportunity cost is constant across all production levels. Wait, opportunity cost is the value of what you give up to produce something else. So if opportunity cost is constant, that means the cost of producing one good in terms of the other is the same no matter how much of each you produce. 

I think when opportunity cost is constant, the PPF should be a straight line. Because if the cost to switch between producing two goods doesn't change, the trade-off is linear. Like, each additional unit of one good you produce requires the same amount of resources that could have been used to produce the other good. That makes the PPF a straight line. 

Wait, what are the options? Let's look. The options are A through J. Let me think about each option. Option C says a straight horizontal line. No, that would imply that producing more of one good doesn't allow more of the other, which doesn't fit. Option D is convex to the origin—wait, convexity in terms of the PPF's shape. Normally, the PPF is concave when there are increasing opportunity costs, but if opportunity cost is constant, the PPF would be linear, not curved. So that would be concave? Or not necessarily. Wait, a straight line is considered both a convex and concave shape in a certain way. No, I think a straight line is a special case where the curve is linear. 

Wait, another approach. The PPF is a straight line when production is possible at a constant opportunity cost. Because each good can be produced at a constant rate relative to the other. So the slope of the PPF is the opportunity cost. If the opportunity cost is constant, the slope remains the same everywhere, meaning it's a straight line. 

So looking at the options, what do they say? Option C is a straight horizontal line—probably not. Option D says convex to the origin—no, that's not right. Option E is a curved line—no, it's straight. Option F is vertical line—probably not. Option G is a straight diagonal line slope upward from left to right—yes, that fits. Option H is downward from right to left—no. Option I is downward from left to right—no. Option J is undefined, which doesn't apply here. 

Wait, wait, but I'm a bit confused. I thought that a straight line is both convex and concave, but in the context of the PPF, it's just a straight line. So the correct shape should be a straight line with a constant slope. So the answer should be option G: a straight diagonal line sloping upward from left to right. 

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the terminology. The PPF is normally concave when opportunity costs increase, making the curve bow inward. But when opportunity cost is constant, the curve is linear. So the PPF would be a straight line, so option G is correct.

The production possibilities frontier (PPF) is a curve that represents the maximum combinations of two goods an economy can produce with its resources. When opportunity cost is constant across all production levels, the PPF takes the form of a straight line. This is because the opportunity cost of producing one good in terms of the other remains constant, implying a linear trade-off between the two goods. 

Analyzing the options, the correct shape of the PPF when opportunity cost is constant is a straight diagonal line sloping upward from left to right. 

Answer: G
