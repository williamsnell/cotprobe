Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields. Hmm, let me take a deep breath and think through it. So, the setup is that there's a particle of charge -q₁ at the origin on an x-axis. Another particle, let's say the charge is -4q₁, is somewhere on the x-axis where the net electric field is zero at x=2.0 mm. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says the net electric field is zero at x=2.0 mm. Oh, right, because the first particle is at the origin. So, the second particle is at some point x = d, and we need to find d such that the electric field from both charges cancels out at x=2 mm.

Wait, no, actually, wait again. The problem states: "the net electric field is zero at x=2.0 mm on the axis." So, the point where the field is zero is at 2 mm. So, the two charges are on the x-axis, and the field must cancel at that point.

So, the first charge is at x=0, charge Q1 is -q1. The other charge is at x=d, which we're trying to find, charge Q2 is -4 q1. The net electric field at x=2 mm (2e-3 m, I think) is zero. So, E1 (from Q1) plus E2 (from Q2) equals zero.

Because the electric field vectors add vectorially, but since they're colinear, their directions will determine the sign. So, let's think about the directions. At x=2 mm, the field from Q1 (at 0) and Q2 (at d) must add to zero. 

Wait, but wait, the charges are both negative. So, their electric fields at a point would point towards them. Wait, no. Wait, the electric field direction depends on the charge. For a negative charge, the field points towards it. So, for Q1 at origin, the field at x=2 mm (right of origin) would point to the left. For Q2 at d, the field at x=2 mm would depend on whether d is to the left or right of 2 mm.

Wait, but the field at x=2 mm is zero, so the fields from both charges must be in opposite directions. So, one is to the left, the other to the right, or vice versa. Alternatively, both could be pointing in the same direction, but that would not sum to zero.

Wait, let me clarify. Let's think of Q1 at 0. The field at 2 mm (x=2) would be E1 = k * (-q1) / (2)^2 towards the left because the charge is negative. Similarly, Q2 is at d. So, the field at 2 mm due to Q2 is E2 = k*(-4q1)/( (2-d) )^2. Wait, but the direction of E2 depends on where d is. Because if d is less than 2, the point 2 mm is to the right of d, so the field from Q2 (which is negative) would point to the left. If d is greater than 2, then the point 2 mm is between Q1 and Q2. So, the field from Q2 would point to the right if d is larger than 2, but wait, no. Wait, let's think.

Wait, Q2 is at d. The field at 2 mm is from Q2. So, the direction of E2 is towards Q2. So, if d is less than 2 mm, then the point 2 mm is to the right of Q2, so the field from Q2 at 2 mm is to the right. Wait, no, because the field from a negative charge points toward the charge. So, if Q2 is at d < 2 mm, then E2 points to the right. If Q2 is at d > 2 mm, then E2 at 2 mm points to the left.

But wait, the problem is that the net electric field is zero at x=2 mm. So, the sum of E1 and E2 is zero.

Let me model this.

Assume Q1 is at x=0, Q2 is at x=d.

We want E1 + E2 = 0 at x=2 mm.

But wait, let's model the direction. 

For E1: it's pointing towards Q1, which is at 0. So, the direction is negative (since 2 mm is to the right of 0). So, E1 is negative direction.

E2: the field from Q2 at x=2mm. The charge is negative, so field points towards Q2. So, if d < 2 mm, then the point 2 mm is to the right of Q2, so E2 is to the right (positive direction). If d > 2, then the point 2 mm is between Q1 and Q2, so E2 would point to the left (negative direction).

Wait, but the sum of E1 and E2 must be zero. So, E1 = -E2 in magnitude, but direction-wise, they must be opposite.

Wait, but let's think about which direction each is. Suppose first that d is less than 2 mm. Then, E1 is to the left (negative), E2 is to the right (positive). Sum would be negative + positive, which could be zero if the magnitudes are equal.

Alternatively, if d is greater than 2 mm, then E2 is to the left (negative), and E1 is to the left (negative). So, their sum would be more negative, so E1 + E2 can't be zero unless E1 is zero, which it isn't.

Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, if d is to the right of 2 mm, then E2 would point to the left. So E2 is negative. E1 is pointing to the left, so E1 is negative.

So, the sum would be E1 + E2 = (k q1/(d²)) * (-1) + (k 4 q1/(d-2)^2) * (-1) = 0?

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, the formula for E due to a point charge is E = (k * q ) / r², but the direction is important. So, for each charge, we can write the electric field vectors.

Let me define the coordinate system: x-axis, origin at charge Q1 (-q1). The point where E=0 is at x=2 mm. Q2 is at x=d.

So, E1 = k*Q1 / (r1²) * direction vector. Since Q1 is negative, the field at x=2 mm (r1=2 mm) points to the left. So, E1 is negative.

E2: Q2 is -4q1, so the field at x=2 mm points towards Q2. So, if d < 2 mm, then the point is to the right of Q2, so the field points to the right (positive direction). So, E2 is positive.

If d > 2 mm, then the point is to the left of Q2, so the field points to the left (negative direction).

So, the sum E1 + E2 =0.

Let me model both cases.

Case 1: d < 2 mm.

In this case, E1 is negative, E2 is positive.

So, E1 = - (k q1) / (2)^2 

E2 = (k * 4 q1) / ( (2 - d) )^2 

Set E1 + E2 = 0:

- (k q1)/(4) + (4 k q1) / ( (2 - d)^2 ) = 0.

Wait, let me make it equation-wise.

Setting E1 + E2 =0:

(k q1)/ ( (2)^2 ) * (-1) + (k * 4 q1)/( (2 - d)^2 ) * (+1) ) =0

Wait, no, because E1 is (k * (-q1)) / (2²), since the direction is left, so E1 = - (k q1) / (4).

Similarly, E2 is (k * (-4 q1)) / ( (2 - d)^2 ) * [because Q2 is at d, and field direction is towards Q2. So, if d <2, then E2 is to the right, so positive. So, E2 = (k * (-4 q1) ) / ( (2 -d)^2 ) * (1), since right is positive.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is E = k q / r², but the direction depends on the sign. So, for E2, which is due to Q2 (-4 q1), the field is E2 = (k * (-4 q1)) / ( (2 -d)^2 ) * sign.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to write each field with their signs.

So, E1 is pointing left, so E1 = - (k q1)/(2^2 )

E2 is pointing right, so E2 = (k * 4 q1 )/( (2 -d)^2 )

But wait, because Q2 is at d. For d <2, 2-d is positive, but since E2 is towards Q2, which is at d <2, the direction is right, so positive. So, E2 is positive.

So, equation: E1 + E2 = 0.

So,

- (k q1)/ (4 ) + (k *4 q1 ) / ( (2 - d)^2 ) ) = 0

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominator:

- k q1 + (16 k q1 ) / ( (2 - d)^2 ) = 0

Divide both sides by k q1 (since k≠0, q1≠0):

-1 + [16 / ( (2 -d)^2 ) ] =0

So,

16/( (2 -d)^2 ) =1

Multiply both sides by (2-d)^2:

16 = (2 -d)^2

Take square roots:

2 -d = ±4

So, 2 -d =4 → d =2 -4 = -2 mm

Or 2 -d = -4 → d = 2 +4 =6 mm

But in this case, we assumed d <2 mm. So, d =6 mm is not in this case. d=-2 mm is also negative, which is not on the x-axis as per our assumption (as it's not in the positive direction). So, case 1 gives no solution.

So, moving to case 2: d > 2 mm.

In this case, the point x=2 mm is to the left of Q2 (since Q2 is at d>2). So, the field from Q2 at x=2 mm is to the left, which is negative direction.

So, E1 is pointing to the left (negative), E2 is pointing to the left (negative). So, E1 = - (k q1)/(2^2 ), E2 = - (k *4 q1 )/( (d -2 )^2 )

So, their sum:

E1 + E2 = - (k q1)/(4 ) - (4 k q1 )/( (d-2)^2 ) =0

But wait, wait. Let's make the equation:

E1 + E2 = 0 → ( -k q1/(4) ) + ( -4 k q1/( (d-2)^2 ) ) = 0

Multiply both sides by (4 (d-2)^2 ):

- k q1 (d-2)^2 - 16 k q1 =0 → I think I should factor it differently.

Wait, no, perhaps better to add the terms.

[ - (q1 k )/4 ] - [4 q1 k / ( (d-2)^2 ) ] =0

Multiply both sides by -1:

(q1 k)/4 + 4 q1 k / ( (d-2)^2 ) )= 0

Factor out q1 k:

(q1 k ) [ 1/4 + 4/( (d-2)^2 ) ] =0

Since q1 is non-zero, and k is not zero, we have:

1/4 + 4/( (d-2)^2 ) = 0 → 1/4 = -4/( (d-2)^2 )

But 1/4 is positive, and the right side is negative. So, this is impossible. So, no solution in this case.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, I must have made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, let me think again. In case 2, where d>2, the point x=2 is to the left of Q2. So, the electric field from Q2 at 2 mm is towards Q2, which is at d>2. So, the direction is towards the right. Oh wait, no. Wait, Q2 is at d>2 mm. The point x=2 is to the left of Q2. So, the electric field points towards Q2, which is at a higher x. So, from Q2, the field at x=2 points right (positive direction).

So, E2 is positive.

E1 is also pointing to the left (negative direction), so E1 is negative.

So, the equation is:

E1 + E2 = 0 → ( -k q1 /4 ) + (k *4 q1 )/( (d-2 )^2 ) )=0

Multiply both sides by 4 (d-2)^2 to eliminate denominators:

- k q1 (d-2)^2 + 16 k q1 =0 → 

Factor out k q1:

k q1 [ - (d-2)^2 + 16 ] =0

Set the equation inside to zero:

- (d-2)^2 +16 =0 → (d-2)^2 =16 → d-2= ±4 → d= 2+4=6 mm, or d=2-4= -2 mm.

But in case 2, d>2, so d=6 mm is the possible solution.

So, the particle should be placed at x=6 mm, which is 6 mm from the origin, so the distance is 6 mm, so option B is 4 mm, no. Wait, the options are A:12, B:4, C:1, D:4. Wait, no.

Wait, the options are:

A:12.0 mm

B:4.0 mm

C:1.0 mm

D:14.0 mm

E:5.0 mm

F:6.0 mm

G:3.0 mm

H:8.0 mm

I:7.0 mm

J:10.0 mm

Wait, option F is 6.0 mm. So, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but wait a minute, the problem says the net electric field is zero at x=2.0 mm. But according to my calculation, the solution is x=6 mm. So, the charge should be placed at 6 mm from the origin. So, the correct answer is option F:6.0 mm.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the electric fields produced by the two charges at the origin and the point \( x = 2.0 \, \text{mm} \). The goal is to find the position \( d \) where the net electric field is zero. 

### Key Setup:
- Charge \( Q_1 = -q_1 \) is at the origin (\( x = 0 \)).
- Charge \( Q_2 = -4q_1 \) is at \( x = d \).
- The net electric field at \( x = 2.0 \, \text{mm} \) must be zero.

### Electric Field Contributions:
The electric field due to a point charge is given by:
\[
E = \frac{kq}{r^2}
\]
where \( k \) is Coulomb's constant, \( q \) is the charge, and \( r \) is the distance from the charge to the point of interest. The direction of the electric field depends on the sign of the charge and the position relative to the point of interest.

1. **At \( x = 2.0 \, \text{mm} \):**
   - The field from \( Q_1 \) (at \( x = 0 \)) points to the left (negative direction).
   - The field from \( Q_2 \) (at \( x = d \)) points to the right if \( d < 2.0 \, \text{mm} \) and to the left if \( d > 2.0 \, \text{mm} \).

### Case 1: \( d < 2.0 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( E_1 = -\frac{kq_1}{(2.0)^2} \) (points to the left).
- \( E_2 = \frac{k(-4q_1)}{(2.0 - d)^2} \) (points to the right if \( d < 2.0 \, \text{mm} \)).
- The net electric field is zero:
  \[
  E_1 + E_2 = 0 \implies -\frac{kq_1}{4} + \frac{4kq_1}{(2.0 - d)^2} = 0
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  \frac{4}{(2.0 - d)^2} = 1 \implies (2.0 - d)^2 = 4 \implies 2.0 - d = \pm 2
  \]
  This gives \( d = 6.0 \, \text{mm} \) or \( d = -2.0 \, \text{mm} \). Since \( d < 2.0 \, \text{mm} \), the valid solution is \( d = 6.0 \, \text{mm} \).

### Case 2: \( d > 2.0 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( E_1 = -\frac{kq_1}{(2.0)^2} \) (points to the left).
- \( E_2 = -\frac{k(-4q_1)}{(d - 2.0)^2} = \frac{4kq_1}{(d - 2.0)^2} \) (points to the left).
- The net electric field is zero:
  \[
  E_1 + E_2 = 0 \implies -\frac{kq_1}{4} - \frac{4kq_1}{(d - 2.0)^2} = 0
  \]
  This equation has no real solutions, as the left-hand side is always negative.

### Conclusion:
The only valid solution is \( d = 6.0 \, \text{mm} \), which corresponds to option **F**.
