Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the locations of university graduates at the time of independence. The sentence is: "At the time of independence, there were already hundreds of thousands of university graduates in ____, but hardly any at all in ____."

And the options are A through J, each giving different pairs of locations. I need to pick the correct pair.

First, I should think about when the country of independence was, which is India. So the context is during the Indian independence movement, which happened in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

I remember that during this time, a lot of people, especially the working class, were willing to leave their homes to go to study in other countries because they wanted better opportunities and more freedom. So the major destinations for educated people were either Australia or the Americas, but Australia was the most prominent.

Looking at the options, let's see which pairs include Australia. The options are A (India, Congo), B (India, Australia), C (Congo, Australia), D (Australia, Congo), E (South Korea, Congo), F (South Korea, India), G (Congo, South Korea), H (Congo, India), I (South Korea, Australia), J (India, South Korea).

So the possible pairs that have Australia are B, C, I. Let's analyze each.

Option B: India and Australia. Since the question is about when India was independent, probably referring to 1947. So, during India's independence, many Indian students went to Australia because it was more accessible and offered better opportunities compared to the US, which was still a British colony then.

Option C: Congo. Wait, the Congo was a country in the East, right? So in that context, the pair would be India and the Congo. But I'm not sure if that makes sense. The Congo was a separate region, maybe not as prominent as Australia.

Option I: South Korea. I'm not sure about the context of South Korea at the time of India's independence. I think South Korea was in fact in Asia, but when India was independent, South Korea was part of China, so it's not relevant here. Plus, the student movement in India might not have been as prominent there.

So between B and C. Let me think more. The major destination for Indian students during India's independence was Australia, not the Congo. Also, the Congo was more associated with issues like the liberation movement or other conflicts, but not as the primary destination.

So the correct pair is India and Australia. That would be option B.

The correct answer is B: India and Australia. During the time of India's independence, a significant number of Indian university graduates settled in Australia, seeking better opportunities and freedom. The other options either involve irrelevant locations or do not reflect the primary destinations during that period.

Answer: B
