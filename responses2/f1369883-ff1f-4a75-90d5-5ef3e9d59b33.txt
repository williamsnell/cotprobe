Question:

5.5-9. Suppose that the length of life in hours (say, $X$ ) of a light bulb manufactured by company $A$ is $N(800,14400)$ and the length of life in hours (say, $Y$ ) of a light bulb manufactured by company $B$ is $N(850,2500)$. One bulb is randomly selected from each company and is burned until "death."
(a) Find the probability that the length of life of the bulb from company $A$ exceeds the length of life of the bulb from company $B$ by at least 15 hours.


Options:

A: $0.3498$
B: $0.1256$
C: $0.2187$
D:  $0.3085$
E: $0.3654$
F: $0.4112$
G: $0.5000$
H: $0.4256$
I: $0.2753$
J: $0.1587$

Okay, I need to solve this probability problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that the life of a bulb from company A is normally distributed with a mean of 800 hours and a variance of 14400. So, I should write that as X ~ N(800, 14400). Then, company B's bulbs have a mean of 850 hours and a variance of 2500, so Y ~ N(850, 2500). We're supposed to find the probability that a bulb from A exceeds that of B by at least 15 hours.

Hmm, so essentially, we want P(X - Y >= 15). Right, because X is from A and Y is from B. Since both are normally distributed, their difference should also be normal.

First, let's find the distribution of X - Y. The mean of X - Y would be the difference of the means. So, 800 - 850 = -50. The variance of X - Y is the sum of the variances because the variables are independent, right? So, 14400 + 2500 = 16900. So, the standard deviation is sqrt(16900) = 130.

So, X - Y ~ N(-50, 130^2). Now, we need to find P(X - Y >= 15). That translates to P(X - Y >=15) = P(Z >= (15 - (-50))/130) where Z is the standard normal variable.

Calculating the z-score: (15 +50)/130 = 65/130 = 0.5. So, we need P(Z >= 0.5). 

Looking up 0.5 in the standard normal distribution table or using a calculator, the cumulative probability up to 0.5 is 0.6915. So, the tail probability, which is 1 - 0.6915, is 0.3085.

Wait, let me check that again. So, the z-score is (15 - (-50))/130 = 65/130 = 0.5. So, the area to the right of 0.5 is indeed 1 - 0.6915 = 0.3085. So, the probability is approximately 0.3085.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.3085. So, the answer should be D.

The probability that a bulb from company A exceeds that from B by at least 15 hours is found by:

1. The difference \( X - Y \) is normally distributed with mean \( -50 \) and variance \( 16900 \) (since variances add).
2. The z-score for 15 hours is \( (15 - (-50))/130 = 0.5 \).
3. The probability \( P(Z \geq 0.5) = 1 - 0.6915 = 0.3085 \).

The correct answer is \( 0.3085 \), which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
