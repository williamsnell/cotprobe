Okay, so I need to figure out the complementary color of blue. Hmm, I remember that complementary colors add a sense of contrast and movement. Let me think. 

I think in the color wheel, complementary colors are opposite each other. So blue is a pretty dark blue, right? So if I imagine the color wheel, blue is at the bottom. The colors opposite to it would be... wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact positions. Let me think of the colors in order. Red is at the top, then orange, yellow, green, blue at the bottom, then cyan, indigo, violet, and back to red.

Wait, so if blue is at the bottom, the color opposite to it would be cyan. Because in the color wheel, blue is opposite to cyan. So when you have complementary colors, you pair a color with another that's opposite. So blue and cyan. Oh yeah, that makes sense. Because blue is deep, and cyan is another deep color but on the opposite side.

Let me double-check. Another way to think about it is the color wheel has 16 primary colors (including their opposites). Blue is a primary color, and it's opposite is cyan. So yeah, the complementary color of blue is cyan.
