Okay, so I've got this question about effective interest rates. Let me think about how to approach it. The question is asking for the effective rate when the nominal rate is 18% compounded quarterly. The options are given from A to J, with various decimal numbers between 0 and 1. 

Hmm, I remember that the effective annual interest rate takes into account the compounding periods within a year. Since it's compounded quarterly, there are four compounding periods in a year. So, the formula must involve these four times.

Wait, the formula for effective rate (E) is E = (1 + (nominal rate / number of compounding periods)) ^ number of periods - 1. Right?

So the nominal rate here is 18%, which is 0.18 in decimal. The number of periods is 4 for quarterly compounding. Plugging these into the formula:

E = (1 + 0.18 / 4)^4 - 1.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 0.18 divided by 4 is 0.045. So, 1 + 0.045 is 1.045.

Now, I need to raise 1.045 to the power of 4. Let's see, 1.045^4. That's a bit tricky to compute without a calculator, but I can do it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can remember that each quarter adds 4.5%. But wait, compounding multiple times, so it's not just 4.5% once. Let me compute it properly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can break it down:

1.045^1 = 1.045.

1.045^2 = 1.045 * 1.045. Let me compute that. 1.045 * 1.045. 1 * 1 is 1, 1 * 0.045 is 0.045, 0.045 * 1 is 0.045, and 0.045 * 0.045 is 0.002025. So adding them up: 1 + 0.045 + 0.045 + 0.002025 = 1.092025.

So, 1.045 squared is approximately 1.092025.

Now, 1.045 cubed would be 1.092025 * 1.045.

Let me calculate that: 1 * 1.045 is 1.045, 0.092025 * 1.045. Hmm, perhaps a better way is to approximate. Alternatively, I can compute it as 1.092025 + 0.045 * 1.092025.

Wait, but that's a bit messy. Maybe I can just compute it step by step.

Wait, perhaps there's a better approach. Alternatively, I can use the formula correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 1.045^4 as (1.045^2) * (1.045^2). Since I already found 1.045 squared is 1.092025, then 1.092025 squared.

Wait, let me compute 1.092025 squared. Let me break it down:

1.092025 × 1.092025.

Let me compute 1 × 1.092025 = 1.092025.

0.09 × 1.092025 = 0.09828225.

0.002025 × 1.092025 ≈ 0.002025 * 1 = 0.002025, and 0.002025 * 0.092025 ≈ 0.000186. So adding together, 0.09828225 + 0.002025 + 0.000186 ≈ 0.100493.

So, adding that to the 1 from the first term, it's approximately 1.092025 + 0.100493 ≈ 1.192518.

Wait, that's 1.092025 squared, which is 1.092025 × 1.092025 ≈ 1.192518.

So, 1.045^4 ≈ 1.192518.

So, subtracting 1 gives E = 1.192518 - 1 = 0.192518, approximately 0.1925.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.1925, so that's the answer.

The effective annual interest rate (E) for a nominal rate of 18% compounded quarterly is calculated using the formula:

\[ E = \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^n - 1 \]

where:
- \( r = 0.18 \) (nominal rate),
- \( n = 4 \) (compounded quarterly).

Plugging in the values:

\[ E = \left(1 + \frac{0.18}{4}\right)^4 - 1 = (1 + 0.045)^4 - 1 = 1.045^4 - 1 \]

Calculating \( 1.045^4 \):
- \( 1.045^2 = 1.092025 \),
- \( (1.092025)^2 = 1.192518 \).

Thus, \( E = 1.192518 - 1 = 0.1925 \).

The effective rate is approximately 0.1925, which corresponds to option C.
