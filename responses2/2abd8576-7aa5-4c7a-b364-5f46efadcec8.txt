Question:

What is utility? What is marginal utility?

Options:

A: Utility is the measure of usefulness or pleasure. Marginal utility is the decrease in usefulness or pleasure as more units are consumed.
B: Utility is the quantity of a product. Marginal utility is the increase in quantity which a consumer gets from an additional unit of a specific good.
C: Utility is the power to satisfy a want. Marginal utility is the extra utility, or satisfaction, which a consumer derives from an additional unit of a specific good.
D: Utility is the duration of time a product can be used. Marginal utility is the increase in usage time with each additional unit consumed.
E: Utility is the measure of scarcity of a good. Marginal utility is the change in scarcity when one more unit of the good is produced.
F: Utility is the weight of a product. Marginal utility is the additional weight a consumer perceives when purchasing an extra unit of a specific good.
G: Utility is the power to make a good. Marginal utility is the extra power which a consumer derives from an additional unit of a specific good.
H: Utility is the total satisfaction received from consuming a certain amount of a good. Marginal utility is the satisfaction gained from the last unit consumed, holding the level of consumption constant.
I: Utility is the price of a good. Marginal utility is the increase in price which a consumer pays for an additional unit of a specific good.
J: Utility is the demand for a product. Marginal utility is the change in demand as the supply of a specific good increases.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about utility and marginal utility. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on economics, but I'll think it through.

First, what's utility? From what I remember, utility is a measure of the usefulness or pleasure a good or service gives. It's like how much a product satisfies a person's needs. So, if someone says a good gives a lot of utility, they're talking about how much satisfaction comes from consuming it.

Now, marginal utility is a bit trickier. It's the additional satisfaction or utility a person gets from consuming one more unit of a good. So, if someone has a certain amount of a good and then buys another, their marginal utility would be the extra they get from that extra unit. 

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A says: Utility is usefulness or pleasure. Marginal is decrease in that. Wait, no, marginal is the change from one unit to the next. So A's second part says marginal utility is a decrease, which doesn't make sense. Because usually, marginal utilities increase up to a point and then decrease due to satiety. So I don't think A is correct.

Option B: Utility is quantity, which doesn't make sense. Quantity is how much you have, not the satisfaction. So B is wrong.

Option C: Utility is power to satisfy wants. That's right, as per some theories, like the law of diminishing marginal utility. Marginal utility is the extra utility from each additional unit. So C seems on track.

Option D: Utility is duration. No, that's not right. It's about how much you use it, not how long it lasts.

Option E: Scarcity. Hmm, but utility is more about the satisfaction, not scarcity. So E seems incorrect.

Option F: Weight. No, utility doesn't relate to weight. So F is out.

Option G: Power to make a good. That's about the production aspect, not satisfaction. So G isn't correct.

Option H: Utility is total satisfaction. Yes, that's exactly the definition. Marginal utility is the satisfaction gained from the last unit. They mention holding the level of consumption constant, but that's part of how marginal is calculated, not the definition. So H is correct.

Option I: Price of a good. No, utility isn't about price. So I's incorrect.

Option J: Demand as supply increases. Wait, demand is a different concept. It's about how much people are willing to buy. Marginal utility is more about the additional satisfaction gained. So J is incorrect.

So now, looking at the options, options C and H are the ones that fit. Let me check the question again. It's asking which options correctly define utility and marginal utility.

Looking back, H says: Utility is the total satisfaction (which is correct). Marginal utility is the satisfaction from the last unit, holding consumption constant. So that's accurate because marginal utility is about the change from one unit to another.

Wait, but H's wording is a bit confusing. The option says, "Marginal utility is the increase in utility, or satisfaction, which a consumer derives from an additional unit of a specific good." But that's not quite right because marginal utility is the change from the previous unit. So the wording in H might be slightly off. But the definition is correct.

Alternatively, option C says: "Utility is the power to satisfy a want." That's correct. Marginal is the extra utility from each unit. So C is more accurate.

Wait, but the question is about the definitions. So option H is correct in terms of the concept, but perhaps the wording is a bit off. Option C is a correct definition, but H's wording isn't as precise. I think the correct answer would be C and H, but in the options, each is a separate choice.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the options. The question has options A to J, each a separate statement. So each option is a pair of statements, and the correct answer picks the pair where both statements are correct.

So:

H's first part is correct. The second part says "the increase in utility, or satisfaction, which a consumer derives from an additional unit of a specific good." But that's not correct. Because marginal utility is the change from the previous unit, not the total. So the second part of H might be incorrect.

So which option is the correct pair: C and H?

Option C: Correct. It correctly defines utility and marginal.

Option H: It defines utility correctly, but the second part is wrong. So H is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option C. Because H is not entirely accurate in its wording. So the right pair is C and H? Or is it that option C is the correct definition, and H is correct but the wording is slightly off?

Wait, the question says "what is utility? What is marginal utility?" So each option is a pair. So for each option, I need to see if both statements are correct.

Looking again:

Option C: Both correct.

Option H: Both correct. Because C's second statement is correct, and H's second statement is not.

Wait, because H's second statement is "the increase in utility, or satisfaction, which a consumer derives from an additional unit of a specific good." That's not correct because marginal utility is the change from the previous unit, not the total. So H's second part is wrong. So only option C is correct.

Wait, but wait again. Let me check each option:

A: Incorrect on the second part.

B: Incorrect.

C: Correct.

D: Incorrect.

E: Incorrect.

F: Incorrect.

G: Incorrect.

H: Correct definition of utility, but the part about marginal is incorrect. So H is correct, but the second part is wrong.

I: Incorrect.

J: Incorrect.

So the correct options are C and H, but H's second part is wrong. So the pair is only C and H, but since H's second part is incorrect, the correct answer is only C.

Wait, but the question is asking for the definitions. So, for the given pair, only option C is correct. H is correct about utility but the second part is wrong.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice with options A-J, each being a possible pair. So the correct answer is C, but H's second part is incorrect. So C is correct, and the pair is C.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.

Wait, no, option H says "the increase in utility, or satisfaction, which a consumer derives from an additional unit of a specific good." That's not the definition of marginal utility. Because marginal is the change from one unit to another. So H's second part is incorrect. Thus, H is incorrect.

Therefore, only option C is correct.

Wait, but the options are as given, and the question is which option correctly states the definitions. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but another possibility. Let me check each option again.

Wait, let's consider each option:

- Option C: Both definitions correct.

- Option H: Both definitions correct, but the second part is incorrect.

So, the correct pair is C, but H is incorrect because of the wording.

Wait, but the question is giving four options: the correct answer is option C because it's the only pair that correctly defines both terms.

Wait, but looking back, the options are A to J, each a separate option, each with two statements. So each option is a pair. So for the question, each option is a possible correct pair. So which option lists both correct statements?

So the correct pair is option C. Because H is correct, but the second part is wrong. Wait, no. H's second part is about marginal utility being the increase, which is not correct. So H is incorrect.

So the only correct option is C.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the definitions of utility and marginal utility across the given options.

1. **Utility**: It is defined as the measure of usefulness or pleasure a good or service provides. This aligns with both options C and H.

2. **Marginal Utility**: It refers to the additional satisfaction or utility gained from consuming one more unit of a good. This is the key difference between C and H.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option C**: Both statements are correct. It accurately defines utility as the measure of usefulness and marginal utility as the additional utility from each unit consumed.
  
- **Option H**: The first statement is correct, but the second part is incorrect. While it correctly defines utility, the wording "the increase in utility" is misleading, as marginal utility refers to the change from the previous unit, not the total increase.

### Conclusion:
- **Option C** is the correct pair because it provides both accurate definitions. Option H's second statement is incorrect, making it invalid.
