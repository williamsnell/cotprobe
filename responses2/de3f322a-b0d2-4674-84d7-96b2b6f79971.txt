Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Define language. List and define its elements.

Options:

A: Language is the visual representation of ideas through art. The elements include: lines, shapes, colors, and textures.
B: Language is the genetic transmission of information from parent to offspring. The elements include: genes, chromosomes, DNA, and mutations.
C: Language is the written form of communication using an alphabet. The elements include: letters, words, punctuation, and grammar.
D: Language is the complex arrangement of sounds that have accepted referents and can be arranged to derive meanings. The units of language include: phonemes, morphemes, syntax, and prosody.
E: Language is a tool for communication
F: Language is the process of transferring thoughts through telepathy. The elements include: sender, receiver, thought waves, and mental clarity.
G: Language is the combination of words to form sentences
H: Language is a system of gestures used exclusively by primates. The elements include: signals, movements, expressions, and gestures.
I: Language is the use of signs and symbols
J: Language is the method of communication using mathematical symbols and numbers. The elements include: numerals, equations, operations, and proofs.

Okay, so I have this multiple choice question about defining a language. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks me to list and define the elements of language, and then choose the correct option from A to J. Let me recall what I know about language structures.

First, I remember that language is a system of communication. It's used by people to express thoughts and ideas. So, looking at the options, I need to find which one accurately describes the elements involved.

Option C says language is the written form using an alphabet. That sounds right because I know that writing is one of the main ways people use language, and the alphabet is the basis. But wait, what about the other elements? Does it include things like letters, words, punctuation, and grammar? Oh, right, because the written form has letters, words are made up of letters, punctuation marks separate words, and grammar follows the rules to make sentences make sense. So option C includes all those elements.

Looking at option D, it says language is the complex arrangement of sounds. That's more accurate because sounds make up the basis of speech. But D also lists units like phonemes, morphemes, etc., which are parts of sounds. I'm not sure if the question is asking for all units or just the elements. The question says "List and define its elements." So perhaps D is more about the structure of sounds.

Option E says language is a tool for communication. That's a good point, but the question is about elements, not the role. So E might not be the best answer.

Option C seems to cover the elements: letters, words, punctuation, and grammar. So that's probably the correct choice.

Another thought: The other options don't seem as comprehensive. For example, option A talks about art and elements like lines, shapes, colors, textures. But language isn't about art, so A might not be right. Option B is about genetics, which is the origin of language, not the elements. Option F is telepathy, which is a communication method, not the elements of language. Option G is about sentences, but that's more about structure than the elements. Option H is about primates, which isn't the general case. Option J is about mathematical symbols, which is part of language but not the elements themselves. So C seems the only one that correctly identifies the elements.
