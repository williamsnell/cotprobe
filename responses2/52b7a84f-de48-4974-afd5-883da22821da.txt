Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the Box-Pierce Q and the Ljung-Box Q* statistics. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which statement is incorrect concerning their comparison in testing linear dependence in time series. The options are A to D.

First, I need to recall what each test does. Both Box-Pierce Q and Ljung-Box Q* are used to check for linear autocorrelation in a time series. They're similar, I think. The Box-Pierce Q is often used, and I remember that it's an alternative to the Ljung-Box test.

Wait, I think the Ljung-Box Q* statistic is another name for the Box-Pierce statistic. No, wait, maybe they are the same. Or are they slightly different? Oh wait, no, the Box-Pierce Q is a commonly used variant, so I think the Q* is just another name for the Box-Pierce test. So, the tests are actually the same, just named differently. Or maybe not, something's not right. Let me think again.

No, wait, I think Box-Pierce Q is a different name than Ljung-Box Q*. No, no, they are the same thing. So perhaps they're the same test. But wait, the options say the statements are incorrect. So maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, another thought: perhaps the Box-Pierce Q and Ljung-Box Q* are different versions. Or maybe they're the same. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the Box-Pierce Q is a different version than Ljung-Box Q*. Oh, right! I remember now. The Box-Pierce Q is an alternative name for the Ljung-Box Q*. Oh, no, no, wait. I'm getting this wrong. Let me get it straight.

The Ljung-Box Q* test is another name for the Box-Pierce test. So, I think the two are actually the same. But wait, no, I'm probably mixing it up. Let me think about their origins. The Ljung-Box Q was developed by Box and Jenkins, and the Box-Pierce is a modified version. Or perhaps they are the same.

Wait, I think that Box-Pierce Q and the Ljung-Box Q* are the same thing. But the options say they are two different tests (as per the question). So perhaps the confusion is that the original test was called the Box-Pierce, but some sources call it the Ljung-Box Q*. Alternatively, maybe Box-Pierce and Ljung-Box are two different test statistics, but the question's options are considering them as the same.

But wait, the question is about which statement is incorrect. So perhaps one of the statements is wrong.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: Asymptotically, the values of the two test statistics will be equal. If they're the same test, this statement is correct. So A is correct, not the incorrect one.

Option B: The Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q*. If they are the same, this is incorrect. So B would be the incorrect statement, but wait, the options are about which statement is incorrect. So if the two tests are the same, then B is wrong because they don't have better properties.

Option C: The Q test is sometimes over-sized for small samples. If they're the same test, then this would be incorrect. Because if they're the same, then the test would have the same properties, so C would be incorrect. But wait, if the Q and Q* are the same, then C would be incorrect.

Wait, but maybe the Q and Q* are different. Let me think again. Ah, perhaps the Box-Pierce Q is a modified version. Or perhaps they're two different tests.

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about their definitions. The Ljung-Box Q* test is a modification of the Box-Pierce Q test. So Box-Pierce Q is an older version, and Ljung-Box Q* is the newer version.

Wait, no, no. Wait, Box-Pierce Q is called the Box-Pierce test. Then, the Ljung-Box Q* is another test. Or perhaps I have it wrong. Let me try to recall. Oh, perhaps the Box-Pierce Q is the same as the Ljung-Box Q*. Maybe I'm mixing the terminology.

Alternatively, perhaps the Box-Pierce Q is a different test than the Ljung-Box. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the tests.

The Box-Pierce Q and the Ljung-Box Q* are often used interchangeably in some contexts, but perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps Box-Pierce Q is a different test. Wait, in any case, the answer options are about the incorrect statement.

Looking at the options again.

Option C: "The Q test is sometimes over-sized for small samples." So, if they're the same test, this statement is incorrect because they would have similar properties. So if they are the same, then the statement would be incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the Box-Pierce Q and the Ljung-Box Q* are different. Because if they are different, then statement C would be correct or incorrect. I need to clarify which one is which.

Wait, I think the Box-Pierce Q is an alternative name for the Ljung-Box Q*. So if that's the case, then they are the same test. So in that case, option C would be incorrect because both are the same. Because if they are the same, then the statement is saying that the Q test is sometimes over-sized, which would be wrong.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact terminology. Let me think again.

No, another approach: the Ljung-Box Q* is sometimes called the Box-Pierce Q*, but perhaps the Box-Pierce Q is another name for something else. Alternatively, the Box-Pierce Q is an alternative name for the Ljung-Box Q*, so I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that Box-Pierce Q and Ljung-Box Q* are the same test, but the way they're presented as different may be the key.

Alternatively, perhaps the Box-Pierce Q is a different test, and the Ljung-Box Q* is another. So, perhaps the Box-Pierce Q has better small sample properties. That would make option B correct, so the incorrect statement would be B or another option.

Wait, the question is which statement is incorrect.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: Asymptotically, the two test statistics are equal. If they are the same, this is correct. So A is correct.

Option B: The Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q*. If the test is the same, then this is incorrect.

Option C: The Q test is sometimes over-sized for small samples. If the test is the same, then this is incorrect.

Option D: As the sample size tends towards infinity, both will always reject the null. That's correct, because asymptotically they should both show significance.

So, the incorrect statement would be either B or C.

Wait, but if the two tests are the same, then option C is incorrect. Because if they have the same properties, then the statement that one is sometimes over-sized is incorrect.

But wait, the Box-Pierce Q and the Ljung-Box Q* are both used, but I think the Ljung-Box Q* is the same as Box-Pierce Q. So, option C would be incorrect if the test is the same.

So, the incorrect statement would be option C. Because if the two tests are the same, then the statement that one is over-sized in small samples is incorrect. Because both tests would have the same properties.

Alternatively, if the tests are different, then option C is correct, but that would mean that the two are different, so the answer would be option C is incorrect.

Wait, let me clarify. The Ljung-Box Q* is another name for Box-Pierce Q. So, when they are the same, option C is incorrect.

So, the incorrect statement is option C. Because if the two tests are the same, the statement that one is sometimes over-sized is false.

So, the incorrect statement is option C. Because they are the same test, so the statement about one being over-sized isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps Box-Pierce Q and Ljung-Box Q* are the same thing. So, if that's the case, then option C is incorrect. Because both tests would have the same properties, so the statement that one is sometimes over-sized is incorrect.

So, looking at the options, which is incorrect.

The options are:

A: asymptotically equal. Correct.

B: Q has better small sample. Incorrect if both are same.

C: Q is over-sized in small samples. Incorrect if same.

D: both tend to reject as sample size increases. Correct.

So, the incorrect statements are B and C. We have to choose which one is the incorrect statement.

Wait, the question is which statement is incorrect. The question asks which is incorrect, so choose which option is wrong.

So, which one is incorrect? The options are presented as four possible statements, and one is incorrect.

So, I'm to choose between B and C.

If the two tests are the same, then option C is incorrect. Because even though they have similar properties, one (Box-Pierce Q) is sometimes over-sized, which isn't true if they have the same properties.

So, the incorrect statement is option C.

Therefore, the answer is option C: The Q test is sometimes over-sized for small samples.

The question asks which statement is incorrect concerning the comparison of the Box-Pierce Q and the Ljung-Box Q* statistics. Both tests are used to assess linear autocorrelation in time series data, but they are often used interchangeably. The Ljung-Box Q* statistic is a modified version of the Box-Pierce Q statistic, but they are essentially the same test. Here's the analysis of each option:

1. **Option A**: "Asymptotically, the values of the two test statistics will be equal."  
   This is correct because both tests are asymptotically equivalent. Thus, this statement is valid.

2. **Option B**: "The Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q*."  
   If the tests are the same, this statement is incorrect because they do not have better properties in small samples. Thus, this statement is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: "The Q test is sometimes over-sized for small samples."  
   If the tests are the same, this statement is also incorrect because both tests do not have over-sized properties in small samples. Thus, this statement is incorrect.

4. **Option D**: "As the sample size tends towards infinity, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients."  
   This is correct because, asymptotically, both tests have similar properties and would both reject the null hypothesis. Thus, this statement is valid.

The question asks for the incorrect statement. Since both options B and C are incorrect, but the question implies only one incorrect answer, the most accurate choice is **Option C**, as the tests are the same, making the statement about over-sized properties in small samples false.
