Question:

One of the two most important uses of ammonia is as a reagent in the first step of theOsfwaldprocess, a synthetic route for the production of nitric acid. This first step proceeds according to the equation 4NH_3(g) + 50_2(g) \rightleftarrows 4N0(g) + 6H_20(g) . What is the expression for the equilibrium constant of this reaction?

Options:

A: K = {[NH_3]^4 [O_2]^5} / {[NO]^4 [H_2O]^6 }
B: K = {[O_2]^5} / { [NO]^4 [NH_3]^4 [H_2O]^6}
C: K = {[NO]^4 [H_2O]^6 } / { [NH_3]^4 [O_2]^5}
D: K = {[NO]^6 [H_2O]^4} / { [NH_3]^5 [O_2]^4}
E: K = {[NO]^4 [H_2O]^6 [NH_3]^4} / {[O_2]^5}
F: K = {[NH_3]^4 [O_2]^5 [H_2O]^6} / {[NO]^4}
G: K = {[NO]^4 [NH_3]^4} / { [H_2O]^6 [O_2]^5}
H: K = {[NH_3]^5 [O_2]^4} / { [NO]^6 [H_2O]^4}
I: K = {[NO]^4} / { [NH_3]^4 [O_2]^5}
J: K = {[NO]^4} / { [NH_3]^4 [H_2O]^6}

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about the equilibrium constant for the Osfwald process. Hmm, I remember that the Osfwald process is a method used to produce nitric acid, and it involves the synthesis of ammonia. Let me see... the reaction they give is 4NH3(g) + 5O2(g) ⇌ 4NO(g) + 6H2O(g). 

I need to find the correct expression for the equilibrium constant K. Equilibrium constants deal with the concentrations (or partial pressures, if it's a gas) of the products and reactants at equilibrium. The general formula is K = [products]^coefficients / [reactants]^coefficients.

So each reactant and product's concentration is raised to their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced equation. Let me write out the equation again:

4 NH3 (g) + 5 O2 (g) → 4 NO (g) + 6 H2O (g)

Wait, but they wrote the reaction as 4NH3 +5 O2 ⇌ 4NO +6 H2O. So the coefficients are 4,5,4,6 for NH3, O2, NO, H2O respectively.

So K should be the product of the concentrations of the products each raised to their coefficients divided by the same for the reactants. So products are NO and H2O, each to the 4th and 6th power. Reactants are NH3 and O2, each to the 4th and 5th power, respectively.

Wait, the equation is written as 4NH3 +5O2 → 4NO +6H2O. So yes, K would be ( [NO]^4 [H2O]^6 ) divided by ( [NH3]^4 [O2]^5 ).

Let me look at the options. Option C is K = [NO]^4 [H2O]^6 / [NH3]^4 [O2]^5. That's exactly what I'm thinking. So option C is the right answer.

But wait, let me double-check. Let me make sure I didn't mix the numerator and denominator. When writing the K expression, products are on top, reactants on the bottom. So yes, products are [NO]^4 and [H2O]^6, and reactants are [NH3]^4 and [O2]^5. So C is correct.

The equilibrium constant \( K \) for the reaction \( 4\text{NH}_3(g) + 5\text{O}_2(g) \rightleftarrows 4\text{NO}(g) + 6\text{H}_2\text{O}(g) \) is determined by raising the concentrations of the products to their stoichiometric coefficients and dividing by the concentrations of the reactants raised to their respective coefficients. 

The products are \(\text{NO}\) and \(\text{H}_2\text{O}\), with coefficients 4 and 6, respectively. The reactants are \(\text{NH}_3\) and \(\text{O}_2\), with coefficients 4 and 5, respectively. Thus, the equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{NO}]^4 [\text{H}_2\text{O}]^6}{[\text{NH}_3]^4 [\text{O}_2]^5}.
\]

Among the given options, this corresponds to option C: 

\[
K = \frac{[\text{NO}]^4 [\text{H}_2\text{O}]^6}{[\text{NH}_3]^4 [\text{O}_2]^5}.
\]
