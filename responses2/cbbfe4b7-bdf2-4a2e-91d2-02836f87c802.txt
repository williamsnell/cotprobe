Okay, I've got this chemistry question about absorption rates under different pressures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question is about how raising the total pressure affects the absorption rate of methane (CH4) in two different scenarios. The scenarios are about how the solvent (water) affects the absorption.

The first situation is when the methane is in an air-methane mixture with 15% CH4 by volume. They're using pure water as the solvent. They mentioned that the gas film is the main resistance to diffusion. So, the solvent (water) might be acting as a particle in the gas film, slowing down the diffusion.

The second situation is an air-CH4 mixture with 25% CH4, again using water as the solvent. The vapor pressure of methane is given as 0.17 atm. Wait, vapor pressure... in the context of solubility, I think it's related to Henry's law maybe. Because Henry's law says that the solubility of a gas in a solvent is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the solvent.

So, when the pressure is increased, the partial pressure of methane increases, leading to more solubility in the solvent. But wait, since the solvent is water, which is the medium, the solubility of CH4 in water would increase with higher pressure. So, the absorption rate would increase because more CH4 would dissolve.

Wait, but the question is about the effect on the absorption rate. So, when pressure is increased, what happens?

Let me think about each case.

First case: 15% CH4 in air. So the concentration of CH4 in the air is 15% by volume. When you open it up, the solubility of CH4 in water is governed by Henry's law. Henry's law says that the solubility is proportional to the partial pressure. So, the higher the pressure, the more CH4 will dissolve.

Wait, but the initial concentration of CH4 in the air is 15% by volume. Actually, when the gas is in contact with the solvent (water), the solubility is determined by the partial pressure. So, for an ideal gas, the solubility S is S = (P_total * C) / (P_total), which depends on total pressure. Alternatively, I think Henry's law is more applicable here: S = k * P, where k is Henry's constant.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's say the initial pressure is P. The concentration is 15% by volume, so the partial pressure of CH4 in the air is 0.15 * P_total. When the total pressure is raised to 3 atm, the partial pressure of CH4 increases to 0.15 * 3 = 0.45 atm. According to Henry's law, the solubility would be higher. But wait, in the first case, the initial concentration is 15% of the air. So, when you raise the pressure, the partial pressure of CH4 increases, so the solubility in the solvent increases.

So, the amount of CH4 that can dissolve in water would increase with higher pressure. So, the absorption rate (the amount that can be absorbed) increases.

Wait, but wait. The absorption rate is the amount transferred into the solvent. So, in the first case, when you increase the pressure, the solubility of CH4 in water increases, which would mean more CH4 is absorbed. So, the absorption rate would increase.

In the second case: 25% CH4 in air. So, when you raise the pressure to 3 atm, the partial pressure of CH4 becomes 0.25 * 3 = 0.75 atm. Again, according to Henry's law, the solubility increases. So, more CH4 is absorbed, hence absorption rate increases.

So, in both cases, increasing pressure would lead to higher absorption rates. So, the absorption rate would increase in both situations.

Wait, but what about the given answers. Looking at the options, option B says "Pressure change increases the absorption rate in both cases." So, that's what I'm thinking.

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait a second. The initial question says "the effect on the absorption rate due to raising the total pressure from 1 to 3 atm". So, if the initial pressure was 1 atm, and the total pressure is raised to 3 atm, then in each case, the partial pressure of CH4 increases.

But also, the solvent's influence. In the first case, the initial mixture is 15% CH4 in air. So, the initial concentration of CH4 in the air is 15% by volume. But wait, when you raise the pressure, the partial pressure of CH4 increases. So, for the same volume of air, a higher pressure would mean more CH4 is in the gas phase, leading to higher solubility.

Wait, but the question is about the effect of changing pressure on the absorption rate. So, in each scenario, what happens to the absorption.

Wait, another angle: When you change the pressure, the amount of gas (CH4) that can be absorbed depends on the solubility of CH4 in the solvent. So, if the solvent is water, and it's a gas (like CH4), the solubility would increase with higher pressure.

So, in both cases, increasing the pressure would increase the solubility, thus increasing the absorption rate.

Wait, but the question is about "the effect". So, the absorption rate would increase in both cases.

So, looking at the options, options B and F and others have different effects.

Wait, let me re-read the question. The first situation is 15% by volume, the second is 25%. So, whether each case's absorption increases.

So, in the first case, the initial concentration of CH4 in air is lower (15%) which means that the partial pressure is lower, but when the pressure is increased, the partial pressure increases more (so, same initial concentration implies lower partial pressure; when pressure goes up, partial pressure goes up more, so higher solubility).

In the second case, initial concentration is 25% (higher partial pressure), so when pressure is increased, the partial pressure is even higher (0.25 *3=0.75), leading to higher solubility.

So, in both cases, the absorption increases. So, the effect is that the absorption rate increases in both cases.

Looking at the options, option B says "Pressure change increases the absorption rate in both cases." So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let's think about how the initial concentration affects it. Because in some cases, the initial concentration may be lower, but the partial pressure increases more when pressure is raised, leading to higher solubility.

But the question is about the effect of raising the total pressure. So, for each scenario, increasing pressure causes the absorption rate to increase.

So, the answer should be option B.

To determine the effect of raising the total pressure on the absorption rate of methane (CH4) in the two scenarios, we analyze the situation using Henry's Law. Henry's Law states that the solubility of a gas in a solvent is proportional to its partial pressure. When the total pressure is increased, the partial pressure of CH4 increases, leading to higher solubility in the solvent (water), which in turn increases the absorption rate.

### Case 1: 15% CH4 by volume in air
- The initial concentration of CH4 in air is 15% by volume, corresponding to a lower partial pressure of CH4.
- When the total pressure is increased to 3 atm, the partial pressure of CH4 increases to 0.15 × 3 = 0.45 atm.
- According to Henry's Law, the solubility of CH4 in water increases with higher pressure, leading to higher absorption.

### Case 2: 25% CH4 by volume in air
- The initial concentration of CH4 in air is 25% by volume, corresponding to a higher partial pressure of CH4.
- When the total pressure is increased to 3 atm, the partial pressure of CH4 increases to 0.25 × 3 = 0.75 atm.
- Again, the solubility of CH4 in water increases with higher pressure, leading to higher absorption.

In both cases, increasing the total pressure results in higher absorption rates due to the increased solubility of CH4 in water. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Pressure change increases the absorption rate in both cases.**
