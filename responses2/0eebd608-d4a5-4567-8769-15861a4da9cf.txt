Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about ethics and athlete performance. Let me read it again.

The question says that two athletes, A and B, are equally skilled. But here's the twist: A naturally inherited certain traits from her father that made playing the sport easier for her, so she didn't have to train as hard as B. The question is about applying the " ethic of willfulness" to determine who is better.

Wait, what's the " ethic of willfulness"? Hmm, I think I remember a concept called willpower or maybe it's about the ethics of will. Oh wait, I think there's a concept called willfulness where people are evaluated based on how much they can willfully influence an outcome. Like, are you going to take initiative to do something, or do you let others have the upper hand.

So in this scenario, A didn't have to train as hard because she inherited traits that made her easier. That means she probably had more willpower or might have been more proactive in training. On the other hand, B probably had to train as hard as her, maybe because she didn't inherit those traits.

So, under the willfulness ethic, the person who can willfully overcome their limitations would be considered better. A didn't have to train, so she likely had more will and could have taken more initiative in training. That makes sense because she didn't have to give up as much. Therefore, A would be the better athlete.

Looking at the options:

A: A is a better athlete. That seems correct based on the reasoning.

B: B is better. Maybe not, because A didn't have to train as hard.

C: B doesn't count as an athlete. No, both are equally skilled, so C is wrong.

D: They are equally good. That's not necessarily true because A didn't have to train as hard, so her efforts were more effective.

So the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is A: A is a better athlete.
