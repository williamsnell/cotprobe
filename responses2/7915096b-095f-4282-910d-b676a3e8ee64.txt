Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the volume of a gas under certain conditions. Hmm. The given data is at 300 K and 20 atm. The compression factor is 0.86, and we're dealing with 8.2 mmol of gas. And the options are from A to J, all in cm³. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, let me remember what the compression factor is. Oh right, the compression factor Z is the ratio of the molar volume of the gas under the given conditions to the molar volume of an ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure. So Z = PV/(nRT). And the volume of the gas under the given conditions would be related to that.

Wait, another approach: The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But when Z is involved, the actual volume V is Z multiplied by the ideal volume. So in this case, the actual volume V = Z * (nRT/P). Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, the ideal volume would be V_ideal = nRT/P. Then the real volume V_real = Z * V_ideal. So V_real = Z * (nRT/P).

Alternatively, another formula I remember is PV = Zn RT. So maybe I can use that.

Let me get all the units straight. Temperature is given in K, which it is—300 K. Pressure is 20 atm. The amount is 8.2 mmol. Hmm, I should convert mmol to mol. Oh right, 1 mmol is 0.001 mol. So 8.2 mmol is 0.0082 mol.

I think the ideal gas law can be used. But wait, let me think about the steps.

So the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But here, we have the compression factor. So, the real volume of the gas is V = Z * (nRT)/(P) * (P/(P)) )? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I should write it as V = (Z n R T) / P.

Wait, let me think. The ideal volume would be nRT/P. So when Z is 1, it's the same as ideal gas law. But when Z is less than 1, the volume is smaller than ideal. So, the real volume is Z * (nRT/P). But since pressure is in atm and volume is in cm³, I need to make sure of the units.

Wait, let me outline the steps. First, calculate the ideal volume (if the gas were ideal), then multiply by Z to get the real volume. Alternatively, use the correct formula for the real volume with Z.

Wait, perhaps I should write the formula for real volume. The real volume V = (Z * n R T) / P. Right? Because PV = Z n R T → V = Z n R T / P.

Yes, that makes sense. So V = (Z * n * R * T) / P.

Let's plug in the values.

Given:
T = 300 K
P = 20 atm
n = 8.2 mmol = 0.0082 mol
Z = 0.86
R is the gas constant. I think the value of R when using atm, L, and K is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Oh wait, but wait. Because in the ideal gas law, the units must match. Let me check that.

Wait, let's make sure all units are correct.

n is in mol, R is in L·atm/(mol·K), T is K, P is atm, V would be in liters. But the question asks for cm³. So I'll have to convert liters to cm³ because 1 L = 1000 cm³.

So, let's proceed.

First, calculate the ideal volume (if Z=1). V_ideal = nRT/P = (0.0082 mol) * (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * 300 K / 20 atm.

Compute that:

0.0082 * 0.0821 = let me calculate that. 0.0082 * 0.0821 is approx 0.00067282. Then multiply by 300 K: 0.00067282 * 300 = 0.201846 L.

Divide by 20 atm: 0.201846 / 20 = 0.0100923 L. So 0.0100923 liters. That's 10.0923 cm³. 

But wait, the real volume is V = Z * V_ideal. So V = 0.86 * 10.0923 cm³.

Hmm. Let me compute that. 0.86 * 10.0923 ≈ let's see. 10 * 0.86 is 8.6, and 0.0923 * 0.86 is approximately 0.0796. So 8.6 + 0.0796 ≈ 8.6796 cm³. Wait, but that's 8.68 cm³, which is option G: 6.8? No, let me look at the options.

Wait, the options are from A to J. Let me list them again:

A:5.9, B:12.1, C:7.3, D:7.9, E:9.5, F:10.8, G:6.8, H:8.7, I:11.4, J:10.2.

Wait, I'm getting approximately 8.68 cm³. Hmm. But none of the options is exactly 8.68. The closest options are G (6.8) and H (8.7). Hmm. Could I have made a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the V_ideal part:

n = 0.0082 mol.

R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)

T = 300 K

P = 20 atm.

So V_ideal = (0.0082 * 0.0821 * 300) / 20.

Compute numerator: 0.0082 * 0.0821 = 0.00067262. Multiply by 300: 0.00067262 * 300 = 0.201786 L.

Divide by 20: 0.201786 / 20 = 0.0100893 L → 10.0893 cm³.

Z is 0.86, so V = 0.86 * 10.0893 = let's compute that.

0.86 * 10 = 8.6.

0.86 * 0.0893 ≈ 0.86 * 0.08 = 0.0688, plus 0.86 * 0.0093≈0.007998 → total about 0.0768.

So total V ≈ 8.6 + 0.0768 = 8.6768 cm³, which is approximately 8.68 cm³.

But looking at the options, the closest is option H:8.7 cm³. 

Wait, but none of the options are around 8.68. Let me recheck the calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of V_ideal.

Wait, 0.0082 * 0.0821. Let me compute this more accurately.

0.0082 * 0.0821:

0.008 * 0.08 = 0.00064, 0.008 * 0.0021 = 0.0000168.

0.0002 * 0.08 = 0.000016, 0.0002 * 0.0021 = 0.00000042.

Adding these up:

0.00064 + 0.0000168 = 0.0006568.

0.000016 + 0.00000042 = 0.00001642.

Total: 0.0006568 + 0.00001642 = 0.00067322.

So 0.00067322 multiplied by 300 is 0.201966 liters.

Divided by 20 atm gives 0.0100983 liters, which is 10.0983 cm³.

Then 0.86 * 10.0983 = let's compute.

10 * 0.86 is 8.6.

0.0983 * 0.86: let me compute 0.09 * 0.86 = 0.0774, 0.0083 * 0.86≈0.007138. So 0.0774 + 0.007138 ≈ 0.084538.

So total V ≈8.6 +0.084538=8.6845 cm³, approximately 8.68 cm³.

Looking at the options, the closest option is H:8.7 cm³, which is 8.7, but it's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait another thought: did I use the correct formula for V?

Wait, another approach: using Z = PV/(nRT). So V = Z*(PV)/(nRT) → Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of how the given Z affects the volume.

Wait, the ideal volume is V_ideal = nRT/P. Real volume is V = Z * V_ideal.

So V = Z * (nRT/P).

So again, the same calculation.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for R. Let me check R's value. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: compute V = (Z * n R T)/P.

So Z is 0.86. n is 0.0082 mol. R is 0.0821. T is 300. P is 20.

Compute numerator: 0.86 * 0.0082 * 0.0821 * 300.

Compute 0.86 * 0.0082 = 0.007012.

Multiply by 0.0821: 0.007012 * 0.0821 = 0.0005758.

Multiply by 300: 0.0005758 * 300 = 0.17274.

Divide by 20: 0.17274 / 20 = 0.008637 L. Wait, but that can't be right because 0.008637 L is 8.637 cm³. Oh wait, that's different from before. Wait, why is this discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo it.

Wait, let me compute (Z * n * R * T) / P.

Z =0.86.

n=0.0082 mol.

R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

T=300 K.

P=20 atm.

So:

numerator = 0.86 * 0.0082 * 0.0821 * 300.

Compute 0.86 * 0.0082 = 0.007012.

Multiply by 0.0821: 0.007012 * 0.0821 = 0.0005758 (I think that's correct).

Multiply by 300: 0.0005758 *300= 0.17274.

Divide by 20 atm: 0.17274 /20 = 0.008637 L.

Oh wait! So V = 0.008637 L, which is 8.637 cm³. But this is different from my previous calculation of 8.68 cm³. Hmm, where's the mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I made the formula wrong. Oh wait, I think I confused the formula in the initial calculation. Let me recheck.

In the first approach, I used V = Z * (nRT/P). So that's correct.

In the second approach, I computed (Z * n R T) / P, which is the same as V. So 0.008637 L is 8.637 cm³. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, wait. Maybe I did the first approach incorrectly. Let me recompute the first method.

First method:

V_ideal = (nRT)/P = (0.0082 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) *300 K ) /20 atm.

Compute numerator: 0.0082 * 0.0821 = 0.00067262.

Multiply by 300: 0.00067262 * 300 = 0.201786 L.

Divide by 20: 0.201786 /20 = 0.0100893 L → 10.0893 cm³.

Then V = Z * V_ideal → 0.86 * 10.0893 = 8.6767 cm³.

Hmm, so why the difference when I used a different approach?

Ah! Oh wait, no. Because in the second approach, I have V = (Z * n R T) / P. But wait, that would be the same as V_ideal multiplied by Z. Wait, but in this case, n=0.0082, R=0.0821, T=300, P=20.

So V = (0.86 * 0.0082 * 0.0821 *300) / 20 → which is (0.86 * 0.00067262 *300 ) → 0.86 * 0.201786 = 0.17387 L → 173.87 cm³? No, wait, that can't be right.

Wait no, wait: 0.86 * 0.0082 = 0.007012.

Multiply 0.007012 by 0.0821 → 0.007012 * 0.0821 = 0.0005758.

Multiply by 300 → 0.0005758 * 300 = 0.17274.

Divide by 20 → 0.17274 /20 = 0.008637 L.

Which is 8.637 cm³, which matches my first method's approximate result.

But in the initial second approach, I thought I computed it as 0.86 times 10.0893 (which was 10.09 cm³), giving 8.676 cm³. That's because I think I had an error in the first step. Because 0.86 * 10.0893 is 8.676 cm³, but according to the correct formula, it's 8.637 cm³.

Wait, so perhaps the correct answer is about 8.64 cm³, which would match option H:8.7 cm³. But wait, why the difference in calculation steps?

Alternatively, perhaps I should switch the formula. Wait, perhaps I should have used V = (Z * P * V_real ) / (n R T ) → no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait another approach: Let me think of the formula for real volume.

V = (Z * P V_ideal) ) / (n R T) → no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of V = (Z * n R T) / P → which is the same as V_ideal * Z.

So that's correct.

So the correct volume is 8.64 cm³, which is closest to option H:8.7 cm³. So the answer should be H.

Wait, let me double-check all the calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Another approach: Using the formula V = (Z * P * V_ideal) / (n R T )

Wait, no, that's not right. Because V_ideal is (n R T)/P. So substituting that, V = Z * (n R T / P) → which is what I did with V = Z * V_ideal.

So the correct approach is V = Z * (n R T)/ P.

Wait, but I'm getting 8.64 cm³. But looking at the options, the closest is H:8.7 cm³.

But wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recompute the V.

V = (0.86 * 0.0082 * 0.0821 * 300 ) / 20.

Compute the numerator:

0.0082 * 0.0821 = 0.00067262.

Multiply by 300: 0.00067262 *300 = 0.201786.

Multiply by 0.86: 0.201786 *0.86 = let's compute.

0.2 * 0.86 = 0.172.

0.001786 * 0.86 → 0.001549.

So 0.172 + 0.001549 = 0.173549.

Divide by 20 → 0.173549 /20 = 0.00867745 L → 8.67745 cm³.

So approximately 8.68 cm³.

Looking back at the options, the closest is H:8.7 cm³.

Wait, but why is the previous calculation giving 8.64 cm³? Oh wait, the initial mistake perhaps was in the first calculation. Let me recompute the first approach:

V_ideal = (0.0082 * 0.0821 *300 ) /20.

Compute this:

0.0082 *300 = 2.46.

Multiply by 0.0821: 2.46 *0.0821 = let me compute 2 * 0.0821=0.1642, 0.46*0.0821=0.037786 → total 0.201986.

Divide by 20 → 0.201986 /20=0.0100993 L → 10.0993 cm³.

Multiply by Z=0.86 → 10.0993 *0.86 = let's compute.

10 *0.86=8.6.

0.0993 *0.86 = approximately 0.0854.

So total 8.6 +0.0854=8.6854 cm³.

So around 8.69 cm³.

So the options are:

H:8.7 cm³.

So the correct answer is H.

So why did I get a different answer earlier? Oh because I had a miscalculation in the first approach. So the correct answer is H:8.7 cm³.
