Okay, so I've got this question about marketing research and I need to pick the correct answer from options A to G. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that marketing research involves different types of studies, like surveys, interviews, focus groups, and observations. It's about understanding what customers want, preferences, and behaviors. So it's not just about collecting data but also analyzing it to make informed decisions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "Is the process of presenting a product to the market without any prior research." Hmm, that sounds like marketing communication or product placement, not research. Research usually involves analysis, not mere presentation. So A might not be right.

Option B: "Involves only understanding the structural characteristics of the industry without any other factors." Structural characteristics would relate to the market's structure, like customer segments, distribution channels, etc. But research is more than just structuring; it's about analyzing behavior and preferences. So B doesn't sound right.

Option C: "Is work undertaken to understand how to make specific marketing strategy decisions." This makes sense because it's about the process of figuring out what marketing strategy to use, based on research findings. It's more than just understanding the industry; it's about strategy, which requires analysis.

Option D: "Is only concerned with the social research ignoring market and opinion research." I remember that social research is more about the opinions of the public. Market research, on the other hand, looks at consumer behavior, preferences, etc. So D doesn't seem correct because it's neglecting market research, which is a key part of marketing research.

Option E: "Involves solely collecting data without any form of analysis." No, because research doesn't just stop at data collection. Analysis is part of the process to draw conclusions.

Option F: "Is the process of deciding the marketing strategy without considering any external data." That sounds like it's making a decision without any additional info, which is more like trial and error or intuition. Marketing research is about using data to inform strategy, so F doesn't fit.

Option G: "Is only concerned with the opinion research ignoring market and social research." G is similar to D, but it's slightly different. It says it ignores both market and social research, which are important parts of marketing. So G is not correct either.

Wait, let me double-check. Marketing research encompasses both qualitative and quantitative methods. It's not just about social research (which is more about public opinion) or market research (which looks at consumer behavior). So the correct answer should be C because it's about understanding how to make marketing decisions based on research, which includes both qualitative and quantitative approaches. It's not just about industry structure, though; it's about the strategy, which requires analysis. So option C fits.

The correct answer is C.
