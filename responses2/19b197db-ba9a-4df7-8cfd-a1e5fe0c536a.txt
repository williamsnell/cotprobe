Alright, so I've got this statistics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding a lower bound for the probability that Y divided by n minus 0.25 is between -0.05 and 0.05. Y follows a binomial distribution with parameters n and 0.25, and n is 500. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that when dealing with binomial distributions, especially when n is large, we can approximate it with a normal distribution. That's because the Central Limit Theorem tells us that the binomial distribution tends toward a normal distribution as n increases. So, since n is 500, which is quite large, using a normal approximation should be valid here.

The expression we're dealing with is P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05). Let me break that down. Y is a binomial variable, so E(Y) is n*p, which would be 500 * 0.25 = 125. The variance of Y is n*p*(1-p), which is 500 * 0.25 * 0.75 = 93.75. So the standard deviation is sqrt(93.75), which is about 9.68.

Now, Y/n is the sample proportion. The expected value of Y/n is p, which is 0.25. The standard deviation of Y/n would be sqrt(p*(1-p)/n), so sqrt(0.25*0.75/500) = sqrt(0.1875/500) = sqrt(0.000375) ≈ 0.01936.

So, Y/n is approximately normally distributed with mean 0.25 and standard deviation approximately 0.01936. The question asks for P(|Y/n -0.25| <0.05). This is the probability that Y/n is within 0.05 of 0.25.

To find this, I can standardize the normal distribution. Let me compute the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds.

Lower bound: 0.25 - 0.05 = 0.20
Upper bound: 0.25 + 0.05 = 0.30

The z-score is calculated as (value - mean)/standard deviation.

For 0.20: (0.20 - 0.25)/0.01936 ≈ (-0.05)/0.01936 ≈ -2.582

For 0.30: (0.30 - 0.25)/0.01936 ≈ 0.05/0.01936 ≈ 2.582

So we're looking for the probability that Z is between -2.582 and 2.582. From the standard normal distribution table, I remember that about 98% of the distribution lies within 2.58 standard deviations, but let me check.

Wait, actually, the exact probability can be found using the standard normal CDF. The area between -2.58 and +2.58 is approximately 0.98, but I need to confirm.

Alternatively, since both tails are symmetric, each tail is (1 - 0.98)/2 = 0.01 each. So the probability within is 0.98.

Looking at the options, I see option E is 0.95, which is higher than 0.98? Wait no, 0.98 is even higher. Wait, 0.98 is the probability. But let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the z-score is about 2.58, which corresponds to a cumulative probability of about 0.995. But that's for the upper tail. So the area between -2.58 and +2.58 is 2*(0.995) - 1 = 0.99. Wait, no, that's if the tails are each 0.005. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let me think about the standard normal distribution. Z=2.58 corresponds to the 0.9901 cumulative probability (i.e., P(Z ≤ 2.58) ≈ 0.9901), so the area from -2.58 to 2.58 is 0.9901 - (1 - 0.9901) = 0.9901 - 0.0099 = 0.9802, approximately 0.98. So the probability is about 0.98.

But wait, the options don't have 0.98. Let me check the options again.

Options are from A to J:

A: 0.65

B: 0.60

C: 0.75

D: 0.95

E: 0.55

F: 0.85

G: 0.80

H: 0.90

I: 0.99

J: 0.70

Wait, so the closest is option I: 0.99 and F:0.85. Hmm, but I calculated about 0.98. So perhaps 0.95 is the closest lower bound. Alternatively, I might have miscalculated the z-value.

Wait, let me re-calculate the z-score correctly. 0.20 is 0.25 - 0.05, which is 0.20. (0.20 - 0.25)/0.01936 = (-0.05)/0.01936. Let me compute that more precisely.

0.05 / 0.01936. Let me calculate 0.05 ÷ 0.01936.

0.01936 times 2.58 is approximately 0.01936 * 2.5 = 0.0484, 0.01936 * 0.08 = 0.0015488. So 2.58 gives about 0.0484 + 0.0015488 = 0.0499488, which is about 0.05. So the exact z-score is approximately 2.58.

So the z-scores are indeed about ±2.58, which corresponds to about 98% confidence. But looking at the options, 0.95 is D, 0.98 is not an option. However, in the options, I see that option I is 0.99, which is higher than 0.98, and option F is 0.85, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the standard error calculation. Let me double-check the variance.

Variance of Y is n*p*(1-p) = 500 * 0.25 * 0.75 = 500 * 0.1875 = 93.75. So standard deviation is sqrt(93.75)≈9.68. So the standard error for Y/n is sqrt(93.75/500) = sqrt(0.1875)≈0.4330. Wait, wait a second! Wait, that's different from what I had before.

Wait, no. Wait, when we're dealing with Y/n, the variance is (n*p*(1-p))/n² = p*(1-p)/n. So variance is 0.25*0.75/500 = 0.1875/500 = 0.000375. So standard deviation is sqrt(0.000375)=0.01936. That's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought of the variance of Y/n as n*p*(1-p)/n², which is p*(1-p)/n. So yeah, 0.25*0.75/500 = same as before.

So that part is correct. So the standard error is 0.01936. So the z-scores are correct.

So the probability is about 0.98, which is 0.98. But the options don't have 0.98. The closest is option I:0.99, which is higher, and F:0.85, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps I should use the continuity correction. Since Y is a discrete variable, using the normal approximation for Y/n might be more accurate if we adjust for continuity. The continuity correction would involve adding and subtracting 0.5 in the numerator.

So, the original problem is P(|Y/n - 0.25| <0.05). That translates to Y/n being between 0.20 and 0.30.

Since Y is discrete, the exact probabilities are P(Y ≤ 0.20*500 -0.5) to P(Y ≥ 0.30*500 +0.5). Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, I'm trying to find P(Y/n >=0.20 and Y/n <=0.30). So, Y >= 0.20*500=100, and Y <= 0.30*500=150.

But when approximating Y with a normal distribution, we apply continuity correction. So for Y >=100, since Y is discrete, it's equivalent to Y >=100.5 in the normal approximation. Similarly, Y <=150 would become Y <=149.5.

So, we compute P(Y >= 100.5 and Y <= 149.5). So in terms of the normal variables:

Z1 = (100.5 -125)/(9.68) ≈ (-24.5)/9.68 ≈ -2.53

Z2 = (149.5 -125)/9.68 ≈24.5/9.68≈2.53

So the probability is between Z=-2.53 and Z=2.53.

Looking up the standard normal table, Z=2.53 corresponds to a cumulative probability of about 0.9943, and Z=-2.53 is 1 - 0.9943 = 0.0057. So the area between them is 0.9943 - 0.0057 = 0.9886, approximately 0.989. So that's about 0.99, which matches the earlier value.

So the lower bound for the probability is about 0.989, which is 0.99. But the options don't include 0.99 as the lower bound; the closest is H:0.90 and I:0.99.

Wait, but the question says "a lower bound" for the probability. That implies that the probability is at least this value. So our calculation gives approximately 0.989, so the lower bound would be the smallest possible probability. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the lower limit provided by the options, not the exact probability.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is asking for a lower bound for the probability. So the probability we calculated is approximately 0.989, which is just below 0.99. So the options given are 0.65, 0.60, etc., but the correct answer isn't among them. Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is using Chebyshev's inequality or another method to find a lower bound. Let me think.

Chebyshev's inequality says that P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k². But I'm not sure if that applies here directly. Alternatively, maybe we can use the Central Limit Theorem approximation to find a confidence interval.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the normal approximation to find the probability, and then look at the options to choose the closest lower bound. Since our approximation gives about 0.989, which is just below 0.99, the closest lower option is H:0.90. But that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a lower confidence level, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the question is about the confidence interval. Let me think again. Since we're approximating Y/n as normal, the 95% confidence interval would be roughly within 1.96 standard deviations. But that's about 0.95. Wait, but that's a confidence interval, which would correspond to a 95% probability.

Wait, but the question is about a lower bound for the probability, which is the same as the confidence level. So perhaps 0.95 is the correct answer, which is option D. But earlier I got 0.989, so why?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the z-score calculation. Let me recalculate using more precise numbers.

Wait, 0.20 is 0.25 - 0.05.

Y ~ Binomial(n=500, p=0.25). Mean is 125, standard deviation is sqrt(500*0.25*0.75)=sqrt(93.75)≈9.68246.

Standard error for Y/n is sqrt(93.75/500)=sqrt(0.1875)=0.43301270189.

Wait, but the standard error for Y/n is sqrt(p*(1-p)/n) = sqrt(0.25*0.75/500) = sqrt(0.1875/500)=sqrt(0.000375)=0.01936.

Wait, so the standard error is 0.01936.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when using Y/n, the standard error is sqrt(p*(1-p)/n). So in that case, the standard error is 0.01936. But when I use continuity correction, I get Z1=-2.53 and Z2=+2.53.

Looking up the standard normal distribution, the cumulative probability up to Z=2.53 is 0.9943, so the area between -2.53 and 2.53 is 0.9943*2 -1 = 0.9886, about 0.9886.

So about 0.9886, which is approximately 0.989.

Wait, so the probability is approximately 0.989, which is just below 0.99. The options don't have 0.99 as the exact value, but option I is 0.99, which is higher, and option F is 0.85.

Wait, but the question asks for a lower bound. So the probability is approximately 0.989, so the lower bound would be the minimum possible, but since all options are lower bounds, perhaps the question is using the normal approximation to find a lower bound, meaning we can state that the probability is at least 0.95 (option D). Alternatively, perhaps using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps we can calculate the exact probability using the binomial distribution, but that's computationally intensive for n=500. Alternatively, use the normal approximation with continuity correction.

Wait, the exact value might be around 0.989, so the lower bound is 0.95, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the confidence interval, and 95% is the confidence level, which would correspond to 0.95. So perhaps option D is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused because the options don't include 0.989. So perhaps I'll go with the closest option that is a lower bound. Since our approximation gives about 0.989, which is just below 0.99, and 0.95 is a lower bound, but perhaps the correct approach is to use the normal approximation and find the probability, and then pick the lower bound from the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the use of the normal approximation to find a confidence interval, which would give a lower bound at 0.95, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The standard error is 0.01936. The interval is 0.20 to 0.30. The width is 0.10. The standard error is 0.01936, so 0.10 is about 5.16 standard errors. But that's for the confidence interval, not for a probability.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the Central Limit Theorem to approximate the probability, and the answer is 0.95, which is option D.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The probability P is about 0.989. So 0.989 is the exact probability we're getting from normal approximation, but when we use the continuity correction, it's about 0.9886.

But none of the options are that high. The options given are:

A: 0.65

B: 0.60

C: 0.75

D: 0.95

E: 0.55

F: 0.85

G: 0.80

H: 0.90

I: 0.99

J: 0.70

So the closest is I:0.99, which is higher than our 0.989. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 0.95, but I'm not seeing why that would be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using another method, like the Poisson approximation, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the probability. Let me try using more precise z-scores.

Wait, with Z=2.53, the cumulative probability is 0.9943. So the probability between -2.53 and +2.53 is 0.9943 * 2 -1 = 0.9886, as I had before.

Wait, so the probability is approximately 0.9886, which is just below 0.99. So the lower bound would be 0.65, but that's way lower. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the lower bound of the confidence interval, which is 0.95 (option D).

Alternatively, perhaps using the normal approximation without continuity correction, we get a probability of about 0.98, which is still not present in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should instead use the formula for the probability using the binomial distribution.

The exact probability can be calculated with the formula:

P(Y = k) = C(n, k) p^k (1-p)^(n-k)

But for n=500, this would be time-consuming. Alternatively, use the normal approximation with continuity correction.

So, the exact probability is about 0.9886, so the lower bound would be 0.95 (option D), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the normal approximation to find the probability that the sample proportion is within a certain range, and then using that to find the confidence interval. In this case, the confidence interval would be approximately 95%, corresponding to option D.

Wait, but the question isn't asking about the confidence interval; it's asking for the probability.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps we can use Chebyshev's inequality. It states that for any random variable X and any k>0,

P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k²

In this case, X is Y/n, μ is 0.25, σ is sqrt(0.25*0.75)/sqrt(500) = 0.01936.

We're interested in P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k².

We can set k such that kσ = 0.05 (the half-width of our interval). So k = 0.05/0.01936 ≈2.58.

So Chebyshev's inequality gives P(|X - μ| ≥2.58σ) ≤ 1/(2.58)^2 ≈ 0.158.

So the probability that |X - 0.25| ≥0.05 is at most about 15.8%. So the probability that |X -0.25| is less than 0.05 is at least 1 - 0.158 = 0.842.

So the probability is at least approximately 0.842, which is just over 0.84. Looking at the options, the closest lower bound is F:0.85.

Wait, but the question is asking for a lower bound for the probability. So if the probability is at least 0.842, then 0.85 is the lower bound.

Hmm, that makes sense. So the answer would be F:0.85.

But earlier, the normal approximation gave about 0.9886, so 0.99. But since we're using Chebyshev's inequality, the lower bound is 0.842, which rounds up to 0.85.

So perhaps the correct answer is F:0.85.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the probability was about 0.9886, which is higher than 0.95. So perhaps using Chebyshev's inequality gives a lower bound of 0.85.

So that would suggest that the correct answer is F:0.85.

But I'm a bit confused because the question says "a lower bound", not necessarily the exact probability.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the normal approximation to find the probability, and then the answer is approximately 0.9886, so the lower bound is 0.65, 0.60, etc. But that doesn't make sense because 0.9886 is higher than those.

Wait, no. The question is about a lower bound for the probability. So perhaps the answer is the minimum possible probability, which is the lower bound given by the options. Since the normal approximation gives us about 0.9886, which is higher than 0.99, but option I is 0.99, which is higher than 0.9886. So the lower bound would be the smallest possible value, but since the options don't have 0.9886, perhaps the correct answer is F:0.85.

I think I'll go with F:0.85 as the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is **F: 0.85**. This is determined by using the Central Limit Theorem and Chebyshev's inequality to find a lower bound for the probability that the sample proportion falls within a specified range. 

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Problem Setup**: We need to find a lower bound for the probability \( P\left(\left|\frac{Y}{n} - p\right| < 0.05\right) \) when \( Y \) is binomially distributed with parameters \( n = 500 \) and \( p = 0.25 \).

2. **Mean and Standard Deviation**: 
   - Mean \( \mu = np = 500 \times 0.25 = 125 \).
   - Variance \( \sigma^2 = np(1-p) = 500 \times 0.25 \times 0.75 = 93.75 \).
   - Standard deviation \( \sigma = \sqrt{93.75} \approx 9.68 \).

3. **Sample Proportion**: The sample proportion \( \hat{p} = \frac{Y}{n} \) has:
   - Mean \( E[\hat{p}] = p = 0.25 \).
   - Standard error \( SE[\hat{p}] = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{9.68}{\sqrt{500}} \approx 0.01936 \).

4. **Interval of Interest**: We are interested in the interval \( 0.20 \leq \hat{p} \leq 0.30 \).

5. **Continuity Correction**: To improve accuracy, apply continuity correction:
   - Lower bound: \( 0.20 - 0.5/500 = 0.20 - 0.0001 = 0.1999 \).
   - Upper bound: \( 0.30 + 0.5/500 = 0.30 + 0.0001 = 0.3001 \).

6. **Z-Scores**: Convert to Z-scores:
   - \( Z_{\text{lower}} = \frac{0.1999 - 125}{0.01936} \approx \frac{-124.8001}{0.01936} \approx -6,500 \).
   - \( Z_{\text{upper}} = \frac{0.3001 - 125}{0.01936} \approx \frac{-124.7001}{0.01936} \approx -6,460 \).

7. **Cumulative Probabilities**: Using standard normal tables, find the probabilities:
   - \( P(Z \leq -6,500) \approx 0 \).
   - \( P(Z \leq -6,460) \approx 0 \).

8. **Probability Calculation**: The probability \( P(0.20 \leq \hat{p} \leq 0.30) \) is approximately \( 1 - 0 = 1 \).

9. **Chebyshev's Inequality**: To find a lower bound, apply Chebyshev's inequality:
   - \( P(|\hat{p} - 0.25| \geq 0.05) \leq \frac{1}{(0.05/0.01936)^2} \approx \frac{1}{(2.58)^2} \approx 0.158 \).
   - Thus, \( P(|\hat{p} - 0.25| < 0.05) \geq 1 - 0.158 = 0.842 \).

10. **Conclusion**: The probability is at least approximately 0.842, which rounds up to 0.85. Therefore, the lower bound is **F: 0.85**.

ANSWER: F
