Okay, so I've got this problem about electrons and light flashes. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I remember from my physics class that electrons exhibit wave-like behavior, especially when dealing with things like de Broglie wavelengths, but I'm not entirely sure how that applies here.

The question says that at position x0 = 1 unit, the wave function is +1. And in the interval Δx around x0, we observe 100 light flashes per minute. So, the wave function is giving the amplitude of the wave, I guess, and the flashes are related to intensity.

Wait, what's the relationship between the wave function and the number of flashes? Oh right, the intensity of a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude. So if the wave function is +1 at x0, the intensity there is proportional to 1², which is 1. But the observed flashes per minute are 100. So each unit of intensity corresponds to 100 flashes? Or is it 100 per unit intensity?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the wave's amplitude squared, which is the intensity. So if the wave function (amplitude) is +1, the intensity is 1. So the number of flashes per minute is directly proportional to the intensity. So 100 flashes per minute would mean 1 unit of intensity equals 100 flashes per minute. So each unit of intensity is 100 flashes/min.

Now the problem asks for the intensity at x=2, 3, and 4 units. So I need to find the wave function's amplitude squared at those positions and then multiply by 100 to get the number of flashes per minute.

Wait, but what's the wave function doing here? Oh, I think I remember that the wave function's square gives the intensity. So I need to find the value of the wave function at x=2, 3, 4, square it, multiply by 100 to get the number of flashes.

But wait, the question states the wave function at x0=1 is +1. So perhaps the wave function is a function of position, like a Gaussian or something that decreases away from x0. But how?

Wait, maybe the wave function is given as a Gaussian centered at x0=1 with a certain width. Because in electron diffraction, the intensity distribution is a Gaussian curve. So maybe the wave function's amplitude decreases as you move away from x0.

Wait, the problem says the wave function is +1 at x0=1. So perhaps the wave function is modeled as ψ(x) = A * e^(- (x - x0)^2 / (2 Δx²)), where A is the amplitude. But wait, the question says the value is +1 at x0=1, so perhaps ψ(1) = +1.

But wait, in the Gaussian distribution, the maximum amplitude is at the peak, which is x0. So if the wave function is ψ(x) = A e^{- (x - x0)^2 / (2 Δx^2)}, then ψ(1) = A = 1.

So the wave function's amplitude is 1 at x0=1. Then, as you move away from x0, the amplitude decreases. So at x=2, the amplitude would be less than 1, I think.

Wait, but what's the relation between the wave function squared and the intensity? Oh yes, the intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude. So the observed flashes per minute are proportional to [ψ(x)]^2.

So to find [ψ(x)]^2, I need to square the wave function at x=2, 3, 4 units.

But without knowing the exact function parameters, like the width (Δx) of the Gaussian, I can't compute the exact numbers. Wait, but the question gives the initial condition: at x0=1, ψ(x0)=+1. So that's the maximum amplitude, and the function decreases as you move away.

Hmm, but the problem doesn't provide enough information. Wait, looking back at the question, it says that in the interval Δx around x0 =1, 100 light flashes per minute are observed. So maybe the wave function is such that the area under the curve (integral) relates to the number of flashes. Wait, maybe the number of flashes is proportional to the integral of the intensity function over the interval. But if the interval is Δx, perhaps the integral is proportional to the number of flashes.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function's amplitude is the same as the number of flashes. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the initial condition is that the intensity is 100, which is proportional to [ψ(1)]². Since ψ(1)=1, [ψ(1)]²=1, so 100=1*k → k=100. So the number of flashes is [ψ(x)]² * 100.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the number of flashes per minute at position x is given by [ψ(x)]² multiplied by 100. So:

Flashes per minute at x = [ψ(x)]² * 100.

So, we need to compute [ψ(x)]^2 at x=2,3,4.

But wait, the problem just states that at x0=1, the wave function is +1. And we're to assume that the wave function is a Gaussian centered at x0=1, so ψ(x) = 1 * e^{- (x -1)^2 / (2 Δx²)}. But without knowing Δx, it's impossible to find exact values. Hmm, but perhaps in the problem, the wave function is moving in such a way that the intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from x0. So if at x0=1, the intensity is 100, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the problem says the wave function is +1 at x0=1. So perhaps the amplitude is 1, and the distribution is that the amplitude decreases as you move away.

Wait, perhaps the wave function's intensity is proportional to 1/(x^2 + something). But without knowing the specifics, I'm stuck. Alternatively, maybe the question implies that the wave function is a square of the position, but that's not relevant here.

Wait another thought: maybe the wave function is a Gaussian where ψ(x) = 1 at x0=1. The intensity is then [ψ(x)]^2. So at x=2, [ψ(2)]^2 would be less than 1, and at x=3, x=4, it's even smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is a function that forms a Gaussian, and the amplitude is 1 at x0=1. So for x=2, the amplitude would be less than 1. But without knowing the exact spread, I can't compute the actual values. Hmm, but the options don't involve numbers that don't fit a pattern. Wait, perhaps the wave function is a square of the position. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is a simple function where the intensity is 1 at x0=1, and decreases as the distance from 1 increases. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function's square is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from x0. So, [ψ(x)]^2 = k / (x - x0)^2. But that's not quite right, because the wave function is maximum at x0 and goes to zero as x moves away.

Wait, perhaps it's a Gaussian function, and the maximum is 1 at x0=1. The intensity at a distance Δx from x0 is then [ψ(x)]^2 = (1/Δx²) e^{-2 (Δx/(Δx))^2} }, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is such that [ψ(x)]² is (1/(x^2)) when x is near 1. Wait, but that's an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from x0. So, if the intensity is 100 at x0=1, then at x=2, the intensity is 100 * (1^2)/(2^2) = 100 * (1/4) = 25, which is 25 flashes per minute. But that doesn't match any of the options, so perhaps that's not the approach.

Wait, maybe the wave function's square is the same as the intensity. So if the intensity is [ψ(x)]^2, and it's 100 at x0=1, then at x=2, the intensity is [ψ(2)]^2. But without knowing ψ(2), I can't compute it.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is a simple function like ψ(x) = 1/(x - x0)^2. But that would make ψ(x) very large as x moves away, which doesn't make sense for a wave function.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is a simple square wave, but that seems unlikely in this context.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is a Gaussian function where ψ(x) = e^{- (x -1)^2/(2 a^2)}, where a is the standard deviation. Then the intensity is [e^{- (x -1)^2/(2 a^2)}]^2 = e^{-(x-1)^2/a²}.

But without knowing a, I can't compute this. Wait, but the problem says "the wave function has the value +1 unit at x0=1 units." So ψ(1)=1.

So perhaps ψ(x) = e^{-(x-1)^2/(2Δx²)}.

Then, [ψ(x)]^2 = e^{ - (x-1)^2 / Δx² }.

But I don't know Δx. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach. Let me think differently. Maybe the number of flashes is proportional to the square of the wave's amplitude, which is given as 1 at x0=1. So, at x0=1, the intensity is 100. Therefore, the intensity is [ψ(x)]^2 * 100. So, for any x, [ψ(x)]^2 = (intensity) / 100.

But we need to find the intensities at x=2,3,4.

Wait, but without knowing the wave function's form, I can't compute this. So perhaps the wave function is a Gaussian centered at x0=1, and the intensity at x=2 is 100 * (1/2)^2 = 25, but that's 25 flashes, which is option G. But looking at the options, option G is 200, 50, 25. Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe the wave function is a function where at x=1, the intensity is 100, which is [ψ(1)]^2 * 100 = 100. So [ψ(1)]^2 = 1. So ψ(1) = 1. So the wave function is decreasing as you move away from x0=1. So perhaps ψ(x) = 1/(x -1)^2, but that's not a Gaussian. Hmm, that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is a simple function where the intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from x0. So, for example, if the intensity is 100 at x0=1, then at x=2, the intensity is 100 * (1/2)^2 = 25, at x=3 it's 100*(1/3)^2≈11.1, and at x=4, 100*(1/4)^2=6.25. But none of these match the options given.

Wait, looking at the options, the only ones where the first number is 200, etc., are options A, D, E, etc. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the wave function is linear, but that doesn't make sense for a wave function. Or perhaps the wave function is a square of the position, but that doesn't make sense in this context.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The number of flashes is proportional to the square of the wave function. Since the wave function is +1 at x0=1, the intensity is 100. So another approach: perhaps the wave function is such that the intensity is 100 at x0=1, and as you move away, the intensity decreases. So, for each position x, the intensity is 100 times the square of the wave function at that point.

But without knowing the exact wave function, I can't proceed. So perhaps the wave function is a Gaussian with maximum intensity at x0=1. Then, the intensity at x=2 is (1/2)^2 * 100 = 25, at x=3, (1/3)^2 *100 ≈ 11.1, and at x=4, (1/4)^2 *100 =6.25. But none of the options match that.

Wait, looking at the options, the first option A says 200, 400, 800. That would suggest a factor of 2, 4, 8 times higher. If the intensity at x=1 is 100, then perhaps the wave function is 10 at x=1, so ψ(1)=10. Then, ψ(x) would be 10 at x=1 and perhaps 5 at x=2, 3.333 at x=3, etc. Then the intensity would be 10²*100=10,000? No, that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is 1, and the intensity is 100. So, the intensity is [ψ(x)]² * 100. So, if at x=1, the intensity is 100, which is [1]^2 *100 = 100, that's correct.

So for x=2,3,4, the intensity is [ψ(2)]² *100. But without knowing ψ(2), I can't compute it. So maybe the wave function is such that [ψ(x)]² is 100 multiplied by some factor depending on x.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is a Gaussian with a certain width. For example, at x=1, the intensity is 100. So at x=2, which is 1 unit away, the intensity would be 100 * (1/2)^2 = 25. Then, at x=3, 100*(1/3)^2=11.11, and x=4: 100*(1/4)^2=6.25. But none of the options match this.

Looking again at the options:

Option G: 200,50,25 → 200, 50,25

Option A: 200,400,800 → 200,400,800

Option D: 100, 200, 300 → 100, 200, 300

Wait, maybe the wave function is a square function, ψ(x) = x, but that would mean at x=1, ψ(1)=1. So the intensity is [1]^2 *100 =100. Then, at x=2, intensity is [2]^2 *100 =400. At x=3, [3]^2 *100=900, which is not an option. Similarly, x=4 is 1600. Hmm, but that doesn't match any of the given options except perhaps none, but looking at the options, option E has 500, etc. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is 1/(x-1)^2. So at x=1, it's 1/(0)^2, which is undefined, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is something like ψ(x) = (1/(x-1)^2) * e^{-something}. But without knowing, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is moving reciprocally. So, the intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the position from x0. So, for example, at x=1, intensity is 100. At x=2, it's 100*(1/2)^2=25. At x=3, 100*(1/3)^2≈11.1, but that doesn't make sense with the options.

Wait, maybe the wave function's intensity is proportional to the square of the position. So, at x=1, intensity is 100. At x=2, intensity is 400. At x=3, 900. But none of the options match these except perhaps option E, where at 2, it's 500; but that's not fitting.

Wait, perhaps the wave function's intensity at x is [100 * (x-1)^2], but that would make it zero at x=1, which isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is such that ψ(1)=1, and the intensity has a Gaussian distribution. So the intensity is a function of x where ψ(x) is decreasing as you move away from x0=1.

But without knowing the exact functional form, I can't compute the exact intensities. So perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the intensity at x=2 is 200, x=3 is 400, x=4 is 800, which is option A. But why?

Because if the intensity is proportional to the square of the distance from x0. So at x=2 (distance 1), intensity is 100 * (1)^2 =100 → but that's 100, not 200 as option A says.

Wait, perhaps the wave function's intensity is proportional to the square of the position. So, at x=1, intensity is 100. At x=2, intensity is 400. At x=3, 900. But the options don't have 900. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function's intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the position. So, at x=1, intensity is 100. At x=2, intensity is 100*(1/2)^2=25. At x=3, 100*(1/3)^2≈11.1. But none of these match the options.

Looking back at the options given:

A: 200,400,800

B: 100,100,100

C: Not given.

D: 100, 200,300

E: 500,1000,1500

F: 250, 500, 750

G:200,50,25

H: 100, 200, 300 → but that's option D.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the wave function's square is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from x0. So intensity I is proportional to (1/(x−x0)^2).

Wait, but that would mean I = k/(x−x0)^2. At x0=1, I=100. So 100 = k/(0^2). But 1/(0) is undefined, which can't be.

Wait, perhaps the wave function's square is inversely proportional to the distance from x0. So I = k/(x−x0). So, at x0=1, I=100 = k/(0). Again, undefined.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the problem another way. The problem says that we have a wave function that's 1 at x0=1, and the number of flashes is proportional to the intensity, which is the square of the wave function.

So, the number of flashes at position x is [ψ(x)]² * 100.

So, for x=2, ψ(2) is something. Let's assume that the wave function decreases as the distance from x0 increases. So, perhaps the wave function is 1 at x0=1, and then it decreases by 1/(x-1) each step.

Wait, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function's square is 1/(x-1)^2. So ψ(x) = 1/(x-1), and [ψ(x)]² = 1/(x-1)^2.

At x=2: [ψ(2)]^2 = 1/(2-1)^2 = 1 → intensity is 1 *100=100 → that's 100, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the wave function's square is 1/(x^2). So, ψ(x) =1/x.

At x=1, [ψ(1)]^2 = 1 → intensity 100.

At x=2, [ψ(2)]^2= (1/2)^2=1/4 → intensity 25.

At x=3, [ψ(3)]^2=1/9 → intensity ~11.1.

At x=4, 1/16 → ~6.25.

But the options don't have any of these except for G (200,50,25), which is 200,50,25. To get that, perhaps the intensity is 200, 50, 25, which would require the wave function's square to be 2, 5, 2.5, but it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the wave function's square is 200,50,25. So, [ψ(1)]^2=100, so ψ(1)=10.

At x=2, [ψ(2)]^2=200 → ψ(2)=√200=14.14.

At x=3, [ψ(3)]^2=50 → ψ(3)=√50≈7.07.

At x=4, [ψ(4)]^2=25 → ψ(4)=5.

But without knowing how ψ(x) behaves, I can't compute this.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is a simple function where ψ(x) = sqrt(k), and [ψ(x)]² = k. So, if at x=1, [ψ(1)]^2=100 → k=100.

At x=2, [ψ(2)]^2=100 → same, but that would imply that the wave function is 10 at x=2, which might not make sense if the function is a Gaussian.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function's square is 100*(x-1)^2. So, [ψ(x)]^2=100*(x-1)^2.

At x=1 → 100*(0)^2=0 → that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is a square of a linear function. So, ψ(x) = (x-1)^2. Then, [ψ(2)]^2=1^2=1 → intensity=100. [ψ(3)]^2=4 → intensity=400. [ψ(4)]^2=9→ intensity=900. But again, this doesn't match any of the given options.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the intensity is directly proportional to the square of the distance from x0, so I = k*(x−x0)^2. At x0=1, I=100 =k*(0)^2=0. That can't be, so perhaps the intensity is inversely proportional.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the number of flashes is proportional to the square of the wave function's value, which is 1 at x0=1. So, for each x, the intensity is [ψ(x)]^2 * 100.

But without knowing ψ(x), I can't compute it. So perhaps the function is such that [ψ(x)]^2 = 1/( (x-1) )^2.

So, [ψ(x)]^2 = 1/(x-1)^2 → [ψ(x)]² *100 = 100/(x-1)^2.

At x=2: 100/(1)^2 =100 → intensity 100.

At x=3: 100/(2)^2=25 → intensity 25.

At x=4: 100/(3)^2≈11.11 → intensity 11.11.

But the options don't have any of these except for option G, which is 200,50,25. So, perhaps the intensity is twice that, which would occur if [ψ(x)]^2 is 200,50,25, but that would require ψ(x) to be sqrt(200)≈14.14, sqrt(50)≈7.07, and sqrt(25)=5.

But without knowing how ψ(x) behaves, I can't confirm this.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the answer is option G, 200,50,25, but I can't see why.
</think>

The number of flashes is proportional to the square of the wave function's value. At x0=1, the wave function is 1, so the intensity is 100. For x=2,3,4, the intensity decreases as 25, 11.11, etc. However, none of the provided options match this pattern. Based on the given options, the closest is option G: 200,50,25. 

ANSWER: G
