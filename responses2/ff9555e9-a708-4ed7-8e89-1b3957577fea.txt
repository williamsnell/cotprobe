Okay, so I've got this problem here where McGuillPhoto wants to maximize their receipts from selling telescopic lenses. The function given is R(x) = 140x[1 - (x / 10,000)]. I remember that to maximize a function, especially one that's a product of variables, I should probably take its derivative and find where it equals zero. 

Wait, let me think about this. R(x) is the revenue function, right? So to find the maximum revenue, I need to find the critical points of R(x). Since R(x) is a function of x, which represents the number of lenses sold, I can take the derivative of R with respect to x and set it to zero to find the optimal x.

First, I should probably expand the function R(x) to make differentiation easier. Let's see, R(x) = 140x [1 - x/10000]. If I distribute that, it becomes 140x - (140x^2)/10000. Simplify that, which is 140x - 1.4x².

Now, taking the derivative of R(x) with respect to x. The derivative of 140x is 140, and the derivative of -1.4x² is -2.8x. So R'(x) = 140 - 2.8x.

To find the maximum, set R'(x) to zero: 140 - 2.8x = 0. Solving for x, I get 2.8x = 140. So x = 140 / 2.8. Let me calculate that. 140 divided by 2.8. Hmm, 2.8 times 50 is 140, because 2.8*50 = (2*50)+(0.8*50)=100+40=140. So x is 50.

Wait, that's only 50 lenses? That seems low. Let me check the calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake in the derivative.

Wait another moment, maybe I should have used a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for revenue maximization when the revenue function is a quadratic. Because R(x) = ax - bx², the maximum is at x = (a)/(2b). Let me check that.

Wait, looking back at R(x) = 140x - 1.4x², which is in the form R(x) = ax + bx²? Wait no, it's R(x) = 140x - 1.4x², so it's a quadratic function opening downward (since the coefficient of x² is negative). So the maximum is at x = a/(2b), where a is the coefficient of x and b is the coefficient of x². Wait, no, in the standard quadratic form ax² + bx + c, the maximum occurs at x = -b/(2a). But in this case, the equation is R(x) = -1.4x² +140x. So a = -1.4, b=140. So maximum at x = -140/(2*(-1.4)) = (-140)/(-2.8) = 50. So x is 50, that's 50 lenses. But wait, the answer options don't have 50. The options are 3500, 3000, 8000, etc.

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the function. Let me re-examine the problem. The function is R(x) = 140x[1 - (x/10,000)]. So that's 140x multiplied by (1 - x/10000). Alternatively, that's 140x - (140x²)/10000, which is 140x - 0.014x². So, R(x) = -0.014x² + 140x. So a is -0.014, b is 140. So maximum x is -b/(2a) = -140/(2*(-0.014)) = 140/(0.028) = 140 / 0.028.

Let me compute that. 0.028 is 28/1000, so 140 divided by (28/1000) is 140 * (1000/28) = (140 * 1000) / 28.

Simplify 140/28 is 5; 5 *1000 is 5000. So x is 5000. So 5000 lenses. Looking back at the options, J is 5000 lenses. So the answer should be option J.

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe I made a mistake because 50 seemed low. Let me check again. Wait, is there a mistake in the function setup? Maybe the problem is R(x) = 140x * (1 - x/10^4), which is 140x [1 - x/10000].

Wait, perhaps the function should be R(x) = 140x - (140x²)/10000, which is 140x - 0.014x². So yes, that's correct. So R(x) = -0.014x² +140x. The maximum is at x = -b/(2a) = -140/(2*(-0.014)) = 140/(0.028) = 5000. So yes, 5000 lenses, option J. But wait, the options don't have J as 5000? Wait, looking back, the options are labeled A through J. Option J says 5000 lenses. So yes, that's correct.

To determine the number of lenses that maximize receipts, we start with the revenue function:

\[ R(x) = 140x \left(1 - \frac{x}{10,000}\right) \]

Expanding this gives:

\[ R(x) = 140x - 0.014x^2 \]

This is a quadratic function in the form \( R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a = -0.014 \) and \( b = 140 \). The maximum value of a quadratic function occurs at:

\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ x = -\frac{140}{2(-0.014)} = \frac{140}{0.028} = 5000 \]

Thus, the number of lenses that maximizes receipts is 5000, which corresponds to option J.
