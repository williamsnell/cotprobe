Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the wavelength of radiation emitted by stars. Hmm, I remember from my studies that there's a relationship between frequency and wavelength of electromagnetic radiation. Oh right, it's the equation c = λν, where c is the speed of light, λ is the wavelength, and ν is the frequency. 

Wait, but wait. I think the units here matter. The question says to express the wavelength in centimeters. Right, because astronomers often use centimeters for radio waves, which are much smaller than meters. So the speed of light, c, needs to be in cm/s, not m/s. Oh, right, because 1 meter is 100 centimeters, so 3.0e8 meters per second is 3.0e10 cm/s.

The problem gives the frequency as 1.42 × 10^9 Hz. So ν is 1.42e9 Hz. Let me plug these into the formula. 

c = λν → λ = c / ν.

So I need to compute c divided by ν. Let me compute that. c is 3e10 cm/s, and ν is 1.42e9 Hz. 

So 3e10 divided by 1.42e9. Let me compute that. Let's see, 3e10 is 300,000,000,000 and 1.42e9 is 1,420,000,000. 

Dividing 300e9 by 1.42e9. The exponents are the same, so 300 / 1.42. Let me calculate 300 divided by 1.42. 

Hmm, 1.42 times 208 is about 300? Wait, 1.42 * 200 = 284, which is less than 300. 1.42 * 208 = 1.42*200 + 1.42*8 = 284 + 11.36 = 295.36. Close to 300. So maybe 208.6 or something. 

Wait, 300 /1.42 = approximately 208.6 cm^-1? No wait, wait, since I'm dividing cm/s by Hz. So the units would be cm/(s * Hz). But since Hz is 1/s, so it's cm/(s * 1/s) → cm. So that's correct.

So about 208.6 cm. Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are 0.021 cm, 0.0021, 0.21, 2.1, 42, etc. Wait, 208 is not in the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, wait. Oh wait, wait! Did I mess up the calculation? Because 3e10 / 1.42e9 is (3e10)/(1.42e9) = (3/1.42) * (1e10/1e9) = (2.118) * 10 = 21.18 cm. Oh wait! Because 1e10 / 1e9 is 10. So 3e10 divided by 1.42e9 is (3/1.42) * 10. Which is approximately 2.118 * 10 = 21.18 cm. So the wavelength is about 21.18 cm.

Looking back at the options, option G is 21 cm. That's the closest. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me think again. Because 1e10 is 10^10, and 1e9 is 10^9. So 1e10/1e9 is 10. So 3e10 / 1.42e9 = (3 /1.42) * (1e10/1e9) = (3/1.42) * 10. 3/1.42 is approximately 2.118, so 2.118 *10=21.18 cm. So yes, about 21 cm, so option G.

To determine the wavelength of the emitted radiation, we use the relationship between the speed of light, frequency, and wavelength: 

\[
c = \lambda \nu
\]

Rearranging for wavelength:

\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{\nu}
\]

### Given:
- Speed of light, \( c = 3.0 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \)
- Frequency, \( \nu = 1.42 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz} \)

### Calculation:
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{3.0 \times 10^{10}}{1.42 \times 10^9}
\]

Simplify the powers of 10:

\[
\lambda = \frac{3.0}{1.42} \times 10^{10-9} = \frac{3.0}{1.42} \times 10^1
\]

Calculate \( \frac{3.0}{1.42} \):

\[
\frac{3.0}{1.42} \approx 2.118
\]

Now multiply by \( 10^1 \):

\[
\lambda \approx 2.118 \times 10 = 21.18 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Comparison with Options:
The calculated wavelength, \( 21.18 \, \text{cm} \), is closest to option **G: 21 cm**.
