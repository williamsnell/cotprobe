Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Feinberg's work, right? I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking what Feinberg claims people typically desire when they're hungry. The options are A to J, each with different statements.

First, I remember Feinberg's "View of Feeding." From what I recall, Feinberg's theory suggests that when someone is hungry, they're looking for a way to satisfy their need without causing unnecessary discomfort. So, I think he probably talked about the positive and negative aspects of hunger.

Looking at the options: 

A: Neither a nor b. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because I think he's talking about both. So maybe A is incorrect because the options B and F are about eating and drinking, which are related.

B: To sleep. Wait, Feinberg's theory, especially in his book, doesn't seem to mention sleeping as a desire. I thought he focused more on the immediate needs of eating and the physical sensations of the food.

C: Pleasant gustatory sensations. That sounds right. I remember Feinberg discussing the importance of taste and smell in satisfying hunger. So when you're hungry, you want a pleasant taste or smell to feel full, which would satisfy the need.

D: To cook. No, he's probably saying that people don't want to cook when hungry because they want to eat immediately. Cooking is more of a delayed satisfaction, so that's not what he's pointing out.

E: To feel full. That's related to C, but maybe E is the more direct answer. Because the key point is the pleasure from the food, not necessarily the act of eating.

F: To eat food. Hmm, if you're hungry, you might want to eat to satisfy the need. But I think Feinberg's work might have more about the pleasure of the food than the act itself. Or maybe not. I'm a bit unsure here.

G: To drink water. No, that's more about hydration, not hunger.

H: To avoid food. I don't think so. Feinberg's theory suggests that people are satisfied when they can eat, so they avoid not-eating.

I: Both a and b. I'm not sure about this. Feinberg doesn't think people want to sleep when hungry, so B is incorrect.

J: To exercise. That's about physical activity, not hunger.

So, putting it together: the correct answer is C and E. Because C is about the pleasure from the food, and E is about feeling full, which is the immediate consequence of eating. But looking back, maybe the question is phrased as what they typically desire, so both aspects are part of the theory. But wait, the options are given as separate choices. Let me check the exact wording.

The question says, "when people are hungry, they typically desire:" and the options are A through J. So the options are not pairs but single statements.

Looking again, option C says " pleasant gustatory sensations." That's one part. Option E says "to feel full." That's the other part. Wait, but I thought Feinberg's main point is the pleasure of the food (so C) and the desire to feel full (so E). So, the question is phrased as which of the options is correct.

Wait, but the options are single statements. So the answer might be E, because E is a direct consequence, or C. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Feinberg's "View of Feeding" discusses the need for immediate and pleasurable foods. He distinguishes between the need to satisfy immediate hunger and the need to feel full, which is more about the act of eating. So when someone is hungry, they want to eat (to satisfy the immediate need) and also want to feel full, which is the result of eating.

But the question is asking what they typically desire. So perhaps the correct answer includes both, but the options are separate. Alternatively, the correct answer is E because it's part of the process. Wait, no, the question is about what they typically desire, not the actions they take.

Wait, the options are:

C: pleasant gustatory sensations.

E: to feel full.

So, Feinberg's theory includes both the desire to eat (to feel full) and the pleasure from the taste (gustatory sensations). But the options don't combine. So perhaps the correct answer is E because that's the primary desire, and C is a complementary aspect. But the question is asking which statement he claims, so maybe both are correct, but the options are single choices.

Wait, looking back, the options are A to J. So Feinberg's claim is that when hungry, people desire both the pleasure of the food (C) and the feeling of fullness (E). But since each option is a single statement, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's a direct consequence of eating, and C is more about the satisfaction of the food. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering E as the correct answer.

Wait, the question is phrased as "typically desires." So, Feinberg's theory states that people seek to satisfy their hunger by feeling full, which is the result of their desire for pleasant food. So, the primary desire is E, but he also mentions the pleasure of the food, which would be C. But the options don't combine, so if both are correct, but the question is a single choice, perhaps the intended answer is E because that's the main aspect he emphasizes.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the options. Let me think about Feinberg's key points. I remember that Feinberg's theory includes the idea that people have a need for a certain kind of food—like, if it's sweet, they want it quickly. But in general, he points out that when you're hungry, you want both the pleasure of the food (gustatory sensations) and the ability to feel full.

So in that case, the correct answer would be both C and E. But since the options are single, perhaps the question is considering E as the correct answer because that's the direct action they desire.

Wait, but the question is phrased as what they typically desire, not what they do. So both the desire for the food's taste (C) and the desire to feel full (E) are correct. But the options are single statements, so perhaps the correct answer is E, as that's the main action they seek.

Alternatively, if the question is about the pleasure, then C is correct. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall from my notes. Feinberg's View of Feeding states that people desire both the pleasure of the food (gustatory sensations) and the ability to feel full, which is the result of eating. So the primary action is E: to feel full, and the satisfaction is C. But the question is phrased as what they typically desire, so perhaps both C and E are correct, but since the options are single, maybe the best answer is E because that's the direct action.

Wait, but in the options, E is a standalone statement. So if the question is asking which option represents what Feinberg claims, then the correct answer would be E and C, but the options don't combine, so perhaps E is correct because it's more about the immediate consequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the primary aspect, which is E. So I'm a bit torn, but I think E is the intended answer.

Feinberg's theory emphasizes the need for a specific type of food—satisfying the immediate hunger. When people are hungry, they desire two main things: the pleasure of the food (gustatory sensations), which is represented by option C, and the ability to feel full, which is option E. However, the question asks for what they typically desire, and since the options are single statements, the primary action they seek is E: to feel full.

ANSWER: E
