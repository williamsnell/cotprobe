Answer:
    <think>

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about diluting a HF solution to double the percent dissociation. Hmm, HF is a weak acid, right? And the dissociation constant is given as Kdiss, which I think is usually written as Ka for acids. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the problem says K_diss is 6.71e-4. Wait, usually Kdiss is Ksp for some salts, but for acids, I think it's Ka. So I'll proceed with that assumption.

The initial concentration of HF is 0.5 M. We want to find the factor by which to dilute it so that the percent dissociation doubles.

I remember that the percent dissociation depends on the concentration of the acid. For a weak acid, the percent dissociation (alpha) can be approximated using the formula alpha = sqrt(Ka * C) / (1 + sqrt(Ka*C)), where C is the concentration. Or wait, maybe it's alpha ≈ sqrt(Ka * C) because for dilute solutions, the background concentration (1) is negligible. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression.

Alternatively, the exact solution comes from the dissociation equation: HF ↔ H+ + F-. Let's set up the ICE table.

Initial concentration: [HF] = 0.5 M, [H+] = 0, [F-] = 0.

Change: Let x be the dissociation. So, [H+] = x, [F-] = x, [HF] = 0.5 -x.

At equilibrium, [HF] = 0.5 -x, [H+] = x, [F-]=x.

The Ka expression is (x^2)/(0.5 -x) = 6.71e-4.

Since Ka is small, x is much smaller than 0.5, so we can approximate 0.5 -x ≈ 0.5. So, x^2 ≈ 6.71e-4 * 0.5, which is about 3.355e-4. Taking square root, x≈ sqrt(3.355e-4) ≈ 0.0183 M.

So the percent dissociation is (0.0183 / 0.5)*100 = 3.66%. Hmm, but the question is to find the dilution factor so that this percent doubles.

Wait, wait, but how does dilution affect the percent dissociation? Because if you dilute the solution, the same concentration of acid will result in a lower percent dissociation. Because Ka is a constant, diluting the acid solution would lower the concentration.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the initial solution is 0.5 M. So when you dilute it, the new concentration is C', and we want the percent dissociation (alpha') to be double that of the initial (alpha_initial = 3.66% → 7.32% desired).

Wait, no. Wait, the initial solution has a certain alpha. We're looking to double that alpha. But if we dilute the solution, the concentration is lower, so alpha would decrease, not increase. Hmm, that seems contradictory.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the initial solution has a certain alpha, and when we dilute, the alpha increases. Because if you have a stronger acid, but wait, no, stronger acid (higher Ka) would have a higher percent dissociation at the same concentration. But when you dilute, the concentration decreases, so the percent dissociation should decrease. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the percent dissociation is doubled when we dilute the solution. So, for example, initial alpha is 3.66%, we want it to be 7.32% after dilution. But that would require the concentration to be lower, which would make alpha lower, not higher. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, maybe the question is that the percent dissociation is doubled when you dilute. But if you dilute, the concentration goes down, so the percent dissociation goes down. Unless the dilution changes the concentration in such a way that it affects the dissociation. But I think in most cases, dilution would decrease the percent dissociation, because the acid is diluted, so the same concentration would produce a lower degree of dissociation.

Wait, but perhaps I got the initial calculation wrong. Let's think again.

Wait, the initial solution is 0.5 M HF. Let's compute the initial percent dissociation.

Ka is 6.71e-4.

So, x^2 = 6.71e-4 * 0.5 → 3.355e-4 → x= approx 0.0183 M.

Percent dissociation = (0.0183 / 0.5) *100 =3.66%.

So to double that, we want 7.32% dissociation.

But how can that happen? Because if we dilute the solution, the concentration is lower, so the percent dissociation should decrease, not increase. So perhaps the question is that when we dilute, the percent dissociation increases. That seems impossible under normal circumstances, unless we're considering a different scenario, perhaps in a different solvent or with a different solubility.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the same concentration of acid. Wait, maybe the solution is prepared with a certain concentration, and we're diluting it such that the percent of dissociation is doubled. But how can that happen? Because if we dilute the solution, the concentration is lower, so the same amount of acid would dissociate less. So the percent dissociation would decrease.

So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the initial solution, but about another scenario. Alternatively, perhaps I have the wrong approach. Maybe I should model the dilution and see how the percent dissociation changes.

Let me think about the initial and final concentrations.

Let’s denote the original concentration as C1 = 0.5 M.

After dilution, the concentration is C2 = C1 * (dilution factor) = 0.5 * x, where x is the factor by which it's multiplied. So dilution factor is x, but wait, I think I should denote the dilution factor as D = C2 / C1 = 0.5 / C2.

Wait, no: if you dilute by a factor of D, then C2 = C1 / D.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think in terms of the dilution factor.

Suppose I have a solution with concentration C, and I dilute it by a factor of D. Then the new concentration is C' = C / D.

Wait, no, actually, the dilution factor is the factor by which you multiply the concentration. So if you have a solution and you dilute it by a factor of 2, the new concentration is half. So D = 2 → C' = C/2.

So for this problem, the initial concentration is C1 = 0.5 M, and the desired concentration is C2 = 0.5 / D, where D is the dilution factor (since D is the factor by which you're multiplying, so C2 = C1 / D).

But wait, the question asks for the dilution factor so that the percent dissociation is doubled. Wait, but according to my previous calculation, if we dilute, the percent dissociation would decrease. So I must have misunderstood.

Wait, perhaps the question is inverting the scenario. Let me think again. Suppose the initial solution has a concentration of 0.5 M, and the percent dissociation is 3.66% (as calculated). We want to find the dilution factor such that the new percent dissociation is 7.32% (double the original). But if we dilute, the concentration is lower, so the same amount of acid would dissociate less. So the percent dissociation would decrease.

So this seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I have the wrong formula for the percent dissociation. Let me double-check.

The percent dissociation is (alpha) * 100%, where alpha is x / C, with x being the concentration of H+ ions (which equals F- concentration).

So, alpha = (x) / C.

But in the case where the solution is diluted, C decreases. So, for the same x (since the acid is more concentrated, but in the diluted solution, the same x would imply a lower alpha), but if I have a solution that's more dilute (lower C), then for the same x, alpha is lower.

Therefore, if I want to double alpha, I need to have a higher alpha, but by diluting, the alpha would decrease. So that can't happen. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the percent of dissociation in terms of the initial solution. So, when you dilute, the same concentration of HF (0.5 M) is diluted to a lower concentration, thus the percent dissociation would decrease.

But the question asks to double the percent dissociation. That seems impossible under normal circumstances, unless the initial solution is a very weak acid. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the percent dissociation in the diluted solution is twice that in the original solution. But that's not what the question says. The question is to double the percent dissociation.

Wait, perhaps I should start by considering the formula for percent dissociation.

Wait, another approach. Let's denote the initial concentration as C = 0.5 M, and the initial percent dissociation as p = 3.66% (approx).

We need to find the dilution factor such that the percent dissociation becomes 2p = 7.32%.

But wait, as I thought before, if you dilute, the concentration drops, and the percent dissociation would drop, not rise. So, I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the same concentration of HF, but about the same amount of acid. Or perhaps, perhaps I should think about this in terms of the acid's dissociation in a more general way.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the same amount of acid being dissociated. But that's not what the question says.

Wait, let me read the question again: "Determine how much dilution is necessary to double the percent dissociation of HF."

Ah, perhaps I'm miscalculating the initial percent dissociation. Let me recompute.

Ka = 6.71e-4.

Initial concentration: C =0.5 M.

x^2 = C * Ka → x^2 = 0.5 *6.71e-4 ≈ 3.355e-4 → x= sqrt(3.355e-4) ≈ 0.0183 M.

So, percent dissociation is (0.0183 / 0.5 ) *100 = 3.66%.

Now, the problem is to find the dilution factor such that the percent dissociation is 7.32%.

But as I thought earlier, this is impossible because dilution lowers the concentration, leading to lower percent dissociation.

Unless the question is about the same concentration but a different solution, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different setup, like the same amount of acid being used, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the same concentration of acid (0.5 M) is used, but when you dilute, the same amount of acid is present but in a smaller volume, which affects the concentration.

Wait, but in that case, the concentration would change, and the percent dissociation would change as well.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the same concentration of acid is present but in a smaller volume. So, the same moles of HF are present in a smaller volume, which would affect the concentration, thus the percent dissociation.

Wait, but the question says "determine how much dilution is necessary to double the percent dissociation". So perhaps the initial setup is to have a solution where the percent dissociation is p, and after dilution, the percent is 2p.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. Suppose the solution is diluted by a factor D, so the new concentration is C' = C / D.

The new percent dissociation is 2p = 2 * (sqrt(Ka*C)/ (1 + sqrt(Ka*C)) ) * 100.

Wait, but when you dilute, Ka remains the same. Let me denote the initial percent dissociation as p_initial = (x1 / C) *100, where x1 = sqrt(Ka * C).

After dilution, x2 = sqrt(Ka * (C / D)) → x2 = sqrt( (Ka / D) * C )

p_final = (x2 / (C/D)) *100 = [ sqrt( (Ka * C ) / D ) / (C/D) ] *100 → [ sqrt( Ka * C ) / sqrt(D) ) ] * (D / C ) *100.

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, x2 = sqrt( (Ka * C) / D ) → x2 = sqrt( (Ka * C ) ) / sqrt(D).

The new concentration is C' = C / D.

So, p_final = x2 / C' *100 → [ (sqrt(Ka * C) / sqrt(D)) ) / (C/D) ) ] *100.

Simplify this:

= [ sqrt(Ka*C) / sqrt(D) ) * (D / C) ) ] *100

= [ sqrt(Ka*C) * D / (C * sqrt(D)) ) ] *100

= [ sqrt(Ka*C) * sqrt(D) ) / (C) ] *100.

Simplify sqrt(Ka*C) as x1, so x1 = sqrt(Ka*C), which is the initial x.

So, p_final = [ x1 * sqrt(D) / C ] *100.

But p_initial is [x1 * C ] / ( C ) *100 → p_initial = x1 *100 / C.

Wait, no. Wait, p_initial is (x1 / C) *100 → x1 = p_initial * C / 100.

So substituting x1 into p_final:

p_final = [ (p_initial * C/100) * sqrt(D) / C ] * 100.

Simplify:

= [ (p_initial * sqrt(D)) / 100 ) ] *100.

= p_initial * sqrt(D).

So, p_final = p_initial * sqrt(D).

We want p_final = 2 p_initial.

So, 2 p_initial = p_initial * sqrt(D) → 2 = sqrt(D) → D = 4.

Wait, but the options don't have 4 as an answer. The options start from 4.13. Hmm.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Let me retrace.

Wait, the equation I derived was p_final = p_initial * sqrt(D). But according to the problem, p_final is 2p_initial. So 2p = p * sqrt(D) → 2 = sqrt(D) → D=4.

But none of the options match 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me re-express the equation.

We have:

p_final = p_initial * sqrt(D).

We want p_final = 2 p_initial → 2 p_initial = p_initial * sqrt(D).

Divide both sides by p_initial (assuming p_initial is not zero, which it isn't):

2 = sqrt(D) → D=4.

So according to this, the dilution factor D is 4.

But the options don't include 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the dilution factor. Let me think again. The dilution factor D is the factor by which we multiply the concentration. So if the initial concentration is C, and we dilute by a factor D, the new concentration is C/D.

Wait, but in the equation, D is the dilution factor, which would represent (C' = C / D). So in the calculation, when D is 4, C' is C/4.

Wait, but according to the equation, when D is 4, p_final = 2 p_initial. So that would imply that 4 is the dilution factor leading to a doubling of the percent dissociation.

But the options are:

A:4.13

B:3.21

C:5.65

D:2.06

E:6.89

F:8.26

G:1.03

H:9.47

I:10.52

J:7.28

So none of these options matches 4. So there must be a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the percent dissociation. Another thought: perhaps the formula p = (x)/(0.5) *100 is the same as what I used.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider that in the initial solution, the percent dissociation is p=3.66%. We want to find the dilution factor D such that the percent dissociation becomes 2p=7.32%.

But if we dilute by D, then the new concentration is C/D. Wait, but the formula for percent dissociation is x/(C') *100, where C' is the new concentration.

So, in the initial solution, x is the same as before, but C' = C/D.

So, the new percent dissociation p_new = x/(C/D) *100 = (x D) / C *100.

But x = sqrt( Ka * C ) → x = sqrt(6.71e-4 *0.5) ≈ 0.0183.

So, p_new = (0.0183 * D ) / 0.5 *100 → (0.0183 * D) / 0.5 *100 = D * (0.0183 /0.5 ) *100.

But p_initial is 0.0183/0.5 *100 =3.66%, so p_new = D *3.66% → D = p_new /3.66.

We want p_new =7.32% → D=7.32/3.66= 2.

So D is 2. So the dilution factor is 2.

But according to my earlier calculation, using the equation D=4.

Wait, so something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but in the setup, I made a mistake. Let me re-express.

The initial percent dissociation is p = (x_initial) / (C) *100.

As we dilute, the new concentration is C'.

The new x is x_new = sqrt( Ka * C' ) = sqrt( Ka * (C/D) ) = sqrt( Ka * C ) * sqrt(1/D) ) = x_initial * sqrt(1/D) ).

So, the new percent dissociation is (x_new / C') *100 → [ (x_initial * sqrt(1/D)) / (C/D) ) ] *100.

Simplify:

= [ x_initial * sqrt(1/D) * D / C ) ] *100.

= [ x_initial * sqrt(D) ) * (D/C) ) ] *100.

Wait, but in the initial setup, C is 0.5 M, so x_initial = sqrt( Ka * C ) = sqrt(6.71e-4 *0.5) ≈0.0183.

So, substituting:

p_new = [ (0.0183) * sqrt(D) ) * ( D /0.5 ) ) ] *100.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should use the equation I derived earlier.

From the equation, p_new = p_initial * sqrt(D).

So if p_initial is 3.66%, and p_new is 7.32%, then 7.32 = 3.66 * sqrt(D).

Solving for sqrt(D):

sqrt(D)=7.32/3.66=2.

So D=4.

But according to the way I set up the problem, a D of 4 would double the percent dissociation.

Wait, but according to the initial setup, if I dilute by D, the new concentration is C/D, and the new x is sqrt( Ka * (C/D) ). So the new percent dissociation is (x / (C/D)) *100.

Which is (x D)/(C) *100.

But x = sqrt( Ka * C ), so substituting:

= [ sqrt(Ka C) D ] / C *100.

= [ sqrt(Ka) * sqrt(C) * D ] / C *100.

= [ sqrt(Ka) * sqrt(D) ] *100.

So p_new = [ sqrt(Ka) ] * [ sqrt(D) ] * (100 / sqrt(C) ) * sqrt(C) )? I'm getting lost again.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the equation p_new = p_initial * sqrt(D).

So if p_initial is 3.66%, and p_new is 7.32%, then 7.32 = 3.66 * sqrt(D) → sqrt(D) = 2 → D=4.

So according to this, the dilution factor should be 4. But according to the options given, 4 is not present. The closest option is 4.13 (option A).

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation was wrong and the correct approach leads to a different answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the dilution factor such that the percent dissociation is doubled when you have the same concentration of acid. But that doesn't fit the question.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try to think differently.

Let me denote the initial concentration as C =0.5 M, and the initial percent dissociation as p_initial = (x_initial / C ) *100, where x_initial is sqrt( Ka * C ).

Similarly, after dilution, the concentration is C' = C/D, and x_new = sqrt( Ka * C' ).

The new percent dissociation is p_new = (x_new / C' ) *100.

We want p_new = 2 p_initial.

So,

( x_new / (C/D) ) *100 = 2 * (x_initial / C ) *100.

Simplify:

( x_new * D / C ) = 2 (x_initial / C ) *100.

Multiply both sides by C:

x_new * D = 2 x_initial * 100.

But x_initial = sqrt( Ka C ), and x_new = sqrt( Ka C' ) = sqrt( Ka (C/D) ) ) = sqrt( (Ka C) / D ) ) = sqrt( (Ka C) ) / sqrt(D) ) = x_initial / sqrt(D).

Substituting into the equation:

( x_initial / sqrt(D) ) * D = 2 x_initial *100.

Simplify:

x_initial * D / sqrt(D) ) = 2 x_initial *100.

x_initial * sqrt(D) ) = 2 x_initial *100.

Divide both sides by x_initial (assuming x_initial is not zero):

sqrt(D) = 200.

So D = (200)^2 =40000.

Wait, that's way larger than any of the options given. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the pH. The pH is -log(p), where p is the percent dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be p = (x) / (C) *100, which is the same as (x/C)*100.

But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the dilution factor as D, and the new concentration as C' = C/D.

The new percent dissociation is p_new = (x_new / C') *100.

We want p_new = 2 p_initial.

So,

(x_new / (C/D) ) *100 = 2 (x_initial / C ) *100.

Simplify:

(x_new * D / C ) = 2 (x_initial / C ) *100.

Multiply both sides by C:

x_new * D = 2 x_initial * 100.

So,

x_new = (2 x_initial *100 ) / D.

But x_new = sqrt( Ka (C/D) ) = sqrt( Ka C / D ) = sqrt( (Ka C ) ) / sqrt(D) ) = x_initial / sqrt(D).

Substituting back:

x_initial / sqrt(D) = (2 x_initial *100 ) / D.

Multiply both sides by D:

x_initial * D / sqrt(D) ) = 2 x_initial *100.

Divide both sides by x_initial:

D / sqrt(D) ) = 200.

Simplify D / sqrt(D) = sqrt(D).

So,

sqrt(D) = 200.

So,

D = (200)^2 =40,000.

But none of the options given match 40,000. So perhaps my approach is incorrect, and another way of solving the problem is needed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for p_new. Let me re-express.

In the initial solution, p_initial = (x_initial) / (C) ) *100.

After diluting, the new concentration is C' = C/D.

The new x_new is sqrt( Ka * C' ) = sqrt( Ka (C/D) ) = sqrt( Ka C ) / sqrt(D) ) = x_initial / sqrt(D).

The new p_new is (x_new) / (C') ) *100 = (x_initial / sqrt(D) ) / ( C/D ) ) *100.

Simplify:

( x_initial / sqrt(D) ) * ( D / C ) *100.

= (x_initial D ) / ( C sqrt(D) ) ) *100.

= (x_initial sqrt(D) ) / C ) *100.

= [ x_initial / C ) *100 ] * sqrt(D) ).

= p_initial * sqrt(D).

So, p_new = p_initial * sqrt(D).

We want p_new = 2 p_initial.

So,

2 p_initial = p_initial * sqrt(D).

Divide both sides by p_initial (assuming p_initial is not zero):

2 = sqrt(D).

Square both sides:

D =4.

Wait, according to this, the dilution factor D is 4.

But according to the earlier equation, when D=4, p_new=2 p_initial.

Which would imply that 4 is the correct answer.

But the options don't include 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the variables. Let me try a different approach.

Let me compute the dilution factor in terms of the concentration.

The initial concentration is 0.5 M. After dilution, the concentration is 0.5 / D.

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the dilution factor as D, and the new concentration is C' = C / D.

The new percent dissociation is p_new = (x_new / C' ) *100.

We want p_new = 2 p_initial.

But x_new = sqrt( Ka * C' ).

So, substituting x_new into p_new:

p_new = ( sqrt( Ka * C' ) / C' ) *100.

= ( sqrt( Ka ) * sqrt( C' ) / C' ) ) *100.

= ( sqrt( Ka ) / sqrt( C' ) ) *100.

= ( sqrt( Ka ) / sqrt( C' ) ) *100.

But C' = C / D → sqrt( C' ) = sqrt( C ) / sqrt( D ).

Substituting:

= ( sqrt( Ka ) / ( sqrt( C ) / sqrt( D ) ) ) *100.

= ( sqrt( Ka ) * sqrt( D ) / sqrt( C ) ) *100.

= [ ( sqrt( Ka ) / sqrt( C ) ) * sqrt( D ) ] *100.

= ( sqrt( (Ka)/C ) * sqrt(D) ) *100.

Now, (Ka)/C is (6.71e-4) / (0.5) )= 1.342e-3.

So sqrt(1.342e-3) = approximately 0.0366.

So, (0.0366) * sqrt(D) ) *100 = p_new.

But p_initial is (0.0366) *100 =3.66%.

So,

p_new = (0.0366 * sqrt(D) ) *100 =3.66% * sqrt(D).

We want p_new =7.32% =2 *3.66%.

So,

7.32 = 2 *3.66 → 7.32 =7.32.

Which implies that 3.66% * sqrt(D) ) =7.32%.

So,

sqrt(D) =7.32% /3.66% =2.

So,

D = (2)^2 =4.

Thus, the dilution factor is 4.

But the options don't include 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the initial percent dissociation is p_initial =3.66%, and the new one is p_new =7.32%, so p_new = 2.03 * p_initial.

Wait, but 7.32 is 2 times 3.66.

Wait, perhaps another approach: let me compute p_new =2 p_initial.

So,

p_new =2 p_initial → [ (sqrt( (Ka) * (C/D) ) / ( C/D ) ) ] *100 = 2 * [ sqrt( Ka *C ) / ( C ) ) *100 ].

Wait, I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula p_new = p_initial * sqrt(D).

So, to double the percent dissociation (p_initial to 2 p_initial), we have:

2 p_initial = p_initial * sqrt(D) → sqrt(D) =2 → D=4.

But option A is4.13, which is close to4 but higher.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:4.13, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct equation leads to a different solution.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the dilution factor as D, and the new concentration is C / D.

The new percent dissociation is p_new = (x_new) / (C_new) ) *100.

But x_new = sqrt( Ka * (C/D) ) → x_new = sqrt( Ka * C ) / sqrt( D ) → x_new = x_initial / sqrt(D) → where x_initial is sqrt( Ka * C ).

So, p_new = (x_new) / (C/D) ) *100 → (x_initial / sqrt(D) ) / (C/D) ) *100 → (x_initial D ) / ( C sqrt(D) ) ) *100 → (x_initial sqrt(D) )/( C ) ) *100 → (x_initial / C ) ) * sqrt(D) *100 → p_initial * sqrt(D) *100.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me re-express:

p_new = (x_new) / (C_new) *100 → (x_initial / sqrt(D)) ) / ( C / D ) *100 → (x_initial / sqrt(D)) * ( D / C ) *100 → (x_initial D ) / ( C sqrt(D) ) ) *100 → (x_initial sqrt(D) ) / ( C ) ) *100.

Wait, but (x_initial / C ) ) *100 is p_initial. So:

p_new = p_initial * ( sqrt(D) ) * ( D / ... ) → Not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the equation p_new = p_initial * sqrt(D).

We want p_new = 2 p_initial → 2 = sqrt(D) → D=4.

But the options don't have 4. So perhaps the correct approach is to find D such that p_new =2 p_initial, but the equation p_new =p_initial * sqrt(D) is only valid under certain conditions.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when you dilute by a factor D, the percent dissociation increases by a factor of sqrt(D).

So, if you want the percent dissociation to double, sqrt(D) =2 → D=4.

Thus, the dilution factor is4.

But in the options, the closest is option A:4.13.

Wait, maybe I should compute it using another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is p_new = p_initial * (C / (C - D * C )) ) → But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it in terms of dilution and percent dissociation.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for p_new and set it equal to 2 p_initial, then solve for D.

Using the formula p_new = p_initial * sqrt(D).

We need p_new = 2 p_initial → 2 = sqrt(D) → D=4.

But according to the options, the correct answer isn't present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial percent dissociation is 3.66%, and when I dilute by a factor of D, the new concentration is C/D, and the new percent dissociation p_new = (x_new) / (C/D) ) *100.

But x_new = sqrt( Ka * (C/D) ) = sqrt( Ka * C ) / sqrt( D ) ) → x_new = x_initial / sqrt(D), where x_initial is sqrt( Ka * C ).

So, p_new = (x_initial / sqrt(D) ) / (C/D) ) *100 → (x_initial / sqrt(D) ) * (D / C ) ) *100.

But x_initial / C = p_initial /100.

So, substituting:

p_new = ( (p_initial /100) ) * ( D / sqrt(D) ) ) *100 → (p_initial /100) * D * sqrt( D ) ) *100 → p_initial * D * sqrt( D ) /100 *100.

Wait, that's not correct. Let me re-express.

p_new = (x_initial / sqrt(D) ) * ( D / C ) ) *100.

But x_initial / C = (sqrt( Ka * C )) / C ) = sqrt( Ka ) / sqrt(C ).

So, substituting:

p_new = ( sqrt( Ka ) / sqrt(C ) ) * ( D / sqrt(D) ) ) *100.

= ( sqrt( Ka ) / sqrt(C ) ) * ( sqrt(D) ) / ( sqrt(D) ) ) *100 → Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the dilution equation.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is p_new = p_initial * ( C / ( C - D * C ) ) → No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula p_new = p_initial * ( sqrt( C / (D * C) )) → No, I'm not getting anywhere.

At this point, perhaps the correct answer is option A:4.13, but I'm not sure how to arrive at that. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 4, but it's not present in the options. Thus, perhaps the intended answer is option A:4.13.
</think>

The correct approach involves understanding the relationship between the dilution factor and the percent dissociation. For a 50% dilution, the percent dissociation is 3.66%. When the dilution factor is 4, the percent dissociation doubles to 7.32%. Thus, the dilution factor is 4. However, the options provided do not include 4. The closest option is A:4.13, which might account for rounding or approximations in the problem setup.
