B: 0.05
C: 0.17
D: 0.13
E: 0.25
F: 0.09
G: 0.20
H: 0.08

Okay, I need to calculate the Carnot efficiency for this steam engine. I remember that Carnot efficiency is the maximum efficiency possible for any engine operating between two temperatures. The formula for Carnot efficiency is η = 1 - (Tc/Th), where Tc is the cold reservoir temperature and Th is the hot reservoir temperature. 

Wait, the problem says the steam is at 100°C and discharging at 60°C. Oh right, I need to convert those to Kelvin. Because the formula uses Kelvin. So 100°C is 373.15 K, and 60°C is 333.15 K. 

So plugging into the formula: η = 1 - (333.15 / 373.15). Let me compute that. Let's see, 333.15 divided by 373.15 is approximately 0.894. So 1 minus that is about 0.106. Hmm, but wait, I should check if the formula is correct. Oh wait, wait, maybe I got the temperatures flipped. Because in the formula, Th is the hot and Tc is the cold. So yeah, 100°C is hotter, 60 is colder. 

Wait, another thought: sometimes the formula is written with the absolute temperatures. So yeah, that's correct. But let me recalculate the division. Let's compute 333.15 divided by 373.15. Hmm, 333.15 divided by 373.15. Let me do the division: 333.15 / 373.15 ≈ 0.894. So 1 - 0.894 is 0.106. So about 10.6% efficiency. 

Looking at the options, option B is 0.05, which is 5%. Hmmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is written as η = (Th - Tc)/Th. Let me see. Oh wait, yes, that's another way to write the same thing. Because 1 - (Tc/Th) is the same as (Th - Tc)/Th. So let me compute it that way. 

Th - Tc = 373.15 - 333.15 = 40 K. So η = 40 / 373.15 ≈ 0.107 or 10.7%. So that's about 0.107, which is approximately 0.11. Looking at the options, J is 0.11. So the answer should be J: 0.11. But wait, wait another moment. Let me recheck. 

Wait, another possibility: Oh, wait, sometimes the formula uses (T_hot - T_cold) / T_hot. So that's what I did. So 40 / 373.15 is about 0.107, which rounds to 0.11. So the correct answer is J: 0.11. Looking at the options, J is 0.11. So the correct choice is J.

To calculate the Carnot efficiency of the steam engine, we use the formula:

\[
\eta = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}
\]

where \( T_c \) is the cold reservoir temperature and \( T_h \) is the hot reservoir temperature. Both temperatures must be in Kelvin. The given temperatures are \( 100^\circ \text{C} \) and \( 60^\circ \text{C} \), which convert to \( 373.15 \, \text{K} \) and \( 333.15 \, \text{K} \), respectively.

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\eta = 1 - \frac{333.15}{373.15} = 1 - 0.894 \approx 0.106
\]

This is approximately \( 10.6\% \). However, the problem provides options in decimal form, so we round to the nearest hundredth:

\[
\eta \approx 0.11
\]

Thus, the Carnot efficiency is \( 0.11 \), corresponding to option J.
