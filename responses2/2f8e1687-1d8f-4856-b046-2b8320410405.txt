Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem here. Let me read it again and think it through. 

The setup is a boy on a bridge. The bridge is 49 feet high. The boy is leaning over the bridge and sees a train approaching with uniform speed. He tries to drop a stone, and he releases it when the engine of the train is 80 feet away from the bridge. The stone hits the ground 3 feet in front of the engine. So, the question is asking for the speed of the train, and there are options from A to J.

Hmm, so I need to find the speed of the train. Let's think about the physics involved here. When the boy drops the stone, it's under the influence of gravity, right? So the stone will fall straight down because the initial horizontal velocity is zero. But the train is moving towards the boy, so the stone will also have some horizontal motion because the train is moving.

Wait, no. When the stone is dropped, it would have zero initial horizontal velocity. So the horizontal velocity of the stone is the same as the train's velocity at the time of release. Because in the frame of the train, the stone would move forward with the train's speed. But wait, actually, in the ground frame, the stone has its initial horizontal velocity, which is the same as the train's speed, because the train is moving with constant speed.

Wait, no, the train is moving, so if the boy releases the stone when the train is moving, the stone will have the same horizontal speed as the train. Because the train's speed is uniform, so it's constant.

So, the stone is dropped, so its initial vertical velocity is zero. It will accelerate downward due to gravity. The distance from the bridge to where the stone lands is 49 feet plus 3 feet—wait no, wait. Wait, the boy releases the stone when the engine is 80 ft away from the bridge. The stone hits the ground 3 ft in front of the engine. So the total horizontal distance covered by the stone is 80 ft + 3 ft = 83 ft.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the boy releases the stone when the engine is 80 ft away from the bridge. So the bridge is 49 ft high, so the stone is 49 ft below the bridge when released. The ground is 49 ft below the bridge, so when the stone falls, it's going to hit the ground 3 ft ahead of the engine. So the distance from the point of release to the impact point is 80 ft plus 3 ft, which is 83 ft. So the horizontal distance is 83 ft.

Wait, but the horizontal motion of the stone is the same as the train's speed. So the time it takes for the stone to fall is the same as the time it takes for the train to move 83 ft. Because the horizontal distance is determined by the train's speed and the time of flight.

So first, I'll calculate the time it takes for the stone to fall from the bridge to the ground. That's a free-fall problem, right? The equation for vertical motion is:

h = (1/2) g t²

Where h is the height (49 ft), and g is the acceleration due to gravity. But wait, I need to make sure the units are in feet. So 49 ft.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives speeds in mph and distances in feet. Hmm, so we need to make sure the units are consistent. Let's see.

Wait, but in physics, the standard unit for time in free fall is seconds, so perhaps I should convert feet to meters. Alternatively, maybe just work in feet and use the appropriate formula.

Alternatively, maybe using the acceleration due to gravity as 32 ft/s². Because in imperial units, g ≈ 32 ft/s².

So plugging into the equation:

49 = 0.5 * 32 * t²

Simplify that:

49 = 16 t²

t² = 49 / 16 ≈ 3.0625

t ≈ sqrt(3.0625) ≈ 1.75 seconds.

So the time it takes for the stone to hit the ground is 1.75 seconds.

Now, the horizontal distance is 83 ft, and that's equal to the train's speed multiplied by this time. So:

distance = speed * time
83 = v * 1.75

So solving for v:

v = 83 / 1.75 ≈ 47.42857 ft/s.

Now, convert that speed into mph. So first, find ft/s to mph. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, and 5280 feet in a mile. So:

v = 47.42857 ft/s * (1 mile / 5280 ft) * (3600 s / 1 hour)

Let me compute that.

First, 47.42857 ft/s * 3600 s/hour = 47.42857 * 3600 ≈ 170742.4728 ft/hour.

Then, divide by 5280 ft/mile:

170742.4728 / 5280 ≈ 32.35 mph.

Wait, that's about 32.35 mph. Looking at the options, the choices are in whole numbers. The options are A:55, B:20, C:30, D:60, E:40, F:35, G:50, H:25, I:15, J:45.

So 32.35 would be closest to option F (35 mph) or option C (30 mph). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made an error in the unit conversion.

Wait, let me recalculate the conversion.

47.42857 ft/s * 3600 s/hour = 47.42857 * 3600 = ?

Let me compute 47 * 3600 = 169200. 0.42857 * 3600 ≈ 1542.857. So total is approx 169200 + 1542.857 = 170742.857 ft/hour.

Divide by 5280 ft per mile:

170742.857 / 5280 ≈ Let's compute that.

5280 * 32 = 168,960. Because 5280 *30=158,400, and 5280*2=10,560. So 30+2=32, 158,400 + 10,560 = 168,960.

Subtract that from 170,742.857: 170,742.857 - 168,960 = 1,782.857.

Now, how many miles is that per 5280? So 1,782.857 / 5280 ≈ 0.338 miles.

So total is 32.338 mph, which is approximately 32.34 mph.

Looking at the options, none is exactly 32.34. But the options are in whole numbers. So the closest is 30 mph (option C) or 35 mph (option F). 32.34 is closer to 32.3, but 30 is 2.34 away, and 35 is 2.66 away. Hmm, so which is closer?

Wait, 32.34 is 2.34 above 30, and 2.66 below 35. So 30 is closer. Oh wait no, wait 32-30 is 2.34, 35-32 is 3. So 30 is closer.

So the answer would be 30 mph, which is option C.

Wait, but wait, did I miscalculate the time? Let me check the time again.

h = 49 ft, g=32 ft/s².

t = sqrt(2h/g) = sqrt(2 *49 /32) => sqrt(98/32) = sqrt(3.0625) = 1.75 s. Yep, that's correct.

So the horizontal speed is 83 ft/s. So 83 / 1.75 = 47.42857 ft/s.

Converting to mph.

Wait, 1.75 seconds gives 49 ft, so 49 ft is the height. So the time is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: when the boy releases the stone, the engine is 80 ft away from the bridge. So the distance from the point of release to the impact point is 80 ft + 3 ft = 83 ft. So yes, the horizontal distance is 83 ft.

Wait, but another thing—did I account for the fact that the train is moving towards the bridge? No, because the horizontal speed is the same as the train's speed. Because as the train moves, the stone's horizontal speed is the same as the train's speed at the time of release. So the stone moves forward at the same rate the train is approaching.

Wait, I think I'm correct. So the calculations seem right. So the train's speed is approximately 32.3 mph, which is closest to option C) 30 mph.
</think>

To determine the speed of the train, we analyze the motion of the stone and the train. The stone is dropped from a height of 49 feet and hits the ground 3 feet in front of the train's engine. The train is approaching the bridge at a uniform speed, and the boy releases the stone when the engine is 80 feet away from the bridge. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Vertical Motion (Stone's Fall):**  
   The stone falls freely under gravity. Using the equation for vertical motion:  
   \[
   h = \frac{1}{2} g t^2
   \]  
   where \( h = 49 \, \text{ft} \) and \( g = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \).  
   Solving for \( t \):  
   \[
   49 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 32 \cdot t^2 \implies t^2 = \frac{49}{16} \implies t = \sqrt{3.0625} \approx 1.75 \, \text{seconds}.
   \]

2. **Horizontal Motion (Train's Movement):**  
   The horizontal distance traveled by the stone is equal to the distance traveled by the train in the same time. The total horizontal distance is:  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{ft} + 3 \, \text{ft} = 83 \, \text{ft}.
   \]  
   The horizontal speed of the train is then:  
   \[
   v = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{83}{1.75} \approx 47.43 \, \text{ft/s}.
   \]

3. **Conversion to mph:**  
   To convert feet per second to miles per hour:  
   \[
   v = 47.43 \, \text{ft/s} \cdot \frac{3600 \, \text{s}}{5280 \, \text{ft}} \approx 32.34 \, \text{mph}.
   \]  
   This value is closest to **30 mph** among the given options.

### Conclusion:
The speed of the train is approximately **30 mph**, which corresponds to option **C**.
