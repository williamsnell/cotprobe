Okay, so I've got this financial question here about a nongovernmental, not-for-profit organization that held some investments. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question gives me two stocks, A and B. Each has an Investment Cost, Fair value at the beginning of the year, and Fair value at the end of the year. I need to figure out how to calculate the total stock investments reported in the year-end financial statement.

First, I remember that when recording stock investments, the initial cost is recorded at the beginning of the year. But I also need to consider any changes in fair value during the year. In a not-for-profit organization, I think they use the cost method for valuing investments unless they have a significant investment in another organization, which they don't here.

So for each stock, I should look at the beginning fair value and the end fair value. The change in fair value during the year will affect the investment balance.

Let's start with Stock A. It has 100 shares priced at $50 each. The beginning fair value is $45, and the end is $51. So the change is an increase of $6. That means the investment's value at the end of the year is $45 + $6 = $51. But since we're reporting the current year-end, we need to see if we should adjust using the end-of-year fair value. Wait, the question is about the year-end financial statement, so do we apply the end-of-year fair value to the investment balance?

Wait, no, not quite. The initial cost is at the beginning of the year. The fair value at the end of the year is the market value, so the investment should be recorded at the end of the year. So for each stock, the investment account is carried forward, but we need to adjust it based on the change in fair value during the period.

Wait, no, wait. The cost method: at the beginning of the year, the investment is recorded at cost. During the year, if the market value changes, the investment is adjusted. So the investment balance should be based on the end-of-year fair value.

Wait, but for a not-for-profit, if they have a long-term investment, they might use the cost method. So for each stock, we take the beginning fair value as the cost, and adjust it when the fair value changes.

So for each stock:

Stock A:
Cost: $50 *100= $5,000
Fair value at beginning: $45. But in the cost method, we don't adjust for this unless we're using the fair value method. Since it's a not-for-profit, maybe they use cost unless they have significant investments. Wait, I think for not-for-profits, they might not apply the fair value method. So in that case, the investment is recorded at cost unless it's adjusted based on fair value changes.

Wait, but I might be mixing up. Let me think again. The not-for-profit organization's financial statements use the cost method unless they have a significant investment in another organization, which they don't. So the investment would be recorded at the beginning of the year cost, and at the end of the year, the amount is adjusted to its fair value.

Wait, no, no. The cost method records the investment at cost, and if it's fair value changes during the period, the investment is adjusted. But for a not-for-profit, if they have a significant investment, they might switch to the fair value method. But in this case, the organization is nongovernmental and not for-profit, so perhaps the cost method is used unless they're holding long-term assets or something else. But wait, the question doesn't mention long-term assets, just investments. So I think the cost method is used.

So for each stock, the initial cost is recorded at the beginning of the year. Then, for each stock, the fair value at the end of the year is the market value, so the investment is carried forward.

Wait, but if the fair value changes during the year, the investment should be adjusted to the fair value at the end of the year, not the beginning. Or wait, no. Let me get this right.

The investment's value is based on the fair value at the end of the year. So regardless of changes during the year, you don't adjust the investment balance until the end of the period. But wait, the question is about the financial statement at the end of the year. So I think the investment would be recorded at the end of the year's fair value.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. The cost method requires that for cash investments, you record the cost at the time of purchase. For fair value, you adjust the investment based on the change in fair value during the period. But for not-for-profit, if their investments are classified as held to maturity, they may use the fair value method. Wait, but this option doesn't mention that. So perhaps the question assumes the cost method.

So the initial investment is at the beginning cost, and at the end, it's adjusted to the end fair value.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the reported amount. Let's take each stock one by one.

Stock A: 100 shares, cost $50, so total cost is $5000. At the end, fair value is $51. So the investment is now recorded at $51,000? Or is the initial cost $5000, and the fair value is $51,000, so the investment is at $51,000. But wait, the question is about the financial statement, so perhaps we take the end-of-year fair value as the reported value.

So for each stock, the investment's value is based on the end of the year fair value.

Wait, no. Because the cost method for not-for-profits is different. Sometimes, nongovernmental organizations use the fair value method, especially if they hold other investments. But the question doesn't specify that, so perhaps it's using the cost method.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the fair value method because it's a not-for-profit, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the process.

The problem says the organization is nongovernmental, not for-profit. So perhaps they use the fair value method unless they have significant investments in other organizations. Since they don't, they might use the fair value method.

Wait, no, that's more for when they hold long-term assets or investments. But if they are investing in stocks, perhaps the fair value method applies.

Wait, maybe I should think about this differently. The question says, "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Oh, but that's about the answer format, not the calculation. So perhaps I don't need to worry about that right now.

Wait, but for the financial statement, the investment should be recorded at the end of the year. So for each stock, the investment is recorded at the end's fair value.

So for each stock, the investment is at fair value at end of year.

So for Stock A:

Cost: 100 * $50 = $5000.

At the beginning of the year, fair value is $45. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if you bought it for $50 and it goes down to $45, that would be a loss, but for a not-for-profit, maybe they use the fair value method. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the not-for-profit uses the cost method unless it's classified as held-to-maturity.

Wait, let me look up: for not-for-profit organizations, do they use the fair value method for investments? I think they do. So, for example, if a not-for-profit holds a stock, they'd record it at the end-of-year fair value unless it's held to maturity, in which case they use the cost method.

But in this case, each stock is held for one year, so it's not held to maturity. So perhaps the not-for-profit uses the fair value method.

So each stock's investment is recorded at the end of the year's fair value.

So for each stock:

Stock A: 100 shares at $50. Fair value at end of year is $51. So the investment is $51,000.

Stock B: 200 shares at $40. Fair value is $49. So the investment is 200*49 = $9,800.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting confused. The initial cost is the beginning fair value. So for each stock, the initial cost is at the beginning of the year. Then, during the year, the fair value changes. So the investment should be adjusted at the end of the year, but for a not-for-profit, perhaps the investment is recorded at the end of the year's fair value. So in that case, each stock's investment is recorded at the end of the year's fair value.

So for Stock A: beginning fair value is $45, end is $51. So the investment is at $51,000.

Stock B: beginning fair value is $41, end is $49. So investment is $200*49 = $9,800.

Wait, but that would mean the total investment is 51,000 + 9,800 = 60,800. But none of the options are 60,800. Wait, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The investment's carrying value is based on the beginning fair value. Or is the cost method applied, and the end fair value is what's recorded.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The cost method is when you record the investment at the beginning of the year, and during the year, you adjust it to the end's fair value. So the investment is initially at the beginning's fair value, and during the year, if it's fair value changes, the investment is adjusted.

Wait, but for a not-for-profit, if they use the fair value method, they would adjust the investment to the end of the year's fair value.

Alternatively, perhaps the not-for-profit uses the fair value method, so the investment is recorded at the end's fair value. So:

For each stock, the investment is recorded at the end's fair value.

Wait, so for each stock:

Stock A: 100 shares at $50, beginning fair value is $45. So the initial cost is $5000. But for a not-for-profit, they would adjust the investment to the end's fair value of $51,000. So the investment balance is $51,000.

Stock B: 200 shares at $40, beginning fair value $41. So investment is 200 *40 = $8,000. But during the year, fair value goes to $49, so end of year fair value is $9,800.

Wait, that doesn't sound right because when you use the fair value method, you don't change the cost; you just adjust the value. So if the initial cost is $5000, and the fair value at end is $51,000, the investment balance would be $51,000.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the correct approach is to apply the fair value method, so the investment is recorded at the end of the year's fair value. So each stock's investment is recorded at its fair value at the end of the year.

So:

Stock A: 100 shares * $51 = $51,000.

Stock B: 200 * $49 = $9,800.

Total investment is $51,000 + $9,800 = $60,800. But looking at the options, none are close to that. The options are 14,300 and up.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake. Let me think again. Oh! Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the accounting principles. The question might be using the cost method, so the initial cost is recorded, and the fair value changes are not adjusted unless necessary. But for a not-for-profit, perhaps they use the fair value method.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how to calculate the investment balance in the financial statement. The financial statement is at the end of the year, so the investment is recorded at its fair value at the end of the year.

So for each stock, the investment's fair value is the value to report.

So:

Stock A: 100 shares, each at $50. The fair value at end of year is $51, so each share is worth $51, so 100*51=5100.

Stock B: 200 shares, each at $40. Fair value at end is $49, so 200 *49=9800.

Total investment is 5100 + 9800 = 14900.

Wait, that's $14,900. Looking at the options, that's option I: $14,900.

But wait, in the initial step, I thought the beginning fair value was for the cost method. So I think I'm mixing up the methods.

Alternatively, perhaps the not-for-profit uses the cost method, so the investment is recorded at the beginning's fair value. So for each stock, the investment is recorded as the beginning fair value. Then, during the year, the fair value changes, so the investment is adjusted. But the financial statement is at the end, so the value is based on the end's fair value.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me try to approach this differently.

The initial cost is recorded at the beginning of the year. Then, during the year, the fair value changes. So the investment is adjusted to the new fair value at the end of the year. But for a not-for-profit, perhaps they use the fair value method, so the investment is recorded at the end's fair value.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the investment is recorded at the end's fair value. So regardless of changes during the year, the investment's value is adjusted to the end of year's fair value.

So:

Stock A: 100 shares, each at $50. At the beginning, the fair value was $45, but that's the beginning. So during the year, fair value goes up to $51. But for the financial statement, the investment is recorded at the end's fair value, which is $51 per share.

So 100 *51 = $5,100.

Similarly, Stock B: 200 shares, each at $40. At the beginning of the year, fair value was $41, but during the year, it goes up to $49. So end fair value is $49 per share. 200 *49=9,800.

Total investment is 5,100 +9,800=14,900.

Looking at the options, option I is 14,900.

So that's the total amount reported. So the correct answer is I: $14,900.

To determine the amount reported in the year-end financial statement of financial position for the nongovernmental, not-for-profit organization's investments, we need to apply the appropriate accounting method. Since the organization is not-for-profit, it likely uses the fair value method for valuing its investments. This means the investment balance is recorded at the end-of-year fair value.

### Step 1: Calculate the investment value for each stock
- **Stock A (100 shares)**:  
  - **Beginning fair value**: $45 (but this is the initial cost recorded at the beginning of the year).  
  - **End-of-year fair value**: $51.  
  - **Investment value**: 100 shares × $51 = $5,100.

- **Stock B (200 shares)**:  
  - **Beginning fair value**: $41 (but this is the initial cost recorded at the beginning of the year).  
  - **End-of-year fair value**: $49.  
  - **Investment value**: 200 shares × $49 = $9,800.

### Step 2: Sum the investment values
- Total investment value = $5,100 (Stock A) + $9,800 (Stock B) = $14,900.

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The calculated total investment value of $14,900 corresponds to option **I: $14,900**.
