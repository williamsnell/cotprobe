Okay, so I'm looking at this question about a 4-year-old boy with certain medical signs. Let me break this down. The question is about choosing the right pharmacotherapy for him. The child has temperatures up to 39.4°C, which is a pretty high fever. He's been complaining for 8 days, so it's probably something serious.

The exam findings are several: anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, nonexudative conjunctivitis bilaterally, a strawberry tongue, an erythematous truncal rash, and edema of the hands and feet. Hmm. I need to think about what each of these points means.

First, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. I remember that this is often related to infections like T-cell lymphoma or lymphocele, which can cause lymphadenopathy. These are often advanced infections, maybe something like HIV or T-cell leukemia.

Nonexudative conjunctivitis bilaterally. That usually points to abscesses in the conjunctiva, like from T-cell lymphoma. The absence of exudate suggests no secretion, so it's likely infection.

Strawberry tongue is a common feature in children with T-cell lymphoma. The tongue may be enlarged and with yellowish or white scales, so that's a red flag.

Erythematous truncal rash. Truncal is the part of the tongue near the back. Erythematous means red, so maybe a T-cell lymphoma infection, which is usually characterized by such red patches.

Edema of hands and feet: This often points to infection, especially if it's a condition like T-cell lymphoma or lymphocele, which can cause edema.

So putting this together, it's likely T-cell lymphoma. Now, what's the treatment for T-cell lymphoma? I remember that for children, especially those younger than 12, they often get immunotherapy first. For adults, it's usually longer-term treatments.

T-cell lymphoma is a rare but serious condition, so the treatment is typically immunotherapy. The key here is the best approach to prevent complications.

Looking at the options: A is IV penicillin, which is for bacterial infections. B is oral amoxicillin, which is also for bacteria. C is oral aspirin, which is for pain or inflammation. D is oral ibuprofen, which is for pain, but often used in combination with other medications.

E is IV azithromycin, which is a common antibiotic for TB and HIV, but if it's T-cell lymphoma, maybe a different approach. F is IV corticosteroids, which are used for inflammation but in this case, it's from an infection.

G is IV prednisone, which is for inflammation but again, more like for when you don't have the infection.

H is IV immune globulin, which is a common first-line treatment for T-cell lymphoma in children.

I is oral isoniazid, which is used for HIV, but T-cell lymphoma is different.

J is IV vancomycin, which is for abscesses, but the question already points out that there's an abscess in the conjunctiva.

So the correct approach would be IV immune globulin. That's option H. Because for children, IV immunoglobulins are the standard first-line treatment for T-cell lymphoma. It's the most appropriate here to prevent complications since it's a common and serious condition.

The patient presents with T-cell lymphoma, a serious and rare condition. The correct treatment for children with T-cell lymphoma is typically immunotherapy. Among the options, the most appropriate is **IV immune globulin**, which is the standard first-line treatment for T-cell lymphoma in children. 

Answer: H
