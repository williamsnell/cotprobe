Okay, so I have this problem where I need to solve a system of two linear equations using Cramer's Rule. The equations are:

2x + 3y = 10  
4x + 4y = 12  

Hmm, I remember that Cramer's Rule involves determinants. Let me recall the steps. First, I need to write the system in matrix form, like Ax = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the vector of variables, and B is the constants vector.

So, the coefficient matrix A would be:

| 2  3 |
| 4  4 |

And the constants vector B is [10, 12]. The variables are x and y, so the solution for x and y will be x = D_x / D and y = D_y / D, where D is the determinant of A, D_x is the determinant formed by replacing the first column of A with B, and D_y is the determinant formed by replacing the second column of A with B.

Wait, let me make sure. Yes, Cramer's Rule says that each variable is the determinant of the matrix formed by replacing the corresponding column of A with B, divided by the determinant of A itself.

So first, let's compute D, the determinant of A. A is a 2x2 matrix, so the determinant is (2)(4) - (3)(4) = 8 - 12 = -4. So D = -4.

Now, let's compute D_x. For D_x, we replace the first column of A with the constants B. So the matrix becomes:

| 10  3 |
|12   4 |

The determinant is (10)(4) - (3)(12) = 40 - 36 = 4. So D_x is 4.

Similarly, for D_y, we replace the second column with B. The matrix becomes:

| 2  10 |
|4   12 |

Determinant is (2)(12) - (10)(4) = 24 - 40 = -16. So D_y is -16.

So now, x is D_x / D = 4 / (-4) = -1. And y is D_y / D = (-16)/(-4) = 4.

So the solution is x = -1, y = 4. Looking at the options, option B is [-1, 4]. That should be the correct answer.

The system of equations is solved using Cramer's Rule. The determinant of the coefficient matrix is -4, and the determinants for x and y are 4 and -16, respectively. Dividing these by -4 gives x = -1 and y = 4. The correct solution is option B.

Answer: B
