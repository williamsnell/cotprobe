Okay, so I've got this logic question about translating a statement into predicate logic. The question is: "Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian." The options are A through J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to break down the sentence. The main subject is "Abdul" and "Cleopatra." Both of them are being compared to being Egyptian. So, the predicate is "are Egyptian." 

In predicate logic, I think we represent "is" with a predicate, probably "E" since Egyptian is the property. So, the predicate would be something like "E*" where * is the noun phrase. But in this case, the predicate is "are Egyptian," so maybe I can use a predicate like "E_..." but perhaps we can use "E" as the predicate name. Alternatively, maybe the predicate is "E", and the individual is the subject.

Wait, but the sentence is about two people: Abdul and Cleopatra. So, maybe the predicate applies to both. So, the structure would be that for both individuals, the predicate holds. So, maybe something like "Ex ∧ Ey," but wait, what's the variable here? The predicate "E" is a unary predicate, meaning it takes one argument. So, the subjects Abdul and Cleopatra are two separate individuals, so we'd need to use two separate predicates applied to each.

Alternatively, perhaps the two people are being treated as a pair, but in predicate logic, each individual is considered separately unless specified otherwise. So, for each individual, we apply the predicate. So, the two predicates would be "Abdul is Egyptian" and "Cleopatra is Egyptian." So, in formal logic, that translates to two separate instances of the predicate applied to each individual.

But in the answer options, I see options like Ae, which is probably "Abdul is Egyptian," and similar. So, if I'm translating the statement, each of Abdul and Cleopatra must satisfy the predicate "are Egyptian." So, both of them must satisfy "E_," where _ is the property.

Wait, but in predicate logic, each individual is a subject. So, for each, the predicate is applied. So, "Abdul is Egyptian" is Ea (if Ea is the predicate for being Egyptian) or if "E" is the predicate name, it's Ea. Similarly, "Cleopatra is Egyptian" would be Ec. But wait, the options are like "Ae • Ec," which suggests both are true. 

Wait, the options are:

A: Ea • Ec — this would mean both are Egyptian. But the question is about them being Egyptian, which is in agreement.

Wait, the question is about them being Egyptian, so the correct translation would be that both individuals are Egyptian. So, in predicate logic, it would be "Ea" and "Ec" both being true. So, the conjunction would be Ea ∧ Ec. But looking at the options, option I is Ae • Ce, which is exactly that.

Wait, but another thought: Maybe the predicate is "E", and both are individuals. So, the correct way to write "Abdul is Egyptian and Cleopatra is Egyptian" would be (EAbdul) ∧ (ECleopatra). But in the options, I don't see EAbdul; instead, the options have Ea and Ec. So, Ea would represent "Abdul is Egyptian" and Ec would represent "Cleopatra is Egyptian." So, the conjunction would be Ea ∧ Ec.

Looking at the options, option I is Ae • Ce. So that would be "Abdul is Egyptian and Cleopatra is Egyptian," which matches the statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are using "E" as the predicate, so Ea and Ec would mean that both are Egyptian. So, the correct option is I.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A: Ea • Ec — both are Egyptian.

B: Ea ∨ c — Either is Egyptian.

C: Ex • Ey — Both are something else.

D: Ex • Ec — Both are Egyptian.

Wait, no: Ex and Ey are probably about something else, like maybe being a king or something else. So, C is not correct.

Option E: Ex ∨ Ey — Either is Egyptian.

Option F: Ea • c — Maybe "Abdul is Egyptian and Cleopatra is not Egyptian."

Option G: Ae ∨ Ce — Maybe "Abdul is Egyptian or Cleopatra is Egyptian," which doesn't necessarily mean both.

Option H: Ey • Ec — Both are something else, but that's not relevant.

Option I: Ae • Ce — Both are Egyptian, which is what we want.

Option J: Ea ∨ Ec — Either is Egyptian. But the question is about both being Egyptian.

So, the correct answer is I: Ae • Ce.

The correct translation is "Abdul is Egyptian and Cleopatra is Egyptian," which corresponds to the conjunction "Ae • Ce."
