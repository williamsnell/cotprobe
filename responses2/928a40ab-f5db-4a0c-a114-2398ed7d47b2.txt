Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spring-mass system with some damping and an external force. The question is asking me to find the mass m that makes the amplitude of the steady-state response as large as possible. Hmm, I remember that in these kinds of problems, the amplitude depends on the frequency of the external force and the system's natural frequency. 

Wait, let me think. The system's equation of motion should be modeled with a differential equation. The damping is due to a dashpot, which relates to viscous friction, so the damping coefficient is given as 0.25 lb·s/ft. Oh wait, no, wait. No, the damping constant, c, is given as 0.25 lb·s/ft. So that's the damping coefficient. 

The external force is 4 cos(2t) lb. So that's a harmonic force with amplitude 4, angular frequency 2. The mass is m, and I need to find m such that the amplitude is maximum. 

I remember that for a linear oscillator under a harmonic force, the amplitude of the steady-state response is given by A = F0/(mω² - ω0²)² + (c/(mω))², or something like that. Wait, maybe I should recall the formula correctly. Oh right, it's A = (F0 / sqrt((k - mω²)^2 + (cω)^2)) ) / (mω²).

Wait, no, I think the amplitude formula for a damped harmonic oscillator under a sinusoidal force is A = F0 / sqrt( (k - mω²)^2 + (cω)^2 ). Or wait, maybe it's (F0/(m*sqrt( (k/m - ω²)^2 + (c/(mω))^2 )) )) ?

Wait, I think the standard formula for the amplitude is A = F0 / ( sqrt( (k - mω²)^2 + (cω)^2 ) ). Because in the equation of motion, the amplitude depends on the square root of (k - mω²)^2 plus (cω)^2. Let me think again. The differential equation is m x'' + c x' + k x = F0 cos(ω t). The standard resonance occurs when the frequency ω matches the natural frequency ω0, but in this case, it's a forced response, and the amplitude is determined by the frequency response function.

The natural frequency ω0 is sqrt(k/m). The damped frequency is sqrt(ω0² - (c/(2m))² ), but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Wait, no, perhaps the amplitude is determined by the system's poles. Anyway, the formula I think is correct: A = F0 / sqrt( (k - mω²)^2 + (c ω)^2 ). 

But wait, another thought: sometimes, when the damping is present, the resonance occurs at ω = ω0, which is the natural frequency. Oh, but in this problem, the external force is at a specific ω, which is 2 rad/s. So I'm to find m such that the amplitude is maximum when the external force is applied at 2 rad/s. So the amplitude is maximum when the denominator in the A formula is minimized, because A = F0 / denominator. So, to maximize A, we need to minimize the denominator.

The denominator is sqrt( (k - mω²)^2 + (c ω)^2 ). So, the square root of the sum of two squares. The minimal value occurs when both terms are minimized. But since these are squared terms, the minimal value is when both terms are as small as possible. However, when m varies, the terms (k - m ω²) and (c ω) change. Hmm, but wait, k is a constant, because the spring constant isn't given. Oh wait, the problem says the mass is m, but the spring's weight is 8 lb. Wait, no, the system's spring constant k can be found from the initial condition when it's stretched 6 inches by a mass. But wait, the spring is stretched 6 inches by the mass. Wait, but the mass is m, and the spring is under a force of 8 lb, which is the weight of the mass. So, F = m g = 8 lb. So, m = 8 lb / g. But wait, the unit of mass in the English system is slugs. So, the gravitational acceleration g is 32 ft/s². Therefore, m = 8 / 32 = 0.25 slugs. So, m = 0.25 slugs. But wait, that's the mass. The problem says that the mass is replaced by m; wait, no, the question is about finding m for which the amplitude is maximum. Wait, hold on. The problem says: "the mass is replaced by a mass m..." So, the original mass is m (from the problem), but in the system, the mass is actually m, and the spring constant k is determined by the weight of the mass. Hmm, wait, the initial setup: a mass m is attached to the spring, which when stretched 6 inches, exerts a force of 8 lb. So, the spring constant k is found from Hooke's law: F = kx. The spring is stretched 6 inches, which is 0.5 feet. So, F = k x = 8 lb, so k = 8 lb / 0.5 ft = 16 lb/ft. So k = 16 lb/ft.

Wait, but the problem says that the mass is replaced by m. Oh, wait, no. Let me read again. The problem says: "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So, the question is asking for m (in slugs). So, the original mass is m, but in this context, when we replace it, we're seeking the new mass m for which the amplitude is maximum. So, the mass in the problem is actually the original mass m. Wait, but in the problem statement, the original mass is m, but wait, the problem says "the mass is replaced by a mass m." Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me restate the problem:

"A spring is stretched 6 inches by a mass that weighs 8 lb. The mass is attached to a dashpot with damping constant 0.25 lb·s/ft. The system is acted on by an external force of 4 cos(2t) lb. If the mass is replaced by a mass m, determine the value of m for which the amplitude of the steady-state response is maximum."

Wait, no, the wording may be that the mass is replaced by an equivalent mass m. Oh, perhaps the problem is that the original mass is m, but the given spring is stretched by a mass m, which gives a certain k and F. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to rephrase. The original mass is M, and when it's replaced by m, find m for which the amplitude is maximum. So, the problem is to find m such that the amplitude is maximum. But I'm not sure what the initial k is. Wait, the original mass was m, which is attached to the spring, which is stretched by 6 inches (0.5 ft) under the weight of m, which is 8 lb. So, F = m g = 8 lb, so m = 8 / 32 = 0.25 slugs. So, m is 0.25 slugs. But the problem is asking to replace the mass with m, so perhaps m is the new, unknown mass, and the initial mass is 0.25 slugs? Wait, that's a confusion. Let me clarify.

Wait, the problem says: "the mass is replaced by a mass m." So, the original mass is m (as given), and we're replacing it with a mass m, so I think that might be a typo. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the original mass is m, and when replaced, the new mass is m, and we're to find, for that m, the amplitude is maximum. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed.

So, let me restate everything:

Given a spring with k lb/ft, a mass m, and a dashpot with damping constant c = 0.25 lb·s/ft. The spring is stretched 6 inches (0.5 ft) by a mass m, which gives the equation F = m g = 8 lb. So, m = 8 / g. If g is 32 ft/s², m = 8 /32 = 0.25 slugs. Wait, but the problem says the mass is replaced by m, so perhaps we're looking for the new mass m in the equation that would maximize the amplitude. But I'm not sure how the problem is structured.

Wait, perhaps the question is, given that the original mass is m, but the spring's k is determined by the initial setup (m is the original mass, but the question is to find m such that when the mass is replaced by m, the amplitude is maximum). Hmm, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed.

So, the problem is: given a spring with k = 16 lb/ft (earlier calculation: F = kx => k = 8 lb / 0.5 ft = 16 lb/ft). The dashpot has c = 0.25 lb·s/ft. The external force is 4 cos(2t) lb. We need to find m (the new mass) that maximizes the amplitude of the steady-state response. So, the system's equation is m x'' + c x' + k x = F0 cos(ω t), where ω is 2 rad/s.

The amplitude A is given by F0 / sqrt( (k - m ω²)^2 + (c ω)^2 ). So, A = 4 / sqrt( (16 - m (2)^2)^2 + (0.25 * 2)^2 ) = 4 / sqrt( (16 -4m)^2 + (0.5)^2 ). We need to find m that maximizes A, which is equivalent to minimizing the denominator.

Wait, but the denominator is sqrt( (16 -4m)^2 + 0.25 ), so to minimize the denominator, we need to minimize the expression inside the square root. Let's denote D = (16 -4m)^2 + (0.25)^2. We can find the minimum of D with respect to m.

The term (16 -4m)^2 will be minimized when 16 -4m is as small as possible, which is when 16 -4m is zero, so when 4m =16 → m=4. So, the minimum occurs at m=4.

Wait, but wait, the denominator is sqrt(D), so the minimum of D is when (16 -4m)^2 is zero, so 16-4m=0 → m=4. So, when m=4, the denominator is sqrt(0 + 0.25) = 0.5, so A would be 4 / 0.5 = 8, which is maximum. So, the amplitude is maximum when m=4.

Wait, but the options are given as A through J, and the options include 4 slugs as option F. So, the correct answer would be F:4 slugs. But wait, let me check the earlier steps again.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the setup. Because when the mass is m, the natural frequency is ω0 = sqrt(k/m). But in this problem, the external force is at ω=2 rad/s. So, the amplitude is given by A = F0 / sqrt( (k - mω^2)^2 + (cω)^2 ). So, to maximize A, we need to minimize the denominator. The minimal value is when (k - m ω^2)^2 is zero. That happens when k = m ω^2 → m = k / ω^2. Substituting k=16, ω=2, m=16/(4) =4 slugs. So, the amplitude is maximum when m=4. So, option F.

Wait, but in the options, F is 4 slugs, and the options are:

A:6, B:1, C:3, D:7, E:2, F:4, G:8, H:5, I:2, J:10.

So, the correct answer is F:4 slugs. But wait, the original problem said the original mass was m, which is replaced by a new mass m. Hmm, that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find m such that when the mass is m, the amplitude is maximum. But in any case, the calculation shows that m=4 slugs gives the maximum amplitude. So, option F.

To determine the mass \( m \) for which the amplitude of the steady-state response is maximum, we analyze the given system. The system consists of a spring with spring constant \( k = 16 \, \text{lb/ft} \), a dashpot with damping coefficient \( c = 0.25 \, \text{lb·s/ft} \), and an external force \( F(t) = 4 \cos(2t) \, \text{lb} \). The amplitude of the steady-state response is given by:

\[
A = \frac{F_0}{\sqrt{(k - m\omega^2)^2 + (c\omega)^2}}
\]

where \( F_0 = 4 \, \text{lb} \), \( \omega = 2 \, \text{rad/s} \), \( k = 16 \, \text{lb/ft} \), and \( c = 0.25 \, \text{lb·s/ft} \). The amplitude \( A \) is maximized when the denominator \( \sqrt{(k - m\omega^2)^2 + (c\omega)^2} \) is minimized. This occurs when \( k - m\omega^2 = 0 \), which gives:

\[
m = \frac{k}{\omega^2} = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \, \text{slugs}.
\]

Thus, the amplitude is maximized when \( m = 4 \, \text{slugs} \), corresponding to option **F**.
