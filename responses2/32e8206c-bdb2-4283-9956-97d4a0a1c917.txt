Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. It says, "How long would it take a car, starting from rest and accelerating uniformly in a straight line at 5 m/s², to cover a distance of 200 m?" The options are A through J, each giving a different time.

Hmm, I remember that when an object starts from rest and accelerates uniformly, the distance covered is related to time and acceleration. I think the formula for distance under constant acceleration is something like s = ut + ½ a t². Since it's starting from rest, the initial velocity u is zero. So the formula simplifies to s = ½ a t².

Alright, let's plug in the numbers. The acceleration a is 5 m/s², and the distance s is 200 meters. So the equation becomes 200 = 0.5 * 5 * t². Let me calculate that step by step.

First, 0.5 *5 is 2.5. So 200 = 2.5 * t². To find t², I'll divide both sides by 2.5. That gives t² = 200 / 2.5. Let me compute that: 200 divided by 2.5. Well, 2.5 times 80 is 200, so t² is 80. Then t is the square root of 80. Let me calculate the square root of 80. Hmm, 80 is 16*5, so sqrt(80) is sqrt(16*5) which is 4*sqrt(5). What's sqrt(5)? Approximately 2.236. So 4 * 2.236 is about 8.944 seconds. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option D is 8.0 s, and E is 10.5 s. So my calculation gives about 8.944, which is closest to option D (8.0) and perhaps E (10.5), but not exactly. Oh wait, but maybe I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach could be using the kinematic equation. The correct formula is s = ut + ½ a t². Since u is zero, it's s = ½ a t². So yes, 200 = 2.5 t² → t²=80 → t≈8.944 s. So the closest is D, but wait, let me check the options again.

Wait the options are A:18, B:15.5, C:9, D:8, E:10.5, F:20, G:12, H:14, I:11.5, J:16.5.

So 8.94 seconds is about 8.94. The closest option is D (8.0) and H is 14, which is way off. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait 2.5 * t² =200 → t² = 80 → t=√80≈8.94 seconds. So the nearest option is D, 8.0 s. But wait, why isn't the answer H (14.0 s)? Because 14 squared is 196. 14^2=196, 14.0^2=196. 196 is less than 80? No, wait, 200 is larger than 196, so 14 would be less than the time we need. Wait, wait, no. Because t²=80, t=√80≈8.94, which is about 8.94 s. So the correct time is approximately 8.94 s, which is closest to 9 s. But none of the options are 9.0 s. Wait, looking at the options again, the closest is D (8.0 s) and C is 9.0 s. So which is closer?

The options provided are A:18, B:15.5, C:9, D:8, E:10.5, F:20, G:12, H:14, I:11.5, J:16.5.

So 8.94 is about 8.94, which is just 0.94 above 8.0 and 1.06 below 9.0. So between options C (9.0) and D (8.0), which is closer? Well, 8.94 is closer to 9.0 than to 8.0. But wait, option C is 9.0 s, and that's an exact option. So why is that not the correct answer? Because maybe I made a mistake. Let's see.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Wait, another approach: using the equation s= ut + ½ a t². Since u is zero, s= ½ a t². So s=200 = 0.5 *5 * t² → 200 = 2.5 t² → 80 = t² → t=√80. Which is about 8.94 s, same as before.

So the options don't have 8.94. The option closest is D (8.0 s) and C (9.0 s). But why is the correct answer not one of these? Maybe I should think about another formula.

Wait, another formula for distance when starting from rest is s= v t, but that's only when the final velocity is known. Alternatively, v² = u² + 2 a s. But that's not applicable here because I don't know the final velocity. So the first formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me compute 2.5 * 8^2. 8 squared is 64. 2.5 *64 is 160, which is less than 200. 8.94 squared is approx 8*8=64, 0.94^2= ~0.88, so 8.94²≈79.92, which is about 80. So t is about 8.94 s. So the correct time is approximately 8.94 s. So the closest option is D (8.0 s) or C (9.0 s). Or perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, looking back. What if I forgot to account for something? Oh, another thought: sometimes, when dealing with acceleration, the time is in seconds, and distance in meters, perhaps the formula is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should double-check the formula. Let me think again. s = ½ a t² → correct. So perhaps the problem is designed to have a time of 10.5 s, but that's not correct.

Wait, wait, maybe I did a miscalculation. Let me compute t² = 200/(0.5 *5) → 200/(2.5) =80. So t=√80≈8.944 s. So about 8.94 s. The options are A:18, B:15.5, C:9, D:8, E:10.5, F:20, G:12, H:14, I:11.5, J:16.5.

So the correct time is approximately 8.94 s, which is closest to option D (8.0 s), but perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I should check the time when using s = ut + ½ a t².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of t². Let me recalculate t squared as 80. What's sqrt(80)?

Well, sqrt(81)=9, so sqrt(80)= 8.94427. So 8.94427 is approximately 8.944 s.

So the correct time is about 8.94 s. Looking at the options, which one is closest? Option D is 8.0, and C is 9.0, but 8.94 is closer to 9.0 than to 8.0. So the answer would be C, but wait, no, because 8.94 is approximately 8.94, which is 0.94 away from 8.0 and 1.06 away from 9.0. So 8.0 is closer. But wait, the options don't have exactly 8.94. So the correct answer is D (8.0 s), because the next option is C (9.0), but 8.94 is closer to 9 than to 8.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The problem gives me the options. So the correct time is approximately 8.94 s. The options are:

A:18.0

B:15.5

C:9.0

D:8.0

E:10.5

F:20.0

G:12.0

H:14.0

I:11.5

J:16.5

So the closest is D (8.0) and C (9.0). But 8.94 is exactly between 8.9 and 8.944. So which is it? Well, the options are in whole numbers. So 8.94 is about 8.94, which is closer to 9.0 than to 8.0. So the correct answer would be option C (9.0 s). Wait, but wait, no. Because 8.94 is closer to 9.0 than to 8.0. So the correct time is approximately 8.94 s, which is about 8.94. So the closest given option is C (9.0 s). But another thought: maybe I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using another formula. Let's see: the average velocity when starting from rest is v_avg = (u + v)/2. Since u is zero, v_avg = v/2. And the average velocity is also equal to s/t. So s/t = (v/2). But v = a t. So substituting, s/t = (a t)/2. Multiply both sides by t: s = (a t²)/2. Which is the same as the first formula. So no, that doesn't change anything.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is supposed to be option C (9.0 s), but according to the calculation, it's 8.94 s. But that's not one of the options. Wait, but looking at the options again, option D is 8.0 s, which is 8 seconds, but our calculation is 8.94 s. So perhaps I should recheck the problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me re-express the formula. When starting from rest, the displacement under constant acceleration is s = (1/2) a t². So plugging in the values: 200 = (1/2) *5 * t² → 200 = 2.5 t² → t² = 80 → t= sqrt(80) ≈ 8.944 s.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the acceleration is in m/s², but maybe the units are in some other context, but the question says 5 m/s². So that shouldn't be a problem.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the time to cover 200 meters, but to reach a certain distance, but that's what I've been calculating. So yes, that seems correct.

Wait, looking for any possible miscalculations. 200 divided by 2.5 is 80. Square root of 80 is approximately 8.944 seconds. So the correct answer is approximately 8.94 seconds. Since the options don't have 8.94, the closest is D (8.0 s) and C (9.0 s). 8.94 is closer to 9.0 s. So the correct answer would be option C, 9.0 s. But wait, that's not what I thought earlier. So why is the option D and C the possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the problem meant to ask for a different distance, but let's go back. The question states 200 m. So the correct time is about 8.94 s. But the options don't have that. So the intended correct answer is option C, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the formula. Let me think about the options. Let's see what time would lead to 200 m.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can use the formula for distance covered in equal time intervals. But that might not help here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the average velocity. The average velocity would be (0 + v)/2, where v is the final velocity. Then, the average velocity is s/t. So s/t = (v/2). But v = a t, so s/t = (a t) / 2 → s = (a t²)/2. So same as before.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the equation v² = u² + 2 a s. But since u is zero, it's v² = 2 a s. But that gives v = sqrt(2 a s) → sqrt(2 *5 * 200) → sqrt(2000) ≈44.721 m/s. But that's not needed for the time, so I think that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick. Because when starting from rest, the time to cover 200 m would be sqrt(2 s / a), which is what I did. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should calculate t as sqrt(200/(5/2)) → wait, no, because a is 5 m/s², so ½ a is 2.5, so 200 / 2.5 =80, t= sqrt(80) as before.

So after careful thought, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 9.0 s, but wait that's not correct. Because 8.94 is closer to 9 than to 8, so the correct answer should be 9.0 s, which is option C. But wait, the options don't have 8.94, so perhaps the intended correct answer is option C (9.0 s). But I'm a bit confused because 8.94 is closer to 9.0 than to 8.0.

Wait, but the options don't have 8.94, so the closest available is 9.0 s. So the answer should be option C. But I'm a bit uncertain because it's not exactly one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of sqrt(80). Let me compute it more accurately. 8^2 is 64, 9^2 is 81. 80 is between 64 and 81. 80 = 8^2 + 16 (since 8^2=64, 80-64=16). So 8.94^2 is approximately 80.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a calculator-like approach. Let me think: 8.94 squared is (8.94)^2. 8.94 * 8.94 = ?

Let me compute:

8 * 8 = 64

8 * 0.94 = 7.52 → but wait, no, perhaps it's better to calculate 8.94 *8.94:

First, 8 *8 =64.

8 *0.94 = 7.52

0.94 *8=7.52

0.94 *0.94 = approx 0.8836.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute it as (8 + 0.94)^2 = 8^2 + 2*8*0.94 + 0.94^2.

So, 64 + 2*(8 * 0.94) + 0.8836.

2*8=16; 0.94 *16=15.04.

So 64 +15.04=79.04, plus 0.8836 → 79.9236. So 8.94^2≈79.92, which is about 80.

So t is approximately 8.94 s. So the correct answer is approximately 8.94 s, which is closest to 9.0 s. But perhaps I should check whether any of the options match sqrt(80). Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should see if any of the options (like 8.0 or 9.0) would give s =200 m when plugged into the formula. Let's test option C (9.0 s):

s = 0.5 *5 * (9)^2 → 2.5 *81 → 202.5 m. Oh, that's more than 200 m. So option C would give s=202.5 m, which is 2.5 meters over the required 200 m. So option C is for 202.5 m, which is more than 200. So the correct time should be less than 9.0 s to get exactly 200 m. So the correct time is about 8.94 s, which is about 8.94 s, not 9.0 s. So perhaps the intended correct answer was 9.0 s, but the options have D as 8.0 s, which is closer to the correct time of 8.94 s.

Wait a second, but no option is exactly 8.94 s. So perhaps the correct answer is closest to 9.0 s, which is option C. But why are the other options given? Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me check again. If the acceleration is a, then s = (1/2) a t². So for a=5, s=2.5 t². So 200 =2.5 t² → t²=80 → t= sqrt(80)= 8.944 seconds.

So the correct time is approximately 8.94 s, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option C (9.0 s), but wait, that's not correct. Because 8.94 is closer to 9.0 than to 8.0. But perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the formula. Let me try again: s=200 m. a=5 m/s². So s=0.5 * a * t² → 200=0.5 *5 *t² → 200=2.5 t² → t²= 200/2.5=80 → t= sqrt(80)=8.944 seconds.

Wait, perhaps I should see if any of the options (like 8.0 s) would give s=200 m. Let's compute for option D (8.0 s): s=0.5 *5 *8² → 0.5 *5 *64 → 0.5 *5=2.5 → 2.5 *64=160 m. Which is 160 m, not 200 m. So option D is for 160 m, which is less than 200. Option E (10.5 s): s=0.5 *5 * (10.5)^2 → 0.5 *5 * (110.25) → 2.5 *110.25=275.625 m. So E is 275.6 m, which is more than 200.

So the correct time is between 8.0 s and 10.5 s. But how to find between which options? Let's see, the time we calculated is 8.94 s, which is between 8.0 and 10.5 s. So the correct answer would be option C (9.0 s) if the question expects that, but that's not correct because 8.94 is closer to 9.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check again all the steps once more.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is a trick because the acceleration is 5 m/s², but it's only moving for a certain time, but perhaps the initial velocity is not zero. No, the question says starting from rest. So no, the initial velocity is zero.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem using another formula. Let me think about the formula for distance when acceleration is involved and initial velocity is not zero. But in this case, initial velocity is zero.

So I think my initial approach is correct. So the correct time is approximately 8.94 s, which is between 8.0 s and 10.5 s. So the correct answer would be option C (9.0 s) if the problem expects that, but according to the correct calculation, it's 8.94 s. So perhaps the intended correct answer is option C (9.0 s), as the nearest option.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The correct calculation is t=sqrt(80)=8.944 s. So the closest option is 9.0 s. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but the options list includes option D (8.0 s), which is the nearest option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider the formula without calculating the time, but perhaps an error exists. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the problem is 200 meters, but I think I correctly calculated. So perhaps the correct answer is option C (9.0 s). Or perhaps the problem expects option D (8.0 s) because 8.0 is the closest. So I'm a bit torn.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the units. Let me recheck the formula: s = ½ a t². All units are in meters and seconds. So a is 5 m/s², which is correct. So the formula is correct. So the correct time is sqrt(80) ≈8.94 s, which is not an option. So the intended correct answer is option C (9.0 s), but that's incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think about another approach. Let me use the formula s = v t, where v is the final velocity. But we have v² = 2 a s. So v = sqrt(2 a s). So s = v t → t = s / v. But v = sqrt(2 a s), so t = s / sqrt(2 a s) = sqrt(s/(2 a)).

Wait, this gives t = sqrt(s/(2 a)).

So for s=200 m and a=5 m/s², t = sqrt(200/(2*5)) = sqrt(200/10) = sqrt(20) = approx 4.472 seconds.

Wait, that can't be right because if you plug into the formula, s= ½ a t² → 200 = ½ *5 * t² → 200 = 2.5 t² → t²=80 → t=8.94 s.

But according to this approach, I'm getting a different answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula s= v t, but in this case, v is the final velocity, but that's not the case. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the initial velocity is zero, and the final velocity is v, then s = v t, but v = a t. So substituting, s = a t². So t = sqrt(s/a). So for s=200 m, a=5 m/s², t= sqrt(200/5) = sqrt(40) ≈6.324 s.

Wait, that's a different answer. So which approach is correct? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the first step and reevaluate. Let me consider s = ½ a t². For a=5, s=2.5 t². So 200 = 2.5 t² → t²=80 → t=8.944 s.

So that's correct. But according to another approach, I'm getting t= sqrt(s/a) = sqrt(40)=6.324 s. Which is incorrect.

So perhaps the mistake is in the second approach. Let me see why.

Wait, in the second approach, I considered s= v t, and v = a t. So substituting, s = a t². So t²= s/a → t= sqrt(s/a). But that's incorrect because s= v t, and v= a t → s= a t². So the correct approach is to use s= a t². So the other approach is incorrect.

So the correct formula is s= a t²/2 → s= ½ a t².

So that's correct. So the correct time is approximately 8.94 s, which is not an option. So the intended correct answer is option C (9.0 s), but according to the correct calculation, it's 8.94 s.

Wait, perhaps the problem is 200 meters, but I think I correctly calculated. So perhaps the correct answer is option C (9.0 s). Or perhaps the problem expects option D (8.0 s) because 8.0 is the closest.

Wait, but I'm getting 8.94 s, which is closer to 9.0 than 8.0. So perhaps the correct answer is option C (9.0 s). But in reality, the correct answer isn't among the options, which is an issue.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem is a 200 m distance, but perhaps I should calculate the time for 200 m, but using another formula. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of another formula, but I think I'm correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should think of the formula s = ut + (1/2) a t². Since u is zero, it's s = (1/2) a t². So that's correct.

So, in conclusion, I think the correct answer is approximately 8.94 s, which is closer to 9.0 than to 8.0. So the correct answer should be option C (9.0 s). However, since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Let me think of the problem as a car accelerating from rest, covering 200 meters, and find the time taken. So, according to the formula, the time is sqrt(200 / ( (1/2)*5 )) = sqrt(200 / 2.5 ) = sqrt(80) ≈8.94 s. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option D (8.0 s), but according to the calculation, that's not correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option C (9.0 s).

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the problem in terms of how the time changes. Let me think that when the acceleration is 5 m/s², then the time to cover 200 m is sqrt(200 / (0.5 *5))=sqrt(80)=8.94 s. So that's correct.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer is approximately 8.94 seconds, which would correspond to option C (9.0 s). However, since this is not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D (8.0 s), but that's incorrect. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, but I think I should proceed with the correct answer being option C (9.0 s).
</think>

The correct time to cover 200 meters with an acceleration of 5 m/s² is approximately 8.94 seconds. Since this is not among the provided options, the closest available option is **C (9.0 s)**, though it's not mathematically accurate.

ANSWER: C
