Okay, so I need to find the quotient of 2.16 divided by 0.06. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my division, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that dividing decimals can sometimes be tricky. Maybe I can make the numbers easier to handle by eliminating the decimals. I've heard that multiplying both numbers by 100 (which is 10 squared) can help shift the decimal places two places to the right. Let me try that.

So, if I multiply both 2.16 and 0.06 by 100, that would give me 216 ÷ 6. Wait, let me check that. 2.16 times 100 is indeed 216, and 0.06 times 100 is 6. So now the problem is 216 divided by 6. That seems simpler.

Now, doing 216 ÷ 6. Let me think about how that works. I know that 6 times 30 is 180. If I subtract that from 216, I get 36. Then, 6 times 6 is 36, so adding that to 30 gives me 36. So 30 + 6 is 36, but wait, 36 is 36, and 6 times 36 is 216? Wait, no, I think I made a mistake there.

Wait, maybe I should break it down differently. Let's see: 6 into 21 is 3 (since 6*3=18). Subtract 18 from 21, you get 3. Bring down the 6, making it 36. 6 into 36 is 6. So total is 36. So 216 ÷ 6 equals 36. So the quotient is 36.

Looking back at the options: option G is 3.6, and option H is 36. Wait, I thought the answer was 36, right? But I'm confused because I thought the answer might be 36, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might mix up the numbers.

Wait, wait, no. Let me go back. Oh, wait, I think I got it wrong. Oh no, wait! I think I mixed up something. Let me redo the division.

Wait, 6 into 21: 6*3=18, so 3 times. Subtract 18 from 21, you get 3. Bring down the 6, making it 36. 6 into 36 is 6. So 3 and 6, making 36. So yes, 216 ÷ 6 is 36. So the quotient is 36. So looking at the options, option H is 36.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think if I made any miscalculations earlier. Oh, wait, perhaps I confused the original numbers. Let me check: 2.16 ÷ 0.06. Wait, 0.06 is a smaller number than 2.16, so the result should be larger than 1. So the quotient can't be 360, which is option A. Option G is 3.6, which is smaller than 36. So that's not right. So the correct answer should be 36, which is option H.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer might be 36, but I'm trying to make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should try another approach to verify.

Another way is to think about how much smaller 0.06 is compared to 1. Let's see, 0.06 is 1/16.666... or approximately 1/6.666. So 1 divided by 0.06 is about 16.666. But that's not directly helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps I can use fractions.

2.16 can be written as 216/100, and 0.06 is 6/100. So dividing these two fractions: (216/100) ÷ (6/100) = (216/100) * (100/6) = 216/6 = 36. Yep, same result. So that confirms it's 36. So the correct answer is H:36.
</think>

To find the quotient of 2.16 ÷ 0.06, we can simplify the problem by eliminating the decimals. Multiply both numbers by 100, resulting in 216 ÷ 6. Performing the division gives 36.

Answer: H:36
