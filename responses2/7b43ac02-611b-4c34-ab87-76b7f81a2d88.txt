Okay, so I have this question here about calculating the molecular weight of a sugar solution. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. 

So the problem says that a sugar solution was made by dissolving 9.0 grams of sugar in 500 grams of water. The temperature is 27°C, and the osmotic pressure is 2.46 atm. I need to find the molecular weight of the sugar. The options are given from A to J, but I'll work it out.

Wait, osmotic pressure... I remember the formula for osmotic pressure is π = (nRT)/V, but wait no, wait. Oh right, the general formula for osmotic pressure is π = (nRT)/V, but wait, wait. Or is it π = (nRT)/(V) but wait, I think it's π = (nRT) / (V) but actually, wait, maybe it's π = (nRT) / (V) but that's for a solution. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy.

Wait another way: I think the formula for osmotic pressure is π = (MRT), where M is the molarity. Oh wait, wait, let me get that right. Molarity is moles per liter. So if you have π equal to MRT, then M would be π/(RT). But wait, wait, what units are we using here?

Right, but wait—I might be mixing this up with the formula for vapor pressure. Oh right, for an ideal solution, the osmotic pressure π is equal to MRT, where M is the molarity, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. So I can use that formula.

So, let me write down what I know:

Mass of sugar = 9.0 g
Mass of water = 500 g (so total solution is 509 g)
Temperature, T = 27°C, which is 300 K (since 27+273.15=300.15, approx 300 K)
Osmotic pressure, π = 2.46 atm
What's the molarity (M)?

But wait, the formula is π = MRT. So we can solve for M.

M = π / (R*T)

What's R? The gas constant. I remember that R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when pressure is in atm and volume in liters.

Wait, so let's plug in the numbers.

M = (2.46 atm) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 300 K)

Wait, but wait: the units. M is mol/L. So let's compute that.

Compute denominator: 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63

So M = 2.46 / 24.63 ≈ 0.1 mol/L.

Wait, wait, 2.46 divided by 24.63 is approximately 0.1 mol/L. So M is about 0.1 M.

Wait, okay. So Molarity is 0.1 mol/L.

But wait, Molarity is moles per liter. So if the solution volume is V liters, then moles = M * V. So, let's find the moles of sugar.

M = 0.1 mol/L, so moles = 0.1 mol/L * V.

But wait, the volume of the solution is more than the mass of water because sugar has volume. Hmm, but wait, if I take V as the volume of the solution, which is 509 grams. But wait, the density of water is about 1 g/mL, so 500g water is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Then 509 g is about 509 mL, which is 0.509 L, approximately.

But perhaps, wait, for dilute solutions, the volume of the solution is approximately the same as the volume of the solvent. Because the solute (sugar) is much less in amount. So maybe I can take the solution volume as approximately the mass of water, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the total volume accurately.

Wait, another approach: the solution's mass is 509 grams. I can find the volume using the density of the solution. But the density of the solution is roughly (mass)/(volume), but without knowing the density, that's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps we can proceed without worrying about the exact volume—maybe the concentration is given with a certain volume, but since it's a solution, perhaps the volume is taken as the volume of water, which is 500 mL. Wait, but 509 grams is 509 mL if density is ~1 g/mL, so that would give a solution volume of about 509 mL, or 0.509 L.

Wait, but 509 grams is 509 mL (if solution's density is about 1.0 g/mL). So assuming solution is dilute, solution volume is about 0.509 L.

So, moles of sugar is M * V = 0.1 mol/L * 0.509 L = 0.0509 mol.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the volume precisely. Let me calculate the solution's volume.

The solution's mass is 509 grams. Let's find its volume. The density of the solution is (mass) / (volume). But without knowing the density, perhaps I can't compute this accurately. Alternatively, perhaps the solution's density is considered approximately 1 g/mL, so the volume is 509 mL = 0.509 L.

So, using that, moles = M * V.

So, M is 0.1 mol/L, so 0.1 * 0.509 = 0.0509 mol.

So, the moles of sugar is approximately 0.0509 mol.

Wait, but wait, let's double-check the calculation of M.

M is π/(R T). Let's plug in the numbers again.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), correct.

T is 300 K.

So R * T = 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63.

So M = 2.46 / 24.63 = about 0.1 mol/L.

Yes.

So, moles of sugar = M * V (in liters).

Assuming the solution's volume is 0.509 L, then 0.1 * 0.509 = 0.0509 moles.

Wait, but wait, the mass of the sugar is 9.0 grams, and the molar mass is Mw.

So, moles = mass / Mw.

Here, mass is 9.0 g.

So, 9.0 / Mw = 0.0509.

So solving for Mw: Mw = 9.0 / 0.0509 ≈ let's compute that.

9.0 divided by 0.0509. Let me compute 9 / 0.0509.

0.0509 is approximately 0.05. 9 / 0.05 is 180. But let's compute it accurately.

0.0509 * 179 ≈ 9.0011. So 0.0509 * 179 ≈ 9.

Wait, 0.0509 * 179 = ?

179 * 0.05 = 8.95. 179 * 0.0009 = 0.1611. So total about 8.95 + 0.1611 = 9.1111. Hmm, that's a bit more than 9.0.

Wait, perhaps 179 is a bit too high. Let me compute 9 / 0.0509:

9000 / 50.9 ≈ ?

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me calculate 9 ÷ 0.0509.

Let me write it as 9 / 0.0509 = (9 * 1000) / 50.9 = 9000 / 50.9 ≈ let's compute that.

50.9 * 176 = 50.9 * 170 = 8653; 50.9 *6=305.4 → total 8958.4. That's more than 9000. So 176 *50.9= 8958.4. But 9000 is 41.6 more than that.

So 41.6 /50.9 ≈ 0.820.

So 176 + 0.820 ≈ 176.82 → 176.82.

So Mw is approximately 176.8 g/mol. Looking at the options, option G is 360, D is 210, H is 90, etc. Hmm, none of the options are around 176. Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in any step.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the solution's volume is 0.509 L. Because if the solution is 509 grams, and the density is (mass )/(volume ), but if the density is higher than 1 g/mL, the volume will be less than 509 mL. But without knowing the solution’s density, I can’t calculate the volume accurately. So perhaps that approach is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for osmotic pressure, but perhaps using molality instead. No, wait, in this case, the solution is dilute, so the difference between molarity and molality is negligible. But wait, in this problem, the question might have considered the solution as being based on the mass of the solvent, but perhaps the correct formula is using the density of the solution.

Wait, but the problem gives the mass of water as 500 g, so perhaps the solution's mass is 509 g, but the volume is approximately 509 mL (if density is about 1 g/mL, which is the case for water). So we can proceed with that.

Wait, but our calculation gives Mw ≈176, but the options don't have that. The options are in the 90s up to 360, with 120, 150, 200, etc.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula for osmotic pressure in terms of molality.

Wait, wait, another thought. The formula I used was π = MRT, which is for molarity, but if the solution is more concentrated, that formula may not be accurate. But given the options, perhaps I made a mistake in using molarity.

Wait, let me think. Another approach: the formula for osmotic pressure is π = (i MRT), but in this case, the solute is a sugar, and it's a nonelectrolyte (since sugar is a simple sugar, I think it's a molecular compound, not a salt). So i is 1. So no problem there.

Wait, but another formula I recall is π = (n/V) RT, where n is moles of solute, V is the volume of the solution. Wait, but that's the same as MRT, because n/V is M.

Wait, so that approach should be correct.

Hmm, so why is the answer not matching any of the options? Let's recheck the calculations.

Wait, let me recompute the molarity.

M = π / (RT) = (2.46 atm) / (0.0821 * 300)

Compute 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63, so 2.46 /24.63 ≈ 0.1.

M = 0.1 mol/L.

Then, moles of sugar = M * V.

But what's V? The solution's volume. Since the mass of the solution is 509 g, and assuming density is about 1 g/mL, V is 509 mL, which is 0.509 L.

So 0.1 mol/L * 0.509 L = 0.0509 mol.

Molar mass Mw = mass (g) / moles =9.0 g / 0.0509 mol ≈ 176.6 g/mol.

But wait, none of the options match that. The closest are option G (360) and option D (210). Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the volume accurately. Let me try another approach.

The solution's mass is 509 g. The solute's mass is 9.0 g. So the solvent is 500 g.

But wait, if we take the solution's volume as the volume of the solvent (500 mL), then:

Molarity = 0.1 mol/L.

Then, moles = 0.1 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.

So Mw = 9.0g / 0.05 mol = 180 g/mol.

That's option A. Hmm, but earlier I had 176, which is close to 180.

Wait, but wait, why would the answer be 180? Let me make sure.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the solution's volume is 500 mL. Because if the solution is more dilute, the actual volume would be slightly larger than 500 mL. So perhaps the volume is 509 mL, which is 0.509 L.

But let's compute with 0.509 L.

Moles = 0.1 * 0.509 =0.0509.

Mw =9.0 /0.0509 ≈ 176 g/mol.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula used is π = (n/V) RT, but maybe I should be using the solution's density. Let me try that.

Another approach is to find the density of the solution. Since the solution's mass is 509 g, and the volume is V. So, density = 509 g / V (in liters) → grams per liter.

But without knowing the density, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the formula can be written as π = (m/Mw) RT, where m is mass of sugar, Mw is molar mass.

Wait, wait, let me think: π = (n/V) RT. n is mass/Mw.

So, π = (m/(Mw)) / V * RT.

So, π = (m RT)/(Mw V).

Rearranged, Mw = (m RT V) / (π V) → wait, perhaps not, perhaps I need to rearrange correctly.

Wait, π = (n/V) RT → n = (π V)/(RT). So, n = (m/Mw) = (π V)/(RT).

So, m = (π V RT)/(Mw).

Rearranged, Mw = (π V RT)/m.

But I don't know V, the volume. So perhaps I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps using the density of the solution. Let me denote the density as d (g/cm³) = mass (g) / volume (cm³) = mass (g) / (volume in mL).

So, mass is 509 g, so volume is 509 mL = 0.509 L = 509 cm³. So density d = 509 g / 509 cm³ = 1.0 g/cm³.

Wait, so density is 1.0 g/cm³. So the solution's volume is 509 cm³, same as the mass.

So, back to Mw.

We have:

Mw = (m RT V) / (π V) → Wait, no, let's rederive this.

We have: Mw = (m / V) * (RT / π) * (1/(something)).

Wait, perhaps I should write:

From π = (n/V) RT → n = (π V)/(RT)

But n = m/Mw → m/Mw = (π V)/(RT)

Rearranged: Mw = (m RT)/(π V)

But I don't have V, the volume of the solution.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to think differently.

Wait, I know that the solution's mass is 509g, and the mass of the solute is 9g. So the mass of the solvent is 500g. So the solution's density is 509 g / 500 mL = 1.018 g/mL. So approximately 1.02 g/mL.

So, density ρ = mass / volume → volume = mass / density.

Mass of solution is 509 g, density is 1.02 g/mL → volume = 509 /1.02 ≈ 498.039 mL → approximately 0.498 L.

So, V is about 0.498 L.

Now, Mw = (m RT)/(π V)

Plugging in the numbers:

m =9.0 g

R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)

T=300 K

π=2.46 atm

V=0.498 L

Compute numerator: 9 * 0.0821 * 300 = 9 * 24.63 = 221.67.

Denominator: 2.46 * 0.498 ≈ 1.220.

So Mw = 221.67 / 1.220 ≈ 181.6 g/mol.

Hmm, that's approximately 180, which is option A. But wait, earlier I thought the solution's volume is 509 mL, which gave a lower Mw. But when I consider the density of the solution as 1.02 g/mL, the volume becomes approximately 0.498 L.

So with V=0.498 L, Mw ≈ 181.6 g/mol → about 180, which is option A.

But wait, let me think again. The problem is about a sugar solution. The solution's mass is 509 g, but the density depends on the solute. If the solute is a sugar (which is a non-electrolyte, so the density doesn't change much), but in this case, the solvent's density is about 1.0 g/mL, so the solution's density is about 1.02 g/mL. So the solution's volume is 509 mL / 1.02 g/mL ≈ 500 mL.

Wait, wait, no. 509 mL divided by 1.02 g/mL is about 509 /1.02 ≈ 498 mL, which is 0.498 L. So that's correct.

So the volume is approximately 0.498 L, leading to Mw = 181.6 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option A is 180, which is very close. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but the options include D as 210, which is double of 105. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me consider that the solution's volume is 509 mL, which is 0.509 L.

So Mw = (9.0 g) / (0.1 mol/L * 0.509 L) = 9.0 / 0.0509 ≈ 176.6 g/mol.

Again, this doesn't match any option.

Wait, the options are: A)180, B)340, C)150, D)210, E)300.

Hmm, so the calculation gives around 176, which is close to 180, which is option A. But why is option D 210 present?

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for osmotic pressure in terms of molality. So, π = (i mRT), where m is molality.

But if the solution is dilute, the difference between molality and molarity is negligible. So, using molarity and assuming that the solution is dilute.

Wait, but in that case, Mw would be 9.0 g / 0.1 mol = 90 g/mol. Which is not an option.

Wait, but perhaps if the solution is more concentrated, then the formula would give a higher Mw. But in this case, the solution is dilute.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of molarity and the solution's volume. But I'm not seeing any mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is A)180. Let me check that.

Wait, if Mw is 180, then moles of sugar would be 9.0 / 180 = 0.05 moles.

Molarity is 0.05 mol / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.5 M.

But in our calculation, Molarity was 0.1 M. Hmm, so why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Molarity.

Wait, let me recompute Molarity.

Molarity = π/(RT) = 2.46/(0.0821 *300) → 2.46/(24.63) ≈ 0.1 M.

Yes, that's correct. So, Molarity is 0.1 M.

So, if M = 0.1 M, and V is 0.5 L, then moles = 0.05.

So, Mw =9.0 /0.05=180 g/mol.

Ah! So that's correct. So the correct answer is option A) 180.

Wait, but in the previous approach, I assumed that the solution's volume is 500 mL, but the correct approach is to use the solution's mass and density to find the volume.

So, this is the correct approach: calculate the density of the solution, then compute the volume.

So, in the solution, mass=509g, density=509 g /500 mL =1.018 g/mL.

So, volume is 509 g /1.018 g/mL ≈ 501 mL → 0.501 L.

So, moles of sugar = Molarity * volume.

Molarity was 0.1 M, volume=0.501 L.

Moles =0.1 * 0.501= 0.0501 mol.

So, Mw=9.0 /0.0501≈ 179.35 g/mol, which is approximately 180 g/mol.

So, the correct answer is A)180.
</think>

To determine the molar mass of the sugar, we use the osmotic pressure formula:

\[
\pi = MRT
\]

where:
- \(\pi = 2.46 \, \text{atm}\),
- \(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\),
- \(T = 300 \, \text{K}\),
- \(M\) is the molarity of the solution.

### Step 1: Calculate the Molarity (\(M\))
\[
M = \frac{\pi}{RT} = \frac{2.46}{0.0821 \times 300} = \frac{2.46}{24.63} \approx 0.1 \, \text{mol/L}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Moles of Sugar
The moles of sugar are given by:
\[
\text{Moles of sugar} = M \times V,
\]
where \(V\) is the volume of the solution in liters. The total mass of the solution is 509 g, and the mass of the solvent (water) is 500 g. Using the density of the solution (\(\rho = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}\)), we calculate the volume:
\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Density}} = \frac{509 \, \text{g}}{1.018 \, \text{g/mL}} \approx 501 \, \text{mL} = 0.501 \, \text{L}.
\]
Now, calculate the moles of sugar:
\[
\text{Moles of sugar} = 0.1 \, \text{mol/L} \times 0.501 \, \text{L} \approx 0.0501 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Molar Mass
The molar mass (\(M_w\)) is given by:
\[
M_w = \frac{\text{Mass of sugar}}{\text{Moles of sugar}} = \frac{9.0 \, \text{g}}{0.0501 \, \text{mol}} \approx 179.35 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]
This value is closest to 180 g/mol.

### Final Answer
The molar mass of the sugar is **180 g/mol**, which corresponds to option **A**.

ANSWER: A
