Okay, so I have this physics problem here about resistivity and temperature. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. Let's see, the question says the copper coil has a resistance of 100 ohms at 20°C. They want to know what the resistance is at 50°C. Oh right, the temperature coefficient of resistivity for copper is given as 0.0038 ohm per ohm per degree Celsius. 

Wait, I remember that the formula for the change in resistance with temperature is ΔR = R0 * α * ΔT. Oh right, where R0 is the initial resistance, α is the temperature coefficient, and ΔT is the change in temperature. So, R at a higher temperature is R0 multiplied by (1 + α*ΔT), or maybe R = R0 (1 + αΔT).

So let's plug in the numbers. R0 is 100 ohms. The temperature goes from 20°C to 50°C, so ΔT is 50 - 20 = 30 degrees. The α is 0.0038 ohm per ohm per degree.

Wait, so R = R0 * (1 + α * ΔT). Let's compute that. 1 + (0.0038 * 30) is 1 + (0.114) = 1.114. So 100 * 1.114 is 111.4 ohms, approximately 111 ohms. Looking at the options, option H is 111 ohms. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula.

Wait, another formula I recall is R = R0 [1 + α (T - T0)], where T is the new temperature and T0 is the reference. So yeah, that's correct. So with T0=20, T=50, ΔT=30. 0.0038 * 30=0.114. So 100 * 1.114=111.4 which is 111. So option H is 111 ohms. But wait, looking at the options, I see other options. Let me double-check the options:

Options:
A: 120 
B: 125 
C:100 
D:105 
E:140 
F:150 
G:130 
H:111 
I:90 
J:115.

So H is 111, which matches our calculation. But wait, another thought: sometimes the formula is written as R = R0 (1 + α ΔT) where α is given in per °C. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, wait a second. Did I convert the temperatures correctly? 50-20 is 30, correct. So 0.0038 *30=0.114. So adding 0.114 to 1 makes it 1.114. 100 * 1.114 is 111.4 ohms. So 111 ohms, which is H. But wait, looking at the options, option H is 111 ohms. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait the options:

Option H is 111 ohms. So the correct answer is H. But wait, I'm looking back at the problem statement. Oh wait, the problem says "the resistance of 100 ohms at 20°C." So at 50°C, it's 100 * (1 + 0.0038 *30). Let me recompute that.

0.0038 *30=0.114. So 1.114. 100 * 1.114 is 111.4. So approximately 111 ohms. So option H is 111 ohms, which is correct. So the answer should be H, which is option H.

To determine the resistance of the copper coil at 50°C, we use the formula for temperature dependence of resistance:

\[
R = R_0 \left(1 + \alpha \Delta T\right)
\]

where:
- \(R_0 = 100 \, \Omega\) (resistance at 20°C),
- \(\alpha = 0.0038 \, \Omega/(\Omega \cdot {}^\circ C)\) (temperature coefficient of resistivity),
- \(\Delta T = 50^\circ C - 20^\circ C = 30^\circ C\).

Substituting the values:

\[
R = 100 \left(1 + 0.0038 \cdot 30\right)
\]

First, calculate the temperature term:

\[
0.0038 \cdot 30 = 0.114
\]

Then, add 1:

\[
1 + 0.114 = 1.114
\]

Finally, multiply by the initial resistance:

\[
R = 100 \cdot 1.114 = 111.4 \, \Omega
\]

The closest option to 111.4 ohms is **111 ohms**, which corresponds to option **H**.
