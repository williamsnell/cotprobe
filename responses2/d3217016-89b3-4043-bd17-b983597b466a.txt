Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Even though there is no such thing as a "typical cell" - for there are too many diverse kinds of cells - biologists have determined that there are two basic cell types. What are these two types of cells?

Options:

A: Single-celled and Multi-celled
B: Animal and Plant cells
C: Procaryotic and Eucaryotic
D: Diploid and Haploid cells
E: Photosynthetic and Non-photosynthetic cells
F: Vascular and Non-vascular cells
G: Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic
H: Somatic and Germ cells
I: Autotrophic and Heterotrophic cells
J: Aerobic and Anaerobic cells

Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about identifying the two basic cell types that biologists have determined. The options are from A to J, each with different categories.

Hmm, I remember from my notes that cells can be classified based on their structure and function. The main categories are prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells are the simplest form, usually found in bacteria, and they have a cell membrane and some sort of membrane-bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells, on the other hand, are more complex. They have a nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other organelles like ribosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum. So that would make option G the right answer.

Wait, let me think about the options again. Option C is Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic, which makes sense. Other options don't fit as well. For example, option A is single vs multi-celled, which I think is about tissue types, not the cell types themselves. Option B is animals vs plants, which are kingdoms, not cell types. Option D is about allele numbers in a population, which is related to genetics but not cell types. E talks about photosynthesis vs non, which relates to whether cells can make their own food. F is vascular vs non-vascular, which is about how cells are connected, like in plants. J is about oxygen production, which is a function, not the type.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident that G is the correct answer. The key is that prokaryotes and eukaryotes are the two fundamental types of cells based on their structure and function.

The correct answer is G: Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic. These are the two fundamental cell types classified based on their structure and function.

Answer: G
