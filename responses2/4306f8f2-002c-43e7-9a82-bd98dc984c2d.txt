Okay, so I've got this physics question here about electric flux and net flux through a closed surface. Hmm, I remember from my notes that Gauss's Law relates electric flux to enclosed charge. Let me think about what Gauss's Law says exactly. Oh right, the electric flux Φ through a closed surface is equal to the enclosed charge Q divided by the permittivity of free space ε₀. So the formula is Φ = Q/ε₀.

The question is asking under what conditions this net electric flux is proportional to the enclosed charge. Wait, the flux itself is directly proportional to the charge, so the condition must relate to when the flux depends on the charge. But wait, the options include various scenarios, so I need to match the condition to one of them.

Looking at the options:

Option A: only when there are no charges outside the surface. Oh, because if there are no charges outside, the enclosed charge is all that's there, so the flux depends only on that. That makes sense because Gauss's Law applies when the charges inside are the only ones influencing the flux through the surface. But wait, the question is asking when the flux is proportional to the enclosed charge, which is always the case here, right? Because Φ is Q/ε₀. So that's directly proportional. So A could be the answer.

Option B: charges in motion. Oh, wait, Gauss's Law applies to static charges. So if the charges are moving, their time-averaged contribution might not be considered in Gauss's Law. That might complicate things, but the question is about when the flux is proportional to the enclosed charge, which is when there are no charges outside. So B doesn't fit, because it's about charges moving, not about flux.

Option C: electric field is uniform. I'm not sure how that affects flux. If the field is uniform, maybe it's easier to compute, but flux depends on the enclosed charge. Like Q=ε₀Φ, so for uniform fields, Φ= E*A (if the surface is flat and E is uniform across it), but the E field depends on the charge distribution. So the flux is not necessarily proportional to the charge unless E is uniform. But wait, the question is when the flux is proportional, so if the electric field is uniform, then yes, Φ would be proportional to Q, since Q=ε₀Φ. But that's only when E is uniform. However, does that condition always hold? Or is it a general scenario? So C is only a specific condition, not the general case.

Option D: only when the charge is negative. Well, Gauss's Law works regardless of the charge's sign. Whether positive or negative, the flux is Q/ε₀. So D isn't the condition that makes the flux proportional. It's about the charge's sign, not the proportionality.

Option E: only when the charge is at rest. Hmm, because Gauss's Law is applicable for all charges, regardless of motion. So motion of charges doesn't affect Gauss's Law. So E is incorrect because it's about motion, but the question is about proportionality, which depends on the enclosed charge, not on the motion of charges.

Option F: only when the charge is symmetrically distributed. Again, symmetry affects the flux. For example, a spherical charge distribution has a certain flux, but for other symmetries, the flux could vary. But the question is about when the flux is proportional to the charge, which depends on the enclosed charge Q, regardless of symmetry. So F is not the condition.

Option G: only when the surface is a perfect sphere. Well, Gauss's Law applies to any closed surface, not just spheres, as long as it's symmetric. So the shape doesn't matter. So G's condition is too specific and doesn't describe the general situation.

Option H: only when the enclosed charge is positive. As I thought earlier, Gauss's Law works for positive and negative charges. So H is incorrect.

Option I: under any conditions. So, is the flux proportional to the enclosed charge regardless of conditions? Wait, the initial condition is that there are no charges outside the surface. Because Gauss's Law applies when the charges are within the surface, and the surface doesn't enclose any other charges. So the flux is proportional only when there are no external charges, which is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is asking under what conditions the net electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge. So the condition is when the enclosed charge is the only thing influencing the flux. That's when there are no charges outside.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The question asks under what conditions the net electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge. To determine this, we analyze the options based on the principles of Gauss's Law and the nature of electric flux.

- **Option A**: This states that the flux is proportional to the enclosed charge when there are no charges outside the surface. This is correct because Gauss's Law directly states that the electric flux Φ is proportional to the enclosed charge Q: Φ = Q/ε₀. This condition ensures that the flux depends only on the charge inside the surface, making it directly proportional.

- **Option B**: This mentions charges in motion, which Gauss's Law applies to static charges. Since the question pertains to the proportionality of flux to the charge, this condition does not apply.

- **Option C**: This refers to a uniform electric field. While a uniform electric field may simplify calculations, the proportionality of flux to the enclosed charge holds true for any electric field, as long as the enclosed charge is the only factor influencing the flux. Thus, this condition is not the defining factor.

- **Option D**: This states the charge is negative. The sign of the charge does not affect the proportionality of flux to the charge; Gauss's Law applies universally regardless of the charge's sign.

- **Option E**: This specifies that the charge is at rest. However, Gauss's Law applies to all charges, regardless of whether they are at rest or in motion. The question is about the proportionality, which depends on the enclosed charge, not the charge's motion.

- **Option F**: This mentions symmetry in the charge distribution. While symmetry affects the calculation of flux, it does not determine the proportionality of flux to the enclosed charge.

- **Option G**: This states the surface is a perfect sphere. Gauss's Law applies to any closed surface, not just spheres, as long as the surface is symmetric. Thus, this condition is too specific.

- **Option H**: This specifies the charge is positive. The sign of the charge does not affect the proportionality of flux to the charge.

- **Option I**: This suggests the conditions are met under any circumstances. However, the proportionality of flux to the enclosed charge depends on the absence of external charges, not on other factors.

- **Option J**: This states that all nearby charges are symmetrically distributed. This condition is irrelevant to the proportionality of flux to the enclosed charge.

The correct answer is **Option A**, as the flux is directly proportional to the enclosed charge only when there are no charges outside the surface. This is the defining condition for Gauss's Law.
