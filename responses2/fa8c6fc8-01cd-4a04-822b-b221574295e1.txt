Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the electric field at the surface of a nucleus. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The question says the nucleus of a Plutonium-239 atom has 94 protons. The radius is given as 6.64 femtometers. Oh wait, femtometers are 1e-15 meters, right? So I should convert that to meters for consistency. So 6.64 fm is 6.64e-15 meters.

I remember that the electric field produced by a uniformly charged sphere can be calculated using Gauss's Law. But wait, when the radius is smaller than the point where we're measuring the field, like at the surface, the electric field is different. Oh right, because for a uniformly charged sphere, the field inside is different from outside. But wait, the question says the charge is uniformly spread through the sphere, and we're looking at the surface. So I think for the surface, the entire charge is enclosed, so it's like a point charge.

Wait wait, no. Actually, the field at the surface of the sphere is the same as that of a point charge of the same total charge. Because for a uniformly charged sphere, the electric field outside is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center, but inside, it's zero. So at the surface, which is outside, the field would be like that of a point charge.

So the formula I think is E = k * Q / r², where k is Coulomb's constant, Q is the charge, and r is the radius.

Wait, but wait—the radius is given as the radius of the nucleus. So the field at the surface (which is the same as the radius) is given by that formula.

But wait, let me make sure. The charge Q is 94 protons. Each proton has a charge of 1.6e-19 coulombs. So Q is 94 * 1.6e-19 C.

So let's compute that: 94 * 1.6e-19 = let's see, 94 * 1.6 is 150.4, so 150.4e-19 C, which is 1.504e-17 C.

Now, Coulomb's constant k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Putting it all together: E = (8.988e9) * (1.504e-17) / (6.64e-15)^2.

Wait, let me compute the denominator first. (6.64e-15)^2 is 6.64 squared * 1e-30. 6.64^2 is about 44. So 44e-30, which is 4.4e-29.

Wait, let me compute 6.64 squared. 6.64 * 6.64: 6*6 is 36, 6*.64 is 3.84, 0.64*6 is 3.84, 0.64*0.64 is 0.4096. So adding: 36 + (3.84 + 3.84) + 0.4096 = 36 + 7.68 + 0.4096 = 44.0896. So approximately 44.09. So 44.09e-30 m².

So denominator is 44.09e-30 m².

So putting into the formula: E = (8.988e9) * (1.504e-17) / (44.09e-30 )

Let me compute numerator first: 8.988e9 * 1.504e-17 = (8.988 * 1.504) * 1e(9-17) = (13.53) * 1e-8 → 1.353e-7.

Wait, wait: 8.988e9 is 8.988 x 10^9, 1.504e-17 is 1.504 x 1e-17. Multiplying gives (8.988 * 1.504) x 1e(9-17) → 8.988 * 1.504 is approximately 13.53. So 13.53e-8, which is 1.353e-7.

Wait, no, because 10^9 * 10^-17 is 10^-8. So 8.988e9 * 1.504e-17 = 1.353e-7 (since 8.988 * 1.504 ≈ 13.53 → 13.53e-8 = 1.353e-7).

Denominator is 44.09e-30 m².

So 1.353e-7 / 44.09e-30 = (1.353 / 44.09) * 1e( -7 +30 ) → (approx 0.03066) * 1e23 → 3.066e21 N/C.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 1.353e-7 divided by 44.09e-30.

1.353e-7 / 44.09e-30 = (1.353 /44.09) * 1e( -7 +30 ) = 0.03066 * 1e23 → 3.066e21 N/C.

Looking at the options, option F is 3.07e21, which is very close to what I calculated.

But wait, let me double-check my steps. Did I make any errors in the exponents?

Wait, 6.64e-15 squared is (6.64^2) * (1e-15)^2 = 44.09e-30.

So denominator is 44.09e-30.

Numerator is 8.988e9 * 1.504e-17 = ?

Let me compute 8.988 * 1.504: 8 * 1.5 is 12, 0.988 *1.5 is about 1.482, 8 *0.004 is 0.032, 0.988 *0.004 is ~0.00395. So 12 + 1.482 =13.482, plus 0.032 and 0.00395 → 13.51795. So approximately 13.5.

So 13.5e(9-17) → 13.5e-8 → 1.35e-7.

So 1.35e-7 / 44.09e-30 → 1.35 /44.09 is about 0.0306. So 0.0306 * 1e(23) → 3.06e21 N/C.

So the closest option is F: 3.07e21.

To calculate the electric field at the surface of the nucleus of a Plutonium-239 atom, we assume the nucleus behaves as a uniformly charged sphere. The electric field at the surface is given by:

\[
E = \frac{kQ}{r^2}
\]

where:
- \(k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2\) (Coulomb's constant),
- \(Q = 94 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\) (total charge of the nucleus),
- \(r = 6.64 \, \text{fm} = 6.64 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}\) (radius of the nucleus).

### Step 1: Calculate the total charge \(Q\)
\[
Q = 94 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} = 1.504 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{C}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the radius squared \(r^2\)
\[
r^2 = (6.64 \times 10^{-15})^2 = 44.09 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Substitute into the electric field formula
\[
E = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(1.504 \times 10^{-17})}{44.09 \times 10^{-30}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
8.988 \times 10^9 \times 1.504 \times 10^{-17} = 1.353 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Now, divide by the denominator:
\[
E = \frac{1.353 \times 10^{-7}}{44.09 \times 10^{-30}} = 0.03066 \times 10^{23} = 3.066 \times 10^{21} \, \text{N/C}.
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated electric field is approximately \(3.07 \times 10^{21} \, \text{N/C}\), which corresponds to **option F**.
