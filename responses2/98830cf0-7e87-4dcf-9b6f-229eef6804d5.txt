Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about partnership law, specifically about silent partners. Let me try to work through this step by step. 

The question is about Pete Smith and Bill Jones in a general partnership called Pete Smith Plumbing. Pete is active, meaning he's making decisions and managing the business, while Bill is a silent partner, who is buying inventory without being directly involved in the management. 

Bill buys 100 toilets, but Pete is upset because it will take years to use them. The question is asking what Bill can do to bind the partnership. The options are A through J.

First, I need to remember the basics of partnership law. In a partnership, the partners have certain obligations. Active partners are those who are in the business and have a direct role in making decisions. Silent partners, like Bill here, are investors who buy the partnership without being active. 

I recall that silent partners generally cannot bind the partnership. That's because they don't have the authority to make decisions on the business. So, their purchasing doesn't transfer ownership or rights. Thus, Bill's purchase shouldn't be binding on the partnership.

Looking at the options:

A: The partnership can only be bound by the actions of the active partner, not the silent partner. That seems correct. Silent partners aren't responsible for the partnership's actions.

B: Silent partners are investors only and cannot bind the partnership. This also sounds right. Investors can't enforce their actions as partners, so their purchases aren't binding.

C: Bill can bind the partnership by his act. I don't think so. Since Bill isn't an active partner, he can't influence the partnership's decisions, so his purchase is not binding.

D: Bill's action is invalid because he didn't consult with Pete. This doesn't make sense. The partnership's liability isn't based on whether they consulted, but on who the partner is. So D is incorrect.

E: The partnership can return the toilets, as Bill didn't have the authority to make the purchase. Wait, no. Because in a partnership, the partnership can't return inventory unless the buyer can prove the seller has authority. But the question is about whether Bill's purchase is binding. So E is about the return, which isn't directly related to binding.

F: Unless his name is in the partnership name, third persons are "on notice" that he is unauthorized to contract for the partnership. Not sure about this. Third persons being on notice isn't a standard rule. I think it's more about obligations when the partner is an active partner. 

G: Pete can sue Bill for unnecessary expenditure. That's not correct because the partnership can recover from the active partner, not the silent one. Because active partners have more influence.

H: Bill, as a silent partner, is not authorized to purchase and, therefore, the sale may be set aside. No, silent partners are allowed to buy, but their actions don't bind the partnership. So H is incorrect.

I: The third party who sold the toilets to Bill can be held liable for not verifying his authority. That's about another buyer, not this partner. Bill's purchase isn't about third parties, so I doesn't apply.

J: If Bill purchased the toilets using his personal funds, the partnership is not bound by his actions. Wait, the partnership's liability isn't based on whether they used personal funds. So J is suggesting that the partnership isn't bound. But wait, J says it's not bound because Bill used personal funds. That doesn't make sense. Because in a general partnership, the partners' investments are considered equal contributions, regardless of whether they're personal or business funds. So the partnership shouldn't be bound by Bill's personal use. Wait, but J is suggesting that if he used personal funds, the partnership isn't bound. But that doesn't seem right. The question is about the purchase, not the method of purchase. J's statement doesn't seem accurate.

Wait, but let me think again. In general partnerships, the partners' investments are considered as capital contributions, not personal. So the partnership's liability is based on the ownership, not the method. So J's reasoning is incorrect. So option J is incorrect.

So looking back at the options, the correct statements are A and B. But wait, the question is about what Bill can do. So either A or B is correct.

Wait, let's re-examine the options. The question is asking what Bill can do to bind the partnership. So, A suggests that the partnership can only be bound by the active partner, not the silent. So Bill's purchase isn't binding because it's a silent partner. That's correct. So A is correct.

Option B says silent partners are investors only and cannot bind the partnership. That's also correct because investors can't enforce their actions as partners. So both A and B are correct? But looking at the options, the choices are separate, so the question is which advice is best.

Wait, the question is about the best advice. Looking at the options, both A and B are correct in their statements. But which one is the best advice.

Wait, the question says "the best advice" is one of the options. So let me reevaluate.

Wait, in general partnerships, silent partners are allowed to participate and make purchases. However, their actions can't bind the partnership. So Bill's purchase is not binding. So the correct advice is that the partnership cannot be bound by the silent partner's actions. So the best advice is option A.

Alternatively, option B says that silent partners cannot bind the partnership. So both A and B are correct. But the question is looking for the best advice. Wait, the options are separate, but the question is presented as a single correct answer.

Wait, the options are:

A: The partnership can only be bound by the actions of the active partner, not the silent partner.

B: silent partners are investors only and cannot bind the partnership.

So both A and B are correct, but the question is which is the best advice.

Wait, the question is phrased as "the best advice is" and the options are labeled A-J, each a statement.

So the options are about what advice Bill can give. So which is correct.

But wait, in a general partnership, silent partners can purchase, but their actions don't bind the partnership. So B says that silent partners cannot bind, which is correct. So the correct advice is to not rely on their actions.

Option A says that the partnership can only be bound by the actions of the active partner. So B is correct, but A is also correct. So why would the question present two correct options?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about Bill's actions. The best advice is that the partnership cannot be bound by the silent partner's actions, so A is correct.

But I also recall that in a partnership, the partners' actions may sometimes be considered, but generally, the partnership isn't bound by the silent partner's actions. So the answer should be A.

The question revolves around the legal implications of a silent partner purchasing inventory in a general partnership. In a general partnership, active partners bear more responsibilities, but silent partners cannot bind the partnership. Their actions, such as purchasing inventory, do not transfer ownership and are not considered actions that can bind the partnership.

**Option A** states that the partnership can only be bound by the actions of the active partner, not the silent partner. This is correct because silent partners, like Bill, cannot enforce their actions as partners and thus their purchases are not binding on the partnership.

**Option B** claims that silent partners are investors only and cannot bind the partnership. This is also correct because investors, including silent partners, cannot enforce their actions as partners.

However, the question asks for the best advice regarding how Bill can bind the partnership. Both A and B are accurate, but the question likely expects the most direct and complete answer. Since Option A directly addresses the partnership's inability to bind silent partners, it is the best choice.

ANSWER: A
