Okay, so I've got this question about tax structures, and I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question describes two individuals: Mr. Gribbonearns and Mr. Doyle. Mr. Gribbonearns makes $10,000 annually as an accountant and pays $1500 in taxes. That means his tax rate is 1500 divided by 10,000, which is 15%. 

On the other hand, Mr. Doyle makes $50,000 as a frankfurter vendor. After taxes, he takes home $45,000. So, his tax amount is $5,000, which is 10% of his income. 

Now, the question is about the tax structure—whether it's progressive, proportional, or regressive. The options include things like flat rate, graduated, indexed, variable, and others.

Let me recall what each term means. A progressive tax system means higher income brackets are taxed at higher rates. For example, lower earners pay a lower percentage, and higher earners pay a higher percentage. Proportional is when everyone pays the same percentage, regardless of their income. Regressive is the opposite—low earners pay more taxes, and higher earners pay less. Tiers are ranges with different rates, which is a form of progressive.

Mr. Gribbonearns has a lower income but a lower tax rate than Mr. Doyle. That suggests that as income increases, tax rates might increase, which could be a sign of a progressive tax system. But wait, Mr. Gribbo has lower income but lower tax rate than Mr. Doyle. That's the opposite of what a progressive system would do. In a progressive system, lower earners would have lower rates, and higher would have higher. But here, lower earners have lower rates, which might not fit that pattern. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about the structure, not just individual cases. Let's think about the overall structure. If the tax rate is the same percentage on everyone, regardless of income, that's proportional. If the same percentage is applied to higher income groups, but the actual tax rate increases with income, it's progressive. If it's the opposite, then it's regressive.

Looking at the example given: Mr. Gribbo's 10k pays 15%, Mr. Doyle's 50k pays 10%. So, higher income (50k) is taxed at a lower rate (10%) than lower income. That's the opposite of what you'd expect in a progressive system, which increases the tax rate as income increases. So this doesn't fit into progressive. It also doesn't fit into regressive, since regressive systems have lower rates for higher earners, which isn't the case here.

What about the other options? Let's see:

A: Flat rate. That would mean everyone pays the same tax rate, regardless of income. But in this case, the rates are different. So flat rate isn't it.

B: Graduated. That's when tax brackets have different rates for different income ranges. For example, lower income gets a lower rate, and higher income gets a higher rate. But the question doesn't mention any brackets. It just shows two individuals with different rates. So maybe it's a graduated system. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right classification.

C: Indexed. That's when taxes are based on an index, like the CPI. The rate might stay the same, but the tax amount increases with inflation. Not sure if that's applicable here, but the given information doesn't support that.

D: Variable. That's when tax rates vary based on factors like credit or investments. Not sure if that's the answer.

E: Progressive. As discussed, it's the opposite of what's happening here. Because a progressive system would have lower rates for lower earners, but this is higher rates for lower earners.

F: Regressive. That's the opposite of what's happening here. Regressive systems have higher rates for higher earners, but this shows lower rates for lower earners.

G: Proportional. That's when everyone pays the same percentage. But Mr. Gribboarn's 15% and Mr. Doyle's 10% mean it's not proportional.

H: Tiered. This is a form of progressive, where each income bracket has its own rate. But again, the given data doesn't support a tiered system.

J: None of the above. But I think F, regressive, is the opposite of what's happening. So perhaps the correct answer is F.

The tax structure in question involves two individuals with differing tax rates based on their income. Mr. Gribboarns pays 15% on $10,000, while Mr. Doyle pays 10% on $50,000, indicating a lower tax rate on lower earners. This pattern is characteristic of a regressive tax system, where higher earners pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes. 

Answer: F
