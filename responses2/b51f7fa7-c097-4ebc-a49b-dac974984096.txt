Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether Paul Reilly's bank would give him a better deal if he compounds his interest more frequently. He deposited $5,000 in a savings account with 4% interest. The question is about which compounding method—semiannually, quarterly, or annually—would yield the most profit after three years.

Hmm, I remember that compound interest depends on how often the interest is compounded. The more frequent the compounding, the more earnings he'll make because each interest payment is added to the principal, which then earns interest in the next period.

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount ($5,000 in this case).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form, so 4% is 0.04).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years (3 years here).

So, let's calculate the amount for each compounding period:

Option A: Compounded every two years (semiannual).
n = 2.
So, A = 5000(1 + 0.04/2)^(2*3) = 5000(1 + 0.02)^(6) = 5000*(1.02)^6. Calculating that, (1.02)^6 is approximately 1.1262. So, 5000 * 1.1262 = ~5631.03.

Option B: Compounded semiannually. Wait, this is the same as option A. So same calculation. So, same result, ~5631.

Option C: Compounded yearly (n=1).
A = 5000(1 + 0.04)^3 = 5000*(1.124864) = ~5624.32.

Option D: Compounded biannually (every 6 months). Oh wait, that's the same as A and B. So same amount as A.

Option E: Compounded weekly. That's n=52. Let's compute that.
A = 5000*(1 + 0.04/52)^(52*3) = 5000*(1 + 0.00076923)^156. Hmm, 0.04/52 is about 0.00076923. Raising 1.00076923 to the 156th power. That's a bit tricky, but I think the more frequent the compounding, the higher the rate. Alternatively, I can calculate it as (1.04/52)^52 for a year, then raise to the 3rd power.

Wait, alternatively, maybe it's better to compare the effective annual rate. The effective annual rate (EAR) is (1 + r/n)^n - 1. Let's compute the EAR for each option and compare them.

Effective rate for A and B: n=2. So, EAR = (1 + 0.04/2)^2 -1 = (1.02)^2 -1 = 1.0404 -1 = 0.0404 or 4.04%.

For C: n=1. EAR is 4% as well.

For D: n=2. Same as A and B.

For E: n=52. So, EAR = (1 + 0.04/52)^52 -1. Let's compute that: 0.04/52 is approximately 0.00076923. (1.00076923)^52. I think this is approximately e^(0.04), which is about 1.0408, so the EAR is about 4.08%.

For F: Compounded daily. n=365. So, EAR = (1 + 0.04/365)^365 -1. I think this is roughly e^0.04, so about 4.08%. Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think. The exact value is (1 + 0.04/365)^365. Let me compute 0.04/365 = 0.000109589. Let's approximate (1.000109589)^365. Using the formula, this is e^(0.04) ≈ 1.0408, so 4.08% EAR.

G: Compounded annually (n=1). So, same as C: 4% EAR.

H: Compounded monthly (n=12). EAR = (1 + 0.04/12)^12 -1. 0.04/12 = 0.003333. (1.003333)^12 ≈ e^0.04 → about 4.08% as well, using the approximation.

I: Compounded hourly (n=365*24*60*60=876000). So, EAR = (1 + 0.04 / 876000)^876000 -1. 0.04/876000 is approximately 4.579e-6. So, (1 + 4.579e-6)^876000 ≈ e^0.04 (since the exponent is large), so again, 4.08% EAR.

Wait, but wait. The effective annual rate is the same for all compounding periods because they are all yielding the same rate. So, the more frequently it's compounded, the higher the effective annual rate, but in this case, the effective rate is 4.04% for semiannual and annual, and 4.08% for daily, etc. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.

Wait, for option E (compounded weekly), the effective annual rate is (1 + 0.04/52)^52 -1. Let me compute that:

0.04/52 ≈ 0.00076923.

So, (1.00076923)^52. Let me compute this using logarithms or approximate. Alternatively, I can use the rule that the effective annual rate is approximately r = (1 + i)^n -1, where i is the periodic rate and n is the number of periods in a year.

So, 1 + i = 1.00076923, so (1.00076923)^52 = ?

Alternatively, using the formula for compound interest, but perhaps more accurately, I can compute it as:

(1.00076923)^52 = e^(52 * ln(1.00076923)).

Compute ln(1.00076923) ≈ 0.0007684. Multiply by 52: 0.0007684 *52 = approx 0.04. So, e^0.04 ≈ 1.0408, so 4.08% effective rate.

Wait, but for n=2, the effective rate is 4.04%. So, the more frequent the compounding, the higher the effective rate. So, for example, compounding daily (n=365) would give a higher effective rate than semiannual (n=2). Wait, but in the calculation, the effective rate for E (weekly) is about 4.08%, which is higher than the effective rate of 4.04% for semiannual. So, the more frequent the compounding, the higher the effective annual rate.

So, Paul would get more interest if he compounds more frequently. So, which one is more profitable? The options include semiannual, daily, etc.

Looking back at the options, let's see which ones give a higher amount.

Option A is semiannual, which we calculated as ~5631.

Option E is weekly. Let's compute it:

A = 5000*(1 + 0.04/52)^(52*3) = 5000*(1.00076923)^156.

Let me compute (1.00076923)^156.

Since 1.00076923^52 ≈ 1.0408 (as before), then raising that to the 3rd power (since 156/52=3), so 1.0408^3 ≈ 1.127486. So, A = 5000 * 1.127486 ≈ 5637.43.

So, semiannual (A) gives ~5631, while weekly (E) gives ~5637.43. So, more frequent compounding yields higher interest.

Now, looking at the options, options A, E, F, G, H, I are all more frequent than semiannually. So, the most profitable would be the one with the highest compounding frequency.

Wait, option F is daily, which has the highest frequency, so it would give the highest effective rate and thus the highest amount. But the options are A through I, so the question is which option gives the most profit. So, the more frequent the compounding, the higher the amount.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A: every two years (semiannual)
B: semiannually (same as A)
C: yearly
D: biannually (same as A)
E: weekly
F: daily
G: annually
H: monthly
I: hourly

But the question is asking which way is more profitable. So, the one with more frequent compounding (daily, or more) would yield more money. So, the options are A, E, F, etc.

Wait, but the options are letters A to I, each representing a different compounding frequency. The question is which way will be more profitable. So, the more frequent the compounding, the higher the amount, so the correct answer would be the option with the highest compounding frequency.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

A: Compounded every two years (semiannual)
B: Semiannually (same)
C: yearly
D: biannually (same as A)
E: weekly
F: daily
G: annually
H: monthly
I: hourly

Wait, but the question is for which method. So, the higher frequency gives more interest. So, which is the most frequent? I (hourly) is the most frequent, so that would give the highest amount.

Wait, but the options are A, B, etc. So, the answer is either E, F, etc., but the question is which one is more profitable. So, the correct answer would be the one with the highest compounding frequency, which is I (hourly). But looking at the options, the choices are A through I, each option represents a different compounding frequency. So, the correct choice is the one with the highest frequency.

But wait, looking again at the problem, the options are A through I, each representing a different compounding method. The correct answer is the one with the highest compounding frequency, which is I (hourly). Alternatively, perhaps the question is about which method gives the most profit, so the correct answer is I.

But wait, looking at the options, the options are A to I, each with different compounding periods. So, the question is which way will be more profitable, which would be the one with the highest frequency. So, the correct answer is I: compounded hourly.

Wait, but wait, what about option F, which is daily. Daily compounding is more frequent than weekly, so it should yield more.

Wait, but the options are each an individual choice. So, the question is asking which of the options (A to I) would be more profitable. So, the most profitable would be the one with the highest compounding frequency, which is I (hourly).

But looking back, the current calculation shows that compounding more frequently (like daily or hourly) yields more interest than semiannual (A, B, etc.). So, the more frequent the compounding, the higher the amount.

So, the answer would be the option with the highest frequency, which is I: compounded hourly.

Wait, but let's think again. The options are A through I, each representing varying compounding periods. So, the correct choice is the one with the highest frequency, which is I: hourly. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake because I thought the effective rate for daily compounding would be higher than semiannual. Wait, earlier calculations suggested that, but let me make sure.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recalculate for option E (weekly) and I (hourly).

Option E: weekly (n=52)
A = 5000*(1 + 0.04/52)^(52*3)
= 5000*(1.00076923)^156
= 5000 * (approx 1.127486) = 5637.43.

Option I: hourly (n=365*24*60*60=876000)
A = 5000*(1 + 0.04/876000)^876000
= 5000*(1 + 4.578e-6)^876000
Using the approximation that (1 + i)^n ≈ e^(n*i), where i is very small.
So, n*i = 876000 * 4.578e-6 = approx 4.08.
So, e^0.04 is about 1.0408, so A =5000 *1.0408=5204.

Wait, wait, but that can't be right. Because with 876000 periods, each 1/876000th of a year. So, (1 + 0.04/876000) is 1.0000004578. Raising it to the 876000th power would be approximately e^0.04, which is 1.0408. So, 5000 * 1.0408 = 5204. So, 5,204.

Wait, but earlier, the weekly calculation gave 5637.43, which is higher than 5204. So, more frequent compounding gives higher amount. So, daily (F) would give even more.

But, the options are A to I, so the question is which option (A to I) is more profitable. So, the one with the highest compounding frequency is I (hourly), which would give the highest amount.

Wait, but looking back, option I is compounded hourly, so that's the most frequent. So, that's the most profitable.

So, the correct answer should be I: compounded hourly.

But wait, let me double-check. The effective annual rate for I is about 4.08%, while for E (weekly) it's also 4.08%. So, same as daily (F). Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think.

Wait, no, the effective annual rate for daily compounding would be (1 + 0.04/365)^(365) ≈ e^0.04 ≈4.08%, same as for daily. So, the effective rate is the same, but the more frequent the compounding, the higher the actual amount.

So, for the same effective rate, more frequent compounding yields more interest. So, the most frequent is hourly, which is option I.

So, the answer is I: compounded hourly.
</think>

To determine which compounding frequency yields the most profit, we compare the effective annual rates (EAR) for each option. The EAR is given by:

\[
\text{EAR} = \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^n - 1
\]

where \( r = 0.04 \) (4% annual interest rate), and \( n \) is the number of compounding periods per year.

- **Option A (Semiannual, n=2):** EAR = \((1 + 0.04/2)^2 - 1 = 4.04\%\).
- **Option B (Semiannual, same as A):** Same calculation as A.
- **Option C (Yearly, n=1):** EAR = 4%.
- **Option D (Biannually, n=2):** Same as A.
- **Option E (Weekly, n=52):** EAR ≈ 4.08%.
- **Option F (Daily, n=365):** EAR ≈ 4.08%.
- **Option G (Annually, n=1):** Same as C.
- **Option H (Monthly, n=12):** EAR ≈ 4.08%.
- **Option I (Hourly, n=876000):** EAR ≈ 4.08%.

The effective annual rate is the same for semiannual, yearly, biannual, monthly, and annual compounding. However, the more frequent the compounding, the higher the effective annual rate (EAR). Therefore, compounding more frequently (e.g., hourly) yields a higher amount than less frequent compounding (e.g., weekly or daily).

The correct answer is the option with the highest compounding frequency, which is **hourly (I)**.
