Alright, so I have this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the question says that one pound of gas undergoes compression. The initial state is 500 psi to 50 psi. The volume starts at 3 cubic feet per pound. The process is isentropic because work done equals heat transferred, which I think means it's a constant entropy process. The relation given is that p*v^1.4 is a constant. I need to find the change in internal energy, and the options are in Btu/lbm, I think.

Wait, let me get the units right. The initial volume is in cubic feet per pound. So when it's 3 ft³/lbm, that's the initial volume. The initial pressure is 500 psi, and the final is 50 psi. Hmm.

So the process is isentropic, so using the relation p*v^γ = constant. This is for an ideal gas, right? Or wait, is this for any gas? Well, the problem says the variation is such that p*v^1.4 is constant, so γ is 1.4.

So the process is isentropic with γ=1.4. So for an ideal gas, the change in internal energy depends on the change in temperature. Because internal energy depends on temperature. But since it's an isentropic process, we can relate the temperatures and volumes.

Wait, the first law of thermodynamics says that the change in internal energy (ΔU) is equal to the heat added (Q) minus the work done (W). But here, it's given that the work done is equal to the heat transferred. So Q = W. So ΔU = Q - W = W - W = 0. Hmm, but wait, that would imply ΔU is zero. But wait, is that correct? Or is there a mistake in that approach?

Wait, no. The first law is ΔU = Q - W. But if W is done by the system, then work done on the system is positive. Wait, in the problem, work performed is equal to the amount of heat transferred. So if the work is done on the system (compression), W is positive. Q is heat added to the system, so positive.

So if W = Q (in magnitude), but with the same sign. Then ΔU = Q - W = W - W = 0. So internal energy doesn't change. So ΔU would be zero. So the change in internal energy is zero. But looking at the options, option I is zero Btu/lbm. But wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the definitions. Because in the first law, the work done on the system is positive. So in the problem, the work done by the system is equal to the heat added. So W = Q (same sign). So ΔU = Q - W = Q - Q = 0. So yes, internal energy change is zero. So the answer would be option I.

But wait, the options also have Btu/lbm. So maybe I should compute the actual change in internal energy using the given data and see if it's zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: since the process is isentropic (constant s), and the relation p*v^gamma=constant, and given the initial and final states, we can find the final temperature.

Wait, but since we're dealing with a gas, we can use the ideal gas law. But wait, the process is not necessarily ideal. The problem gives the relation p*v^1.4 is constant, so I think it's an ideal process, but not necessarily an ideal gas. So for an ideal gas, certain relationships hold.

Alternatively, let's think about the relation p*v^k, where k=γ=1.4. Since the process is reversible and isentropic, we can use the relation that for such a process, T*v^(γ-1) is constant. Or wait, perhaps I should use the equation for an isentropic process.

Wait, for an isentropic process, the relation is p*v^γ = constant. So p1*v1^γ = p2*v2^γ. Let me plug in the values.

p1 =500 psi, v1=3 ft³/lbm. p2=50 psi.

So 500*(3)^1.4 =50*(v2)^1.4.

So v2 = [ (500/50) * (3^1.4) ]^(1/1.4)

Compute (500/50)=10. 3^1.4 is approximately 3^1=3, 3^1.4 ~ 3^(1+0.4) = 3 * 3^0.4. 3^0.4 is about 1.5157, so 3*1.5157=4.547. So 10 *4.547=45.47.

So v2=45.47^(1/1.4) = (45.47)^(5/7).

Calculating that: 45.47^(0.7143). Let's think: 45.47 is approximately 45.47. Let me compute the 5/7 power.

Alternatively, take natural logs. Let me compute ln(45.47)= about 3.818. Multiply by 5/7: 3.818 * (5/7) ≈ 3.818 *0.7143 ≈ 2.723. Then e^2.723 is about 15.28. So v2≈15.28 ft³/lbm.

Wait, but the initial volume is 3, so the volume increases from 3 to 15.28. That's a significant change. So the process is expansion.

Now, the process is isentropic, so the internal energy change can be found using the change in temperature. Since internal energy depends only on temperature for ideal gases.

So, we need to find the change in temperature. Using the relation p*v^γ = constant, which becomes p= C/(v^γ), where C is a constant.

Alternatively, using the ideal gas law, but perhaps that's not necessary here.

Wait, for an ideal gas, the relation between pressure and temperature is p = (RT)/v, but since the process is p*v^1.4 = constant, maybe we can use the combined relation.

Let me think: since the process is isentropic, the relation for entropy change is zero. The entropy change for a process is given by dS = (Cv ln(T2/T1) + R ln(v2/v1)) )=0.

But perhaps using the relation p*v^γ = constant, which is p1*v1^γ = p2*v2^γ. We already used that to find v2.

Alternatively, for an ideal gas, the internal energy change is U = n Cv (T2 - T1). So I need to find T1 and T2.

Wait, but wait, using the ideal gas law, p*v = n R T. So since n is constant, p1*v1 = p2*v2 = n R T1 and p2*v2 = n R T2.

Wait, but since p*v^γ = constant, p1*v1^γ = p2*v2^γ.

So, p1*v1 = (p1*v1^γ)^(1/γ) * v1^(1 - γ) / v2^(1 - γ)

Wait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Alternatively, let's find T1 and T2.

We can express T as (p*v)/(n R). So T1 = (p1*v1)/(n R), T2 = (p2*v2)/(n R).

So T2 - T1 = (p2*v2 - p1*v1)/(n R) = [ (p2 v2) - (p1 v1) ] / (n R )

Now, using the given relation p*v^1.4 = constant, so p1*v1^1.4 = p2*v2^1.4. Let's call this constant C.

So C = p1*v1^1.4 = p2*v2^1.4.

Therefore, p2 = C / v2^1.4.

But since p1*v1^1.4 = C, p1 = C / v1^1.4.

So substituting into T2 - T1:

= [ (C/(v2^1.4)) * v2 - (C/(v1^1.4)) * v1 ] / (n R )

Simplify each term:

= [ C (v2^{-0.4} - v1^{-0.4}) ] / (n R )

So T2 - T1 = C (v2^{-0.4} - v1^{-0.4}) / (n R )

But I'm not sure if this is the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the relation for internal energy.

Wait, the internal energy U is a function of temperature only. So U2 - U1 = n Cv (T2 - T1).

But we can find T2 and T1. Let me compute T1 and T2.

From p*v = n R T.

So T1 = (p1 v1)/(n R), T2 = (p2 v2)/(n R).

So:

T2 - T1 = (p2 v2 - p1 v1)/(n R )

But since p1 v1 = p2 v2 = (n R T1) = (n R T2) since T1 = T2? Wait no, T2 != T1. Wait, no, in our case, the process is isentropic, so T1 and T2 are different.

Wait, but in any case, I think I should compute T2 and T1 and then find ΔU.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the change in internal energy using the formula for an ideal gas undergoing a process where p*v^γ = const.

Wait, for a process where p*v^k = const (k=γ), the change in internal energy is U2 - U1 = R*(T2 - T1) * (k - 1)/(k) ?

Wait, another approach: from the first law, since work done equals heat transfer, ΔU = Q - W = W - W = 0. So the internal energy change is zero.

Wait, but that seems conflicting with the options. Let me double-check. If W = Q, then ΔU = 0. So the change in internal energy is zero. So the answer would be option I, which is 0 Btu/lbm.

Wait, but the options include - signs, which suggests that maybe the process is such that the internal energy decreases. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the process is not isentropic. Wait, no, the problem says it's a piston cylinder arrangement undergoing compression, and the relation p*v^1.4 is a constant. So the process is isentropic. So then, according to the first law, yes, ΔU would be zero.

But the options don't have zero as the answer? Wait, looking back at the options, option I is 0 Btu/lbm (no change). So that would be the answer.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the work done by the system, not on the system. So when the piston is compressed, work is done on the gas, so W is positive. Then Q is also positive. So ΔU = Q - W. If Q=W, then ΔU=0.

So yeah, the internal energy change is zero, so the answer is I.

Wait, but what about the options given for Btu/lbm? Because in the problem, the options are in Btu/lbm, but the process variables are in psi and ft³. So I might need to calculate the work done and heat transfer in Btu.

Wait, wait. I think I'm getting confused because the initial data is in psi and ft³/lbm, but the answer options are in Btu/lbm. So perhaps I should compute the work done and then find the internal energy change, but according to the first law, if W = Q, then ΔU is zero.

But if the problem is asking about the change in internal energy, which is zero, then the answer is I.

But why does option E have a negative value? Because perhaps in the first law, the work is W, but it's positive when done by the system, so when work is done on the system, it's negative. But in the problem statement, it's not clear whether work done on or by the system.

Wait, the problem states that the work performed is equal to the amount of heat transferred. So if work is done on the system (compression), then work is positive. Then Q is positive as well.

So in that case, ΔU = Q - W = W - W = 0. So internal energy doesn't change.

So the correct answer is option I.

To solve the problem, we analyze the process using the given data and thermodynamic principles. The process is isentropic, meaning the entropy change (ΔS) is constant. The relationship \( p v^\gamma = \text{constant} \) is provided, where \( \gamma = 1.4 \). This indicates that the process is reversible and follows the given constant. The initial state is \( p_1 = 500 \, \text{psi}, v_1 = 3 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{lbm}, \) and the final pressure is \( p_2 = 50 \, \text{psi} \). The volume at the final state is determined using the relation \( p_1 v_1^\gamma = p_2 v_2^\gamma \), which yields \( v_2 \approx 15.28 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{lbm} \).

Since the process is isentropic, the internal energy change (\( \Delta U \)) is determined by the temperature change. Using the ideal gas law, \( p v = n R T \), we find the temperatures at the initial and final states. The change in internal energy is given by \( \Delta U = n C_v (T_2 - T_1) \). However, the problem states that the work performed is equal to the heat transferred (\( W = Q \)). Substituting into the first law of thermodynamics (\( \Delta U = Q - W \)), we find \( \Delta U = W - W = 0 \). Thus, the internal energy does not change.

The options provided include \( 0 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \) as option I. Therefore, the correct answer is:
