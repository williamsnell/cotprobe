Alright, so I have this question about insurance payments. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the question is about Tom Patrick who was involved in a car accident after crossing a red light. He was injured by five people and had to pay them various amounts. Now, he's suing his insurance company, and I need to determine how much the insurance company paid.

The question provides the amounts each injured person paid: $27,000; $14,000; $6,000; $5,000; and $2,700. So, I need to add all these amounts together to get the total payout. Let me jot them down: 27k, 14k, 6k, 5k, 2.7k. 

Adding them one by one:
First, 27,000 + 14,000 = 41,000.
Then, 41k + 6k = 47k.
Next, 47k + 5k = 52k.
Finally, 52k + 2,700 = 54,700.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says Mr. Patrick has 50-and-100 bodily injury insurance. So, I need to make sure that the total he was responsible for doesn't exceed the insurance coverage. Oh, wait, the insurance coverage is 50-100 bodily injury, which typically means the maximum payout per claim is the insurance amount. But in this case, the insurance policy probably covers up to $50,000 for each claim. So, we have five people, each paying different amounts, but the insurance covers each up to their maximum. But wait, the insurance is for the total, or per claim? Hmm.

Wait, the question is about how much the insurance company paid. So, the insurance company would pay the full amount each person paid, unless the total exceeds the insurance coverage. But wait, the insurance policy is for bodily injury, and the maximum per claim is $50k. So each claim is covered up to $50k. So, the total payout would be the sum of all the payments, because each person's payment is within the insurance's coverage. So in this case, the sum is 54,700, and since the insurance is 50-100, each person's payment is within $50k, so the insurance company would pay all of it.

Wait, no. Wait, the insurance coverage is 50-100, which is the maximum for each bodily injury claim. So, each individual claim is covered up to $50k. So, the total payout by the insurance would be the sum of all payments, which is 27k +14k+6k+5k+2.7k = 54.7k. But the question is, does the insurance cover all of it? Well, the insurance policy's maximum coverage per claim is $50k. So, the total payout would be the sum of all payments, because each payment is within the coverage limit. So, the insurance company would pay the total of 54,700.

Looking at the options, option J is $54,700. So, the answer should be J.

The insurance company would pay the total amount of all payments, which is $54,700, as each payment is within the 50-and-100 bodily injury coverage limit.
