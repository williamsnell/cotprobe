Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about waves moving from iron into air. Hmm, let me think about what I remember. Oh right, wave properties. The question gives me the frequency, and the speeds in each medium, and asks for the wavelengths in each material.

Wait, the frequency is 250 Hz. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, frequency is given as 250/sec, which is 250 Hz. Oh, right, because Hz is cycles per second.

The speed of the wave in iron is 1.6e4 ft/sec, and in air, it's 1.1e3 ft/sec. I need to find the wavelength in each. So wavelength is calculated by the formula wavelength = speed / frequency.

Let me write that down. For each material, wavelength = v / f.

So, for iron: v = 1.6e4 ft/s. So 1.6e4 divided by 250. Let me compute that.

1.6e4 is 16000. Divided by 250. Let's see, 250 * 64 is 16000 because 250 *60=15000, 250*4=1000, 15000+1000=16000. So 16000 /250 =64 ft. So in iron, the wavelength is 64 ft.

Wait, let's check the options. Looking at options, option J is 64 in iron, and air? Let me compute that part too. For air, v is 1.1e3 ft/s. 1100 ft/s divided by 250 Hz. 250 times 4 is 1000, so 4.4. So the wavelength in air is 4.4 ft.

So the wavelengths are 64 ft in iron and 4.4 ft in air. Let me check the options. Option J says 64 ft in iron and 4.4 ft in air. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options again, option J is 64 ft in iron, 4.4 ft in air. So that's the correct answer. Oh, but wait, I think I should double-check my calculations to be sure.

Another way: 1.6e4 divided by 250. 1.6e4 is 16,000. 250 times 64 is 16,000. So yes, 64. Then 1.1e3 is 1100. 1100 divided by 250. Let's compute 250 times 4: 1000. 250 times 4.4 is 250*4 + 250*0.4 = 1000 + 100=1100. So yes, 4.4. So option J is correct.

To determine the wavelengths of the acompressive wave in iron and air, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{v}{f}
\]

where \( v \) is the wave speed and \( f \) is the frequency. The frequency is \( f = 250 \, \text{Hz} \), \( v_{\text{iron}} = 1.6 \times 10^4 \, \text{ft/sec} \), and \( v_{\text{air}} = 1.1 \times 10^3 \, \text{ft/sec} \).

1. **Iron**:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{iron}} = \frac{1.6 \times 10^4 \, \text{ft/sec}}{250 \, \text{Hz}} = \frac{16000}{250} = 64 \, \text{ft}
   \]

2. **Air**:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{air}} = \frac{1.1 \times 10^3 \, \text{ft/sec}}{250 \, \text{Hz}} = \frac{1100}{250} = 4.4 \, \text{ft}
   \]

From the calculations, the wavelength in iron is \( 64 \, \text{ft} \) and in air is \( 4.4 \, \text{ft} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
