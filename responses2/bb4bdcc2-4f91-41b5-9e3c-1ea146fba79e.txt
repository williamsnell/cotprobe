Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the velocity of money. Hmm, I remember that velocity is related to how often money circulates in an economy. The formula I think is V = M * P / Y, where M is money supply, P is price level, and Y is real output. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh wait, another version I've heard is V = M / Y * P. Or is it V = 1/(Y) * M * P? Maybe I should think again.

Wait, no, the correct formula is V = M * P / Y. But wait, I think another way to write it is V = (M * P) / Y. Oh, but P is the price level, which is often approximated as the nominal GDP divided by Y. Because GDP is Y multiplied by P. So if Y*P is real GDP, then P = GDP / Y.

So substituting that into the formula, V = M / Y * (GDP / Y). Wait, that would be V = (M * GDP) / Y². But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, another way is to think in terms of the monetary equation, which is M * V = P * Y. Oh right, that's the basic equation. So rearranging that gives V = (P * Y) / M. But again, I need to know P and Y.

Wait, but the question gives me the total value of all transactions. Oh! In macroeconomics, total value of transactions usually refers to the nominal GDP. Because the total value is the sum of all goods and services bought by the entire economy, which is nominal GDP. So total transactions would be the same as Y * P, since Y is real output and P is price level. So perhaps the total value of transactions is Y * P, which is the nominal GDP.

So if the total value of all transactions is 100,000, that's our M. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says: "the total value of all transactions in the United States is $100,000." Oh, right, so that's the nominal GDP, which is Y * P. So Y*P is 100,000.

But the money supply M is $10,000.

Using the formula V = (M * P) / Y. Wait, but since Y*P is 100,000, which is the same as Y*P = 100k. So Y = 100k / P. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, since M = 10k, and Y*P = 100k, then the formula V = M * P / Y. But substituting Y = (Y*P)/P, so V = (M * P) / (Y*P/P) ) → simplifies to M / Y.

Wait, Y is real output and Y*P is nominal GDP. So V = M * P / Y → but since Y * P is M, then V = M^2 / M → V = M. Wait, that can't be right because that would give V =10, which isn't one of the options. Hmm, I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. The equation I have is M * V = P * Y. So rearranged, that's V = (P * Y) / M.

But Y * P is the nominal GDP, which is 100,000. So V = (100,000) / 10,000 → 10. So V is 10. But looking back at the options, option J is 10.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options except J. But wait, wait, did I get the numbers right? The question says total value of all transactions is 100,000. Oh, wait, that's the same as nominal GDP. So Y*P is 100,000. So V = (100k) / 10k = 10. So the velocity V is 10. So the correct option is J:10.

But wait, the options are A to J; J is 10. So the answer is J.

To calculate the velocity of money, we use the formula:

\[
V = \frac{M \times P}{Y}
\]

where:
- \( M \) is the money supply,
- \( P \) is the price level,
- \( Y \) is real output (real GDP).

In this problem:
- The total value of all transactions (nominal GDP) is given as $100,000, which is \( Y \times P \).
- The money supply (\( M \)) is $10,000.

Substituting into the formula:

\[
V = \frac{10,000 \times 100,000}{100,000} = 10
\]

Thus, the velocity of money is 10. Among the options provided, the correct answer is J: 10.
