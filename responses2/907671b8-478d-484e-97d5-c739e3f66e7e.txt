Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about tariffs. Let me start by recalling what I know about tariffs and their different methods.

First, I remember that tariffs can be imposed in two main ways. One way is per unit, which means the tax is based on the quantity of goods. The other is per category, which might relate to the type of goods, like fruits vs. vegetables. Wait, I'm not sure if that's accurate. Maybe per category refers to different groups of goods, like agricultural products being taxed differently.

As for the first method, per unit is straightforwardâ€”each unit sold is taxed at a certain rate. An example might be a product with a specific tax rate applied to each item. For example, if a widget has a 5% import duty, each widget would cost 5% more.

Now, the second method is a bit trickier. I think this is called ad valorem, which means the tax is based on the value of the goods rather than the quantity. An example would be a tax rate applied to the total value of the goods, not on each unit. So, if a widget weighs 1 kg and has a value of $20, a 10% ad valorem tax would mean $2 is added to the price, regardless of the number of widgets.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question says the two methods are either "imposed in two different ways." So, perhaps the two methods are either per unit or ad valorem. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: A is Per unit and per category. B is Ad valorem and specific. I think I'm mixing up the terms. Ad valorem is based on value, and specific could be a fixed percentage applied to each unit. So, per unit would be a flat rate per item, while ad valorem is per value.

Wait, I think I might have the terminology wrong. Let me think again. The two main methods are either based on quantity (per unit) or based on value (ad valorem). So, the question is asking for the two methods. So, "imposed in two different ways" probably refers to these two: per unit and ad valorem. 

Looking at the options, option B lists Ad valorem and specific. Oh wait, maybe I should double-check. Specific means a fixed amount per unit, whereas ad valorem is based on the value. So, per unit is one method, and ad valorem is another.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information because sometimes specific can be a term for per unit. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to two methods: one is based on quantity (per unit) and the other is based on value (ad valorem). So, the options that have these two would be option B: Ad valorem and specific. Wait, no, because specific is a term for per unit. So, perhaps it's per unit and ad valorem, which would be option A.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think of the correct terms. The two methods are per unit (quantity-based) and ad valorem (value-based). So, looking for an option that matches these two.

Option A is Per unit and per category. Hmm, that's not exactly correct. Per category isn't a standard term. Ad valorem is value-based, and per unit is quantity-based. So, perhaps A is correct in the sense that it's two methods, but I'm not sure if "per category" is a standard term.

Option B: Ad valorem and specific. Ad valorem is value-based, specific is fixed amount per unit. So, that would be correct. But wait, I thought specific might be a part of per unit. Maybe I'm mixing terms.

Alternatively, the two methods could be per unit and ad valorem. Then, the correct option would be A: Per unit and per category. But I'm not sure if "per category" is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the definition. Ad valorem is based on the value of the goods, so that's one method. The other is based on the quantity, which is per unit. So the two methods are per unit and ad valorem. Looking for that in the options, option A says per unit and per category. No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe the two methods are per unit (quantity-based) and ad valorem (value-based). So, the correct option would be option B: Ad valorem and specific. Wait, no, because specific is a type of per unit. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the two methods are either per unit or based on value (ad valorem). So, the options that have these two would be B, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the two terms are per unit and ad valorem, which would be option A.

Wait, no, I think the correct terms are per unit and ad valorem. So I need to look for an option that includes these two. Looking at the options, none of them have both. Wait, option B is Ad valorem and specific. Option A is Per unit and per category.

Alternatively, perhaps per unit is one, and the other is based on value, which is ad valorem. So the two methods are per unit and ad valorem, which is option B. But I'm not sure because "per unit" is part of per category. Hmm.

Wait, maybe per unit and ad valorem are the correct options, and the answer is option B. But I'm not 100% confident because I might have gotten the terms mixed up.

Another approach: I know that ad valorem is a type of specific tax, but I'm not certain. Wait, no, specific is a term for per unit. Ad valorem is based on value. So, the two methods are per unit and ad valorem. So the correct answer would be option A: Per unit and per category. Wait, no, per category isn't a standard term; that's probably incorrect.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to two methods: one is based on quantity (per unit), and the other is based on value (ad valorem). So the correct option is A: Per unit and per category. No, that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the correct options are B: Ad valorem and specific.

Wait, but I think the correct pair is per unit and ad valorem, so the options would have those. Looking back at the options provided, the only option that includes both is not present. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Per unit and per category

B: Ad valorem and specific

C: Percentage and fixed fee

D: Comprehensive and selective

E: Fixed rate and variable rate

F: Direct and indirect

G: Proportional and disproportional

H: Import and export

I: Progressive and regressive

J: Flat and graduated

So, looking for the pair of methods, the correct ones are per unit and ad valorem. So, none of these options have both per unit and ad valorem. Wait, so perhaps the correct answer is B: Ad valorem and specific. Because specific is a type of per unit, but that can't be right. Or maybe the question is about two methods, which are per unit and ad valorem, which is option A, but it says per category, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A: Per unit and per category. But again, per category isn't a standard term. Alternatively, perhaps the correct terms are per unit and specific, but no, that's not one of the options.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. The two main methods are:

1. Per unit: based on quantity. Example: import duty.

2. Ad valorem: based on value. Example: value-based tax.

So the correct answer would be option A: Per unit and per category. Wait no, that's not right because per category isn't a method. So perhaps the correct answer is B: Ad valorem and specific. But wait, specific is a type of per unit, so that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct pair is per unit and specific. But no, specific is per unit. Wait, maybe the two methods are based on quantity (per unit) and based on value (ad valorem). So the correct options would be B: Ad valorem and specific, because specific is a type of per unit? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. I'm confused.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option A: Per unit and per category. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: Ad valorem and specific. But I think I'm mixing the definitions.

Wait, I'll try to clarify: Ad valorem is a type of specific tax. So, per unit is a specific tax (fixed percentage per unit), while ad valorem is based on the value of the goods. So, the two methods are per unit and ad valorem. So the correct options would be A: Per unit and per category. But no, because per category isn't a standard term. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but it's a typo and should be ad valorem instead of per category.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: Ad valorem and specific, but that's not accurate because specific is a type of per unit. So, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact definitions. Ad valorem is a form of specific tax that applies a percentage to the value of the goods. So, for example, if the value is $100 and the ad valorem rate is 10%, the tax is $10.

Per unit is a specific tax applied to each individual unit. So, if a widget costs $5 and has a 10% ad valorem tax, the total cost is $5 * 1.10 = $5.50.

So, the two methods are ad valorem (based on value) and per unit (based on quantity). Therefore, the correct answer is option A: Per unit and per category. Wait, no, per category isn't a standard term. So perhaps the correct answer is option B: Ad valorem and specific. But that's not accurate because specific is a type of per unit. So, I'm back to confusion.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A because in some contexts, people refer to per unit as 'per quantity' or 'per unit,' but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct method is per unit and per category, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the wrong terminology, and the correct terms are per unit and ad valorem. So, the answer would be A: Per unit and per category. But that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the answer is option B: Ad valorem and specific. But I think that's incorrect because specific is a subset of per unit.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the two terms are 'per unit' and 'value-based,' which is not an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B, but I think that's not the case.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. I think the correct answer is that the two methods are per unit and ad valorem. So the options are A: Per unit and per category. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's B: Ad valorem and specific. But I'm not sure. I think I should go with option A, but I'm not confident.

The question asks for the two methods of imposing tariffs and the corresponding examples. The correct methods are based on quantity (per unit) and value (ad valorem). 

- **Per unit** applies a fixed percentage to each item. For example, a widget costing $5 with a 10% ad valorem tax becomes $5.50.
- **Ad valorem** applies a percentage to the value of the goods. If a widget's value is $100 and the ad valorem rate is 10%, the tax is $10.

Looking at the options, **A: Per unit and per category** is incorrect because "per category" is not a standard term. However, based on the options provided, **B: Ad valorem and specific** is the closest, though "specific" might refer to per unit. Given the options, **A** is the best fit despite the term "per category" being incorrect.
