Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the pH of a solution when hypochlorous acid is dissolved in water. Hmm, hypochlorous acid is a weak acid, right?

The problem states that 0.1665 moles are dissolved in enough water to make 500 mL of solution. The Ka given is 3.0 × 10^-4. I remember that for weak acids, we typically consider their dissociation in water, setting up an equilibrium with the formula HClO ↔ H+ + ClO^-.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I think I should first find the concentration of the acid. Oh, since the volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters, I can calculate the molarity. Molarity is moles divided by liters. So, 0.1665 moles divided by 0.5 L. Let me calculate that: 0.1665 / 0.5 is 0.333 M. So the concentration is 0.333 M HClO.

Now, because it's a weak acid, it doesn't completely dissociate. So I'll set up an ICE table. The initial concentrations are [HClO] = 0.333 M, [H+] = 0, [ClO^-] = 0. The change is that [H+] increases by x, and [HClO] decreases by x, and [ClO^-] also decreases by x. So at equilibrium, [HClO] = 0.333 - x, [H+] = x, and [ClO^-] = x.

The Ka expression is Ka = [H+][ClO^-]/[HClO]. Plugging in the values: 3.0e-4 = (x)(x)/(0.333 - x). So, 3e-4 = x²/(0.333 - x).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if I can assume x is negligible here. Let me think about the approximate value. If x is small compared to 0.333, then 0.333 - x ≈ 0.333. So the equation simplifies to x² = 3e-4 * 0.333. Let's compute that: 3e-4 is 0.0003, multiplied by 0.333 is about 0.0001. So x² ≈ 1e-4 → x ≈ 0.01. But wait, if x is 0.01, then 0.333 - 0.01 is 0.323, which is a bit less than 0.333. So maybe the approximation isn't perfect, but perhaps it's close enough for a first approximation. Alternatively, maybe I should solve the quadratic equation.

So let's write the equation again. 3e-4 = x²/(0.333 - x). Multiply both sides by denominator:

x² = 3e-4 * (0.333 - x)

Expanding, x² = 0.0001 - 3e-4 x

Bring all terms to one side: x² + 3e-4 x - 0.0001 = 0. 

This is a quadratic equation: a x² + b x + c = 0, where a=1, b=3e-4, c= -0.0001.

Wait, solving quadratics: the quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a).

Plugging in the values:

Discriminant D = (3e-4)^2 -4(1)(-0.0001) = 9e-8 + 0.0004. What's that? 0.0004 is 4e-4. So D is 4e-4 + 9e-8. Let me compute that as 0.0004 + 0.00000009 ≈ 0.00040009.

The square root of D is sqrt(0.00040009). Let me approximate sqrt(0.0004) is 0.02, but since the discriminant is a bit more, maybe 0.02000225 (since (0.02)^2 is 0.0004, and the small increase would lead to a tiny increase in sqrt). Or perhaps it's easier to compute it as 0.02000225. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.02000225 squared would be (0.02 + 0.00000225)^2 ≈ 0.0004 + 2 * 0.02 * 0.00000225 + (0.00000225)^2. The term after 0.0004 is negligible, so D's sqrt is approximately 0.02000225.

So the solutions are x = [ -3e-4 ± 0.02000225 ] / 2.

We can ignore the negative solution because x can't be negative. So the positive solution is (0.02000225 - 0.00003) / 2. Wait, wait. Let me compute the numerator correctly. Because it's -b plus sqrt(D), not minus. So:

- b is -3e-4, which is -0.0003. So:

[ -0.0003 + 0.02000225 ] / 2 → (0.01970225) / 2 → approximately 0.009851125.

So x is about 0.00985 M. Wait, but earlier assumption of x being 0.01 was 0.01, which is higher than this, so the approximation (x << 0.333) may not hold. So perhaps the quadratic solution is better.

So [H+] is approximately 0.00985 M. Then the pH is the negative log of that.

Let me calculate pH: pH = -log10(0.00985). Let me compute that.

log10(0.00985) is the same as log10(9.85e-3). Log10(9.85) is about 0.993, and log10(1e-3) is -3. So 0.993 -3 = -2.007. Taking the negative gives pH ≈ 2.007. So about 2.01.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. The options are:

A:3.5

B:2

C:7.2

D:2.5e-3

E:1.2e-4

F:5.4e-3

G:3.0

H:0.5

I:1

J:1.76

None of the options are exactly 2.01. Hmm. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Did I make a mistake in setting up the equation?

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the dissociation. Let me think again.

HClO is a weak acid: HClO ↔ H+ + ClO^-

The initial concentration is 0.333 M, so when it dissociates, the change is x for both H+ and ClO^-.

So at equilibrium:

[H+] = x

[ClO^-] = x

[HClO] = 0.333 - x

Ka = (x^2)/(0.333 - x) = 3e-4.

So the equation is x²/(0.333 - x) = 3e-4.

Wait, but 3e-4 is 0.0003.

So, x^2 = 0.333 * 3e-4 * (1 - x/0.333)

Wait, perhaps I can't neglect x, so quadratic is necessary.

So, x² = 0.333 * 3e-4 * (1 - x/(0.333)).

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the approximation that x is small compared to 0.333. Let's see, 0.0003 is the numerator. So x^2 is 0.0003 * 0.333 → wait, no. Let me think: 3e-4 is 0.0003, so x² = (0.0003) * (0.333) → 0.0003 * 0.333 = 0.0000999 ≈ 0.0001.

So x ≈ sqrt(0.0001) = 0.01. So x ≈ 0.01.

Wait, but earlier when we solved, we got x about 0.00985, which is a bit less than 0.01. So the initial approximation of x << 0.333 is not entirely correct.

So perhaps a better approach is to use the exact quadratic solution, but wait, I think I did that earlier. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let me re-derive the equation correctly.

Ka = (x^2)/(0.333 - x) = 3e-4. So x² = 3e-4 (0.333 - x).

Yes, that's right. So expanding, x² = 0.0001 - 0.0003 x.

Rearranged: x² + 0.0003 x - 0.0001 = 0.

Wait, that's different from before. Oh! Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in the sign earlier when moving terms.

Wait, x² = 3e-4 * (0.333 - x)

So x² = 0.0003 * (0.333 - x) → x² = 0.0001 - 0.0003 x.

Bringing all terms to one side: x² + 0.0003 x - 0.0001 =0.

So the quadratic equation is x² + 0.0003 x - 0.0001 = 0.

Wait, that's different. Earlier I thought the equation was x² = 3e-4 (0.333 - x), which when expanded is x² = 0.0001 - 0.0003 x. Then moving everything to left side: x² + 0.0003 x - 0.0001 =0. So that's correct.

So using quadratic formula: a=1, b=0.0003, c= -0.0001.

Δ= b² -4ac = (0.0003)^2 -4 * 1 * (-0.0001) = 0.00000009 + 0.0004 = 0.00040009.

√Δ≈ 0.02000225.

So x = [ -0.0003 ± 0.02000225 ] /2.

We take the positive solution: (0.02000225 - 0.0003)/2 → (0.01970225)/2 ≈ 0.009851125.

So x≈0.00985 M. So [H+] is 0.00985 M.

pH = -log(0.00985) →?

Let me compute that. 0.00985 is 9.85e-3.

log(9.85e-3) = log(9.85) + log(1e-3) ≈ 0.993 + (-3) = -2.007.

So pH = - (-2.007) = 2.007. Approximately 2.01.

But looking back at the options, the closest is option B:2.00 something, but the options don't have 2.01. The options are A (3.5), B (2), C (7.2), etc. So option B is 2.0. But our approximation comes to about 2.007, which is a bit over 2.0, closer to 2.01. So the pH would be about 2.01, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider the approximation that x is not negligible. Let's see. If x is about 0.00985, which is 0.985% of 0.333. So it's 0.333 * 0.00985 ≈ 0.0033, which is about 1%. So x is about 1% of the initial concentration. So the approximation may not be that bad, but perhaps it's not that great. Alternatively, perhaps the solution can be considered as a weak acid with a certain [H+].

Wait, but wait, maybe I messed up in the setup. Let's think differently. Another approach is to compute the exact solution.

So x is 0.00985, which is [H+] ≈ 0.00985 M.

So pH is approximately 2.007. Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest is option B: 2.0. But perhaps I should check the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the concentration. Let me double-check.

Molarity is moles divided by liters. 0.1665 moles in 0.5 L. 0.1665 / 0.5 = 0.333 M. That's correct.

Another thought: If the acid is 0.333 M, and Ka is 3e-4, what is the pH. Maybe I can use the approximation that [H+] ≈ sqrt(ka * c) → sqrt(3e-4 * 0.333) → sqrt(0.0001) = 0.01 M. So pH ≈ 2. So the pH is approximately 2, but if I calculate more accurately, it's about 2.007. So the answer would be around 2, but in the options, option B is 2.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about whether the solution is strong or weak. Hypochlorous acid is a weak acid, so we can't assume it's 100% dissociated. So the assumption that x is negligible is only a rough approximation. Hence, the exact solution is about 0.00985 M, leading to pH ≈ 2.007. So the pH is around 2.01, which is 2.01. Among the given options, option B is 2.0, which is the closest. The next option is F:5.4e-3, which is way too low. So the correct answer is probably B.
</think>

To determine the pH of a solution prepared by dissolving 0.1665 moles of hypochlorous acid (HClO) in 500 mL of solution, we start by calculating the molarity of the acid. The molarity is given by:

\[
\text{Molarity} = \frac{\text{moles of acid}}{\text{volume of solution in liters}} = \frac{0.1665}{0.5} = 0.333 \, \text{M}.
\]

HClO is a weak acid, and it dissociates in water as follows:

\[
\text{HClO} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{ClO}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant expression for this dissociation is:

\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{ClO}^-]}{[\text{HClO}]}.
\]

Let the concentration of \([\text{H}^+]\) at equilibrium be \(x\). The initial concentration of HClO is 0.333 M, and at equilibrium, the concentration of HClO is approximately \(0.333 - x\). Substituting into the \(K_a\) expression:

\[
K_a = \frac{x^2}{0.333 - x}.
\]

Given \(K_a = 3.0 \times 10^{-4}\), we substitute and rearrange:

\[
x^2 = (3.0 \times 10^{-4})(0.333 - x).
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
x^2 + 3.0 \times 10^{-4}x - 0.0001 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 3.0 \times 10^{-4}\), and \(c = -0.0001\). Using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta = (3.0 \times 10^{-4})^2 - 4(1)(-0.0001) = 9 \times 10^{-8} + 0.0004 = 0.00040009.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{\Delta} \approx 0.02000225.
\]

The positive root (since \(x\) cannot be negative) is:

\[
x = \frac{-3.0 \times 10^{-4} + 0.02000225}{2} = \frac{0.01970225}{2} \approx 0.00985 \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, \([\text{H}^+] \approx 0.00985 \, \text{M}\). The pH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log_{10}([\text{H}^+]) = -\log_{10}(0.00985).
\]

Breaking this down:

\[
\log_{10}(0.00985) = \log_{10}(9.85 \times 10^{-3}) = \log_{10}(9.85) + \log_{10}(10^{-3}) \approx 0.993 - 3 = -2.007.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = -(-2.007) = 2.007.
\]

The closest option to this value is **B: 2.0**. The other options (e.g., \(F: 5.4 \times 10^{-3}\), \(G: 3.0\), etc.) are far too low or high compared to the calculated pH.
