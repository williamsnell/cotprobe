Okay, so I've got this question here about what kind of goal money is. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

First, I remember that goals can be categorized in different ways, like extrinsic or intrinsic. Extrinsic goals are things you do because they give you a reward, like money. Intrinsic goals are what you do because they bring you personal satisfaction, which is more about the internal motivation. But wait, the question is about what kind of a goal money is. Hmm.

Wait, the options are A to G. Let me list them out:

A: Extrinsic goal  
B: Ultimate goal  
C: Abstract goal  
D: Intrinsic goal  
E: Fundamental goal  
F: Natural goal  
G: Artificial goal

So, the question is about what kind of goal money is. I think intrinsic goals are when you do something because it brings you personal happiness, satisfaction. But does money qualify as an intrinsic goal? Or is it extrinsic because it's a reward?

Wait, intrinsic goals are about the value you get from the goal itself. So, if you earn money, you value that money, so it's an intrinsic goal. But then, is money an extrinsic or intrinsic goal?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Extrinsic goals are things you do because they give you something positive, like money. Intrinsic goals are the ones you do because they make you happy. So money is a reward, hence extrinsic. But wait, another thought: intrinsic goals don't require any reward. You just want something for itself. So, money is extrinsic because it's a reward, but maybe it's also an intrinsic goal because it brings you satisfaction.

Wait, the question is asking what kind of a goal money is. So, if money is extrinsic because it's a reward, that would make option A correct. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the definitions.

Wait, I think intrinsic goals are about what you want in the moment. So, if you earn money, you might think money is what you want. But the question is about the category of the goal, not the content. So, whether it's extrinsic or intrinsic depends on the purpose, not the reward itself.

Wait, but the options include both extrinsic and intrinsic. So, the question is, is money an extrinsic goal or an intrinsic goal? 

Alternatively, I've heard that intrinsic goals are about the satisfaction you get from the goal itself, regardless of what you get. So, money could be seen as intrinsic because it's what you want in the moment. But does that mean it's an intrinsic goal?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question is: What kind of a goal is money? 

Extrinsic goals are things you do for a reward, like money. Intrinsic goals are the ones you do because they bring you satisfaction, regardless of the reward. So, if you earn money, you might think money is extrinsic because it's a reward, but it's also an intrinsic goal because it's what you want.

But the options don't have both. The options are A to G. So, perhaps the answer is that money is an extrinsic goal because it's a reward, but sometimes it's also considered an intrinsic goal because the satisfaction it brings is intrinsic. Wait, but the options don't have an option that combines both. So, maybe the question is referring to the type of goal.

Wait, another angle: 'Intrinsic' refers to the content of the goal. So, if the goal is about the value it brings, it's an intrinsic goal. So, money is intrinsic because it's the value you gain, but it's also extrinsic because it's a reward. So, depending on how it's categorized.

Wait, the question is about what kind of a goal money is. So, if it's an extrinsic goal because you get it for the sake of it, then option A. But I'm not sure because sometimes people use both terms. Alternatively, perhaps 'intrinsic' is correct because money is what you want, and that's intrinsic.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the definitions again.

Extrinsic: things you do because they give you a reward. Intrinsic: things you do because they make you happy or satisfied, regardless of the reward.

So, money is an extrinsic goal because you get it for the sake of it. But it's also an intrinsic goal because it's what you want. However, the options don't have both. So, perhaps the answer is that money is an extrinsic goal because it's a reward, and an intrinsic goal because it's about satisfaction.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that combines both. So, maybe the question is referring to the type of goal, not the content. So, perhaps the answer is that it's an extrinsic goal because it's a reward, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is that money is an extrinsic goal because it's a reward.

Wait, but the options are A to G. So, let me check the options again:

A: Extrinsic goal  
B: Ultimate goal  
C: Abstract goal  
D: Intrinsic goal  
E: Fundamental goal  
F: Natural goal  
G: Artificial goal

So, the options are about types of goals. So, if money is an extrinsic goal because it's a reward, then answer A. But wait, is money an extrinsic goal or an intrinsic goal?

Wait, the question is, what kind of a goal is money? So, if you earn money, it's an extrinsic goal because you get it for the reward. But sometimes, people might see it as an intrinsic goal because it's the content of the goal. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting thoughts.

Wait, another angle: intrinsic goals are about what you want, regardless of what you get. So, if you earn money, you might think that money is an intrinsic goal because it's what you want. So, the answer would be D: Intrinsic goal.

But wait, I'm not sure. I think intrinsic goals are about the value, not the reward. So, if you earn money, you might feel that money is an intrinsic goal because it's the value you want. So, the answer would be D.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simpler. Extrinsic goals are things you do because they give a reward, so money is an extrinsic goal. But sometimes, people confuse intrinsic and extrinsic. So, the answer might be A.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to recall. I think intrinsic goals are about the content, like the happiness you get from doing something. So, money, which is what you earn, is an intrinsic goal because you get satisfaction from it. So, the answer would be D.

Wait, but the question is asking what kind of a goal is money, not what the content is. So, the category is extrinsic or intrinsic.

Wait, the question is a bit tricky because it's asking for the goal type, not the specific content. So, if you earn money, it's extrinsic because it's a reward. But some people might see it as intrinsic because it's what you want. So, perhaps both options A and D could be correct.

Wait, but the options are given as separate choices, so only one can be correct. So, perhaps the answer is that money is an extrinsic goal because it's a reward, but sometimes it's also considered an intrinsic goal because it's what you want. But the options don't have a combined option.

Wait, maybe the answer is A: Extrinsic goal. Because money is a reward, so you do it for the sake of it, making it an extrinsic goal.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think intrinsic goals are about the content, not the reward. So, money is an extrinsic goal because it's a reward. But from the perspective of the goal itself, it's an intrinsic goal because it's the value you want. So, perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, maybe the question is designed to trick you into thinking it's extrinsic. So, the answer is A.

The question asks what kind of goal money is. 

- **Extrinsic goal (A)**: This refers to goals achieved for the sake of a reward, like money.
- **Intrinsic goal (D)**: This refers to goals driven by personal satisfaction, which money is, as it brings satisfaction.

However, money is more commonly seen as an **extrinsic goal** because it is a reward given for doing something. While it is an intrinsic goal because it satisfies personal happiness, the primary category in common usage is extrinsic. 

Answer: A
