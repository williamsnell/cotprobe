Okay, so I've got this gas problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the volume that 10.0 grams of a gas will occupy under standard conditions. I need to use the ideal gas law, I think. Let me recall what I know.

The question gives me the density of the gas as 0.222 g/L at 20.0°C and 800 torr. Wait, I think density is mass per volume. So if I have 0.222 grams per liter, that's density. But wait, the problem asks for the volume under standard conditions. Standard conditions, I think, are 0°C and 1 atm pressure. Oh right, but wait, I should check the conditions given and what's needed.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the molar mass of the gas. Oh, maybe I can calculate it from the given data. Because if I can find the molar mass, I can relate the initial conditions to the conditions under standard conditions.

So let's see. The initial conditions are 20.0°C and 800 torr. Let me convert those to appropriate units. Temperature is in Celsius, so I'll convert to Kelvin. 20.0°C = 293.15 K. The pressure is in torr. I remember that 1 atm is 760 torr, so 800 torr is 800 /760 atm. Let me compute that: 800 ÷760 is approximately 1.0526 atm.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to keep everything in the same units. Or, alternatively, I can switch to standard conditions. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, but maybe using the combined gas law would be better since we're dealing with two states.

Alternatively, I can use the ideal gas law in the form PV = nRT, and then relate the two states. Since the number of moles (n) is the same, and R is a constant, maybe I can relate the initial and final states.

But perhaps another approach is to look at the density. Density is mass over volume, so mass = density × volume. Oh wait, the initial density is 0.222 g/L, which is given. So the mass of 10.0 g is 10.0 g / 0.222 g/L ≈ 45.045 L. But wait, that's volume under initial conditions. But the question is asking about the volume under standard conditions. So I need to find the volume under standard conditions (0°C, 1 atm) for 10.0 g.

Wait, but the problem is that the initial conditions are 20°C and 800 torr. So I might need to convert the conditions to standard conditions.

Alternatively, I can find the molar mass using the ideal gas law. Let's think: the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Rearranging, n = PV/(RT). And n is the number of moles.

But wait, I have the density given. Density is mass over volume, which is m/V. So m = d * V. So substituting into n gives (dV) / V = (d) = (d * V) / V = d. Hmm, not sure that's helpful. Alternatively, since m = d * V, and n = m/M, where M is molar mass. So substituting, n = (d * V) / M.

Putting that into the ideal gas equation: PV = nRT → PV = (d V / M) RT → PV = (d V RT)/M → P = (d RT)/M.

So, M = (d RT)/P.

Wait, let me recheck that. Starting from PV = nRT and n = m/M = (d V)/M. So PV = (d V / M) RT → P = (d RT)/M → M = (d RT)/P.

Yes, that makes sense. So M = (d R T) / P. 

Wait, the variables are d = 0.222 g/L, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T is 293.15 K (since 20°C is 293.15), and P is 800 torr, which I need to convert to atm. 800 torr is 800/760 atm ≈ 1.05263 atm.

So plugging in the numbers:

M = (0.222 g/L * 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 293.15 K) / (1.05263 atm)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute numerator: 0.222 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.01822. Then multiply by 293.15 → 0.01822 * 293.15 ≈ 5.343 (approximate).

Denominator is 1.05263 atm.

So M ≈ 5.343 / 1.05263 ≈ 5.07 g/mol.

Wait, but wait, let me do the exact calculations.

0.222 * 0.0821 = 0.0182142

0.0182142 * 293.15 = let me compute:

0.0182142 * 293.15 ≈ 5.346 (since 0.018 * 293 = 5.274, and 0.00042142 * 293 ≈ 0.1233, so 5.274 + 0.1233 ≈ 5.3973?)

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

0.0182142 * 293.15:

Compute 0.0182142 * 293.15 = ?

Let me compute 0.0182142 * 293.15:

293.15 * 0.0182142.

Compute 293.15 * 0.018 = 5.2767

293.15 * 0.0002142 = let's see:

0.0002 * 293.15= 0.05863
0.0000142 * 293.15 ≈ 0.004174
Total ≈ 0.05863 + 0.004174 = 0.062804
So sum with 5.2767: 5.2767 + 0.0628 ≈5.3395.

So the numerator is approximately 5.3395 g·atm/(mol).

Denominator is 1.05263 atm.

So M = 5.3395 / 1.05263 ≈ 5.07 g/mol.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Because the units should be g/mol. So yeah, M is approximately 5.07 g/mol.

Wait, but if the density is 0.222 g/L, and the molar mass is 5.07 g/mol, then the molar volume is M / P (since PV = nRT → V= nRT/P → but if M is in mol/g, no, wait. Wait, the molar volume is (M RT) / P.

Wait, let me think again. The molar volume is (P V) = (n R T) → V = (n R T)/P. But n = m/M → V = (m M R T) / (M P) ) → V= (m R T)/P.

Wait, but that's not the molar volume. Because m is mass, so for a given mass, the volume is (MRT)/(P). So molar volume is (M R T)/P.

Wait, but let me plug the numbers in correctly.

Wait, M is 5.07 g/mol, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, T is 293.15 K, P is 1.05263 atm.

So molar volume V_m is (5.07 g/mol) * (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 293.15 K) / (1.05263 atm) 

Let me calculate numerator: 5.07 *0.0821=0.4166 (approximate). 0.4166 * 293.15 ≈ 121.8. Then divide by 1.05263 → 121.8 /1.05263 ≈ 115.4 L/mol.

Wait, that seems high, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

5.07 * 0.0821 = 0.416687 g·L·atm/(mol·K) * K → 0.416687 g·L·atm/mol.

Multiply by T (293.15) → 0.416687 *293.15 = let's compute.

0.4 * 293.15 = 117.26; 0.016687 *293.15 ≈ approx 4.92. So total ≈ 122.18.

Divide by P (1.05263 atm): 122.18 / 1.05263 ≈ 115.8 L/mol.

So V_m ≈ 115.8 L/mol.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, let me use an exact calculation.

M = (0.222 * 0.0821 * 293.15) / (1.05263) 

Compute numerator:

0.222 * 0.0821 = 0.0182142

0.0182142 * 293.15 = let me compute more accurately.

293.15 * 0.0182142:

Break it down:

293 * 0.0182142 = let me compute:

0.0182142 * 200 = 3.64284
0.0182142 * 93 = 1.69679
Total: 3.64284 + 1.69679 = 5.33963

But wait, 293.15 is 293 + 0.15.

So 0.0182142 * 0.15 = 0.00273213.

So 5.33963 + 0.00273213 = 5.34236.

Denominator is 1.05263.

So M = 5.34236 / 1.05263 ≈ 5.07 g/mol.

Wait, that's the same as before. So V_m = (5.07 * 0.0821 * 293.15) / 1.05263.

Wait, but earlier I think I made a mistake. Wait, no, V_m is (M R T) / P, which is (5.07 g/mol * 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 293.15 K) / 1.05263 atm.

So that's (5.07 * 0.0821 *293.15) / 1.05263.

Wait, but 5.07 *0.0821 is 0.416687.

0.416687 * 293.15 = let's calculate that exactly.

293.15 * 0.416687:

Let me compute 293 * 0.416687, and then 0.15 * 0.416687.

293 * 0.416687 = (293 * 0.4) + (293 * 0.016687)
= 117.2 + (293 * 0.016687)
Compute 293 * 0.016687:

0.016687 * 293 = 4.901 (approx.)

So 117.2 +4.901 = 122.101.

Then 0.15 *0.416687 = 0.062503.

So total is 122.101 + 0.062503 = 122.1635.

Now, 122.1635 divided by 1.05263.

122.1635 / 1.05263 ≈ let me compute.

Compute 1.05263 * 115 = 120.52495 (1.05263 *100=105.263; 1.05263*15=15.78945 → 105.263+15.78945=121.05245; 1.05263*115=121.05245, but we have 122.1635, so 115 + (122.1635-121.05245)/1.05263.

122.1635 -121.05245 =1.11105.

1.11105 /1.05263 ≈1.053.

So 115 + 1.053 ≈116.053.

Wait, but that can't be right. Or maybe I should do decimal division.

Alternatively, perhaps a calculator approach.

But perhaps I should proceed numerically.

1.05263 × 116 = 1.05263*(100 +16) = 105.263 +16.842 →122.105.

Wait, 105.263 +16.842 is 122.105. But our numerator is 122.1635.

So 116 gives 122.105, which is 0.0585 less than 122.1635. So how much more?

0.0585 /1.05263 ≈0.0556.

So total is approximately 116.0556 L/mol.

So the molar volume is approximately 116.06 L/mol.

Wait, but wait, I thought earlier that the molar volume was about 115-116 L/mol. So if I have 10.0 g, and the density is 0.222 g/L, then the volume under standard conditions is 10.0 / 0.222 ≈45.045 L under initial conditions. But wait, the question is, what volume under standard conditions?

Wait, no. Wait, the problem is about finding the volume of 10.0 g of gas under standard conditions. So perhaps another approach would be better.

Alternative approach: Using the ideal gas law for initial conditions and then scaling to standard conditions.

The ideal gas law is PV = nRT.

Number of moles (n) = mass / molar mass (M).

So, n = 10.0 g / M.

But we can also express using the initial conditions: P_initial V_initial = n R T_initial.

So,

P_initial * V_initial = (m_initial / M) * R * T_initial.

We can rearrange for M:

M = (m_initial * R * T_initial) / (P_initial * V_initial).

But wait, m_initial is 10.0 g, which is d_initial * V_initial. Here, d_initial is 0.222 g/L, so V_initial is 10.0 /0.222 ≈45.045 L.

Wait, but that's the same V_initial as before, which is under initial conditions. But we need to find the volume under standard conditions (T=273.15 K, P=1 atm).

So, under standard conditions, the volume V_standard would have:

P_standard * V_standard = (m_initial / M) * R * T_standard.

But since M is unknown, maybe using the initial conditions to find the ratio.

Let me think:

Under initial conditions, PV = nRT → P1 V1 = (m1/M) R T1.

Under standard conditions, P2 V2 = (m1/M) R T2.

Dividing the two equations:

(P1 V1) / (P2 V2) ) = (T2 / T1 )

Because (m1/M) R cancels out.

So, V2 = V1 * (P1 T2) / (P2 T1 )

Wait, let me write that correctly.

V2 = (P1 V1 T2) / (P2 T1 )

So,

V2 = V1 * (P1 / P2) * (T2 / T1 )

In this problem, V1 is 45.045 L (from 0.222 g/L *45 L).

But I'm looking for V2 under standard conditions (1 atm, 273.15 K).

So,

V2 = 45.045 L * (1.00000 atm / 1.00000 atm) * (273.15 K / 293.15 K)

Because P1 and P2 are both 800 torr and 1 atm respectively. Wait, no, initial conditions are 800 torr, standard is 1 atm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, the initial conditions are P1 = 800 torr, V1 = ?

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the problem using the initial conditions to find the volume under standard conditions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to set up the ratio using the initial conditions and the standard conditions.

Let me think again. The initial conditions are P_i = 800 torr, V_i = ?

Wait, no, the initial conditions are P_i = 800 torr, V_i = ?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of it as:

We have 10.0 g of gas. The density under initial conditions is 0.222 g/L, so the volume under initial conditions is V1 = (10.0 g) / 0.222 g/L ≈45.045 L.

Under initial conditions, the pressure is 800 torr.

Under standard conditions (0°C, 1 atm), the pressure is 1 atm, and the volume is V2, which we need to find.

So, using the ideal gas law for both conditions:

At initial conditions: P1 V1 = n R T1.

At standard conditions: P2 V2 = n R T2.

Dividing the two equations:

(P1 V1) / (P2 V2) ) = (T2 / T1 )

But n is the same in both cases, so n cancels.

So,

V2 = V1 * (P1 T2) / (P2 T1 )

Plugging in the values:

V2 =45.045 L * (800 torr *273.15 K) / (1 atm * 293.15 K )

Compute numerator and denominator.

First, handle the pressure part. Both P1 and P2 are in the same units? No, P1 is 800 torr, P2 is 1 atm. Not in same units, so I can't directly compute. So I need to convert them to same units.

We can convert 800 torr to atm.

As I did before, 800 torr = 800 /760 atm ≈1.05263 atm.

So,

Numerator becomes 1.05263 atm * 273.15 K.

Denominator is 1 atm * 293.15 K.

So,

V2 =45.045 L * (1.05263 *273.15) / (1 * 293.15 )

Compute the terms:

1.05263 *273.15 = let me compute.

1 *273.15=273.15.

0.05263*273.15≈ let me compute 273.15 *0.05=13.6575, 0.00263 *273.15≈0.7152. So total ≈13.6575 +0.7152≈14.3727.

So 1.05263 *273.15 ≈273.15 +14.3727 ≈287.5227 atm·K.

Denominator is 293.15 K.

So,

V2 =45.045 L * (287.5227) / (293.15 )

Compute 287.5227 /293.15 ≈0.981.

So,

V2 ≈45.045 L *0.981 ≈44.14 L.

Wait, but none of the options are around 44. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the ratio.

Wait, let me compute (1.05263 *273.15) / (1 *293.15) 

= (1.05263 *273.15) /293.15.

= (1.05263) * (273.15 /293.15).

= 1.05263 * (0.9323).

Because 273.15 /293.15 ≈0.9323.

1.05263 *0.9323.

Compute 1 *0.9323 =0.9323.

0.05263 *0.9323≈approx 0.0490.

So total ≈0.9323 +0.0490≈0.9813.

So, as before, V2≈45.045 *0.9813 ≈44.14 L.

Hmm, but the options given are A) 100, B) 105, C) 110, D)115, E)120.

Wait, none of these are around 44. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Alternative approach: Find the molar volume under initial conditions, then find the volume under standard.

Wait, let me think again.

Using the initial conditions: P_i =800 torr, V_i=45.045 L, T_i= 293.15 K.

Molar volume V_m = V_i /n = V_i / (d_i * V_i / M) )

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, since n = m/M, and m = d_i * V_i.

So,

n = (d_i * V_i) / M.

So,

V_m = V_i / (n) = V_i / [ (d_i V_i) / M ) ] = M / d_i.

So,

V_m = M / d_i.

But M is 5.07 g/mol.

So,

V_m =5.07 g/mol / 0.222 g/L → (5.07 /0.222) L/mol → approximately 22.8 L/mol.

So, molar volume under initial conditions is 22.8 L/mol.

Under standard conditions, the molar volume is V_m_std= V_m * (T_i / T_f) * (P_f / P_i )

Wait, perhaps a better approach. Since the molar volume changes when changing the conditions, perhaps using the ideal gas law to find the volume.

Wait, let me think again.

The ideal gas law is PV = nRT.

Let me express the ratio of the two conditions.

Let me call the initial conditions as condition 1, and standard conditions as condition 2.

Condition 1: P1, V1, T1.

Condition 2: P2, V2, T2.

We can write:

n = m/M = (d1 V1)/M.

So,

n = (0.222 g/L *45.045 L)/M → (10.0 g)/M → M =10.0 g /n.

But perhaps better to express in terms of the ideal gas law.

For condition 1: P1 V1 = n R T1.

For condition 2: P2 V2 = n R T2.

Dividing condition 2 by condition 1:

(P2 V2) / (P1 V1) ) = (T2 / T1 )

Solving for V2:

V2 = V1 * (P1 / P2) * (T2 / T1 )

We have:

V1 =45.045 L,

P1=800 torr,

P2=1 atm,

T1=293.15 K,

T2=273.15 K.

So,

V2=45.045 L * (800 torr /1 atm) * (273.15 K /293.15 K )

Compute each part.

800 torr /1 atm = (800/760) atm ≈1.05263 atm.

273.15/293.15≈0.9323.

So,

V2=45.045 L *1.05263 *0.9323.

Compute 1.05263 *0.9323 ≈0.9813.

So,

V2=45.045 L *0.9813 ≈44.14 L.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of M. Let me check that again.

M was calculated as (0.222 *0.0821 *293.15) /1.05263.

Wait, let me do it again.

Compute numerator: 0.222 *0.0821 *293.15.

Compute 0.222 *0.0821 = 0.0182142.

Multiply by 293.15: 0.0182142 *293.15.

Compute 0.0182142 *293.15:

Well, 0.0182142 *293.15 = let's compute each step.

0.0182142 *200=3.64284.

0.0182142 *93=1.69679.

So 3.64284 +1.69679=5.33963.

Then, 0.0182142 *0.15=0.00273213.

So total is 5.33963 +0.00273213=5.34236.

Now, divide that by 1.05263: 5.34236 /1.05263.

Let me compute this division.

Approximately, 1.05263 *5 =5.26315.

So, 5.34236 -5.26315=0.07921.

So, how much more than 5 is 5.34236 divided by 1.05263?

0.07921 /1.05263 ≈0.0753.

So total is 5 +0.0753=5.0753.

So M ≈5.075 g/mol.

So, V_m = M/d_i =5.075 /0.222 ≈22.95 L/mol.

Then, under standard conditions, V2 = V_m * (T2 / T1) * (P2/P1 )

Wait, no. Alternatively, V2 = V_m * (T2/T1) * (P2/P1) * (P_initial / P_final).

Wait, perhaps not. Let me get back to the correct formula.

Wait, when you have two sets of conditions, the ratio of V2/V1 can be found using the ratio of (T2/T1) and (P2/P1), but multiplied by (P1/P2) and (T1/T2). Or perhaps I should think about the formula again.

The correct formula is:

V2 = V1 * (P1/(P2)) * (T2/(T1)) )

Wait, no, let me think again.

The correct formula for the ratio of V2/V1 is:

V2/V1 = (T2 * P2) / (T1 * P1) ) * (V1 / V1 )

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think of the formula again.

Wait, the correct formula is:

V2/V1 = (T2 / T1) * (P2 / P1 )

Wait, no, that can't be right. For example, if you are at the same pressure but different temperatures, then V2/V1 = T2/T1.

But if you are at the same temperature but different pressures, then V2/V1 = P2/P1.

But when both pressure and temperature change, the ratio is the product of the two ratios.

So, V2/V1 = (T2/T1) * (P2/P1 )

So,

V2 = V1 * (T2/T1) * (P2/P1 )

But wait, in our case, we have initial conditions (P1, V1, T1) and want to find V2 under standard conditions (P2, V2, T2).

So,

V2 = V1 * (P2/P1) * (T2/T1 )

Wait, that seems correct.

So,

V2 =45.045 L * (1 atm /800 torr) * (273.15 K /293.15 K )

Compute each part:

1 atm /800 torr = (1 atm) / (1.05263 atm) ) ≈0.9494.

Wait, because 800 torr is 1 atm, so 1 atm is 800 torr.

Wait, so 1 atm /800 torr =1/1 =1.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because 800 torr is 1 atm, so 1 atm =800 torr.

So, 1 atm /800 torr =1/1=1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if 800 torr is 1 atm, then 1 atm is 800 torr.

Wait, so 1 atm /800 torr = (1 atm) / (1 atm) ) =1.

Wait, so that's correct. So (P2/P1 )= (1 atm) / (800 torr) )= (1 atm) / (1 atm) )=1.

Wait, no, wait. If 800 torr is 1 atm, then 1 atm is 800 torr.

So, 1 atm =800 torr.

So, 1 atm /800 torr = (1 atm) / (1 atm) )=1.

Wait, so (P2/P1 )=1.

Wait, but that can't be correct because if 800 torr is 1 atm, then 1 atm =800 torr, so 1 atm /800 torr =1.

Hmm, that's correct. So (P2/P1 )=1.

Then, (T2/T1 )=273.15/293.15≈0.9323.

So,

V2=45.045 L *1 *0.9323 ≈45.045 *0.9323 ≈42.03 L.

Hmm, but none of the options are near 42. So I must be making a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Use the ideal gas law with the initial conditions and compute the molar volume, then use Avogadro's number to find the number of moles, then compute the volume under standard conditions.

Wait, let's try that.

The ideal gas law is PV = nRT.

The initial conditions are P_initial =800 torr, V_initial=45.045 L, T_initial=293.15 K.

We can find n_initial = (P_initial * V_initial) / (R * T_initial )

Then, under standard conditions, V_standard = (n_initial * R * T_standard) / P_standard.

So,

V_standard = ( (P_initial * V_initial) / (R T_initial ) ) * ( R T_standard ) / P_standard )

Simplify:

V_standard = (P_initial * V_initial * R * T_standard ) / ( R T_initial * P_standard )

The R cancels.

So,

V_standard = (P_initial * V_initial * T_standard ) / ( T_initial * P_standard )

Which is the same as:

V_standard = V_initial * ( P_initial / P_standard ) * ( T_standard / T_initial )

So,

V_standard =45.045 L * (800 torr /1 atm ) * (273.15 K /293.15 K )

Compute each part:

800 torr /1 atm =1.

273.15/293.15≈0.9323.

So,

V_standard =45.045 L *1 *0.9323≈42.03 L.

Again, same result.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of M. Let me recalculate M.

M = (0.222 g/L *0.0821 L·atm/mol·K *293.15 K ) / (1.05263 atm )

Compute numerator:

0.222 *0.0821 =0.0182142.

Multiply by 293.15: 0.0182142 *293.15 ≈5.34236.

Divide by 1.05263: 5.34236 /1.05263≈5.075.

So M=5.075 g/mol.

So V_m =5.075 /0.222≈22.95 L/mol.

Thus, under standard conditions, V_standard =22.95 L/mol * (273.15/293.15) →22.95 *0.9323≈21.25 L/mol.

But how does that help me? Oh, wait, under standard conditions, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT, but the pressure is 1 atm, so V = nRT/P.

But n is the initial number of moles. So,

n = m/M = (0.222 g/L *45.045 L) /5.075 g/mol.

Compute numerator: 0.222 *45.045≈10.000 g.

So,

n ≈10.000 g /5.075 g/mol≈1.968 mol.

Under standard conditions, V = nRT/P.

n=1.968 mol,

R=0.0821 L·atm/mol·K,

T=293.15 K,

P=1 atm.

So,

V =1.968 *0.0821 *293.15 /1.

Compute this:

1.968 *0.0821 =0.16145.

0.16145 *293.15≈47.34 L.

Wait, so V≈47.34 L.

But the options are 100, 105, 110, 115, 120.

So, 47 L is not among them. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the initial conditions to find the volume under standard conditions, considering that the pressure changes.

Wait, another approach: Using the ideal gas law, find the number of moles, then compute the volume under standard conditions.

So,

At initial conditions, P1=800 torr, V1=45.045 L, T1=293.15 K.

Number of moles n = P1 V1 / (R T1 )

But n = (P1 V1) / (R T1 )

Then, under standard conditions, V2 = n R T2 / P2.

So,

V2 = (P1 V1 / (R T1 )) * ( R T2 / P2 )

Simplify:

V2 = (P1 V1 R T2 ) / ( R T1 P2 )

Cancel R:

V2 = (P1 V1 T2 ) / ( T1 P2 )

So,

V2 = (800 torr * 45.045 L *273.15 K ) / (293.15 K *1 atm )

Compute numerator: 800 *45.045 =36036. 36036 *273.15=?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute as:

(800 torr) / (1 atm) =1 torr/atm.

So,

V2 =45.045 L * (800 /1) * (273.15 /293.15 )

Which, as before, gives 45.045 *1 *0.9323 ≈42.03 L.

Hmm, same result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have converted the pressure to the same units before computing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me try to compute again.

Wait, let me think about the formula again.

V2 = V1 * (P2 / P1) * (T2 / T1 )

But when pressure is in different units, perhaps I should convert them to the same units.

Wait, in our case, P1 is 800 torr, P2 is 1 atm.

I need to convert them to the same units.

So, 1 atm=760 torr.

So, P2=1 atm=760 torr.

So, P1=800 torr.

So, (P2/P1 )=760/800=0.95.

Wait, no, that's incorrect. Because 760 torr is 1 atm, so 1 atm=760 torr.

So, 1 atm is 760 torr, so 1 atm=760 torr.

So, P1=800 torr, P2=760 torr.

So, (P2/P1 )=760 /800=0.95.

Ah, that's correct.

Wait, so I think I made a mistake in my earlier calculation by using 1 atm for P1, which should be 760 torr.

So, let me redo the calculation with that correction.

So,

P1=800 torr,

P2=760 torr.

(T2=273.15 K, T1=293.15 K)

So,

V2 = V1 * (P2 / P1) * (T2 / T1 )

=45.045 L * (760 torr /800 torr) * (273.15 K /293.15 K )

Compute each part:

760/800=0.95.

273.15/293.15≈0.9323.

So,

V2=45.045 L *0.95 *0.9323.

Compute 0.95 *0.9323=0.887.

So,

V2=45.045 *0.887≈40.0 L.

Hmm, still not matching any of the options.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.95 *0.9323.

0.95 *0.9323=0.887.

So,

45.045 *0.887.

Compute 45 *0.887=45 *0.8=36, 45 *0.08=3.6, 45 *0.007=0.315. So 0.887.

So 45 *0.887=40.415.

But wait, 45.045 *0.887.

So, let's compute 45.045 *0.887.

Well, compute 45 *0.887=40.415.

Then, 0.045 *0.887≈0.040.

So total≈40.415 +0.040=40.455 L.

So V2≈40.455 L.

But again, none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the initial molar volume under standard conditions.

Wait, the molar volume under standard conditions is 22.71 L/mol.

Wait, but perhaps I can use that.

So, under standard conditions, V_standard =nRT.

But n= m/M = (0.222 g/L *45.045 L) /5.075 g/mol.

Compute numerator:0.222 *45.045≈10.000 g.

So, n=10.000 g /5.075 g/mol≈1.968 mol.

T=293.15 K.

So, V= nRT/P.

n=1.968 mol,

R=8.314 J/mol·K,

T=293.15 K,

P=1 atm.

So,

V=1.968 *8.314 *293.15 /1.

Compute 1.968 *8.314=16.40.

Then, 16.40 *293.15= ?

Compute 16 *293=4688.

0.4 *293=116.8.

So 4688 +116.8=4804.8.

So, V≈4804.8 L.

Wait, that's way too big. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the initial conditions to compute the molar volume under standard conditions.

Wait, the initial conditions are P=800 torr, V=45.045 L, T=293.15 K.

The molar volume under standard conditions is 22.71 L/mol.

So, n= (P V) / (R T) = (800 torr *45.045 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K *293.15 K )

But units are in torr and L.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using the formula:

V2 = (P1 V1 T2 ) / ( T1 P2 )

Which we have already calculated as 40.45 L.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the volume under standard conditions if the pressure is 1 atm, but perhaps in some way the pressure is converted to a standard temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should have converted the pressure to standard units.

Wait, but I think I have already done that.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of M.

Wait, let me recalculate M.

M = (P_initial * V_initial) / ( R * T_initial )

Wait, no, M is molar mass, which is mass per mole.

So,

n= m/M = (P_initial V_initial) / ( R T_initial )

Wait, n is m/V.

Wait, so,

n = (P_initial V_initial) / ( R T_initial )

So,

n = (800 torr *45.045 L) / ( 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K *293.15 K )

Compute numerator:800 *45.045=36036 torr L.

Denominator:0.0821 *293.15=23.99 (L·atm/mol).

So,

n=36036 /23.99 =1500. L/mol.

Wait, but earlier I calculated M as5.075 g/mol.

Wait, perhaps I confused molar mass with density.

Wait, perhaps I should have calculated n as grams/(moles per gram).

Wait, M is grams per mole.

So, if n is in moles, and the mass is in grams, then n = grams / M.

So, in our case,

n = ( P_initial * V_initial ) / ( R * T_initial )

So,

n = (800 torr *45.045 L) / (0.0821 *293.15 )

Compute numerator:800 *45.045=36036 torr L.

Denominator:0.0821 *293.15≈23.99 (L torr / atm).

Wait, because 1 atm=10^4 Pa, so 1 atm=10^4 mmHg.

Wait, so 1 atm=10^4 torr.

So, 1 torr=0.01 atm.

So, torr * L = L torr.

So, denominator:0.0821 L·atm/mol *293.15 K ≈23.99 (L torr/mol).

So,

n=36036 /23.99≈1500 mol.

Wait, but that can't be correct because 36036 /23.99≈1500.

Wait, no, 23.99 *1500≈35985.

So, 36036-35985≈51.

So, 1500 +51/23.99≈1500+2.2≈1502.2.

Hmm, so n≈1502.2 mol.

Wait, but that would imply a very large n, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps I should have converted torr to atm.

So, n= (800 torr *45.045 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K *293.15 K )

Compute numerator:800 *45.045=36036 torr L.

Denominator:0.0821 *293.15=23.99 (L·atm/mol).

But since 1 atm=100 torr, so 1 torr=0.01 atm.

So, 36036 torr L=36036 *0.01 atm L=360.36 atm L.

Wait, no. Wait, wait: 1 torr =0.000434 atm.

Wait, because 1 atm=100 torr, so 1 torr=0.01 atm.

Wait, no, 1 torr=0.000083334 atm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute in terms of L·atm.

Wait, 800 torr =800 *0.000086953 atm=0.00006956 atm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute:

n= (800 torr *45.045 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K *293.15 K )

But since 1 atm=100 torr, 800 torr=8 atm.

So, 8 atm *45.045 L =360.36 L·atm.

Denominator:0.0821 *293.15 ≈23.99 L·atm/mol.

So,

n=360.36 /23.99 ≈15.00 mol.

Ah, that makes more sense.

So, n=15.00 mol.

So, then, V_standard =n R T /P.

Wait, but wait, V_standard =n R T / P.

But in this case, P is in atm, and V_standard is in L.

So,

V=15.00 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K *293.15 K / (1 atm)

Compute numerator:15.00 *0.0821=0.34815.

0.34815 *293.15≈99.3 L.

So, V≈99.3 L.

Hmm, which is approximately 100 L, which is option A.

Wait, but the initial calculation when I thought I had 40 L was incorrect because of unit conversion. So perhaps the correct answer is 100 L.

Wait, let me recheck.

First, compute n: n=15.00 mol.

Then, V= n R T / P.

Which is 15 *0.0821 *293.15 /1.

Compute 15 *0.0821=0.34815.

0.34815 *293.15≈99.3 L.

So, yes, V≈99.3 L, which is approximately 100 L.

So, the answer should be option A) 100.0 L.
</think>

To determine the volume of gas under standard conditions, we use the ideal gas law. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Identify the given values:**
   - Initial pressure: \( P_1 = 800 \, \text{torr} \)
   - Initial volume: \( V_1 = 45.045 \, \text{L} \)
   - Initial temperature: \( T_1 = 293.15 \, \text{K} \)
   - Standard pressure: \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{atm} \)
   - Standard temperature: \( T_2 = 293.15 \, \text{K} \)

2. **Calculate the number of moles (\( n \)) using the ideal gas law:**
   \[
   n = \frac{P_1 \cdot V_1}{R \cdot T_1}
   \]
   - \( P_1 = 800 \, \text{torr} \), \( V_1 = 45.045 \, \text{L} \), \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/mol·K} \), \( T_1 = 293.15 \, \text{K} \)
   - First, convert \( P_1 \) to atm: \( 1 \, \text{atm} = 100 \, \text{torr} \), so \( 800 \, \text{torr} = 8 \, \text{atm} \).
   - Now, calculate \( n \):
     \[
     n = \frac{8 \, \text{atm} \cdot 45.045 \, \text{L}}{0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/mol·K} \cdot 293.15 \, \text{K}} \approx 15 \, \text{mol}
     \]

3. **Calculate the standard volume (\( V_2 \)) using \( n \), \( P_2 \), \( T_2 \):**
   \[
   V_2 = \frac{n \cdot R \cdot T_2}{P_2}
   \]
   - \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{atm} \)
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     V_2 = \frac{15 \, \text{mol} \cdot 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/mol·K} \cdot 293.15 \, \text{K}}{1 \, \text{atm}} \approx 99.3 \, \text{L}
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   The volume under standard conditions is approximately \( 100.0 \, \text{L} \), which corresponds to option A.

ANSWER: 100.0 L
