Okay, so I've got this question about telescopes and their focal lengths. Hmm, let's think through this step by step. I remember that telescopes use an eyepiece to magnify the image of a distant object. The magnification is calculated by the formula M = f_o + f_e. Oh wait, no, I think it's M = (f_o) / (f_e), where f_o is the focal length of the telescope and f_e is the focal length of the eyepiece. Or maybe it's the sum when the object is at a certain distance. Wait, no, for a normal telescope, the eyepiece is used to view a distant object. The formula for magnification is M = (f_t - f_e) / f_e, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the magnification formula. Magnification M is equal to the ratio of the telescope's focal length to the eyepiece's focal length. Oh right, because when you have a telescope, the magnification (also called the magnifying power) is given by M = f_t / f_e. So, M = telescope focal length / eyepiece focal length.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Another way: if the telescope's focal length is F, and the eyepiece is f, then the magnification M is F / f. Because the telescope's focal length is the sum of the eyepiece and the objective's focal length. Wait, no, the telescope's focal length is the sum of the eyepiece and the objective's? Wait, no, I think the telescope's focal length (F) is the sum of the objective's focal length (f_t) and the eyepiece's focal length (f_e). Because the objective (telescope part) is much longer, so F = f_t + f_e. So when you use the eyepiece to look at a distant object, the magnification is F / f_e. Because the image is being viewed through the eyepiece, and the magnification is the ratio of the telescope's size to the eyepiece's magnification.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula again. The magnification (M) is given by M = (f_t) / (f_e). Because if you have a telescope with a focal length F, and an eyepiece with focal length f, then M = F/f. So the question says that the telescope has a focal length of 25 feet. Wait, but that's a lot. Let me double-check the units. Oh, the question says 25 ft, and the options are in inches. So I need to convert 25 ft to inches first.

25 feet is 25 * 12 inches = 300 inches. So f_t = 300 inches.

The question asks for the eyepiece focal length f_e such that the magnification M is 300 diameters. Wait, wait, wait. The question says the magnification is 300 diameters. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Magnification is usually a number, not a diameter. Oh, perhaps it's a typo, and they meant 300 times or 300x. So M = 300.

So M = f_t / f_e = 300. So f_e = f_t / M = 300 / 300 = 1 inch. So the eyepiece focal length is 1 inch.

Looking at the options, option H is 1 inch. So the correct answer should be H.

The question involves calculating the focal length of an eyepiece for a telescope with a focal length of 25 feet, which is equivalent to 300 inches. The magnification required is 300 times, and the formula for magnification is \( M = \frac{f_t}{f_e} \), where \( f_t \) is the telescope's focal length and \( f_e \) is the eyepiece's focal length. Rearranging the formula gives \( f_e = \frac{f_t}{M} \). Substituting the values: \( f_e = \frac{300 \, \text{inches}}{300} = 1 \, \text{inch} \). Among the options provided, the correct focal length is 1 inch, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
