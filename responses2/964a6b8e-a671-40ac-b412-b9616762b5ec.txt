Okay, so I have to find Jane's mean quiz score. Let me think about how to do this. Mean is like the average, right? I remember that to calculate the mean, I need to add up all the scores and then divide by the number of scores.

Jane's scores are 98, 97, 92, 85, and 93. There are five scores in total. So first step is to add them all together.

Let me add them step by step. Starting with 98 and 97. 98 plus 97 is... 98+97 is 195. Then, add 92 to that. 195 plus 92 is 287. Next is 85. So 287 plus 85. Hmm, let me calculate that. 287 +85 is 372. Then, add 93. 372 +93. Let me see, 372+90 is 462, plus 3 is 465. So the total sum is 465.

Wait, let me double-check the addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's add them again:

98 + 97 = 195  
195 + 92 = 287  
287 + 85 = 372  
372 + 93 = 465

Yep, that's correct. Now, there are 5 quiz scores, so I divide the total by 5. 465 divided by 5. Let's see, 5 into 465. 5 times 90 is 450, so 465 minus 450 is 15. 5 goes into 15 three times. So 90 +3 is 93. So the mean is 93.

Looking at the options, option F is 93. So the answer should be F.

The mean is calculated by adding all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. Adding 98, 97, 92, 85, and 93 gives 465. Dividing by 5 (number of scores) results in a mean of 93.

Answer: F: 93
