Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the last two digits of a power tower of 3's that's 2012 high. That is, 3^(3^(3^(...^3))) with 2012 threes. So, it's 3^ (3^(3^...^3)) with 2012 threes. And I have to compute this modulo 100. 

Hmm, I remember that for problems involving exponents modulo some number, Euler's theorem and the Chinese Remainder Theorem can be useful. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since we're dealing with modulus 100, which factors into 4 * 25, and 4 and 25 are coprime, I can compute the exponent modulo φ(4)=2 and φ(25)=20, then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Euler's theorem tells me that for modulus 4 and 25, certain exponents will be congruent modulo those values.

But wait, the problem is a power tower, so the exponent itself is another power tower, which complicates things. The tower has 2012 threes, so it's a huge exponent. I need to find a pattern or some cyclicity in the exponents modulo something.

Let me break it down step by step. I need to compute the tower: 3^{3^{3^{...}}} with 2012 threes, mod 100. Let me denote this as T. So T = 3^k, where k is another tower of 2011 threes.

So, T mod 100 = 3^k mod 100. I need to find k mod something to simplify this. Let me think about the modulus 100. Since 100 = 4 * 25, and φ(100) = 40, Euler's theorem says that 3^40 ≡ 1 mod 100. So, 3^a ≡ 3^(a mod 40) mod 100. But wait, 3 and 100 are coprime, so that's correct.

Wait, but wait—Euler's theorem applies when the base is coprime to the modulus. Yes, 3 and 100 are coprime since GCD(3,100)=1. So, 3^φ(100) = 3^40 ≡ 1 mod 100. So, 3^k mod 100 = 3^(k mod 40) mod 100. But wait, that's only if k is large enough, right? Because if k is a multiple of 40, 3^k would be 1 mod 100. But sometimes, if k is congruent to 0 mod 40, but if k is smaller, we can't just do that.

Wait, but in our case, the exponent k is also a tower of 2011 threes. So, k is a huge number. So, to find k mod something. Let me figure out the pattern of 3^m mod 40, because the modulus for 3^k mod 100 is 40 for the exponent.

Wait, no, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me think about the modulus for the exponent k. Since we're working mod 40 for 3^k mod 100, maybe we can find k mod φ(40). Because φ(40) is 16, so 3^16 ≡ 1 mod 40. So, 3^k mod 40 = 3^(k mod 16) mod 40.

Wait, but let's make sure that's correct. So, for modulus 40, since 3 and 40 are coprime, Euler's theorem says that 3^16 ≡ 1 mod 40. So yes, 3^k mod 40 = 3^(k mod 16) mod 40. So, to compute 3^k mod 100, we can first find k mod 16, and then compute 3^(k mod 16) mod 40, then mod 100.

But wait, let me correct that. Because 3^k mod 40 is 3^(k mod φ(40)) mod 40, where φ(40)=16. So, 3^k mod 40 = 3^(k mod 16) mod 40. But then, 3^k mod 100 is 3^(k mod 40) mod 100, which can be computed as 3^(k mod 40) mod 100. Hmm, but maybe it's getting a bit tangled. Let's try to structure this.

So, to compute 3^k mod 100, we first reduce k modulo φ(100)=40. So, 3^k mod 100 = 3^(k mod 40) mod 100. But since k is 3^(3^...), which is a tower of 2011 threes, we need to find k mod 40.

So, what's k mod 40? Let's denote m = 3^(3^...^3) with 2011 threes. So, m is the exponent for the outermost 3.

So, m mod 40 is needed. Let's compute m mod 40.

Breaking it down, m is 3^p, where p is another tower of 2010 threes. So, m mod 40 = (3^p) mod 40.

Now, let's compute p mod something, because 3^p mod 40 can be simplified using Euler's theorem. Since 3 and 40 are coprime, φ(40)=16, so 3^16 ≡ 1 mod 40. Therefore, 3^p mod 40 = 3^(p mod 16) mod 40.

So, we need to compute p mod 16. p is 3^q, where q is a tower of 2009 threes. So, p = 3^q.

To compute p mod 16, since 3 and 16 are coprime, φ(16)=8, so 3^8 ≡ 1 mod 16. So, 3^q mod 16 = 3^(q mod 8) mod 16.

So, q mod 8 is needed. q is 3^r, where r is a tower of 2008 threes.

So, q = 3^r. Now, 3 mod 8 is 3. 3^2 = 9 ≡ 1 mod 8. So, 3^r mod 8 depends on whether r is even or odd.

Wait, 3^1 mod 8 = 3.

3^2 mod 8 = 9 mod 8 = 1.

3^3 = 3*3^2 = 3*1 = 3 mod 8.

3^4 = 3^2 *3^2=1*1=1 mod 8.

So, the pattern is 3,1,3,1,... So, if r is odd, 3^r mod 8 = 3.

If r is even, 3^r mod 8 = 1.

So, q = 3^r. Since the tower of 2008 threes is r, which is a huge number. Let's see: how does this tower behave?

Wait, r is a tower of 2008 threes. Is r even or odd? 3 is odd, 3^anything is still odd. So, r is odd. So, q=3^r mod 8 = 3.

So, p = 3^q mod 16 = 3^3 mod 16. 3^3 is 27, which mod 16 is 11. So, p mod 16 = 11.

So, m = 3^p mod 40 = 3^11 mod 40. Let's compute 3^11.

3^1 =3
3^2=9
3^3=27
3^4=81 mod40=41 mod40=1.
Wait, 3^4 is 81, which is 2*40=80, so 81-80=1. So, 3^4 ≡1 mod40.

Wait, that's a mistake. Because 3^4 is 81, which is 1 mod40. So, 3^4 = 1 mod40.

So, 3^11 = 3^(4*2 +3) = (3^4)^2 *3^3 = (1)^2 *27=27 mod40.

So, m = p mod40 =27.

Wait, no: wait, m is 3^p, so m mod40 = 3^(p mod φ(40)) mod40. But φ(40)=16, and since 3 and 40 are coprime, that's correct.

But earlier steps:

m =3^p mod40.

p =3^q mod16.

q =3^r mod8.

r is a huge tower of 2008 threes. As we found, r is odd. So, q=3^r mod8=3.

p =3^q mod16=3^3=27 mod16=11.

So, m =3^p mod40=3^11 mod40.

3^4=81 mod40=1, so 3^11=3^(4*2 +3)= (3^4)^2 *3^3 =1^2 *27 =27 mod40.

So, m=27 mod40.

So, now, going back to the original problem: 3^k mod100, where k=m=27 mod40.

So, 3^k mod100 = 3^(k mod40) mod100=3^27 mod100.

Wait, but let's compute 3^27 mod100.

But that might be a bit tedious. Let's compute it step by step, using exponentiation by squaring or breaking it down.

Let me compute 3^1=3.

3^2=9.

3^3=27.

3^4=81.

3^5=243 mod100=43.

3^6=3^5 *3=43*3=129 mod100=29.

3^7=29*3=87.

3^8=87*3=261 mod100=61.

3^9=61*3=183 mod100=83.

3^10=83*3=249 mod100=49.

3^11=49*3=147 mod100=47.

3^12=47*3=141 mod100=41.

3^13=41*3=123 mod100=23.

3^14=23*3=69.

3^15=69*3=207 mod100=7.

3^16=7*3=21.

3^17=21*3=63.

3^18=63*3=189 mod100=89.

3^19=89*3=267 mod100=67.

3^20=67*3=201 mod100=1.

Ah, wait! 3^20 mod100 is 1. So, the cycle repeats every 20 exponents.

So, 3^27 = 3^(20+7) = 3^20 *3^7 = (1) * 87 mod100=87.

Wait, but wait, that's a big computation. Alternatively, since 3^20=1 mod100, so 3^27=3^(20+7)=3^7=87 mod100.

So, 3^27 mod100=87.

Wait, but wait a second. I may have made an error here. Because 3^20 mod100 is 1, yes, but let me double-check 3^20.

Compute 3^10 mod100 is 49. Then 3^20 is (3^10)^2= 49^2=2401. 2401 mod100 is 1. So yes, 3^20=1 mod100.

So, 3^27 =3^(20*1 +7)= (3^20)^1 *3^7=1*87=87 mod100.

So, the result is 87.

Looking back at the options, option A is 87. So, the answer should be A: 87.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back and check.

Wait, in the initial step, I said that k is 2011 threes, so m is 3^m, and we need to find m mod40.

We found that m=3^p, where p is 3^q, q is 3^r, etc., down to 3. So, each time, each exponent is a tower of threes, which becomes 3^something, modulo something.

So, starting from the top, each tower is a power of 3, and when we're computing mod φ(100)=40, we need to find the exponent mod φ(40)=16.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 3^p mod40=3^(p mod16) mod40, and p is 3^q.

So, to compute p mod16, p=3^q, so 3^q mod16.

Since 3 and 16 are coprime, φ(16)=8, so 3^q mod16=3^(q mod8) mod16.

Now, q is 3^r, where r is a tower of 2009 threes. So, q=3^r.

So, 3^r mod8. Since 3 mod8=3, and 3^2=9 mod8=1. So, 3^r mod8 is 3 if r is odd, 1 if r is even.

Since r is a tower of 2009 threes, which is a huge number, but 3 is odd. So, r is odd. Therefore, q=3^r mod8=3.

So, p=3^q mod16=3^3 mod16=27 mod16=11.

Thus, m=3^p mod40=3^11 mod40=177147 mod40. Let me compute 3^11.

3^1=3.

3^2=9.

3^3=27.

3^4=81 mod40=1.

3^5=3.

3^6=9.

3^7=27.

3^8=1.

3^9=3.

3^10=9.

3^11=27.

So, m=27 mod40.

So, now, 3^k mod100=3^(k mod40) mod100=3^27 mod100.

Wait, but earlier I thought 3^20 mod100=1, so 3^27=3^7=87 mod100.

But let me compute 3^27 mod100 again.

Alternatively, using binary exponentiation:

Compute 3^27 as (3^10)^2 *3^7.

3^10 mod100 is 49.

So, 49^2=2401 mod100=1.

So, 3^20= (3^10)^2=1*1=1 mod100.

So, 3^27 =3^20 *3^7=1*87=87 mod100.

So, the last two digits are 87, which is option A.
</think>

The last two digits of the power tower of 2012 threes, modulo 100, are found by recognizing that the exponent can be reduced using Euler's theorem and properties of modular arithmetic. After simplifying, we find that the result is 87. 

Answer: A: 87
