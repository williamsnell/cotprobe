Okay, so I have this question about auditing and financial reporting. Let's see what it's asking. The question is asking which characteristic would most likely heighten an auditor's concern about the risk of material misstatements due to fraud. The options are A through J.

Hmm, I remember that when it comes to fraud, there are several factors that can raise a red flag. Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Equipment is often sold at a loss before being fully depreciated. I'm not sure about this. I think depreciation is a standard accounting practice, so maybe this isn't directly related to fraud. But perhaps if the depreciation is done improperly, but I'm not certain. I'll come back to this.

Option B: Bank reconciliations usually include in-transit deposits. Bank reconciling usually compares the book balance with the cash account. In-transit deposits are those that have been recorded but not yet deducted because they haven't been received. I'm trying to remember if this relates to fraud. Oh, I think if someone is trying to hide money, they might have transfers that are not accounted for. But I'm not sure if that's a direct indicator of fraud risk. Maybe more about accuracy than fraud.

Option C: The company has stringent internal controls. If controls are strong, the risk of fraud seems lower. So this would actually lower the concern, not raise it. So this would probably not be the correct answer.

Option D: Employees who handle cash receipts are not bonded. If employees aren't bonded, they might be more likely to engage in fraudulent activities, like receiving unauthorized funds. bonded employees might be more cautious, so this could increase the risk. So this could be a factor that raises a concern.

Option E: The entity has consistent profit margins and cash flow. Higher margins might mean that profits are more likely to be manipulated, but cash flow is more about liquidity. If profits are consistent, it might indicate that the company isn't managing their finances well, but I'm not sure about the direct link to fraud risk. It could be that higher margins might make it easier to inflate, but I'm not certain if this is a primary factor.

Option F: A strong and independent audit committee. An independent committee could mean reduced reliance on auditor bias, so the audit is more reliable. Lower risk of material misstatements. So this would reduce the concern, not increase it.

Option G: The entity's industry is experiencing declining customer demand. Declining demand could lead to less revenue, which might be harder to detect if the company isn't accounting for it properly. But I'm not sure if this directly increases the risk of fraud. Maybe it's more of a general issue with the company's financials than a fraud risk.

Option H: The entity has low turnover of senior management. Maybe if the managers aren't around, they can't handle day-to-day operations. But does that directly impact fraud risk? I'm not sure. It might affect operational efficiency but less likely the fraud risk.

Option I: The entity frequently changes its external auditors. Change of auditors could lead to increased investigation if previous auditors were involved. This might raise concerns because if the previous auditor's failure is an indication of a problem, it could be a red flag. So this could be a factor.

Option J: The entity's financial statements are always prepared on time. If statements are always on time, it's more likely to be accurate, which would lower the risk of material misstatements. So this would not heighten concerns.

So, now I need to decide which options are more likely to raise concerns. The question is asking for the most likely to heighten the risk.

Option D: employees not bonded. I think this is a big issue. If you're not bonded, employees might be more likely to engage in fraudulent activities, like receiving unauthorized funds or overstating transactions. This would increase the risk of material misstatements due to fraud.

Option I: frequently changing auditors. If auditors change, it could be a red flag, as the previous auditors could have been involved in issues. So this would also increase concerns.

Wait, the question asks for the characteristic that most likely heightens the risk. So which of these is more impactful?

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between options D and I. Both relate to audit processes. 

Wait, I think when employees are not bonded, it's a direct indicator of potential fraud. But if auditors change, perhaps it's a sign that the previous auditors were not reliable. But which factor is more directly linked to fraud?

In other words, employees who are not bonded might be more likely to engage in fraudulent activities, making it a more direct cause. So option D sounds more correct.

The correct answer is D: Employees who handle cash receipts are not bonded. This is because not being bonded increases the likelihood of employees engaging in fraudulent activities, such as receiving unauthorized funds, which directly raises concerns about material misstatements. While option I (frequent changes in external auditors) could indicate a lack of reliability in previous auditors, the direct link to fraud through unlicensed employees is stronger. 

Answer: D
