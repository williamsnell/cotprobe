Okay, so I've got this question about portfolio standard deviation. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you form a portfolio of two stocks, the standard deviation of the portfolio isn't just the average of their individual standard deviations. It's a bit more complicated because of the correlation between them. Oh wait, right, the formula involves the correlation coefficient.

The question says the standard deviations are 6% for Stock A and 18% for Stock B. Their correlation is 0.2. And they're forming an equal-weighted portfolio, meaning each stock is equally weighted, so each has a weight of 50%.

The formula I think is something like the weighted average of the variances plus twice the product of their weights and the covariance. Or wait, maybe it's the square root of the variance of the portfolio. Let me recall the exact formula.

So, for a two-asset portfolio, the variance (σ_p^2) is given by:

σ_p² = w_A²σ_A² + w_B²σ_B² + 2w_Aw_Bσ_Aσ_Bρ_AB

Where:
- w_A and w_B are the weights of each stock
- σ_A and σ_B are their standard deviations
- ρ_AB is the correlation coefficient

Since it's an equal-weighted portfolio, w_A = w_B = 0.5.

Plugging in the numbers:
w_A = 0.5, w_B=0.5
σ_A = 0.06, σ_B=0.18
ρ = 0.2

So,

σ_p² = (0.5)^2*(0.06)^2 + (0.5)^2*(0.18)^2 + 2*(0.5)*(0.5)*(0.06)*(0.18)*(0.2)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First term: (0.5)^2 * (0.06)^2 = 0.25 * 0.0036 = 0.0009
Second term: (0.5)^2 * (0.18)^2 = 0.25 * 0.0324 = 0.0081
Third term: 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.06 * 0.18 * 0.2

Calculating the third term:
2 * 0.5 * 0.5 is 0.5. Then, 0.06 * 0.18 is 0.0108. Multiply by 0.2: 0.0108 * 0.2 = 0.00216. Then multiply by 0.5: 0.00108.

So adding all three terms:
0.0009 + 0.0081 = 0.009, plus 0.00108 = 0.01008.

So the variance is 0.01008. To get the standard deviation, take the square root. Let's calculate sqrt(0.01008).

Hmm, sqrt(0.01) is 0.1, sqrt(0.01008) is a little more. Let me think: 0.1004^2 = 0.01008? Let's check: (0.1004)^2 = (0.1)^2 + 2*0.1*0.0004 + (0.0004)^2 = 0.01 + 0.00008 + 0.00000016 = approximately 0.01008016. Yeah, that's correct.

So the standard deviation is about 0.1004, which is 10.04%. Looking at the options, option F is 10%, which is close. But wait, the options don't have 10.04%. The closest is F:10% and perhaps another option is 10.1%, but no, the options don't have fractions. So perhaps the answer is 10%, but I should double-check my calculations.

Wait, did I compute the variance correctly? Let me see:

0.5^2 * 0.06^2 = 0.25 * 0.0036 = 0.0009

0.5^2 * 0.18^2 = 0.25 * 0.0324 = 0.0081

The cross term: 2*0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5; 0.06*0.18 = 0.0108; 0.0108 * 0.2 = 0.00216; 0.00216 * 0.5 = 0.00108.

Adding all, 0.0009 + 0.0081 = 0.009; plus 0.00108 = 0.01008. So variance is 0.01008, sqrt is 0.1004, about 10.04%. But the options don't have that. The closest is 10%, which is option F.

Wait, but the options include 10%, so perhaps the intended answer is F. However, another possibility is that I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: The standard deviation of the portfolio is the weighted standard deviation based on the covariance. The formula is:

σ_p = w_A * σ_A + w_B * σ_B * sqrt(1 + 2ρ - 1) ?

No, that's probably not right. I think the correct formula is the one I used earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it differently.

Wait, perhaps using the formula in terms of variances and covariance. So Var_p = (w_A σ_A)^2 + (w_B σ_B)^2 + 2 w_A w_B σ_A σ_B ρ.

Yes, that's the same as before. So, with w=0.5 for both.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 0.06^2 = 0.0036, 0.18^2=0.0324.

So,

0.5^2 * 0.0036 = 0.25 * 0.0036 = 0.0009.

0.5^2 * 0.0324 = 0.25 * 0.0324 = 0.0081.

Now, the cross term: 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5; 0.5 *0.06=0.03; 0.03 *0.18=0.0054; 0.0054 *0.2=0.00108.

So all terms: 0.0009 + 0.0081=0.009, plus 0.00108=0.01008.

So variance is 0.01008, standard deviation sqrt(0.01008) ≈ 0.1004, which is 10.04%.

So the closest answer is F:10%, but in the options, option F is 10%, which is 10.00%, and the calculation gave 10.04%. So perhaps the intended answer is F, but maybe I made a miscalculation?

Wait, another thought: Oh wait, perhaps I should compute sqrt(0.01008) more accurately. Let's see, 0.1004 squared is 0.01008016. So 0.01008 is 0.01008, which is 0.008 over 0.01008016.

Wait, 0.1004^2 is (0.1 + 0.0004)^2 = 0.01 + 2*0.1*0.0004 + (0.0004)^2 = 0.01 + 0.00008 + 0.00000016 = 0.01008016.

So 0.01008 is just a little less than that. So sqrt(0.01008) is just a little less than 0.1004, say, approximately 0.100399.

Which is 10.0399%, so approximately 10.04%, which is 10.04%. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not exactly 10.04%, but the closest option is F:10%.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I should compute the formula more accurately with more decimal places. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the use of the formula for standard deviation of equal-weighted portfolio. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the simplified formula.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the formula is sqrt( (w_A σ_A)^2 + (w_B σ_B)^2 + 2 w_A w_B ρ σ_A σ_B )? Wait, no, that's the same as the formula I used. Because (w_A σ_A)(w_B σ_B) is w_A w_B σ_A σ_B. So the cross term is 2 * w_A w_B σ_A σ_B * ρ.

Wait, let me re-calculate each part.

Compute each term:

First term: (0.5 * 0.06)^2 = (0.03)^2 = 0.0009.

Second term: (0.5 * 0.18)^2 = (0.09)^2 = 0.0081.

Third term: 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.06 * 0.18 * 0.2.

Let me compute 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5.

0.06 * 0.18 = 0.0108.

0.0108 * 0.2 = 0.00216.

0.00216 * 0.5 = 0.00108.

Adding all three terms: 0.0009 + 0.0081 = 0.009 + 0.00108 = 0.01008.

So the variance is 0.01008, so standard deviation is sqrt(0.01008) = approximately 0.100399, which is 10.04%. So the closest option is 10%, which is F. But wait, the options have F as 10%, but perhaps the intended answer is 10%, but maybe that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula in terms of the weighted average of the standard deviations, which isn't correct. But that's a common mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the square root approach but perhaps with another formula. Let me think. Oh wait, perhaps I should compute it as the weighted average of the variances plus the covariance.

Wait, but I think I did it correctly earlier. Another possibility is that I miscalculated the cross term. Let me recheck:

Cross term: 2 w_A w_B σ_A σ_B ρ

w_A = 0.5, w_B=0.5, σ_A=0.06, σ_B=0.18, ρ=0.2.

So:

2 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5

0.06 * 0.18 = 0.0108

Multiply by 0.2: 0.0108 * 0.2 = 0.00216

Multiply by 0.5: 0.00216 * 0.5 = 0.00108.

Yes, that's correct.

So the variance is 0.0009 + 0.0081 + 0.00108 = 0.01008.

So sqrt(0.01008) is approx 0.1004, which is 10.04% which is 10.04%, which is closest to 10%, so option F.

Wait, but looking back at the options, F is 10%, and the other options go down to 6%. So, perhaps the correct answer is F:10%.

Wait, but wait another thing. Perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

The formula for the variance of a two-asset portfolio is:

Var_p = (w1σ1)^2 + (w2σ2)^2 + 2w1w2σ1σ2ρ

Yes, that's correct. So, the calculation is correct.

So the standard deviation is about 10.04%, so the closest option is F:10%.
</think>

To determine the standard deviation of an equal-weighted portfolio of Stocks A and B, we use the formula for the variance of a two-asset portfolio:

\[
\sigma_p^2 = w_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + w_B^2 \sigma_B^2 + 2w_A w_B \sigma_A \sigma_B \rho_{AB}
\]

where:
- \( w_A = w_B = 0.5 \) (equal weights),
- \( \sigma_A = 0.06 \), \( \sigma_B = 0.18 \) (standard deviations),
- \( \rho_{AB} = 0.2 \) (correlation coefficient).

### Step 1: Compute each term
1. **First term**: \( (0.5)^2 \cdot (0.06)^2 = 0.25 \cdot 0.0036 = 0.0009 \)
2. **Second term**: \( (0.5)^2 \cdot (0.18)^2 = 0.25 \cdot 0.0324 = 0.0081 \)
3. **Cross term**: \( 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.06 \cdot 0.18 \cdot 0.2 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.5 \)
   - \( 0.06 \cdot 0.18 = 0.0108 \)
   - \( 0.0108 \cdot 0.2 = 0.00216 \)
   - \( 0.5 \cdot 0.00216 = 0.00108 \)

### Step 2: Sum the terms
\[
\sigma_p^2 = 0.0009 + 0.0081 + 0.00108 = 0.01008
\]

### Step 3: Compute the standard deviation
\[
\sigma_p = \sqrt{0.01008} \approx 0.1004 \, \text{or} \, 10.04\%
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option to 10.04% is **10%**, which corresponds to option **F**.
