Alright, so I've got this question about the root-mean-square (rms) values of displacement, velocity, and acceleration for a damped forced harmonic oscillator operating at steady state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that for a simple harmonic oscillator without any damping, the rms values are related to the maximum displacement. The rms of displacement x, v, and a would all be the same because of the symmetry in SHM. But this isn't a simple harmonic oscillator; it's a damped forced one. So, I need to consider the effects of damping and the driving force.

In a damped harmonic oscillator, especially when it's driven by an external force, there's a steady-state response. The displacement, velocity, and acceleration will have their own RMS values determined by the system's parameters. 

Wait, but the problem says it's operating at steady state. That probably means the system is responding to the driving force and damping in a predictable way. I think for such systems, the steady-state solution involves sinusoidal functions with the same frequency as the driving force.

In the forced harmonic oscillator, the steady-state response has an amplitude that depends on the driving force's amplitude and the system's natural frequency and damping. Let's think about how each RMS value is calculated.

For a mass-spring system without damping, the rms of displacement is x_max divided by sqrt(2). But with damping and a forced term, things get more complicated. The amplitude of the displacement in the steady state is x_max * sqrt( (1 - (ω^2/ω0^2)^2) ), where ω is the driving frequency and ω0 is the natural frequency. But wait, I'm not exactly sure about that formula. Oh wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the amplitude of the displacement, which is generally x_max multiplied by some factor that depends on damping.

Wait, but the question is about the rms of the displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Let me think about each one.

Displacement x: The rms is sqrt( (1/(T)) ∫(x^2 dt) ), where T is the period. For a sinusoidal function, the average of x^2 is (max^2)/2. So the rms would be max / sqrt(2). But wait, in the presence of a driving force, the amplitude changes. Oh wait, but the system is underdamped, damped, or maybe critically damped? The question doesn't specify, but I think the standard approach is to consider the steady-state response.

Wait, in a forced oscillator, the steady-state displacement amplitude is (F0/m) / sqrt( (ω0^2 - ω^2)^2 + (γω)^2 ), where γ is the damping coefficient. But when the system is at resonance, ω approaches ω0, the denominator becomes small, causing the amplitude to increase. But that's perhaps not directly relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps in the steady state, the amplitude of displacement is (F0/m) / sqrt( (ω0^2 - ω^2)^2 + (γ ω)^2 ). But without knowing the specific parameters, maybe the answer is given in terms of x_max and the factors based on the parameters.

Wait, the question is about the rms of each quantity. So, for example, x_rms is sqrt( x_avg^2 ), which would be x_max / sqrt(2), but only if the motion is purely sinusoidal. But with damping and a driving force, the displacement isn't exactly sinusoidal in steady state. Wait, no, in the steady state, the system's response is a sinusoid at the driving frequency, so the displacement should be sinusoidal. So the average of x^2 is (x_max^2) / 2, so the rms is x_max / sqrt(2). Wait, but that's without any damping. Wait, no, because damping affects the amplitude. So, when damping is present, does the amplitude change?

Wait, I think when damping is present, the amplitude of the steady-state response is reduced. So the displacement amplitude would be x_max * (some factor) / sqrt(2), but perhaps I'm confusing with the case when damping is negligible.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the amplitudes of each quantity. Let's denote:

x_max is the amplitude of the displacement.

v_rms is the rms of velocity.

a_rms is the rms of acceleration.

In the steady state, for a damped oscillator under a driving force, the steady-state solutions for x, v, and a are sinusoidal. The displacement amplitude is x_max multiplied by some factor, and then the velocity is x_max * ω (since velocity is x derivative), and acceleration is x_max * ω squared.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact factors. Let me think about the steady-state expressions.

Assume the displacement x(t) is x0 * sin(ωt + φ), where x0 is the amplitude. Then, velocity v(t) is x0 ω cos(ωt + φ), and acceleration a(t) is x0 ω² sin(ωt + φ). The rms for each would be the square root of the average of the square of each.

For x(t), the rms is sqrt( (x0^2)/2 ) * sqrt(1/2) because the average of sin^2 over time is 1/2. Wait, no, the average of x(t)^2 is (x0^2)/2. So the rms is x0 / sqrt(2).

Similarly, the velocity rms is (x0 ω)/sqrt(2), and acceleration rms is (x0 ω²)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but in a damped oscillator, the steady-state solution doesn't have a pure sinusoid because damping affects the amplitude. So the amplitude might be x0 = (F0/(mω0^2 - ω^2)) ) * (some factor?), but perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that in the steady state, the displacement is x(t) = (F0 / (mω0^2 - ω^2)) ) * sin(ωt), but this is under the assumption of resonance, but usually, the amplitude depends on damping. Oh wait, but in the case of a damped oscillator, the amplitude is x0 = (F0/( m (ω0^2 - ω^2) )) ) * [ 1 / sqrt( (ω0^2 - ω^2)^2 + (γ ω)^2 ) ) ].

Wait, but perhaps in this question, the system is such that the damping is small, so perhaps the amplitude is reduced. Alternatively, perhaps the initial problem assumes a certain form. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the system where the amplitude is x_max, but that's not correct because in reality, the amplitude would be adjusted by damping and driving.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a system where x_max is the amplitude of the steady-state response, but that's not correct in the presence of damping. Maybe I should just proceed with the given options.

Looking at the options, let me look for each:

Option A: x_rms = x_max / sqrt(2), v_rms = (ω x_max) / sqrt(2), a_rms = ω^2 x_max / sqrt(2).

Hmm, but this would imply that all three are proportional to x_max. That doesn't make sense because acceleration should be the highest, since it's the second derivative. So perhaps option A is incorrect.

Option F: x_rms= (ω² x_max)/2, v_rms= (ω x_max)/2, a_rms= x_max / sqrt(2).

Wait, but displacement would have x_rms as (ω² x_max)/2. Hmm, but that would imply that acceleration is lower than displacement, which is not correct because acceleration is proportional to x (since a=ω²x) and thus same scaling. So option F's acceleration is x_max, which would be correct because a = ω² x. So a_rms would be (ω^2 x_max) / sqrt(2), which matches option F's a_rms. So that's a possible candidate.

Wait, but let's think again. The displacement is x_max, so x_rms = x_max / sqrt(2). But option F says x_rms is (ω² x_max)/2. That would imply that x_max is much larger than what it should be. So perhaps option F is incorrect.

Looking back, perhaps I should think about how the parameters relate. The correct expressions for rms values in steady-state:

x_rms = x_max / sqrt(2)

v_rms = (x_max ω) / sqrt(2)

a_rms = (x_max ω^2) / sqrt(2)

So all three are proportional to x_max, and their coefficients are 1/sqrt(2), ω/sqrt(2), and ω²/sqrt(2).

So looking at the options:

Option F: x_rms= (ω² x_max/2) → which would be x_max * ω² / 2. But in our case it's x_max/√2. So that would be if ω² = 1/2, so ω= 1/sqrt(2). But the options don't specify that, so probably not option F.

Option D: x_rms= x_max/3, which is smaller, so that's not correct.

Option B: All higher than expected, probably not.

Option A: All higher, no.

Option G: x_rms= (ω x_max)/sqrt(2), v_rms= x_max/sqrt(2), a_rms= (ω² x_max)/sqrt(2). Hmm, but that would imply that displacement rms is same as v_rms, which is not correct. Because x is the integral of velocity, and v is the integral of acceleration. So, for sinusoidal motion, x would be proportional to the derivative of v, so v_rms would be x_rms times ω. So if x_rms is A, v_rms is A ω. So option G's v_rms is x_max/sqrt(2), but according to our earlier calculation, v_rms should be (x_max ω)/sqrt(2). So unless ω is 1, it's not matching.

Wait, but the options don't give any information about ω. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the question is for a system where the driving frequency is equal to the natural frequency (resonance), but that might not affect the rms values as in that case, the amplitude would be maximum, but the rms would still be as per the formulas.

Wait, but let's think about the case when the system is in resonance. In that case, the amplitude is maximum, but the rms values would still scale with the same factors. So displacement rms would be x_max / sqrt(2), etc.

But in that case, none of the options would have the correct proportions except perhaps option F, but that's not correct either because a_rms is (ω^2 x_max)/2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The actual formula for the rms of displacement is sqrt( (x_max^2)/2 ), so x_rms = x_max / sqrt(2). Similarly, v_rms is x_rms multiplied by ω, so v_rms= (ω x_max)/sqrt(2). And a_rms is v_rms multiplied by ω, so a_rms= (ω^2 x_max)/sqrt(2).

So the correct proportions are x_rms = x_max / sqrt(2), v_rms = (ω x_max)/sqrt(2), a_rms = (ω^2 x_max)/sqrt(2).

Looking at the options:

Option F: x_rms= (ω² x_max)/2, which is bigger than our expectation. So a_rms would be (ω² x_max)/2, but according to our calculation it's (ω² x_max)/sqrt(2). So this option doesn't match.

Option D: x_rms= x_max/3, which is too small.

Wait, perhaps none of the options have exactly these values. That can't be, so perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a damped oscillator, and the amplitude of the steady-state response is x_max multiplied by something else.

Wait, in a damped harmonic oscillator, the amplitude of the steady-state response is given by x0 = (F0/m) * [1 / sqrt( (ω0^2 - ω^2)^2 + (γ ω)^2 ) ) ].

Wait, but that would mean that x0 is less than x_max. Because the denominator is bigger than (ω0^2 - ω^2)^2, making the overall 1 over a larger number, so x0 is smaller than x_max. So perhaps the calculations for the rms would involve x0.

Hmm, but the problem says "damped forced harmonic oscillator operating at steady state". So perhaps the forced term F0 is such that the system is in resonance, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the system where the amplitude of the displacement is x_max, meaning that the system isn't being damped. But that's probably not the case. Because the problem includes damping.

Wait, but maybe in the options, the first component is x_rms = x_max/sqrt(2), so option F has x_rms= (ω^2 x_max)/2, which is larger. So perhaps that's not the right option.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's natural frequency is such that the amplitude is x_max. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the options.

The question asks for which option correctly describes the rms values.

Option F: x_rms= (ω² x_max)/2, v_rms= (ω x_max)/2, a_rms= x_max / sqrt(2).

But according to our earlier calculations, the a_rms would be (ω² x_max)/sqrt(2), which is option F's a_rms. So that's correct. But x_rms and v_rms are smaller than expected. So that would suggest that the option F is correct only for a_rms, but incorrect for x_rms and v_rms.

Looking at the options, perhaps none of them match exactly, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should be considering that the system is underdamped, so the steady-state amplitude is less than x_max. So, in that case, the options may not have the correct scaling.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the system where the driving frequency matches the natural frequency, but that doesn't change the scaling of the rms values.

Wait, another approach: the displacement in steady state is x(t)= X sin(ω t), where X= (F0/(m (ω0² - ω²))) * (1/ sqrt( (ω0² - ω²)^2 + (γ ω)^2 )) )

Then, the rms of displacement would be sqrt( (X^2)/2 ), which is X/sqrt(2).

Similarly, the velocity is X ω cos(ω t), so rms is X ω / sqrt(2).

Acceleration is X ω² sin(ω t), rms is X ω² / sqrt(2).

So, in terms of X, which is the amplitude of displacement, all three rms values are proportional to X.

So the correct scaling is x_rms : v_rms : a_rms = 1 : ω : ω².

Looking at the options:

Which option has the same ratios? Let's check each option.

Option F: x_rms = (ω² x_max)/2, v_rms= (ω x_max)/2, a_rms= x_max / sqrt(2).

The proportional factors would be (ω² /2) : (ω /2) : (1/√2). Which doesn't match 1:ω:ω². So F is not correct.

Option D: x_rms=x_max/3; v_rms=(ω^2 x_max)/3; a_rms=(ω x_max)/3. Not matching.

Option A: all x_rms, v_rms, a_rms are x_max/sqrt(2) etc. Wait, no. Because in option A, v_rms is (omega x_max)/sqrt(2), which is correct. a_rms is (omega^2 x_max)/sqrt(2), correct. x_rms is x_max/sqrt(2), correct. So option A's values are correct.

Wait, but wait, option A says all three are x_max / sqrt(2), but no. Let me see:

Option A: x_rms = x_max / sqrt(2), v_rms= (omega x_max)/sqrt(2), a_rms = (omega² x_max)/sqrt(2).

Yes, that aligns with our expectations.

But wait, but the question is about a damped oscillator. In reality, the amplitude would be less, so the scaling would not hold. Because in damped systems, the amplitude is reduced, but the scaling of the rms values would still be x_rms = x0 / sqrt(2), etc.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not in the options because it depends on whether the system is underdamped or not.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the correct answer is option F, which has a_rms correct, but x and v are wrong.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think again.

No, I think I've made a mistake. The correct option is option F, but I'm not sure why the other options don't fit. Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are correct. But that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: think about the system where the driving frequency is much lower than the natural frequency, so the system is underdamped. The amplitude of the steady-state response is X (from the formula), so x_rms is X / sqrt(2), v_rms is X ω / sqrt(2), a_rms is X ω² / sqrt(2).

In option F, x_rms is (ω² x_max)/2. So that would require X = (ω² x_max) / (2 * sqrt(2)) ), which might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is underdamped, so the amplitude is X = (F0)/(m * sqrt( (ω0^2 - ω^2)^2 + (γ ω)^2 )) ), but without knowing F0, ω, etc., it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a system where the amplitude is x_max, but that's not correct in the presence of damping.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the units.

The rms of displacement is (m/s^2 * s)^{1/2} = (m/s) * s^{1/2} )^{1/2} → Hmm, perhaps this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is a simple harmonic oscillator, so the answer is option A. But I think I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should pick option F, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another idea: let's compute the expression for each option.

Option F: x_rms = (ω² x_max) / 2,

v_rms = (ω x_max) / 2,

a_rms = (x_max) / sqrt(2).

In reality, the correct expressions are:

x_rms = x_max / sqrt(2),

v_rms = (x_max ω) / sqrt(2),

a_rms = (x_max ω^2) / sqrt(2).

So, option F's a_rms is correct, but x and v are wrong. So none of the options are correct. But that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the system is in resonance, so the amplitude is maximum, but that doesn't affect the scaling.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is such that the driving frequency is zero, so the displacement is x_max, and velocity is zero. Then, the rms would be x_max / sqrt(2), v_rms=0, a_rms=0. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is such that the amplitude is x_max multiplied by 1/sqrt(2), so x_rms would be x_max / 2. But that's not an option either.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option F: a_rms is correct. So if the a_rms is correct, then x_rms and v_rms are wrong. So none of the options is correct. But that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps I'm wrong in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the steady state, the displacement is x(t)=X sin(ωt), where X= (F0/m) * [ 1 / sqrt( (ω0^2 - ω^2)^2 + (γ ω)^2 ) ) ].

But without knowing F0, ω, etc., perhaps the problem is considering X = F0/(m ω0² ), which is the case for a simple harmonic oscillator.

But in that case, X would be (F0/(m ω0² )) = (F0/(m ω0² )) * (1/ sqrt( (ω0^2 - ω^2)^2 + (γ ω)^2 )) ), but if the denominator is approximated for small γ, but without knowing the exact parameters, perhaps I can't proceed.

Another approach: Let's consider that the system is a simple harmonic oscillator, so the answer is option A. But I thought that in that case, the displacement is x0, which would be x_max, but that's not correct in the presence of damping.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't consider damping, so the correct answer is option F.

I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should look for the correct option from the options given.

Option F: a_rms= (x_max)/sqrt(2), which is correct.

x_rms= (ω^2 x_max)/2 → which is incorrect, as it should be x_max/sqrt(2).

v_rms= (ω x_max)/2 → incorrect, should be x_max ω / sqrt(2).

So option F is incorrect.

Option D: x_rms = x_max/3, which is wrong.

Option B: All higher, which is wrong.

Option G: x_rms= (ω x_max)/sqrt(2), which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps option F is incorrect for x_rms and v_rms, but correct for a_rms.

But then, the correct rms values would be none of the options, which can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the scaling, perhaps x_rms is sqrt( (x_max)^2 / 2 ), which is x_max / sqrt(2), correct.

v_rms is x_max ω / sqrt(2), correct.

a_rms is x_max ω² / sqrt(2), correct.

But in the options, none of them have all three correct. So perhaps the correct option is option F, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should reread the options.

Wait, option D: x_rms= x_max/3, v_rms= (ω^2 x_max)/3, a_rms= (ω x_max)/3.

No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the system in which the displacement is x_max, and the force is F, so F= m a.

But in the steady state, the displacement is x_max, so a= (x_max a)/(m), which would imply that a is x_max/(m) * (something). I'm not getting anywhere.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and should pick option F, but I'm not confident.
</think>

To analyze the problem, we start by recalling the relationships between the root mean square (rms) values of displacement, velocity, and acceleration for a simple harmonic oscillator. In steady-state, these values scale as follows:

- Displacement rms: \( x_{\text{rms}} = \frac{x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}} \)
- Velocity rms: \( v_{\text{rms}} = \frac{x_{\text{max}} \omega}{\sqrt{2}} \)
- Acceleration rms: \( a_{\text{rms}} = \frac{x_{\text{max}} \omega^2}{\sqrt{2}} \)

These relationships are derived from the fact that rms values are proportional to the square root of the mean squared values. For example, the rms of displacement is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) times the peak (maximum) displacement \( x_{\text{max}} \), and similarly for velocity and acceleration.

Now, we evaluate the given options:

1. **Option F**:  
   - \( x_{\text{rms}} = \frac{\omega^2 x_{\text{max}}}{2} \)  
   - \( v_{\text{rms}} = \frac{\omega x_{\text{max}}}{2} \)  
   - \( a_{\text{rms}} = \frac{x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}} \)  

   This option incorrectly scales \( x_{\text{rms}} \) and \( v_{\text{rms}} \), as they should be \( \frac{x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( \frac{x_{\text{max}} \omega}{\sqrt{2}} \), respectively. However, \( a_{\text{rms}} \) is correct.

2. **Option D**:  
   - \( x_{\text{rms}} = \frac{x_{\text{max}}}{3} \)  
   - \( v_{\text{rms}} = \frac{\omega^2 x_{\text{max}}}{3} \)  
   - \( a_{\text{rms}} = \frac{\omega x_{\text{max}}}{3} \)  

   This option incorrectly scales all three rms values, as they should scale with \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \), \( \frac{\omega}{\sqrt{2}} \), and \( \frac{\omega^2}{\sqrt{2}} \), respectively.

3. **Option A**:  
   - \( x_{\text{rms}} = \frac{x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}} \)  
   - \( v_{\text{rms}} = \frac{\omega x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}} \)  
   - \( a_{\text{rms}} = \frac{\omega^2 x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}} \)  

   This option correctly scales all three rms values.

4. **Option G**:  
   - \( x_{\text{rms}} = \frac{\omega x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}} \)  
   - \( v_{\text{rms}} = \frac{x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}} \)  
   - \( a_{\text{rms}} = \frac{\omega^2 x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}} \)  

   This option incorrectly scales \( x_{\text{rms}} \) and \( v_{\text{rms}} \), as they should be \( \frac{x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( \frac{x_{\text{max}} \omega}{\sqrt{2}} \), respectively. However, \( a_{\text{rms}} \) is correct.

### Conclusion:
The correct rms values for the system are given in **Option A**, which scales all three rms values correctly. However, **Option F** is also correct for \( a_{\text{rms}} \), but it incorrectly scales \( x_{\text{rms}} \) and \( v_{\text{rms}} \). Since the problem asks for the specific answer, **Option A** is the best choice.
