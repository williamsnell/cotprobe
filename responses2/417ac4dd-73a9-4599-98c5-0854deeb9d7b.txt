Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about a historical event involving Indonesian leader Sukarno and some other African leaders. Hmm, I need to figure out which option correctly identifies the event he was keynoteing at the Bandung Conference in 1955. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question mentions that Ind Mong leaders, including Sukarno, attempted to maintain a neutral stance but didn't succeed. The options are various conflicts or wars. I remember that the Bandung Conference was a significant event in the history of the region, especially regarding the peace between Asia and Africa.

Wait, the Suez Crisis was about the East Africa bay and the port issues. I think that was in the 1950s. The Cuban Missile Crisis was about the Cuban missiles, which was in 1962. The Cold War involved the US, USSR, and others, but 1955 was just before the Cold War ended, so that's probably not it.

The Suez Crisis was about the East African ports, which could have implications for regional peace. Or maybe the South African-Sudan War? Wait, the South African-Sudan War was 1961-1962. Sukarno was part of the South African military during that time, right?

Wait, another thought. I recall that the 1955 conference was a meeting in Bandung, which was part of the international community. It's related to the peace negotiations between Australia, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Soviet Union. So the key event was the 1955 Suez Crisis, which was about the East African ports and led to the Suez Canal's closure in 1960. Wait, no, the Suez Crisis was a major crisis in the 1950s, but the actual event around that time was the Suez Canal's closure leading to the Battle of Suez, which was in 1955, and that led to the Suez Crisis.

But the question is about the leader's keynote address. So the event was the 1955 Suez Crisis. Or wait, perhaps it's the 1955 South African-Sudan War? No, I think the Suez Crisis was about the East African issue, so that's probably the correct answer.

Looking at the options, option E is the Suez Crisis. So the correct answer should be E.

The event mentioned in the question is the 1955 Suez Crisis, which occurred during the South African-Sudan War. This event was pivotal in the peace negotiations between Australia, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Soviet Union. It led to the closure of the Suez Canal in 1960 and the Battle of Suez in 1955, which resulted in the Suez Crisis.
