Okay, so I've got this alcohol mixture problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about mixing two alcohol solutions to get a desired concentration. Alright, I remember from school that these types of problems usually involve some algebra with the concentrations and the amounts of each solution. 

So, the problem says we have one liquid that's 74% alcohol and another that's 90% alcohol. We need to find out how many gallons of the 74% solution to mix with 5 gallons of the 90% solution to get a mixture that's 84% alcohol. The options are from A to J, with numbers like 1, 2, etc. 

Let me think about the steps involved. I think I should set up an equation based on the alcohol content before and after mixing. Let me denote the amount of the 74% alcohol solution as x gallons. So, the total volume of the mixture would be x + 5 gallons because we're adding 5 gallons of the 90% solution. 

The total alcohol from the 74% solution would be 0.74x gallons, and from the 90% solution, it's 0.90 * 5 gallons, which is 4.5 gallons. The total alcohol in the mixture should be 84% of the total volume. So the equation would be:

0.74x + 4.5 = 0.84(x + 5)

Now, I need to solve for x. Let me expand the right side first. 0.84 times x is 0.84x, and 0.84 times 5 is 4.2. So the equation becomes:

0.74x + 4.5 = 0.84x + 4.2

Hmm, let me subtract 0.74x from both sides to get the x terms on one side. That gives me:

4.5 = 0.10x + 4.2

Wait, because 0.84x minus 0.74x is 0.10x. Then, subtract 4.2 from both sides to isolate the term with x:

4.5 - 4.2 = 0.10x

Which is 0.3 = 0.10x. Now, dividing both sides by 0.10:

x = 0.3 / 0.10 = 3.

So x is 3 gallons. That means we need 3 gallons of the 74% alcohol solution. Let me make sure I did that correctly. If I add 3 gallons of 74% to 5 gallons of 90%, the total is 8 gallons. The total alcohol should be 84% of 8 gallons. Let's calculate that: 0.84 * 8 = 6.72 gallons. 

Let's check the alcohol from each solution. 3 gallons of 74% is 0.74 * 3 = 2.22 gallons. 5 gallons of 90% is 4.5 gallons. Adding those gives 2.22 + 4.5 = 6.72 gallons, which matches the required 6.72 gallons. So that checks out. 

Looking at the options, option A is 3 gallons, which matches our solution. So the answer should be A.
