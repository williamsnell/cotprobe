Question:

The World Series in baseball continues until either the American League team or the National League team wins four games. How many different orders are possible (e.g., ANNAAA means the American League team wins in six games) if the series goes four games?

B: 16
C: 6
D: 10
E: 5
F:  2
G: 12
H: 24
I: 8

Okay, so I've got this question about the World Series and I need to figure out the number of different orders possible when the series goes exactly four games. Hmm, the series goes until one team gets four wins, so if it's four games, that means one team won all four games in a row. 

Wait, the question says "different orders", but if it's four games, does that mean the order is just the team that won? Like, either the AL team won four games in a row, making the order just one sequence (e.g., AL wins four times). But that can't be right because the options don't include 1. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "how many different orders are possible if the series goes four games." So, perhaps it's considering different possible sequences of wins and losses that result in a four-game series, regardless of which team wins four games. Or maybe the question is about the possible orderings of the four wins among the teams.

Wait, no, the series goes four games. So, for example, the series could be AAAAA if the American League team wins all four, or LLLLL if the National League team wins all four. But that would mean only two possibilities, which is one of the options (option E:5, no, wait option F is 2, which matches this scenario). Wait, no, wait. Let me check the options again.

The options are A:4, B:16, C:6, D:10, E:5, F:2, G:12, H:24, I:8, J:1. So, wait, if the series goes four games, that could mean that either the AL or NL team wins four in a row. So, for AL winning four in a row, the order is AAAA, and for NL it's LLLL. So that's two possible orders. But wait, maybe that's not the case. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is talking about the possible sequences of games where the series ends after four games, regardless of which team was winning. But that doesn't make sense because if a team wins four games, the series ends. So the series would have four wins for one team. So, in that case, the only possible orders are the four wins in a row for AL or for NL. So that's two possible orders. But looking at the options, F is 2. So maybe that's the answer.

Wait, but wait. The question says, "different orders." So maybe there are more possibilities. Or perhaps the series can end before four games if one team gets to four wins earlier. But the question specifies that the series goes four games, so it's exactly four games. So, the series can't end earlier.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is considering the order of wins and losses, but the series ends when a team gets to four. But if the series goes four games, that implies that each team can't have already four wins in the first four games. So, for example, if the series is AAAA, that means the AL team won the first four, so the series ended there. Similarly, LLLL.

But wait, is there another possibility in four games where the series could have been decided earlier? Like, if in the first three games, one team has 3 wins and the other has 1, and then the fourth game decides it. But wait, the question is about a four-game series, so the series must go to four games. So, the only way the series can end in four games is if each team has exactly three wins in the first three, and then the fourth game gives one team the fourth win. Wait, but that would make the series go to four, but each team would have three wins in the first three, then one more to reach four.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think again. The World Series ends when either team reaches four wins. So, if in the first four games, a team reaches four, the series stops. So for a four-game series, the winning team must have exactly four wins in the first four games. So, the possible orders are only the four wins in a row for either team. So, that's two possible sequences: AL AAAA or NL LLLL.

But looking at the options, F is 2, which is that. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the series could have ended before four games if one team had four wins earlier. But the question says the series goes four games, so that's not the case. So the only orders are the four wins by one team in a row. So, two possibilities, which is option F.

The World Series ends when a team wins four games. If it goes exactly four games, the series must consist of one team winning all four games in a row. This results in only two possible orders: either the American League (AL) team wins all four games (AAAA) or the National League (NL) team wins all four games (LLLL). Therefore, there are two possible orders.

Answer: F: 2
