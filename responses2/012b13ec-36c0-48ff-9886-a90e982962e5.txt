Okay, so I have this question about social problems resulting from a genetic supermarket. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what a genetic supermarket is, but I think it's a term that refers to a hypothetical scenario where organisms, including humans, have access to genetic goods. These goods could be things like money, education, or other assets. The question is asking which social problem Singer would consider the least serious.

The options are A, B, C, D. Let me break down each one. 

First, option A is about loss of human diversity. If everyone has access to similar genetic goods, maybe people can't really differ much, leading to reduced diversity. That sounds serious, not the least serious.

Option B talks about engineering children to have positional goods. I'm not exactly sure what positional goods are. I think they might be goods that are ordered or assigned in a certain way, like having a certain number of children in a household. If parents are forced to have children with certain characteristics, that could lead to unequal opportunities and possibly race or social class. That might be a significant issue, but maybe not the least serious.

Option C is loss of equality of opportunity. If genes determine access to resources, then maybe some groups can't access them as much as others, leading to inequality. That seems serious because unequal opportunities can lead to disparities.

Option D is increased disparity between the rich and the poor. If genetic goods are evenly distributed, then disparities might be reduced. But wait, I'm not sure. If everyone can access similar goods, maybe the disparities from wealth and status get smaller. So that could be the least serious problem.

Wait, but the question is which is least serious. So, if the genetic goods are evenly distributed, then disparities between the rich and the poor would decrease because everyone can access similar resources. That makes option D the least serious.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If everyone has equal access to these goods, maybe the disparities caused by wealth and status are minimized. So yes, option D would be the least serious.

Alternatively, option B is about engineering children to have certain goods, which could lead to unequal access. But if the genes aren't the only factor, maybe the issue is that some children have more access than others, leading to disparities. But I'm not sure if that's more or less serious than just equal access leading to D.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to remember. Singer is a philosopher, I think. His work includes discussions on social inequality and access. If the genetic supermarket leads to equal access, then the disparities between the rich and poor would decrease. So D would be the least serious because it's the opposite of what the supermarket does.

So, the answer should be D.

The genetic supermarket, if it results in equal access to genetic goods, would lead to a least serious social problem. 

Answer: D
