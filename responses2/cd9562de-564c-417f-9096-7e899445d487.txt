Okay, so I have this physics problem here about lasers and interference fringes. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when light passes through a double slit, it creates an interference pattern on a screen. The bright fringes are formed due to constructive interference.

The question says that the separation between the slits (d) is 0.5 micrometers. Wait, micrometers to meters? Oh right, 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters. So d = 0.5e-6 m. Then the bright fringes are separated by 1.0 millimeter. Oh, millimeters to meters—1 mm is 1e-3 meters. So the distance between fringes (y) is 1e-3 m.

I think the formula for the fringe separation is y = (lambda * D) / d, where lambda is the wavelength, D is the distance to the screen, and d is the slit separation. Oh wait, but wait—when the frequency is changed, how does that affect lambda?

Wait, the problem says the frequency is doubled. Right, frequency f and wavelength lambda are inversely related. Because c = f * lambda. So if f doubles, lambda halves. So lambda_new = lambda_old / 2.

But wait, the original setup gave a certain y. So if we double f, then lambda becomes half. But what about D? Oh, the problem doesn't mention the distance to the screen changing. So I think it's the same screen, so D is the same.

So the new fringe separation y_new = (lambda_new * D ) / d.

Original y = (lambda_old * D) / d = 1e-3 m.

So lambda_old = (y * d) / D = (1e-3 m * 0.5e-6 m) / D?

Wait, no, that's not right. Let's think again. The original separation y is 1e-3 m. So y = (lambda * D) / d.

So lambda = (y * d) / D.

But since D doesn't change, if lambda is halved, then y_new = (lambda_new * D) / d = (lambda/2 * D) / d = (lambda D)/(2d) = (y * d / D) * D/(2d) ) = y / 2.

So yes, if the frequency is doubled (so lambda is halved), the fringe separation will be halved.

Original y was 1.0 mm, so now y_new is 0.5 mm. Looking at the options, E is 0.5 mm. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose the frequency doubles. Then the wavelength is halved. The formula for the fringe separation is y = (lambda * D) / d. So if lambda is half, y becomes half. So yes, 1 mm becomes 0.5 mm. So option E.

The problem involves a laser passing through a pair of narrow slits, producing bright fringes on a screen separated by a certain distance. The separation between the slits is given as 0.5 micrometers (d = 0.5e-6 m), and the bright fringes are observed to be separated by 1.0 millimeter (y = 1.0e-3 m). The frequency of the laser light is doubled, and the question asks for the new separation of the bright fringes.

The formula for the fringe separation in double-slit interference is:

\[
y = \frac{\lambda D}{d}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light, \( D \) is the distance to the screen, and \( d \) is the slit separation. Since \( D \) is constant, the fringe separation depends on \( \lambda \) and \( d \). Doubling the frequency of the laser light doubles the frequency (\( f \)), which is inversely related to the wavelength (\( \lambda \)) by the equation \( c = f \lambda \). Therefore, doubling \( f \) halves \( \lambda \) (\( \lambda_{\text{new}} = \lambda_{\text{old}} / 2 \)).

Substituting this into the fringe separation formula, the new fringe separation becomes:

\[
y_{\text{new}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{new}} D}{d} = \frac{(\lambda_{\text{old}} / 2) D}{d} = \frac{y_{\text{old}}}{2}
\]

Given that the original fringe separation \( y_{\text{old}} \) is 1.0 mm, the new fringe separation is:

\[
y_{\text{new}} = \frac{1.0 \, \text{mm}}{2} = 0.5 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the separation of the bright fringes will be halved when the frequency is doubled, resulting in a separation of 0.5 mm. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**E: 0.5 mm**
