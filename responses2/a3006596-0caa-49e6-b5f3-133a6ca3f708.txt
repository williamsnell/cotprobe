Okay, so I'm looking at this astrophysics question here. Let me try to figure it out. The question says that a burned-out star with a mass of at least three solar masses will collapse into a black hole. I remember that the radius of the event horizon (which is the Schwarzschild radius) is involved here. 

Wait, the formula for the Schwarzschild radius, right? I think it's something like R = 2GM/c². Yeah, I remember that. So G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass, and c is the speed of light. 

But wait, the question gives the radius in meters and asks for X * 10^3 meters. So I need to compute R in thousands of meters. Let me get the values right. 

Solar mass is about 1.9885 × 10^30 kg. So for a three solar mass star, the mass M is 3 * 1.9885e30 kg. Let me calculate that. 3 * 1.9885 is approximately 5.9655e30 kg.

The gravitational constant G is 6.6743×10^-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2. The speed of light c is about 3.00e8 m/s.

Putting it all together: R = 2 * G * M / c².

Let me plug the numbers in. 

First, calculate G*M. 6.6743e-11 * 5.9655e30. Let me see, 6.6743 *5.9655 is approximately let me compute that. Hmm, 6.6743 * 6 is about 40.04, but 5.9655 is a bit less than 6, so maybe around 40. Let me do it more accurately. 

Wait, 6.6743e-11 *5.9655e30 = 6.6743 *5.9655 * 1e( -11 +30 ) = 6.6743 *5.9655 *1e19.

Calculating 6.6743 *5.9655: Let's compute 6 *5.9655 is 35.793, and 0.6743 *5.9655 is approximately 4.016. So together, 35.793 +4.016 is about 39.809. So 39.809e19 m³/s²? Wait, no, because G*M is in m³/s², and then divided by c² which is m²/s². So the units would be m³/s² * s²/m² = m, which is correct.

So G*M = 39.809e19 m³/s²? Wait, no, wait: 6.6743e-11 *5.9655e30 = (6.6743 *5.9655) * 1e(-11+30) ) → 6.6743 *5.9655 is about 40, but precise calculation is better. Let me compute 6.6743 ×5.9655.

I'll compute it more accurately: 6 *5.9655 = 35.793. 0.6743 *5.9655: 0.6 *5.9655=3.5793, 0.07 *5.9655=0.4176, 0.0043*5.9655≈0.0256. Adding these: 3.5793+0.4176=4.0, 4.0 +0.0256=4.0256. So total 35.793 +4.0256=39.8186 (approx). So 39.8186e19 m³/s². 

Then R = 2 * G*M / c² → 2 * (39.8186e19) / (9e16) [since c² is (3e8)^2 =9e16 m²/s²]. 

Wait, let's compute 2 *39.8186e19 = 79.6372e19. Divided by 9e16. So 79.6372e19 / 9e16 = (79.6372 /9 ) * 1e(19-16) → approximately 8.8486 *1e3. Wait, 79.6372 divided by 9 is roughly 8.8486. So 8.8486e3 meters. 

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake because 2 * (39.8186e19) is 79.6372e19, which is 7.96372e20. Then divide by 9e16 → (7.96372e20) / (9e16) = 7.96372e20 /9e16 = (7.96372 /9 ) * 1e4. Let me compute 7.96372 /9 → about 0.88486. So 0.88486e4 → 8848.6 meters. 

Wait, but wait, I thought the Schwarzschild radius for a 3 solar mass would be about 2953 km, which is 2.953e6 m? Wait, no, wait, wait. Did I get the numbers wrong? Because I thought the formula is R = 2GM/c². Let me think about the actual Schwarzschild radius calculation.

Wait, for the Sun, which is about 1.988e30 kg. R_s = 2*(6.67e-11 m³/kg/s²)*(1.988e30 kg)/(9e16 m²/s²). Let me compute that. 

Compute numerator: 6.67e-11 * 1.988e30 → 6.67 *1.988 ≈13.27, and exponents 1e-11 *1e30 =1e19 →13.27e19. So 1.327e20.

Divide by 9e16: 1.327e20 /9e16 = (1.327/9)*1e4 = approximately 0.1474 *1e4 → 1474 meters, which is about 1.474e3 meters, or 1474 m. That's roughly 1.47e3, so 1.47 *1e3.

Oh wait, but for a 3 solar mass star, that would be 3 times that. So 3 * 1474 m is 4422 meters, which is 4.422e3 meters, or 4.422 *1e3.

But wait, the options don't go that high. The options are in the range of 5 to 12.7, times 1e3. Wait, but wait, wait — no, the options have X *1e3. So, wait, the question says, "the radius of its event horizon is X * 1e3 m." So in the case of a 3 solar mass star, R is 4422 m, so X is 4.422. But none of the options are that. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check. Oh wait, wait, the formula is R = 2GM/c². But I thought that for a 3 solar mass star, the Schwarzschild radius is about 2953 km, which is 2.953e3 km. Wait, 2953 km is 2.953e6 meters. Oh wait, wait a minute — no, wait, 1 km is 1e3 m. So 2.953e6 meters is 2953 km. That's correct.

Wait, so for a 3 solar mass, R = 2.953e6 m. So in terms of X * 1e3, that's 2953 m. So X is 2.953. But looking at the options, none of the numbers are near 2.953. The options are A:7.7, B:14.8, C:9.4, D:8.9, E:11.1, F:6.5, G:3.6, H:10.2, I:12.7, J:5.3. Hmm, none match 2.953.

Wait, this suggests that perhaps I've made a miscalculation. Maybe I got the formula wrong? Let me think again.

Wait, the Schwarzschild radius R = 2GM/c². For a 3 solar mass star, M is 3*1.9885e30 kg → 5.9655e30 kg. Plugging into formula: R= 2*(6.6743e-11 m³/kg/s²)*(5.9655e30 kg)/(9e16 m²/s²). Let me compute this step by step.

Compute numerator: 2 *6.6743e-11 *5.9655e30. Let's compute 6.6743e-11 *5.9655e30: 6.6743 *5.9655 ≈40, so 40e19. Multiply by 2: 80e19.

Denominator: 9e16.

So R = 80e19 / 9e16 → (80/9)*1e3 → approx 8.888 *1e3 → 8888 meters. So R is about 8.888e3 meters, which is 8888 m, so X is 8.888. Looking at the options, option D is 8.9. So that would match.

Wait, but earlier I thought a 3 solar mass star's R is about 2.953e6, which is 2953 km (2.953e3 km). But according to the calculation, it's 8888 meters, which is 8.888e3 m. So why the discrepancy? Oh, wait, because I'm confusing the formula perhaps. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the formula uses M in solar masses. Let me recalculate with the exact formula and the exact M.

Wait, the Schwarzschild radius for a 3 solar mass star: R = (2 * G * (3 M_sun)) / c².

Wait, the exact formula is R = (2 * G * M )/(c²), where M is in kg. Let me compute it precisely.

G = 6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²)
M =3 * 1.9885e30 kg =5.9655e30 kg

So R = 2 *6.6743e-11 *5.9655e30 / (9e16)

Let me compute numerator: 6.6743e-11 *5.9655e30 → Let's compute 6.6743 *5.9655 = 40? Wait, let me compute more accurately.

6.6743 × 5.9655:

Let's compute 6 *5.9655=35.793.

0.6743 *5.9655:

0.6 *5.9655 =3.5793

0.07 *5.9655=0.417585

0.0043 *5.9655 ≈0.0256

So adding all: 35.793 + 3.5793 =39.3723, plus 0.417585 →39.789885, plus 0.0256 →39.815485.

So 6.6743 *5.9655 ≈39.8155.

So 39.8155 *1e-11 +30 → 39.8155e19. So 39.8155e19.

Multiply by 2: 79.631e19 =7.9631e20.

Denominator: 9e16.

So R=7.9631e20 /9e16 = (7.9631/9) *1e4 → 0.8848 *1e4 = 8848 meters.

So R is 8,848 meters, which is 8.848e3 m. So X is 8.848. Looking at the options, option D is 8.9. So the answer should be D.

To determine the radius of the event horizon (Schwarzschild radius) of a burned-out star with a mass of at least three solar masses, we use the formula:

\[
R = \frac{2GM}{c^2}
\]

### Step 1: Constants and Parameters
- **Gravitational constant**: \( G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \)
- **Speed of light**: \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Solar mass**: \( M_{\odot} = 1.9885 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \)
- **Mass of the star**: \( M = 3 \, M_{\odot} = 3 \times 1.9885 \times 10^{30} = 5.9655 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \)

### Step 2: Calculation
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
R = \frac{2 \cdot G \cdot M}{c^2}
\]

1. Compute \( G \cdot M \):
   \[
   G \cdot M = (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (5.9655 \times 10^{30}) = 3.9818 \times 10^{20} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{s}^{-2}
   \]

2. Multiply by 2:
   \[
   2 \cdot (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (5.9655 \times 10^{30}) = 7.9636 \times 10^{20} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{s}^{-2}
   \]

3. Divide by \( c^2 \):
   \[
   R = \frac{7.9636 \times 10^{20}}{(3.00 \times 10^8)^2} = \frac{7.9636 \times 10^{20}}{9.00 \times 10^{16}} = 8.848 \times 10^3 \, \text{m}
   \]

Thus, the radius of the event horizon is approximately \( 8.848 \times 10^3 \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to \( X = 8.848 \).

### Step 3: Match with Options
The closest option to \( X = 8.848 \) is **D: 8.9**.
