Okay, so I've got this problem about two convex lenses and their focal lengths. Hmm, I remember that when lenses are used together, their focal lengths add or subtract depending on their arrangement. Let me think.

The question says there are two thin convex lenses with focal lengths f₁ and f₂. They are separated by a distance equal to 2f₂. Oh wait, and f₁ is given as 3f₂. So f₁ is three times f₂. That's a clear relationship.

I think when you have two lenses in contact, their combined focal length can be found using the formula 1/f_total = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂. But wait, no, that's when they're placed one after the other, like in series. Oh right, if they're placed in contact, it's like they're in series. So the formula should be 1/f_total = (f₂ + f₁)/(f₁ * f₂). Wait no, wait. Wait, wait—maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let's think about it again.

Oh right! When lenses are placed in series, the formula for their combined focal length is 1/f = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂. But wait, no, that's not correct. Wait no, that's for resistors in parallel. No, wait, for resistors, if two resistors are in series, the total resistance is R_total = R₁ + R₂. But for focal lengths, it's the same because they're acting like resistors. So if two lenses are in series, their focal lengths add, but wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait no, wait—wait, the formula for combining thin lenses in series (like when you have two lenses next to each other) is 1/f_combined = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂. So if f₁ is 3f₂, then 1/f_combined = 1/(3f₂) + 1/f₂. Let's compute that: 1/(3f₂) is 1/3 of 1/f₂. Adding 1/f₂ would make it (1 + 3)/3f₂ = 4/(3f₂). So 1/f_combined is 4/(3f₂), which means f_combined is 3f₂/4. Wait, that's 0.75 f₂, but let me make sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the lenses are placed in a way that they're separated by a distance such that the first is at position 0 and the second is at 2f₂. So, the distance between them is 2f₂. Oh, but the formula depends on their positions. Wait, what's the formula when the two lenses are placed a certain distance apart?

Wait, when two thin convex lenses are separated by a distance d, the effective focal length depends on their individual focal lengths and the separation. The formula for the equivalent focal length is a bit more complex than the simple series or parallel case.

Wait, another approach: The combined focal length when two lenses are placed a distance d apart is given by the formula:

1/f = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) + (d)/(f₁ f₂)

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Hmm. Alternatively, the formula might be 1/f = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) - (d)/(f₁ f₂). Or maybe it's different. Another approach is to model the system as a combination of lenses. Think of the first lens as being at position 0, and the second at position d.

Wait, perhaps I should model the system by considering the image formed by the first lens, then seeing how the second lens affects that image.

Let me try that. Let's say the first lens has focal length f₁, and the second f₂. They are separated by a distance d = 2f₂. So, d is the distance between the two lenses.

Assuming the first lens is at position x=0, and the second at x = d = 2f₂. The image formed by the first lens is at a certain position, and then the second lens (if it's placed after the first) would form another image. Wait, but in that case, the formula for the combined focal length might be different.

Alternatively, another formula for two lenses separated by distance d is: 1/f_total = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) + (d)/(f₁ f₂). Wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, thinking of the two lenses as being placed with separation d. The first lens is at position 0, and the second at position d. The image formed by the first lens is at position v₁, given by 1/v₁ = 1/f₁ + 1/d (since the object is at infinity, but wait no, wait image formation—wait, actually, the image is formed at a distance v₁ from the first lens. So v₁ is where the image is formed by the first lens.

Wait, but perhaps I should model the situation using the lens formula for each lens.

Wait, let's say the first lens is at position x=0, and the second at x=d (d=2f₂). The object is at position x=0, the first lens, but wait no, perhaps the object is at some position, but maybe it's better to consider the image formed by the first lens, which then serves as the object for the second lens.

Wait, maybe I should think about it this way: The first lens has focal length f₁, and the second has f₂. They are separated by a distance d, which is 2f₂.

So the setup is: Object is at some position, first lens is placed next, then the second lens, with a separation of d between them.

Wait, but perhaps the object is at a position that is in front of the first lens. Let me think of the first lens as a positive focal length, so it's a converging lens.

Let's imagine the object is at a distance u from the first lens. The image is formed at v₁ from the first lens. Then, this image is the object for the second lens, located at d away from the first lens. So the object distance for the second lens is u' = v₁ - d. Wait, no, because the object for the second lens is the image formed by the first, so if the first image is at v₁ to the right of the first lens, the second lens is at distance d to the right of the first. So the object for the second is at position d + v₁.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to model the combined effect using the formula for two lenses in contact (separation d = 0), then adjust for d. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is 1/f_total = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂ - (d)/(f₁ f₂). That would make sense if the two lenses add their focal lengths in a certain way. Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about that.

Wait, another approach: Let's model the combined focal length using the formula for two lenses separated by distance d. The formula is:

1/f_total = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) + (d)/(f₁ f₂)

Wait, that's the same as 1/f_total = (f₂ + f₁ + d) / (f₁ f₂). So substituting d = 2f₂:

1/f_total = (f₁ + f₂ + 2f₂) / (f₁ f₂) ) = (f₁ + 3f₂) / (f₁ f₂)

Wait, but f₁ is 3f₂, so let's substitute:

f₁ = 3 f₂. So,

1/f_total = (3 f₂ + 3 f₂ + 2 f₂) / (3 f₂ * f₂) = (8 f₂) / (3 f₂²) )= (8) / (3 f₂)

So 1/f_total = 8/(3 f₂) → f_total = 3 f₂ /8.

Wait, but that's not an option. Let me check the options again. Oh, the options are:

Options:

A: (3f2)/2

B: (f1+f2)/2

C: (2f2)/3

D: 2f2

E:3f2/3 (which is f2)

F:5f2

G: (2f1)/3 → 2*(3f2)/3 = 2f2

H:3f1 →3*(3f2)=9f2

I:f2/3

J:4f2

Hmm, none of these match 3f₂/8. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the correct formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/f_total = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) - (d)/(f₁ f₂). Let's try that.

1/f_total = (f₂ + f₁)/(f₁ f₂) - d/(f₁ f₂) = (f₁ + f₂ - d) / (f₁ f₂)

Substituting d=2f₂, f₁=3f₂:

= (3f₂ + f₂ - 2f₂) / (3f₂ * f₂) = (2f₂) / (3 f₂²) = 2/(3 f₂) → f_total= 3f₂/2.

Ah! Then option A is (3f₂)/2. So is that correct? Let me think again.

Wait, another way: Maybe I should model the combined focal length by considering the image formed by the first lens, then the second lens acts to form another image.

Let me say the first lens has focal length f₁ =3f₂, and the second has f₂. They are separated by 2f₂.

So, first, the first lens forms an image. Using the lens formula, if the object is at a distance u from the first lens, the image is at v₁ = u f₁/(u - f₁). Wait, but I'm not sure about the object's position. If the object is at infinity, then the image is at v₁ = f₁ (so the first lens is a converging lens, so it's a real image at f₁ from the lens. But if the object is not at infinity, but let's assume the object is at some position.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the object at a distance u from the first lens. Then the image is at v₁ = u f₁/(u - f₁). But then, the second lens is placed at a distance d =2f₂ from the first. So the object for the second lens is at position (d + u - v₁) ? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let the first lens be at x=0, and the second at x= d=2f₂. The object is at position x=0. The first lens forms an image at position x= v₁. Then, the second lens is placed at x= d, and the object for the second lens is at x= v₁.

Wait, but that depends on where the image is formed by the first lens. But in this case, if the object is at x=0, and the first lens is converging, the image will be image at x= v₁, where v₁ = (f₁ * 0) / (0 - f₁) )=0/( -f₁) =0? No, that can't be right. Wait, wait, the object is at x=0, so u=0. So the image would be at v₁= [f₁ * u]/(u - f₁) → u is 0, so v₁=0/(0 - f₁)=0. Wait, that can't be right, because if the object is at the lens itself, the image would be at the focal point.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the object distance. If the object is placed at a distance u from the first lens (at x=0), then the image is formed at v₁ = u f₁/(u - f₁). But if u is the distance from the object to the lens. Wait, wait, wait, wait. The lens formula is 1/v = 1/u + 1/f. So for the object at u=∞, image is at f. For a real object at u < f, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object.

But perhaps I should model the object at a finite distance. Let's say the object is at some position, say, at a distance u from the first lens. The image would then be at v₁ = u f₁/(u - f₁). But if u is close to f₁, the image is formed at v₁= f₁^2/(u - f₁).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to consider the combined focal length as given by the formula I thought earlier: 1/f_total = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) - d/(f₁ f₂). Because when the separation d increases, the combined effect on the focal length would depend on this.

So substituting d=2f₂, f₁=3f₂:

1/f_total = (1/(3f₂) + 1/f₂) - (2f₂)/(3f₂ * f₂) 

Compute each term:

1/(3f₂) is (1)/(3f₂). 1/f₂ is (3)/(3f₂). Adding them gives (1+3)/(3f₂) =4/(3f₂).

Second term: (2f₂)/(3f₂^2) = 2/(3f₂).

So 1/f_total = 4/(3f₂) - 2/(3f₂) = (4-2)/(3f₂) = 2/(3f₂) → f_total = 3f₂ / 2.

Ah, which is option A: (3f₂)/2.

Alternatively, is there another way to get this result?

Wait, another approach is to use the formula for two lenses separated by a distance d:

1/f_total = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) + (d)/(f₁ f₂)

But we saw earlier that this would lead to 3f₂/8, which isn't among the options. So that must be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is 1/f_total = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) - (d)/(f₁ f₂). Which gives 3f₂/2, which is option A.

So based on this, the correct answer is option A.

To determine the focal length of the combination of two thin convex lenses, we start by noting the given relationships: the focal lengths of the lenses are \( f_1 = 3f_2 \) and the separation between them is \( d = 2f_2 \). The formula for the combined focal length of two lenses separated by a distance \( d \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2} - \frac{d}{f_1 f_2}.
\]

Substituting the given values:

1. \( f_1 = 3f_2 \),
2. \( f_2 = f_2 \),
3. \( d = 2f_2 \).

First, calculate the sum of the reciprocals of the focal lengths:

\[
\frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2} = \frac{1}{3f_2} + \frac{1}{f_2} = \frac{1 + 3}{3f_2} = \frac{4}{3f_2}.
\]

Next, calculate the term involving the separation \( d \):

\[
\frac{d}{f_1 f_2} = \frac{2f_2}{(3f_2)(f_2)} = \frac{2f_2}{3f_2^2} = \frac{2}{3f_2}.
\]

Substituting these into the formula for \( \frac{1}{f_{\text{total}}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{total}}} = \frac{4}{3f_2} - \frac{2}{3f_2} = \frac{2}{3f_2}.
\]

Finally, solving for \( f_{\text{total}} \):

\[
f_{\text{total}} = \frac{3f_2}{2}.
\]

Thus, the focal length of the combination is \( \frac{3f_2}{2} \), which corresponds to option **A**.
