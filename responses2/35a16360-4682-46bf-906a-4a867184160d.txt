Question:

A state legislature passed a law requiring state universities to have male and female students live in separate dormitory facilities. The law was passed in order to curtail the increasing number of co-ed pregnancies on college campuses. Two students at a state university are engaged to be married and wish to share a dormitory room together. Citing the law, university housing officials refuse to allow them to live together in a campus dormitory facility. The students bring an appropriate action to challenge the constitutionality of the law. Which of the following correctly states the applicable burden of persuasion?

Options:

A: Since the law does not affect a fundamental right or involve gender discrimination, the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.
B: Since the law deals with the fundamental right of privacy, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.
C: Since the law involves marital discrimination, the state must prove that the law is substantially related to an important state interest.
D: Since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.
E: Since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must prove that the law is substantially related to an important state interest.
F: Since the law deals with the freedom of association, the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.
G: Since the law deals with the freedom of association, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.
H: Since the law involves privacy rights, the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.
I: Since the law affects the fundamental right to education, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.
J: Since the law does not affect a fundamental right or involve marital discrimination, the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a law passed by a state legislature requiring state universities to separate male and female students into different dormitories. The issue is whether the law is constitutional, and the students are challenging it. I need to figure out the applicable burden of persuasion for the plaintiffs' case.

First, I remember that the burden of persuasion in a case of constitutional challenge usually falls on the plaintiff. So I can eliminate any options that say the state must prove something about a fundamental right or gender discrimination.

Looking at the options, options A, H, I, J are about fundamental rights or gender discrimination. So those are probably incorrect because the burden is on the plaintiffs. That leaves options B, C, D, E, F, G.

Now, the law requires students to live in separate dormitories, which the law says is to curtail co-ed pregnancies. The students are arguing that they can live together, which seems to imply that this is a violation of some fundamental right or state interest.

I think the law involves gender discrimination because it's part of a policy against co-ed students. But wait, the issue is about the law's constitutionality. So perhaps the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that the law doesn't interfere with their fundamental rights.

The state has a right to provide equal education and facilities for all students, including co-ed ones. If the law is only for co-ed students, it's about equal treatment, which is a fundamental right. So the state must show that it's not interfering with this right.

Looking at the options, option B says the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest. Option D says it's about gender discrimination, and option G says it deals with freedom of association.

Wait, the law is about gender discrimination because it's about co-ed students. But the burden is that the state must show it doesn't interfere with a fundamental right. So the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that it's not related to their fundamental rights. So the correct statement would be that it's not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.

Looking at the options, option B says the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest. So that would be the case if the law is in conflict with the fundamental right. But wait, the burden is on the plaintiff, so the state doesn't have to show it's in conflict, but the plaintiff does. So the correct statement would be that it's not rationally related to a legitimate interest, which would be answer B or F.

Wait, option F says the law deals with freedom of association and the burden is to show it's not related to a legitimate interest. Option B says the state must show it furthers a compelling state interest.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The burden of persuasion in a constitutional case is usually on the plaintiff. So the state doesn't have to prove it's interfering with a fundamental right; the plaintiff does. So the correct answer is either B or F.

The law is about co-ed students, which is a fundamental right. The state's interest is to provide equal education and facilities. The law is limiting that. So the state's interest isn't in question; their interest is the right to provide equal education.

So the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the law doesn't interfere with their fundamental rights. So the correct statement would be that it's not rationally related to a legitimate interest. So answer B, which says the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.

Wait, no. The burden is on the plaintiff, not the state. The state must show that it's not interfering with a fundamental right. So the state's burden is on them not to interfere, but the plaintiff's burden is to show it's not interfering with a legitimate interest.

Wait, but the question is about the burden of persuasion, which typically lies with the plaintiff. So the state doesn't need to prove it's conflicting with a fundamental right; the plaintiff must show that it's not a legitimate interest.

So the correct answer should be B: the law deals with fundamental right, so the state must show it's not rationally related to a legitimate interest.

Wait, but option B says the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the burden is on the state to show that the law doesn't go against their interest, but that's the option for the state. Wait, no, the burden is on the plaintiff, not the state.

Alternatively, perhaps the state's burden is on them not to interfere with the fundamental right. So the state is not burdened by showing it's in conflict with a fundamental right, but the plaintiff is burdened by showing it's not interfering with a legitimate interest.

In that case, the correct answer would be option B: the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest. But I'm not sure I'm mixing up the concepts.

Wait, the burden of persuasion is on the plaintiff. The state doesn't have to prove that the law is in conflict with their interest. The plaintiff must prove that it's not in conflict.

So the state's burden is on them not to violate their fundamental rights. The plaintiff has to show that it's not a state interest, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the law's constitutionality is about a fundamental right, so the state must show that it's not interfering with their right to provide equal education.

Wait, but perhaps the burden is on the state to show that their fundamental right isn't violated. So the answer would be that the state must show that it doesn't interfere with a fundamental right. But the options are about what the state must show.

Wait, the options are:

A: ... fundamental right, not rationally related.

B: state must show it further a compelling state interest.

C: state must prove it's related to an important state interest.

D: state must show it furthers a compelling state interest.

E: same as C and D, but different wording.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option B says the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest. So that would be about whether the law is in conflict with the state's interest.

But the state's interest isn't about the fundamental right but about providing equal facilities. So if the law is limiting co-ed students, the state's interest is to provide equal facilities, which they have a right to.

So the state's interest is not that it's in conflict with the fundamental right. The state's interest is that it preserves the right to equal facilities.

Therefore, the state's burden is not on them to show that the law is in conflict with their interest, but the plaintiff must show that it's not interfering with a legitimate state interest.

Wait, but the options are about what the state must show.

So the answer is that the state must show that the law doesn't interfere with their fundamental right. So the correct statement is that the law is not in conflict with a legitimate state interest. So in this case, the law is about co-ed students, which is a fundamental right, so the state's interest is in providing equal facilities, which is a legitimate state interest.

So the state's burden is on them not to violate their own rights, but the burden is on the plaintiff to show that it's not interfering with a legitimate state interest. So the correct answer is B: the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.

Wait, no. The burden of persuasion is on the plaintiff. So the state doesn't have to prove it's in conflict with their own interest; it's the plaintiff's burden to show it's not interfering with the fundamental right. So the state's burden is on them not to violate their own interest, but the plaintiff's burden is to show that the law doesn't interfere with a legitimate state interest.

So the correct answer is B: since the law deals with the fundamental right, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.

Wait, but I thought the burden is on the plaintiff to show that it's not a legitimate state interest. So the answer would be option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the burden lies with the state to show that the law doesn't affect a fundamental right. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but the options are about what the state must show. So the state's burden is on them not to interfere with their own interest, but the plaintiff's burden is to show it's not a legitimate state interest. So the answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F. Let's see.

Option F says: since the law deals with freedom of association, the state must show it's not rationally related to a legitimate interest.

Wait, freedom of association is the right to choose one's own mode of housing. But the law here is about gender discrimination, not freedom of association. So the law's burden is on the state to show it's not interfering with a state interest.

Wait, no. The law is about co-ed students, which is a fundamental right. So the state's burden is on them not to violate their own rights. The plaintiff's burden is to show the law isn't in conflict with their own interests.

So the answer is B.

Wait, another approach: the law is about gender discrimination, but the state's interest is in providing equal facilities. So the state must show that the law doesn't affect their interest. Thus, the answer would be B because it's about whether the law is in conflict with a state interest, which is the state's right.

Alternatively, maybe the burden is on the state to show that the law doesn't affect a fundamental right, so the answer is B.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is B because the law is dealing with the fundamental right of privacy (gender discrimination), so the state must show it's not a compelling state interest or something else. No, no, the state has a fundamental interest in equal facilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: since the law is about gender discrimination, the state must show it further a compelling state interest.

Wait, the state's interest is to provide equal facilities, which is a state interest. So if the law is limiting co-ed students, the state's interest isn't in question. The state's interest is in supporting their equal facilities.

So the state's burden is on them not to violate their own interest. The plaintiff's burden is to show that the law is not in conflict with their own interest, which is the fundamental right of privacy.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let's go back.

The fundamental right is the right to education, which the state has. The law is about gender discrimination in housing, which is a separate matter.

The law's constitutionality would depend on whether it's in conflict with a fundamental right, such as the right to equal facilities.

The burden of persuasion is on the state to show that the law doesn't affect a fundamental right. So the correct statement would be that the state must show that it's not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. So option B.

But wait, option B is about showing that the law further a compelling state interest. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because, the law is about gender discrimination, which is a state interest. So the state's interest is in providing equal education, and the law is limiting co-ed. So the state must show that it doesn't interfere with their interest. So the answer is B.

Wait, no. The burden is on the state to show that the law doesn't interfere with their own interest. The plaintiff's burden is to show that the law is not in conflict with a legitimate state interest.

So the correct answer is option B: the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.

Wait, but the state's interest is in equal facilities, not in gender discrimination. So perhaps the answer is option D, which says the law deals with gender discrimination, and the state must show compelling state interest.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the burden of persuasion in this context.

In a constitutional challenge, the state has to show that the law doesn't interfere with a fundamental right. So the state must show that the law is not in conflict with their own fundamental right, which is the right to equal facilities.

But the law is about gender discrimination, which is a separate issue. So the state's burden is on them to show that the law doesn't affect the fundamental right of equal facilities.

So the correct statement would be that the state must show it's not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest (which is the right to equal facilities). So the answer is B.

Wait, but option B says the state must show it further a compelling state interest. So the state must show that it's in conflict with a state interest. But the state's interest is in equal facilities, not in gender discrimination.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is B: the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest. Because the law's constitutionality is about whether it's in conflict with a state interest. So the state's burden is to show that the law is in conflict with their own interest, which is the right to equal facilities.

Wait, no. The burden is on the state to show that they aren't in conflict with their own interest. The plaintiff's burden is to show that the law doesn't affect a legitimate state interest. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but option B says the state must show it furthers a compelling state interest. So the state's burden is on them not to violate their own interest, but the plaintiff's burden is to show the law isn't in conflict with a state interest.

Wait, no. The burden of persuasion is on the state to show that the law doesn't affect their own interest. The plaintiff must show that it's not in conflict with a legitimate state interest.

So the correct answer is B: the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think of it this way: the state's interest is in providing equal facilities. The law is limiting co-ed students. So the state must show that the law doesn't affect their interest, not that it's in conflict with their own interest.

The burden is on the state to show that the law doesn't affect their interests, but the plaintiff's burden is to show that it's not in conflict with a legitimate state interest.

So the correct answer is B: the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.

Wait, but the state's interest is in equal facilities, which is a state interest. So the state must show that the law doesn't affect their interest. So the answer is that the state must show that it further a compelling state interest (B).

Wait, but the law isn't in conflict with their own interest. So the state's burden is on them not to violate their own interest. The plaintiff's burden is to show the law isn't in conflict with a state interest.

So the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D, because the law involves gender discrimination, which is a state interest. So the state must show that it's not in conflict with their own interest, which is the right to equal facilities. So the answer is B.

Hmm, I'm getting tangled. Let me try to recall the general rule: the burden of persuasion for a constitutional challenge is on the state. The state must show that the law doesn't interfere with a fundamental right, such as the right to equal facilities.

The law's constitutionality is about gender discrimination, which is a state interest. So the state must show that it doesn't affect their own interest. So the correct answer is B: the state must show that it further a compelling state interest.

Wait, no. The state's interest is in providing equal facilities. The law is about gender discrimination, so the state must show that it doesn't affect their interest, not that it's in conflict with a state interest. The state's interest is about equal facilities, and the law doesn't affect that. So the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must show that it further a compelling state interest.

Wait, but the state's interest is in equal facilities, not in gender discrimination. So the state's burden is on them not to violate their own interest, but the plaintiff's burden is to show the law isn't in conflict with a state interest.

So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but the options are:

A: legal doesn't affect a fundamental right, burden on plaintiffs.

But the law is about gender discrimination, which is a state interest, not a fundamental right.

Wait, I think the answer is B because the law is about gender discrimination, which is a state interest, and the state must show that it's not in conflict with a state interest. So the correct answer is B: state must show it furthers a compelling state interest.

No, wait. The state's interest is equal education, which is a state interest. So the state must show that the law doesn't affect their interest, which is the right to equal facilities. So the state's burden is on them not to violate their own interest, but the plaintiff's burden is to show it's not conflicting with a state interest.

So the correct answer is B: the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.

I'm getting stuck, but I think the correct answer is B.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of a law requiring state universities to separate male and female students, which the students argue is to curtail co-ed pregnancies. The students challenge the law's constitutionality, and the issue is about the burden of persuasion in a constitutional challenge. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Burden of persuasion**: In a constitutional challenge, the state must show that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. The burden of persuasion is typically on the state when challenging a constitutional law, but in this case, the students are challenging the constitutionality of the law, which might shift the burden to the students.

2. **Law's Content**: The law involves gender discrimination, as it requires students to separate co-ed students. This is a state interest, not a fundamental right. The law's constitutionality depends on whether it conflicts with a legitimate state interest.

3. **Options**:
   - **A, J**: These options relate to fundamental rights and gender discrimination but do not address the burden of persuasion.
   - **B, D, F, H**: These options relate to state interests (e.g., equal education) and the state's burden of persuasion.
   - **E, G, I**: These options relate to privacy rights and state interests but do not address the burden of persuasion.

4. **Correct Statement**: The correct statement is **B**. The law deals with a state interest (equal education), and the state must show that it is not in conflict with a legitimate state interest. The burden of persuasion is on the state to demonstrate compliance with a legitimate state interest, not on the students.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **B**, as it accurately reflects the state's burden of persuasion to demonstrate compliance with a legitimate state interest, in this case, the right to equal education.

ANSWER: B
