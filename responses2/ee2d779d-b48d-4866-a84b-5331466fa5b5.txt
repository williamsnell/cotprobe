Okay, so I need to figure out which of these options is equal to one square foot. Hmm, I remember that a foot is 12 inches, so a square foot would be a foot by a foot. Let me think about the math here. 

One square foot is 12 inches by 12 inches. To find the area in square inches, I multiply 12 by 12. Let me do that: 12 times 12 is 144. So, 1 square foot equals 144 square inches. 

Looking at the options, I see option H is 144 square inches. So that should be the correct answer. Let me check the other options to make sure none of them match. 

Option A is 150, which is more. Then B is 300, way higher. C is 100, which is less. D is 50, still lower. E is 225, which is more than 144. F is 77, way lower. G is 125, which is close but not 144. H is 144, which is exactly what I calculated. J is 175, which is more than needed. 

So yes, H is the correct choice.

The correct answer is **H: 144 square inches**, as 1 square foot equals 144 square inches.
