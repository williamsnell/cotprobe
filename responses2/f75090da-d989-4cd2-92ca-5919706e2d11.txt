Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about what happens when food is exposed to gamma radiation. I'm a bit rusty on my radiation biology, but I'll try to think it through. Let's break it down.

The question asks, "When food is exposed to gamma radiation, the food..." with options from A to J. I remember that radiation can affect living organisms, but how specifically to food?

Gamma radiation is a type of ionizing radiation, right? It's one of the types of radiation that can penetrate biological tissues, but I think it's less effective than alpha or beta radiation. So, when it's absorbed by food, what happens?

Option A says avoid it. But I think the opposite is true. If you eat something that's exposed to gamma, you don't have to avoid it. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: becomes slightly radioactive. Wait, gamma radiation doesn't directly cause the food to become radioactive. It's the food itself that would. So B might not be correct because the food isn't radioactive; it's the radiation that's causing the change.

Option C: will become carcinogenic. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. I recall that some foods can be exposed to ionizing radiation. I think some insects are known to eat radioactive foods and get cancer, but that's more of a risk factor, not a guarantee. So might be a possibility, but I'm not certain.

Option D: becomes inedible. Inedible is a term used for something that's too strong to digest. I'm not sure how gamma radiation affects cooking temperature. Maybe if the food is exposed, it cooks more, but inedibility is more about being beyond the human digestive system's capacity. I don't think gamma radiation affects that directly.

Option E: will glow in the dark. Glowing in the dark sounds more like the effect of ultraviolet or UV radiation. Gamma isn't that high energy. So E is probably not correct.

Option F: will spoil faster. Spoiling faster is more about temperature. High-energy radiation like gamma may heat the food more, but I'm not sure if it affects spoilability. Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option G: doesn’t become radioactive. Yes, I think this is true. Gamma radiation itself is not radioactive; it's the energy it carries that's dangerous. So the food remains unradioactive. So G is correct.

Option H: will lose all nutritional value. I don't think so. Radiation doesn't necessarily degrade the nutritional structure. It just affects the stability or ability to process the food. So H is incorrect.

Option I: will taste differently. That could happen if the exposure changes the taste, but I don't remember any specific effect of gamma radiation on taste. It's more about the chemicals in the food.

Option J: will taste differently. Hmm, same as I, I don't think this is a correct statement.

So looking back, the correct options are G and possibly others? Wait, wait. Let me reevaluate. The question is about what happens when exposed to gamma radiation. So, if the food isn't radioactive (G), but what about the others?

The question is about the effect on the food. So, if the food becomes radioactive, that would make it a problem. But gamma doesn't cause the food to become radioactive. So B is incorrect because the food isn't radioactive; it's the radiation that does the making.

So, the only correct option seems to be G: doesn’t become radioactive. The others don't fit as well. So the answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: "doesn’t become radioactive." Gamma radiation affects living organisms, but it does not cause the food itself to become radioactive. The other options either propose incorrect effects or are not supported by scientific evidence. 

Answer: G
