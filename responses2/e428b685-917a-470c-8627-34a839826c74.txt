Okay, I'm trying to figure out which of these options was not a landmark antitrust act. Let me start by recalling what antitrust acts are. Antitrust laws prevent businesses from engaging in practices that harm competition, like price fixing or anti-competitive behavior. Landmark acts are those that have had a significant impact on the antitrust process, often defining the rules or regulations that are still in place today.

Looking at the options:

A: The Antitrust Improvement Act. I know this is an early antitrust act. It was passed in 1915 and focused on regulating anti-competitive practices. Definitely a landmark.

B: The Federal Trade Commission Act. That's a bit confusing. Wait, I thought the FTC was established later. Oh, wait, no, the FTC was established under the Act of the Congress of the United States, which was passed in 1883. But the actual act, which became the FTC, was passed in 1926. So this is more of an implementation, not a creation. So B might not be a landmark antitrust act in the same way as the others.

C: The Clayton Act. That rings a bell. The Clayton doctrine was established in 1890, so the Clayton Act was passed in 1914. It was a landmark because it established the Clayton Antitrust Act, which was a key component of the FTC. So C is a landmark.

D: The Sherman Act. Wait, the Sherman Antitrust Law was passed in 1890, but it's now known as the Sherman Act. It's not part of the antitrust laws anymore. It's been superseded by the FTC. So D is not an antitrust act in the same sense; it's more of a legal statute that's no longer relevant.

E: The Fair Trade Act. I'm not sure about this one. I think it's more about consumer protection, promoting fair trade practices. It wasn't an antitrust act but a consumer protection law. So E might not be an antitrust act at all.

F: The Wagner Act. Wagner's law was established in 1893, and the Wagner Antitrust Act was passed in 1910. It's another early antitrust act. So F is a landmark.

G: The Robinson-Patman Act. That's a well-known antitrust law passed in 1934. It's a key component of the FTC and a landmark antitrust law. So G is a landmark.

So the options are B, D, E, F, G. The question is about which wasn't a landmark. So the answer is D, the Sherman Act, because it's no longer an antitrust law but a consumer protection law.

The Sherman Act, option D, was not a landmark antitrust act. It was a consumer protection law established in 1890 and has since been superseded by the Fair Trade Act and the Robinson-Patman Act.

Answer: D
