Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of sodium ions in human blood serum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

So the question says that each liter of human blood serum has about 3.4 grams of sodium ions. Sodium has an ionic weight of 23 g per mole. And the question is asking for the molarity of Na+ in the blood serum. Molarity is moles per liter, right? So I need to find out how many moles of Na+ are in one liter of blood and then see what that is in terms of concentration.

Wait, the units are grams, so I'll have to convert that to moles. Oh, right, molarity is moles per liter, so grams would need to be converted to moles first.

The formula for molarity (M) is M = (moles of solute) / (liters of solution). So I need to find moles of Na+.

So, moles = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol). Oh wait, the molar mass is given as 23 g/mol. But wait, sodium has an ionic weight, which I think is the same as molar mass, so that's correct.

So, 3.4 grams divided by 23 g/mol. Let me calculate that.

3.4 / 23 equals... let's see. 23 goes into 3.4 once, but wait, 23*0.15 is 3.45. Oh wait, wait, 3.4 divided by 23 is 0.1478... so approximately 0.1478 moles per liter.

Wait, but I need to make sure the units are correct. Sodium is Na+, and in the problem, the units are grams per liter. So the calculation is correct.

So the molarity is approximately 0.1478 M. Let me look at the options. Option A is 0.15 M, which is close. Option B is 0.10, which is lower. Hmmm.

Wait, wait another thing. Oh, wait, I think I remember that blood serum is about 0.14 M sodium, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 3.4 grams divided by 23 g/mol is 0.1478... so about 0.148 M. That's 0.15 M when rounded to two decimal places. So the closest option is A: 0.15 M.

But wait, another thought. I think the sodium in the blood serum is actually about 0.14 to 0.15 M? Because I've heard that human blood is about 0.15 M sodium, but I'm not sure. Let me think about it differently.

Wait, sodium's human blood is about 0.14 to 0.15 M. So for example, if someone has 3.4 grams of Na+ in 1 liter, that's 3.4 / 23 = 0.1478, which is approximately 0.15 M. So the answer would be option A.

Looking back at the options:

A: 0.15 M
B: 0.10 M
C:1.48 M (That's way higher)
D:2.30 (that's even higher)
E:3.4 (trivially wrong)
F:1.00
G:23 M (obviously wrong)
H:0.34 (twice as much as option A)
I:0.50
J:0.23

So the correct answer must be A: 0.15 M.

To determine the molarity of Na⁺ in human blood serum, we start with the given information: each liter contains 3.4 grams of sodium ions, and the ionic weight of Na⁺ is 23 g/mol. Molarity is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molarity (M)} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}
\]

First, convert the mass of Na⁺ to moles using the molar mass:

\[
\text{Moles of Na⁺} = \frac{\text{Mass of Na⁺ (g)}}{\text{Molar mass of Na⁺ (g/mol)}} = \frac{3.4}{23} \approx 0.1478 \, \text{moles}
\]

Since the solution is 1 liter, the molarity is approximately:

\[
\text{Molarity} \approx 0.1478 \, \text{M}
\]

This value rounds to 0.15 M. Comparing this result with the provided options, the closest match is **Option A: 0.15 M**.
