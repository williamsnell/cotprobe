Okay, so I need to figure out how fast the water level is dropping at noon. The problem says the water level varies sinusoidally, which I remember means it's going to involve a sine or cosine function. Let me jot down the details.

At high tide, which is today at 8 A.M., the water level is 15 feet. Then, 6 hours later, which is 2 P.M., it's low tide at 3 feet. So, the time between high and low tide is 6 hours. Since high and low are opposite points on a sine wave, the period here would be twice that, so 12 hours. That makes sense because the time between high and low is half the period.

So, the general form of a sinusoidal function is y = A cos(Bt + C) + D or something like that. But since high tide is at 8 A.M. and low at 2 P.M., maybe I should model it with a cosine function that peaks at 8 A.M. and has a low at 2 P.M.

Let me think about the amplitude first. The difference between high and low is 15 - 3 = 12 feet. Since amplitude is half the distance between high and low, that would be 6 feet. So, A is 6.

Next, the vertical shift D. The average between high and low is (15 + 3)/2 = 9. So, the function will be centered around 9 feet.

The period is 12 hours, so the coefficient B is 2π divided by the period. So, B = 2π/12 = π/6.

Now, since high tide is at 8 A.M., I need to adjust the phase shift so that at t = 0 (8 A.M.), the cosine function is at its maximum. Cosine starts at 1 (the maximum) when the phase shift is 0, but in this case, the high tide is at t = 0. So, maybe I don't need a phase shift. 

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The standard cosine function is y = A cos(Bt) + D. At t = 0, cos(0) is 1, so y would be A + D. Since the maximum is 15, that would be 6 + 9 = 15. So that works. So, the function is y = 6 cos((π/6) t) + 9.

Wait, but wait: at t = 0, which is 8 A.M., y = 15. Then, 6 hours later, t = 6, y = 3. Let me check that.

At t=6: y = 6 cos( (π/6)*6 ) + 9 = 6 cos(π) + 9 = 6*(-1) + 9 = 3. That's correct.

So, the function is correct: y = 6 cos( (π/6) t ) + 9. 

Now, the question is about the rate of change at noon. Noon today is 12 P.M., which is 4 hours after 8 A.M. So, t = 4.

To find how fast the water level is dropping, I need the derivative of y with respect to t, evaluated at t=4.

The derivative dy/dt = -6*(π/6) sin( (π/6) t ) = -π sin( (π/6) t )

At t=4, dy/dt = -π sin( (π/6)*4 ) = -π sin( (2π/3) )

What's sin(2π/3)? That's sqrt(3)/2. So, dy/dt = -π*(sqrt(3)/2) = -(π sqrt(3))/2.

But the question asks how fast it's dropping. Since it's the rate of change, which is the magnitude, but since it's negative, the rate is π sqrt(3)/2 feet per hour. Because the derivative is negative, indicating a drop.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is π√3/2. So, the answer is F.

Wait, but let me check again. Maybe the derivative is positive or negative.

Wait, no. The derivative is dy/dt = -π sin(θ), where θ is (π/6)*t.

At t=4, θ is 2π/3. sin(2π/3) is sqrt(3)/2, so dy/dt is -π*(sqrt(3)/2). So, the rate is negative, meaning the water level is decreasing at that rate of π√3/2 feet per hour. So, the answer is F.

Wait, but looking back at the problem, the question says "how fast, in feet per hour, was the water level dropping at noon today?" So, it's the magnitude of the rate of change, but since the question specifies "how fast", perhaps they just want the magnitude, which is positive. So, yes, the rate is π√3/2, which is option F.

To determine how fast the water level is dropping at noon, we model the water level as a sinusoidal function. The high tide at 8 A.M. (t=0) is 15 feet, and low tide at 2 P.M. (t=6) is 3 feet. This indicates a period of 12 hours, giving a frequency of π/6 per hour. The vertical shift is 9 feet, and the amplitude is 6 feet. The function is y = 6 cos(πt/6) + 9. The derivative dy/dt = -π sin(πt/6). At t=4 (noon), sin(2π/3) = √3/2, so dy/dt = -π√3/2. The water level is dropping at a rate of π√3/2 feet per hour, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
