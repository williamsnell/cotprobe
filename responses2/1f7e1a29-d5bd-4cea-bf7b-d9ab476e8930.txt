Okay, so I have this question about whether two statements are true or false. Let me read it again.

The question is about two statements about life satisfaction and life events. The statements are:

1. As countries get richer, the population tends to report higher average life satisfaction.
2. Important life events such as marriage or divorce do affect our happiness, but have surprisingly little long-term impact.

And the options are A through J, each giving a combination of whether each statement is true or false.

So I need to figure out if each statement is true or false based on current knowledge, as of 2020.

Starting with statement 1: "As countries get richer, the population tends to report higher average life satisfaction." I remember that life satisfaction often relates to happiness and quality of life. Richer countries might have more resources and better access to higher quality of life, which could lead to higher life satisfaction. But is this a proven fact?

I think there's some research, but I'm not sure if it's widely accepted. For example, studies on happiness often look at data from surveys, but they're not always conclusive. Maybe in recent years, more data has shown a correlation, but could it be that it's still not proven? Or perhaps it's a topic of ongoing debate.

Then statement 2: "Important life events such as marriage or divorce do affect our happiness, but have surprisingly little long-term impact." So, these events do impact happiness, but the effect isn't significant in the long run. I've heard that people's decisions about marriage and divorce often don't last their entire lives. For example, people might divorce unexpectedly, which can lead to emotional trauma. So, maybe this statement is partially true, as it's correct. But is it true or not? I think the statement says "surprisingly little impact," implying that the long-term effect isn't significant. That seems accurate.

So, statement 1: Is it true? I'm not certain. I think it's possible that the trend is there, but I'm not certain it's proven. Maybe it's still a topic of ongoing research. Alternatively, if recent studies haven't conclusively proven it, the statement would be false.

Statement 2: The statement is partially true. It says life events affect happiness but have little long-term impact. That seems correct, so statement 2 is true.

Putting it together, statement 2 is true. Statement 1's truth is debatable; perhaps it's still not proven, so it's false.

Looking at the options:

Option E is "The first statement is partially true, the second is false." But I think statement 2 is true, so E would be false there.

Option F is "The first statement is true, the second is unproven." No, because statement 2 is true, but how about its unproven status?

Wait, statement 2 is correct, but is it unproven? The statement says it's unproven. The second part of statement 2 says "surprisingly little long-term impact." I think that part is true because I've heard that the effects of marriage/divorce on life satisfaction are small, but is it proven?

Hmm, maybe the statement is true, but is it correct? Let me think: if statement 2 is saying "important life events affect happiness, but have surprisingly little long-term impact." I think this is accurate. So statement 2 is true.

So, statement 1: I'm not sure. Is this true? Let's think. Richer countries often have better healthcare, more equitable resources, better education, etc. So higher life satisfaction should be higher, which suggests statement 1 is true. But is this proven? I think the literature may not conclusively prove this, as it's a social phenomenon. Alternatively, perhaps it's more of an assumption than a proven fact.

Wait, I remember reading that there's a correlation between wealth and life satisfaction, but it's not a proven fact. So statement 1's first part is partially true. So statement 1 is partially true.

So statement 1: partially true.

Statement 2: true.

So, looking at the options:

Option E is: The first statement is partially true, the second is false. But statement 2 is true. So E is incorrect.

Option F: First true, second unproven. But statement 2 is true, not unproven. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Both true. So that would be correct.

But wait, looking back, statement 1's truth is uncertain. If statement 1 is partially true, then the correct options would be either E or G.

Wait, option E says statement 1 is partially true, statement 2 is false. But statement 2 is true. So E is wrong.

Option G: Both statements are true. So that would be correct.

Wait, but I thought statement 2 is true, and statement 1 is partially true. But wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions.

Let me re-examine statement 1. If the trend is that richer countries have higher life satisfaction, but is this proven? Or is it just a general trend that isn't proven?

I think it's more likely that statement 1 is true, but not proven. Because if we look at data from surveys, perhaps there's a trend, but without a solid statistical proof, it's not considered proven. So statement 1 is partially true.

So, statement 1 is partially true, statement 2 is true. So the correct option would be G: Both statements are true.

Wait, but there's another possibility. Let me think again.

Statement 1: As countries get richer, the population tends to report higher average life satisfaction.

I've read that wealthier countries tend to report higher life satisfaction. But is this proven? For example, a study in 2020 might show that wealthier countries have higher life satisfaction, but without a definitive proof, it's not proven. So statement 1 is partially true.

Statement 2: Important life events do affect happiness, but have surprisingly little long-term impact. The statement is accurate, so it's true.

So, both statements are true, which would be option G.

Looking at the options:

F: First true, second unproven. No, because statement 2 is true.

G: Both statements are true. So that's correct.

Wait, but what about statement 1? Some sources say that wealthier countries have higher life satisfaction, but others argue that it's not a reliable indicator, or that other factors are more important.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is not supported by strong evidence, making it partially true.

Thus, the correct answer would be option F? Or G?

Wait, no. Option F says statement 1 is true, statement 2 is unproven. But statement 2 is definitely true. So that can't be.

Wait, no. Option F is: The first statement is true, the second is unproven. But statement 2 is true, so F is incorrect. Therefore, the only correct option is G: Both statements are true.
</think>

The correct answer is F. Both statements are partially true.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Statement 1 Analysis:**
   - As countries get richer, the population tends to report higher average life satisfaction.
   - This is a general trend observed in some surveys but is not definitively proven. Wealthier countries often have better resources and quality of life, which can contribute to higher life satisfaction. However, this is not a widely accepted proven fact, making the statement partially true.

2. **Statement 2 Analysis:**
   - Important life events such as marriage or divorce affect our happiness, but have surprisingly little long-term impact.
   - This statement is accurate and true. The impact of these events on long-term happiness is indeed minimal, aligning with the concept of "surprisingly little impact." Thus, statement 2 is true.

3. **Option Evaluation:**
   - **Option F:** Incorrect because statement 2 is true, not unproven.
   - **Option G:** Correct because both statements are true.
   - Other options either misrepresent the truth of the statements or mix them up.

**Answer:** F
