Alright, let's tackle this logic problem. So the question is about translating the statement: "All children go to some school." into predicate logic. The options are from A to J, each with a different structure. I'll need to break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the meaning of the original statement. "All children go to some school." So, every child is a person who is going to a school. But the wording "to some school" suggests that there's at least one school that the children go to. 

Breaking down the components:
- Cx: x is a child.
- Sx: x is a school.
- Gxy: x goes to y.

The original statement says that for every child x, there exists a school y that x goes to. Because "all children" implies that each one goes to some school, the structure would involve for every x, there exists a y such that x is a child, y is a school, and x goes to y.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ∀x(∃y)(Cx ∧ Sy ∧ Gxy)
Wait, no. Because Cx is a child, but Sy is a school. But in the original, the child is going to a school, so perhaps Sy should be a property of the child. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, the structure might need to ensure that each child is associated with a school, but the way it's written, it's saying x is a child, and x is a school, and x goes to y. That seems off because x can't be a school. I think this option is incorrect because it's mixing the properties of the child and school incorrectly.

Option B: ∀x[Cx ∧ (∃y)(Sy ⊃ Gxy)]
Hmm. So for all x, if x is a child and there exists a y where if x is a school (Sy), then x goes to y (Gxy). Wait, this might not be right. The way it's phrased is: all children go to some school. So for each child, there's a school that they go to. But in the predicate, the way it's written here is that if x is a child and x is a school, then x goes to y. But that seems to imply that x is a school, but x is a child. So that's a contradiction. Maybe this option is not correct.

Option C: ∀x[Sx → (∃y)(Cy ∧ Gxy)]
So for all x, if x is a school, then there exists a y such that x is a child (Cy) and y is where x goes (Gxy). Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Because this is saying all schools have children who go there, which is a different statement. The original is about children going to schools, not schools having children. So this might be incorrect.

Option D: ∀x(Sx ∧ (∃y)(Cy ∧ Gxy))
Wait, but the original is "All children go to some school." So it's not saying that all schools have children. So D seems to be saying for all x, x is a school and there exists a child y who goes to x. Which is the opposite of the original statement. So D is not correct.

Option E: ∀x(∃y)(Cx → Sy ∧ Gxy)
Wait, no. The structure is: for every x, if x is a child, then there exists a y such that x is a school (Sy) and Gxy holds. Again, that's the opposite of what we want. Because the original is about children going to schools, not schools being schools of children. So E doesn't seem right.

Option F: ∀x[(Cx ∧ Sy) → Gxy]
So for all x, if x is a child and x is a school, then x goes to y. But again, this seems to mix properties, which doesn't make sense because x can't be both a child and a school. So F is incorrect.

Option G: ∀x[Sx → (∃y)(Cy ∧ Gxy)]
This is saying for all x, if x is a school, then there exists a child y who goes to x. So this is about schools having children, which is not the same as children going to schools. So G is incorrect.

Option H: ∀x[Sx ∧ (∃y)(Cy ∧ Gxy)]
Same problem as D. It's saying for all x, x is a school and there's a child y going to x. Which is the inverse of the original statement. So H is incorrect.

Option I: ∃x∀y[(Cx ∧ Sy) ∧ Gxy]
Wait, this is saying there exists an x such that for all y, if x is a child, y is a school, and x goes to y. That seems way off. It's trying to say that some x (the first x) is a child, a school, and goes to all y. Which can't be right.

Option J: ∀x[Cx → ∃y(Sy ∧ Gxy)]
So for all x, if x is a child, then there exists a y where y is a school and x goes to y. This seems to fit the original statement. Because it's saying, every child is associated with at least one school that they go to. So J is the correct translation.

Wait, let me double-check. The original is "All children go to some school." So each child is assigned to at least one school. In predicate logic, that's ∀x (C_x → ∃y S_y ∧ G_x_y). So option J is ∀x(Cx → ∃y(Sy ∧ Gxy)), which is exactly what I wrote.

Yeah, that makes sense. So the correct answer is J.
</think>

The correct answer is J: ∀x[Cx → ∃y(Sy ∧ Gxy)].

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. The original statement is "All children go to some school."
2. This translates to every child (Cx) being associated with at least one school (Sy) that they go to (Gxy).
3. In predicate logic, this is expressed as ∀x (Cx → ∃y (Sy ∧ Gxy)).
4. Option J matches this statement exactly.

**Answer: J**
