Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the van der Waals equation. Hmm, I've heard a bit about gas laws before, but van der Waals is a bit trickier. Let me think... the question is asking about the pressure exerted by a certain amount of xenon gas when it behaves as a van der Waals gas. I remember that the van der Waals equation is an equation of state, which accounts for the volume of the gas particles themselves and the intermolecular forces between them. 

The problem gives me the mass of xenon, the volume of the vessel, and the temperature. So I'll need to use the van der Waals equation. Let me jot down what I know. Xenon is a noble gas, which I think has a molar mass. I think it's around 131 g/mol. Oh wait, the mass given is 131 grams, so that would be 1 mole of xenon. Oh, that's convenient because the moles (n) would be 1. So n = 131g / 131g/mol = 1 mol. That simplifies things.

The volume is 1.0 dm³. I know that 1 dm³ is equal to 1 liter, and 1 liter is 0.001 m³. But wait, in the van der Waals equation, volume is usually in terms of m³. Let me make sure. Oh yeah, the equation is (P + a(n²/V²))(V/n - b) = RT. So V is in m³. So 1 dm³ is 0.001 m³.

The temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. I need to convert that into Kelvin because gas laws use absolute temperature. So 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K. Let me just go with 298 K for simplicity.

Now, the van der Waals constants for xenon. I think the van der Waals constants a and b are specific to each gas. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact values, but I remember that a is a measure of the attraction between gas molecules, and b accounts for the volume of the gas particles themselves. For noble gases like xenon, I believe a is a positive value and b is a positive value as well.

Looking up the van der Waals constants for xenon, I think a is around 0.132 L²·atm/mol² and b is about 0.0502 L/mol. Wait, let me double-check that. Oh wait, I think I might have gotten the units wrong. Because L²·atm is a very large number, but a is in terms of units that make sense for the equation. Alternatively, maybe the units are different. Maybe a is in (atm·L²)/mol² and b in L/mol. Or perhaps I should convert the volume into liters when using the equation.

Wait, the van der Waals equation uses volume V in liters, and a and b are in appropriate units. Let me confirm the correct units. The van der Waals equation is:

(P + (a (n²)/V² )) * (V/n - b) = RT

So in this equation, a is in units where when you multiply by n² and divide by V², you get pressure. So a has units of (atm·L²)/mol². Because n is in moles, V is in liters. So for a, it's (L²·atm)/mol². Similarly, b is in L/mol.

So given that, let's plug in the values.

Given:
n = 1 mol
V = 0.001 m³ = 1 L (since 1 m³ = 1000 L, so 0.001 m³ is 1 L)
R is the gas constant, which is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

Wait, wait, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when using volume in liters. So that's correct.

So, the equation becomes:

P * (V/n - b) + (a (n²)/V² ) = RT

Which can be rearranged to solve for P:

P = (RT) - (a (n²)/(V² (V/n - b)) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to plug into the equation step by step.

Let me compute each term.

First, compute RT. Since R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, T is 298.15 K.

RT = 0.0821 * 298 ≈ 24.46 L·atm/mol. Since n=1, but RT is just 24.46 atm·L.

Wait wait, RT would be in L·atm because R is in that unit. So RT is 0.0821 * 298.15 ≈ 24.46 L·atm.

Next, compute a (n²)/(V² (V/n - b)).

Wait, the van der Waals equation is:

(P + [a (n²)/(V²)]) * (V/n - b) = RT

So expanding that, we get:

P*(V/n -b) + [a (n²)/(V²)] * (V/n - b) = RT

So,

P*(V/n -b) = RT - [a (n²)/(V²)] (V/n - b)

Thus,

P = [ RT - (a (n²)/(V²)) (V/n - b) ] / (V/n - b)

Alternatively, but perhaps it's easier to compute each term separately.

Let me compute the first term: P = RT - [ a (n²) / V² ] * (V/(n) - b )

Wait, perhaps I should compute the second part first.

Compute a (n²)/(V² (V/n - b)):

Wait, the second term is [ a (n²) / (V²) ] * (V/n - b )

Wait, let's compute [ (n²/V²) * (V/n - b) ]

That's [ (n²/V² ) * ( (V - b n)/n ) ) ] = [ (n² (V - b n )) / (V^2 n) ) ] = [ (n (V - b n )) / (V²) ) ]

So [ a (n²)/(V²) ) * ( V/n - b ) ] = a (n (V - b n )) / V²

So the entire equation for P is:

RT - [ a (n (V - b n )) / V² ]

So P = RT - [ a (n (V - b n) ) / V² ]

Let me compute each part.

Compute a (n (V - b n )) / V².

Given a=0.132 L²·atm/mol², n=1, V=1 L, b=0.0502 L/mol.

So the numerator is a * n * (V - b*n) = 0.132 * 1 * (1 - 0.0502 *1 ) = 0.132 * (0.9498) ≈ 0.132 * 0.9498 ≈ 0.125 L²·atm.

Denominator is V² = (1 L)^2 = 1 L².

So the term is 0.125 L²·atm / 1 L² = 0.125 atm.

So the entire expression for P is RT (which is about 24.46 L·atm) minus this 0.125 atm.

So P ≈ 24.46 - 0.125 = 24.335 atm.

Wait, but wait, the van der Waals equation is (P + a(n²/V²)) (V/n - b) = RT, so solving for P gives the above.

So P ≈ 24.335 atm. But looking at the options, the closest is 24 atm (option G). So the answer would be G. 28? No, 24.335 is closer to 24 than to 25. But wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the a term. Let me double-check the constants.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the van der Waals constants. For Xe (Xenon), the van der Waals constants are a = 0.1322 L²·atm/mol² and b = 0.05027 L/mol. Oh wait, I think I used the wrong value for a earlier. Let me correct that.

So a is 0.1322 L²·atm/mol².

So, recalculating the term:

a * n (V - b n) = 0.1322 * 1 * (1 - 0.05027) = 0.1322 * (0.94973) ≈ 0.12526 L²·atm.

Divided by V² (1 L²), so 0.12526 L²·atm / L² = 0.12526 atm.

So the second term is 0.12526 atm.

So P = RT - 0.12526 atm.

RT is 24.46 L·atm.

So P = 24.46 - 0.12526 ≈ 24.3347 atm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G (28 atm) and F (26 atm), but 24.33 is nearer to 24, which is not an option. Wait, the options are:

A: 22
B:20
C:15
D:30
E:34
F:26
G:28
H:24
I:18
J:12

Wait, no, option H is 24 atm. Oh, wait, I think I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, because wait, let me compute RT again.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

T is 298.15 K.

0.0821 * 298 = 24.4558 L·atm.

So RT is about 24.456 L·atm.

Then, the correction is 0.12526 atm (as calculated earlier) subtracted. So P would be 24.456 - 0.12526 ≈ 24.3307 atm.

So, about 24.33 atm.

Looking at the options, option H is 24 atm, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps the approximation is that the van der Waals correction is 0.13 L²·atm/(mol²) * (1 mol² / (1 L²)) ) * (1 - 0.05) → 0.13 * 0.95 → 0.1235. So 0.124 atm.

So 24.456 - 0.124 ≈ 24.332 atm.

So the pressure would be approximately 24.33 atm. The closest option is H:24 atm. But wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let me compute the exact numbers again.

a = 0.1322 L²·atm/mol².

n=1, V=1 L, so V² =1 L².

Term: a * n * (V - b n ) = 0.1322 * 1 * (1 - 0.05027 *1) → 0.1322 * 0.94973 = let me compute more accurately.

0.1322 * 0.94973:

Well, 0.1322 * 0.94973.

Compute 0.1322 * 0.9 = 0.11898.

0.1322 * 0.04 = 0.005288.

0.1322 * 0.00973 = let's compute 0.1322 *0.009 = 0.001190, and 0.1322 *0.00073= 0.0000963. Summing these: 0.001190 +0.0000963 = 0.0012863.

So adding all parts: 0.11898 + 0.005288 = 0.124268 + 0.0012863 = 0.1255543.

So the term is 0.1255543 atm.

So RT is 24.456 L·atm.

So P = 24.456 - 0.1255543 ≈ 24.33 atm.

So the answer is approximately 24.33 atm, which is closest to option H (24 atm). Alternatively, perhaps the van der Waals equation is giving a pressure slightly less than RT, but in this case, the correction is 0.125 atm. So 24.456-0.125=24.33.

Looking at the options, the closest is H (24 atm) or perhaps another option.

Wait, but the options are:

H is 24 atm, which is the closest. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but wait, I remember that some van der Waals equations express the correction as [a (n²/V²)(V/n -b) ] which we've calculated as 0.125 atm. So when subtracted, it's 24.33 atm.

So the pressure is about 24 atm.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think: another approach is to compute the second term correctly.

Wait, another way to compute the van der Waals term is:

(a (n²) / (V² (V/n -b)) )

Which is a * n^2 / [ V^2 (V/n -b) ].

n=1, so n²=1.

V=1 L, so V²=1.

V/n -b = 1 - 0.05027 = 0.94973 L.

So the denominator is 1 * 0.94973 = 0.94973.

a=0.1322.

So a * (n²) / (V² (V/n -b) ) = 0.1322 / 0.94973 ≈ 0.1322 / 0.94973 ≈ 0.1399 atm.

So the second term is 0.1399 atm.

So RT - [ 0.1399 atm ] = 24.456 - 0.1399 = 24.316 atm.

So approximately 24.32 atm.

Which is still about 24 atm.

So the correct answer is H:24 atm.

Wait, but the options are:

H:24 atm.

So the answer should be H.

To determine the pressure exerted by 131 g of xenon gas in a 1.0 dm³ vessel at 25°C using the van der Waals equation, we proceed as follows:

### Given Data:
- **Mass of xenon (n):** 131 g / 131 g/mol = 1 mol
- **Volume (V):** 1.0 dm³ = 1 L
- **Temperature (T):** 25°C = 298.15 K
- **Gas constant (R):** 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K
- **Van der Waals constants for xenon:**
  - \( a = 0.1322 \, \text{L}^2 \cdot \text{atm/mol}^2 \)
  - \( b = 0.05027 \, \text{L/mol} \)

### van der Waals Equation:
\[
\left(P + \frac{a n^2}{V^2}\right) \left(\frac{V}{n} - b\right) = RT
\]

Rearranging for \( P \):
\[
P = RT - \frac{a n^2}{V^2} \left(\frac{V}{n} - b\right)
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( RT \)
\[
RT = 0.0821 \cdot 298.15 = 24.456 \, \text{L·atm}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the correction term \( \frac{a n^2}{V^2} \left(\frac{V}{n} - b\right) \)
1. Compute \( \frac{V}{n} - b \):
   \[
   \frac{V}{n} - b = \frac{1}{1} - 0.05027 = 0.94973 \, \text{L}
   \]
2. Compute \( a \cdot n^2 \):
   \[
   a \cdot n^2 = 0.1322 \cdot 1^2 = 0.1322 \, \text{L}^2 \cdot \text{atm}
   \]
3. Compute \( \frac{a n^2}{V^2} \):
   \[
   \frac{a n^2}{V^2} = \frac{0.1322}{1^2} = 0.1322 \, \text{L}^2 \cdot \text{atm}
   \]
4. Multiply by \( \frac{V}{n} - b \):
   \[
   \frac{a n^2}{V^2} \left(\frac{V}{n} - b\right) = 0.1322 \cdot 0.94973 = 0.12555 \, \text{atm}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate \( P \)
\[
P = RT - \frac{a n^2}{V^2} \left(\frac{V}{n} - b\right)
\]
\[
P = 24.456 - 0.12555 = 24.33 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Final Answer:
The pressure exerted by the xenon gas is approximately 24.33 atm. Among the given options, the closest value is **24 atm (Option H)**.
