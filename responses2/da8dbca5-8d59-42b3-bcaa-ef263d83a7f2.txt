Question:

A city entered into a small-cost construction contract with a construction company whereby the latter obligated themselves to perform certain minor sewer repair work. Two months after completion of the work, the company sued the city for its failure to pay under the terms of the contract. At trial, the company's construction supervisor who personally oversaw all the repair work was called to testify. He sought to testify about the amount of sewer pipe used, the number of hours required to complete the job, and the number of workers employed by the company during the construction repair work. The defendant's attorney objected on the grounds that the company routinely recorded such factual information in their log books, which were in the company's possession. As a consequence, the supervisor's testimony should be ruled

Options:

A: inadmissible, because such testimony would be violative of the best evidence rule.
B: inadmissible, because no evidence was introduced to show that the original log records are not available for examination.
C: admissible, because it is relevant to the case.
D: admissible, because the supervisor is a credible witness.
E: admissible, because it is based on firsthand knowledge.
F: inadmissible, because it would be hearsay evidence.
G: inadmissible, because the information is not relevant to the case.
H: admissible, because the supervisor was directly involved in the construction work.
I: admissible, because it is a report of regularly conducted business activities.
J: inadmissible, because the supervisor was not under oath when the information was recorded.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this law question. Let me read the situation again carefully.

The scenario is that a city entered into a small-cost construction contract with a company. The company did some minor sewer repairs, and two months later, the company sued the city for failing to pay. The construction supervisor, who was in charge, testified about the amount of pipe used, the number of hours, and the number of workers. The city's defense attorney said that the company regularly recorded such facts in their log books and that the logs were in their possession. The question is whether the testimony is admissible.

Hmm, so I remember that for a test to be admissible, the testimony must meet several criteria. The key here is whether the testimony is hearsay or not. Hearsay is when someone else's testimony is used as evidence. If someone else's personal testimony is used, it's inadmissible unless there's a good reason to believe it's not hearsay.

In this case, the testimony is about the company's log books. The defense's lawyer says that the company regularly records such info, and the logs are in their possession. So, the idea is that the log books are a source of that information, so the testimony would be hearsay because it's being offered as another person's (the city's) statement.

But wait, there's another angle. There's the issue of whether the logs are relevant to the case. If the logs are from the construction work, which was a small project, maybe the city doesn't have a good case to use that specific log. But that's a separate issue from whether the testimony is hearsay.

Also, the supervisor's testimony would be hearsay because he's testifying about the company's internal records, which the city is using. Because the logs are in the company's possession, the city's attorney can't use them as evidence, so the testimony would be hearsay and thus inadmissible.

Wait, but could the logs be considered part of the contract? The contract is for small cost, so maybe the logs are part of the contract's terms. Or perhaps the logs are part of the company's business records, which are considered part of their contract obligations. If that's the case, the logs might be considered part of the contract, so the city's attorney can't use them as evidence, making the testimony inadmissible.

Alternatively, if the logs are part of the business records, and the city has no good evidence against the company, then it's a stretch, but the logs are still evidence of the company's conduct. So the testimony would still be hearsay.

But wait, the logs are in the company's possession. So the city's attorney can't use them as evidence of the company's business. Thus, the testimony is hearsay because it's from the company, not the city. The city's attorney can't introduce it because it's hearsay.

So looking at the options, option B says the testimony is inadmissible because no evidence was introduced to show the logs aren't available. But actually, the logs are in their possession, so they're available. The issue is whether the logs are hearsay. If the logs are evidence of the company's business (which they are, since they're part of the construction contract), then the testimony is hearsay.

But another thought: if the logs are part of the contract, perhaps the city's attorney can't use them because they're part of the contract. But the logs are the company's business, so they're in the company's possession. So the city can't use them as evidence. Therefore, the testimony is hearsay and inadmissible.

So looking back at the options:

Option B says the testimony is inadmissible because no evidence was introduced to show logs aren't available. Wait, but the logs are in the company's possession, so they are available. The problem is that the logs are from the company, so the testimony is hearsay. So option B is incorrect because it's not about the logs' relevance but the hearsay issue.

Option H says the testimony is admissible because the supervisor was directly involved. But that's not the issue; it's about hearsay.

Option F is inadmissible because it's hearsay. That makes sense because the testimony is about the company's internal records, not the city's. So F is a possible correct answer.

Wait, but another possibility is that the company's logs are part of their contract obligations. If so, the city's attorney can't use them because they're part of the contract, but I think the logs are still the company's business, so they are their own records. So the city can't use them as evidence. So the testimony is hearsay.

Therefore, F is correct. Because if the testimony is hearsay, it's inadmissible even if the logs are available. So the city's attorney can't use them, making the testimony inadmissible. That would make F the correct answer.

The testimony about the company's internal log books is hearsay because it is from the company's own business, and the city's attorney cannot use the logs as evidence of the company's conduct. The logs are in the company's possession, so they are available, but the issue is that they are not evidence against the city, making the testimony inadmissible. 

ANSWER: F
