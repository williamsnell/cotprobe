Okay, so I have this question about Mr. Howard's property tax. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the problem states that Mr. Howard owns a house worth $16,500, which is assessed at 22%. I think "assessed" means the value used to calculate property taxes, so I'll calculate that first. The assessed value is 22% of $16,500. Let me compute that.

22% is the same as 0.22 in decimal. So, 0.22 multiplied by 16,500. Let me do the math: 16,500 * 0.22. Hmm, 16,500 times 0.2 is 3,300, and 16,500 times 0.02 is 330. Adding those gives 3,630. So the assessed value is $3,630.

Now, each part of the tax is based on different rates per $100. The rates are: 
- Local college fund: $0.41 per $100
- Special education: $0.02 per $100
- Health and welfare: $0.001 per $100
- Community construction: $0.089 per $100

I need to calculate the tax for each category and then sum them all up.

Let's break it down by each category.

1. **Local College Fund:**
   The assessed value is $3,630. Since the rate is per $100, I'll divide 3,630 by 100 to get 36.3. Then, multiply by the rate per $100, which is $0.41.
   So, 36.3 * 0.41. Let me compute that. 36 * 0.41 is 14.76, and 0.3 * 0.41 is 0.123. Adding them together gives 14.76 + 0.123 = 14.883. So approximately $14.88.

2. **Special Education:**
   Again, $3,630 assessed. Rate is $0.02 per $100. Divide 3,630 by 100 to get 36.3. Multiply by 0.02: 36.3 * 0.02 = 0.726. So about $0.73.

3. **Health and Welfare:**
   $3,630 / 100 = 36.3. Multiply by 0.001: 36.3 * 0.001 = 0.0363. So $0.04 when rounded to the nearest cent.

4. **Community Construction:**
   $3,630 / 100 = 36.3. Multiply by 0.089: 36.3 * 0.089. Let me compute that. 36 * 0.089 is 3.204, and 0.3 * 0.089 is 0.0267. Adding, 3.204 + 0.0267 = 3.2307. So approximately $3.23.

Now, add all the individual taxes together to get the total.

So let's sum them:
- Local: ~$14.88
- Special: ~$0.73
- Health: ~$0.04
- Community: ~$3.23

Adding them up: 14.88 + 0.73 = 15.61. Then 15.61 + 0.04 = 15.65. 15.65 + 3.23 is 18.88.

Wait, let me double-check the community construction calculation. Maybe I did that right. 36.3 * 0.089. Hmm, 36 * 0.089 is 3.204, and 0.3 * 0.089 is 0.0267, so 3.2307, which rounds to $3.23. So that's correct.

So adding each part:
14.88 (Local) + 0.73 (Special) = 15.61
15.61 + 0.04 (Health) = 15.65
15.65 + 3.23 (Community) = 18.88.

Looking at the options, option C is $18.88. So the answer should be C.

The total tax Mr. Howard pays is calculated by applying the respective rates to the assessed value of his property. The assessed value is 22% of $16,500, which equals $3,630. Dividing this by 100 gives 36.3, which is then multiplied by the respective rates for each category. Summing these amounts results in a total tax of $18.88.

Answer: C: $18.88
