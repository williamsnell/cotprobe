Okay, so I've got this question about the rates of alcohol abuse among different American groups. Let me try to break it down. The question is asking which group has the lowest rate of alcohol abuse, and the options are various races and ethnicities.

I remember from school that different racial and ethnic groups have varying rates of certain issues, including alcoholism. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think about each option.

Option A is Pacific Islander-American. Pacific Islanders are part of the Pacific region, which I think is generally considered a more homogeneous group compared to others. Maybe they have a lower prevalence of alcoholism because they share some cultural and environmental factors that might reduce the risk. I'm not entirely sure though.

Option B is Middle Eastern-American. I've heard that people from the Middle East are more prone to substance use because they might have different lifestyles, like higher socialization or more exposure to alcohol. So maybe they have a higher rate of abuse.

Option C is European-American. I think European Americans, especially those from European countries, tend to have lower rates of alcoholism compared to others. They might have less exposure to alcohol culture and social influence.

Option D is Hispanic-American. I remember that Hispanic groups are at risk because of their history of alcoholism in the past, and they might engage in more frequent alcohol use. Or maybe it's the other way around; some groups are more prone. I'm a bit confused here.

Option E is Mixed Race-American. This group probably includes several different races, so it might have a higher risk than individual groups but maybe not as high as a homogeneous group. But I'm not certain.

Option F is African-American. African-Americans are a population with a high prevalence of substance abuse, so this is likely the highest rate, not the lowest.

Option G is White. I know white people are more likely to have substance abuse than other groups. They might have lower rates compared to other races but higher than others.

Option H is Jewish-American. I'm not too sure about this. I think Jews are generally more likely but not as high as others. I'm not certain, but I don't think it's the lowest.

Option I is Native-American. Native Americans are a diverse group, and some might have lower rates because they're not part of a homogeneous population or have less exposure to alcohol-related factors.

Option J is Asian-American. I've heard that Asian Americans, especially from East Asian backgrounds, might have higher rates of substance abuse because of their different social and cultural influences. But I'm not entirely certain.

So putting this together, Europe, Pacific Islander, and Native-American groups have lower rates of alcoholism. But wait, the question is about the group with the lowest. I think European is the most homogeneous, followed by Pacific and then Native. But among the options given, C is European-American, which is a group with lower rates than the others.

Wait, but let me think again. I've heard that Native American rates are lower than European, but Pacific Islanders might have higher. So which is the lowest overall? Maybe European is the lowest among all the options given.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer should be C: European-American. Because European groups typically have lower rates of substance abuse due to their shared cultural and environmental factors, which might reduce exposure to alcohol.

The group with the lowest rate of alcohol abuse among the options provided is **C: European-American**. This is because European-American individuals are often associated with lower rates of alcoholism due to shared cultural and environmental factors that may reduce exposure to alcohol. 

Answer: C
