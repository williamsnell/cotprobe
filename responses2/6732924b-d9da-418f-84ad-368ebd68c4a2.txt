Okay, so I've got this question about strong organizational culture and which of the options is true. Let me think through this. The question is asking about the correlation between a strong organizational culture and job performance and commitment. The options are A, B, C, and D.

Hmm, I remember that organizational culture refers to the values, beliefs, and practices of an organization. It's something that can influence how people behave and interact within the organization. Strong cultural practices might affect how employees feel and perform.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Strong culture correlates with low job performance. I'm not sure about this. I think that sometimes strong cultures can lead to higher performance, but maybe not always. It might depend on how the culture is implemented. I'm not certain if it's a positive correlation or not.

Option B: Strong culture correlates with low job commitment. I don't recall this being a widely accepted statement. High commitment is often seen as a positive factor in performance. So if a strong culture leads to lower commitment, that doesn't seem right.

Option C: Strong culture correlates with high job performance. This sounds more plausible. I remember reading that strong organizational cultures can enhance job satisfaction and performance. Employees might feel more valued and motivated, leading to better productivity and higher performance.

Option D: No effect on performance or commitment. This seems unlikely. Organizational cultures are a big factor in determining employee behavior and performance. Without a strong culture, employees might not perform as well or be as committed.

Putting it all together, I think the correct answer is C. A strong organizational culture is positively correlated with high job performance because it can lead to better satisfaction and motivation, which in turn improve productivity. It doesn't necessarily mean lower commitment, and there's no indication it has no effect, so D is probably not correct.

The correct answer is C: It is correlated with high levels of job performance. Strong organizational cultures can enhance satisfaction and motivation, leading to better productivity.
