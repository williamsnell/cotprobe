Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about breastfeeding and what research suggests is the major result. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

The question asks what research suggests is the major result of breastfeeding an infant. The options are A through J. I'll need to go through each option and see which one makes the most sense based on what I know about breastfeeding.

Option A: Stronger infant immunity solely based on the duration of breastfeeding. I remember that breastfeeding seems to help with immunity, but is it just because of how long it's been? I think it's more about the duration than the duration alone. Also, I'm not sure if the duration is the main result or if other factors like the mother's role play a bigger role.

Option B: specific method used in feeding. That doesn't sound right. breastfeeding isn't a specific method; it's a general practice. So B might be incorrect.

Option C: attitude the parents have towards the child during feeding time. Wait, I'm not sure about this. I think the major results are more about the baby's health and development, not the parent's attitude. So C might not be the right answer.

Option D: Predictable sleep patterns established immediately through breastfeeding. I'm not sure about this. I thought that breastfeeding can help with sleep, but does it immediately establish predictable patterns? I might need to reconsider.

Option E: Enhanced cognitive development exclusively due to nutrient composition. This sounds a bit too positive. I'm not sure if it's exclusive or if other factors like the mother's role and the baby's health are more important. Plus, the nutrient composition being the sole factor seems a bit strong.

Option F: Oral stimulation and eating. That sounds more like the practice of breastfeeding itself, not a result. So F seems like it's about the method, not the outcome.

Option G: Long-term taste preferences determined by breast milk flavor variety. I've heard that taste preferences are influenced by the mother's diet, but is the long-term preference solely based on the flavor? I'm not certain, but I think it's more about the mother's choices and the baby's response to the mother's diet.

Option H: Development of a more diverse palate by the age of one. This seems plausible. As an infant, their palate develops, and breastfeeding probably helps with that. I remember something about the child's palate developing, and breastfeeding might contribute to that.

Option I: Intimate contact with the mother. This might be part of breastfeeding, but I think the main result is about the baby's health, not direct contact.

Option J: Increased physical growth rate compared to formula-fed infants. I'm not sure about this. I thought that formula might be better for growth, but I'm not certain that breastfeeding leads to a higher growth rate. Maybe the opposite? Or perhaps it's more about other factors like the mother's role and the baby's health.

Let me think again. The primary result of breastfeeding, if I recall correctly, is that it improves the baby's immune system, allows for better sleep, and supports social skills. But among the options, the major result is about the baby's development. 

Wait, I think I read that breastfeeding leads to a more diverse palate, so option H. Also, the baby's immunity improves. But looking at the options, H is listed as one of the choices. So J is about growth rate, which I'm less sure about. 

Another angle: there's also the idea that as an infant, the baby's palate develops, and breastfeeding might help with that. So option H is about the development of a more diverse palate. That sounds correct.

I'm also recalling that breastfeeding is linked to better social skills, which is a result, but I don't see that as an option here. The options given don't include that, so the closest is option H.

Another point: the major results are about the baby's health and development. So the biggest outcome is probably the improved immunity, but that's not one of the options. Oh wait, the options don't include that, so perhaps the next best thing is the developmental aspects.

So, putting it together, I think the correct answer is H: Development of a more diverse palate by the age of one.

The major result of breastfeeding an infant, based on research, is the development of a more diverse palate by the age of one. This is because breastfeeding helps the baby's brain and body adapt to the mother's diet, leading to a richer and more varied palate. 

Answer: H
