Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. The question is asking for the pH of a solution where the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+], is 6.38 × 10^-6 mole per liter. Hmm, I remember that pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution, and it's calculated using the formula pH = -log[H+]. Oh wait, but wait, I should make sure I'm doing this right.

So, the formula is straightforward, right? Take the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration. But wait, what's the exact formula? Oh yeah, pH is the negative logarithm base 10 of the hydrogen ion concentration. So pH equals negative log10([H+]). 

Let's plug in the value given. [H+] is 6.38e-6 M. So I need to compute the log of that number. Let me think. Logarithm of 1e-6 is -6, because 10^-6 is 0.000001. But 6.38 is a bit more than 1, so the log will be a number just a bit higher than -6. 

Wait, let's compute this step by step. First, I can break this down. Log(6.38e-6) = log(6.38) + log(1e-6). Log(1e-6) is -6. And log(6.38) is approximately? Let me calculate that. Hmm, I remember that log(6) is about 0.778, and log(6.38) should be a bit higher. Maybe around 0.806? Or wait, perhaps I should remember that log(6)=0.778, log(6.38) is higher. Let's think: 6.38 is 6 +0.38. So the change from 6 to 6.38. The derivative of log(x) is 1/(x ln10), but maybe it's easier to approximate. Alternatively, I can use a calculator approach but since I'm just thinking, let me think of known points.

Alternatively, I know that log(6)=0.7782, log(7)=0.8451, so 6.38 is between 6 and 7, maybe around 0.806. So 0.806 + (-6) = -5.194. So the log of 6.38e-6 is approximately -5.194. So the pH is the negative of that, which would be 5.194.

Looking at the options, option B is 5.195, which is about what I got. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other factors I should consider, like if the solution is aqueous and if there's ionization affecting it? Oh, wait, the question gives [H+] as 6.38e-6, which is pretty standard. I think in pure water, [H+] is 1e-7, pH 7. So a solution with [H+] higher than 1e-7 would have pH less than 7, which makes sense. Since 6.38e-6 is about 6.38 times larger than 1e-7 (because 1e-7 is 0.1e-6; 6.38 is about 63.8 times larger), so log(6.38) is about 0.806, so the pH is 7 - 0.806 = 6.194? Wait no, wait. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me correct that.

Wait, wait, I think I got that wrong. Let me re-calculate. If [H+] is 6.38e-6 M, then pH is -log(6.38e-6). Let me compute it as log(6.38) + log(1e-6). Log(1e-6) is -6. Log(6.38) is approximately 0.806. So adding them: 0.806 -6 = -5.194. So pH is - (-5.194) = 5.194. So option B is 5.195, which is very close. So B is the answer.

Hmm, but wait, another approach. Let me compute it using a calculator. But since I can't use a calculator, I have to estimate. Alternatively, I can think in terms of logarithms. Like, 1e-6 is pH 6. 6.38 is 6.38/6 = approx 1.063. So 1.063 times 1e-6. The log of 1.063 is about 0.027. Because log(1.063) ≈ 0.027. So log(6.38e-6) is log(6.38) + log(1e-6) → which is about 0.806 + (-6) = -5.194. So pH is 5.194, which rounds to 5.195 as in option B. So the correct answer should be B.

To determine the pH of a solution where [H⁺] = 6.38 × 10⁻⁶ mol/L, we use the formula:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log_{10}[\text{H}^+]
\]

### Step 1: Break down the calculation
1. The hydrogen ion concentration is given as \( 6.38 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{mol/L} \).
2. Separate the calculation into two parts:
   - \( \log_{10}(6.38) \)
   - \( \log_{10}(10^{-6}) \)

### Step 2: Compute each part
1. \( \log_{10}(10^{-6}) = -6 \), since \( 10^{-6} = 10 \times 10^{-7} \).
2. \( \log_{10}(6.38) \): Using approximations, \( \log_{10}(6) \approx 0.778 \), and since \( 6.38 \) is slightly larger than \( 6 \), \( \log_{10}(6.38) \) is approximately \( 0.806 \).

### Step 3: Combine the results
\[
\log_{10}(6.38 \times 10^{-6}) = \log_{10}(6.38) + \log_{10}(10^{-6}) = 0.806 - 6 = -5.194
\]

### Step 4: Calculate pH
\[
\text{pH} = -(-5.194) = 5.194
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated pH of \( 5.194 \) rounds to \( 5.195 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
