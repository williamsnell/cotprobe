Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an infinite line of charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think. The question says that the electric field at a distance of 2.0 meters is 4.5 × 10^4 N/C. I need to find the linear charge density. Oh wait, right, the formula for the electric field due to an infinite line charge is something like E = λ/(2πε₀ r), where λ is the charge per unit length, ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, and r is the distance from the charge.

Right, so the formula I remember is E = λ / (2πε₀ r). Or wait, sometimes it's written as E = λ/(2πε₀ r), or maybe there's a different version. Oh wait, no, wait: E is proportional to λ and inversely proportional to r. So if I have E, I can solve for λ. 

Let me write down the formula again to make sure I get it right. E = λ/(2πε₀ r). Oh wait, I'm pretty sure that's correct. Because the units: E is N/C, λ is C/m, ε₀ is C²/(N m²), r is meters. Let's plug in the units to see if it works. So E would be (C/m) / (N m²/(C²)) * (1/m). So units: (C/m) * (C²/(N m²)) * (1/m) = (C³)/(N m^4). Wait, but N is kg m/s². Hmm, I'm not sure about the units here. Maybe I should just proceed with the formula.

So given E = 4.5e4 N/C, r = 2.0 m. I need to solve for λ. So rearranging the formula: λ = E * 2πε₀ r.

Wait, no. Let me re-arrange. E = λ/(2πε₀ r) → λ = E * 2πε₀ r. Wait, no, wait: E = λ / (2πε₀ r) → λ = E * 2πε₀ r. Alternatively, sometimes I've seen it written as λ = 2πε₀ E r. Which is the same thing. Let me confirm.

Yes, because E = λ/(2πε₀ r) → λ = 2πε₀ E r. Right, that's correct.

So I need to plug in the numbers. ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, which is approximately 8.85 ×10^-12 C²/(N·m²).

Let me compute λ step by step.

E = 4.5e4 N/C. r=2.0 m.

So λ = 2 * π * ε₀ * E * r.

Wait, no, wait: 2πε₀ * E * r.

Wait, let's compute it. So 2 * π * 8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²) * 4.5e4 N/C * 2 m.

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, 2 * π is approximately 6.2832.

8.85e-12 multiplied by E (4.5e4) is 8.85e-12 *4.5e4 = ?

Wait, 8.85e-12 * 4.5e4 = (8.85 *4.5) * 1e-8.

8.85 *4.5: let me compute that. 8 *4.5=36, 0.85 *4.5=3.825 → 39.825. So 39.825e-8 → 3.9825e-7.

Hmm, perhaps better to do exact calculation.

Wait, 8.85e-12 * 4.5e4 = 8.85 *4.5 * 1e-12+4 → 8.85 *4.5 is 40. (Wait, 8 *4.5 is 36, 0.85 *4.5 is 3.825 → 36 +3.825=39.825 → 39.825e-8 → 3.9825e-7.

Now, this is multiplied by 2π, which is about 6.2832. Wait, no, it's 2π multiplied into the entire product. Wait, actually, in the formula, it's 2 * π * ε₀ * E * r.

So 2 * π is about 6.2832. Multiply that by 3.9825e-7.

Wait, but wait, no. Let's correct. The calculation is 2 * π * [ 8.85e-12 * 4.5e4 ] * 2.0.

Wait, let me recalculate:

Compute 8.85e-12 *4.5e4 first.

8.85e-12 *4.5e4 = 8.85 *4.5 * 1e-12+4 → 40.425e-8 → 4.0425e-7.

Then, multiply by 2pi: 2 * pi is approximately 6.2832.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is λ = 2 * π * ε₀ * E * r.

So 2 * π is 6.2832. So 6.2832 * (4.0425e-7) * 2.0.

Wait, another approach: 2 * π * ε₀ * E * r = 2 * π * (8.85e-12) * (4.5e4) * 2.

Wait, wait, let me compute each part step by step.

Compute 2 * π first: 2 * 3.1416 ≈ 6.2832.

Compute ε₀ * E: 8.85e-12 *4.5e4. Let me compute that: 8.85e-12 *4.5e4 = (8.85 *4.5) * 1e-12+4 = 40.425 *1e-8 = 4.0425e-7.

Then, multiply that by r (2.0 m): 4.0425e-7 * 2 = 8.085e-7.

Now, multiply by 2π (6.2832): 6.2832 *8.085e-7.

Let me compute 6.2832 * 8.085e-7.

8 *6.2832 is about 50.2656, 0.085 *6.2832≈0.53 (since 0.08 *6.2832=0.5026, 0.005 *6.2832≈0.0314; sum is about 0.534). So total is approximately 50.2656 + 0.534 ≈ 50.7996, but wait that can't be right because 8.085e-7 is 8e-7, so 6.2832 * 8e-7 is about 5e-6.

Wait, perhaps better to calculate 6.2832 * 8.085e-7.

Compute 8.085e-7 *6.2832 = 8.085 *6.2832 × 1e-7.

8 *6 is 48, 8 *0.2832 is about 2.2656, 0.085 *6=0.51, 0.085 *0.2832≈0.024072. So sum all for 8 *6.2832=50.2656, 0.085 *6.2832≈0.5342, so total 50.2656 + 0.5342 = 50.80 (approx). So 8.085e-7 *6.2832 ≈50.80e-7, which is 5.08e-6.

Wait, but this can't be right because 4.5e4 is 45,000, which is a pretty high electric field. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me reevaluate.

Electric field due to an infinite line charge is E = λ/(2π ε₀ r). So λ = E * 2 π ε₀ r.

Wait, so λ = 4.5e4 N/C * 2 pi * 8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²) * 2.0 m.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute 2 * π * 8.85e-12.

2 * pi ≈6.2832.

6.2832 * 8.85e-12 = let's compute that.

6 * 8.85e-12 = 53.1e-12, 0.2832 *8.85e-12 = approx 2.50e-12. So total is about 55.6e-12 =5.56e-11.

Wait, but wait, 6.2832 *8.85e-12 = ?

Alternatively, 8.85e-12 *6.2832 → let me compute 8 *6.2832=50.2656, 0.85 *6.2832≈5.335. So total is 50.2656 +5.335≈55.6006e-12 →5.56006e-11.

So now, 55.6e-12 * 2.0 m → 111.2e-12 C/(N m²) * m → C/(N m) ?

Wait, but I think I'm getting tangled here. Let me try calculating λ.

λ = E * 2 * π * ε₀ * r.

Given E=4.5e4 N/C, r=2.0 m.

So E=4.5e4.

So 2 pi ε₀ r = 2 * pi *8.85e-12 *2.0 → let me compute that.

2 * pi ≈6.2832.

8.85e-12 *2 = 1.77e-11.

Multiply by 6.2832: 1.77e-11 *6.2832 ≈1.123e-10.

So 2 pi epsilon_0 r ≈1.123e-10.

Now, lambda is E multiplied by this: 4.5e4 * 1.123e-10.

4.5e4 is 45000.

45000 * 1.123e-10 → 45000 *1.123 =50535 → 50535e-10 →5.0535e-6 C/m.

Wait, so lambda is approximately 5.05e-6 C/m.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 2 pi *8.85e-12 = 6.2832 *8.85e-12.

6.2832 *8.85 → let me compute 6 *8.85=53.1, 0.2832 *8.85=approx 2.503. Total is 55.603e-12.

Then, 55.603e-12 * 2.0 (r) → 111.206e-12.

So 2 pi epsilon_0 r =111.206e-12.

Now, lambda = E * (2 pi epsilon_0 r) → E is 4.5e4.

4.5e4 *111.206e-12 → Let's compute 4.5e4 *1.11206e-10.

4.5e4 is 45,000.

45,000 * 1.11206e-10 = 45,000 *1.11206 → 49,982.7 → 49,982.7e-10 → 4.99827e-6 C/m.

Approximately 5.0e-6 C/m. So λ is about 5.0e-6 C/m.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 4.5 μC/m →4.5e-6 C/m.

Option G:5.0 μC/m →5e-6 C/m.

So our result is approximately 5.0e-6, which matches option G.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.

Alternative approach: Compute each step numerically.

Compute 2 * pi → approx 6.2832.

Compute 8.85e-12 *4.5e4 → 8.85 *4.5 =40.425 → 40.425e-8 → 4.0425e-7.

Multiply by 2: 8.085e-7.

Multiply by 2.0: 16.17e-7 → 1.617e-6.

Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the formula is E * 2 pi epsilon_0 r.

Wait, 2 pi ε₀ r is 2 * pi * 8.85e-12 *2.0.

Wait, 8.85e-12 *2.0=1.77e-11.

Multiply by 2 pi: 1.77e-11 *6.2832=1.77 *6.2832 ≈11.123 → 11.123e-11 →1.1123e-10.

Then, lambda is 4.5e4 * 1.1123e-10 → 4.5e4 is 45,000.

45,000 * 1.1123e-10 → 45,000 *1.1123 = 49,998.75 → 49,998.75e-10 →4.999875e-6 C/m.

Which is approximately 5.0e-6 C/m. So 5.0 μC/m.

Looking at the options, option G is 5.0 μC/m. So the correct answer should be G.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the electric field produced by an infinite line of charge:

\[
E = \frac{\lambda}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 r}
\]

Rearranging for the linear charge density \(\lambda\):

\[
\lambda = E \cdot 2 \pi \epsilon_0 r
\]

### Given Data:
- Electric field: \(E = 4.5 \times 10^4 \, \mathrm{N/C}\)
- Distance: \(r = 2.0 \, \mathrm{m}\)
- Vacuum permittivity: \(\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{C^2/(N \cdot m^2)}\)

### Step 1: Compute \(2 \pi \epsilon_0 r\)
\[
2 \pi \epsilon_0 r = 2 \cdot \pi \cdot (8.85 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot 2.0
\]
First, calculate \(2 \cdot \pi \approx 6.2832\). Then:
\[
6.2832 \cdot 8.85 \times 10^{-12} = 5.5606 \times 10^{-11}
\]
Multiply by \(2.0\):
\[
5.5606 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 2.0 = 1.1121 \times 10^{-10}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(\lambda\)
\[
\lambda = E \cdot (2 \pi \epsilon_0 r) = (4.5 \times 10^4) \cdot (1.1121 \times 10^{-10})
\]
Multiply the values:
\[
4.5 \times 10^4 \cdot 1.1121 \times 10^{-10} = 5.005 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C/m}
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
The computed value of \(\lambda\) is approximately \(5.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C/m}\), which corresponds to \(5.0 \, \mu\mathrm{C/m}\). This matches option **G**.
