Okay, so I've got this logic problem here that I'm trying to solve. It's about determining whether a set of propositions is consistent using an indirect truth table. If it's consistent, I need to pick the right option from A to H. Hmm, I remember that consistency in logic means that all the propositions can be true at the same time without any contradictions. So, I need to see if there's a way to assign truth values to each proposition such that all the statements are satisfied.

The propositions given are:

1. (E ⊃ F) ⊃ G
2. (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I)
3. I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H)
4. ~G ⊃ ~J

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me check. Oh wait, the second proposition is written as (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I). Right. So four propositions, four letters involved: E, F, G, H, I, J. Wait, no, looking again, I think the actual letters involved are E, F, G, H, I, J because each has a different letter. So, six letters. So the options mention things like E, F, G, H, I, J, so that makes sense.

The problem is asking to use indirect truth tables to determine consistency. Indirect truth tables usually involve assuming the set is inconsistent, meaning that assuming all the propositions are true would lead to a contradiction. If that assumption leads to a contradiction, then the set is inconsistent. But if it doesn't, then it's consistent.

So, I think the approach is to set up a truth table for all possible combinations of truth values for E, F, G, H, I, J and see if any combination satisfies all four propositions. If no combination does, then it's inconsistent. If at least one combination does, it's consistent.

But wait, with six variables, that's 2^6 = 64 possible combinations. That's a lot to handle manually. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Alternatively, I can try to find a truth assignment that satisfies all four propositions by analyzing each proposition step by step.

Let me break down each proposition to see if I can find any relationships or dependencies between the propositions.

Proposition 1: (E ⊃ F) ⊃ G

This can be rewritten using implications. Remember that A ⊃ B is equivalent to ~A ∨ B. So, let's rewrite it:

(E ⊃ F) is equivalent to ~E ∨ F. So, (E ⊃ F) ⊃ G becomes (~E ∨ F) ⊃ G, which is equivalent to ~ (~E ∨ F) ∨ G. Which simplifies to (E ∧ ~F) ∨ G.

So, proposition 1 is equivalent to (E ∧ ~F) ∨ G.

Proposition 2: (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I)

This is an equivalence, so it's the same as (H ∨ I) ⇨ (~E ∨ F) and (~E ∨ F) ⇨ (H ∨ I).

So, (H ∨ I) implies (E→F) and (E→F) implies (H ∨ I). Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.

Proposition 3: I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H)

Similarly, I can rewrite I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H) as (I ∧ (J → ~H)) → ~H. Wait, no. Wait, J ⊃ ~H is equivalent to ~J ∨ ~H. So, I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H) is equivalent to (I ∧ (∼J ∨ ∼H)) → ~H. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me try expanding it.

I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H) → (I → (J → ~H)).

Using implication equivalence: ~I ∨ (J → ~H) → which is equivalent to ~I ∨ (~J ∨ ~H).

Wait, maybe I should step back. Let's think about the structure.

The third proposition is I implies (J implies ~H). So, if I is true, then J implies ~H must be true. So, if I is true, then J implies ~H. So, if J is true, then ~H must be true, making H false. If J is false, then J implies ~H is automatically true regardless of H.

Proposition 4: ~G ⊃ ~J

Which is equivalent to G ∨ ~J. So, if G is true, then ~J is true, meaning J is false. If G is false, then ~J can be either true or false; no problem.

So, let's see. Let's try to find a combination of truth values that satisfies all four propositions.

Let me start by assuming 'True' for all propositions and see if it's possible.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to assign values step by step.

Let me consider each proposition and see which ones impose constraints.

Starting with proposition 4: ~G → ~J. So, if G is true, then J must be false. If G is false, J can be anything.

Proposition 1: (E ∧ ~F) ∨ G. So, for this to be true, either E ∧ ~F is true, or G is true.

So, if G is true, that condition is satisfied, regardless of E and F.

If G is false, then (E ∧ ~F) must be true. So, E must be true and F must be false.

Now, let me see how these constraints interact.

Wait, let's make a table approach. Since it's 6 variables, but maybe I can find some patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a scenario where all conditions are met.

Let me try to find a consistent assignment.

Let me make G true. Because propositions 1 and 4 might be satisfied with G true.

If G is true, let's see what happens.

From proposition 1: (E ∧ ~F) ∨ G → since G is true, this is satisfied. So E and F can be anything, it's not a constraint.

From proposition 4: ~G → ~J. But G is true, so ~G is false. So the implication is true regardless of J. So J can be anything.

Now, let's look at proposition 2: (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I).

So, (H ∨ I) must be equivalent to (~E ∨ F).

Which means both (H ∨ I) → (~E ∨ F) and (~E ∨ F) → (H ∨ I).

So, in other words, (H ∨ I) must equal (~E ∨ F).

Which could mean that (H ∨ I) is true when (~E ∨ F) is true, and false otherwise.

Wait, but this can be a bit tricky. Let's think in terms of possible scenarios.

Let me think about the possible truth values for E and F, and then see what H and I must be.

Wait, given that G is true, and E and F can be anything.

Wait, perhaps another approach: let's assume G is true. Then, from proposition 4, J can be anything.

So, let's consider G = T.

Then, from proposition 1: (E ∧ ~F) ∨ T → always true. So E and F can be any values.

Now, looking at proposition 2: (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I).

So, (H ∨ I) must be equivalent to (~E ∨ F).

Which means that whenever (~E ∨ F) is true, (H ∨ I) is true, and vice versa.

So, if (~E ∨ F) is true, then (H ∨ I) must also be true.

Alternatively, if (~E ∨ F) is false, then (H ∨ I) must also be false.

But (~E ∨ F) can be rewritten as F ∨ ~E. So, when is that false? Only when both E is true and F is false.

So, if E is T and F is F, then (~E ∨ F) is F. Therefore, in that case, (H ∨ I) must also be F. Meaning both H and I are F.

Wait, but that might be a possible case. Let me explore.

Case 1: E is T and F is F.

In this case, from (~E ∨ F) being F (since E=T and F=F), so (H ∨ I) must be F. So, H=F and I=F.

Now, let's see what else we have.

From proposition 3: I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H). Since I is F, the implication is automatically true. So, no constraints from there.

Now, let's see what we have so far:

G=T, E=T, F=F, H=F, I=F.

Now, check proposition 2: (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I).

Left side: (~E ∨ F) → since E=T, F=F → ~E is F. So F ∨ F is F.

Right side: H ∨ I → F ∨ F is F. So both sides are F, so the equivalence holds.

Now, checking other propositions.

Proposition 1: (E ∧ ~F) ∨ G → (T ∧ T) ∨ T → T ∨ T → T.

Yes.

Proposition 2: equivalent, as discussed.

Proposition 3: I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H) → I is F, so the implication is automatically true.

Proposition 4: ~G → ~J. G=T → ~G=F. So implication is F → ~J. Since implication with F is always true, regardless of J.

So, all four propositions are satisfied with this assignment.

So, the consistent valuation is:

E=T, F=F, G=T, H=F, I=F, J can be anything (since proposition 2's equivalence holds regardless of J).

So, what is the answer? Looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: E, F, G are true and H, I, J are false. That's E=T, F=T, which we don't have. So no.

Option B: E is true and others are false. But F is F, H is F, I is F, J can be anything. So this matches what we found.

Wait, option B says E is true and F, G, H, I, J are false. Let me check.

Our assignment is E=T, F=F, G=T, H=F, I=F, J can be anything. So, J is F in our case? Because in our assignment, J is not fixed. Let me check the options again.

Option B: E is true, others are false. So in our case, F=F, G=T, H=F, I=F, J can be any. So J is F in our assignment, but J is not necessarily false. So the assignment is E=T, F=F, G=T, H=F, I=F, J=F. So all those are F except J (which can be anything, but in our case, it's F).

So, the assignment is E=T, F=F, G=T, H=F, I=F, J=F.

Looking at the options, option B says E is true, F, G, H, I are false, and J is false. That matches.

So the correct answer is option B.

The correct assignment is E=T, F=F, G=T, H=F, I=F, J=F. This satisfies all four propositions, making the set of propositions consistent.

Answer: B
