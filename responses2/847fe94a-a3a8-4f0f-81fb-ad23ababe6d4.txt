Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about whether a criminal act committed by the Minister of Country X abroad is jure imperii or jure gestionis. Hmm, I remember that jure imperii refers to public acts, and jure gestionis is for private acts. But wait, when the act is done internationally, does that affect whether it's public or private?

I think the key here is whether the act is considered a public or private matter. If the Minister is committing an act abroad, like murder, it's probably a public act because it's about the country's sovereignty and possibly national security. So if the act is public, then it would fall under jure imperii.

But wait, maybe I should consider whether the act is specific to a particular jurisdiction. If the Minister is acting in their capacity as a public official, then it's definitely a public act. So jure imperii would apply.

Looking at the options, option D says it's a public act (jure imperii), and option A says it's shielded by immunity. I'm not sure about the immunity part. Do international acts have immunity? I think some countries have the right to protect their citizens, but if it's a crime against a specific nationality, maybe it's considered private. But if the Minister is acting as a national official, it's more about the state's sovereignty, making it public.

So putting it together, the act is a public one because it's related to the country's sovereignty, so it's jure imperii. Also, maybe there's an immunity consideration, but the primary classification is based on whether it's public or private. I'm a bit confused about the immunity part, but the main point is the classification. So the answer should be D.
