Okay, so I've got this series to evaluate: S equals 1/2 plus 1/4 plus 1/8 plus 1/16 and so on. Hmm, I remember this is a geometric series. Let me think. The general form of a geometric series is a + ar + ar² + ar³ + ..., where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio. 

Looking at the series, the first term 'a' is 1/2. The next term is 1/4, which is (1/2) multiplied by 1/2 again, so r must be 1/2. That makes sense because each term is half of the previous one. 

Now, I recall that the sum of an infinite geometric series is S = a / (1 - r), but this formula only works if the absolute value of r is less than 1. In this case, r is 1/2, which is definitely less than 1. So I can apply the formula. 

Plugging in the values, S = (1/2) / (1 - 1/2). Let's compute the denominator first: 1 - 1/2 is 1/2. So now it's (1/2) divided by (1/2), which equals 1. Wait, that can't be right because when I add up the first few terms, like 1/2 + 1/4 = 0.75, plus 1/8 is 0.875, and so on. It seems like the sum should approach 1. But wait, another way: 1/2 is 0.5, 1/4 is 0.25, so adding them gives 0.75, then 0.125 brings it to 0.875, then 0.0625 is 0.9375, and so on, getting closer to 1. So the sum is indeed 1. 

Looking at the options, option I is 1. So the correct answer should be I: 1.

The series is a geometric series with first term \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{2} \). The sum of an infinite geometric series is \( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \). Plugging in the values:

\( S = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = 1 \).

Thus, the sum is **1**.

Answer: I: 1
