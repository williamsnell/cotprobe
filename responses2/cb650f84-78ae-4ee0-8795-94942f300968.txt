Okay, so I have this question about when the norm ||x||_p can be expressed as an inner product. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

I remember that a norm can be derived from an inner product if and only if it's a Hilbert space norm. Oh wait, right, that's the Riesz representation theorem. So, the norm comes from an inner product if the norm is induced by that inner product. 

The norm in question is the p-norm, which is defined as the maximum of the absolute values of the coordinates multiplied by their respective p-th roots. So, for the p-norm, the condition for it to be induced by an inner product is that p must be greater than or equal to 1. Wait, but I also remember that in some cases, like when p is 2, which is a Hilbert space, it's true. Also, for p=1, it's a Banach space with the maximum norm, but I think that's not induced by an inner product. Oh wait, right, when p=1 or p=infinity, the norms are actually not induced by inner products. 

Wait, the question is asking for which p the p-norm is expressible as an inner product. So, I think the correct answer is that p must be at least 1. But wait, wait. Let me think again. 

The p-norm is induced by an inner product only when p is between 1 and infinity, inclusive. So, for p=1: the norm is indeed the maximum of the absolute values. But does this come from an inner product? Or is it that for p=1, the space is not a Hilbert space? Because I thought the space of l^1 is a Banach space but not a Hilbert space. Or wait, maybe when p=1, the dual space is l^infty, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me recap. For the p-norm to be induced by an inner product, the space must be a Hilbert space. So, for which p is the space l^p a Hilbert space? I remember that l^p is a Hilbert space when p=2. For p>2, I think it's not a Hilbert space because the parallelogram law fails. So, the inner product exists for p=2. 

Wait, but another thing: the dual space of l^p is l^q where 1/p + 1/q =1. So, for p=1, the dual is l^infty, which is correct. For p=2, the dual is l^2. But wait, the question is about the norm being expressible as an inner product. So, the condition is that the norm is induced by an inner product, which requires that the space is a Hilbert space. So, l^p is a Hilbert space only for p=2. 

Wait, but the question is in the options. The options include G: p >=1 and H:1. Wait, no, let me check the options again. Oh, looking at the options, option G is p >=1, which includes p=1 and p=2 and p=infty. But wait, no, I thought that l^1 is a Banach space but not a Hilbert space. So, the p-norm is induced by an inner product only when p=2. So the correct answer would be H:1.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the question says "the norm is expressible as an inner product." So, perhaps I should think about whether for p=1, the norm is the maximum of the coordinates' absolute values. Does that come from an inner product? Because for p=1, the norm is ||x||_1 = sum |x_i|. 

Wait, but I think that the only time the p-norm is an inner product norm is when p=1, 2, or infinity. Or is it that it's induced by an inner product only when p=2? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, I think I need to go back. The p-norm ||x||_p is a norm. For it to be an inner product norm, it must satisfy the parallelogram law. So, the parallelogram law says that ||x + y||^2 + ||x - y||^2 = 2(||x||^2 + ||y||^2). For the p-norm, when does this hold? 

I think the parallelogram law holds for p=1, p=2, and p=infty. Wait, no, that's not right because for p=1, the parallelogram law does not hold. Let me double-check. When p=2, the parallelogram law holds, which means it's a Hilbert space. For p=1, let's see: let x = (1,0), y=(0,1). Then ||x||_1 = 1, ||y||_1=1, ||x+y||_1=2. So the left side of the parallelogram law is (2)^2 + (2)^2 =8. The right side is 2*(1 + 1) =4. So 8â‰ 4, so it doesn't hold. So p=1 doesn't satisfy the parallelogram law. 

Wait, but earlier I thought that the dual of l^1 is l^infty, and that's correct. So, perhaps the conclusion is that the p-norm is an inner product norm only when p=2.

So, looking back at the options: option H is p=1, G is p>=1. So, option H would be p=1, but I just saw that p=1 doesn't satisfy the parallelogram law, so the p-norm is not induced by an inner product. So the correct answer would be option H:1, but that's not correct because p=1 doesn't work. So, perhaps the correct answer is p=2, which is option H.

Wait, but looking again, option G says p >=1. That would include p=1, which we know doesn't work, so that can't be the answer. Option H is 1. But I think the correct answer is p=2, which is option H. So, the correct answer is H.

The question asks for which value of \( p \) the \( \|\cdot\|_p \) norm can be expressed as an inner product. 

To determine this, we recall that a norm can be induced by an inner product if and only if it satisfies the parallelogram law. For the \( \|\cdot\|_p \) norm, this law holds for \( p = 2 \), making \( \|\cdot\|_2 \) an inner product norm. However, for \( p = 1 \), the parallelogram law does not hold, so \( \|\cdot\|_1 \) is not an inner product norm. 

Looking at the options, \( p = 1 \) (option H) does not satisfy the parallelogram law, while \( p = 2 \) (option H) does. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: H
