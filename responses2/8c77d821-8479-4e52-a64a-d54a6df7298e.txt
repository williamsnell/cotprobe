Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies three conditions. Let me see: when divided by 4, it leaves a remainder of 1. When divided by 3, it leaves a remainder of 2. And when divided by 7, it leaves a remainder of 5. Hmm, okay.

Wait, let's break it down step by step. Maybe starting with the first condition. If the number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, that means the number can be written as 4k + 1, where k is some integer. So possible numbers are 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, 81, 85, 89, 93, 97, 101, etc.

Next, the number leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. So when I divide by 3, the remainder is 2. Numbers that fit this are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 56, 59, 62, 65, 68, 71, 74, 77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92, 95, 98, 101, etc.

Now, I need to find a number that appears in both lists. Looking at the first list, the numbers are 1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,41,45,49,53,57,61,65,69,73,77,81,85,89,93,97,101,... and the second list is 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35,38,41,44,47,50,53,56,59,62,65,68,71,74,77,80,83,86,89,92,95,98,101...

Looking for common numbers: 5 is in both? Let's see: 5 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 1, correct. 5 divided by 3 is 1 with remainder 2, yes. And 5 divided by 7 is 0 with remainder 5. So 5 is a candidate. But wait, 5 is the smallest positive integer that satisfies all three conditions? Because 5 is the first number I can think of that meets all three, right?

Wait, but 5 is also present in both lists. So why is 17 one of the options? Let me check the options again. The options are A:17, B:22, C:31, D:26, E:13, F:15, G:20, H:10, I:35, J:11.

Wait, 5 isn't among the options. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake. Because the problem is asking for the smallest positive integer. Wait, could there be a smaller number than 5 that satisfies all conditions? Let me check.

Wait, the first condition is mod 4 remainder 1. So numbers are 1,5,9,... 5 is the first. 5 divided by 3 is 1 with a remainder of 2, correct. 5 divided by 7 gives 5, which is a remainder of 5. So 5 satisfies all. But the options don't include 5. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should approach it using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or the method of successive substitutions.

Let me try another approach. Let's consider the problem:

Find x such that:
x ≡ 1 mod 4
x ≡ 2 mod 3
x ≡ 5 mod 7

I can solve this system step by step.

First, solve x ≡1 mod4 and x ≡2 mod3.

Let me find numbers that satisfy both.

Looking for x =4k +1. Substitute into x ≡2 mod3:

4k +1 ≡2 mod3 → 4k ≡1 mod3. Since 4 mod3 is 1, so 1*k ≡1 mod3 →k≡1 mod3.

So k=3m+1. Therefore, x=4*(3m+1)+1=12m +5.

So x≡5 mod12. So x is 5,17,29,41,53,65,77,89,... and so on. Now, we have to find x in this sequence that also satisfies x≡5 mod7.

So x=12m +5. Let's find m such that 12m +5 ≡5 mod7.

12m +5 ≡5 mod7 →12m ≡0 mod7. 12 mod7 is 5, so 5m ≡0 mod7. So 5m is a multiple of 7 → m must be a multiple of 7, because 5 and7 are coprime. So m=7n, where n is integer.

So x=12*(7n) +5=84n +5. The smallest positive x is when n=0: x=5. But wait, 5 is not in the options.

Wait, but the options don't include 5, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe I should try a different modulus approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider another approach. Let me list numbers that satisfy each condition and see if any of the options fit.

Looking at the options:

A:17

Check which conditions it meets.

17 mod4: 17/4 is 4*4=16, remainder 1 → correct.

17 mod3: 3*5=15, remainder 2 → correct.

17 mod7: 7*2=14, 17-14=3 → remainder 3, which is not 5. So 17 doesn't satisfy the third condition.

B:22

22 mod4: 4*5=20, 22-20=2 → remainder 2, which doesn't match the first condition (needs remainder 1). So B is out.

C:31

31 mod4: 4*7=28, 31-28=3 → remainder 3, which doesn't fit the first condition. So C is out.

D:26

26 mod4: 6*4=24, 26-24=2 → remainder 2, doesn't fit first condition.

E:13

13 mod4: 3 → doesn't fit first condition.

F:15

15 mod4: 15-12=3 → no.

G:20

20 mod4: 20/4=5 → no. Because 20 mod4 is 0, not 1.

H:10

10 mod4: 2 → no.

I:35

35 mod4: 35-32=3 → no.

J:11

11 mod4: 3 → no.

Wait, none of the options satisfy all three conditions. But wait, the problem is to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies all three. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the smallest x that satisfies all three conditions. Earlier, I found that x=5 satisfies all, but it's not in the options. So perhaps the correct answer is 5, but that's not an option here. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should check all the options again.

Wait, let me try each option:

Option A: 17.

Check:

17 mod4: 17/4=4*4=16, remainder 1 → correct.

17 mod3: 17/3=5*3=15, rem 2 → correct.

17 mod7: 17-14=3 → remainder 3 → doesn't match. So 17 doesn't satisfy third condition. So A is not the correct answer.

Option B:22.

22 mod4: 22-20=2 → rem 2 → incorrect. So B is out.

Option C:31.

31 mod4: 31-28=3 → incorrect.

Option D:26.

26 mod4: 26-24=2 → incorrect.

Option E:13.

13 mod4=1 → yes.

13 mod3: 13-12=1 → incorrect. So E is out.

Option F:15.

15 mod4=15-12=3 → incorrect.

Option G:20.

20 mod4=0 → incorrect.

Option H:10.

10 mod4=2 → incorrect.

Option I:35.

35 mod4=35-32=3 → incorrect.

Option J:11.

11 mod4=3 → incorrect.

Wait, none of the options satisfy all three conditions. So perhaps the problem is to find the smallest positive integer, which is 5, but it's not an option. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try solving the congruences again.

We have:

x ≡1 mod4 → x=4k+1.

Substitute into x≡2 mod3:

4k+1 ≡2 mod3 → 4k≡1 mod3 → since 4≡1 mod3, this becomes k≡1 mod3. So k=3m+1.

Thus, x=4*(3m+1)+1=12m+5.

So the solutions are x=5,17,29,41, etc.

Now, we need x≡5 mod7.

So x=12m +5 ≡5 mod7 → 12m ≡0 mod7.

12 mod7 =5, so 5m ≡0 mod7. Since 5 and7 are coprime, m must be 0 mod7. So m=7n.

Thus, x=12*(7n)+5=84n +5. So the smallest positive x is 5, which is the first solution. But in the options, there is no 5. So perhaps the problem is to find the next solution, which is 89, but that's not in the options either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me check another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 5, but since it's not in the options, maybe I made a mistake in the problem understanding.

Wait, the problem says "the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, and a remainder of 5 when divided by 7." So the correct answer is 5, but it's not an option here. So perhaps the options are wrong, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should try each option again.

Wait, let me check option I: 35.

35 mod4: 35/4=8*4=32, rem3 → no.

Option J:11.

11 mod4=3 → no.

Option G:20.

20 mod4=0 → no.

Option F:15.

15 mod4=3 → no.

Option E:13.

13 mod4=1 → yes.

13 mod3:13-12=1 → no.

Option D:26.

26 mod4=2 → no.

Option C:31.

31 mod4=3 → no.

Option B:22.

22 mod4=2 → no.

Option A:17.

17 mod4=1 → yes.

17 mod3=2 → yes.

17 mod7=3 → no.

So indeed, only 5 satisfies all three conditions, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the options are incorrect, or I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the next smallest that satisfies all three conditions beyond 5, but that's not indicated in the question.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the problem has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations. Let me try one more time.

Looking back, the options don't include 5, so perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I should consider another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let me try that.

We have:

x ≡1 mod4 → x=4k+1.

Substitute into x≡2 mod3:

4k+1 ≡2 mod3 →4k≡1 mod3 →k≡1 mod3 (since 4≡1 mod3).

So k=3m+1.

Thus, x=4*(3m+1)+1=12m+5.

Now, x must also satisfy x≡5 mod7.

So 12m +5 ≡5 mod7 →12m≡0 mod7 →5m≡0 mod7.

Which implies m≡0 mod7 → m=7n.

Thus, x=12*(7n)+5=84n+5.

The smallest x is when n=0, which is 5.

But since 5 isn't an option, perhaps the problem expects the next solution, which is 89. But 89 isn't an option either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again, maybe I misread them. Let me recheck:

Options:

A:17

B:22

C:31

D:26

E:13

F:15

G:20

H:10

I:35

J:11

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach: find x that satisfies x ≡1 mod4, x≡2 mod3, and x≡5 mod7. Let's list numbers that satisfy each condition and see if any of the options fit.

First, numbers where x ≡1 mod4: 1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,41,45,49,53,57,61,65,69,73,77,81,85,89,93,97,101, etc.

From these, which also satisfy x≡2 mod3?

Looking for numbers where x mod3 is 2. Let's see:

5: 5/3=1 rem 2 → yes.

17: 17/3=5 rem 2 → yes.

29: 29/3=9 rem 2 → yes.

41: 41/3=13 rem 2 → yes.

53:53/3=17 rem 2 → yes.

65:65/3=21 rem 2 → yes.

77:77/3=25 rem 2 → yes.

89:89/3=29 rem 2 → yes.

101:101/3=33 rem 2 → yes.

So the numbers that satisfy both mod4=1 and mod3=2 are 5, 17, 29, 41, etc.

Now, from these, which ones satisfy x≡5 mod7?

Check each:

5:5 mod7=5 → yes.

17:17 mod7=3 → no.

29:29-28=1 → no.

41:41-35=6 → no.

53:53-49=4 → no.

65:65-63=2 → no.

77:77 mod7=0 → no.

89:89-84=5 → yes.

101:101-98=3 → no.

So the first number that satisfies all three is 5. But again, it's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect, but the problem is to find the smallest positive integer, which is 5, but that's not an option. So maybe the intended answer is 5, but since it's not an option, perhaps the closest is 17. But wait, 5 is not an option. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I should try another approach. Let's see: the numbers that satisfy x≡1 mod4 are 1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,41,45,49,53,57,61,65,69,73,77,81,85,89,93,97,101,...

Now, check which of these numbers also satisfy x≡2 mod3. That gives 5,17,29,41,53,65,77,89,101,...

Now, for each of these, check if x≡5 mod7. 5: yes. So 5 is the answer. But again, it's not in the options. So perhaps the correct answer is 5, but in the options, it's not present. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should try to solve the system of congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem properly.

We have:

x ≡1 mod4 → x =4a +1.

Substitute into x≡2 mod3:

4a +1 ≡2 mod3 →4a ≡1 mod3 → since 4 ≡1 mod3, a ≡1 mod3 → a=3b +1.

So x=4*(3b+1)+1=12b +5.

Now, substitute into x≡5 mod7:

12b +5 ≡5 mod7 →12b ≡0 mod7 → since 12 ≡5 mod7, 5b ≡0 mod7 → since 5 and7 are coprime, b ≡0 mod7 → b=7c.

So x=12*(7c)+5=84c+5.

The smallest x is when c=0: x=5.

So 5 is the smallest positive integer. But in the options, 5 isn't present. So perhaps the problem intended to have a different set of options, but as it stands, the correct answer isn't among them. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the next number, which would be 89, but that's not in the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should check all the options again to see if any of them satisfy all three conditions:

Looking at each option:

A:17 →17 mod4=1, 17 mod3=2, 17 mod7=3. Doesn't satisfy mod7=5.

B:22 →22 mod4=2, doesn't satisfy first condition.

C:31 →31 mod4=3, no.

D:26 →26 mod4=2, no.

E:13 →13 mod4=1, mod3=1, no.

F:15 →15 mod4=3, no.

G:20 →20 mod4=0, no.

H:10 →10 mod4=2, no.

I:35 →35 mod4=3, no.

J:11 →11 mod4=3, no.

So none of the options satisfy all three conditions. Thus, the correct answer is 5, but it's not in the options. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misprinted, and the options are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach, such as looking for the least common multiple of the moduli, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the method of successive substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should start by considering x ≡1 mod4 and x≡2 mod3. The solution is x=12b +5. Now, set 12b +5 ≡5 mod7 →12b≡0 mod7 →5b≡0 mod7 →since 5 and7 are coprime, b≡0 mod7 →b=7c → x=84c +5. So the first solution is 5, which is the smallest positive integer.

So the correct answer is 5, but since it's not among the options, perhaps the problem is intended to have 5 as the answer, but the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach, but I can't see where.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another approach, such as listing numbers that satisfy each condition and see if any of them are in the options.

Wait, numbers that satisfy x≡1 mod4 are 1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,41,45,49,53,57,61,65,69,73,77,81,85,89,93,97,101, etc.

Now, which of these are ≡2 mod3? Let's see:

5 mod3=2 → yes.

17 mod3=2 → yes.

29 mod3=2 → yes.

41 mod3=2 → yes.

53 mod3=2 → yes.

65 mod3=2 → yes.

77 mod3=2 → yes.

89 mod3=2 → yes.

101 mod3=2 → yes.

Now, from these, which are ≡5 mod7?

Checking each:

5 mod7=5 → yes.

17 mod7=3 → no.

29 mod7=1 → no.

41 mod7=6 → no.

53 mod7=53-49=4 → no.

65 mod7=65-63=2 → no.

77 mod7=0 → no.

89 mod7=89-84=5 → yes.

101 mod7=101-98=3 → no.

So the numbers that satisfy all three are 5,89, etc.

5 is the smallest, but it's not an option. So perhaps the problem is misprinted, and the options are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach, but I can't see where.

Wait, perhaps I should try to check all the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in the conditions.

Wait, perhaps I should check option H:10.

10 mod4=2 → yes.

10 mod3=1 → no.

So H is out.

Option I:35.

35 mod4=3 → no.

Option J:11.

11 mod4=3 → no.

Option F:15.

15 mod4=3 → no.

Option E:13.

13 mod4=1 → yes.

13 mod3=1 → no.

Option D:26.

26 mod4=2 → no.

Option C:31.

31 mod4=3 → no.

Option B:22.

22 mod4=2 → no.

Option A:17.

17 mod4=1 → yes.

17 mod3=2 → yes.

17 mod7=3 → no.

So indeed, none of the options satisfy all three conditions. Thus, the correct answer is 5, but it's not in the options. Therefore, the problem may have an error, or the options may be incorrect.
</think>

The smallest positive integer that satisfies all three conditions is 5. However, since 5 is not listed among the options (A through J), the correct answer is not present in the provided choices.
