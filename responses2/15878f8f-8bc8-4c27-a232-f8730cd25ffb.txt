Alright, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me think through it step by step. I remember that when a disk rolls down an incline without slipping, some of its energy is rotational and the rest is translational. The question is asking what fraction of the total kinetic energy is rotational.

Okay, so I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas, but I think the key here is to find the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to the total kinetic energy. I remember that for rolling without slipping, the translational speed v and the angular velocity ω are related. Oh right, because the disk rolls without slipping, v = ω * R, where R is the radius. That's important.

The total kinetic energy of the disk should be the sum of its rotational and translational parts. So KE_total = KE_rotational + KE_translational.

For a solid disk, the moment of inertia I is (1/2) M R². The rotational kinetic energy is (1/2) I ω². Substituting I, that becomes (1/2)(1/2 M R²) ω². So that's (1/4) M R² ω².

The translational kinetic energy is (1/2) M v². But since v = ω R, substituting that in gives (1/2 M) (ω R)², which is (1/2) M ω² R².

So now, KE_rot = (1/4) M R² ω² and KE_trans = (1/2) M ω² R². Adding them together: (1/4 + 1/2) M R² ω². Let's compute that. 1/4 plus 1/2 is 3/4. So KE_total is (3/4) M R² ω².

Wait, wait, let me double-check that math. Oh wait, no, because KE_rot is 1/4 M R² ω², and KE_trans is 1/2 M R² ω². So adding them gives (1/4 + 1/2) = 3/4. So KE_total is 3/4 M R² ω².

So the rotational part is (1/4) M R² ω², and the total is 3/4. So the fraction is (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3.

Wait, no, wait again. Because the rotational energy is 1/4, and total is 3/4. So 1/4 divided by 3/4 is 1/3. So that's one third. So the rotational KE is 1/3 of the total.

Looking at the options, option E is 1/3. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the kinetic energy expressions.

Alternatively, I've heard that for rolling without slipping, the fraction of kinetic energy is rotational as (I think) 1/3. Because if I have KE_rot = (1/2) I ω², and I = (1/2)MR², then substituting gives (1/2)(1/2 M R²)(ω²) = (1/4) M R² ω². The translational KE is (1/2 M v²). And since v = ω R, that's (1/2 M)(ω² R²) = (1/2) M R² ω². So adding them gives (1/4 + 1/2) M R² ω² = 3/4 M R² ω². So KE_rot is (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3. So yeah, that's correct.

So the fraction is 1/3, which is option E.

To determine the fraction of the disk’s total kinetic energy that is rotational, we analyze the kinetic energies of a rolling solid disk. The total kinetic energy of the disk is the sum of its rotational and translational components:

1. **Rotational Kinetic Energy**:  
   For a solid disk, the moment of inertia is \( I = \frac{1}{2}MR^2 \). The rotational kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   KE_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}MR^2\right)\omega^2 = \frac{1}{4}MR^2\omega^2
   \]

2. **Translational Kinetic Energy**:  
   The translational kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   KE_{\text{trans}} = \frac{1}{2}Mv^2
   \]
   Since the disk rolls without slipping, the translational speed \( v \) is related to the angular velocity \( \omega \) by \( v = \omega R \). Substituting this gives:  
   \[
   KE_{\text{trans}} = \frac{1}{2}M(\omega R)^2 = \frac{1}{2}MR^2\omega^2
   \]

3. **Total Kinetic Energy**:  
   Adding the rotational and translational kinetic energies:  
   \[
   KE_{\text{total}} = KE_{\text{rot}} + KE_{\text{trans}} = \frac{1}{4}MR^2\omega^2 + \frac{1}{2}MR^2\omega^2 = \frac{3}{4}MR^2\omega^2
   \]

4. **Fraction of Rotational Kinetic Energy**:  
   The fraction of the total kinetic energy that is rotational is:  
   \[
   \text{Fraction} = \frac{KE_{\text{rot}}}{KE_{\text{total}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}MR^2\omega^2}{\frac{3}{4}MR^2\omega^2} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the rotational kinetic energy is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total kinetic energy. The correct answer is **E: 1/3**.
