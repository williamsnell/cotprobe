Okay, so I have this question about the origin of the 'spirit of capitalism' as traced back to someone or event. I'm a bit rusty on history, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that the spirit of capitalism refers to the underlying moral and philosophical ideas that drive capitalism. It's more than just the economic structure; it's about the values and reasons that justify capitalist actions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Movement towards religious pluralism. Hmm, pluralism in religion might be a part of the movement, but I'm not sure how it relates to the spirit of capitalism. The spirit is more about values, not just religious diversity.

Option B: Inspirational Protestant groups. That sounds more like a movement or movement style, not necessarily the underlying ideas. I'm not certain about the link to capitalism's spirit.

Option C: The fall of feudalism and rise of industrialism. Oh, that rings a bell. I think this is the period when industrialization became dominant and led to changes in social structures. The spirit of capitalism was definitely influenced by industrialization, as it changed the way society operates.

Option D: Paper currency in the Middle Ages. That's more about monetary systems and maybe the role of the church (as the currency was gold). Not directly related to the philosophical ideas behind capitalism.

Option E: Secularism in modern society. That's more of a modern trend, not a historical term. The spirit of capitalism is a term that's been around longer, I think.

Option F: Spread of secularism. Again, that's modern and not the historical origin.

Option G: Calvinists and their practices. Calvinism was a specific religious movement, not a movement towards capitalism. They were more about religion and salvation, not the moral values that drove capitalism.

Option H: Renaissance expansion of trade. That's more about economic expansion, which was part of the economic shift but not the philosophical driving force behind capitalism.

Option I: Scientific method in Enlightenment. While the scientific method influenced later ideologies, the spirit of capitalism was a philosophical concept, not directly tied to scientific methods.

Option J: Birth of democracy in ancient Greece. That's a different period, maybe the Hellenistic era. The spirit of capitalism was a 19th-century thought, so I don't think this is the right answer.

So, C seems to be the best fit. The fall of feudalism and rise of industrialism definitely influenced the development of the spirit of capitalism.

The correct answer is C: the fall of feudalism and the rise of industrialism. This period marked a shift in society, particularly the decline of feudal structures and the dominance of industrialization, which underpinned the moral and philosophical underpinnings of capitalism. 

Answer: C
