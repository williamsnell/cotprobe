Question:

Proteins were shown to move about in a plane of the plasma membrane when mouse cellsurface proteins and human cell-surface proteins were observed to integrate along a fused mouse-human cell plasma membrane. Which of the following cell culture techniques was most likely employed in order to yield these results?

Options:

A: Inserting a bacterial plasmid into a mammalian cell
B: Producing a hybrid cell
C: Injecting a fluorescent marker into the cell membrane
D: Producing a heterokaryon
E: Isolating an immortal variant cell from culture and using it to create a cell line
F: Inserting a tumor-inducing virus into a normal cell to initiate transformation
G: Using a method called cell fusion to combine the mouse and human cells
H: Using a technique called transfection to insert new genes
I: Using a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer
J: Inducing pluripotency in somatic cells to create stem cells

Okay, so I've got this question about cell culture techniques and how they're used to observe proteins on a membrane. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that proteins moved about in a plane of the plasma membrane when observed in a cell that's a fusion of mouse and human cells. The options are various cell culture techniques. I remember some of these techniques from my biology classes.

Option A: Inserting a bacterial plasmid into a mammalian cell. Wait, bacterial plasmids are usually inserted into bacteria, not mammalian cells. So probably not this one. Also, I think that's more about gene transfer in bacteria, not cell fusion.

Option B: Producing a hybrid cell. Hybridization usually refers to combining different cell types, like a mammal and a human. But I'm not sure if that's a cell culture method. Maybe it's more about plant hybridization, but I'm not certain. I think hybridization is a process, not a specific culture method I know.

Option C: Injecting a fluorescent marker into the cell membrane. Oh, right! Fluorescent markers are used to track where proteins move. Like, when they're injected, they fluoresce and you can see where they go. So proteins moving in a plane would fluoresce when they're attached to the membrane. That makes sense. So this is about tagging proteins for visualization.

Option D: Producing a heterokaryon. A heterokaryon is a homologous chromosome pair found in some organisms, like plants. It's more about genetics than cell culture techniques. Not relevant here.

Option E: Isolating an immortal variant cell and making a cell line. Imprinting is about making cells that can't differentiate, but that's more about stem cells. immortal cells are used in somatic cell nuclear transfer, but I'm not sure if that's a common technique here.

Option F: Using a tumor-inducing virus to initiate transformation. Wait, transformation is about cell lysis to get DNA fragments. Not about cell fusion or membrane movement.

Option G: Cell fusion to combine mouse and human cells. That's a technique where two cell types are fused together, so they stay together. I think this is what happens in this question, because the proteins are on the membrane. So the result would be a cell that's a fusion of both mouse and human, meaning their membrane proteins are on the membrane. So this method (G) would produce the scenario described.

Option H: Transfection for inserting new genes. Transfection is about introducing genes into cells, but that's more about genetic engineering in the cell, not tracking proteins on the membrane.

Option I: Somatic cell nuclear transfer. That's making somatic cells (like stem cells) from a somatic cell stem cell. I don't think that's relevant here because the question is about membrane proteins moving, not about stem cells.

Option J: Inducing pluripotency in somatic cells. Pluripotency is about making stem cells that can differentiate into any cell type. Not directly about cell membrane proteins.

So the correct method must be either C or G. The question says the proteins move along a membrane when they're on the surface. So the technique is about tracking them. Fluorescent markers are used for that. So the answer is C.

The question involves observing proteins on a membrane through cell culture techniques. The correct method must allow visualization of protein movement. Fluorescent markers (Option C) are used to track proteins attached to the membrane, making them visible. Cell fusion (Option G) combines mouse and human cells, resulting in membrane proteins, which is also relevant. However, the question emphasizes the technique used to observe the movement, which is more about tagging than cell fusion. Thus, the most appropriate answer is:

ANSWER: C
