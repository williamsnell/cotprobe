Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to add two polynomials in Z_8[x]. The polynomials are f(x) = 4x -5 and g(x) = 2x² -4x +2. I'm a bit rusty on polynomial arithmetic, especially in modular arithmetic, but let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that in Z_8, the coefficients of the polynomials are considered modulo 8. That means any coefficient that's 8 or more needs to be reduced by subtracting 8 until it's within the range of 0 to 7.

So, let's write down the polynomials again:

f(x) = 4x -5  
g(x) = 2x² -4x + 2

I need to add these two together, f(x) + g(x). Let's add the like terms together.

Starting with the highest degree terms. 

The x² term in f(x) is 0x², and in g(x) it's 2x². So adding those gives 2x².

Next, the x term. f(x) has 4x, and g(x) has -4x. Adding 4x and (-4x) gives 0x. So the x terms cancel each other out.

Then, the constant term. f(x) is -5, and g(x) is +2. So adding -5 +2 gives -3. But since we're working modulo 8, we need to add 8 to -3 if necessary. So, -3 +8=5. So the constant term is 5.

Putting it all together, f(x) + g(x) = 2x² + 0x +5. So that simplifies to 2x² +5.

Wait, let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Adding f(x) and g(x):

2x² (from g)
(x) terms: 4x (f) + (-4x) (g) = 0x
constants: -5 (f) +2 (g) = -3 → which is 5 mod 8.

Yes, that's correct. So the sum is 2x² +5.

Looking at the options, option C is 2x² +5. So the answer should be C.

To find the sum of the polynomials \( f(x) = 4x - 5 \) and \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_8[x] \), we add the corresponding coefficients modulo 8.

1. **Add the \( x^2 \) terms**: \( 0x^2 + 2x^2 = 2x^2 \).
2. **Add the \( x \) terms**: \( 4x + (-4x) = 0x \).
3. **Add the constant terms**: \( -5 + 2 = -3 \). In \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \), \( -3 \) is equivalent to \( 5 \).

Putting it all together, the sum is \( 2x^2 + 5 \), which corresponds to option C.

**Answer: C**
