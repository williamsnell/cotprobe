Question:

A 70-year-old woman comes to the office because of worsening tremor of her hands. The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed. During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent. She is now embarrassed to eat with other people because of how obvious the tremor has become. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to help her to cope with the death of her husband 2 months ago. Medical history is also remarkable for essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin. Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily because, she says, it reduces her tremor. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (155 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse 80/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest. Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and serum thyroid function tests are ordered and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor?

Options:

A: Early Parkinson disease
B: Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy
C: Adverse effect of atorvastatin therapy
D: Adverse effect of ibuprofen therapy
E: Increase in alcohol consumption
F: Hyperthyroidism
G: Bereavement reaction
H: Adverse effect of lisinopril therapy
I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress
J: Onset of multiple sclerosis

Okay, so I'm faced with this medical question. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about a 70-year-old woman with a worsening tremor. The tremor started as mild and was only noticeable when she was tired or stressed. Over the past month, it's more noticeable and frequent. She's embarrassed to eat because it's obvious. She's been taking fluoxetine for three weeks to cope with her husband's death. Her medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia ( controlled with lisinopril and atorvastatin) and occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two drinks a month but now drinks a glass daily because it helps with her tremor. She's 168 cm and 70 kg, BMI 25.

The physical exam shows moderate tremor both hands, not at rest. Complete blood count, serum chemistry, and thyroid function tests are ordered but results are pending. The options are various causes.

First, I need to consider the possible causes of tremor. tremors can be due to various conditions. The patient's medical history suggests she's dealing with stress-related conditions because she's taking fluoxetine (for grief), atorvastatin (high blood pressure), and possibly other medications that might affect her body's response to stress.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Early Parkinson disease. That's a condition where tremors are common, causing problems. But the patient's other medications are for stress, blood pressure, and maybe inflammation. Also, her symptoms are more pronounced now, but if it's early Parkinson, maybe the tremor started with her husband's death, and she's just starting to notice it.

Option B: Adverse effect of fluoxetine. Fluoxetine is an SSRI and is used for mild to moderate post-surgical pain, anxiety, and depression. It's also used for chronic pain. Her symptoms are more pronounced now, so perhaps her response to fluoxetine is adverse. But her medical history already includes it as a treatment, so maybe this is not the main issue.

Option C: Adverse effect of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin lowers blood pressure. If it's an adverse effect, it might make her blood pressure worse. However, her blood pressure is 130/85, which isn't that high, but she's taking it as part of her treatment, so maybe this isn't the main issue.

Option D: Adverse effect of ibuprofen. It's used for pain relief, but if it's an adverse effect, it might make her more susceptible to pain. Her current symptoms are tremors, not pain. So maybe not this.

Option E: Increase in alcohol consumption. She used to drink less. Now she drinks more because alcohol lowers her tremor. That's a common reason for increased tremors, especially when alcohol is a known cause. Her medical history has an alcohol problem, so this could be a possibility.

Option F: Hyperthyroidism. That's high levels of thyroid hormones, which can cause tremors. But her complete blood count and serum chemistry tests are pending, so maybe this isn't the cause yet.

Option G: Bereavement reaction. This is a sudden emotional or physical reaction to loss, like a husband's death. It can cause tremors and other symptoms. But her other medications are for health reasons, so perhaps this is less likely.

Option H: Adverse effect of lisinopril. It's a blood pressure lowering drug. Her blood pressure is 130/85, which is a bit high, but perhaps her use of lisinopril is causing the adverse effect. Maybe it's making her more prone to blood pressure issues, which could be contributing to the tremor.

Option I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress. Essential tremor is a condition where the body's tremors are a part of its essential response to stress. The patient's condition is due to her taking stress drugs, so this could be a possibility.

Option J: Onset of multiple sclerosis. MS is a chronic condition, but the patient is 70, and her other medications and medical history suggest she's probably not starting MS.

So, thinking about her medical history: she's taking fluoxetine (stress-related), atorvastatin (high BP), and possibly other medications that affect her body's response. Her tremor is now more noticeable and frequent, and she's having an increased alcohol intake. So the most likely cause is an adverse effect of a medication she's taking, like atorvastatin (causing hypotension) or lisinopril (causing high blood pressure), or perhaps her stress response is affected, leading to increased tremors, which could be an essential tremor.

Alternatively, increased alcohol consumption is a known cause of tremors, especially when consumed suddenly. So E is a strong candidate.

But let me think: her medical history includes essential hypertension ( controlled with lisinopril) and hyperlipidemia ( controlled with atorvastatin). Atorvastatin is used to lower blood pressure, so if it's an adverse effect, it would make her blood pressure worse, possibly affecting tremors or other symptoms.

Fluoxetine is a mood stabilizer and may not cause tremors, but if it's an adverse effect, it might make her more susceptible to other conditions, including tremors.

So, the options to consider are E (alcohol) and H (lisinopril). Her current condition is due to stress, and she's taking stress medications, so the likely cause is stress-related. Therefore, option I (essential tremor exacerbated by stress) is a possibility.

Alternatively, an increase in alcohol (option E) could be another reason, but consider that her medical history includes an alcohol problem. But her current condition is due to her husband's death, which is a separate reason.

So, the most likely cause from the options given and her symptoms is either E or I. But her other medications—lisinopril and atorvastatin—are both low-dose, so the adverse effects might not be severe yet. Her current symptoms are worse, suggesting that the adverse effect is causing the tremor.

Wait, but her question is about the most likely cause, given her current symptoms. Let's look at the options again.

The patient is a 70-year-old with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia (using atorvastatin and lisinopril), taking fluoxetine, which is likely for grief. The patient is experiencing more frequent and severe tremors, which might be due to the adverse effects (like hypotension) from her medications. Or, it could be an increase in alcohol, which is a known cause.

Alternatively, her medical history includes her drinking a glass of wine daily, which is a common reason for tremors. So, E might be the answer.

But then, her other medications—lisinopril and atorvastatin—could also be contributing. Her blood pressure is 130/85, which is a bit elevated, but not as high as her other conditions, so maybe these drugs are the main contributors.

Wait, but the question is about the most likely cause given her current symptoms. So, if the patient is taking fluoxetine, which is for emotional and psychological distress, and the tremor is more pronounced now, perhaps the adverse effect of fluoxetine is the cause.

But in options, fluoxetine's effect is option H, which says "Adverse effect of lisinopril therapy." Wait, no, the options for adverse effects would be H if it's the adverse effect of lisinopril. Alternatively, fluoxetine's adverse effect is option H.

Wait, wait, let me read the options again.

Options:

A: Early Parkinson disease – probably not, as the patient's condition is more likely related to stress and medications.

B: Adverse effect of fluoxetine – this is a possible option.

C: Adverse effect of atorvastatin – possible.

D: Adverse effect of ibuprofen – unlikely.

E: Increase in alcohol consumption – possible.

F: Hyperthyroidism – not considered yet.

G: Bereavement reaction – possible.

H: Adverse effect of lisinopril – possible.

I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress – possible.

J: Onset of multiple sclerosis – unlikely.

So, the patient is taking fluoxetine (B), which is an SSRI and could cause tremors (B). Her medical history includes that fluoxetine is used for stress-related issues, so the adverse effect of fluoxetine (option B) could explain the increased tremor.

Alternatively, if her medical history includes the use of lisinopril (F), then the adverse effect of atorvastatin (C) is the cause. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the options are the possible causes. So, the possible causes are: fluoxetine's adverse effect, atorvastatin's adverse effect, lisinopril's adverse effect, etc.

But the question is, which of the options is the most likely.

So, the patient is taking atorvastatin (to manage hypertension) and lisinopril (to manage hyperlipidemia). Both are blood pressure lowering drugs. If their use is an adverse effect, it would cause higher blood pressure, which could be contributing to tremors or other symptoms.

But her current condition is more about the adverse effect of a medication, not her medical history. Her medical history is her reason for the condition. So, if her current condition is due to the use of these medications, then the cause is either fluoxetine's effect (B), or atorvastatin's (C), or lisinopril's (F).

But her medical history includes fluoxetine as a treatment, so the adverse effect of fluoxetine (B) could be the cause.

But the question is, which is the most likely? It's possible that both B and F (or H) could be reasons.

Alternatively, her alcohol consumption (E) is a known cause of tremor. She's a 70-year-old with a 168 cm height and 70 kg weight. That's a moderate height for her age, but her alcohol intake is significant.

So, the possible answers are E, H, or B.

Wait, but the patient's medical history includes taking fluoxetine, so fluoxetine's use is an adverse effect—so that's option B.

But another possibility is that her medical history includes her taking atorvastatin, which is an adverse effect, so that's option C.

Alternatively, the adverse effect of lisinopril (option F) could be the cause.

But her blood pressure is 130/85, which is a bit high but not extremely high. lisinopril is supposed to lower blood pressure, so if it's an adverse effect (like making her blood pressure worse), that might be a possibility.

So, the patient's condition is due to her taking these medications, which are known for their adverse effects on her health. So, the most likely cause is the adverse effect of a medication she's taking.

Alternatively, her current symptoms suggest that the condition is due to her stress-related medications interfering with her body's response, leading to more tremors.

So, the options are:

B: adverse effect of fluoxetine

H: adverse effect of lisinopril

F: adverse effect of atorvastatin

But in her case, the patient is on atorvastatin (to lower her blood pressure) and lisinopril (for hyperlipidemia). So, if these are considered as possible causes (like, for instance, atorvastatin's use is an adverse effect), then the patient's condition is due to the adverse effects of these medications.

So, the correct options are B, H, or F.

But the question is about the most likely cause.

Another angle: The patient's question is about the most likely cause of the tremor. The tremor is more pronounced and noticeable now. She is a 70-year-old, 168 cm, 70 kg, which is a moderate height but not extremely tall. She's drinking more alcohol, and her medical history includes the use of fluoxetine.

So, think about possible medical conditions: hyperthyroidism (F), but her blood pressure is 130/85, which isn't hyperthyroidism. Another condition is essential tremor (I), which is a condition where the body's tremors are part of its normal response to stress.

Her medical history includes taking fluoxetine, which is used to manage emotional and physical stress. So, the interfering effect of the medications on her body's response to stress could be causing the increased tremors.

In that case, the most likely cause would be the adverse effect of a medication she's taking, which is either B, H, or F.

But the patient's medical history includes the use of both atorvastatin and lisinopril. So, the adverse effect of atorvastatin (H) could be the cause. Alternatively, the adverse effect of lisinopril (F) is another possible cause.

Both F and H are possible. But since the patient is on both, it's possible that both are contributing. But the question is about the most likely cause.

Alternatively, her increased alcohol consumption (E) is another possible cause, especially if she was previously under control.

Now, considering that, and what the options are, I need to figure which is the best fit.

The patient's current condition is due to her taking fluoxetine (B), atorvastatin (C), and lisinopril (F). So, the possible causes are these.

But the question is, which is the most likely.

Another angle: the patient's medical history includes the use of fluoxetine as a treatment for her husband's death. So, her current condition is perhaps due to the adverse effects of the medications she's taking.

Therefore, the answer could be the adverse effects of any of the medications she's taking, which includes fluoxetine (B), atorvastatin (C), and lisinopril (F).

So, the options are B, C, F.

But the question is about the most likely cause, so perhaps the answer is B (fluoxetine's adverse effect), H (lisinopril's), or F (atorvastatin's).

But wait, the question is about the most likely cause, given the patient's current symptoms. The patient is experiencing more frequent and severe tremors, which could be due to the adverse effect of a drug she's taking (fluoxetine, atorvastatin, lisinopril), or due to alcohol consumption.

But considering the patient's medical history, the most likely cause is the use of these medications, which are known to have adverse effects on blood pressure and possibly tremors.

But then, considering the options, which is the most likely.

Another thought: Her blood pressure is 130/85, which is a bit elevated, but not as high as her other conditions, so perhaps these drugs don't have a severe adverse effect yet. So, the most likely cause is something more permanent, like the adverse effect of a drug, which would take time to manifest.

In that case, the answer would be B, H, or F.

Alternatively, her current condition could be due to alcohol consumption (E), but given that her medical history includes her taking these stress medications, it's more likely that the condition is due to the medications.

So, between B, H, F, and E, which is the best?

Well, her medical history includes the use of fluoxetine, atorvastatin, and lisinopril. All of these are known to have adverse effects. So, the patient's condition is most likely caused by the adverse effects of these medications.

But the question is, which option lists the most likely cause.

If the patient is taking fluoxetine, and that's an SSRI, it's possible that the adverse effect of fluoxetine is causing the tremors. So, option B.

But then, considering the other options, if the patient is also taking atorvastatin, that would cause H. But her blood pressure is 130/85, not as high as atorvastatin's target of 140/90. So, maybe H isn't the main issue yet.

Alternatively, the patient is on multiple medications, so the most likely cause is the adverse effect of any of these, which would include fluoxetine (B), atorvastatin (H), and lisinopril (F).

But the question is about the most likely option, so perhaps the correct answer is B: fluoxetine's adverse effect.

But I'm not certain. Another approach is to consider the options and see which one is more likely.

In the patient's current symptoms, the tremor is more noticeable and frequent, and she's taking fluoxetine, which is for stress. So, the most likely cause is the adverse effect of a drug she's taking, which is fluoxetine (B), or another drug (like atorvastatin or lisinopril).

But the patient's medical history includes all three, so the most likely cause is fluoxetine's adverse effect (B), or one of the others.

Alternatively, given that her medical history includes her taking fluoxetine, which is likely to cause tremors, the answer would be B.

Wait, but the patient's current condition is due to her taking fluoxetine. So, the most likely cause is the adverse effect of fluoxetine.

Thus, option B is the answer.
</think>

The patient's current condition involves a more pronounced and frequent tremor, which is more noticeable and frequent now. Her medical history includes taking fluoxetine (to cope with grief), atorvastatin (to lower blood pressure), and lisinopril (to lower hyperlipidemia). The tremor is more severe and more noticeable, suggesting a potential interfering factor. Additionally, her alcohol consumption is a known contributor to tremors.

Considering the options:

- **Option B: Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy**  
  Fluoxetine is an SSRI used for emotional and physical stress. If it's an adverse effect, it could explain the tremor. However, the patient's medical history includes fluoxetine as part of her treatment, making this a strong candidate.

- **Option H: Adverse effect of lisinopril therapy**  
  Lisinopril is used to lower hyperlipidemia, but the patient's blood pressure is 130/85, which is not extremely high. If its adverse effect is causing the tremor, this could be a possibility.

- **Option F: Hyperthyroidism**  
  This is unlikely given the patient's other medical history and her current symptoms.

- **Option E: Increase in alcohol consumption**  
  This is a known contributor to tremors and could explain the patient's current condition.

- **Other Options (A, C, D, G, I)**  
  These options are less likely because the patient's medical history includes fluoxetine, atorvastatin, and lisinopril as part of her treatment, and her current condition is more likely due to the adverse effects of these medications.

Given that the patient's current condition is due to her taking fluoxetine, atorvastatin, and lisinopril, the most likely cause is the adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy (Option B). However, the patient's alcohol consumption (Option E) is also a strong possibility. Considering her medical history and the known role of fluoxetine in managing emotional stress, the most likely answer is:

**ANSWER: B**
