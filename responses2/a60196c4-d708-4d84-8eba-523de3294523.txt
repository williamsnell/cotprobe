Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about Mary Anne, a pieceworker, who currently produces 370 units each day. A consultant suggests a change in her method that would increase production by 30%. I need to figure out how many units she should produce after this change.

Hmm, so first, I should calculate what a 30% increase on 370 units would be. Let me think about how to calculate percentage increases. I remember that to find a percentage increase, you take the original amount, multiply it by the percentage (expressed as a decimal), and then add that to the original amount.

So, 30% as a decimal is 0.30. Multiply 370 by 0.30. Let me do that calculation. 370 * 0.3 equals... let's see, 300 * 0.3 is 90, and 70 *0.3 is 21, so 90+21 is 111. So, the increase is 111 units.

Now, I need to add that increase to the original 370 units. So, 370 + 111 equals... 370 + 100 is 470, plus 11 is 481. So, the new production would be 481 units per day.

Looking at the options, option G is 481 units. So, the answer should be G.

The change in method increases production by 30%. Calculating 30% of 370 units gives 111 units. Adding this to the original 370 units results in 481 units. 

Answer: G: 481 units.
