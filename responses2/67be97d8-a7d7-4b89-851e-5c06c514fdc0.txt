Alright, let's tackle this economics problem. Okay, so the question is about price elasticity and consumer spending. Hmm, I remember that price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded responds to a change in price. The formula is elastic (E) = percentage change in quantity demanded / percentage change in price. Wait, but wait, sometimes I get confused with the exact formula. Oh right, it's (ΔQ/Q) divided by (ΔP/P). So, if the price goes up and the quantity demanded goes down, that's elastic or inelastic, depending on the magnitude.

The question says that the price of beef rises by 10%, and the quantity demanded falls by 20%. So, plugging into the formula: E = (-20%) / (10%) = -2. The negative sign just indicates the inverse relationship, but for elasticity, we take the absolute value. So, E is 2.

Now, what does that tell us about the elasticity? If E is greater than 1, demand is elastic. Less than 1, inelastic. Equal to 1, unitary (perfectly elastic or perfectly inelastic). So here, E is 2, which is greater than 1. That means the demand is price elastic. So, the options that say 'elastic' or 'unit elastic' would be A, D, C, etc.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A says demand is price elastic and consumer spending is rising. Option D is similar but says consumer spending is falling. Wait, why would consumer spending be rising or falling? Because price elasticity affects how consumers spend.

But wait, let's think about consumer spending. If demand is elastic, price increases and quantity decreases. So, price elasticity is elastic (so demand is responsive to price change). So, for price elastic, when price goes up, quantity goes down by more than the percentage. So, with 10% up, 20% down, the quantity drops more than the price increase. So, since price is going up, and quantity is falling by more, the consumer's total spending (quantity * price) would be (P + 10%) * (Q - 20%) = P*Q * (1.1) * (0.8) = P*Q * 0.88. That's a decrease in spending. So, if demand is elastic, when price increases, total spending decreases. So, if price goes up and demand is elastic, spending goes down. So, in this case, since price up and spending would decrease, which of the options have that?

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B: demand is inelastic, spending is falling. So, in this case, since E is 2, which is elastic, so option B says demand is inelastic (incorrect) and spending is falling (correct). So, B is out because demand is not inelastic.

Option C: demand is unit elastic. E is 1, not 2. So, no.

Option A: demand elastic (correct), spending rising. Wait, but we thought spending would fall. So A is wrong.

Option D: demand elastic, spending falling. That's what we found. So D would be correct.

Wait, but what about the consumer spending? The quantity is falling more than proportionally. So, the total spending (which is quantity times price) would go from Q*P to (0.8*Q) * (1.1*P) = 0.88 QP, which is 88% of original. So, it's lower than before. So, consumer spending is falling.

So, in the options, the ones that have 'demand for beef is price elastic' are A, D, and G. Because G says demand is perfectly elastic and spending is falling. Well, if demand is perfectly elastic, price changes would cause quantity to adjust infinitely. But in reality, perfect elasticity is a theoretical concept where any increase in price would lead to zero quantity demanded, which is a bit unrealistic. But the question doesn't specify any such extremes.

So, in our case, E is 2, so it's not perfectly elastic. So, the correct options are either A or D.

Wait, let me double-check. The question is about which option is correct. So, options A and D both say 'demand for beef is price elastic' and then talk about consumer spending.

Option A: spending is rising. But we thought it's falling. So A is incorrect.

Option D: spending is falling. Which is correct.

But wait, what about the other options. Let's think about the other options. Option G says demand is perfectly elastic and spending is falling. But if demand is perfectly elastic, price increases would lead to zero quantity. So, spending would be zero as well. But in that case, the price would be something very high, but quantity is zero, so spending is zero regardless. However, perfect elasticity is a special case where it's not really possible in the real world, but the question doesn't say anything about that. So, perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, but another angle: price elasticity is calculated as (delta Q)/(delta P) * 100. So, if P goes up 10%, Q goes down 20%, so E is 20/10 = 2. So, E is 2, so elastic. Thus, the demand is price elastic.

So, the correct statements are that demand is price elastic. Now, looking at the options, the ones that match are A and D.

Option A: demand elastic, spending rising. But as we saw, spending falls. So A is wrong.

Option D: demand elastic, spending falls. So D is correct.

Now, looking at the other options, option G is about perfect elasticity. But in this case, it's not perfect, so G is incorrect.

So, the correct answer is D.

The question involves analyzing the price elasticity of demand for beef based on a 10% increase in price and a 20% decrease in quantity demanded. Using the formula for price elasticity of demand (E = ΔQ/Q / ΔP/P), the calculation is:

E = (-20%) / (10%) = -2. Taking the absolute value, E = 2, which indicates that the demand for beef is price elastic.

Price elasticity greater than 1 means that when price increases, total consumer spending decreases. Since the price of beef rises and the quantity demanded falls by a larger proportion, consumer spending on beef will fall.

Now, examining the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. It states that consumer spending rises, which contradicts the fact that price elasticity of 2 (elastic) leads to a decrease in spending.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It claims demand is inelastic but calculates E as 2, ruling out inelasticity.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. It states demand is unit elastic, but E is 2, not 1.
- **Option D**: Correct. It states demand is price elastic and consumer spending falls, which aligns with the calculation.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Perfect elasticity is not applicable here, and there is no indication of perfect elasticity in the question.

Thus, the correct answer is **D**.
