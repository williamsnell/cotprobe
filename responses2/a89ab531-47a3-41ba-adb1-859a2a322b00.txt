Okay, so I've got this induction motor problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The problem says that the rotor current per phase is 10 amperes when the slip is 5 percent. The rotor effective resistance is 0.1 ohms per phase. I need to find the internal power developed per phase from the options given.

Hmm, right. I remember that in induction motors, the power can be calculated in a few different ways. One common method is using the formula P = I²R, where P is the power, I is the current, and R is the resistance. But wait, is that the case when the motor is operating at a certain speed?

Wait, but that formula is for a purely resistive load, right? Because in an induction motor, the mechanical power developed isn't directly the same as the electrical power. Oh wait, no, I think that's the case here because the problem refers to the internal power developed. So maybe that's the correct approach.

Wait, let me think again. The formula P = I²R is the power dissipated in the stator windings if the rotor were spinning at zero speed. But in reality, the rotor is moving, so the actual power might be different. Oh wait, but wait—the question is about the internal power, which is the electrical power that's being dissipated. So maybe the formula I'm thinking about is used here.

So, the rotor current is 10 A per phase. The effective resistance is 0.1 ohms. So applying P = I²R, that would be (10)^2 * 0.1 = 100 * 0.1 = 10 watts per phase.

Wait, but then why is the slip given? Because the slip is 5%—does that affect the internal power?

Wait, because when the slip is present, the rotor current changes. The slip (s) is defined as (f - f_r)/f_r, where f is the synchronous speed and f_r is the rotor speed. But how does that relate to the current? Oh wait, the current in the rotor is related to the slip. Because when the slip increases, the current increases.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The formula for the rotor current in an induction motor is I_r = (P / √3) * (R2 / (s√R2 - R1)) ), but that's when both R1 and R2 are known. Alternatively, I recall that when the slip is s, the rotor current is I_r = I_s*(s√R2 - R1)/√R2 ), but maybe that's not exactly right. Alternatively, perhaps when the slip is s, the rotor current is I_r = I_s * (s√R2 - R1)/√R2, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think about the relationship between the rotor current and the slip. The rotor current is I_r = (P / (3√3)) * (1)/(s√(R2/(R1)) )). Hmm, perhaps that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I remember that during normal operation, the slip is small (like 5%) and the rotor current is much less than the stator current. But in this problem, the given current is when the slip is 5%. So perhaps the formula I'm thinking of (P = I²R) is actually the mechanical power, not the electrical.

Wait, wait, but the question says the internal power is being referred to. So perhaps the internal electrical power is the one we're calculating. Or maybe the question is a bit misleading, and it's just asking about the electrical power, which is I²R.

But in that case, the answer would be 10 watts per phase. Looking at the options, H is 10, but wait, looking at the options again:

Options are A to J, with H being 10. But wait, let's double-check. The options are:

A:1.9
B:150
C:95
D:200
E:250
F:50
G:190
H:10
I:100
J:20

Wait, so from my calculation, it's 10 watts. But looking at the options, H is 10. But why is the option B 150 watts and others?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem. Oh! Wait, could it be that the given current is the armature current, and not the rotor current? The problem states that the rotor current is 10 A per phase when loaded. So the formula should be P = I_r² * R, so (10)^2 * 0.1 = 100 * 0.1 = 10 watts. So the answer would be option H (10 watts). But wait, looking at the options, I don't see option H as 10. Let me check: Option H is 10. But wait, the options are A:1.9, B:150, C:95, D:200, E:250, F:50, G:190, H:10, I:100, J:20. So yes, option H is 10.

But wait, wait—the problem says the rotor current is 10 A per phase when loaded. So if the formula is P = (I_r)^2 * R, then P would be 10^2 * 0.1 = 100 * 0.1 = 10 W. So option H is 10 watts. But why is option E 250? Did I misunderstand the formula?

Wait, maybe I'm incorrect in using I_r squared times R. Another approach: The electrical power in an induction motor is equal to the armature current squared times the armature resistance, as P = I_a² R_a. But sometimes, in terms of the rotor current, perhaps we have to relate I_a and I_r.

Another thought: The formula for the electrical power in an induction motor is P = V_a * I_a * cos φ, but that's the actual mechanical power. The electrical power is I_a² R_a, but the formula I've used before, I_r² R, is perhaps correct as well.

Wait, perhaps the internal power refers to the electrical power, meaning the power supplied by the stator to the rotor. So that would be I_r squared times the effective resistance. So 10^2 * 0.1 = 100 * 0.1 = 10 W. So the answer would be H (10 W). But wait, looking at the options, that's an option.

Wait, but looking at the options again, there's a 'H' option, which is 10 W. So perhaps the correct answer is H. But wait, let me check my calculation again. Oh, wait a second: Oh! Wait a minute, I might have made a mistake in the formula. I'm using I_r squared times R. But perhaps the correct formula is P = (I_r * R) * I_r = I_r^2 R.

Yes, that's the same thing. So 10^2 * 0.1 is 100 * 0.1 = 10 W. So option H is 10 W. But looking at the options, the answer H is 10, but that's one of the options. So why would the options have such a low value when the current is 10 A and resistance is 0.1 ohms?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps I need to compute the mechanical power, not the electrical. Because the question says 'internal power developed per phase.' Wait, internal power here is probably the mechanical power, not the electrical. Because internal power is the electrical power that's being supplied by the stator to the rotor.

Wait, but the question says 'internal power developed per phase.' So I think that's referring to the electrical power. So that's correct, it's 10 W.

Wait, but looking at the options, H is 10. So that's the option. So the correct answer should be H. But wait, the options are labeled A to J, with H being 10. So the answer is H.

Wait, but why isn't the answer B (150)? Because 10^2 * 0.1 is 10, not 150. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assumption.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Because sometimes the formula for the electrical power is P = (I_r * V), but that's the actual power, which is V * I_r = V_r * I_r. But V_r is I_r * R. So V_r is 10 A * 0.1 ohm = 1 V. Then, P = V_r * I_r = 1 V * 10 A = 10 W. So that's the same answer.

Hmm. So why would the options have 150? Am I missing a factor? Oh wait, perhaps the formula is P = (I_r)^2 * (R2) / (s* sqrt(R2) + R1)) * something. Wait, maybe the rotor current isn't I_r = (I_a)/(s√R2 + R1). Or perhaps it's more complicated.

Wait, another approach: The formula for the armature current is I_a = (P) / (3√3 * V_m * (1 - s²)). But perhaps that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for the mechanical power (which is the power dissipated in the rotor) is P_mechanical = (I_r)^2 * R2. So with I_r = 10 A, R2 = 0.1 ohm. So (10)^2 * 0.1 = 100 * 0.1 = 10 W.

So the internal power (electrical) is 10 W. So the correct answer is H. But let me check the options again. The options are:

Options:
A: 1.9
B:150
C:95
D:200
E:250
F:50
G:190
H:10
I:100
J:20

So option H is 10. So the answer should be H. So why would the options have a 150? Maybe I'm wrong in my approach.

Wait, wait a second. Oh! Another thought: Maybe the formula is P = (I_r * V_r). But V_r is I_r * R, which is 10 * 0.1 = 1 V. So P = 10 *1 = 10 W. That still gives 10 W.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is P = (I_r)^2 * R. That's what I did. So 10^2 * 0.1 = 10 W.

So the correct answer is H.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the internal power developed per phase in an induction motor. The given data includes a rotor current of 10 A per phase and an effective rotor resistance of 0.1 Ω per phase. The slip is 5%, but it is not directly relevant to the calculation of internal power, which is determined by the formula \( P = I_r^2 \cdot R \).

1. **Formula Application**:  
   The internal power developed per phase is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   P = I_r^2 \cdot R
   \]  
   Substituting the given values:  
   \[
   P = (10)^2 \cdot 0.1 = 100 \cdot 0.1 = 10 \, \text{W}
   \]

2. **Analysis of Options**:  
   The calculated internal power is 10 W. Among the provided options, this corresponds to **Option H (10 W)**. Other options, such as 150 W (Option B) or 95 W (Option C), do not match the calculation. The other options are either too high or too low.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The correct answer is **Option H (10 W)**, as it matches the calculated internal power developed per phase.
