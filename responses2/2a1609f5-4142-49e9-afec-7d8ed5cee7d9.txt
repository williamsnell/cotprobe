Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this logic problem. Let me read it again.

The argument is: "It is wrong for society to kill a murderer. This follows for the reason that if a murderer is wrong in killing his victim, then society is also wrong in killing the murderer. And a murderer is wrong in killing his victim." 

So the conclusion we're looking for is about whether a murderer is right or wrong in killing their victim. The question is about identifying the correct conclusion based on the given premises.

Let me break it down step by step. This sounds like a hypothetical syllogism. So, the structure is:

1. P → Q (If a murderer is wrong (P), then society is wrong (Q) in killing them.)
2. P (A murderer is wrong in killing his victim.)
3. Therefore, Q (Society is also wrong in killing the murderer.)

Wait, but in logical terms, the syllogism is P → Q and P, so by modus ponens, we can conclude Q. So the conclusion should be that society is wrong in killing the murderer.

Looking at the options, option J says: "It is wrong for society to kill a murderer." That matches our conclusion.

Wait, but let me double-check. The argument presented seems to be that if a murderer is wrong, then society is wrong. The premise also states the murderer is wrong, so the conclusion should be that society is wrong. So J is the conclusion.

Alternatively, let me check what the options are.

Options:

A: murderer is not wrong in killing his victim. → Opposite conclusion.
B: murderer is right in killing his victim → That's the opposite conclusion. So this would mean society is right as well, which is the opposite of what the argument supports. So not the conclusion.
C: And a murderer is wrong in killing his victim. → It's just restating the premise.
D: This does not follow → So the argument doesn't support this conclusion.
E: And a murderer is not wrong in killing his victim. → Again, opposite conclusion.
F: This follows → So society is wrong. That's the conclusion.
G: If a murderer is wrong, then society is wrong. → That's the premise, not the conclusion.
H: Society is not wrong. → Opposite conclusion.
I: murderer is right → Opposite conclusion.
J: Society is wrong → Correct conclusion.

So the correct answer is J.

The argument concludes that society is wrong in killing a murderer because the premises support that. 

Answer: J: It is wrong for society to kill a murderer.
