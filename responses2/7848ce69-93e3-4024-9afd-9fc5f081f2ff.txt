Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about work done by a system in a reaction. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The container has a cross-sectional area of 50 cm². Oh wait, cross-sectional area is in cm². So I think that's the area of the piston, right? And the reaction causes the piston to push out through 15 cm against an external pressure of 1.0 atm. I need to calculate the work done by the system.

Wait, work done by the system... Oh wait, work done on the system is negative, right? Or work done by the system is positive. No, wait, no, work done by the system is positive, and work done on the system is negative. Because usually, when the system expands, it's doing work on the surroundings, which would mean positive work for the system.

Wait, no, no. Let me get this right. The formula for work done by the system is w = -P_ext * ΔV. Because when the system expands, the volume increases, so ΔV is positive. But wait, no, wait. The formula is w = -P_ext * V, right? Or wait, in some conventions, work done by the system is considered positive when the system expands. So if the system expands, the work is positive.

Wait, but let me think about the sign conventions. In chemistry, the work done by the system is considered positive when the system does work on the surroundings. So for expansion (volume increases), the system is doing work, so work is positive. But wait, sometimes the formula is written as w = -P_ext * ΔV, which would make work negative if the system is expanding (since ΔV is positive, and work done by the system is positive).

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's make it clear. The formula for work done by the system is w = -P_ext * ΔV. So when the system expands (ΔV positive), the work done by the system is negative, which would imply that the system is losing energy, which doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the formula is w = P_ext * ΔV when the system is expanding. So, if the system does work, then the work is positive, so w is positive. 

Wait, I'm getting myself tied up. Let me think. The work done by the system is considered negative when the system is losing energy because the sign convention is that work done by the system is negative. Or is it the other way around? Let me check. In physics, when work is done on the system, it's positive. So in chemistry, the opposite: when the system expands and does work, the system loses energy (so the work is negative for the system's perspective).

Wait, maybe I should refer to the formula. Some sources say that work done by the system is calculated as w = -P_ext * ΔV. So if the system expands (ΔV positive), then the work is negative, because the system is losing energy as it does work. So the system's work is negative, meaning the system is losing energy, which makes sense.

Alternatively, some sources say that the work done by the system is positive when the system expands. So I'm a bit confused about the sign here. Let me proceed with the formula as w = -P_ext * V_change.

Wait, no. Because ΔV is calculated as V_final minus V_initial. If the piston is pushed out, the volume increases, so ΔV is positive (V_final > V_initial). So if the formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV, then when ΔV is positive, w becomes negative. That makes sense because the system is doing work, so the work is negative for the system.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the work done by the system is the answer. So if the system does work, the work is positive. But in this formula, it's negative. So maybe I should take the absolute value, but the sign depends on the convention.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is written as w = P_ext * ΔV, and the sign is determined by the system's direction. So if the system does work (expands), then w is positive. But then again, I thought that the formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV.

Hmm, maybe it's better to think about the units and the problem.

The cross-sectional area is 50 cm². The movement is 15 cm. So the change in volume, ΔV, is area multiplied by height. So 50 cm² * 15 cm = 750 cm³. But wait, 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, right? And 1 m³ is 1000 liters, but wait, wait, let's think in SI units. Let's convert cm to meters.

Wait, 50 cm² is 50 * (10^-2 m)^2 = 50 * 1e-4 m² = 5e-3 m².

15 cm is 0.15 meters.

So ΔV is area * height = 5e-3 m² * 0.15 m = 7.5e-4 m³.

But wait, 50 cm² is 50 * 10^(-6) m², which is 5e-5 m². Wait 50 cm^2 is 50 * 1e-4 m² = 5e-3 m²? Wait, 1 cm is 0.01 m. So 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 50 cm² is 50 * 1e-4 = 5e-3 m².

Yes, so 5e-3 m² * 0.15 m = 7.5e-4 m³.

So the change in volume is 7.5e-4 m³. Now the external pressure is 1.0 atm. I need to convert that to Pascals because work is in joules.

1 atm is approximately 101325 Pascals. So P_ext is 101325 Pa.

So, the work done by the system is w = - P_ext * ΔV.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Because the formula I'm thinking of is that when the system expands, it does work, so the work is positive for the surroundings (so system's work is negative).

Wait, but the formula for work done by the system is w = - P_ext * ΔV. So if the system expands (ΔV positive), w is negative. So the work done by the system is negative, meaning work is done on the system.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the formula. I've heard that the formula for work done by the system is w = -P_ext * V. So if the system expands, V increases, so w is negative, which makes sense because the system is losing energy.

So in this case, the work done by the system is negative.

But wait, the calculation would be:

w = - P_ext * ΔV

So plug in numbers:

P_ext = 101325 Pa

ΔV = 7.5e-4 m³

So,

w = -101325 * 7.5e-4

Let me calculate that.

101325 * 7.5e-4 = 101325 * 0.00075.

Wait, 101325 * 0.00075 = 75.99375 J.

But since the formula is negative, w = -75.99375 J ≈ -76 J.

So the work done by the system is approximately -76 J.

Looking at the options, option D is -75 J. Hmm, but wait, our calculation is about -76 J. So why is one of the options -75 J?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute ΔV and the work.

ΔV = 50 cm² * 15 cm.

Wait, 50 cm² is 50 * 10^-4 m² = 5e-3 m². 15 cm is 0.15 m.

ΔV = 5e-3 * 0.15 = 7.5e-4 m³.

P_ext = 101325 Pa.

So work done by the system: w = - P_ext * ΔV.

So,

w = -101325 * 7.5e-4.

Let me compute this: 101325 * 0.00075.

Hmm, 100000 * 0.00075 is 75. 1325 * 0.00075 is 1.0.

So total is 75 +1 =76. So 76 J, but with a negative sign: -76 J.

Looking at the options, option D is -75 J, and option F is -90 J. Wait, none of the options have -76. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait another moment—am I supposed to compute the work done by the surroundings, or the system?

Wait, no. The question is about the work done by the system, which is the work done on the system by the surroundings. Or wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the sign. If I have the system pushing the piston, then it's doing work on the surroundings. So work is done by the system, and the value should be negative if the system is losing energy.

Wait, but let me think again. The formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV. So if the system expands, ΔV is positive, so w is negative. That means the system is losing energy, so the work is done on the system, which makes sense.

So in our case, the work would be approximately -76 J. But none of the options give that. The closest is option D (-75 J). So why is that? Did I make a calculation mistake?

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Compute 101325 * 7.5e-4.

Let me compute 101325 * 7.5e-4.

First, 7.5e-4 is 0.00075.

So 101325 * 0.00075 = ?

Let me compute step by step:

101325 * 0.00075 = ?

We can compute 101325 * 750e-6 = 101325 * 750e-6.

Wait, 750e-6 is 0.00075.

So 101325 * 0.00075 = ?

Let me compute 101325 * 750e-6 = (101325 * 750 ) / 1e6.

Calculate 101325 * 750:

101325 * 700 = 70,927,500

101325 * 50 = 5,066,250

Adding them: 70,927,500 + 5,066,250 = 75,993,750.

So 75,993,750 / 1e6 = 75.99375 J.

So work done by the system is -75.99375 J ≈ -76 J.

But the options don't have -76. The closest is D (-75), and F is -90.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the area and the volume. Let me check the cross-sectional area again.

The container has a cross-sectional area of 50 cm². So 50 cm² is 50 * 10^-4 m², which is 5e-3 m².

The movement is 15 cm, which is 0.15 m.

So ΔV = 5e-3 m² * 0.15 m = 7.5e-4 m³. That's correct.

So the calculation seems correct.

Hmm, but the options don't have -76. So why is there a difference?

Wait, perhaps the units are different. Let me think: is 1 atm equal to 101325 Pa? Yes, it is. So P_ext is correct.

Wait another thought: is the work done by the system positive or negative? Because if it's expanding, the system is doing work on the surroundings, so the work done by the system should be negative.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in some conventions, the work done by the system is considered positive when the system expands. No, that doesn't sound right. Because when the system expands, it is losing energy, so for the system, that's a negative work.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be w = P_ext * ΔV, not negative. But that would imply work is positive when expanding, which is not correct.

No, the correct formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV. So my calculation stands at ≈-76 J.

So looking at the options, the closest is D (-75 J). But wait, the correct answer is -76 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the area or the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the area.

50 cm² = 50 * 10^-4 m² = 0.005 m².

No, wait, 50 cm² is 50 * (0.01 m)^2 = 50 * 1e-4 m² = 5e-3 m². So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should take the volume as 50 cm² * 15 cm, but is that correct?

Wait, the piston's movement is 15 cm. So the volume change is 50 cm² * 15 cm = 750 cm³. Oh wait, 750 cm³ is 0.00075 m³. Because 1 m³ is 1e6 liters, but wait, 1 m³ is 1e6 liters, but that's another matter. Wait, 1 liter is 1000 cm³, so 750 cm³ is 0.00075 m³. So that's correct.

So the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is in mmHg instead of atm? No, the question says 1.0 atm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the work done as positive.

Wait no, because if the system is doing work, the work is negative. So if the system is losing energy, the work is negative.

Wait, but the options don't have -76. The closest is option D (-75 J), but that's not exactly right.

Wait, perhaps I should compute with more precise numbers.

Wait, 101325 * 0.00075 = ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

101325 * 0.00075.

Breaking it down: 101325 * 0.00075 = (101325 * 75) * 1e-6.

Because 0.00075 is 75 * 1e-6.

Wait, 75 * 101325 = 7,599,375.

Multiply by 1e-6: 7,599,375 * 1e-6 = 7.599375 J.

So the work is approximately -7.599 J, which is about -7.6 J.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, did I convert cm² to m² correctly?

Yes, 50 cm² = 50 * 1e-4 m² = 5e-3 m².

15 cm = 0.15 m.

So V change is 5e-3 * 0.15 = 7.5e-4 m³.

So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but in the answer options, the closest is D (-75 J), but that's off by about 1 J.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the piston is pushed out, so the work done by the system is positive.

Wait, wait a second, perhaps I confused the formula. Sometimes, the formula is written as w = P_ext * ΔV, without the negative. So if the system expands, it's positive, and the work is done on the surroundings.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the system is doing work on the surroundings. So the work should be negative.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is w = P_ext * ΔV, but since the system is expanding, the work is positive, meaning work is done by the system.

Wait, no, that would not make sense. I think my confusion arises from the sign conventions.

Wait, in the context of thermodynamics, the first law is ΔU = Q + W, where W is the work done on the system. So if the system does work (expands), W is positive (work done on system) and the system loses energy. But wait, that's getting confusing.

Another approach: Let's think about the definition of work done by the system. It's equal to the negative of the work done on the system. So if the system does work (expands), then work done on the system is negative, so work done by the system is positive.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe a better approach is to think about the work done by the system in the context of the system expanding.

Wait, when a gas expands, it does work in pushing against the external force. The work done by the system is positive, so the system is losing energy. So the formula for the work done by the system is w = -P_ext * ΔV.

So the formula is correct. So the example calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the options are wrong, but the intended answer is D (-75 J), but I'm getting -76 J. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest is D.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the work done by the system, so perhaps the formula is w = P_ext * ΔV.

Wait, if that's the case, then w = 101325 * 7.5e-4 = 75.99375 J, approximately 76 J. So the work done by the system is positive 76 J.

But in this case, the problem says the system is expanding, so the work should be negative.

Wait, maybe the formula is written as w = -P * ΔV, so the work done is negative when the system expands.

So the calculation is correct, w = -76 J.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is D (-75 J), but that's a bit off.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses pressure in different units or it's a typo. Let me recheck the calculation.

ΔV = 50 cm² * 15 cm = 750 cm³.

Convert cm³ to m³: 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³. So 750 cm³ = 0.00075 m³.

So P_ext = 101325 Pa.

Work done by the system: w = - P_ext * ΔV.

So, w = -101325 * 0.00075 = -75.99375 J ≈ -76 J.

So the correct answer should be approximately -76 J. But the options are:

A: 1.0e5 J (100,000 J)

B: -1.0e5 J (-100,000 J)

C: -7.5e4 J (-75,000 J)

D: -75 J (-75 J)

E: -9.0e4 J (-90,000 J)

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross-sectional area and movement.

Wait, another approach: compute the volume change in liters and then compute the work.

ΔV = 50 cm² * 15 cm = 750 cm³.

1 cm³ = 1 mL = 0.001 L.

So 750 cm³ = 0.75 L.

At 1 atm, 1 L of gas occupies about 0.0224 L at STP, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, but the work done by the system is P_ext times the volume change. So at 1 atm, the work done is 101325 Pa * 0.75 L.

But wait, 1 L = 0.001 m³, so 0.75 L = 0.00075 m³.

So the same calculation: 101325 * 0.00075 = 75.99375 J, so negative: -76 J.

So the options don't have that, but perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the volume.

Wait, perhaps the movement is 15 cm, but the cross-sectional area is 50 cm², so the volume change is 50 *15 = 750 cm³, which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the movement is 15 cm, but in the other direction, but that's not affecting the volume.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the calculation is correct, but the problem wants the work done by the system, which is positive. So in that case, the work would be +76 J. But that doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the formula. Maybe the formula is w = P_ext * ΔV, and the sign is determined based on whether the system is doing work or not. If the system is doing work, the work is negative.

In this case, the system is expanding, so the work is negative. So the correct answer is -76 J.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the closest is option D (-75 J) or option F (-90 J). But I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion. Let me double-check the conversion.

1 cm = 0.01 m.

1 cm² = (0.01 m)^2 = 0.0001 m².

So 50 cm² = 50 * 0.0001 = 0.005 m².

15 cm = 0.15 m.

So ΔV = 0.005 m² * 0.15 m = 0.00075 m³.

Which is correct.

So, w = - 101325 * 0.00075 = -75.99375 J ≈ -76 J.

So the correct answer is not listed.

But the options given are:

A: 1e5 (100,000 J)

B: -1e5 (-100,000 J)

C: -7.5e4 (-75,000 J)

D: -75 J (-75 J)

E: -9.0e4 (-90,000 J)

So none of these match -76 J. But perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the movement is 15 cm, but perhaps I should have considered the volume change as 50 cm² * 15 cm = 750 cm³, which is 0.75 L, but perhaps the problem expects the work to be computed in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the work in kilojoules, but the options are in different units.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the work in kilojoules, but that's not changing the fact.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the work to be written as positive, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the formula.

Wait, the formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV.

So, if the system is expanding, w is negative.

So, the correct calculation is w ≈ -76 J.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the area or volume calculation.

Wait, perhaps the movement is 15 cm, so the piston is pushed 15 cm to the outside. So the volume change is 50 cm² * 15 cm = 750 cm³.

Wait, but 750 cm³ is 0.00075 m³.

Wait, no mistake there.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but in the options, the closest is D (-75 J). But that's not correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D (-75 J), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem differently.

If the system is doing work on the surroundings, the work done by the system is positive. But in this case, the system is expanding, so it's losing energy, and the work done by the system is negative.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the work to be calculated as positive, but that's not correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the best option is D.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to calculate the work again with more precise numbers.

Compute 101325 * 0.00075.

101325 * 0.00075 = 101325 * 750e-9.

Wait, 750e-9 is 0.00075.

So 101325 * 0.00075 = 75.99375 J.

So the work done by the system is -75.99375 J ≈ -76 J.

So the correct answer should be -76 J, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is D (-75 J).

But I'm not confident because the calculation suggests a different result.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps 50 cm² is 50 * 10^(-6) m², which is 5e-5 m². Wait, no, 1 cm² is 1e-4 m², so 50 cm² is 50e-4 m² = 0.005 m².

Wait, same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the work to be written as positive, but that's incorrect.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is w = P_ext * ΔV * (-1), which would make the work positive.

Wait, that would imply w = 101325 * 0.00075 * (-1) = -75.99375 J. So the same result.

So the correct answer is -76 J.

But in the options, there is no such answer. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement is 15 cm, but in the opposite direction. No, that doesn't change anything.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I need to pick the closest option, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the formula uses pressure in different units. For example, perhaps I should convert 1 atm to kPa, but that doesn't change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses pressure in different units, like atm to bar, but that's not relevant here.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D (-75 J), but I'm not confident because the calculation is more precise.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer isn't listed and pick the closest option, but that's not a good approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 101325 * 0.00075 as follows:

101325 * 0.00075 = 101325 * 75e-6 = (101325 * 75) * 1e-6.

Compute 101325 * 75:

101325 * 70 = 7,092,750

101325 * 5 = 506,625

Total: 7,092,750 + 506,625 = 7,600,375

So 7,600,375 * 1e-6 = 7.600375 J.

So w ≈ -7.600375 J ≈ -7.6 J.

So the correct answer is approximately -7.6 J. But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Another formula: ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done on the system.

Wait, no, that's the same thing.

Wait, perhaps the formula is w = Q / ΔU, but that's not applicable here.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer should be option D (-75 J), but I'm not certain.

Wait, but wait a moment—perhaps the problem uses pressure in a different unit, like bar, but that doesn't change the calculation.

Wait, so I'm forced to conclude that the correct answer is approximately -76 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D (-75 J). But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the movement is 15 cm, but the area is 50 cm². So the volume change is 50 cm² * 15 cm = 750 cm³, which is 0.75 L.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is expecting the work in a different unit or a different calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula w = P * ΔV, and doesn't consider the negative sign, which would imply a positive work.

But in that case, the work would be positive 75 J, which isn't an option.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer is approximately -76 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D (-75 J). But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should check the problem statement again.

Problem statement: A chemical reaction occurs in a container. A piston is pushed out. The reaction happens in 15 cm of movement. The pressure is 1.0 atm.

Wait, but perhaps the movement is 15 cm, but the cross-sectional area is 50 cm², so the volume change is 50 cm² * 15 cm = 750 cm³, which is 0.75 L.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects the work to be calculated in kilojoules, but that's not the case.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. I think I need to pick the closest option, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the work, and the correct option is D (-75 J). But given the calculation, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute the work again.

Wait, 101325 Pa * 0.00075 m³ = 75.99375 J.

So w = -75.99375 J ≈ -76 J.

So the correct answer is -76 J, which is not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is D (-75 J), but I'm not certain.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the work done by a system in a chemical reaction, where the system expands against an external pressure. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Determine the volume change (ΔV):**  
   The system expands through a movement of 15 cm, and the cross-sectional area is 50 cm².  
   - Convert 15 cm to meters: 0.15 m.  
   - Convert 50 cm² to square meters: 0.0005 m².  
   - Volume change:  
     \[
     \Delta V = 0.0005 \, \text{m}^2 \times 0.15 \, \text{m} = 0.00075 \, \text{m}^3.
     \]

2. **Calculate the work done (w):**  
   The work done by the system is given by:  
   \[
   w = -P_{\text{ext}} \times \Delta V,
   \]  
   where \( P_{\text{ext}} = 1.0 \, \text{atm} \).  
   - Convert 1 atm to Pascals: \( 1 \, \text{atm} = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \).  
   - Substitute values:  
     \[
     w = -101325 \, \text{Pa} \times 0.00075 \, \text{m}^3 = -75.99375 \, \text{J}.
     \]  
   - Simplify:  
     \[
     w \approx -76 \, \text{J}.
     \]

3. **Evaluate the options:**  
   The calculated work is approximately \( -76 \, \text{J} \), but none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is \( \text{D} \) (-75 J), which is off by about 1 J.  

**Conclusion:**  
The correct calculation yields approximately \( -76 \, \text{J} \), but since this option is not available, the closest choice is \( \text{D} \) (-75 J).
