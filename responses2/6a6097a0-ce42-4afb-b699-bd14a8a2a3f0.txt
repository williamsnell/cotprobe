Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about session keys in computer networking. Let's try to break it down. The question is asking about the last character of the correct answer, which means I need to identify the correct option and then pick the last letter of that option.

The question says, "A session symmetric key between two parties is used." Hmm. I remember that in cryptography, a session key is a temporary key that's used for a short period of time when two parties communicate. So, this key is used only during that specific session.

Let me look at the options:

A: Twice  
So, this would mean the key is used twice. But isn't the session key used only once? Or maybe twice if the key is used in both directions? I think each direction uses the same key, so maybe it's used twice.

B: Until one of the parties terminates the session  
Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because a session key is temporary and usually used until the session ends. So this option suggests that the key continues, which might be incorrect.

C: For a predetermined length of time  
This makes sense because the key is supposed to be used for a specific duration. But wait, the question is about what's the last character of the correct answer. So maybe this is correct but let's check others.

D: Until a new key is generated  
No, because the session key is between two parties, not a new one. So this is probably not correct.

E: Only when both parties agree  
I don't think that's right. The session key is used as long as the session is ongoing, regardless of whether the parties agree to change keys.

F: Conditions dependant  
Hmm, maybe, but I'm not sure.

G: For a specific number of transactions  
This seems relevant because the session might handle a certain number of messages before the key expires. So this could be correct.

H: Multiple times  
No, because the key is used once per session, not multiple times.

I: Until the key is compromised  
No, because the key is only used during the session, not once it's compromised.

J: Only once  
Wait, this might be correct because each session is a one-time use.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The session key is used for the duration of the session. So when the session ends, the key is discarded. So the key is used once. But looking at the options, J says "Only once," which would fit. But sometimes, in some protocols, the key might be used for multiple sessions. Or maybe it's used once, and then it's discarded.

Alternatively, maybe the session key is used until it's refreshed. So perhaps the key isn't used once but only for a certain time, and then it changes.

Wait, the question states that the session key is used. So the correct answer is about when it's used. So, the key is used until the session ends. So which option says that? Let's see the options again.

Option E: Only when both parties agree — no, because the key is used regardless of whether they agree.

Option B: Until one of the parties terminates the session — that's incorrect because the key is used only during the session.

Option J: Only once — that could be correct if the session is only used once.

Wait, but maybe the session key is used until a new key is generated. Oh, that's option D. But that's not correct because the key is between two parties, so it's not a new key. So the key is used, and when does it expire? Probably when the session ends.

Wait, the question says, "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the answer options are A to J, and I need to pick the letter that corresponds to the correct option, and then the last letter of that option is the answer.

Wait, let me re-read the question. It's a multiple-choice question where each option is a possible answer, and the correct one is lettered A-J. The question is, what is the correct answer, and then I have to pick the last letter of that letter.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is, the last character of the correct answer is the letter. So, for example, if the correct answer is option B, then the last letter is 'B'.

So I need to figure out which option is correct, and then pick its last letter.

Let me try to think again about the session key. The session key is used for a specific time, and then it's discarded. So the key is used once, and that's why option J says "Only once," which would be correct. Alternatively, some protocols might allow the key to be used multiple times, but in this question, it's about what the session key is used for.

But another angle: the question says, "A session symmetric key between two parties is used." So the key is used between the two parties during the session. It's a one-time use. So the key is used only once.

So which option says that the key is used only once? That's option J: "Only once." So the correct answer would be J, whose last letter is 'J'. Wait, but that can't be right because J is the answer, so the last letter is 'J'. But the options are A-G, and I thought J was the correct one, but wait, perhaps not.

Wait, no, the options are A-G and H, etc. So the correct answer is J, which is option J. So the last letter is 'J'. But that's a bit odd because J is the correct answer. Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait another thought: The session key is used only during the session. So the answer is that the key is used until one of the parties terminates the session, which would be option B. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the session key is used until the session expires, which could be conditionally dependent on something else, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J: "Only once." So that's the correct one, and the last letter is 'J'.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall more about session keys. In a symmetric key exchange, the session key is a temporary key that's used for a short duration to establish a secure connection. As the session closes, the key is discarded. So the session key is used only once.

So the correct answer is that the session key is used only once, which is option J. So the last letter is 'J'.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is "Only once." So the correct answer is J, so the last letter is J. But the options are A to J, each with a letter. So the correct answer is J, which is the letter J. So the last character of the correct answer is J.

But wait, the question says, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the response is J, which is the letter. So the last character is J, which is 'J'.

Wait, but the options are A through J, each with a letter (like A is A, B is B, etc.). So the correct answer is J, which has the letter J as its last character. So the last letter of the correct option is J.

But looking at the options again, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: what is the correct usage of the session key?

The session key is used between two parties during the session. It's a one-time use. So the correct option is J: Only once.

So the answer is J, and the last letter is J.

Wait, but I'm not sure if J is the correct answer. Let me think about the options again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, but I'm getting confused because J is the answer, so the last letter is J.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B: Until one of the parties terminates the session. But that doesn't make sense because the session key is only used during the session, not until the session ends.

Wait, the session key is used for a specific time, so it's used once. So the correct answer is only once, option J.

So the correct answer is J, which is the letter J. So the last character is J.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each a letter. So J is the last letter of the correct option, which is J.

So, the correct answer is J, and the last letter is J.
</think>

The question asks about the session symmetric key and which option correctly describes its usage. The session key is used once during a session between two parties, and it's discarded after the session ends. 

Option J: "Only once" correctly describes the usage of the session key. Since the last letter of the correct answer is J, the final answer is J.

ANSWER: J
