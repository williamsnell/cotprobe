Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which expression equals 720. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is asking which of the options A to D, when multiplied together, gives 720. The options are:

A: 7 × 20
B: 9 × 90
C: 8 × 80
D: 9 × 80

Hmm, I should calculate each option and see which one equals 720. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A is 7 multiplied by 20. Let me do that calculation. 7 times 20 is 140. Wait, that's way less than 720. So option A is not the right answer.

Option B is 9 times 90. Let me compute that. 9 times 90 is 810. Hmm, that's more than 720 but not exactly 720. So option B isn't the answer either.

Option C is 8 multiplied by 80. Let me calculate that. 8 times 80 is 640. Again, that's less than 720. So option C is not correct.

Option D is 9 multiplied by 80. Let me compute that. 9 times 80. Wait, 9 times 80 is 720. Oh, that's exactly what we're looking for. So option D gives 720.

But wait, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check each calculation.

A: 7×20 = 140 ✅
B: 9×90 = 810 ✅
C: 8×80 = 640 ✅
D:9×80=720 ✅

Looks like option D is the correct one, as 9×80 equals 720. So the answer should be D.

The correct expression is 9 × 80, which equals 720.

Answer: D
