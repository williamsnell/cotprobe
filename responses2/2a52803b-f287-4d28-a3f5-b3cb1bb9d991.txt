Okay, so I have this property law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The homeowner conveyed his property to his cousin with a life estate, but it also has a remainder to his heirs. Then the cousin conveyed it to a farmer with a life estate for as long as he'd farm it. After the cousin dies, the heirs sued the farmer. The question is about which common law doctrine applies here.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on estates, but let's break it down step by step. 

First conveyance: homeowner to cousin for life, remainder to heirs. So the property has a life estate (for life) and a remainder to the heirs. Then the cousin's conveyance is to the farmer for as long as he farms it—so that's a life estate for the farmer. The farmer's life estate would normally terminate when the farmer dies, but since the farmer is the grantor, maybe the remainder takes over?

Wait, after the cousin's death, the farmer takes over the property. So the farmer's life estate ends, but then the remainder probably goes to the heirs. Now, the heirs sued the farmer. So what's the issue here?

I remember there are various estates and their rules. The key here is about the remainder and how it's transferred. The initial conveyance was by the homeowner to the cousin, giving him life and a remainder. Then the cousin to the farmer, giving him a life estate and presumably the remainder.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The first conveyance by the homeowner to the cousin: it's a life estate for life, plus a remainder to the heirs. Then the cousin conveys to the farmer: "for as long as he would continue to farm the property." So that's a life estate for the farmer, but the remainder? In the original conveyance, the remainder was to the heirs. So when the cousin conveys to the farmer, the remainder would go to whom? If the original remainder was to the heirs, maybe it's still theirs. Or perhaps the remainder is the same in both? Wait, no, because the original conveyance to the cousin included both a life estate and a remainder. Then the cousin conveyed to the farmer, so the remainder would pass to whom? If the remainder was to the heirs, perhaps they remain with the farmer? Or maybe the remainder passes to the farmer since the original conveyance to the cousin included a remainder.

Wait, maybe I should think about the transfer of the remainder. The first conveyance is a life estate (for life) plus a remainder to the heirs. So when the cousin conveys to the farmer, the remainder (to the heirs) would go to the farmer. Because the remainder is transferred with the property. So the farmer gets the remainder, which is to the original heirs.

Wait, but the original conveyance to the cousin included the remainder to the heirs. So when the cousin conveys to the farmer, the remainder (to the heirs) is transferred to the farmer. So the farmer now has a life estate (for life) and a remainder (to the farmer's heirs). Wait no, because the remainder was to the heirs, so if the farmer takes it, then the heir's heirs get it? Hmm, that doesn't quite make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the remainder is to the original heirs, so when the cousin conveys to the farmer, that remainder passes to the farmer. Because the remainder is a transferable interest. So the farmer owns the remainder—so they get a life estate (for life) and a remainder to their heirs. But wait, the farmer's life estate would presumably end when they die, but the remainder would then pass to whom? If the remainder is to the farmer's heirs, then perhaps the farmer's heirs get it. But the farmer is the one who now owns the property, so maybe the remainder would pass to the farmer's heirs, but that doesn't make sense because the farmer is the one who holds the property.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's consider the ownership chain. 

First conveyance: homeowner → cousin (life) and remainder to heirs.
Cousin → farmer (life) and remainder. But wait, does the remainder pass to the original heirs or to the farmer's heirs? 

If the remainder was to the heirs, when the cousin conveys to the farmer, that remainder would go to the farmer. So the farmer now has a life estate (for life) and a remainder to their heirs. But wait, that's the same situation as the original conveyance. Because the farmer is the one who now owns the property. So the remainder, if given to the farmer, would pass to the farmer's heirs, not the original heirs.

But then, after the farmer's life estate ends, the remainder (to the farmer's heirs) would go to whoever the farmer's heirs are. But then, the farmer dies, so the property should revert to their heirs. Unless the remainder is still theirs.

Wait, but the fact that the farmer has a life estate and a remainder—does the remainder then become a life estate for the heirs? I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the remainder is a life estate. Let me think about the different estates. 

The 'Life Estate' is for life, but a life estate can have a remainder, which is typically a future interest. So when the cousin conveys to the farmer, the remainder from the original conveyance (to the heirs) goes to whom? If the remainder is a future interest, it's likely to go to the grantor's heirs, i.e., the farmer's heirs. Because the original remainder was to the heirs, so when the cousin conveys it, it's transferred to the farmer, and the remainder goes to the farmer's heirs.

So now, the farmer's estate would be a life estate (for life) and a remainder to the farmer's heirs. But then, after the farmer's life estate ends, the remainder (to the farmer's heirs) would pass. But then, the farmer is dead, so the remainder would pass to the farmer's heirs, which would include their own heirs. That seems a bit complicated.

Wait, but the original conveyance to the cousin was a life estate plus a remainder to the heirs. So when the cousin conveys to the farmer, the remainder (to the heirs) is transferred to the farmer. So the farmer has a life estate (for life) and a remainder to the farmer's heirs. But the farmer's heirs are the ones who would have the property if he dies. So after the farmer dies, the property would revert to the farmer's heirs. But the issue is, is the farmer in a holding estate or a remainder estate?

Wait, another approach: After the cousin's death, the farmer's life estate ends, but the remainder, which was originally to the heirs, now goes to the farmer's heirs. So the farmer's heirs would get the remainder. But the farmer's heirs are the ones who would, upon his death, have the property. So the farmer's heirs would be the ones to claim in federal estate law, but in common law, the rule is different.

Wait, in common law, a remainder is a future interest that takes effect when the grantee dies. So, if the remainder was to the heirs, and the grantor conveys the remainder to a third party, then the third party gets the remainder. So the farmer now has a remainder to the farmer's heirs. But the farmer's heirs are the ones who would, upon his death, have the property. So the farmer's heirs would be the ones to claim.

Wait, but in the common law, when a remainder is given to a third party, it's a life estate for the grantor's heirs. So if the farmer has a remainder to the farmer's heirs, that would mean the farmer's heirs get the property when he dies. So in this case, the farmer's heirs would be the ones to take the property, but after the farmer's life estate ends. So the farmer is dead, so the remainder passes to the farmer's heirs. But that might be more in the realm of state law, perhaps.

But the case is about common law. So what's the common law doctrine that applies here?

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: Doctrine of Lapse. That's about a person failing to perform their estate, so another estate can be created. Not sure if that's applicable here.

Option B: Doctrine of Life Estate Pur Autre Vie. Not familiar with this. Maybe a variant.

Option C: Doctrine of Worthier Title. That's about priority of interests, like when a person takes a life estate and another takes a remainder, the remainder takes priority. But I'm not sure.

Option D: Rule in Shelley's Case. I think this is a case about when a remainder is transferred to a third party. Shelley's Rule might apply here.

Option E: Doctrine of Destructibility of Contingent Remainders. Not sure.

Option F: Rule against Perpetuities. I'm not sure.

Option G: Doctrine of Merger. Hmm, deals with merging estates.

Option H: Rule in Wild's Case. I'm not certain about this.

Option I: Rule against Remainders in the Grantees' Heirs. Not sure.

Option J: Doctrine of Adverse Possession. That's when the grantor holds the property in a way that it's not free from the remainder.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the transfer of the remainder. The initial conveyance is a life estate (for life) plus a remainder to the heirs. Then the cousin conveys to the farmer a life estate plus the remainder. So the remainder from the original conveyance (to the heirs) is now given to the farmer. So the farmer now has a life estate (for life) and a remainder. But wait, a life estate plus a remainder is a life estate for life plus a remainder. So when the farmer dies, the property should revert to the remainder holder. But who is the remainder holder?

Originally, the remainder was to the heirs. So if the farmer conveys the remainder to himself, then the farmer's heirs would get it when he dies. So the property would revert to the farmer's heirs upon his death.

Wait, but the problem is that the farmer is the one who now owns the property. So does he have a life estate or a remainder? If the remainder was given to himself, then he has a remainder, which would then pass to the farmer's heirs, upon his death. So the property would revert to the farmer's heirs when the farmer dies, meaning the farmer's heirs are the ones to take it. But the question is about the ownership for the court's determination. So the court would determine that the farmer's heirs have the right to take the property.

But under common law, what does the transfer of a remainder to a third party imply? I think in common law, a remainder is to the grantor's heirs. So when the conveyance is made, the remainder is given to the third party, and the third party's heirs take it.

Wait, but in this case, the original remainder was to the heirs of the original owner (homeowner). When the cousin conveys the remainder to the farmer, the farmer's heirs would take it. So the farmer's heirs would be the ones to claim the property.

But wait, the question is about the common law doctrine applicable. So I need to find which doctrine deals with the transfer of the remainder to a third party.

Option D is Rule in Shelley's Case. Shelley's Rule is about when a remainder is transferred from a life estate grantor to a third party, the third party's heirs take the property. So when the remainder is given to another person, that person's heirs get the property.

So in this case, the original conveyance (home to cousin) included a remainder to the heirs. When the cousin conveyed that remainder to the farmer, the farmer's heirs would get it. So under Shelley's Rule, the remainder is given to the farmer, so the farmer's heirs take it.

So the applicable doctrine is D: Rule in Shelley's Case.

Alternatively, I should think about the two main types of remainder principles: life estate plus remainder and the transfer of the remainder to another person. The latter is covered by Shelley's Rule.

Wait, another way: The remainder from the original conveyance (life estate to the heirs) was to the heirs. When the cousin conveyed the remainder to the farmer, the farmer's heirs would get it. So this is Shelley's Rule, where the remainder is transferred to the grantor's heirs, and those heirs take the property.

So the correct answer is D: Rule in Shelley's Case.

The question involves determining the common law doctrine applicable to a property transfer in a common law jurisdiction. The homeowner conveys property to his cousin with a life estate and a remainder to his heirs. The cousin then conveys the property to a farmer with a life estate and the remainder. After the cousin's death, the heirs of the farmer sued the owner. The issue revolves around the transfer of the remainder and the ownership of the property.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Conveyance**: The homeowner's property has a life estate (for life) and a remainder to the heirs.
2. **Cousin's Conveyance**: The cousin conveys the property to the farmer, resulting in a life estate for the farmer and a remainder.
3. **Remainder Transfer**: The remainder from the original conveyance (to the heirs) is transferred to the farmer. According to **Shelley's Rule**, when a remainder is transferred to a third party, the third party's heirs take the property.
4. **Application of Doctrine**: The applicable doctrine is **Rule in Shelley's Case**, which deals with the transfer of remainders to third parties and the subsequent heirs who take the property.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **D: Rule in Shelley's Case**, as it addresses the transfer of the remainder and the subsequent heirs' claim on the property.
