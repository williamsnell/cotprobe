Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about U.S. presidential elections. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is: If no presidential candidate receives a majority of the electoral college votes, who becomes the president? The options are A through J, each a different scenario.

Wait, I remember that the U.S. president is elected by the Electoral College, but there's also a popular vote. Oh right, the Electoral College system is a bit different. So, in theory, you need a majority in the Electoral College to win. But in a real election, it's possible that a candidate doesn't get a majority in the Electoral College, but then how does that affect the president?

Let me go through the options. Option A says the candidate who wins the state with the most electoral votes. That's just part of the electoral college system, not the majority. So if there's a tie or someone doesn't win the state, that's not the president.

Option B mentions the candidate with the second highest number of electoral votes. So if one candidate has a majority, they win, but if not, someone else could win. But the president isn't decided by the second-highest in the Electoral College. I think that's not the case.

Option C: The candidate who wins the most votes in the electoral college. But that doesn't make sense because there are no votes in the electoral college. It's more about the states, not the college. So this can't be right.

Option D: The candidate who wins the majority in the House (the lower house of Congress). I don't think that's the case. The president is elected in the Senate, not the House. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: Whomever is selected by the U.S. Congress. That's about the vice president, not the president. So E is probably not the answer.

Option F: The candidate chosen by a national popular vote after the electoral college deadlock. Hmm, that sounds more like a scenario where the president is chosen by the popular vote in the event of a tie in the Electoral College. So in this case, if no one wins the electoral college, then the president is selected by the popular vote. That sounds correct.

Option G: The incumbent vice president. No, because the president is elected, not the vice president. So G is wrong.

Option H: The incumbent vice president of the United States. No, the president is a separate office, so H is incorrect.

Option I: The candidate who wins the majority in the Senate. Again, that's the vice president's role. So I is wrong.

Option J: Whomever is selected by the Supreme Court. That's about the judiciary, not the election. So J is not the right answer.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about the scenario where no candidate has a majority in the Electoral College. So the president would be decided by the popular vote in that case. That's option F. So the answer should be F.

The correct answer is F. If no presidential candidate receives a majority of the electoral college votes, the president is selected by the national popular vote after the Electoral College deadlock. 

Answer: F
