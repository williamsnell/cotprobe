Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about using Gauss' Law to find the force on a mass placed in a deep hole in the Earth. The force is due to the matter in the spherical portion below the hole. I need to find the force at two depths: 1/4 and 1/2 of the Earth's radius, assuming a constant density.

Alright, let's break this down. Gauss' Law is about the electric flux through a closed surface, which equals the charge enclosed divided by epsilon zero. But wait, this is a gravitational problem. So, for gravity, Gauss' Law would be similar but with mass instead of charge. The gravitational flux through a surface would be equal to the mass enclosed divided by some constant.

So, to apply Gauss' Law, I imagine a spherical Gaussian surface centered at the Earth's center. The mass enclosed by this surface would be the mass of the Earth up to that radius. The gravitational force at the surface would be GMm/r², but when considering a hole, the mass enclosed would be less. Wait, no, because the hole is deep, so the mass is the entire Earth below it. Hmm, no, wait, maybe the hole is at the surface, so the mass enclosed would be the mass of the Earth up to the surface, but that's the total mass. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the setup is that the hole is deep, so the mass is the matter below the hole. So, for a point inside the Earth, the mass enclosed would be the mass of the Earth up to the radius of the hole. But wait, the density is constant. So the mass would be proportional to the volume, which is proportional to the cube of the radius.

Wait, let me think. The Earth's density is constant, so the mass M(r) up to radius r is (density) * (4/3 π r³). So M(r) = k r³, where k is a constant (density * 4/3 pi).

The gravitational force at a depth h is due to the mass M(r) = k r³, where r is the radius of the hole (the Earth's radius at the surface). Wait, but the gravitational force at the surface would be due to the entire Earth's mass, but in this case, the hole is at the surface. So, the mass enclosed is the whole Earth's mass (for a point at the surface, the mass is the total mass, but for a point inside, the enclosed mass is less). Wait, no. Wait, the hole is at the Earth's surface, so the point is on the surface, and the mass enclosed is the total mass M_total. No, wait, no, because the hole is deep, so the point is in the Earth's interior. Hmm, no. Wait, no, the gravitational force at the surface is due to the entire Earth's mass. But if the hole is at the surface, then the point is on the surface, so the mass enclosed would just be M_total. Wait, that can't be right because then the force at the surface would be GMm/r², which is the usual Newtonian gravity. But the question says the force is due to the matter in the spherical portion BELOW the hole. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, another approach: The hole is deep, so when you place a mass in the hole, it's in the Earth's interior. So, the gravitational force there is due to the mass of the Earth, but the mass enclosed by the hole's surface depends on the radius up to which we're measuring. Let me think in terms of the spherical shell theorem. The gravitational force at a point inside a uniform sphere is proportional to the radius from the center. So, for a point at radius r (from the Earth's center), the gravitational acceleration is (g) = (G M) r / R^3, where M is the total mass of the Earth and R is the Earth's radius.

Wait, more precisely, the gravitational acceleration inside a uniform sphere is g(r) = (G M r) / R³, where r is the distance from the center, and M is the total mass of the Earth.

So, for a point inside the Earth at radius r (from the center), the gravitational acceleration is proportional to r. Therefore, the gravitational force on a mass m at radius r would be F = m g(r) = m (G M r) / R^3.

Wait, but the question is about the force at depth h, which is at radius R (the Earth's radius), because the hole is at the surface. So, when the mass is placed at depth h, its position is at a radius r = R from the center. So, the gravitational force is F = (G M m R) / R³ = (G M m) / R², which is the standard Newtonian gravity formula. So, that makes sense because the hole is at the surface, so the force is the same as if it were on the surface, but the question seems to imply that it's due to the matter below the hole. Wait, but if the hole is at the surface, then the mass below the hole is the entire Earth's mass. So the force is due to the entire Earth's mass, but that would be the same as the surface gravity, but the question says that the force is due to the matter in the spherical portion below the hole. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the hole is at the Earth's center, so the point is inside the Earth. Wait, no, the question says the hole is deep in the Earth, so the point is on the surface, so the mass below would be the entire Earth's mass. Because the hole is at the surface, the mass below is all the matter of the Earth. So perhaps the gravitational force is due to the entire Earth's mass. That would mean that the force at any point on the Earth's surface would be (G M m) / R².

But the question says that the force is due to the matter in the spherical portion below the hole. If the hole is at the surface, the spherical portion below the hole is the entire Earth's volume. So, the mass enclosed is the total mass M.

So, in that case, the gravitational force at any point on the Earth's surface would be F = G M m / R².

But wait, in reality, the gravitational force inside the Earth decreases with depth. So, perhaps the question is considering a point at depth h, where h is less than R, so the point is inside the Earth. Then, the mass enclosed would be the mass of the Earth up to that depth. Wait, but the problem states that the density is constant. So, the mass up to a radius r is M(r) = (density) * (4/3 pi r³).

So, for a point at radius r inside the Earth, the mass enclosed is M(r) = ( density ) * (4/3 pi r^3 ). The gravitational acceleration at that point is g(r) = G M(r) / r² = G (density) (4/3 pi r³) / r² = (4/3) G pi rho r.

So, F = m * (4/3 G pi rho r).

Wait, but the density rho of the Earth is M_total / (4/3 pi R³). So, substituting rho = M_total / (4/3 pi R³), then g(r) becomes:

g(r) = (4/3) G pi (M_total / (4/3 pi R³)) r = (G M_total r) / R³.

Which brings us back to the standard expression for g(r) inside a uniform sphere. So, the force on a mass m placed at radius r (from the center) is F = m G M_total r / R³.

Wait, but the question is at two depths: 1/4 of R and 1/2 of R. Let me compute that.

First, calculate for R = 6371 km (I think Earth's radius is about 6371 km). The problem doesn't give the exact radius, but I can proceed with R as a variable.

At depth h = (1/4) R. Wait, but is the depth h from the surface or from the center? Because the problem says the hole is deep in the Earth, so the point is on the surface, so the depth is h = R - r, where r is the radius from the center. Hmm, that's getting confusing. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the depth is h, which is the distance from the surface. So, the point is at radius r = R - h from the center. So, for h = R/4, r = 3R/4. Then, the mass enclosed is M(r) = (density) (4/3 pi r³) = (density) (4/3 pi (3 R/4)^3).

Wait, but the total mass M_total is (density) (4/3 pi R^3). So M(r) = (3/4)^3 M_total.

Wait no, because (3 R/4)^3 is (27 R³ / 64 ) → 27/64 M_total.

So, M(r) = 27/64 M_total.

Then, the gravitational acceleration is g(r) = G M(r) / r².

Wait, r is 3R/4. So, g(r) = G (27/64 M_total) / ( (3R/4)^2 ).

Wait, let's compute that.

Denominator is (3R/4)^2 = 9 R² / 16.

So, g(r) = G (27 M_total / 64 ) / (9 R² / 16 ) = G (27 M_total / 64 ) * (16 / 9 R² ) = G ( (27 * 16) / (64 * 9) ) (M_total / R² ).

Simplify the factors: 27 /9 =3; 16/64=1/4.

So, 3 * (1/4) = 3/4.

So, g(r) = (3/4) G M_total / R².

But (G M_total / R² ) is the acceleration at the surface, which is g_earth. G M_total / R² = g_earth ≈ 9.81 m/s².

So, g(r) = (3/4) g_earth.

Then, F = m g(r) = m * 3/4 g_earth.

At m =1 kg, F = 3/4 * 9.81 N ≈ 7.3575 N.

So, that's approximately 7.36 N. Looking at the options, option H is 6.00 and 4.00. Option G is 8.45 and 5.5. Hmm, none of the options match 7.36. Wait, perhaps I did a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute this without substituting g_earth, but using the exact formula.

Wait, let's rederive. The gravitational acceleration at a radius r from the center in a uniform sphere is g(r) = (G M(r)) / r².

M(r) is (density) * (4/3 pi r³). So,

g(r) = G * (density) * (4/3 pi r³) / r² = G density (4/3 pi) r.

But density is M_total / (4/3 pi R³), so substituting:

g(r) = [G (M_total) / (4/3 pi R³)] * (4/3 pi r) ) = (G M_total r) / R³.

So, for r = 3R/4,

g(r) = (G M_total * 3R/4) / R³ = (3 G M_total) / (4 R²).

g_earth is G M_total / R² = 9.81 m/s².

So,

g(r) = (3/4) g_earth.

So, F = m * (3/4) g_earth.

At 1 kg, F = 1 * (3/4)*9.81 ≈ 7.3575 N.

Looking at the options, option H says 6.00 and 4.00, which isn't near 7.36. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the point is on the surface. Wait, perhaps the hole is at the center, not the surface.

Wait, the problem says the hole is deep in the Earth, which implies that the point is on the surface. Because if it's deep in the center, the point is inside the Earth. So, the force would be due to the mass within that radius.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption of the radius. Let me re-express everything in terms of R.

At depth h, the point is at radius r = R - h from the center. But perhaps the question is considering the depth as h from the surface, so r = R - h.

Wait, no, the problem says the hole is deep in the Earth, so the point is on the surface. So, r = R.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for r = R, the mass enclosed is M_total, leading to F = G M_total R / R³ = G M_total / R² = g_earth. But that's only the case if the hole is at the center. Wait, no, wait. If the hole is at the center, the point is inside the Earth, so the mass enclosed is M(r) = (density) * (4/3 pi r^3) and the gravitational acceleration at that point is (G M(r) ) / r².

Wait, in that case, if the hole is at the center, and the point is at radius r (from center), then M(r) is (density) * (4/3 pi r^3).

g(r) = (G M(r) ) / r² = G (density) * (4/3 pi r^3) / r² = G (density) * (4/3 pi r) = (G * density) * (4/3 pi r).

But density is M_total / (4/3 pi R³), so,

g(r) = G (M_total / (4/3 pi R³) ) * (4/3 pi r ) = (G M_total r ) / R³.

Which again gives the same expression as before.

So, for r = R,

g(R) = (G M_total R ) / R³ = G M_total / R² = g_earth.

Wait, but that's the same as the surface gravity. So, that would suggest that if the hole is at the center, the force at the surface is the same as if the hole were at the surface. So, that's the standard situation. But that doesn't make sense because if the hole is at the center, the point is inside, and the mass enclosed is less.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about whether the hole is at the center or the surface. Let me re-examine the problem statement: "the hole is deep in the Earth". That suggests that the hole is at the surface, so the point is on the surface. Hence, the mass enclosed is the total mass M_total. So, the gravitational force is g_earth * m.

Wait, but then why is the question about the force being due to the matter in the spherical portion BELOW the hole? Because if the hole is at the surface, the matter below the hole is all the Earth's mass. So, the force is due to the entire Earth's mass, which at the surface is F = m g_earth.

But the problem says to find the force on 1 kg at a depth of 1/4 and 1/2 R. So, that would imply that the point is at radius r = R - h, where h is the depth. But h is the depth from the surface, so r = R - h.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem as placing a mass m at a point inside the Earth, at a depth h (so radius r = R - h). But the question says "at a depth of 1/4 and 1/2 R". So, h = R/4 and h = R/2.

Wait, no. If h is the depth from the surface, then r = R - h.

So, for h = R/4, r = 3R/4.

For h = R/2, r = R/2.

Then, as before, the gravitational acceleration at that radius is g(r) = (G M_total r ) / R^3.

So, let's compute that for r = 3R/4 and r = R/2.

Compute F = m * g(r).

m = 1 kg.

Case 1: r = 3R/4.

g(r) = (G M_total * 3R/4 ) / R^3 = (3 G M_total) / (4 R^2) = 3/4 g_earth.

So, F = 1 * (3/4) * 9.81 ≈ 7.3575 N.

Case 2: r = R/2.

g(r) = (G M_total * R/2 ) / R^3 = (G M_total) / (2 R^2) = (1/2) g_earth.

F = 1 * (1/2) * 9.81 ≈ 4.905 N.

Wait, but the options provided don't have 7.36 or 4.905 as the F values. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 5.95, 3.7

B: 6.25, 3.9

C: 6.75, 4.2

D: 7.35, 4.9

E: 8.00, 5.8

F: 7.85, 5.1

G: 8.45, 5.5

H: 6.00, 4.00

I: 9.81, 6.45

J: 5.65, 3.35

K: 7.85, 5.1

Wait, the 7.3575 is approximately 7.36, which is close to option D's first value (7.35). But option D's F values are 7.35 and 4.905.

Wait, but I'm getting F = 7.3575 for the first case and 4.905 for the second case. Looking at the options, option D has F values of 7.35 and 4.905.

Wait, but in option D, the second value is 4.905. So, the F values for the two depths would be approximately 7.36 and 4.91.

Looking at the options, the closest match is option D, which lists 7.35 and 4.905. So, option D is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me compute the exact values to see if the options match.

Wait, for r = 3R/4:

g(r) = (G M_total * 3R/4 ) / R^3 = (3 G M_total) / (4 R²).

g_earth = G M_total / R² = 9.81 m/s².

So,

g(r) = (3/4) * 9.81 = 7.3575 m/s².

F = 1 kg * 7.3575 = 7.3575 N.

Similarly, for r = R/2:

g(r) = (G M_total * R/2 ) / R³ = (G M_total) / (2 R²) = (1/2) * 9.81 = 4.905 m/s².

F = 4.905 N.

Looking at the options, none directly have 7.3575 and 4.905. Wait, option D has 7.35 and 4.905. Hmm, but 7.35 is approximate to 7.3575, while 4.905 is exact to 4.905. So, the answer is D.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I get confused with the radii.

Wait, for the first case, r = 3R/4.

g(r) = (G M_total * 3R/4 ) / R^3 = (3 G M_total) / (4 R²).

But M_total = (density) * (4/3 pi R^3).

So, substituting,

g(r) = (3 G (density) (4/3 pi R^3 )) ) / (4 R² )

Simplify:

The 3 and 4 cancel. (4/3 * 3) =4, and (4/3 * 3) =4, but wait, 3 and 4 would cancel with the denominator.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the expression for g(r):

g(r) = (G M_total r) / R^3.

So, M_total is (density) * (4/3 pi R^3).

So,

g(r) = [G (density) (4/3 pi R^3) r ] / R^3.

Simplify:

The R^3 cancels, so we have:

g(r) = G (density) (4/3 pi r) = (4/3 pi G density) r.

But density is M_total / (4/3 pi R^3).

So,

g(r) = (4/3 pi G (M_total / (4/3 pi R^3 )) ) r.

Simplify:

(4/3 pi G M_total r) / (4/3 pi R^3 ) → (G M_total r ) / R^3.

Which brings us back to the same formula.

So, for r =3R/4,

g(r) = (3/4) g_earth.

Thus, F = (3/4) * 9.81 ≈ 7.3575 N.

Similarly, for r = R/2,

g(r) = (1/2) g_earth.

So, F = 4.905 N.

Looking for the option that matches these values.

The options are:

D: 7.35 and 4.905.

So, option D is the correct answer.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the gravitational force at two depths within the Earth. The gravitational force inside a uniform sphere is given by:

\[
F = \frac{G M(r) r}{R^3},
\]

where \(M(r)\) is the mass enclosed at a radius \(r\), \(R\) is the Earth's radius, and \(G\) is the gravitational constant. For a uniform sphere, \(M(r) = \rho \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\), where \(\rho\) is the density. Substituting \(M(r)\) into the formula for \(F\), we get:

\[
F = \frac{G \rho \frac{4}{3} \pi r^4}{R^3}.
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
F = \frac{G M(r)}{r^2} = \frac{G \rho \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{r^2} = \frac{4}{3} G \rho r.
\]

Since the density \(\rho = \frac{M_{\text{total}}}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3}\), the gravitational acceleration at the surface is:

\[
g_{\text{earth}} = \frac{G M_{\text{total}}}{R^2}.
\]

Substituting this into the expression for \(F\), we find:

\[
F = \frac{G M_{\text{total}} r}{R^3} = \frac{M_{\text{total}}}{R^2} \cdot \frac{G M_{\text{total}} r}{M_{\text{total}}} \cdot \frac{G M_{\text{total}} r}{R^3}.
\]

Simplifying further, we get:

\[
F = \frac{G M_{\text{total}} r}{R^3} = \frac{G M_{\text{total}}}{R^2} \cdot \frac{r}{R}.
\]

Since \(\frac{G M_{\text{total}}}{R^2} = g_{\text{earth}}\), we have:

\[
F = g_{\text{earth}} \cdot \frac{r}{R}.
\]

For the two cases:
1. **Depth \(h = \frac{R}{4}\)**: The radius from the center is \(r = R - h = \frac{3R}{4}\).  
   \[
   F = g_{\text{earth}} \cdot \frac{3R/4}{R} = g_{\text{earth}} \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
   \]

2. **Depth \(h = \frac{R}{2}\)**: The radius from the center is \(r = R - h = \frac{R}{2}\).  
   \[
   F = g_{\text{earth}} \cdot \frac{R/2}{R} = g_{\text{earth}} \cdot \frac{1}{2}.
   \]

Using \(g_{\text{earth}} = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2\):
1. \(F = 9.81 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = 7.3575 \, \text{N}\).  
2. \(F = 9.81 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 4.905 \, \text{N}\).

Comparing these results with the given options, the correct answer is **D: 7.35 and 4.905**.

ANSWER: D
