Question:

Briefly trace historical attitudes toward human development emphasizing the debate between biological determinism and environmental determinism.

Options:

A: Both endogenous (biological) and environmental factors are recognized as essential in human development.
B: Development is solely determined by biological factors.
C: Environmental factors shape development until adolescence, after which biology takes over completely.
D: Biological factors set the potential for development, which is then unchangeable by environmental influences.
E: Human development is a random process, not influenced by either biological or environmental factors.
F: Human development is exclusively the result of personal choices, independent of biology or environment.
G: Human development is predetermined at birth, with no influence from life experiences.
H: Human development is entirely influenced by the environment.
I: Development is solely determined by social interactions, with no biological influence.
J: Children are innately evil and need to redeem themselves.

Okay, so I have this question about historical attitudes toward human development, specifically about whether biological determinism or environmental determinism is more prevalent. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question asks me to briefly trace the debate between biological determinism and environmental determinism. The options are A to J. I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should remember what each term means. Biological determinism is the idea that human characteristics, such as physical traits, are determined by biological processes. Environmental determinism suggests that a person's development is influenced by their surroundings, like education, culture, and environment.

I think this debate goes back to the 20th century. I remember something about scientists like John Dewey and others. Dewey, I think, was a proponent of environmental determinism. He talked about how children's experiences shape their development. Before that, people might think that genes and heredity play a big role, so biological determinism was more common.

Wait, what about the 1950s? I think that's when Dewey's ideas were formalized. He wrote about how education and life experiences affect development. So, he was against biological determinism, right? He believed that the environment is more important because it's what you're exposed to.

On the other hand, people like John Bouldin and others in the 1930s might have been more in line with biological determinism. They suggested that genes and biology are key factors. But then again, I think Dewey's arguments were stronger, especially in the context of education and personal experiences.

So the debate mainly took shape in the mid-20th century. The options given are A to J. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Both are essential. That doesn't sound right because the debate is about which is more dominant.

Option B: Development solely by biology. That would be more like biological determinism. But that's a strong statement.

Option C: Environmental until adolescence. Hmm, some theories suggest that child development is more influenced by environment, especially before adolescence. But I'm not sure if this is the main point of debate.

Option D: Biological factors set the potential, which is unchangeable by environment. So the environment doesn't affect biological outcomes. That seems a bit too simplistic, because I think environmental factors can influence biological processes.

Option E: Random process. That's more of a modern concept, maybe starting with probabilistic views, but the debate wasn't about randomness.

Option F: Human development is entirely personal, independent of biology or environment. That sounds more like environmental determinism, as people think they can change based on their environment.

Option G: Determined at birth. I'm not sure about this. I don't think any major theories suggest that development is predetermined from birth, but some might say that genetics do influence potential, so maybe this isn't the right view.

Option H: Environmentally influenced. That sounds like environmental determinism.

Option I: Social interactions. Social influence might play a role, but that's more about how society affects development, not necessarily an environmental determinant.

Option J: Children are evil and need to redeem themselves. That's a belief system, not part of a debate in determinism.

So I think the main debate was around whether environment or biology was more influential. I remember that Dewey and others were early adopters of environmental determinism. So the answer would be about environmental factors shaping development, especially until some point.

Looking at the options, which one fits that. Option C says environmental factors shape until adolescence. So that's a point from Dewey's workâ€”maybe that's a key aspect of the debate.

Option B is too strong about biology. Option H is environmental. Option D is about biological being fixed by environment. Option F is about personal choice.

Wait, the question says "trace historical attitudes," so I'm more interested in the historical perspective of the debate.

So, the answer should be about environmental determinism being more prevalent than biological. So which option reflects that?

Option C says environment factors until adolescence. That seems to align with what I remember. So the correct answer would be C.

The debate between biological determinism and environmental determinism centers on understanding whether biological processes or environmental influences shape human development. The key historical perspective, particularly from the mid-20th century, aligns more with environmental determinism, as argued by figures like John Dewey. He emphasized that personal experiences, education, and life experiences significantly influence development. While biological determinism suggests genes and biology are crucial, environmental determinism posits that experiences are the primary drivers. 

Analyzing the options, the most fitting choice is **C: Environmental factors shape development until adolescence, after which biology takes over completely.** This reflects the belief that environmental influences are more influential, especially before adolescence, supporting the idea that environmental determinism is dominant in this context.

**ANSWER: C**
