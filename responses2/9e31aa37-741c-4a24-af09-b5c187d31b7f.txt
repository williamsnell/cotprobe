Okay, so I have this question about legal arguments, specifically regarding a person's case where they were charged with possession of opium. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The person, Tan Ah Tiat, is 49 years old and from Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia. He was charged with possession, but he's arguing for acquittal. His main points are that his habit doesn't harm him because he's too old to work, and he says he lives from his grandmother's earnings.

Hmm, so I need to figure out what legal principle this situation illustrates. The options are Straw Man, False Dilemma, Inconsistency, and Appeal to Authority.

Alright, let's think about each option. 

Straw Man is when someone misrepresents their case to make it easier for the judge to accept. So, if someone presents a completely different angle that doesn't relate to the actual issue, they might use a straw man. But in this case, the argument is about his age and living from his grandmother, which is directly related to the possession charge. So maybe not straw man.

False Dilemma is when someone presents a situation that has four or more options, making it seem like a binary choice, but actually, the correct choice isn't presented. The person here isn't making a binary choice; he's making a straightforward argument. So probably not False Dilemma.

Inconsistency refers to a situation where the evidence presented contradicts itself. Here, the evidence is that he's too old to work, and he lives from his grandmother. That doesn't seem inconsistent. So maybe not Inconsistency.

Apple to Authority is when someone presents evidence that supports a viewpoint by pointing to authority figures, but the evidence isn't directly related. Here, the argument is about living from his grandmother, which is a personal fact, not relying on authority. So perhaps not.

Wait, but the argument is that his age doesn't harm him, which is a correct statement. So he's using evidence to support his case without directly addressing the charge, which is similar to an Appeal to Authority. Because he's using the fact that his grandmother's income supports his case, relying on external authority (the grandmother's funds) to argue that his age doesn't matter.

So the correct answer should be D: Appeal to Authority.

The argument presented by Tan Ah Tiat uses his grandmother's earnings to support the charge that his age doesn't harm his opium habit. This is an example of using external authority to convince the judge of his case, aligning with the Appeal to Authority principle.

Answer: D
