Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa."
Walter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974
Rodney's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?

Options:

A: The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers
B: The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World
C: The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa
D: The importation of New World products into Africa

Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. The question is about Walter Rodney's passage and which historical development it's responding to between the 1450-1750 CE period. Okay, let me break it down.

So, the passage says that the operation of the imperialist system caused African underdevelopment. It mentions that the economic retardation was due to draining African wealth and making it hard for the continent to develop more. Then it refers to the capitalists of Western Europe extending their exploitation from inside Europe to cover all of Africa. That part seems to be about imperialism affecting the continent.

Now, the question is asking which of the four options this argument is responding to. The options are about European colonization, African diaspora expansion, Christianity spreading, or importing new products.

I remember that during the 1450s to 1750s, Europe was involved in colonialism. The main European colonizers were the Dutch, Portuguese, English, and others. The passages in the question are likely discussing European colonization of Africa. So, the argument here is probably responding to the European colonization of Africa.

Option A says the colonization of Africa by European powers, which aligns with the passage's focus on how the imperialist system (colonialism) affects Africa. The passage compares the economic issues caused by European expansion, implying that this is a response to the colonization.

Options B and C don't seem directly related. The expansion of the African diaspora would be more about African migration, not colonization. Christianity's spread was a separate topic, but the passage is specifically about economic factors, which ties back to the colonialist system.

Option D is about importing products, which was a different issue. The passage is talking about economic factors, not importation. So, D isn't the correct response.

So, the passage's argument is likely responding to the concept that European colonization of Africa was the cause of Africa's underdevelopment. Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.

The passage's argument about African underdevelopment due to European expansion is most likely responding to the concept of European colonization of Africa, as detailed in option A.
