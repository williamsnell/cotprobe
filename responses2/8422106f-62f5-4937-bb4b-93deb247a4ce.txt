Okay, so I have this question here asking which option doesn't contain oxygen. The options are A to G, each describing a different compound. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, so I'll need to think through each one carefully.

Let me go through them one by one. 

Option A: An alcohol. I remember that alcohols have the -OH group attached to a carbon chain. So definitely contains oxygen.

Option B: An ether. Ether groups are like O connecting two carbons, right? So O is definitely present.

Option C: An amide. Amides have the structure RCONR2, so the nitrogen is attached to oxygen. So oxygen is present here.

Option D: An aldehyde. Aldehydes have a CHO group attached to a carbon. The oxygen is in the aldehyde group (CHO). So oxygen is there.

Option E: An alkane. Alkanes are hydrocarbons with only single bonds. No oxygen, just C and H. So this one definitely doesn't have any oxygen.

Wait, but let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option F: A ketone. Ketones have the structure RCOR', so the carbonyl group (C=O). The oxygen is present here too.

Option G: An ester. Esters have the structure RCOOR'. The carbonyl is a C=O, so oxygen is there.

So the question is which one doesn't have oxygen. E (an alkane) is the only one without oxygen. So the correct answer should be E, but wait, looking back at the options, option E is 'an alkane' which doesn't have oxygen. So the answer is E.

The correct answer is E: An alkane. Alkanes are hydrocarbons with only single bonds and do not contain oxygen. The other options all contain oxygen in some form (alcohols, ethers, amides, aldehydes, ketones, or esters). 

Answer: E
