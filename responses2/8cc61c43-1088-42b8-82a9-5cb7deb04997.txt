Okay, so I've got this question about instruments and measurement. I'm a bit rusty on some of these terms, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the smallest change in the measured variable that an instrument will respond to. The options are calibration, sensitivity, resolution, repeatability, linearity, precision, accuracy, scale, range, and reliability.

Let me break this down. I remember that when it comes to instruments, sensitivity is often mentioned. Sensitivity refers to how much a device responds to a change in input. So, the smallest change it can detect. That sounds like it's directly related to the smallest change possible.

Wait, what about linearity? Linearity is about how proportional the output is to the input over a range. If it's not linear, the change might not be proportional, but linearity deals with the accuracy of the linearity, not the smallest change it responds to. So linearity might be a factor in how well the instrument can handle a certain range, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's the smallest change it detects.

Sensitivity is the same thing as the ability to detect a change. Another term that comes to mind is resolution. Resolution relates to the smallest measurement the instrument can make. But the question is about the smallest change it responds to, not the smallest measurement it can display.

Wait, let me think again. The term I'm looking for is sensitivity, which is the degree to which the instrument's output changes in response to a change in the input. So the smallest change in the input would correspond to the smallest change in the output, which is sensitivity. So the answer should be B: sensitivity.

Other terms: calibration is about adjusting the instrument, so it's more about accuracy and correctness. Repeatability is about the consistency of measurements, so that's about the instrument's ability to give the same result. Linearity is about the linearity of the response. Precision refers to how consistent measurements are, like the accuracy of repeated measurements. Accuracy is how close the measured value is to the true value. Scale might refer to the range of the instrument, like the maximum and minimum values it can measure.

Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. So the smallest change in the measured variable would be the minimal change the instrument can detect, which is sensitivity, option B.

The correct answer is **B: sensitivity**. Sensitivity refers to the smallest change in the measured variable that an instrument can detect. 

Answer: B
