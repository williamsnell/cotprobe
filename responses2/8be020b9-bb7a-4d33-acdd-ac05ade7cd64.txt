Okay, let's see. I have this question about linear functions. Hmm, the question says that f is a linear function with a nonzero slope. So, f is a straight line, right? And the slope isn't zero, so it's either increasing or decreasing. 

The question is asking which option must be false. The options are A through G. Let me think, since it's a linear function with a nonzero slope, it's either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. So, for any two points, if one has a higher x-value, the function's output will also be higher if it's increasing, or lower if it's decreasing.

Now, the options involve comparing f(d) and f(c) where c < d. So, c is less than d, and we're looking at their function values. Since the function is linear and has a nonzero slope, it must be either increasing or decreasing. 

Let me break down each option:

A: f(d) > f(c) — This would be true if the function is increasing because as c < d, f(c) would be less than f(d). But what if it's decreasing? Then f(d) would be less than f(c), so A would be false.

B: f(c) < f(d) — That would be true if the function is increasing because c < d implies f(c) < f(d). But if it's decreasing, then f(c) would be greater than f(d), so B would be false.

C: f(d) ≠ f(c) — Since c is less than d and the function is linear (and has a nonzero slope), the function can't have the same value at two different points unless the slope is zero, which it isn't. So f(d) must not equal f(c). So C is always true, so it can't be the answer because the question asks which must be false.

D: f(c) = f(d) — Well, this can't happen because the function's slope is not zero. If the slope were zero, the function would be flat, but here it's not. So D is never true, which would mean D must be false. However, let me check the other options to see if any are also false.

E: f(d) < f(c) — This would happen only if the function is decreasing. So E can be true or false depending on the function, meaning it's not necessarily false.

F: f(c) ≠ f(d) — As I thought before, this must be true because the function can't have the same value at two different points unless the slope is zero, which it isn't. So F is always true.

G: f(c) > f(d) — This would be true if the function is decreasing. So G can be true or false depending on slope.

So which options must be false? The options that are always false. 

Looking at the options, A says f(d) > f(c), which is true if the function is increasing. But if the function is decreasing, A would be false. So A is not always false, it depends on the function.

Option B is true if the function is increasing, but false if it's decreasing. So B can be false.

Wait, but the question is which must be false. So let's see which of the options is always false.

Wait, the question is, which of the options must be false. So, which of the options can't happen?

Option C is f(d) ≠ f(c). But since the function is linear and has non-zero slope, f(d) must be different from f(c) because d ≠ c. So C is always true; it can't be false. So C is not the answer.

Option D: f(c) = f(d). But since the slope is non-zero, this can't happen. So D must be false.

Wait, but the question is which must be false. So that's a possibility.

Let me recheck the options:

The options are about which must be False. So for each option, is it necessarily false?

A: f(d) > f(c). Can it be false? Yes. If function is decreasing, A is false. So A can be false.

B: f(c) < f(d). This must be true if function is increasing. But can it be false? If function is decreasing, B is false. So B can be false.

C: f(d) ≠ f(c). Always true because d ≠ c and slope is non-zero. So C is always true, so it's not the answer.

D: f(c) = f(d). Can't happen. So D must be false.

E: f(d) < f(c). This is true if function is decreasing. So E can be true or false, sometimes true, but not always. But since it can be true or false, it's not necessarily false.

F: f(c) ≠ f(d). Always true. So F can't be the answer.

G: f(c) > f(d). True if function is decreasing, false if increasing. So G can be true or false, so it's not necessarily always false.

So the options that must be false are B, D. Wait, but the question asks which must be FALSE. So both B and D could be false depending on the function. But the question is which option must be false, meaning which one is necessarily false.

Wait, the question is which of the options must be false. So which of these cannot be true.

Wait, let me think again. For any linear function with non-zero slope where c < d, which of the following must be false.

Let's consider all options:

A: f(d) > f(c) — True if function is increasing.

B: f(c) < f(d) — True if function is increasing.

C: f(d) ≠ f(c) — Always true.

D: f(c) = f(d) — Impossible. So D is always false.

E: f(d) < f(c) — True if function is decreasing.

F: f(c) ≠ f(d) — Always true.

G: f(c) > f(d) — True if function is decreasing.

So the only option that must be false is D. Because the function can't have f(c) = f(d) since the slope is non-zero. So D is the correct answer.

The question asks which option must be false for a linear function \( f \) with a nonzero slope, given \( c < d \). 

Since \( f \) is linear and has a nonzero slope, it is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. This means:
- If \( f \) is increasing, \( f(c) < f(d) \) (so options A and B are true).
- If \( f \) is decreasing, \( f(c) > f(d) \) (so options E and G are true).

Options C and F are always true because \( c \neq d \) and \( f \) is not constant (nonzero slope). 

However, option D, \( f(c) = f(d) \), is impossible because a nonzero slope ensures \( f \) outputs are different for different inputs. Thus, D must be false.
