Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Adam Smith and Ricardo's theories on free trade. I need to figure out which option correctly answers how Ricardo modified Smith's ideas. Let me start by recalling what I know about their contributions to economics.

Adam Smith, I remember, wrote "The Theory of Self-Value," which is often referred to as the first modern economic textbook. He argued for free trade because it would lead to economic efficiency. Free trade would allow countries to specialize in producing goods where they have the lowest opportunity cost, leading to gains in all parties involved, right? So Smith's main point was that free trade would lead to more efficient use of resources and lower prices for everyone.

Ricard came later, though. His work is often called "The Theory of International Trade." I think Ricardo was critical of free trade theories, especially those that relied on comparative advantage rather than absolute advantage. Oh wait, yes, Ricardo introduced the concept of comparative advantage. 

Comparative advantage is the idea that each country should specialize in producing the good for which it has the lowest opportunity cost. So if two countries have different production possibilities, each will choose the good they can produce more efficiently. This leads to a more efficient global economy because each country focuses on what they're good at, even if one country is worse off in absolute terms.

So Smith's theory was about absolute advantage, which is the idea that one country can produce a good more efficiently than another. For example, if Country A can produce 100 units of good X with resources A, and Country B can do 50 units with the same resources, then Country B has absolute advantage. But Ricardo's theory was about comparative advantage, where each country focuses on what they're better at, even if it's not the most efficient globally.

So the question is, how did Ricardo modify Smith's theory? Ricardo's main modification was the introduction of comparative advantage, not absolute advantage. So looking at the options:

Options:
A: Ricardo suggested that goods should be produced in countries with the highest demand.
Hmm, that doesn't seem related. Ricardo was more about production costs and opportunity costs.

B: Ricardo argued for self-sufficiency instead of free trade. I don't think Ricardo was advocating for self-sufficiency. He was against it, but it's possible he still had ideas about self-sufficiency.

C: Ricardo opposed free trade. Well, Ricardo was against free trade in general, but I think he did support some forms. Like, he was against the idea that countries should engage in free trade as a means of self-sufficiency, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

D: Ricardo introduced the concept of Absolute Advantage. No, Ricardo was about comparative advantage, not absolute. Absolute advantage is more Smith's idea.

E: Ricardo supported Adam Smith's theory. No, Ricardo was against free trade, which Smith was promoting, so Ricardo didn't support Smith.

F: Ricardo emphasized the role of international tariffs in enhancing trade efficiency. I don't think Ricardo's work was about tariffs. He was more about trade based on comparative advantage.

G: Ricardo formulated the Law of Comparative Advantage. Oh, I think that's correct. Ricardo did develop the concept of Comparative Advantage, which led to the modern theory of comparative and absolute advantage.

H: Ricardo believed trade should be based on technological advancement. I don't think Ricardo was about technological aspects. His main focus was comparative advantage.

I: Ricardo proposed that trade should only occur between countries with similar production costs. That sounds like absolute advantage, but I'm not certain. Ricardo's initial theory was about absolute advantage.

J: Ricardo believed in the principle of highest cost production. I don't recall that being Ricardo's main point.

So the correct answer should be G: Ricardo formulated the Law of Comparative Advantage.

Ricard introduced the concept of Comparative Advantage, which modifies Smith's theory of free trade. Ricardo argued that countries should specialize in producing goods they have the lowest opportunity cost in, rather than claiming absolute advantage. This led to a more efficient global economy through the Law of Comparative Advantage.

Answer: G
