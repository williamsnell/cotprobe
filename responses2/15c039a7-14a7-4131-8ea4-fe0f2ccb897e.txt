Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is: If the velocity of light is assumed to be 3 × 10^8 m/sec, how much time does it take the light to travel through a distance of 30 cm? The options are A through J, with varying time options.

Hmm, I remember that time is calculated by dividing distance by speed. Oh wait, right! The formula is time equals distance divided by speed. So t = d / v.

First, I need to make sure all the units are consistent. The velocity is given in meters per second, and the distance is in centimeters. Oh right, I should convert cm to meters because the velocity is in meters. So 30 cm is 0.3 meters because 1 meter is 100 centimeters. So 30 divided by 100 is 0.3 meters.

So the distance d is 0.3 meters, velocity v is 3e8 m/s.

Now plug them into the formula: t = 0.3 / (3e8). Let me compute that.

0.3 divided by 3 is 0.1. Then 1e8 is 100 million. So 0.1 / 1e8 equals 1e-9 seconds. Because 0.1 is 1e-1. So 1e-1 / 1e8 is 1e-9. So t is 1e-9 seconds.

Wait, 1e-9 seconds is a picosecond. But the options are all in nanoseconds. Oh wait, I remember that 1 nanosecond is 1e-9, no, wait wait: no, 1e-9 seconds is a nanosecond. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. 1 second is 1e9 nanoseconds. So 1e-9 seconds is 1 nanosecond. Oh wait, that makes sense: 1e-9 is 1 ng. So t is 1 nanosecond.

But wait, looking at the options, option J is 1 nanosecond. But wait, the options given are A:2, B:10, etc. So why isn't the answer 1 ns?

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Distance is 30 cm, which is 0.3 meters. Speed is 3e8 m/s.

t = 0.3 / 3e8. Let's compute it step by step. 0.3 divided by 3 is 0.1. So 0.1 divided by 1e8 is 0.1e-8, which is 1e-9 seconds. Oh wait, 1e-9 is 1 nanosecond. So the correct answer should be J: 1 nanosecond.

But wait, looking at the options, option J is 1 nanosecond, which is what I calculated. So why am I having a conflict here? Let me make sure. Oh wait, no. Wait, 0.3 meters divided by 3e8 m/s. So 0.3 / 3e8 = (0.3 / 3) * 1e-8 = 0.1 * 1e-8 = 1e-9, which is 1 ns. So option J is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again: option H is 0.75 nanoseconds. Hmm, maybe I'm missing a step. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the distance. Let me recheck.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the distance in millimeters? Wait, no, the question says 30 cm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I misread the speed. The question states 3e8 m/s. Wait, that's the speed of light. But the calculation seems correct.

Oh wait, perhaps the question meant 3e8 m/s? No, it's correct. So the answer should be 1 ns, which is option J.

Wait, but looking back, the options given are:

A: 2 ns

B:10

C:5

D:0.1

E:1.5

F:0.5

G:0.2

H:0.75

I:3

J:1

So J is 1 ns. So the correct answer must be J:1 nanoseconds.

To determine the time it takes for light to travel 30 cm at a speed of \(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), we use the formula \(t = \frac{d}{v}\). 

First, convert the distance from centimeters to meters:  
\(30 \, \text{cm} = 0.3 \, \text{m}\).

Now calculate the time:  
\[
t = \frac{0.3}{3 \times 10^8} = \frac{0.1}{10^8} = 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{seconds}.
\]

Since \(1 \, \text{nanosecond} = 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{seconds}\), the time is \(1 \, \text{nanosecond}\).

Thus, the correct answer is **J: 1 nanoseconds**.
