Okay, I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. So, the question is about isotopes and their abundances. 

The problem says that an unknown element X has an atomic weight of 210.197 amu and consists of only two isotopes: ^210X and ^212X. The masses of these isotopes are given as 209.64 amu and 211.66 amu respectively. We need to find the relative abundance of these two isotopes.

Hmm, I remember that the atomic weight of an element is the weighted average of the masses of its isotopes, weighted by their relative abundances. So, the formula I think is something like:

Atomic weight = (mass of isotope1 * abundance1) + (mass of isotope2 * abundance2)

Since there are only two isotopes, abundance2 is just 100% minus abundance1. Also, since abundance is a percentage, or a fraction, we can probably switch to decimals for calculation.

Let me denote the abundance of ^210X as 'a' and ^212X as 'b'. So, a + b = 1 (total abundance is 100%). The atomic weight formula becomes:

210.197 = (209.64 * a) + (211.66 * b)

Since a + b =1, I can substitute b with (1 - a). So the equation becomes:

210.197 = 209.64a + 211.66(1 - a)

Let me expand that:

210.197 = 209.64a + 211.66 - 211.66a

Combine like terms:

210.197 = (209.64a - 211.66a) + 211.66

Which simplifies to:

210.197 = (-2.02a) + 211.66

Now, subtract 211.66 from both sides:

210.197 - 211.66 = -2.02a

Calculating the left-hand side:

210.197 minus 211.66... Hmm, 211.66 is bigger, so the result is negative. 210.197 is 1.463 less than 211.66.

Wait, actually, 210.197 is 211.66 minus 1.463. So:

-1.463 = -2.02a

Divide both sides by -2.02:

a = (-1.463) / (-2.02) → 1.463 / 2.02

Let me compute that. 1.463 divided by 2.02. Let's see, 2.02 * 0.7 is 1.414. 1.414 is about 0.7 * 2.02. So 0.7 would give 1.414, which is less than 1.463. How much more?

1.463 - 1.414 = 0.049.

So 2.02 goes into 0.049 how many times? 0.049 / 2.02 ≈ 0.0242.

So approximately 0.7 + 0.0242 = 0.7242, which is 72.42%.

So a is approximately 72.42%, which is the abundance of ^210X. 

Since a + b = 100%, b is 27.58%, which is the abundance of ^212X.

Looking at the options, option C is 72.42%, 27.587%, which matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the relative abundances of the two isotopes, ^210X and ^212X, we use the formula for the atomic weight of an element, which is the weighted average of the masses of its isotopes, weighted by their relative abundances. Let the abundance of ^210X be \( a \) and the abundance of ^212X be \( b \). Since the total abundance is 100%, we have:

\[
a + b = 1
\]

The masses of the isotopes are given as 209.64 amu and 211.66 amu, respectively. Substituting these into the atomic weight formula:

\[
210.197 = (209.64 \cdot a) + (211.66 \cdot b)
\]

Substituting \( b = 1 - a \) into the equation:

\[
210.197 = 209.64a + 211.66(1 - a)
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
210.197 = 209.64a + 211.66 - 211.66a
\]

\[
210.197 = -2.02a + 211.66
\]

Subtracting 211.66 from both sides:

\[
-1.463 = -2.02a
\]

Dividing through by -2.02:

\[
a = \frac{1.463}{2.02} \approx 0.7242
\]

Thus, \( a \approx 72.42\% \), and since \( b = 1 - a \), we find:

\[
b = 1 - 0.7242 = 0.2758 \approx 27.58\%
\]

The relative abundances are therefore 72.42% for ^210X and 27.58% for ^212X. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:
