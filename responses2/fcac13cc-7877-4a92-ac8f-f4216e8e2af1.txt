Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about image restoration strategies. Let me start by reading it carefully.

Louis owns a chemical company that's irresponsible, disposing of chemical waste and contaminating the community's water supply. He knew the company was cutting costs but claims he had no knowledge of the irresponsible practices, blames the company's general manager, and fires him. The question is about the image restoration strategy he's using.

Hmm. I remember that image restoration strategies are methods a person uses to present their image in a way that's positive or positive. There are a few common ones. Let me think about each option.

First, the options given are A to J, each with a different strategy. Let me go through them one by one.

A: Mortification. That's a term I'm not familiar with. I think it might be related to making someone look better, possibly by removing negative attributes. Not sure if that's a standard image strategy.

B: Minimization. That sounds like minimizing the bad aspects. Like, simplifying or reducing the impact of the negatives. Maybe he's making it seem more positive by not highlighting the problems.

C: Reducing the offensiveness. That makes sense. If someone's image has negative parts, reducing the negativity would make their image better. So, in this case, he's probably trying to make his image less offensive because he's blaming the manager and firing, which might make his image more positive.

D: Good intentions. That's more about the person's behavior. He claims to have no knowledge of the irresponsible practices, so maybe his intention is positive. But does that make the image restoration strategy?

E: Attacking the accuser. That would be attacking the manager, which he's doing. So this is related to his behavior, not the image restoration strategy.

F: Corrective action. That's more about taking steps to fix a problem, not about image presentation.

G: Compensation. That's about giving someone a benefit or a penalty, which doesn't directly address image restoration.

H: Boldness. That's about being more bold or direct, not about making the image positive.

I: Denial. He's not telling the truth, but maybe he's denying the responsibility. That could make his image more positive.

J: Evasion of responsibility. That means hiding the problem, which might help in making the image better.

Wait, the question is about image restoration. So the strategy would involve changing the way he presents his image to make it more positive. Looking at the options, B and I are both about minimizing or making positive.

But the options are individual choices. So if he's blaming the manager and firing, that makes his image seem positive. So he's probably trying to minimize the negative aspects. So option B: minimization.

Alternatively, option I is denial, which is more about hiding the problem. Maybe that's a different approach, but the question is about image restoration. So if he's trying to make his image better by minimizing the negative aspects, that would be option B.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: when someone makes a mistake, the image can be damaged. To restore the image, you might reduce the offensiveness, which is what option C says. But in this case, the manager is the one who's responsible for irresponsible practices. So if he's blaming that person, that's a different approach.

Alternatively, the best way to make the image positive is to minimize the negative aspects. So he's probably minimizing the irresponsible practices in his image. So option B.

But wait, another angle: minimizing could include not pointing out the problem but instead focusing on the positive aspects. So in this case, he's probably focusing on how his actions (blaming the manager) are helping him in the image.

Alternatively, reducing offensiveness is a strategy to make someone's image less negative. So if he's blaming the manager, that seems like he's making his image positive, which would involve reducing the offensiveness.

Wait, but the best image restoration strategy is one that makes the image positive, so reducing offensiveness could be a good approach. So I think the correct answer is C: reducing the offensiveness.

Hmm, but wait, the question says he's blaming the general manager and fires him. So maybe he's trying to make his image positive by not showing the problems. So perhaps he's reducing the offensiveness, which is option C.

Alternatively, if he's making it seem positive by minimizing the negative traits, that's option B.

Wait, but another thought: reducing offensiveness is a strategy, but perhaps the best approach is to make him more positive by not pointing out the negative aspects. So maybe he's using option C.

Alternatively, option I is denial, which is about not telling the truth or hiding the problem. So if he's hiding the responsibility by blaming the manager, that's different from just minimizing issues.

Wait, but the question is about image restoration, so the strategy is about how he presents his image. His image is damaged because of irresponsible practices, so he's trying to make it better. So if he makes the image positive by not pointing out the problems, that's reducing offensiveness.

Alternatively, perhaps he's trying to reduce the offensiveness by not highlighting the irresponsible practices. So the correct strategy would be to reduce the offensiveness, which is option C.

Wait, another angle: the question says he's publicly claiming to have no knowledge. So he's blaming the manager. That's a way to make his image positive, perhaps by making it seem like he's not responsible. So the image restoration strategy is to minimize the offensiveness, so option C.

Alternatively, maybe he's not facing any responsibility, so the image is already positive, but that's not the case here. He's firing because he's blaming the manager. So he's not facing any liability, but that's a positive image. So the strategy would be to reduce the offensiveness.

Wait, but the options are a bit different. Let me think about what image restoration strategies are. Image restoration strategies include things like making the image more positive, reducing offensiveness, reducing negativity, etc.

So, in this case, by pointing out that he's blaming the manager and firing, he's probably making the image positive. So he's reducing the offensiveness, which would mean option C.

But then, looking at the options, I think the correct answer is C: reducing the offensiveness. Or maybe another option.

Wait, sometimes people use different terms. Another term is 'making the image positive,' which could be a broader strategy. But the options are specific.

Wait, perhaps the best way to make the image positive is to minimize the negative aspects, which would be option B. But if he's blaming the manager, that's about making the image positive by not pointing out the negative aspects. So perhaps reducing the offensiveness is the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C: reducing the offensiveness.

Wait, I think I need to make a decision here. Let me think about what image restoration refers to. Image restoration is about making the image better, so reducing the negative aspects would be a good strategy. So in this scenario, he's blaming the manager, which is a positive action, so he's reducing the offensiveness. So option C is correct.

Another way: the image restoration strategy would be to make the image more positive by reducing the negative parts. So if he's pointing out the manager's responsibility, then he's reducing the offensiveness. So the answer is C.

The question revolves around Louis's image restoration strategy when he publicly claims to have no knowledge of irresponsible practices, blames the general manager, and fires him. The goal is to determine which strategy he uses to make his image positive.

**Analysis of Options:**

- **A: Mortification** - Not familiar with this term, so likely not the correct choice.
- **B: Minimization** - Refers to reducing negative aspects, which fits as it could apply here by focusing on positive aspects.
- **C: Reducing the offensiveness** - Directly reduces negative traits, which is effective in restoring a positive image.
- **D: Good intentions** - Focuses on actions rather than presenting a positive image.
- **E: Attacking the accuser** - Relates to his behavior, not image restoration.
- **F: Corrective action** - Involves taking steps to fix a problem, not about presentation.
- **G: Compensation** - Related to benefits, not image presentation.
- **H: Boldness** - About making one's image more visible, not directly relevant.
- **I: Denial** - About hiding the problem, which is a different approach.
- **J: Evasion of responsibility** - About hiding the issue, not about making the image positive.

**Conclusion:**
Louis's strategy involves reducing the offensiveness to make his image positive. This aligns with option **C: reducing the offensiveness**.
