Question:

In 1998, a farmer, advancing in age, realizes that he is no longer able to farm his 1,000 acres and therefore decides to sell some of the farmland in parcels of 250 acres. The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the farmer and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the farmer and the development company contains a provision expressly binding "upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns," stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single- family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the farmer's death, his estate isrequired to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The area surrounding phase 1 and phase 2 was rezoned for commercial and industrial uses in 2010. The investor's shopping center has grown to include 150 stores. Now, one of the lot owners in phase 1 contracts to sell his property to two physicians who plan to start a suburban medical practice. In an action by the homeowners in phase 1 to prevent such commercial use by the physicians, the court will most likely hold that

Options:

A: the restrictions are still enforceable, but only for the original buyers from the development company.
B: the restrictions are not enforceable because the investor was able to construct a shopping center on the remaining farmland.
C: the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the offering of personal services (i. e. , medical) would be a conforming use.
D: the restrictions could be enforceable if the court considers the medical practice as a commercial enterprise.
E: the restrictions would no longer be enforceable because the medical practice is considered a necessary service for the community.
F: the restrictions are not enforceable because the surrounding area has been rezoned for commercial and industrial uses.
G: the restrictions are still enforceable, thus preventing such commercial use.
H: the restrictions are not enforceable because they were not mentioned in the deeds to the buyers of phase 2 homes.
I: the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because of the change in the character of the neighborhood.
J: the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the opening of a physician's office in a private home would not be construed as a commercial enterprise.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question. Let me go through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on property law, so I'll need to think carefully about what's happening here.

The scenario involves a farmer selling farmland, a development company, and a contractor. There are these restrictions on the farmland, and the question is about whether those restrictions apply to the subsequent owners or not. Let's break it down.

So, the original deed says something about grantees, heirs, and assigns being bound by it. That part is clear. Then, the development company subdivided two parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and started construction. The original deeds specify that any further subdivisions must be into two-acre lots only. This is the restriction they made, and it's given to the purchasers of phase 1 homes.

Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel to a contractor. The contractor then made a subdivision plan for phase 2, dividing it into one-acre lots. Then, the original deed restrictions were given to the buyers of phase 2 homes. The important point is whether the restrictions apply to the new owners, especially the ones in phase 1 who later sold their land to a contracting company.

The question is about the situation after the farmer's estate sold the remaining 250 acres. The estate is supposed to sell it, and the buyer is an investor looking to build a shopping center. The new land is being used for both medical practices and commercial purposes, which are now rezoned.

The problem is about whether the restrictions apply to the phase 1 owners who sold their land to the contractor. The options are about whether the restrictions are enforceable or not.

First, I think about the concept of "subsequent owners" and whether the initial restrictions apply to them. The original deed explicitly mentions that the restriction is binding upon grantees, their heirs, and assigns. So, the original purchasers (the development company's owners) are bound. But do their heirs, assigns, etc., get affected?

Wait, the question is about the phase 1 owners, who sold their land to a contractor. The contractor is presumably the next grantee, or perhaps they become grantees themselves. But the original deed's restriction was in the original deed, not in the new plans. So, the phase 1 owners sold their land to a contractor, but the original deed (from the development company) had the restriction. The contractor's plan was a new subdivision, but the original restriction is from the original deed.

So, does the contractor's subdivision plan affect the original restriction? I think not directly. The original restriction is in the original deed, and the contractor's plan was a separate matter. Unless the contractor's subdivision plan somehow changes the character of the land, but that's not the case here. The land is still the same.

Wait, but the phase 1 homes' owners (the original phase 1 buyers) sold their land to the contractor. So, the original phase 1 owners sold their land to a contractor, but the original deed includes a restriction on subdivisions for phase 1. So, when a new owner (contractor) buys land, does the original restriction apply to them?

I think the key here is whether the restriction is a "subsequent restriction" or whether it's a "subsequent grant." The original deed's restriction applies to the original grantees, their heirs, and assigns. It's a binding restriction on the original grantees. The contractor is a subsequent grantee of the original deed's restriction, but perhaps the new restriction (from the contractor's subdivision) is different.

Wait, no. The original restriction was in the original deed. It's a contract that applies to the original grantees, their heirs, and assigns. The contractor is a subsequent grantee, but the original restriction is about the original grantees. So, the contractor's subdivision plan is about a new subdivision (phase 2), but the original restriction is still in place on the original phase 1 land.

Wait, but the problem is about the phase 1 owners' ability to use their land. So, the phase 1 owners sold their land to the contractor. The contractor's subdivision plan is for phase 2. But that doesn't affect the original restriction. The original restriction applies to the original owners, but when the contractor buys their land, does that affect the original restriction on the original owners?

I think not, because the original restriction is in the original deed. The contractor's subdivision is a new plan, but the original restriction is a restriction on the original owners' land. So, the original owners' land is still subject to that restriction (two-acre minimum), but the contractor's land is being subdivided into one-acre lots, which is a different restriction.

Wait, but the original restriction is mentioned in the special warranty deeds to the purchasers of phase 1 homes. So, the original buyers (original phase 1 owners) had their land divided into three, four, and five acres. The initial restriction says that any further subdivisions must be two-acre lots only. So, the original phase 1 owners' land was subdivided into three, four, and five. But the original restriction says that any further subdivisions must be two acres. So, perhaps the original phase 1 owners were allowed to have more than two acres.

Wait, the phrasing is a bit confusing. Let me re-express the original restriction. The original deed says: "any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots only." So, it's saying that you can't have subdivisions larger than two acres. So, the original phase 1 owners had a plan to divide their land into 3,4,5 acres, but that's not allowed. So, the original phase 1 owners must have had their land subdivided into two-acre lots only. But wait, the initial restriction was that any subdivision after the original grantees (original owners) must be two acres.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The original restriction is in the original deed; it's a restriction on the original owners' land. So, the original owners had to have their land divided into two-acre lots. So, if they subdivided into three, four, and five, that's not allowed. So, the original phase 1 owners would have had their land divided into two acres only. But the actual division was into 3,4,5, which violates the restriction, but that's not about the phase 1 owners, but about the original phase 1 owners. Now, the phase 1 owners sold their land to the contractor, who proceeded to divide it into one-acre lots.

But the original restriction on the original phase 1 land (after subdivision) is still in place. So, the original phase 1 owners must have their land subdivided into two-acre lots. If they had a three-acre lot, that's over the limit, so that's not allowed. So, the original owners of phase 1 land (the original phase 1 buyers) were allowed to have land subdivided into two-acre lots only. But their original division was into 3,4,5, which is over. So, the original phase 1 owners are not allowed to have their land subdivided into three, four, or five. Therefore, when they sold their land to the contractor, the contractor would have to adhere to the same restriction.

Wait, maybe I need to think about it differently. The original restriction is a restriction on the original owners' land. So, any person who is a subsequent grantee (like the contractor) would have to follow that restriction. So, the contractor's subdivision plan (phase 2) is a new plan, but the original restriction is still in place on the original owners' land. So, the contractor's plan is about phase 2, which is a new subdivision. But the original restriction is still on the original owners' land.

So, does the contractor's plan affect the original owners' right to use their land? The original restriction is a restriction on the original owners' land to have subdivisions of two acres only. So, if the original owners had a subdivision that's not two acres, that's not allowed. But I'm not sure how that affects the contractor's subdivision.

Wait, perhaps the key is that when the original owners sold their land to the contractor, the contractor's subdivision is a new plan. But the original restriction is a restriction on the original owners' land, so the contractor's subdivision is a new plan, not affecting the original restriction.

But the question is about whether the original restrictions apply to the owners of phase 1 who sold their land. The options are about whether the restrictions are still enforceable. The options are about whether the original phase 1 owners' ability to use their land is affected.

Wait, another angle: the original restriction is in the original deed. It's a restriction on the original owners, so the original phase 1 owners are bound by it. But when they sold their land to the contractor, the contractor's subdivision is a new plan, but the original restriction is still in place. So, the contractor's subdivision is about phase 2 land, but the original restriction is about phase 1 land.

Wait, but the options are about whether the original restrictions are enforceable for the phase 1 owners. So, the options are whether the original restrictions are still enforceable, and what that means for the phase 1 owners.

Wait, the question is about whether the original restrictions apply to the phase 1 owners who sold their land to the contractor. The original restriction is in the original deed. So, the original phase 1 owners are the ones bound by the original restriction. But when they sold their land to the contractor, the contractor's subdivision is new. Does that affect the original restriction on the original owners' land?

I think not. The original restriction is about the original owners' land. The contractor's land is a new subdivision, but doesn't change the original restriction's enforceability on the original owners.

Wait, but the options in the question are about whether the restrictions are enforceable. So, for the phase 1 owners, their ability to use their land is affected by the original restriction.

Wait, the options:

A: the restrictions are still enforceable, but only for the original buyers.

B: restrictions not enforceable because investor can build a shopping center.

C: restrictions no longer enforceable because medical use.

D: restrictions enforceable if the court considers medical as commercial.

E: restrictions no longer enforceable because medical is necessary.

F: restrictions not enforceable because area is commercial.

G: restrictions enforceable, so commercial use prevented.

H: restrictions not enforceable because they were not mentioned in phase 2's deeds.

I: restrictions no longer enforceable because of opening of medical practice.

J: restrictions no longer enforceable because a private home's physician's office is not commercial.

Wait, the original restriction is in the original deed. It's a restriction on the original owners. So, phase 1's original owners are bound by it, but when they sell their land to a contractor, can the contractor use the land as per the original restriction?

Wait, no. The original restriction is a restriction on the original owners' land. So, when they sell their land, the contractor can't use that land for subdivisions beyond two acres. So, the contractor's plan is about phase 2, which is allowed. So, the contractor's plan doesn't affect the original restriction.

But wait, another angle: what if the original restriction is part of the original deed's warranty deeds. The original deed, when signed, includes a part (the special warranty deeds) that are given to the purchasers (the original phase 1 owners). So, the original phase 1 owners are the ones under the warranty, and their heirs and assigns are bound by the original restriction.

So, when the original owners sell their land to the contractor, is the contractor allowed to use that land for their own subdivisions? The original restriction applies to the original owners' land, not the contractor's. So, the contractor's phase 2 land is new, and the original restriction is still on the original owners' land.

Wait, but the contractor's subdivision is about phase 2, which is a new subdivision, but the original restriction is about original owners' land. So, the contractor's phase 2 land doesn't affect the original restriction.

But the question is about whether the restrictions apply to the phase 1 owners, who sold their land. So, the restriction is about the original owners, so it's not about the phase 1 owners.

Wait, but the question is about the phase 1 owners. Wait, no. The original restriction is in the original deed, which applies to the original owners. The phase 1 owners are the original owners. So, when they sold their land to the contractor, can the contractor use that land for their own subdivisions?

Wait, perhaps the original restriction is that any further subdivisions must be two acres or less. So, when the original owners sold their land to the contractor, the contractor's subdivision plan for phase 2 is for one-acre lots. Does that mean the contractor is allowed to use their land? Because their land is a new subdivision, not a further subdivision of the original owners' land.

Ah, but the original restriction is about subdivisions made after the original owners. So, if the contractor has a new subdivision (phase 2) that's one acre, which is below the two-acre limit, perhaps that's allowed.

Wait, but the original restriction is a restriction on the original owners' land. So, the original owners cannot have subdivisions beyond two acres. When they sold their land to the contractor, the contractor can't use their land for subdivisions beyond two acres. So, the contractor's phase 2 plan is for one-acre lots, which is allowed.

So, the original restriction applies to the original owners, but does not affect the contractor's plan. Therefore, the contractor can proceed with their plan, and the original restriction doesn't affect the phase 1 owners' ability to use their land.

But the question is about whether the restrictions are enforceable. So, the original restriction is in the original deed, so it's enforceable, and it's a restriction on the original owners' land. The contractor's plan is about their own land, which is a new subdivision. So, the contractor's plan doesn't affect the original restriction.

But wait, the options are about whether the restrictions are still enforceable. So, the answer must be whether the original restriction in the original deed is enforceable.

Looking at option G, which says the restrictions are still enforceable, thus preventing commercial use. But the original restriction is about further subdivisions after the original owners. So, the original owners have to have their land subdivided into two-acre lots only. So, if the original owners subdivided into three, four, or five, that's not allowed. But they sold their land to the contractor, so the contractor is using their land, but the original restriction is about the original owners' land, not the contractor's.

Wait, perhaps the original restriction is a restriction on the original owners' land. So, their land can't be subdivided into three, four, or five. So, the original owners are bound to have their land subdivided into two or less. But when they sold their land to the contractor, the contractor can't use that land for further subdivisions. So, the contractor's phase 2 land is a new subdivision, not a further subdivision of the original owners' land, so the original restriction doesn't affect the contractor's phase 2.

Therefore, the original restriction is enforceable. But how does that affect the phase 1 owners' ability to use their land?

Wait, the options are about whether the restrictions are enforceable for the phase 1 owners. The original restriction is in the original deed, which is the original owners' restriction. So, the original restriction is enforceable, but only for the original owners. So, the phase 1 owners are the original owners, and their restriction applies to them. So, if the original restriction is in the original deed, the phase 1 owners' restriction is enforceable, and it's a restriction on their land. So, the contractor can't use that land for further subdivisions, but the original owners have their original restriction.

So, the options are about whether the original restrictions are enforceable. So, let's look at the options:

Option G: The restrictions are still enforceable, thus preventing commercial use.

Wait, but the original restriction is in the original deed. So, the original owners (phase 1) are the ones under the original restriction. So, the original restriction is enforceable, but for their land.

But the question is about whether the original restriction applies to the phase 1 owners. Because the original restriction is in the original deed, which is signed by the original owners. So, the original restriction is enforceable and applies to the original owners. So, when the phase 1 owners sold their land to the contractor, the contractor is allowed to use their land for their own subdivisions.

Wait, but the contractor's plan is for phase 2, which is a new subdivision, and the original restriction is for the original owners' land. So, the contractor can use their land for their own subdivisions. So, the original restriction's restrictions are only for the original owners' land, not for the contractor's land.

So, the original restriction is enforceable, but it doesn't affect the contractor's phase 2 land. So, the options are about whether the original restriction is enforceable for the phase 1 owners.

Wait, the original restriction is in the original deed, which is signed by the original owners. So, the original restriction is enforceable, but only for the original owners. So, the original owners can't have subdivisions beyond two acres. So, when they sell their land to the contractor, the contractor is allowed to use that land for their own subdivisions. But the original restriction doesn't affect the contractor's land.

So, in this scenario, the original restriction is enforceable, thus preventing any further subdivisions (like phase 2). But the question is about whether the original restriction (from the original deed) is enforceable for the phase 1 owners.

Wait, the original restriction is in the original deed, which is a contract. So, the original owners are bound by it. But the contractor's plan is about phase 2, which is a new subdivision. So, the contractor can use their land for their own subdivisions, but the original restriction is about the original owners' land.

So, the original restriction is enforceable, but it's about the original owners' land. The contractor's land doesn't affect the original restriction. So, the options about whether the original restriction is enforceable.

Looking at the options again:

A: restrictions still enforceable, but only for original buyers.

So, the original restriction is enforceable on the original owners. When they sold their land to the contractor, the contractor is allowed to use that land for their own subdivisions. So, the original restriction doesn't affect the contractor's phase 2 land. The contractor can use their land for any further subdivisions.

So, in this case, the original restriction is still enforceable. If that's the case, then the contractor's phase 2 land is allowed, but the original restriction doesn't affect the phase 1 owners' ability to use their land.

Wait, but the question is about whether the original restrictions are enforceable. So, the original restriction is in the original deed, which is enforceable. So, the original restriction is enforceable, preventing any further subdivisions beyond two acres. So, the contractors can't use their land for subdivisions beyond two acres, but that's about their own land, not the original owners' land.

So, the original restriction is enforceable, but it doesn't affect the contractor's phase 2 land. So, the contractor's phase 2 land is allowed, but the original restriction doesn't affect the phase 1 owners' ability to use their land. So, the options don't directly address this.

Wait, but the original restriction is in the original deed, which is signed by the original owners. So, the original restriction is enforceable on the original owners, but it doesn't affect the contractor's phase 2 land. So, the contractor can proceed with phase 2, but the original restriction doesn't affect the phase 1 owners' ability to use their land.

So, the question is whether the original restrictions are enforceable for the phase 1 owners. The answer would be that the original restrictions are enforceable, thus preventing any further subdivisions beyond two acres, including the contractor's phase 2 land. But the original restriction doesn't affect the phase 1 owners' ability to use their land.

Wait, but the options are about whether the original restrictions are enforceable for the phase 1 owners. So, the original restriction is in the original deed, which is enforceable, and it's a restriction on the original owners' land. So, the original owners are protected from any subdivision beyond two acres. So, when they sold their land to the contractor, the contractor can't use their land for further subdivisions beyond two acres. But that's about their own land, not the original owners' land.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look at the options again:

Option G: the restrictions are still enforceable, thus preventing commercial use.

So, the original restriction is enforceable, which would mean that the original owners can't have subdivisions beyond two acres. So, when they sold their land to the contractor, the contractor can't use their land for further subdivisions beyond two acres. But that's about the contractor's land, not the original owners' land.

Wait, but the original restriction is about the original owners' land. So, when the original owners sold their land to the contractor, the contractor can't use their land for further subdivisions beyond two acres. So, the contractor's phase 2 land is a new subdivision, not affected by the original restriction.

The original restriction is about the original owners' land. So, the original restriction is enforceable on the original owners, but it doesn't affect the contractor's phase 2 land. So, the contractor can proceed with their phase 2 plan without any issues.

So, the original restriction is still enforceable, but it doesn't affect the contractor's phase 2 land. So, the options don't directly address this.

Wait, but the original restriction is in the original deed, which is enforceable. So, the original restriction is enforceable, and it's a restriction on the original owners' land. So, when the original owners sold their land to the contractor, the contractor can't use their land for further subdivisions beyond two acres. But that's about the contractor's land, not the original owners' land.

So, the original restriction is still enforceable and doesn't affect the contractor's phase 2 land. So, the contractor can proceed with their plan, which is a new subdivision, not affected by the original restriction on the original owners' land.

Wait, but the question is about the phase 1 owners' ability to use their land. If the original restriction is in the original deed, then the original owners are bound by it, but when they sold their land, the contractor can't use their land for subdivisions beyond two acres. So, the contractor can't use their land for phase 2. But that's about their own land, not the original owners' land.

So, the original restriction is still enforceable, and it's a restriction on the original owners' land. So, when the original owners sold their land, the contractor can't use that land for further subdivisions beyond two acres. But that's about the contractor's land, not the original owners' land.

So, the contractor's phase 2 land is a new plan, not a restriction on the original owners' land. So, the original restriction doesn't affect the contractor's phase 2 land. So, the contractor can proceed, but their phase 2 land is a new plan, not a restriction.

So, the original restriction is still enforceable, thus preventing the contractor from using their land for phase 2. But that doesn't affect the original owners' ability to use their land.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. The original restriction is in the original deed, which is enforceable. It's a restriction on the original owners' land. So, when the original owners sold their land, the contractor can't use that land for subdivisions beyond two acres. But that's about the contractor's land, not the original owners' land.

So, the contractor can use their own land, but their own land is a new subdivision, not a restriction on the original owners' land. So, the original restriction doesn't affect the contractor's land.

So, the original restriction is still enforceable, so the contractor can't use their land beyond two acres (phase 2). But that's about their own land. The original owners are still bound by the original restriction, but their ability to use their land (which is subdivided into two or less) is allowed, but their inability to use their land beyond two acres is prevented.

Wait, but the original restriction is in the original deed. So, the original owners are bound by it. So, the original owners can't have their land subdivided beyond two acres. So, when they sold their land to the contractor, the contractor's phase 2 land is a new subdivision, but that's allowed.

So, the contractor can proceed with their phase 2 plan, which is a new subdivision. But the original restriction is still in place on the original owners' land. So, the original owners are allowed to have their land subdivided into two or less, but they can't have it subdivided beyond two. So, their ability to use their land is allowed, but their inability to use their land beyond two is prevented.

But the contractor's phase 2 land is a new subdivision, not a further subdivision of the original owners' land. So, the original restriction doesn't affect the contractor's phase 2 land.

So, the contractor can proceed with their phase 2 plan, because the original restriction is still enforceable on the original owners' land. So, the original restriction doesn't affect the contractor's phase 2 land.

Therefore, the original restriction is still enforceable, thus preventing commercial use on the original owners' land. So, the answer would be G.

Alternatively, considering that the original restriction is in the original deed, which is enforceable, and it's a restriction on the original owners' land. So, when they sold their land to the contractor, the contractor can't use that land for further subdivisions beyond two acres. But that's about the contractor's land, not the original owners' land.

So, the contractor's phase 2 land is a new subdivision, not a further subdivision of the original owners' land. So, the original restriction doesn't affect the contractor's phase 2 land.

Thus, the original restriction is still enforceable, which would mean that the original owners are prevented from having their land subdivided beyond two acres, which in turn would prevent the original owners from using their land for further subdivisions.

But the contractor's phase 2 land is a new subdivision, not a restriction on the original owners' land, so the original restriction doesn't affect the contractor's phase 2 land.

So, the answer would be G: the restrictions are still enforceable, thus preventing commercial use.

Wait, but the original restriction is in the original deed, which is signed by the original owners. So, the original restriction is enforceable on the original owners, but it doesn't affect the contractor's land. So, the contractor's land is a new subdivision, not a restriction on the original owners' land.

Thus, the original restriction is still enforceable, so preventing the original owners from using their land beyond two acres. But the contractor's phase 2 land is a new plan, not a restriction.

So, the answer would be G.

But wait, the options include E: restrictions no longer enforceable because of medical practice.

So, if the original restriction is in the original deed, which is a special warranty deed, and the original owners are the ones under it, then the original restriction is enforceable. So, when the original owners sold their land, the contractor can't use that land for further subdivisions beyond two acres, but that's about the contractor's land, not the original owners' land.

So, the original restriction is still enforceable, thus preventing any further subdivision beyond two acres, including the contractor's phase 2 land.

So, the contractor can use their own plan, which is a new subdivision, not a restriction on the original owners' land.

So, the original restriction is still enforceable, thus preventing the original owners from using their land beyond two acres.

But the contractor's phase 2 land is a new plan, not a restriction on the original owners' land.

So, the answer would be G.

Wait, but the options also include E: restrictions no longer enforceable because of medical practice.

So, if the contractor's phase 2 land is a new subdivision, which is allowed, but the original restriction is in the original deed, which is enforceable, then the contractor's phase 2 land is allowed, but the original restriction is still enforceable on the original owners.

So, the original restriction is still enforceable, so preventing the original owners from using their land beyond two acres.

But the contractor's phase 2 land is a new plan, not a restriction on the original owners' land.

So, the answer is G.

But the options are:

G: restrictions still enforceable, thus preventing commercial use.

So, the answer is G.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think differently.

The original restriction is in the original deed, which is a special warranty deed. So, the original owners are the ones under it. The original restriction is enforceable on the original owners' land.

When the original owners sold their land to the contractor, the contractor can't use that land for further subdivisions beyond two acres, but that's about the contractor's land, not the original owners' land.

So, the original restriction is still enforceable on the original owners, so preventing the original owners from using their land beyond two acres.

But the contractor's phase 2 land is a new plan, not a restriction on the original owners' land, so the original restriction doesn't affect the contractor's phase 2 land.

So, the answer is G.

But wait, the options also include E: restrictions no longer enforceable because of medical practice.

So, perhaps the original restriction is no longer enforceable because the medical practice is a separate issue.

But why would the original restriction be no longer enforceable because of medical practice?

Wait, I'm not sure. The original restriction is a restriction on the original owners' land. If the original owners are allowed to have their land subdivided into two or fewer, then the original restriction is still enforceable.

So, the contractor's phase 2 land is a new plan, not a restriction on the original owners' land, so the original restriction doesn't affect the contractor's phase 2 land.

So, the answer is G.

But I'm not sure if I've considered all possibilities. I think I've done enough analysis.
</think>

The original restriction in the original deed is enforceable on the original owners' land. When the original owners sold their land to the contractor, the contractor is prevented from using that land for further subdivisions beyond two acres. However, the contractor's own phase 2 plan is a new subdivision, not a restriction on the original owners' land. Therefore, the original restriction is still enforceable, preventing the original owners from using their land beyond two acres.

ANSWER: G
