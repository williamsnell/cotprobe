Okay, so I've got this question about organizational structures and specialisation. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking which structure uses specialisation as a feature. The options are A through J, with some being more specific terms.

First, I remember that organizational structures can be categorized in different ways, like hierarchical, flat, matrix, etc. Specialisation in an organization usually happens when people or departments focus on specific tasks or products, which makes the structure more divisional or functional. 

Wait, what's a functional structure? I think it's where different departments are responsible for specific functions, like marketing, sales, etc. So each department does their thing, and there's less specialisation because they're more about the function than the product.

Then there's the hierarchical structure, like a pyramid shape. In this case, top management oversees the rest. Specialisation might not be the main feature here because the top level might handle more general management, and lower levels might be more specialized but still under a central authority.

The matrix structure combines elements of functional and divisional structures. It's where different functions are assigned to different divisions. So each division has its own focus, which can lead to some divisional structure but not full specialisation.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the flat structure. I think a flat structure is more like a matrix but without the divisional focus. Each function is isolated, and there's more about reporting to the top rather than specialising in their area.

Oh right, the divisional structure is another one. In this structure, the organization is divided into distinct divisions, each handling a specific product line or service area. This leads to a lot of divisionalisation and perhaps some functional aspects because each division has its own goals and responsibilities. So in a divisional structure, each division might have its own functional areas, but maybe not as much specialisation as in a matrix.

Wait, but the question is about specialisation. Specialisation is about each department focusing on a specific product or service. So maybe the functional structure has more divisional structure, but not necessarily specialisation. The matrix combines functional and divisional, but it's more about responsibilities than divisional focus.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. Specialisation is when a group of people or departments focus on the same product or service, leading to divisional structure. The divisional structure is a type of functional structure. So if a structure uses divisional division, then it's a divisional structure. But the question is about using specialisation as a feature, which would imply that the structure has more divisional focus, like a divisional structure.

Looking at the options, option F is Divisional. So the answer should be F: Divisional.

The correct answer is F: Divisional. Specialisation in an organizational structure typically occurs within a divisional structure, where the organization is divided into distinct divisions, each handling a specific product or service area. This divisional focus leads to more specialization among departments. 

Answer: F
