Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how much of Mr. Okada's property taxes go toward education. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the home he owns is worth $28,750. But the town assesses property at 38% of the market value. Oh right, so the assessed value is 38% of the market value. That means I need to calculate 38% of $28,750 to find out what the home is actually worth for tax purposes.

So, how do I calculate 38%? Well, I think I multiply 28,750 by 0.38. Let me do that. 28,750 times 0.38. Let me see—maybe I can break it down. 28,750 * 0.3 is 8,625, and 28,750 * 0.08 is 2,300. Adding those together: 8,625 + 2,300 equals $10,925. So, the assessed value is $10,925.

Next, the property taxes are at the rate of $8.42 per $100. So, I need to find the total property taxes first. Since the assessed value is $10,925, I divide that by $100 to find how many $100 units there are. Let's see, 10,925 divided by 100 is 109.25. So, there are 109.25 units of $100 each.

Now, each unit is $8.42. So, I multiply 109.25 by $8.42 to get the total property taxes. Let me calculate that. 109 * 8.42 is 109*8=872, plus 109*0.42=45.78. So, 872 +45.78=917.78. Then, 0.25 *8.42 is 2.105. Adding that to 917.78 gives 919.885, which I can round to $919.89.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I made a mistake. Because 109.25 * 8.42. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps using a different approach. Let's compute 109.25 * 8.42. Maybe I can do this step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps 109 *8.42 + 0.25 *8.42. So 109 *8.42 is, let's see: 100*8.42=842, 9*8.42=75.78. So 842 +75.78=917.78. Then 0.25*8.42=2.105. Adding those gives 917.78 +2.105=919.885, which is $919.89 when rounded to the nearest cent.

So the total property taxes are $919.89.

Now, 47% of his property taxes is spent on education. So I need to calculate 47% of $919.89.

So, 0.47 *919.89. Let me compute that. 900 *0.47=423, 19.89 *0.47. Let's see: 19*0.47=8.93, 0.89*0.47≈0.4183. So 8.93 +0.4183=9.3483. So total is 423 +9.3483=432.3483, which is approximately $432.35 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Looking at the options, option D is $432.35, so that should be the answer.

The assessed value of the home is 38% of $28,750, which is $10,925. The total property taxes are calculated by dividing this assessed value by $100, resulting in 109.25 units. Multiplying by the tax rate of $8.42 per $100 gives a total of $919.89 in property taxes. Finally, 47% of these taxes, which is $432.35, is allocated to education.

Answer: D: $432.35
