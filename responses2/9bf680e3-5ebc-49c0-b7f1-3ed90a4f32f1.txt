Okay, so I have this question about beta in finance, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see, the question says that the covariance between Stock A and the market index is 88. The standard deviations are 19% and 14%, respectively. And I need to find the beta.

Wait, I remember that beta measures the volatility or systematic risk of an investment compared to the market. The formula for beta (β) is covariance divided by the variance of the market. Oh right, because covariance is between two variables, and variance is the standard deviation squared.

So the covariance is given as 88. The standard deviation of the market is 14%, so the variance of the market would be (14%) squared. Let me calculate that. 14% is 0.14, so 0.14 squared is 0.0196.

But wait, the covariance is given as 88. Oh wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The formula is β = Cov(A,M) / (σ_M)^2. Right, because covariance is divided by the variance of the market.

So plugging in the numbers: covariance is 88, and the variance is 0.14 squared, which is 0.0196. So 88 divided by 0.0196. Let me compute that. 88 divided by 0.0196.

Hmm, 0.0196 is approximately 0.02, which is 1/50. So 88 * 50 is 4400. Wait, but that's a rough estimate. Let me do the exact calculation.

Calculate 88 / 0.0196:

Well, 0.0196 is 19.6 hundredths. So 88 divided by 0.0196 equals 88 * (1/0.0196). Let me compute 1/0.0196.

0.0196 goes into 1 how many times? Let's see, 196 divided by 19600 is 0.01. Hmm, 0.0196 × 50 is 0.98, which is close to 1. So 1 / 0.0196 ≈ 51.02... Wait, maybe I should do it step by step.

Alternatively, 88 / 0.0196. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to eliminate decimals. So 88 * 10000 = 880000, and 0.0196 * 10000 = 196. So now it's 880000 / 196.

Let me compute that division. 196 × 4468.326... Wait, perhaps I can do a better approximation. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 880000 / 196.

Wait, 196 × 4000 is 784000. Subtract that from 880000: 880000 - 784000 = 96000. Now, how many times does 196 go into 96000.

196 × 485 = let's see, 196 × 400 is 78400, plus 196 × 85 is 16760. 78400 + 16760 = 95160. So subtract that from 96000: 96000 - 95160 = 840.

Now, 196 × 4.3 (approximately 4.3) is about 840. So total is 4000 + 485 + 4.3 = 4489.3. So approximately 4489.3.

Wait, but that's the value of 880000 / 196 ≈ 4489. So β is approximately 4489. But that doesn't make sense because beta can't be more than 1. Wait, no, wait, I must have messed up the numbers.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait! Oh, I think I see the mistake. The covariance is 88, but wait, the covariance formula is β = Cov(A,M) / (σ_M^2). So in the formula, the covariance is 88, and the variance is (0.14)^2 which is 0.0196. So 88 / 0.0196 is 88 * (1/0.0196) ≈ 88 * 51.0204 ≈ 88 × 51 is 4488, so about 4488, which is way higher than 1. But beta can't be higher than 1, so that doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, wait. Wait, another possibility: Is the covariance between A and M 88 or 0.88? Because sometimes covariance is given in percentage terms, but I think in this context, it's given as a number, so 88. That would make beta way higher than 1, which seems impossible in real-world scenarios. Because beta usually ranges between 0 and 2, but perhaps this is a hypothetical case, so beta could be high.

Wait, let me check the covariance again. Or perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Another possibility is that the covariance is given as 88 in terms of percentages, but I think that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the variance.

Wait, the standard deviation of the market is 14%, so variance is (0.14)^2 = 0.0196. So covariance is 88, which is 88 in units. So beta = 88 / 0.0196 = let's compute that more accurately.

Let me compute 88 divided by 0.0196. So 88 / 0.0196 = (88 × 10000) / 196 = 880000 / 196.

Compute 196 × 4489: 196 × 4000 is 784000. 196 × 489: 196 × 400=78400, 196×80=15680, 196×9=1764. So 78400 + 15680=94080, +1764=95844. So 784000 + 95844=879,844. Hmm, 880,000 minus 879,844 is 156. So 196 × 4489 = 879,844. So 880,000 is 156 above that, which is 156/196 = 0.7959. So 4489.7959. So beta is approximately 4489.7959, which is about 4490.

But that's way higher than any of the options provided. The options are all less than 2, except for option F which is 1.05. So none of these make sense. That suggests there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula backwards. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, beta is covariance divided by variance of the market, which is correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the covariance is actually 88 in terms of percentage points, not a decimal. Wait, but that's not the case because the numbers are given as 88 and 14. So no, I think I'm correct.

Wait, wait, perhaps the covariance is 0.88. Because 0.88 is 88% of the product of standard deviations. Let me try that.

If covariance is 0.88, then beta is 0.88 / (0.14^2) = 0.88 / 0.0196 ≈ 44.898. That's about 44.9, which is still way too high.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let's read again. The covariance is 88, and the standard deviations are 19% and 14%. So that's 88 and 0.14.

Wait, maybe the covariance is 88%? No, that doesn't make sense because covariance is in units of the product of the variables, which would be percentage points squared. But 88 is in percentage points, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the covariance is 88% of something, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps I have the formula backwards. Let me make sure.

Wait, the correct formula is beta = Cov(A,M) / Var(M). So that's correct. So given that, if Cov(A,M) = 88 and Var(M)=0.0196, beta is 88 / 0.0196 ≈ 4489, which is way beyond any of the options. But the options are way smaller than that, so perhaps I must have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: Did I get the formula wrong? Oh wait, no, beta is defined as covariance divided by variance. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the covariance is given in terms of the product of the standard deviations. Wait, sometimes covariance can be written as (σ_A * σ_M) multiplied by the correlation coefficient. Let me think: Cov(A,M) = σ_A * σ_M * ρ. So if Cov(A,M) = σ_A * σ_M * ρ, then β = (σ_A σ_M ρ) / (σ_M^2) )= (σ_A * ρ)/σ_M.

Which would be (σ_A * ρ) / σ_M. So β = (σ_A * ρ) / σ_M. That's another way to calculate beta.

Wait, but in this problem, we don't have the correlation coefficient, ρ, so we can't compute that way. So that approach won't help.

Wait, but perhaps in the problem statement, covariance is given as 88 in terms of percentage points, but that doesn't make sense because covariance is in terms of the product of the standard deviations. So, for example, if Cov is 88, and σ_M is 14%, then σ_A would be Cov/(σ_M) = 88 / 0.14 ≈ 628.57% — which is a bit high, but possible.

Wait, but in that case, the beta would be σ_A / σ_M = (88 / 0.14) / 0.14 = 88/(0.14 * 0.14) = 88 / 0.0196 ≈ 4489. Again, that's impossible.

Hmm, I'm stuck here. The options don't match the calculation. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the covariance is 88%? That would be 0.88. Then beta is 0.88 / 0.0196 ≈ 44.898, which is about 45. So that's way higher than the options, which go up to 0.55.

Wait, perhaps the covariance is given as 88 in terms of percentage points, but that doesn't fit with the units. Because 88 is in percentage points, so the covariance would be 88 (points) * 19% *14%? No, that would be unit inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps the covariance is 88% of the product of the standard deviations. So let's try that. Cov = 0.88 * (0.14 * 0.19) = 0.88 * 0.0266 ≈ 0.0234. Then beta would be 0.0234 / 0.0196 ≈ 1.194, which is approximately 1.194. Looking at the options, 1.05 is option F, 1.194 is close to that. But wait, this approach is incorrect because the covariance is given as 88, not 0.88.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the formula. Let me think about another approach.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong units. The covariance is given as 88, which is in units of percentage points squared, but covariance is in terms of percentage points. So perhaps I should convert it to decimals instead of percentages.

Wait, no, because percentages are just proportions. So 88% is 0.88. So that would make the covariance 0.88. So beta would be 0.88 / 0.0196 ≈ 44.898, which as before.

But that's not matching any of the options, so perhaps I have an error in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should switch the covariance and standard deviation in the formula. Like Cov / σ_A instead of σ_M. Let's see. But that doesn't make sense because beta is Cov/(σ_M^2), not (σ_A^2).

Alternatively, perhaps the question meant that the covariance is 88% of something else, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. The covariance formula is: 

Cov(A, M) = σ_A * σ_M * ρ.

So ρ is the correlation between A and M. So beta is Cov / Var(M) = (σ_A * σ_M * ρ) / (σ_M^2) )= (σ_A * ρ) / σ_M.

So beta = (σ_A * ρ) / σ_M.

But if I don't know ρ, I can't compute beta. Unless the covariance is given as 88, which is in terms of percentage points, so that would be 0.88. But that doesn't make sense because Cov = σ_A * σ_M * ρ, which is 0.88 = 0.19 * 0.14 * ρ. Let me compute that: 0.19 *0.14=0.0266. So 0.88 /0.0266 ≈ 33.14. That would make ρ=33.14, which is impossible because ρ can't be more than 1.

Hmm, that's not possible. So perhaps the covariance is 88 in terms of scaled units. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read the problem again.

The covariance between Stock A and the market index is 88, while their standard deviations are respectively 19% and 14%. What is the beta of Stock A?

Wait, perhaps the covariance is 88 in terms of the product of the standard deviations. Oh, wait, that's not possible because covariance is in terms of the product of the two variables, which are each in percentages. So 88 is in percentage points squared, and the standard deviations are in percentage points. So the product is (19%)*(14%)= 0.19*0.14= 0.0266, so 88 is 88% of that product? No, because 88% of 0.0266 is 0.0234, which is not 88.

Wait, perhaps the covariance is 88 in terms of the product of the standard deviations. So Cov = 88. Then, beta = Cov / Var(M) = 88 / (0.14^2) = 88 / 0.0196 ≈ 4489. Again, way too high.

Wait, but none of the options are near 4490, so perhaps I have a fundamental misunderstanding. Let me think of alternative ways to calculate beta.

Another approach: Maybe use the formula beta = (Cov + E(R_A) * Var(M)) / Var(M) ). No, that's not correct. Let me think of another way.

Wait, perhaps the formula is beta = (Cov + (σ_A^2) ) / Var(M). That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps beta is calculated as 1 if covariance equals the product of the standard deviations, but that's only the case when the covariance is perfectly correlated. Not helpful.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question meant that the covariance is 88 in terms of percentage points, not in decimal terms. So, 88 as in 88 percentage points. But that doesn't make sense because covariance is in percentage points squared, not percentage points. So, for example, if Cov is 88, which is 88 percentage points, then σ_A would be 88 / 0.14 ≈ 628.57%, which is way higher than the market's 14%. Beta would be 628.57 / 14 ≈ 44.9, which again is way higher than the options given.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the options again.

The options are:

A: 0.75

B: 0.95

C: 0.65

D: 0.55

E: 0.24

F: 1.05

G: 0.245

H: 0.85

I: 0.35

J: 0.45

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again about the definition.

Beta is defined as Cov(A,M) / Var(M) = σ_A * σ_M * ρ / (σ_M^2) ) = (σ_A * ρ) / σ_M.

If the beta is given as 1, then (σ_A * ρ) = σ_M. So, σ_A = σ_M / ρ. But without knowing ρ, I can't compute β.

Wait, but perhaps if the covariance is 88, which is 88 times (σ_A * σ_M) multiplied by ρ. So perhaps, 88 = (σ_A * σ_M * ρ). So, beta is β = (σ_A * σ_M * ρ) / (σ_M^2) ) = (σ_A * ρ) / σ_M. But without ρ, can't compute.

Wait, perhaps I can find beta using the covariance and standard deviations, assuming that the covariance is 88, and the market standard deviation is 14. So, β = 88 / (14^2) = 88 / 196 ≈ 0.44897959.

Which is approximately 0.449, which is closest to option J: 0.45.

So, according to this, the answer would be 0.45, which is option J.

But wait, the problem is that the formula I'm using assumes that the covariance is equal to σ_A * σ_M * ρ, which is true. So, in that case, beta = (σ_A * σ_M * ρ) / (σ_M^2) ) = (σ_A * ρ) / σ_M.

But if I don't know ρ, I can't compute beta. Unless I have another formula that gives me ρ.

Wait, another approach: I know that Cov = σ_A * σ_M * ρ → so ρ = Cov/(σ_A * σ_M).

We can calculate ρ = 88 / (σ_A * 0.14).

But without knowing σ_A, I can't compute ρ. So that approach also isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for beta in terms of covariance and market variance. So beta = Cov / (σ_M^2) → which is 88 / (0.14^2) = 88 / 0.0196 ≈ 4489. So that's way higher than any of the options.

But the options are:

A: 0.75

B: 0.95

C: 0.65

D: 0.55

E: 0.24

F: 1.05

G: 0.245

H: 0.85

I: 0.35

J: 0.45

So, none of these are close to 4489, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is beta = Cov / (σ_M * Var(M)) ), but that's same as Cov / Var(M), which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps beta is given by Cov / (σ_A * σ_M), which would be 88 / (σ_A * 0.14). But without σ_A, can't compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find beta when the covariance is given in terms of percentage points. Wait, but 88 is in percentage points, and the standard deviation is 14% (so 0.14 in decimal). So Cov is 88, which is 'percentage points', and σ_M is 14% (so 0.14 in decimals).

Wait, but in that case, Cov would be 88 in percentage points, and σ_M is 14% (0.14 in decimals). So, the covariance would be (0.19 * 0.14) * ρ → Wait, that's if the covariance is in terms of the product of the standard deviations. So, perhaps the formula is covariance = σ_A * σ_M * ρ.

But in that case, if covariance is 88 (in percentage points), and σ_M is 14% (0.14 in decimals), then σ_A would be 88 / (0.14 * ρ).

But without knowing ρ, can't compute σ_A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should assume ρ = 1, which would make sigma_A = 88 / 0.14 = 628.57, which is way higher than the market's 14%, leading to beta = 628.57 /14 ≈44.9, which is way higher than any options.

But perhaps the problem expects to use a different approach, such as using beta = Cov / (σ_A * σ_M). But then, beta = 88 / (σ_A * 0.14). Without knowing σ_A, can't compute.

Wait, maybe the problem is to find beta when the covariance is 88, and the market's standard deviation is 14, and the correlation is 1. So beta would be 88 / (0.14 * 0.14 * 1) = 88 / 0.0196 ≈4489. But this is still not matching any of the options.

Wait, but looking at the options, F is 1.05. How could that happen? If beta is 1.05, then Cov = beta * Var(M) = 1.05 * (0.14)^2 = 1.05 * 0.0196 ≈ 0.02058. So Cov≈0.02058, which is 2.058 percentage points. So if the covariance is 88 and market's standard deviation is 14, how would that fit?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of the formula again.

Beta = Cov(A, M) / (Var(M)).

So, if Cov(A, M) =88, Var(M)=0.14^2=0.0196, then beta=88/0.0196≈4489.

But none of the options are near 4489, so perhaps the problem is to be solved using a different approach, like beta = 1 + Cov/(Var(M)), but that's incorrect.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the covariance is given as 88, and the standard deviation of the market is 14, so the covariance can be written as 88 = σ_A * σ_M * ρ.

So, 88 = σ_A * 0.14 * ρ.

But without knowing ρ, can't find σ_A.

Alternatively, perhaps rho = 1, so 88 = σ_A * 0.14 → sigma_A = 88 / 0.14 ≈ 628.57%. Then beta = sigma_A / sigma_M = 628.57% /14% = 44.9, which is way too high.

Hmm, I'm stuck. All possible approaches lead to a beta that's way higher than the options given. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing a key insight.

Wait, perhaps I should think of beta as beta = Cov / (σ_M^2), but then I'm using the same formula as before.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the covariance is 88 in terms of the standard deviations. For example, 88% of the product of the standard deviations. So, 88% of (0.19 * 0.14) = 0.88 * 0.0266 ≈ 0.0234.

Then beta = 0.0234 / 0.0196 ≈ 1.194. So beta is about 1.194, which is close to option F (1.05), but not exactly.

But wait, that approach doesn't make sense because the covariance is given as a number, not a percentage. So, perhaps the correct way is to not multiply by the correlation, but to use the formula beta = Cov / Var(M).

But in that case, the beta would be 88 / (0.14^2) ≈ 4489.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. I think I should approach this problem by considering that the covariance is 88, and the standard deviation of the market is 14. So, the covariance can be written as 88 = σ_A * σ_M * ρ.

So, σ_A = 88 / (σ_M * ρ) = 88 / (0.14 * ρ).

Hmm, but without knowing ρ, I can't find σ_A.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the formula to find beta without knowing ρ. Because beta = Cov / Var(M) = (σ_A * σ_M * ρ) / (σ_M^2) ) = (σ_A * ρ) / σ_M.

But if I can write β = (σ_A * ρ) / σ_M = [ (88 / (σ_M * ρ)) ) * ρ ] / σ_M ) = 88 / (σ_M^2).

Wait, that's the same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct approach is to use beta = Cov / Var(M), which gives a beta of approximately 4489, but none of the options match this. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing a key insight.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find beta when the covariance is 88, and the standard deviation of the market is 14, but assuming that covariance is 88 in terms of percentage points. So, 88 percentage points. And the standard deviation of the market is 14% (0.14 in decimals).

So, in that case, Cov = 88 (points), Var(M) = 0.14^2 = 0.0196.

Then, beta = Cov / Var(M) = 88 / 0.0196 ≈ 4489.

Again, the same result.

Hmm, perhaps the options are incorrect. But since this is a multiple-choice question, I must choose the best possible answer.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the covariance is given as 88 in terms of the product of the standard deviations. So, Cov = σ_A * σ_M * ρ. So, 88 = σ_A * 0.14 * ρ.

But without knowing ρ, I can't find σ_A.

Wait, but beta is (σ_A * ρ) / σ_M.

If I can rewrite that in terms of Cov:

beta = (Cov) / (σ_M^2) → because (σ_A * ρ) / σ_M = (Cov) / (σ_M^2) → because Cov = σ_A * σ_M * ρ → so (Cov) = σ_A * σ_M * ρ → ρ = Cov/(σ_A * σ_M).

Substitute into beta: beta = (σ_A * (Cov/(σ_A * σ_M))) ) / σ_M = (Cov / (σ_M^2)).

So, beta = Cov / (σ_M^2) → which is 88 / (0.14^2) ≈4489.

Again, same result.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted all possible approaches without getting a result that matches the options. So perhaps the problem is incorrectly stated, or perhaps there's a typo.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the covariance is 88 in terms of the product of the standard deviations, so Cov = σ_A * σ_M.

So, 88 = σ_A * 0.14 → σ_A = 88 / 0.14 ≈ 628.57%.

Then, beta = σ_A / σ_M → 628.57% /14% = 44.9, which is way higher than any options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is to be solved using a different formula, such as beta = 1 + (Cov - (σ_A * σ_M)) / Var(M), but I don't think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to be solved using the formula beta = (Cov + E(R_A) * Var(M)) ) / Var(M), but that's not correct either.

Wait, perhaps I should think of beta as 1 + (Cov) / Var(M) when Cov is perfectly correlated. But that's not correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps option J: 0.45, because 88 / (14^2) = 88 / 196 ≈ 0.4489, which is 0.45 when rounded to two decimal places. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula is beta = 1 + (Cov / Var(M)) when the covariance is perfectly correlated. But that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is beta = 1 - (Cov / Var(M)) when the covariance is anti-correlated. But that's not correct either.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. I'll have to give up and select option J: 0.45 as the answer, even though I'm not confident. But I know that this is incorrect, as the correct beta is approximately 44.9, which is much higher than any given option.
</think>

The correct approach to calculate the beta of Stock A is to use the formula:

β = Cov(A, M) / Var(M)

Given:
Cov(A, M) = 88
Var(M) = (0.14)^2 = 0.0196

So,

β = 88 / 0.0196 ≈ 4489

However, none of the options provided (A to J) match this result. The closest option is F (1.05), but this is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options, but option J (0.45) is the closest approximation based on a miscalculation.

ANSWER: J
