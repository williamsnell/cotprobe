Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the highest per capita rate of homelessness as of 2013. The options are a bunch of countries, and I need to figure out which one has the highest rate based on what I remember or can deduce.

First, I should probably recall some statistics I know. I remember that Canada had a high rate of homelessness back then. I think it was around 22% or so. Spain and Chile might be close, but I'm not sure. Australia and Germany had lower rates, maybe around 8%. 

Wait, let me think again. I'm pretty sure Canada was one of the top countries, but I'm trying to remember if Australia was below that. Oh right, Australia's rate was around 7.8% or so. Then there's Chile at around 6.5%. Spain might have been higher than Chile, maybe around 7.5%? 

Looking at the options, the choices are A (South Africa), B (Canada), C (Russia), D (Sweden), E (Australia), F (US), G (Chile), H (Ireland), I (Spain), J (Japan). 

So Canada is option B, and Chile is G. I think Chile was the highest in terms of per capita rate. I believe the actual rate was around 7.5% in Chile, which would be the highest among the options given. 

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact numbers. Let me think: South Africa's rate was about 17%, which seems higher, but that's option A. Spain was around 7.5%, Chile 6.5%, Australia 7.8%. So, the highest is Canada at 22%, then Chile at 7.5%, followed by Australia at 7.8%, Spain at 7.5%, and so on.

So the highest per capita rate among the options is Canada, option B.
