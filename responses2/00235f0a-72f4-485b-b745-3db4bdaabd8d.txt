Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the Conservative government's strategies during the 1979 era. The question is asking which strategy was NOT used by the Conservative government to reduce the power of the labor movement. The options are A through I, and I need to pick the one that wasn't a strategy they employed.

First, I should recall what the Conservative government did then. I remember that during this time, the Conservative government was trying to reform the labor system to better align with socialist principles. They wanted to reduce the power of the labor movement and make workers more effective.

Option A: Making secondary action illegal. Secondary action refers to actions by workers outside the labor union that support other workers. This makes sense because it's a strategy to disrupt the union's influence. I think the Conservative government did this, so A is a strategy they used.

Option B: Enforcing mandatory arbitration. Arbitration is a method for resolving disputes between parties. If the government enforces this, it would make matters more resolved, which I think was part of their efforts to reduce union power. So B is a strategy, so it's not the answer.

Option C: banning political strikes that weren't primarily for worker conditions. I believe that was a common tactic. They wanted to limit strikes that were not necessary or productive for workers. So C is a strategy, not the correct answer.

Option D: Imposing restrictions on picketing. Picketing is a form of non-union labor union. If they restrict it, it would limit workers' actions, which is another strategy to reduce union power.

Option E: Implementing a national minimum wage. Wait, the question is about which strategy was NOT used. So if I can recall, the government did try to lower wages, but I think they were part of a larger movement. But wait, the question is about a strategy to reduce the power of the labor movement. Lowering the wage might have made workers more costly, which could reduce their purchasing power. But wait, the question is about reducing the power, not the size or effectiveness. So if they actually reduced the minimum wage, that's an effort to lower the cost and perhaps control the labor union. But I'm not sure if that was a strategy to reduce the power. Alternatively, maybe they did allow some control but not fully eliminate it. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that the Conservative government in the 70s did have a plan to lower the minimum wage, but that might have been part of a broader effort to control labor unions rather than directly reducing their power. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps E is a strategy used, meaning the question is about which was NOT used. So if E was a strategy, then the correct answer would not be E. Let me think more.

Option F: Making all strike action illegal. That makes sense because if strikes can't happen, that would limit any union activity. So F is a strategy, so it's not the answer.

Option G: Outlawing collective bargaining. Collective bargaining is a form of labor union. If they outlawed it, that would reduce the union's influence, which was a strategy. So G is a strategy used, so not the answer.

Option H: Replacing the labor movement with government-controlled worker's councils. I think that was a movement where workers could unionize but had more control from government. This was part of the plan to limit union power. So H is a strategy used, so not the answer.

Option I: Privatizing all industries. Privatization is about selling off public sectors and giving them to private companies. I'm not sure if that directly relates to reducing the power of the labor movement. It's more about making public services go to private, which could affect the government's role but perhaps not the labor movement's power. So I'm not certain about this one.

Wait, the question is about which was NOT a strategy. So, which of these is not a strategy used. Let me think about each.

The Conservative government's main strategies were to reduce the power and effectiveness of the labor union. They banned certain actions, limited unions, and implemented various controls on labor movements.

Option E is about minimum wage. I think they did try to lower it, but I'm not sure if it was a strategy to reduce the power. Alternatively, maybe they allowed some control but not complete control. Or perhaps they reduced the minimum wage, but that's more about economic control than union power.

Wait, I think that the Conservative government did reduce the minimum wage, but that was part of a broader plan to control unions. So E is not a strategy used by the government to reduce union power. Alternatively, perhaps they did not fully implement it as a strategy. Or maybe they did implement it as part of the plan, so it's a strategy.

Wait, the options are about strategies used, not about whether they should have been used. So, which of these was NOT a strategy.

Wait, another angle: All options except one are strategies used. The question is which was NOT used.

Option A: Making secondary action illegal. Yes, that's a strategy.

Option B: Enforcing arbitration. Yes.

Option C: Banning political strikes. Yes.

Option D: Restricting picketing. Yes.

Option E: Implementing a national minimum wage. I think the government did try to lower it, but I'm not sure if it was a key strategy to reduce union power. Alternatively, maybe they allowed some control but not complete control, so E is not a strategy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each option again.

The key points are about strategies to reduce union power. The government wanted to limit the union's influence. So strategies include:

- Disqualifying secondary action (A)
- Enforcing arbitration (B)
- Banning non-productive strikes (C)
-restricting picketing (D)
- Making strike actions illegal (F)
- Outlawing union activities (G)
- Replacing unions with worker councils (H)

So which of these is not a strategy? Let's look at E: Implementing a national minimum wage. I think that's part of the strategy. The government does not eliminate the union's influence. The minimum wage is more of an economic control measure, not a direct strategy to reduce union power.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about whether the minimum wage was part of the strategy. If so, E is a strategy and thus not the correct answer. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think about what each option represents. The question is, which of the following was NOT a strategy.

So, E is about minimum wage. Since the focus is on reducing the power of the labor union, reducing the minimum wage may not be the same. The government may have been considering this as part of their control measures but not a direct strategy to reduce union power.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E. Because implementing a minimum wage might be done as part of their plan to control unions, but it's not a strategy to reduce union power. Or perhaps it's a strategy, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the question says which was not a strategy. So which of these is not a strategy.

Option E: It's about minimum wage, which is more of an economic control measure, not necessarily a strategy to reduce union power. So perhaps E is the answer.

Wait, another point: The Conservative government's approach was to eliminate or restrict union activities, not to control the minimum wage. So the minimum wage was more of an economic control measure, not a strategy to reduce union power.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum wage was part of a strategy to control public services, but not the same as reducing union power.

I think the correct answer is E: Implementing a national minimum wage. Because it's a different strategy, not directly about reducing the power of the labor movement.

The Conservative government's strategies during the 1970s were centered around reducing the power and effectiveness of the labor union. They banned specific actions to disrupt unions and limit their influence. The question asks which strategy was NOT used to reduce union power. 

- **Option A**: Making secondary action illegal was a strategy to disqualify union-backed actions, reducing union influence.
- **Option B**: Enforcing arbitration was a method to resolve disputes, reducing union power.
- **Option C**: Banning political strikes focused on worker conditions was part of their goal to limit non-productive unions.
- **Option D**: Restricting picketing limited workers' actions, directly affecting union power.
- **Option E**: Implementing a national minimum wage was more about economic control rather than reducing union power.
- **Option F**: Making all strike action illegal limited union activities, a strategy to reduce power.
- **Option G**: Outlawing union activities directly reduced union influence.
- **Option H**: Replacing unions with worker councils aimed at limiting union control.
- **Option I**: Privatizing industries was a broader policy affecting public services, not directly part of union power reduction.

The correct answer is **Option E**, as implementing a national minimum wage was not a strategy to reduce the power of the labor movement but rather an economic control measure.
