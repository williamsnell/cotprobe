Okay, so I need to find the net price of a calculator that's originally priced at $100.00 and then gets two successive discounts: 40% and then 25%. Hmm, let's think about how discounts work. 

First, I should figure out how much the first discount takes off. A 40% discount on $100 would be calculated by multiplying 100 by 0.40. Let me do that: 100 * 0.40 equals 40. So the first discount is $40, which leaves the price at $60 after the first discount.

Now, the second discount is 25% off the new price of $60. I'll calculate 25% of 60. That's 60 * 0.25, which is 15. So the second discount is $15. Subtracting that from $60 gives me the final price: $60 - $15 equals $45.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. 40% of 100 is definitely 40, so subtracting that leaves $60. Then 25% of 60 is 15, so 60 - 15 is 45. That makes sense. 

So the net price after both discounts is $45. Looking at the options, option C is $45, which should be the correct answer.

The calculator's first discount reduces the price from $100 by 40%, leaving $60. The second discount of 25% on $60 brings it down to $45. The correct net price is $45.
