Okay, let's try to figure out this friction cone clutch question. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

So the problem says a friction cone clutch operates at 250 rpm and delivers 25 horsepower. We need to find the required cone surface width. The given parameters are the clutch angle (12°), mean radius of the cone at 7.5 inches, maximum permissible pressure is 30 psi, and coefficient of friction is 0.40.

Wait, I remember that for cone clutch calculations, the key formula involves the torque and then relates to the pressure and surface width. Let me recall the formula. Oh right, the torque is related to the pressure, the angle, radius, and the length of the clutch.

First, I should probably convert the given power into torque because we're dealing with power and have to find torque. Oh right, power is torque multiplied by angular velocity. So, Power (in horsepower) is torque (in lb-in) times angular velocity (in rpm) divided by 52.6 (since 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/s, but wait, maybe I should convert rpm to radians per second or something else?)

Wait, no, the formula for power in a clutch is P = T * ω, where P is in horsepower, T is torque in lb-in, and ω is angular speed in radians per second. But wait, the units might be tricky. Let me think again.

Wait, yes, power (hp) can be converted to torque (lb-in) via the formula:

Power (hp) = Torque (lb-in) * (2π * N) / (5252 )

Because 2πN gives the angular displacement in radians per second, multiplied by 5252 (in lb-in/s per hp). So, rearranging:

Torque (lb-in) = (Power (hp) * 5252) / (2πN)

Wait, no, wait. Let me get it right. The formula is:

Power (hp) = (Torque (lb-in) * 2πN) / (5252) ) 

So solving for torque:

Torque = (Power * 5252) / (2πN) )

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me double-check. Alternatively, I remember that 1 horsepower is 550 foot-pounds per second. And torque is in lb-in. So 1 hp = 550 lb-ft/s.

But 1 lb-ft is (12 in) * lb * (1/12) ft = lb-in. So 1 lb-ft = 12 lb-in. So 550 lb-ft = 550 * 12 lb-in = 6600 lb-in/s.

So 1 hp = 550 lb-ft/s = 6600 lb-in/s.

Now, the formula for power is torque (lb-in) multiplied by angular velocity in radians per second.

Angular velocity ω is 2π * N / 60, where N is rpm.

So, substituting:

Power (hp) = (Torque (lb-in) * ω ) / 550

Wait, I think I should re-derive the formula correctly.

Power (hp) = Torque (lb-in) * (N (rpm) * 2π ) / (5252 )

Wait, no, let's do the unit conversion properly. Let me express everything in SI units to avoid confusion.

Power (W) = Torque (N·m) * Angular velocity (rad/s)

But we need to convert hp to watts, and convert torque to N·m, and angular velocity to rad/s.

Wait, maybe I should look for the formula for cone clutch torque.

I think the formula is torque T = (P * 2π N) / (5252 * μ), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, I remember that the torque is given by:

T = (P * 2π N) / (5252) / (μ * (1 + μ))

Wait, no, perhaps that's for the friction force. Wait, let's get this right.

The power in a clutch is P (hp) = T (lb-in) * (N (rpm)) / 52.52, where 52.52 is 10^3 / 2π. Wait, 5252 is (2π * 1000)/60 * 10^3? Hmm, perhaps better to find the correct formula.

Wait, another approach: 1 horsepower is equal to 33,000 foot-pounds per minute (since 1 hp=550 ft-lb/s, so 550 * 60 = 33,000). And 1 foot is 12 inches, so 1 ft-lb is 12 lb-in. So 33,000 ft-lb/min = 33,000 * 12 lb-in/min.

So 33,000 * 12 = 396,000 lb-in/min.

But the power is given in hp, so the formula for power is:

Power (hp) = Torque (lb-in) * (N rpm) / 52.52.

Wait, I think the correct formula is P (hp) = (T (lb-in) * N (rpm)) / 5252

So solving for T:

T = (P * 5252) / N

Wait, let me confirm. Because 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/s. So:

1 hp = 550 ft-lb/s.

But 1 ft-lb = 12 lb-in, so 550 * 12 = 6600 lb-in/s.

So 1 hp = 6600 lb-in/s.

Power (hp) = Torque (lb-in) * Angular velocity (rad/s)

Angular velocity ω = (2π N)/60 rad/s.

So,

Power (hp) = T * (2π N / 60 )

So,

T = (Power * 60) / (2π N )

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

Given: P = 25 hp, N = 250 rpm.

Compute T:

T = (25 * 60) / (2 * π * 250 )

Compute numerator: 25 * 60 = 1500.

Denominator: 2 * π * 250 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 250 ≈ 1570.8.

So T ≈ 1500 / 1570.8 ≈ 0.955 lb-in.

Wait, that's a small torque. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute denominator: 2 * π * 250 = 500 π ≈ 1570.796.

So T = (25 * 60) / (500 π) = (1500)/(500 π) = 3/(π) ≈ 0.95493 lb-in.

Hmm, okay, so the torque is about 0.955 lb-in.

Now, the formula for cone clutch torque is given by:

T = (F * L) / (μ) * (1 - cos θ)

Wait, no, perhaps that's for a different scenario. Wait, I might be mixing up the formula. Let me think again.

Another approach: The torque in a cone clutch is given by T = (P * e) / (2 μ N), where e is the eccentricity, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

T = (P * 2π N) / (5252 * μ)

Wait, that's because 5252 is 1000 * 2π /60 * something? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the torque is given by:

T = (P * 5252) / (2 π N μ )

Wait, let me think about the units. Let's check the units again.

If P is in hp, which is (lb-ft)/s, and N is rpm.

Let me compute the units.

P (hp) = (P in lb-ft/s) * (2π N)/(5252) ) / ( μ )

Wait, let's see:

The formula is:

T = (P * 2π N) / (5252 * μ )

Because P is (lb-ft)/s, so:

T (lb-in) = ( (lb-ft/s) * 2π N ) / (5252 μ )

But wait, 5252 is in units that make this possible. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is T = (P * e) / (μ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps another way. The torque is given by:

T = (P * e) / μ

where e is the eccentricity. But I'm not sure about e. Alternatively, the formula might involve the pressure and the cone angle.

Wait, I think the correct formula for torque is T = (P * e) / μ, where e is the pressure times the mean radius.

Wait, perhaps let me think about the cone clutch equation. I remember that the formula for the torque is:

T = (P * e) / (μ), where e is the pressure.

But the pressure in a cone clutch is given by:

P = (F * r ) / (L * μ )

Wait, where F is the force.

Alternatively, from the cone clutch pressure formula:

P = (F * r ) / (L * μ )

Where r is the mean radius, L is the length of the clutch.

But perhaps another approach: The cone clutch's pressure is P = (F * r ) / (L * μ )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to find an equation that relates torque to the desired parameters.

Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is:

Torque T = (P * e) / μ, where e is the pressure.

And the pressure e is given by e = (P_cone) = (P_friction * r ) / μ.

Wait, no, perhaps it's e = (P_friction * r ) / (μ), where P_friction is the frictional pressure.

Alternatively, the pressure in the cone clutch is given by:

P = (P_friction) * (r / (L)) 

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the correct formula.

I think the correct formula for the torque in a cone clutch is:

T = (P * e) / (μ)

And the pressure P is equal to (P_friction) * (r / L), where P_friction is the frictional pressure.

But perhaps that's not the way to go. Maybe I should look for the formula that directly connects torque, the cone angle, the pressure, and the surface width.

Wait, I found a formula online in the past, but let me try to reconstruct it. The cone clutch's torque is given by:

T = (P * L * r) / (μ * e)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for torque is:

T = (P * L * r) / (μ) 

Wait, that can't be right. Let's think about units. P is in psi, L is in inches, r is in inches. So (psi * in * in) / (unitless) = (lb/in² * in²) ) = lb. So torque is in lb-ft? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, units: P is psi = lb/in².

L is in inches, r is in inches.

So the product P*L*r would be (lb/in²) * (in) * (in) ) = lb * (in²) / in²) → lb.

But torque is in lb-in, not lb. So perhaps the formula is torque = (P * L * r ) / (μ) ) / 2.

Wait, so torque T is (P * L * r ) / (2 μ )

Wait, that would give units (lb/in² * in * in) / (lb·in) ) → (lb·in) / lb·in² → 1/in. Hmm, no, that doesn't match. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula that relates torque to the cone angle, pressure, and the mean radius.

Another approach: The formula for the cone clutch's torque is:

T = (P * e) / (μ) 

where e is the pressure, and P is the frictional pressure.

The pressure e is given by:

e = P_friction * r / L 

and P_friction is the pressure due to friction, which can be approximated by P_friction = (μ * g / cos θ )

Wait, perhaps that's where the 'μ' comes in. Since μ is given as the coefficient of friction, maybe it's the coefficient of friction between the cone surface and the disc.

Wait, but the formula for the cone clutch's torque might be:

T = (P * r) / ( μ * cos θ ) 

where P is the pressure in the clutch.

Hmm, but I'm getting stuck on the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the formula that relates the cone surface width (w), the cone angle (θ), the pressure (e), and the mean radius (r).

The cone surface width w is equal to 2 * r * tan(θ/2). So, w = 2 r tan(θ/2).

But I'm not sure. Let's think again. Maybe the formula for the cone surface width is:

w = 2 r * tan( θ / 2 )

Wait, that's for the cone's surface. So, if the mean radius is 7.5 in, and the angle θ is 12°, then:

w = 2 * 7.5 * tan(6° )

Wait, 6° is 12°/2. So tan(6°) is approximately 0.1051.

So 2 * 7.5 = 15, multiplied by 0.1051 → 1.5765 inches. So w ≈ 1.58 inches.

Looking at the options, option H is 1.5 in, which is close. But wait, maybe I'm missing a factor somewhere. Because the options include 1.6, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor in the formula. Let me think again.

The formula for the cone surface width could be w = (2 r) * tan(θ/2) * (some factor involving pressure and friction).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the cone surface width is:

w = ( ( P * r ) / ( μ ) ) * (1 / cos θ )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula I came across is:

w = ( ( 2 P r ) / ( μ g ) ) * (1 / cos θ )

But without knowing the pressure, I can't use that.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to compute the pressure first. The pressure in the cone clutch is given by:

P = (P_friction) * ( r / L )

Wait, but I need to find P. Alternatively, perhaps the frictional pressure is P_friction = ( μ * g ) / cos θ.

Wait, that makes sense. The frictional pressure is P_friction = ( μ * g ) / cos θ, where μ is the coefficient of friction, g is acceleration due to gravity (32.174 ft/s², but converted to in/s²), and θ is half the cone angle.

Wait, so let's compute P_friction:

P_friction = ( μ * g ) / cos(θ )

But wait, θ is the half-angle, so θ = 12° /2 = 6°.

So P_friction = (0.40 * 32.174) / cos(6° )

Compute that:

0.40 * 32.174 = 12.8696.

Cos(6°) ≈ 0.99452.

So P_friction ≈ 12.8696 / 0.99452 ≈ 12.95 psi.

Okay, that's the frictional pressure.

Now, the total pressure e (the pressure in the clutch) is the frictional pressure plus the pressure due to the radial load. But wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the total pressure is just the frictional pressure, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the pressure in the clutch is e = P_friction + P_cone ?

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach.

The torque T is given by:

T = (P * e) / ( μ )

Where P is the pressure, e is the pressure in the clutch, and μ is the coefficient of friction.

Wait, but earlier we found that e = (P_friction * r ) / L.

But without knowing L (the length of the clutch), we can't calculate e.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the pressure P in the clutch is given by (P_friction * r ) / L, but without knowing L, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the formula for the cone clutch's torque is:

T = (P_cone * r ) * (1 / cos θ ) / μ,

where P_cone is the pressure in the cone.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, I remember another formula: 

T = (P * e) / (μ) 

where e is the pressure, and P is the frictional pressure.

The frictional pressure is P_friction = ( μ * g ) / cos θ.

So substituting e = P_friction into T:

T = (P_friction * r ) / ( μ )

So substituting P_friction:

T = ( ( μ g / cos θ ) * r ) / μ )

The μ in the numerator and denominator cancel.

So T = ( g * r ) / ( cos θ )

Wait, but that can't be right because torque is in lb-in. Let me plug in the numbers.

g = 32.174 ft/s² = 386.088 in/s².

r =7.5 in.

cos θ = cos(6° ) ≈ 0.99452.

So T = ( 386.088 * 7.5 ) / 0.99452.

Compute numerator: 386.088 *7.5 = approx 2900.

Wait, 386 *7.5 = 2900.

Denominator: 0.99452 → approx 1.

So T ≈ 2900 / 1 → 2900 lb-in.

Wait, that can't be right because the power earlier was only about 0.955 lb-in.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach, perhaps the correct formula is:

T = (P_friction * r ) / ( μ )

But earlier I found that P_friction is ( μ g ) / cos θ.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation.

So P_friction = (0.4 *32.174 ) / cos(6° )

= (12.8696 ) / 0.99452 

≈ 12.95 psi.

So e = 12.95 psi.

Then T = (12.95 * 7.5 ) / (0.4 * cos(6° )) )

Wait, no, because in the formula T = (P * e) / ( μ ), so substituting:

T = (12.95 * 12.95) / (0.4 * cos(6° )) )

Wait, that would give units of (lb) / (unitless), which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should correct this. Let me go back.

The correct formula for the cone clutch torque is:

T = (P_cone * r ) / ( μ )

where P_cone is the pressure in the clutch.

And P_cone is given by:

P_cone = ( P_friction * r ) / L 

Wait, but without knowing L, this approach isn't helpful.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find the formula for the cone clutch torque again.

Upon further research, the formula for the cone clutch torque is:

T = ( P_friction * r ) / ( μ )

But wait, P_friction is the pressure due to friction. So if I can find P_friction, then I can compute T.

P_friction = ( μ * g ) / cos θ

So let's compute that.

μ = 0.40.

g = 32.174 ft/s² = 386.088 in/s².

θ = 6°, because the cone angle is 12°, so θ is 6°.

So P_friction = (0.40 * 386.088) / cos(6° )

Compute numerator: 0.40 * 386.088 = 154.435.

Denominator: cos(6° ) ≈ 0.99452.

So P_friction ≈ 154.435 / 0.99452 ≈ 155.4 psi.

So now, P_cone is the pressure in the clutch, which is equal to P_friction * (1 / L )

Wait, but I don't know L. So this approach doesn't work.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the pressure in the clutch as being the same as the frictional pressure, but that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps the formula is T = ( P_cone * r * μ ) / ( 2 )

I'm really stuck here. Let me try another approach. I remember that the cone clutch torque is given by:

T = ( P_cone * r ) / ( μ * cos θ )

But I don't know P_cone.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is T = ( P_friction * r ) / ( μ )

As earlier, but that leads to T = (155.4 * 7.5 ) / 0.4 * cos(6° )

Wait, let's compute:

155.4 *7.5 = 1165.5.

Denominator: 0.4 * cos(6° ) ≈ 0.4 * 0.99452 ≈ 0.3978.

So T ≈ 1165.5 / 0.3978 ≈ 2936 lb-in.

But that's way higher than our initial torque of ~0.955 lb-in, which can't be right because it's impossible for a 250 hp clutch to have a torque of 0.955 lb-in.

So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

T = ( P_friction * r ) / ( 2 μ )

But again, that would give a very high torque.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me check another source.

Ah, I found a formula that might help. The formula is:

T = ( (P_friction) * r ) / ( μ * cos θ )

Wait, but P_friction is ( μ * g ) / cos θ.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should try to find the correct formula by considering the cone's geometry.

The cone surface width is given by w = 2 r sin( θ )

Wait, because θ is half the cone angle. So if the cone angle is 12°, θ is 6°, so sin(6° ) ≈ 0.1045.

So w = 2 * 7.5 * 0.1045 ≈ 1.57 inches.

Looking at the options, option H is 1.5 in, which is close but not quite.

But wait, perhaps I should consider the formula for the cone's surface width as w = 2 r ( sin θ ), where θ is in radians. So 6° is about 0.1047 radians. So 2 *7.5=15, 15 *0.1047≈1.57 inches. So H is correct.

But why the discrepancy between this and the earlier calculation using the pressure approach?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the pressure approach. Let me try again.

The pressure in the clutch, e, is given by e = (P_friction) / cos θ.

And P_friction is ( μ * g ) / cos θ.

So e = ( μ * g ) / ( cos θ )^2

Wait, let me compute this.

μ = 0.40.

g = 32.174 ft/s² = 386.088 in/s².

θ =6°, so cos(6) ≈ 0.99452.

So e = (0.4 * 386.088) / (0.99452)^2.

Compute numerator: 0.4*386.088 ≈ 154.435.

Denominator: (0.99452)^2 ≈ 0.98915.

So e ≈ 154.435 / 0.98915 ≈ 156.4 psi.

Now, the torque T is given by T = (P * e) / ( μ )

Wait, but P is the frictional pressure, which is P_friction.

Wait, P = P_friction = ( μ * g ) / cos θ.

So substituting P and e into T:

T = ( ( μ g / cos θ ) * ( μ g / cos² θ ) ) / ( μ )

Simplify:

= ( μ² g² / ( cos θ * cos² θ ) ) / μ )

= ( μ g² ) / ( cos^3 θ ) / μ )

Cancel μ:

= ( g² ) / ( cos^3 θ )

Compute:

g = 386.088 in/s².

g squared ≈ (386.088)^2 ≈ 149,088.

cos θ = 0.99452.

cos^3 θ ≈ 0.99452^3 ≈ 0.98305.

So T ≈ 149,088 / 0.98305 ≈ 152,200 lb-in.

Again, that's way too high. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for torque is T = (P * e) / ( μ ), where P is the pressure, and e is the eccentricity, which is (P * r ) / ( L ), but without knowing L, it's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe I can compute the cone surface width directly and compare it to the possible options.

The cone surface width w is given by w = 2 r sin(θ ), where θ is the half-cone angle. So:

θ = 12° / 2 = 6°.

So sin(6° ) ≈ 0.1045.

Thus, w = 2 * 7.5 * 0.1045 ≈ 1.57 inches.

Looking at the options, option H is 1.5 inches, which is the closest. But option G is 1.6 inches, which is also close.

But how do I know which one is correct? Well, perhaps the correct formula for the cone surface width is w = 2 r tan(θ ), which is 2 r (θ in radians).

In this case, θ in radians is 6° * π/180 ≈ 0.1047 radians.

So w ≈ 2 *7.5 *0.1047 ≈1.57 inches, which matches option H.

Therefore, the correct answer is H, 1.5 inches.
